I am from Brazil, but I am currently living in the US. I can give some tips about making a brigadeiro:
1. Condensed milk in the US is a litlle different from the Brazilian version. It is not so sweet as the Brazilian, therefore I would recommend using a chocolate powder like Nesquick.
2. Cook the mixture until it thickens enough to show the pan bottom during stirring.
3. Pour the mixture in a lightly greased dish and let it cool to room temperature.
4. Now you are ready to form the little balls, remember to grease your hands with margarine first!
5. Roll it over sprinkles 
6. Place the balls in candy cups (small size)and voilla! Enjoy it!

In Brazil every child's birthday includes this wonderful specialty. Children adore brigadeiro.

Ok, this recipe should be better explained. This is an extremelly popular desert and very easy to make, but you do have to follow some tips:

1. Until when to cook? Until, if you tip the pan a little bit, the "dough" appears to be lose from the pan. To make it easier to roll them up, wait another 2 minutes after that. 

2. You have to stir constantly the whole cooking time. Do not stop!

3. How to roll it: spray cooking oil in your hands (or butter/margerine). Take a teaspoon full of the dough and roll it, like you would do with clay.

4. After rolling: Roll the balls on chocolate sprinkles or on crystal sugar.

Good luck!

I've been making these at Holiday time every year since a friend came back from a year in Brazil in high school - many years ago. Everyone who tastes them asks for the recipe! 

I've found that it's kind of an art to get the timing right. I also found that a doubled recipe cooks better for me. Also, I get anywhere from 40-60 balls per can. My tips for making these are: 1. I use a combo of Nesquik and cocoa powder (proportionally about 2/3 to 1/3 Quik to cocoa for good, dark flavor).  2. The original recipe I was given called for 1/2 to 3/4 cup of Nesquik to 1 can condensed milk, but I've changed that to make it darker and richer: I use about 1/2 cup Quik and 1/4 cup or slightly less of cocoa for each can.  3. I start on medium heat (gas), and lower it to med/low. You can raise it a bit again near the end. I found the longer cooking time makes it more caramelly, and allows the chocolate to hold its shape better. Cook anywhere from 15-25 minutes for a double recipe. 4. In addition to watching for the chocolate to pull away from the pan when the pan is tilted, I also do the following to evaluate done-ness: a. put a little plate or bowl in the freezer and take out when cooking. Drop a blob of chocolate on the plate when near done. The chocolate should quickly solidify and stay solid - not run.  b. To evaluate chocolate readiness, start lifting up a spoonful of it and letting it drop back into the pot. The blob should hold its shape fairly well (stay visible) and not immediately a

You cannot beat these for a simple, yet amazing looking, THREE INGREDIENT (which are staples, at that) treat!  First, MANY MANY thanks to the top 2 reviewers who's tips made making these a breeze.  I followed the following tips from them:  A:  KEEP STIRRING!!!  B:  You'll know when it's done.  For real.  2 things will happen:  it will thicken and start to "pull away" from the sides of the pan AND when you stir it will open a valley to the bottom of the pan.  Keep stirring for 2 minutes after this happens.  C:  pour into a bowl sprayed w/PAM (cooking spray)  D:  Spray your hands w/PAM before trying to roll (I don't know how you'd begin to it otherwise)  The "toppings" I used for rolling:  sprinkles, colored sugar, almonds, coconut, crushed Nilla wafers.  Toppings I plan to use in future batches:  crushed pretzels, cocoa, 10X sugar [confectioners' sugar], crushed Oreos.  This made 18 (-the one i ate) about 2/3 the size of a golf ball for me.

These went over really well at my church potluck. Unfortunately, even with the advice of others, I also experienced difficulty in the forming stage, even after having let it sit in the fridge for a time. But I think that had I given it a good 3 hrs in the fridge (until the ENTIRE blob was cooled, even the center), then it would have worked fine. Seeing how I was able to work half into balls pretty easily ntil I encountered some warmer gooier stuff, then returned it to the fridge and formed the other half later with no problems. I greased a melon ball roller (and my hands)which worked really well for scooping it up to roll into balls, then rolled in either cocao powder, icing sugar, crushed almonds or walnuts. They looked great, like truffles!! I put each into it's own very small muffin liner and kept refrigerated until served and they kept their shape perfectly.
***Made this again with the advice of a reviewer flatten between cling wrap and put in the freezer. Very easy to handle this way, forming went much faster this time. Thanks

It tastes quite good! I didn't even had time to roll and it was all gone :o)
I was reading some reviews and one said that it tasted bitter. Well you have to use 100% unsweetened cocoa. And you don't need as much cocoa to give it a good chocolate taste. For who doesn't know, cocoa is a fruit (actually it is the powdered and dried cocoa seed). Don't ever use baking chocolate (there is not much pure cocoa on it!) I've tried to make Brigadeiro  with no butter and it worked just fine. If it is too gooey simply cook more (30 min in low heat is ideal) and let it cool down. Cook until you see the bottom of the pan when you stir (never stop stiring or it will burn). You should be able to turn the pan upside down without any spills. A great use of Brigadeiro when it is gooey is to use it as a cake filling. Yummy! since it has no transfat, it is much healthier than using those shortening based cake fillings.

Oh, my god. This was awsome. I usually don't write reviews a lot, but this one, YES... I had to write it!!! It looked like professionally made chocolate, like Godiva chocolate, and tasted like better than those. I used some crushed nuts to mix in the dough, and used cocoa poweder (both unsweetened for adults and sweetened for kids), crushed nutes and confectionary suger to cover them. (black bitter ones, black sweet ones, nutty ones, and romantic white ones...etc:)) Oh, my God,,,,, this was awsome.  Pls do try!! I honestly do do od think that people can not distinguish these from famous brand chocolate. (both tastes and looks) 10 stars. It deserves it.

I just prepared this in the mirowave and it worked fine!  Just be careful of the bowl size because the heat made the fudge bubble over.  Let it cool before rolling because otherwise it is a sticky mess!  This is a very delicious recipe and easy to make.

This is a wonderful treat, as well as a quick and easy fix for the chocoholic out there. I had no problems, and am wondering if those who did might not have cooked it until it started pulling away from the sides of the pan. Thanks Romina. This is a delicious and quick treat.

The first time I made this recipe, I had never eaten a brigadeiro.  I had just learned that our family would be moving to Brazil for 4 years, and eager to get into the spirit of it all I researched recipes and decided to make these.  They were disappointing:  dry, crumbly, too sweet.  I couldn't imagine what the fuss was all about.  I've now been here 3 years and eaten dozens.  Here are my tips:
1.  DO NOT OVERCOOK.  Combine ingredients, cook over low-ish heat, stir constantly, and turn off the heat the very second the mixture comes together and pulls away from the pan when you tilt it.  IMMEDIATELY turn out into a buttered bowl.  It will seem undercooked and too liquidy; it's not.  
2.  Let cool to room temperature before proceeding.  Butter your hands, roll and dip into sprinkles.  They will be very mushy. The sprinkles and the mini paper cups are in fact what help the brigadeiro retain it's round shape.  When you bite into them they should be soft and caramel-y but not chewy. Overcooking by even a minute will ruin them.
3.  Sprinkles:  chocolate jimmies are the most common here. You can do better.  High-end brigadeiro places will roll them in Callebaut dark chocolate flakes for a "meio amargo" (bittersweet) flavor -- see photo of one I made today .  Kids love rainbow sprinkles, but use the tiniest little ball ones.  Pistachios ground to a powder make an AMAZING brigadeiro.  Or serve them poured into mini shot glasses and topped with sprinkles, and serve with a tiny spoon.

This was super easy and super delicious! I rolled half of mine in nuts and the other half in chocolate sprinkles. You definitely know when these are done - the mixture firms up pretty quick in the pan. The only thing I'd say is to skip the step of buttering your hands - that made my balls to slick and nothing would stick to the outside of them. The mixture is slightly sticky, but not enough so it sticks to anything, other than some toppings! Delicious! I'd give it 10 stars! I plan on making these again and again and again!

This is a delicious and simple recipe.  I use Hershey Special Dark chocolate cocoa poweder to give them the extra fudgy dark chocolate flavor.  I also use a hand blender to mix everything together before cooking.   This helps eliminate little balls of cocoa powder.

To me, these were just "ok."  Sort of like Tootsie Rolls, sort of like cooled but firm hot fudge, but different somehow.  I'm not the best judge because my sweet tooth isn't super-crazy.  We rolled them in coconut, crushed pecans, or crushed white chips, because it's what we had.  Made for a project on Brazil my daughter had to do for her (sophomore) Global Issues class.  She said she and her classmates loved them.  Of course, give a little chocolate to a bunch of teenagers and most of them will say "mmm.  yum!"

I heard about this recipe from 2 Brazilian men I know.  They suggested doing something to make it sweeter so I used tips from other reviewers and used the 1 tbs butter, 1 14 oz can of sweetened condensed cream, and 3 tbs nesquick.  It was delicious!  I waited until it was super thick to start.  I also sprayed my hands with the cooking spray to keep the stickiness to a minimum.  I covered with all types of sprinkles, powdered sugar, and nesquick.  I included a picture!  It was a big hit!

I took these to a dinner party and they were a total hit! People couldn't believe how amazing they were! I am so glad I read the reviews before trying to make these or I think my first time would have been a disaster. Some of the key points to remember include: 1) cook/stir the mix in the saucepan for longer than you think. When you think it's done, heat a little longer. The mix has to get rather firm before taking you're done. 2) Transfer heated mix to bowl and put in freezer for as long as possible. I used an aluminum bowl without any  oil and it came off fine. I left it in the freezer almost an hour, which was long enough for it to stiffen all the way through. 3) I sprayed my hands with PAM and it really helped prevent the mix from sticking while I was rolling the balls. 4) Double the recipe, as the original recipe only yielded about 15 balls for me. But I like big balls so...Make them smaller if you want more. I don't think you can have too much. Just refrigerate or freeze any leftovers for periodic treats or another dinner party.

Definitely use a mix of toppings to roll your balls - the variety keeps it interesting and looks better when presented on a platter. I rolled some in powdered sugar, some in chocolate sprinkles, some in crushed Nilla Wafers, and some in coconut (my favorite!!!). 

Enjoy!

I made these for Thanksgiving and they are beautiful and yummy. I doubled the recipe, added an extra 2tbsp of cocoa and cooked on med/low for 20/25mins like another person suggested. It worked out great. I chilled over night and then formed the balls in the morning. I made a several different types, coconut, cocoa, powdered sugar, pecans, and almonds. Very elegant and beautiful, but really easy.

This recipe turned out better than I expected. The first 2 posts were instrumental in helping me. The taste is awesome and my husband nearly ate all of them. Perfect for chocolate cravings. We will be making these again and again and again and . . . .

Use Nesquick instead of cocoa powder for the traditional brazilian recipe. It  gives the right consistency for the candies. Also roll in in chocolate sprinkles. This is the way people really do in Brazil.

These candies are so good!  I saw the recipe a few weeks ago and had the opportunity to make it tonight.  I used a can of sweetened condensed milk, a tablespoon of butter and 4 tablespoons of chocolate Nesquik powder as one of the Brazilian reviwewers suggested.  I cooked it at just above the lowest setting on the stove for about 17 minutes, until it was very thick, then stuck the whole pan in the fridge for two hours.  I found the candy very easy to roll into balls and didn't need to butter my hands.  I rolled them in crushed Oreo cookies and put a peanut butter center in some.  As it should happen, I didn't know how many it was supposed to make and ended up only making 8 from the whole pan!  They were golf ball sized and just lovely.  I'm looking forward to making these to give to friends at Christmas.  I have several ideas for centers and things to roll them in: peanut butter (stick a glob of peanut butter in the fridge for a few minutes then roll it into balls, flatten a ball of the chocolate and wrap it around the peanut butter), maraschino cherries, those candy orange slices cut into thirds, caramels... And I plan to try rolling them in graham crackers, Christmas colored sprinkles and whatever else I can think of (they're sticky enough that it's probably necessary to roll them in something)! Also, I would describe the taste and texture of these as chocolate caramels.

I wouldn't call these fine chocolates but they are mighty fine tootsie rolls. ;o) They really do taste like gourmet tootsie rolls...although these have an addictive quality that tootsie rolls lack. Hubby ate 6 of them! I cooked mine until good & thick (it took right at 10 minutes...I think those who complained of it taking longer, either used too small a pan or doubled the recipe), poured/scooped it out into a greased 8" by 8" pyrex dish & allowed it to sit at room temp until it was cool enough to handle. It was still a bit warm & I was able to roll it into balls. I rolled some in chocolate sprinkles & some in crystal sugar...we thought the ones in the crystal sugar looked best & tasted best. I am putting this recipe in my Christmas candy folder but I won't be able to wait that long before having them again. Great recipe....thanks for sharing!

mmmm, I LOVE brigadeiro!  I find it really helpful to cool this in the fridge before forming the balls.  Also, you really want to roll these in chocolate sprinkles afterward to make brigadeiro.  I made them for a party and just reformed the chilled balls really quickly before displaying them, they were perfect, just like I remember in Brazil.  Very pretty dessert.  Hint: I used Strawberry Nesquick to make them pink for the kids' valentines parties.  They were great.  I imagine you could use any of the flavors of powdered Nesquick.

An awesome tip is to replace the 3 tablespoons of cocoa for 8 tablespoons of chopped up dark chocolate. It really improves the flavor!

My husband lived in Brazil for a few years so I decided I would make this for him as a surprise--what a hit! His only suggestion was instead of making them 2/3 the size of a golf ball, make them the size of whoppers so you can have more topping to chocolate ratio.

I love this recipe!!!!!!!!!!!!  I usually make with 4 spoons of quick chocolate, 1 spoon of butter, and i can of sweet condensed milk.  Mix no stop until you see the bottom of the pan.  Let it cool, use a little butter on your hands and start rolling them.  Drp them in a plate with sprinkle chocolates and place them in small paper cups.  If this is too much work, just use to top your icecream!!!! yummmmm!!!

I made these for International Day at my old school.  My class was Brazil, and they needed a good dessert to go with all the tasty food.  I found this recipe, and cooked it up.  It came it very rich and delicious!  I am a total chocoholic, so I had to be careful not to eat them all up before I got to class!  The only problem I had with these sweets was that, by the end of the day, they had flattened into this sheet of fudge on the pan.  The kids still ate, though.  They started ripping pieces off!  LoL, good recipe, definitely would recommend it to all lovers of chocolate.  Very easy, too.

I've been making Brigadeiros for a long time. I have a few suggestions. After the brigadeiro has cooled you should grease your hands with a little bit of butter. Even though it's feel disgusting it will help. Also after you've formed little balls roll them in chocolate sprinkles. If you dont like chocolate you can omit it and do the recipe the same way. Instead of rolling it in chocolate sprinkles you can roll them in coconut. This is what is called "beijinhos" (little kisses)

I had absolutely no problems when I made these with my preschool class during our study of South America.  The kids whisked together the milk and cocoa, then I added the butter and cooked the mixture over medium heat, stirring constantly.  It took about 10 minutes for it to get thick and pull away from the bottom of the pot.  Then I cooked it for a few more minutes to let the caramel flavor develop.

Next I scooped the mixture out into a bowl, spread it out a bit, and put it in the freezer to cool.  It took about 30 min. to cool, then we were able to roll the balls.  We did not need to coat our hands - it was not overly sticky.  The kids got to choose which sprinkles they wanted to roll in.  A big hit!

ps - we used unsweetened cocoa only - the sweetness was perfect.  Can't imagine wanting these any sweeter :)

good! very sweet. i rolled them in cocoa but coconut would have been good too. needed to cook over low so as not to burn and for a LOT longer to get it stiff enough to roll properly.

I am really into chocolate and peanut butter, so I substituted peanut butter for half the butter.  I also followed another users advice to use chocolate powder to make up for the lack of sweetness in the milk..I did two tablespoons of hot chocolate mix and one and a half tablespoons of cocoa powder.  Now I just wish I had something to roll them in, like sprinkles of some sort.  They turned out great, though!

Sorry, I'm Brazilian and I don't speak English very well, but this recipe is to make Beijinhos, and not Brigadeiros. For brigadeiros, its necessary to substitute "3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa" to "2 tbsp chocolate powder", and roll over the balls in chocolate sprinkles.
Aniway, congratulations to Romina for this recipe, very popular in Brazil too!

Pretty good. Mine turned out well. I kept the heat on medium-low and STIRRED CONSTANTLY. When it got nice and thick I put it in a buttered bowl and set it aside for about an hour. It balled up nicely and I dredged the balls in confectioner's sugar. They were good at room temperature but I liked them more chilled. I plan to try it again and add toasted coconut and a little vanilla. Heck, it's three ingredients--give it a try! Four stars.

I am Brazilian and these are my favorite since I was a child. I have taken this same recipe and turned it into a cake topping as well, just cook it a little less so it doesnt set so hard then pour it over a hot chocolate cake. It is delicious either way. :)

Easy to make! The pictures shows brigadeiros covered in coconut, nuts, and sugar. The Brazilian bakeries I have visited consistently coat the chocolate balls in brown chocolate sprinkles. Then, they are served in tiny cupcake paper cups or aluminum foil cups. The recipe came out just like the ones I tried to replicate in Brazil! Only issue I had was rolling the chocolate balls...I could not get the chocolate to cool enough so that I could handle it. I waited 45 minutes with the mixture on a cooling rack. And when that didn't work, I put it in the fridge for 30 minutes. It was very messy and was a messy cleanup, but as good as they tasted I am definitely going to use this recipe again.

Mmmm Delicioso!  Brought these to my church's adult Christmas party potluck.  HUGE hit!  I was asked for the recipe by several, and someone brought home the 10 that were leftover.  Following other reviewers, I cooked my chocolate (1/3 cocoa, 2/3 NesQuik) til it pulled away from the sides of the pan, and when I lifted the spoon, it stayed clumped rather than runny, about 15 minutes - constantly stirring.  Poured into greased brownie pan, stuck in freezer for 30 min, used a melon baller to grab the candy and roll in my hands.  They were little balls, about the size of a nickel if it was rounded, since I needed so many.  I should have doubled the recipe, stuck about 3 in little candy cups.  I decorated by rolling in red and green crystal sugar, and multicolored sprinkles - one of each in the cups would have been cute...As it was, I just arranged randomly in white tupperware to show off the colors.  Very sweet candy, delicious, very easy; the kids want me to make more to bring to their Nana's for our Christmas dinner. They were disappointed that there was nothing left to bring home for them!

5 stars for simple 3 ingredients, easy to make and lots of fun, especially for kids to help.  Toppings I have tried include, coconut, cocoa powder, crushed up shortbread, various sprinkles, and chocolate sprinkles, powdered sugar. Excellent! And I was suprised they are not so sickening sweet as I had anticipated. For those who need help with the Metric Conversion.... 14oz is roughly 400 ml (396 actually).

*This recipe makes such a delicious and creamy fudge!  Very simple...I suggest using a stainless steel pot and make sure to stir frequently!  I rolled some into walnuts (the best!), as well as coconut flakes, marshmallows, etc.  Very smooth!*

Yum!Yum!Yum!  My kids said "mom, those fudgy balls are delicious!"  Definately read other reviews and follow their tips.  I used Nestle baking cocoa powder and they turned out great.  Not too chocolatey and not too sweet.  My kids liked the balls rolled in crushed graham crackers or powdered sugar best.  They decided they did not like the ones rolled in regular sugar because they didn't like the gritty feeling while chewing the sugar.  They are going to school for a Valentine's day party so we made them for a trial run.  So easy that we will without a doubt be making them again.

Delicious and Easy to make! I've been giving them as little gifts to my friends. really like them rolled in coconut flakes and chocolate sprinkles. plain granulated sugar is ok but many people like the crushed Nilla wafers. I'm going to try crushed pretzels next!

Yum!  This is great.  I found this recipe by accident while trying to figure out how to use up a can of sweetened condensed milk.  I'm glad I did.  The balls are gooey with the consistency of an old fashioned caramel.  Will definitely make this again.

I made these using Nesquick, left the mix in the fridge for about 20 minutes, then sprayed Pam on my hands and on a spoon to help with the rolling process.  They came out great, and were a huge hit at a dinner party.  Tasted like they did when I was a kid in Brazil!

I was sooo excited about making this, because of the simplicity and the ingredients in it. Unfortunately, it did not turn out that great for me. It cooked in less than four minutes, and the texture was very grainy. Maybe I should have sifted the cocoa b4 adding? After it had cooled however, it was sooo easy to roll, and really fun to make. I just had to spray my hand with a bit of oil, and used a melon baller to get them out of the pan. The taste was okay, but maybe I'll cut down on the cocoa next time, and sift!! The family didn't like them much at all. I might make them again however, just for me and the kids, using nesquick maybe? I love the idea of them, they just didnt turn out great for me. I will try differently and see if they turn out better next time.Thanks for the recipe!

INSANELY good. I used Nesquick and cooked it right at ten minutes. Then, I let the mixture cool in a greased pan until it was room temperature. I rolled it into balls with no problem! Then I proceeded to eat almost all of them by myself. There should be a warning with this recipe that states, "Product is easily eaten and highly addictive." But you only live once, so eat these and ENJOY! I feel like I missed out for my whole life by not being Brazilian!

I am from Brazil and can testify that this is a very authentic candy in Brazil, mostly served at kid's parties but always enjoyed by kids and adults alike in most gatherings.  Pay special attention to the comment by Blandina because it is simple and you can't go wrong if you follow it.  If you roll them while it's too warm it will be difficult and more time consuming.  I also agree that Nesquik is better.  If you are presenting them at a party you should roll them in some kind of sprinkles ( I like the colored kind or chocolate) and put them in the tiny paper cups.  In Brazil we have a variation that excludes the chocolate and you add coconut (the more powdery kind) and essence like almond or vanilla and after done, roll them in coconut flakes and just for looks add a clove on top before putting them in the paper cups.  Enjoy!

This recipe is a good one.  We lived in Brazil for years, and we tried different cocoa powders, which did give them different tastes.  A great alternative is to eliminate the cocoa, add a tsp of almond extract at the end of the cooking stage, roll them in flaked coconut and then put a whole clove in them for decoration.  These were sold in every pastry place in Rio. My favorite!

Great recipe!  I combined a few previous reviews and added vanilla and cinnamon to the chocolate.  Then I used a melon baller sprayed with non-stick spray to form a small half circle of chocolate.  Then I covered them in either powdered sugar, or cocoa mixed with sugar and cinnamon.  They looked great and tasted even better!  It was an easy recipe, as long as you heat the mixture long enough so it's not too gooey; and refrigerate at least an hour before shaping into balls to decorate.  Thanks for this recipe!

These are great and fun to make!  The recipe is spot on about how many it makes, I got 21 little balls of chocolate goodness from it.  I did greese a plate and put it in the freezer for a while to get the cocolate to harden, next time it will be between two sheets of plastic as it stuck to the plate.  Also discovered that instead of rolling this in something you can wrap it around pieces of fruit and whole nuts to make delicious suprises!  I used strawberries, almonds and peanuts and then rolled the balls in icing sugar!  They were a HUGE hit.

My son had to prepare a recipe from any Latin American country to share with his World Studies class.  He chose this because it would be easy to share (no utensils or slicing and serving needed).  He used part chocolate milk drink mix, and relied on the tips so many reviewers have shared to prepare it.  Since his class is nut-free, he rolled some in chocolate sprinkles, and some in silver sugar.  They were simple to make, and turned out really well.  I was worried they would be sickly sweet, but they were about the same as any other candy.  The consistency of the finished product reminded me of a Tootsie Roll.  Fun recipe to make, too.  Thanks for sharing.

Super easy to make. I was expecting something like truffles, but this comes out like a chocolate flavored caramel. I left half the batch regular and rolled in cocoa powder and chopped cashews. The other half I mixed toasted coconut into the "dough", then rolled balls in toasted coconut. I bet this would be delicious dipped in chocolate, too! Great recipe!

This stuff is awfully addicting! When I am going to make little balls, I pour the hot brigadeiro onto a plate and stick it in the fridge to let it cool. I also butter my hands before rolling them. I have made them once by pouring them into small plastic shot cups, which turned out fantastic. They taste good with chocolate sprinkes or you can roll them in Nesquik powder. YUM!!

Awesome recipie! Loved it!! Immedietly after rolling them i rolled them all in different things such as: coconut, scor bits, grahm cracker crumbs, finely chopped nuts, hot chocolate powder, and mocha coffee powder mix. This made them look really fancy, and tasted even better. *When rolling into balls, use a very thin layer of butter or margerine to grease hands. Also, i found the review by BLANDINA extremely helpful and made it way easier and better, minus the part about them needing sweeter cocoa powder. :)

These were good and easy to make. Everyone enjoyed them and were surprised that we made them. I originally used the Eagle Brand recipe which called for coffee crystals. My husband is not a fan of coffee and we tried these as an alternative. They both ended up being good. We rolled some of them in toffee bits and others in chopped walnuts.

My older son actually made these for a class project on South America. Super easy to make (my son is 12 and needed no assistance) and a big hit with his 7 year old brothers. Fun dish to make with them since they can do most of the steps on their own.

These were very yummy but way too similar to Dulce de Leche. Brazilian brigadeiros have a different twist. They were great though, and the only difficulty I had had to do with the fact that I didn't cook the mix enough and had a hard time putting it into balls. I baked it over again and let it cool in the fridge for a while and it worked out perfect.

Ah, even Luiz Fernando loved this one! My family, those little sweeties, prefer adding Quick rather than unsweetened cocoa. I do find that it takes more than 10 minutes of cooking to get the proper consistency, but Luiz assures me that his other mom, back in Brazil, actually pours a more liquid product into small cups and serves them with spoons at their family gatherings. Thanks for the recipe!

YUMMY!! I had a craving for sweets and there wasn't much in the house, so my five-year-old and I decided on these. I used 3 TBS chocolate Ovaltine, around 1½ TBS cocoa powder, and the butter and sweetened condensed milk. It took around 13 minutes to thicken up, then I let it cool in the pot for 30 minutes and then poured it onto a buttered plate. It went into the fridge for around an hour, then I rolled them into 20 balls and coated them in granulated sugar. They were very similar to a Tootsie Roll and had a caramel-like texture. Thanks for sharing, Romina!

Yes, I'm also  Brazilian living in the US and 10 minutes is not even close to how long you must cook this w/ the condensed milk available here. It's more like 30-40 mins. You have to keep stirring or it will burn. The pot w/ the condensed milk can go directly onto the stovetop but it has to be a very low flame. My mom and I made this many times but it does take a bit of time. It is however DELICIOUS! Best to make it w/ a friend so you can divide up the task of stirring. Oh and the last tip - you really can't be sure it's cooked enough until it's cooled a bit because that's when you really can tell how much it's thickened. If it's too hot to handle or too sticky to handle even on your buttered hands then it needs to cook longer.

ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!  One of the easiest and most delicious recipes I've gotten from this site.  I stirred the mixture constantly, and it turned out so well.  For the cocoa, I used Ghiradelli chocolate powder (chocolate and sugar) to enhance the sweetness a bit, per the advice of my friend who is Brazillian.
I then put the cooked mixture in a glass bowl to stop the cooking process, and place in the fridge to chill a bit.  I then rolled into small balls and rolled in chocolate sprinkles.  These look like they were difficult to make, but were actually very simple.  Thank you for a truly outstanding  recipe!!

This makes sweet, caramel-y chocolatey good stuff!  I confess it did not ever get poured out of the pan. I kept picking off little pieces of it, burning my fingers in the process.  I finally just put the pan in the fridge and finished it off straight from there.  I do think sweetened condensed milk is plenty sweet though, so I wouldn't want to use Nesquik.  I promised myself not to ever make this again.

I made these for a Memorial Day cookout and everyone loved them.  I have a few tips though.  I added a tablespoon of powdered sugar to the mixture and I cooked it longer than it called for.  I think I cooked it about 15 minutes.  The trick is to look thick in the pot and when stirred, you should be able to see a line in the bottom of the pot where the spoon went through the mixture.  I rolled mine in colored sugar and sprinkles left over from Valentines Day.  They were very pretty.  I sprayed my hands with Pam and picked up a small amount of the candy between my right index finger and thumb and dropped it in the center of my left hand.  Then they were easy to roll and you only got your two fingers sticky instead of both of your hands.

I prepared it in the microwave, and it worked just fine.  I cooked it at 40% power for ten minutes, stirring every minute or so.  After it cooled it was definately sticky but rollable. It tasted very good, although it was a little on the sweet side.  For a quick candy it is definately worthwhile!

tried this recipe, and it was very sitcky. i froze it, to try and make it not gooey, but it didn't work. then, it sounded like a good recipe, but i had to drown my hands in oil and butter, just to make the sticky balls workable. when i finally ate one, it tasted bitter.

Made these for my daughter's 3rd grade research project on Brazil. I read the recipe and reviews here as well as at Cooks and did them my own way. Instead of 3 Tbsp cocoa as listed here I used the other recipe's suggested 1 cup of cocoa. In addition to that I added about 1/4 cup liquid Nesquik chocolate syrup. I did this because one reviewer on this recipe suggested it because this version wasn't quite sweet enough like in Brazil. She seemed to know the real thing. It never really bubbled or boiled for us and didn't even exactly pull away from the sides of the pan but it did begin to clump together in one thick blob so that's when I took it off the heat. 
***Please note that you should not use a whisk to stir. It's too thick. Just use wooden spoon or heat safe spatula. 
I placed it between two pieces of wax paper, flattened and chilled in refrigerator. Then we made them into balls easily with our hands buttered. They were sooooo good and taste almost like brownies with a softer tootsie roll texture. We used chocolate sprinkles, finely chopped pecans, coconut, and powdered sugar. This will probably become a regular treat we make. Thank you Brazil! I hope ours are close to the real thing.

I LOVE to cook. I saw these on tv and I had to make them, they looked so simple and delicious! I put chocolate chips on some of them, heath bar pieces on some, and almonds on the rest. Cant wait to eat them and thanks for the tips!

Nope. I followed this recipe exactly and it absolutely DID NOT come together. I even chilled the concoction in the fridge overnight and, still, it was just goo (firm goo, but goo none-the-less). Maybe I didn't cook it all for long enough?

If you are having trouble with stickiness, then just refrigerate them until cool to the touch, and if they are still sticky, then roll them in a coating of cocoa, nuts, etc.

I grew up in Brazil and remember all the birthday parties with these delicious treats!  I felt so lucky to get the recipe from my grandmother before she passed. The only difference to this recipe from my grandmother's is that she would also add in a tablespoon of strong coffee. This gives it a wonderful extra bit of flavor. My favorite treat of all time.

Delicious simple brigadero.  I am in love it tastes just like it did in Brazil!  I whipped up a batch in the microwave in about 5 minutes then cooled it in the fridge for a few hours and it turned out fantastic.

These taste really good..but Im not sure I cooked it long enough because even tho they held their form after cooling, they never did get past the light gooey stage..is this normal? How firm are they supposed to be?

It is very simple. The secret here is let it cook until starts boiling and the bottom is coming off from the pan. Do not let boil too much or it will become too sticky (I like but most people don't). Another is to switch the cocoa/nesquick for Carnation Hot Chocolate powder. It gets delicious this way. 
When the dough is cool, you can make small balls (put a bit of butter in our hands to make it easy) and cover in anything you want: sugar/crushed walnuts/sprinkles/dark chocolate powder. It will look like a truffle and will be a hit in any party!

A very sticky situation...lol. We love the taste & thick-soft caramel texture. Honestly, this candy was too soft to pick up. Using a mini liner is a must, otherwise, it will melt on your fingers. We thought it went well dipped in chocolate, so that the outer shell can harden and get a surprise bite inside. I think this would be great filling for cupcake/cake or for drizzling...

Fantastic. I read over 100 reviews and came up with some changes. Instead of 3 tbsp. cocoa I used 1/4 cup Toll House Cocoa, and 1/2 cup sugar free Nestles Quik and Fat free sweetened condensed milk. I also Sifted both the cocoa and Nestles Quik into the sweetened condensed milk and stirred in really good before putting on Medium heat. It was ready right at ten minutes. Refrigerated for one hour and used the melon baller tool to scoop out of bowl. I did remove from pan and put in bowl.I put on some gloves to roll balls and then rolled in crushed slivered almonds. Will diffinitly make again. They are delicious.

Very easy and very tasty. It is a bit sticky to eat, but it is still very fresh. I think that refrigerating it will fix that. A nice alternative to truffles.

Mmmmm. These were yummy. It just mostly taste like condensed milk, but I like condensed milk so I have no problems with it. I made enough for 8 balls, 2 were just chocolate - no coating, 2 with chocolate sprinkles, 2 with powdered sugar, and 2 with crushed peanuts. Both my boyfriend and I liked the peanuts the best. We both agreed that even though it looks pretty, the powdered sugar and chocolate sprinkles basically taste like the uncoated one.

Other reviewers were extremely helpful and I was able to get the consistency just right. The brigadeiro set up just like they should, so if you do make them, follow the recommendations of others....  BUT, I did not care for the flavor at all. Even my children and husband didn't like them. I think you have to REALLY love the flavor of condensed milk to enjoy these.

Very good, super easy to make and very versatile. Roll  the balls in flaked coconut, crushed roasted pistachios, cocoa powder and brown sugarto get an assorted box of scrumptiousness. Thank you so much for sharing!

These are fantastic! I cook the batter for a few minutes after it thickens then place it in the refrigerator to make it easier to roll. I have rolled them in chocolate sprinkles, crushed almond, coconut and toffee bits. Definitely a crowd pleaser!

Lovely! Kids love these! It could be a tad too sweet/milk-like for the adults! But I liked it all the same! Just remember to sift your cocoa powder and definitely mix pronto so as to avoid clumping of the cocoa powder! If you are upto improvising as against the traditional brigadeiro, I would suggest adding some ground nuts too...but just a little. Also, make them into small balls. As other reviewers suggested, rolling them in nuts/sprinkles/colored sugar/sweetened desiccated coconut are all splendid ideas! :)

I didn't run into the same problem so many reviewers had with the mixture not setting firmly enough (I'm curious if those people with problems may have used margarine instead of butter, since margarine has a higher water content and could be contributing to that type of problem), but in the end, I didn't really like these at all. The level of effort involved relative to taste was completely disproportionate, and I don't intend to ever make these again.

For what it is it's great!  It reminds me of sweet balls of chocolate dulce de leche.  I did a few different rolls - some in almonds, powdered sugar, cocoa, cinnamon, or coconut.  I really liked the cinnamon ones!  Be sure to follow the reviews of others and add crisco or something to your hands, along with cooking it long enough so that it becomes like a dough in the pan.

I'm only giving this four stars for the cooking method...I find that cooking it on low for 30 minutes (stirring constantly!) gives it an even, smooth texture and taste. But cooking it for 12-15 on medium heat is okay too. It's condensed milk--you can't go wrong with condensed milk! :D

This is my second time making these and they always turn out the way I remembered however it only gets 4 stars because its so  messy to make. I fuond that letting it sit on the heat longer (12 mins) and letting it cool for about 30 mins gets it to the right consistency, however there was so much chocolate stuck to the pan this time. I think next time I'll scoop it out and put it in  a glass bowl before letting it cool and hopefully that will eliminate the waste.

I was disappointed. It's probably a very good version of the 'brigadeiro', but after reading reviews I was thinking I was going to end up with a type of chocolate. To me it was more like an adorned Kraft caramel. Great if that is what you're expecting.

I made these for a quick sweet fix (and I had all the ingredients on hand). It took longer to cool these into a workable state than I expected - had to put it in the fridge for a while.  The texture was like tootsie rolls, which is fine, but I was expecting something more like truffles. I used non-fat condensed milk, and it was plenty sweet.  I used Hershey's cocoa powder and ended up with many cocoa lumps - will have to sift it in next time. Thank you previous reviewers for your excellent tips!

i was expecting something firmer.  the candy was moldable, but it was way too soft.  it's so soft you don't even need to bite it, or even use your teeth to eat it.  it tastes good, especially if you can get past the soft texture.  but then again, i can only eat one.

I followed the advice of other reviewers and used Nesquick,and also added an extra little scoop of cocoa for richness.It definitely took the full ten minutes to get it to a nice thick consistency,then I poured it onto lightly greased plate to make it easier to grab.Make sure you don't forget to grease your fingers,or you will just have a sticky mess.These rolled easily,and I coated them in both the chocolate sprinkles and coconut.I thought they were great,but I didn't really know what they were supposed to taste like.The true test was my brazilian fiance,who thought they were fantastic.His only complaint was they were gone too fast!

These weren't good at all. I followed the recipe exactly and it came out gooey, sticky, and too sweet.

FANTASTIC but TIME CONSUMING.  Since good things come to those who wait, go the extra mile and consider really jazzing it up.  

Melt dark or milk chocolate (barks work well b/c they harden better), dip the balls into the chocolate and completely submerge them, then cool and harden on wax or parchment paper.  

Melt white chocolate and with a fork 'spatter' the white chocolate on top and you have a gourmet looking candy that is out of this world!

I followed Blandina's advice and used Hersey's cocoa and it came out fantastic.  I had no problems whatsoever.  I actually made them for my son's class while they were studying South America and everyone raved over them.

We all loved them, I also added almond extract. I tried another without the chocolate but add almond & cherry extracts, oh my those were great.  Simple recipe but so many different flavors can be made.  This has to be my favorite!!!

These were good, they tasted almost like the inside of a chocolate Riesen candy.  I liked them best when they were rolled in a mixture of finely crushed cocoa powder and instant coffee granules.  I had to cook mine for about 30 minutes and refrigerated them for about 3 hours before trying to roll into balls - had no problems!

I didnt read all of the reviews and mine came out a bit gooey, even after leaving it on the fridge for over an our.  I made the balls and they sort of dropped, they looked like hot stone from the spa, lol.  Nevertheless, it was good.  Next time I'll add some rum to balance out the taste of the condensed milk.  You really have to stir for a while...not 10 minutes, more like 30 minutes.

I've been making this recipe for as long as I can remember.  I grew up in Brazil and it brings back a lot of great memories.  

This can also be made with Nestle Quik, in either chocolate or strawberry.

These are tasty and extremely easy to make. I let them cool for 5 mins after cooking and then flattened the mass between 2 sheets of cling film and put in the freezer for 20 mins. They were easy to roll and looked pretty. I rolled them in cocoa powder, coconut, crushed almonds, and icing sugar.

I think the people that found this recipe too runny didn't wait long enough before attempting to mould it. I waited a good 2 hours, and then chilled for 15 mins just to be sure. They turned out wonderful. Gooey, chewy and chocolatey. I can't wait to experiment with these. Cinnamon, peppermint, coffee... This recipe allows a lot of room for variety.

Ladies, you are making it all too difficult. Rather than attempting to roll, spoon into tart pans, cool in frig. When ready to serve scoup out with soft spatula onto small plate. I put XXXX sugar on the plate and a wedge or two of fresh Pineapple. This is a WONDERFUL, easy, inexpensive dessert. A very small amount (teaspoon full) goes a long way. Try the tart pans and I think you will be much happier.

This did not turn out. Did just as directed on recipe, the batter did not form balls. i dropped some in a bowl of sprinkles, and put it on wax paper covered plate. It flattened and all formed into one big huge plate of brigadero! tasted good, but too much of a mess. probably will not make it again.

I do not understand the high rating of this recipe. I followed the directions and even printed out several of the "Most Helpful" reviews, and it still came out a disaster! It had the consistency of glue even when completely cooled. It would not form balls and just created a huge, sticky mess in my kitchen. I have been using Allrecipes for over a decade and cook foods from all over the world and have never seen a recipe turn out so horribly.

The one star rating is because the flavor is decent--like a stiff chocolate milk.

I used 4 T of cocoa, 1/2 stick of butter and 14oz can of sweetened condensed milk.  I made it according to these directions and was able to make about 30 bite-sized balls.  You can roll them in sugar, cinnamon, coconut flakes, chili powder, or whatever other coatings you might like with chocolate.  I stored them in an airtight container in the refrigerator.  They're delicious and I don't feel bad having one a day.  Something sweet to finish with!

First off I made its recipe by my self if if I can do it so can you.  Follow blandinas instructions simmer on medium heat for 15 to 20 min wait until it is thick. It will start to glob up on the side of the dish that's when you really need to stir or it will burn and become chewy. After that spread out in a pan until it is room temp now tool in toppings I used crushed almonds, powdered sugar, salt, and crushed chocolate chips.

I am Brazilian and have already tried to make our Brazilian Brigadeiro in different countries, but it didn't work. The condensed milk was too sweety and the powder chocolate didn't really taste like chocolate. Don't know if we can do the recipe, with the same taste, without our own ingredients... And not being rolled is tastes even better!

I used other people's feedback and added 3 TB of Nesquick instead of cocoa powder. I started it on 2 on the electric stove and after 5 minutes turned it up to 4 since it wasn't hot enough. I stirred for about 25 minutes. I think the trick is that once it gets really hard to stir then you stop (you will feel it to start thicken--keep going until it's a lot of work to keep going). I cooled it for about 30 minutes on parchment paper and then started rolling and coating them. The dough was sticky but I found it was easier to handle when my hands were wet and the toppings also stuck on much better than with butter/oil. Feedback from my Brazilian friend was that they tasted authentic.

Happy to find this recipe online after eating them at a party!  In addition to chocolate Brigadeiro, I also tried the party host's idea to use lemon zest(1tsp), lemon juice(1Tbl) and white chocolate chips instead of butter.  Nice alternative to chocolate.  Turned out great, very caramel like, glad for the reviews.

This is an awesome dish. I have a brazilian heretage and me and my father used to make this all the time. I will warn of one thing though, this IS a type of candy. And like all types of candy, there's an art to it. Don't give up if you fail once, I know I did a BUNCH when I was learning to make it again recently. If your result was too tough to handle, you will need to remember to take it off the heat sooner, and if it's too soft, leave it in the heat longer. It dosn't HAVE to be perfect though, because once I made a batch that was WAY too soft and I just ate it out of a bowl. Also, remember the traditional Brigadeiros are coated heavily with chocolate jimmys. :-)

I love this recipe, it's like chocolate caramel! It's pretty much fool-proof to make, as long as you keep stirring so it doesn't burn. Next time, I'm going to try freezing the balls and dipping them in melted chocolate! Yum! Make your balls fairly small so they aren't too sticky to eat. Love it!

Fast to make and very good to satisfy my chocolate cravings!! Very adaptable on how you cover them. I used shredded coconut on some, powdered sugar..., toffee bits, some with nuts just what ever i had in the cabinet.

I love this stuff and I've made this recipe several times.  I really don't know why so many people are having trouble rolling these, and I can only assume it's an issue of not cooking it long enough.  You have to get a feel for it, but I cook it about 15 minutes.  I chill it for at least a few hours before I try to work with it, at which point it's much like a clay.  When you roll it in your hands, it heats up the surface, making it sticky enough for the toppings.  They're like sweetened condensed milk tootsie rolls, and they're absolutely fabulous.

I was craving these the day before yesterday,, and I tried to call my mom to get the recipe but then I found them on this site and all the ingredients were as I remebered.. I did them the was We did them as a kid.. after the mixture is completley blended and cooked pour hot mixture in a pie pan.. and then coat your hands with butter to prevent sticking and burning yourself and dive into the hot mixture rolling the balls and then immediatley putting them in chocolate sprinkles.. I did it myself ( though i remeber begina kid helping my mom make them) she would roll them hot and thow them in the sprinkles and us kids would roll them in the sprinkles.. I think they stick to the candy better if they are as hot as can be,.. If you can recruit someone to be designated as the sprinkler then i think it would be easier than if you did them yourself.. anyway,.. they are delish and still soft from the fridge :)

WOW yummy! So creamy, I made 28. I had so much fun decorating these brigadeiros. I used tiny marshmellows around one and it looked like a flower....HA! ( see picture) I also rolled them in strawberry nesquik, power sugar mixed with cinnamon, nuts, crunched Oreo cookies and carved a small hole in several strawberrys and filled it with recipe and add sprinkles and nuts on top...now those were good! Easy, fun, will make these again.

This is one of my favorite dessert! The best part is it only requires three ingredients, and it's pretty easy to make! try to use good quality cocoa powder, it really make a difference. I like to add 1/4C (4Tbsp) cocoa powder instead of 3Tbsp to make the chocolate taste more intense.

This is a quick & easy little treat - and fun for kids to help with. I needed to use up some sweetened condensed milk from a dinner dish earlier today and this was perfect! Even my husband, who doesn't like sweets, liked the brigadeiro! I used food server's plastic gloves instead of greasing my hands and rolled the balls in chopped nuts.

The recipe is almost authentic, it's missing the crucial final step: the sprinkles. The original brigadeiro from Brazil is always rolled in chocolate sprinkles. A very good tip to make rolling easier: spread a little bit of butter/margarine on your hands, it will avoid the annoyance of having the dough stick to your fingers.

We made this for Girl Scout Thinking Day, and everyone wanted the recipe. For those who found it sticky: It may need a slightly longer cooking time. By the time I form the balls from the cooled mixture, it is more satiny than sticky.

I made these as the recipe directs, but maybe I should have read some of the reviews first. They turned out ok, but not great. If I make them again, I will probably add some Nesquick as some reviews suggested. I only used 3 TB cocoa. I was not sure how long to cook because on medium heat, the mixture started to pull away from the pan after about 3 minutes. I cooked just a minute or two longer because the recipe had said about 10 minutes. I think the length was fine. They were sticky after cooling, but I did not have a problem rolling them. I just think the flavor could have used something, so read the reviews about using nesquick instead of straight cocoa. They were really quick and simple to make though! Great for a quick treat.

Hi Guys, I usually use light condensed milk. Also, Make sure to make the brigadeiro on a non sticky pan.  Another little note is cook this on a light cooking temperature.. So it stays long enough to be hard without burning or sticking all over the pan!

These are really good.  Although I thought they would be more like chocolates, this is just caramelly candy with a slight chocolate flavoring.  I found that putting it in a seperate pan with greased wax paper worked really well.  Once I got it started it just peeled right off, I cut it into equal sized chunks and rolled it.  Very easy and very good, just make sure to cook it long enough.

I just made these a few hours ago and they're currently in my fridge. 

It's my first time having Brigadeiro, so I suppose I can't say if they came out right or not, but I can say that they taste great! I followed the recipe here exactly, other than adding chocolate sprinkles and powdered sugar. 


The only issue I had was that the cocoa was a bit too lumpy; I found myself picking lumps out of it before I rolled it into balls. I'd suggest sifting the cocoa in to avoid lumps. 

All in all?  Great recipe. I plan on making a couple batches for Thanksgiving and Christmas parties.

amazing! very chocolate-y. though they are hard to roll, its worth it in the end! =) greasing your hands with butter or pam frequently is essential. when i first made these i used the info from a review on page 5, the user name is BLANDINA. very very helpful.

Decided to make these for my Brazilian hubby. They had bit of a learning curve to make but they were more than edible. The instructions are not clear so make sure you read the other reviews to help with the steps. I used Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa and rolled them in the cocoa at the end. So good. Can not wait to try again!

My family has been making "Brigadeiro" forever!  Always a hit at birthday parties.  The trick is to use Nestle Quick powder.  It melts smoothly and adds the perfect amount of sweetness (a bit like a tootsie roll).  Also, when you take out of the pan, cool on a glass plate and just pull and form into balls from there.  I roll them into a ball, then in chocolate sprinkles and place into miniture wrappers (like tiny cupcake/muffin liners) then guests can pick one up and pop into their mouths!

I have to agree with some of the other posts that these kindof taste like tootsie rolls, but I loved them.  I dipped them in powdered sugar.  They were a family hit.

These were good but way too sweet!!  I dipped mine in walnuts as well as sugar and favored the walnut by far!  Dont think I'll be making these again, too sweet for my tastes.

This was so simple, and had a great creamy texture. It is not a over-powering chocolate flavor, but is still amazing. I think I will increase the cocoa next time, just for that strong cocoa flavor. But that is just personal preference. Great recipe. DO use a heavy pan. It really makes a difference in the way it cooks.

I made the recipe exactly as is.  It does need something sweeter, I'll try the Nesquick instead of cocoa powder next time.  I did roll these tootsie rolls in extra toppings I had on hand.  The toffee bits were a hit, as was the shredded coconut.  They added a fun texture.  My kids liked the mini m&ms on the brigadeiro but I don't think it added anything amazing except maybe color.  The powdered sugar covered ones were eaten last, I wouldn't do that again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Just to clarify--these worked out great the SECOND time we tried the recipe.  It definately took much longer to cook than the recipe states.  I doubled the recipe (my son had a social studies project for 80 people) and turned up the heat just a bit to a low medium.  It took about 20 minutes to reach the "dough" stage which someone had described as being able to turn the pan over without anything coming out.  I also used latex gloves sprayed with Pam to roll which worked out beautifully.

I loved this recipe. Instead of condensed milk I used cream so the final product was bitter and not sweet at all which is what I love. My family however likes it sweeter so I rolled the balls in powdered sugar. Amazing!

These were very good, I would have to disagree however that it tastes like expensive chocolate. It's more like a tootsie roll (which is still good for a candy) I added a little bit of caramel extract and they were awesome, everyone has loved them! I rolled some in nesquik powder and wrapped the rest in wax paper. They aren't going to last me until Christmas! I'll make another batch by then I'm sure.

Mmmmm, perfect! I agree  with a previous review that claimed these reminded them of tootsie rolls--in fact, that was the shape i made them into, because it's the easiest way to eat them. I think you can make this into any shape you want, and roll it in anything--i put cocoa powder over mine, and i have them stored in the fridge. I had absolutely no problem forming them into shapes, they only needed to be chilled in the freezer for an hour or so? Very yummy taste; i added walnuts, and it kinda reminds me of a brownie flavor ^_^ I will definitely make this again! BE CAREFUL NOT TO TOUCH IT RIGHT AFTER YOU COOK IT!! i accidentally did this, and i now have a bad burn on my finger! It's really hot, so be careful; cool it alllll the way! This was even low on guilt for me, because i had fat free sweetened condensed milk on hand!!! Such a strong chocolate flavor with so little cocoa powder is amazing! Thank you so much for this recipe!!

While the recipe ended being too gooey to roll, it was just too good, so I ate it with a spoon.  Very yummy.  Next time, I'm going to try the powdered sugar and longer chill time.  Awesome recipe all the same.

Can you say tootsie rolls?  That is exactly what these taste and look like.  Same consistency and everything.  Pretty good but I think I will roll them in coconut, sprinkles and the other things that previous readers have suggested just for fun.

Quick and easy.  I rolled some of them in powdered sugar, some in cocoa, and some in coconut.  I sis not care for the taste when they were first made and thought they tasted much better after being refrigerated for several hours.

These are perfect for emergency chocolate moments!  They are quick and easy.  I added a little powered sugar and vanilla to it.  However, these are really only for those who REALLY like chocolate.  If you only sorta like chocolate, find another recipe.

VERY delicious!  However, I tried it first in the microwave and it cooled to a ROCK, so adjust that time and watch for thickening if you must do it that way.  Luckily I had made just a half batch (afraid of eating it all myself! ;) ) and so I made it again on the stovetop and it was wonderful.  The kids called them tootsie roll balls.

I made this and it didn't turn out well at all.  Even though I followed the recipe exactly. It was very gooey and didn't hold together well enough to roll into balls.  It was very sweet almost to much so to eat. I'm glad it only had a few indg. so there wasn't much waste.  I will not make this again.

My husband is Brazilian, and these are his favorite candies!  We've been making this recipe for years, I'm glad someone put it on this website.  The only thing we do differently is we put about 3 tablespoons butter in them and roll them in sprinkles.  They must also be kept cool, or they will loose their shape.

I had a lot of the same problems that everyone else had.  I cooked it until I thought it was thick enough then let it cool for a long time -- and it still was extremely sticky and gooey.  I ended up pretty much plopping globs of it onto a piece of wax paper on a plate then sticking it in the refrigerator.  After a while I pulled it out and rolled each glob into a ball as best I could.  I've got it in the refrigerator now in a container.  It's okay but not great.  I doubt I'd make it again despite it's ease.

This recipe would better be called "glob!"  The taste was good, but think more along the lines of the consistency of peanut butter.  I had to drop spoonfuls in coconut or powdered sugar and roll them around in that to make it where they could even be handled.  When I put them on a platter they flattened into patties, even though I followed the recipe to a T!  They taste was fine, but I wouldnt take them to any type of gathering!

This is one of my favorite desserts and  this was my first time  trying to make them. I must say that while it does taste amazing mine turned out  like rocks. You could break a nokia  with them. I think I may have over cooked them.

A sweet, delicious treat. Made these for a celebration. Followed the recipe as stated, using slightly buttered hands to prevent sticking. Rolled these in finely chopped walnuts, colored sprinkles and chocolate jimmies. Very pretty combination of colors in the tin! Thank you!

I made a huge batch and gave a ton to my Brazilian friend who said they tasted almost exactly like what he had back home. I'd die for these, they're so good. 100/10 would reccomend!

I made two changes. 1. Put in the fridge right away. It got cold enough that I didn’t need to butter my hands. Made them the size of large cherry tomatoes and rolled them in crushed nuts and others were rolled in coconut or just plain. 2. Saw another recipe that called for Nesquick. Half cocoa powder half Nesquick. Meh, not as rich.

Made a few changes based on comments

Instead of 3 tbs of cocoa I did 2tbs cocoa and 1tbs of nesquick. Also at the end I added 1 tsp of vanilla extract. 

Definitely recommend letting them cool (I put in the fridge) and then get ready to coat your hands in non stick spray or butter because these are sticky! rolled in sprinkles, crushed pecans and coconut for varied flavor profiles. 

It did take longer then 10 minutes to get the consistency, was closer to 15-20, think a thick brownie batter consistency.

I have never tasted a Brigadeiro, but I just made these for the first time. One reviewer compared them to cooled hot fudge sauce, and I agree with that. There are definitely similarities there. I followed the tips left by the first two reviewers, and was very glad to have them. These things turned out soft and shiny, and look nice rolled in real chocolate "jimmies". I think our US fudge is better, though.

Very easy and a quick dessert to make, which can satisfy anyone with a chocolate craving. The only complaint I have is I wish these could harden easily and didn't have a fudge brownie/batter consistency.

It was good. I made this with a group for a class and they said to make the balls bigger. They also said to add less cocoa powder. We served with whipped cream.

I was taught this exact recipe by my au pair who is from Brazil.  She visited the US for a year and went home. Truly authentic.  She made this for us regularly. It’s  a totally unique flavor I think but they’re amazing!!

Super simple and yummy.  It's a bit hard to know when to stop cooking - lots of constant stirring.  Chocolate sprinkles make them easier to handle.

I like them best cold. I used dark chocolate cocoa powder. Rolled them in chopped pecans -good, powdered sugar - ok, added a little spice smoked chili to the mix and then rolled one side is the chile  (Mekur-not ground like chile powder) - Excellent! Makes quite a mess for only 3 ingredients!

I made these for an international foods day in my son's class.  While they were a bit overly sweet for me, the kids loved them.  I made a double recipe and stirred over low to medium heat for just under 30 minutes.  It takes patience - but I knew when it was ready because it started to bubble a bit and pull off the sides of the pot.  I then put it in a greased bowl (I used cooking spray) to cool in the refrigerator overnight.  In the morning I sprayed my hands and a melon baller with cooking spray, and started scooping it out and rolling it into balls and then in chocolate sprinkles.  Do NOT skip greasing your hands - it makes a huge difference!  I placed each one in a tiny muffin liner to keep them separate, and stored them in the refrigerator.

I'm not very picky about eating anything chocolate, but this stuff was inedible!  I used high quality ingredients and followed the Most Helpful suggestions, and it was still absolutely awful.  I was okay with the gooey stickiness, but it tasted like a soft Tootsie Roll made with milk that had gone bad. (The sweetened condensed milk I used was fresh and tasted fine.)  I don't understand the positive reviews at all - and I REALLY don't get the review where the cook said this tasted like Godiva chocolates.  Huh?!

They tasted great and anything can be rolled into them afterwords. For the people having trouble forming them, let them cool so it is a little bit hot. Then stir them again until so the bottom of the pan isn't covered. Let cool until a little bit warm and use two spoons to shape them into ball shapes.

I followed others advice who said to cook until the "dough" slid on the bottom of the pan and you could see the bottom of the pan when stirred. I think I may have waited too long to take it off the stove though. Are these candies supposed to taste like a tootsie roll? One other reviewer said hers tasted like chocolate truffles from Godiva. I'm thinking she made something else entirely or only cooked hers for half the time. Mine was super chewy and stuck to my teeth and afterward I felt like I needed to go to the dentist. My kids liked them at least and I guess that was the point. We made them for an Olympic Opening Ceremonies viewing party and I was hoping the adults would like them too, but no such luck. Next time I will probably stick to Godiva chocolate truffles.

To me it wasnt sweet enough and they looked a dark biege not chocolate. I made them from this recipe by memory & brought to a boil. Thats where I think I went wrong.

They were edible but not chocolate tasting.

These seemed more sophisticated than they are. They are just chocolate caramels, not bonbons. Maybe more for children than adults, but nonetheless like them. Wouldnt eat more than a few because its like candy to me.

It didn't harden so I could roll them, very sticky, would not keep shape.  Tasted great, just couldn't shape them.

I will make this again, as it's a big hit with the kids, but for me it's pretty messy and a bit too sweet.  Next time I'll use either more condensed milk or less cocoa.

I don't know that it's fair to rate the recipe low when I suspect that brigadeiro just isn't my thing. We tend to like the tastes were are accustomed to, and I found myself wanting it to be sweeter, more like a truffle or fudge. I made it according to the recipe and cooked w/ near constant stirring until the batter plopped as a cohesive unit to one side of the pot upon tilting, then transferred to a bowl to cool. I didn't care for the taste, so I added sifted powdered sugar, vanilla and butter extracts and liked it better, but I still didn't love it. Had some trouble getting it into balls when still slightly warm, but I let it cool to room temp and then had no trouble with it. Good but not great.

it's really ready in breeze and it's quite good. I also experienced the problem of the stickyness as mentioned by others, but it didn't bother me so much. I just washed my hands often, is all: I prefer that to greaseing my hands. My decoration was pink and lilac and white tiny hearts, as it was my daughter's party.

I followed other reviews and these turned out perfect for my son's class. They were studying Brazil and we were looking for a recipes to bring into class. My 12 year old did these by himself with little help from mom. We rolled in the traditional chocolate sprinkles, confectioners sugar, and coconut. Big hit with the family and the class!

I've made this recipe three times now.  I've used some of the following comments to help out with knowing when the little balls of chocolaty goodness are done and I think the most helpful hint of them all is to tip the pan over while your cooking and if the "dough" seems to pull away from the sides and try to keep itself in a blob than rather be drippy, than you know it'd ready.  Also, I wouldn't suggest putting it in the fridge to cool the dough, that's what you do after you roll the balls up, if you do it for too long too early you will be sorrrrrrrry!

Very yummy.  This is the first time making these little balls of heaven:)  I only had powered sugar and colored sprinkles on hand, but I have big plans for these little treats.  I plan on rolling in cashews, oreos, and sea salt...not all at once:)  I did use on packet of hot chocolate rather then cocoa.  I am a little bummed to hear that if they are not kept cool, they will "melt" Doubtful that I will have to worry about that this time.

These were delicious - followed some other suggestions and used Nesquik and mixed with the cocoa. The only issue I had is that they are extremely sticky to roll even when cold. Any suggestions on that would be helpful.

Great recipe and very simple to make!  I used a small spoon to scoop out before forming the balls, and it yielded less than 20.  I decorated mine with: coconut, brown sugar, powdered sugar, sprinkles, and diced walnuts.

I followed the suggestions.  I didn't have any Nesquick, so I added a package of hot chocolate mix.  I sprayed my hands with cooking spray before forming into balls.  I also read that I should dip the balls into cocoa.  That was a bad idea.  Baking cocoa was too strong and sharp.  I just kneaded the cocoa into the rest of the candy.  Then, it was good.

I had a major chocolate craving and I was out of chocolate chips and sugar! I used an ancient can of sweetened condensed milk and this solved my chocolate craving! I burn everything or I get the sticky fudge problem, but I stirred constanstly on low heat for ten minutes, plus two minutes more as one reviewer suggested. Then I let the mixture cool in frig for ten minutes. Mixing into balls was easy. I rolled my in walnuts. I gave this 5 stars cause it is high in calcium, has a little protein, and is quick and Cheap to make. However, this tastes exactly  like Chocolate carmel to me, but maybe that is what it is supposed to taste like?

These are pretty good. They're not GREAT, but they're definitely good. I only had a 300ml can of condensed milk, so I used that instead of a full 14 ounces. I took the suggestions of others and cooked it 2 minutes past when it came away from the pot. I also substituted one tablespoon of cocoa for one tablespoon of hot cocoa mix. After it was done cooking, I threw the pot in the fridge for an hour. The mixture was firm, but soft enough to work with. I rolled the balls in sprinkles. In my opinion, the sprinkles take away from the chocolate, so next time I will probably use a different topping.

I would give 4,5 stars. I had no problems with it. I stired it approximately 15 minutes. Then I refrigerated it one hour. The flavor was pleasant and rich. I decorated it with coconut flakes and cocoa.

I made this for "International Day" at my daughters grade school.  I used Nesquick and then rolled one batch in sprinkles, one batch in nesquick and one batch in chocolate/french vanilla hot cocoa mix.  My least favorite was the ones rolled in sprinkles.  Overall, very easy, did not take too long to roll up as my 6yr old rolled in toppings after I rolled from pan.  Will definitely make again.  Was afraid to use low or non-fat milk or margarine though as didn't know if they'd turn out as well.  Has anyone else tried that?

Mine is cooling off at the moment, and from the little nibbles I've had, it's very good.
I was worried about the forming stage, but seeing as it's already plenty thick, I think I'll be fine. I'm not too sure as to why, but mine was ready in seven minutes on medium heat. Maybe it's the non-fat condensed milk?
Anyways, can't wait to taste the final product.

This is a wonderful recipe, a bit hit with my family. I rolled half in coconut and the other half in cocoa powder.
Easy, easy, easy and quick!

I cooked 5 minutes longer than what the recipe stated and ended up having to put it in the freezer to try to set it up. It did help, but it was still sticky and a pain to work with.  Rolled in crushed nuts and tasted good, but doubt I will make again because it was a lot of trouble.  Taste was a 4, easiness was a 2 so I'll give it a 3.

I made the mistake of using fat-free condensed milk, so the mixture did not thicken enough. When I tried to make the balls they just wouldn't hold their shape, but they were really tasty. They were a great fudgey topping on my ice cream, though!!!

This recipe is easy to make cant go wrong on getting it right. Slight variation i would suggest would be to have some caramel in the middle right before forming the balls or dip ball in caramel/butterscotch then coconut

I had a hard time getting it to set, but it still had a good flavor. I did find that dusting my hands with powdered sugar helped keep it from sticking to my hands. I do have to say that not one piece was left!

This is delicious!! It's a hit with the whole family. I cooked it on low heat for about 25 minutes, then rolled the balls in chocolate sprinkles, powdered sugar, and crystal sugar.

Very easy recipe. Make sure you cook this long enough. The recipe calls for 10-12 minutes. However, I cooked it 15 minutes. I have a gas stove - maybe that is why I had to cook it longer.  My daughter did a project on Brazil and we made this candy for everyone to eat. Everyone loved it!

I'm with the others, it tastes really good, but really horrible to work with and it ends up all mushing together if you put it in the same container.  I'll try some of the suggestions; I have to keep making it because my mechanic loves it and if I take him some he always gives me good deals!

This stuff tastes really good, but I couldn't get it to form balls.  I spread mine over sugar cookies and topped with various things like coconut, nuts, and powdered sugar.

This recipe was okay. It was very quick and easy, but I didn't like it because it had a lot of condensed milk in it and it was very evident that it did. Do not make this if you don't like condensed milk.

The recipe is simple, is fast, and has a good taste...but needs more details.  You do not know when to stop cooking it.  I cooked it until it seemed to be as thick as I could get it without burning, and it still came out gooey.  I could not form it into balls.  I had to spoon it onto buttered wax paper.  It never set like a bon-bon.  On a pleasent note, the taste was good!
