WOW, this salad is "da bomb"!  Made it exactly as written except for using smoked turkey instead of ham.  Definitely a keeper and new favorite!  Thanks, Bea!

I can't believe this recipe has been around since, at least, 2004 w/only 2 reviews.  I'm assuming the name may have something to do w/it, since it sounds like a fruit salad of some sort.  This was a nice change of pace salad. I used romaine, red leaf, and baby spinach for my greens, as well as the (frozen) snow peas, ham, strawberries and (cheddar; it's what I had on hand) cheese.  I don't use artificial sweetener, so I used 2 tsp of real sugar in the dressing and subbed EVOO for canola oil.  I really enjoyed the crisp dressing w/a subtle raspberry undertone.  I added some roasted sunflower seeds to my salad and I think that made all of the difference in the world.  It adds a nice texture and saltiness to the salad.  I, personally, didn't care for the strawberries, but really dug the ham.  THANKS for the recipe, Bea!
