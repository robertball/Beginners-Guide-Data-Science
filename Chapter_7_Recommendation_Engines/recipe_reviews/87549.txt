By adding the oysters with their juice to the butter mixture in the pan you do not have to deal with a double boiler.  Simply simmer the oysters until the edges just begin to curl; add the milk and heat through while keeping a close watch as not to boil.  I tried a tiny bowl with a touch of sherry and didn't care for it so left it out of the remainder.  I did add about 1/2 teaspoon of celery seed along with the other seasonings.

My father in law has always made Oyster stew for my family on special occasions.  This valentines I wanted to make something special and my 10 year old requested Papa's Oyster stew.  This was the recipe I chose and it was a good one.  Papa does not add the pepper but we did and enjoyed it.

Simple easy and fast. I didn't have sherry wine. I took three oysters and put them in blender, blended them very fine and added them to the milk for a strong oyster taste. I didn't like to use  two pots for this soup. My husband didn't mind washing an extra pot since he loved the soup.

I made a double batch of this for me and a friend (we ate the soup as the main course).  It was great!  My mom makes oyster stew as well, but its a bit different than this.... I made THIS recipe and it was delicious!  Thanks.

I'm not an oyster fan but my husband is.  Not sure why this turned kinda gray as you can see by my picture.  He said the flavor was right on but it looked so unappetizing.  Thanks for the recipe though, it sure was easy and fast.

I revised using Heavy Cream and I have to admit the Sherry Sparked this into the Memories of all on Christmas Eve Night!  Sister hated Oysters and she really loved this, and you know that was all I needed for thanks.  Going to repeat this for Christmas 2011 too!

Very yummy. I doubled the recipe because I had a lot of oysters but the recipe still turned out very yummy. I think I might try white wine next time but even with the sherry, it was delicious!

This is as close as I can get to my mom's oyster Christmas stew and I'll be making it for 10 again this year.  It's awesome.  The only thing I won't have is the celery this year, but it comes out so sweet and rich.  ...and I add a few more oysters cuz we're pigs  :)

We made this oyster stew recipe. I thought it was similar to the one from my childhood. It was not. Do not add sherry to this recipe. It will cause the stew to curdle. It was inedible. And sad.

I added almost a pint of half and half and only 1/8 cup sherry. Hubby wanted more liquid. Once I added more half n half, I added more salt and pepper. I used Ghee to cook oysters in before adding liquid, instead of butter. Added some chopped green onion for color. It was delicious and easy. Will make again!

It was ok, I just didn't find it very flavorful compared to the recipe I grew up with.  It also started separating on me even though I didn't bring it to a boil and I added the juice from the oysters.  I did like the bit of garlic and sherry that was added though.  I'll just stick to milk next time.
