This is a good oatmeal cake but it wasn't what I expected in a bar.  It was runny and not the consistancy to "pat" in the pan. I also had to bake it for 40 minutes instead of 15.

These are AWESOME! I LOVED THEM! They were sweet and chewy. You can substitute the cereal with anything you like. I used raisins and they come out perfectly good. Just FOLLOW the instructions and maybe cook for an extra 15 min., but the overall product was EXCELLENT!

This recipe was super yummy... especially if you're a person who enjoys a chewy breakfast bar.    I added an extra 1/2 cup each of crushed almonds and raisins and used my favorite cereal instead of the one listed and it turned out pretty good!
