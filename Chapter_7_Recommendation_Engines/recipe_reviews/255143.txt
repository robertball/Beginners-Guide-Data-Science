I made this for my family and it was delicious! I skipped the lemon zest and added the lemon extract. If I left the lemon extract out it would have been better. I am excited to experiment with other fruits. I have already tried grapefruit and it came out beautifully. I plan to make a watermelon one and I hope it will be as good as the others. This technique is very easy and I would reccommend it to anyone. A great recipe to try with kids!

My Mom used to make lemon "sherbet" like this when I was little.  I remember she poured it into a metal ice cube tray to freeze after she took out the cube dividers.  It was always one of my favorite desserts. (I DON'T remember her taking it out and stirring it frequently, tho')

I modified this recipe slightly. I poured fresh lemonade into a plastic pitcher and put it in the freezer, stirring occasionally as it began to freeze. It made an entire gallon without all the fru-fru fuss. Step one: pour; step two: place in freezer; step three: stir...voila! Chef Gregg at your service.

Very delicious. It took a very long time for it to freeze, but it was totally worth it for the tart, and refreshing dessert.

OMG! I loved this lemon ice. Easy to make, absolutely delicious and refreshing. I had no lemon extract, but the ice was yummy without it.  I will definitely be making this again. No more store bought ice for me

Delicious taste. First I didnâ€™t strain the zest out and it was a little to much; so next time I did and it was perfecto!!
