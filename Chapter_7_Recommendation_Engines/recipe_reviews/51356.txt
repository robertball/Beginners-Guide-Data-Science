Another comment says this is in no way like real sukiyaki.  True, but I still find it a better approximation than what usually passes for sukiyaki in the US.  What I found interesting is the comment that it is for people who don't like tofu or seaweed.  Real sukiyaki never contains seaweed.

This was alright in that the soya+beef broth+sake (white wine for me) approximated sukiyaki flavour.  I'm not overly thrilled by it, but it's not a bad flavour to make your vegetables.

This dish is really tasty!  Since I didn't have any noodles on hand, I served this alongside some rice and there were no complaints at the table.  Next time, I think I'll throw in a little bit of garlic, just to play around with the recipe a bit.  It's actually a very versatile recipe and you can add just about anything you'd like, according to personal preference. We really really enjoyed this as is though.  Thanks!

I have yet to see a "real" sukiyaki recipe.  Given that, this is just fine!!  We will make again.  Thank you.

This was extremely bland and soupy, and I added 2 garlic cloves as well as tomatoes for extra flavor. Absolutely no 'asian' taste at all, just beef and spinach soup. I won't make this again.

Tried this last night. I've had authentic Suikiyaki and this isn't it, but it isn't bad. I don't know if it is the soy sauce and the Sake, but it smelled right when I was cooking it.
