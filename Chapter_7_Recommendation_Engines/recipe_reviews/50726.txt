OK, so maybe I am merely a novice in the kitchen, but here I am preparing this dish (it's marinating as we speak) and my hands start burning.  How was I supposed to know not to touch the pepper with my hands?  Apparently (now that I have researched the Habenero peppers online) you are not supposed to touch these peppers with your bare hands (i.e., you are supposed to wear rubber gloves) and you must wash the cutting board and knives to prevent the spreading of this capsaicin in the pepper which can burn your skin upon contact. I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE RECIPE DIRECTIONS!!  Some sort of 'handling instructions or warning' and what to do if you happen to come into contact with this capsaicin.

I am so disappointed, I am ready to dump the dish and start something else for dinner.

If you haven't eaten jerk chicken this is a good recipe but there are better ones out there.  The ones I've used have these ingrediants and a lot more, like orange juice, white wine vingar in addition to the red wine, scallions, ginger, etc.  If you like this recipe, then look around for others and sample the differences.  Once you come up with a great jerk sauce, you can use it on chicken, beef, pork, etc.

This didn't turn out for me.  It didn't look anything like the picture either.  Although my husband and son liked it, I didn't care much for it.  I may try again, but grill instead of broil.  **Update to my first review.  I am now giving this 5 stars.  I made some mistakes the first time I made this, so when its prepared correct it's delicious.  The one thing I keep forgetting to do is hold out part of the marinade to pour over after cooking, but even without it the flavor is great.  We also grilled it this time instead of broiling and it is definitely better cooked on the grill.

Great!  A little hot (I will only use a small or 1/2 pepper next time) but very good.  I let it marinade for 1 hour and served it with white rice.

I will make this again!

I thought this recipe was absolutely terrific!  I used chicken thighs instead of breasts and baked at 475 for about 40 minutes turning once and left the marinade in the pan so the chicken wouldn't stick to the bottom.  The only thing is I didn't think it was spicy enough with the one habanero for it to be true spicy jerk.  Next time I'll use to peppers instead of the one.  Thanks so much for this recipe, it's a great one.

So this isn't a "traditional" jerk- WHO CARES!!! It's wonderful! I just made this tonight, and my husband wants it again tomorrow night with shrimp instead of chicken! I used onion powder and dried thyme because it was easy, and went for a whole habenero. Now I like spicy, but habeneros scare me. I de-seed completely (WITH GLOVES!) and left a little of the menbrane. It was  just spicy enough, and my husband who likes super spicy was fulfilled with the reserve sauce to kick up the heat. Our seven year old devoured it- spicy side sauce and all. The sweet is fairly subtle, and the spice creeps up slowly. Very Good. We will make this a regular. Thank you.

Yummy, yummy in our tummies!  This was great, and very easy.  If you can't take the heat, I suggest cutting the habanero pepper in 1/4 or 1/2, but even our youngest loved this chicken.  Also, we cooked our chicken outside on the grill - yummy!  :)

Recently returned from a trip to Jamaica, this was just the thing to take our tastebuds back!  Not TOO hot, a little bit sweet - a perfect blend of spices and flavors.  I served it over long grain chicken-flavored rice, with a cold Red Stripe!  Excellent!!

I made this recipe exactly as given.  It was excellent.  There was definitely some heat, but not too much so to make inedible.  If I were to change anything....I might save more marinade for the sauce, but that's only because I ate this with rice and the sauce would be nice to use on the rice.

Good recipe, but I looked at the previous ratings before I made it and decided to go with only half a habanero pepper instead of a whole one.  That turned out to be a good idea and even though the meal was enjoyed, I was asked to cut the pepper down to a "half of a half" for the next time I make it.  Good recipe, would definitely make it again, but be sure you like spicy food before you put the pepper in and MAKE SURE YOU PROTECT YOUR HANDS WHEN HANDLING THE HABANERO.  If you get caught without any gloves you can use, at least put a baggie over each hand so you're not touching it with your bare skin.

I made this for my daughter's birthday party and it was a big hit.  I followed the recipe to a T, except I used two habanero peppers and 4 cloves of garlic...to kick it up a notch.  One warning--it is a total must to use gloves when handling habanero peppers.  My fingers and nails were burning for an entire day!  (Boy have I learned my lesson in not under estimating the powerfulness of these tiny things.)

This was absolutely delicious. I heeded the warnings about the heat of the Habenero peppers and used Serrano instead. That made it just right. Spicy, sweet, and fiery: I will definitely make this again.

This is one of my boyfriend and I's favorite recipes. I recommend making extra sauce. DO NOT forget to keep some aside to pour on after its been broiled! This isn't jerk chicken, but it is delicious. Its spicy and the chicken comes out very juicy. Try it with turkey too!

Easy and super tasty.  I used a jalapeno instead of habanero, so it wasn't too spicy.  We also grilled the chicken.  Next time we are going to add a little cashews or peanuts and cilantro and make chicken lettuce wraps.

I doubled the marinade - used 1/2 to marinate the chicken overnight and heated up the other 1/2 to put over stir fry vegetables and chicken.  Served over rice.  Excellent flavor!

This was a HUGE hit in my house!  I didnt broil it, I simply put it in the oven for about 30 min, and then turned on the broier for about 10 min.  I thought it has PLENTY of heat, however my husband says it needs 2 habeneros!

Even though I didn't have time to marinate the chicken, it came out delicious.  I used chicken tenders (2-1/2 lbs.) and only had to broil them a few minutes on each side.  I broiled them with all of the sauce.  This one is a keeper!!

Advice!!  I made this recipe for dinner and my whole family loved it! I had the chicken marinade for four hours. It was alittle dry so i dipped it in the left over heated marinade. I did not use the habanero pepper, but it turned out perfect. I served it with rice and brocoli. *Next time though I think I will make more of the marinade so I have enough to pour on top of the chiken once done!!* This recipe is defenitly a keeper!! * One other thing I only cooked it for 10 minute total, I cooked one side for 5minute then turned them over na dcooked the other side for another ten minutes!!* But in all it was great!!

This was awesome! I didn't deviate from the recipe at all. If I had a complaint (which I don't), it would only be that this is pretty hard to use as the main dish. It wasn't too spicy at all (it was perfect) but it's too spicy to eat a full chicken breast worth. My solution would be to make extra sides to fill up on, or even have it as an appetizer. All in all: Great!

Also: Wear gloves! The most helpful review on here is a one star about the pepper burning her hands. That just goes to show how helpful reviews are!

Finally, if you're worried about this being too spicy for your taste, don't make it for a meal. First make it in a small amount. If you think it's too spicy give it away. I'm proof that there are people out there that like it exactly as the recipe prepares it. The next time, adjust the habenaro to your spicy liking and enjoy!

***Edit*** I've made this many times now and still love it as is, but doubling the recipe for the sauce. FYI there is a major difference in spicyness when you use fresh peppers as opposed to canned or jarred. Fresh peppers will be LESS spicy.

Yummy! And very spicy. I used a couple small peppers for a serving for two (at least what the grocer told me were habanero peppers), and that left quite a kick. The only change I made was to broil the chicken with the marinade, just because I find it tends to make the chicken much more tender, and you don't have to worry as much about saving enough marinade at the end.

OK this was really excellent.  I am pleased.  I made some substitutions out of need, but it negligible.  I think the real secret was to let it marinate overnight.  The sauce had penetrated every micrometer of the chicken.  It was bursting with flavor.  I will definitely make this again.

This was really good and simple. I followed the directions and the result was great. Why do you all change the directions/ingredients, then complain? you aren't even following the recipe!

This recipe is perfect the way it is.  I've even used it with turkey and it was still very juicy and tender.  The spice and taste are awesome and my boyfriend loves it!  Thanks for this great recipe, it's a keeper!

I've never cooked with habanero before and i was afraid it would be too hot so i removed all the seeds and ribs.  It turned out to be very mild.  Next time I will be a little more bold and leave all the hot stuff in!  I thought the meat turned out a little dry so I will leave the chicken breasts whole while they marinate and cook, and slice  them after giving them a chance to rest.

I used two Serrano peppers and the family loved the spices, even the little ones.  I used the recipe for 8 and it was just enough, if I had eight adults I would have not had enough.  I also used Serrano peppers as a garnish.

This was great! The only thing I changed was added a bit more garlic and onion. The one habanero adds a great kick! Was afraid it would be too sweet with all the brown sugar, it was perfectly balanced and added a GREAT caramelization. Oh, and I did keep the chicken breasts whole, since we had it with veggies instead of rice. Can't wait to make it again!

This recipe was really unique and my husband who orders anything "jerk" was a fan!  I used hot chili oil instead of sesame and I think just a green pepper for the habanero.  Yum, yum :)

This was just DELICIOUS!!  I had to make one substitution because I thought I had soy sauce on hand, but didn't.  Instead, I used oyster sauce.  Served with some boiled baby red potatoes tossed with olive oil, white wine vinegar and minced fresh mint, and a side salad.  Great meal!  Thanks so much!!!

This was fabulous, simply put.  The only change I made was using 2 habanero peppers instead of one.  I marinated the chicken for a little over 2 hours.  Boy, is this spicy.  Not the "gag me I want to puke" spicy, but the "this is spicy delicious" spicy.  I see some people comparing this to "Jays Jerk Chicken", also on this site.  I have tried both.  They are very different recipes, neither better nor worse than the other.  Jays Jerk Chicken is a much sweeter recipe, not as firey.  This isn't very sweet, but boy is it hot.  So, however your tastes are, pick the recipe that you and your family would like best.  My husband says he slightly prefers A Jerky Chicken.  I can't decide, but I couldn't eat A Jerky Chicken on a consistent basis unless I bought stock in Pepcid!

This is one of my go-to recipes. I always add more veggies, usually 1/2 an onion and a head of broccoli and serve over brown rice = delicious. I used two habeneros the last time I made it and it was spicy like WOAH. But still tasty. Powdered thyme works just fine too.

Awesome recipe, especially when paired with a bed of white rice.  Someone rated this poorly because they mishandled the habanero peppers and felt it should have said something in the recipe about not touching with bare hands...yeah and maybe we should tell you not to rub onions in your eyes, or maybe we should tell you not to cross contaminate raw chicken?  Give me a break this recipe is terrific!

This chicken is ideal in burritos.  Combine with a little rice, black beans, monterey jack and mango salsa, and you have a heavenly meal.

My, oh my was this good.  I doubled the marinade and did half on chicken pieces and half on slices of portabello mushrooms.  Both were fabulous.  There wasn't much marinade left over to use as a dip so I mixed in an equal amount of plain yogurt--soooooooooooooooo good! I highly recommend that you try this for a dip.  It would be good on anything!

I'll admit:  I've never tried "jerk" anything, so I don't have anything to compare this to, but I thought this chicken was delicious.  Spicy, but not too hot (I'll probably go a bit hotter next time, and so tasty!  Everyone loved it.  I was a bit concerned that, because my broiler cooks so hot, my chicken would burn on the outside and not cook through, so I baked it in the oven at 350 for about 10 minutes, and then broiled each side for 5 minutes - PERFECT!  Thanks!

this chicken was so good i made double the sauce because what the recipe called for didn't look enough for me. i added 2 hobaneros instead of one because we like things hot. it's not that hot with one because of the brown sugar it calms the heat and makes it really sweet. it was the perfect balance of sweet and hot. i will def be making this again.

I loved it.  I doubled the chicken so I tripled the marinade....i wish i had quadrupled it. i let it marinade all day. I used serrano peppers and there wasn't a bit of spiciness to it.  I lined a shallow pan with tin foil laid the chicken in a single layer and then poured most of the marindae it was soaking in on top so it cooked in its own sauce.  Then i poured the rest of the reserved over the top after it was done cooking.  It was tender and juicy and delicious and me and the kids gobbled it up.  My husband hated it and refused to eat it so i probably won't make again....what a shame.

Easy recipe to follow.  I cut the chicken in too small of strips and it dried it out too much (my mistake).  The flavour was excellent...like others suggested, I doubled the marinate so that we could use the extra as a sauce (I used 1 pepper in total-seeds and membranes removed).

If I could more than 5 stars I would!  I love jerk chicken, so I was so excited to find a recipe for it.  I was wrorried making it, but I was so happy with the results.  *Note- I used pre-breaded chicken strips and it worked fine.  The only thing was, and I don't know maybe it was just my broiler, or that the recipe has sugar in it, or that it was pre-cooked/frozen chicken, but I only needed to cook myn for about 10 min.

Very good and easy.  I only marinated the chicken 1 1/2 hours and was surprised how flavorful it was.  My husband shredded the chicken, put it on top of a green salad and used the extra marinade as a dressing.  Will definately make this again.  Also,  I did not have a habanero pepper so I just used red pepper flakes.

This was really tasty! Made a couple of changes- used onion powder instead of onion and crushed red peppers instead of habanero pepper- mainated all day. The chicken was moist and juicy- perfect on the grill.

This was a good recipe, but it was more like a teriyaki chicken than a jerk chicken.

It wasn't that bad even though I didn't have all of the ingredients. I substituted the fresh thyme for parsley, the habanero pepper for ground pepper, and I didn't have any sesame oil or ground allspice. Plus I made my own red wine vinegar (I just mixed my sweet red wine w/reg. vinegar). So you really didn't need all of those ingredients to make a good, quick meal!!!!

Im really not sure why but I did not like this recipe at all.  The only reason I gave it two stars is b/c my husband liked it.  I followed the recipe to a T, but wasn't what I expected.

MODIFIED FOR LESS HEAT-- A PERFECT 5 FOR US!  My family can't take too much heat (like medium salsa is good for us), so I changed out the habenero for 1/2 of a serrano pepper (still used gloves), bumped the brown sugar up to 1/4 cup, and marinated in the fridge for a full 24 hours.  It was great, and will be AWESOME in wraps.  The sauce has a great heat + sweet kick this way, and I can't wait to use the leftovers tomorrow.  Thanks!

Note from the author: The recipe DOES NOT call for Jalapeno peppers. Jalapeno peppers have a distinct flavor and will affect the outcome of the recipe. You can find Habanero peppers in most stores in fresh produce and canned/jarred. In addition, Habanero peppers should be handled only with gloves so please be careful. I like to make double the recipe and reserve 1/2 for a dipping sauce.

This was a great recipe and the spicier the better! I make double the marinade to put on top of white rice with the chicken. I have made this recipe twice and love it. I served this at a dinner party and my friends enjoyed it very much!

This chicken was very good.  I used only half a pepper because I was afraid it would get too hot.  It did not!!!  I wished I had added more, I was looking forward to spicey and it wasn't.  I marinated it for 24 hours and put it on skewers and served it over salad.  Everyone loved it.  I had some chicken left in the marinade that I used after 2 days of marinating and it was even better. Enjoy!!

This is awesome!  The only modification I made was vegetable oil instead of sesame, and I doubled the sauce.  Next time I will triple the sauce....oh so good!  Oh and about that habernero (sp?) pepper...thank goodness I deseeded that baby because it would've been a little to much to take with more heat!  Thanks so much for sharing, this recipe is now in heavy rotation in my household.

Great!!! If spicy is not your thing, leave out the peppers and it becomes a sweet jerk, and still as great.

This chicken begs to be grilled! I love this recipe. This is one you'll want to add to your rotation of quick, healthy, easy recipes. I wasn't looking for a sweet marinade so I cut the sugar to 2 T. but I think 1 T. would have been just fine too. Anyway my hubby loved this....he paused mid meal and said "I think this is the best chicken I've ever eaten." works for me!

This recipe was terrific!  Cut the seeds out of the habenero to keep the flavor and mellow out the heat.  I only marinated for the min. hour and it was very flavorful.  i will make this one again.  thanks for sharing.

Though I wouldn't say this is what I think of as a true Caribbean jerk recipe, this recipe was great.  I had to make a few substitutions because of what I had on hand.  I substituted green onions for the onion, 1 tablespoon of worcestershire for a tablespoon of soy and added 1 clove of garlic.  I served it over plain white rice.  This was fantastic, but, be warned that it is VERY spicy if you do not deseed the habanero.  It doesn't say to do so on the recipe, so I didn't, because we do love spicy.  I am making this again as a marinade for wings for a party tomorrow and will make a batch with the deseeded habanero for those who may not be able to handle the heat.  A definite keeper recipe.

Let me start off by saying I have never had jerk chicken before, so I had no idea what this was supposed to taste like. All I know is it turned out to be very yummy chicken and both my husband and I loved it. The only change I made was to use a serrano pepper instead of a habanero because I knew the latter would make it way too spicy for us. I served it over brown rice.

I followed the recipe but used a jalapeno pepper instead of the habanero cause my super market was out. I didn't throw out the sauce that was in the bag I seasoned the chicken in, because I poured it in the glass tray with the chicken to broil. Then I turned the chicken over at 8 min. The chicken came out so nice and tender. I still made 1/3 the sauce on the stove to use as gravy. It was  a lovely dish.

This recipe was delicious! I cubed the chicken and added ground ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, orange and lime juice to the marinade. I also couldn't find a habanero, so had to use a serrano and added some chipotle puree that I had on hand. The chipotle added a really nice flavor to the mix along with some extra heat. After marinading for a few hours we skewered the meat and tossed it on the grill! My husband and I both really enjoyed this recipe - thanks!

This was yummy!  I used half as much chicken (there's only 2 of us) and half of a habanero, then I cut the chicken into strips and put it on skewers.  We grilled the chicken after it marinated overnight, and it turned out great!  We turned ours into a salad, and I used the leftover marinade (after boiling it) to make a vinaigrette with a little olive oil and balsamic vinegar, and that was our salad dressing!  We will definitely make this often- it was easy and full of flavor.

This is fantastic and SO easy! A single big habanero is just enough spice - use two if you want it very warm!  I was surprised to read the review from the woman whose hands were burning after cutting the pepper, but I guess it's all in what you're used to. We cook a lot of spicy food down here, and I've chopped up a dozen habaneros at a time before without getting even a finger tingle.  I'd never heard of anyone wearing rubber gloves before. :S

Great recipe! I used boneless, skinless breasts and thighs and bumped the sugar up by 1 Tbs (accidently.)  There were teens hovering around the kitchen as the chicken began to broil and not a single shred of leftovers.

This is awesome!  After reading the previous reviews of this one, I decided to use an entire hablano and double everything else, essentially cutting the heat in half.  It is still mildly spicy, so I can imagine the heat if I used a whole pepper.  I would've loved it, but I have children, so I'm glad I did this.  Also, refer to prior reviewer that didn't use gloves...use the plastic bag to handle and you should be just fine.  Those hablanos can bite ya!

This is our favorite recipe! We even started growing our own habaneros just to make this chicken. We like to throw in 3 or 4 habaneros to make it extra hot.

The whole family agrees, this is a keeper.  Just the right amount of spice and heat.  We grilled the chicken and it turned out perfectly. We've had Jamaican Jerk chicken in the past that, while it was very flavorful and tasty, it was as fire-breathing hot coming out as it was going in.  This recipe is perfect and it makes great leftovers when stored with the extra sauce.  Served it with grilled zucchini and yellow squash and brown rice with black beans, corn, cilantro and taco seasoning (taco seasoning was from this site called Taco Seasoning I).  All went perfectly together.

Just OK. Didnt taste like anything "jerk" I've ever had. Used a jalapeno instead of habanero, not hot enough. Forgot to save sauce for serving. Maybe thats why it was so blah.

I sort of made a cross between this recipe and "Jay's Jerk Chicken," also on this site.  I added freshly chopped ginger and lime juice.  I also broiled it for about 20 minutes because the chicken was still pink in the middle.  Can't wait to try it on the grill!  Take my suggestion and make more marinade so there is more sauce to drizzle over at the end.  See also: comments under Jay's Jerk Chicken.

Excellent dish. I am a fan of spicey foods so I doubled the amount of peppers...don't do this. It would have been plenty spicey with a single pepper.

Wow, this is great!  I'd never used habaneros before, so I left out about 3/4 of the seeds and membranes.  The result was a definite heat, but not TOO much -- next time we'll see if we can handle the whole pepper!  They have a great, unique flavor, try not to substitute other varieties.  Our only other change was using 1 tsp dried thyme instead of fresh, and grilling outside instead of broiling.  The result was fantastic!  The combination of hot & sweet was just right.  We only marinated for about 5 hours, might be even a better, deeper flavor if it was marinated overnight.  Highly recommended!

This was very good. My boyfriend, who doesn't really like chicken, said he would like me to make this again.  I didn't have a habanero, so I used a jalapeno and a Serrano.  It was perfect.

I cooked this on the skillet since I don't care for my oven's broiler, and used Tabasco instead of the pepper (I can't eat really spicy stuff).  Turned out really well, thanks!

A fairly simple dish, perfect for novice such as myself. Substitutions made: Rice Vinegar for Red Wine Vinegar Sesame Seeds and Canola oil for Sesame Oil Hot Pepper for Habanero  Keep an eye on it while you broil it. It can cook quickly.

I marinated the chicken for 4 hours, grilled it, and then tossed it with a green salad.  The flavor was good but not very strong. The extra sauce on the top of the chicken is really important if you really want to taste the marinate.

The flavor in this dish is great. The store was out of Habanero peppers, so I got a Jalapeno, and seeded and removed the membrane, since my wife does not like spicy food. Also used dried thyme instead of fresh. This will definitely be on the menu again soon.

Good flavor with just the right amount of spice.  I made the marinade for 4 breasts, but only had 2 big frozen breasts.  It is important that you reserve some sauce to put on the chicken afterwards. I laid the slices on a bed of creamy garlic chicken rice and it was just the mellow flavor to tone down the whole habenero that I used.

I used this marinade on shrimp and it was delicious.  I can handle a bit more spicy than most, and this was perfect.  I've had jerk in Central America, however, and this was just not as flavorful.

My husband and I liked this quite a bit.  We both felt it needed more heat, so I will double the pepper next time.  I adjusted the recipe for two people and there wasn't enough sauce to pour over at the end, so I will increase that next time too.  I just cooked mine in a skillet and added the marinade towards the end, just long enough to cook it and get it a bit thick and gooey.  It had a very teriyaki-like taste to me.  I've never had jerk chicken before, so I don't know if that's normal, but I think it would be great for beef too.

Had to use Sherry Vinegar, and a serrano in place of the habanero.  Loved the smell of the marinade, I think it would have been better if I had marinated longer than an hour...not crazy about the allspice.

I have made this twice in the last 2 weeks. I love it! It tastes even better the next day. I didn't use a habanero because they didn't have any plus I wasn;t sure if it would be too spicey for my kids, just used a serrano pepper but other than that...I followed the recipes exactly and even my kids love it. A keeper for sure.

If I could give this recipe 4.5 stars, I would. Overall, this recipe was a great recipe for jerk chicken. My only issue with it was the pepper. My husband and I love spicy food being that we are both from tropical regions but this was a bit TOO spicy for us. I recommend reducing the pepper to HALF of a pepper and I also recommend adding a few small pieces of tropical fruit, such as pineapple, kiwi, or mango to the marinade.

This was okay. I felt like it was missing something (not sure what)? I might try it again and tinker with the recipe a bit.

This is a delicious marinade.  Not a typical jerk chicken recipe, but it is well worth trying.  I chose to make this as part of an effort to cut back on calories lately.  A couple of notes:  I doubled the recipe, and the amount was just right.  There is also no need to pour any reserved marinade over the cooked meat.  The broiled meat was perfect without any additional sauce.  We actually used the extra marinade as a dipping sauce and decided the chicken was better without it.  Will definitely file this one away and make it again!

Maybe I did something wrong, I did use jalapenos because of earlier reviews.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and even marianated it for 5 hours.  This is not what I remember and was not spicy at all.  It was flavorful, but not Jery Chicken which is what I was looking for.

This recipe turned out great. I have traveled to jamaica and wanted to recreate jerk chicken. My only problem was that I couldn't get a habenero pepper. I used jalepenos instead, but it was not spicy enough for my taste.

Wish we could give this 4.5 stars.  It was very good, and very flavorful.  We cooked it on the grill instead of in the oven.

Pretty decent recipe. I couldn't find any habaneros at the grocery store so I substituted 2 table spoons of diced jalapeno's and they had some spice to them but not enough to compel you to grab the closest cold beverage!

My family only changed this recipe a bit, but I think the changes made a GREAT end product; everyone absolutely loved it! We doubled the entire sauce recipe except soy sauce (6 Tbsp), used only 1 habenaro, and used 1/2 of a small, yellow onion. Also, we added a couple chunks of frozen mango and about 6 Tbsp of orange juice to the sauce. Served with Red Beans and Rice and roasted cajun corn on the cob.

This was my first time making Jerk Chicken and it was absolutely delicious. I used chicken breast cut up and doubled the sauce. Although I didn’t have allspice I substituted with nutmeg, cinnamon and cloves.  I went to the store to pick up some real allspice this morning and going to make this wonderful dish again next week. Great with rice Yum

-It was weird but, it tasted 10x better cold!

Love it! It even worked well with mock, vegetarian chicken. I would double the amount of marinade, just because it is so delicious, so you will want lots of sauce.

One of the best chicken dishes I've ever made. If you like spicy food, this is it. I did not use the sesame oil to keep it low fat and it was still amazing.

This was excellent. I modified a few things. First off, I doubled all the ingredients so I could make extra sauce.  Instead of a tsp, I used a half of an onion, I pressed the garlic instead of chopping it, I substituted Tamari Sauce for the Soy Sauce, and I used four habaneros. Only use more than one habanero if you like very spicy foods. FYI, please use the orange or red habaneros.  My local grocery stores carry mostly green ones and you have to dig into the piles of peppers to find the correctly colored ones. Do not choose the peppers if they are soft. Another thing, I didn't drain the marinade.  I put everything into a tray and cooked it at 350 for 10 min, and then broiled on high for 5 min ea side (and I basted with the extra sauce in between flips). This works great on top of uncle bens 90 second whole grain medley rice.

Not quite authentic jerk, but pretty close. I gotta say some of the reviews on here are RIDICULOUS!  It is common sense that when cutting up hot peppers to wear gloves or just not touch the pulp..and yes this is a spicy dish...that is what Jerk Chicken is SUPPOSED TO BE, so don't complain that it is too hot, traditional jerk recipes use scotch bonnett peppers which are close in heat content to a habanero... if that is too hot for you then use jalapenos or cut back to anaheim or poblano peppers. Thanks for the good recipe!

This turned out great and it wasn't a lot of work!  Made a couple of changes based on what I had on hand--didn't use the sesame oil and used green onion instead of regular.  Also cooked on my George Foreman grill instead of broiling.   It was so easy and spicy! :)

November 12, 2007:	This is an AWESOME receipt!!  I did not have any habanera peppers (nor will I ever) so I used 2 small HOT chili peppers and the equivalent number of HOT jalapeño pepper slices.  It was a little too hot for my normal taste buds; however, the overall flavor is absolutely GREAT!  I also had some fresh parsley and some fresh cilantro and used a little of each of these.  Cilantro is a definite must here.  I had one very large chicken breast (.7 #) but went ahead with the whole marinade receipt since I didn’t think the above receipt had enough fluid.  This was about the correct amount of marinade for 2 servings.  I also had creamy chicken with rice and a small salad.  The extra marinade was excellent on both the chicken and the rice.  Also, 1/4 teaspoon of onion per serving!  Give me a break.  I used 1 teaspoon of onion powder and 2 would have been better.  Try one medium sized onion.
Jan. 28, 2008: Second time.  This is one extremely good chicken marinade.  I marinated one chicken breast (sliced into two thinner pieces) for 24 hours and then used my Forman grill for 6 minutes.  Perfect!  I had long grain white rice with the chicken (sauce poured over everything) and had a spinach cranberry salad with homemade balsamic vinegar with poppy and sesame seed dressing.

Very good. Though I'm sure it would have been better on the grill, the broiler was a nice, quick alternative to hauling out the charcoal. Doubled the sauce, and mighty glad I did. Thickened and served on the chicken and rice it's unbelievable. Used jalapenos fresh from the garden instead of habaneros, but added quite a bit of the seeds so I didn't loose too much of the spice.

Different!  I think I'm going to have to make this a few more times and get used to the flavor.  It's good, just... different!  I did follow the suggestions and doubled the marinade, and marinated the chicken for 24 hours.  Used half a jalapeno and a quarter of a habenero, and the spice came out perfect.

Tasted too much soy when I made it. So I added more vinegar and some grey poupon mustard. Tasted much better with that done. We will see how it tastes after it is cooked.
Update...It tasted pretty good. It did have an odd flavor to it. I am going to try another one on here, just didn't impress us.

The only thing I did different was to add the juice of one lime.  That said, it was a good recipe.  A little too sweet for me, but good.  Next time I will add one more habanero pepper, add the juice of one orange and one lime, replace the sesame oil with canola and try that.

Wow, Perfect!!  The taste was incredible.  The only change I made was to grill the chicken breasts for what I believe was a more authentic taste.  And believe the others when they tell you...to keep and use that leftover sauce...it makes the dish fantastic!  Thank you!

This was a very good recipe, I will be making it again.  I did not give the recipe 4 stars because I had to add some lime juice and substitue jalapenos.

We loved this recipe--especially my husband who really likes spicy food.  I made a honey mustard dipping sauce for myself to tone down the heat a bit.  Definitely a great recipe as it is and this will become a part of my frequently used recipe list!

This is a fantastic dish; I always receive many compliments/requests for the recipe whenever I make this.  I've always used whole chicken breasts and grilled them.  The vinegar cuts the heat of the habanero peppers, so the longer you marinate the chicken the milder it becomes.  And that's why I typically use 3-4 habanero peppers (seeds and veins removed) and marinate it overnight.

Delicious, but not exactly jerk flavor.  I will definitle be making it again and again, though.  Used onion powder instead of the real thing.  Marinated 9 hrs and grilled - served with brown rice and grilled pineapple.  Excellent!

This recipe was okay, but not great.  I used 2 Tbsp. of brown sugar instead of 3 and jalepeno peppers instead of habenero.  I substituted nutmeg, cinnamon, and black pepper for allspice.  My husband said he liked it, but I didn't agree.  Sorry, but I won't make it again.

I loved it! I marinated the chicken for a good 2-3hrs, used veg oil instead of sesame oil. But WOW was it SPIIIIICEY, next time, not as much habanero! The chicken was really sweet and had a nice flavor, then the habanero kicked in.

We did not hate this but definitely did not like it. The sauce was way to salty and doesn't taste anything like jerk chicken. Will probably not make again.

Great spicy dish.  My husband absolutley LOVES this and I can't make it often enough.  I use thinner breasts and back off on the oven time to about four minutes on each side or my chicken pieces dry out. If you don't like it so spicy you may try a 1/2 unseeded habanero. Thanks for the recipe.

This chicken had a wonderful flavor, when your mouth stopped burning!  I must have gotten a hold of a seriously hot habanero--holy cow!  Only the strong were able to put the sauce over rice, as it was I was glad I only marinated the chicken for an hour.  I would totally try this again with a wimpier pepper cause the flavors were great.  Very simple to make, took no time at all to prepare.  Thanks for all of the suggestions, and I'll certainly try it again.

MY MY MY.  Others have suggested to marinate this overnight for more flavor and we did.  We love spicy food.  This was really hot. We all had to have bread and butter to cool our taste buds.  Ended up using the leftovers to make chicken salad in hope that the mayo would cool the habenero.  We could no even use the sause as the chicken was hot enough as it was.  WOW!!!!!

I only marinated my chicken slices for an hour -- the flavor was good, but we would have liked it to be a bit spicier.  Rather than adding another habanero, I think I'll marinate the next batch longer (maybe overnight?).

My family loved it! I switched it a bit, instead of using brown sugar, I used agave-nector. I also used light soy, it was a winner in my house. Visitor's loved it too. Thanks!

This was very good. I made it exactly as directed except that I used boneless chicken thighs instead of breasts. My only complaint is that there was very little spice to speak of. If you like your dishes spicy, I would recommend adding another habanero pepper.

I thought this was really good! My husband and I loved it, and I used the left over chicken and added it to my salad the next night for dinner! I had to substitute the pepper with an Ancho chile because my local store did not have habanero's.  I will make this again!!

Great dish! Will definitely make this again. I did change the recipe a bit since I was missing some of the ingredients. I substituted cilantro for parsley, and scotch bonnet pepper instead of habanero. Like other reviewers mentioned be careful handling the peppers. Wear gloves! I also forgot to reserve some of the marinade but i didn't feel like it ruined the dish.

I used this on a pork roast and it was amazing.  I didn't have a habanero so I substitued and used jalapeno sauce.  It made excellent pulled pork sandwiches.  
Thanks for sharing!

This was an excellent meal!  The marinade/sauce was really great.  I doubled the marinade because we love sauce, however, I only used 1/2 of one habanero pepper (pulp removed).  I was worried about the chicken being too hot for my 4 year old and 8 year old to tolerate.  It wasn't.  Next time, I will probably add a little bit more of a pepper.  We served this with rice and black beans.  Very Good!!!

If I could rate this 4.5 stars I would.  This recipe was super easy and very good.  I didn't add the habanero pepper, simply because I didn't have one on hand and didn't want to go to the store for it.  I just sprinkled in 2 tsp. of curshed red pepper and it still tasted very good!  I am sure the habanero pepper would have been even better.  I will try it with a habanero next time!

This was great!  I had to use a jalapeño instead of the habanero because my grocery store didn't have any in stock, but it was still delicious.  I served it with basmati rice, black beans, and corn.  A definite keeper.  I will make it again with the habanero.

I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't use a food processor or blender. I put everything in a bowl and stirred it up. I marinated the chicken for 1 hour and put them in the oven on broil. It turned out wonderfully. Great recipe!

Very good sauce! Excellent flavor! Doubled everything, except chicken and pepper (used one jalapeno), which wasn't spicy in the least, but delicious.  Plan to try again with habanero and thigh meat. Definitely a keeper!

This is really good!  I de-seeded the  habanero though, and ended up putting the chicken stips on the grill.  I served it on white rice along with a mango salso recipe I found on this website also.  However, I am personally calling it "Teryaki Chicken With A Kick", 'cause that's what it tasted like to me.  Very good though and I will definitely make it again.

This is definitley noit jerk chicken.  However, the mixture gave the chicken a really good taste.  I only marinated for 20 minutes and it was still good.  Thanks for the recipe, my whole family enjoyed it.

watch out for the habaneros. next time i'll only use half or de-seed it first. i made it as a sauce instead of a marinade by slightly sauteeing the chicken first, then adding the sauce until it reduced some.

I am a firm believer in using the senses to cook a recipe. If, during the cooking process, a dish looks visibly unappealing or smells unappetizing, my opinion of it is often affected upon tasting. This recipe violated my sense-oriented cooking methods. I did not care for the smell of the marinade as I loaded the ingredients into my food processor. I could not continue with the recipe. I DO NOT recommend this recipe.

I was surprised this was so good!! The ingredient list is deceptively simple. I used dried red hot pepper flakes since that is all I had...but I am looking forward to the haberno pepper next time. Try with plain basmati rice!

We really enjoyed this recipe, the chicken turned out fantastic.  It had a delicious flavor, a splendid warm heat (I used 1 whole jalapeño instead of a habanero) and went incredibly well with white rice.  I also bought breast tenders (already sliced boneless/skinless breast pieces) from out local Costco, but I imagine slicing up the breast would have the same effect.  I also bbq'ed the tenders with some applewood, it added a delicious smokey flavor that complimented the sweet/spicy flavor very well.

In retrospect I would have included a nice simple flavor in a veggie to compliment all the flavors in the chicken.  Maybe Broccoli or Asparagus would have been a good choice.

Long story short, I loved the recipe!  Thank you for sharing...

Delicious and easy to make. I doubled the marinade recipe so I'd have extra sauce. I left out the habanero since I didn't have one, but next time I think I'll use a few drops of tobasco instead. Served it over white rice.

Used jalepeno pepper and cooked chicken strips on the grill and it was very tasty.  Used about 1.75lbs of chicken breast.  Can't wait to put the leftovers in a wrap and eat as a sandwich.

I used chicken thighs and marinated 24 hrs.  The flavor was rather...odd.  While I was eating it I kept trying to like it more than I did, my husband agreed.  I don't think we'll make it again- however, I've never cooked chicken on the broiler before and I did like the way it was cooked, so I'm glad I tried it.

I only got to marinade the chicken for 1 hour but I was quite impressed with the flavor. I increased the quantities on everything (especially the allspice)and added fresh chopped ginger and ground nutmeg. It was cooked a little too long but the leftover marinade I reduced and drizzled over the top and served with wild rice. A really good starting point for Jerk chicken.

I got mixed reviews on this dish, although I thought it was very good. Our guests said they liked it and I enjoyed it, but my mom commented that it was just ok. I marinated 6 chicken breasts instead of 4, and added hot sauce instead of the habenero and the meat came out delicious and moist. I think I'll make this again on my own.

Tried this last night, because I wanted to serve a Jamaican style dish for Bob Marley's birthday :))
My family doesn't go for spicy too much, so I changed the Habanero to a Jalapeno, and also added the juice of about 1/4 lime.
Very delicious, and everyone said they'd like to have it again!  Thanks for the recipe.

My husband rated it a 10 out of 10 stars. I didn't follow the recipe very closely (I live in a village and don’t have access to much) but used chili hot sauce for the pepper, apple cider vinegar instead of wine vinegar, olive oil instead of sesame, and only 1½ T brown sugar. I didn’t add allspice but a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg…I don’t really know what allspice is. I didn’t have fresh thyme so I used dried, I only had a teaspoon but that seemed to suffice. I can’t wait to try this following the recipe. Thanks

Good stuff.  We eat this with brown rice.  When we don't have the habanero pepper on hand we have used hot sauce, chili pepper or red peper flakes.  All were good substitutes.  We never have enough extra marinade to heat up, but it is fine without the extra marniade on top.

The flavor of this is delicious. I substituted vegetable oil for the sesame and dried thyme for fresh. Followed the recipe other than that. Next time I would make more of the sauce to have some to put over my rice. I did take the seeds and membranes out of the habanero pepper, but would probably leave them in next time, since it wasn't very hot without them. Definitely will make again.

Great flavor!  I made mine w/o the oil and w/ a jalapeno pepper (they didn't have any habanero at the store).  It was delicious!  I used boneless, skinless chicken tenders instead of breasts and  marinaded them over night. We cooked them on the Foreman grill.

I made this recipe for our Valentine's dinner at home, and my husband and I really enjoyed it! For reasons unknown, the habanero pepper I used didn't have much "kick" to it, so I ended up sprinkling the chicken with ground cayenne pepper before we ate it. I made extra marinade and put some in a separate container so we could pour it over our rice. We will be making this again!

Delicious!!!
Substituted a handful of red cayenne peppers for the habenero - and still came out wonderfully... My boyfriend was glad the hotter pepper wasn't used (wimp! :))   
He said to save this one, and make it often.

This was quite good. I used jalepenos, because I didn't have any habanaros on hand. I will definately try habanaros next time though. Great low-cal, low fat recipe.

I only had time to marinate this for 1 hour and it was wonderful!!  I was a bit liberal with the onion and garlic since both my husband and I love lots of garlic.  It turned out perfect.  It had a good amount of heat to it with 1 habanero, but it was definitely not too hot. I took the leftovers for work and everyone loved it.  I will definitely make this again and marinate it a bit longer to increase the heat of the habanero.

This marinade is great!!! I let the meat marinade over night. I only used half of the pepper since I had read all the other reviews and a lot of people said it was very hot.
I will definitely make this again.
The only thing I don't like about it..there is not enough sauce left over for the rice, it's kinda dry with only the meat.

Rikk- thanks for sharing such an easy, fast, tasty recipe! This was my first attempt at Jerk Chicken and it came out perfect. I ended up marinading it for three days because when I got home from shopping and started preparing the marinade, I found the serrano peppers had been left out of my sack. I finished the marinade, sans peppers, and didn't get back to actually cooking for 3 days, though I did get peppers on day 2 and added them to the marinade. My husband said it was the best he'd ever had, that it was just like something you'd get at a restaurant. High praise, indeed.

Easy recipe, except curious to know what temperature "broil" is. I only needed half the cooking time because the strips were thinner than 1". I used 475F for a broil and cooked 8 mins. Will definitely make again.

Made this jerk chicken recipe exactly and it was delicious
Instead of a side of rice, I made a wrap with leafy green lettuce and some tomato slices and served it with corn on the cob
I WILL definitely make this again!

I really enjoyed this recipe. The only things I did differently we’re that I used bone-in/chicken thighs with skin instead of the boneless chicken breast and I used only a half habenero pepper because my family doesn’t eat too much spicy. Will definitely make this recipe again!

I love this dish.  It is one of the few recipes I have found where I don't need to add extra spices.  The marinade comes out quite hot (too hot for some) and works well as a hot sauce for other dishes if you make extra. Cut the chicken into strips or chunks in order to provide a greater surface area for the marinade.  I recommend serving the chicken over coconut rice.

This was a great "do in a hurry" recipe with a couple of changes.  I used olive oil in place of the rice oil, and a few shakes of red hot (cayenne pepper) sauce in place of habanero, only because I didn't have those ingredients on hand.  I also didn't have time to marinade, so I just baked the chicken breasts with all of the sauce.  It was still very flavorful, tender, and not too spicy. I will definitely make this again...maybe next time I will allow to marinade a while and see if it's even better.

This was very good, and pretty easy too. I agree with several other reviewers that there should be a note on how to handle the pepper. Not everyone on here knows that they should be handled differently than anything else. It definately was a bit spicy, but that's what we were looking for.

Not that great. WAY to hot and used 1/2 the habanero (but I also used the seeds). I love extremely spicy stuff but it was too hot. I probably won't make again.

I made this last nite and it was GREAT  !!! I did not have the red wine vinegar so i used white and it was awesome. My husband and two teenagers LOVE hot foods so I will make it again and again.

Served this to friends on game night & got rave reviews. Couldnt find a habenero, so I just added some red pepper flakes for heat, but I am looking forward to trying with one (or jalepeno) next time. Thanks for sharing a great recipe.

I used jalepno pepper instead of anaheim. The chicken wasn't spicy at all. We grilled  instead of broiled.

This was tasty and easy, but a little sweeter than I usually look for in a good jerk recipe. Might try some extra spice and a little less brown sugar next time.

My hubby, 4 kids and I LOVED this! I pureed red pepper with the rest of the marinade since I had one to use up, and it was delicious!  I'd love to double it next time to make more sauce to pour over the rice, also. THANK YOU!!

This recipe was delicious! I doubled the marinade recipe and after pan frying the chicken to brown added the rest to make a sauce. I served the chicken over coconut rice and with Pineapple Mango Salsa. They went together perfectly. So good!

THIS WAS AMAZING. It was, in fact, really spicy!! I turned the chicken w/ my fingers, since I didn't have any clean tongs, then licked my fingers and my mouth started burning!  I loved it. I had to eat this w/ 2.5 glasses of water. [I served it w/ brown rice, also].I forgot to buy onion, so I didn't include that...I also had to make more sauce while the chicken was marinating in 3/4 of it, 'cause it didn't seem to make very much. But I would definitely make this again!

Extremely tasty!  I didn't have any red wine vinegar, so I used two tbsp's of apple cider, and one tbsp of white zinfandel that was in the fridge. Also, I used two jalepenos instead of the one habanero pepper, and when I tasted the marinade I thought "wow this is going to be way too spicy." But after it marinated for an hour and a half, we cooked it on the grill and it turned out perfectly! Had a good amount of spice, and a hint of sweetness from the brown sugar. This was my first attempt at jerk chicken and it turned out great!

This was pretty good. It was definitely easy and quick to make. The first time I made it, I used 2 jalapeno peppers instead of the habanero. It was good. Last night though, I made this recipe again with the habanero and I definitely like it better this way. I followed the recipe exactly as written and it was spicy hot...that's good of course since my husband loves spicy food. I'll be making this again if I ever need a quick meal. I made the sauce and cut the chicken the night before and let it marinate until I got home from work the next day.

I love this marinade. It is great for any chicken or pork.  I also use jalapenos because I don't care for too much heat. I put the meat in a day or two before grilling to make sure the marinade really soaks in. Great recipe.

Very good. I was out of town when my brother made this. He didn't have any habaneros so he used my home-grown cayenne, jalapeno, and sweet banana peppers. When I got back, he had saved me a tiny plate in the fridge. Even though it was left-overs, man was it good. And very spicy. Definitely a repeat dish.

This was a nice change from the everyday chicken.  I, as all too usual, didn't read the whole thing before I charged ahead with the recipe and didn't reserve any sauce for serving and didn't cut the chicken into strips.  It still turned out pretty good but could've been better if I had done it right.

This was the tastiest chicken I've had in awhile! We served it on top of cesar salad and it was great. I added a little more brown sugar then called for to make it a sweeter sauce and put in 3/4 of the habanero pepper. Next time, I would just keep my fingers covered when cutting the pepper because my fingers tasted spicy and hot for at least a full day after cutting it. Even after soaking my fingers in lemon juice, they still had the pepper taste.

This was a great tailgate food. We fed at least 500-600 people and this was one of our foods. We followed the recipe loosely because of the wide range of tastes, making the chicken less spicy and sweeter, and made the sauce very hot. It was a total hit. GO Houston Cougars

This wasn't anything out of this world. It didn't taste bad but it didn't wow us either. There are better marinades on this website.

The sauce can be very spicy, so make sure to warn your guests. Otherwise the chicken is savory enough without it!

I loved this recipe as I'm just learning to do some cooking.  My girlfriend enjoyed it as well.  Some other people thought it was a little hot.  I would still cook it the same.  Jerk chicken is supposed to be warm.  Great easy recipes to impresses girls with.
