This was tasty. For me I would have preferred more veggies, less potato.. next time.

I added lentils and blanched almonds for a little protein and nuttiness. I also switched some of the vegetables- instead I used what I had on hand (green bell peppers, zucchini, carrots). All in all I really enjoyed this recipe. It is versatile and the spice blend is truly something to celebrate.

To be fair I didn't use fresh ginger since I didn't have it on hand. I used ground ginger. This recipe was good but I think it could use a little more to make it great. The flavor is very nice. It needs a little protein. I imagine it would be nice with some nuts or garbanzo beans.
