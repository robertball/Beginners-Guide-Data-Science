I was very disappointed in the flavor of these bar the day I made them, but when I served them the following day the flavor was much better as was the texture.  Good balance of sweet and salty.

Great brownie. Texture was very fudge-like in the center. I used lightly salted cashews but next time I make these I would go for regular salted. This recipe would also be good with pecans or walnuts.

Upscaled by half for a 9x13 pan. Reduced temp to 325 for a glass baking dish and baked for about 34 mins.
