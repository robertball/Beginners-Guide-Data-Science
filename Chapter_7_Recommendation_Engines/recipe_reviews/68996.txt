The rice was extremely flavorful and colorful.  Next time I will put the rise mixture over the chops instead of the chops over the rice.

I loved this recipe.  The rice was very tasty.  I used chicken broth, because I had it on hand.  Also I didn't have mushrooms, but used shredded carrots.  Almost any veggie would be good.  This is my new favorite pork chop recipe.  So nice to not have cream of mushroom soup in it.

Very Good. I love the caserol idea. Easy clean up. I totally tweaked the recipe though and made it into a sort of spanish rice (was simply in the mood).I added some onion and cooked it with some garlic. Then cooked the rice a little. I replaced the canned tomatoes with a tomato sauce and added about 1 tsp. of Cummin. Made the dish rich and comforting.

The rice recipe is good, and I don't usually even really like rice! The pork chops are just okay, and a little bland. I added lots of fresh garlic and fresh tomatoes (instead of canned) to the rice. I think in the future I would cook the pork chops another way and serve the rice on the side.

Thank you for a recipe with rice and pork chops that DID NOT have condensed soup in the mix! We enjoyed this recipe.  I would kick up the rice mixture a little more next time with more onions and fresh garlic with the rice. I would also make sure that your pork has a little bit of fat on it, so the chops don't dry out!  I used brown rice and it turned out perfectly.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was a BIG hit and very easy.  I'm always looking for the one-dish dinners to make on busy nights.  I did have to alter a little bit b/c I only had instant (Uncle Ben's in the bag rice).  I cooked the rice in the bag in the microwave and par-boiled broccoli in chicken broth for 5 min.  Then I added red pepper and fresh tomatoes (chopped).  I drained most of the broth and mixed the rice and veggies together with a little bit of the broth to keep it from drying out.  The rest was followed as directed and it was delicious.

Made this last night and it was great. I didnt have the diced tomatoes so it may have been a little dry but it had great flavor and was an easy & quick meal.

This was a very good and healthy way to prepare a one-dish pork chop meal.  We really enjoy the lightness of it.  Next time I will try using Rotel tomatoes instead of plain for a little zippier flavor.  Also used brown rice instead of white.

After years of Mexicali Pork Chops I'm glad to have a new baked pork chop and rice recipe. My husband loved it.  I also added 3/4 peas, 1/4 finely shredded carrot and some fresh chives on top for more color/texture. We'll definitely have this again!

I made this recipe for the first time last night.  Since my husband and son do not like rice, I used orzo and changed the baking time to 45 minutes.  It was perfect!  My son loved it as did my husband!

I was out of white rice so I used a Lundberg wild rice blend instead.  I used a fresh tomato with a little oregano and parsley instead of the canned Italian tomatoes.  I used a can of mushrooms instead of fresh.  Very flavorful and easy to prepare.

I found this recipe nothing really worth writing about.  Just sort of a bland recipe.  The chops did turn out very tender but not much flavor.

Good recipe but the problem is the rice only takes 30 minutes and the pork takes at least 45.  NExt time I will cook the chops on the stove with the juice from the tomatoes, garlic and oil for at least 15 minutes.  Then I will put in the oven with the rice for 30 minutes.  When I made, I omitted the peppers and used carrots and the rice was really good plus I used fresh parsley.

AWESOME!  I prepared this one dish Pork Chop meal tonight and my family gave it a thumbs up and want it again.  It was so easy to prepare but had all "good" stuff in it that was healthy.  I did my cleaning up while it was in the oven and was all done.  Fixed a great salad with it . Would have liked a roll but was out.  No disappointments here. Thanks for sharing this and making my life easier. :)

We loved this so much.  The only thing that I changed was I used tomatoes with chiles to give it a little kick.  My husband said it was just enough spice.  I used bone in pork chops.  I also used red pepper instead of green by mistake.  It still turned out delicious.  My 10 month old ate a lot of the rice.  Thanks for a healthy delicious recipe.

This was just okay.
What I would do differently next time is continue to cook the pork chops in the pan, as they started out.  Salt, pepper, garlic and paprika on the chops is good. Don't put them in the rice mix.  I would take the rice mixture out of the oven after 20 minutes, if it's long grain white rice.  It was a mushy, mushy (though fairly tasty) ...well...mush.

Great recipee!  I happened to have all the ingrediants on hand except for mushrooms.  So I added chopped baby carrots instead.  Yummy, flavorful, and colorful!  Next time I will omit the green peppers, add the red peppers and sweat peas!  This will be a routine recipe in our home.

Wish I could give you more stars!!  This is a delightful mixture of colorful veggies along with the rice and pork.  I would use this recipe with any kind of meat and I know it would be equally successful.  Many thanks for sharing such a great recipe with all of us.

I really liked this one, and the kids loved it too!  I actually put carrots instead of mushrooms, and was outta rice, so used noodles.  It was good.  Sprinkle some cheese on top and it finishes it up great!

Instead of the vegetables listed I added a small bag of frozen chopped mixed vegetables along with the can of diced tomatoes. I still found that it lacked a tiny bit of flavor. Maybe it's because I was using lean and thin chops. Still a wonderful recipe. Thanks!

Very good.  Used brown rice instead of white.  Prepped the night before, finished cooking the next night.  Tender chops, flavorful rice.  Have already made this one twice.

LOVED this rice...and lucky I did because I doubled it to bring to a pig roast.  I chopped the mushrooms (baby bellas) to hide them from the kids (which worked) and used a red and a yellow pepper.  Chops were good too, I left off the salt...didn't miss it.  I made the rice, then used the same pan to brown the chops...just to save the clean-up time.  Great, easy recipe and thanks klj!

Very bland, no real flavors came out with this recipe. It would need some adjusting with spices to make this dish work for me. I do not recommend unless you like boring food.

Our family of 4 all liked this recipe and there were no leftovers.  I did modify it...2 boys will not eat rice w/ anything in it so I boiled the rice and broth and put half of it in the baking dish and I added the tomatoes and mushrooms to the remaining, cooked it longer, then put that in the other 1/2 of the pan and put the pork chops on top.  That way 1/2 the dish was the plain rice, easily separated.

This was soooo good - total comfort food. Any time I have to brown the meat first it feels like work - that's why only four stars - so worth it though.  I used full salt chicken broth and the canned Italian style tomatoes for more flavor - very family friendly. Thx

This was SO good and SO easy! Added to my regular rotation. I used boneless pork chops but next time will use bone in.  They were nice and moist when we first started eating but dried out quickly so I think bone in pork chops will be better next time. But otherwise, this was a delicious meal that contains everything you need for dinner. I added some biscuits is all. Thank you for posting this really great dinner recipe.

I have made this recipe 3 times and my husband and I love this dish.  I have added additional spices to our liking and followed the advice of another person who said to put the rice over the chops when baking.  This recipe is super easy and pretty healthy.

The rice was very good. I added zucchini & frozen carrots to the veggies and dropped the green pepper. I also used brown rice which required more liquid and longer cooking time. I used the wrong size pork chops, not thick enough. Surprisingly not that dry, but would use 1" thick chops next time.

Every component to this dish adds a complex and wonderful flavor. The rice and vegetables are fantastic. I double the recipe just so I can have plenty of left overs.

This is super easy and tasty. I am not a huge pepper fan so I substituted the green pepper for zucchini, and  I added fresh cilantro.

Can't get much easier than this. I did add more onion and no mushrooms (none in the house) I skipped the browning and 'bringing to a boil' steps and just layered rice, veggies and chops in dish, seasoning each layer and then pouring the broth over the top.  I baked it for 1 hour and everything was perfectly done. I also used beef broth and added some worceshire sauce, grill seasoning and cajun spice.  We did enjoy it, but it lacked "wow" flavors.

This looked very pretty and was not so bad.  The problem was that the pork was not very flavorful even after adding more seasoning and the rice came out pretty gooey even after baking for only 45 min.  I say check it after 30 min.

I loved the garden rice and would give it five stars on it's own.  The pork chops were just ok though.

I thought this recipe was great. My husband liked the rice, but he didn't like all the "stuff" in it. Maybe I lucked out, but I had no problems with my pork chops being dry. I did saute my veggies for about 5 minutes before adding the rice and the broth. I'll be making this again, and hopefully soon.

I changed the seasonings from italian to spanish (personal preference) and added some extra stuff like salsa and green chiles. This is a very versatile recipe, you can make it so many ways. NO CONDENSED SOUP YAYYYYY!
Thanks a bunch!

We just found this to be OK. I was surprised, because of all the yummy ingredients in it, but it ended up with no real flavour. Part of the problem I had with it was the fact that after an hour the rice was mushy and overcooked, and the pork had completely dried out. When I do pork chops, I either cook them quickly to keep them moist, or slow cook them for a long time to make them tender. The cooking time on this seemed to be somewhere in the middle. Maybe I'd use a slow cooker and substitute wild rice next time? Not really sure...thanks for the recipe, though.

Was easy to prepare. Used chicken broth instead of water. Everyone loved it with except for the picky eater. He isn't much of a pepper fan, but my husband and 15 year old loved it.

This was a very good recipe.  The pork is bland, even when I double the seasonings.  The rice, however, is amazing, and it's our favorite part of the meal.  I always double the rice part and cook in a larger dish (11x15in).  I add more vegetables, too.  Zucchini works nicely.

Very Good.  This came out a lot better than I had expected.  I had to substitute the vegetable broth with chicken broth because I didn't have any veggie broth.  Also, I did not have any orange peppers so only used green peppers.  I did not have green onions and I substituted by using a yellow onion.  This turned out delicious.  As a time saving measure you could cut up all of the vegetables and precook the rice mixture and refrigerate over night.  That way the following evening to make a quick meal all you have to do is brown the chops and throw it all in a dish into the oven it goes!! I will be making this one again!

The rice in this recipe was delicious!  The pork chops were just okay.  I took them out of the oven 15 minutes early and they were still dried out.  We may try this again because we really enjoyed the rice or just make the rice and forget about the chops.  Thank you for sharing!!

We have made this recipe twice now, once with Pork Chops and once I substituted with chicken. It is really reat either way. Both my husband and I wanted a little more flavor to the rice so we sprinkled Red Hot onto the rice servings once on our personal dinner plates, leaving it more mild for the children. This is a great meat and rice casserol without the cans of soup which so many recipes have and which I really cannot abide. LOVE this recipe and it is a keeper for our family!

Yummy!  It is difficult to find new recipes that work for my family because we are all allergic to wheat.  This recipe worked great for us.  I do have wheat free brown rice flour on hand as a thickening agent, but this tasted great with the broth.  Most recipes call for a cream of ....something but those cans have wheat.  This was perfect!

This is a pretty tasty meal.  I only had two pork chops left, so did half pork chops and half chicken.  The pork chops were fairly tender.  I just wish they would have soaked up the flavor and been a tiny bit more juicy.   But still a good dish overall.

I modified this recipe for one person, so I only cooked it for about 30 minutes. The pork chop was almost overdone, but still moist because it was cooked with the rice. When I make this again, I will let the rice boil on its own for another 5 minutes so that it's precooked a bit more before it goes in the oven, as I found my rice wasn't quite done yet. But I enjoyed the recipe, especially the presentation of the veggies mixed in with rice!

Fantastic!  The rice was deliciously different, the pork tender and juicy.  I used Trader Joes brown rice melody and it's the best rice I've ever eaten.  Used fresh mushrooms and a frozen mixture of bell peppers.  I also used loin chops for lesser fat content.

My 2 and 4 year old ate 2 of these chops between them!  The chops were really juicy and tender, and it made a great alternative to shake and bake.  I did exchange the vegetable broth for chicken broth, the green onions for white onions, and left out the mushrooms.  Really great!  It will be in heavy rotation here.

I'll make it again and be sure to use the temperature of the chop to determine when it is done. I got lazy and just went with the time and my chops ended more than a little overcooked.
Flavors were good. I am also going to tweek the amount of rice or liquid as the rice turned out mushy.

I made as directed, but I didn't care for this at all.  The rice wasn't soupy, but it was overdone mush.  No comment from husband means he didn't like it.  Definitely will not make again.

Holy moley, this is awesome!  Increased the spices a bit, doubled the rice mix, thinking I'd make a stir fry with the leftovers.  Yeah, there were no leftovers.  I wanna try this same idea with chicken.

I used double the amount of broth using chicken  broth instead. I followed directions  and still felt was a little dry but definitely has potential. I am a good cook and love to modify recipes   so the next time I will use 1 and a half box of broth and make sure my rice is cooked all the way before baking it. I will also simmer chops in pan until tender versus pan frying for few minutes

The pork chops are very dry and the rice didn't get done.  The flavor is very good though.  Next time, I'll keep the ingredients, but cook things separately, I guess.

What a nice option for pork! I followed the recipe fairly closely, adding more garlic due to personal preference, and I used the juice from the canned tomatoes. I really like the combination of flavors with the veggies and Italian seasonings. My husband REALLY liked it and said to add it to the rotation! Thanks for a great recipe!

This makes an excellent quick meal, perfect for a week night.  I made mine on the stove top (saving overall cooking time), browning the pork in a skillet, then adding rice and veggies into the same skillet (decreasing the dirty dishes) and cooking until the rice was done.  This is a perfect recipe for tweaking, switching the pork for ground beef or cubed boneless chicken breasts.  The veggies could be switched as well, broccoli or beans would be good substitutes. It goes together fast and uses common ingredients.  Thanks for this recipe!

I made it today 12/16/2016. It came out perfect. One thing  I forgot to drain the tomatoes, but it just added more flavor to rice. The smell of the browning pork chops in the minced garlic & oil is so intoxicating. I also used caned mushrooms, as I didn't have fresh.

Wow! I had no idea what to expect with this recipe and was delighted that my whole family loved this!! My children do not like ANY of the veggies, but I kept the tomatoes (I used half a can of Aylmer's fine diced in olive oil and garlic), and substituted the rest with broccoli, asparagus and shredded carrot. I love that the dish can be altered many ways and it was so easy to prepare! Thanks so much for sharing, this one will be a mainstay!

I have just put this delicious looking recipe in the oven and I cannot wait until it's done! My daughters who are 3 & 4 say the garlic smelt good when it was sautéing. ?? Im counting down the minutes because I think it's going to be really good! I'll post a new review once it's done and I taste it!

I used a can of Rotel diced tomatoes to just because we felt like some spice. I did add garlic powder to the pork chop seasoning, but otherwise followed the recipe as is and it was delicious. I'm sure it would be fine to make as written, we simply adjusted the recipe slightly to suit or taste buds when I made this.

Pretty good! I was more liberal with the pepper/salt/paprika and rubbed it generously on each side of the pork chops. Fairly well seasoned that way, but it wouldn't hurt to have some kind of steak sauce or BBQ sauce on hand in case the seasoning is a little weak for your taste. Rice turned out wonderfully. Nice combo.

Rice mixture was great.  Going to try it with chicken next time.

I found the rice turned out quite mushy!  I used chicken broth because I didn't have vegetable and I added Italian spices because I only had plain diced tomatoes.  I found the taste a little bland but my husband and girls liked it.  I'll defitely make this recipe again but will reduce the broth and add a but more seasoning.

Even the picky kids liked it.  Read other reveiws about dry/tough chops.  Not mine. They were moist and flavorful.  Followed recipe with no changes.

One  hour is too long. Pork chops were very dry. Will not do this recipe again!

Rice was great - but porkchops were chewy, leftovers weren't eaten.
