This was a good, refreshing smoothie that was easy to make with ingredients we almost always have at home.  It is not as creamy as those make with yogurt and/or milk, but definitely easy and quick.  After a taste test, my only change was adding some more fruit to take away some of the tartness of the orange juice.  I could have drank it either way, but my daughter preferred it, (and I agree), with a few more strawberries and touch more banana.  Also, if you are looking for that slushy texture, but don't want to water it down with too many ice cubes, use frozen bananas & strawberries... you could even freeze some OJ in ice cube trays!  We might try that!  Overall, a good, quick, easy way to get in a great serving of fruits!!

I used a frozen banana which eliminated the need for ice. This was delicious! NOTE: I'll use this recipe for a summer yogurt pop, just add a cup or so of greek yogurt. I bet that would be really tasty!

Yummy! I added a few more strawberries, used a frozen banana and omitted the ice cubes. Plus, I used organic, whole orange juice (not from concentrate, which typically has added sugar). It was only slightly sweet, not tart; the perfect accompaniment to lightly savory sandwiches. And a great way to get in lots of healthy fruit!

I doubled the ingredients, and it made two full tall glasses.I used frozen strawberries, which made it thicker, but not too thick. I found it very good, but there is a bit of a bitter after taste, which is why i gave it 4 stars. Over all, a great refreshing drink. Would be great on a summers day. (If you use frozen strawberries, do not use ice.)

Hubs drinks a lot of smoothies, and most are just, well, a smoothie.  This, to him, had definite distinction. It was flavorful, refreshing, pleasantly sweet, a litte tart, and creamy, even tho' there is no cream, milk or yogurt in it, which in by book is refreshing enough in itself.  Because I used both frozen strawberries and bananas I added no ice which in turn made the flavor particularly intense. If you prefer something a little more subtle, be sure to include the ice.

I'm sorry but I just did not care for this one at all.  I didn't use the ice at all because all my stuff was frozen.  I think that the banana was indeed too strong.  I guess I felt like this could have used the yogurt - I'm really not sure.

This smoothie has surpassed my expectations of it by far! To be honest, I'm really not a fan of orange juice and I worried that this would taste really tart. But curiosity got the better of me, and I'm glad it did! It's a perfect combination of sweet and tart. I used frozen strawberries and omitted the ice and the consistency is lovely. Great recipe, thank you!

Great smoothie! Instead of using ice, freeze the fruit first. That way you get the same icey consistency without watering it down! I also added a splash of milk.

My brother (8) and I (13)tried this for our first home made smoothie. It was refreshing, but semi-sour and needed extra sugar. The recipe didnt call for how much ice to use.  We experimented with it and found about two handfuls was plenty.  This was our first experience trying to find easy snacks that we could make on our own.  We overall had a great time making it, and will look forward to exploring more recipes.

Good. and we don't like too much banana, but I used a mixed juice rather than just orange and it still turned out great. Banana was not too strong.

This smoothie isdelicious. It had the perfect combination of all three fruits and had a nice hint of citrus. We make this smoothie almost everyday because smoothies are a really easy way to get your suggested fruit servings for each day. Dress it up by pouring the smoothie into a wine glass and adding a strawberry on the rim. Yum!

This is good. I ALWAYS use orange juice that is "not from concentrate". Also, I add 1 cup spinach or kale, and 1/4 cup almonds or pecans to make this smoothie cover my basic needs.

My first successful attempt at smoothie making, used a citrus flavored drink instead of OJ and a frozen banana instead of ice cubes. For future note, peel banana before freezing it... -_- lol 

Satisfies my constant sweet tooth, no added sweeteners! ?

Doing this with a cup of plain or vanilla yogurt is a Weight-Watcher's staple. It was a total of something like 8 points. Great for breakfast on a summer morning!

I thought this was a good smoothie. Nice that it didn't have dairy for a change. I used a frozen banana and strawberries, but my machine can process it. I added 4 ice cubes. Still seemed somewhat creamy without the milk or yogurt. I would make it again.

I replaced about 4oz of the orange juice with lemonade for personal preference. It came out nicely.

For more smooth and creamy smoothie, add in 1/2 - 1 cup of your favorite yogurt. Gives it more depth of flavor.

The best!  You get a full day's portion of fruit in one batch.. It goes down easy, is mildly sweet and is very refreshing.  If you happen to have some leftover at happy hour, it makes into a great margarita or, with the addition of some crushed pineapple, a tropical adult beverage..  YUM!

Can't go wrong with strawberry and banana in my opinion, except don't use frozen banana if you are using a one person blender!  Still good, but I had to add more juice. Will make again!

Very good, though I ended up adding half a tsp of sugar just to take off the tart edge.  I put the fruit in ziplock baggies in individual servings in the freezer so it's ready when I am - just add juice. I need no ice this way and my immersion blender makes short work of it.

Great combination of flavors. Added vanilla Greek yogurt for creaminess and omitted the ice since the fruit was frozen. Definitely a keeper.

So delicious, had to make 2 batches because my kids drank it all. I didn't make much of a change. I didn't have ice cubes, so used a cup of frozen strawberries instead, no ice cubes needed. I also used 1 cup of orange juice, threw in one peeled orange and put a couple of spoons of flax seeds to make the smoothie a little more filling. Very, very delicious, will definitely make again and again.

Not too shabby this recipe! The only thing was we subbed the OJ with pineapple J and added an extra while banana cause it was a bit too sour for my taste. Other than that it was close to Jamba Juice! Oh and added ice too to make it colder

This is the recipe that came with my blender and it is by far the best one I've tried. However, mine calls for 8 oz. vanilla yogurt and a tablespoon of honey.

There must be a thousand ways to make this fruit smoothie, but this was very good and, of course, I too had to alter the recipe a little.  I used a whole orange rather than juice, 1/2 cup unsweetened almond milk, 1/4 cup pomegranate juice, frozen strawberries, 1/2 frozen banana and a T ground flaxseed.  It made a 20 oz. smoothie.  I would have shared it with my husband if he was here, but since he's not, it's mine, all mine!  Delicious!

My family LOVES this smoothie.  I've made a couple of tweaks to the recipe, though.  Instead of adding ice cubes, I just freeze my strawberries and bananas and add those to the recipe.  I also add organic vanilla yogurt to it.  Those small tweaks make it thicker and sweeter.  YUMMY, YUMMY, YUMMY!!
