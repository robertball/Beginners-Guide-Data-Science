This was an excellent, easy-to-make, one-pan dish. My girlfriend and I managed to chop all the ingredients and cook this dish in about 15-20 minutes from start to finish. Based on some of the reviews that said the dish was a little bland, I added 2 tsp of crushed chili pepper and about 1 tsp of cayenne pepper to punch it up a bit. It added just a little spicy which is the way I prefer most of my food. I doubled the portions and ate this as a vegetarian main dish (along with some whole grain bread). Added to the Recipe Box and will make again!

This was a good way to use chard -- light yet hearty. I used significantly less olive oil, an entire can of garbanzos, an entire can of diced tomatoes, and added a clove of garlic. I also used leeks instead of onions and shallots, because that's what I had on hand.

I loved this, but then maybe I'm biased because I grew up on stuff like this with it's classic and simple Italian flavors and ingredients! Swiss Chard has always been my favorite vegetable and is sweeter and more tender than other greens (also great for adding to soups). The stalks need extra cooking time, so I sliced and cooked them separately in boiling, salted water until tender. Not wanting to open a can of garbanzo beans for just a half cup, I used the full can. I left out the green onion, but added extra shallots and fresh minced garlic. Adding the lemon at the end was something I don't generally do, but enjoyed. For those looking for old-fashioned, traditional Italian cooking and need an Italian side dish to complete their meal, this is a great and authentic choice.

This is excellent. So wholesome! I mixed in some goat cheese near the end, and make this side dish a meal! I also used canned tomatoes.

I've been having a hard time finding really good recipes for my garden-grown swiss chard, and finally I've found one!  I served it with lamb, but it would go great with many things.  Even my husband who has been avoiding any green thing from the garden liked this.

Swiss chard is a favorite here, in quiche, sauteed as a veg, etc. 

Get a good loaf of bread. I had a multi grain organic.

Start the saute with the chopped shallots and 1/2 lb sliced mushrooms. S&P lightly with each addition.

I had cannelleni beans on hand, and used a 1 lb can, drained and rinsed. Since it's mid winter, I subbed one 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes in puree. Sprinkle in some pasta or Italian  seasoning and freeze dried basil.

Add in the chard and chopped stems.

Add a bit of veggie "broth from the box" if needed.

Cover and cook a bit. Just let the chard shrink a bit, and  not  get grey.

Then nestle a few eggs into spoon hollows in the veggie stew. Cover, and check every three minutes. Mine took about 9 minutes on very low to give perfectly set, not runny eggs with creamy yolks.

Very tasty! I took the suggestions to add extra garbanzo beans, garlic, and onion, and it turned out great.

I was skeptical of this recipe, but I made it and found it to be very good.  In lieu of the garlic clove, I used 1 garlic scape.  Instead of the shallot and green onions, I used three spring onions.  This dish is really very tasty!

This was great, using what I had on hand.  I omitted the shallot and green onions, substituting one whole red onion roughly chopped and 3 minced cloves of garlic.  I made sure to stem the chard, chopped the stems, and threw them in with the onion and garlic to saute up nice and tender.  I used a whole can of garbanzo beans and 1 whole can of scantily drained garlic roasted tomatoes.  Cooked all this to a simmer, and added the chard to wilt.  After it was wilted, I used one tablespoon of lemon juice to sprinkle over it, and then tossed it.  I put it in the serving dish,  added a handful of grated Parmesan cheese, and stirred to combine.  It was HEAVENLY.  I will add more chard next time though, it looses a lot of volume when it wilts.  Even my super picky 2 year old liked this dish.

This was only so so. Definitely needed more chick peas. Even with them, it was bland. If I try to make this again, I might add more spices. It was just boring.

Suprisingly good- but a couple of musts: 1. You must add feta cheese in at the end 2. You must add a garlic clove and 3. You must cook the Swiss chard right through or it will be chewy... No one likes chewy Swiss chard

I made this the other night but added raw, shelled shrimp with the onion and garlic.  Then followed recipe as stated (using a can of Italian style tomatoes as suggested).  Served the vegetables and shrimp over whole grain thin spaghetti, sprinkled with shredded Mozzarella.  Makes a great main dish.  Leftovers were good, too!

I liked, but didn't love, this recipe. I found it slightly bland, so I made more sauce with shallot, garlic, lemon juice, balsamic vinegar, and olive oil and added that. That improved the recipe for me. I would make it again.

One of the best greens recipe EVER! The whole family loved this. Very refreshing with the lemon. 
I used yellow onions in place of the shallot and scallion, and used canned, fire roasted tomatoes, as that's what was on hand. Also had rainbow chard, so it was beautiful as well. Oh, and I added Feta to the leftovers and that was a great addition as well. This is a keeper!

I had a lot of garden chard so I tried this recipe. It's so tasty! Adding the tomatoes last makes the whole dish taste fresh and "Springy".  I used 2 packed cups chopped chard, leaves only (the stalks go into my veg stock). I also substituted 4 lg. cloves garlic for shallot, 1/2 med. onion for the green onions and 2 Roma tomatoes, as that's what I had on hand.  This is now a favorite and in my recipe box!

I've made this several times, usually adding a little (a small clove) of finely minced garlic. Sometimes I haven't had shallot or green onions on hand, so I have used regular white or yellow (or even red) onion chopped finely. I have also sometimes only had canned tomatoes on hand, and it still turns out great. I usually add a bit more spice than salt and pepper. Red pepper flakes and a bit of basil or oregano are a great addition. This turns out great every time. :)

This was really good. I have never had swiss chard before, but grew some in my garden for health benefits. My only suggestion is to be careful if you add any pepper like I did. The chard is "peppery" and with the addition of pepper it was almost overpowering. And I did not have garbanzo beans, so substituted white northern beans. Excellent with Cornbread!

Yay! This was my favorite thing I've made from this site.  I used two shallots and two roma tomatoes, otherwise, followed exactly and it was so tasty.  One note, (since the ingredients list doesn't mention which part(s) of the chard to use) if you're using both stalks and leaves, they will need different cooking times.  The stalks need to be thinly sliced and cooked for a couple more minutes than the greens.

I had a huge amount of swiss chard that was given to me by my sister from her garden, and didn't know what to do with it 'til I found this recipe.  I substituted yellow onion and garlic for the shallots and green onions since that was all I had on hand, and from there I just doubled the recipe and made it in my huge skillet.  Very tasty.  My husband and I both loved this.  Since I still have enough swiss chard left to make another batch of this, I'll definitely be making this again.

Yummy base recipe, though I changed it quite a bit.  I started with sautéing a large sweet onion, adding 3 cloves minced garlic and a pinch of red pepper flakes and a pinch of italian seasonings. I then added two bunches of spinach (I didn't have chard), then added 1 whole can of rinsed garbanzos, then 1 sliced tomato. I simmered on low, adding dashes of turmeric, cumin, cayenne, ground ginger, and garham masala. I finished to perfection with 1/2 a lemon and some ground sea salt. Soooooooo delicious and nutritious.  I doubled the recipe, and there were no leftovers! A vegetarian delight!

What a great way to put swiss chard and garbanzo beans together. I came home with these 2 ingredients and love this recipe. I did add more onion and garlic because I love those but I twisted it with cumin, now it has a Moroccan flavour to it and it is DELICIOUS. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I made a few adjustments after reading the other reviews. First, I sauteed the stems with the onions since they take a bit longer to cook and are somewhat bitter otherwise. I started salting at this step. Then I used a whole can of garbonzo beans and added a couple of tablespoons of apple cider vinegar to the hot pot, again to combat the inherent bitterness of the greens. I also added chili powder and Thai dragon pepper to the mix. It turned out wonderfully and was only better as it sat in the fridge for a couple of days. I would recommend using a very large bunch of chard if you use the whole can of beans. I used a ton from my garden and still had to supplement it with mustard greens.

I made this recipe with collard greens because my store did not carry swiss chard, also I added about a half of a tsp of smoked paprika, and used a whole can of chickpeas.  This recipe is outstanding!  I will be making this every week!

Best way that I've prepared chard! I used cherry tomatoes and used the whole can of garbanzo beans because I didn't want to save half for something else. Absolutely delicious! The lemon juice made it amazing.

Very delicious and so healthy.  I recommend steaming the Swiss chard for 6-7 minutes, then following the recipe.  I find wilted swiss chard a bit tough, so the steaming really helps.

My four-year-old daughter loves this.  Added just a little garlic the second time I made it.  We had an abundance of chard from the garden this summer, and this was a tasty way to enjoy this super-healthy green.

this was my first time cooking with swiss chard and I had no idea what to do. this recipe is so colorful, healthy and delicious, not to mention so simple to make. I did use some white onion as well, and minced garlic. Instead of regular olive oil, I used garlic infused. This added intensely to the flavor.

Great fresh & healthy taste.  I took the suggestions of sautéing garlic with the onions and added a can of diced tomatoes (drained) because I didn't have enough fresh. I ended up really liking it, but my hubby did not, and son wouldn't try it.  The chard cooked down so much I felt like it wasn't noticeable (not to hubby).  Not sure I'd add it to my list of regular meals, but if you need a recipe to use Chard it is great!

I liked it and I got my 15 year old son to eat it.  I didn't have any green onions or shallots, so that may have affected the flavor some,  but it was still good.  Loved the lemon juice.

Great recipe! Based on previous recommendations I added a healthy dose of cayenne pepper and crushed red pepper. I like more complex flavours too, so I added some diced garlic when I added the tomato and lemon juice, and topped it off with toasted pine nuts and crumbled cotija cheese at the last minute (I just had that cheese on hand, turned out lovely). Great cold too!
   Also, make sure you unzip the chard along the leaf/stalk, and coarsely chop the leaves, while finely chopping the stem, since the leaves cook faster.

Make this routinely.  It is fast, easy and very tasty as written.  I have also put in chicken and have used all sorts of beans.  The other tasty thing I add just to change it up is a little jerk seasoning.  It is a delicious and filling meal with the chicken.  Makes using your loads of chard easy!

I didn't have shallots or green onion, so I just used regular onion and cooked it down a little more. It was very good! I liked it cold with crusty bread for lunch the next day even more.

Great recipe and easy to make! I added garlic and it came out perfect!  As a main I would serve it with rice or orzo, it seemed somewhat lacking on its own.

What a delicious recipe! I made a few changes of my own (added feta, mushrooms) and a few changes recommended by others (doubled shallots, chickpeas and green onions). This really is a terrifically light and refreshing way to use up your swiss chard. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Surprisingly good! Only thing differently I did was used regular yellow onions, 1 can garbanzo beans, added garlic and mustard greens as well. I also sliced up a bunch of cherry tomatoes instead of one big tomato. I will keep this on hand!

Certainly an easy recipe. I make this with dried chickpeas in the pressure cooker, and use about triple the amount of chickpeas called for. The first time I overcooked it and the chickpeas turned mushy. The second time I reduced the cooking time, but my husband actually preferred the overcooked, "creamy" version! He gives it 5 stars, I give it 4. Definitely a recipe to make again.

This was absolutely one of the best vegetable dishes I have ever eaten! I had never tried Swiss chard before, but I picked some up at the store because it looked so beautiful. It was the Northern Brights variety and the stalks were yellow, magenta and orange. This recipe was beautiful to look at and amazing to eat! I added 2 cloves of garlic and the juice of half a lime instead of lemon. I also used an entire can of garbanzos. I will make this again and again! Thank you so much for this healthy recipe!

I needed to use a big bunch of (what I thought was) swiss chard.  Once cooked, I actually think it was spinach.  Regardless, this was really good.  I did not have shallots, and added about 5 green onions, a whole can of garbanzo beans and a whole can of diced tomato.  I could have easily used more greens because they cook down so much.  I really liked this, the ingredients really go together well : )

This is my new favorite chard recipe.  It's fast, easy, and healthy.  I used a young leek instead of green onions and minced garlic instead of a shallot, but otherwise followed the recipe.  It was a lot more flavorful than I had anticipated.

My first review but I love this recipe so much I had to. This is a great base recipe to substitute and tweak as you will. I have made this 2x in different ways and both times I loved it. The first time I stuck to the basic recipe except I used a garlic scape instead of garlic, added red pepper flakes, used 2 small onions in place of scallions/green onions, and canned tomatoes instead of fresh. The second time I made the same changes as above; in addition added cumin seeds when cooking the onion and used fresh tomatoes this time. I had no garbanzo beans so I used 1 1/2 cups cooked lentils and 1 cup cooked wheat berries that I needed to use up. Delicious!!! It had an exotic taste such as one would find in a Northern Indian or some such restaurant and it was filling enough to be a main dish (with one legume and one whole grain it's great for vegetarians). It still could use some spicing up, I think next time I will add turmeric. I also think beet greens would work nice as a substitute for the chard.

I used 2/3 of can of diced tomatoes, I sauteed the chard stems with the beans, and I added chopped linguini to make it more appealing to my family (it worked).  Chopped leaves went it last.  Will make again, and maybe use a whole can of garbanzo beans to make it into an entree.

Excellent!  Substituting Kale works wonderfully too (add a tsp of sugar to sweeten).  I used the whole can of beans as well and added some Cayenne to give it a little kick.  Husband says its a keeper.

SENSATIONAL!!! My family is full of meat lovers but I wanted to try something different. This was perfect! I added a little garlic (abt. a tsp) with diced yellow onion substituted for the shallot, and the green onions. I also doubled the recipe. We will definitely put this into our regular rotation.

Soooooo good. Added a little bit of chilli flakes and after I tried it I did add a little feta and preferred that.  This is a keeper for sure. Thanks Syd.

Took another's advice and added couple shakes of red pepper flakes and about 1/2 tsp of cayenne. I also added sweet yellow bell pepper.  Delicious.  I love it super hot, so I covered it all with siracha. LOVED the sweet/hot.  Will definitely eat this again!

I had to add my own special twists to this recipe. I used 1 T bacon grease and 1 T olive oil. I had no shallots so I used 1/2 C of chopped sweet onion, 2 cloves of garlic, minced and 3" of a garlic scape, (the top flower bud of a garlic plant, courtesy of my CSA's, community supported agriculture shares). It should be 2 bunches of Swiss Chard, I didn't have 2 so I added 1 bunch of spinach at the very end. I used a large tomato, a full can of garbanzo beans, and a whole small lemon. I finished with sea salt to taste. Next time I might add a little goat cheese to the top to finish. Delicious !

My boys love this meal. I used collards tonight; whatever greens I have work. In place of the shallot, I used a yellow onion. Oh, and you can TOTALLY put in a few more tomatoes ;) 
Fab idea, Syd!

I was super skeptical while cooking this, but was pleasantly surprised when I tasted it! Yum! I added garlic and used Vidalia onion instead of shallot because that's what I had. Also added feta at the end. It was my first time cooking/eating chard and I will definitely make again!

This is one of my favorite recipes to use up my Swiss chard and tomatoes from the garden.  The small addition of lemon juice at the end adds a great little bite.

Amazing! This dish is one of my new favorite things to eat. My three year old daughter said "wow, you made this mommy?", as she gobbled up a large portion. I diced the tomatoes. 

And I saved the stems and made a recipe from simple recipes site called Sauteed Swiss Chard Ribs with Cream and Pasta.

Delicious!

5 star for simplicity and taste. I must admit i was skeptical on this one: really? 5 stars for swiss chard? but, yeah, 5 stars for swiss chard! i had to substitute since it was a last minute, make-do-with-what-is-in-my-cupboard recipe. For the shallots and green onion, i used red onion, i never saute with olive oil (not healthy!) so i used 1T coconut oil and i added cayenne for a little spice (recommended from another reviewer) and loved it! I admit i feel funny giving it 5 stars after all this substituting, but i can only imagine what it would be like if stayed true to the recipe...yummy!

A friend from work gave me a bag of big leaves with red stems and I looked at her and asked what is it? .. Swiss Chard she said.. ( we dont grow this in the Philippines.. lol) Well after I found a recipe to cook it.. it turned out its a very good side dish for Fish.. and I can also use my fathers tomato that he grows from his garden.. Thank you Syd for the recipe...

Great recipe. I used kale instead of chard and served it over red quinoa. The lemon juice really makes this dish sing.

YUM! It's easy to use canned tomatoes or substitute in black beans. Also, a tip for leftovers: bake them with roasted eggplant and a healthy dose of mozzarella cheese in an 8x8 glass dish. Chard is amazing.

This was Amazing! I did add a lot of garlic, about 5 cloves, and extra garbanzo's. I also used rainbow swiss chard instead of red. I replaced the Olive oil with Coconut oil too. I steamed my veggies as well, except the beans. For the beans I used dried and cooked them ahead of time as they do take awhile. Then I combined it all together on the stove top in a pan with the coconut oil and garlic and tomato just until hot. I will certainly make this again : )

Absolutely delicious. I had to make a few adjustments to make do with what I had in our kitchen. Only had one regular onion so used that instead of shallots and green onions, used kidney beans instead of garbanzo and forgot the lemon! But still it was really good. I didn't cook the chard as much as I have in the past and it gave the recipe a crispy flavor. Very very good and healthy!

Wow, this was so quick and easy! It is so tasty. I omitted the beans, simply because I didn't have any on hand, but I will put them in the next time. I sprinkled a little Parmesan Cheese on top, so yummy! I can't wait to make this with Christmas dinner, or for New Years Eve. I think "greens" are supposed to be Good Luck for the New Year!

This is the first time that I have tried chard and it was delicious!  Next time, I will add more chard, as it cooks down quite a bit.  I added the stalk too, and served over pasta.

Pretty good. I decided to dice up some chicken breast and add it to the recipe. I also added taragon, basil and curry spice. Random, I know.   You can pretty much do what you want with this recipe, which makes it pretty great.

Really tasty and filling! I did onions and garlic instead of the shallots and green onions because that is what I had in the house, added kale with the chard, added toasted cumin and parsley for added flavor. Served it with a fried egg on top and some crusty bread.

This was yummy! I went ahead and used the whole lemon, (what was I gonna do with the other half?) and also added some fresh dill. Also I added about a quater cup of white wine to wilt the chard in. Easy!

I used black eyed peas instead of garbanzo beans. I also used 1 clove of garlic and a little bit of picante sauce. I used 1 small onion, instead of 1 shallot and 2 green onions. Well, I changed it a lot, but it was very tasty. I am sure the original recipe is tasty too. I served it with grilled Turkish meatballs.

I loved this. The hint of lemon was a great lasting flavor. I wish I had followed the directions to include the entire bunch of Chard. When I initially chopped the whole bunch it looked like too much so I held back. I also think next time I will add a crunchy topping... maybe some chopped almonds. I ate this as a main dish and used as a side for my husband we both really liked it and I'll definitely be making this for myself often.

I love this recipe!  It has become a staple dinner and I've found variations of it that work well too.  I've used spinach instead of the chard (when the chard was unavailable).  I've also used lentils and a grain mix from Trader Joes.  You really can't go wrong this recipe.

Really good use of the swiss chard we had in our CSA basket this summer. Only change I made was to use cannellini beans instead of the garbanzo, since that's what I had on hand.

This was amazing! I went to my local farmer's market and got some fresh chard, sweet tomatoes, candy onions and the sharpness of the chard with the sweetness of the tomatoes/onions was superb! The beans add a great texture. I made this for guests (which I do not like to try out "new" things on guests) but they loved it as well. I also added a little minced garlic as recommended.

Very good.   Even my husband liked it, and he's not a fan of garbanzo beans.  The only change I made was to add a large clove of garlic.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  Used dried garbanzos that I soaked overnight, and cooked earlier in the day - I prefer the taste to canned.  Didn't have any shallot or green onions so I used white onion and garlic instead.  Great flavours all around and, once the beans were soaked and cooked, really fast to prepare.  Oh, and soak the chard really well, if using fresh, to ensure all the "grit" is gone.

Agree w/ the other reviewers, recipe is good, but a bit bland. We added 3 cloves of garlic at the start with the shallots and green onion, as well as a few sprinkles of cumin. Could have still used a little more kick.  We also made a yogurt sauce with feta and lemon.  The pungency of the feta and creaminess of the yogurt worked well w/ the rest of the dish. I think using canned whole tomatoes with juice would be better than using a fresh tomato. Overall, turned out well, but it did lack that zing.

I love the idea of this recipe, but prepared as is, it's missing something. It definitely needs garlic, and some fresh herbs added at the end would be nice. Oregano would be delicious. Or instead of herbs you could add a touch of cumin. Bonus points for ease of preparation.

I usually like this kind of dish, but I found it very bland, even after adding garlic and some spice.

This recipe was so yummy!  I didn't have green onions or shallots on hand, so I minced some fresh garlic (maybe about 4-5 cloves), heated it in the oil and then followed the directions as is.  The fresh tomatoes add such a nice flavor and the garbanzo beans give it a hardy taste.  Definitely making this again.  Thanks!

This "Swiss Chard with Garbanzo Beans and Fresh Tomatoes" was a good way to change-up our greens. Thank you Syd for sharing your recipe. I think it will become a staple at our home.

Yum! I cooked it with half a yellow onion diced instead of the green onions. I used a can of Rotel Fire roasted diced tomato and green chilis instead of the fresh tomatoes. I added two garlic cloves diced and about 1/8 teaspoon of Italian seasoning. I know that is quite a few changes, but once again I really enjoyed this dish!

This is the first year I grew Swiss Chard in our garden.  In fact, I've never even tasted it before.  I tried this recipe as part of  last night's dinner and I am hooked on it!  It was amazing!  I will make this recipe again as I still have more to harvest and I will add this to next season's garden plan.
Sorry I didn't take a photo.  When I thought about it, we had finished it all.

I added some mushrooms while cooking the onions. I like how the tomatoes (grape) were still form. It added a nice sweet fresh light flavor to it. I sprinkled some feta cheese before serving.  Love it!

I followed all the advice given by other chefs--added garlic, cooked stems longer, etc., and my vegan daughter loved it.  She just returned yesterday from a school trip to Spain, where she got a little bougie on me, so I took her compliment as a strong endorsement of this recipe.  Thanks.

I made this recipe recently and was pleasantly surprise of how tasty yet simple it was.  This was my first time making swiss chard and it won't be my last.  My family loved it as well. It was very flavorful. I altered the recipe slightly, I did not have green onion therefore I used white onions and two gloves of garlic. Otherwise I  stayed close to the instruction. I will definitely be adding this to my rotations of healthy meatless side dishes.

So good.  For my husbands B-Day.  Made as a side dish to a tri-tip.    This was really good.  We eat greens a lot, and like chard because it cooks quicker than other greens like mustard.    This was a great combination.

After reading some reviews, I added garlic, basil, cumin seeds and I used canned tomatoes and cooked it in a little vegetable broth to add flavor. I ate it as a side dish and it was very good! My roommates said it smelled good too.

I used a full can of garbanzos and added some roasted turkey breast for a bit of extra protein.  It made a quick and easy way to use the fresh chard from my garden.  My wife and I both liked it, but might not make our regular rotation...

Really good base recipe. I will say that I added garlic, balsamic vinegar, smoked paprika, and basil to the recipe. It would have been way too bland without the extra ingredients. This is a keeper.

I took reviewers' advice and added onions, tomatoes, bacon, shrimp, garlic, zucchini, yellow squash, mushrooms.  I removed stems and chopped swiss chard in 1/4" slices and cooked a little longer.  lemon juice was a great finish.  Didn't have shallots, green onions, or chick peas, so used large green onions, garlic, and one can of cannellini beans.  Sorry for rating with so many changes, but think this was a great was to use garden veggies in summer.  Easy stove top one dish meal.

I made this with what I had on hand - it was delicious.  Sauteed an onion and cooked the Swiss chard stems.  Added a can of drained chick peas, can of stewed tomatoes, the chard leaves  and some raisins.  Simmered until the leaves were cooked.   The raisins gave it a nice sweetness.  Topped it with some toasted pine nuts.  Even my 9 yr old loved it.

Very tasty and a great way to get your greens and beans! I used a whole can of garbanzo beans, and I chunked the tomatoes rather than slicing them. I will try it again with spinach for variety.

This wasn't bad, but I wasn't crazy about it either. Might have been the texture of the beans, or maybe it was missing something, but I probably won't make again.

I added fresh cilantro, ground cumin and a bit of cayenne pepper to give it a bit of a "bite"...delicious!

This was great! I didn't use onions though because I love garlic. Crushed up about 5 cloves to stir in with the beans and chard leaves. Micro waved the chopped stems about 3-4 mins and added those. Tossed on a handful cherry tomatoes toward the end because that's all I had. Really pretty, quick side dish.

I was pleasantly surprised with how good this recipe is. I changed a few things with the ingredients. Instead of a shallots, I used 1/4 red onion and 1 minced garlic clove. I also used one can of diced tomatoes (drained) instead of a fresh tomato. I think the changes coupled with the lemon added a different kick to it. I will definitely make it again.

Yum! I accidentally added a whole can of chickpeas and used organic grape tomatoes (halved). I served over some noodles and topped with mozzarella- for the kids (yeah- that's the ticket). Pink Himalayan salt and fresh ground pepper was great. One of my kids preferred a lot of extra lemon juice and LOVED the garbanzo beans. (Maybe a little zest next time?) Great recipe! I don't get around to the red Swiss chard much beyond my juicer. 

Tip: Discard the stems of the chard, rinse thoroughly- rubbing each leaf with your fingers to remove dirt. Once chopped, rinse again while lightly tossing in a colander under cool water to remove any remaining dirt. Toss excess water off by lightly tossing in colander before wilting.

Great recipe, but tweaked by using more garbanzos, adding chopped garlic, and choosing heirloom cherry tomatoes cut in half. Yum!

This recipe was really simple and good.  I made a few modifications:  1) Added the cut up stems with the onions as they take longer to cook.  Used sprouted chickpeas cooked in veggie broth.  I added about 1/2 cup of the broth to the chickpeas and tomatoes to make a "stew".  Finally, threw in rosemary, thyme, parsley, and oregano from my garden and a bit of lemon zest.  Was great!

Fresh chard and tomatoes from the garden got me searching out new recipes . . . So glad I found this one. I LOVE THIS DISH!  The garbanzo beans really made this special and filling.

A huge hit with the family.  Used grape tomatoes and extra garbanzo beans.  Didn't have scallions or shallot, so used leeks instead.  Can't wait to make again.

I thought this was a quick and simple, full of flavor recipe. I was shocked that it was as flavorful as it was with just salt and pepper to season it with. Been on a garbanzo bean kick and this has become a favorite for myself, my friend, and even my kids.

I got swiss chard at the farmer's market yesterday since it looked so green and beautiful. However I did not know how to cook it, and just found this recipe and tried it today. Wow...Love it!!!!I got a lot of compliment from my family! I added soy source to this recipe and it turned out great for our asian bud! For my kids, I put shred cheese top on it and broiled....and my kids said "Yummmy!"

Love how quick and easy this recipe is.  I somehow used all my tomatoes earlier this week so I subtracted it as an ingredient and think this is great without.  Served it with brown rice and now I'm satisfied for the night.

This was fantastic! I made changes based on other reviews. I caramelized onions in a little veg stock, added finely chopped chard stalks, and garlic. Added Jerk seasonings, chopped chard leaves, (along kale and spinach, they needed to be used up), white beans, tomatoes, and served over a bulgar and whole wheat couscous medley that had a tomato base. It has so many big flavors, you would never guess it was a vegan-friendly meal. Will definitely be making this again soon!

I added extra garlic and used yellow onion because I didn't have shallots and green onions. I, too, used Fire Roasted Tomatoes with Garlic and I thought to add a few tablespoons of white wine. Thank you for the blend of garbanzos and chard! It was great!

I make this all the time. It's a great side dish for chicken or fish. Don't skip the lemon at the end. It's critical to the balance of the dish, really brings the flavours out.

I loved this. It was so easy to make, and simply delicious. I made it twice in one week. I added a fresh garlic clove, a little crushed red pepper, basil and oregano, both times. I also used extra beans. This was my first experience with Swiss chard, and I'm happy to have found this recipe. Thanks!

Just had this for lunch! It was the first time I've had Swiss Chard and it was quite yummy. I lowered the olive oil to two teaspoons along with a Tbs of veggie broth. I had to use grape tomatoes halved since I've run out of whole ones. Finally I used Mrs. Dash instead of salt; cutting back on that. I ate a little more than half the batch myself since it was my main dish with a little ground flax seed sprinkled on top. Very nice and filling. It's going in my make again notebook!

Yum! What an easy, healthy, delicious meal. I put this over whole wheat pasta and put in a whole can of garbanzos. I also added some minced garlic for a little extra flavor. I have made this recipe twice already, and I am making it again tonight. It's a huge hit with my boyfriend as well! The first time I made it, we had some goat cheese on hand so I topped the meal with that and it was a great addition. The second time, we had no cheese, but it was a tasty meal nonetheless.

This was an awesome way to use the Swiss Chard we got in our CSA boxes. The only things I changed was using garlic instead of a shallot and adding a little bit of chicken broth to the pan before adding the chard.  This helped to steam the leaves and added some good flavor.

Made it as a lunch to share with my cousin whom I had not seen for forty years. I am vegetarian, as is her partner. It was a hit. People thought they were eating gourmet. And it was so easy to prepare. It will work as well with kale as Swiss Chard. I tripled the recipe for more servings as a main dish.

Yum!  A friend gave me a huge bag full of Swiss Chard and I really didn't know what to do with it.  Wow!  Perfect!  LOVE this recipe.  I didn't have shallots, so I carmelized some red onion and I used a lime because that was all I had - it was still great!

We've never eaten Swiss Chard before, we recently signed up for a CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) program and this week we got some amazing swiss chard in our box. We tried this recipe and it was amazing! We substituted a lime since we didnt have a lemon in the fridge. It still turned out great! Thanks for sharing!

I had never cooked Swiss chard before and was looking for a simple, yet delicious recipe. This is the one. I wanted to use this as a main course, and I am not big on eating just greens. So, I used a whole can of Garbanzo beans, as others suggested, a can of diced tomatoes, 2 small cloves of garlic, and added rice to the mixture. It came out very tasty. My 2-year-old and my husband liked it, too. Next time, I will try it with orzo, instead of rice. Thank you for a delicious recipe!

Great vegetarian dish. The natural flavors of the chick peas and chard really come out in this dish. I like to serve it with one or two other vegetarian dishes (such as quinoa) for a complete meal.

Only 4 starts since I cooked it in bacon which isn't called for.  Great dish, though!

Recipe yielded a better-tasting swiss chard than my usual sauteing in olive oil and garlic.  Much less bitter.  I used diced tomatoes in place of fresh tomato.  I skipped the shallot because I didn't have any, but used the green onions.  Another keeper recipe.

Very good! Swiss chard, garbanzo beans and tomatoes are a wonderful combination! I have never ate swiss chard before and this dish was an excellent introduction to swiss chard. Easy to make! Swiss chard really shrinks when cooking! ! !

This recipe is extremely tasty and clearly okay for people who are culinarily challenged (the first veggies I've cooked in about three years. Sad but true). I used four large swiss chard leaves, a whole can of garbanzos, and two roma tomatoes. Also threw in some garlic with the onions at the beginning, and cayenne paper to taste. Thank you!

This was delicious and easy!  I used garlic and a small onion instead of shallot. I used a can of diced tomatos and a whole can of garbanzos.  Also added a little Bragg's Liquid Aminos to give it salt(could use soy sauce).  Ate it over couscous for a vegetarian main dish.  Yum!

I had never eaten swiss chard, garbanzo beans or shallots prior to making this recipe.  It was an easy recipe and the lemon juice was the perfect final touch.  I will definitely make this regularly.

Delicious! I added a whole (15 oz) can of garbanzos as I served this over rice as the main dish. I used organic chard and sea salt, and it was so flavorful, I will be making this on a regular basis.

I loved this recipe!  Easy to prepare and a pleasant combining of flavors and textures.  I thought the 4 serving yield was a bit of a stretch though but that may be more my use of it as main course on top of udon noodles.  Next time I will use more tomatoes and wedge them rather than slice them.

fresh, simple flavors that work well together; i loved it. added garlic (you gots to have garlic!) and used the whole can of chickpeas because i didn't know what to do with the rest of the can. make sure not to overwilt the chard; if done right, it retains some texture. the colors of this dish are bright and made for attractive plating when paired with baked fish.

i love this recipe.  It comes out great as is, but is also very easy to adapt to whatever you have in your fridge.  Sometimes I add cubed roasted butternut squash when I'm serving it as a main meal and it's delicious.  After roasting, I cube the squash and add it in with the tomatoes and lemon juice.  Yum!!

Very tasty and satisfying. I substituted white beens for the garbanzos and added fresh garlic. It reheats well for lunches, too. I am a new subscriber to a local/organic produce box and had never cooked chard before. This recipe is being saved to my recipe box.

This dish balances beautifully - the lemon at the end really makes it.  This recipe is quite easy and tastes great. I basically doubled the recipe and added garlic, because I am a garlic fiend, but this recipe is perfect just as it is written!

Healthy & surprisingly very tasty!  I added cannellini beans and used lime juice instead of lemon (all I had) plus a little red wine vinegar.  I also added a few stale pieces of rye bread which turned into yummy dumplings.  Served the whole thing with tiny toast squares and it was perfection!

Really great way to use swiss chard which in my opinion is one of the most beautiful and healthful veggies there is.  My son wasn't a fan of the lemon but I thought it balanced the bitterness of the chard.  The garbonzo beans (aka chickpeas) added creaminess but I actually think it could do without the tomatos if you don't like them.  I served with some roast turkey breasts and whole wheat dinner rolls for a really nice, easy dinner.

This dish was pretty good - I used kale instead of swiss chard. I think next time I will use cannelini beans or some other bean because I am just not a fan of the texture of garbanzo beans.

I don't agree with those who think this is too bland.  It isn't covered in spice, so you really taste all of the ingredients. I thought it was really good and will make again.  Only changes I made were adding onions and garlic and a little cayenne in the first step, and at the end I added some cooked pasta to make it a full meal.  Really tasty.

This was a wonderful base recipe with plenty of room for additional flavor options. Took suggestions from others and created a wonderful dish. I sauted white onion, lots of garlic, added the beans, then threw in the chard.  After partly wilted I added some green and red sweet bell peppers that I had left over from a previous meal. Just before serving, added the lemon,black olives,tomatoes,   goat cheese, and fresh parsley from my herb garden finished it off.

I used collard greens instead of chard since that is what I had. I added more garbanzo beans too. Very nice combo of flavors. Pretty and healthy.

This was soooo good!  I didn't have any onions or shallot, but I used a few cloves of garlic instead.  I also added some red pepper flakes and this was a huge hit!!

Healthy, easy and delicious. This was very good as written and could be adjusted many ways depending on what you have on hand or just personal preferences. I always like recipes for greens that make them less boring.

Perfect!  It's the end of Nov and this was the last of the swiss chard from my
garden.  Of course being Nov, I didn't
have fresh tomatoes so I used a can of
stewed tomatoes.  This was to be a side
dish for supper.  Instead it became supper. Ladymildred was right - this
could be meal unto itself, and last night it was.  Kudos, Syd, kudos.

This fresh meal was so good I ate the whole thing in one sitting.  It would go well as a family side, or as a whole meal by itself.  It wants to be eaten right away, as reheating wouldn't work with this one.  Truly enjoyable!

great and flexible recipe... use more or less garbanzos(chickpeas) etc....just use your imagination and taste to modify it... as some did with garlic and/or cayenne... the fresh tomato was a nice contrast to the cooked veggies

This was ok.  I'm not a swiss chard lover, so that's probably why I didn't love it.

I was pleasantly surprised to find this to be a hearty side dish, and tasty, too! I ventured on this because I needed to include green leafy vegetables and legumes for a nutritional diet during pregnancy. It was really yummy. I love chard now and I'm going to keep this in my repertoire of healthy meals. Thx!

My neighbor gave me wonderful swiss chard from her garden, inspiring me to try this recipe.  I liked the addition of the Garbanzo beans and tomatoes alot.  I added several cloves of fresh garlic, juice and zest from half a lemon to brighten-up the heaviness of the swiss chard.  Was great served with pork roast and mashed potatoes.  Worth a try for something different.

I have made this recipe several times and it is always a big hit. Throwing in some hot chili paste which gives it a really nice kick. I have also made this without the beans and served it as a burger condiment.

Nice combo of veggies and good way to eat those leafy greens.  Subbed sliced yellow bell pepper because I was short on tomato.  The squeeze of lemon at the end really gives it a satisfying zing.
