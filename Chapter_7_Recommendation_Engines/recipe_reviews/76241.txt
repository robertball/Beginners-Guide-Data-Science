These were super easy to make.  If you like soft and chewy chocolate chip cookies, you will love these.  They are more like cake than a traditional cookie, but they taste great.  I used Splenda Brown Sugar and they turned out perfect.

These were spectacular! Usually Splenda cookies are more cake-like, but these spread like regular cookies and were chewy and yummy!  I did add a teaspoon of cinnamon, substituted 1/2 cup whole wheat flour for part of the all-purpose, and used 2/3 cup chocolate chips and 1/3 cup cinnamon chips.  My husband, who generally rejects anything "healthy or low-anything" actually loved them!

I used the Splenda Brown Sugar and also added a little extra chocolate chips (although it doesn't need it).  Mine did come out a little cake-like, but that doesn't affect the taste. These cookies taste even better than when I try to make regular choc. chip cookies. I will make these again!

I did not like it that much. I baked one tray for 15 min and it over cooked so i decreased the time to 12 mins and it came out cakey .

My hubby and I are changing our eating lifestyle and have decided to cut down on sugar. We both love cookies (he's a "cookie monster"!), so I looked for cookie recipes on the Splenda website. I made these and we really love them! Just make sure you store them in the refrigerator (we put them in a ziploc bag) and they'll stay soft and fresh longer.

I have made these cookies twice and have used regular chocolate chips then used miniature sugar free chips and I have to admit I like them both ways. I really like the cake-like because they are so soft. I don't like a hard or crunchy cookie. I did only get about 30 cookies out of this recipe, but if I would have made the cookies smaller I would have gotten more. If I need more cookies I will just double the recipe. I give this recipe 5 stars and will definately make them again.

These cookies are AWESOME! I made them for a newly-diebetic uncle and he was just THRILLED! I had some too, they were just as good (if not better) than non-splenda cookies. I wish I could give it more than 5 stars!

I loved this recipe so much! My family ate them up like crazy and they are not hardcore sugar haters like me. I also substituted the brown sugar for splenda blended brown sugar and the butter for I can't believe its not butter, and they were the best chocolate chip cookies I have made in a long time. 
Will make these forever! So good, this is coming from  and ex-sugar addict.

BIg Key is to keep them on the small size.  I found the smaller cookies (3" around" were a much better consistancy then the ones that are bigger...bigger ones are cake-y smaller ones are def. choc-chip cookie consistancy. Taste is good all around though. A good cookie!

This chocolate chip cookie recipe was WONDERFUL!  The only bad thing about this recipe was that we ate them in two days...
I really like cookies that are more cake-like, so I enjoyed them a lot.  They made 24 cookies instead of 36, and I think it's because I used Splenda Brown Sugar Blend instead of brown sugar.  If you use Splenda Brown Sugar - you use less of it because it's twice as sweet.  I would highly recommend this recipe - and I will make this again!  I might try adding oatmeal or butterscotch chips next time.

Pretty darn good for a recipe with no white sugar. I made these to add to gift baskets for Christmas for my relatives that are on a restricted diet. Mine turned out more cake-like than the picture shows, but I had to use real butter instead of margarine because it is all I use. I also used bright silver cookie sheets.

All i can say is AMAZING!!!  I think they taste just as good as regular chocolate chip cookies.  I used the Splenda sugar & then I used Splenda Brown Sugar Blend, but I used a little less than the amount that was called for.  Everything else I left the same....but I will definitely make this again!!!!

I thought the batch was too small so I doubled it.  Still didn't make to much.  The cookies were very bread-like, did I miss something or is it suppose to be like that?  Overall, I wouldn't make another cookie with splenda ever again.

Perfect!  These are a little bit cakier than a standard chocolate chip cookie. They get slightly crisp on the edges and remain soft on the inside.  My husband and his female coworkers gobbled them up.  All agreed the recipe was a keeper.

I live at 9500 feet so made adjustments for high altitude - the batter barely survived the get to the oven - my granddaughters loved it from the start.  For high altitude you need to do the following - Oven temp is 345 deg F,cook time is 12 or so min, 1/2 cup splenda brown sugar, 1 1/2 cup plus 2 T all purpose flour, and use almost 1/4 tsp salt and almost 1 tsp baking soda- (that's a scant measure as I call it).  And make the cookie size teaspoon instead of tablespoon. I also used parchment paper on my cookie sheet to get a more even browning. 5+++++ STARS FROM MY HUSBAND AND GRANDKIDS.

I made this recipe a couple of days ago and it is nearly gone!  I used regular dark brown sugar as I wasn't sure which "packed brown sugar" to use, regular or Splenda.  And I used a little more than 1 cup of chocolate chips.  Anyhow, the cookie came out cake-like, "fluffy" almost as good tasting as a Nestle Toll House chocolate chip cookie!!!  Except the batter didn't produce 36, I only got about 30 out of it.

I will DEFINITELY make this recipe again!!!

I made these cookies with one exception, I used white whole wheat flour instead of all purpose flour.  My husband is diabetic and he thinks cookies are part of everyones daily diet so I am looking at ways to make them better for him.  They tasted good to me and he will love them because I will let him eat them and not yell so much at him for eating sweets or carbs.

These cookies came out soft and cake like rather then regular chocolate cookies. I was dissapointed but we still enjoyed them. I'll stick to Nestle Tollhouse chocolate chip cookies.

i just made these i read all the reviews and made a couple changes to see if i could lose some of the cake like part and we have great success.
i used shortening instead of the margerine.and i also used 6 tablesppons of the splenda brown sugar and they turned out absolutlely awesome!!! my family cant tell the difference in the two kinds of cookies i have  finally found a recipe that complients my own cookie recipe ( way better then toll house)and there are much better for my daughter  who has metabolic syndrum and on the edge of diabeties. thank you splenda !!!!

My brother loved these, but I thought they were a bit spongey. For some reason I find most low cal cookies do come out that way, but they were definately one of the better sugar substitute recipes I have tried. For some reason it also made much more than 36 cookies and I made them average sized.

These were GREAT!  I only used 5 Tbsps + 1 tsp of Splenda Sugar Blend and regular flavor shortening (what i had on hand).  I also just used regular brown sugar.  I did have to watch the time, I cooked them for about 8 min. (and I live at high elevation).  My husband loved them and couldn't believe that I made them with Splenda!!

tried these today and cannot tell the difference from my regular recipe.  i used Splenda for baking (instead of regular Splenda) and Splenda brown sugar
and used egg beaters instead of eggs. i also added about 2 1/2 c oatmeal. i cooked them a couple of minutes longer so they wouldn't be as soft as some of the reviews have mentioned, and they had the same consistency as regular recipe, crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  will definitely make again

Very good.  Followed directions exactly and had no problems.  Could taste a little Splenda after taste but it did not take away from the cookie.  Will make again.

These were amazing!! I wasn't sure they would end up like regular chocolate chip cookies, but they taste exactly the same! They're a little more cake-like than cookies, but they're still delicious. I used Splenda brown-sugar blend instread of brown sugar but half as much as was called for. They taste great and I feel great!

My husband and I were surprised at how good these cookies are.  They are soft, moist and easy to make.  This is our new chocolate chip cookie recipe!

I substituted a scant 1/3 C granulated Splenda + 1 T molasses for the brown sugar; I substituted 3/4 C of the all-purpose flour with 3/4 C whole wheat flour; I substituted Egg Beaters for the eggs. All I can say is YUM! Cake-y, chocolately and delicious.

I used the spenda granulated and substituted the spenda brown sugar for the regular brown sugar and the recipe came out perfect.  Very good!!!  You can double this recipe.

This was a really good recipe!  I know from using Splenda in the past often things like cookies come out TASTING alright, but the cookies just crumble!  THIS cookie STAYS TOGETHER.  I love that!  lol  It's like a dense cake really, good flavour.  I would prefer something that was more "heavy".  cookies often are heavier in texture.  But the flavour is great, stays together, I would make again!  :)  Thanks for the recipe.  (there's a new chocolate chip recipe using the Splenda Brown sugar blend on the www.splenda.com website.  I can't try it myself, they don't sell that in Canada, but next time I get accross the border I may pick up a bag, and give it a whirl.  Supposed to be less carbs, all the flavour of brown sugar.  Man we need canada to get that!  lol).

I made this recipe with 3/4 C Splenda and 1/4 C of regular brown sugar and the cookies were great!  I would highly recommend this recipe!
