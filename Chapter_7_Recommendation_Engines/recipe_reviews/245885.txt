My original review I rated this recipe  3 stars  after  it sat in the refrigerator for two hours. At that point neither my husband or I liked the cake. We thought it had an odd texture and was not sweet enough. I was going to throw the cake out last night, but, ran out of time and thought I would do it tonight. We decided to give it one more try tonight. What a difference after sitting overnight! The cake  was saturated with the milk mixture and was perfectly sweet and yummy. So, so happy I did not throw this out yesterday! Piece of advice if you're going to make this cake I would definitely let it sit overnight because it is so much better.

Excellent. This recipe was easy enough for my 8 year old to genuinely help instead of just watching. This tasted better than a mango-kiwi tres leches cake I made years before. We did add a bit of cherry juice in the whipped topping and the cake batter for a delicious result.

I'm basing the rating on my family's reaction - I didn't like it much, thought it was way too sweet and faintly eggy smelling. But everyone else loved it, so may make it again. It definitely improves the longer you leave it in the fridge to soak up the milk.

Not sure if it was because I only let it sit for 2 hours but it was not as saturated as I was hoping for. Growing up in SoCal, I've tasted tres Leches cakes before, so was looking for a more spongey, wet crumb. This cake, while flavorful, felt denser than anticipated. It was still good, but the almond flavor was stronger than the cherry flavor, and I would have preferred the opposite.

I made it exactly as directed.    I thought it was ok.   My neighbor thought it was wonderful.   I will probably try it one more time.   Maybe adding a little vanilla or a little more sugar.   It just seemed like it needed something.
