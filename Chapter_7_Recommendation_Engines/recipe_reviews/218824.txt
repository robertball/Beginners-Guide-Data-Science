We had Mexican Night with our neighbors and I had to bring an appetizer. Searched this wonderful site and found Sizzlin' Santa Fe Dip. And so glad I did. Everyone raved about this dish and wants the recipe. I did change a few things. Because I knew not all my neighbors like hot and spicey I used mild sausage and 1 jar of mild salsa. I did use 1 can of refried beans. I also put 1 cup of shredded cheese into the mix before I baked it and used another cup on top. I did not put the chopped tomatoes or the green onions on until I arrived at the party.

This was quick, easy and delicious. I will certainly make this dish again and again but will use the hot and spicey ingredients for my family.

Excellent as written. Great for gatherings when you want something different from the normal appetizers.
