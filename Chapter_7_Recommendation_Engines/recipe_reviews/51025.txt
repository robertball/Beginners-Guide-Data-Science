This is a fantastic, easy way to enjoy corn on the cob.  I generally microwave 2 minutes, on high, per cob.  It is fast, simple, and tastes the same as boiled corn.  Be sure to wrap in the damp paper towels as this helps steam the corn.

We've always boiled our corn on the cob, however after reading other reviewers comments here, I convinced my wife to let me microwave them this time. She was sceptical at first, but we both agree now that microwaving brought out better taste in the corn. 
Instead of wrapping in a wet paper towel however, we simply pulled back the husk to expose about 3/4 of the cob, cleaned out the tassel, rinsed the cob liberally inside and out, then pulled the husk back around the cob.
We microwaved two at a time for 2:15 minutes, turned them over, and did them for another 2:15 mins. 
If you're doing more than two cobs, leave them to continue to steam in their husks until they're all done. 
Then remove the husk and serve.

You can also do this by husking the corn, putting it into a pyrex dish with a tablespoon of water, and covering the dish with plastic wrap, leaving a corner open for steam to escape. Two ears of corn, 8 minutes in my microwave.

Microwaving is our favorite method now.  Learned this at Weight Watchers about 5 years ago and unless I need to feed a crowd or want to make Frogmore Stew, we never boil it anymore.  Leave the corn in the husks, cut off any floppy silks, and microwave 2-3 minutes per ear.  Two ears are ready in 5 minutes in our microwave, but it will vary.  And the silks just fall off.  The corn is so moist and naturally sweet that we often just skip the butter.

This recipe is terrific. I was looking for an easy-cleanup way to cook corn-on-the-cob, and this is it. I tried it twice, both times with 3 ears of corn at the same tiem.  Ten minutes was too long, and 8 minutes turned once halfway through was just right.

I wrap a dry towel around ear of corn and then wet. It's easier then trying to get a limp wet towel around ear.

This couldn't have been any easier, not to mention great tasting!  After nuking it in the microwave, I removed the paper towels, buttered the corn and then nuked it in the microwave for a minute longer.  PERFECT!

Works like a charm! I can't even tell the difference between this and boiled corn. Since I normally only cook for myself and sometimes one or two other people, this makes more sense than boiling the water and doing it the traditional way.

Since microwave ovens vary in wattage, the directed cooking time is not necessarily accurate.  Saving a few minutes by not having to put a kettle of water on the stove was not worth the guesswork of knowing when the corn was done.  I didn't find this method any easier and, frankly, I still prefer cooking the corn for a few minutes in boiling water with a little sugar added.

Why shuck the corn? I microwave my corn in the husks.  The husks act just like the plastic wrap and they will keep the corn hot for quite a while.  Also, the corn is easier to shuck after it's been microwaved.  The silk just slides   right off!

Two ears, 6 minutes, PERFECT corn on the cob!  No fuss, no waiting for water to boil, no wasted water!  I tried it like the recipe the first time and it worked great!  The second time, I left the husk on with the ends trimmed per other reviewers & it worked even BETTER!  No wasted paper towels.  :)  Thank you for sharing this simple recipe for quick & easy corn on the cob!  A keeper for sure!

Have tried microwaving corn several ways. The easiest and best way is to husk ears, place side by side in rectangular glass dish and add just a bit of water. Cover with plastic wrap and microwave 3 minutes per ear. Absolutely perfect evey time!

There is a much better way.  Leave the ear in the husk and microwave it for 4 minutes per ear (8 minutes for 2 ears).  When done put on a cutting board and cut off the stem end up about 1 1/2 inches.  Now hold the silky top side (with a towel or something so you don't burn yourself) and shake the ear out the end you cut off.  It will shake right out without any silk left on the ear.  ENJOY

I was at my parents for dinner a week ago and my Mom just showed me that for a while now, she's been cooking their corn on the cob in the microwave... I was shocked!  It's PERFECTION!  I put four ears, cleaned and bare, in a gallon size baggie.  Seal the baggie closed leaving a tiny spot open for very little steam to escape, I cook the four ears for 8 minutes in my microwave and they are wonderful!  I will probably never boil my corn again!

I did two ears at the same time in the husk and silk and wrapped in a paper towel. I cooked for 5 minutes. Maybe another 30 seconds would have been better, but the corn was great. I can definitely agree that microwave is the way to go.

By the way, the cooking time, of course, depends a lot on the power of your microwave oven. Ergo, I suggest that in microwave recipes and reviews that we put in the power rating of the microwave oven used. Mine is 1100 watts.

Can't remember the last time I dealt with having to boil the water and have another pot to wash.  Not only does the paper towels, cooking in husks work in the micro but you can loosley wrap fresh or frozen corn in wax paper.  I also nuke the butter in a dish in the micro and pass it around with a pastry brush - everyone seems to get a kick out of being an artist!!! and it goes on more easily than using hard butter.  I also put out different spices like cayenne pepper, chili powder, curry, black pepper, salt, thyme, etc.  Everyone puts out different things for pizza - try it with corn on the cob.

Microwave in husk for 8 minutes. Move to cutting board and cut the ear across at the thickest point. Lift ear by silks end and shake ear out gently. Voila! No silks to strip!!

I cooked 5 ears for 10 minutes in the husks in my 1200 Watt microwave without wrapping them in anything at all, and they were very good.  I did turn them this time halfway through.  The only prep I did was to remove the outermost husk of each ear and twisted off the top silks.  As soon as they are done, I remove them from the microwave, let them set a couple of minutes, take them to the sink and remove the outer husks, twisting off at the bottom.  Then I quickly run them under running warm water to remove the remaining silks, pile the ears on a paper towel lined plate to drain, and eat!  Fresh super sweet corn was wonderful, especially since it was so quick and easy!

I do a similar thing to cook corn. I use fresh cleaned corn, use a heavy duty plastic bag (ziplock or other - even food wrap and wrap it around) rinse corn and leave wet then nuke it for 2 minutes for 1 ear.  I have done as many as 6 ears in a large bag at once.  Cooked it about 6 minutes.  Microwaves vary so test first. (mine is pretty powerful)
SO easy and so good!  You can leave it the bag, wrap bag with a towel until ready to eat and it stays pretty hot.  No mess!

I hadn't planned on writing a review, on something as simple as Microwave Corn on the Cob, but as easy as this was, and since it saved me from having to wash out a pot, you've got to give credit, where credit is due.  That was tasty, and something I'll do over and over again; good job Cheri, and thanks.  Five Stars, and Two Thumbs Up.

Have never thought to microwave corn on the cob...but I'm a believer! Took another reviewer's suggestion and just put the entire cob--husk and all--into the microwave for 3 minutes, let it cool about 5 minutes, then pulled the husk and silk off in one fell swoop. Tasty and so much easier than my normal method!

No need to use paper towels if you have husks still on. If you have corn still in the husk, peel off a couple of the drier outer leaves, pull off the clump of threads hanging off the top, wash it a bit, put it on a plate and microwave for approx 2 mins per ear (smaller size ear is what I tested on). When done peel off husk (use gloves - it's HOT!) and threads will come right off too. DELICIOUS and soo easy!   Never thought you could microwave corn with such wonderful results! Thanks for posting - and thanks for the reviews tthat had this suggestion!

Followed other reviewers' advice and cut off the silk on the end of the cob, peeled off some of the outer husk (so you're basically steaming the cob) and microwaved on high for six minutes for two ears of corn.  Every bit as good as boiled corn, with no heating up the kitchen or a dirty pot to wash after dinner.  Very good!

Just thought I'd review this recipe, since I've been making corn on the cob in a similar way for years. What I do, is peel back the husks (but not remove them) and smear the corn with a stick of butter. One stick can do many ears of corn! Then, I 'wrap the corn' back up in the husks, wrap with wet paper towels and then plastic wrap - then cook in microwave. This is the best way I have found to cook corn on the cob, the butter melts and gets down 'in the cracks' of the corn. Tastes delicious!
P.S. If you want to make your corn using my method, you'll need to cut the 'silk' off with scissors - or remove the husks completely, then remove the silks. Place the husks back on - the butter will make them stick and the paper towel/plastic wrap will keep it in place.

Easy and excellent! Followed the directions except that with my microwave 2 cobs at 6 minutes is perfect-turning the cobs after 3 minutes. A little butter spray and salt...then enjoy!

I hate that I am just now learning this method. Its a quick and easy way to get that great boiled corn taste and texture quickly and without the mess. As per other reviews I cooked them individually wrapped in the wet paper towel for 2 minutes for larger ears and 1 min 30 sec for smaller ears. Will make again for sure!

I've always ( for at least 10 years or more) microwaved my corn on the cob in the microwave.  People would make fun of me saying "that's how you cook your corn" till this day, it's still a favorite.  I place mine in a Freezer bag with a little butter and garlic salt; shake it around and bake to desired tenderness ...it's fabulous!

Badda bing...badda bang...no muss no fuss...and NO HOT BOILING WATER steaming up the house!!  It's breaking heat records in our area at the moment yet the drive to eat fresh corn is high.  Delicious cooked corn in 4 min 30 seconds. YES! It's that easy.  After reading the reviews I put 2 lg ears (husked) in a flat corningware casserole dish.  Covered it with Saran wrap (vented up a tiny corner).  I gave it 2:15 seconds on each side, and it was done to sweet perfection!

This is by far the best and easiest way to eat corn on the cob. You won't believe the super easy and CLEAN way to shuck your corn after nuking it.  Just remove the ear from the microwave, cut off the stalk end right above where the corn starts, grab the ear, husk & silk, by the top and give it a few shakes.  The whole ear will slide out totally clean and ready to eat and all the husk & silk is still in your hand ready for the trash can.

I leave the corn in the husk to microwave it. I remove the corn immediately and cut the stalk end off of the corn about 1/4" before the husk slopes toward the stalk. I then hold the silk end of the husk up and shake the husk. The corn will slip out with all the silk removed. Every once in a while it might require a slight tug.

Easy smeasy!! I forego the damp paper towel and wrap my corn in plastic wrap. It steams the same way and if we don't eat all the cobs, I can just toss them into the fridge for the next day!  I wrap each cob individually with plastic wrap and cook 4 at a time for about 10 minutes. I point their tips to the middle and arrange them in a circle (or square) position. I check to see if they feel steamed and if not, cook for another 2 minutes....they tend to keep steaming in the plastic well after the cooking time anyway.  They will be extremely hot if you serve immediately, so I usually cook them beforehand, they stay nice and hot for a long time.  Each person removes the plastic wrap themselves, when the corn is on their plate.

I'm tellin you this is the way to go.  I know it sounds like sacrilege, but it's better than grilling.  P.S. if the corn is still hard, it needs more time.

I have been using the Ziplock Steamer bags to cook corn in the m/wave, you don't need to wet and wrap in paper towel, just throw it in the bag with butter and seasoning for 7 minutes (2 per bag) and it is perfect.  I also found corn in my grocery store last week, already cleaned and in a tray, you just throw the whole thing in the m/wave and cook, either way is easy and the corn taste great. Never boil on the stove again.

This was a great recipe.  It was super easy and really fast.  I followed the directions pretty closely...I had two ears so I put it in 2 minutes at a time for 6 minutes total and then spread the butter and then added 30 more seconds of time.  Great Recipe...will try again

This is easy, but I have an easier one: Cut off most of tassel and stalk (nearly up to ear). Shuck corn, leaving about two thicknesses of shuck, and all the silk. Microwave for about 2 min. per ear (can do up to 4 at a time--total time for 4 = 5 min.). Remove carefully (very hot) and finish shucking, using hand protection. Silks come off easily and completely. Unshucked ears can be left in turned-off microwave so as to keep hot for second helping. Cay from FL

This is how I cook corn, except I leave it in the husk. I usually have to microwave it, 3 at a time, for about 5 minutes.    Very good corn!

Our grill ran out of propane so I was looking for a good recipe for boiling corn on the cob and I'm so glad I found this one! I microwaved 3 ears of corn wrapped in separate wet paper towels for 7 mins and I was PERFECT! My boyfriend couldn't get over how great they tasted! I think he even liked it better than when I make them on the grill! So easy!

I leave my husks on and microwave.  The husks seem to let them steam and stay warm.  Much better than bringing out that huge pot and waiting for water to boil.  Thanks for the recipe.

In my experience, corn the cob requires only 2 minutes on High per ear.  I microwave two ears at a time and set the timer for 4 minutes.  Perfect every time.

I always microwave in the husk.  I soak the corn first for 10-15 mins in the sink and and then pop into the microwave for 5 mins (3-4 ears of corn).  The husks and silk come right off, but it's very hot.  I use a potholder to hold the corn.  This is so easy and so yummy.

This seems like a great idea, but I just take the corn on the cob and peal back some of the husk, not all of it and microwave it on high for 3 minutes per ear, it tastes awesome and the corn silk seems to come off the ear much easier that way.  But like was said before in another post....be careful it is very very hot!

Too much fuss.  Just put corn in microwave (husk and all!!).  Microwave 5 minutes for 1 corn, 6 min for 2.  When done put on an oven mitt and peal back husk.  This stays moist AND keeps the corn taste.  KEEP IT BASIC!!  Also good on a campfire like this.

Wow. This couldn't have turned out better. I did the paper towel method, since one of the ears was half shucked at the store. I broke them in half and then they easily wrapped in one tear off half sheet of paper towel. 5 minutes exactly for two ears (four half ears) worked great! So sweet. I will never boil again!  One hint: be sure to unwrap the corn at the time you plan to eat them, I left one ear wrapped up and when I unwrapped it 10 minutes later it was a tad wrinkly (though still yummy).

Fabulous!  I did 3 cobs at 2 minutes per cob and it was perfect.  No more boiling corn for me.  I read about the Ziploc bag trick and it sounds convenient but I personally wouldn't do that - you're risking the chemicals leaching from the plastic into your corn - use the paper towel as the recipe states.

EASY! When I'm only cooking for one or two and dont want to boil water or start up the grill- this is my go to recipe. Per other reviews, I pulled the husk 3/4 down and drenched the corn, rolled up the husks and put 2 in the micro for 5 minutes.

My daughter was the only one that wanted corn on the cob - so, I tried this quick recipe.  Followed directions, but only cooked 1 cob, so only microwaved for 3 minutes.  Worked great.  Will use this fast method again.

This tastes far better than boiling, but we do it a little different, and it's really good... instead of using damp paper towels or the husks, we peel and clean the corn, and wrap it in saran wrap with chunks of butter inside. Definitely not the healthiest way to do it, but it tastes awesome!

As far as the recipe goes - if you follow it to the letter - it's terrible.  5 minutes is way too long.  I wish I would have read the rest of the reviews before trying it.

This is the definition of easy cooking.  It's quicker and more green (energy-wise) than boiling.  Plus, the taste is better.

I cook corn on the cob in the husk for 5 or so minutes (depending on how many ears are in the mic). I remove the ears with a hot pad and let them rest  for a few minutes. I use paper towels to strip the husks and "hair" off. It is so much easier than removing the husks prior to cooking.

This worked pretty good. I usually do my corn on the cob in the microwave; Just husk the corn, wrap it in clear plastic wrap, leave the ends open, and then microwave 3 minutes per ear. It comes out perfect every time. The most I have done at one time is 3. The clear wrap keeps them hot for a long time also. 

I would still use this recipe though, anytime I don't have clear wrap available!

Hey, you stole my recipe secret!:} I  strip off the silks,lightly scrub the ear (ok so I'm paranoid about insecticides)wrap it in a wet paper towel and nuke it for 3 minutes, not five. Then I season it with whatever wonderful, trendy topping. It actually is so naturally good in the summer time, that me, the great chef can enjoy it that way- butter and sea salt are good too. Try it wrapped with fresh herbs and slathered with your favorite oil & vinegar based salad dressing, if you must.

I'm a twenty year old that goes to College full-time. Needless to say, I'm used to tv dinner & canned food. I was craving the wholesome goodness that you only get from home and I was very excited to see that I can actually microwave corn! And it's yummy! Thank you =)

I'm so glad you posted this; I was about to. After removing the husks and cleaning them I usually wrap them in plastic wrap and nuke them..and here in south TX, we squeeze fresh lime and sprinkle with Bolner's Fiesta Brand PICO DE GALLO seasoning; a regional favorite!  My mom likes to brush with mayo before adding the seasoning.

I husked and cleaned 2 ears of corn and wrapped in wet paper towels - cooked for 5  minutes let it rest for a minute then cooked for another minute. It tasted great - was too hot to cook or boil corn. 
Thank you Cheri for the recipe

Faster and better than boiling! I prefer to husk my corn an do them in pyrex with a little added water. cover with plastic wrap. Paper towels work took but they are a little hard to remove when hot and wet.

So much easier than boiling - besides - the corn isn't wet and doesn't leave a pool of water on your plate causing the butter & salt to run off. ALSO - much easier to husk while its cool!! I can't tell the diff. with husk on or off. Just a FYI I also melt butter and brush it on.

Don't recommend putting corn in a plastic baggie as one reviewer said - not safe to use plastic in a microwave, no matter what it says.    Just as easy to wrap in wet paper towel and microwave 1 ear for 2-3 minutes.  No need to turn if your microwave has a self-turning plate.  Delicious!

Very good.  Like others, I cooked 2 minutes per ear.  I also used the paper towel method like the recipe calls for.  After unwrapping from the paper towels, I brushed with melted butter mixed with a little lime juice and garlic sauce.  Yum!

Wonderful! I followed another reviewer's advice and placed 3 small cobs in a corningware dish covered in saran wrap, vented in one corner. My microwave is strong, so I microwaved them for 2 minutes, flipped them and then put them in for another 2 minutes. They stayed warm for quite some time, and we just salted as we ate. Very good! Note: when I tried this same thing as the recipe directed, in a paper towel on a plate, it came out overcooked. I will definitely be making this again.

Less cleanup than boiling and just as good.  The 5 minute microwave time will definately make the corn soft, use less time if you like your corn crisper.

Didn't really 'try' this one.
I've cooked corn in the micro for years.
I like to brush butter on the raw corn  cobs and wrap in wax paper, twisting the ends to close.  I only cook it  2 1/2 to 3 minutes per ear, and turn the cobs over half way through. We really like it this way!

I'll never boil corn again.....this was absolutely scrumptious.  M/waved 3 ears, in the husks, on a platter with a moist paper towel.  Cooked 4 mins on high, turned them and rotated them, and ran them on high for another 4 mins.  They stayed in the husks for about 5 mins. while I got the rest of the meal finished up, and they were perfect.

Thanks for posting......

I never used to make corn because it takes a while to have to boil or steam it, but I am delighted to tell you that this microwave method makes corn that is delicious, and that you'd NEVER guess was "nuked" and is ready in 5 min! I'll never go back to the old way!

Yummy!!  We love corn on the cob and this is the easiest and fastest way to prepare it!  When we aren't able to grill the corn because of cold weather this is the recipe we love!  For us, 2-3 ears of corn is done in exactly 8 minutes.  I made 10 ears of corn for Thanksgiving and cooked for 14 minutes.  Perfect!  Thanks Cheri for making something so good, so simple!

This was very quick and easy.  However, I missed the sweet, fresh from the garden taste I get from steaming my corn in water with a slightly rounded teaspoon of sugar added. The second time, I dipped the paper towel in a very light sugar water mix, before wrapping and microwaving the corn.  The results were wonderful!

OMG, so much better than boiling! Took another member's advice. For 3 ears, wrapped in dry paper towels, wet the paper towels, put in micro for 4 minutes, turned over, 4 minutes longer. Left for about another minute and then unwrapped. So delicious! Sweet, tender, just perfect. Even my husband, who hates anything cooked in the microwave, said it was a lot better than boiled. Thanks so much!

Super easy recipe but soak your paper towel in whole milk. It will make your corn much sweeter. Even if you're boiling your corn. A cup or two of milk in your water and Y U M M Y!

Been doing corn on the cob for years in the microwve. I place them in a glass cake pan, add a dab or two of butter, and a tiny bit of sugar, maybe pepper or spices. Cover with plastic wrap, poke holes, Mike about 6/8 minutes, depending how many ears you have. Sure beats boiling them, with pots to clean and time consuming. Very juicy corn, and not boiling away all the vitamins and good stuff.

I found the best way is leave it in the husk, silk and all. 4 min. per ear. When you take it out with a glove of some sort, cut the end where the stalk would be at it's widest point, hold it by the top with the silk and shake it out. Comes out clean and ready to eat! No mess!

IWhen I make corn on the cob in my microwave, I just cut off the stalk end to where you can see the corn, micdrowave 4 minutes on high(8 min for 2 ears) and then with oven mitts on hang onto the cornsilk end and shake and the corn drops right out.  No need to bother husking and cleanihng beforehand. and the corn is free of any strands of corn silk.

You don't even have to clean it first. Place the ear , with the husk on, in the microwave for 5 min. When you take it out, use a towel or gloves. Cut off about half an inch of the bottom, with the husk. Grab the husk,at the top and shake the ear right out onto your plate. Clean, hot and delicious.

We love Corn On The Cob!  We thought boiling takes out the nutrients, so we've been microwaving cobs for a long time.  I used to place the cobs in a baking dish with a bit of water and cover with plastic wrap.  But, it's a GREAT idea to just wrap in wet paper towels. We do not have a dishwasher, so it eliminated a dish to wash and dry!
I just place the wrapped cobs on the rotating plate in the microwave.  Our microwave cooks 2 cobs in 5 minutes, and we let them sit in microwave for about a minute.  They are HOT when they come out!   We have not tried cooking them in their husks- think they would be too hot to handle!  Anyway, my husband does a GREAT job husking!

Learned about this method from a local grower. He said to strip the silk out and pull the husk back up. Microwave 1 ear for 3 minutes and 2 ears for 5 minutes. Haven't boiled corn since the first time I tried it this way.

Something I learned a few years ago, pop the corn in the microwave, husks silks and all.  Nuke 4 minutes. Use oven mitts cut the end off about 1 inch and hold by the silk and shake..I sometimes have to shake a few times, and corn comes out clean, cooked and ready to eat..So much easier than trying to pull all that silk off!

So easy and so good! I opted to follow the recipe vs. using the husks as I didn't want to deal with removing hot husks once the corn was cooked. The cobs stay hot much longer than they do when boiled so we enjoyed our corn throughout the meal, rather than gobbling it up at the beginning!

No need to husk the corn.  I microwave fresh corn on the cob - in the husk.  (about 3 minutes / ear).   Then I husk the corn and the silk just falls off.  So much easier.  I've done it this way for about 10 years now.

Fantastic way to cook corn -  but you don't have to husk it - just stick whole ear in microwave and nuke about 2 minutes an ear -it stays warm in the husks until you are ready to peel and eat.  Our favorite way to cook corn.  I also freeze it, but I freeze it whole and thaw in frig overnight.  tates like just picked!

Microwaved corn is the best!  I use wax paper - it holds the moisture in so that the corn steams itself, no need for water at all.  I break the ear in half first, put the halves back together and roll in a sheet of wax paper, starting in a corner and rolling to the opposite corner.  Just twist the ends to seal, and when the corn is ready, the ends make a cool place to touch when you pull the corn out of the microwave onto a plate.  The wax paper just breaks apart as you are doing this, so the cleanup is super easy!  When I'm craving something salty I sometimes have an ear as a snack, it's just so quick and better for you than other salty snacks.

Have been microwaving corn for years rather than boiling - never take all the husk off just tidy it up a little. (Taking the husk off before cooking 'ages' the kernels really fast and makes them dry ....)

There is nothing worse than heating up your kitchen to enjoy summer's corn.  I have a variation that I use all the time for my family of four.  I husk 4 ears of corn and rub each ear with butter. I place them side by side in a 9x9 pyrex dish and cover this dish with saran. I microwave all 4 ears for 5-8 minutes (depeneding on the strength of your wave). They are now ready for a dash of salt! I love making corn in the microwave.

This is much better than boiled corn. Before cooking cut off the tip and tassel with a scissors, peel off the husk until 1 or 2 layers remain on the corn and then nuke. Its a bit hot when you take off the rest of the husk.

I grew up with boiled corn--loved it.  DH insisted on grilled corn in the husks--OK.  Tonight it's pouring too hard to light the grill so...microwave it is!  And I am so glad it's raining!  The microwaved corn is absolutely the best ever!  I have a 1250W unit and did 1 minute per unhusked ear which had been soaking in water all afternoon, turned, and did another 1 minute per ear.  I let it sit at least 15 minutes, some longer.  Perfectly crisp tender--just like I like it!

I love food that is delicious AND easy! You can also do this by putting the corn (husked) in a big ziplock with a few tablespoons of water. Don't seal it (obviously). Mmmm.

No one in my family really likes corn on the cob, so this method is perfect for me when I get the summer-corn-craving! I have been using it for several years now, except I leave the husks on (cut the ends off) and nuke for 6 minutes. The silks are really easy to scrape off with a fork after you mircowave the ear. Add some butter and salt and it tastes like summer! (:

This is such a great and easy way to cook corn on the cob. You definitely can't tell the difference between microwaving and boiling. I also only cooked one cob in the microwave for 2 to 2 1/2 minutes, works perfectly!

This is an excellent idea! I would've never thought fixing corn on the cob could be so easy! I only did 2 1/2 minutes per ear though,and it was perfect!

Perfection! What a great way to cook corn on the cob.  I cooked three ears for 8 minutes turning halfway, and they were great. I don't think I'll ever cook it the old way again.  Thank you Cheri!

Even easier....is leaving the corn in its husk. The steam forms inside the husk. Remove from the microwave and leave in the husk for an additional 1-2 minutes. Remove husk carefully (using a clean hot pad works great). The silks hold together and come off so easily. This is about the only way I cook corn on the cob anymore.

Gourmet Gal, if you want an even easier-cleanup method, nuke them in the husk! When they are cooked, cut the end of the cob off, husk and all, cutting through about 2 of the bottom rows. Grab the silk end with a potholder or dishcloth, and you can squeeze the cob out (sorta like toothpaste). The husk AND the silk slip off in one piece. You will NEVER go back to boil-and-peel after you try this. Check Youtube for numerous vids.

STOP THE MICROWAVE!! Way too long cooking time.  I started to read the reviews too late and stopped at 4 minutes, that gave me wrinkly corn kernels.  I bet 2-3 minutes for one ear of corn would be enough.  :)

very easy and good: cook ears individually on high for 2 min (1100 watt microwave) with husks on. Prior to putting in microwave, peel back husk and wash off, leaving just a little bit of dampness on the ear to help steam. then throw some seasonings on after pulling out of microwave. I did butter with cayenne pepper and black pepper.

I wrap the corn in the husks and a newspaper and put it in the freezer for winter eating. I then just pop the entire package in the microwave for 8-10 minutes

Great discovery! Didn't want to heat up the kitchen on such a hot day, so this microwave recipe was great.
Besides that- it was absolutely the best tasting corn ever!

I leave 'em in the husks and also wrap with the moist+ paper towels and nuke 2min. per ear.  Then leave them in the towels to steam for another minute.  The silks just almost fall off.  Butter w/ a little garlic salt.  I make a meal out of the corn and carmelized brussel sprouts and sliced fresh garden tomato slices. Mmmmmmmmm--can't beat it.

Leave your corn in the husk. Microwave 3 - 5 minutes or until you can smell the cooked corn.  Let it rest in the husk (it steams the corn) for 15 + or - minutes.  Husk the corn when serving which is much easier once it has been cooked. Smells and tastes so fresh!

Big fan of this in our house for many years... We get fresh corn usually with the husk on and slightly open from the top and rinse a little water in.. Afterwards, close up the husk and microwave for 3 minutes and deliciousness has arrived!  The husk does much the same what the paper towel does by trapping and steaming the heat.

I've never heard of cooking corn on the cob this way but loved the idea since we had all the stove burners in use as well as the grill. Worked like a charm and I'll be using this method from now on. The corn was delicious! Thanks!

Stumbled upon this one night when my range was not working.  Microwaved right in the husks for 3 minutes on each side, two ears at a time, and let them stand for a bit to cool.  Absolutely PERFECT!  Buh-bye boiled corn!

Wonderful recipe. When I think of the time I spent waiting for the water to boil so I could drop the ears of corn in or scraping off the char on grilled ears...well, never, ever again! Thank you, Cheri Weiner, you've made my summer life a whole lot easier.

I have been microwaving my corn for many years now.  I do not see any difference between doing this way as opposed to steaming.  I peel and clean the corn and then I put it in a plastic ziploc bag and leave it open just a bit for the steam to escape.  My dear departed dad used to use a recyled bread bag and a plastic tie to close.  Be sure not to use  the twist tie with the metal inside or you will cause a fire!!! I usually do 6-8 ears for 10 mins.  Make sure you let them cool because they are very hot.

I was skeptical at first, however, this is my new way to do corn on the cob! It couldn't be easier! No more huge pots of boiling water to mess with! It is great for just doing a few ears at a time.  I did mine for 2 mins per ear.  Turned out great!

I never microwaved corn before with the exception of purchasing frozen corn in the supermarket.  This is an excellent, no-nonsense way of cooking a few pieces at a time when you are in a hurry. The only trick is adjusting the time amount if you have a more powerful microwave.  I got away with 3 minutes for one ear.

I don't even bother with the paper towel.  I peel back the husk, remove the strings, rinse the corn with water, put the husk back on, and microwave it for 2 minutes or so per husk.

Love the taste of the corn this way!  I made 7 ears of corn, left the husks on them, piled them in the microwave, covered them with a single, wet papertowel and microwaved them for 15 minutes.  Piled them all in a large basket to serve - husks still on.  Looked beautiful on the table amongst the other fresh garden goodies.  We pulled the husks off when we were individually ready to eat - amazing how easily the silk and husks came off!  I'll never boil corn on the cob again.

Mmmm...We were introduced to this at a  family picnic last year and have done it several times since then. We didn't use the wet paper towels - we just left the corn in the husk and cook it for 3 minutes. Two ears for four minutes.  Butter and salt and have a happy time!

I have used the microwave to cook corn for years when there is no time to grill it.
Just soak the corn in the husks, you don't need the paper towel and you don't have to husk it to remove the silk first.
Just cook it, the silk falls right off when the corn is cooked.
How long depends upon the power of your microwave. Start with 2 minuets, turn over and do another 2 minuets per ear if cooking 2 to 10 ears.

Simple, quick, energy-efficient, and delicious!  These came out perfectly crisp (as opposed to mushy) and fully cooked.  Even when it's not hot and humid, I'll go with this method, as it's better for the environment and for my energy bill and it's so much faster and less messy than the stovetop method!  Thank you!

Great idea and thanks for posting this recipe.  It worked perfectly for me, I left the husks on (rinsed the corn underneath and made sure the husks were wet) and wrapped each cob in a wet paper towel.  It took me 4 and a half minutes per cob, I turned them over at the 2 minute mark.  This is now my preferred way of making corn cobs.

So tender and juicy-cooks perfect this way.  I too left the husks on and microwaved for 7 minutes turning over halfway.  Now why couldn't I have thought of this super easy way sooner...Would've saved me some hassel of hanging over a hot boiling pot of water many a nights!

Super Fast – but 5 minutes is WAY..... too long in my microwave! It actually took only 3 minutes per ear. Next time I will try cooking with the husks on.

I agree with several other reviewers;no need for a paper towel -  just leave the corn in the husk.  When you are finished microwaving, the husks and silk pull off extremely easily!  Do be careful, because the husks will be quite hot.  Two to three minutes per ear of corn depending on the size of the ears and the power of your microwave should do it.  Keep an eye on the ears, so as not to overcook.

Wow!!!  I am always looking for HEALTHY things that my teenage son can prepare for himself when I work late sometimes.  He loves corn on the cob and he doesn't have to use a stove or oven (which I discourage) and doesn't have to eat veggies from a can!!  Also, since the corn is not boiled, it retains more nutrients... sounds like a winner to me!

I haven't boiled corn in water in ages after I tried this method. It's so quick, and the corn comes out great. Make sure the paper towels are dampened so it's like steaming it. I usually nuke for 3 minutes, and it comes out perfect. Then the usual butter/salt. Additionally, on a small portion of the corn, I sometimes kick it up with some chile powder or black pepper. Try either...a nice combo with the corn!

Came out great!  Wrapped in a wet paper towel and microwaved one ear for 3 minutes.  I did find the ends a little rubbery, but I'm not sure if I may have overcooked.

The microwave concept is great if you're making one ear of corn for yourself. If I was serving more people, I'd still boil it with a pinch of sugar added - the way my mother and grandmother always did.  5 minutes is WAY too long for my microwave and wrapping it in a damp paper towel only made the corn mushy.  I found that two minutes without the paper towel gave me a crisp ear of corn.

I will never boil corn on the cob again (steam? in this heat??) I cooked 2 ears of corn for 6 minutes, turning at half time.

Using others' tips, here's how I did it: peeled back the husk, removed the silk, washed the ear, put the husk back. But the husk was "sprung" and wouldn't lay flat. To hold it in place I wrapped a short piece of dampened paper towel around that end. (I just flicked some water onto the paper towel.)

This method of cooking is brilliant. The corn was tender and perfect, no heating up the kitchen.

micro cook it in the husk and silk four minutes. Let rest for 1 minute Cut off the stalk end, hold on to the end with the silk and the corn will slide right out of the husk perfectly cleaned and ready to eat. Delicious.

Better yet........leave the husk & silk on.......put in the micro for 8 minutes.........cut the "stem" end off.........take hold of the silky end...shake and the corn falls right out......not need to be pulling silk & husk off........ENJOY!!!!  PS be sure to use hot pads.

I had this at a friend's house and have been enamored of it ever since.  She, and now I, peels back the husk, remove the  corn silk, rinse under cold water rubbing off any stray bits of silk, and bring the husk back up over the cob.  Put on a plate (or not) and microwave for 2-3 mnutes.  All that wonderful corn flavor is retained, not boiled away in a pot of water.  Just delicious/!!

A total waste of paper towels!

Microwave the corn in the husk, silk and all for as many minutes as you want.
Cut off the end of the cob wher the husk is attached grab the small end and squeeze the corn out of the husk.  The silk stays with the husk.

I have been nuking my corn on the cob for years & love the flavor (most veggies have better flavor when nuked) as well as the convenience. Helps keep the house cooler in the summer too. I used to put the husked ears in a plastic bag with a Tbsp or 2 of water but since then I've found a simpler way. I just microwave them husk & all 4.5 min. for 1 ear, 6 min. for 2 & so on, adjusting the time for the number of ears. Just last week-end I did 6 ears for a family BBQ. 10 minutes & they were perfect. When they're done I handle them with oven mitts. They peel easily & the silk comes off quickly too. Everyone raved about how good the corn was.

A much easier way to microwave corn on the cob.  Place ear of corn unhusked in microwave, cook on high 4 min for each ear you cook.  Remove corn and using a sharp knife, cut about 1 to 2 inches up on the bottom of the ear, making sure to cut all the way through the husk.  Grab ear by silk end and shake a few times til corm falls out.  This will give you a completely clean silk free ear of corn.  No soaking is needed before microwaving.  Very easy.

I found an awesome way to cook the corn AND eliminate all the messy cleaning--cook the corn--husk, silk and all--at 4 minutes per ear on high.  Remove, cut the bottom being sure to get through all layers of the husk, grab the top of the corn with the silk and give it a good shake and the corn slides out silk-free (ok, I had one piece of silk once--lol).  I like to grill my corn so I just give it a few more minutes on my bbq to give it that grilled look and flavor.

Awesome, but DON'T bother with husking and wet paper towel!! Just 2min in the microwave, and the husk and silkys come off way easier, and it is far more flavorful than boiling water! Yummm and easy!

It doesn't get much easier cooking corn on the cob then this recipe.  I cooked 2 ears and it took exactly 5 minutes in my microwave.  This works great when you only want 1 or 2 ears of corn.

Freezing fresh corn on the cob diminishes the flavor and is available fresh from Mexico or S. America during winter months.  I agree, don't take off the husks, just microwave and enjoy...

Five minutes was too long for our corn.  I'll try this again with a shorter cook time.  An OK option if you need to cook corn fast, but boiling would give better results.

Unless I'm cooking the corn in the pot with crawfish and taters, I never boil anymore. I leave the husk on and serve it shuck on to use as a holder.

I have a comment:  I do something similar, but I leave the corn in the husk and microwave 4 min.  It is a bit messy to peel, but comes out perfect.

I microwave fresh corn in the husk and use silicone pot holders to peel them after they're cooked (prevents me from getting burned!)  Also, I store fresh corn wrapped in damp dishtowels in the veggie crisper.....they stay fresh quite a while this way! I do check the towels daily to make sure they stay damp.  Good tip for summer when corn is cheap!

I'll always be partial to my corn grilled, but this is a close second. My microwave (under 1000 watts, unsure of the exact) had two ears perfectly cooked in 5 minutes on high. My boyfriend claims he cooks his in the microwave but without a moist towel and it turns out, but this was so easy and delicious I won't chance it without. Thanks for sharing :)

This turned out great. My corn was so easy to fix and not soggy from being boiled in water either. I used fresh corn and made 3 ears at one time in a Pyrex pie plate. I did have to increase the time though for all three at once. I shucked these and removed the silks then simply wrapped them individually in damp paper towels as directed. Great recipe, this turned out just right!

This is how I cooked my corn this past summer.  It was delicious every time.  I cooked mine 2 minutes, per cob.  I do think it depends on your microwave.  You really have to experiment with it.  Sure does beat boiling the water and heating up your house in the summer though.

This was great - couldn't be easier.  I did mine as written (we did 10 minutes for 4 ears -- I think next time I might up that to 12 minutes for 4 ears) we wrapped it in the wet paper towels.. and it worked out beautifully -- will definitely be the way we do corn in this house from now on -- Thanks!

Leave the corn in the husk and microwave for 3 minutes.  When you remove the husk, all the cornsilk comes off with the husk, no wasting time removing every little strand.

Been cooking it this way for several years.  At first, wrapping each ear in plastic wrap and twisting the ends.  But then came across a microwave steamer-type container that holds two ears.  You put a very small amount of water in the bottom and it steams both ears in 5-Min with no need to turn the corn.  Whichever method you use, the corn is great and the clean up is almost non-existent!

DOING THIS FOR YEARS- SOMETIMES I USED A ZIPLOC WITH A LITTLE WATER IN THE BOTTOM (PUT BAG IN A BOWL)- IT WILL EVENTUALLY POP IN MICROWAVE BUT WILL STILL KEEP YOUR CORN REAL MOIST!! QUICK AND EASY CLEANUP- I THINK HEALTHIER TOO- BOILING REMOVES NUTRIENTS AND STEAMING KEEPS IN NUTRIENTS -

I boiled some of the ears of corn and made some in the microwave, we could not tell the difference between the two!  This is a very easy way to cook just a couple of ears of corn, and I will use this way of cooking corn on the cob again.

This was fabulous and easy - nuked two ears at five minutes and it was perfect! I'd recommend sprinkling the corn liberally with lemon pepper before microwaving...it adds a wonderful little zing to the corn!

This was a very yummy way to use my garden corn, and it is a preferable method over grilling.  We took the husks almost all the way off, yanked out the silk, and drizzled a mixture of melted butter, tbls of sugar, and about 1 tsp of cilantro on the kernals of each ear and wrapped the husk back over the ear.  We wrapped the ear in damp paper towels, and cooked 2 ears for 4 mins, 30 seconds turning halfway through. How EASY and yummy! :)

I've never cooked corn and so I was looking for an easy way to do it.  Well, I found it!  I cooked the corn in the papertowel for 2 mins and then flipped the corn over for another 2.5 mins.  Once it was done I wrapped it in foil with butter and garlic salt to keep it hot.  It was perfect!

This is a great idea, I never thought of cooking cobs in the microwave before!  I put a very wet towel on the bottom of the plate and put the corn on top, then covered with another towel.  I did not wrap each one.  The cooked a little uneven but I'm sure it was our microwave.

I removed the silks but left the cobs in the shucks.  I wrapped each one in damp cheesecloth and nuked three at a time for 10 minutes, rotating halfway through.  They turned out great!

I too left my husks on but then also wrapped them in a wet paper towel. It took 8 minutes to do two large ears in my microwave. Very quick, very easy...will use this method again.

I was so excited to find a quick way to cook corn on the cob without having to boil water on hot days.  It turned out great but I did have to increase the cooking time to do 4 ears. I think I will try leaving the husks on next time as other reviewers suggest.

This worked fine, though I prefer wraping the corn in saran wrap. It seam to stay more moist that way.

I followed the directions exactly, although I cooked two cobs at once (they took about 6 minutes, I checked every two minutes), and the result was perfect. For an early-May day with temperatures in the 90's, it was so nice to not have the stove going. Thanks so much, Cheri. :)

When I put one ear of fresh corn in my 1000 watt microwave for 5 minutes, it was badly burned. I am not sure if this recipe is for still-frozen corn or fresh corn. I'll try it again and only leave it in for 2-3 minutes.

Crisp and clean - both in taste and preparation. This was my first time making corn on the cob and it turned out delicious. My microwave doesn't turn so I did three ears and the after 8 minutes one had cooked, and I ended up doing the other two for about 4 minutes longer. Thank you! I was looking for a simple quick and easy way to cook corn on the cob and I found it!

Instead of husking, def leave in the husk and cook 2min, add about 1 min per extra ear of corn.  The husk provides enough natural moisture and also makes for very easy husking as it just slides right off.

Microwaving is great , I use the 1 potato, 2 potato etc setting depending on how many ears, but DO NOT husk it  , After microwaving  cut through the cob about an inch to 1 1/2 inches from the stem end, right where it starts to taper, Then just squeeze from the stem end and the cob slides right out leaving the silk behind . Works with steamed, microwaved, grilled etc . Great hack, be careful not to burn your hands .

I made this again and cooked 2 ears for a total of 6.5 minutes, turning over halfway through. Perfect!   7-20-2016 This recipe is perfect for that already shucked corn you buy in the produce section of the grocery store. I used this recipe tonight but followed other reviewers' instructions to wrap the corn first and then wet it and to cook 2 ears for 8 minutes, turning over halfway through. Worked perfectly, except next time, I think I will cook it for a total of only 7 minutes.

I wouldn't normally cook corn in the microwave, but one day the water quality out if the tap was really questionable. Ski decided to give it a shot. It worked fine, but I still prefer doing it the traditional way. One more thing, though. The "footnote" at the end suggests using aluminum foil to keep the corn moist and warm. Are you kidding me? Worst.advice.ever! Do not use foil in the microwave. Ever!

I ran out of pots and stove space so I turned to my trusty microwave.  I used clean, shucked corn, put them on a dinner plate with a couple of tablespoons of water, and covered the entire plate with 2 layers of damp paper towels.  I put 3 ears in and microwaved for 8 minutes and I turned them around halfway through.

For those who use plastic wrap to cover the corn, plastic wrap is NOT microwave safe and can contain toxins.  Though I'll use it to cover a dish, I don't want it to touch my food... food for thought!

Microwaving is great but skip the paper towel and wrap the corn in plastic wrap after spraying with butter.  Great addition.

I recently threw a large party in the park and needed to cook 50 ears of corn. I decided to try precooking the corn in the microwave and then throwing it on the grill right before serving. It worked amazingly and tasted delicious.

Yummy! I was leery about microwaving but I try it today and was very pleased and my husband loved it as well! I cleaned the corn and left the husk on the corn. I microwaved 3 1/2 minutes on one side and then did it again 3 1/2 on the other side. Quick and Easy! Dinner was ready in no time. Broiled Salmon with garlic potatoes and microwave corn on the cob!!

I love this!  But i just cut the end off three or four ears and wrap them in a dish towel (clean).  Then zap them for six to eight minutes, depending on how big they are.  They are super hot when you take them out to take the husks off.  But they taste so fresh and crisp and summery!

I did 5 ears and it took about 14 minutes, but they were so perfect! I don't like boiling out all the goodness...Thanks for this great idea!

I've been cooking corn on the cob in my microwave for well over 30 years now.   Got the method in my new Hitachi microwave cookbook then.   Remove all but about the last 2 or 3 layers of husk.   Trim the silk and the top.   Microwave 2 cobs 5 minutes.   Wait 5 minutes to eat.   We keep repeating this until we have all the cobs we need.

This is fantastically easy!  I love it.  One thing I do is rinse off the corn after I clean it.  I still stays hot.

My friend showed me this method - however I highly recommend 3 minutes per cob (rather than 5) and leave the husk on until after cooking. Its HOT and I wear my oven mitt when I am removing the husks - but I swear I will never boil corn again. Like others have said here, I was skeptical at first but it really is excellent!

It is delicious.  Can be even easier.  Wrap completely in wax paper and microwave for 3 minutes for 1 ear, 5 min. for 2.

Microwave each ear for 3 minutes with the husk on. Be very careful, it will be HOT. I just pull the husk down ,don't remove, use hush to hold corn, remove the corn silk ( comes right off, very easy)  butter and eat. Cooking in the husk (I think) makes it sweeter. If I'm cooking more then one, I add 3 mins. for each ear. It comes out crispy and so good.

When I got this recipe yesterday in my email I never thought I would use it.  Until today (an entire day later :) ), my boss gave me some sweet corn from a local farm.  By noon I couldn't wait to try it, so with only a microwave at work I cleaned it, wrapped it in a paper towel for 2 minutes and WOW!!  An excellent way to make corn on the cob, just as good as boiling, only easier, faster, and less mess!

Family thought the corn was too chewy and I must agree.  I prefer boiling it in the pot over this method anyday.  Although quicker, it didn't work for me for taste.  Sorry....

Try spreading with margarine first, wrap each ear in waxed paper, then wrap in plastic wrap to seal in the juices.  This is my family's favorite way to taste the freshness and already have the corn buttered to perfection!

4 stars as is. 5 if you make it simpler and peel off all but the last few husks surrounding the corn. Don't worry about the silks. Microwave for 3 minutes an ear (Mine is 1250 Watt on high power). Use potholders to finish shucking the corn, the silks slide right off. I did 4 ears the other night and turned them over after 6 minutes. I have done 3 and let them go for 9 minutes without touching them. Perfect every time. Much healthier than boiling away the nutrients, and a definite time saver.

Amazing flavor!  I did 7 minutes for 2 ears and 10 minutes for 3.  I also left the last one wrapped in the paper towel until someone wanted seconds, then it was still nice and hot.  No leftovers here!

I just tried this a few days ago...I wrapped the cleaned cob in a dry towel and ran the whole thing
under water...then squeezed the cob and microwaved it for 2 minutes.  Today, I tried it for 2-1/2 minutes and thought it was chewy.  This is so easy and quick that I have been craving this corn!

Awesome!  Instead of a wet paper towel, I rinse the corn, then wrap in wax paper, twisting the ends.  I microwave for 4 minutes at a time, turning it over each time I continue microwaving, and do this until it's tender, about 10-12 minutes.  Thanks for the recipe!

As the original submitter suggested, I opted for this method because we ran out of room on the grill and stovetop.  (What was I thinking, making all that food?)  We all thought it was great and, unlike a previous reviewer, I'd much rather put one plate in the dishwasher than wash a pot.    Thank you for the idea!

The best corn on the cob is cooked in the
microwave in wet paper towels for 5 minutes.  
I love it!

I decided to take the reviewers advice and leave the husks on... These turned out perfect! Will make in microwave from now on if not making more than 5 ears.

I gave this a 4 because it did work and it did taste like corn.  It didn't get a 5 simply because I don't see the point at all.  I tried it because my neighbor said corn cooked in the husks in the microwave was really good, but someone else said the hunks would get really hot, so I opted to try this without the husks.  It wasn't any better, and it didn't take any less time.  (I don't consider boiling water "time" because there's always something else to be done anyway.)  Yes, a plate is easier to wash than my big pot, but washing a pot that's had nothing but corn in it is not exactly a toil either.  Most things I have tried to "cook" in the microwave I've decided the old-fashioned way was better and usually just as easy, and continue to believe microwaves are for melting, heating stuff up and defrosting.  But hey, I tried it.

I love to use the wet paper towel and leave the husk on.  Overkill maybe, but it doesn't dry out and the silks come off the corn so much easier when it is cooked :)

Hmm, my corn was a tad dry. It was improved with a little butter and salt, but not quite juicy like when it is boiled. I checked after 5 minutes and it was not done yet, so I had to add at least another 2 minutes. This definitely has to sit for 5 minutes or longer as the kernal part near the cob gets very hot. I did really much enjoy not getting out the big pot of boiling water, though today, thanks.

The best thing about microwaved corn on the cob is that when you eat it, you get the WHOLE kernel, not just part of it. Easy, quick and you don't heat up the kitchen with boiling pots.

Quick and EASY way to cook corn on the cob.  I cooked three ears with the husks/silk on for 8 minutes total (flipping them over halfway through).  I do think I prefer lightly boiled corn better, but this was done before water would even be ready to boil.  The husks and silk came off super easy when the corn as cool enough to handle.

This was the easiest thing ever! I'm thrilled that it's not just easier than boiling; it's BETTER TASTING! I did one cob for 3 minutes and it was perfect.

Really excellent results cooking corn on the cob with this method! I shucked and rinsed the cobs, wrapped them in the wet paper towel and cooked for about 4.5 minutes and then let it rest for a couple minutes then cooked for another 2 minutes or so and the corn turned out perfectly. The microwave I used was one of them small cheapy white ones you can buy at Walmart. So, a high power microwave isn't required for delicious results.  Darin

This was great! Microwaving it preserved some flavor that you lose during the boiling process and it cooked it perfectly. My husband and I were very happy with this recipe :)

Follow this recipe exactly except leave the husks on and microwave for 7 minutes.   Be careful taking off husks, but they will gently fall off without any strings attached - most awesome!

If you want corn on the cob as quickly as possible, then this is definitely the recipe for you. Cooking time will vary, of course - mine was done in about 7 minutes, turned halfway though. I'll defintely be making these to freeze during the summer when corn is ridiculously cheap. Thanks so much, Cheri!

Quick and easy with no clean up.  Corn was a little more dry than usual; make sure you keep an eye on it while in the microwave and check frequently.  Still tasted great!

This was  good, but I still prefer boiling.  I cooked 4 ears, and had to wind up microwaving them for close to 15 minutes; it really wasn't a timesaver, since I could have boiled them for that time.  I'll probably boil them in the future, but it's nice to know that they can be done this way as well.

I have to say I was disappointed.  I think in the end I spent more time trying to figure out the exact length of time to cook the corn in the micro.  I started off at two minute increments and checked for doneness--  literally taking a bite.  After six minutes, I cooked the corn for one minute.  It burned in some areas and the taste of the corn was very dry.  The corn was not frozen when I started and I followed the directions to a T.  I think I'll go back to boiling.  Thanks, anyways.

This was quick and the consistency of the corn was PERFECT. Lately I have had a corn fetish, but none of the rest of the family is on the same wavelength, so this lets me get my fix without wasting corn.

I wrap my corn in wax paper with a splash of water added for steam, then after it's done wrap in aluminum foil to let it finish cooking and keep warm until ready to serve (the sugars in the corn stay hot a very long time).  My microwave takes 4 minutes for a single ear to cook, and it comes out al dente.

Don't use paper towel, rinse the corn in water, lay on a piece of saran wrap and roll up leaving ends open.  3 minutes per cob plus an extra minute on top of that. corn on the cob doesn't need to be cooked either it can be just  heated up.

I feel like my entire life has been a lie. I never would have thought that microwaving fresh ears of corn would taste as good, if not better than boiling. As long as I've been cooking, I've always boiled them, but the kitchen is so hot this time of year I decided to try it this way. Like others, I left the husk on. I am converted! Unless I'm making corn for a lot of people I'm never boiling again!

Worked out well for 3" frozen corn cobs.  I would suggest ignoring the footnote, I don't think that aluminum foil will help keep the corn moist.

This is a great recipe for one ear of corn!  Much easier than boiling a huge pot of water. I will say that the cooking time is a bit long for just one ear.  Next time I’ll stop the cooking at four minutes and see what I think.

As instructed, my first ear was grossly overlooked.  The concept is fine but 5 minutes is way too long unless you are cooking what we call horse corn (typically late season, very large and tough kernels and big ears).  We prefer younger, sweeter corn.  3 minutes per ear is ample.  You can leave it unshucked until after cooking or you can do the paper towel approach.  We use either, depending upon the condition of the corn.

Better to just leave in the husk as many have said. I've done it that that way for 15+ years. I run water over mine and put them straight into the microwave and roughly halfway thru I flip them over. Like microwaved potatoes, after they come out of the microwave it's best to let them rest in the husk for 10ish minutes before shucking and eating.

You want true "corn taste", strip away leaves but leave a small layer on the corn. Cut edges off but do not put in bags. Wet the corn and put in micro wave for about 4.5 minutes or desired tenderness.Flavor of the corn remain within the leaves, you will love this.

This is surprisingly delicious and so much easier than boiling or grilling corn on the cob. I did add a thin layer of salt on each piece of corn before I microwaved them.

Be very careful. If you use recycled paper towels, you can damage your microwave or your GFIC socket. Check your paper towel package.

I can't believe I've never done this!  Great when it's so hot you don't want to use the stove.  The corn is so much sweeter when you're not boiling all the goodness out of it.  I microwave a half dozen and keep the ones I don't eat wrapped in the paper towel and placed in a zip lock bag in the fridge.  I'll never boil another ear of corn again!

Lately, I have been soaking the corn in the husk in water, then microwave in husk for 3-4 ", then unwrap husk into a handle, rinse off hairs off the hot corn, and enjoy.

I think 3-4 minutes would have been enough time.  Other than that it was good.

I've been using same directions as "thymeforme" gave for many years.  It's true - the silk just falls off when the corn is done.

I have been cooking my corn on the cob like this for several years. As I am just cooking for myself, it is much quicker than bringing a pot of water to boil, plus when corn is in season the weather is hot, who wants to heat up the kitchen boiling water? I break my cleaned ear of corn in half and place in a pyrex dish with a little bit of water, cover with the glass lid and cook on high about 2-3 minutes.

This was a perfect method for the lone cob that wouldn't fit in the pot to steam with the other eleven. However, 5 minutes was too long; it came out all rubbery. Even so, it tasted pretty good. I'm sure that it you keep an eye on it before it overcooks it would be excellent.

I've done this for years now...
I strip the husk down to a single layer, cut off the silk to within 0.5" of the cob and microwave for 2.5 minutes per cob. 
*Steam escapes through the top (where the silk has been cut), so be careful when handling the cooked cob(s). 
Allow about 1 minute "resting" time and peel off the husk - Perfectly cooked without a lot of fuss!
** As mentioned in another post, the remaining silk requires no effort to remove once the cooking is done, but be aware of the heat/steam and rest the cob(s) for the minute while you set up the butter... mmm

I often cook it this way but cook for about 1-1/2 minutes. I like a little crunch. Might I suggest that if you are leaving the husk on, soak it in water  first.

I tried it the first time on 5 minutes and thought it was a little too much.
Second time was 3 and a half minutes and for me that was perfect.

I followed the instructions and set my microwave at 5 minutes. About 2 minutes in, it started making a lot of popping so I checked on it and it ripped the paper towel in a few spots so I went ahead and took it out. Was super rubbery :(

I prefer grilling or boiling, but this worked out alright! I have a 1200 W microwave and cooked 2 ears for 5 minutes and I probably should have only done it for 4. 
I do have a question regarding the footnote on the main recipe page... Is this person saying it's okay to use Aluminum Foil in the Microwave? :)

I had them turn out fantastically, especially since I only needed an ear for me, and boiling water for one ear is not wanted.  Makes me jonesing for corn on the cob a LOT easier!

Just a note you should not put aluminum foil in the microwave because it could cause electricity to burn your microwave and ruin it, but if you use the first way with the paper towel it works out great!

Great recipe. The footnote/tip, however says to wrap  food in aluminum foil to cook it evenly. This is an INAPPROPRIATE tip for a recipe done entirely in a microwave.

I husked and cleaned 2 ears, broke them in half to make 4 coblettes.  Wrapped them in damp pape r towels.  Microwave them on high for 3 minutes.  Flip them over in microwaved them for 3 more minutes.  Unwrapped them and put them in a covered casserole and let them steam in there with some butter salt and pepper until serving time.  They were absolutely perfect.  Crispy tender.  Not undercooked or overcooked.  Amazing.

So easy and tastes just like a cob that was boiled without all of the steam.  I had four cobs to cook so I adjusted the time to 7 minutes. This will be my go to recipe from now on.

My dad actually told me about this. I keep some of the husk on, remove the silks. I wrap up each ear of corn in a wet paper towel, cook it in the microwave for 3 minutes each. 
comes out perfect EVERY time. 
I would caution making more than 2 at a time. That WILL effect the cooking time.

It's far easier to just nuke the corn in the husk. 5 minutes for a large ear. Then cut the stem end of the corn off, and squeeze the opposite end. The ear slides out minus the hair.

Have done corn in micro for years but w/most of husks still on. Additionally, I fill the sink w/water & kosher salt & let soak for about 1/2 hrs prior to cooking. No need for additional salt. Keeping husks makes corn taste like it was just picked.

I didn't want all the bother of pulling out a pot and boiling water to make corn, so I decided to go this route instead.  As per other reviewers, I didn't bother shucking the corn.  Instead, I just trimmed off the ends and microwaved it in the husks.  I did three ears for nine minutes, turning them halfway, and they ended up nice and sweet and tender.  Not any more outstanding than boiled corn, but who doesn't like a good shortcut?

I put butter or margarine on each ear, sprinkle with salt and pepper, place on paper plate and lay a piece of wax paper over the ear(s).  I cook them on high for 2 minutes per ear.  Adjust for the individual microwave  and how "well done" you like your sweet corn.

Worked like a charm! As others stated they did, I simply pulled back the husk, cleaned the corn, and pulled the husk back up around the corn to cook in the microwave instead of using a wet paper towel. My 1100 watt microwave on high cooked two ears at the same time in 5 min. I turned the corn over once after 2 min and 30 seconds.  Tastes just like they were boiled, but with the easy clean up when you only need to make a couple!

If I'm only making a couple ears of corn, microwaving is the perfect way for me to do it. It only takes 2-3 minutes in my microwave, depending on the size of the ears. I have always used waxed paper, no water, and it steams nicely in the waxed paper. However, using a paper towel was a great idea. I agree with the reviewer that suggested to wrap the ear of corn in the dry towel first and then wet it.

A perfect way to microwave corn on the cob. I think 5 mins might be a bit long (depending on your microwave power). Next time I plan to reduce it by a couple of mins and see how that goes.

When you've been outside enjoying the summer weather and you're tired, this is the easiest way to cook some fresh corn on the cob. Add a couple of rib eyes (bone in) on the grill while you're sipping on a cold Corona and then your good to go. Keep it warm until you and your significant other enjoy some quality time.  Then finish off the night with a great meal !
Life is good !

I have tried microwaving corn without the husk and I have found that too much moisture escapes and you end up with less tasty corn. I now leave the husks on. The only preparation I do is to tear off the top of the silks, pull down the top of the husks just an inch and let water flow in to give it a quick rinse. Pull the husks back up into place and microwave. Having the husk on gives you a more intensive corn flavor and the corn remains moist.

I can't believe I am this old and never tried fresh corn in the microwave.  I did not use the wet paper towel, just put 3 freshly husked ears of corn on a plate and microwaved for 6 minutes.  It's great!

I always do my Corn On The Cobb in microwave. Recipe from my Mother In law years ago. Never fails. Wet towel put corn in it and roll up in microwave for 10 minutes. If not sure check after 5 minutes it is so easy took cook this way.

By the time microwave went off, my corn on the was a little bit over cooked but I suppose that is mainly my fault for not paying attention. Over all it was a good way to have a quick side dish with steak.

Wowzers. I'm sold. I usually cook my corn in my electric pressure cooker so the kitchen doesn't heat up but this is pure genius!! And DELICIOUS!! I cut two ears in half, wrapped each in dry paper towel and then ran them quickly under water to wet the paper towel. Four minutes total in the microwave on high and pure perfection!! Ate two and the remaining two were still hot when we went to butter them. I'm literally stopping people in the hall at work and telling them about this. THANK YOU!!!

Worked great. Corn is extremely sweet and tender. Almost wanted to take off a star for the fact that the corn was too hot, but the sweetness more than compensated for that minor issue.

The concept of microwaving corn on the cob is outstanding.  This beats boiling water in a hot kitchen in the summer months especially in Florida.  Thanks a bunch!

Sounds easy. I 've been leaving the corn in the husks, just removing the excess  silk at the end of the corn. Nuke one ear 4 min. 2 ears 8 minutes.
This method is very good too. Sometimes I would just leave only a couple layers of husk on, wrap them individually in paper towels and keep a few in the fridge ready to go. My husband aways enjoyed having one of these as a snack, fast & easy.

It's an amazing idea to boil the corn this way. I tried it for the first time,put some salted butter and freshly ground peppered loved it till the last bite. I made 6 of them in two batches microwaved for 10 minutes eachtime and reused the paper towels.
