These came out great! I substituted cooked quinoa for the dried bread great for more protein. On the adjusted serving serve to 4, I used 1 cup cooked quinoa.

Cooking tip: Really make sure you cook the liquid off of the mushrooms and onions well, otherwise your burgers will be soft/ mushy. Suggestions for enhancing the flavor: 1/4 c tahini paste (adds a nice, nutty complexity to the flavor and helps bond the ingredients), 2Tb Worcestershire sauce (add to mushrooms while cooking), a sprinkle of Garam Masala or Curry (I have enjoyed both). This recipe also makes tasty meatballs for spaghetti-- just bake in small balls!

The burger base itself is very delicious, but I needed to double the amount of breadcrumbs for the burgers to be able to stick together.  They were still very delicate but handled carefully turned out delicious.

Came out way better than I thought. I cut this down to 4 portions using 2 8oz packs of shrooms and still had enough for 6 patties. I added the garlic first, letting it brown and then the onion until it became a bit glassy, just because I'm used to that order. Cut the mushrooms finely before frying using a herb chopper - same with the onions. Used probably twice the oregano, two eggs, and a few handfuls of nacho cheddar cheese. Baked them 10 mins each side at 450. Crispy, meaty, juicy, non-crumbly and delicious. These could easily pass for real meat patties.

These were really different. I don't think they taste like a burger, but more like a patty version of a vegetarian stuffed mushroom. Before being cooked the filling was almost like a mushroom heavy stuffing. Although, I do like that they set up, after they cook, as they cool. I wouldn't recommend this to a meat burger eater, but it might be a different change to someone tired of the flavor and texture of bean burgers. It was a little salty tasting to me, and I didnt love the soft chewy texture, but I think they will all be eaten by someone in my household. I made 1/2 recipe and got 7 patties with a #16 scoop.

I have not tried this burger but it is enough like mine that I bet it is really good.  Mine was so much like real meat that it was quite satisfying.  I had lost my recipe so I was ecstatic to find one very close to mine.  One difference is I chop the mushrooms into medium pieces and then fry them until they are golden and leathery.  This is what gives them the meaty chewiness.  I then add the other ingredients except the oatmeal.  I am going to try my recipe with the oatmeal to see if it makes a difference. I don't use cheese in the mix and I add a tablespoon of soy sauce. I never liked the bean burgers that most vegie burgers are made of.  They don't taste anything like a hamburger.

I followed Hayley comment to add 2 tblspoons of Worcestershire sauce which is a great tip to give a real meaty flavor. I also added 1 tsp of paprika to give it a little kick and made sure to cook off all the juices. I also added additional breadcrumbs and 1 additional whole egg to get the patties to stick together better. The recipe was enough for 9 diner sized burgers, and I grilled them outside for about 15 minutes on medium direct heat flipping only once. They turned out delicious, and even the carnivores didn't miss the meat. This will be a regular staple for outdoor grilling season. Easy to make

I have really enjoyed this recipe.   The first time I added quinoa as a previous reviewer suggested.   Today I used rolled oats and also added a bit of siracha (1 tsp?) because I like spice.   It was great as a 'hamburger' with avacado and tomato on top.   This will become one of my regular vegetarian recipes for meatless Mondays.

So good! My husband, who loves meat, and my 15 month old daighter both gobbled this up and loved it! I added extra garlic, oregano and parmesan cheese because we are big on flavor and wow was it good! very easy to make.

Had veggie burgers before and this one is one of the best I have ever made. The flavors are incredibly awesome! The patty had a crust on the outside and it was not mushy on in the inside, it's was firm and so yummy. My patty did not fall apart, I followed the instructions and it came out perfect. I topped my veggie patty with Swiss cheese and a slice of tomato on a whole wheat bun. I also had a side of my spicy sweet potato fries. Yummy! I will make this again.

I don't really like mushrooms, but I picked this recipe because it had few ingredients and looked easy. These were fantastic! Didn't taste like mushrooms at all and they were so meaty and filling. So good I'll be using this as my veggie burger recipe now

I had already made the meatball version of this recipe (also on Chef John's website) and was absolutely amazing! Even my carnivorous family members loved it! I definitely recommend this recipe as it is.For more protein I sometimes substitute the breadcrumbs with fine bulgur.

I turned this into a meatless meatloaf by baking it at 350 degrees for 45 minutes and letting stand for 10. I also made mushroom gravy for it and it was LOVELY!!!

Delicious! I added a little bit of garlic powder and onion powder to this recipe for extra flavour. Oh and I forgot to add the oats, but... it came out perfect. They were sticky enough to form nice burgers and after frying they became crispy from the outside and meaty inside. Yummy. Thanks for the recipe, I now make this every month.

Made this twice now and both times were hit - even with meat lovers (including myself!). The base recipe was a fantastic base for personal modifications, so thank you for sharing. My adjustments: 3-part mix of shiitake mushrooms, brown field mushrooms and white button mushrooms. I found the mushroom combination really added more depth to flavour and texture. Used fresh thyme and oregano from my garden. Also added a sprinkle of freshly ground nutmeg and splash of Worcestershire sauce. TIPS: cut mushrooms into small pieces before pan frying, as this avoids messy chopping after cooking them; DO allow the mixture to rest for about 15 mins as suggested - the oatmeal and breadcrumbs will really soak up all liquids, which avoids a "watery" burger from falling apart.

The best veggie burger yet.  I am a true meat lover.  But am always looking for good healthy meat substitute recipes.  Never cared much for the bean based veggie burgers.  The flavor and textures were not even close to ground beef.  But seriously, with the first few bites of  this burger, you really can't tell that this is not real meat.  Low calorie, low carb meat substitute, what's not to love?

This veggie burger is very tasty. I will definitely make them in the future. I did some tweeking. During the saute process I added small diced celery (2 ribs),  a 1/2 of a fresh red pepper finely diced and a finely chopped blend of super greens (kale, spinach, chard). I ate mine on a whole wheat english muffin.  I also replaced the oregano for a dried italian blend and added some dried parsley.   I think they are good enough to use as Chef John's meatless meatballs.

To be honest, I wasn't really expecting much from this recipe. But they turned out amazing. I had to make some adjustments because of available ingredients. I used scallions and added a little extra minced onion. I also used about half the amount of mushrooms that the recipe called for. I used 1/3 cups to make each potty. I cooked them on my George Foreman grill for about six minutes. I added a little cheese and left them on the grill for a further minute. I am very happy with this recipe and I will definitely make these burgers again ??

Loved this mushroom burger.  It was easy to make. I would suggest putting all of the ingredients in bowls if you're going to follow along with chef John's video and chop the mushrooms into small pieces instead of slicing (John chops after the slices are saut√©ed and this makes chopping which does eventually does in the video, messy).

Looks like Earls may be using this recipe as their Forager burger: https://earls.ca/news/new-gourmet-burgers-for-limited-time-only

I tried a mushroom burger at Earls and loved it. Decided to GOogle a recipe and came across this. When you compare the description of the Forager to this, they seem identical.

Once again, Chef John does not disappoint.  I made these last night and my carnavore husband really liked them.  The only changes I made was to dice the mushrooms prior to cooking and I added two generous shakes of Worcestershire to the mixture.  It also helped to put the patties in the freezer so they were easier to cook without them falling apart.  I froze the leftover patties and I can't wait to serve them again!

I made this last night (2 servings) for my husband who is a vegetarian. It made 2 patties with a little left over. He liked it very much and the recipe came together quickly. I was busy making 2 other dinners so I sort of rushed the prep but then put the mixture in the fridge. I made burgers when he was ready to eat and fried it on both sides for a few minutes but we normally bake our vegeburgers. He like it and I will make this again.

So good!  Yum ??!.  As a person who doesn‚Äôt eat meat, it is nearly impossible to find a ‚Äúburger‚Äù with good taste and as importantly, remarkably good texture.   (Veggie burgers are mushie, and tofu burgers are dry.). I used steel-cut instead of rolled oats (because that‚Äôs what I had on-hand).  Also, found that the recipe made  9 sizable (2/3 cup raw) burgers.  Very happy to have finally found an excellent , meatless ‚Äúburger‚Äù.

This was a BIG hit! Hubby loved them. Looking forward to making them again very soon, and maybe varying the seasonings a bit. We also thought it might be good to form the patties ahead of time, wrap them tightly, and refrigerate, in hopes that they hold together a little better. Cooked the burgers in a nonstick skillet with a small amount of oil - I think it was important not to disturb them until they start getting browned. That also helps them hold together better. In any case, they were delicious and we will definitely make them again!

We loved this!  One of my favorite veggie burger recipes so far. The only thing I would change is to half the recipe next time (cooking for 2 people) because we had a lot of leftovers.

So far, this is the best recipe I've tried for a mushroom burger. I did add more mushrooms and less bread crumbs. I added some liquid hickory smoke and a little soy sauce to the mix.  I think letting the ingredients sit for 15 minutes is what made this recipe better than the others I've tried. The texture was almost there, but this is a great recipe to work with.

Added liquid smoke and Worcestershire for additional flavor. Also tried this with scallions and dried chives instead of yellow onion. Very good for non meat burger.

These came out great. I used a large onion and  added a large red pepper to the recipe.  The 24 ounces of mushrooms were taking a long time to release  and evaporate their liquid. After the mushroom/onion/red pepper mixture was sufficiently cooked. I strained the liquid and ran the mixture through the grate blade on my Cuisinart.  Following this, I strained the mixture again and continued with the rest of the ingredients. I skipped waiting 15 minutes and made about a dozen patties. I will definitely make this again.

Made these tonight and oh wow!!! Made exactly as posted, no changes! By far, these were the best non meat burgers I've ever had and actually better than most of the meat burgers I've had. It was a looser texture, but dense enough to hold together with a little care taken while cooking. Very flavorful in a great way. It was actually a bit hard to tell that it wasn't just very tender mild ground beef. If you've ever had a juicy filet burger, you know this texture.

We suggest they be served with provolone, brioche buns and perfectly ripe tomatoes. Yum!

This is honestly one of my favorite recipes. A few things to note: I have an egg allergy so did not add those, and was still able to form a burger that stayed together. I also make a full batch and keep it in a covered container that lasts several days, so can eat the rest later in the week. Finally, I do not think this tastes anything like a real burger as other reviewers noted / they may taste as good, but definitely taste different. Enjoy!

This was okay.  Mine did not stay together and I cooked my shrooms for a very long time.  I have made mushroom meatballs and didn't have an issue with those staying together.

Made this pretty much like the recipe called for, but used 4 very large portobello mushrooms (18 ounces total).  Chopped them up before saut√©ing them.  Scaled down the rest of the ingredients to 3/4 of the original amounts.  Made 4 six ounce burgers.  Turned out great, and everyone loved them.  Used algae oil instead of olive oil to reduce the saturated fat content.  Will definitely make this again.  Will probably make the patties a bit smaller, as they were quite large and rich.

I did a combination of the edits of others: 1.) Cooked the mushrooms until there's barely any moisture which took about 15 minutes on med-high heat in a big skillet so they weren't piled on top of each other.  2.) Added about 10 dashes of Worcestershire sauce to the mushrooms while they cooked 3.) Used one cup of cooked parmesan flavored quinoa in place of bread crumbs  4.) Added way more Italian seasoning mix 5.) Let it rest/chill for about an hour 6.) Baked for eight minutes on each side @ 400 degrees. YUM YUM YUM

I thought this recipe was good, but very time-consuming for the amount of patties. It reminded me a lot of the stuffing for a mushroom stuffed mushroom dish I sometimes make at Christmas crossed with the now long-defunct mushroom burgers from Trader Joes. I used baby bella 'shrooms for this. I also noted it had MUCH more flavor after sitting in fridge a few hours to overnight  so I will build that into the process. I will make the following changes the next time I make them: double the recipe so I can cook and have some in freezer for an easy healthy meal; add more garlic, add worchestershire sauce, add a small amount of a meltier grated cheese to the recipe, like a bit of grated mozzarella; use homemade breadcrumbs; finely chop the mushrooms instead of slice, then cook alone in butter/oil mixture on higher heat to carmelize, then saute the garlic/onion on lower heat and add to the cooked mushrooms along with the rest of the ingredients. Serve with A-1 sauce on warm french roll halfs with a salad.

Super great texture and flavor. Personal preference would like a bit more kick so will add hot sauce or red chili flakes next time.

I thought I had all the ingredients, didn't. So, I substituted dill for oregano and the cheese for a combination of mozzarella and and Italian 5 blend. It was amazing. This is going to be a regular.

I followed this recipe exactly. It browned up nicely in the pan. I like that it had a nice neutral flavor. Most veggie burgers taste like black beans, or mushrooms; usually whatever main ingredient used overpowers the "burger" taste, but this was pretty spot on. My only change would be to make a slightly thinner patty next time so I get more of the crispy browning. I dressed my burger with catsup, yellow mustard and pickle relish just to see how it compared to a beef burger. Overall good, a keeper recipe.

OMG...this turned out so good! I cut the recipe to serve just 2 since that's all I needed, however I did use 1 large egg, plus 1 T. tahini and 1/2 T. soy sauce like others had suggested. Also, I used my food processor to finely chop the mushrooms before cooking. Nevertheless, the patties held together beautifully and tasted delicious. I will definitely make this again and will see if I can get my grand-daughter who doesn't like mushrooms to eat this. I served the burger on Chef John's "Homemade Hamburger Buns"...don't think it could have been any better.

Really good! I scaled it down to 1 serving, so ingredients were hard to be exact on, but served on a whole wheat bun, with a little cheese melted on top - excellent!

I made sure that the mushrooms and onions were not runny. Also put them into an immersion blender to make everything much finer than cutting and found that the burgers really held up. Delicious and will be making them again but adding a can of black beans for protein.

These taste great. I stacked them in tupperware raw on parchment for the freezer. Next time I make these I want a burger press  to give them a nice shape, mine kind of fell apart around the edges. I might try adding another egg also? Yum.

For bread crumbs I broke up some hard bread from the store that had been buttered. It smelled a little sweet. I think it added to the flavor. These were really delicious and I will be making them again probably many times and trying some flavor variations. The texture was also good.

I used 1/2 shittake mushrooms and 1/2 white button mushrooms. I also used stuffing bread crumbs instead of the breadcrumbs.  I cut up a jalepeno, including seeds, and added it while cooking the mixture. We melted jalepeno cheese on top of the burger when almost done.  Whole family loved them including meat-eaters!

Although it takes quite a long time to chop the mushrooms, the end result is well worth it. So yummy. I wouldn't say that it has a meat-like texture, but it was a good texture. Nicely flavored and gets good and crispy on the outside with pan frying.

I did like it more than the frozen meat analog burgers, but I think it needs a little something. Next time, I'm going to add some parsley and some other spices as well as some shredded carrots and maybe peas.

Did not like as a veggie burger, but this works really well as a mushroom loaf cold sandwich.

I made it exactly to the recipe and really enjoyed the patties.  Next time I will try substituting the oats for cooked rice, just for fun.

I've been looking for mushroom veggie burger recipes since I ate it at a local restaurant, and this is by far the best mushroom veggie burger I've ever tasted. I even got my meat-lover sister to eat it. She wasn't convinced it's a real burger at first, but then she loved it!

I've come back to this recipe over and over for five years now.  These mushroom burgers are delicious.  BUT, I've made some adjustments that I think are worth mentioning:
You need to add an extra egg, and another 1/4 cup of bread crumb and 1/4 cup of oats.
I don't cook the mushrooms in the first round with the onions and garlic.  They cook enough when the patties go in the pan on medium heat.  This was a happy accident one time when I forgot to cook the mushroom at first.  Just be sure to give them enough time in the pan.  About 4 minutes each side.  They turn out great.  They are just a touch more  firm in the middle, as they aren't rubbery the way mushrooms can get when cooked to long, and it's also less oily.
I add about three tbsp of fresh thyme to the garlic and onions in the pan.
A huge thank you to Chef John who put this up years ago!

These were so good! Even my 27 1/2 month old son gobbled these up!!!! Hubs LOVED them!!!!! Instead of mushrooms, I used angus beef and instead of bread crumbs, I used Cheez-It crackers, and I used grits instead of rolled oats and chopped potatoes instead of an onion. I also added paprika to give it a little KICK!!!! Hubs LOVED it!!!! He couldn't put them down!! He ate every last bite and then had explosive diarrhea for 18 hours!!!! Oh hubs!!!!

I made this recipe from the Meatless Meatball Recipe which made really good meatballs - my grandson who was reared a vegetarian loved them and said they were the best veggie meatballs he had ever eaten - I will definitely make more.

Gluten and I don't get along well,  so I tried this recipe with the quinoa substitution and GF quick oats. Sadly,  it must have been too much moisture, as the patties fell apart.  I made the best of it,  though,  and chopped it up like one would a meat hash. Then,  it was  AMAZING.  In fact,  I'll be making it again for breakfast with eggs on top tomorrow.  ?

I definitely prefer a grilled burger over a fried one.. But this was really good regardless. Next time I won't drain the water that leaked from the mushrooms, because I think that made my patty too dry.

Also some worcetershire sauce (1 twblespoon) but newxt time I will add two. I also added some crushed chilis. I made these in the oven (170C for 20 min) brishing them with some drops of oil.

Great "burger." I had problems keeping mine together--it could be that I used Panko instead of regular bread crumbs. Other than the lack of cohesion, these taste great and are pretty easy! Will make again! Thanks for a great recipe!

These are soooo good, so savory that even my meat loving daughter didnt miss the meat at all. And you dont have to love mushrooms either to like these burgers. The final product tastes rich and earthy but not necessarily mushroom-y.  I will definitely make these again

This is my go-to veggie burger. I cook  the mushrooms and onions  then quickly put it in a food processor to get the consistency I like. Then I just cook until all the water has evaporated.

Loved it! This was so good and so easy. I am trying to find ways to cut calories and still enjoy my food. This is going to become a common meal in my home. The only thing I did differently was put instant steel cut oats instead of rolled oats because that is what I had.  Went great with Cauliflower (faux mashed potatoes).
