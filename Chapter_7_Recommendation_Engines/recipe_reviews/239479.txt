I omitted the celery (for some reason, I didn't have any on hand this week and didn't want to spend extra money at the store), increased the garlic and went a little easy with the chili powder. I used pre-cooked brown rice. Heating this through for 20 minutes was unnecessary. I think if I had done that, my rice would have been WAY overcooked. Tasty, though a little salty for our tastes. The kids especially liked this. NO leftovers.

Had to make one substitution, otherwise, followed the recipe.  I found out I didn't have any bell peppers, so I ended up adding some sliced olives, and they worked well.  This is moist, quick-to-make, and a delicious version of Spanish rice.  Thumbs up in this house!

This was really good.  I used olive oil instead of the butter, also brown rice,  and chicken bouillon to go with a chicken dinner.  I remember using bacon in an old Spanish Rice recipe, so next time I think I will use bacon grease instead of olive oil or butter for a little extra flavor.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

Thanks for posting this recipe, since it seems that most folks have forgotten all about this delicious old side dish which our moms made 'back in the day'.  The only thing that I did differently was to use brown rice instead of white, because that's what I always use.  We all loved it, so I'll definitely be making it more often.  Thank you for reminding us about this  easy & delicious side dish.

I was out of canned tomatoes and substituted salsa. I also omitted the salt & added a can of black beans. It turned out delicious! This was a side to fish tacos & the whole family Loved it. It's a keeper in my recipe book. I highly recommend this one.

Very nice baseline.  I used EVOO instead of butter.  3 Tbls of premium chili powder and tomato sauce instead of tomatoes.  We  like heat so also added some red pepper flakes and hot sauce.  Very good and I'm sure it will be even better tomorrow.
