Tried this recipe for dinner last night--my husband, my mom, & I all 3 LOVEd them! Absolutely delicious & super-easy to make; the hardest part of the whole recipe is folding up the edges of the crescent dough & trying to get the chicken filling to stay inside, but I may have overfilled slightly! Will DEFINITELY be making these again soon!

this recipe was very bland. While im not a fan of cream cheese, my boys and husband liked the cheeseness. I used canned chicken and separated it using a fork, then mixed it with the other ingredients. I used canned biscuits and created a handheld pouch so my young boys can hold them. I would recommend adding dry ranch seasoning or other seasoning mixes.

I used baked chicken breasts that had been breaded with bread crumbs seasoned with Italian Seasoning.  I think the Italian Seasoning made the difference, otherwise they would have been very bland.  Some dry ranch dressing would definitely be a good choice if using plain chicken.  I really loved these.  Husband poured on hot sauce but said they were good.  I separated the crescents into triangle to make individual pouches.  Very good and easy and I will make these again.

So, I was excited to try this one, my kids are sooo picky! The verdict is that they both liked it...ok. I cooked the chicken in chicken broth & rice wine vinegar. I seasoned with salt and pepper, onion powder, and rosemary. I omitted the onion so that I would not hear my kids complain. I used the large size crescent rolls. My husband and I really enjoyed these large "purses" of chicken and I would make again trying different ingredients.

Granted it's not the most flavorful recipe ever... but for something quick that picky kids will eat, this definitely fits the bill. Also, my husband loved it. My three year old had two! So success. Definitely melt the cream cheese and butter together then add sautéed onions and seasonings, then chicken. Use 2 crescent roll tubes and put triangles together to make squares. The chicken will fit in the squares better and it will look tons better too. I had extra filling and put it in wraps with some romaine for lunch the next day, just ate then cold. Yum!

Great recipe ~ pretty much the same as "Savory Crescent Chicken" from this site. From those reviews, I make this recipe with 4 oz cream cheese, a dollop of sour cream rather than the milk, and add garlic salt. My children and husband love them. Serve with peas; they compliment each other. (Also, the other recipe calls for crushed croutons, which are Ok on top, but not necessary. It depends on my mood if I choose to add them.)

This recipe was awesome!  My fiancé is a very picky eater but you wouldn't know that the way he ate these. I liked the simplicity and how innovative the recipe is. Because I use plain bread crumbs I added some garlic powder to them. Other than that I followed the recipe as is and I'm am very happy with the result.  GREAT JOB on this one and thanks for sharing!  :)

This one of our favs!  We like to add shredded cheese and bacon pieces before wrapping it up.  We have also added a little bit of Salsa to give it a different taste.  Made it using biscuits as well instead of crescent rolls.    Lots of different seasoning will give this a little different flavor each time.

these were so good! I've made them using both the crescent rolls and at other times homemade dough but keep the rest of the recipe exactly as written. I can't stop eating them!

Loved it. We have a toddler,so hard to make yummy dinners that are tasty & hearty. Only change I made was added sour cream & no butter to mix. Plus added some white cheddar cheese & tasted fantastic!!.
We make this at least twice a month if not more. Even the filling is great to eat with whole wheat crackers. :-) or can be made as a calzone

These are pretty much the same as the Savory Chicken Crescent Squares from a Pillsbury recipe booklet, it is a great recipe.  My sister asks me often to make "those chicken dingers", so that's what we call them.  Chicken Dingers.

Marinated chicken in captain Morgan ;) I added green onions for a not so much onion flavor. Mixed in some yellow and green peppers to the mix. Dry ranch made it a lil to salty. Other than that turned out great!

My husband and I loved it!  I had an 8 oz package of cream cheese and used about 3/4 of it.  I also added a third of a package of dry Italian dressing mix after reading some of the comments about ranch.

The Kids LOVED it, I tripled it and did some with the ranch dressing and everyone really enjoyed them.
