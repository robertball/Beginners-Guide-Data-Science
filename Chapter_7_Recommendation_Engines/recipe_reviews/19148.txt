There IS a trick to this recipe!  When you spread the cream cheese/Cool Whip layer, you need to "seal off" the pretzel layer.  In other words, you need to spread it on carefully and make NO corners or edges are left out where the jello layer can seep in.  If your pretzels turned out soggy (mine did the first time i did this recipe), you didn't spread the cream cheese/Cool Whip on properly.  When it comes out right (with crunchy pretzels), this recipe is delicious!

YEAH!   My family has been using this recipe for years.  I lost my copy and was SO happy to find it.  One tip -- if you buy the larger container of whipped topping, you can spread that on top of the strawberries for   and extra layer.  AND if you're feeling even more adventerous slice fresh strawberries on top.  NOTES:  1.  cut the water back to 1 cup -- the frozen strawberries will add the extra water. Otherwise your gelitan will be too soft.  2.  make sure you seal pretzel crust with the cream cheese / whipped topping layer.  Otherwise the liquid will seep into the pretzel layer and make it soggy.

I make this dessert all the time and everyone always loves it. I do the jello/frozen fruit layer differently however....I pour the package of jello into a bowl and add 1 cup of boiling water to it. Then I use the quick set method on the side of the jello box by adding 1 1/2 cups of ice water to the jello and refridgerate for about 20 minutes then I add the frozen strawberries/raspberries. I wait until the jello is half set before pouring it over the well-sealed cream cheese mixture. I hope this helps some of you - I've never had my pretzel layer get soggy this way.

Im only giving this recipe 4 stars since the recipe itself isnt all that accurate.  Ive made a different version of this...The final product itself though (when done right) is awesome!  I just think that there are some mistakes on the directions themselves. ******These are the changes I made: 1 cup melted butter rather than margarine 1 1/2 packages (16oz) frozen whole strawberries, thawed 1 plus 1 partial (6oz) package strawberry gelatin  I started the jello right away since I knew that it would need to PARTIALLY Set in the refridgerator while I prepared the rest of the ingredients.   I did use the 2 cups of boiling water, but I also added about 1/4 of the 2nd package of jello to ensure it sets correctly.  Once I added the strawberries (which were mostly thawed, I used a potato masher to crush them a bit). I transfered the entire saucepan of jello into the fridge and began the next steps.  It is also very important to complete the baking process as well as sealing off the entire layer of pretzels to prevent the jello from seeping  into the pretzel.  HOWEVER, the seeping wont be much of an issue if the jello is partially set (like jelly/jam texture almost) and the cream cheese layer is well chilled after you layer it. Pour jello over cream cheese layer and chill at least a few more hours to set properly.  The directions make it seem like this is a  fast, quick step process.  But each step takes time in between for setting, chilling and setting!

I have a friend that makes this (her own recipe) and this one turned out nothing like hers.  She said to cut the water back to 1 cup boiling water.  She said there was too much water.  I stirred it on the stove(water,strawberries&jello) for 20 min and it just wouldn't thicken.  I poured it on top of the pretzels & cheese and it leaked underneath the dessert and made the pretzels soggy.  None of the jello stayed on top.  When my friend makes it it looks like a perfect casserole with the jello nice and neat on top.

THIS IS SO GOOD, i DO COOL EACH LAYER AND COMPLETLY COVER PETZELS WITH CREAM CHEESE LAYER TO SEAL AN PROTECT PRETZELS FROM GETTING SOGGY. ALSO I BOIL WATER FOR GELATIN (OR FRUIT JUICE) THEN REMOVE FROM HEAT, STIR IN FROZEN FRUIT AND REFRIGERATE FOR 30-60 MINS, TIL IT STARTS TO FORM OR SET, THEN POUR OVER CREAM CHEESE LAYER.. NEVER HAS IT EVER FAILED. I ALSO HAVE USED CHOCOLATE WHIPPED CREAM OR COCOA TO WHIPPED CREAM TO MAKE IT MORE A CHOCOLATE COVERED STRAWBERRY FUN THING. aLWAYS TAKE A CLEAN PAN HOME... NEVER ANY LEFT OVERS. SSSOOOOOOO       GGGGGGGGOOOOOOOOODDDDDD   THANKS FOR RECIPE

My middle daughter requests this dessert instead of a cake on her birthday. The key to making this dessert turn out great is to be sure and seal the cream cheese/whipped topping layer around the edges so the cooled Jello won't seep into the pretzel layer below. The sweet/salty crust is a nice compliment to the other layers. This is a winner with my family.

I have to say that I do love this dessert but when making it for the first time, my jello did not thicken like the directions said it would.  I had to place the jello and strawberry mixure in the fridge for quite a while til it set up. I was very disappointed by this clinch in the directions.

This recipe is FANTASTIC!!  I have been making this very recipe for 10 years, only I make mine with Raspberries instead of Strawberries.  I think it adds a nice tartness to the dish.  I am definently going to try the strawberries next time, and I recommend that you try it with the raspberries!  YUM!

At first glance, this recipe seems odd, but believe me, it is great.  I have been making it for years and have used all different flavors of jello.  You can make it a light low fat dessert if you use the sugarfree jello, fresh fruit, low fat cool whip and low fat cream cheese and you would never know it is lowfat.  Great for social events because it makes a large amount.  Enjoy!

Good old classic dessert. Do as the other reviewers suggested... 1. "seal" the crust with the whipped cream cheese layer or it will sogg. 2. let jello cool way down in the fridge before pouring it over the top (I let it go till it was like a soupy jelly).

I loved this reciped when I was a kid.  It is my favorite and this is about perfect!  Do make sure you cover every inch of your pretzel crust so it won't get soggy.  Also, when I did my strawberry topping I tossed the strawberries with the jello and got out my immersion blender, and chunked up the strawberries a bit.  I knew my kid's would not like the huge pieces of strawberries, they devoured it this way!  It seemed to take a bit longer to set up, but it was still delish!

Like the recipe, I used the water modification suggested (cut to 1 cup)and made sure the jello set some before pouring it on. However, there is a little too much sugar for me. Maybe I would cut back the sugar in the crust or use less than a full packet of jello for less sugar. Otherwise, it's good

Super simple and good!  I used peach jello and used a combination of frozen strawberries and peaches and I mashed them with a potato masher as they cooked with the jello.  Will make again.

awesome variations: use raspberries, or mixed berries with pomegranats seed. Try zesting a lime into the cream cheese filling. So good! I make this every holiday

This was an interesting twist on a cheesecake like pie.  I used 1/3 less pretzels and butter and only 1 cup water which as I have read helps it set better.  Still in my opinion, not a bad pie by any means.

I made this last night and it turned out perfect.  I give it 4 stars instead of 5 stars because in the filling, if you could add powdered sugar instead of granulated, I think it would be perfect.  Even after using my mixer for several minutes, the sugar was still a little gritty in the filling.  But overall this is a great recipe for a crowd.  I'm having to give some to my neighbor because we just can't finish it all off.  Don't get in a hurry with each step and you'll do fine.

I had this at Thanksgiving this year when I was invited to a friend's house. She said she wasn't too "into" the strawberries so she used raspberries. It was MARVELOUS! I love, love, loved it and am excited to get this recipe!

Unbelievable!  We thought we really screwed this up, but the trick is to make the cool whip layer completely cover the pretzals so they don't get soggy.  Served at a party and was gone instantly!!  Would definitely make as-is again.

Over all this was excellent 1 child didn't like the strawberries themselves, but loved the jello and everything else. The other children loved it. I liked it but my only complaint would be---I had to preform jello retachment surgery before taking the photo. The little booger (the jello part) decided to fly right off the top of the cream cheese layer in route to the plate. And the crust was a bit crumble---but oh so darn good. I might have used a little bit more butter and sugar to get a firmer crust out of it, but it was really a crunchy goodness part of the recipe. I did use unsalted butter because there was plenty of salt from the pretzels....Will totally make again. But for my son, I won't be adding the straberry fruit in for him because of his preference.

My daughter's old teacher was making this dessert when my daughter called her to wish her a happy birthday, so I decided to look up the recipe.  There were so many similar recipes but I decided to go with this one after reviewing many comments and tips.    My son crushed the pretzels and it came to about 2 cups crushed.  We used 1 1/2 stick of butter as that is what I had left in the house (and other variations of this recipe called for this amount.)  I use the 1/3 fat cream cheese.  My local store only had 16 oz bags of whole frozen strawberries so I went with those and sliced them. One thing that was confusing about this recipe, and the reason I only gave this 4 stars, is that in the last step it says to stir in the frozen strawberries after it is boiling and it makes it sound as if you should leave it on the stove to get it to thicken.  If I am not mistaken, Jello will not thicken if it continues to boil, it needs to cool.  If I had not read other recipes and the comments I may have made this mistake.  However, I took the saucepan and let it cool in the fridge for about 30 minutes then I poured it over the cream cheese mixture.   I also followed what other reviewers had said and made sure the cream cheese layer completely sealed off the pretzel layer.   I put this in 2- 9 inch pie plates and it was perfect.  Except that after it set and I covered it with foil the Jello layer stuck right to the foil.  I also liked it better the next day, the pretzels were less crunchy.

Delicious.  This turned out great.  Use only 1 cup of water though.  As other reviewers stated, definitely be sure to seal off the pretzel layer w/ the cream chz mixture.  Also, let the layers cool completely before topping w/ the next layer.  The jello should start to set up a little b/4 you pour it on the cream chz mixture. When prepared this way, you should definitely have a crunchy pretzel crust and a distinct layer of cream cheese and a layer of jello.  I tried it w/ raspberry jello & mixed berries.  That was good but I think I'll stick to the strawberry version.

well,a word to those who have trouble with this recipe:the recipe is not real specific,you need to wait until the pretzels cool completely before you add the cream cheese middle.And wait until the strawberry glaze is at least room temperature.if you wait for stuff to cool it will never flop on you!   ps spread he cream cheese to the edges to seal the crust off so that the crust wont get soggy.

One thing that I do when I make this for my family, is make the prezel crust seperatley. After it cooled I crumbled it and put in tupperware container. Then I make the rest of the recipe the same. It scoops out like jello instead of a bar. Then we spinkle the preztel crust on our portions and eveyone is happy that it is crunchy.  And is good the next day if we dont eat it all.

I love this recipe!  It is a unique recipe that family always loves.  Instead of just using strawberries and strawberry jello, I usually use mixed frozen berries and a mixed berry jello, and it is always a big hit.  I have also used one box of regular jello and one box of sugar free, and you can reduce the sugar with the same tasty results.

This is delicious and easy! I just made this dessert and decided to use fresh peaches from our Peach tree and Peach jello. I also added brown sugar to the crust and to the Peach mixture to give it a more cobbler-ish taste! It turned out great.  Before I used a mix of raspberrys and blackberrys, with raspberry jello. I think I still like that mix best, but the Peach is still Yummy!

Excellent.  Exactly the recipes I was looking for.  I had fresh strawberries and used them.  I just added them to the boiling jello and let them cook a minute so that they would be soft.  Made sure to seal the pretzels as others had mentioned with the cream cheese mixture, and they didn't get soggy.

This did not turn out at all.  The jello never set up and even though I made sure to seal off the pretzel crust, the jello still managed to seep down into it.  It was a total flop.

The granddaughters helped to make this on Christmas Day.  I was confused by the ending directions.  The gelatin never thickened and I was not sure whether to pour the hot liquid over the cream cheese mixture or not.  I did.  It was good but the liquid made the pretzels soggy after a while.  I will make it again, though.

Nice crunch, refreshing strawberry, and creamy filling, this is a great treat!  I did read the recipe wrong and used 15oz pretzel by mistake.  I also didn't crush it fine enough.  Needless to say, the pretzel crust didn't set and pieces are too big.  It was still very good, but next time, I might coarsely grind the pretzel in a food processor.  Then add some bigger crushed pieces so it stil have good crunch.  
I was very careful not to let the jello liquid go to the bottom of the dish because many people wrote they ended up with mushy pretzel crust.  Once the cream mixture was spread corner to corner, "sealed," as some said, I refrigerated it for 30 min.  I waited until jello liquid cooled down to room temp.  I would put more strawberry though, it gives great texture.  This is now my new favorite dessert!

This dessert did not work out.  My mom used to make me this type of dessert when I was growing up.  The photo of the finished results is more accurate than mine.  The steps and the measurements have to be off because when I put the cream cheese and whipped topping on, it would not cover the entire crust.  I tried to salvage it and spread it really thin and managed to have about a millimeter thick topping prior to adding the jello mixture.  I added the jello mixture to the topping and it wasn't cool enough so it made the whipped topping mix with the jello.  Then it leaked down to the pretzel crust.  All I ended up having was a waste of ingredients and a mess.

Wow...I have tried making a pretzel dessert several times and I could never get the jello to set.  I thought...Okay, I'll try it one more time with this recipe and it finally worked!! Thanks for the recipe, it was awesome.
