This was actually a pretty good dish!  We are not vegetarians, but we are trying to be healthier and also feed a family on a budget, which involves cutting down our meat intake.  I'm not sure this dish fulfilled being healthy, but it was fairly cheap and made a lot!  After trying lots of bean (and budget) dishes, with edible but ho-hum results from my husband, this was a welcome change!  The sun-dried tomato basil absolutely made this dish!  He ate two helpings, and while it isn't his favorite food in the world, he did say he would eat it again if I made it.  I did change a few things though -- I used large pasta shells instead of manicotti, just because they're easier to stuff.  I replaced the ricotta with cottage cheese, because it's healthier, cheaper, and it's what I always do with lasagnas.  I also used a combination of mozzarella and parmesan cheese -- I didn't have any asiago.  I used dried garbanzo beans which I boiled down, then weighed out 16 oz. of beans on the kitchen scale and that made plenty of filling!  I would definitely NOT bump it up to 32 oz. of beans next time, but I don't know how they weigh the cans, so maybe I was pretty close to the same amount anyways.  I only had dried parsley so I just shook a little into my filling and didn't really measure it out.

Strange design, but tasty outcome!  It was very beany and possibly a little too beany.  Maybe throw some other veggies in a food processor and sprinkle them into the bean mix.

LOVED this recipe!  I'll never make regular Manicotti again.  The tomato pesto and garbanzo beans add great flavor.

LOVE this recipe!!!  My whole family gobbles it right up, even my meat and potato hubby.  My Mom was skeptical but pleasantly surprised when I made it for her.
