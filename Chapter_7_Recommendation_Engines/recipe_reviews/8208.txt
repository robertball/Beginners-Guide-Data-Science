I added 1 cup of suger to the recipe and shifted suger and cinnamon on top when it was done baking and it was very good. My two year old granddaughter loved it, Thanks.

Good cake/rice pudding!  I don't think cake is a good title for this but either way it's quite yummy.  I was concerned that there was no sugar but I figured the submitter left it out on purpose.  Based on other reviews, I decided to split the batch between 2 8x8 glass dishes.  One batch was made exactly as instructed, the other had 1/3c sugar added to it.  The sugar batch was sweet, the original was a little more mellow.  The golden raisins gave so much sweetness it really makes up for the lack of sugar.  Both ways taste great but next time I think I'll add maybe 1/2c sugar to the whole batch.  The pic is of the original version, no sugar added.

Excellent flavor...much better than I expected. I made this for a Polish festival dinner and it went well...even the young kids wanted more.  I did add 1 1/3 cup sugar and it was perfect. I also used raisins soaked in rum for added flavor. A definte Polish keeper.

I loved this recipe and did not add any sugar, but served with a strawberry compote instead

This recipe was an impressive success at my church coffee hour.  I thought the Polish rice cake might make a nice change from the usual Danish's and doughnuts.  People actually sought me out to get the recipe.  Its moist texture and not-too-sweet taste remind me of other Polish cakes I've tried.  The recipe doesn't call for sugar, but I decided to add 1/2 cup of white sugar.

Pretty good. However, I found the rice a little too "al dente". Next time I'd probably add more milk when cooking the rice or substitute long-grain with arborio. I also found that adding 1 cup of sugar was not enough. I think that 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 cups would be best. I baked it in a 10" spring-form and sprinkled the top with a little cinnamon. All-in-all it is a pretty easy cake to make and it tasted even better 2 days later.

The consistancy of this was good but it wasn't a hit at my house. I regret not having read that others added sugar to it, if I had done that I think my family would have eaten more of it!!

First time I made this it was very bland.  The second time I used a little less milk and added a small can of sweetened condensed milk and it was perfect!  So very close to the way my mother-in-law made it!  Finally!

WOW this was truly good. I did use the suggestion to add the cup and sugar and top off with cinnamon. Everyone loved it.

Made this recipe for something different for Thanksgiving being that my husband is half Polish.  I followed recipe to the T.  Not a hit with anyone at the Thanksgiving table.  My children said I should have made my rice pudding instead.  The cake was just to dry.

I love this cake. It's not too sweet and it's wonderfully dense. 
I sometimes make it following this recipe and sometimes I will use 3 cups  of coconut milk to make this a coconut rice cake, my family loves it ??

yes yes and more yes.  I did add a bit of sugar to the cooking rice.  You can add any kind of dried fruit in it.  It's great.  My husband and I love it.  I am making it AGAIN this week.

Im not a picky eater...at all...but this recipe did not do it for me. I love anything with rice and cream cheese but this was not great. Its edible but not someting I'll make again...this recipe does call for sugar and still I really didnt like it very much. If you are still interested in making the rice cake cut the recipe in half just in case u dont like.

Surprisingly rich and tasty. I made this as written, and we just sprinkled it with brown sugar when it was cooked. Thanks, Shirley!

This is a genuine Polish Rice Cake recipe. You can substitute regular flour with baking powder for the self-rising flour or use Bisquick Brand flour as I have for forty years.

I love this recipe, but I have to add 1 1/4 cups of sugar to it. I doubt it would taste as good without it.

Very tasty!!! Only cut back on the butter to 1/2 cup. I forgot to add vanilla, but it stil was a nice thick cake - a bit like cornbread, only more sticky and cakish.
