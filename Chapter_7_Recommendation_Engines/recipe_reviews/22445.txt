This recipe is great because it has no eggs but has the same texture as egg salad.  Be careful not to blend th tofu to much.  It has an excellent favor.

I really liked this recipe I added a dash of Cayenne and Black pepper to make it a little spicier.

4 stars for flavor plus an extra star for having low fat ingredients.  I did do 1 tbsp of low fat miracle whip and 1 tbsp of low fat mayonnaise. I also mashed up tofu with a spoon instead of food processing it, to leave more texture.   If you like deviled eggs, you'll like this.

This is a good recipe, but the name is misleading.. if you have egg allergies, mayo has eggs. i bought extra tofu and made tofu mayo from this site.. taste wise, it is good.

If you do not eat eggs but want a salad like egg salad then this is good. It does have a very similar taste and texture to real egg salad but does not have the same depth. I still prefer real egg salad but glad I tried this as an alternative. I did not pulse the tofu through the food processor but instead broke it up into chunks and folded it with the processed mixture. I did season with salt, pepper and paprika. This would be five stars if the processed mix was a bit richer ... maybe omitting the yogurt and using all mayo instead.

This is a 5-Star recipe!!  It has a wonderful flavor and would also work well on celery or crackers.  The only change I made was to reduce the green onions to one - five would most likely be overpowering for my taste.  Sharing with friends who are low carb diets.

I really love this!  I actually think it does taste like egg salad. After letting it sit overnight, I was blown away. And it’s healthy!  I really don’t like cottage cheese but you can’t tell it’s in there. Thanks!

Pretty good. I added celery and pickle. I'll use eggs for my salad ans save my tofu for other goodies since I am not vegan.

It was OK if you don't eat eggs I guess, I really prefer regular egg salad. I LOVE egg salad so I thought this would be a good alternative but if you eat eggs, I would stick with the "real thing".
