So good and I don't even like rhubarb!!  I used 4 cups of frozen rhubarb so I had to add 3 tablespoons of corn starch because I knew I would have lots of juice.  I lined the pan with parchment paper and added a sheet of tin foil around the springform pan... just in case!!  Next time I'll try fresh rhubarb!  Thanks!!
