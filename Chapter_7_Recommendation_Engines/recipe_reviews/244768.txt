This recipe is delicious! I made the French toast exactly as directed. I didn't have maple extract so I just used 1tsp of vanilla extract for the syrup and it still tasted great! This was pretty easy, quick, and yummy.

I had leftover buttermilk and wanted to use it up for something else. This was a perfect recipe, however, I did not care for it. It tasted sour in spite of the ingredients, but I do have to say that I did not have all the ingredients on hand and had to substitute or eliminate. I used whole wheat bread because I had that on hand. I had no almond extract, but substituted vanilla in place of it. Perhaps it would have made a difference in the taste. I don't feel that having the ingredients listed, though, would make a difference. It is the buttermilk that came through as sour and yet it was fresh buttermilk, not expired. Funny that buttermilk pancakes and waffles have always been fine for me. Nonetheless, I would not care to try it again.

Used challah bread instead and vanilla in place of almond extract. It was amazing. My family said I have to use this recipe from now on!

Very tasty, a great recipe to use up my buttermilk.   I used the buttermilk bread 1 recipe from this site instead of the Texas toast. I accidently put in too much Almont extract and it was very over powering. I'll have to watch that next time, and perhas even reduce it a bit. But this is something I will make again !

This is a very tasty French toast variation.  My wife and I loved it!  (We used Ezekiel Sesame bread because we didnâ€™t have Texas Toast.)
