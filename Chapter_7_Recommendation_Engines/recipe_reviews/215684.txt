Please note that I made a major change! Instead of making boats, I skipped the boiling step and diced the zucchini. I put the zucchini in the baking dish and mixed it with the other ingredients, with the 1 T of parm on top.  (oh, and I omitted bread crumbs because I didn't have any on hand). I baked for 20 minutes, broiled for 3. My family loved it and gobbled it up.

I  believe the recipe is correct. Of the 5 tablespoons  of breadcrumbs, 4 of them is 1/4 cup and the other tablespoon is sprinkled on top. Anyway that's how I did it. It came out great.

Made as written except that I reduced the cooking time (we prefer zucchini a little crisp) and this was pretty darn good. The 1/4 cup of breadcrumbs was left off of the ingredient list so be sure to make note of that when planning. It should be 1/4 cup + 5 tablespoons, divided. 1/4 cup goes in the filling and then the rest if to sprinkle on the top.
