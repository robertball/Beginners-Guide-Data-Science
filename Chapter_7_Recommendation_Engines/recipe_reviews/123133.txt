The recipe for the taco seasoning is pretty decent, but here are some suggestions.

Rather than using table salt and dried garlic, use garlic salt. Halve the amount of salt used, and you can add more garlic powder to taste.

A good taco seasoning and easy to scale back if you don't want to make a large batch.  1/6 of the recipice was more than enough for 2lbs of beef.  I used fresh garlic while browning my meat instead of flaked and cut way back on the salt.

This recipe is generally very good, but too salty.  I'd cut the salt by 1/3 to 1/2.  Perfect spiciness for adults, but I'd cut back the chili powder and red pepper by 1/2 for kids.

Good Mix! I make it for our family and for family friends who are missionaries overseas and they can't get taxo mix there. Changes: *Only 1 tsp. Salt!*, reduced to 1 Tbls. Corn Starch. The minced onion and garlic didn't seem to want to stay mixed up equally with the other ingredients so I ground them up into powder. Another time I decided to use bought powders instead of the minced=3 Tblsp Onoin Powder, 2 tsp garlic powder. Good recipe, but too much salt as is.

I halved the salt in this, and I think it's just about right now!  I also didn't add the beef bullion because I didn't have any on hand.  Tasty!

Needed another packet of taco seasoning but couldn't get out to the store so I looked for one on the site. I found this one and made it. My family really liked it. I followed some reveiws that said to cut the salt to 1 tablespoon but my family felt it could have used more so I'm gonna add some to the container. I also added 3/4 cup of water per pound of meat instead of 1/3. I'm glad I doubled the recipe! Now I'll have it whenever I need.

This was a good recipe but the saltiness overpowered everything else. I cut it in half and it was way salty still. Maybe it is a typo. Maybe it shoud be teaspoons?

Holy tamale! Too danged spicy! I'm making a 2nd batch to add to the first, but excluding the red pepper flakes & chili powder to try to find balance. My husband LOVES spicy foods, but this burned his mouth, so we'll try to save the batch.

Used this in taco salad, and it was pretty good.  I like being able to mix it up myself, instead of buying those packages with who knows what in it.  I did cut back on the salt, and I think if I hadn't it would definitely been too salty.

I really like this recipe, and use it all the time, as I usually have these ingredients on hand.   The only change that I made was to eliminate the salt altogether.  It is so easy to add salt as needed later, and we found this way too salty.  Without the salt in the mix, it's perfect for us.  Thanks for sharing.

being salt sensitive, I reduce the salt to 1/2 tsp. and omitted the beef bouillon and oregano ( I find oregano too bitter for my taste). Will use this recipe from now on for tacos and taco salad.

i ended up making 2 batches of this because the first one was way too salty. i doubled it and omitted the salt on the second batch and it seemed about perfect. I added some smoked paprika but that was the only additional spice. Thanks for the recipe as is though too salty sorry

Good recipe. I ommitted the red pepper flakes as the reason I was making and not buying was due to alleries in the family to red pepper. I added some cayenne pepper per another recipe.

Agree with other reviewers about the salt. I tried 3 teaspoons rather than the 3 tablespoons in the recipe and stll think it was salty. Maybe my beef boulion granules are salty enough I am thinking.

This is really good taco seasoning! I took the advice of others and halved the salt, and it was still pretty salty but not too bad. I also halved the entire recipe, and it still made enough for several taco nights.

The recipe is not to my liking.  Way too salty.  Everyone who rated it highly reduced the salt drastically.  My wife just looked at the stars without reading the reviews so she didn't know that she needed to cut the salt.  As published, this recipe is inedible.

This is fantastic! My family loves it! We like to have tacos at least once a month. My husband can't have a whole lot of salt so the store bought stuff wasn't cutting it. I only put 1 Tbls. of salt in vs the 3 called for and it's great! Never buying taco mix again!

I didn't make enough to store in the pantry. I just did a tryout recipe using each spice a little at a time. I took 1 1/2lbs beef roast and put it into the slowcooker. I used 2 TBSP minced onion, 1/2 tsp chili powder, 1/2 tsp salt, 3 tsp cumin(I like cumin),2 tsp cornstarch, 2 tsp garlic, pinch of red pepper flakes, 1 tsp of oregano.   I cooked the roast for several hours on high and then shredded it. Put it into a pan along with the broth and simmered it on the stove. The meat was so tender. It was perfect for tacos. This is a keeper!!!

I usually omit salt so I didn't run into the problem that others did with too much salt.  However this recipe, while being hot, lacks flavor and needs some salt (that's coming from a non salt person!).  
I doubled the cumin but it is still bland.  I think the 1/3 cup of water is perfect though.  Also the addition of corn starch in this instead of flour makes a good consistency.  
I would suggest trying the taco seasoning 1 recipe instead of this one.

Delicious and EASY taco seasoning!  I cut the salt WAY back- I prefer to salt food after cooking. I think I use less than 1Tb.  I also cut back on the red pepper since my chili powder is a little spicier than most.  I used Mrs. Dash in place of the oregano because I was out!  I keep this in a mason jar in my cabinet at all times.  I like that I can scale the amount of seasoning to the amount of meat that I want to cook, and I know exactly what is in my food.

This is the second homemade taco mix we have tried. We tried one off another website that was very blah. This one was a winner. We did reduce the salt to 1 tsp and reduced the red pepper to 2 tsp (we have small kids) thanks to the advice of others. It was perfect.

I scaled this down to 6 servings which yielded just a bit over 3 Tbs. and used 1.5 lbs. of ground beef. I did cut back the salt a lot though, I only used 1/2 tsp. Even after scaling it down it was calling for 2.5 tsp of salt which is a lot of salt! This had a nice flavor, not spicy, but not too bland either. I'd eat this again although it wasn't good enough to make my favorites, it is still really good. Thanks for sharing your recipe, we had a nice lunch.

First of all I'd like to say, fantastic recipe.  I would have given it 5 BUT there just was way too much salt, and I reduced it by 1 TBSP.  I will further another 1/4 tsp off the recipe.   I looked for dried minced onion but the small country market didn't have it.  So I substituted with Onion Power.  Other than that I followed it to the "T".  I will add more chile peppers, I like a little more bite.  I will NEVER buy another store bought package Taco Seasoning again.  My husband used to complain about an after taste.  I say it was probably the MSG in the packages.  I liked this very much.  so did everyone.  A big hit.  I have gallbladder issue, so my diet requires me to stay away from ground "beef" as much as possible, so I made a pan of chicken for me, and it tasted great with the chicken.

Made this at the last minute, as I didnt have the 'packet'.  Gotta say that I followed other's suggestions and cut the salt in half.  Otherwise, followed the recipe to a T.  It was great.  I may, next time, even cut the salt to a third of what is called for.  I know I wouldnt miss the salt at all.  Wont be buying the packets again.  Thanks Karen.  Great recipe.

These were the most delicious tacos I have ever made. They got raves from my husband and son.  

I was in a hurry making these, and I accidentaly added 1/4 a cup of cumin! Well, it was too late so I just mixed it all in. The only other change I made was cutting the salt to about a teaspoon or so. Even with the mega-dose of cumin, they were outstanding. I will definately make them again.

Is there a zero-star rating???? This was terrible! We cut the salt in half thinking 3 Tbsp was a little much, and it was still so salty it absolutely ruined our dinner. I had to take all the meat off my tacos and just have cheese, lettuce and tomatoes, and still the juice that was left was so salty I could barely choke it down. Awful recipe. Don't make it.

Really liked the recipe, didn't use the granules because I didn't have any but the flavor was still good.  I like things SPICY so I added more of a kick to it with ground red cayenne pepper and and more crushed red pepper.

I won't have to buy seasoning packets for tacos ever again!  Thanks!

YUM. I will never go back to storebought packages of taco seasoning again, with all their extra preservatives and all those additives...

Didn't do the pepper flakes or my kids won't eat it. And I didn't have dried onion so I just added onion (and garlic) browned with the ground beef.

I had a hard time finding taco seasoning that didn't taste like heartburn like all the store packets I have used in the past. When I first made this one I was very skeptical. However, I loved it! The flavor is authentic and not too strong. My family loved it so much that I have been asked to make tacos for graduation parties and we now have a huge family taco night twice a month. The recipe makes enough to feed a extra large group or keep to have on hand for later.

I followed the reviews and reduced the salt by half.  It was perfect.

Pretty good as a standby for when I'm out of the packaged mix, but I think we still like the store-bought better.

Yeah, I love this recipe as it is a way to make gluten and dairy free tacos for my son!.  Tasted great but next time I'll use less salt and more spice.

Very good.  No more packs of taco seasoning will be bought by me.  My husband and 2 children loved it too.  I did cut back on the salt since I used beef bouillon, which is salty.  Maybe that is why some are saying it is too salty.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Perhaps the original recipe calls for 3 tsp of salt, rather than 3 tbs. The amount of cumin can be reduced to half as well. I use masa flour instead of cornstarch. Also, gotta use Mexican oregano.

I tried this tonight.  I think that it needs MORE spice, and my 6 yr old agreed.  It was good, at first but lost flavor, which I thought was really weird.  I will keep this and adjust it.

I halved the recipe and eliminated the cornstarch.  I did not use the meat mixture because I used the mix on the Salsa Chicken recipe from this site.  This had good flavor and won't buy pre made mix from the store anymore!

This is a great recipe!  For the people who said it was too salty, it is because you are only supposed to use TWO TABLESPOONS of the entire mix per pound of beef!  I can't imagine one pound of beef being able to feed 24 people.

First time we ever had tacos at home and this worked out great :)
We left out the '2 teaspoons beef bouillon granules' because we didn't have any at home, still tasted great! Thanks!

Since I am trying to cut as much salt out of my diet as possible, this recipe came in very handy... and it tastes great on fajitas too!

I made a batch of this and we have used it a few times now.  They're not the best tacos we've ever had, but they are quite tasty and much healthier and less expensve than most storebought prepackaged mixes.  Thank you!

The Salt was way way to salty.  I had to through this out!  After my son tried a taste, his face turned red, he drank some milk, and the milk came out of his nose.  Normally, I find good recipes on this site.

This is an excellent mix and is very affordable. I however, chose to leave out the dried onions, dried garlic, the beef granules, and the salt. The beef granules tend to have MSG or additional salt and really doesn't change the taste. I did not find it too bland at all and liked using fresh onion and garlic, could also add green peppers for more flavor. I also left out the salt to reduce the amount of sodium and didn't miss it.
