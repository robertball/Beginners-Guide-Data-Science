Fantastic Soup!  I serve this in my coffeehouse and get nothing but rave reviews from my customers!  I dump all of the ingredients in a crock pot in the morning, turn it to medium and it's ready by lunch.  The only thing I do differently is to whisk about 1 1/2 cups flour into the chicken broth.  This gives it a little thicker consistency. I also use dried onions instead of fresh and a large can of chicken (saves alot of time!).  Try it, it will be one of your favorites!

OMG!!!!!   I can't say enough about this recipe.  Every time I make it I get rave reviews and many requests for the recipe.  I buy a rotisserie chicken from Costco, remove chicken in place of breasts) then boil the carcass along with the skin (to add additional flavor) then strain and use as the broth.  I also use a couple cans of Rotel tomatoes with chiles in place of the salsa.

You have to try this recipe.  You will not regret it.

WOW I was disapointed. Not what I was looking for. I have been trying to find a recipe like the soup I get in resturants but this wasnt it. It was like corn chowder with chicken and spices. Very watery and a unappealing pinky color.

This was not what I wanted.   It was bland and tasteless.  I had to add a ton of hot sauce to give it some spice at all.  My 2 year old wouldn't eat it even before I added the hot sauce.  My husband took one look and opted for a sandwich.  I suppose I could adjust the spices, but really based on the fat content I don't think it is worth it.  I will try a different recipe next time.

This soup was great! I doubled it, and used the meat from 2 whole chickens instead, and made my own broth.  Adding tabasco gives it a good kick. Next time I think I'll saute some red peppers with the onions. If there are leftovers (if...) reduce the sauce, add some more chicken, and use as filling for enchiladas. add sauce and cheese on top. these were the best enchiladas i've ever tasted!!

This was very flavorful and yummy! I used 2C. half & half and 2C. skim milk and it was still very creamy. Like other reveiwers I also put some of the cheese directly in the soup. Next time I may add black beans.

Delicious recipe! I diced and cooked the chicken breasts with the onion mixture to save time. I pre-mixed 2 tbsp of cornstarch with the broth as a thickener instead of using flour. I substituted fat-free half and half and used only 2 cups. I also substituted a can of rotel for the salsa as suggested by another reviewer. I don't like creamed corn, so I used frozen corn instead. I garnished with the cheese, cilantro, sour cream, chips and diced avocado. Served with warmed, buttered flour tortillas. Yummy! Thank you for the recipe!

Really good and easy. I confess that I was beginning to wonder as I combined the various ingredients (the creamed corn made me especially nervous), but it turned out to taste like what I'd expect from my favorite Mexican restaurant. My husband raved about it! Definitely a keeper!

Mmmmmmmmmmm This soup is sooooo good! I'm so glad I stuck some in the freezer because I can't wait to eat it again! I used fat-free: broth, condensed soup and half-and-half and it turned out great, really cuts the calories down! I left out the cilantro & onion because my fresh salsa contained both and they're not my favorites. I'm a real wimp when it comes to spicy foods, and was so happy that this soup is full of wonderful flavor - but not HOT at all. Don't be afraid to try this! If you like spicy it's easy to adjust using a hotter salsa. I also recommend the Portuagese Fried Bread on this web-site to go with this soup.

I knew 2 things just from reading the recipe--  too much fat and not spicy enough for us, we love things kickin.  This soup was so good with just a few mods for those who like things spicy and not quite so heavy.
1- Use 2% milk
2- Sautee onions and garlic in 1/2 TBPS olive oil instead of butter
3- Whisk in 1 TBSP flour to milk and broth before adding soup
4- INSTEAD of SALSA add 1/2 can HOT enchilada sauce
5- Add one diced jalapeno with the seeds and 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes for extra kick.

I don't know what is normally in fajita mix- I make my own and it's what I used for this
2 TBSP chili powder
1 TBSP cumin
1 tsp oregano
3/4 tsp salt
1/2 tsp garlic powder

This was sooo good.  I think we will serve it for a football game this fall instead of chili!

I've made this several times for dinners with friends and it's a hit every time.  The consistency can be a bit thin so it's a good idea to have cornstarch on hand just in case.

My family loved this soup!  Definitely a keeper.  Chopped the chicken really fine which made the soup creamy.  Will try serving with lime wedges next time and it will be just like the soup in the restaurants!

This is a good basic tortilla soup recipe. I made a few changes that made it pretty flavorful. I added two packets of sazon, an additional can of regular corn, an entire large jar of salsa (about 2 1/4 cups). I halved the amount of half-and-half. And instead of dumping in the fajita seasoning, I used the seasoning plus 1 TB olive oil, 1 TB soy sauce, 1/2 TB Liquid smoke, and 2 teaspoons lime juice as a marinade for the chicken for an hour or so. And I cooked the chicken, the onion, and the garlic with the marinade before adding it the soup.

Very delicious! This was a HIT at our family gathering of 16 people. From the oldest to the youngest they all LOVED it! My sons were very vocal with the praises :) Made a few substitutions because of what I had on hand and added a can of black beans. I used a whole chicken instead of the breasts and taco seasoning instead of fahita seasoning. I also eliminated the cream of chicken soup. The picture does not do this soup justice-it is much more visually appealing. I garnished with red pepper strips and sour cream.

I used only 2 cups of milk and one can of chicken broth and ALOT of flour and this was still very thin, although it did have a good flavor. If you are looking for a thin tortilla soup, this is it, however if you would like a thick tortilla soup (like I was), let me make a few suggestions. Use three cans red enchilada sauce, one can cream of chicken, 1 onion, one can chicken broth, and 1 - 2 cups milk. When you sprinkle the cheese on top it will be much thicker. Hope this helps.

I thought this recipe was great!  I took it to share with my extended family on Christmas eve & they all loved it!  I did make a few changes:  I added an extra can of corn, a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles, a bit chili powder and a bit of cayenne pepper.  I also cooked the chicken on the BBQ.  Definitely will be making it again.  Thanks!

This is my husbands favorite soup!  He can't get enough of it.  It is also a crowd pleaser.  Just about everyone I make it for loves it.  The only thing I have to keep in mind is that some people don't like cilantro.  I just leave the cilantro out or put it on the side if someone doesn't like it.  Fantastic soup!!

We loved this!  I did not a few ingredients--so I created my own.  Instead of salsa I used Ro-Tel tomoatoes (with lime and cilantro) 2 cans and a can of green chiles.  I also didn't have fajita seasoning mix so I added salt, pepper, cumen, chile pepper, and red pepper flakes to taste.  I also didn't have cilantro  (other than what was in the Ro-Tel) so I added corriander to taste.  I used cream of celery instead of cream of chicken.  I also used a whole rotisserie chicken (skin and bones removed) rather than the chicken breasts.  I guess the listed recipe was a jumping off point, but the end result was awesome--will certainly try to duplicate it again.

I won a tortilla soup contest with this recipe!  I used medium salsa and fresh red pepper - chopped.  Also I switched the cream of chicken soup with cream of poblano pepper and used a fresh roasted chicken - cubed instead of chicken breast.

Sorry, But I am from Texas and ALL the chicken tortilla soups I have ever encountered have a clear broth base. Just because it has tortillas as a garnish does not make it a tortilla soup..

This recipe rocks!  There is nothing bland about this soup and we eat it by the truckloads in our house and every time I've served it for guests they are clamoring for the recipe!  I say, Make it and You Be the Judge!  ;)

Fabulous!  I was looking for a copy of soup I had tried in a restaurant and this was about as close as I could ask for.  I made it exactly, except used low-fat 1/2 & 1/2 and couldn't tell a difference.  I noticed some people complained about the amount of corn so at first I only added a 1/2 can but couldn't notice it so I added the rest and it was delicious.  Not overloaded with corn at all like I was expecting.  Can't wait to try the leftovers today since soup usually tastes better the second day.  Oh yeah, also, I used store-bought salsa instead of homemade and it was very good.  The store brand I use has  a heavy tomato base.

I've been making this soup for awhile now and it is by far our FAVORITE soup!
I do use Rotel instead of salsa and regular corn instead of creamed.  I put the cheese right into the big pot which makes it thicker right away and sometimes I even thicken it with a little cornstarch.  It was exactly what I was looking for after I had eaten a similar version in a favorite restaurant. Thanks!

WOW! We loved this soup!! My husband and I ate leftovers for two days! It even tasted better re-heated. I followed the recipe almost exactly but did make a few additions. I added green pepper to the onion/garlic mixture (and I nearly doubled the garlic because it cooks down so much!) I used Pace Picante salsa instead of fresh salsa, reduced sodium cream of chicken soup, and butter instead of margarine (because I don't like margarine). I also added fresh diced tomatoes to the finished product and WA-LA! A PERFECT tortilla soup!

Absoluely delicious!I thickned my soup up with a corn starch slurry  (two tablespoons cornstarch mixed with one cup of the hot soup. Wisk together until well blended and then add to soup again and mix) I also added extra seasonings and spiced it up quite a bit. Will make again and again and again!!!!!!

This is very good!  I didn't have salsa so  I used some drained diced tomatoes.  Turned out great.  Also, I started this on the stove, but then moved it to the crock pot and put on low unitl dinner.

I would not put as much cilantro as they called for in this recipe. Also, it is much better with about a tablespoon of lime juice and a little bit of hot sauce.

My family absolutely loved this soup! Going off some of the reviews, I used 6 tbls butter to saute the onions and the garlic and 6 tbls flour to make the soup creamier (just a matter of personal preference), and also used a 15 oz can of tomatoes with green chiles in place of the salsa. In addition, I added a 7 oz can of green chiles. Not sure why there were so many complaints about the color, we did not find it to be the least bit un-appetizing! In fact, my 10 year old son was already making plans to reserve some for his lunch the next day! My 16 year old daughter is a bit pickier, and typically not a fan of soup, but she thought that it was very good also! Thank you, Julie, for a very good recipe to add to our recipe box. We will have this again!

Very good soup!  I used 3 chicken breasts and 2 cans of black beans.  I also used sour cream for half of the half and half and added a can of chiles.  Yum!

This soup was good but difficult to rate. The base recipe was great, but I found that there was no need for the roux which would have just added more fat and calories to an otherwise healthy meal. I used fat free half and half but only a cup as any more would have turned my soup white. The amount I used added just the right amount of creaminess and the extra vegies I added left the soup thick and hearty. My family enjoyed this Julie and thanks!

I doubled the recipe and believe me it made a lot of soup. It was very good. I used half 2% milk and 1/2 of the 1/2 and 1/2. It came out perfect. I did scorch the milk on the bottom of the pan a little so be careful not to bring it to a boil too fast. We enjoyed this soup for days! Pefect for cooler weather. I think if I had used all 1/2 and 1/2 it would have been too thick for my liking especially after adding the cheese to each bowl. Yummy...thanks for sharing this recipe :-)

Excellent.  My whole family found something that we all love equally.(Which is rare, as my kids and husband are very picky.)  I did as suggested by adding half milk and half half and half.  I also used stock from the chicken that I cooked for it.  About 4 cups to thin it.  And 3 cups of home cooked black beans.  I also just used the tortillas and cheese as a topping.And just half a large jar of salsa since I don't have any fresh made.  And we still have plenty left over.  My 11 year old son said it is now his favorite food.  And he never likes vegetables.  Thank you so much.  Meal times will be so much better now.(At least when I make this.) :)

Since this was a five star recipe, I thought it would be delcious. I was wrong. I was nauseated. The half-and-half was too heavy, and it lacked the taste of traditional tortilla soups. Not enough spice.

This was awesome.  My family loved it.  I used a whole chicken from the local grocery store that was already seasoned and cooked.  The flavor was awesome.  I will tell all my friends about this recipe.  A++++++

easy and quick meal to prepare.  Using a qt. of half and half made it a little to heavy for me. Next time I will substitue the half and half with evaporated milk.

Excellent and VERY filling recipe! A hit with the whole family, with very few modifications (1 can of corn is not enough! Diced tomatoes and diced avacado really add to presentation and taste!). Thank you for sharing this online!

Awesome!  My husband LOVES Mexican... and this was a hit.  He doesn't like cilantro though - but you could easily change that out with green onion, fresh parsley or chives.  The only thing I did to change it was to add a little velveeta (4-6 oz) and I put in almost 2 cups of salsa vs the 1 the recipe calls for.  A HUGE hit.  :)

Good soup!  I added a can of black beans (rinsed them first) and half a can of Rotel tomatoes. (Could have used the whole can and still wouldn't have been too spicy). On top we had yummy low fat sour cream and slices of avocado.  We used fat free half and half, reduced fat Cream of Chicken, and canned chicken breast.  Delicious!  I am sure we will take this to a potluck in the future! Thanks!

I know that I am going against the grain, as this is a 5 star recipe but I thought that it was terrible.  The color alone ( a light pinky color because of the salsa & half&half) was enough to make it unappetizing to me and my family.  The flavors were lacking, I will never make this again.

Had a satisfying taste to it yet a few changes gave it a needed kick. Like others, I halved the amount of half n half and put just a cup of 2% milk in. I added a can of black beans and a can of Rotel (diced tomatoes and grn. peppers). I also added a tbl. of corn starch to give it a more stew-like consistency. To save some time, I used a rotisserie cooked chicken from the store- delicious!

Yum!  As good as this recipe tasted in my reduced-fat version, I can't even imagine it prepared as-written! I used fat-free half-and-half (even as ridiculous as that sounds), reduced-fat cream of chicken soup, and low-fat sour cream to garnish.  I prepared the salsa myself (onion, tomato, g. pepper, lime juice, cilantro, g. onion) and used canned chicken, although next time I'd use fresh.  DeeeeeLISHus!  Thanks for submitting it.  I'll definitely use it to impress the next time we have company!

This was very tasty!  To reduce the calories I used skim milk instead of half and half, Healthy Request Cream of Chicken soup, and I used left over smoked turkey breast instead of chicken.  I also cooked it over night in my slow cooker and it turned out great!  I definately recommend this soup!

This was a awesome recipe!  A couple changes I made was I boiled a whole chicken to get the chicken meat and chicken broth and instead of salsa I used a fresh made pico de gallo.  Me and my wife loved the soup and gave it 5 stars and would recommend it to anyone!  Thanks for the recipe.

This is THE BEST!  I have made it twice and each time to rave reviews.  I did make a few changes to save time - I used 1 cup frozen chopped onions, 1 1/2 tsp. prepared minced garlic, 1 pkg. pre-cooked fajita chicken strips, 1 1/2 tsp. cumin.  I used frozen cream corn (the whole package of 1 lb. 4 oz) and I added the 8 oz. of cheese to the soup.  I did not have cilantro so I omitted it.  Note:  Do not put lid on pot while simmering or cooling.

My husband and I love this soup!  I doubled the salsa because I like the flavor it gives and I like the extra chunks.  Plus I add a can of whole kernal corn.  I add slightly less chicken broth and leave out the cilantro altogether.  Plus I add cheese right to the pot. Mmmmmmmmm...  Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

I had a hankering for some tortilla soup like the one I order last week at Z'Tejas Southwestern Grill, and this recipe was even better than theirs! It's rich and creamy, has a robust flavor, and is very easy to make. My husband and picky 2 year old ate it up like nothing else. I'm sharing this recipe with everyone I love.

This recipe has become part of our family football tradition. Following the recipe will make a thick great tasting soup that EVERYONE loves. I have been recently adding grilled corn with garlic and onion at the beginning. (With more margarine) Also grilling the chicken adds a different flavor. Only problem, never any leftovers!

This soup is to die for. Everyone who tried it raved about it. I did find that the recipe as written seemed a little too thick and creamy to me so I used only 2 cups milk instead of 4 cups half and half as well as frozen corn instead of cream of corn. Family and friends all couldn't get enough. Will definitely be making again soon!

THIS is just toooo YUMMY for the TUMMY! This soup is just spicy enough for the whole family to agree on. I love this soup in the summer especially,but we eat it in every season. Use lots of Mexi-cheese on the top of your bowl..."Ayy Carrumba Miss Julie - You GO GIRL!"

My family really enjoyed this soup!  I did make some changes to the recipe, however.  Instead of margarine I used olive oil.  I cut the chicken broth to 2 cans and the half and half to 2 cups.  I only used 3 chicken breasts.  I also added 1-2 cups of chopped carrots and sauted these with the onions.

In the winter-time we make this almost every week! Its a comfort food in our house. Instead of half-and-half, I substituted skim milk and it still turned out great!

We have been making this recipe for a few years now and we LOVE it. We use fat free half/half and you can not tell the difference (it was an accident the first time!) I just had to comment that this soup does not come out purple like my computer is showing the picture to be lol!

if you are looking for a low fat food..move on, if you are looking for a crowd pleaser listen up! I have been cooking this soup for years.  The only difference is I either use a leftover carcass and boil the meat off the bones or a rotisserie chicken and pull the meat off and put in a plastic bag with the fajita seasoning...Start everything on the stove as stated, also add extra cumin, salsa and cilatro and have an EXTRA fajita seasoning packet in case the chicken sucks it all up in the beginning. Once you have all the ingridients in throw it in the crock for a couple hours on high or 4 hours on low...FANTASTIC!! Never forget the cheese and chips at the end! PS, don't let this one boil EVER! you will lose the flavor!

My friend gave me this recipe at work today, and said how good it was.  My whole family loved it, and I used up my leftover turkey.  Perfect!  I was afraid to try it at first because the picture makes the soup look grey...the boys won't eat things that don't 'look right,' however mine came out more like the second photo posted, creamy, and cheesey in color.  Thanks!

Awesome.  Can play around with it to make it healthier - you don't really need the cream of chic soup.  Use flour to thicken the soup instead if you need to.

Hmmm...  I have mixed feelings about this recipe.  On the one hand, I did enjoy the finished product, but I did make changes and will make more.  Normally, that doesn't cause me to give a lower rating to a recipe, but without these changes, this soup was bland and not very appetizing to me.
Next time I make it (and there will probably be a next time), I will substitute sour cream for some of the half and half.  I will definitely cut back on the cumin and add a couple of chopped jalapenos to the onion and garlic.  I'll add hot sauce, more garlic, a splash of lime juice.  When I made this recipe exactly as stated, the finished product was a little sweet and bland for my taste. With the addition of more spices, hot sauce, and some lemon juice it was much better.  I'll also replace the fajita seasoning with taco or enchilada seasoning -- the fajita seasoning gave it an odd sweet and smoky flavor.  Some people would really love this the way it is, some wouldn't.  All in all, I think it's a good recipe that can be reworked to suit anyone's individual taste.

The best mexican soup I have ever had!!! This recipe makes a lot.  For us it made probably at least 12 servings--it would be 8 very large servings.  It was excellent and it freezed well--I still have some in our freezer. Thanks!

Very easy, and very tasty.  My husband is very picky about tortilla soup and he loved this.  I fried my  thinly sliced corn torillas in veggie oil instead of using store bought chips.

This soup is great!   I've made it several times and everyone I've served it to says it's great too.  Like others, I add a can of black beans too -gives me a couple more servings per recipe.

Our family loves this soup.  It is a great creamy type of tortilla soup.  I use a little more salsa than is called for, and sometimes add some extra canned tomatoes as well.  Otherwise I make it as listed and it works great.  I have made the soup to take to an event before, and in that case I just added the cheese directly to the soup and melted it, rather than put it on each bowl and it worked great too.

I have made this soup a number of times now, and it gets better each time I do! I do add jalapenos, more cumin, and most of the time less half and half. It's a fantastic recipe, and I have shared it more times than I can remember. People looking for a traditional tortilla soup with a tomato base should avoid this recipe. As for a filling, soul warming soup on a cold winter evening, this can't be beat!

Thank you so much for a recipe that I have used many times, and will continue to use for many years to come!

Sad to say this recipe was a big disappointment. Strange texture, unappetizing color and I have quarts of it left over. I will continue my search for the wonderful chicken tortilla soup I've had in restaurants - this was not it.

This has a great flavor!  Makes a lot, so be prepared for leftovers, but this recipe is so versatile, that I used the chicken for quesadillas the next day, and rolled in corn tortillas for chicken enchiladas the day after that.  The kids loved it, and as a parent, there is no better review than your kids saying, "...I like this chicken mama..."  I also used 2 cups of milk and 2 cups of half and half, I also used an entire jar of salsa (about 17 ozs).  This will become a staple in my household!  Five stars-good stuff.

YUMMY!  I could feel myself getting fatter with every bite but it was worth it.  I served with crushed tortilla chips on top, a dollop of sour cream and sliced avocado.  I used a can of rotel in the soup too along with the salsa to give it a little more kick.  Would make it again and again and again :)

This recipe was easy to make and yielded a delicious, warming soup.  I added a can of RoTel to give it a little more kick.  I think next time I would also use a cup less of the half and half.  It was very milky before I tweaked it a little as it was cooking, but overall a great recipe!

Excellent Recipe!! I made a few changes to it, I added a can of corn and a can of black beans. This seemed to make it stretch farther, and added substance. Everyone loved the soup and I'll for sure make it again!! :)

Everyone loved this soup.  It was amazing.  The combination of flavors was delicious.  I used 2 cups of fat free half and half and 2 cups 2% milk and reduced fat soup.  I only had half a package of taco seasoning in the cupboard so I used that. I crushed some bite size tortilla chips in the bottom of the bowl before serving up the soup.  Mmm...

great soup!  I increased the amount of salsa for a bit more tomato flavor and made my own chicken stock which cut back on the salt.

Very delicious!  When my husband first saw the soup, he thought what has she made.  He tasted it and now it is one of his favorite dishes.

I have searched for a simple chicken tortilla soup recipe for a long time.  This one was awesome, the only thing I did different was more corn, no tortilla chips and I added sour cream.  I have the leftovers frozen and go to it when needed!

This recipe was simple and good.  It is difficult for me to get my husband to try anything new but when he came into the house he told me how great dinner smelled and he looked forward to trying it.  After dinner he said that it tasted as good as it smelled.  I will be making this recipe again.  Thanks!

This was okay.. I doubled the recipe to feed quite a few people.  Some liked it.. others thought (like myself) it was too rich.  Guess I just prefer a more "chicken stock" base to my tortilla soups.  Overall.. it was okay tho.

We loved this soup!  What a delightful way to end a long, wintery day at work! I did make a few changes though.  One ingredient that I did not have was chicken!  Not a big deal at all!!  I added some lime and garlic salsa from Walmart/Sam's Club, a dash of chili powder, only 1/2 cup of half and half, taco seasoning instead of fajita, and cheddar cheese.  YUM!

This soup recipe was so excellent! It is now a family favorite, and I've sent dozens here for the recipe. I substituted frozen corn for creamed corn, and I ommited the cream of chicken soup, as I make a broth from scratch from leftover turkey carcass. FABULOSO!!! Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!!

Excellent Recipe!! I added roasted green chiles and 1 can Rotel Mexican tomatoes (instead of salsa) and it turned out great! I also put guacamole on top of each bowl. Along with the cheese and tortilla chips, it was super yummy. Will make again and again!

This recipe is wonderful!  Everyone loved it.  Like others, I boiled a whole chicken and also used the homemade chicken broth. I cooked the soup at a slow simmer for nearly two hours which brought out the robust flavors and thickened the soup a bit.  Perfect for a chilly winter evening!

Outstanding recipe!  I doubled the portions and it made a huge pot with plenty of tasty leftovers.  Only changes I made were to add a couple of cans of diced green chilies, additional cilantro and a cup of cheese while it was cooking.
You can't beat the creamy taste and complex flavor.  It was delicious down to the bottom of the bowl.  Highly recommend this to anyone looking to impress~

Great recipe!  LOVED IT!  May I suggest - using olive oil instead of the margarine to saute the onion and garlic (better kind of fat) also, I substituted 1 percent milk for half of the half and half.  Next time I may just try regular 1 percent milk.  Instead of the fajita seasoning packet I used my own mix of chipolte seasoning mix which contains chipolte's cumin, and other spices.  IT Was fantastic.  I also used baked tostitos for the chips.

Made this soup about a month ago for dinner guests. I'm still getting calls for the recipe. I did make a few changes. I boiled a hen and deboned and chopped the meat to add to the soup. I used 6 cups of broth from that instead of the 3 cans of broth. I cut the amount of half & half to 2 cups. Added a can of whole corn along with the creamed corn and mixed the cheese up in the pot of soup. This makes a huge pot of soup and is delicious! Next time I will use less cilantro in the soup itself. It has a very strong taste and not one of my favorite spices.

This soup is not at all what I expect with a Tortilla Soup. It's much more like a corn chowder. I didn't care for it at all. Sorry.

This tasted just like McAllister's "Chicken Tortilla Soup", but even better!! We are watching our fat, so I used skim milk...happened to have some leftover Rotel cheese dip, which I added to make it a little thicker.  I announced that I would be making this once a week during the cold months!! (ha~they are all stick-in-the-muds, didn't think that was funny.)  Thanks so much for sharing the recipe Julie!

I LOVED IT!!! MY KIDS LOVED IT!!! MY NEIGHBOR LOVED IT!!!  My neighbor said it is the BEST recipe I have EVER made!
....I soaked the chicken the night before in itailan dressing, put it on the indoor grill for a few minutes, baked it covered with foil till no pink then put it in the soup.  I added only half of the half and half and regular corn instead of cream corn.  It came out perfect...Thanks for sharing!!

this is GREAT tortilla soup! Next time i will try it with shredded tortillas instead of tortilla chips. I added avocado and a dollop of sour cream to the top of each bowl. We froze the left overs in a zip-lock and it was just as tasty the seccond time around! Thanks! We'll be making this one again!

Excellent :)
Made it last night for my husband and I and we loved it!  I used 1/2 of the cilantro it called for because I used the dried flakes from the spice aisle.  The only thing I would do different is add a drained can of corn next time, the creamstyle was good but I love corn in tortilla soup and thought it needed a bit more.
Was really good with a side salad and rolls.

This recipe was OK, nothing spectacular.  I would make it again.  The only thing I did differently was use fat free half and half.  The flavor was good and the whole family ate it.  They didn't rush back for seconds.  It was OK.

This soup was absolutely wonderful.  I reduced the 1/2 & 1/2 by one cup & increased the broth by one cup.  I also used fresh broth, not canned which to me always makes a difference.  This soup is so easy to make and it is something you could whip up easily after work.  It's restaurant quality...just like Max & Erma's.  

Good Job Julie!

Excellent!  I used low sodium, fat free chicken broth and fat free half and half to lighten the recipe and couldn't tell the difference.  It has a great spicy yet sweet taste.  I did add some lime juice and tobasco sauce and skipped the cumin because I was out.  Definitely a keeper!

WONDERFUL - so much flavor!  I accidentaly doubled the chicken broth so to thicken it up, I added a can of Cheddar Cheese Soup - it was so thick and creamy! Threw in some taco seasoning and white rice, as well - YUM!

Yummy!! I suggest using hot salsa sauce just to give it more of a kick.  This soup was a hit at my house.

I made this soup last year for "Girl's Soup Night", and made it over and over again.  Recently I found that I had misplaced the recipe (maybe it was just worn out)so came back here to get it again.  I substituted bean with bacon soup for the cream of chicken.  Everyone I have served this to has asked for the recipe!

This recipe was good although I was reluctant to add 1/2 & 1/2 to a Mexican soup.  For that spicy kick that it needed I added a small can of "EL PATO" (spicy tomato sauce) it's in the Mexican food section in the grocery store.

My boys, ages 9, 12, & 15 loved this! I doubled the batch and froze single servings in zip lock bags (yes the milk base freezes very well). In a seperate bag taped to each I put a serving of chips and cheese. My kids will pull a bag out of the freezer and eat this soup as an after school snack instead of cookies! I will make it often.

This was fantastic!  I used only 3 chicken breasts (added in raw cubes with the broth), only 1 cup half and half, 1/2 t. cumin, 1 T. cilantro (not my fav) and added 4 oz. shredded cheddar IN the soup.  Truly wonderful.  This will be what I make when I have to bring a meal to a new mom or someone who is sick.  I served it with cornbread.

This soup was ok, but not very spicy.  My husband and I like spice so I added a teaspoon of cayenne pepper and used HOT homemade salsa.  I also added a dollop of sour cream to the top of each bowl to make things a little more flavorful.  After my additions, it was perfect.

A good base recipe. I used skinless chicken thighs which I browned in olive oil, then added the onions and garlic. To cut fat and calories a bit, used fat free half n half. Still a rich flavor and creaminess. Added some chili powder and paprika to enhance the spice factor.Can't wait to eat tomorrow as I think the flavors will develop even more.

I used a homemade salsa with habanero peppers. Never used jarred salas- disgusting. Also added 2 tsp of cayenne. The soup is watery at first, however, once you add the chips and cheese, it thickens right up. Amazing recipe!

I like to stir a bit of cheese into mine to thicken it up because I like it that way, but this recipe is AMAZING as written! It also freezes very well. I made it and put it in the deep freezer. Four months later, it was even better than it was when I first made it. This is one I’ve made more than once. Some recipes are a one-and-done okay kind of recipes, but this one is a put-it-in-the-Family-recipe-book kind of recipe. Delicious and thank you!

Good, but way too much liquid or just double chicken (I used a rotisserie chicken) needed more flour to thicken also.
Play with flavor to suit.

To the negative reviews about this recipe regarding flavor.... try tasting your food before you serve it. I added an orange bell pepper, a taco seasoning pack, a jalapeno, and the real kicker was using a can of habanero rotel instead of salsa.I of course added two beers to the liquid. Cooking wise I reduced all the sauteed garlic and veggies for a good 1 hour before moving on with the recipe. It was awesome!

Instead of the can of soup, I added an additional tablespoon of flour. Figured the soup added thickening.  I also added a tsp of cayenne. I topped with fresh avocado as well.

Easy to make.  Skipped the 4 cups half and half and used 1% milk but only 2cups as I wanted a thicker product.  No complaints from the family.  Will add to monthly rotation.

This was fabulous; liked by all. Used light cream instead of 1/2 & 1/2 (what I had on hand). Definitely being added to the family recipe book, and will be made many times again.

This soup recipe is a keeper.  I did make some changes after reading others reviews about it being bland and thin.  I added about 1/3 cup of corn starch to the 1/2 & 1/2 and chicken broth before bringing to a boil.  I used a packet of taco seasoning because that's what I had on hand, but also added a full recipe of  taco seasoning that I found on this site.  (Taco Seasoning I) Added a dash of chipotle tabasco for flavor.  This all added a lot of flavor without too much  heat.  In addition to cream corn, I added about a cup of corn.  I also added two cans of  southwestern flavored white beans.  I put in about 1 cup of monterey jack in with the soup.   I omitted the can of cream of chicken. soup.  Thick, creamy and DELICIOUS!

This soup has great flavor but GOODNESS it’s heavy. So much cream goes into this soup, heavy cream, cream corn, cream can soup. So beware this soup is not for everyone.

I had a lot of left over BBQ chicken so I cut it in little chunks and made this soup and my husband loved it.  I really like the grilled taste to the chicken.  I have another non creamy version I make but my husband likes this one better.  Thank you for this recipe it’s a keeper.

I made this with 1 can of red enchilada sauce (8oz.) and no cream of corn but just frozen corn (1cup).  Also added green chili /tomato mixture. Loved the flavors and texture too. Thanks!

I used 2 cans of Rotel instead of the salsa. I also used 2 pkg of fajita seasonings.

Rule of thumb my aunt taught me:
Red over white and they don't fight.  Have your white base hot and cooking before pouring into the red so the white doesn't curdle. 

Great recipe! Yummy

Was easy to make. Quick and turned out delicious. Added some avocado and lime to it when serving and that added some good balance. Awesome!

Made this the other day and it was great. I never follow quantities from a recipe and this was no different. I went heavier on broth and lighter on the cream. I lightened up on the flour a bit too much and it ended up a little too thin - easy adjustment for next time. Omitted the cream corn and added black beans. Also used Rotel instead of salsa. Garnished with more cilantro and fresh jalapeño. Flavor was perfect up and down. Highly recommended, but dare to adjust to your liking.

I made this last night for dinner and it has become one of my family's favorite meals! I didn't have any fajita seasoning so I used 1 Tbs of Chili Powder instead and the flavor was amazing. I highly recommend this recipe!

I used 6 grilled chicken breasts from Whataburger.  Then, instead of fajita mix, I used Taco Seasoning mix. Also, instead of 3 cups 1/2 & 1/2, I used 2 c. Heavy Cream, plus 1 c. Water. I’m on the Keto Diet, and this helped me keep track of the macros.  Delicious!!!

This was actually better than I expected while I was making it. I didn't change anything from the recipe aside from straining the salsa before adding as it was think enough. My husband commented it had really good flavors!

I really loved this recipe. I made a few changes after reading some comments of it being too thin/watery. I also made mine in the crockpot for convince. In order to reduce liquid I changed the amount of chicken stock to 32oz and the amount of half and half to 2 cups. I added a small can of diced green chiles. I also omitted the creamed corn - I am just not a fan of corn. Place all of the ingredients in the crockpot except the half and half. Cook on low for 5-6hrs then remove the chicken breasts and shred them. Return chicken to the crockpot. Whisk 1/2 cup of flour into the half and half and add to crockpot. Turn heat up to high and let thicken for 1/2 hour.

ADD BEANS!
Added 1 can black beans and 2 cans kidney beans, otherwise tasted very bland and the only veggie was a can of corn... add the beans and it's awesome.

I made this exactly as the recipe stated and it is delicious! I use my family as guinea pigs when I try a new recipe, and they were all hovering around in the kitchen when it was time to eat since it made the house smell so good. I was also nervous about the creamed corn (ick), but found there was no need to be. The only thing different I did was use boneless, skinless chicken breasts. I rubbed them down with sea salt & pepper, drizzled w/olive oil, popped them in the oven at 350 for 30 mins and bingo, chicken was done. Then stuck in the fridge overnight and made the soup the next day to save a tiny bit of time - this one is definitely a keeper and already in my recipe box!

This a bit bland as written. I added a tablespoon of Knorr Chicken Flavor Bouillon, 2 tablespoons of chili powder, a teaspoon of salt, and a half cup of masa harina flour mixed with half a cup of water to add texture and thicken it a little bit more.

This was a very tex mex authentic recipe!! I had mixed reviews from family but we've made many many times in past couple months! We did however exclude the cream of whatever soup. It wasn't necessary. And cut the chicken down to 2 large breasts. We also prepared in a crock pot which made the chicken pull apart yummy!!! I shredded chicken into soup before serving. I also served over oven toasted tortilla strips which made for a delightful texture. Very good. Will be a staple in my kitchen arsenal. Thanks!!

Will DEFINITELY add this to my soup rotation. Delicious and not lacking in flavor like some have commented. LOVE how quickly this comes together, too. Thanks for the great recipe. **Update (mostly for myself:) Use 5 Mission thin tortillas, diced in lieu of butter/flour. Cream of Chicken Mushroom also OK to use.

My husband ate Ramen noodles instead. I finished my bowl, but did not go back for seconds. I will not be making this recipe. If you insist on making it I would cut back on the broth and half and half the soup was not thick at all.

Usually make tortilla soup from scratch but was in a hurry so I combined this recipe with the pre-packaged dried soup mix. I sautéed onions and garlic and added the flour, then the broth, milk and condensed soup. I added extra broth and then added the soup mix, black beans, canned corn, deli roasted chicken and extra cumin, garlic powder, chili powder and hot sauce. After about 30 minutes on medium heat, I added fresh chopped cilantro and some Mexican shredded cheese. Served it with tortilla chips, sour cream and cheese. Delicious! My family really enjoyed the creaminess of this soup as compared to the more broth-like soup I usually make. Next time, I'll add shrimp too.

Absolutely delicious!!!  My husband said it was restaurant quality and my son said it was better than Chik-Fil-a.  I did add corn and black beans, along with two cans of tomatoes with lime and chilies.  Loved the hint of lime!  Definitely a keeper, thank you for sharing!!

I've been wanting to make this soup for a while and tonight was the night! I used tenderloins instead of breasts, they cooked faster and were easier to dice up in the soup.  I also only put 1 1/2 tablespoons instead of 3 of cilantro as we aren't big cilantro fans.  I made fresh salsa instead of canned, and also added avocado as garnish. DELICIOUS! My family devoured it, and we've got leftovers for days. the recipe says 8 servings, but we fed 4 grown people and still have probably 2/3rds of the soup left. I might cut back on the recipe next time if the leftovers don't get eaten.

Thought the recipe sounded good, and it exceeded my expectations. Used canned chicken breast because I was in a hurry (2 cans). Used a pint of half and half and then 2 cups of chicken stock.  Used rotel instead of salsa.  Sautéed the onion in olive oil and didn't use any butter or flour.  Forgot the corn.  Followed the rest of the recipe to a T.  Wonderful flavor!  It was a nice thickness.  The friend who stopped by and smelled it cooking stayed for dinner and had 3 bowls.  Definitely will make again.

I LOVE ordering chicken tortilla soup in restaurants and finally broke down and made it.  It tasted just like restaurant quality.  I did double the amount of flour that it called for to make it slightly thicker.    I will definitely be making this again.

LOVED this...couldn't get enough of it. My SO and sister were very pleased with the results!  My revisions were: I did not add the corn as I'm not a big fan,  I used 70 ounces of water with chicken bouillon (didn't use canned broth), and only used 2 cups of half 'n' half. Added 4 ounces of the Sargento Tastings Fiesta Jack (cut up into pieces) to add a kick and creaminess, and added a 14.5 oz can of black beans (undrained).  I used dried cilantro leaves. And did NOT add any as garnish as the recipe calls for. Also, I made my own condensed cream of chicken soup (as I didn't have any on hand)--2 tbsp of butter, 3 tbsp of flour, chicken bouillon, 1/2 c. milk (1% is fine) and 1/2 c. of water), salt & pepper to taste,  simmer on med-low until thick. In the end, I crushed some tortilla chips over the soup at the end. No need to add any shredded cheese or sour cream.  All I know, is that this specific mix of ingredients made for an amazing soup and the household had it again for lunch the next day, and again for dinner the following night.  This will be a "go-to" recipe for me and my family!

I loved this soup and disagree it was bland....But I did cut up a jalapeño and used a can of rotel with chiles. I topped my bowl off with sour cream. I'll definitely make this again!

this recipe is very good and one of our family's favourites. However it is way too high in sodium. I've altered the recipe to reduce this and the fat and find that it still tastes just as good. Here's what I substituted:  low sodium chicken broth for the regular broth, evaporated milk instead of half-and-half and eliminated the fajita seasoning mix packet altogether (major culprit for high sodium) and replaced with 2 tsp cumin, 2 tsp chili powder, 1 tsp paprika, 1/2 to 1 tsp salt (to taste)  and 1 tsp black pepper

So good!  I used turkey because that's what I had to use up, left out the cilantro (otherwise my hubs wouldn't touch it), skipped the cream of chicken soup, and used frozen corn.  I'll be making this again.

Recipe needs a little more description (list the actual prep time, refining amounts, describing how to cut the chicken in fajita strips, etc).Used heavy cream & whole milk instead of half&half and also dded Jack cheese to the soup as it reduced to make it thicker.  Dollop of sour cream, full leaf cilantro, and tri-color strips as garnish helps with the restaurant presentation.

I really liked this soup.  I did make a couple of changes.  I used 2 cans of chicken broth instead of 3 to thicken it up.  I added cheese directly to the soup as well as sprinkle on top at serving.  Also, I added chili powder and hot sauce to add some heat.  Everyone enjoyed it.

This is restaurant style soup. Everyone loved it. I did make the changes of using canned diced tomatoes instead of salsa. The first time I did it I cooked the chicken with the onion at first and it came out great. Loved it!

Really great recipe. Good like it is but I typically change a few things...try subbing Campbell's Nacho Cheese Soup for the cream of chicken soup. I also add  chili powder for a little more spice.

This does taste similar to McAlister's Chicken Tortilla Soup.  It seems like it's asking for a little too much liquid though...maybe 1.5 or 2 cups less of broth/half-and-half would be better?  I used hot salsa, and it gave it the right kick.  I didn't even add cheese, and it came out pretty darn good.  Will make again for chilly nights.

Great soup! Very easy to make! I used a rotisserie chicken, thanks to some of the other reviews. I also cut the recipe in 1/2. Turned out great but a little on the salty side. Next time I will use the reduced sodium versions of the chicken broth and cream of chicken soup.  instead.

This is why I love this site- I can touch up a recipe based on others' comments! I followed the recipe pretty close, but I shredded a premade rotisserie chicken, used 2 cups half n half and 2 cups milk, and added 1/2 cup frozen corn. It was great, no problem with seasoning, plenty hearty and made a full pot- way more than 8 servings!

Probably the best soup recipe I have - and on heavy rotation at my house! I sub my own taco seasoning for the fajita seasoning and use 2 cups half and half, 2 cups milk.  Every time I've made it, I get raves and requests for the recipe.

This soup was good. It's really creamy. I used store-bought salsa and I'm afraid it was a little too spicy for my 3 yr. old. It would have been better with my  husband's homemade salsa. We'll have to try that next time.

This soup was very good.  I sprinkled a little fajita seasoning on the chicken before I cooked it.  I think the fajita seasoning I used already had cumin in it, so next time I will leave out the extra cumin.  The cumin taste was a little too strong for me.

Great recipe.  I used what I had on hand. Canned chicken, 2% milk.  I just added a bit more flour in the beginning to thicken the soup.  Served over crushed tortillia chips with grated cheese and a dolop of sour cream!  Yum

Very rich, excellent tasting soup.  I did take a liberty with this recipe, I substituted 2 cans of great northern beans for the creamed corn so that my family would eat it.

Yum, yum, yum!!!  Those looking to cut the fat... I used 98% reduced fat cream of chicken soup and low-fat half and half and it was so good - this one is definitely going into the rotation!!

While preparing this soup I was skeptical because it seemed so thin. But once it was finished and we added the chips and cheese it was very good. We like spicier foods, so next time I will add jalepenos.

I was looking for a recipe to duplicate the Chicken Tortilla soup I first tasted in a restaurant and this is it!! It is fabulous! I have passed it on to many friends and family who are now enjoying it too. There is nothing better on a cold winter's night!! Thanks.

I have made other versions of chicken tortilla soup from this website.  This recipe is by far the best!  Even my children ate it-which is a rare happening.  My husband, who is Mexican-American liked it even better than the tortilla soup his mother makes.

This soup was awesome! I quadrupled it for a large group and everyone was asking for the recipe.  I subsituted fat free half-and-half and fat free soup to reduce the fat and calories and it tasted great.

Yummy soup!!  Followed recipe exactly except only used 2 c. half and half after reading other reviews that soup was a bit thin.  Not quite spicy enough for husband but a little cayenne pepper took care of that.  Will make again but not often due to high calorie count.

I've had tortilla soup many times in many different restaurants, including in Mexico, so I tried making this one, and it was better than any I've ever had!  The only change I'd make would be to add avocado.  But this soup is yummy yummy yummy.

This recipe was very easy and great tasting.  My boyfriend who is pretty picky about things actually loved it.  I did not put any cilantro in the pot just in my bowl because he doesn't like the flavor.  I did fry up my own corn tortilla strips in my fryer and I thought it was a lot better than buying a bag of chips.  Other than that, I did not make any other modifications.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

yeap, this was very good and I will make it again.  How can you go wrong with half and half and chicken.  It was just soooooo fating it is almost not worth it.  I think next time I make it I will use milk and fat free cream of chiken soup. and then maybe I can have more then 1/2 a cup.  But I will make it again it was very good.

Awesome!  I added some chopped avocado.  It was fabulous and made great leftovers.  Thanks so much for this -- it's almost as good as the tortilla soup at La Chopa Loca in Cozumel, Mexico!!!

I made a "lighter" version & it was fabulous! Here's what I did differently:

minced garlic from a jar, much easier
large box of low sodium chicken broth
2% milk instead of half-and-half
light cream of chicken soup
low sodium taco instead of fajita seasoning
didn't put chips in the bottom of the bowl (it seems like they would get too soggy)

And as with other soups, it was even better reheated!

This soup was great.  My father who doesn't like soup went back for seconds.  The only thing I will change is to thicken up the soup a little and add more corn.  I also served with the chips on the side and some sour cream.  The serving size seems off, it made way more than eight servings.  I will definitely make this again.

My family liked this one.  I doubled the recipe and used 2% milk for half of it to cut some fat.  I also thickened it and used the broth I boiled the chicken breasts in with some added chicken bouillon.  This was a good "try one time" recipe.

This is an awesome recipe.  To save time I browned the chicken in the butter, onion, and garlic.  Because I used milk I increased the amount of butter and flour slightly (5 tbsp margarine instead of 3) to make up for the thickness of the cream.    I used cream of mushroom soup because I had no chicken, and skipped the cilantro (had none).  I added a little more salsa than called for as well.  
I usually like my soups a little thicker, but once I had it in a bowl with all the crackers and cheese, I didn't miss the thickness at all.  It was a very very good soup.  I'd recommend this to anyone!

This is really delicious and quite easy to prepare.  It's very rich and makes a meal in itself served with a salad.  My husband practically licked his bowl he liked it so much!
The only drawbacks for me were the high price of all the ingredients (especially here in Japan where many of them can only be found at specialty import food shops) and the high fat content, which will make this soup a rare but treasured treat.

This is fantastic soup!  I like a thicker broth, so I add extra flour or cornstarch, and I also add more creamed corn.  A GREAT recipe for dinner parties!

This recipe was pretty good but I wasn't too sure about the half-and-half.  I decided to try it anyway.  I think I prefer a tomato-base and will try it without next time.

Very good but I would probably add a couple things.  First of all, instead of cooking the chicken beforehand, I cut up raw chicken, added it during the boiling part and it cooked in the soup.  I added about 3 chicken breasts to cut back on cost.  The soup is only good w/the chips and it tastes much better the second day.  Chips need to be added right before eating or they are too soggy.  Next time I would add two cans of corn and maybe a can of black or red beans.

This is an excellent soup recipe, I will definetely make again!  I used milk instead of half and half, whch made the soup a bit thin, but I didn't mind it too much and will do that again.  

One thing that I also did that REALLY added to the dish, was I cut up white corn tortillas in really thin strips and fried them myself.  It was easy and was lightyears better than regular corn chips.  I also served with homemade cornbread with honeybutter.

Loved it! Very quick as far as soups go. Not long until a hot bowl of soup!My husband and I both enjoyed this. I took the advice of some others and added cheese directly to the soup. We then dished it out, broke chips over the top, and sprinkled on some more cheese. The chips got too soggy too quickly on the bottom. Not very good for you - next time I'll try subbing milk for at least some of the half and half. But, very good!

This soup is positively to die for!  Once I taste tested it, I had to have a bowl.  I couldn't even wait for dinner!  I used Pace picante sauce, frozen corn as well as the cream corn, and omitted the cilantro because I don't care for it.  Eveything else was done by the recipe.  This one is a keeper!  Thanks a lot, Julie!

This is way good!  I made it for the first time.....mixed up some of the steps, and it turned out awesome.  Just so ya know, the soup itself looks pretty runny (at least mine did) but when you put it in with the chips and cheese you really wouldn't want it any thicker.......I sub. nonfat milk for half and half, used cheddar & mozz cheese, and forgot the chicken! (How in the world did I do that!) But it was great!

This was a great recipe - and made a nice amount of soup, too.  I shared this with my Mom, Dad, and niece and still had some left over.  Of course, I did take others advice and used a whole chicken to make my broth and for the meat.  This was a very comforting soup for a cold day - everyone loved it!

Nice job! To this I added cooked rice and I prefer my soup a little thicker so I mixed 2Tbsp cornstarch with 2 Tbsp Water and blended it into the soup. Also I used dark meat and by doing that makes this a very economical dish. Topped it with crushed chips, cheese and sliced advacadoes.  YUM!!!

This is a great recipe.  I do havc to agree with one of the other reviewers on the high cost of the ingredients.  It cost me $25.00 to make this soup.  I used a rotisserie chicken so that made it a little more expensive as well.  I will definately make this again as it is very delicious.  I also added a can of kernel corn as well as the creamed corn.  GREAT RECIPE

Even the picky eaters in my family loved this soup.  Being in Texas and having kids that don't like "spice", I was worried they wouldn't care for it and I'd end up making sandwiches too but I was wrong.  Thanks for the great recipe

After reading some posts, I tried adding roasted chili peppers, but still felt the soup needed more depth.  Next time I make this, I'll probably use a hot taco seasoning packet for more kick.  I'm surprised no one has mentioned the high cost of the ingredients.  I made it less expensive by using a whole chicken and boiling it for the meat and broth.

Really, really,really, really good!  Really easy to make, and flavor is superb!  I didn't change much except only used two cups of half and half and scaled it down to 2/3 but added the whole fajita packet and added a can of diced jalapenos for extra kick and extra garlic.  Served with jalapeno cheese focaccia bread and put a dollop of sour cream on each bowl along with the other called for condiments before serving.  Thanks!

This was an excellent soup. The flavor is wonderful and I love having the tortilla chips with cheese both on the top and on the bottom. In addition, the smell is great! If you enjoy Mexican food, then this soup is for you.

I make this one a lot, it has become a family favorite.  Very rich and creamy.  Not for the calorie watchers :( Then again, most foods worth eating, aren't.  :)

I really enjoyed this recipe. It is a rich, creamy soup. I fried fresh corn tortillas for chips and made sure I added cilantro to each bowl of soup. My husband and daughter thought it was ok, but were not jumping up and down. I froze the rest and will see if it really does freeze well, later. 
THANKS FOR THE RECIPE!

This was very easy to make and had a great taste.  I boiled and shreaded the chicken.  I also added frozen corn instead of creamed corn, and a can of diced tomatoes.  Everyone wanted a copy of this recipe.

This recipe tastes excellent and is easy.  My husband and I made this soup today.  It is the perfect compliment to autumn in the Mid-West.  I spiced it up a bit by adding 1 cup of pepper jack cheese and hot salsa to the soup while cooking.  We will definately make this again soon.

I used 3 tablespoons of taco seasoning and 3 cups of skim milk instead of the half and half.  It was really, really good.  I also made some homemade salsa instead of storebought, but I'm sure the storebought would have been good too.

I served this with salad and rolls and it was a big hit!  Filling, satisfying soup that looks really nice--very creamy.  Instead of the margarine, I sauted my onion/garlic in 1 tbs.butter and some olive oil and turned out fine.  Omitted the cilantro (my salsa had it already) and added 1 can whole kernel corn (thanks to previous posts).  I am already planning to make this next weekend for dinner guests. Delicious!

This is such a great soup recipe!!  Everyone who has tried this, friends as well as family, loves it.   I added whole corn on top of the creamed corn to bulk it up more, but other than that...I wouldn't change a thing.  A real crowd pleaser.

My family and friends love this soup. Perfect texture and spice for a family of 6. We have children ranging from a nursing baby to a picky 10 year old.. This is a pleaser for all! Today I'm going to use the left over with some velveta cheese to make Nacho's. Wish me luck.

I use Fat-Free Half & Half instead of the real thing to cut down on fat, and it's delicious.  Lime-flavored tortillas are great for an extra kick.  This soup has become a family favorite.

This recipe is delicious!!  I ommited 1 cup of the half and half and next time I will use hot salsa because it was a bit mild for us using the medium salsa.

Made this soup last night and it was a big hit. I cut back on fat and calories by using as much fat free ingredients as possible (broth, soup, half&half, tortillas, cheese.  Used 2 cans of drained corn instead of the creamed corn, and added about 1 cup of cheese directly to the soup. Will definitely make again!

Thankyou Julie, My husband and teenager are very hard to please and I rarely get to put anything new in my recipe box.  Well, this soup is a hit!!!  I'm so excited to get such a tasty recipe. Very flavorful. I added 1 can of black beans, 1 cup of canned corn, use sour cream instead of cheese, and add all the cilantro to the soup pot. Thanks again!!!

First you need to know I am not a fan of mexican food,I was asked to bring a dish to a party with a "Mexican Theme"  so I made this soup recipe. I thought it was ok but others thought it was good; therefore I have given it four stars!

This is a great receipe to make after Thanksgiving, because I use my left over turkey and I use the broth from my turkey bones.  Also, if you like a little extra kick, I use extra salsa and about 1/4 to 1/2 cup of hot sauce.  This receipe is worth the effort.

This had a good taste, but mine was a bit thick for my likeing, I think next time I will put more half/half in so it will be more like soup instead of dip!

This is AWESOME.  I love mexican food, and this was terrific.  I didn't even follow the directions all the way.  I put in 1/4 less half and half and didn't have any cumin or cilantro, plus no fajita mix, I used taco.  I have give some to friends and they loved it also.  This will go on my "Fav" list for sure.

This will become a favorite!  I've been looking for a chicken tortilla soup recipe for a long time and I believe my search is over.  I gave this a first-time try while having company and everyone commented several times how wonderful it was.  Even my daughter, who is only 3, loved it!

Wow!!! If there was a 10 star rating this would get it!! I was totally impressed with this recipe and so was my DH! He loved it...even said it was RESTURANT QUALITY which is a big compliment since he goes out to eat constantly with his job! I had alot leftover so I called a friend of mine who's husband is out of town and told her to stop by after work to eat dinner here...and she was SO impressed and loved it! She had never had tortilla soup before and couldn't believe how tasty it was!! The flavor was great, the recipe was super easy and we all loved it! Thanks Julie!

This soup was so good and very easy!  I have tried two other tortilla soup recipies from this website, and this one is THE BEST!  The only thing I did differently was to add a can of black beans.  This one is a keeper.

This was easy and so good. I cut the half and half down a lot and it still tasted great! I added some 2% milk in it's place.

It was terrific!  I added more spices to make it hotter and only put in 11/2 cups of the half and half.  It was an instant hit with the family!

My husband said it was the best soup he's ever eaten. I really enjoyed it, but thought it need some kick, more spices etc.

This soup is restaurant quality and makes for great leftovers.  It is easy to make variations to and you can make it as hot or mild as you want.

My husband made this soup for a dinner party and everyone was praising us on how good it was.  Thank you.  It had a great flavor and just the right spices.
