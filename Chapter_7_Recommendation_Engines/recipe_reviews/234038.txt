Loved these... I got 10 biscuits. Popped the bag in the freezer for dinners. Defrosted one tonight.. just as yummy. Make the entire batch when you make them... they froze well

This recipe is spot on! Just like my mom (from Nova Scotia) makes! I made this recipe twice, using lard as in the instructions, and the second time with butter as a replacement for the lard. You can lower the lard/butter amount to 1/4 cup if you want to save a few calories. You can also be a bit more generous with the shredded cheese, if you like.

If you want something quick and extremely easy on a cold morning, this is the ticket. Very quick to make with no baking experience required. Appearance, taste and texture were very good. One suggestion, do not attempt this recipe unless you are willing to make them often! Everyone from my wife to my 6 year old daughter loved them.
Thank You Allie K :)

It was very good and easy and went well with a nice cup of tea. Next time though, I think I'll add more cheese. But that's just because I love cheese

So delicious! Instead of chives (I ran out), I used Club House La Grille Maple Bacon spice, it made them a tad more Canadian too mmmm! Thanks for the recipe!

So simple and good! I wanted to use chives but didn't have any so I used about 1/2 teas onion powder with the flour. I chose to use butter. It was just me and my immediate family so I dropped them straight from the bowl on a cookie sheet and baked as directed. They came out so tender and toasty on the bottoms. Thank you!

My husband had a fancy for cheese biscuits and made these tonight. He made them smaller to go with dinner and I must say I was very impressed. Very scrumptious! I popped the remaining biscuits in the freezer. He can make these anytime he likes. Thank you hubby.. Very nice!!

Easy and delicious!! I used butter instead of shortening, twice the cheese, (Italian blend) bacon bits and Italian seasoning instead of chives.

I have made these several times and everyone loves them. I have left out the chives each time. (Just don't have them around much.) They make up in almost no time at all. Can't see why anyone would bother with store bought or mixes when this is so simple.

Used: 1/2 cup butter, 1 1/2 cup shredded cheese. Added: 1 tsp b.powder.  Turns out a bit salty, but hubby likes it that way

I had to multiply the recipe, and ended up not feeding the milk. The end product was a bit crumbly but it tasted good.
I will make the recipe again using the original measures, to see how it tastes!!

Added a little more cheese (3/4 cup), and used butter instead of shortening (about a quarter cup). It made a dozen biscuits, which husband and 4 little ones completely devoured in about 5 minutes!
