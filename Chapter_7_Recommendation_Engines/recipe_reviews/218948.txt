This is also wonderful on the grill! I use 2 foil covered bricks. I like to brush w/equal parts grape seed oil and w'shire sauce and lemon mixture when I grill it. The best lesson I learned when cooking chicken was being told presentation side down first!

It was pretty good but it was a lot of work for what I got.

I don't really know how to butterfly a chicken but it still came out great. I didn't have tinfoil or a brick so I sprayed the bottom of a skillet with non-stick spray put it on top of my chicken and stacked cans of beans on it lol. It worked great.

Delicious and pretty and so fast we could hardly believe it! Messy but not as bad as I thought it might be. The boning takes a while but it's sort of interesting!

This is my third time... we love it. Used smoked paprika instead of sage so I can pretend it was grilled over a fire ... haha!
