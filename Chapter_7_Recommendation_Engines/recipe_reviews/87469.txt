This didn't work for us.  We thought the taste was too bland, probably because I didn't use enough basil.  The recipe needs to be more specific about how much (i.e. packed, rough weight).  I might try this sauce again with rice noodles (more basil, sans provolone and butter).  But I would highly recommend a regular pesto if you're making a traditional pasta.

This was very good, but too much garlic.  I used 3 cloves and even THAT was too much.  I'll use only 2 cloves next time.

Fabulous recipe!   I followed the recipe exactly except I had to sub in mozzarella for the provolone.   I measured my Thai basil by loosely packing it into my measuring cup and I think it was the perfect amount.   It had a really nice flavor that worked great with my Thai basil.   When my plant is ready for it's next trimming, I will be making this again.

I used 12 ounces dry spaghetti instead of 16.  Also added some Parmesan cheese.  We liked the garlic amount.  Really good, Thanks .
