This was surprisingly very good! We didn't use blue cheese because we didn't have any. I had some shredded swiss that I used. I also didn't measure out the hot sauce. I used Frank's and just added it until it tasted right. I topped it off with bacon (because bacon is so good!) and it was awesome! I wish we had bought more than one pound of ground beef for this!

I made this for dinner tonight and it was amazing!  The sauce tasted perfect, who knew tomato soup?!  Not only was it delicious, it only took about 20 minutes to make.  I will make this time and time again.

These are ssssooooo good. However, I added more hot sauce than called for. I just kept adding until it tasted like buffalo sauce.

This was a quick fix and I was happy that the ingredients were super easy, I had everything on hand and I'm a college student!They were super easy and it was nice for me and my brother to have a meal together. NO MORE PLAIN BURGERS! ps we added ranch instead of the bleu cheese

I loved the concept, but the sauce was lacking.  We love hot, vinegary Buffalo sauce.  This bland sauce didn't resemble Buffalo sauce at all. We'll take the idea and next time get some bottled Buffalo sauce at the store.

Will make again.  We added more hot sauce and put bacon on our burgers.  Very good.  I don't usually make burgers at home but we like these.  Will try with Turkey next time.

I made this for my family who normally barely tolerates hamburgers.  Everyone loved it.  The most critical actually ate three and practically ignored the french fries.  It was very easy.  I will make this again soon.
