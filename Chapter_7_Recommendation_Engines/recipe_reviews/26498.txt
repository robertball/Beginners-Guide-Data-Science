I have a problem with the cream cheese being lumpy every time I make this.  I finally solved my problem. I microwaved the cream cheese just to barely warm. I cut the sugar back to 1 cup and I didn't add the OJ.  It was very good and not too sugary.

This was great!  Just be forewarned that it makes a LOT of dip; it is also not something you can eat a lot of, so if you are making it for a small get together you might want to halve the recipe!  Overall a hit, tastes just like pumpkin pie filling, great with ginger snaps and graham crackers.

Excellent!  If I made it again, I would substitute 1/2 tsp. ground ginger, nutmeg and/or cloves for the pumpkin pie spice since the dip seemed to have a little too much cinnamon (my pie spice was mostly cinnamon.)  I chilled it for a few hours before I served it in a hollow pumpkin shell and it was a hit!

My little sister put me onto this. It's wonderful. I used whipped cream cheese because I had some on hand that I needed to use up. Since cream cheese is sold by weight, not by volume, I figured it wouldn't make much difference whether it was whipped or not, except that the whipped kind is much easier to stir.

Here's another tip:

Hollow out a small pumpkin and use it to serve the dip in! It will be a bigger hit! Little kids & big kids will love it!

Made if for a Halloween Party on Saturday night.  The adults loved it.  At first, the kids (mostly 6 yr old.) turned their nose up at it until they saw my son eating it, then they had to try it and loved it.  I brought the cream cheese to room tempature and sifted the powdered sugar before adding it. I used a mixer and had no problems with lumping when I added the pumpkin.  Thanks Sue for sharing this wonderful recipe with the rest of us!

Delicious- but don't expect it to be pretty. My cream cheese was as softened as it could be before I commenced to mixing. I beat it to death with my mixer and still there were tiny lumps of cream cheese through out. Oh well. It sure tastes good with ginger snaps and apple slices- or just by the spoonfull!

This was a great recipe!  It is an excellent presentation if you put the dip inside a scooped mini pumpkin.  People are more inclined to try it with such an interesting presentation.  Everyone loved it!

This is wonderful! I took someone's suggestion and served it in a hollowed-out sugar pumpkin. It got rave reviews at an office party and many, many requests for the recipe. Also- a few complained about the "lumps" of the cream cheese. I let it mix in the mixer for about 5 minutes to beat out any lumps-- it was very smooth and creamy!

This is one of my fall "go to's" because it's stuff I usually have on hand and it looks great served in a little hollowed out pumpkin.  I follow the recipe, though I leave out the OJ and add a dash of vanilla extract.  I usually don't have PP Spice, so I'll add double cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg when I'm out to compensate.  I serve w/Granny Smith apple slices, gingersnaps, and Nilla Wafers.  Thanks for a great fall staple!

Excellent!  I read the other reviews regarding the cream cheese lumps.  Here's an idea that worked for me: I softened the cream cheese completely at room temp., and then I microwaved the cream cheese at 50% for 30 seconds.  It was very soft and smooth, (and didn't melt in the microwave or get hot)-- no lumps in the dip.  This is a really great recipe, very simple and very tasty.

Such a great addition to any Fall party! I used 1 cup confectioner's sugar, instead of two, and that was perfect. Added some allspice as well. Make sure to allow the dip to sit in the refrigerator for a few hours prior to serving. It will bring out the flavors significantly. I wasn't in love prior to sticking it in the fridge, but it was so good afterwards! Also, it tastes much better when dipped with something a little savory/salty- such as pretzels. I have a major sweet tooth and even I thought using graham crackers was too sweet. Will be making again for Thanksgiving. Thank you!

Everybody was crowding around this dip, I served it with gingersnaps and oatmeal cookies.  I also scooped out the inside of a small pumpkin and lined it with saranwrap and filled the pumpkin with the dip.  it made a great display and i was quite the popular one!
* just made this for a church event and we found new use for this dip - put it in your coffee with creamer . . .  tastes just like a pumpkin spice latte!!!

Excellent dip!  I took this to a party and everyone raved.  Instead of pumpkin pie spice (which I didn't have), I used 1-1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp ginger, 1/4 tsp cloves and a dash of nutmeg.  I served this in a hollowed out pumpkin with gingersnaps and vanilla wafers.  Yum!

This dip is creamy and delicious.  The only change I made was to add fresh apple cider instead of the oj concentrate, cause that is what I had in the fridge, which was delish.  I had no problems with lumpy cream cheese (like other reviewers) but I let it get completely soft before I began the recipe.  I am making this to take to a Halloween themed dinner next week and plan on cutting back the cinnamon to 1 teaspoon, I thought it was a bit overpowering.  The dippers I am bringing are:  Ginger snaps, Honey Crisp apples, Pretzel Rods, Strawberries, and Graham Crackers.

I needed a quick dessert to take to an office Halloween party.  I decided to try this one based on the reviews.  I'm glad I did!!  On the first taste I heard oohs and ahs, followed by demands for the recipe.  I served it in a small sugar pumpkin (like in the photo) placed in one corner of a plate with the lid propped up on the side, surrounded with Trader Joe's ginger snaps, small vanilla wafers, and apple slices. TIPS:  (1) Let the cream cheese set out to soften.  (2) Beat the cream cheese with BOTH beaters of an electric mixer, and continue beating after the addition of each ingredient.  This produced a smooth, lump-free consistency. (3)  Use FRESH spices. I used a brand-new jar of Pumpkin Pie Spice from Trader Joe's. (4) Make it the day ahead to allow time for the spices to blend -- trust me, I tasted it when I made it but it was even better the next day.

Wow thats a lot of sugar. I only did 1.5 cups of sugar, but I'll probably cut back next time I make it. It tasted great right after it was made. Another review suggested putting it in coffee, I can see why!

Everyone loved this recipe!  I took it to a Halloween party and tried it with homemade gingersnaps.  I served it again as an appetizer on Thanksgiving. I purchased bagels, cut them into discs and buttered them and then sprinkled them with cinnamon and a little sugar then toasted them until they were heated and just slightly crispy. The bowl was emptied out!  Graham cracker sticks work great also for a quick assembly. The toasted bagels remain my favorite combination!

This dip is on the right track, but I felt like it needed some adjusting.  I used only about 1.5 cups of the powdered sugar and felt it could have been tangier and creamier, so I'd probably up the cream cheese next time.  I also felt like there was a grittiness from 2 tbsp of spices, so I'd cut back on that next time too.  Probably just use the pumpkin pie spice and not add the cinnamon.  I just finished dipping an entire apple's worth of apple slices in it and it is addicting!

I thought the cream cheese was going to come through a little more on this. It still was good, but that is why I am only giving it four stars. If I make it again I might adjust the ratio of cream cheese at little.  I think the o.j. really helps cut the sweetness of it. I stirred the leftover into low-fat vanilla ice cream for instant pumpkin-pie ice cream! Yum!

Delicious! I have found a new favorite! I served this with sliced apple, cut up carrot and gingersnaps. I found that chilling the pumpkin dip for 24 hours helped thickened it up a bit. I thought it still might be a little too thin, but everyone at work said it was perfect! I think I will used grated orange zest next time versus orange juice concentrate. Thanks, Sue, for a great recipe!

This was such a big hit with my guests!! I served it with ginger snaps and graham cracker sticks.  I only used 1 1/2 cups of sugar and was very glad I did as it was just sweet enough.  I will be making it again at Christmas.

Made this as a Thanksgiving appetizer a few years ago for my somewhat picky family.  Once I convinced a few people to try "that orange stuff", they ate it all up, and ask for it every year!  Served it with molasses cookies and apple slices.  I normally leave out the OJ, and add the spices "to taste", depending on how old they are.

I had this at supper club, and I made it for a party at my sisters, and for thanksgiving.  Everyone raved about it.  I let the cream cheese come to room temp and sifted the powedered sugar and beat with mixer, no lumps.  Served with wedged apples, pears and ginger snaps.  Easy.

This recipe is wonderful.  It is like eating creamy pumpkin pie.  I had it with apple slices and Teddy Grahams.  I found that the Teddy Grahams were a little too sweet with it but the apples were fantastic.  I made this for a dinner party and everyone raved about it.

I eliminated the frozen OJ, and it was fine.  If you don't have time to soften the cream cheese, use your food processor or blender, it comes out perfectly smooth.  I made it for the kids at a holiday party, but the adults liked it even better!

This was just a downright cool recipe. I accidently didn't put enough sugar in it the first time I made it and put the correct amount in the second time and it made a world of difference! I served it with ginger snaps and vanilla wafers as others had suggested. I have a VERY picky family and almost everyone had said they liked it. Even my husband who doesn't like pumpkin said it was good. I enjoyed it and thought it was a good idea for an appetizer. Will def. make again for a fall/winter get together!

I was THE talk of a holiday potluck!! I served this in a hollowed out pie pumpkin (I lined it with saran wrap). I served it with sliced apples and ginger snaps. I would ask people what they preferred and the apples won! Everyone wanted the recipe- one guy even called his voice mail and had me recite the recipe! Definitely the hit of the night. If you want to stand out- this is the winner!

I love this recipe, I make it everytime I get the chance.  Everyone always asks me for the recipe!  Wonderful with apple slices as well as the ginger snaps (the apples always go first!).  Can make with reduced fat CC and can't tell the difference.

I made this for a fundraiser that my winery is sponsoring and what a hit! I used other's suggestions by cutting the sugar down to 1 cup, subbing 1/4 t vanilla extract for the OJ concentrate, and cutting the cinnamon to 1/4 t. I also microwaved the room temp cheese on 50% power for 1 minute which eliminated the lumpiness. Delicious!

For all the low carbers out there coconut sugar is a great alternative in this recipe. We only used 1 cup and it still tasted great plus it is full of nutrients. My kids eat it with whole grain crackers but I think apples or dehydrated fruit would be good too. I have made this for myself and make parfaits out of it using a homemade granola out of nuts instead of grains and whipped coconut fat from a can for a lowfat alternative. This could easily be turned into a paleo diet by substituting the cream cheese. Who says healthy has to be boring?

I thought it was just okay but my family LOVED it! I have to add that I am not much of a pumpkin fan so that's a bit of bias on my part. We served it with graham crackers on Thanksgiving.

Wow!!! I made this dip for the first time and it was soooo easy:)  I'm planning on taking it work to share with my co-workers.  I made homemade gingersnap cookies and I'll be serving with green apple slices also.  The only thing I changed was I used 1 cup of confectioner's sugar and 1 cup of splenda. I also forgot the orange juice but it turned out great anyway.  I will definitely be making this again over the holiday season

This was amazingly delicious! I made this twice. The first time I forgot to add the spices but it was still delicious. I tried it with cinnamon and sugar graham crackers- I thought the crackers were a little too sweet for the dip. But green apples and bread tasted great with it! The 2nd time, I got the spice but didn't have enough confectioners  sugar and added regular sugar. Since I made the pumpkin puree fresh (it was still warm) I think the regular sugar melted and worked just as well. I brought the 2nd batch to Thanksgiving dinner and that was a great hit as well. This time I brought the apples and ginger snaps. I definitely recommend the green apples. The ginger snaps were again a lil on the sweet side. Everyone was raving about it all night. What a delightful surprise it was :) Thanks for posting this!

I made this for a party and everyone loved it. I didn't have any orange juice concentrate so I used 1 teaspoon of apple cider. It came out perfect.

I have to have at least 3-4 copies of this recipe anytime I serve this dip - and it's a standing request that I bring it to any fall social event! It's great as is, but of course, I made a couple of very slight changes. I've found the cream cheese in the tub blends a lot smoother and quicker than the block. I also use 2 tablespoons of orange marmalade, instead of the juice concentrate. It still gives it a great orange flavor, and I love the additional texture. DO refrigerate overnight to really bring out the flavors!! This dip was MADE for gingersnaps!!

The cream cheese was lumpy and it was too sweet.  I usually love pumpkin dishes, but this didn't work for me.  If I make it again, I would reduce the amount of sugar.

tip: let the cream cheese sit out and soften for 30-45min and it blends easily at medium speed. great recipe! the o.j. is key! and i like to add extra cinnamon.

I only used 1 cup of the powdered sugar.  I didn't have orange juice or pumpkin pie spice on hand.  I used 1 tsp of vanilla, nutmeg, and cinnamon.

I was a hit at work.  I served with red and granny smith apple slices, gingersnaps, and cinnamon graham crackers.  The granny smith apples were the best!

Tastes great and waaaaay easier to make than pumpkin pie!  I've tried both this recipe and the pumpkin fluff dip.  Personally, I prefer this recipe....the cream cheese tastes so good with the pumpkin!  Went well with graham cracker sticks and vanilla wafers.

Had this at Thanksgiving and it was pretty good.  I used fresh pumpkin so the texture was a little strange and I think that scared some people off. Not sure if I'll make it again, but will use canned pumpkin next time.

I found this very easy to make.  I added the orange juice to the cream cheese mixture before I added the powdered sugar.  I didn't have a problem with lumps.  I wasn't too fond of the taste, but my husband liked it.  Everyone was afraid to try it at Thanksgiving dinner.

This is ok if you're a pumpkin lover.  I think it would taste better with more sugar and cream cheese or less pumpkin.  I would add less cinnamon.  I served with gingersnaps and vanilla wafer cookies.

The flavor of this recipe is nice.  The only problem I had was with the cream cheese.  It was hard mixing it into the pumpkin mix.  It came out a little lumpy, even though the cream cheese was softened.  However, the taste was extraordinary.  I will make this again.

This was just ok for me.  It tasted exactly like pumpkin pie filling so I would have rather just made a pumpkin pie.  I feel like that would have been more satisfying.  Plus it's not exactly something you'd serve as a main dessert .

I made this recipe recently for a party and it was a hit! The batter was too lumpy and not well blended when I used a mixer. However, I put it in the blender and it was perfect. Serve chilled with graham crackers.

Super delicious. I would recommend making/getting made from scratch gingersnaps vs. the boxed kind. The softness of the cookie/dip go well together.

Wasn't well received at the party I brought it to.  Most everyone said the seasonings were too strong. I followed the recipe exactly. I think I would omit the cinnamon next time, as that is also a main ingredient of the pumpkin pie spice.

This is a pefect fall dip. People always ask for the recipe. I always add a container of Cool Whip to make it a little fluffier. We like it with windmill cookies.

I wasn't too sure about this recipe BUT I am so glad I made it. I dipped in it with apples, pumpkin bread and gram crackers. VERY VERY GOOD! I had to watch myself and not eat it all by myself. :) I will make again next Thanksgiving for sure!

Delicious.  I am not a huge pumpkin fan.  This is delicious.  Instead of using the pumpkin and spices, I just got a can of Libby's pumpkin pie mix and omitted the spices.  I also used some orange juice instead of concentrate.  It turned out great.     It wasn't too sweet with almost 2c of powedered sugar.  I liked it very much.

Followed recommendations and served it in a pumpkin (lined with a plastic container) and served it with ginger snaps and apple slices.  I think the secret to smooth results is to let the cream cheese go a few minutes in the electric mixer, add the sugar and let it mix for 3-4 more minutes.  Came out very smooth and just the right consistency.  Thank you for this recipe.

What a perfect treat for fall! I did not have frozen OJ concentrate, so i left that part out. I did not have any problems with lumpiness like other reviewers mentioned and here is how I did it. I used a block of cream cheese, and let it sit out until (as directed) it was definitely soft. I used a mixer on low speed to blend with the powdered sugar. Keep mixing on low until it becomes smooth and as long as you add the other ingredients little at a time, you should have no problem.   SIDENOTE, i prefer Spartan brand ginger snaps with this dip. They are a little less spicy and go better than other brands i have tried. I imagine it would be great on cinnamon bagel chips or apples as well! Yum!  I would make again next fall.

I made this but separated the batch into 2, sugar free and "as is". Both turned out great! I got huge raves from the people at the party! They loved the regular version, but still thought the sugar-free was very good as well. Here is what I did. First off, there is a canned pumpkin shortage apparently and I could NOT find it anywhere. I used fresh, real pumpkin by cutting out a 6" x 6" chunk and microwaving it for about 18 minutes until the flesh was nice and soft. (I would've baked it, but I was out of time!) Skined the pumpkin and put it into my blender/food processor with the softened cream cheese and spices. I pureed them all together and separated it into 2 bowls. One bowl I added 1 cup of powdered sugar and the other I added 7 tsp of Stevia. I let them both set up in the fridge for an hour before serving with Big Soft Ginger Cookies (from this site) and granny smith apples. The sugar free recipie was obviously a little bit runny, so next time I think I will add a bit of clear fiber just to thicken it a bit. The rest of my pumpkin I baked @ 350 for 30 minutes before pureeing it and freezing in 2 cup portions. Hope this helps.

I combined this recipe with another, with fairly good results. Used half of the cream cheese, plus 1/4 cup of sour cream, did not use sugar (substituted with a few packets of Splenda). Cooked it in the crockpot for about an hour and a half. Chilled it for about 45 minutes, and then added cinnamon on top (at least 2 teaspoons- I think it needed it). Definitely a fun seasonal recipe!

I made this for a party and served it with vanilla wafers and cinnimon graham crackers.  I forgot to add the orange juice, but it was still great!  It doesn't look too appetizing because of it's color, but boy does it taste good!

Pretty good but sort of tasted like uncooked pie filling. Next time I'd add more cream cheese (or use less pumpkin). I cut back on the sugar and didn't use OJ. But people loved it.

I will agree with the other reviewers on this one. You must be making this for a pumpkin-adoring crowd. My family likes and some love pumpkin pie but they each just had a couple bites and because it's consistency is very saucelike it's an unfamiliar texture vs. flavor, if that makes any sense. It does look beautiful in the carved pumpkin and does tastes better with apples than with ginger snaps (too overbearing) or graham crackers or any other cookie (we tried plenty). The only problem is keeping the apples fresh enough to look good if it is going to be used as a centerpiece or appetizers. The good news is, I took the dip and added 3 eggs, poured into a graham pie crust & baked for about an hour at 325, refrigerated overnight and voila--pumpkin cheesecake that might be more to people's likings. So it didn't go to waste.

Brought this to a Fall themed bridal shower at work. Served in in a sugar pumpkin with saran wrap protecting it from the pumpkin. Everyone raved about it, esp. with the ginger snaps -- I liked it better with apples. There was some left over...I'd probably half the recipe next time. No problems with cream cheese lumps. Did microwave it on 50 for a few seconds, though.

I have been making this for years, and it is ALWAYS a big hit! You may as well bring copies of the recipe with you wherever you take it, because you will be asked for it! I serve it with pumpkin "Quickbread" mini muffins; you can get the mix in the grocery store.

Wonderful recipe! I served with ginger snaps, sliced apples and sliced pears.
Made good use of leftovers - I made blintze leaves and filled with pumpkin mixture and then fried in a little oil until blintze browned.

I just made this for my dinner club and it was a big hit. We liked the apples and the gingersnaps equally--I think that the gingersnaps need to be the homemade variety as the boxed ones tend to be too hard and leave an aftertaste. Honeycrisp apples worked great, too.

I thought this dip was okay, but not great.  It just seemed like a runny pumpkin pie filling with not as much flavor.  I don't think I'll make it again.

Yummy - tastes just like pumpkin pie!  Key is definitely to have cream cheese at room temperature.  I had no problems with lumps.  I didn't think it looked bad either as others had suggested (??).  I served with snickerdoodles (Mr. Sigg's) and Trader Joe's old fashioned cinnamon grahams.  Great dip for fall!

I wanted to make this twice before I rated it just to be sure that my first results were accurate.  They were.  This dip has a good flavor and is really easy to make.  Mine came out smooth but both times it was a little too runny.  Very similar in consistency to pumpkin pie filling as opposed to a dip.  So the 2nd time I added a bit more sugar and the thickness improved.

My only complaint is that the flavor isn't as strong as I'd like it to be.  For my 3rd time I'll try doubling the spices. :-)

I used light cream cheese & cut back the confectioners sugar to 1C.
This is the first time I've done the "I made it" on All Recipes, I usually serve it with Graham crackers (Honey Grahams) & Ginger Snap cookies to dunk in it (•=
SOOO good!!! I LOVE making this....to bring to a party, on football Saturday &/or Sunday ??

This was great tasting and light.  Instead of using a teaspoon of OJ concentrate I grated a teaspoon and a half of orange peel for a really fresh flavor.  Great with apples and vanilla wafers!

This is wonderful.  I added about 1/4 cup of toffee bits which gave it a little texture.  Great with ginger snaps, "Scooby snacks", apples.  A repeat recipe!

Very tasty and and easy to make.  I'm giving it 4 stars since we left out 1/2 cup of sugar.  It was also a little fluffier than I'd hoped - I would have preferred a little thicker.  I served it in a hollowed out pie pumpkin and it looked fantastic.  I also served it with ginger snaps, graham cracker sticks and vanilla wafers.  All a good match for the dip.  Only problem with those three choices is they are all the same color so it was hard to distinguish one from the other.  Took it to a Halloween party and it was a hit.

I have made this but WITHOUT the confectioners sugar and orange juice. It was very rich and soooo delectable!! I served it with graham crackers, mini ginger snaps and nilla wafers. The ginger snaps were THE BEST. I will definitely be making it again.

We loved this.  I will admit to save a trip to the store, I did alter the recipe slightly.  I made it with a half of a leftover can of pumpkin (used in a nother recipe I had made that morning), 1 1/2 c. sugar and 1/2 t. orange extract.  Very delicious and hard to stay out of!!  Thanks :)

This dip was served at a gathering today and was well received.  Without changing the texture, could the sugar be cut in half?  That was the only question.  No complaints and lots of raves.  Thank you, Sue

This dip is QUICK and super simple to make. I've never had a problem with the cream cheese being lumpy. I do start mixing the cream cheese, by itself, by hand with a spatula. I then slowly add the powdered sugar. The mixture becomes thick, but the pumpkin thins it out. This recipe makes a LOT of dip! We use vanilla wafers and green apples as "dippers". This recipe is always a hit for friends, family and co-workers! I love it!

Yummy and a great way to use up the extra pumpkin lying around after pie making.  Be sure to cream the cream cheese and sugar before adding the other ingredients, or the mixture will come out lumpy.  Beware, this makes a LOT of dip! I ended up handing it out to 3 different families and still having enough for us.

Great recipe, but a bit sweet for our tastes.  Next time I will start with 1 cup powdered sugar and go up from there.  I did use Whey-Low powdered sugar substitute and it measures cup for cup like the real thing.  Great for a sugar free dip!  I did use my immersion blender to get the lumps out and it worked like a charm!!!  Smooth, creamy dip served with gingerbread men...yummy!  The spices were just right for us.

Delicious!  I made this as is and watched people hover around the kitchen as I put it on a platter with ginger snaps, vanilla wafers, apples, and pear slices, asking what it was.  Once they had one taste, they were hooked.  I thought someone was going to lick the pumpkin clean (I put the dip in a hollowed out baking pumpkin) :)

Not as good as I was hoping for. Better after chilling overnight. If I make it again I'll probably double the cream cheese or halve the pumpkin to make it more creamy.

I made this for a party, and it got a lot of compliments.  However, I did adjust the ingredients slightly.  I only added about 1 cup of the sugar.  I also added more cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice than the recipe called for.  I didn't have orange juice concentrate, so I added regular orange juice.  I thought it was really yummy.  I served it with gingersnap cookies.

This dip was wonderful!  Changes I'll make next time: only make 1/2; it goes a long way! Change I made this time: I used leftover butternut squash instead of pumpkin.  Definitely would do so again.

This was good.  Tasted a lot like pumpkin pie filling.  We will be serving it w/ vanilla wafers, but like others said it would be good w/ apples and graham crackers.  I had no problem having the mixture be creamy.  I just defrosted the cr. cheese for a bit and it ended up being a good texture.  Leaving your cr. cheese out all day long would do the trick too!

So addictive!!!!!!!!!!! I only made enough for me so i scaled down the recipe alot.  The only changes i made directly was instead of pumpkin pie spice i used ginger and nutmeg as someone else suggested and low fat cream cheese and fresh squeezed orange juice.  I loved it with my granny smiths! thank you soooooooooooo much!

I made this for a party and it was a hit. I even got rave reviews the next morning from people who thought the pumpkin dip was so good they had to share! I did use brown sugar instead of white and could also see using a natural syrup instead for the sugar intolerant crowds. I served it with toasted apple chips and cinnamon graham crackers. This is a definite crowd pleaser!

This is soooo good. It was gone within minutes. I used the advice from one review and used whipped cream cheese instead and it took about a minute to make. I LOVE this dip.

FYI: This makes an EXCELLENT filling for Stuffed French Toast!!!! I did half the recipe. I used reduced fat cream cheese, Trader Joe's canned pumpkin and SD's homemade pumpkin pie spice.

This was so easy & so yummy!!  Not sure why people said there's was lumpy mine came out super smooth.  I left the cream cheese out for several hours & used a hand mixer.  I'm supposed to be taking this to work but I had to save some of it for myself tonight.  Also I hollowed out a small pumpkin to serve it in.  Thanks for such an easy but delicious recipe!

I thought this was good, but it hardly got touched at the party I took it to.  I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and cut back on the sugar a bit.  I wasn't overly crazy about the texture of this dip and ended up adding some cool whip in it, which I thought was an improvement.

This was yummy.  I did not have any problems with the cream cheese being lumpy.  Before adding anything to the cream cheese, I beat it with my mixer.  Then I slowly added the powered sugar until it became creamy and smooth.  I used reduced fat cream cheese, about 1 1/2 cups powered sugar, and followed the rest of the recipe exactly (except I omitted the OJ - didn't have on hand).

This dip was a big hit at my family Thankksgiving.  They were still talking about it at Christmas.  I used extra cream cheese - almost double what is called for in the recipe.

wow this is good.  i made it with whipped cream cheese (nice suggestion) and i served it with ENDIVE leaves which gave a fresh supporting crunch similar to peanut butter with celery.  i imaging this would be good served with Cinnamon Wheat Thins too, yum!

SO delicious. I was able to impress my boyfriend's parents with this gem :) Just thinking about it makes me hungry! I didn't have any lump problems but I did let the cream cheese sit out for a little while first.

This was good!
I don't like buying for recipes unless I'm going to use all of the ingredients in that batch or will likely use it later, so I didn't buy pumpkin pie spice or orange juice concentrate. I just used cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice for the pumpkin pie spice. I don't know what everyone is talking about...if your cream cheese is lumpy you probably didn't beat it well enough before you added the rest of the ingredients.
Did anyone else find it to be a consistency completely unlike the picture? I was expecting something firmer, mine was liquid, people thought it was soup before I showed them what to do with it. 
This recipe tastes good, is easy to make, and is inexpensive. If this looks like something you would like, try it.

This was great! It does make a lot though. Some people mentioned it being lumpy...I softened my cream cheese pretty well and sifted the confectioners' sugar, and it was super smooth.

I used pumpkin pie mix (sweetened)and cream cheese. I corrected the consistancy with vanilla puding and served it in a hollowed-out pumpkin with gingersnaps and vanilla wafers.  Everyone loved it!  This was quick, easy, and a crowd pleaser.

I thought this was ok... Served it with gingersnaps, vanilla wafers and gingerbread graham crackers (my favorite!). I will make again, but next time I will omit the orange juice and add more cream cheese; the consistency was too runny for my taste. I will also add nutmeg with the spices.

This was really good and easy to make.  I didn't use the orange juice concentrate because I didn't have any - but, I didn't feel like the recipe was missing it.  I also adjusted the spices to our taste - I used less cinnamon & nutmeg and added a little pumpkin pie spice.  It was a perfect compliment to gingersnaps.

I only made half the recipe and it was still too much for one box of Ginger snaps.  And next time I may try Nilla wafers, the spice of the Ginger Snaps is too overpowereing to taste any of the flavor from the dip.

I made this for a party yesterday for the church ladies group.  All the ladies loved it!  My kids love it and my husband loves it.  I printed copies of the recipe before the party b/c I knew people would want it.  I made the recipe as it is written and served it with gingersnaps, honey graham sticks, and apple and pear slices.  Great recipe.  Husband said it tastes just like pumpkin pie filling.

I really wanted to like this.  I think with more cream cheese and orange zest instead of the orange juice it might be better, but as is, I think it tastes like a runny, storebought pumpkin pie.

I'm thinking that you have to REALLY love pumpkin pie to like this.  I made it as directed and although everyone said that they liked it ... after the 1st dip nobody went back for another taste.  I personally thought it tasted like un-cooked pumpkin pie filling.  I won't make it again BUT thanks for the recipe.  BTW - I used the hollowed out pumpkin idea and it looked really nice on the app table.

I love unique recipes like this one...it was a hit! I used 1T. orange marmalade instead of concentrate as that is what I had on hand.

I served this with ginger snaps and vanilla wafers at my daughters birthday party.  It is really good, but very sweet.  Not everyone was crazy about it, but those that were ate a bunch.  I think it is like pumpkin pie; either u like it or u don't.

I accidently used double the cream cheese (I halved the recipe but forgot to halve the cheese), but I thought it was really good.  I almost think the seasonings would be too strong as the recipe is written, I'll have to try it again and see.

I took this to a Christmas party and it got great reviews! 
tips: I used about 1TB or more of orange juice. you could use less of the pie spice & even more cream cheese. it would look really pretty if you swirled cream cheese through the dip before serving...  overall: great!

One of my favorite recipes!  It is delicious and different.  I love to serve it with Teddy grahams and am going to try it with the apple slices and pear slices.  It makes a lot but keeps well.

Very Good!  As others suggested, I hollowed out a pumpkin and served with ginger snaps and apple slices.  I would have liked something else to have dipped into it, but can't put my finger on it.  My guest really did enjoy the different taste of this dip.  I served it while Thanksgiving Dinner was being prepared.  Not too heavy, so it was PERFECT!  Thanks

I didn't have any trouble with lumps in my dip, thanks to all the warnings. However, I didn't care for the texture of this, even though I LOVE pumpkin. The texture was more like a batter, and I was looking for something more like a spread. Next time I might add more powdered sugar.

If you like pumpkin then this is a recipe you should definitely try.  The combination of flavors is perfect for the fall/holiday season and, as mentioned by others, tastes great with either gingersnaps or apple slices.    I will note though that I have been unsuccesful in getting this dip to come out completely smooth and I'm not sure what to attribute this to.  Others have previously run into this problem as well so be warned...........  Your dip may come out seeming a little grainy but the flavor (my reason for the 4 star rating) is so good that if you really like pumpkin the apperance of the dip should not matter.  If anyone ever finds a solution to getting this dip completely smooth EVERY time please post.

This was up at the top of the list with guests this Thanksgiving.  Dip was so easy and absolutely delicious. We also tried it with vanilla wafers, but gingersnaps are the only way to go.  Thanks!

This was delicious and a big hit at a party! I served it with ginger snaps - great complementary flavors. I omitted the orange juice because I didn't have any; and used "allspice" because I had it but did not have pumpkin spice. It was still great!

It turned out just as it was suppose to, but no had seconds of this one.  It tasted just like pumpkin pie, but I think the sweetness and the texture scared people away.  IT is definitly better as a dessert and not an appetizer.

I too found the cream cheese to be lumpy. I tried microwaving to melt it a bit and found the dip to be much better warm. It thins it as well-more like a glaze. Next time I will try using pumpkin pie filling and less icing sugar instead of pure pumpkin.

because i read the other reviews first and had this before, i used 1/2 the cream cheese to avoid the lump (at room temp) and added cool whip, i also used a can of pumpkin pie it has all the spice already in it, i loved it and it was a hit

I made this dip last year for our fall potluck at work and it was a huge hit. I made it again this year for a local cooking contest and won 1st place in the Miscellaneous category.  It's so easy to make and incredibly delicious!

The taste is wonderful!  I bought soft cream cheese and thought I could just cream with the confectioners sugar.  Cannot do.  Have little lumps in dip.  I beat for several minutes but did not help.  Didn't have the pumpkin pie spice so did what others did - increased cinnamon, added dashes of ginger and all spice.  Recipes makes at least 3 cups of dip.

I followed another person's recommendation and used ground ginger, nutmeg and cloves in place of the pumpkin pie spice. Next time I'll use the pumpkin pie spice. There was too much clove for my taste. Wonderful and easy recipe. Still gave it 5 stars because I didn't follow the original recipe.

This came out very runny and way too sweet as the recipe stands.  To tone it down and firm it up I added 1 1/2 cups of ricotta cheese and placed it in the fridge for a few hours.  Along with some Trader Joe’s triple ginger cookie this, it seemed to do the trick!

Recently served this at my daughter's gender reveal party and everyone raved about it.  Have already passed it on to about 10 people.  This is dip is beyond good.  Made it exactly as the recipe called for and it is delicious!!!  Will definitely be making this throughout the fall.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

Followed the directions and read the reveiws about the cream cheese. I made this for my patients as a treat and they said it tasted like pumpkin pie. I wasn't that into the flavor; however, about twenty people enjoyed it and appreciated apples and vanilla wafers to dip in it. I did not have any issues with lumps and the flavor was nice; I did cut back on the sugar to less than a cup as it is very sweet. Nice to take for a function. Thanks.

I made this for a party and it was a huge hit! I added a small dash of nutmeg, cinnamon and allspice. Just a small amount so it wouldn't overpower the canned pumpkin and the pumpkin spice. It was delicious!
I removed the seeds from a small pumpkin and added the dip inside of it like the one pictured, then I surrounded the pumpkin with apples slices, wafers and ginger snaps. Someone ended up taking the whole pumpkin and the dip home! Definitely making this again, and again.

Very tasty and super simple to make. The only modification I made was to substitute 1 Tbsp of Vanilla Extract for the 1Tbsp of frozen oj concentrate (didn't happen to have any at the house at the time I made this), and it came out just fine!

I did not care for this at all. The party guests loved it so much. It was way too much pumpkin. Others loved it, but I will never make it again.

I've made pumpkin dip before, and I was thinking this was the same recipe but it is not.  It was good, just not great.  The texture was a little gummy, but it did go very well on some spicy gingersnaps.  People liked it, but I will try a different pumpkin dip recipe next time.

At the suggestion of other reviewers, I let the cream cheese soften for quite awhile before making this, and I didn't have any issues with lumps. I made this for a Halloween party and it was the clear favorite. The dip was DELICIOUS! It looked amazing served in a cleaned out pumpkin, so if you're serving guests, I recommend this if you want a simple but Pinterest-worthy presentation. Will definitely make this again!

Good, but I made a couple changes because I'd seen other recipes with different proportions of ingredients so I added things gradually. I used half the amount of pumpkin and only 1 tbsp of pumpkin pie spice (no cinnamon). I also added a splash of vanilla. Having read reviews about lumps, I also sifted my confectioner's sugar before adding. Bringing to a party along with graham crackers and ginger snaps. I licked the spoon, yum!

This is a Fall favorite served with Pepperidge Farms Gingermen.  I use only 1 teaspoon of each spice, and about 2 teaspoons of orange juice concentrate which makes it a little brighter flavored.

This was a huge hit for a pot luck I recently attended. I took the previous suggestion and warmed the cream cheese in the microwave for a minute before mixing and it worked well. However, I used an electric mixer instead of mixing with the spoon and the result was a very smooth mixture. I even added a touch of nutmeg and ginger for additional flavor. Great recipe!

I put only 1 cup of sugar and half a can of pumpkin. I also used whipped cream cheese to eliminate lumps problem.  It turned out great. I'll definitely make it again.

I cut back the sugar by about half a cup, skipped the orange juice concentrate, and when using a mixer didn't give me a smooth consistency, I put it through a food processor. It was a huge hit at my NaNoWriMo Kick-Off Party. Also, try it with cinnamon graham crackers in addition to ginger snaps. Delicious!

Not impressed with this recipe.  Almost tasted like straight pumpkin  purée.  I wouldn't recommend this one.  I brought it to an office party and barely anyone ate  it.  I would add vanilla instant jello and cool whip. My two cents.

This is really easy to make and tastes great. If you use graham crackers to dip, it really tastes like each bite is pumpkin pie. Also, this recipe makes a lot of dip, so it is good for a big group.

This dip is simply amazing.  This will be the fourth year to be served at our rather large family celebrations.  Everyone gets one favorite and this is my daughter-in-laws' pick for Thanksgiving AND Christmas.  I present it with Cinnamon Teddy Grahams as well as fresh fruit wedges.  I did however change the OJ to pure vanilla extract.  It is so easy and quick to prepare that I was happy to add this yummy recipe as a family tradition. Thank You and Happy Holidays.

This recipe is tasty, but makes ALOT.  I only made half recipe  to fill a fairly small sugar pumpkin for serving. I still had a lot leftover. Served with ginger snaps and Halloween colored mini vanilla wafers, very festive. It is sort like eating a pumpkin pie! I didn't have pumpkin pie spice, but you can find this spice mix substitution on the internet, which works fine. I would make full recipe only if you're serving a very large crowd.

It's just pumpkin pie in a bowl. Tastes kind of like pumpkin cheesecake. I only gave it 3 stars because it was EXACTLY like pumpkin pie...not much of a dip to me.

My sister makes a similar recipe and was getting ready for a dinner and couldn't reach her to get her recipe.  Used this one, my hubby turned up his nose.  I should have made a double batch, it was gone before the entire crowd arrived and hubby is no longer turning up his nose!  :)  Served with fresh sliced apples and ginger snaps.  Great recipe, quick to make, good for any occasion.

I used regular orange juice instead of concentrate but otherwise followed the recipe. I would have liked it a little thicker. It also makes a TON, so like the other reviewers suggest, half the recipe. I served it at a party with sliced gala apples, celery, ginger snaps, vanilla wafers, pretzels, and graham crackers. It went over well, I just still have a ton of it. I personally thought it was best with the ginger snaps and graham crackers. I was shocked at how fast the celery went!

I only used 1 1/2 cups of confections sugar, it came out perfect. I ended up running out of nilla wafers and just ate it with a spoon. Also I used a pineapple orange juice instead of just orange. It was superb.

This was a big hit at our fall bonfire party this year. I loved the presentation of having the dip in a pumpkin. It also tasted much better with gingersnaps than vanilla wafers. I didn't try it with apples, but I image that would have been very goo too.

It's got a strange taste, however, it's a very good dip. Other reviewers are spot on when they say you can't eat a lot of it. I added just a little bit of extra cinnamon and 1/4 of a cup of extra pumpkin. We ate it with my homemade ginger snaps and granny smith apples. I just made 24 cups of it for Thanksgiving since we have a huge gathering of about 30 people, and I have a feeling it will be more than plenty.

I served this dip last night at a party and it was a huge hit.  Everyone loved it.  I'm glad the recipe makes so much dip, there was enough to go around.  I didn't use Pumpkin Spice because I didn't have any on hand so I added a few shakes of nutmeg instead.  I almost forgot to add the OJ concentrate and I'm glad I didn't - such a nice, subtle flavor twist I didn't expect.

Pretty amazing!  I used nutmeg instead of pumpkin pie spice and it seemed to work well!  If you use Weight Watchers cream cheese, it's only 1 point per table spoon!

I don't do anything relating to cooking or kitchen, but once or twice a year.  So decided on something simple and easy for a Thanksgiving potluck.  The pumpkin dip came out really good, and everyone loved it.  One of the guests even asked me for the recipe for her Christmas dinner party (first time this ever happened).  Thanks for this recipe.

I made this for our Halloween party! It was not visually pleasing at all, even served in a pretty bowl with apples and cookies surrounding it.  I enjoyed it but my husband wouldn't even try it and my guests tried it just to humor me and didn't like it. I don't recommend it!

This was a very unique and festive party treat, and lots of my guests said they liked it, but I wasn't a huge fan.  I love pumpkin pie, pumpkin bars, pumpkin lattes, and pumpkin muffins, but this didn't do it for me.  Thanks for sharing though - it was very easy to make at least!!

Followed the recipe and it turned out amazing. I did like the picture and hollowed out a small pumpkin I was able to fill it twice (a pumpkin about the same size as the picture). This dip went awesoem with the ginger snaps recipe I also got from this website. Thank You!

Yum!  I did half it and it was plenty because it does make quite a bit, considering you pretty much just dip stuff into it.  Very good though.

Excellent!  Made this for company and it was excellent.  I used the wisk beater for my Kitchenaid mixer and gradually added the powdered sugar.  I didn't have any problems with it being lumpy.

This dip is so yummy!   I brought the cream cheese to room temperature and used a blender and didn't have a probelm with it being lumpy.  I skipped the OJ but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I served with apple slices, ginger snaps, and pretzels (for the sweet and salty effect).  At first I didn't know how I felt about the pretzels but then I realized I couldn't stop dipping them so I guess it worked!

I made this without the orange juice concentrate.  It was gobbled up!  I made tortilla strip chips with cinnamon and sugar, to go with it.  Needless to say it did not last long at our house.

I cannot come up with the perfect word to describe how delicious this dip was! I made it for a family event tonight, and it got rave reviews from everyone! I normally dont change recipes, but I did this time only because I thought the dip was a little too thin for my liking. So, I whipped up about a cup of heavy cream, to a very thick whipped topping, added a little more powdered sugar and 1 tsp of vanilla, and folded it into the dip, and it was perfect! I'm not sure if it changed the overall flavor or not (from the original recipe), but I will definitely make it this way from now on. It was so deliciously addicting, it was crazy! My SIL kept telling everyone not to eat it, that it was nasty and gave you the poops...just so that no one else would eat it, and she could have it to herself! LOL! But, it didnt work. Everyone went nuts over it! I have several people that asked for the recipe. It seemed to taste a lot better after the ingredients had time to meld with each other. So, make it at least a few hours ahead and chill in the fridge until served. I will definitely be making this again and again. Thanks for the recipe!

Made this last night and served it today....yum.  I didn't cut back on any of the spices or sugar and it was very tasty.  My cream cheese was very soft and I used a table top mixer on the stir setting for quite some time.  Didn't have any trouble with lumpiness.... Was asked for the recipe by quite a few ladies. :)

Holy Cinnamon, Batman! This was a great recipe, was a hit at my pumpkin carving party, and one of my guest even asked me to make it for his party. Next time I make this I'm going to cut back on the cinnamon. I love cinnamon but there was way too much in this recipe. Once I realized what a tablespoon of cinnamon meant I cut back on the pumpkin spice, I would have hated the outcome if I used all of that too! Also I didn't have any OJ but it didn't seem to affect the outcome of the recipe.  So in a nutshell, great recipe but cut back on the spices and if you want more, you can still add more but you can't take it out.

This is SOOOOOOO good!  I used only one cup powdered sugar and no OJ concentrate.  It tasted delicious and not too sweet.

Yummy! I have made this 2 times in the last month for fall parties, and each time I come home with an empty dish (& requests for the recipe)! I doubled the cinnamon and spice, just as I do when making pumpkin bread/pie because that is how my family likes it. I also make it with 1/3 less fat cream cheese. You'd never know it was missing a bit of fat...tastes delicious!

I got the recipe for pumpkin pie spice on this website...it's much cheaper to make your own.  This is an excellent recipe. I will try whipped cream cheese next time and sift the icing sugar. I did not use orange juice concentrate and it was still good! Get smalll dipping ginger snaps.

I make this every Thanksgiving and it's always a big hit!  We dip ginger-snaps in it, and it's delicous! I stopped serving it in the carved out pumpkin, as it seemed to turn people off from trying it.  Once they try it - they are hooked!

Brought this to a recipe swap and everybody loved it. I only used 1 and 1/2 C powdered sugar because I was too lazy to open another bag and it turned out perfect. Served with apples, vanilla wafers, and graham crackers. An older lady at the swap said "I've tasted a lot of pumpkin dips and this one is by far the best."

i thought this dip was just ok. paired well with apples and gingersnaps, but i thought the spices were a little overpowering. i would make again, but would play with proportions.

This dip is great.  I creamed the cream cheese before adding the pumpkin to take care of the lump problem some have had.  I also omitted the pumpkin pie spice and just used the cinnamon and about a teaspoon of ground ginger.  I will definitely be making this again.

This is a great recipe but definitely on the sweet side. We like to pair it with pretzel crisps for a great combination of salty and sweet. Also I found that kneading the cream cheese in the foil before opening/adding it to the sugar softened it quite a bit and made it easier to mix and elminate chunks.

I'm not sure what I think about this.  It wasn't that huge of a hit at an autumn engagement party I held last evening.  I liked it okay... just it didn't really rock my boat either.  I'm thinking about how proportions might be different to make the consistency a little more firm.  It kind of felt like I was eating uncooked pumpkin pie... which I was.  On the other hand, I did serve this with ginger snaps and graham crackers, and the flavor went very well together.  I might try this again and modify.

I really wanted to like this but I didn't. It was just way too sweet for me. I wanted it to be like pumpkin pie or pumpkin cheesecake but it was just like eating conf. sugar. If I try it again, I will definitely play with the amounts of things.

I halved the sugar and doubled the spices and was happy with the result. Oh I also left out the orange concentrate because I forgot to buy any  The cons of my adjustments: Less powdered sugar made the dip a bit runnier than it would've been. I think adding the orange juice concentrate would have added a valuable tang that was missing.   The pros of my adjustment: Guests didn't die of a sugar overload. And the extra spices really made the dip taste like pumpkin pie filling.

I halved this recipe and it was a perfect amount.  I have half a can of pumpkin waiting in my fridge to make this dip again this weekend!  :o)  I used fat-free cool whip and it turned out just fine.  Granny Smith apples were our favorite--the perfect blend of sweet and tart.

This is the best pumpkin dip!  I did cut back on the spices, used just over a half-tablespoon of cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice!  I serve mine with Nilla Wafers and Gingerbread cookies.

Pretty good, but not for everyone. I will use it again, and next time present it in a pumpkin to make it look more appealing.

Very yummy! I made this for Thanksgiving at a friend's house. Everyone loved it. We dipped Granny Smith Apples and Ginger Snaps. The presentation was beautiful in the hollowed out pumpkin. Thanks for the idea.

This was a wonderful addition to our Thanksgiving Day.  I omitted the OJ- didn't want to get a whole can for such a small amount and it tasted great without it.  I served the dip with honey crisp apples, granny smith apples, and ginger snaps.  It was a hit!

this was an easy recipe to follow, and quick to make. everyone loved the hollowed out pumpkin. it looked a centerpiece at the party i brought it to. i used green apples and vanilla wafers and got a lot of compliments and questions on what was in it. i would agree with the other reviews and get the cream cheese to room temp. first. and another note, make sure the pumpkin you buy isnt too runny, mine was slightly less thick than i wouldve liked, and i think its because the pumpkin i bought was a little watery. awesome party dip!

I just made this to take as an appetizer for Thanksgiving.  I am very disappointed in this recipe.  Like some of the other reviews, I agree that it taste a little like unbaked pumpkin pie and still has the bitter pumpkin taste.  I have had pumpkin dip in the past that I loved.  I believe this recipe would be better by cutting the amount of pumpkin in half and adding a tablespoon of Maple syrup in place of the orange juice.  I’ll try it that way next time.  I’m going to use someone else recommendation and bake this in a graham crust and hope for pumpkin cheesecake.

DELICIOUS!!! I could eat this all day every day :) I skipped the pumpkin pie spice as other users suggested and added a 1/2 tsp cloves, 1/2 tsp vanilla & 1/4 tsp of nutmeg instead.  I didn't have a problem with chunks of the cream cheese because I softened it in the microwave first.  Absolutely LOVE it with the ginger snaps!!!

Very good recipe. I always get asked to share the recipe when I take it to a party. I usually leave out the OJ concentrate,and it is still great! It is also easily made a day or two ahead with good results. I usually serve it with gingersnap cookies and place the dip in a small hallowed out pumpkin.

Such a hit! Naturally being a lover of pumpkins and Halloween, I just had to try this!  I did have to make a few adjustments though, I sent the hubby to the store for packed pumpkin and naturally he bought pumpkin pie mix.... Oh well. I did use this and it still worked great! (so you can omit the spices.) I also added another half of a bar of cream cheese to thicken a little. I served this with gingersnaps and vanilla wafers all nicely displayed in a pumpkin.  NO LEFTOVERS!! The next day I made a batch to take to a birthday party.  Kids love it!

Whoa! This is really spicy, especially when served with ginger snaps. The recipe calls for a LOT of spice, but I liked it. I love cinnamon and pumpkin spice. I made it for a party and everyone loved it. One of my friends was happy to just eat it with a spoon, instead of dipping cookies in it. If you're not into a lot of cinnamon and pumpkin spice, you can always add less. It's a great dip for cookies and maybe even fruit or something (apparently it's also good on its own, as my friend found out). I'll definitely make it again.

I served this to my son's preschool class for his birthday with sliced apples and graham crackers. It was a huge hit. Kids love to dip. This filled 24 small dixie cups about halfway and then I put a squirt of whipped cream on top. I didn't use the pumpkin spice after reading other reviews, I used a teaspoon of nutmeg instead.

This is a yummy dip for pumpkin lovers!  Seems everyone thought it looked like  some sort of peanut butter dip, but were very happy when I said...no it's pumpkin.  It was all gobbled up and I did no "tweaking"  Thanks for the great recipe

Very good but I did change a few things after reading all the reviews.  I used half of: sugar, spices & OJ concentrate.  To me with those changes it was perfect.  I will make this many times I am sure.

I like this one a lot and have had requests for the recipe. I would reccommend putting the dip in a hollowed out pumkin or with a little tag to identify what it is though. I had people pass it up because they thought it was a peanutbutter dip of some sort, or just didn't know what it was. Really yummy though!

I only added some more of the spices and added cardamom. I served it with ginger snaps and a week later a friend said she found this recipe and took it to Thanksgiving. That is saying something.

Wasn't very creamy or sweet, ended up adding another 4 oz cream cheese and another cup powdered sugar, and 1 tsp vanilla, after that it was very good!

I made this for Thanksgiving yesterday and it was a big hit. I even served it in the mini pumpkin - so cute. I served with nilla wafers, graham cracker sticks and apples. Everyone preferred to eat with the apples. It was very yummy.

Yummy!  I just made this  for a pre-Thanksgiving dinner snack and I'm afraid it will rival the pumpkin pie!  Plan to serve it with apples, pears and ginger snaps.  Thanks for sharing!

I don't care for Pumkin Pie, but this was a hit at our house, I had to fight myself to not eat too much of it the night before Thanksgiving!

This is delicious! Made it as a Thanksgiving appetizer a few years ago and it's been asked for every year since!

I had this dip at a party that my MIL hosted.  It was delicious, I had to have the recipe.  She served it with the lightly cinnamon wheat thins which were fantastic.  I love the idea of having it with apples!

My husband and I are hosting our first family Thanksgiving this year and made small batches of things that we wanted to have. I made 1/4 of this recipe and had to make the rest of the batch! We ate it with apple and pear slices! Not too sweet, just perfect!

Got rave reviews at a fall picnic. Buy lots of gingersnap cookies, though. One bag was not enough for our crowd.

I don't care for pumpkin pie, but the texture of this is wonderful!  I let this chill in the fridge for about 24 hours, and the flavors blended together so well.  I can't wait to share this at Thanksgiving.  Everyone who tried it asked for the recipe.  We served it with many options, but the favorite by all were the honey flavored graham flavored sticks.  So easy, and so good!

Pretty good. Way too much dip though, and I even halved the recipe. If I had a party it would be the perfect amount. All in all it was very tasty.

Just OK.  Maybe it's that I don't LOVE pumpkin. We liked it, but it's not that memorable that I'd fix it again.

This dip tastes really good.  I made it for a party and served it with nilla wafers.  The picture shows the dip served in a hollowed out pumpkin, which now I recommend because everyone thought it looked funny and a few people thought it was peanut butter!  But once people tried it they loved it.

Yummy dip!  Not too sweet, not too much spice, just right pumpkin-y-ness.  Made plenty of dip, too.  Served with gingersnaps and granny smith apples.  The kids and hubby gobbled it up.  Will have to share it  at the office, or my family will eat it all!

This was a good recipe.  I liked it best with apples.  I tried Nilla Wafers, but that wasn't as good as apples or ginger snaps.  This was something different--could go for appetizer or dessert.

I love this dip!  Very creamy, not overly sweet & improved with age.  Tasted like my favorite pumpkin pie filling.  Made as the original, but did cut back on the sugar by approx 1/4c (I had originally added 1 1/2c. instead of 2 & it just wasn't quite sweet enough so added another 1/4 c.)  Served with apples & gingersnaps.  Made for a Halloween buffet ~ on the menu again for Thankgiving appetizers.  Highly recommend.

This dip is a yummy treat, but I thought the consistency was a little too thin.  If I make it again, I think I will increase the spices and decrease the pumpkin.  I did not add the OJ concentrate because I already had everything that I needed in my pantry and my fridge, and I didn't want to make a special trip to the store for a tiny bit of frozen OJ.  The dip was still very good.  It is also unique, so if you are going to an "everybody bring something" party, you dont' have to worry about someone else brining it (as opposed to chocolate chip cookies!)  Oh, and I served with Ginger Snaps and with Pepperidge Farm Butter Cookies.

I thought this recipe was great.  I don't know if the consistency was right. Next time I make it I may use a mixer.  Besides that it was yummy. I used graham cracker sticks to dip in it and that was a big hit.I doubled my recipe.  I took some to Thanksgiving, and some to two differant holiday parties around the same weekend.

I had no lumps, it was creamy. However it's look was quite unappealing. It was alright. I served it with ginger snaps but thought they were bit hard.Would be better with a homemade softer cookie.I won't make it again, instead i'll make the frosted pecan bites from this recipe site.Those were delicous!
