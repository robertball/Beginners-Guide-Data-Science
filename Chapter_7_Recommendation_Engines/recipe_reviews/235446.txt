Delicious! I used more of all the veggies than called for (except the onion), so I doubled the cooking water to 2 cups and that worked out great. I used canned oysters, and was very happy with how tender and flavorful they were. The recipe didn't specify when to add the liquid from the oysters, so I just added it when I added the veggie cooking liquid and milk. Season with salt and pepper, and all of the flavors come together beautifully. This is a very tasty, simple soup, that I will be making again and again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

This recipe is fabulous! I'm surprised there are not more reviews / ratings, and it's so good I want to spread the word. I had canned oysters and creamed corn that were expiring and so looked this up in order to use them. I also added carrots, cauliflower and celery, used 2% milk, and used coconut oil and butter for the roux. This is a seriously good recipe that lends itself to modifications, quick and easy. I will be trying with fresh oysters in the future.

This was really delicious.  The only thing I did differently was cook the vegetables in chicken broth and put the oysters (juice too) in the soup at the end and cooked for 10 minutes instead of at the beginning.  Super easy.  My family loved it, especially my husband who loves oyster stew.  Next time I will add more vegetables.

Great flavor a little short on corn and potatoes for my taste. Added shrimp as the container of oysters I had was not the 12 oz size

This is the most flavorful oyster chowder that we have every tasted. I did make some slight changes. I used charred corn that I find at Whole Foods. I also added a parsley garnish that I happened to have in my cold smoker for another recipe. The tinge of smoke flavor and the charred corn made this world class yummy! We will ALWAYS make this chowder forever and ever. Thanks!!!

Amazingly delicious!!! I made it as written and even my 2- and 5-year-olds are it (minus the oysters). The exciting thing about this recipe is that it is a good starting point for other variations (fish chowder, seafood chowder, etc.).

I made this yesterday. Even my 8-year old grandson loved it! I used 1 cup heavy cream and 2 cups milk. Instead of frozen corn I cut fresh corn off the cob. My son suggested next time I should add pieces of cooked bacon. Yum!

Wow!!! What a great recipe. I happened to have carrots and celery so added both in addition to the other veggies. Had to ad an extra cup of water to cook them in, but it worked nicely into the soup! The vegetable water just makes the soup so tasty. This is now our Oyster Chowder Recipe!!!

My first time ever making oyster stew. It took a little longer but I put a little more veggies like cauliflower and more corn. My husband loved it! It was delicious! I’ll definitely be making this oyster stew regularly.

First time making this, it is great. Of course tweaked it a little [I know, I know don't rate it unless you make the recipe as written] Anyway, only things added was clam juice to cook veggies, prawns and bacon. You could use any seafood.

Followed the recipe, and added  some white fish(cod) as my daughter isn't a heavy oyster fan. It turned out amazing! Or as my daughter put it,  "this is the legit thing!"...just like the restaurants! I would make this again.

Very good, could have used a little parsley maybe.
