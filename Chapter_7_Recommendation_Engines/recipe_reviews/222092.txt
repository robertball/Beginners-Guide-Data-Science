Delicious but be aware or portion size.  I made this for a football party and no one even noticed the low fat version as it's so good, but plan on a 9X13 or larger pan for this many ingredients.  I use a regular white corning ware dish and had to half the tomato, green onions, olives and sour cream mixture.  Thanks for this excellent recipe I will make again!

Excellent....followed exactly except I used diced red onion instead of green. Everyone loved this and no one knew they were fat free and low fat options in this dip. Served with multi grain tortilla chips. Thanks!

Absolutely fantastic! The amount was enough for a party and was definitely a croud pleaser. I did not have any green bell peppers or black olives, didn't think it made a difference. No changes otherwise. Will definitely make it again and again.

I will make it again. I switched to romaine lettuce (healthier) and used the taco seasoning recipe on allrecipes, without the fillers and chemicals...much tastier!

This is delicious. And I especially LOVE THE SEAHAWKS BIRD. I am going to make this tomorrow for the SUPER BOWL. I know my family will love it as much as I do. Great job from one SEAHAWKS FAN TO ANOTHER! The only thing I did different was substitute Cream Cheese for the Neufchantel, the store was out, I have the Neufchantel cheese for tomorrow and will use the it for the family munchies...Jilli P

Have made this several times for larger gatherings. Always gets requests for the recipe. I use gluten free taco seasoning and often a can of drained diced tomatoes for the real one just because it is easier...and sometimes better when whole tomatoes are out of season.

So yummy with any kind of chip and I even add extra lettuce to a bowl and spooned some of this over it. So yum! :D

Great recipe thanks! Another idea..You can even cut up some spinach leaves to add to the iceberg lettuce for even more nutritional value with this dish and with all the other tasty flavours, no one even notices or minds!! ;)
