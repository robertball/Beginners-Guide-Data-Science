This stuff is amazing!  I didn't have sage and I only had ground Thyme, so those things were different.  I also couldn't find whole cranberries in the stores yet, so I used Craisins.  I served this on potato rolls and it makes it even more delightful.  My friends enjoyed this as well.  I wasn't sure when to add the cashews, so I waited until just before I served it.

This was just ok for me.  I really wanted to like this, but I'm afraid the orange in the cranberry sauce was a bit overpowering.  I used mayo, but the sweetness and the orange really stood out making it taste like it was made with miracle whip (which I'm not fond of at all).  I will try this again, but will use my own cranberry sauce (Martha Stewart's cranberry grape compote!) and maybe add some chopped onion.

Delicious!  Mine version deters as I didn't have exactly the same ingredients however, the salty, sweet flavoring works great with the thyme and sage spice.  my substitutes...craisins(cranberries), pistachios(cashews) and chicken breast meat(turkey, Kosher salt.  This is a must make recipe!

Step 2 is how I usually make my cranberry sauce. This was such a great way to use up the leftovers! I didn't have any cashews or celery on hand but it was so simple and perfectly yummy. I'm happy to leave the first review here.

After first time I made this, my husband suggested we buy a larger turkey so I could make more of this salad. Except for using Craisins instead of fresh cranberries,  I followed the recipe as written. I've made it 3-4 times and enjoy this salad more than the freshly roasted turkey.

Made it exactly as printed. Applesauce kept the amount of mayonnaise low so it wasn't oily. Flavors blended well. I'll make this after every turkey dinner.
