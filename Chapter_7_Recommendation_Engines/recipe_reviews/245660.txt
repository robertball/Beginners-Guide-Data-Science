It was too cold to use the grill outside, so I used my oven.  Prior to cooking, I split the hen and cooked for 30  minutes in a cast-iron skillet.  I also used the broiler to brown skin for about 10-15 minutes. I also changed the ingredients: had no dried savory so I added 1/8 tsp of nutmeg, cumin, cardamom, and chinese 5 spice. I also used a Tbsp of butter at the end to baste the hen. I was unable to upload a picture, sorry!
