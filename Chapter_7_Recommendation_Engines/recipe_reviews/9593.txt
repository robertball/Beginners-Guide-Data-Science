I scaled down the recipe to only make a dozen and half, but recipe does not inform you to scale down amount of the "raisin juice reserve."  No matter how much you make, it ask for 1/2 cup reserve.  I did not catch this and had a liquid mess of shorting and sugar.  I ended up doubling the other ingrediants and now have 3 dozens of cookies that leave a funny taste in my mouth.  my mother however said they were ok.  go figure.  wont be making again.

I didnt read the directions completely the first time I made them and I used self-rising flour instead of all-purpose. I brought them to work and everyone LOVED them. The second time I made them for a bake sale and used self-rising instead... they didnt sell because they were awful. Flat and hard as a brick... Self-rising flour made all the difference.

This is the same recipe that I use. It is my favorite oatmeal cookie. I wouldn't even make oatmeal cookies if I couldn't find my recipe.

Good taste but puffy and cakey. Not what I expected or wanted. I followed instructions to a "T".  Back to the "great cookie hunt" for me. Thanks though.

These are just the recipe I was looking for. Of course, it seems that every recipe I see on this site has been altered in some way. My alterations: didn't have enough raisins, so supplemented with Craisins (r); left out walnuts; baked at 350 instead of 400. I have found that lower temp, longer time makes for a better, softer cookie. I'm glad I printed this recipe out - they're great!

Great cookies, lots of flavour.  But I found 400 to be too hot, first batch burned at the bottom.  So reduced temperature to 375 and they turned out beautifully.

Not the best for me. too cakey and the bottom burned at that temperature. Couldn't taste the oatmeal or vanilla. I'll keep trying to find the ultimate oatmeal cookie. Followed the recipe exactly.

I made these cookies with a few alternatives...I used butter-flavored Crisco, used sunflower seeds instead of walnuts, and left out the cloves.  On the second batch, I also added ground flax seeds (didn't measure, just threw about 1/2 cup in....HEAVENLY!   I am going on a camping trip and thought we could eat a couple for breakfast!  Very healthy, except for the sugar and Crisco :)

This is a great recipe if you want cake style cookies. However if you want a traditional cookie, I would substitute a cup of flour for oats. This will thicken up the batter. Also, if you are baking these on the middle oven rack – take the heat down to 350. Other than that – great!

Not my favorite.  They turned out just fine; however, they are too "cakey" for cookies.  I think I will stick with the recipe on the back of the Quaker Oatmeal box.  Interesting concept, though.

The best oatmeal raisin cookies! They were thick, chewy, and moist. When I was making them it looked like it was asking for too much spice but it was perfect. I always bake my cookies on parchment paper so even at 400 the bottoms never burned.

I changed this recipe a lot and they still turned out superior. My favorite change was that I used ground up sunflower and sesame seeds (blender) instead of walnuts. I also omitted the spices and used brown instead of white sugar. Love these cookies! And if you halve the recipe don't forget to halve the raisin liquid :)

Excellent recipe, a lil cakier than normal oatmeal cookies.  I accidentally added paprika when I went to add the cinnimon, but I did realize My mistake and correct it.  Also, I used Craisins and Cashews instead of Raisins and Walnuts.  Delicious, A+++++

I followed these directions to a t cause it's so hard to find a good oatmeal cookie.  and this was a disaster.  don't add the salt it comes out way too salty.  it's misisng something not sure if it's brown sugar or cinnamon or what but it's lacking something in the flavor.  Worst batch of cookies this xmas.

The cookies turned out really well.  Instead of 1.5 cups of white sugar, I used 1 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of stevia.  No one noticed and they were very good! I'll make these again.

I followed the recipe exactly and ended up disappointed.  Texture was fine but flavor was very bland.

Yes, I followed the recipe to  the tee, and they were perfect.   They were not 'flat', they were not 'crispy', but soft, round, and slightly higher in the centers.   The flavor was wonderful.   I shared them with a friend, and we are deciding how long to wait to make more.   They COULD become habit forming!

Thank you, they were the best I've ever baked, and the best I've ever tasted.

The cookies themselves were... well oatmeal raisin cookies. They were good, but there are a few extra steps, ingredients and needless processes for "old fashioned" oatmeal raisin cookies.

I would make again, but this is more of a flour cookie than an oatmeal cookie. Also, do not use a regular cookie sheet- they will burn. Set oven to 375 as opposed to 400, use the air-bake cookie sheet, and bake for 9 minutes.

These truly are the best Oatmeal Raisin Cookies ever. My recipe is from Betty Crocker 1971 and they were called "Old-Fashioned" then. No need to change a thing, this recipe is already perfect.

I give this recipe 5 stars. I have been making this recipe since I was 12 years old. It was my families favorite and is now my children and their families favorite.I read several bad reviews and suggest these bakers try again. There is nothing dry or diet cookie tasting about these cookies.

I must agree these are the best oatmeal cookies.  I occ. add other things like cranraisins, or chopped dates, just whatever, you can't go wrong using the recipe as printed.

Made these last night.  They were so moist and tasted great.  Reminded me of the ones my grandmother made.  I will definitely make these again.

I find this recipe comes out too much like a cake, biscuit, or muffin... just not the right consistency for oatmeal cookies. Honestly might work better in muffin tins!

Good, but like one of the other reviews said, they are a little too "cakey" for me.  I like more oats.  Nice flavor though.

I didn't have any cloves. Also I emitted the walnuts and used mini morsels. These cookies turned out delicious! My favorite recipe for my favorite cookie.

These are fantastic. Yes, they're cake like, fluffy and delicious. I'd almost say they're muffiny. We replaced half the amount of cloves with nutmeg and added a little extra cinnamon to balance the strength of the clove flavor.

I found these cookies to be too "clovie" tasting.  If I makes these again, I would definitely cut down on the ground cloves. I'm still searching for the perfect Oatmeal cookie, and this one just doesn't quite fit the bill for me
