Great texture, very moist cake, but next time I'd add more cocoa powder.

nice moist cake....really enjoyed the flavor.  I added a cup of coffee instead of water and enjoyed the combination.  Cake goes really good with a porter or stout beer for dessert.

I was looking for a chocolate cake recipe to use some extra sour cream.  We used to make a good sour cream chocolate cake when we were kids growing up on a dairy farm.  This cake turned out very dry.  The frosting makes no sense --- butter and powdered sugar?  It tasted like, well, loads of butter & sugar.  Very strange recipe.  So I doctored that up quite a bit, adding baking cocoa to make a chocolate frosting.  I don't know if that is a misprint, but be aware if you are making this.  Just use your own frosting recipe.  I baked in a 9 x 13 pan; did not have additional time to frost a 3-layer cake.

I made the cake only, in a bundt pan, as the frosting recipe seems incomplete (no cocoa powder/chocolate in it!) Cake came out moist and tasty. I used my own chocolate icing recipe to drizzle over the top. Kids & hubby loved it! I'd make it again, maybe as a layer cake next time. Thanks for the recipe!

I  used  a pre-made frosting, but the cake recipe was not changed.  I didn't have 3 rounds, so I used an 11 by 15 cake pan and it fit beautifully. I had to watch to see when it was done baking though.  The toothpick test was done twice.   I wanted to find a sour cream chocolate cake recipe like my Grandma's.  I think this one worked really well.  It is rich, moist, very chocolatey, and just an all-around great, from scratch, chocolate cake!  Yum!
