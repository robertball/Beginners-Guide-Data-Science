Followed the instructions exactly, only added a tiny bit of cream of tartar to the egg whites while beating them as I don't have an electric mixer. Difficult to say whether that affected the outcome. Regardless, the cake was completely delicious, light and flavorful. Moist for a white cake as well. I used it as the base for a whipped cream and strawberry cake, and it went over very well. Will make again whenever I need a white cake for anything.

PS. I forgot, I also added a tiny amount of lemon extract as well, to enhance the strawberry flavor.

This is an excellent recipe. I did however, cream a portion of  the sugar (1 cup) with the butter and then whip the egg whites with the remaining portion of sugar (1/2 cup).  I used this recipe for a 6 tier wedding cake for 200+ people so it is a very good recipe!

Have made it for 4 birthday's and is always a hit! Made it with egg whites only and full eggs, full eggs it's not quite as fluffy but still good. Use a milk + white vinegar substitute for buttermilk. Consistently told these are the best cupcakes they've had. A single batch makes about 20 or 22 cupcakes.

Made a sheet cake out of this recipe.  Followed the batter prep exactly.   I iced with whipping cream and fresh berries.  I cut the cooking time to 25 minutes.  The cake is sweet and delicious.

My family loves it! They say it is the "Perfect cake," and I agree. It's clean and moist, as well as perfect for decorating. The batter with take up a lot of space but it will fill two 9 inch circle pans well.

Hi so I read many of the reviews as I usually do when I am seeking a new recipe ... something to remember when you are making a cake with whipped egg whites ... FOLD FOLD FOLD AND DO IT GENTLY !!!! One of the reviews mentioned the cake being dense I can almost guarantee the reason for that was the way the whites were added ... you should use a plastic spatula start from the bottom of the bowl and bring the batter up from the bottom to the top  gently ... you will be able to tell a remarkably dramatic difference in the color and volume of the batter if you are too rough with it ... you will also have a dry dense unappealing cake ... hope this helps someone ... Now I am going to make this cake for my sisters birthday ... I plan to tint the batter her two favorite colors (red and black) ... ewwwww right l lol ... birthday girl gets what she wants ... I will update my review after

I followed the directions except baked it in an 9x9 pan for an hour. It turned out light, however, not the tastiest cake. I would not make it again.

Tasted delicious. very moist. a little dense. I bake a lot and I've never made a cake where you make a meringue and then add that to the cake.

I made this cake three times.  Made the original recipe first.  Tried adding lemon juice to the egg whites the second time to see if I could get them firmer.  Followed the suggestion in the heading the third time with brand new baking powder.  It made absolutely no difference.  It was flat and very dense each time and really didn't even taste that good.  I needed 2 layer cakes for my party and I had to make three cakes and add a layer to each just to make them tall enough to look like a regular layer cake.
