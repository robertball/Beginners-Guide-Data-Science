This recipe is quite bland if followed to the T...due mainly to the fact that it is a generic recipe by the company, but with a few moderation ...it wAs amazing. Instead of plain pre-cooked chicken. Pre marinate chicken (lime&cilantro) . Diced tomatoes with jalape√±o instead of regular non-salted tomatoes. I also added a little more of salt as well as chili powder and freshly diced garlic. I also added freshly diced Serrano peppers during the onion sauteeing process. Add all the ingredients and let it all simmer for like 20 minutes. Add some shredded cheese on top then the more sauce. Then we are good to go! It's definitely a keeper in a weekday menu

I used onion powder in place of onion and did not have any no-salt tomatoes, so I used a can of tomatoes with green chiles.  I also put a little extra shredded cheese on top before baking.

Easy and good.  I didnt have the Santa Fe cooking creme, I had the garlic one, so I sprinkled in some low sodium taco seasoning.  I also used the chili-style tomatoes like the previous reviewer and I sprinkled shredded cheese over the top of the enchiladas.  Will make these again.   These arent the best enchiladas I have ever made, but for ease of preparation and the result, I give it 5 stars.

We really enjoyed this.  I used Rotel instead of plain tomatoes and added cumin and garlic to the chicken.  Not gourmet or authentic, by any means, but a good, hearty meal that came together very quickly.

I thought the cooking creme was a little overpowering with salty flavor... and it was pasty, like another reviewer commented, too much cheese... I guess I probably just prefer my standard enchilada recipe more, it is just as easy as this one was.

This was really easy and tasted great!  Mine did not look as pretty as theirs did but still tasted good.  I used tomatoes with Chile and jalapeno peppers.  The flavor was great but it was HOT!

Used the Slow Cooker Cilantro Lime Chicken with this recipe to make AWESOME enchiladas.

I read the comments below and noticed a few people saying it tasted bland and pasty, so I added about a half cup of So delicious brand coconut milk (Like Soy Milk or reg Milk) when I mixed everything together. I also cooked my chicken with a Montreal chicken seasoning that is a little spicy and added green peppers with the onions and used a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies. Just used a little of the creme on top and then coated it with the cheese... they came out GREAT!!! Was also thinking of making this into a pizza.. ;)
