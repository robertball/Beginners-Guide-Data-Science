An excellent blend of flavors. I believe the secret of this recipe is the very thin slicing of the cukes and onion and careful grating of the ginger. I used the recipe as a side and it was well received but the best raves came from using the recipe as a condiment for submarine sandwiches- I had to make more.

Good taste, texture and appearance. Made a nice accompaniment to a Japanese meal. I didn't have mirin, so a used a regular sweet wine, and red onions to add a bit of color. I am NOT normally a fan of cucumbers, but I will definitely make this again.

A great way to dress up cucumbers.  The recipe also works well using sake instead of mirin.

Nice, fresh-tasting, super-gingery salad! This recipe makes quite a bit of dressing - it could easily be halved for the amount of vegetables called for, but I made it as written and was happy with the results. Thanks for the recipe!

This was so delicious and refreshing! The ginger gives it a nice, spicy kick. I omitted the onion and subbed pure maple syrup for brown sugar. If you juiced two cukes and the ginger and added the remaining ingredients (minus the onion) and a touch of club soda, this would make a great summer drink.

I cut the amount of ginger in half and it was still way too overpowering. Won't make this again.

A little different take on the usual vinegar and cucumbers.  I used seasoned rice vinegar in place of the mirlin and red wine vinegar.  I zested half the lime for added color.  Next time I may dice the cucumber and onion rather than slice it.  I like the ginger and lime flavors.

In Missouri I'd grown up on vinegar & sugar marinated cucumbers.  This was like this but possibly not worth the extra trouble.  I might make it again to serve as a side dish, but as my family didn't care for it, I might not.

Although I liked this, I thought the ginger was over-powering. Next time I'll cut back on it. Also, you are going to want to use very fresh, crisp cukes. I used one that was past it's prime & I didn't care for the texture of it. So I made it again using a very crisp one....much better! Thansk Christine...we enjoyed this but next time, will cut back on the ginger.

Great!  Light and yet not too sweet.  I paired this with the Chutney chicken receipe and the Cajun Chicken to balance the spice.  THe only think I did add was minced chives as I wanted more color.

Wonderful! Very nice combination, for a cool summer salad. I didn't have the sweet Japanese wine, so I substituted with what I had -which was Savion Blanc( not a real sweet wine but it worked fine). Next time I will find the right wine and see how different it tastes  from the one I used. Very good recipe.

We did a two week marathon of sushi and sushi bowls to try out a bunch of different recipes.  We enjoyed this one's bright ginger flavor with some of the heavier sauced and marinated options in our sushi bowls.

This is sure zippy.  I only added half of the lime because I just think it's too overpowering, I'd rather the ginger step forward than the lime.  This will become a go to recipe.

The wow factor on this is increadible!!! I just made this to accompany my pork adobo  and garllic fried rice.  I taste tested and the dish almost didn't make it to the meal.  I did cut ther ginger in half but believe that a full 3 Tbsp woukd be fine for me but didn't want to overpower any of my guests.

Excellent, not your typical pickle.  I've played with it a little.  Halve the lime juice, double the brown sugar, 50% more fresh ginger, and add about an 1/8 of a tsp of cayenne pepper to give it a kick!
