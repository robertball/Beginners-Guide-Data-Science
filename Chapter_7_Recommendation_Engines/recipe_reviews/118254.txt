I just had to respond to Nana's Angels.  I looked for a recipe for Biscuit Mix, as I want a healthier, more whole grain alternative to the boxed biscuit mix, so I will adapt this recipe.  NOTE: this is not the 'final' recipe for the finished product, just for the mix that you can then use to make biscuits, waffles/pancakes, muffins, really simple no crust pies, etc.  Those recipes will tell you how much to use, other ingredients etc.  For a start, but I haven't tested with this recipe, try 2 1/4 cups biscuit mix, 2/3 cup milk, stir together to soft dough, knead 10 times, roll out and cut, then bake 8 - 10 minutes at 450 degrees.  Hopefully that will work for you, and this helped.

Did I miss something? This might be a great mix, can't tell. When you do want to use this mix, how much liquid do you add,is it drop or cut, what temperature oven,and what ratio mix to liquid is used.  I could probably figure it out but it would be nice to know what the correct amounts are.

I was looking for a healthier biscuit mix, so I subbed half whole wheat flour and used canola oil instead of shortening.  I used it in a quiche that called for biscuit mix and it turned out very nicely.  Thanks for the starting point for the recipe.

i halved this recipe, because i wasn't sure how it would turn out. this was very easy to put together in my food processor. i had to use half golden crisco and half regular to make a full cup, cuz that's all i had.  so far i've only made biscuits, but man, oh, man....these are the BEST biscuits i have ever made. they were light and fluffy. i had some whipping cream i wanted to use up so i used half cream and half water in the recipe. i don't know if this had anything to do with the texture, but it almost reminded me of the biscuits u would get at one of the seafood restaurants,or a take out chicken joint.  i also brushed them with a melted butter, onion and garlic powder mixture as soon as i took them out of the oven. YUMMY! i like to make things from scratch, so i never really liked to use the store bought varieties, but have used them in a pinch, only to leave the rest(most) of the box  in my cupboard until the due date was up and then i would throw it out. Not any more. i store this mix in my freezer.  i will never BUY biscuit mix again. i can't wait to use it in some other recipes. thanks for sharing!

This turned out great.  I never buy biscuit mix, but needed some for Crustless Cheese Quiche from this site.  I scaled this recipe way down, and it worked well for the quiche.  Thanks so much : )

This is a Great recipe!  However, my personal preference; I make 1 adjustment.  I only use 8 cups of flour instead of 9.  It just works better for what i am looking for.  With the baking mix i take approx. 2 cups of mix and add approx 1 cup of milk to make biscuit batter.  It should be a wet dough mix.  I bake at 375 for approx 18 min.  I also brush with a little butter while hot.  This makes a delicious biscuit.  Also, i add some shredded chedder cheese to dough mix to make a chedder biscuit and then brush with a garlic salt butter mix.  These are also Great!

Great recipe. I think the poster's problem with bitter biscuits was they used baking soda instead of the baking powder called for in the recipe.

Worked like a charm! I scaled down to 2 servings and used in 'Quick Onion Bread'--very tasty, it turned out light and fluffy! Thanks for another recipe that's more convenient than the box mixes!

Works just like Bisquik!  One suggestion: Use this mix for Cheddar-Garlic Biscuits just like at fancy restaurants.  Ingredients:  3 cups mix 1 TBSP garlic powder (or to taste) 1 TBSP italian herb mix (or to taste) 1/2 cup shredded cheese up to 1 cup milk  butter (optional)  Mix ingredients in order, adding milk a little at a time until you have a crumbly dough. Gather the dough into a ball and pinch off 15-20 biscuit-sized pieces. Roll into balls and place on baking pan. Bake at 350 for 10-13 minutes. Brush with butter after first 5 min. makes 15-20 biscuits. Enjoy!

This is an excellent substitution for Bisquick or any of the similar baking mixes, and for anyone unfamiliar with those products you can visit bisquick.com to get some recipes (I recommend Melt in Your Mouth Pancakes).

Please note - this is not a recipe for biscuits only the mix!!! That being said it's a great mix! I've made this a bunch of times mostly for breakfast sandwiches. I usually sub butter for the shortening and it always comes out great. I've also made a healthier version by using whole wheat flour and olive oil... mmmmmm...

To all the people wondering what you do with this mix - it's a substitute for Bisquick.  You can find tons of recipes for Bisquick on their site bisquick.com - including recipes for biscuits, dumplings, etc.  It consists of everything you would find in Bisquick - flour, shortening, salt, leavening.  However, Bisquick uses a combination of leaveners - but baking powder has always worked fine in these baking mix recipes.

Easy to make in the food processor for a really nice, fine texture.  I had all the ingredients on hand and avoid buying "packaged" mixes whenever possible.  I'll use this for anything requiring bisquick.

This stuff is perfect.  I never keep Bisquik in the house, which has kept me from making certain recipes.  Now I keep a batch of this stuff in the freezer and I'm good to go.

This is GREAT!  I made it with butter instead of shortening and I made a small batch just to go with dinner that night so I just added an egg with enough water to make it all stick together.  kneaded it a few times the dropped into balls on a cookie sheet and baked at 450 for 15 minutes.  They came out perfect and sweet from the butter.  Best biscuit recipe I've made yet.

I used this recipe for the bacon pie from this site. I couldn't find baking powder, so omitted it but I'm sure it would have been even better if I had it. My pie was beautiful. Living in Australia I had no idea what baking mix was and this recipe did the trick.

I tired of purchasing large boxes of the leading biscuit mix and was trying to find a cheap way to have biscuits without making from scratch every time. I made up this mix and my 14 year old son said how good my biscuits were! He didn't know that I had switched and he noticed the difference the first time I made them. They now ask me to have them made up for breakfast, which is easy to do now on a busy morning. They taste so good and are so much lighter and fluffier and have a bit of a crunch on the outside you just don't get from refrigerator biscuits. And they don't have that weird aftertaste either. I put the ingredients in my mixer with my whisk  attachment and it is done quick and easy!

Perfect, I love this because I was in a pinch tonight not having enough dinner for everyone to get their fill. This is quick, easy to make and I always have the ingredients on hand. Next, I'm going to try it with a quiche.

Made half a batch because even though you can freeze it, there are only two of us and I don't often make things that require baking mix. It was simple...threw it together in about 5 minutes and now I've got enough for several months of cooking. And because I made it with pantry staples that I always have on hand for baking, it *feels* like it didn't cost a thing!

An easy way to cut the shortening into the flour is to use an old fashioned potatoe masher- the kind with holes in the mashing part.

Worked out pretty good as a substitute for bisquick and was tasty.Only difference I did was use  butter instead of shortening (that's what I had on hand) and cut the recipe back to 3 servings since I did not want to waste good ingredients if it did not work out.

I want to thank Tami for this basic recipe that I used in a pinch with a holiday ham dinner. I cut the recipe to 3 servings which yielded about 9-12 biscuits. I used 2 1/4 cup flour, 1 TBSP baking soda, 3/4 tsp salt, and 1/2 cup shortening.  I completed the recipe by referencing the Allrecipes Fluffy Biscuits recipe, and added 3 tsp. sugar to the dry ingredients, then added 1 egg and 2/3 cup of milk.  The Allrecipes Fluffy Biscuits recipe said to use much more baking soda, but I only used the 1 TBSP. I kneeded the dough 20 times, and baked on a greased pan at 450 for 8-10 minutes

This is great and saves money! It's so easy to make and keep at home instead of buying Bisquick or some other brand and works just as well.

I keep a big bowl of this in my pantry and we use if for everything. It is easy to make and easy to use. Also I use butter instead of shortning, better flavor and better for us.

I did not get this at all. It did not mix well. I had to add more shortening. and I had to bake it for a very long time. The result was not what I expected. More details would be appreciated. Thanks!

As I was making chicken and dumplings, I realized I was out of Bisquick, so I quickly made a half recipe of this.  The dumplings came out great!  I stored the rest of the biscuit mix in the freezer.

Using another reviewer's suggestion, I subbed the shortening for canola oil and it was great in the Waikiki Cornbread recipe on this site.  I think I'll add the shortening or canola oil as I need the mix, though - I don't have room in my fridge for a big batch of this stuff.  Thanks for a great money-saving recipe!

This recipe was awesome.  I actually didn't make biscuits, but I made a coffee cake with the mix.  I couldn't tell a difference between homemade and brand name store bought mix.  I will be makeing this recipe from now on and never buy the store bought again.

I replaced the biscuit mix inside my Bisquick box with this (so the kids wouldn't know). This way I have the recipes that I am used to. I pulsed this in the food processor - worked wonderfully. Used butter flavor crisco. Really good! Thanks.

A good ratio of ingredients, producing light, tender and flavorful results. This is a perfect alternative to store bought mix if you are looking to eliminate as many preservatives in your diet as possible.

I was thrilled to find this because I never, ever keep boxed baking mix on hand. I use it so seldomly that it's not worth buying. This is perfect because I can just make up a batch as I need it. Thanks!!! :)

when i made these, i followed the recipie exactly, except i used half shortening and half oil, since i didnt have enough shortening i also added some garlic powder and pepper to season it a little to make it into biscuits, i just added milk and kneaded until they were sticky, then i divided them into 24 biscuits i baked them at 350 for about 15 minutes give or take and they were delicious!

Seems to be a good substitute for Bisquick.  I was making a recipe for chicken and dumplings that called for Bisquick and I didn't have any on hand, hopefully it works as well for biscuits.

So easy... no need to buy ever again!  I figured the cost out to the oz of each ingredient.  Cost it out yourself, it is WAY cheaper to make than buy!  All your favorite recipes for the name brand stuff are available here or online elsewhere and work exactly the same as they always do!

I found a recipe that I wanted to try that called for Bisquick, and as I don't buy the stuff, I decided to try this.  I halved the recipe and whipped it up in my food processor.  I do agree with the reviewer who said it would have been useful for the recipe poster to include directions for whipping up a batch of plain biscuits.  I'm sure a box of Bisquick comes with instructions for doing so.  If you were planning on using this just to make biscuits -- and not in a recipe -- this mix is completely useless if you don't know how to make the biscuits out of it.

Love the freedom this gives!  I was able to make this with gluten-free flour for use in a squash casserole I found on allrecipes.com for my father-in-law, who has gluten allergy.  He would have missed out on this wonderful casserole. Thank you for the many ways I will use this in the future!

Very useful recipe to have on hand.  Mixed up a small batch and used it to make Cheddar Bay Biscuits from this site.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This is an awesome recipe!  I was looking for something to help save money and time and this is it.  I have already used this twice today in two meals that I made.  The first is the Easy Quiche and then with dinner I made two different versions of the biscuits following reviewers added ingredients to this mix - one for regular biscuits and one for cheddar biscuits (tried both versions of this with and without the added garlic powder and Italian seasoning, just added the cheese)  I used Colby Jack cheese as that was only cheese on hand.  But on cheese versions I did use the garlic salt and butter wash after it was done cooking.  Would like to see better measurements on that so not to make it too salty.  Otherwise very delicious!  I will make more of this mix and store in my refrigerator freezer and in big freezer for emergency, lol!! :)

I don't buy boxed biscuit mixes because I hate the aftertaste. So when I wanted to make Mimi's Zuchinni Pie on this site I was very happy to find this recipe as I didn't have any biscuit mix on hand. I recalculated and made this half the size. It worked like a charm. The recipe turned out great!
It didn't seem to work as well in a drop biscuit recipe I tried, but I think that was more textural on my part, as I am pretty picky about biscuits and have never been too fond of drop ones. This is a very good mix, and I am looking forward to trying it in other recipes.

I made this the other night when I wanted to make the Red Lobster Cheddar Bay Biscuit recipe, but I didn't have any baking mix. I made a half recipe and used organic non-hydrogenated shortening. I put the mix in a gallon ziplock bag for next time I make a recipe that calls for baking mix. Thanks for the great and very easy recipe!

I started making this last year and it works great.  I make half of the recipe and store it in a container in the freezer to use as needed.  I have used it for waffles, pancakes and dumplings.

Okay, just discoved this!   SOOOOO easy to throw together.  And a huge savings...instead of buying the national brand.  I only needed a small amount for the recipe I was making so,   I cut the servings in half and am storing the rest in an air tight container for future use.

This is not the recipe I normally use but it is a good one! I only gave it 4 stars because I didn't care for the sugar in it.  To those commenting on "directions" for using the mix I think they need to go back to the basics of cooking before making their own (or just BUY a box at the store since they don't know how to use it...).

I used this mix in a favorite holiday recipe. It came out so great that I will never use the boxed stuff again. The texture was light and tender. The flavor was the best. Everyone agreed they were soooo much better. I will keep this baking mix on hand all year for many different uses. Thanks!!!!

I made "Chicken and Biscuit Casserole". I didn't have buttermilk baking mix on hand so I used this recipe. It delivered perfectly. I only made enough for 2 servings which was the perfect amount for the casserole. Thanks Tami! You saved me a trip to the grocery store and the meal was more tasty and healthy besides!

I don't use enough Bisquick to justify buying a whole box, so for those rare occasions when I need some, this works like a dream.  I scaled the recipe down to serve two, which makes 3 cups of biscuit mix.  You would notice a difference in taste between this mix and the boxed stuff if you were making just plain pancakes, but if you are using it to make blueberry pancakes or as a quiche crust or something, it won't really taste different at all.

I initially made this for a recipe because I ran out of boxed mix.  I made a half recipe because a full was too much for me to handle.  There is definitely a difference in taste from the box mix.  I've made a big batch and put it in my freezer for use in all of my biscuit mix recipes.

I thought this was a pretty good recipe. I mostly used it for pancakes, for which it was missing a little something. I'm not sure what. I usually added a little vanilla, but that didn't do the trick. I used it for peanut butter cookies, which turned out fantastic. What a great time and money saver. Thanks for sharing!

Wow! Homemade Bisquick. I love it! I neede some biscuit mix for a recipe and discovered my box of bisquick was long outdated, can you say 2007? So, I found this recipe and made this up to save a trip to the store plus maybe a few dollars too. It worked out great in my muffins, and performed as expected. I'm keeping this handy, bye-bye bisquick!

I halved the recipe, and used equal parts white flour and whole wheat pastry flour.  It seemed like a lot to make, especially if it didn't turn out to our liking.  We don't use Bisquick, but this was a good solution for a recipe calling for baking mix.  We used it with Mimi's Zucchini Pie.  It was pretty good.

I needed some buttermilk biscuit mix to make some garlic cheese biscuits and turned to this recipe.  The biscuits turned out fantastic, much better than when I had used store-bought mix!  The only change I made was that I used canola oil instead of shortening.  Thanks for the recipe! :)

This worked well enough, I didn't have shortening so I just used butter and they still turned out fine since I used it immediately instead of storing.

I loved this! I added a little sugar to mine for some softness, but thought it had great texture. I will use it this morning as pancake mix by adjusting the milk.

I used whole wheat flour and vegetable oil instead of the shortening, as other reviewers suggested.  It worked great for my purposes... I was using it in a recipe on here for "Easy Quiche." The recipe called for 3/4 cup baking mix, which I didn't have. When I rescaled the recipe to make one serving, it made exactly 3/4 cup of mix... perfect and a great recipe to have on hand. Thanks for sharing it!

I scaled it down to 2 servings (made about 2 cups of mix) and used it to make corn bread calling for biscuit/baking mix (from a Sunset cookbook.) My recipe turned out great! Thanks!

I used this recipe in place of Bisquick in a Cheddar Bay Biscuit recipe.  It is awesome!  The best part is I now have the biscuit mix to use for future recipes and it is much fresher than a commercial biscuit mix.

I think this is a great recipe. I just add a little baking soda when using buttermilk. Far as measuring I adjust as I need. From biscuits, muffins, pancakes and ever cornbread/muffins(just add self-rising cornmeal).

I am a fan of stocked essentials and I really like this recipe for all around baking mix. When I want pancakes, I use 1:1 ratio for the mix. When I want Biscuits, I use 1:3/4 ratio. I like the taste of the mix and use it often.

I was making some cornbread that called for bisquik and I had ran out. I decided to give this a try and it was super easy! I'll never need to buy biscuit mix again, thanks!

I scaled it in half and it worked out perfectly.  I had to use butter instead of shortening, but no problems.  I used it for the cheese biscuits 1 recipe from this site.  Instead of keeping an extra box in the cupboard, now I can make the mix when I need it.

Makes perfect and fluffy biscuits!!! I have tried several recipes over the years and this one is by far the best and the ONLY recipe I use now. I am known for my biscuits and gravy- it’s one of the things I am always asked to bring to gatherings.  I use 2.5 cups mix to 3/4 cup milk, only using either whole milk or part skim and part heavy cream. Do NOT over mix dough. Mix until just barely incorporated and there are dry bits throughout. Sprinkle flour onto surface and dump out almost combined dough. Press into 1” high rectangle shape. Fold in half (onto itself) and press out again till about 1” thick. Cut into desired shape. Bake at 450 till golden brown, usually 15-20 minutes. Make sure oven is preheated for 30 minutes before baking. I also bake on top rack to ensure best rise and even browning.

Thanks you for the fabulous recipe! This mix is super quick to make and works great. Easier to have on hand than Bisquick and without all the preservatves. My DH mainly uses it for making pancakes, but it is so versatile. I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect. It does make a lot so it lasts quite a while. To make it a little healthier, I used Spectrum Organic Non-Hydrogenated Vegetable Shortening from the health food store which is made from palm oil and healthier than using regular shortening or vegetable oil.

In response to LMSTRANG, I didn't have enough dough to make the whole recipe, so I pulled the servings down to 4, and then made it as is. After the mixing was all done, I poured in the amount of milk you said (the mixture was a little shorter than 2 1/4 cups), and when I was kneading the dough, I had to add a little more flour. By little, I mean about 1/4 cup counting all the flour I poured onto it to be able to knead it without getting my hands all sticky. Then I rolled the dough like a sausage (thick, not long), cut it into four thick slices, and now I'm ready to bake! Thanks LMSTRANG, because I had the same question as Nana's Angels. Oh, and it worked beautifully!

I was out of bisquick and made this mix, I have now used it for biscuits twice and dumplings once. They were so good! I even gave a jar of the mix as a gift to a friend who also loves it! I used LMSTRANG's measurement of 2/3 milk to 2 1/4 mix and it was prefect, so thanks for the mixture amount!

Used this recipe to make biscuits for the Chicken and Biscuit Casserole recipe from this site. My husband enjoyed them. I scaled it down to 3 servings for the recipe. Used butter.
