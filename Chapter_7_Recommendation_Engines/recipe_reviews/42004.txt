Very good but tastes similar to "Rigatoni Florentine" also found on this site. I added some sauted chopped onions, fresh sliced mushrooms and chopped green bell peppers.  Gives the dish some color and variety! Topped with a sprinkle of mozzerella cheese and parmesean cheese over each bowl. Delish!

I had been putting off making this recipe for awhile, although I saved it, because I just wasn't so sure about it. I finally made it tonight and it was really good!! I made it without the chicken and put lots of parmesean romano cheese on top! I really like it a lot and will make it again soon!!

Can't get any easier than this.  The taste was great, especially on the second day.  Just added frozen mixed vegetables to the boiling water of linguine before mixing with sauce.  I also added a handful of shredded Parm cheese before serving.  Thanks Buitoni!!

Very good recipe. My grocery store was out of the "Buitoni Family Size Marinara Sauce", so I bought the store's version of the same sauce. I also added some garlic salt and garlic powder to the chicken while it was cooking to add some flavor. Husband & 2yr old son (who usually doesn't eat anything with "sauce" on it) loved it!
Will definitely make this again.

Very very tasty. I seared the chicken before cutting it into strips with spiced olive oil.  
Very easy.  I will make it again!
