I highly recommended this recipe . I used it to make Shrimp Étouffée ,and Conch Chowder . 
It was the first cold day in November here in the sunshine state . Nothing says fall in Florida like Sunday football and Conch Chowder  . Well maybe a little Sailor Jerry’s Rum helps too .

I used this recipe for my first time ever making shrimp stock for my first time ever making etouffee. The stock smelled delicious while simmering and made for a very tasty etouffee. I did add some salt at the end, about 1-2 teaspoons I think. Highly recommend! Thank you so much.

This was great! I did a half batch, and I sautéed the solids first in a bit of oil for a few minutes before deglazing the pan with a bit of dry sherry. Everything else I did as the recipe suggested. I think next time I will use less lemon; maybe half.

Made it to the recipe other than no celery and it was great.
