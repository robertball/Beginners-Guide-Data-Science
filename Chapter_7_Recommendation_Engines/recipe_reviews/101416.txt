Hi everyone I have made this for years, however i do it slightly different, instead ofmushroom soup i add  thick cream , i also put sausage , bacon, mushroom, onions, green & red pepers if you want a meixcan style add some salsa:) this is a great base recipe for just about any leftovers in the fridge, i have even added left over chicken, brocoli, cheese . sometimes i will top it with diced fried potatoes at well. You can literally dump in to your hearts content:)  it does best if refridge the night before , but i have made it the same day as well:) great for kids to grab quick before school, nice warm or cold .

We thought this was pretty good. It's really quick to throw together and tastes great. The only thing I did differently was to add a can of mushrooms because we love them. It's also very versitile. You could add just about anything you want to it. Next time I'm going to try using sausage and ham mixed together and my husband wants me to try using colby-monterey. Thanks so much, we really enjoy this dish!

We call this recipe Do Ahead Sausage Fondue.  It has been made in my husbands family for years!  They think it is some special recipe originating from Spokane WA.  We make it exactly as stated, our own personal family twist is we use Banquet Maple Brown and Serve, a full box, unless we leave 1/2 the pan with no sausage as my daughter and sister in law prefer.  I also sometimes use low fat cheese and soup. We use the pyrex glass pan and we do not put it on a baking sheet.  Perfect every time! Heavy calories but we only make it on the three big holidays. Reheats well the next day in microwave or oven.

I made this for My Thanksgiving Breakfast. It was such a big hit. I am so glad to have found this recipe. Thank you. 5 stars is not good enough, it should get 10 plus stars.

I made this recipe as given but opt to use "Italian" (seasoned) pork.  It was yummy.  I love the ease of cubing the cheese and preparing the dish the night before.

I love bread pudding so I was very excited to make this but something about the flavor/texture combo was off-putting which is weird because I liked the way this tasted, and I like the texture of bread pudding. I may try this again, adapting it to work in a pie crust or even better a hash brown crust.

Very Good!  My family says this is the best roast ever!  The only change I made was I used a pork roast.  I make this at least twice a month! It is that good.

VERY good!  I was a little scared by the amount of milk in the recipe, so I cut back a tiny bit.  It turned out great - perfect for our Father's Day brunch!  Great recipe!

Made this on a Saturday night and served for the family on a Sunday morning.  Great dish!  Will spice it up next time with onion and green pepper.  Super easy and everyone liked it.

Loved this!  I used turkey sausage to cut the fat, skim milk, and reduced fat cheese.  Instead of 8 slices of bread, I used 8 ounces of an unsliced Italian loaf, and just tore it up into the pan.  Finally, I didn't have dry mustard, but used about 2 tablespoons of stone ground mustard.  SOOOOO good!

Very tasty casserole. Especially enjoyed the flavor of the mushroom soup on top.
