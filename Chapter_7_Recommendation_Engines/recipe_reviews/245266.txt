This was delightfully gingerbready! It was a beautiful color with a heavenly scent.  I did wonder if I should have increased the egg mixture a bit, but I decided it was worth taking apart my carefully arranged bread to be sure every slice had laid flat in the egg mixture and been flipped over once before arranging the bread again.  There were a couple of pieces that had a touch of white left in the middle when we cut into them,  but not many.  This was tasty and straightforward and is a breakfast worthy of serving overnight guests

I’ve made this twice. The 2nd time I forgot to spray the aluminum foil and the French toast did stick a bit. My family and I enjoyed it very much!  It’s the first time I have eaten French toast without putting syrup or jam on top. It has so much flavor already that it doesn’t need anything added. Amazingly enough I had a slice left for the next day. I ate it cold and it was great. Usually I don’t follow recipes exactly but I did with this one and I wouldn’t change a thing. :-)
