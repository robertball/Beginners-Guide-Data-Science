I made one large loaf, cooked it at 350 for 35 minutes and then decreased the temp to 325 for another 15 minutes.  It turned out great!  The perfect solution to my past-ripe bananas and frozen blueberries (thawed).

This is an awesome recipe.  I substituted unsweetened applesauce for the shortening (1/2 cup) and it is still the best banana bread I have ever made!  I have made it with both fresh and frozen blueberries and didn't notice any difference.  Definitely a keeper!

Delicious! I used 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce instead of shortening, used closer to 2 cups of blueberries (a must), and used 3 bananas. I topped it with the topping from Blueberry Coffee Cake III (which made it extra special). That recipes is: Mix together 1/2 cup brown sugar, 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, 1/2 cup chopped pecans, 3 tablespoons butter. I cooked in one large loaf pan at 350 for 35 minutes, and then lowered the heat to 325 for 25 minutes. Yum!

OK...usually I hate it when people rate a recipe without making the original recipe, but I'm going to be one of those people! This got 5 stars for being a good basic recipe. I also give it 5 stars with these changes: Half whole wheat flour, half all purpose flour. Half white sugar, half brown sugar. Used Butter Flavored Shortening and added 1 tsp of ground cinnamon. This made 2 loaves. I baked at 350 for 35 minutes and then lowered the temp to 325 and baked for another 10 minutes. It came out perfect! Usually when I make quick breads, they have a tendency of coming out crisp on the outside but still gooey on the inside. I think lowering the temp at the end really helped if anyone else has that problem!

Very easy and very good! I used butter in place of shortening and I made only 1 large loaf, cooking it for 65 minutes at 350. It was awesome and I will definatly make it again!

Very good recipe.  I made a few changes, however.  I used brown sugar, "butter" flavored shortening, and frozen blueberries that I thawed.  I also added a 1/4 teaspoon of walnut extract to the batter.  For a topping, I mixed butter, brown sugar, and walnuts.  I put the topping on the batter before I baked. The recipe called for 3 smaller loaf pans but I used 2 regular loaf pans and it came out wonderful.  It was very quick and easy.

I also used about 5 rotten bananas...not sure how many comprise just 1 cup..

This was extremely easy to prepare.  I used 4 small loaf pans and also topped with butter, brown sugar and walnuts.  I used a little more blueberries than called for only because I had them on hand.  I baked the 4 loaVes for 45 min.  This was delicious and easy!

Made this recipe the other day. I didnt used shortening....I dunno why the idea freaked me out but it did so I just used butter. And I substituted brown sugar...which I think was a mistake. This bread is very tasty but I think it needed a touch more sugar or...something. I will try to make this again :)

This was really good and I changed to suit our taste.... 1/2whole wheat flour 1/2 flour...By total accident I put almond extract and it was Fab will not make it with vanilla next time because this flub so yummy. reduced to 3/4 cup of white sugar, 1 stick butter instead of shortning and a heaping spoonful of sourcream to keep the bread moist....3bananas and lots of blues. Family went nutty for these and I will continue to make this....Thanks for this delish "healthy treat"

I have to avoid sugars, so I substituted Splenda for sugar.  I also substituted No Sugar Added Blueberry Applesauce for the shortning, and cut the flour in half and substituted Almond flour for the rest. It turned out soooo moist and yummy!  Unbelievable. I can hardly believe it has almost no sugar, no fat and 1/2 the carbs!

The only change I made was to use apple sauce instead of butter or lard.  Still, my family and I agree that it would take more than that to make this taste good.  Did I miss something with all the rave reviews??

What a delicious recipe.  My only alterations were adding about 2/3 c chopped pecans and adding a "butter crumb" topping before baking. (topping is equal parts sugar & flour with enough butter to make into dry crumblies).  My hubby loved it & said "Let's save this one!"  "Yes, dear, already did!"

This was a really great recipe to use the bananas and blueberries I had that saw better days.  I used 3 bananas instead of 2.  I added a teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg to the dry ingredients.  I baked it in one loaf pan at 350 for 60 minutes and it turned out fabulous.

I have made this recipes several times over and it is a really good sweet banana bread, with a different twist.  I usually top it with a struesel topping of 1/4 cup packed brown sugar, 3 Tablespoons Flour and 2 Tablespoons Butter, cut together until coarse crumbles and sprinkle on top of bread before baking

I made this in a bundt pan subbed butter for the shortening and I must say it was just delicious.  The bread was very moist and flavorful.  Thank you- I will definitely make this again.

These were wonderful!  I had 3 small bananas, so I added all three, chopping them so that we would get little nuggets of banana randomly.  I used large blueberries that I had frozen during the summer.  I made muffins out of mine and they were done baking in 17 minutes (the batter made 15 nice sized muffins).  Before baking, I sprinkled just a touch of cinnamon and sugar for an extra oomph.  The batter seemed really thick so I added a splash more vanilla and about a tbsp of milk.  DIVINITY fresh out of the oven!

We made it and Loved it! The trick is to use OLD BANANAS. If you use new bananas in anything that requires them, it won't be very good. The older they are the better. It baked for about 1 hour and 10 minutes.

This was a great recipe.  Only change for me was to add about a cup of sour cream(which I mixed the baking soda into) just because I like my breads super moist.  My cooking time was also longer than 35 minutes..more like 45-50 minutes for two loaves.  Oh and in one loaf I added walnuts for grandma who loves nuts.  YUM!

I doubled the recipe because I had lots of bananas and blueberries I needed to use! I read the other reviews that said to lower the temp down to 325 after about 30 mins. I had to bake the bread for about an hour total, I made big loaves and this made for a longer baking time I guess! I also sprinkled the tops with cinnamon sugar before baking. Yum!

Had an extra banana whose life was about to come to an end, so I added  it to this recipe. And I sprinkled some turbinado sugar on top.  Baked for 20 minutes, and the yield was 16 muffins.  Very nice.

Very dense, tasty muffin. I didn't use shortening and just replaced it with butter with no problem.

Made this last night as muffins. Used oil instead of butter, added some dehydrated lemon zest. Baked the muffins at 350 for about 20 minutes-checked them at 15, should have checked at 18 because by 20 some were a little browner than I wanted.  But they are delicious. My daughters both love them so this is definitely getting adding to my muffin repetoire!

This turned out absolutely delicious! I made it for a pregnant friend but then ate it myself : )  I made it in 1 loaf pan and it turned out fine, I just had to bake it longer to get the middle done, around 60 mins. I also added some brown sugar and butter to the top, which made it even better. The only problem I had was that most of the blueberries sunk to the bottom, although that was probably something I did wrong. Great recipe!

This was pretty good. I used a regular sized loaf pan and baked for 60-70 minutes. Great way to use up some leftover fruit.

I followed the recipe as directed, until I added the bananas. With just the two requested, the batter was way too thick. I added the other two I had and then, it was perfect. I folded in the blueberries last. Baked in two loaf pans, this made two medium loaves and was done in 45 minutes. Very moist and flavorful bread.

I did everything exactly the recipe describes except for using the smaller pans as I didn't have any.  I ended up using a regular old loaf pan and it was not cooked thoroughly through even though the loaf was in the oven for 50 min @ 350F. However, it looked done on the outside.  I ended up putting in for another 25 minutes @325F checking it periodically and it finally got done!  Once it was baked through, it was delicious!

oh wow, this was delicious (I did make several alterations, and it takes a LOT more time to bake than the directions indicate). I used half whole wheat flour and half all purpose, used half shortening and half applesauce, used 2 eggs and 4 egg whites. I also added pecans and a dash each of cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg. I will be making this again next week for a bake sale - absolutely the best!

The original recipe is good but does need a little more sugar, blueberries, and banana. Here are my changes to make bread(I also turned it into muffins): 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce instead of shortening, half whole wheat flour half white, half white sugar half brown sugar plus add 1/4cp extra brown sugar, add 1cp extra blueberries, and add 1 extra banana.
For muffins: same ingredients as above. Sprinkle top with cinamon sugar mix and bake in muffin cups for 18-21min at 350. Makes approx. 20 muffins.

This bread is okay but VERY dense and dry. I followed the recipe to the letter the first time and my husband liked it, but I wasn't pleased. 
The second time I made it I added an extra 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder and substituted a 1/4 cup of butter, 1/4 cup butter flavored shortening and extra banana. It's a little fluffier and very moist now.

Really good recipe! Thank you! It can be used to make 1 large loaf or 12-18 muffins and they always turn out great! Personally, I always make 1 med loaf and 6 muffins each time for a little variety. :) Butter can be used in place of the shortening and I always add 1 tsp cinnamon b/c we love the added flavor. Try it, you'll like it!

Loved it!

I’m thrilled to say this was huge hit with BOTH my 7 yr old son and picky, “non-sweet eater” husband.
I’m thankful there was enough for two tins, as the first was gone in just minutes!


I made a few changes...I used whole wheat flour, butter flavored shortening, added 1 tsp baking soda, 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 cup of pecans. I also used FROZEN blueberries and it still turned out great!

Made 2 small loaves and we loved it.  I did add 1 extra banana because I had it on hand. Also I sprinkle my bread pan with sugar & cinnamon before I pour batter in.

Delicious!  Here are the changes I made:

1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup all purpose
7 tbsp butter
3 tbsp ground flaxseed (as substitute for butter)
2/3 cup applesauce, using half plain and half cinnamon flavored (substitute for sugar)
1/3 cup sugar

I baked it at 350 for one hour (covered with foil after 45 minutes to prevent further browning of the top) and it turned out perfectly.  Absolutely delicious.

I used 3 bananas and 2 cups blueberries and made 2 large loaves instead of 3 small.  Cooked for about 40 minutes and turned out perfect!!!  It really is true that you don't need butter.  Just warm up a slice in the microwave for 15 seconds and it's like you just pulled it out of the oven.  So so yummy!

This was very good.  Nice change to the standard banana bread recipe.  I did add cinnamon and a little more vanilla.  Would recommend this receipe and will making again...we live next to a blueberry farm so we have lots of them over the winter.

Excellent bread! I omit the shortening and substitute butter. I've done it with both fresh and frozen blueberries and its delicious either way. My husband and kids love this bread!

This recipe is amazing. I had 3 bananas to use up, and added a little extra blueberries I had just picked, maybe too many blueberries since they were so big. I made it into muffins, thought it would be a great breakfast item for camping. I love it!!

Oh my, this was delicious and beautiful. My changes are as follows: Used 2 cups of fresh blueberries, 1/2 cup butter instead of shortening, and I had a longer baking time of 350 for 30 minutes and then 325 for another 30 minutes until a toothpick came out clean. I reserved some of the flour mixture to coat the blueberries before adding to the batter. Also I made one addition, a topping, as follows: Combine 3/4 cup Publix Wheat Bran Flakes Cereal (crush the flakes in a ziptop bag), 3 TBSP brown sugar, 1-1/2 TBSP melted butter, and a little cinnamon and a smaller amount of nutmeg. Sprinkle topping over the batter in pans and bake. I made three small loaves and will freeze one to see how it does. Will update about that later if I can. My thanks to the original poster. This recipe is a keeper.

I made this yummy bread with applesauce instead of shortening, and it was great. Who knew it would be so good without fat! I think it could be even better with some additional spices - Next time I will try adding cinnamon and/or nutmeg and some roasted walnuts. Great base recipe! Thanks.

SO GOOD!!!  I used wheat flour and it turned out fantastic!  I also just went ahead and used a food processor for mixing the shortening, sugar, eggs and bananas.  I may have used a tad bit too many blueberries but oh well!

Fabulous recipe!! I've made 2 batches of muffins, they both turned out wonderfully. A friend also tried them and she said they were perfect! 
I did a few things differently- I used whole wheat flour, and added extra blueberries and banana. A keeper!

By far, this was the BEST Banana Bread I've ever made!!! I used unsweetened apple sauce instead of the shortening & baked it for an extra 15 mins.  So moist and very VERY tasty.

Excellent recipe, very moist and delicious. My whole family loves it.  I only had a large loaf pan so I cooked it for the 35 mins on 350 like the recipe said, but i lowered the oven to 300 and baked for another 25 mins, and it came out perfect. I will definately be adding this recipe in my tin of favorites so that I can make it again and again.

It was really good, but the center never cooked up. I used glass pans and had it in for an extra 10 minutes, but the center stayed gooey. Oh, well. I scooped that out and the rest was absolutely delicious!

This was an easy bread to make that had a great taste.  My only negative - the baking time was way off.  I didn't get them baked to doneness. I will make again & allow for more baking time.

This is my "go to" recipe I make all the time now. It always gets rave reviews. I used 4 bananas, 2 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp allspice.  Baked it in an angelfood or a 9in. springform pan (so the topping doesn't fall off) for 70 min. and before baking use the crumb topping from the Blueberry Coffee Cake III recipe from this site.

This was easy & pretty tasty -- not too sweet, which makes it go well with a glass of milk or cup of coffee. I made it as written, except I did not have the smaller loaf pans so baked one regular sized loaf for 65 minutes. I think it needed more bananas and blueberries. Next time I will follow others' advice and use 4 bananas. I will also increase the blueberries to 1 1/2 - 2 cups and maybe add some cinnamon.

My husband LOVED this bread and ate over half a loaf the night I made it. I made a few changes. Butter flavored shortening(just because thats what I had) 4 bananas instead of 2(dough was really thick after 2) Added a little bit of cinnamon (because I love it) and used frozen instead of fresh blueberries. Turned out wonderfully. Next time Im making 1 big loaf.

Very good recipe!  I halfed the recipe - and used part whole wheat flour and part all-purpose.  I also used half splenda and half sugar and butter,instead of shortening.  Blueberries were frozen and still came out well.

It was  so easy to make!  This bread turned out to be very good.  I used butter instead of shortening.  I also did not have vanilla extract at home, so I used amaretto liquor.  I can not taste the difference. yum yum

LOVE this recipe!  My family is gluten-intolerant, so I just use Bob's Red Mill's GF All-Purpose Baking Mix and a little bit of xanthan gum.  They are a big hit in this house!

I used butter instead of Crisco 'cause I was out of Crisco. Baked them in an 8-count mini-loaf pan. They turned out kind of like muffins but with a firmer edge. These were very good. I might try buttermilk or walnuts next time for a little flavor enhancement.

I made one large loaf and added toasted walnuts; instead of shortening I used 1/2 cup mayo (sounds strange but it works cause its a fat and you don't taste the mayo) Cooked it for 35mins @ 350 then for 25min @ 325 (I guess oven temps vary), I also used 1& 1/4 cup sugar and blueberries very yummy and moist

I used agave syrup instead of sugar and butter as the shortening...after baking for 35 minutes, the middle was still raw. I cut it in half and the middle started to ooze out after another 5 minutes. I have it in the oven now for another 10 minutes :) Thanks!

Love love love this bread. My subs: a bit less than 1/2 cup sugar, 2 T honey, 1/4c safflower oil & 1/4 c organic applesauce instead of the shortening. 350 for 1/2 hr, then reduced heat to 300 (my oven runs hot) for 10 min, checking every 5 min for doneness. It was moist and perfect. Not too sweet!! I have four more bananas so I'm going to just do banana. I would try this with strawberry too.

Amazing! I doubled the blueberries and added 1/2 cup chopped strawberries and 1 tsp cinnamon. Made one large loaf and baked 35 minutes at 350 and then 25 at 325. Delicious warm with cream cheese!

This is very good. I used wheat flour and also put the butter, walnut, and brown sugar mixture on top. I think it would have been okay without the topping, but it is excellent with the topping! It took about 40 minutes in two regular loaf pans.

I don't like to change recipes but in this case I made a substitution and a mistake.  The recipes was very forgiving. I did not have shortening and decied to use butter as someone else had suggested.  It was frozen and in my haste to soften it in the microwave, the butter totally melted.  I used the melted butter anyway -even though I knew it would not 'cream' with the sugar properly.  The bread was absolutely wonderful.  My husband loved it, too.  I will definitely make it again - the right way - just to see if there is a difference in taste.  I also used a regular sized loaf pan and baked it for 70 minutes.  Fabulous bread.

Tasted great, but my goofy oven messed up the top so it was a bit (and by a bit I mean a lot) crispy.  I like that, though, so no harm done.  Maybe I'll eventually get a better oven.

I substituted whole wheat for the all-purpose and used Splenda's brown sugar mix and while these loaves turned out denser then the recipe probably intended, they are still quite good. I did do the butter, sugar and walnut topping (again using Splenda) and I think it's the topping that sealed the deal for me.

This is a simple and easy recipe that I will continue to use when making banana bread/banana blueberry bread. I have used this recipe at least 10 times (with and without the blueberries) and every time they are incredible. No changes are needed.

Preferred to use 1/2 c. butter, and added 4 small overripe bananas since needed to use them. Delicious! Made about 20 cupcakes and cooked for 19-20 mins. Thank you to reviewers who suggested cutting down the temp to 325 when baking a loaf to insure the middle will cook- I will definitely try that next time.

I modified this recipe and made one large loaf, and it took nearly 70 minutes to bake before the skewer came out clean. I used a little more salt, half the sugar, and put pine nuts on the top before baking.  Turned out great.
