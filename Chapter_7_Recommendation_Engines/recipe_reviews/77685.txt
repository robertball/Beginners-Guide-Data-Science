Very delicious recipe! My husband and I cooked this one together and we did make just a couple changes that I would recommend...leave out the cornstarch and peanuts and use 3/4 cup of chunky peanut butter instead. It gave it just right flavor, texture, and thickness. If it seems a little thin at first just cook until it thickens. The flavors in this dish really blend well. The cilantro and green onion really gives it the perfect unique taste, and it's not too pea-nutty. We served this over steamed brown rice along with some steamed broccoli. This one is a keeper!     This was my review a couple years ago. Since then I have discovered that this is a lot better served over rice noodles. Also I add broccoli and bean sprouts. The broccoli flavor works really well in this dish. And I also add lime juice to the peanut butter.

This was delicious - though I made some changes. I used canola oil; 2 cloves of garlic (we love it); added chili flakes and about 1 TBS hoison sauce to the soy mixture and finally, I didn't use chopped peanuts. Instead, I took the advice of other reviewers and used about 3 TBS of chunky peanut butter. At first, the whole "concoction" looked a bit runny and I started to get worried. But let it simmer for about 10 minutes and you're good. I served this over white steamed rice and the best part is that the peanuty sauce will coat the rice and its mmm good. Boyfriend went back for thirds!!

This recipe is full of flavor, but I would definitely agree with doubling (if not tripling!) the sauce measurements, especially if you're thinking of serving this dish with rice or noodles.

Do note--the cilantro and fresh ginger are prominent, as in most dishes in which they play a part.  So, if you don't go for these tastes, reduce or leave them out.  This recipe is absolutely top shelf.  I served it with instant white rice.  They only modification I might make is to reduce the peanuts a bit to your own taste.  Two cups is a LOT of peanuts for some folks.  I dig peanuts, so it's okay by me.  The complex, slightly exotic taste of this dish is excellent.  My mother in law didn't like it, but she doesn't go for anything too far off the beaten path.  If appearances count to you, you will love this one.  It's plates up beautifully.  Restaurant quality, indeed.  And delicious!

This was one of the best dishes I've made.  Definite keeper!  I did alter one thing...I used CHUNKY peanut butter instead of the nuts, about 1/2 cup.  The sauce was thicker, kinda creamy and really yummy!!!!

This recipe had a great deal of potential, which I hope to exploit the next time I make it.  I think I will double the soy sauce, use honey instead of sugar, add more ginger and double the cayenne, decreasing the amount of broth as needed.  I added broccoli and red onion, and halved the amount of peanuts.  There will still a very satisfying amount, and that, plus the additional veggies made it considerably more healthy.  Thanks, Denise.

The flavors in this are great, but it needed more of the seasonings.  While I didn't double the broth, I did double the other sauce ingredients, resulting in a wonderfully spicy, vibrant dish.  I also added broccoli.  Next time, I'll exchange some of the chopped peanuts for peanut butter to make a creamier, more substantial sauce.

It takes a while to chop everything up, but after that it is easy to make.  And it is well worth the work.

Really good recipe.  The flavor is great and it's simple to make.  I didn't have cayenne pepper so used black pepper and chili powder instead.  Also marinated the chicken for a bit in soy sauce, pepper, and chili powder.

I am really disappointed in this recipe.  The only change I made was to add some peanut butter, but I still put in the exact amount of spices and other ingredients.  My husband and I both thought it was extremely bland, it tasted like nothing.  For all of the wonderful ingredients I added, I thought it should have much more flavor.  If I were to make this again, I would double almost all of the ingredients that went into the sauce.

WOW! This was soooo good. SOSOSOSO good. We will definitely make this often, since we usually have most of these ingredients on hand already. The only changes I made were the omission of the cayenne and using only half the peanuts. It really did seem like a LOT of peanuts. Maybe we measured wrong? I really liked biting into a nice bit of peanut now and then, so I wouldn't substitute with peanut butter like some did. I added some shredded carrots because I wanted more color. I will probably do that again next time and maybe add broccoli as another user did. Served over jasmine rice with mandarin oranges as a side.

My picky family loved this dish!  I doubled the sauce ingredients and used the dry roasted nuts.  Food processor would be a great idea next time to chop the nuts.  Flavors were great and in less than 30 minutes, we had a delicous dinner!

This recipee was a huge hit at our house!  After reading many of the reviews, I made the following changes to the recipee and it was absolutely delicious...even my picky teenage daughter had seconds.  I doubled the soy sauce, sugar and garlic, used 1/2 bunch of cilantro and 1/2 cup chunky peanut butter. Didn't have cayenne pepper, so used 1/2 tsp. cajun seasoning...also used vegetable oil instead of peanut oil. The sauce took longer than 5 minutes to thicken, but once I added the peanut butter, it was perfect...let it simmer about another 10 minutes.  I will definitely make this again.  I served it over white rice (very good).  I'll try brown next time!

This was absolutely delicious!  I took advice from other users and used the peanut butter instead of the peanuts because I don't like the texture of nuts once they have been warmed.  A little goes a long way for the cilantro.. it's flavour is very prominent in this recipe.

Good recipe. I omitted the peanuts and added frozen stir fry veggies. I've been looking for a stir fry sauce that had some flavor.

This is a good recipe and I think the peanut flavor is just right - not over dominating the dish. Perfect with cilantro. I took the advice and added 1/2 cup peanut butter, cut down peanut to 1/2 cup. I combined the ingredients for the sauce and let it simmer in a sauce pan on low. Meanwhile, prepared (cut up) and cooked the chicken and vegetables, then added the sauce. The vegetalbes are not over cooked this way.

This recipe is great but you must be sure to only use a small amount of cilantro, maybe 1/4 cup loosely packed or else it will take over the flavor. I used cashews and they tasted great too! Very good dish!

I made this recipe using creamy peanut butter, added broccoli, and served it with rice. The sauce turned out very thick and the dish was very heavy. It didn't taste bad, but you couldn't eat very much of it. I would recommend putting more cayene to make it more spicy. Also add more chicken broth and reduce peanut butter for a thinner sauce.

This was really tasty. Nice dish full of flavor and also easy to modify. My changes were: 2 cups of chicken broth, 1/2 cup crunchy peanut butter. I also added broccoli and carrots. No cornstarch was necessary. The sauce thickens as you cook. Will definitely make this again!

This was an excellent dish! Thank you so much! I did double the recipe though since I was feeding six adults. Also, red pepper tends to overwhelm a dish, so I used half the amount called for. All in all, a complete success. There were NO leftovers!

This recipe was delicious and packed with a great combination of flavors. It had a real authentic Asian taste. I had to make a few changes, because I didn't have some of the ingredients on hand. I used extra light tasting olive oil, skinless-boneless chicken thighs, 3 chicken bouillon cubes with 3 cups of water, forgot to add the sugar, granulated garlic, crushed pepper flakes, black pepper, and 1/2 cup chunky peanut butter. I reserved some of the chopped scallions and sprinkled them over the dish before serving. This recipe is a definite keeper! Thanks for sharing it.

This certainly wasn't bad but it really wasn't anything special either....your basic stir fry with peanuts. Way too many peanuts- and we like peanuts.

Delicious!!!  This recipe is definitely worth a try.  All of the seasonings compliment eachother very nicely and the peanuts add the perfect touch.  My picky 3 year old son even loved it.

This was awesome. It really tasted like I got it from a restaurant. I only used half of the cayenne pepper because I didnt want it to be so spicy. I will definately make this again.

It was edible but all I could taste was cilantro, which completely overpowered the dish. I wouldn't make this again.

My husband loves this dish although I made it my own.  I took other reviewers advise and added 3/4 C creamy PB to the sauce.  I omitted the sugar, cayenne, cornstarch, and peanuts.  We love spicy foods so I add sirracha.  I am not a fan of peppers, so I steamed (in the microwave) broccoli.  We served this over rice and it is oh so good!

This is awesome! I omitted the red pepper, and used stir fry veggies instead. I also added the 3 tbsp chunky peanut butter others suggested. I will definitely make this again.

Awesome.  I didn't have chunky peanut butter (like many reviewers suggested) so I added 2 tablespoons smooth PB in addition to the cornstarch.  Because of this, I didn't add sugar and halved the peanuts.  I also added julienned carrots and onions instead of the bell pepper, and stirred in some steamed broccoli at the end.  I would say the recipe doesn't quite feed six people- maybe 3 or 4. Serve with brown rice and it's a great meal!

DELISH! I added broccoli rabe and small yellow onion. I also skipped the cayenne pepper and used a jalapeno (i had it lying around). I used a 1/2 cup of peanut butter and about 1/4 cup chopped peanuts. all in all, very yummy! i ate it alone, but i'll definitely try this over rice or pasta in the future.

Very tasty and easy, but it adds a great deal more depth of flavor if you use just a dash of sesame seed oil.  I used the chunky peanut butter, left out the corn starch, and waited for the sauce to reduce.  Added the chopped peanuts after, with the green onion, the cilantro and the sesame oil.  Grrrrreat!

YUM! I added Sriracha sauce (asian hot sauce) and 2 tablespoons of peanut butter to make a sweet and spicy sauce- doubled the sauce recipe.. but ended up having too much so I thickened with flour. But I used some of the extra suace to marinade the chicken (used boneless skinless chicken thighs). I also added broccoli and topped on white rice. A little time consuming but the fresh spices made the sauce awesome so worth the time.

I have to start off saying that I did not have peanuts or green onion but it still turned out awesome! There was plenty of sauce(I have a boyfriend that loves lots of sauce with everything!) The sauce was an excellent consistency and very flavorful. I will definitely make this again.

I would say this is just ok. I added some broccolli and purple onion, but otherwise made it as written. When it was done I tasted it and it was quite blah. It had very little flavour. So, I added a couple of tablespoons of peanut butter and a little extra soy sauce as suggested by other reviewers. It tasted quite a bit better after that, but I wouldn't make it again.

This came together so quickly and easily. Highly recommendeed!!! After reading other reviews I made these changes:  1) Add 2 tbsp. peanut butter and decrease chopped peanuts to 3/4 cup. 2) Marinade chicken in the sauce for 30 mins. while you chop the veggies.  3) Triple all sauce ingredients except for chicken stock. Use 1 1/2 tbsp corn starch. 4) I added 1/2 steamed zucchini, 2 cups steamed broccoli and 8 mushrooms.

We were so disappointed with this recipe. We took a couple of bites but did not care for it. The chicken had no flavor at all and the sauce never thickened up and it didn't have a good flavor. Try the Thai Peanut Chicken recipe on here, it's sooo much better.

Original recipe listed needed some modifications. As recommended by other reviewers, I doubled all the spices. I reduced the chopped nuts to 3/4 cup and added 1/4c peanut butter to the sauce. Still, it was lacking something so I'd play around with the measurements if I made this again.

Wow, this was a great recipe. I doubled it & served over jasmine rice. Served it with fresh orange wedges & the fam thought it was a wonderful compliment to the main dish. Changes made: used 4 tablespoons of peanut butter plus 2 tablespoons cornstarch (remember that I doubled the recipe) - the peanut butter didn't thicken it up enough for me. Also, I used 1 c. chopped peanuts, one larger pepper & kept the onions & cilantro at one bunch each (maybe a little less). A also did not double the cayenne pepper - just used a rounded 1/4 teaspoon. Perfect amount of spice for the adults & kids!

I made this for six people, and it was a hit.  No problem with the sauce thickening, but it did take a little longer, about 7-8 minutes.  I added broccoli florets and reduced the peanuts to 1/2 cup, for taste and calories.  Hint:  To quickly "chop" peanuts, put them in a food storage bag and lightly pound with a can or mallet.  Instantly chopped.  Thanks, Denise.

I made this recipe the other night and made it exactly as it read with the exception of adding more vegetables. It was good but not great. I found it to be a little bland tasting, something seemed to be missing.I read the other reviews that added peanut butter but to me that's not really rating the recipe for what it is if you change the ingredients. I don't think I'll be making this again.

Fabulous served over Japanese noodles.  I cut back on the fire because my husband prefers mild flavors, but we both agreed that next time we should make this just as is.  I also wished I had cut the chicken into smaller pieces so that every bite has a little chicken in it.

My husband made this for dinner last night and although it was good it was much too spicy for us.  I asked him if he read the "most helpful," reviews and he did not.  If he had he would have saw that he should have cut back more on the spicy ingredients (even though he did somewhat.)  Also, 2 cups of peanuts seems like a lot of peanuts.  I would have liked to tried this with peanut butter as others had.  Thanks for sharing!

I couldn't get broth, and didn't know the Japanese word for cornstarch, so I used boullion, and took the advice of thickening the sauce with a bit of peanut butter.  Very tasty!  I will make it again!

I'm eatin' the left overs for breakfast right now! It was so Good everyone enjoyed it. We will put this in our meal plan rotation =). I did follow the example of a few others I used all natural peanut butter and creamy. The all natural had a little less of a smooth texutre and a roasted flavor. I also omitted the Bell peppers. Over rice this was a dynamite dish. Thanks.

I'm not a great cook, but this was a phenomenal dish and easy enough to make.  When i do it again, i will put the peanuts in the food processor instead of chop them with a knife, might be a little easier.  Thanks Denise, i owe you bigtime!

I made this dish on Sunday night  - it was great.  I used about 3 tablespoons chunky peanut butter instead of peanuts which gave the sauce a creamier consistancy.  I also squeezed about a 1/4 wedge fresh lime juice in.  Next time, I will use the cornstarch to thicken up the sauce and use more soy sauce for more of a kick.

Great recipe but I changed a couple of things.
1. I added sauteed mushrooms, carrots & broccoli for more flavour and colour.
2. Added 1/2 cup of crunchy peanut butter and substituted the chopped peanuts for walnuts.
3. I took the advice of other reviewers and seasoned the chicken with black pepper before frying it in the beginning.
4. Also added more cayenne pepper and some chili flakes since I like it a little spicy.
Overall, I really liked this recipe!

Double the sauce!  Used 1.5 cups of natural crunchy peanut butter and broccoli as another reviewer suggested. Still used 2 tbsp of cornstarch though. Served over rice noodles.

Very good dish..I was out of chicken broth so I used some left-over chicken gravy which enabled me to also leave out the corn starch. I didn't have fresh ginger so I used a pinch of powdered. Didn't add cilantro, added a teaspoon of peanut butter. Served over rice noodles. Will make double sauce next time. Added frozen oriental veggies on the side and mandarin oranges! Quick and tasty dinner. Thanks for sharing.

Used 3/4 c chunky peanut butter instead as suggested.  Doubled the sauce as suggested.  Added broccoli, bean sprouts, and sugar snap peas with the red pepper.

I made this for dinner last night, it wasn't horrible but it wasn't as great as most of the previous reviews suggested. Overall, my bf and I were pretty disappointed, this isn't something I will make again. The only change I made was doubling the sauce, because so many others recommended it and said it was so delicious.

The chicken came out really bland. The sauce does have some good flavor, especially with a dash of chili sauce. Overall the dish is probably a good base. The only change we did was only 1 cup of peanuts.

Next time I will marinade the chicken in the sauce and cook the veggie/s first, set aside, cook chicken and sauce at the same time then add the peanuts and veggie.

I found this recipe too soupy and bland.  I also found it incredibly salty but that could be because I used stock instead of broth.  Regardless, I wouldn't make it again

Kinda bland. Needs Garlic. Double the sauce. Not bad for home chinese food though. Not expensive or hard to make in a hurry.

Awesome recipe. I did as others suggested and swapped the cornstarch and peanuts with 4Tbs of crunchy peanut butter. 
I also doubled all ingredients in the sauce recipe with the exception of the chicken broth. I used 2 cans of chicken broth which is a little more than two cups 2 cups rather than 1 1/2 cups. The only thing I would do different is add more vegetables. I served over noodles. Was an excellent meal and will make it again.

Very tasty and easy.  I made a few changes.  In place of garlic, I added 1/2 teaspoon of wasabi powder, and 1/2 teaspoon of ground ginger instead of fresh.  I halved the amount of peanuts, which was plenty.  This recipe only serves 4, even when served over rice.  Overall, good recipe and I will make it again.

It was truly delicious! I sauted chicken with prepared ginger and garlic then added the chicken broth, soy sauce,  cayenne, and cornstarch. I decided to add peanut butter as other reviewers had suggested, but chose to keep the peanuts. I also sprinkled some crushed chili's for a bit of heat. I am looking forward to leftovers tomorrow:-)

Unbelievably delicious! Can we give more than 5 stars? I never cook with these combos of ingredients and wasn´t too sure about trying it.  Well, it was a smash hit even with two finicky kids and a meat and potatoes husband.  We all loved it.  I used regular corn oil and had to use flour, forgot to get corn starch, it was more than terrific.

4 Stars for the great base recipe. I also added peanut butter and doubled the sauce. I also added extra spice and thought that did the trick.

My husband found this to be the best thing I have EVER made, and he's a tough food critic. It's a little spicey for my taste, so I will be leaving out the cayenne pepper on my portion next time, but he loved it. I also left out the cornstarch and used chunky peanut butter. Great success! Can't wait to make it again.

Unlike many other reviewers, I wanted a dish with whole peanuts and a nice sauce, not a dish with peanut sauce. I left out the cilantro as I don't like cilantro and I doubled the sauce ingredients with the exception of the broth. I thought it turned out wonderfully! I would definitely make it again this way although in the future I may cut down on the peanuts as the peanuts seemed to overshadow the chicken! Also, I added broccoli to this dish, but did not increase the sauce. I just barely had enough sauce to cover everything. I would consider increasing the sauce amount if adding anything else to this dish or if you want a lot of sauce for rice.

Oh, man, this was fantastic. I cook for three, and I'm on Weight Watchers, so I was happy to be able to fill myself up on 8 points (well, plus 3 for the rice)! I made a few of the changes recommended by other reviewers. When the chicken was mostly cooked through, I added a few cups of fresh broccoli. I doubled the sauce, but I shouldn't have doubled the chicken broth as well, since I ended up having to add 3 TBS of cornstarch after adding it to the pot to thicken it up. However, letting the chicken and broccoli boil in the sauce for ten minutes turned out to be a good thing - they really absorbed the flavors. I did 4 TBS of peanut butter instead of peanuts. Added a little bit of Thai Peanut Sauce I had sitting around. Did dried ginger and cilantro, with some cinnamon. Had plenty of sauce, served over white rice. Delicious!

VERY tasty sauce!! Loved it! The chicken was too dried out though... I think next time I'll cut it smaller and season it more while cooking. Also... I substituted Splenda for sugar, as I'm following the South Beach Diet. Worked great! I also added a splash or 2 of Asian fish sauce for flavor enhancer as well.

This was excellent! I served this for a small dinner gathering.

I also admitted the cornstarch and used about 1/2 cp of extra chunky peanut butter.  I added in some brocolli (so happy I did) and served over basmati rice! Fantastic!

This is an excellent recipe.  Made this per the recipe, except left out cilantro, as we didn't have any on hand.  The sauce was perfect and would be a good all purpose sauce for other chinese dishes.  You could make minor adjustments such as substituting beef broth if you're making a beef dish.  After the cooking was completed, I added ~ 1/4 c. peanut butter per some of the other reviews.  It gave it a richer peanutty taste, but I actually think we preferred it without the peanut butter.

This was really good.  I did double the sauce, added about 1/3 cup chunky peanut butter instead of peanuts, marinated the chicken in soy sauce and cayenne before cooking, and served with vermicelli rice noodles (found in the Asian section of the grocery store)... very good!  We squeezed lime on top.  Yum!

This is a very easy dish to make but it looks & tastes like you spent the whole day on it. I add either broccoli or fresh green beans when I saute the peppers. I increase the broth to 2 Cups. I omit the sugar and after adding the broth mix to the pan, I add 1/2 C chunky natural peanut butter. I also decrease the cilantro to half a bunch. At the end I only add about 1/2 Cup chopped peanuts.

Way better than a lot of recipes I tried. I agree that is more American than Thai but the title isn't :Thai Peanut Chicken", it is "Denise's Peanut Chicken" so thanks go to Denise! Update: this is a regular weekly meal in our house now. Very quick and easy to make on a working girl weeknight with the new steamed rice in the frozen vegetable section of the grocery store. I can do this from start to finish in 20 minutes flat and it's a very forgiving recipe. I use creamy peanut butter just because it's a pantry staple and quicker.

Followed the recipe to a "T" but eliminated the peanuts and instead added one heaping tablespoon of extra chunky peanut butter. I also added 1 T of hoisin sauce.

Yum! Absolutely delicious!!

Excellent and easy.  I used about 1/2 c peanut butter and 1/4 c peanuts as others suggested.  Next time I will probably omit the cornstarch and add broccoli.  The cilantro is necessary, in my opinion, to provide contrast, brighten the flavors and keep the sauce from being too rich.  Even the kids liked this.

This dish was great!  I doubled the bell pepper and minced garlic (just a preference thing) and added only half the peanuts that were called for, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly as written.  Oh my gosh it was good!  I had never used wok oil before and I loved it; I thought that it added a great flavor to the chicken.  I would highly recommend this recipe.

This is amazing!!!!  Best recipe off this site for me so far, I think.  I used the peanut butter as others suggested and went VERY light on the cilantro--one palm full was plenty, but don't omit it!!!  You need the flavor.  I served it with white rice, and the Sesame noodles and Asian lettuce wrap from this site for my Mother-in-law's birthday and it was a major hit!  Thanks for all the good recipes!

I give this 3 stars because my husband and I disagreed.  I did not like it at all... I tasted too much of the ginger and parsley.  My husband liked it but he wasn't raving wild.  Be sure to pick up UNSALTED peanuts when you shop!

This was so yummy!  I added 3/4 cup of creamy peanut butter because I didn't have any peanuts.  It was very good and I can't wait to make it again.

SO GOOD! I followed some suggestions and added broccoli and about 2T peanut butter. I used 1 1/2c peanuts (ground them up in my food processor) and would NOT leave them out. That said, I am a texture girl and I think they added a lot to the dish. My husband stated that this dish was so much better than the asian take out we'd had about a week ago...and boy was he right!

Everyone really enjoyedthis at dinner tonight. Ifollowed previous suggestions and substituted 3/4 cup of crunchy peanut butter instead of the peanuts and cornstarch. I also used honey instead of sugar - Both changes are highly recommended.

Instead of scallions I used regular onions before i put in the chicken, and I didnt have any cilantro.

Other than adding extra vagetables: broccolli, carrots, snowpeas and mushrooms, I kept the quantities about equal, and just multiplied it by the amount of chicken I had.

Thanks for a grest recipe

The three of us really enjoyed this.  I was conservative with the cilantro and onions, but will use the full amount next time. i will also use more ginger and garlic.  I used natural peanut butter and the sauce was a little grainy, which made my husband rate it a four.  My 7-year-old had two huge helpings and then went back and picked the last few pieces of chicken out of the serving dish, which merits a five-star recipe in my book.  Thanks.

Be careful with the cilantro and ginger.  I put a little too much in the dish.  If I make this again I will add more vegitables and less peanuts.  Good flavor!

I really liked this recipe.  I followed some reviewers' comments and used peanut butter.  I used 3/4 cup, but 1/2 would have been plenty.  I didn't have any sugar on hand, so I used a little honey.  That was fine.  I omitted the cornstarch.  The sauce was still thick enough.  I reduced the cayenne pepper a lot because my boyfriend doesn't like spicy food.

He didn't like this recipe at all, in fact.  He didn't finish his serving.  I think he couldn't get the concept of peanut butter and chicken.  Oh well!  I'll cook this again for myself!

Followed the recipe exactly. It was ok. Put the peanuts into a ziploc bag and crushed them (but not into a paste) by rolling a cup over it.  Probably will not make again or may weak with peanut butter next time.

Omg! Yummy. Very pleased with this. We use it for meal prep in my house and it’s stays great all week long. I always try to add some greens or veggies because it can be heavy.

This dish is delicious, like other reviewers I used crunchy peanut butter and doubled the sauce, probably could have tripled it, once I added lo mein noodles the sauce was sucked right up, also added a bag of broccoli florets, it complements the  dish. My family loves this, will make again.

This chicken was so flavourful - sweet and sour. I subbed in honey for sugar as I try to avoid refined sugar. It was easy to make. I will definitely add this to my cooking repertoire.

This is an amended review, after making this dish in excess of 10 times now. I double all ingredients for the sauce, except the chicken broth, which I only increase to 2 cups. I also leave out the cornstarch and add 1 cup of chunky peanut butter instead of peanuts; if you go the peanut butter route and still use cornstarch, you get a thick gravy consistency. As other reviewers indicate, the sauce appears thin at firsr but continue cooking and it thickens right up. We serve over steamed rice.

This is a great recipe. I made a few variations. 
1. added 1/2 tsp garlic paste and ground black pepper while initially cooking the chicken. 
2. Used carrots instead of red pepper because its' all I had. I hope to add bok choi as well in the future
3. Used red onion because didn't have spring onions.
4. Added chunky peanut butter to the broth 
5. Substituted coriander for cilantro because it's easier to find where I live. Not the best idea. 
Will be making it again, the best part is it's so quick. Thank you!

Delicious! I added the 3/4 cup crunchy peanut butter and a dash of red pepper flakes. I also added about 3/4 cup edamame. Wow. Topped with peanuts and green onions and this is a winner.  The family was fighting over leftovers the next day. 
I came across a tip for grating fresh ginger. To avoid the stringy bits that won't come off your microplaner-freeze the ginger bulb first before grating.

Good but if I make it again, I'll add another pepper and cut back on the peanuts... maybe by half.

The basic recipe was fine, but I thought it was pretty bland as written. I'll make it again, but with some changes. 

Substituting the chunky PB was absolutely the right call. My husband also gave a thumbs-up to using rice noodles instead of rice (although I wasn't so enthusiastic).

As did some other reviewers, I added a blob of hoisin. When I make it again, I'll add more soy sauce and a little more hoisin. I'll also cook the garlic and ginger in the oil first, then add the chicken. The prescribed amount of cayenne pepper didn't even make a dent, so I'll likely chunk that up a bit too.

For veggies, I threw in a half-bag of broccoli slaw and half of a bell pepper - gave it some much-needed crunch.

This was delicious, but had a little more kick than I expected.  I followed the recommendations of others and added crunchy peanut butter rather than peanuts.  This recipe is definitely worth trying!

We loved this dish. This time, I tried something a little different. Rather than serve it with rice, I stir fried it with ride noodles. Also did as others suggested and used some peanut butter and added snap peas and broccoli. Really an excellent recipe. Thanks, Denise.

Taste incredible. Only change I made was I added a whole (small) jar of peanut butter last into the boiling broth with the chicken and it gave it a thick creamy peanut texture. Incredible

This recipe is so yummy! My whole family loves it. I add whatever veggies I have on hand.  I do what others have suggested and add 1/2 c chunky peanut butter to thicken it.  It adds a much better peanut flavor.

I made this with tofu and veggie broth instead. The proportions seemed off and the broth overpowered the peanut taste. I added a few dabs of peanut sauce, which helped. 
Next time I make it, I'll try different proportions and maybe mix some peanut sauce into the sauce.
Onions and snow peas were great in this, too!

Loved this recipe but I did change it. I used about 1/2 cup of crunchy organic peanut butter (do note that if you use organic, you will need to add about 3tbs of sugar). I also added water chestnuts and crushed pepper. In addition, I wanted to make this dish more of a pad thai so I used rice noodeles instead of rice. It was delicious but did take longer than expected. Either way, my boyfriend loved it and actually said, "this one's a keeper!" I'd absolutely recommend! I added a photo if you'd like to see the outcome. (Denvercrowe) Overall great recipe!!

I wish I could give this a 4.5 because I would say it's a 4 but my fiancee adored it. I think it could use a bit less cilantro and a bit more soy sauce. The strongest flavor in this dish was probably the ginger. If you don't like ginger as much, I would recommend either grating it instead of chopping or reducing the amount.

Delicious and easy! As someone suggested, I added about 1c. peanut butter to the sauce, used boneless thighs, and also added a yellow pepper for color. I also threw in asparagus near the end since I had some to use up. Served with rice w/toasted pine nuts. I will definitely make this one again.

This is an exellent base recipe, but I would look to modify it to your liking.  This is what I did:  I omitted the cilantro and green onion since my kids are picky and I really didn't feel cilantro was the flavor I wanted in the background. I added more soy sauce for a slightly saltier taste and more cornstarch because the sauce was too runny.  I steam some frozen asian veggies (in microwave) and added them to the mix.  NOTE:  2 cups of peanuts is a LOT of peanuts.  My kids ended up picking them out and I only added 1 cup!  Cut peanuts way down and add a  heaping dollop of peanut butter if you want the peanut flavor without all the peanuts. I loved the nuts...my kids, not so much.

I can't rate this on the original recipe but only made one change.  I added a large scope of peanut butter as others suggested with no additional peanuts.  We thought it was very good.  Could have used more sauce though.

Would have given it 5 stars but I made a few changes.  As suggested I used 3/4 c of chunky peanut butter of cornstarch and peanuts.  I also added about 1 tsp of good fish sauce.  That really gave it some umpf.  I also added some chopped regular onions as well as the green onions.

YUMMY!  I used the suggestions from the others.  Cut the peanuts to half - added peanut butter.  Doubled the flavorings.  I added more garlic (love it!), cut the ginger and cilantro down(not a big fan).  The flavor was amazing.  And there was the slightest bit of spice-heat.  Will be making this one again and again!!

WOW WOW and WOW! we cook A LOT at home, rarely finding eating out better then at home...but this was a total winner. I didnt have red bell pepper, used green spanish pepper, and also added a bit of coconut...and WOW it was so DELISH! I didnt really follow the stock quantities just added what looked right...and I only had one spring onion ready from the garden to use...but the combo of flavours was just AMAZING. Kudos to Denise!!! I'll be sharing this one with my friends and adding onto my facbeook group too. THANKS MILLIONS! xxxx

We really enjoyed this dish. I did as others suggested and used 1/2 cup of chunky peanut butter instead of the roasted peanuts since that is what I had on hand. I also doubled the sauce recipe so that there was enough sauce for the rice. I had never used wok oil before and really enjoyed the added flavor, had always just used what ever oil I had handy.

This was incredible!  I also subbed with peanut butter (it was much easier).  I served it over basmati rice, the roommates loved it!  The only thing I would take notice of is that the recipe as is makes for small sized portions (in my opinion, but I feed a bunch of boys so that could be why).  I doubled the recipe.  Will definitely make again!!!

Tasty. Seasoned chicken with salt and pepper first. Added zucchini, mushrooms, and extra soy sauce. No sugar or peanuts. Served over brown rice. Very nice flavors when combined!

I love this recipe! So quick and fun to make to break up the normal dinners.  Fresh cilantro make this dish. I also add peanut butter to the sauce to make it taste like real pad thai.

Made this last night, and it was delicious. My suggestion would be to use half the green onions and substitute white onion for the other half. Next time I think I'll also add broccoli.

Made this for the first time last night, and it was a hit!  I followed the suggestion to use peanut butter, and it worked fine - but 3/4 c. was too much.  It over powered the other flavors.  Next time I will cut it back to 1/2 c.

Used regular onion instead of green onion, flour instead of cornstarch, vegetable oil instead of peanut oil, and skipped the peanuts. I added bean sprouts. I served with fried rice with green bellpepper, which provided a pretty contrast of the the red pepper in this dish. My boyfriend wants me to open a restaurant!

I followed the recipe as is, and it's pretty good.  It does lack a bit of flavor though..missing that KICK.. I guess I was expecting this to be Big Bowl's thai basil peanut chicken... will look for ways to add that flavor next time!

So good!  I followed the other suggestions and left out the cornstarch, and added 3 Tbsp. of chunky peanut butter. I served this over brown rice, but next time I'll use whole-wheat noodles.

Fabulous. Do add peanut butter to the sauce, it makes it even better over white rice. This is such a flexible recipe, so feel free to subtract and add what you like/dislike.

This was really good. My husband loved it. It's a bit like the Peanut Butter Noodles recipe from this site. At the reviewers' suggestions I added 3 Tb peanut butter to the sauce. I also put 1/3 c. peanuts which gave it more texture and crunch. And I added a bag of stir-fry veggies instead of peppers and green onions. It went great with the sauce.

I gave this recipe four stars since I used so many of the suggestions the first time. I had to add the lime juice suggested by one user, since it just made sense. And I substituted pb for the nuts, since it also sounded good.  The pb added a nice creaminess to the sauce. The dish was *wonderful* and got rave reviews(except for my picky four-year-old). I served it over jasmine rice--yummy!!--but next time I'll use rice noodles. The peanut butter amount suggested(3/4 c) was a little much for us. Next time I'll use about 1/3c and maybe some added chopped peanuts. Also, if you're using pb, I think natural peanut butter would be much better than just regular Jiff. It was a tad on the sweet side, even though I had omitted the sugar.

This was very delicious! I did add about another half a cup of chicken stock and some peanut butter (like others suggested). Just enough spice for my taste. Will make again.

Ive made this twice so far and love it ! I took some advice from other reviewers to change it up slightly. I didn't use peanuts but half a cup of crunchy peanut butter. I also altered some of the seasoning amounts.  I used 5 garlic cloves,doubled soy sauce,ginger and red peppers and left the rest as is. The cilantro and green onions are a ferfect pair.As far as the chicken broth,  I used half the amount to start and added as it cooked depending on how thick I wanted it and found myself using slightly less than called for. Next time I will leave out the sugar, dont really see it as necessary. Once all the chopping is done, the rest makes for a quick meal. Leftovers taste great as well. I put it on a plate of rice with broccoli and the next day it even tasted good as a sandwich.

I would suggest adding more veggies (brocoli, bok choy, zuccini) and more garlic to this dish. Was delicious with rice noodles - limit the peanut butter as needed. Was a bit runny but very delicious!

AWESOME!! Made it as directed except doubled the recipe and added6 tblsp of crunch PB.  Next time I will cut back on broth as my family likes it thinker. Also added a spoonfull of garlic chili sauce.  I put it over Shirataki noodles for a low carb dinner....  Shirataki noodles are a soy noodle with almost NO calories and no carbs and tasts like pasta! YUMMM

This was delicious! I wish I thought to double the recipe because there wasn't enough for all 4 of us to have seconds :( I took the advise of someone else and added some chunky peanut butter in with the broth and cornstarch and it thickened up nicely. Thanks for sharing this recipe :)

This was good, but it lacked the WOW factor as my son would say. I followed the suggestions of using crunchy peanut butter, broccoli, and hoisin sauce. The broccoli soaked up the sauce and its flavors, good addition! It did take a bit to thicken and I was getting worried it wasn't going to, but it did as others said it would. I would lessen  the broth maybe next time. I served it on noodles.  The flavors were very good and worth the try.

This is AWESOME! I did as many reviewers mentioned and used chunky peanut butter. I also increased the garlic and used chili garlic sauce. While it was simmering, I squeezed some fresh lime juice. It was PERFECT! Thanks so much!

I thought this recipe was very good as well, although based on previous reviews, I made some changes of my own. Instead of using the cornstarch, I used natural peanut butter to give it a more peanut flavor. I also topped it with bean sprouts as suggested by other viewers and doubled the garlic. Very good recipe, I will definitely make it again.

My family loved this!  As other suggested, I added about 3-4 TBSP of chunky peanut butter.  If you do that - you should cut down the cornstarch (maybe in half to 1/2 TBSP).
Serve with either rice or thin noodles.

One of the best dishes ever!  Per other suggestions, I used a big glop (probably 3-4 tbsp of crunchy natural PB) and then used chopped peanuts as a topping.

Very tasty!  I did the extra crunchy peanut butter some others did and found it almost perfect!  Next time I won't use as much cilantro or as many onions, but I think that is just our household.  It was very tasty and very presentable!  Thanks, Denise!

This recipe is YUMMY!!  I made a few small changes...instead of peanuts I add a cup of chunky peanut butter and stir it in until it melts.  I also add a couple handfuls of broccoli along with the green pepper.  I leave out the cliantro and green onions b/c I never have them.  I serve this with brown rice.

I had always been interested in recreating the thai chicken pasta that was so delicious at the Cheesecake Factory but always shied away due to the calories of the peanut sauce and the pasta involved. Well, this recipe, with a couple of tweaks as recommended by reviewers, is a darn good replica. I cleaned up the recipe a bit for my particular diet and substituted 1 large tablespoon of almond butter instead of either crushed peanuts or the peanut butter previously suggested. Additionally, I used kelp noodles, because I am avoiding wheat, but only for convenience. This recipe would also work with rice noodles or regular noodles.Yumm!! It's a keeper. My husband also loved it.

i am only giving it 2 stars bec if you follow the recipe exactly, the sauce is very bland.  i have to increase the soy sauce to 2 TBSP and use only 1/2 cup of chicken broth.  after the changes, the dish came out ok.

This recipe is awesome! It is surprisingly easy (pretty much like throwing together a stir fry) but the flavor is fantastic. I added an extra clove of garlic and a couple extra dashes of cayenne. I used 1.5 cups peanuts and added a spoonful of peanut butter, but I would think the sauce thickens up nicely without the peanut butter. I will make this recipe again and again!

I made this last night for my husband and it was Fabulous! My husband went back for 3rds!!! The fact that my husband is 1/2 Thai and thought this dish was delicious, says a lot about how great this recipe is. The only thing i did different was add 2 tablespoons of corn starch, fish sauce on the chicken for extra flavor and i took the advice of other Cooks and added 3 tablespoons of chunky peanut butter instead of the regular peanuts. The results are Fantastic!

Really yummy. I used red pepper flakes instead of the red pepper and added lots of shredded napa cabbage. I did reduce the peanuts to about 1T per serving and instead used a product called PB2, powdered peanut butter to make it a little more calorie frindly. I also served this over shirataki noodles. Pea pods with water chesntuts were served as a side dish and this was a very good meal.

Definitely a great recipe. I forgot to double the sauce, but I can see why everyone recommended it! I added some smooth peanut butter and a little curry powder to the sauce, then added green peas and chickpeas at the end; served over cilantro rice, it was delicious. The chile powder added just the right amount of heat; I would double the sauce ingredients next time, but do 1 1/2x the broth.

Yum!  I did make some changes...used organic peanut butter (instead of peanuts) about 2 Tbs. Also, served it with whole grain spaghetti noodles mixed in. Also added more broth to make a smoother sauce. We decided it would probably taste good as a cold salad too.

My picky-eater husband even loved it! I did follow the advice of other reviewers & used 3 tbl. peanut butter with just a small amount of chopped peanuts for a garnish. I replaced the fresh cilantro with 1 tbl. of Gourmet Garden (fresh in a tube) cilantro (because it's what I had on hand) and added 1/2 tsp. of lemongrass by the same company plus the juice of 1/2 a small lime, which broke up the oiliness of the peanut butter just perfectly. This one's definitely a keeper!

Loved this dish! To add more heat I chopped up a jalapeno pepper and added it with the red bell pepper.  Wow was it hot and tasty! Served it along with a side of full fat plain yogurt to cool the burn. I highly recommend this dish.

My husband made this.
He did use a bit of peanut butter -- but I think it would have been even better without!  GREAT flavor.
Be sure to watch how much ginger you use.  The more you use, the spicier it will be!

I doubled the sauce (except for the broth and corn starch) and added 2tbsp of creamy peanut butter. I didn't have any cayenne or fresh ginger, so I used a pinch of red pepper flakes and a teaspoon of powdered ginger. I will definitely make this again, but next time I'll add a lot more veggies. Four stars as-is, 5 with everyone's suggestions.

Ginger was a bit strong for my family's taste, will use less next time. Used crunchy peanut butter, but next time will stick with plain peanuts. Great recipe, just change to personal taste.

Very good. I added broccoli and also increased the sauce by 1/3. Used Thai chili sauce instead of cayenne to better control the heat,sauteed the chicken and veggies, then simmered it all in the sauce.Served with rice. Yummy!

Excellent recipe! I followed the advice of others and added the following: 
1T hoisin sauce, 3T chunky peanut butter, and extra crushed red pepper
It was very yummy. I tossed some yellow squash in mine also, but that was just because I needed to use it. I served over jasmine rice. Very excellent! Thanks!

One word-gross! This recipe calls for so many (costly)ingredients, and what I ended up with looked like dog food. So bland with no real flavor. I served this to my husband, and we had to sit thru an uncomfortable dinner b/c no one wanted to mention how bad it turned out. Thumbs way down.

This recipes was incredible!  Everyone loved it and they have been talking about it for weeks afterwards, it was a HUGE hit.  I followed other suggestions and used the peanut butter instead of the peanuts, but will add some peanuts next time for a bit of a crunch.  I served it over rice noodles and it went great!

Great recipe. Made a couple of changes, althought with the changes I made I guess it's technically "Cashew Chicken". Used chicken thighs instead of breast to combat the dryness a lot of people commented on. Sauteed it with the onions, ginger and garlic. Took it out of the pan and made the sauce seperately, then added the chicken back later. I also used sambal hotsauce instead of cayenne (1 tablespoon). Halved the chicken stock. Doubled the sugar. Added 2 tablespoons of cashew butter to the sauce, and finished with a handful of ground cashews instead of peanuts. Everyone in the family loved it.

Fantastic!!! I added about 3 tbs of peanut butter and about a cup of chopped peanuts, along with a bag of stir-fry veggies and a dash or two of crushed red pepper for a little kick.  Tossed it all with steamed white rice and then let it sit for a little while to absorb. Good stuff!!!

Made this dish last night.  Best stir fry I ever made.  I cut back on peanuts & added 3 TBS peanut butter at the end. Vegies I used were green pepper, carrots, zucchini & regular onion as I didn't have green ones.  Excellent! Will definitely make again.

Not as flavorful as we had hoped. Thought a bunch of cilantro and 2 cups peanuts wouldbe too much. Used dry cilantro, powdereed ginger, and not all the scallions or peanuts. OK but still looking for  abetter peanut recipe. Also inculed about 2 tbsp natural peantu butter chunky.

Ok now that I have eaten the leftovers I will say that the taste was much better leftover. I think the biggest problem is that you are supposed to almost entirely cook the chicken before adding the sauce and by the time it thickens the chicken is over cooked and flavorless since it didn't cook in much. I would cook the peppers a little longer because peopl e got heartburn. I liked it much better than the BF so probably won't run right out and make anytime soon.

This turned out to be a bit bland, so I don't think I will make it again.  The sauce was very soupy.  There are much better stir-fry recipes out there than this one.

Only added about a cup of peanuts, about 3 tbsp of peanut butter to the broth mixture, and cut back heavily on the cilantro, which was good because I think it would have taken over the taste of the dish. There was enough for about 3 servings.  Definitely a keeper with the adjustments.

I made this for dinner last night and followed the directions almost exactly.  I omitted the cilantro because nobody likes it and I cut the peanuts down to about 1/4 cup (I didn't use dry roasted because I didn't have any.  Instead I used redskin and they were tasty).  The end result was good...it was quick and there were no complaints.  It definitely does not serve 6 people as the recipe states though- more like 4.  We may make again, but not likely because we all found there was just nothing spectacular about the dish.

This recipe was just what I was looking for!! I added a bit more cayenne and played with a few other things just to make it more interesting. Use some chunky peanut butter instead of the cornstarch... Awesome. Definately hit the spot. Gonna be my staple Peanut recipe. Thank you!

I loved it.  My husband liked it.  He thought too many peanuts.  Also, I tossed in a ton of curry because, well, we like curry.  I think that really pepped it up.

I liked this - I think I made it very hot and spicy though - I did not have the oil that I needed in the beginning - so I used Chili Oil - but it worked and we loved it.  It was hotter than I think many would like - but we like spicey.  I am going to try it again as the recipe is written.  My hubby did think it had "too many peanuts - so I will probably add less than called for next time.

I don't know why no one has mentioned this, but this recipe left much to be desired--it was just kind of bland.  My boyfriend and I agreed that there's "something missing" from this recipe-- some kind of kick that just isn't there.  I even upped the cayenne pepper exponentially, but it didn't help.  I don't think I'll make this particular recipe again.

I changed the recipe based on prior reviews and I wish I had not.  I didn't have any peanuts so I used 1/2 c peanut butter and it was horrible.  I would make again with peanuts and leave out the peanut butter!

I followed others advice and added a couple TBS of peanut butter to the soy mixture.  I added cashews at the end and some red pepper flakes.  Didn't need cornstarch, PB thickened nicely.  The red pepper really adds a nice taste to this dish.

this was ok... I made a few errors that probably cost a star, so I'll make it again to see if it is worthy of 5 stars!  However, even with my mistakes, the taste was good, the recipe was easy and there weren't any leftovers.

Really yummy recipe.  Don't be freaked out by what seems to be the thin sauce when you are making this. The peanuts serve to "thicken" the sauce.

I was so excited to try this and I don't know what happened, but I didn't like it at all. I couldn't get my sauce to thicken and my veggies got soggy from cooking too long (because I was trying to thicken the sauce). Since most of the reviews are great, maybe I did something wrong. I may try to do this again sometime.

ATTENTION Hunters/Hunters' Cooks: This is a great recipe for all of that pheasant meat you are getting in the fall.  I made this recipe as instructed, except I substituted pheasant breast meat for the chicken, added 2-3 T. of peanut butter, and cut the amount of peanuts in half.  I served this dish with a side of jasmine rice, and it tasted great.  Thanks for the recipe and a new use for pheasant!

This was quick and easy recipe that tasted sooo good... I kept the red pepper shaker on the table for those of us who love to heat things up.
I thought the peanut ratio was a bit high.  I could easily cut the peanut amount in half BUT my kids LOVED the peanuts! I added some rice noodles and sugar peas on the side (for the kids)and that seemed to be a well-rounded meal.
This is a KEEPER!!!

My girlfriend said it best, 'you can tell this was thrown together over time.' It's true. This is not a very 'ethnic' dish and really isn't that special. Even if you double the sauce, there still isn't much going on. 

On a similar note, it's not a 5 star or 4 star recipe if you have to read the reviews and make all kinds of corrections to make it passable. I'd stay away from this one and try something else.

This is a Keeper!  I used 2 chicken breasts and pounded them out thin.  Then I cut them into thin strips, same with the red pepper.  I added 1/4 cup peanut butter, along with only 1 cup of the chopped peanuts, for texture.  I added some chili paste to give it some kick and served over rice.  The longer it cooks, the thicker it gets.  I thinned it down a bit  with a couple Tbsps. of water.  This will be good to sneak more veggies in, next time.

I don't know why this was so highly rated, its certainly lacking something. And my gosh, don't use 2 cups of peanuts. I know its "peanut chicken", but seriously, 2 cups of peanuts is a lot!

I shouldn't have doubled the sauce as others advised, because it turned out way too soupy.  It seemed like this could be a good dish, so I'll give it another try, but boy did things go terribly wrong my first go at it.

Very yummy!  I took the advice of others and used a scoop of crucnhy peanut butter instead of roasted peanuts.  I also omitted the cilantro because I didn't have any.  Everyone loved it...even my three year old daughter!

This was AMAZING! I added mushrooms and broccoli. You kind of have to tweak some of the ingrediants to your liking (the cilantro and peanuts as others have said) but this was better than any take out hands down! I served over brown rice. Will definitely make this again!

This was tasty but I did make a few adjustments. I hate to change a recipe but it needed a bit more flavor. I hated to but I needed to add salt and more cayenne. Used peanut butter for lack of peanuts in my pantry and used dry cilantro too. I will definitely make this again keeping the added salt and peanut butter but nothing can beat the taste of fresh cilantro. My husband wants us to keep this recipe around and that says alot.

We really enjoyed this dish.  I used a bit less onion and cilantro and used a pinch of ground ginger since I didn't have ginger root.  I also added a teaspoon extra of corn starch since I wanted the sauce to be thicker.  Turned out great!  Will definitely make again.

This was yummy!  I used 3tbsp of peanut butter like other reviewers suggested.  I didn't have fresh ginger so I used ground ginger and red pepper flakes instead of the cayenne.  I will add a little more pepper flakes next time...we like it a little spicier!  Definitely a keeper!

Yummy!!!!This will definitely go into my rotation. I did add creamy peanut butter as many others suggested so the sauce was thick enough. I aslo threw in an asian vegetable mix that I got from teh frozen foods section and served over thai noodles. I ate it for lunch the next day and the leftovers were evn better!

My family really liked it - cut the liquid by half or add peanut butter to thicken it up (watch the peanuts - not too many!)

Excellent recipe.  I modified it a bit, by using beef instead of chicken, reducing peanuts to 1 cup as another reader suggested and I added frozen broccoli.  Also the sauce wasn't thick enough so I added more cornstarch.  Other than that the recipe was delicious! It's definitely a keeper and will make again.  It does taste like Thai take out without the grease

I made this dish tonight and not only did it smell awesome but tasted fantastic. I added some broccoli and peanut butter.  I also substituted red pepper flakes in place of cayenne. Next time I will double the recipe so we will have left overs for lunch.

Very Good!! Even my very picky 8 y.o. son liked it! The preperation took a little longer than I had expected, but was worth it. I made a few changes though-- I added sliced carrots,broccoli, and water chestnuts along w/ the red bell pepper. I also added a little bit of peanut butter to the sauce. All in all-- a very good recipe.

Fab family meal addition.  Always looking to add variety to the weekday meals and this one is good enough for company.  Did cut peanuts in 1/2 and kids were not too keen on the strong cilantro flavor....me...I am a cilantro junkie and this meal will be a regular! Sorry kids!

Great recipe. My mods were replacing the peanuts with 1/2 C of chunky peanut butter.  Also, I left out the cornstarch, and added a green bell pepper.  I served this with brown rice. I'll def make this one again.

I LOVED this recipe. I did what other reviewers said and used crunchy peanut butter. I also made more sauce for it. Everyone loved it.  It's even good cold ,  Im eating leftovers for breakfast , although there's not much leftover.  I will make this again and again. Thanks Denise for sharing this recipe !

My husband and I love this dish!  It turned out very good.  I didn't have chicken broth, so I made my own vegetable broth and substituted it.  I used 1/2 cup creamy and chunky peanut butter.  We ate it over white rice. YUM
