If you have ever scorched split pea soup, this is the recipe for you. I followed the notes and added an extra bit of water but I also made this at 7500 ft, so my cooking time was messed up. The soup was thick enough but not too much. It was full of flavor and never scorched. I added other fresh veggies and used chana dahl (split yellow peas). I also used Sriracha instead of ketchup. Thank you, Dan in Manhattan,  for the recipe.
