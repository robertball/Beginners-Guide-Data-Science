Ok...I have to say that I tweeked this recipe big time. I used this recipe in addition to another butternut squash soup recipe. First of all, I used 2 squashes..cleaned and cut into 8 pieces..roasted them with olive oil, salt,and pepper and smashed garlic cloves for an hour in the oven..350. I then removed them from their skins..sauteed the onion and added 1 c. apple cider in addition to the chicken broth...and one peeled, chopped granny smith apple...and nutmeg, salt and pepper. I also have to say that I didnt use any of the cream cheese...the puree was perfect without..but I think I will add a small amount of 1/2 and 1/2 for a little richness. Excellent soup...thick, creamy and rewarding even if you dont use the cream cheese...way to calorie concious. Puree' in small batches in the food processor...be careful if its too hot!

I served this soup for an Oktober Fest party and everyone loved it!  I roasted the sqaush on a sheet in the oven (cut in half and roast cut side down) for about 45 minutes at 375 because roasting brings out the flavor better. (Plus it is a lot easier than cutting an uncooked squash).  I used butter because I never use margarine, and I added slightly more cayenne than called for.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  It was fabulous!

A quick and easy way to prepare this dish is to cut the squash in half, place each half face down on a plate, and microwave for about 8 to 10 minutes.  Then just scoop out the prepared squash and puree with the rest of the ingredients.  Half the cream cheese was plenty.

This recipe is great ALTHOUGH here are some hints to make it better. Bake the squash in the oven first for about 40 minutes 350 so it is easier to work with, and use only one package of cream cheese and use real butter of course.....

In a word, INCRERDIBLE.  I made this the first time, with home made chicken stock (no salt, better flavour) and only one pkg cream cheese, 3x the amount of cayenne (we like a little spice).  It was to DIE for.  Used a hand blender to puree, turned out perfect, can't understand how anybody could have grainy soup, unless squash is 'old', which can happen this time of year...we found 1 pkg cream cheese was plenty with the proportion of stock listed.   The next day, was even BETTER, mellowed out, but seemed thicker-so we used (skim) milk to thin own a tad.  Next time I  made it, I doubled the stock, and added 2 pkg cream cheese.  Still outstanding!!  For me, a nice bowl of this and fresh sourdough bread is a comforting meal.  Used light cream cheese, worked out just fine.  Not to mentiuon this was SOOOOOOOOO easy!!!!! We will make this again...and again...and again....

some of you changed it so much..just add your own ! You rated your own soup in the end.
Sorry Mary, your soup was fine as is, and if I changed anything, I guess I would add my own version undermy own title.

This soup is rich and delicious even using only 4 ounces of cream cheese.  I made a big pot of it and froze it in quart zip-lock bags BEFORE adding the cream cheese.  When I defrost it, I add the cream cheese just before serving.  It is a huge hit with my 13-yr old daughter too.

My friends and family realy enjoyes this soup.  I did make a few alterations however.  I left out the cream cheese ( greatly reduces fat content),  added in one pear ( or an apple can be used), and one potato ( a weight watchers trick,  gives soup the illusion of being more creamy).  I also broke up some spagettini into one inch bits and added this during the last 8 minutes of cooking.  Gives a different texture,  really great soup!!!!!

I made this recipe for a dinner party and it was absolutely fabulous.  I roasted the squash, and used real butter and chicken stock. I also added a few tablespoons of dry sherry and zested some fresh ginger - both added a some really great flavors to the dish. I suggest cutting the cream cheese in half as some other reviewers have stated.

I have tried this recipe and others probably experienced that peel and cutting a butternut squash is a pain unless u have a very very sharp knife I found it easier to pierce the squash and place it in the over at 400 degrees until it can be pierced with a fork smoothly then I let it cool and cutting it is a breeze and all you have to do is peel the tought skin off.

I had never made butternut squash soup before and I used this recipe as a starting point. I ended up making many alterations though, and I think they were definitely worth mention:

- roasted the squash for 45 minutes, cut side up, with a light brushing of olive oil
- used 1/2 a red onion, sauteed in *butter* then added 1/2 t marjoram, 1/4 t black pepper, 1/4 t cayenne, pinch of fresh ground nutmeg, and pinch of cinnamon, as well as four sage leaves
- chopped up a honey crisp apple and added that with 3 c water + 2 T chicken stock
- simmered this while the squash roasted
- added squash when it was finished and simmered for maybe 15 minutes longer (take out sage leaves before pureeing)
- pureed everything in a blender with only 8 oz cream cheese instead of 16 oz
- left on heat for 15 minutes longer to marry the flavors
- served with a dollop of cream cheese

My boyfriend is a professional cook and he declared this to be the best butternut squash soup he's ever had! He even bragged about it to his coworkers the next day. The added cayenne gave it a bit more kick, which we really loved, and the apple added another layer of flavor.

With over 300 reviews and a 5 star rating, this recipe does not really need my review too...but, everyone who has ever tasted this LOVES it.  I've been making it for over three years now and have passed the recipe on to many of my friends and family.  The only change I made was to cut the cream cheese down to one package.
Tip: microwave the squash for three minutes to make it easier to peel.

This is a huge hit with my family both at TG and Christmas. I peel, core and cube my squash, toss it in EVOO, sprinkle with salt and roast about 45 minutes in 350 for a deeper flavor. I chop a large Vidalia onion and mince up 4 cloves garlic and saute in EVOO. Add 4 to 5 cups veg stock (Instead of water) and leave the spices the same. I add in my squash + a peeled and chopped honey crisp apple and bring to a boil for a minute or two. I omit the cream cheese altogether. Blend in small batches and be sure to always cover top of blender with hand towel to prevent getting burned. I pour from blender to crock pot for parties. I've made this soup 3 days in advance and it only gets better. I also use it as a sauce over cheese ravioli and it's AMAZING! I'm a vegetarian and just love good recipes that don't call for artificial ingredients.

The "TASTE" of this soup is 5 STARS but I found it WAY too thick to give it an overall 5 stars. I made the soup for a 2nd time today and am extremely pleased with the results!  I used 5 cups of chicken stock in place of the 3 cups of water and boullion cubes and also added 1 clove minced garlic along with the squash. I omitted the cream cheese all together this time & don't miss it a single bit. The soup still has an incredibly rich, creamy flavour without all that extra fat and calories. The flavour of the squash shines a bit more this way too.  Would definitely make my altered version again.

I LOVE THIS SOUP! I gave 4 stars only because I've altered the recipe so much on the recommendation of the reviews here. 

I cut the squash in half and roast in (rub the cut side with olive oil, salt, pepper and a crushed garlic clove or 2, roasting the cloves right along with the squash) at 350 F for 40 minutes. While it's cooling, saute the onion. Then puree everything in batches in the blender. 

Also, I substituted a third cup light cream for all the cream cheese, and after having it both ways, I prefer the light cream. ENJOY!

This soup is easy and so delicious! I make this once a year and we freeze it to eat it all year long. Very filling. You'll need about a 2 1/2 - 3lb squash for 6 cups.

AWESOME. I substitute plain fat free yogurt instead of the cream cheese and use cooking spray instead of margarine when sauteeing onions and this is still fabulous plus it falls into the WW Core Plan if you're dieting. I love it and could eat it every day.

We loved this soup!!! My boyfriend requested that I make it every night, and then threatened to run to the grocery store to get another squash!! I used the microwave trick and scooped out the squash with my ice cream scooper. I did only use 1 thing of cream cheese and lots of salt and it turned out great!! As for blending, I made the mistake a long time ago of not letting it cool long enough - splattered boiling soup all over myself! Pour a batch in the blender and the rest in a large bowl (I use my quart sized measuring cup) until heat isn't actively rising from either bowls (It won't create a pressure when you have the lid of the blender on). Start the blender off at the slowest speed and work your way up to puree, while keeping a towel over the top.

I am going to try it this weekend.  Just rated it 5 because I'm so sick of people tweaking the recipe and adding what they did.  I don't care what you did.  If you like yours better - add your own recipe.  It's rare to find a recipe on here that somebody hasn't rewritten.  Would be nice to rate the actual recipe only.  Then have a separate page for tweakers.

This was exquisite. I oven-roasted all of the vegetables together with a couple of cloves of garlic and an apple, then put them in the food processor and into a sauce pan to simmer. I used only a dollop of cream cheese, but the soup was still very rich. To finish, I toasted some pumpkin seeds with a bit of roasted garlic and olive oil and sprinkled them over the bowls of soup, then drizzled over a bit of boiled apple cider mixed with water. One of the best recipes I have tried from Allrecipes!

This is fantastic. I cook the squash in the microwave first. Just split it, remove the seeds and cook cut side down in a half inch of water for about 15 minutes. Then it just has to be scraped out of the shell. Much easier than peeling and cutting up. I also think this is great without the cream cheese if you want to cut down on some calories.

The recipe for this soup intrigued me when I first read it but the reviews convinced me that perhaps I needed to give this soup recipe a shot.  I have made this soup twice now and, in my opinion, it is absolutely delicious.  Everyone must try this recipe atleast a few times and I guarantee, you won't give it up.  Good recommendations were made to use chicken stock and 1/2 the cream cheese listed in the original recipe.  My soup ended up very rich and thick so I thinned it out a bit with low-fat milk.  Then, it was absolutely perfect.  I also froze a portion of it and used it another time - it was just as good if not better.  You will truly enjoy this soup, especially on a cold, winter day.  Please try it!

Heavenly.  I used 1/2 the amount of cream cheese as recommended in other ratings & was still rich and creamy.  My 11 month old couldn't get enough of it!!!

I think I just found a piece of heaven in the form of soup!  So easy and so delicious!  I used butter instead of margarine and add a bit of garlicwhile frying the onions.  I used chicken broth in place of water and bouillon and I omitted cayenne pepper as well.  I only used about 1/4 of the cream cheeseas I found it just perfect without it.

This has been my go-to comfort soup ever since I discovered it this past fall trying to find ideas to use the squash that I received in my CSA share!

A couple of tips: 1)Only 1 bar of cream cheese & go for the reduced fat version (neufchatel cheese) to cut calories out... you will not taste a difference! 2) Definitely bake the squash at 350 deg for at least 45 min with a drizzle of olive oil, salt, pepper and lil bit of crushed garlic.. you will taste a slight raw squash after-taste if you don't since I've tried it both ways. 3) I like to add slightly more cayenne pepper (1/2 tsp total for a kick) and reduce the chicken boullion cubes to 2. 4) Costco sells the butternut squash already skinned and pre-cut in a 2 lb package for $5 (which is all this recipe needs). Slightly more costly, but saves a TON of time prepping. 

Enjoy :)

I used only have the cream cheese (8oz) and I had no marjoram so I substituted Italian seasoning (oregano and thyme) and it turned out great.  A nice kick from the cayenne counteracts the sweetness of the squash and the cream cheese makes it nice and thick.

Awesome soup, thanks Mary. Second time I made this soup I added an additional cup of stock and also added 2 potatoes and recuced cream cheese to 1 package - was excellent. As others have recommended I also pre-roasted the squash for 40 minutes at 350. I will make this again!

I've made this several times and it always comes out wonderfully. It's very forgiving to little adjustments per your taste. I've tried roasting the squash, scooping it out, and burning my fingers (since I'm too impatient to wait for it to cool) and I've peeled it, bruising my knuckles on the cutting board a few times, and honestly, either way, it tastes just great, so whichever seems easier for you. I like the addition of nutmeg to the spices and I definitely use broth (chicken or vegetable). It also works well with the addition of other squash like Delicata, Kabocha, Carnival, etc. Enjoy!

This is an excellect soup!  I follow the recipe to the letter and it comes out perfect every time.  The only improvement I've made is that I blend the cream cheese right in the pot.  I cut it into cubes, dump it in the pot with the cooked squash and puree with my stick blender.  Much easier than trying to pour hot soup into a standard mixer.

Hey folks this is SO easy to make if you don't cube and peel the squash first. Just cut a half inch hole in the squash (to avoid explosions) and microwave it whole until tender when poked with a fork, about 15 minutes. Turn a few times during nuking. Then just cut it in half, scoop out the seeds, and scoop out the cooked squash from the peel. VERY easy!
I halved the recipe, and used onion powder and garlic powder and no marjoram, 1 T of butter and 3 oz cream cheese. I just dumped the cooked squash and other ingredients into a blender and it was done. Excellent, rich and tasty!

Absolutely awesome! The first time made it with a fresh squash from my friend's garden. The second time, used six cups of frozen butternut squash cubes (in the freezer section) and it tasted the same and took a quarter of the time! An absolute winner whether you choose the long road or the short road.

I actually made this for my kids since my youngest (8 mos) is transitioning from baby food to table food.  I made as directed but omitted the spices.  They enjoyed it, but it's really heavy on the cream cheese.  I wish I had read some of the other suggestions prior to making, because this soup is very rich.  I felt full after tasting it!

I made a few changes that several people mentioned: I roasted the squash for 45 minutes on 350 before adding it to the soup, I added 1 cup of apple cider, and I used only half of the cream cheese. The result was a rich, elegant, satisfying soup that got rave reviews from our fifteen holiday guests.  The only thing I'll do different next time is to make it early, because it's gotten even better over the last three days.

Fall Yummies! I made this soup yesterday.  I had two good sized butternut squash.  I used another reviewer's suggestion and halved them lengthwise and roasted them cut side down on a large cookie sheet in the oven for 45 minutes at 350.  This was perfect for scooping out the pulp.  I sauteed the onion in olive oil and a little butter.  I added 3 cloves of roasted garlic to that. Another reviewer used chicken stock/broth in place of the water. I did this also and it lent a richer flavor. I used about 4 cups of broth because I had more than six cups of squash and the soup was still very thick and hearty. I used only 3 boullion cubes.  I took the advise of several other reviewers and used only one 8oz. pkg. of cream cheese and I'm glad I did this because it would have seemed more like a cheese dip with another block of cream cheese in there.  I also added a couple of dashes of curry powder and that along with the cayenne gave this soup a robust flavor.  This was perfect for a fall afternoon pre/dinner appetizer. This is being added to my recipe box for sure.

My husband rushed in from work after being attacked by a tenant's dog, sitting for an hour in traffic and getting sideswiped by someone who took off before my husband could get his license plate number.  The noise level in the house was unbelievable, as I had my neighbor's 4 kids over when she had an emergency.  My panicked husband still had to head out for another 2 appointments, and needed to find new pants as the dog had shredded the ones he was wearing.  Then I gave him this soup.  He stopped moving when he tasted it. He sat down. He actually smiled. He had three bowls. I fed it to the kids and for fifteen minutes there were no sounds but spoons clanking and lots of slurping. This is going in my cookbook as 5-Minute Magic Opium Soup. It's that good. Oh, also, I used frozen cubed squash and only about 4 oz cream cheese, powder consomme instead of bouillon, and used an immersion blender.  Tasted like magic and took about 5 minutes to prepare.

I liked this recipe but I thought that it tasted better before the cream cheese and I only used 1 package. I also roasted the squash in the oven first and I processed the squash with its skin which tasted fine to me. I added a sweet potato for fun it made the recipe sweeter!

This always get rave reviews.  Here is how I have chaned the recipe based on trial and error as well as other recommendations:  Cut in 1/2, remove seeds and spray with EVOO. Roast Squash in oven before pealing at 375 for 45 min. OR microwave 1/2 at a time meat side down for 8-10 min.  sub butter for margerine; sub parsley for marjoram; sub all spice for cayenne; add garlic; reduce cream cheese by 1/2; use inverted blender stick.

MADE ADJUSTMENTS! This is a five for sure, although I'd probably make some adjustments to cut the fat if this was going to be in the regular rotation.   If just making a couple times a year, it's perfect like this....  Bake the squash at 350-375 for 40 minutes or so, just till it is easy to scoop from skin. Do the onions with butter of course, I will use only 2 tbsp next time. I doubled the spices and halved the cream cheese. I simmered the onion, water, chicken cubes, and spices for 15 minutes, then added the already baked squash for 5-7 minutes to get the flavors together. Then blended with cc.  Excellent.  Would be a wonderful cup of heavy soup for an appetizer (small cup as it is THICK)

I made a few minor changes to this recipe and have made it for several occasions. Everyone always wants the recipe. I cut my squash into halves, drizzled with olive oil, and roasted on 375 for 40 minutes before moving on with the recipe. I used 4 cups chicken broth in place of the water/bouillon, a combination of cumin and oregano in place of the marjoram, and only 1 8oz block of reduced fat cream cheese. This soup is hearty enough to be served with some good chunky bread as a meal all on its own.

This is an incredibly rich tasting soup.  Wonderful, interesting flavour with the cream cheese.  I only used 1/2 of an 8 oz. block of cream cheese and will try 1/4 or 1/3 next time as I still found it too rich for me.  I also cut the 
butternut squash in half lengthwise and roasted it at 375 F for 45 min. so that I wouldn't have to go through the trouble of peeling and chopping raw butternut squash.

This was a huge hit for our family from our 5 year old to my husband.  I did make some changes after reading reviews.  I used about 4 cups of Chicken Broth instead of the boullion and water.  I also diced up 6 small red potatoes and boiled in the broth.  I used 2 butternut squashed, halved them sprayed with olive oil then roasted upside down with a clove of garlic under each half for 30 minutes at 400 degrees.  I added the roasted squash to the broth and boiled just until everything was tender.  I also used Neufchatel instead of regular cream cheese.  I will make this again and again.

I LOVE THIS SOUP!!!  I have made this now four times in the last two months.  The reason I only gave it 4 stars is because I did make a few changes.  As another reviewer suggested I have been adding 1-2 apples (depending on size) & 1 cup apple cider.  Also, the cream cheese is not at all necessary for either taste or texture.  I've never submitted a review before but I just made my fourth batch tonight and discovered something that I had to share:  USE CHICKEN BROTH INSTEAD OF BOUILLON!  I've been using broth just because I had so much on hand but decided I'd try it with bouillon tonight and it just is not the same.  I even ended up adding the cream cheese this time in an attempt to improve the flavor.  Broth is definitely the way to go!

I made this froze it. Pulled it out as a 1st course for my inlaws & got rave reviews! Added sour cream as a pretting squiggly topping (put sour cream in a baggie & cut a corner to pipe out in a swirle on top of soup). AMAZINGLY good. Restaurant quality.

I found 4 boullion cubes was too much.  It was very salty.   Next time I would start with 2 and then maybe a 3rd.  Also should have taken advice of person who only used 1 cream cheese.  Too much cream cheese takes away the flavor of the squash.  I also baked the squash ahead of time as one person suggested which was a great idea.  375 for 45 minutes was perfect.

Thank you Mary!  This was the most wonderful soup I've ever made!  I used the prepared chicken broth, which cut down on preparation.  I also wanted to cut down on the fat, so I used about 3 oz of cream cheese, and 1½ cups of low fat cream. I think next time I'll even leave the cream cheese out altogether.  The flavour was outstanding and the texture was perfect.  My 2 yr old even loved it.  This will definitely be a recipe that my family will continue seeing at the dinner table in the years to come.

I made this the first time following the recipe to a tee. This time, I too tweaked it. I roasted the squash, but differently from other reviews that I have read. I cut off the top and bottom, sliced it lengthwise, scooped out the seeds, sprinkled with sea salt, ground pepper and dotted with butter. Then I put the squash in a baking dish, cut side up, put 1/4 inch of water into the dish, covered loosely with foil, and cooked for 45 minutes in a preheated 325 degree oven. When done, I kept whatever butter melted and put it in the stock. I added garlic powder to the onions, doubled the cayenne pepper and used half of the cream cheese. My hubby just told me that he thinks this is very delicious. It has a rustic flavor instead of an overly sweet, rich taste.

This recipe is all about comfort. I cut my squash in half length wise, coated it in olive oil, salt and pepper and roasted cut side down on baking sheet at 375 for 45 minutes for a small one and added 15 minutes longer for a large squash. Let cool until easy to handle then scoop out flesh (trying not eat much). I used canned chicken broth. I increased the cayenne to 1/4 tsp and it leaves a nice little after heat. Bring everything up to a simmer then add squash. I used a stick blender to puree soup and when smooth as I wanted it I added 4 oz. room temperature cream cheese cut into cubes. Bring soup back up to simmer then serve. The small amount of cream cheese adds thickness and creaminess without being identifiable. Left overs will have to be thinned as the soup thickens as it cools. Great recipe.

This soup was great. It was my first time cooking with butternut squash. I roasted it prior to adding it to the soup for a bit more flavour. In the end, it was super thick and I had to add LOTS of milk to thin it out. This may because I never measure anything and likely had too much squash (consequently I also added way too much cayenne - opps!). I also didn't have enough cream cheese (i.e. only half), but it still tasted great. I will make this again.

Fantastic! I made this for Thanksgiving and people were practically licking their bowls - even the one who claims to hate squash. I also roasted the squash and used 1 pkg of neufchatel cream cheese.

The absolutely best soup my family and I have ever had!!!  We had friends for dinner, and I sent home, reluctantly, the bottom of the pot of soup with them.  Will make it time and again.  I also used half the cream cheese (lite).  As far as peeling the squash, I found peeled and cubed squash at the local grocery store and (although a little more expensive), used it instead!

This soup was very delicious loved the smooth texture and the rich taste. My family enjoyed it also. I did not however, enjoy the preparation of cutting the butternut squash it proved to be very difficult this would have been the perfect recipes if suggestions for cut and peal were mentioned.

Didn't change anything and loved this creamy creation.  Yes it is a pain to peel the squash but so worth the effort.  I garnished with fresh chives, bacon and sour cream.  I made a double batch.  Gave 2 containers to a friend, 2 containers went into the freezer and we ate the remaining soup.  (I got 10 cups of veggies from one squash and got 13 cups from a bigger squash so I froze the remaining 6 packages of unused squash for later.)  Thank you!

This soup is very good, but I did make a few changes. Like many other reviewers, I roasted the butternut squash in the oven instead, and blended in just one 8 oz package of reduced fat cream cheese and the soup was plenty creamy.  I also minced two cloves of garlic and about a tsp of fresh ginger to give the soup a little extra kick.

I found the cream cheese really took away from the butternut squash flavour (and I cut the amount in half). Perhaps with less cream cheese (or no cream cheese) this might be a keeper.

SO GOOD! I used this recipe for my first time ever making butternut squash soup and it was great!  At the suggestion of a friend I baked the squash in a 400 degree oven for about 45 minutes to make them easier to peel and cut. I also used chicken stock instead of water and chicken bullion. It was so good, I had 3 friends ask for the recipe!

This is amazing! By the way 2 butternut squashes equals around 12 cups (oops!) so I had to double the recipe, however, I kept the same amount of cream cheese (2 pkgs). I baked the squash at 375F for 45 minutes, next time I'll bake it a little less because they were a pain in the butt to peel! Also, I used homemade chicken stock and butter. However, this was SO much work because I didn't have an immersion blender.. I had to throw it in the food processor in batches and it got really, really messy. So beware. Other than that, this is definitely a keeper and I'll definitely make it for company some time.

This soup was so yummy!  When I had planned to make this for dinner my husband told me that he does not like squash, so I told him he could heat up leftovers from the previous night.  He decided that he would eat the soup and he loved it!  The cream cheese is the key ingredient.  I used reduced fat and only one package...very creamy and thick.  I did not have marjoram, so my husband looked up on the internet and found oregano as a substitution.  Looking forward to eating for lunch tomorrow!

Absolutely delicious! I got rave reviews. The spices in the recipe are just right. It was very rich with just one package of cream cheese as others have suggested, and roasting the squash was definitely the right way to go. It's a pretty time consuming recipe, but worth every second. I also added a small dollop of sour cream and a sprinkle of paprika on the top of each bowl, for flavor and presentation. I'll be making this soup for years to come.

Wonderful recipe, went over huge w/my guests. Here's my little changes... Used chicken broth instead of water and broth cubes, cooked squash in oven in about an inch of water/cut in half for about 30 min. first. Added a bit of garlic and tiny amount of ginger for zip to the onions. And only used 1/2 of the cream cheese. Served with a dallop of sour cream and a couple dashes of tobasco. YUM!!!

Again, I don't know if it's truly fair to rate this 5 stars when I adjust the recipe per other people's comments (love that aspect on this website!), but I absolutely love this soup! I roast the squash prior to cubing it (split in half, remove seeds, spray cut face w/ non-stick spray and lay face down on cookie sheet, roast in 375 degree oven for about 45 minutes-- makes peeling and cutting so much easier, plus it brings out the flavor of the squash). I also OMIT THE CHEESE altogether (made it both ways and decided I liked it better w/out it). Very tasty and great for those fall afternoons!

I did not care for this soup at all.  I followed the directions exactly except for using half the cream cheese, as other users had suggested.  I did not like the texture or the taste.  Won't make it again.

This is the best butternut squash soup I have ever had--perfect for Thanksgiving, or any chilly Fall night!  Rich, creamy & relatively easy to make.  I roasted the squash, and actually used the meat from 1 1/2 squash in the soup.  Based on the reviews I read I used only 8 ounces of light cream cheese (neufchatel) and it was still sinful!  I also substituted chicken broth, oregano & red pepper flakes, for the bouillion, marjoram and cayenne, respectively, and it is incredible.  Impressive for guests.  Beautiful color--I garnished with finely minced red pepper and flat leaf parsley flakes, and it was gorgeous!  I'm so grateful I have leftovers!

This soup was delicious.  Like many others, I also only used half 
of the cream cheese.  I also used butter (1 1/2 tablespoons), instead 
of the margarine. Instead of using a food processor to puree it, I just
added the cream cheese to the pot, and blended it with my hand blender.
It worked perfectly.

This soup was excellent.  I modified it a little since I only had frozen squash and cut the recipe in half and used 4 T. cream instead of cream cheese and substituted marjoram for a 1/4 t. pumpkin pie spice. Very quick, no pureeing needed.

I always use this as a base recipe, turns out fantastic every time!  In addition to kick it up a little, I add:
1/2 tsp cinnamon
1/2 tsp nutmeg
1/2 tsp ginger
1/4 tsp all spice
1/4 c maple syrup
Then I substitute a large apple for the onion.  Only because I don't like onions.

We made this recipe after visiting our local farmers market and acquiring a nice butternut squash. Delicious!! The only changes we made were reducing the cream cheese to one 8 ounce package, and using butter and chicken stock. Thank you to the reviewer who noted that a two pound squash was the same as six cups of peeled and cubed squash. Also, our thanks to Mary -

Everyone raves about this soup when I make it.  I have found it difficult to cut up the squash  so I just cut it in half pop it in the oven until it is teneder enough to scoop out the flesh and then follow the recipe as is.

Should have stuck to the original recipe but tried the healthy version with apple cider as another reviewer suggested.  What a disaster that was!  Thanksgiving supper and the soup tasted like vinegar broth!  "1 c." is 1 cup right?... I only used a half a cup and it was embarassing to serve it to my guests who kindly said it wasn't that bad.  I don't understand why people just don't write their own recipe instead of making so many adjustments to the original.  Also, how can you rate a recipe when you changed it so much?  I will try this recipe again as is and give it a proper review/rating.

This soup was amazing! The only reason I only gave it 4 stars was because I did make some changes. I cut two squashes in half, drizzled with olive oil and rubbed with 8 cloves of minced garlic and sprinkled with salt. Baked in the oven at 350 for 50 minutes and scooped out the squash, added the cooked onion, water, bouillon, & spices and brought to a boil. I then added the cream cheese to make it easier to blend. Once that had melted I added everything to the blender in batches. I also used only 1 1/2 packages of cream cheese but I would only add one if I made this again.

Great recipe. The cayenne pepper adds a great kick. I like to toss in a few dried cranberries, walnuts and a sprinkle of fresh parsley to make it feel extra classy.

Tweaked a touch w/ a splash of Dry Sherry, dash of freshly grated nutmeg and 1/2 of the cream cheese.  Served in shot glasses w/ drizzle of balsamic vinegar (reduction) and creme fraiche as a "shooter" at a cocktail party.  It was a hit!

This was delicious - however I did reduce the cream cheese to 8 oz. and added an extra cup of broth. I have hesitated to make this soup because I find cutting up the squash to be very tedious, and baking it first makes double work. I like FAST. But I discovered Trader Joe's sells a bag of diced butternut squash for $4.99, hooray!! I will definitely make this again!

I make this every year at Christmas time. It comes in very handy when overnight guests are here and you don't need such a large meal. Ham sandwiches go great with this.

I love this recipe!  I tweaked it to make it low sodium:  Instead of bouillon and water, I added 3c low-sodium broth.  I added 1/2 tsp nutmeg, pinch of cinnamon, 1/2 tsp cayenne, and most importantly, replaced the cream cheese with just four ounces of a creamy chevre (I used Boucheron).  This gave the soup more flavor but brought the sodium content down to about 600 mg sodium for the entire dish, and less than 100mg of sodium per serving!  My husband had thirds!  Delicious.

Delicious.  I did bake the squash in the oven and I had to use a little Oregeno instead of Marjoram (I was out).  My suggestion is to use a stick blender (they are totally worth it) to blend everything together.  That way you don't have to pour hot soup into or out of anything other than your bowl.

Wow, this soup was AMAZING. We roasted the squash first (cut in half, open side down on a cookie sheet, 45 min at 375), only used half the cream cheese, real butter, and also added some asparagus that needed to be used. It was a beautiful color and perfect consistency.

I sauteed the onions in margarine and white wine, then added them to the food processor with the squash and blended them also. It's best to roast the squash on a cookie sheet in the oven for 45 mins. at 375. I also added a little brown sugar in with the squash puree just for some extra flavor.

This soup is awesome.  I usually add a couple of pears or apples and some ginger, and cut way back on the cream cheese (1/4 to 1/2 what the recipe states).  If I'm out of cream cheese, I just add milk instead.  It freezes well, too, just add the cream cheese or milk after reheating.  For an easy garnish, you can toast the cleaned squash seeds in a 350 degree oven with 1 tbsp of olive oil and some salt and cinnamon until they start to brown.

I couldn't figure out why all the recipes for butternut squash soup on here instructed to just chop the squash and boil while EVERY review said to roast first! I did both, doing the other steps exactly the same... the roasted squash soup is REMARKABLY better! More flavor, better flavor. Not roasting it first makes it an 'ok' but rather bland bowl of pureed orange mush. Roast your squash people!

I give this 5 stars, but only with how I tweaked it.  To make it less labor intensive, I microwaved the squash (after piercing it with a fork) for 10 minutes, turning every couple of minutes.  This softened the skin to make it easier to use a knife to peel off the skin.  I could have halved it, microwaved it longer, and scooped out the insides instead since this is how I "roast" butternut squash, but I didn't think about that until I was halfway done with cutting it in chunks.  I used one whole small onion and 4 small cloves of garlic (my husband loves garlic and onion), sauteed them and then I added a dash or two of each (ground):  sage, ginger, nutmeg, coriander, celery seed, and cloves.  Then followed the rest of the recipe.  I also used only 1 package of Neufchatel.  Mine turned out creamier than any other butternut squash soup I've ever tasted.  I never understood why people blame the texture of their creations on the lack of fat in neufchatel since its essentially the same as full fat cream cheese.  I've never had that problem (even with my award-winning cheesecake).   If you want a thicker soup, reserve about a cup of the cooking liquid while you're pureeing the chunks of squash with the cream cheese.  That way, you can judge how thick its going to turn out.  I ended up pureeing and adding the rest of the liquid in the end.  If it didn't turn out creamy enough, you need to either cook the squash longer or puree it longer.  This would make a great sauce on cheese raviol

Yum!!!  This was sooooo good!  I did do a few things different as many other reviewers suggested.  I roasted the squash at 375 degrees with olive oil brushed on each half until soft (about an hour).  I carmelized the onion in olive oil.  Then pureed it with the squash and cream cheese.  I didn't have marjoram so left it out.  I did use a little curry powder and used only 1/2 block of cream cheese (4 oz).  I'll make this again and again!

I read through many other reviews of the recipe and decided to go with just one pack of cream cheese. however when I finally got to the recipe after a long day of cooking, I realized I only had 5 ounces of cream cheese and it was plenty and probably the bare minimum needed. I used veggie broth from a carton instead of chicken stock or bullion cubes. Also- it took some head scratching to figure this one out- 6 cups is roughly 2 pounds - which is roughly two small sized squashed. It was a great hit and really nice that it was so easy! and oh yeah- I didn't even use butter, used olive oil out of habit and didn't even notice the difference.

YUMMY.  Like so many others, I tweaked this recipe quite a bit.  Because of time limitations, I baked the squash in a pan of 1 inch of water, skin side up - yesterday.  I also added 1 large sweet potato that I cooked in advance as well.  Today I melted the butter added the onion - 1 whole - and besides adding the marjoram, I added about 2 teaspoons of curry powder.  I only used about 3/4 of a package (6 oz.) of cream cheese. Which gave it a rich, but not overpowering taste.  It needed a little salt, and is so incredibly tasty.  I was making it in advance for a party but I like it so much I know I'm going to have to make another batch.

this is really fabulous! I halved the cream cheese, which was plenty. The only addition i made was a little white wine before blending the hot soup. It "lifts" the flavors a bit, i thought. Also, the 6 cups of squash turned out to be 3 pounds almost exactly after i roasted and cubed it. We will be adding this to our Thanksgiving menu.

This recipe was very good, i just changed a couple of things. I added both ginger and nutmeg in addition to the other spices.I used Oregeno instead of majoram.I used 3 sliced cloves of garlic and instead of the cubes and water i used 3 small cans of chicken stock. I did not use any cream cheese, instead i used 1/4 cup of skim milk. Great healthy recipe!!

I didn't even know I liked butternut squash!  Roasting the squash first is a bit better.  I used some extra seasonings that I picked up from another recipe: 1/2 t. curry powder, 1/4 t. each of celery salt and nutmeg, and a little more than a table spoon of brown sugar.  I also used only one cream cheese.  This is SO good!  I'll be growing butternuts again next year for sure!

This is one of my favorite soups to make. I used REAL BUTTER, instead of the margarine. I also as other reviewers have stated used less Cream Cheese. I use about   a little less than 8 ounces. This is a thick and hearty soup. I also added some milk to thin it a bit. My 13 yr.old daughter who said Yuck (at first) decided this was good. I didn't put any marjoram in the soup either.
Update on this review  Still good soup!!! BUT I was short on time so when I was at Trader Joe's they had cubed squash. Sometimes it is Butternut and sometimes it is Acorn. This is a HUGE time saver for me and the soupd comes out wonderful. I even have cut down the Cream Cheese even further. I use the Veg/Chicken stock combo and it is flavorful!!! :)

I used vegetable bouillon to keep it vegetarian. I added a litlle too much cayenne and it tasted funny. Next time I will use more broth to make it thinner because it was very thick.

This was great.  I baked the squash instead of cutting it into cubes first, didn't saute the onions (so didn't use the butter), and only used half the cream cheese - that cut about 120 grams of fat from the recipe.  I also threw a couple of cloves of garlic into the puree.

Yes, as others have said this soup is scrumptuous!  Like others, I modified it, but only slightly.  This is soup is so good, it would be hard to mess it up.  My modification was a) use only half the cream cheese.  I really think it would be too rich to use 16oz.  b) I added some fresh sauteed red pepper.  I think the red pepper was a delicious addition; I'll use even more red pepper next time I make it.  Incidentally, butternut squash makes terrific "pumpkin" bread, too.  Search for recipes!

Disappointing!  You have to like thick, creamy soups that have the consistency of baby food to really enjoy this soup.  I did not like it at all, and I thought that the cream cheese (even though I put half of what the recipe called for) made the soup too creamy.  I had to throw it out!

I used 1/2 of the cream cheese and added 1/4 tsp nutmeg.  For my husband's sake I added 3 chicken breasts to cook with the squash.  I took the chicken out before putting the soup in the blender and then added chunks of chicken to the blended finale. OH MY GOSH!!!  It was FANTASTIC!!!  I was licking the bowl!  The nutmeg gave it a sweet Christmas-y taste and the cayenne peper gave it just the right kick.

This was excellent!  I added about a 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg and left out the cayenne pepper.  My whole family loved it (including my 2-year-old).  Very easy.  You can roast the squash in the oven first or cut into smaller pieces and put it in the microwave for about 5 minutes to make it easier to peel and cube.

Outstanding. My inlaws rave about this soup - and I make it just for myself. The only hard part is cutting up the squash (I peel it first too); after that it's very easy. And soooo delicious. I've always made it with just the 8 oz. cream cheese, and it would still be delicious with less.

Delicious!  And not only that, but it is SO easy, as well.  I took previous reviewers advice and baked the squash for about an hour beforehand.  I also only used one 8 oz. package of cream cheese and it was plenty. I also salted it to taste, which ended up being about 1/2 - 1 teaspoon.  I was surprised salt isn't in the original recipe, as it truly enhances the flavor.  I will most definitely be making this again and again.  And again!

I have made this recipe several times to bring to harvest parties...everyone loves it!  Like other people I have cut the cream cheese in half ( using only one block). I also roast the squash in the oven with a little bit of olive oil and I use butter instead of margarine.  Otherwise, the original recipe stays the same!  Thanks for a super easy, wonderful tasting soup!

Really Good!! Roasted the squash in the oven on 350 for about an hour. Added 3 pears. Tasted it without the cream cheese and it felt like it was missing something. Added 1 block as suggested by other reviewers and the flavor was delicious! I will definitely add this to my soup collection during the fall/winter. Thanks.

My favorite all season soup! I use a potato peeler on the squash and then cut into pieces. After browning the onions, and adding a little fresh garlic (our preference), I add the chicken bouillon broth , the squash chunks and the seasoning and cook a little before transferring to a crockpot, when the soup is cooked, I add the cream cheese, adjusting to the size of the squash soup, heat up and serve. This soup is great reheated too.

Just made this soup because I had some butternut squash from my CSA this week......it has to be the BEST butternut squash soup I've ever had and i've had a lot!!!!  Will no longer make it any other way.....I did use only one 8 oz. pkg. of cream cheese and herbes de provence instead of marjoram because that's what I had.....excellent.....try it!

Freshly grated NUTMEG is a very tasty addition to this delicious soup. Wow.....what a great recipe. 

For an EASY WAY TO CUT THE BUTTERNUT SQUASH: microwave the squash for 2-3 minutes. That softens it.

 After that, cut off each end and set upright and peel downward. Cut it in half. Cube the top 1/2, then scoop out the bottom 1/2 and cube it.

I cut the recipe in 1/2, making 3 servings.

Very rich and delicious! I followed the recipe but to save on some calories I halved the butter and cream cheese. I think you could almost quarter the cream cheese and have an excellent soup... maybe even taste more of the squash. I was surprised how filling it was being a bisque, a coffee cup full filled me up more than enough.

This 5-star rating is more for the rejuvenated recipe I created, of course using advice from a ton of other reviewers. I used the same ingredients as this one, except I cut out all but 1/4 of the cream cheese and used 2 cans of chicken broth instead of bouillon.  Other additions included 2 peeled and diced summer zucchini (if you don't have enough BNS), a celery stalk (diced), one granny smith apple (cubed and peeled), nutmeg and about 1 tbsp of light whipping cream. To prepare it, I roasted the butternut squash in the oven for 1 hr at 400 F with salt, ground black pepper, and crushed garlic on top. Once it was done, I sauteed the onions, celery, apples and zucchini for 10 minutes.  After that I added the butternut squash and let it cook in the pan for a few minutes too, since it wasn't completely cooked in the oven. Then I poured in the chicken broth, marjoram, cayenne pepper and nutmeg. I let that all come to a boil and simmer for about 20 minutes.  Finally, I added the cream cheese and whipping cream and blended it up. So delicious, my new favorite dish!

Used one package of reduced fat cream cheese...  didn't have any onions or butter!  YEEKS!  Used ideas of other reviews of roasting the squash at 375 for 45 min...  Used dried minced onions and used poultry gravy mix...  (I know I need to go to the store!lol)  This was SOOOO good!  Oh my!

OUTSTANDING! Tip - Definitely use only 1 package of cream cheese as others suggested. I made it exactly according to the recipe, except for that one adjustment, and family and friends could not get enough of it! I could eat this stuff daily.

My husband HATES all squash. I made this for him and he LOVED it, that fact only desveres 5 stars, I made it with 1/3 reduced fat cream cheese and next time I am goignto try Fat free just to see if we can make it healthier without losing any of this awesome flavor. I am also going to roast the squash, I just love the roasted veggie taste it really adds alot to dishes. But all in all it is great without any changes! TY Mary!

As other reviewers have suggested, I only used 1 package of cream cheese.  I found it interesting that the soup smelled savory, but actually tasted quite sweet (with a little spicy kick!)  Not something I'd do frequently, especially since the kids didn't care for it, but my husband loved it!

SO yummy.  I accidentally used cumin instead of cinnamon, realized my mistake and added some cinnamon before serving.  It was outstanding, so I think I will use the cumin again!  Sounds strange to me, but it totally worked!

I have yet to meet someone who DOESN'T want the recipe for this!  If you don't have butternut squash, pumpkin is equally fantastic.  I agree with others- 4 oz. of cream cheese is plenty- my husband loves Philly and even he said it was too rich to use the full amount!

Husband and 4 year old son love it!  I have also made this in the crock pot.  Let cook on low for 6-8 hours until squash is tender.  Puree with immersion blender.  Add cream cheese and let the hot soup soften it for 5 minutes.  Puree again with immersion blender to blend cream cheese.  I freeze leftovers in muffin tins for perfect individual serving sizes.  Freezes and reheats well.

This is great.  It get's requested by my children and husband.  I roast the squash first.  And I use 8 oz of cream cheese and 1 cup 1/2 &1/2.  Absolutely wonderful.  It's great with frozen squash too.

I've made this 3 times now, and this was the best versioin yet.  I use 1/2 the cream cheese called for, and I used 2 cans of broth (veggie and/or chicken depending on what I have on hand) and its fantastic.    Even my husband likes this and he hates squash.  The cream cheese and the cayenne pepper give it a good flavor!

Absolutely delicous.  This will become a new, but low fat comfort food for me.  It tastes much more caloric than it is.  Roasting the squash is a must as it gives a fuller flavor, and the skin peels off so easily!  As did many others I used real chicken broth, 4 cups, (organic & low sodium due to high blood pressure) and I think that also adds to the rich flavor.  I also doubled the cayenne pepper and used only 8 ounces low fat cream cheese.  Was glad to read reviews that this freezes well.

Amazing, awesome recipe.  By far the best Butternut Squash soup I've ever had.  Blows away so many gourmet restaurant soups as well.  I've made this soup for the past 4 years every Thanksgiving and always get rave reviews.  I used to get the whole butternut squash gourds at the supermarket and roast it in oven and cut and peel it like another reviewer suggested.  But now I pick up the pre-cut cubed butternut squash from Costco, way easier than peeling and cutting on my own.  Going to try roasting the cubes this year, think it does add to the overall flavor.  Two thumbs up, thanks so much for sharing this gem! :)

This was great! We cut the cream cheese in half and still found the soup plenty rich. We'll actually try cutting it back a little further next time.

This was not good at all. The flavor of the cream cheese, which I had cut down to just one block, was entirely too overwhelming.  It had a sickly sweet aftertaste. I will attempt to make this again without the cream cheese and without butter (I had used some butter to saute the onions).

This is absolutely the best butternut squash soup recipe, EVER.  I did modify this recipe just a tad.  As another viewer recommended roasting the squash with olive oil, salt, pepper and garlic for 1 hour @ 350.  This was absolutely the key in making this soup stand out from all the others.  I also only used one 8 oz package of cream cheese.  Once I added the 1st package I really didn't see the need for the second one.  I also ommitted the cayenne pepper, only because I don't like it, the garlic from roasting the squash gave this recipe the kick that it needed.    

I do not have a food processor so I used my hand held wand blender, worked perfectly.  I don't recommend using low fat or fat free cream cheese only because I think it will take away from the purpose of using it in the soup.  Sometimes a recipe needs that fat to make all the other flavors combine.  

If I could give this recipe more than 5 stars I would.  Hands down, just awesome!!!! I can't wait to share it with friends and family.

I was dubious as to what this would turn out like as it seems so simple.  But this was absolutely delicious.  I roasted the squash and only added half a block of cream cheese.

Giving a 4 star only because I did NOT use the cream cheese and though i'm sure it's rich and delicious, I wanted to keep it lower in fat.  I did roast the squash in the oven for 30 minutes at 375 degrees and it was then easy to peel the skin and add to my pot.  I added the chicken broth, seasonings/saute'd onions and 1 cup of half and half.  It still gave it a creamy texture and it was GREAT.  thank you!

My sister-in-law made butternut squash soup a few years ago for the holidays and I loved it so much I asked for the recipe.  She conveniently kept "forgetting" to give it to me so I searched on-line for recipes.  I tried a few over the years and there was always "something" missing - they all tasted good but not quite GREAT.  

She made it again last month and that time I noted the flavours.  I thought the missing ingredient was possibly some kind of cheese so when I found this recipe calling for cream cheese, I thought I'd give it a try.

BINGO, I'd found the missing ingredient!!

I basically combined my previous favourite recipe I'd found along with this one to come up with my final product.  I roasted the butternut squash; left out the marjoram (didn't have any); used only half the cream cheese; and added 1/2 head of garlic, a medium carrot and a stalk of celery for added depth of flavour.  I have to say, it turned out even better than hers!

This recipe was VERY good...however, I would give it 5 stars with the following revisions. I like my soup a little more on the sweet side. I added 1 Tbsp. of Nutmeg, a dash of ginger and about 1/2 cup of Apple Cidar. I also added about 1/4 cup of brown sugar. OMGoodness!!

I prepared this as a "soup de jour" for Thanksgiving, so I made it the day before and let the flavors "merry" together in the fridge overnight and warmed the next day!! Holy Cow this was awesome! My family gave rave reviews over this one!

I also only added 1 pkg. cream cheese and I roasted my butternut squash in the oven for approximately 50 minutes on 450.

If you want a really good, rustic, fall recipe...try this one! You won't regret it!!

Excellent.  I loved the addition of cayenne pepper (I used a scant 1/8 tsp., which was plenty).  I also used 2 butternut squashes (probably medium sized) to make the 6 cups.  I just used 1 block of cream cheese and that was plenty- I might even decrease it a bit next time.

So good, so good!  I did deviate on the preparation, but I used all the ingredients, except for the cayenne pepper (not my fave).  I only used 2 T of marjarine to saute the onions, roasted the squash with olive oil, and cut the cream cheese by four.  I only pureed half of the squash with the cream cheese and then mashed the other half with a potato masher.  I like to chew a little bit of something in my soup.  This was the best.  I had a pumpkin soup similar to this ten years ago and LOVED it.  I have been searching for the recipe ever since.  Now that I have this one, I will try it with pumpkin next.  Yummy, yummy!!

PS. When making this another time, I found out to NOT use fat free cream cheese.  DOES NOT blend well.

I microwaved the squash to cut down on the cooking time and only added one package of cream cheese and it was excellent.  My husband loathes onions so I left those out too.  I think two packages of cream cheese would be too overpowering.

The marjoram wasn't a hit at all - use freshly grated nutmeg and plenty of garlic! Leave out the cream cheese too...if you must have a creamier soup (not necessary in this case!) drizzle fresh cream in a swirl over the top of each bowl.

I've never made butternut squash soup before, but I took the advice of others and also cut the cream cheese down to 4 ounces, and used neufchatel instead to cut some additional fat. 

I roasted the squash -- cut in half lengthwise, sprayed the cut side with PAM and roasted it, cut side down, on a baking sheet at 375 degrees for 45 minutes. This cut the boiling time in half and I think added some great flavor. Next time, I might try adding an apple to blend with it -- this is a very forgiving recipe. Even my husband, a very picky eater who doesn't like "adventurous" foods loved this and asked for seconds!! Even better as leftovers. Definitely a keeper!

I sauteed the onions in olive oil, then used frozen, cubed butternut squash, liquid chicken bouillon and 1 tub of roasted red pepper cream cheese, which gave it a nice kick. It turned out great!

I made this soup tonight... I'm 35 weeks pregnant and was craving butternut squash soup! I changed the following: I baked the squash in the over for 30 min. first, then cubed and cooked it according to the recipe for 10 min. I also added a bit of powdered ginger and cut the cream cheese in 1/4. (I used 4 oz. total) I thought the outcome was terrrific!! I will definitely make this recipe again!

I have made this dish using all sorts of squash but butternut and pepper are the best!  I half the squash first, drizzle each with olive oil and rub coarse salt, freshly ground black pepper and minced garlic over each half.  Then I wrap each one in aluminum foil and bake at 350 for 30- 40 minutes (depending on size of squash).  I also half the amount of cream cheese.  Great for autumn picnics.  Loved by all!

This was fantastic!  I added a bit more pepper.  I like it spicy!  I also roasted the squash by cutting it in half and spraying it with garlic flavored PAM.  It took about 30 min on 350.  Thanks!

So rich and delicious, maybe it should be outlawed!  I cut back on the cream cheese, and it was still very rich.  I wish I had followed a suggestion below and roasted the squash first for easy handling....not only is it difficult to peel, but it's like trying to chop wood.  Still, a great recipe!

My husband loved it(and he normally doesn't like soup) but I, a soup lover, did not love it.  It was a little rich and too smooth for my taste.  I would prefer something else in there for more texture and zing.  Just personal preference.

I didn't have cream cheese on hand so I used 4 cups of half and half.  It was delicious!  Next time I will try only 2 cups because of the fat content.  I also added about a teaspoon of garlic to the onion mixture (because I'm a garlic nut) and I used 1 Tbsp of butter instead of 4 Tbsp of margarine.

Fantastic!
Whips up great, if possible use chicken broth or stock instead of bouillon cubes. 
It's very thick, I made mine the night before, and the warmed it up on the stove the next night.  I garnished with fresh parsley and paprika. 
A big hit..

A couple of variations that I did with this recipe:
It takes a little longer, but the night before I cooked the soup, I roasted the squash in the oven until they are soft.  This makes it easier to get the "meat" out when you're ready to make the soup and it gives the soup a fabulous nutty roasted flavor.
Also, instead of adding cream cheese, I added heavy cream, it makes the soup much lighter, and If you have family members that are slightly lactose intolerant, they can usually handle the heavy cream over the cream cheese (or add Lactaid, which works very well).
But this soup recipe was very easy to make and very delicious. It is my new favorite soup.  Thank you for submitting it!

This is just plain fantastic. To address complaints of grittiness, I don't know if I read it here or elsewhere online, but I'd recently learned it can have something to do with the age of the squash. I myself have made this three times now, and one attempt was perfectly smooth with almost no texture outside of smooth and creamy. The other two did have a bit of grittiness. I couldn't figure out for the life of me what was different, so I researched and learned the younger the squash, the more tender. (No different than zucchini.) So they're more likely to blend down smoother.

Either way the flavor is PHENOMENAL. I've also used this as a base for a pasta sauce with chicken apple sausage, with great success. So happy to have found this!

This soup was delicious.  I chopped each butternut squash into large chunks, coated with a little bit of olive oil and seasoned with salt and pepper.  Roasted at 375F for about 1.5 hours until the squash had caramelized and became very soft.  The squash was so sweet and almost buttery when it came out of the oven - so good!  Sauteed the onion and 1/2 of a cortland apple and then added that, the butternut squash and the stock to the blender in batches and pureed until smooth.  Heated it gently in the stock pot with 4 ounces of neufetchel (1/3 less fat) cream cheese.  Added a little more cayenne than the recipe called for and adjusted salt & pepper to taste.  

Some things I may try when reheating leftovers: 
Add just a dash of nutmeg and/or cinnamon.  
Adding just a bit of very finely minced fresh sage from the garden.  
Saved the seeds from the squash and may make some spicy toasted seeds and top the soup with it.

I read the top reviews so I tried the recipe first without the cream cheese (or half n half as another reviewer suggested).  I have to admit that I liked this best without the cheese.   I liked it ok with a touch of cream, but just a tiny amount.  also, since I had it in my csa box, I substituted a leek for an onion.  I added a half of celeriac and a small fennel bulb and two peeled apples.  It was glorious.  I didn't taste the fennel since it was such a small amount.  The celeriac made it really creamy.  this soup is really filling.  I made a lot of it and it will freeze well (without the cheese or cream).  Awesome recipe.  I'm glad I tried it. 5 stars even with the changes, since I might have passed on this if it didn't get such high reviews.

In an attempt to eat more fresh produce this year I bought 2lbs of peeled and chopped butternut squash from Sam's Club and decided to try something new. I scaled the recipe down to 4 servings and ended up with 6 - 1cup servings. I didn't have marjoram so I subbed oregeno. I also roasted the squash for 25 minutes in the oven, per the suggestion of others. The first night the soup was just okay, but after a couple of days the soup was amazing. I had it for lunch everyday for a week, and the 1 cup was just enough to really satisfy me. I will definitely make it again, and let it sit for a day or two before I plan to eat it. Thanks!

Absolutely delicious! Although I sort of used this recipe as a base and used what I had on hand at home. Here's what I did:

Sauteed the onions in about 3 TB of olive oil. Once they are soft, added in some minced garlic. Then throw in the squash (I used two bags of pre-cut, cubed from Trader Joe's) and a can of chicken broth. Add salt, pepper and fresh thyme (about 1 tablespoon; dried would probably work fine). Cooked for about 25 mins until the squash is tender. Take off stove and added about half a package of cream cheese. I used whipped because that's what we had. Taste for seasoning; add more salt if needed. Put all in blender and serve!

Ok. . .just made this recipe for the first time and it is amazing! I did cut the cream cheese down to just one 8 oz. and can't imagine having used 2, it's great with one! I wasn't sure if I was supposed to purée the onions with the squash as well, so I have small onions in my soup(which I don't really mind). I suppose next time I will try to purée it all together or possibly just strain out the extra particles from the onion and spices. Very good recipe, I will be making this again!

Amazing soup!  Helpful tip-if you make it too spicey (I was trying to double the recipe and added a little to much of both peppers) just add 1 teaspoon of lemon juice and it cools it right off!  Whew!

So yum! Half the cream cheese is MORE THAN enough (And I love cream cheese!) I added a bit more salt and pepper and a dash of nutmeg.

Another amazing review for this amazing soup!  I can't believe how fast, easy and forgiving this recipe was.  I just roasted the left over squash from thanksgiving in the oven for 40 minutes, dumped it on top of sauteed onion and garlic, used oregano since I didn't have majoram handy, used a combo of 1% milk and chicken broth and let it simmer for about 20 minutes.  Added 2 oz of reduced fat cream cheese, pureed in the blender and voila!  My four year old wants to have this "every single dinner"...success!

This soup is easy and delicious. I've fixed it twice now and both times a big hit.  The first time we went by the recipe and it was a little too rich for us so the second time I baked the squash in the oven for 45 min at 350 degrees, used chicken broth instead of the water and boullion cubes and used only 1 pkg of cream cheese .  I have passed this recipe on to numerous people who enjoyed it just as much as we did!  Thanks!

by far the best butternut squash recipe I have ever eaten. smooth and creamy with just a hint of bite from the cayenne... yum!


I did reduce the water by one cup, (i only used one medium sized squash), and one package of cream cheese (since that's all I had on hand). I also used butter instead of margarine - and it turned out fantastic.

I love butternut squash soup!  Why cream cheese? It is so fattening. Any milk would suffice. If you must have the cream I would go for whipping cream over cream cheese. The only spices I used was salt, pepper and paprika. I also used chicken stock and not chicken broth.Yummm!!!

This is a great little starter recipe--provides the basics for how to make butternut squash soup and can be tweaked in many ways.

I baked my squash first, with cinnamon, cloves, brown sugar and a little butter before adding to the sauteed onions and spices.

I then used neufchatel cheese to cut down the fat and calories, and half as much as called for.  I used a mix of half and half and skim milk to help thin it out and find rich, but smooth consistency.

I'm looking forward to making it again this winter and playing with the proportions and spices again!

MY FAVORITE SOUP! I bake my butternut squash whole and then cut it in half and pull the peel right off, put it in the blender to puree. I bought a bunch from a local farm market so I can freeze 6 cup bags so I am ready to make this all year long.

Oh my goodness, this is by far the BEST butternut squash soup I have ever had.  I love the taste of cayenne pepper in it.  I doubled the marjoram and my squash was huge so I don't know how that affected the taste all I know is that my husband and I loved it.  I also added only about 4oz of cream cheese.  This will the only butternut squash soup I will be making!  Really, really amazing!

Amazing, this is one of my favorite soups to make in the fall. The flavor is off the charts and I give most of the credit to the cream cheese. It really makes this a super rich and creamy meal.

This soup is so incredible! I had no idea how delicious and naturally sweet butternut squash is. I roasted squash in oven for 45 min at 345. Used chicken stock instead of water and boiled a peeled and cut up pear w stock and onions.  Cut butter significantly and used less than half cream cheese.  Could have even used less. Used 1% organic milk to thin and perfection! I'm hooked!

With all the 5 star ratings of other viewers I feel I must have goofed on this recipe somehow because the flavor was just okay.  I want to try it again sometime and if it turns out better I will change my rating.  Anyway, Mary, thanks for submitting this recipe as it seems to be a top rated recipe by others....I just need to get it right!  7-13-16:  I tried this again and this time I oven roasted the squash and then scooped the softened squash into the onion mixture.  After adding the squash and cream cheese to the pot, I used my immersion blender until smooth.  This was not only faster, but less to clean!  I also used my own chicken bone broth and the end result was really good.  Tho next time  I am only going to use 1 package of cream cheese because it was a little too rich.

I doctored some.  Used 6 tsp liquid beef bouillon and omitted the marjoram but used curry instead; I also added 2 peeled and chopped granny smith apples. After boiling etc. I pureed all and in the last puree batch (which was mostly liquid) I added 1/2 of one container of light cream cheese.  The potato and apples really thickened the soup - EXCELLENT

Great soup.  I only added one package of cream cheese and it was MORE than enough.  You could easily cut that to half and it would still be yummy.  I also used fresh marjoram which made my kitchen smell wonderful.

Soup came out delicious. I would've rated it 5 stars, but even though I only used 6 ounces of cream cheese, it was a little too much. Could be I didn't use 6 cups of butternut squash. Would help if recipe told you how many butternut squashes it takes to make 6 cups. Anyway, it was pretty easy. The toughest part was cutting up the butternut squash. I may go with the precut stuff next time instead.

Like the other reviewers, I roasted the squash first.  Then, I added it to the broth to simmer and, after 20 minutes, I was able to easily mash it with a potato masher/ricer in the pot, which I think was easier and less messy than using a blender/food processor.  I realized at the last minute that I did not have marjoram, so I substituted thyme and a little cumin, which I thought tasted great with the cayenne.  Really rich, creamy, lets the great taste of the squash shine through.

I added a healthy dose of garlic to this and used only half the cheese (reduced fat, at that) and it was very good. I felt it was too thick, but my husband, who loves thick, creamy soups, loved it.

This was fabulous!  Also roasted squash and used 1/2 the cream cheese (used fat free).  Made for a vegetarian friend so omitted the chicken stuff for water, Mrs. Dash and extra spices.  Couldn't find the marjoram in my spice cabinet so used italian seasonings instead.  Used a whole onion sauted in butter and crushed a few garlic cloves too.  Added a bit of salt at the end.  I will be making this all winter!!

Delicious! I used a bit extra squash and only half the cream cheese and it was amazing! I planned on using the whole amount of cream cheese but realized it would have been too rich if I had. Can't wait to share this recipe with friends! I think next time I'll add an acorn squash or a yam for extra flavor.   (Due to other suggestions I roasted the squash for about 45 minutes at 350 degrees)

This soup is delicious! I did give it 4 stars because I made some changes.   First, I baked the squash at 375 for about half an hour. This made it much easier to cut! I also only had 2cups chicken broth so I added 2 cups water and a lot of spices. I also added 1 sliced jalapeño pepper to spice it up. Following reviewer suggestions, I only added about half the cream cheese and I'm glad for that. It would have been too rich if I used the full amount.   Delicious soup I do recommend the added jalapeño! As a side note, I the soup is grainy try blending for longer.

only changes I made was to slice the squash in half and bake in the oven first (350 for about an hour). Also used butter instead of margarine (and about 1T instead of 4T). Didn't have marjoram so I used oregano. Also used only 6 oz of low-fat cream cheese (can't imagine using 2 whole packages!) It was still VERY thick and creamy. Delicious!

i made quite a bit of modifications. in the end, this is what i did (using this recipie as a guide)   4-5 servings:  I roasted one medium butternut squash in the oven for about 45 minutes.  I seasoned it with salt, pepper and olive oil before i put it in the oven. I did this the night before and scraped the flesh out of the butternut squash and put it in the fridge overnight for easy prep the next day.  In a medium pot, i browned 1 med. onion.  Added  2 carrots, 2 celery, 1 large sweet potato. Let that cook down for 5-7 minutes.  added enough chicken broth to cover the veggies.  Bring to a boil and simmer for 40 minutes.  Using a hand blender, i blended the soup in the pot and added more chicken broth until i got the consistency i wanted.  I threw in salt, pepper, cinnamon, all spice, groud cloves, and ground cayenne pepper.  Sour cream to garnish.   such a versitile soup that you can modify to your taste!

Made a few changes, added 2 carrots, 1 large or two small garnet yams and some celery. Roasted the squash, yams and carrots in the oven to carmelize. Sauted the celery with the onions. Used white instead of black pepper, added a good splash of cream sherry and used only 6 oz of fat free cream cheese. AMAZING! I also have made this using a little fat free half and half because I didn't have enough cream cheese, same results.

Butternut squash soup is so versatile it's hard to mess up, but here are my suggestions after many, many times using this recipe. Halve and roast the squash with the 1/2 onion (quartered), 1 carrot (1/2 inch slides), 1 apple (peeled/cored/quartered) and 2 garlic cloves for 45 min. Use chicken broth (reduced sodium) instead of water/bouillon, cut cream cheese to about 4 oz. Add a few pinches each of ground curry and ground ginger with the chicken broth. Stir in 1/2 c.  half and half or milk just before serving.

This soup was simply outstanding.  I roasted the squash before cooking and added some freshly grated nutmeg.  The taste was so good and my Thanksgiving guests loved it.

Without a doubt, the BEST soup recipe I've had from this site.  As suggested by others, I roasted the squash and cut the cream cheese back to 1 (8 oz)package.  We devoured this, with a small bowl left over for my husbands lunch.

This soup had one of the strangest tastes/consistencies we've ever eaten.   Our 1 year old ate it the best, however, she gets butternut squash baby food on a regular basis.  As a side note, neither my husband or I had ever had squash soup so I'm not sure what we were expecting.  I added cheese ravioli to give it a little texture.  This just wasn't for us.

Yummmmy!  I did modify the original recipe a little bit.  I substituted green onion for the onion, fresh cayenne peppers (3 seeded and chopped) for the ground cayenne pepper.  I sauteed the green onion, chopped cayenne peppers and two gloves of fresh garlic in about 2 T of butter until tender.  I roasted the squash in a 375 oven as others had suggested prior to adding it to the pan with the sauteed onion mixture and 3 cups of chicken broth.  I had to simmer the mixture about 10 minutes so that the squash was the right consistency to blend with my hand blender (right in the pan).  I also added a little salt and fresh ginger. I blended in about 4 ounces of reduced fat cream cheese as the last step. My boyfriend raved about the soup!  This soup will find its way to our table a lot during the upcoming cooler months!  Delicious!

I've made different variations of this recipe for years. I never have put cream cheese in any of them... and after tasting this soup I never will again. The soup was very rich. My advice is find another recipe...

Absolutely fantastic!  4 stars because it is definately better when you roast the squash.  Don't like Margoram, so I used Thyme, and used 1/4 of the amount of cream cheese.  Thank you!

This soup is absolutely delicious. Like a lot of the people who commented, I halved the cream cheese and baked my squash instead. I also subbed oregano for the marjoram, and threw in a new potato because I wasn't sure if I had enough squash.

This was pretty good, but we made a few changes. We thought the cream cheese was awfully fattening, so we cut that out and replaced it with 3/4 cup of milk. It was still very creamy. After tasting, we added some red pepper flakes and some cumin.

I made this recipe according to the directions until, like other reviewers, it came to the cream cheese. I put in one box, half the proposed amount, and I still found the cream cheese taste to be really overpowering. I wish I would have put in 1/4 of the amount and then added more to taste. Also, like others mentioned, the finished soup was extremely thick, like a dip. I probably added another 3 or 4 cups of chicken stock to thin it. All in all, I would make the recipe again because it's really easy, but I will make some major tweaks. Oh, and here's a note for the other beginner cooks out there: one butternut squash is more than enough to make the soup. You do not need to purchase multiple squash. 6 cups sounds like a lot, but a squash goes a long way.

SO SO SO darn good!  A friend made this for me first and I was skeptical because I hadn't had good experiences with this type of soup in the past.  But it was so good.  I got the recipe from her and then found it here.  I did much the same as others have already mentioned: I baked the squash in the oven versus boiling it.  I used one medium onion and sauteed it in olive oil versus butter.  I cut the water in half, but used all the chicken broth.  I didn't add the cayenne pepper, but did extra basil and seasonings.  I also only did one package of cream cheese.  Turned out great.  Great flavor and not too squash-y!

I've been wanting to try this one forever!  I baked two squash (cut into quarters) at 400 for 45 minutes.  Way easier than trying to peel those monsters.  I only used 4 oz cream cheese and thought it was perfect.  My regular blender is broken so I just pureed it right in the pot with a hand blender and it was so easy!

I put the squash/onion/broth mix into the food processor and gave it a try before adding any cream cheese. It was beyond amazing. It's really hard to believe that something so simple could be so delicious. I was afraid, however, that by not adding the cream cheese I'd be missing out on something. I added less than half of the amount listed in the recipe, but even that small amount was enough to kind of ruin the recipe. It's delicious enough before adding any cream cheese, so just leave it out. Cheers to our health!

This is the second time I have made butternut squash soup. I must say that this version is much more appealing to be me than the cinnamon, ginger, clove, etc. version. I used neufchatel cheese instead of regular cream cheese to cut down on fat and it is still wonderful. I used 4 c. of chicken broth and the soup is a little thinner than I would like (but still delicious!) so I will cut down to 3 c. next time.

Delicious and so easy to make.  I did use canned chicken broth and precut butternut squash. One brick of cream cheese was plenty.  I also added a few dashes of nutmeg.  I would make this again.

I added a ton of pumpkin pie spices and used light sour cream instead of cream cheese, cutting the amount in half. It gave a nice zip to the soup. It was DELICIOUS!!!

This is a definite 5* recipe!  So good and so simple.  I also only used 1 pkg cream cheese and may use even less next time as it was still very rich.  There were no leftovers!  Thanks for a new way to use squash!

Wonderful, rich soup!  Cook the squash (halved) before you try to peel and cube it.  You can bake, boil or microwave it.

I made this as-is and it's absolutely DELICIOUS...

What a heavenly soup!  I paired it with King's brand Honey Wheat dinner rolls and that was an excellent combination.  In the future I think I'll serve this with some roasted vegetables (probably winter squash, potatoes, carrots, stuff like that) and I think the combination will be great.

This soup is pretty filling and a bit thick, which is what I prefer anyway.

Definitely a wonderful cool-weather recipe!  I can see making this all winter long...

Wow! Super easy, fast and oh so yummy! Better than any I've had at restaurants. Made just as recipe with exception of used butter instead of margarine, reduced fat Cream Cheese, and  added a dash more cayenne.  I used my FAVORITE kitchen tool, my immersion blender & simply pureed it in the pan I cooked it in. Will be a "regular" on my menu rotation. Thanks for submitting it!

I used others advice to roast the squash first, then only use 8ox of cream cheese and it was looking good and smelling good until i added the marjoram, it totally ruined this for me. Next time i think i will only add a little bit of brown sugar and salt and pepper, then i think this would be great!

Very yummy, but I also tweaked it a bit. -I roasted the squash, cut side down for 45 minutes. -I only used about 1/2 a block of fat free cream cheese. -I added "most of" a can of vegetable broth to the finished soup, as I found it to be too thick. -I laced it with fat free half & half before serving. -And I served it with garlic cheddar biscuits... delicious! Next time, I'm going to use Vegetable Stock instead of the chicken broth for a vegetarian version.

My husband made this and it came out delicious tasting but runny, maybe because he only used 4 oz of the cream cheese?  I think it had enough cream cheese, it didn't overpower the squash.  My husband did a few things differently:  like I said less cream cheese, he roasted a whole onion and the butternut squash, he also roasted a whole head of garlic and used that, he used 3 cups of chicken broth instead of the water/bouillon combo, and he added some nutmeg.  Like I said, the flavor was excellent, we just need to work on the consistency the next time we make it.  It's definitely a side soup type of thing, not hardy.

On my third time making this! Very good!After making this recipe once, I cut the cream cheese down to 1/3 and let a small amont of sour cream melt in the middle of each hot bowl of soup served.This was the first butternut squash soup recipe I've tried and I feel the need to look no further for something better. Thanks!

This was very simple to make & was a perfect side to smoked pork chops!
I gave this 4 instead of 5 simply because, like quite a few other reviewers, I made some changes to the written recipe.
I, too, roasted the squash in the oven.  IMO this not only adds flavor but adds to the ease in preparation.
I'm doing WW so I reduced some of the fat & calories by using fat free cream cheese and only half of the called for amount.  I also used fat free margerine.
I thought the soup was very rich & creamy.  I believe using the full amount of cream cheese in the recipe may have overwhelmed the mellow flavor of the squash.  
With these simple changes, this recipe came in at only 3 points per serving according to the WW recipe builder.  Def. a keeper for my winter soup recipe box!

My whole house is in love with this soup. For a rich treat - every now and then - I leave the portion of cream cheese as is. I always add extra onion - lots of it - it helps give a boost of flavor. I always also add an extra cube of the chicken bouillon and add a little extra cayenne to give it some kick. Everyone I've made this for loves it - even friends who don't eat veggies! This is a keeper, I've also told lots of friends about it.

This recipe is awesome.  Even people who say they don't like squash love it.  It's so creamy.  I only use block of cream cheese (which is plenty), and I cook the squash in the microwave and scoop out the pulp into the soup.  It is much faster, and I'll do anything to avoid peeling and cubing raw squash!  Yum!

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this.  So does my 5 year old.  I had this soup at a friends house and had to make it myself for last Christmas.  It was a huge hit.  I have made it several times since.  Everyone asks for the recipe.  I cut the squash in half and roast for about an hour.  I use canned chicken broth.  I do not change the amount of cream cheese.  It's great the way it is.  Try it.  You will be glad you did.

I tried this soup today, with a few mods...  I put a whole small yellow onion in the food processor to chop it pretty fine and added all of it.  I didn't want to hassle with cooking a whole squash, so I used a frozen pkg of cooked squash that was 14 oz cube from Safeway.  I used a single can of chicken broth, also 14oz.  Only used 1 tsp of chicken bouillon granules, skipped the marjoram and cayenne but did add a dash of nutmeg and garlic.  I only added half an 8oz pkg of cream cheese since my batch was so much smaller.  Pureed in blender until smooth and served with a dollup of (not Daisy) sour cream.  It is very good.  Along the lines of other creamy soups like tomato.  Would be very good with grilled cheese sandwiches.

I made this for a pot-luck and this was the first dish to go and 5 people asked for the recipe. No one could believe it was squash! Un-chicken broth was used to make it veggie friendly. Definitely a keeper!

This is a winner!Q My husband said it was about the best soup he ever ate (and he's been around a long time). I used 2 pkgs of peeled and cut squash from Wegmans net wt 20 oz each and adjusted the broth proportionately to about 4 1/2 cups  used 1 cream cheese, blended everything w/ an immersion blender and seasoned to taste
Thanks, Mary

This was unusual. This was my first time cooking and eating butternut squash, so I didn't really know what to expect it to taste like. I followed the advice of others by: 1) cutting the squash in half, drizzling it with olive oil, sprinkling salt and pepper and roasting it. 2) I also roasted a head of garlic at the same time and threw that in later on. 3) I then picked up with the recipe and used homemade chicken broth instead of water & bouillon. And 4) I used half of the cream cheese called for - definately enough! I found it did need a little extra salt and seasoning in the end. It was also a little tart, so I added some sugar to taste.  Okay, but I doubt I will make it again.

The best!!!!!!! What an incredible soup.  I am always so glad that I read the reviews before preparing because I also used only 1/2 an 8oz cream cheese and the soup was still just perfect.  Fat free cream cheese will be super next time I make it (just didn't have it on hand today).  Thanks for this super recipe.  I will be making it all winter!

This recipe is fantastic!  Very easy too.  I used two regular sized butternut squash, baked them at 425 for 35 minutes.  I also used 3 cups chicken broth and 1 package neufchatel cheese.  It all fit in my blender perfectly so I only had to puree one batch.

This recipe isn't excellent, but it's good.  I was alittle disappointed given all the great ratings.  I followed the recipe except I did bake the squash instead of cutting it into little pieces.  Butternut squash is extremely hard, so cutting it into small pieces would have been a nightmare. I sliced it long ways, placed it cut side down in a pyrex, put alittle water and covered with foil -- baked at 350 for 40 min or so.  It was very easy to scoop out at that point and continue the recipe.  If your going to make this, I suggest you prepare the squash the same way.  Like I said, it's worth a try, but I really don't think I'll make it again.

This soup is unbelievable!  I have never eaten squash soup, but after reading all of the great reviews, I thought I'd try it!  I did follow some of the other suggestions and cut the squash in half, sprayed with Pam and baked for 40 minutes before cutting and peeling it.  I used 5 boullion cubes and I only used 8 oz. of cream cheese and that was plenty creamy!  My husband kept on going back for more!  Thank you for a great recipe!

This soup was insanely rich, but still pretty good.  I only used 1 8oz. cube of cream cheese.  I think next time I will add a tiny bit (a couple tablespoons maybe) of cream cheese or may even omit it entirely.  I think the flavor was wonderful without it.

This is a very rich and creamy soup.  Everyone in our family initially raved over it so I have made it several times since.  It is very easy to make.  I prefer to place the cleaned squash face down in a roasting pan and add 1 c of water and cover with foil.  Then I prepare the rest of the meal while it is baking in the oven.

This was excellent, however, I did alter the preparation a bit. As others did, I roasted the squash and only used 1 pkg of cream cheese. I forgot the squash while it was cooking so it roasted for about an hour and 15 minutes, but it didn't burn and seemed to give a better texture. I used a can of chicken broth and added 2 Tbsp of nutmeg. I didn't have the time to mix in a blender so I just put eveything in a large pot and used a hand-held mini-blender to mix. I think it definitely helped in the texture although it was still a little "grainy", not that we minded. It was still a little rich, but excellent. However, when it was reheated for lunch the next day, it was not very good...way to sweet and the taste seemed to have altered a bit. Maybe the ingredients had a chance to "meld" together and alter the flavor. Overall, I great recipe. Thanks!

This soup was so good. My husband loved it too.  It was however, very rich. I used some leftover marscapone cheese and heavy cream (about half of what the recipe calls for in cream cheese). It turned out very well. I think I will use cream cheese next time but definitely only 8oz. Even without adding cream the soup was great...a more healthy option if you are looking for a lowfat recipe.

I just made this soup tonight and it is wonderful!  I only used 1 package of cream cheese and it was still really rich.  I also added roasted red peppers.  I will definitely make this again!

This soup was awesome. I followed others advice and baked the squash in the oven. It is much easier that way. I also increased the cayenne pepper a little. Cayenne pepper is very potent so be careful not to add too much at a time. All of my family loved this soup, for 5 kids and one husband I'd say that deserves 5 stars!

If you make this soup and don't like it, you shouldn't be cooking (eat out!) I don't like squash and think this is one of the best soups I have ever made.  I used canned broth and 1/2 the cream cheese.  Have used different spices each time I make it but love it every time!

Served this as first course for Thanksgiving dinner -- everyone rated it 10 stars!  I only put 1/2 the cream cheese as per the other reviews plus shallots instead of onions and real butter (we don't use margarine) with packaged chicken stock.  It came out creamy and delicious.  Everyone was scraping their bowls to get the very last drop.  Fabulous recipe, Mary, thanks!

A really good, fall soup but we all agreed the cream cheese was a bit overwhelming.  Wish I would have read the reviews ahead of time, as I usually do, because I think I would try this soup again but cut the amount of cream cheese in 1/2.  My 11 yr. old thought chunks of chicken would be a good addition also.

Great soup - I halved the cream cheese, and used lite instead of full-fat.  It was still incredibly rich.  I also used chicken stock from a can, which was easy and delicious.  I'll definitely make this again.

Wow!  On a scale of 1 to 5, this recipe is a 10.  I've been using this recipe now for years and it is a staple recipe in our household.  I only use 1/2 package cream cheese and it's still wonderfully creamy.  For ease, I also skip the onions and butter and just add 1 tsp onion powder.

This is one of our favorite soup recipes!  I added minced garlic and 1/2 cup of white wine to the butter & onions.  I used half of the cream cheese this time, but would probably use more next time since we like it thicker & richer.  I also reserve a cup or more of the cooked squash and add it to the blended soup for interest and texture.  I garnish each bowl with shredded sharp cheddar and a dollop of cream cheese.  Even my picky 2 year old likes this soup, especially when I add some cooked brown rice to his bowl.

Ever since I had Butternut Squash Soup on Thanksgiving, I've been on a real tear to find a recipe for this rich soup.. This recipe and the reviews makes me believe that I found the right recipe.. The only real snag for me is that I've been put on doctor mandated weight loss program, and this recipe calls for cream cheese.. My solution? NOT-FAT half & half! Land of Lakes makes it, and I'm going to give it a shot.. I'll report back the results, but I anticipate, it'll be delicious!

This was a perfect soup for a cold snowy day. I added garlic to the sautéed onions, a pinch of hot pepper flakes, and half the cream cheese. I used an immersion blender to get it nice and creamy. Then I topped each serving with a tablespoon of crumbled bacon. It was delicious and beautiful. This is a recipe I'll definitely keep in my recipe box.

I love the soup! I am down to making it without measuring anything. Blend everything then add the cream cheese on high for about 30 mins. I personally believe that it is better slow cooked. I have also make it with an apple cinnamon version. I boil 1 apple and a cinnamon stick with the broth from the soup for about 30 mins, blend and then add. Gives it a totally different experience! Sometimes I add cooked ground sausage and peppers in the middle to again add a different taste and it actually goes well with the soup! Women tend to love this soup, men not as much :/

I used "not chicken chicken broth" sounds funny,to keep it vegetarian. I also used less cream cheese after reading reviews. And according to the poster. Glad i did because i think more and i would have lost to much of the butternut taste.  Thanks am going to make it for thanksgiving

Loved it!!! . . . But like most cooks I did slightly alter the recipe. My alterations were: I added approximately 3 to 4 more cups of squash, kept the peels on, 1 more cup water, deleted the marjoram, used butter instead of margarine, used ground red pepper instead of cayenne, and cut half a cube of the cream cheese off the recipe. I also added a little extra salt-and-pepper and this concoction was freaking delicious!

I have made this many times now. My husband calls it restaurant quality and always asks me to make it when we have company he wants to impress, LOL. More importantly, even my mother-in-law was impressed!  I do only use 1/4 of the cream cheese called for though, otherwise it is WAY to cream-cheesy.
Here's what I do: Cut squash in half and bake for 1 hour at 350 (cut side down on tin foil). Let cool while sauteeing onions and some garlic. (Sometimes I cook the squash the day before). Add one peeled/cored apple. Scoop out squash into pot. Depending on how ripe/soft the squash is, it's sometimes easier to cut the squash into strips and slice the skin off. I actually do this more often than not. Add broth. Add seasoning (marjoram, nutmeg - 1/2tsp, cinnamon - 1 tsp, dash of cloves, S&P, garlic powder). Simmer for an hour or so, then drop in the cream cheese for a few mins to soften before blending with a hand immersion blender. Done!

I will give 5 stars because this recipe is always my base but I don't follow it word for word, as is 3 stars. As you will see with many of the other reviews. This morning I decided I will never 'cut up' butternut  raw again because my hand is still sore. My husband got a 4.5 pound squash - 2 pounds is about six cups. Cook in the oven before... Taste better and so much easier. 
You must LOVE cream cheese to add that much. You can also substitute heavy cream, milk, potatoes, or a milk/flour/butter thickener. 
This soup is simple and tasty - great for a cold Wisconsin winter.

This soup is DELICIOUS!  My family loved it. The cayenne pepper gives it a great zing.  It's really creamy and filling, and leftovers reheat well in the microwave. 
 
I didn't change the recipe, but I AM a shortcut taker...  I used three 12-oz boxes of frozen butternut squash--it's already cooked and pureed, so I heated it in the pot with the other ingredients until the squash wasn't frozen anymore then brought it to a boil, and eliminated the additional 20 minutes cooking time.  I tossed the cream cheese in and blended with an immersion blender right in the cooking pot so I didn't have to transfer the soup back and forth.  

The flavor is wonderful. Just for variety I'm going to add cilantro and curry next time as it seems it would make a good Indian-style soup as well.  I'm sure there are many possible variations, but try this soup as-is first!

I prepared this according to the recipe and exact instructions (unlike many reviewers), and thought it was awesome. The only thing I'd be sure to change is to skip the nasty synthetic margarine and use real food...butter. Using a stick blender to smooth the soup is easier and safer than using a food processor.

Husband and I loved this - but with a few modifications.  I didn't have marjoram so skipped, used only 1 block of light cream cheese, used 1 box chicken broth instead of water and bouillion. Also because I love flavor of green apple with butternut squash I added 2 peeled, cored and chopped Granny Smith apples when I added the squash. Also I didn't measure the squash - I just used what I got from 2 medium sized squashes.

I halved this recipe--I only had 1/2 a 2.25 lb. butternut squash, so I used half of everything specified, and used organic chicken broth instead of water and bullion. It turned out delightfully. This is the first recipe I've awarded 5 stars. Also, I used fat free cream cheese without any adverse impact on the recipe. This soup is comfort food, with a subtle sweetness and velvety texture. I agree with other reviewers--roast the squash in the oven so the peel comes off easily.

We love this soup but I made several changes. 1)Used homemade chicken broth instead of bullion cubes. 2)Rubbed a sprinkle of dry oregano and parsley into it instead of marjoram. 3)Added a small sweet potato and a couple of small carrots. 4)Used just one package cream cheese. 5)Used a submersion blender right in the pot to blend instead of messing with regular blender, much easier!

I loved this recipe.  After reading many of the reviews, I made a few changes too.  3 Acorn Squash, that I cut in half and baked in the oven for 40 minutes at 375; chopped three shallots and four carrots and sautéed both in a stick of butter,  Once soft, I transferred to by Slow Cooker/Pressure cooker; added 4 cups of chicken base, 1 tbsp. of ground ginger, 2 tbsp. of brown sugar, salt and pepper.  Took the squash from the oven and scooped all into the slow cooker.  Cooked slow for 2 1/2 hours and them blended all in the cooker, finally added 8 oz of whipped cream cheese, blended that in and covered slow cooker for another 1 1/2 hours.  Husband loved it, so I dared to bring a pint to my Mother...Received two thumbs up from her.
Thanks to all for weighing in on the great recipe.

Great soup!! I roasted (one squash since I didn't measure) with salt, pepper, olive oil and a sprinkle of nutmeg for about an hour. I took out the seeds and cut it in about 8 pieces. Then there's no need to boil the squash once you add it to the onion since it's already cooked! There's absolutely no reason to add 2 packages of cream cheese. I only added half of one package and it's so creamy!!! I also added a pinch of all spice and nutmeg to the soup, and like another reviewer went a little heavier on the cayenne. This soup is one of my first and it's FANTASTIC! Thanks for the great recipe!

We loved it! I  I roasted the squash first along with a couple of whole garlic heads.  (Cut the squash and scooped out seeds, cut the garlic in half then brushed olive oil across tops of squash and garlic, sprinkled a bit of salt and pepper, put cut side down in a pan and baked at 350 degrees for about 45 minutes). The roasting of garlic and squash was from a different recipe. I had them roasting when I found this recipe.  I only used one 8 oz package of reduced fat cream cheese.  I added a little bit of non fat sour cream when serving and then enjoyed!  Oh so good!  Husband loved it too!

It was easy, quick and amazing.  Very delicious. Followed recipe except used butter vs margarine.  Took one butternut squash to get the 6 cups and used 1/3 cup for the onions.

Made this 3 times in the last two weeks... Thanksgiving everyone loved it so thank you! Made it again for my girlfriends family and once more for a holiday party this past weekend. People were asking for the scoop on how to make it. 

Followed the ingredients aside from water and bouillon, I used free range low sodium chicken broth, which was a nice touch. And the 2nd time I decided to try a low fat Philly cream cheese and I used about 15 oz the taste was not even really noticably different. So for the health concience thats something to keep in mind. 

third time I made it for double the serving about 14 people, doubled the squash and the broth kept the cream cheese at 16 oz for the double servings and it was still 2/3 fat Philly cream cheese and yet again it was a hit. 

Also, I used one of my favotite ingredients, Tumeric, eyeballed it as I do everyting else but it was about 1/8 Tablespoon for the smaller pot and about 1/2 tablespoon for the double recipe, adds some really nice floral notes and helps wo compliment with a nice white wine of your choice. 

I also doubled the Cayenne... Yum 

Hope this helped someone.

My neighbor gifted me a butternut squash that was close to 2 1/2 lbs, so I decided to give this a try.  I halved, de-seeded and roasted the squash at 350 for about 40 minutes.  After roasting I could easily scoop the flesh out into the soup pot.  I added 3 1/2 cups of chicken broth rather than the bouillon/water, along with the remaining ingredients and simmered for 20 minutes to meld the flavors.  I pureed the soup with my emersion blender right in the pot.  After tasting the soup I decided to skip the cream cheese altogether.  I thought it tasted great without it.

THIS IS SO SO GOOD!!!  I roasted the squash like the others said to and then separately boiled the water, boullion, onions, black pepper, cayene pepper, and some salt in a sauce pan.  I scooped out the squash and put it in the blender, added the cream cheese, and then poured the boiling ingredients over top in the blender and puree'ed it.  I didnt add margerine because I forgot and I didnt add marjoram because I dont have any.  lol  It was absolutely fine without both.  I find that this could also be used as a fondue!!  AWESOME!!!  Oh and my husband and I are on Weight Watchers and this is only 2 points per serving!!!  YAY!!!

Absolutely wonderful! I used one Honey Crisp apple as one user suggested for a little sweetness. I also used one pkg of cream cheese as others suggested. My husband folded sauted veggies into a couple of spoonfuls of leftover soup to make a veggie omelet. It was very good. We also used the leftovers poured over a baked potato. It's all good!

I reduced the cream cheese to 3 oz. and tripled the cayenne pepper. I also added a dash of orange juice.

Was really good and I'll make it again.  I made a couple of minor changes:  I used chicken stock instead of bouillon cubes.  I added only 1/2 of one block of cream cheese.  I was trying to cut back on the fat but I think next time I'll add the entire block.  However, I did use real butter b/c I don't use margerine.  There goes the "lower fat" thing -  I know!   I had a bit of the grainy texture to my soup, as someone else mentioned. I used the immersion blender and think next time I'll try the blender.  Overall, I will definitely keep this as an easy, go-to butternut squash recipe.

I thought this recipe was fantastic, but I too made some changes.   I roasted a 3 lb squash with a peeled granny smith apple for 45 mins at 375.  I sautéed 1 medium onion chopped, 1 peeled chopped carrot, and 1 Yukon gold potato, 2 cloves of minced garlic in the 4T butter.  I used 4 c low sodium chicken broth, added the the chopped up roasted squash and apple, added 1/2 t marjoram, 1/4 t cayenne pepper, 1/4 t rubbed sage, and pepper.  Simmer for 10 mins.  Added salt to taste.  Puréed in the blender w/ only 4 oz of cream cheese.  Was delicious, but I wanted a bit more bite so I added 1 T of apple cider vinegar.  Truly spectacular.  It is a thick soup, but I like it that way!

I didn't make any modifications except to roast the squash first for about 50 minutes at 425 degrees; then scoop out the squash and add to pot with the rest of the ingredients. I used a handheld blender to blend the soup right in the pot, and it was very creamy, no lumps. The cream cheese makes it extra yummy. I added more cayenne pepper and some nutmeg. I also sauteed some garlic along with the onion. Delicious!

This was a very thick soup, and it was very rich. It was a little too rich to be a soup, but it made an AWESOME gravy! To cut the fat back, I used fat-free cream cheese. To make the fat I put in it healthier, I used EVOO instead of butter.

Such a simple, yummy recipe.  I substituted about 1/2 a can of condensed milk for the cream cheese, since I didn't have any on hand.  Added a potato and doubled the cayenne as suggested by other reviews.

This soup is excellent! I have never even had butternut squash before, but fixed this for my elderly father who has to have all of his teeth pulled. I was surprised how tasty it is. I followed the advice of other reviewers by roasting the squash and only using one package of cream cheese. I also a whole medium sized onion. Will definitely be making this for myself in the future.

FANTASTIC recipe!  We had this with Easter dinner, and it turned out perfectly.  Minor changes to the recipe:  2 medium sized onions, butter vice margarine, chicken broth in replacement of the water, and 2 cubes chicken bouillon.  Sooo good, we had nothing left... Thank you!!!

This soup is absolutely delicious.  Just as good as you would expect with all the 5-star reviews.  I followed suggestions from some other cooks & added an apple to the soup, and only one 8 oz. pkg of cream cheese.  I used Neufchatel (light cream cheese) and chicken broth instead of water & boullion.  Also, I used oregano instead of marjoram because that's what I had on hand.  I started to give it only 4 stars because my husband wasn't as crazy about it as I am.  But as far as I'm concerned it's over the top good!  You must try it!

Took the advice from others and changed it a little. Mostly because I didn't have cream cheese and I did not want to go to the store. Roasted it for 40min face down, then 15 face up with butter and garlic. Then did what others suggested. I also added finely chopped apples to give it a crunch. It was a big hit.

Simply amazing!  This soup will become one of my favorites.  I halved the cream cheese because I didn't want the soup to be too heavy.  Next time I will use only a third of the cream cheese.  Also, I added a little garlic, and a touch of curry powder and it was divine.  Rich, smooth, creamy, and comforting.  A perfect winter soup.

awesome. I used a little garlic with the onion.  I baked the squash after cutting it in half and placing on a cookie sheet brushed with olive oil.  Used much less cream cheese and much less red pepper (the 1st time I made this it came out way too spicy even using 1/2 the amount of red pepper).  I blended in my Vitamix and it is sooo creamy.

I followed the recipe with two modifications. I used butter instead of margarine and substitued Not Chik'n cubes for the chicken bouillon. It was excellent - I will definitely use this (slightly modified) recipe again!

I only made a couple of changes and it only made it easier.  Instead of bouillon i used LowFat, Low Sodium Chicken Stock and reduced the amount of cream cheese to 12 oz. using Low Fat Cream Cheese. Added a little parsley on top and it was delicious.  I'm enjoying a mug of it right now!!!!

Not really me, but I actually liked it. I really liked it with Wheat Thins chips. My mother begged me to make it again.

This is the first time I've ever made Butternut Squash Soup and it was fantastic! I followed a few tips from other reviewers and it was perfection. I roasted my squash first which made peeling easier. I used 4 Cups of chicken broth and added 1sp. of curry powder, a cinnamon stick and a bayleaf for some extra flavor. I omitted the marjoram which I didn't have. I didn't have cream cheese either so added 1/2 and 1/2 before serving, plus some brown sugar, which made the soup sweet at first, followed up by the heat from the cayenne and curry. AMAZING!

This was lovely!  I had leftover squash from another recipe and was pleased to see that I had all the other ingredients on hand as well.  This was simple, quick and delicious!  I am sure I will make it again, although I think I will only use 1/2 the cream cheese next time.

I never thought butternut squash soup could taste so good. Made ahead of time to serve with crusty bread Christmas Eve Lunch. From what I tasted off the spoon, this soup is delish!

This was delicious. I made it as-is, except I added some chopped up kale for extra nutrition and color (I added it along with the squash at the beginning so it would cook down). I would love to experiment with adding mushrooms, beer and/or broccoli to the mix also!!

Delish!  Used this as a guide.  Did add crumbled cooked sweet Italian sausage in the end to add some savoriness.  Made it a meal!  Freezing some leftovers, we will see how if that is successful.

Best squash soup I've ever made! Halved the recipe, using 3 c. butternut squash, and wild onions. Definitely the easiest way to make this it to halve the squash, put in Pyrex with butter and 1/2 c. water and bake until tender, then add other ingredients and blend. Since I only used 3 c. of the cooked squash, I made pumpkin bread with the rest. Very good recipe!!!

I'm not a huge squash fan, but this will make a lover of the most skeptic squash eater. Love the creamy texture and the sweet flavor balanced out by the cayenne pepper.

I really liked it, but my wife didn't. I cut the cream cheese by 1/4 the amount, and should've done more as the soup is more squash flavored cream cheese, than squash soup.

I followed the advice of others and baked the squash first. I added 1 1/2 cans of chicken broth instead of water and boullion and only one package of cream cheese. It turned out great! Just wish I had doubled the recipe, as it didn't make enough for too many leftovers. And definitely some homemade bread to go with it is great!

This turned out really well. I was surprised. I didn't have a blender to use at the moment nor a food processor, so I used a stand mixer. It wasn't as smooth as I would have liked but it was still delicious!

delish. I followed other peoples recommendations and reduced the cream cheese to 1 block and added a little cumin at the end. I also put it in the blender rather then food processor, just be sure to loosen top a little to allow steam to escape. My husband loved it and hates butternut squash. Did I mention how much he hates it.

Everyone seems to love this but I didn't care for it. I think the cream cheese may have been its downfall. I roasted the squash first for 40 minutes at 375. Had no marjoram so used poultry seasoning instead which is primarily marjoram. It smelled fabulous while cooking. I only added half the cream cheese but it was still very overpowering and the soup was way too thick and too sweet for my taste. Without the cream cheese it may have been quite good, I'd suggest pureeing and sample first before adding it.

This is the best soup for Thanksgiving! Love the sweetness with the spice of the cayenne.  I use chicken stock instead of the water and boullian cubes.  Instead of 2 cream cheeses, I use one plus add some fat free half and half and a bit of sherry at the end.  I also kick it up a bit with a little more cayenne.  Like to serve it in demitasse cups as an appetizer, passing it among guests.

Absolutely delicious soup. I roasted the squash in the oven and only used 1 package of cream cheese and it was so good. I loved the little bite you get from the cayenne pepper, maybe add a dash more. Oh, i also simmered the broth with 2 bay leaves. I am going to start growing squash in my garden from now on just so i can make this soup.

This turned out Really good! I did not put margarine--I put butter. Instead of 2 pkg's of cream cheese I put 1 1/4 and was still very creamy. I used a food processor but it needs a blender to get it finely pureed. I added more cayenne to be spicier. Very delish!

I haven't had or made this soup before so I wasn't sure what to expect, but the boyfriend was happy with it and so was I. I roasted the butternut squash with olive oil, salt, pepper, and garlic as some of the other readers had suggested. I also used half of a granny smith apple and, instead of cream cheese, just a bit of heavy cream did the trick. I regretted using the apple at frst because the soup was too sweet, but you can use something acidic to balance that out - I threw a little splash of balsamic vinegar in and it balanced it well. I also added more spices then the recipe called for.

This soup is awesome. I roasted the squash as per suggestions, also threw in 3/4 can of leftover pureed pumpkin. The flavors worked well together. I only had 1 pkg of cream cheese, but seemed plenty smooth and creamy for my taste after putting soup through the blender. DELISH!

I added half the cream cheese with a little bit of light sour cream and it was perfect. I used light cream cheese. I actually cant imagine the recipe with the full amnt of c.c. I think it would be too rich! I also added garlic powder and dried rosemary.

This recipe is absolutely wonderful.  I did change it a little. Roasted the butternut first - cut in 1/2, scoop pulp, oil w/ olive oil, salt & pepper. 350 for approx 45 minutes.  I used chicken broth vs. water & bouillon.  I also took the recommendation of others and cut the amount of cream cheese down to 4 oz.  Perfect!!!

I didn't have marjoram so left it out. It was amazing! I'm not sure I ever want to try it with. Only used 4 oz. sour cream...still rich and creamy! My family loved it too. I called it Halloween soup!

This soup was good, but I was surprised by how cheesy it was, even with only half the called for cream cheese.  I followed others' suggestions about roasting the squash first, instead of trying to cut a hard squash into little cubes.  Simply sliced it in half lengthwise, and put on greased pan in oven at 375 degrees for 45 minutes.  Other than that, I followed the recipe as written except only using one (8oz) package of cream cheese, being a tad scant on my pepper measurements (for the kids' sake), and using base instead of bouillon cubes. The kids liked it (which was a nice surprise,) but the overwhelming flavor was cheese, not squash.  I think this recipe should be called Cheesy Butternut squash soup.  I can't even imagine how cheesy it would have been with two bricks of cream cheese!  Anyway, overall this soup was good, but just not what I was expecting.

I thought that this soup was AMAZING!!!  Perfect for a cold evening and complete comfort food!  It was really quick and easy as well!  I only used one package of cream cheese.  I'm sure it would have been creamier with two, but it was cheaper and healthier to cut it in half, and I wasn't disappointed.  I also added some "Better Than Bouillon" to it to add flavor and some garlic.  Very happy with the results!

I have made this recipe 3 times now and have finall figured out how I like it... I found a 2# container of cubed butternut squash at costco so that simplifies the recipe exponentially.  Because it's more squash (I found 2# = 9c. squash,) i just increase the rest of the recipe 1.5x.  I don't have dried majoram and found that I can sub with less oregano.  Also you could probably cut down the butter (who uses margarine??) so it's more calorie friendly... I don't have chicken buillon and used chicken stock instead (add in salt to taste if you do this!)  I also followed suit and cut the cream cheese and added in a little (light) sour cream!  Lastly, i only use a dash of cayenne and monitored the black pepper cuz I've found it can be overwhelmingly peppery otherwise.  For added spice, i use my best friend Tapatio to taste :)  the soup is thin, so i followed the directions on the side of the corn starch box on how to thicken my soup (though still a delicious thinner soup!)  I make this every other week since it freezes well, so i split the soup over 2weeks and freeze half of it. Super delicious!

Great beginning of a recipe.  Like others I cut the cream cheese in half and this was plenty.  I also used chicken stock instead of bouillon cubes and water.  I add fresh grated garlic salt and Tony Chachere's creole seasoning.  The soup was a big hit.  For a more hearty meal you can cook some small noodles in chicken stock and butternut squash puree and add it with chicken to the soup.  My husband loved this addition. Serve with corn bread and you have a complete meal.

I made this soup today and it was fabulous!  I looked over the reviews and made the following changes: butter instead of marg, used half the cream cheese, added a pinch of nutmeg, instead of bouillon, I used a product called, "Better than bouillon chicken base".  Thank you for sharing your recipe!

My family loved it, I substituted 1 package of Neufchatel cheese for the 2 packages of cream cheese.  My family all agreed it was cheesy enough with 1/3 less fat of the cream cheese.  Definitely will cook this one again!

Like others, I made a couple of changes.  I used two large butternut squash, a whole stick of butter to saute the onions, a whole cup of chopped onions, used 1/2 tsp Thyme instead of marjaram and doubled the pepper and cayenne, six cups of chicken stock.  I only used about a half an 8 oz package of cream cheese.  It was excellent!!

I made this for our neighborhood pot luck.....where it recieved rave reviews.  I made it per the recipe and it was terrific.  Next time, I will try to cut some of the cream cheese for a healthier version as others have suggested.  This is a delicious soup!

Excellent!  The changes I made were to roast the squash, onion and 4 cloves of garlic together, then sub 1 cup of apple juice for broth and use 4 oz. crm cheese. Sweet from the roasted veggies, great for kids!  Will make often.

FABULOUS with only a few minor changes.....definitely decrease cream cheese to 8oz. and use neufchâtel for healthier version. I added just a dash of nutmeg and about 1/3 c canned pumpkin (leftover from baking!). It is so good!!!

Followed this recipe to the tee. Not all that impressed. I might try it again, but it needs major tweaking. 4 boullion cubes is too much! It makes the soup very salty. I'll follow the advice of others and use chicken stock, and may try baking the pumpkin first.

Used chicken stock, 8 oz. low fat cream cheese and the soup was thick, creamy and filling.  The soup could use a little extra spicing.

I didn't have any onion so I just left it out.  I cut one butternut squash in half and drizzled it with olive oil, salt and pepper then laid each half cut side down on a cookie sheet and baked for 20 minutes at 375.  I dissolved 3 cubes of chicken bouillon in 2 cups water then added the peeled and cut up squash, nutmeg (didn't have any marjoram), and cayenne pepper.  I boiled this for a minute or two then scooped out the squash into the blender, using some of the liquid from the pan.  I blended this with 3/4 of 1 package cream cheese.  My mom and I loved it!  Sweet, creamy and just a little spicy.  I plan to freeze it to enjoy later.  Thanks for the recipe!

Made homemade broth with a rotisserie chicken carcass.  Gave this soup the most deepest rich flavor.  I only used 1 pkg. of cream cheese and it was plenty.  Silk smooth texture, LOVED this soup and very happy how well it turned out.

I have made this over and over and over, we love it that much!!! I too use only half the amount of cream cheese and it is perfect!!  I leave out the marjoram (hubby doesn't like it) and add in garlic, basil, oregano and parsley. I always make a double batch so we can have leftovers for lunch the next day. YUM!!

This is a yummy soup.  I have made it with and without the cream cheese.  Both were good, my boyfriend prefers it less creamy w/out the cheese added.  I like it a little thicker with the cheese.  Will try half the amount next time.  A very tasty soup either way.

This soup is very good !   I roasted the squash for about 45 minutes at 350 and then chopped it and saute'd it in the skillett before blending it with the cream cheese.  I also used about half the cream cheese as called for.
 Note: When decreasing the cream cheese you will need to decrease the water some and then add as needed while cooking the soup. If the soup is too runny, just cook until it thickens to desired consistency.

This was VERY good!! I only used 1 package of the cream cheese and I did add about a cup of some mashed potatoes that I had left over in the fridge.  I used a hand held blender and it was so flavorful.  Great to have on hand during Lent for Friday lunch.  Thanks!

I never write a review, but this recipe deserves one!!  This soup is so hearty and DELICIOUS!!  Leftovers freeze well, but let's be honest, there won't be any leftovers.  I always roast the squash in the oven with some olive oil and sea salt to bring out the flavor.  I have found that 1 package cream cheese usually works and makes the soup super creamy!!  Is it bad to crave squash soup??  mmmmmmmm :)

This was absolutely delicious. I've never made this type of soup before. But I had bought the cubed, ready to use box of butternut squash from Costco and needed to use it up. I read through the reviews and based upon the majority of the reviews, I used only one package of cream cheese and used chicken stock instead of bouillion. I also added a couple of turns of freshly grated nutmeg at the end. I used my immersion blender because frankly, I hate the whole process of moving from one container to the other. I also cooked it longer, more like 30 minutes, before adding the cream cheese. I think this soup is adaptable in many ways, using an apple, white wine etc. I'd give this recipe a 4 1/2 stars if I could. Give it a try!

SO CREAMY!  I used a stick blender right in the pot to puree the cooked squash and the onion.  Added only 1 package of cream cheese (it was plenty) and used the stick blender again....smooth as silk!  I also added a touch of nutmeg then sprinkled just a tad of cinnamon & sugar as a garnish.  So quick and definitely delicious.

I love butternut squash soup but can never get it to come out just right. This one was easy but I changed it to fit my tastes. I don't like spicy- I prefer sweet, so I skipped the spices and added brown sugar while the squash was boiling. Being vegetarian I changed the chicken bullion to veggie broth. When the squash was real soft I put a few ladles full in a bowl with a package of cream cheese & blended with a hand mixer. I kept adding ladles full of squash until all was blended then put it back in the pot and cooked on low for about 15 minutes. SO SWEET and GOOD!! The cream cheese was what I've been missing all these years!

This is really good. I also cooked the squash in the oven first.  It is so much easier peeling and cubing.  Also, I only used one package of cream cheese.  I think the 2nd package would have made it to creamy and overpowered the squash.  I did still use the same measures of all other ingredients. The family loved it.  My dad asked for the recipe to make for friends!  I will make this again and again.

Very good recipe. It was very thick even with only one cream cheese so I ended up thinning it out with some milk. I also added 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper for a little more spice.

I only needed 1 squash, because that was give or take 5.5 cups. I peeled it then hollowed it out with a grapefruit spoon like I would a pumpkin, even taking an extra layer off of the stringy part. Then I chopped it into 2 or 3 inch pieces. But, since it's being boiled I definitely think it should be chopped smaller. Really though, the bigger pieces didn't make a difference.  I followed the recipe to a T, boiling everything (but cheese) for 20 min. Then I put half in the processor with 8oz of cream for about 2 min. Moved it to a side container and did the same with the other half.   It had way too much cream cheese! I really only used 1.75 containers, because my instinct said it would be too much cream cheese. It really overpowers the squash.  This recipe may be worth trying again someday if I cut the cream cheese by 1/4, and maybe add more from there.

Yummy! Made a few alterations based on other reviewers' suggestions. Oven roasted squash first, cut in half, olive oil, garlic powder @ 350 for 50 mins. Increased chopped onion to 9 tbsp & added 3 cloves minced garlic. Used olive oil instead of margarine (healthier). My whole squash was more like 5 cups but it still worked. Used 3 cups organic vegetable broth, no chicken bullion & only 1 8oz pkg of cream cheese. WOW! So yummy!

Savory, creamy, rich and complex.  This soup is very good and very easy.  I had some left over chunked butternut squash that I used for a different soup recipe (we did not like that one!) so I was looking for something that I could do with it, with other ingredients that I had on hand.  I had already boiled the butternut squash, so followed the recipe, except I did not cook it all together for 20 minutes.  I just put it all together, carefully measuring out the right measurements of squash and water.  I put it all in the blender and had wonderful soup in about a minute.  This is seriously like a five star restaurant soup recipe, it would be wonderful served in demitasse cups as a starter to a meal.  Thanks for posting, I will use this recipe again and again!

I made this exactly as directed (except for subbing veggie stock). The flavor was good but the consistency was a little goopy. If I were to make it again, I would do half cream cheese and half milk.

I have made this soup once a week for the past 4 weeks. The girls from work love it. I have to admit I have changed it a bit.  1. Roasted butternut squash (cut in half, clean out seeds, rub with olive oil, place face down on cookie sheet, roast 350 degrees for 30-40 min or until easily pierced with a fork.  2. At the same time I roasted a whole clove of garlic and added it to the soup. ( cut top off with knife, sprinkle with olive oil, wrap in foil. roast same temp and time as squash) 3. I used chicken broth not bouillion. 4. Used half the cream cheese. 5.  Added garnishes... green onions, bacon, and grated cheese. 6. Used a immersion hand blender in the same pot!!   Feel free to add in this recipe. I have used apples and white wine too!!  This recipe is a must try and share with friends!!

Yum. Good base recipe. I took the advice of others and roasted the squash in the oven with garlic cloves. I used an immersion blender to puree everything in the pan and it worked a lot better than the blender method. The soup wasn't nearly as gritty as the first time I made it.

I am sitting here on a Autumn Sunday afternoon eating this soup, and it couldn't be more perfect. I too took some suggestions from others experiences.  I only use 1/4 of 8oz pkg of cream cheese since I find any more makes it too rich.  I first roasted the squash which made prep work so much easier.  I also find the soup a little thick, so I add about 3/4 c of additional chicken stock at the end.  Just enough to thin it a bit. My favorite soup!  Hope you enjoy.

I have never made anything like this, and it was not only easy, but wonderful!   I roasted the squash first for about 50 minutes, then scooped it into my other ingredients.  I used chicken broth (made with powder and water) and cut down the cream cheese to only one package.  It was delicious and everybody raved about this fantastic soup.   Thanks for sharing, Mary!!  :)

Tastes like heaven, and it doesn't hurt that it looks like nacho cheese sauces."  14 yr old daughter's comment.  "Mom, you should makeke this EVERY night!"  11 yr old daughter's comment.    LOL, thought I'd get this all to myself!!  I did roast 2 butternut squash, unseasoned, and only used 1/2 of an 8oz brick of Neufchatel cheese, otherwise made recipe as written (oh, except used only about 1 tbsp butter to saute onions).  Delish!

I loved this recipe!  I opted not to add cream cheese and instead scooped in a tablespoon of low fat sour cream.  I also added a sweet potatoe.  To speed up cooking time, I cut the squash lengthwise and cut up the sweet potatoe and microwaved it for 15 mins on high in a small dish with about 1 cm of water in it.  It comes out soft.  I just peeled it and used a potatoe masher in the pot to mash it all up.  It was amazing!! Even my kids gobbled it up:)

Really enjoyed making (and eating) this last winter. It's a versatile recipe; I easily made it both vegetarian and relatively healthy. Threw together a quick veg stock with vegetables I had on hand. Followed some other reviewers' advice and roasted the squash cut in half and face down (@350, 45min). Allowed it to cool, peeled it easily. Omitted the cream cheese. Added a dollop of fat free Greek yoghurt on top along with a sprinkling of fresh thyme. Roommates and I are looking forward to making this again soon!

Ahmazing.  I've never done a squash soup before, and don't have a food processor, so I was a bit worried.  I shouldn't have been, a blender works fine.  This recipe was super easy!  I added some garlic with the onions, used coriander because I didn't have any marjoram and doubled the black pepper, so it definitely has a kick.  I also used less than 4 ounces of cream cheese and it's plenty creamy!    I try to only eat meat a couple of times a week, so this will quickly become one of my filling winter staples!

I also roasted my squash first, so much easier. And instead of a blender or processor, I used my immersion blender and it worked like a charm, and less clean up! My husband, not a big soup fan, went back for seconds! Said it was excellent! Thanks!

Delicious soup. My blender with the glass jar kicked the bucket, so I got out the potato masher instead and mashed it in the pot, then added the cream cheese. I've had this recipe 'blendered' before, and mashing did not detract from the overall soup at all. It came out fairly smooth. I used homemade chicken stock, and one package of light cream cheese, and it was just right. I also didn't have any marjoram, so I substituted with oregano and a smidgen of thyme and sage (dried leafy, not powdered). Great soup, will definitely make again.

I liked it a lot, the rest of the family thought it tasted too much like cream cheese.  Lovely texture.  Froze the leftovers as individual servings and those came out a little thicker, a little spicier, maybe even better than the original servings.  If frozen, reheat very slowly - don't let it boil!

I made this last night with 1/2 the cream cheese, very good.   I warmed up left-over for lunch today and topped it with grated cheese and oven dried cherry tomatoes.  Nice!

Excellent! Only modification I made was I used only 1.5 bricks of cream cheese and they were 1/3 reduced fat. Still very creamy and rich, but slightly more figure friendly! Excellent cozy soup for those brisk fall days.

Very good- although I completely agree that you really only need maybe 2oz of cream cheese, if any.  I put in 4oz, and I thought that was even a bit much.  I roasted the squash in the oven with olive oil, garlic, salt & pepper, then followed the other reviewer's advice about adding a bit of apple cider and nutmeg while cooking it down on the stove with the 3c water, chicken bouillon and spices.  I also made "spiced pumpkin seeds" from the squash seeds to top the soup with, and those were fantastic!!

This was delicious! To make it even easier, cut the squash in half, and place it cut side down in a baking pan with about an inch of water.  Cover and bake at 350 F for about an hour or hour and a half. This will make it so much easier than trying to peel it!  When cool, scoop the insides out into a blender or food processor and combine with the cream cheese to puree.  Add this to the other ingredients and heat through. I  used chicken broth instead of water and boullion and used a little crushed red pepper instead of cayenne. I also used only one package of light cream cheese. This was quite easy and truly delicious!

This recipe has WAY too much cream cheese.  I am surprised that so many people gave it 5 stars and then commented that they cut the cream cheese in half.  After seeing all the 5 star reviews, I made it exactly as the recipe instructed (without reading the reviews).  It would have been more helpful to me if people gave the review less stars so that people would read the explanations/suggestions before attempting the recipe.

Yum LOVED this!  I added some salt (because I salt everything) and added a tiny bit more cayenne pepper.  It was amazing.  This is my first experience with butternut squash and what a good experience it was.  I also roasted my squash in a buttered casserole dish for and hour and then peeled the skin and cut into cubes the night before.  It was really quick to throw the ingredients together and heat everything through the next night.  It was really rich and I probably wouldn't serve with a heavy meal. I had mine alongside the black bean veggie burger from this site.

I give this 5 stars, because it was absolutely delicious and super easy to make. I also split the squash in half, scooped out the seeds, and roasted the pieces at 350 until tender (about 35 minutes since I used 2 smaller squash). Once that was finished and scooped out of the skins, it took barely any time to put the soup together. I added a little more than 1/8 tsp of cayenne, thinking it wouldn't make a huge difference and I love cayenne pepper.. but it was quite spicy. I still found it enjoyable, but next time I think I'll stick to the recipe on that one for the sake of others eating it.

I've made this many times. The nice thing about this recipe is, the measurments don't have to be exact.  One nice size squash equals about 4 cups.  I use 3 cups of broth and only 4oz of cream cheese.  I like to season mine with nutmeg, curry powder, white pepper and thyme. It took me a few times to figure out why mine was grainey. I have found that blending in a blender, in small batches rather than a food processer will make a smooth (not grainy) soup.

I am rating it a 4 because I only added one pkg. cream cheese and it was way more than enough for the soup.  I think two pkgs. would make the cheese overpower the squash flavor.  Very delicious! This is our new favorite.

Yummy! My husband and I loved it. I only used 1 package of cream cheese, but i think next time I will use even less. It was a bit to creamy for me still. oh yeah, and only 3 cubes of bouillon is really necessary for my taste.

My husband and I love this recipe. It can be served as a main dish as it is very filling.  My husband was a tad concerned about how much cream cheese must have been in the soup to give it such a delicious, rich and creamy taste, but I actually only used 1/8 of the cream cheese called for! He was very pleasantly surprised as something in life that tasted so good is also healthy!!

A huge success at our New Years party!! Definitely roast your squash!! I roasted them for about an hour at 350 degrees brushed with olive oil, garlic, salt, and pepper.  I also sauteed the onion, and substituted chicken stock instead of water. I Doubled the recipe and omitted one pkg of cream cheese (used 3 instead of 4pks.)  Amazing and addicting!!

My family and I didn't expect to like this soup at all. We have never been lovers of butternut squash or thick soups but were willing to give it a try. We were very happy we did. I can't say that it is the best thing I have ever eaten which is why I am giving it a 4 star rating but is close. Everyone should try it, maybe it will be a 5 with you.

AMAZING recipe, thank you!!!  I only had half the amount of cream cheese recommended and it was perfect. I didn't have cayenne OR marjoram; I added chili powder and rosemary. I roasted the squash first as some suggested.

I'm a huge fan of butternut squash soup and had never tried one with cream cheese. I LOVE cream cheese and was really excited about this recipe. It was just ok..not worth the extra calories imo. Oddly bland. I agree with other reviewers re: tweaks (roast squash, throw in a pear or apple, use half the cream cheese, alter spices, etc.) Before you add the cream cheese, puree it and get yourself a cupful..swirl in a spoonful of plain yogurt. It add awesome depth and creaminess.

I made this for my fiance and she LOVED it.  I tweaked the recipe much like someone else who commented.  I didn't use any cream cheese.  I halved and seeded two butternut squash.  I roasted them for a hour at 350 degrees with olive oil, garlic, salt, and pepper.  After the squash was finished roasting I sauteed the onion, and I used chicken stock instead of water.  I also added 1 cup of apple cider and a granny smith apple.  I added slightly more cayenne pepper because we like the spice.  I'll definitely make this soup again!

Even better the next day!!! I coated in olive oil and roasted the squash and 5 cloves of garlic in the oven face down at 350 for one hour. I used half the cream cheese as many have mentioned.. Added a bay leaf and the roasted garlic and simmered all ingredients for 30 minutes. strained out solids and served hot!!! So good. A real crowd pleaser. Used sodium free stock. Total winner!

Delish!! 1 pkg cream cheese is definately enough. I like to add about 1/2 tsp curry powder just to add a little depth to the flavour. I was asked to plant more butternut squash next year!

Our family did not like this very much. I roasted the butternut squash first, as other had suggested.  Was it  was rich? Yes!!! Was it bland? Yes.  I make a lot of homemade soups because my family loves soup, but I will not be making this one again, sorry.

Really good basic recipe, except I made a few changes.  I roasted the butternut squash, cut side down with a little olive oil, at 350 for 45 minutes.  I also roasted 2 cloves of garlic at 350 for 20 minutes.  I carmelized the onion in a saucepan.  After the squash and garlic were done, I peeled and cut the squash into large cubes.    I disolved the boullion cubes in hot water.  Then I put roasted squash, roasted garlic, carmelized onion, and 1/2 cup heavy whipping cream and pureed, adding boullion water slowly.  I poured the puree into a stock pot on the stovetop and simmered while I seasoned with salt, pepper, cayenne, pinch of thyme, pinch of cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg.    I served with grilled chicken and swiss sandwiches for a warm meal on a snowy night.  My husband and son loved it!

Warm, creamy, and tasty with a little kick. I used half the cream cheese and served it as a side to broiled garlic chicken, along with some crusty loaf. Delicious!

This was oh so yummy.  I took the advise and only put in one stick of cream cheese.  I'll be looking to try to reduce the fat in future batches.

This was INCREDIBLE.  Like others that have reviewed this recipe, I used chicken broth instead of the water and bouillon.  I roasted the butternut (halved, brushed with olive oil, flesh side down) and then pureed it with my food processor.  I used two cans of chicken broth and a cup of apple cider.  Everything else, was the same, except I used more cayenne.  Again, INCREDIBLE.  Love this.

Wow, this soup was delicious! I disagree with the reviews claiming it was bland, I thought it had the perfect amount of seasoning--more would have obscured the delicate squash flavor. The only changes I made was 1/2 the cream cheese as many have suggested, butter instead of margarine, and broth instead of bullion cubes. I made part of it with vegetable broth to accommodate my vegetarian sister and the difference was barely detectable. I took this soup to a party and received lots of compliments on it, and I will definitely make it again--a very cozy soup!

Awesome! I didn't add the second block of cream cheese and definitely wouldn't recommend doing that. I can imagine the soup would taste too cream-cheesy.

Our dinner party was raving about this! We had some tasty bread to dip in the soup, but honestly it seemed like it took away from the amazing flavor! Changes we made: We used butter instead of margarine, chicken broth instead of water & boullion, and neufchatel instead of cream cheese. We microwaved the squash before cutting it into small peices and throwing it into the pot. After we added all the ingredients, I smashed the squash with one of those potato mashers (still in the pot). We added the cheese directly to the pot, and it melted right in. We also added some orange peel for flavor. Definitely will be making this again, many times!

So disappointed with this soup after reading all the reviews.  I followed the advise of others and cut down to 1 package of cream cheese.  It tastes like butternut squash flavored cream cheese.  All I could taste is cream cheese.  If you're not a big fan of cheese, this is definitely not the soup for you.  I've had much better butternut squash soup elsewhere.

Don't change a thing!! (except only use 1 bar of cream cheese) Have made this many times as it's so easy and the taste is superb, so good you'll wish you could glug it right from the pan... but use some restraint, serve in bowls (especially tasty topped with some homemade seasoned croutons), and you'll wish you had made a double batch.  Some reviewers prefer to bake the squash, but in early fall when the weather is still so warm I would rather not heat up the oven so the stovetop works for me! Thanks so much, this one is definitely a keeper!

Fantastic. Hubby and I agree it is the best soup we have ever had. I made it just like the recipe except used 1 brick of cream cheese (Neufchatel for 1/3 the fat) instead of 2.

NASTY!!  The cream cheese completely ruined it.  I though it would complement the flavor, but it was just sweet soup with a horrible cream cheese tang fighting the flavor of the squash.  We flat out could not eat this.

This soup is fantastic.  I have craved it ever since the last time I made it about a month ago and plan to make it again this evening.  I followed other reviewers suggestions to roast the squash first as well as to add apple and nutmeg while cutting the amount of cream cheese down to half a package.  I also added ground ginger.  Even though I made several changes, I am rating this at five stars because I think the addition of cream cheese is absolutely brilliant.

Oh, this was wonderful! I made it for company and it got rave reviews...one guest said it was "gourmet restaurant quality"! I served it with a 1/4 canned pear in the middle, and tossed a bit of fresh parsley over it. I only used 1 cream cheese, but used half and half cream to get the consistency I wanted, and I used butter and 1 whole med onion (just because we love them)and about 10C of squash, as we needed the quantity.

This is true quality!! You will NOT be disappointed in this recipe...I've already sent it out to two couples from last night! ENJOY!

Just wonderful.  I followed the advice of others...baked the squash.  I used something other than butternut.  I used 1/4 the cream cheese.  I put everything in the blender except the broth.  Let it chill over night, then thinned with the chicken broth as I reheated it for quests.  They were scraping the pot for every last drop!

This soup was wonderful.  I tweaked it a little.  I used 1 squash, quartered and roasted for 45 min at 350. Then I cooled it, skined and chopped it. Added it to a pan with about 2 1/2 cup chicken broth, 4 T butter, 1/2 t pepper, 1/4 t nutmeg, 1/8 t cayenne, and dash salt.  I also added half of a diced granny smith apple.  I let that all cook for a while, then used the potato masher, and let it cook a while more.  I cooled it then pureed it in the blender.  Back to the stove, added maybe 1/2 c cream and heated back up.  YUMMY!!  Even DH who swears he hates squash said he would eat again.

So easy and delicious! 

Used cream cheese substitute for a dairy allergy - Tofutti, about 4 oz - so good.

Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.

I've been making this recipe for about 2 years now, and it's a fall/winter favorite!  I usually only put 1 block of cream cheese in (it thickens as you refrigerate it and seems to be thicker next time you reheat it).  I also use chicken broth instead of the cubes and water.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Just made this soup tonight!  Perfect night for it since it's pouring rain here.  I used butternut squash from my garden (which worked out well since I didn't know what to do with it!!).  I also only used about 1/4th of the cream cheese and it was perfect!  My husband said this is the best soup he has ever had!!

Everyone absolutely love this recipe.  I entertain a group that tends to be picky about the sides that I serve but tends to enjoy my main course.  Today, almost everyone asked for a second portion of the soup, and no one didn't complete the first portion.  I followed the recipe as listed, but only used one 8oz. pack of cream cheese after reading some of the other reviews.  It was VERY creamy with just the one, and I would consider tasting the soup first if you plan to add the second.  This is an all around winner!

This was incredibly good.  Just as good as any 5-star restaurant.  I used 1/2 the cream cheese (could have actually cut down just a bit more), added about 1/2T of brown sugar (probably didn't even need it), and added a bit more cayenne pepper, and about 1/8 tsp of nutmeg.  Yum!!  And, so easy!!  Oh, I also used pre-cut butternut squash (thank you Whole Foods) and roasted it instead of boiling it.

This recipe was delicious!!!  I used half the cream cheese like other readers suggested.  I think the amount the recipe calls for would have been too much. I slow roasted the squash in the oven after brushing it with olive oil.  It smelled yummy!  Nuking it in the microwave would have been faster, but the microwave is known to zap some of the vitamins and minerals out of food, so I opted for the longer process.  I added ~ 1 1/2 tablespoons of minced garlic, 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, 1/4 teaspoon of ginger, and 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg to give it more flavor.  It came out a little too thick for what I'd call soup, so I thinned it with lowfat milk.  It was just the bomb!  My picky family asked for seconds!

Not even sure how I came upon this recipe, I'm not a big squash fan.  But I'm glad I did!  The only changes I made: I used 4 cups of chicken stock for the water and I only used 1 package of cream cheese.  We both really enjoyed this soup.  Will make again.  Thanks!

Easy and Very YUMMY!  After reading the reviews, I only used one block of cream cheese (and I used light!) and it came out just fine.  Also substituded chicken stock for water.  Everyone loved it.

This is so good!  I picked up a bag of already peeled and cut squash at Costco that yielded exactly 6 cups.  I used chicken stock in lieu of cubes and water, I also added 1/2 cup of apple cider.  I only used one package of cream cheese and found that to be plenty.

What a flavor!  I didn't make any changes except using 3 cups broth instead of water and buillon.  Blend it really well for it to be smooth. HOWEVER- there is no way this makes 6 servings unless they are very small servinges.  We ate it with a side salad and it only made about 3.5 servings.

Wow!  This soup was incredible!  I followed others advice and roasted the squash and used a hand emersion blender to break down the clumps.  My husband is a meat and potatoes guy, so I served it with toasted beef sandwiches, but it was hearty enough for me to eat as a meal.  (I used the 2 pkgs of cream cheese which made it thick and very creamy) 
Thanks so much for sharing this great recipe!   

I also tried this recipe with canned pumpkin instead of squash and it turned out great!  I added a little bit of brown sugar, some ginger and cinnamon and it was a huge hit!  The pumpkin made a slightly thinner soup, but could have also been because of light cream cheese.  Either way it was delicious!!   Thanks for sharing the recipe!!!

Loved this recipe!!!! Great meal to start off the fall season. I really got a lot of information from the other reviews and followed along. I used skim milk riccota cheese instead of cream cheese..still had the full richness without the extra fat from butter and cream cheese. Will make this again!

Delicious. I used two small pumpkins instead of the butternut squash, roasted them in the oven at 375 for an hour. I sauteed the onion and one clove of minced garlic in 1 TBS olive oil instead of the margarine. I brought all the other ingredients (3 cubes vegetable bouillon instead of chicken) up to a boil, then added the scooped out roasted pumpkin, brought back to a boil, let simmer for about 5 minutes, then added the neufchatel, which I halved per the other reviewers' comments. Next time I will go a bit less still...I think 6 oz will be about perfect. I did add a touch more cayenne and black pepper after I tasted it. It was delicious. I really agree with everyone else: I can't imagine this with the full amount of the cream cheese, which is why I gave it 4 stars. But it was a hearty and satisfying meal with some salad and french bread. Will definitely be making it again.

I made this for my family and they went out of their gourds over it. However I omitted one of the cream cheeses and added about 1/2 cup of half-and-half instead. I also baked my squash halves (open-side down 350 for 1 hour)instead of peeling and saute-ing. Much easier to scoop out the cooked squash mush than to peel and dice and I think the roasted flavor adds to the richness. Definitely will make this one again!!!

This soup doesn't really need another review.  Obviously many people think it's outstanding!  I agree!!  It's wonderful.  My daughters and my husband love it as well.  I have used half the amount of cream cheese, it's still fantastic!

This soup is awesome - we've been making it for years!  We now substitute frozen butternut squash.  It's so much easier and you can't taste the difference.

This had a good flavor, but it was sooooo thick and rich, even after I cut the amount of cream cheese in half!! I cannot imagine using the whole 16 ounces. I will probably find a different recipe if I want to make butternut squash soup again.

I made the terrible mistake of forgetting about the reviewers' advice by the time I made this soup, and ended up dumping it down the disposal. This is cream cheese soup with butternut squash coloring, and I'm usually a girl who can eat cream cheese by the spoonful. If I ever attempt any butternut squash soup recipe again, I will use one that doesn't even have cream cheese in the ingredients list. Thanks for the opportunity to try it, though. Shame on me for not following the great advice!

I decided to make this soup at the last minute for Thanksgiving. So glad I did. It was EXCELLENT in taste however, I could see as I was adding the cream cheese that it was getting to be thicker than I would prefer it  to be so I cut back about 4 ounces. Other than that, I can say it was a great choice for a holiday or any day day soup.

I followed many suggestions and used half the cream cheese.  However, I think it was still a little too cheesy.  I may try it again, but with 1/4 of the cream cheese, or maybe none at all.

This is just amazing to taste.  I had no idea it would be so very good.  I had to make it again the next day.  And I ended up having a small amount left over that thickened in the fridge.  The next day family was using it as a dip with pumpernichel bread....and the thickened soup was perfect for that too.  It is a great recipe.

Never knew I liked squash 'til I made this!  I followed the other reviewers' advice and cut the cream cheese in half.  I also didn't have marjoram, so I substituted curry and it was delicious.

With an overabundance of butternut squash, I decided to try this because it sounded different.  I am so glad I did and even more so, glad I read the reviews first. I too also used 1/2 the amount of cream cheese and might use even less next time. I let everyone choose the amount of cayenne pepper they prefer. Next time I will try and leave it a bit chunky for some texture.

Now this is GREAT soup - I used 4 oz of cream cheese and 1/2 cup fat free yogurt, but I'd love to try the 2 8 oz pkgs of cream cheese - but my waistline said no! (Though I may do it next time!!)

Yummy! As per other reviewers suggestion, I cut the squash in half lengthwise, scooped out seeds, drizzled olive oil, salt & pepper and roasted for 45 mins. at 350. I peeled the skin off before pureeing. Next time I might try the microwave for mid-week cooking. I also used chicken broth instead of bouillon. Didn't have the cayenne pepper so I added just a dash of chili powder. As others have suggested, I used one package of cream cheese & it came out splendid.

So rich and such a hit! In Chile, we could only find Hubbard squash to use, and it was fantastic. We'll find out this Thanksgiving how it's different w/ butternut squash. I cut down the cream cheese and add peeled  chunks of red pepper after it's all mixed.  Also, sometimes we save some broth for a thiner soup.

Spectacular! Ok, per other member's suggestions, I added garlic and celery. I used only one package of cream cheese. When it was done, the flavor was great, but it was WAY too rich. I added milk until it became soupy enough for me. Next time I will add broccoli.

i like this soup, but do think it has something missing. i added some nutmeg and cinnamon per other posters, and it livened up a little.  and be careful with the onion, i its flavor almost overpowers the soup. however, i think some flavored, herb bread dipped in it will be perfect!!   but certianly a beautiful soup because of the deep orange color. add some sour cream swirls and some greenery, and you have  beautiful dish!!

Good recipe - I rated a 4 instead of a 5 because I cannot imagine how thick it would be if I had followed it exactly and used a pound of cream cheese!!!  I had a couple cups extra of squash, so adjusted the amounts as necessary.  It was quite thick even before I added the cream cheese - about the consistency of heavily whipped potatoes.  So I just went with 4 ounces, and still had to add about a cup of water to thin it out.  I generally like a thick and hearty soup, but it was just too thick.  Good flavor, though!  I think next time I may try adding some buttermilk instead of the cream cheese to get the tangy taste.

This was a great and hearty recipe.  Make sure you roast the squash first until it can easily be removed from its skin.  I omitted the cream cheese and added 1/2c of light cream instead.  I also added pinches of nutmeg and cinamon to really bring out the flavour.  It makes a lot so it's great for dinner parties or to freeze.  Enjoy!

Excellent, smooth and creamy soup...but I had to use only half of the cream cheese that was recommended.  To make it slighly healthier, I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and it was delicious!  I made homemade flatbread seasoned with the marjoram and cayenne to complement the flavor of the soup.

Great soup! Perfect for a chilly autumn day. Used some suggestions and roasted 2 lg. butternut and a lg. onion for about an hour, until I could see the squash start to brown. In a blender pureed squash, onion, cream cheese along with 4 tablespoons butter, and a 48oz can of chicken stock. By the way, 1 package of cream cheese was enough to make it thick and creamy. I was a little heavy handed with the peppers but I do like it spicey.. :-) Made 8 qts and sent some to Mom, sis and the neighbors.  All agreed it hit the spot. Made it twice before writing the review.  Thanks and enjoy.

SO GOOD!! This recipe is awesome! I don't use all the cream cheese, about 1 1/2 packages is perfect. I also love to serve it with a dollop of sour cream (the warm soup and the cold sour cream are great together) and spinkle it with cinnamon... try it next time!
*UPDATE: Still making this recipe after 2 years... still love it!

YUK! WHY IN THE WORLD I WOULD EVEN BOTHER TO MAKE THIS TO BEGIN WITH, IS BEYOND ME----DON'T KNOW WHAT I WAS THINKING. I GUESS SEEING ALL THE "RAVE REVIEWS" MOST LIKELY. SQUASH IS AN OK VEGGIE & THESE "TRENDY" SOUPS SOMETIMES SURPRISE YOU. HOWEVER, IT WAS PRETTY TASTELESS, & NOT MUCH DIFFERENT TASTING THAN IF YOU JUST EAT SQUASH ON A PLATE  TO BEGIN WITH! I AM AN AVID COOK,& GOURMAND----WHY ALL THE RAVINGS OVER THIS IS BEYOND ME. JUST THICK, TASTELESS SQUASH. SORRY, GOTTA BE HONEST.

Excellent.  I loved this soup.  I took the advice of others and only used one package of cream cheese.  I think it would be too thick if you used two.  I also put the cubes of squash in the oven for about 20 minutes while preparing the other ingredients.  I'm not sure if that made a difference, but the flavor of the soup was excellent.  Thanks for sharing.

This soup is absolutely amazing!! I didn't roast the squash like some suggest, just peeled it and cut it up. I didn't have any marjoram or cayenne so I didn't add it, but I did add some salt and parsley. I also added a cubed potato and 2 cut up carrots. I also made it once where I added a zucchini. It was very delicious and I only used about 3 tablespoons of light cream cheese- still nice and creamy (but it also tastes good without any cream cheese at all). You could probably cut up and add other vegetables too, like red peppers, and it would taste great! One tip though: you can use other varieties of squash other than butternut, but choosing one with a smooth skin, rather than grooved or bumpy skin, makes it much easier to peel. Thanks Mary!

This soup was fantastic! I used one block of cream cheese but that is because I increased the servings a bit. I ended up using two good size butternut squashes, roasted in the oven cut side up in two baking dishes with a quarter inch of water and covered with foil. I sprayed them with butter spray and sprinkled on kosher salt, pepper and garlic powder. Roasted at 400 for an hour until tender. I used 3 cans of roasted garlic flavored chicken broth. Next time I won't even need to bother with the onions and butter and saved calories to boot. The flavored chicken broth gives it plenty of good flavor. It was excellent and everyone at the party I took it too really enjoyed it.

At long last!  I've been looking for a great squash soup recipe and this is what I've been searching for.  As others have mentioned, definately cut back on the cream cheese.  I used a single block and still found this to be a VERY thick soup.  I will start with a half block next time and add more, as desired, while blending.  Great flavours!

I love this.... though, I only use 8 ounces of FAT FREE cream cheese.  It is also great with sweet potatoes, instead of the squash.  I've made it with and without the cayenne.  I like it both ways, but be sure to use the marjoram, that flavor really so good with the mellowness of the squash.

Yum!  I definitely cut the cream cheese in 1/2, though.  And used 1 pkg frozen squash instead of fresh.  All I had on hand.  =).  Don't overdo the cayenne, either.  It adds quite a kick.  A VERY impressive starter for an elegant dinner.  I served it in clear bowls with parsley sprinkled on top.  Beautiful!  And tasty. Thanks!

Thanks for this recipe.  It's easily the best soup I've ever had. We've been making it all year.   We cut the cream cheese to only 1 package and roasted the butternut squash then scooped it out.  We blend the soup with a hand blender or a mixer and it's PERFECT.  By far our favorite soup and everyone who we've made it for has loved it and asked for the recipe.  Thanks, Mary!

I did this two nights before Thanksgiving and it was well received with my dinner:)  I had some two days after and thought the flavor was even better!  I sliced the butternut squash in half and rubbed olive oil, garlic and salt and pepper and backed in the oven as recommended.  I only used half of the cream cheese too.  Yummy:)

I have made this soup for the last three Thanksgiving's and is now my staple signature dish!  I use 8oz fat free cream cheese, to make it more healthy, and it still tastes wonderfully rich and creamy!  Thanks so much for an easy and tasty recipe.

yummy!  Reminds me of the pumpkin soup I had in Australia.  I used a whole butternut squash, an acorn squash, and some leftover canned pumpkin I had on hand.  Only added 1/2 of one block of cream cheese...still very rich and smooth!  Would be excellent served chicken enchilada soup-style- just add some cumin, cooked chicken, and top with cheddar cheese and tortilla chips.  Mmmmm!!!

Very good soup.  I only added 6 ounces of cream cheese and it was still great.  Also, instead of pureeing the soup in batches, I just stuck my hand-held blender right into the pot and pureed the whole thing in a few seconds.

This recipe is so wonderful, definitely a favorite, definitely a keeper.  I have made it several times and find I prefer it without the cayenne. I use white pepper instead of black, add a teaspoon of brown sugar, and use fat-free cream cheese (not nearly as rich, so you can use the full amount).  I then sprinkle on a little dried parsley for color, top it with a dollop of fat-free plain yogurt (a mild brand like Dannon), and not only does it taste incredible, it is gorgeous soup to look at  - and healthy as well.  Everyone LOVES it, even people who hate the sound of the word "squash"!

This soup is EXCELLENT! I am pregnant and have had an extremely hard time eating food; so I have been quite wary of trying new recipes. This recipe had so many great reviews (and soup sounded so comforting) that I thought I should try it. I decided to follow the advice to use half as much cream cheese and it tasted TERRIFIC! I had a horrible time trying to put the extra soup away. Even though I was stuffed to the brim I still wanted to keep eating it because it is so delicious! This has already been added to my personal favorite recipe book that holds only the best recipes I have ever found. (I'm sure I'll soon have the recipe memorized and won't need the recipe at all.) I love it! Thank you so much for helping me enjoy eating again, Mary!

I can’t do anything right in my mother-in-laws eyes but she lapped up this stuff up and went for seconds.  I think it irked her that I concocted something she liked.  My wife is crazy about this soup and I’ve made it for her 3 times now.  I only use around 5 oz (little more than a half a cube) of the light cream cheese. It is naturally rich so don’t see the need to dump in a bunch of fat. I use caned chicken broth for the base.  I don’t dig it as much as my wife but she is absolutely nuts-o about it.

This was AWESOME, loved it. I used skim milk instead of water for a creamier texture and it probably didn't need to. The only bad thing is this is a very fattening recipe so use half the cream cheese or use low fat cream cheese. Non fat cream cheese, I just think tastes nasty but haven't tried it on this recipe. This is definitely a "comfort" food.

Really delicious! would definitely make again. only used 1 bar of cream cheese and it was plenty rich. my friends told me this soup tastes like something they would expect from a very fancy restaurant. it's so rich you can only eat a little but outstanding! wouldn't freeze again, doesn't taste the same the second time around

This soup was the hit of our Thanksgiving dinner! Roasting the squash was the best tip - careful not to burn it like I did, though - and only half the amount of cream cheese was needed. Next time I will cut out the cayenne and serve hot sauce on the side. Delicious.

This is a very good choice for first course on Thanksgiving!  If you're making it for a lot of people though, it is quite an undertaking.  I highly recommend the roasting of the squash beforehand and only using 1/2 the cream cheese.  I also used lite cream cheese and it still had a very creamy consistency.  I'm so glad I have leftovers!

This was excellent!   I have tried many other butternut squash soup recipes and most have apples or curry, which I am not fond of.  This was great, however, I did use only ONE cream cheese, as was suggested by many.  Two would definitely be too much!  I put a bit too much cayenne in it though and it's a bit "hot" even for me.  I'll measure it next time!!!   Now I'll have something good to do with the millions of squash we grew last summer.

The flavor is excellent!  Now on menu for housewarming. Not sure about the texture. Seemed a little mealy. I'm a squash novice, so maybe that's just the way squash is.  How the heck are you supposed to peel these things? Took me forever. My adaptations: 1/8 + teaspoons cayenne pepper, 2 beef boullion cubes and one chicken, pureed the onions too.

Fabulous soup - couldn't be easier.  I roasted the squash in the oven with some macintosh apples first and cut down the cream cheese.

Served this at a party and everyone loved it, even the people who claimed to "hate" squash.  I agree with only using half the cream cheese.

This is my new favourite soup! It's quick and easy and makes 
an absolutely scrumptious lunch served along with Dee's Health Bread 
and Jamie's Cranberry and Spinach Salad. I only used half the cream cheese
and it was creamy and delicious. Two pkgs. of cream cheese would have
been much too fatty and rich for my liking. Great recipe!

I precooked the squash and the onion in the oven, I only used 10 ounces
of the cream cheese, and I used two cans of chicken broth instead of the 
bouillon cubes and water.  I used a 'stick blender' to puree the soup.  I think 
that this soup is great eventhough I have never had squash soup before.  
Thank you, Mary, for sharing this recipe.

Outstanding! This was a wonderful soup that didn't last long around here. I would agree to 1/2 the cream cheese. I also added 1/2 apple, nutmeg, cinnamin and a little brown suger. It worked well with acorn squash too. Next time I'll try a little milk to thin it out a bit. It is really thick and creamy. A definate keeper! Try it.

This one of the very best squash soup recipes I've tried.  I did cut down on the cream cheese and only used 8oz's which I feel was just right.  I even served it one time using small pumpkins as dishes, which went over very big with my guests.

This was a great recipe.  I left out the cream cheese though, and added some garlic, ginger and a little bit of curry powder instead.  It was extremely creamy without having to add anything to make it creamy.  Very healthy and tasty!!!!!!!!!!

I wish I’d only put in one package of cream cheese. As it was it more like squash-flavoured cream cheese soup rather than creamy squash soup. It took a lot of doctoring but I finally got it to a great soup despite the cream cheese.

I used 1/4 of the cream cheese and that was plenty.  I would review some of the other comments before making again and try some of their tweaks.  Needs more flavor.

The only reason this recipe didn't get five stars is because I made some changes. I did 4 cups of water instead of three and I did half of one package of cream cheese. The cheese is very rich and over powering so half of one package was plenty.

After reading several of the earlier reviews, I cut the squash in half, put it cut side down on parchment paper in the microwave and cooked it for 8 minutes.  It had to cool briefly before I could handle it but it was then very easy to scoop out.  Although already cooked, I put it in the pan with the onion and butter and cooked it longer, then used a potato masher before I put it in the food processor.   I also used chicken broth rather than water and bouillon cubes and used less than half of the cream cheese.  We've just come from a cruise where I always love the soups they offer  -- as someone else said, even my husband likes this and now I plan to serve it for Thanksgiving.   :>)

However you make this soup you should save all the seeds and scrapings.  While the squash is cooking,  saute 2 or 3 minced shallots in some butter or oil for a few mins. till soft, then add the seeds and scrapings  and saute a couple mins. more ,  add 4-6 cups of water ,and bring to a boil, then simmer covered for 30 mins.  , strain out the seeds and add this broth to your finished soup before pureeing.  It will give it a lot of extra flavor.

Made a couple minor modifications, but it make this soup delicious! Here are the changes I made:

-cut squash into 6 pieces, coated with oil, salt, pepper & minced garlic & roasted at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for one hour
-added a chopped Apple & sautéed with onions
-added 3 sage leaves whole simmering & removed before blending
-used chicken broth plus 1 tsp Better Than Bouillon instead of water & bouillon 
-only used 4oz cream cheese
-garnished with Mexican crema & crumbled bacon

Was not disappointed!  I did reduce butter and cream cheese by 1/2 and used Neufchatel cheese in place of cream cheese (1/3 less fat).  Changed marjoram to thyme.   Added garlic croutons and a little pepper when served...delish!

I loved it have always wanted to make . I did make some changes. Instead of boiling squash i roasted mined flavor is bolder and sweeter when roasted. I added 1/3 cup of heavy cream and added the low sodium chicken broth a little at a time until I got the consistency I wanted. This is a keeper . Thanks

I loved this soup I brought it over for a girls night :)  I made a few changes.. I followed the advice of everyone only using half the desired amount of cream cheese as it was very creamy and thick with just one brick.  I also didn't have any marjoram so I added a few fall spices to mine to make it flavourful.  I added quite a lot of cinnamon,  a pinch of ground ginger,  a pinch of ground Clive's and also a few pinches of nutmeg I put them in all to taste,  but the Cinnamon is the most important so if you are going to add anything I would say Cinnamon is the game changer!  It was awesome and really easy to make!  Highly recommend this lovely soup!

The first time I followed the recipe exactly and it was good. I've made it several more times since then. Roast the squash with olive oil salt and pepper. It will be more flavorful and easy to scoop out of the skin. I sautéed the onion and spices in butter and added them to the soup. In my opinion, only one package on cream cheese is necessary. Chicken stock rather than bouillon and water will enhance the flavor.  An immersion blender makes quick work to purée.

Love this soup! It is easy to prepare and freezes well. I use cut up squash (organic from Costco). Since it is seasonal, I make several batches and freeze in Mason Jars. I put everything in the pot except the cream cheese and the milk that I add instead of so much cream cheese (I cut the cream cheese in half and add a cup of milk per batch). Once it is cooked, I put it in my food processor and then back to the stove to add the milk and cream cheese. Once it's blended, cool and into the jars...so easy! Great recipe!!!

My favorite soup by far! Couple of notes: you can use oregano if you don't have marjoram. One block of cream cheese is plenty. 

I'm going to sprinkle bacon and sour cream on top next time. Should go together so well!

I have made this recipe dozens of times for soup suppers at church during Lent, and it is my most requested recipe. I am a vegetarian, so used a Kosher "chicken" cube which contains neither meat nor gluten. (I've never asked what IS in it!) I only use half the cream cheese and have also found roasting the squash beforehand does make life a lot easier.

Loved this! It has become a household favorite. All I changed was halving the cream cheese as others suggested and because i am a vegetarian , I used vegetable broth.

Fantastic as written but also excellent with half the cream cheese. As a variation, I make mine with shallots instead of onions.

This was the first time I made squash soup, and I love butternut squash but this was very bland.  The texture was nice but just not a good taste.  No one in my family liked it.  Maybe we just don't like squash soup.

LOVE it!  I took the advice of baking the squash and using 1/2 of the cream cheese.  It turned out very yummy!  I can't wait to make this easy impressive dish again~

WONDERFUL---Easy to make, and the flavor is WOW. I followed the recipe exactly. There are suggestions here that one can take or leave. I am def. going to try roasting the squash for even more flavor, sure maybe less cream cheese is fine. I am thinking adding some shredded carrot next time and I believe this would be fantastic adding some crab too. That's whats great about this kind of recipe. Good as is, or have fun.

I had to convert this to metric (because I am in Italy) and I think I added too much water, so it was a bit liquidy. I halved the cream cheese as the recipe suggested as an option, and it was great. Follow th recipe exactly, because all the other suggestions are just personal preferences and won't really improve anything.

It was amazing! Amazing! My husband, who doesn't really like to eat any of the American soup I make even gave his approval. 

So In all, I don't think the proportions I used were dead on, but I can't wait to try again! Perfectly toasty for a cold winter night. I also may add some broccoli next time just to see how it turns out.

I baked the squash in the oven first and only used half the cream cheese, same as suggested in other reviews. Turned out awesome. Used a food processor the first time and an immersion blender the second... Blender was much easier and made it smoother.

I combined 2 Butternut Squash Soup recipes. Roasted 2 medium squash with 2 cloves garlic for about 45 minutes.  Meanwhile sautéed small onion, a carrot, a stalk celery in about 2 TB butter. Add salt. Let that sauté on low for about 15 minutes. Peeled and sliced thinly a potato and an apple. Added to veggies. Scooped the squash into pot along with roasted garlic. Then added chicken stock to cover plus about 1/2 cup apple cider. Brought to a boil and simmered for about 1/2 hour. Added little nutmeg and cayenne.  Added about 2 ounces lite cream cheese. Stirred till melted. Used immersion blender till smooth and creamy. Correct seasonings. I ended up adding about another 1/3 cup apple cider and little salt.

Terrible.  Two-8 oz blocks of cream cheese is just too much, so I used 1 1/2 blocks--still way too much.  Also, it was so terribly salty-four bouillon cubes is probably way too many.  Maybe I should have read more of the comments too, because if I had roasted the squash, maybe this soup wouldn't have tasted so bland.  I won't be trying this again.

Absolutely DELISH!!! As other reviewers suggested, I halved the squash, added olive oil, salt and pepper and put the cut side down on a baking sheet and cooked at 375 for 40 minutes. I also only used one 8 ounce cream cheese. AMAZING!!!

Thank you for sharing this amazing recipe, Mary! My family loved it. We've never had squash soup before now... This is going in the recipe hall of fame- one of my favorite soups ever! I only used one package of cream cheese and it was great- garnished with a sprinkle of crispy bacon pieces and a little dollop of sour cream.... Amazing!!

Wow! This is really good. Like others, I used one package of cream cheese and a little more cayenne pepper. I didn't have majoram on hand, but basil works wonderfully in this. I also had no chicken bouillon cubes so I used vegetable stock. This is easy to make and is now on my list of favorites.

Delicious! As others, I roasted the squash and pulled the skin off. Took about an hour for mine to get really soft. I used less water/bouillon initially as I knew I could always thin it out. I had no marjoram, so used 1/2 the amount called for of oregano but I don't believe it added any distinguishable flavor. I used half sodium-free and half regular bouillon cubes. Finally, I followed the advice to use half the amount of cream cheese and thought that was sufficient. It was pretty thick, so I ladled some into a container to freeze before thinning the whole batch. I then thinned with additional water/bouillon mixture and added cayenne to taste. I thought this was fantastic as it was, but we were at an event a few weeks ago where there were butternut squash soup shooters with a candied bacon piece. THAT was divine! Would be wonderful for entertaining!

I tried this last night and have to say like many others, I did add/change it. First, I cut out half the cream cheese (I'm not sure how I could it eat with two!) 
I also did not cook it the way it said to start. I cut thick slices of the squash and baked them with a little EV olive oil and sprinkled with garlic, cinnamon and cayenne. 

I used butter and not margarine (next I won't use so much either). Then I added low sodium chicken broth (about 3 cups but I should have added more because it felt a little thick). I think it depends in the size of the squash but mine was from the garden and huge! I used it all. 

Then I realized I didn't have marjoram so I just threw in whatever sounded good. More cayenne, cinnamon, a pinch of nutmeg and ginger and black pepper. 

The only other thing that I would do is chop the onions finer or blend them with the squash. It doesn't bother me but I know my mother wouldn't like onion chunks. 

Overall, this was so good and my first attempt was a hit with the hubby!

Like other reviewers, I used only 8 oz of cream cheese. Other than that small modification -- this recipe was absolutely perfect. It was sooooo delicious! As good or better than anything I've had in restaurants. 5 stars, for sure! I'm using this recipe when I want to impress someone!

This was a very easy recipe. I brought it to work for a function and had to hand out the recipe to a few people as well.  Listening to the other reviews, I cut the squash in half and put a little butter on it then baked it on a flat sheet with a little water in the bottom for an hour at 350 and it came out perfectly.  I also halved the cream cheese as one package was plenty and it turnes out really creamy.  Last change I made wasnt intentional. When I went shopping I forgot the broth, luckily I had some beef buillion at home and thought id give it a shot using that instead of chicken.  I havent made the original so I dont know if it was an improvement or not but it was amazing. Will definitely make this again. The cayenne gave it just the perfect touch.

I've made this soup twice this season. Delicious fall flavor. I used organic chicken broth and only 1 8oz package cream cheese. It does take quiet a bit of time to peel and cut up this hard squash, I do think baking the squash would cut down on the prep time greatly.

I made this soup Saturday.  I didn't add any spices due to personal preference, just salt to taste.  I used 4 cups chicken stock and one 8 oz package cream cheese.  I blended it using my immersion blender.  My husband and I just loved this soup!  I think I will make a big batch to serve on Thanksgiving!

This recipe was great but I think it calls for WAY too much cream cheese.  I started adding it and it was really thick so I stopped.  I ended up with about 3/4 of one container of cream cheese and it called for two.  I think it would have been way too rich thick with all of that cream cheese.  I also used butter because margarine is awful.

I followed the directions as they were provided and people raved about the soup.  One comment was that it was the best Butternut Squash soup they had ever had.  I made it for Canadian Thanksgiving this past weekend and since I bought extra squash, I'm making another batch tonight when I get home.  Amazing!

Substituted the low-fat cream cheese and also cut back by half a package for half a cup of half-and-half. Bit more onion and when my spice rack took a fall I forgot to add the chicken bullion! But the family didn't notice, and loved it all the same! Amazing, and wish I had more butternut to keep this soup in stock for the winter!

Like many people suggested, I did tweek the recipe .  I halved the squash ( used one squash) rubbed it with olive oil salt and pepper then baked face down 350 for 1hr not covered. After I removed the skin cubed it and placed it in the pot with real chicken broth mixture ( softened onions and celery). I halved the amount of regular cream cheese and added a pinch more of cayenne. Used my immersion blender  and voila. Served it last night for thanksgiving dinner at friends,,,everyone loved it! I served it with herb buns ,,,,sooooo goooood!

I made this soup..minus half the cream cheese and 1/2 c. Less water. I used an immersion blender to cream everything together after the squash was cooked.  It was absolutely amazing. .

great sweet soup.  changed it up: roasted the squash with olive oil, salt & pepper. Then added only 3/4 of a package of cream cheese - was extremely rich so could likely cut to 1/2.

I also followed others suggestions. I baked the squash first. Then I only used one 8 oz cream cheese. It was still very rich and creamy. I have a hard time with my blender so I used a hand emulsifier to make it creamy. Watch out for splashing. This soup was awesome eaten right after it's made. But as someone said, even better the next day.

This is the best butternut squash soup I have ever tasted - way better than most restaurants'.  I did bake the squash at 395 for about 30-40 minutes just until I can pierce the skin with a fork.  I then cut and cubed.  I did not use any cream cheese and the soup was still so delicious.  I used real butter rather than margarine, and seasoned with black pepper and nutmeg, and added a dollop of sour cream at serving.  Cannot wait to make more throughout the season!

Delish!!! Wonderful recipe! OK, for my conscience, I cut out 4 oz. cream cheese, but just tasted it after making it to exact specs, other than that (hate it when people change recipe and rate), IT IS FABULOUS!!!! Beautiful color, silky texture and aroma-wonderful taste.
Just picked some butternut squash from the garden and came across your recipe-THANK YOU for posting it!!!!

I love this recipe. I started making it for my son when he was 2 and now at 5 he still loves it especially when he gets to help make it. I add some ground cloves, all spice and nutmeg for added flavoring. This is a great recipe for everyone.

Very good!  Gave it 4 stars because I followed all the suggested revisions:  only 1/2 block of cream cheese (2 blocks would have totally ruined it), added a pinch of cinnamon, nutmeg and garlic powder.  Served topped with pumpkin seeds.

This soup is amazing; a common dinner request from friends. I always add a couple of sweet potatoes, which makes the soup a bit sweeter and the texture more creamy. I also season with garlic powder and sea salt, and use real butter instead of margarine.

I made this recipe in October 2013 at the beginning of our kitchen remodel - in order to have quick, yummy meals that could be warmed on a hotplate or microwaved.  I found a bag today in March 2014 in the back of the fridge - I reheated on the stove and it was as good as the first day I made it.

Absolutely amazing!!  Very filling and wonderful with some crusty bread.  I'm usually not a fan of spicy foods, but this had just the right kick to it.  It's so easy also...  can't really mess this one up.  It also saves wonderfully in the freezer for easy reheating later.  Only change I made was to reduce the cream cheese to only 8oz...  the other 8oz definitely aren't needed.  Love love love this!  Several people asked me for the recipe! Thanks so much.

One of my new favorites!  I roasted the squash in the oven at 400 for about 30 minutes and then added it to the other ingredients in the crock pot and cooked it for about 2 hours...PERFECT!

This was absolutely delicious!  I roasted the butternut squash in the oven at 375 for 45 minutes because I wasn't sure how to peel a squash.  This was my first attempt at this.  I also only added 1 block of reduced fat cream cheese.  I was fully prepared to add the second, but the consistency was what I was looking for after only 1, so figured I'd skip the calories.  It was amazing, amazing, amazing!  All of my children (4, 6, 9, 11) ate a whole bowl too!  That was what sold me!!!  Make this…you will NOT be disappointed!!!

This was amazing! I did change it just a bit by roasting the butternut squash with some garlic cloves. I added three times the pepper it called for and a couple of dashes of Tabasco. I also used only one package of cream cheese and it was perfect. I will be making this again real soon!

My favorite squash soup recipe! Followed the recipe and really liked it! Modified later by adding 1/4 tsp nutmeg and substituting 1/4 cup half and half for the cream cheese and loved it even more! Easier to just roast the squash whole then cut in half & scrape out insides  rather than peeling & cubing. I make this all the time in the fall & winter months, it's a hearty soup that tastes great!Thanks for sharing!

Cut the cream cheese in half, double the cayenne pepper, and viola! You have an absolutely delicious soup!

P.S. 6 cups equals about 2 lbs, or one regular size butternut squash

Devin made it.  YUM!  I'm working on my second cup.
He used real butter instead of margarine, red onion, and I added about a teaspoon of sea salt to the pot.   I suggested the immersion blender instead of what they recommended.
AND I think you could cut the cream cheese by half and you would still have a thick and rich soup.
I wanted to add some sausage -maybe next time.
Tasty, thick, soup for a cold winter evening.

I made the following changes: Turned out FANTASTIC!
1) Sautéed 1 serrano pepper along with the onion for a little spicy zing. 
2) 1 cup of diced pears (and so used 1 cup less of the squash) 
3) Used only used 1 pk creme cheese
4) Replaced marjoram with sage

I have made this recipe many, many times.  It always turns out great!  I use only half block of cream cheese, and it's plenty creamy.  Also I have used red pepper flakes instead of the cayenne pepper, and that substitution works well too.

This recipe is fabulous!  I was looking for a savory butternut squash soup and this recipe fit the bill.  I will say the marjoram is a must as it adds a subtle taste that should not be missed.  I make a vegetarian version using vegetable broth - one 32 oz container - and I do not use the chicken boullion cubes and I do not add the water that the recipe calls for.  This soup always gets rave reviews.  As with other reviewers, I find it easier to roast the squash first, then scoop out the pulp for this soup.  I also do not use more than 4 oz cream cheese and I use an immersion blender at the end to make a velvety smooth soup.  Thanks, Mary, for a fabulous soup I have made many times now.

I really like this soup, the only thing I changed was the amount of cream cheese, I only used one.  Everything else stayed the same.
My family really liked it.  Thank you, will make again !!

I was not sure I would like this but decided to try it since I had a butternut squash and only 1 8oz cream cheese -low fat. I roasted the squash by halving it and baking face down for about 40 min at 375. It was almost soft when I took it out but was able to peel and cube. I then continued and cooked it on stove for about 20 more min to blend flavors. Then I used my vitamix and put in cream cheese and soup. From there I poured it back in the pot  and It sat on my stove most of the afternoon. I just reheated for dinner....yum! Better than I thought! I also used quart of chicken broth instead of water and chicken bouillon.

This was really yummy. I used italian seasoning instead of marjoram. I halfed it. I used the cream cheese, which gave it a richness. (The cream cheese was frozen and I just defrosted it in the microwave on defrost). I did yucky rolls baked in bread pan and cut into slices and then buttered, seasoned with parmesan, rosmary, thyme, and light garlic salt, and broiled.

Made it to original recipe - but roasted the squash for 45 minutes.  Used 2 low fat cream cheese packages.  You could hear the "mmmmmmm"s around the table during our Thanksgiving meal.

I used potatoes instead of cream cheese (don't like cream cheese), then purée the soup, it was great without the processed cream cheese. Didn't change anything else. I am giving it three stars because I tweaked it.

Yum! Perfect creaminess and the cayenne gives it a nice little kick. I am not a spicy fan, so this is just perfect. I didn't have any cream cheese, so I used whole milk instead. I would imagine it would be even better with cream cheese!

I followed the recipe to the T and all I could taste was the cream cheese.  I prefer to taste the butternut squash in my soup.  If I make this soup again I would definitely cut down on the cream cheese.

My entire famiy loves this soup! I did change a few things, I had roasted buttercup and butter cream squashes. I used about 6 cups loosly packed of the squash.I added a half of red sweet pepper to the onions whie I was sauteing them.I used broth and added a sprinkling extra of the cayenne pepper. Instead of warming after processing I put it in a crock pot to hold while everyone gets together for dinner. a salad and crusty bread and it was a great meal.

Just made this recipe - it was REALLY easy.  I tweaked it slightly in that I had to use some items I had on hand.  I used red onion, I used cajun seasoning instead of cayenne, I used butter instead of margarine.  I only used 4 ounces of cream cheese (that seemed to be enough).  To top it off I put a swirl of Agave nectar and Tapatio for a sweet and salty kick.  Very good.  Would probably add a little garlic and more salt and pepper next time. :)

This was one of the tastiest soups I've made. If this had've been served to me at a high-end restaurant I would've been super pleased! I made very few changes: I used shallots instead of regular onions; used only 1/2 a block of cream cheese instead of the 2; used olive oil rather than butter and finally, used veg stock. I also baked squash for 45mins for ease of peeling. This was creamy and very flavorful!

This was my first time ever making butternut squash soup. It was so easy and turned out amazing. My family loved it. I made it the night before and didn't purée it until I was ready to serve it. I softened the cream cheese in the microwave for 20 and it blended so nicely in with the purée . Definitely a repeater.

Pathetically easy and yummy. Feel free to play a little with this recipe. Or just keep it simple. I used the already peeled and sliced squash. Once the squash was soft and squishy, I threw in half a bar of cream cheese (4oz) and about 1 C of light cream. Too rich? Maybe but it was tasty! Also, use a really good hand-held wand mixer. Works like magic!

Great recipe with a few tweaks.  As other reviews suggested, I cut the squash in half, de-seeded, and roasted (cut side down with skin on) in a pan with some olive oil and salt/pepper for 45 minutes at 350 degrees.  I then let the squash cool and peeled/cubed it.  I think roasting really brings out the flavor.  I also made it vegetarian and substituted the water/bouillon for 3 cups of vegetable broth and double the cayenne pepper.  It was delicious!  Very rich so if you like thinner soup, I would suggest using half the amount of cream cheese.

OMG, this was SO good!  I made it as written, but cut it in half for just hubby and me.  I did reduce the cream cheese by half (I used 4 oz. for half the recipe) and it was plenty rich.  I'm glad I didn't use any more.  Hubby was skeptical when I told him what I was making for dinner (he's not a big squash fan) but he really liked it!  I wish I'd made a full batch.  The cayenne gave it a nice tang; really added to the flavor.  Thanks for sharing!

As written I think it tasted way too rich. I cut the cream cheese in half, used chicken stock, added a pinch of ground ginger, nutmeg, and cinnamon along with some minced garlic and an apple. I added tons of salt to bring up the flavor and about 2T. of honey. After all those changes I love it. The way it is written it should just be called cream cheese soup!

Fantastic! This is better, in my opinion, as an appetizer soup. It is rich and dense, and we couldn't really do a whole soup bowl of it.

I like to roast the squash in halves, peel the skin off after it's tender. I used one butternut squash, one 8oz cream cheese, and only 3 vege bouillon cubes instead of four. Otherwise kept the directions as is. Perfection!

This is a pretty good soup. As others have suggested, I roasted the squash ahead of time and cut the cream cheese in half and was pleased with the results. I also doubled the amount of cayenne pepper as some suggested. I enjoyed the final flavor but there's no doubt it was a little hot.

Amazing! After tasting this recipe, I don't think I'll ever make butternut squash in the oven again. I am going to make it to bring to my mother-in-laws for Thanksgiving next week...THAT'S how much I like it.  Lol!

This was my first attempt at making Butternut Squash Soup.  I didn't have any Marjoram so I left it out.  I also only used two VEGETABLE bullion cubes.  And instead of cream cheese I used half a pint of organic heavy whipping cream.  I also doubled the onion, subed coconut oil for the butter and added 2 cloves of garlic.  And I also added a lot more red and black pepper.

Oh yeah, and the squash only took about 5-10 minutes to cook.

I made this last Christmas for my entire family (in-laws, parents, etc.). My father, who is very traditional, did not want any but agreed to have a taste. He went back for a full bowl. My father-in-law only agreed to a bowl so he would not hurt my feelings and went back for seconds. I think I may have halved the cream cheese but otherwise followed the directions! This is wonderful.

This was delicious!  I was faithful to the spirit of this recipe, but I made it in the crock pot by adding all the ingredients to the crock, cooking on low for 6 hours, pureeing with an immersion blender, adding cheese, pureeing again.  I used one LARGE butternut squash (I think the squash was around 5 lbs whole, and yielded 10 cups of cubed squash).  I also increased the onion to one whole onion, chopped, and substituted 16 oz Philadelphia Lite Cream Cheese for the 16 oz cream cheese called for.

The recipe tastes great, but warning: If you have never cut a squash it is time cosuming and difficult. I watched a video on youtube that was helpful in how to cut the squash.

YUM!  Thanks for an easy and fun recipe!  Made this according to direction (OK, I'll admit I used chicken broth instead of water + bullion because I was out of bullion ;-)).  Next time -- will stay with the chicken broth plan (unless I'm out then will do the bullion/water plan), cut the cream cheese in half, and probably just nuke the squash instead of cutting, peeling, cubing.  Good recipe - thanks for posting!

I followed other reviewer's suggestions by roasting the squash first, using 8 oz of cream cheese, adding a golden delicious apple, some sage leaves, and using chicken stock instead of bouillon. It was a little spicy for my mother's taste, but she's kind of a wimp about spice :) I thought it was great! Thanks for a great recipe!

This was a really good soup & for Halloween festiveness I put it in a pumpkin to serve. My family thought it was great! I made 2 batches, 1 with regular cream cheese & 1 with non dairy cream cheese. My husband thought the regular cream cheese one was AWESOME!

I like this recipe but I omitted the curry powder and substituted cinnamon. I think I needed to add more than the 1/2 teaspoon I used. Perhaps a whole teaspoon for half the recipe.  I also left the skin on the apples and the squash and only had small infrequent chunks remaining after liquefying in the blender. More fiber can't hurt for a healthier diet.

STUPENDOUS, INCREDIBLE, FILLING SOUP.  I PRESSURE COOKED THE SQUASH AND BABY CARROTS, AND USED IN PAN BLENDER AND A POTATOE MASHER TO MAKE IT INTO A SOUP.  THE SKIN FELL OFF, SO IT WAS SO EASY TO FIX, IF ON A BUDJET, THIS SOUP WILL FILL TEENAGERS AND PUT THEM TO BED.  IT IS RICH AND OH SO FILLING.  I ADDED CREAM, AS WELL AS THE PHILADELPHIA CREAM CHEESE. IT BELONGS IN A 5 STAR RESTAURANT.

I made this just like the recipe and family loved it.  Very easy. Next time I would increase the cayenne pepper to 1/4 tsp I think.  Will try freezing it also as I have a lot of squash in my garden this year.

Loved this! I did add salt as I like my soups a little salty. I also only had about 4 oz. of cream cheese, so I added a cup or so of Half and Half. I also mashed with potato masher to have more texture. Also, peeling the squash with the potato peeler made it MUCH easier to cut up!

Wonderful recipe.  I did tweak it a bit to feed my family of 7.  I took 2 butternut squash's, split them in half, took out the seeds, and microwaved each 1/2 for about 8-10 minutes each, then peeled off the skin in order to get to the meat of the squash.  I also used about 8 cups of water and 8 bouillon cubes.  I also doubled the spices and included salt.  I kept the cream cheese at 2, 8 oz. pkgs.  I found that this helped to keep the soups creamier.  Other than these changes, I followed the recipe the same.  Next time I think I might add some garlic to the onions.  W topped off the soup with some sour cream, bacon bits, and shredded cheese.  I will definitely be making this recipe again.

I thought this recipe was great! Perfect with homemade bread on a chilly fall night. I did take some suggestions from other users and omitted the cream cheese, used only 2 tablespoons of butter (not margarine), used chicken broth instead of bouillon cubes, added a dash of nutmeg, a cup of apple cider, and one granny smith apple. I also roasted the squash in the oven first, with EVOO, salt and pepper, and garlic cloves. My husband and daughter thought it was a tad too thick - but they tend to be picky eaters. Regardless, it was enjoyable :)

I made this soup tonight but replaced the butternut squash with pumpkin. It turned out amazing! Very simple and tasty!I only used half of the recommended cream cheese, but that wasn't any problem as it turned out very creamy.

This recipie was super easy and really delicious.  I made a few changes...veggie broth for my vegetarian daughter and only 1/2 the cream cheese plus it was lite cream cheese.  It was still super rich, might try 1/2ing again the cream cheese.  The next day I added in more veggie broth to thin it out.

Made this for lunch and was excellent! I didn't have marjoram so put in a little thyme instead. Also threw in a few carrots for sweetness. Tossed all ing. in a covered stoneware and cooked in the microwave until all veggies were soft and then blended. Definate do-again!

Butternut soup is good and nutritious. Here is a easy way to up the ntrition and reduce the fat and dairy; just change half or all the cream cheese with silken tofu - it cost about the same and adds the same consistacy.

I am doing this review so I can remember my recipe.  I boiled the squash, onion, and carrots in chicken broth.  I took all and did the puree.  Added garlic salt, heavy cream, nutmeg, and cayenne.  This was the best batch I have ever made.  I have tried a few times but this time was the best.  Don't use water...

Awesome!  I roasted the Butternut for 1 hr. at 425.  I also halved the butter, added 1/2-1 c. more water, omitted Cayenne & Marjoram (didn't have) and only did 1 pgk. cream cheese. Super flavorful and creamy!

I used this recipe as a base and added to it. Like a lot of reviewers I cut the cream cheese in half, I used butter instead of margarine, and home made chicken stock instead of bullion and water. I added two small granny smith apples, garlic, cinnamon, nutmeg, and ground clove. I just eyeballed the amounts based on what I like. I added a little cream to thin it out but I think I'll add a little more stock, it's getting lot thicker as it cools. I was really surprised at all the flavor. My husband doesn't like butternut squash and he liked this !

Great stuff, the squash flavor was still a little too strong.  So I added a pinch more pepper (I omitted the cayenne-usually have bad results with the kids when I add that).  A pinch of garlic and onion powder and a half pinch of thyme.
PERFECT!

I made this just as directed except I only used the amount of butter I felt I needed to saute the onions and I halved the cream cheese as Mary suggested & it was very, very good. This soup has a good seasoning while not masking the squash.

Wow this was wonderful :) For those concerned about using the cream cheese, just use fat free or low fat. I used just one of the Philadelphia cream cheese round 250 gram containers, 95% fat free. I did not have any apple cider but I did have apple butter and I used about a cup of that, plus half an apple. I used one butternut squash and I also did what another reviewed recommended and put olive oil, salt, pepper, and smashed garlic cloves on the squash. I baked it for an hour at 375 (I have a very old oven :). I sauteed the onion, added in water, chicken bouillon, apple butter, and spices (except for marjoram which I did not have. I added 1/2 tsp nutmeg which was nice. Also I used crushed red pepper in place of cayenne and it still gave it some nice heat). I pureed the squash and garlic cloves with the cream cheese in small batches as recommended. I then added the pureed squash and cream cheese mixture to the soup on the stove and let it simmer at low heat, stirring until it was all nice and mixed up. I won't add any salt at all next time as it was perhaps a tad too salty. And I think next time I may add apple cider or more apple for a bit more sweetness but overall it was soooo good! :)

This has been my favorite soup recipe for years.  Use half of the cream cheese that the recipe calls for (and substitute with Neufchatel cheese to reduce the fat content,) and double the cayenne to create a perfect balance of sweet, savory, spicy.

This was absolutely delicious. I used half the cream cheese recommended and it was perfect!

This is very good but I would suggest using only 1 package of cream cheese.

Very creamy and delicious, but almost TOO creamy. The two packages of cream cheese make it incredibly rich; almost too rich to finish a whole bowl.

Roast squash in olive oil, salt, and pepper face side down instead of the skillet idea. Till tender of course. The skin should peel off very easily when it's done roasting. Oven temp around 375 to 350. Depending on how much time you have. Also only one package of cream cheese should be used. Two is way to much. Also add some nutmeg into the mix it creates a much more complex pallet. And much more delicious. Since this recipe is so creamy I added fresh cooked bacon bits to add a little diversity in texture and some chopped chives as a garnish. It helps to keep you interested in eating. The guy loved it.

I roast my squash for about 45 min at 400 degrees after brushing it with melted butter and adding salt and pepper to get that sweet and nutty flavor out of the flesh.  I kept everything else the same but only used 8 ounces of cream cheese, not 16, I felt it was going to be way to rich if I used it all.  Also, a side note, if you roast the squash, you only need to simmer it with the rest of the ingredients for about 5-10 minutes since it's already been cooked.  Enjoy!

Tasty winter soup.  I used only one 8 ounce package of cream cheese instead of two to cut down on fat and it was very good, and still creamy.  I used less cayenne, too, just to make this more toddler-friendly.

This was really good! Probably the best soup I've ever made! I did make a bit of a change with the cream cheese though: I replaced one of the packages with a can of beans (navy beans) to make it a bit healthier, and it still turned out amazing!

*ALL* my kids loved this one, event the picky 3yo.  I made this completely in my electric pressure cooker.  After saute-ing onions, cooked for 5 min on high.  Then used my hand stick blender to puree the cream cheese (used low-fat).  One pot perfection.  Garnished with small dollop of Mexican sour cream (creamier than sour cream) and dash of paprika.  Looked as good as it tasted.  Served with oatmeal bread to dip.  Very thick and hearty.  Thanks for a fabulous recipe!

I really don't want to be negative but I have to admit this soup tasted too much like a velveta cheese soup with a hint of squash.  I only added 1 package of cream cheese and that was too much.  I wouldn't use cream cheese at all.  I added about 2 cups of heavy cream, a dash of nutmeg and a dash of cinnamon to "fix" it.

This was delicious, I also halved the cream cheese make it a bit healthier and it was still very creamy.  You could play around with adding other vegetables very easily.  Veggie stock makes it vegetarian :)

Very yummy after I deluded the soup with 1 1/2 C of water. Too thick for me. Next time I will half the amount of cream cheese. But after I deluded it, it was fantastic!

Excellent recipe!  Prebake the squash and 1/2 the cream cheese though.  I also tried another suggestion which was to add a few tablespoons of balsamic vinegar when blending the cream cheese. It was delicious and definately gave the soup a different flavor.  I asked my guests to taste test it with and without the vinegar and they chose with!

I had butternut squash soup n an upscale restaurant this fall and I have been craving it ever since.  This recipe came really close.  I used it as a base and following the lead of other reviewers, tweaked it a bit.  I roasted the squash with olive oil and dusted it with cinnamon.  I scooped out the tender flesh after it roasted about an hour.  It smelled great baking.  While it was baking, I sautéed onion, garlic, and fresh ginger in margerne.  I added chicken broth and then added the squash.  As far as seasoning, I added 1/2 tsp of curry, 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper and black pepper.  I then used a submersion stick blender and blended the mixture in the pot.  I then added 1/2 a block of cream cheese and blended it as well.  It was super creamy and smooth, but was missing a little something. So I added a about 1/4 cup of cheap beer and about 2 tbsp of brown sugar.  This brought it over the top!  This was great!

Waaaaaaay too much cream cheese. It was very thick and it seemed like a velveeta cheese dip. I would reduce cream cheese by at least half or more.

Great soup w a few adjustments. I followed some other suggestions, baked the squash first, used less than 1/2 the cream cheese as made it too sweet and rich, added a bit of milk, 1 tsp ginger , 1/2tsp dill and about 1/4 tsp crushed red peppers.(I didn't have any cayenne pepper or marjoram)) It was delicious!

Because I don't like to peel butternut squash, I baked the squash first then added to the softened onions. I used chicken broth and only one package of light cream cheese. My family really liked it. I probably doubled it as well, as I like to have leftovers.

I made this according the recipe, and that was far too much cream cheese. I added another cup of water with bouillon cube and that helped, but I'll probably still throw a lot of this away. I have some squash left over, so I'll try it again according to another reviewer who eliminated the cream cheese.

This dish is a little time consuming, but very worthwhile.  I served it as a first course for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it!  This is a keeper.

After reading through the reviews here, we only used 1 package of cream cheese and also added 1T of garlic powder, 4 tsp of chili powder and 1 tsp. I think the garlic and chili powder were an excellent addition! Before adding those spices, I wasn't really sure I liked this soup at all and now I LOVE it!   We didn't saute the onion, just sliced it up, threw it in and used the immersion blender right in the pot - very easy and yummy soup!

This soup tasted great but was way too creamy and I only used half of the cream cheese called for! When I make this again I will omit the cream cheese and maybe just add a little half and half for creaminess.

I really liked this soup, used 1/2 the cream cheese even though I love cream cheese. It was very rich, but I served it with a baguette. My boyfriend didn't care for this at all, I guess you either like butternut squash or you don't!

This is the 3rd time I'm making this and I have to double the batch because my sons friends love this. I also cut the squash in half and roast it for about a half an hour and I substitute butter as I dislike margarine. The squash is so much easier to cut and definitely more flavorful. I added a little more cayenne as well. De-Lish!!!

Overall a great recipe! However I did make some changes.  I only used 1 pkg. of cream cheese and still found that it was still overpowering.  I added a dash of cumin and salt.  Only used 1 chicken bouillon and it was more than enough.  I have a picky mother, which I thought was not going to touch it, but she enjoyed it very much!

This was incredible! I even got a family member who refuses to eat veggies to think it was "cheese soup" til he got too suspicious of me. I replaced the regular cream cheese with fat free and honestly didn't even notice! Normally you can really notice the taste. I served this as a starter at Thanksgiving dinner with my huge left over squash from holiday decor. No joke! Was fantastic!

You really don't need any cream cheese at all in a butternut squash soup, so unless you are trying to fatten up starving wilderness survivors, I'd leave it out!  The suggestion of apple cider or juice in another review is a good one as a fruity variation.  Personally I like it savory with prebaked squash and garlic. If you have time to make your own vegetable or chicken stock, it's a huge improvement on chicken cubes. Isn't butternut squash an absolutely wonderful rewarding vegetable to cook with?!!!

This soup is VERY creamy, pudding-like texture! I made 6 people proportion, and found that 18oz of cream cheese was a overkill. That's is the secret why this soup stands out from the rest. You put cream cheese on grass and it will taste good! 8oz ( 6 portions)is just right, won't sacrifice the taste nor the texture . 
:advice:
1. Roast two halves cut side down @ 350f for 45min
2. Add some butter in squash pan (use some of the butter ,easy for this recipe, it will all comeback into the pan)

3. Take all the juices from the squash pan, collect it with some broth, in the pot it goes

I gave it 4stars for the calorie fat. I am a sucker for healthy, looking for more thing good and healthy

I didn't like it much as a soup - way too much cream cheese. I wish I had read the reviews prior saying to only add half of it. Don't get me wrong, it was delicious to dip bread in, but as a soup I've definitely had better butternut squash soup. This was more like a cream cheese soup with butternut squash flavoring.

I've made this three times so far and it's been wonderful every time.  I've always used real butter.  I've never added the marjoram - we just don't have any.  The first two times I only used one cream cheese, but I cubed the squash as instructed. The third time I used two packages of cream cheese and baked the squash, and it was much better-tasting.  Each time I've used Better Than Bouillon instead of bouillon cubes.  I've always used my blender and the texture comes out very nice.  My nine-month-old loves it!

This soup was wonderful! I used the suggestion to use chicken broth instead of boullion and reduce the cream cheese. I also added a teeny bit of allspice and crumbled a table spoon of bacon. Oh Yum! It was wonderful. And I must admit today for lunch it's even better. The only thing I will change next time is, I will definitely make a double batch.

Now I have never once had butternut soup- so I don't have a baseline.  I had many butternuts in the garden this fall- and was looking for a way to use them.  I used 8oz of reduced fat cream cheese and found that it is still very thick and rich- could probably use only 4oz. I also had some opened chicken stock to use instead of bouillon. I also used a pinch of oregano since I did not have any marjoram. Next time- I will be roasting the squash first in order to make cutting it easier- I think I bruised my hand with the knife!

This recipe really was amazing. I added two chicken bouillons because it was all I had and a the rest in vegetable broth. I also have a five pound butternut squash that I roasted and then used 3/4 of. Had no marjorm so skipped that, and use about 5 ounces of cream cheese instead of 8. 

It came out amazing! If my boyfriend doesn't get down on one knee after tasting this then he's crazy.

Very good and I'm not a fan of squash much. Used chix broth and half the cream cheese, added a swirl of sour cream right before serving, delish! Had ham and cheese pretzel bread bagel sandwiches with, perfect for dipping!

Just made this for 30 people at a 75th birthday party for my mother.  It was a hit.  I did change just a bit to add a little sugar.  It was a nice compliment to the cayenne pepper and turned out great!

This is delicious, though I agree with others, you can easily half the cream cheese. Next time I make it I might even quarter it. Otherwise followed the recipe, and added some paprika and bits of applewood bacon to it. Mm.

It was ok, but my husband and I didn't care too much for this soup. It needed to be more savory or more sweet. It was edible for me, but my husband wouldn't even finish his. I think next time I'll just stick to eating my squash roasted.

I have had butternut squash soup at the best restaurants in Manhattan and Brooklyn, and this recipe (with one change) is by far the best. 

The only thing I do differently is cut the cream cheese serving in half and use the less fat package. 

It is also nice to add a touch of cinnamon at the end, to each person's bowl.

If you rate this recipe less than 4 stars, you are making it wrong, or you might just not like butternut squash soup. :)

Thank you for sharing!

You can make this recipe more exciting by adding a can of corn and some roasted russet potatoes. I diced my potatoes and drizzled them with olive oil with a little salt and pepper before roasting them in the oven. Add the corn and potatoes as while you heat the soup after it's been blended. Makes it heartier and SO good! P.S. My son loved it with CHEEZITS on top!

This was really delicious & easy.  I used an immersion blender which made it even easier.  You can add more spices or more onion or garlic to spice it up if you want.  Great recipe!

This soup has incredible texture.  The taste is mild (kid friendly).  I only had 5 cups of squash and 1/2 c of cream cheese.  Instead of chicken bouillon and water I used one can of condensed broth and one can of water.  I will definitely make again, I'm rating this a 4 because I think there is way too much cream cheese as written.

I wanted to add Apple Cider but I didn't have any.  So I added some Steven's Apple Cider mix instead.  It was fun to use my Butternut Squash from my garden.  I will probably make it again.

I have made this soup a few times now and people that say they hate butternut squash soup have loved this.  The only thing I did differently was to roast the squash before adding it to the soup as it made it easier to remove from the skin, but other than that I left everything the same.  It was great.  A staple in my kitchen now.

I made this exact recipe the first time and felt it was too cheesy so the next time I halved the cheese and it was much better.  My favorite was when I made the soup without cream cheese and put a dollop of sour cream on top of each serving.  Looks pretty and tastes great.

I have made this soup several times, using one average butternut squash and only one package of cream cheese.  I also added 2 cloves of garlic and about one tbsp of fresh ginger root while cooking the squash.  Very good and easy.

I love this recipe!  At the suggestion of some reviewers, I reduced the amount of cream cheese. I used 1/2 of an 8-oz pkg, and it was very thick and creamy.  The cayenne pepper gives it just the right bit of heat.  This is definitely a keeper!

I eliminated the cream cheese and instead pureed it w/a couple spoonfuls of non-fat plain yogurt.  Great taste - can't wait to make it again.

Very tasty, but as written, the recipe does have too much cheese.  A little extra broth and half the cheese, as suggested, is where you should start if you're making this.

I have made this soup 4 different times with slight variations each time. Amazing! Although I never have used the full amount of cream cheese, it is perfect. I have boiled and roasted the squash switched types of squash and once subbed half ricotta for center cheese. Amazing everytime and quick and easy! Only 4 stars because of crm cheese quantity.

I followed the recipe but used butter and only 4 oz of cream cheese (that's all I had) and it tasted great. It might be better with more cream cheese but it's not necessary.

This was very rich but tasty. I can only eat a small amount at a time. I used one squash which I cooked in the oven at 375 degrees for 45 minutes. I sauted an onion with the margerine, added 2 cups of water, 1 cup of apple cider, a peeled/chopped granny smith, salt/pepper/cayenne, 6 oz cream cheese. I then used my blender to mix small batches with the squash.

This was too spicy for me & my family.  Next time I will omit the cayenne.  I used only 1 brick of cream cheese & that seemed to be fine for thickening the soup.

So delicious... I LOVE this in the fall!  Try it with "Downeast Maine Pumpkin Bread."  I double the recipe, use three large butternut squash, real butter and only two packages of cream cheese.  I have always roasted the squash in the oven first but it's such a pain to scoop the flesh out afterwards I'm going to try it next time boiling them as the recipe states.

I followed some of the other recommendations and roasted the squash first - makes it much easier.  I used half and half in place of cream cheese.  Making another batch of it today and I am going to try creme fraiche instead.  My daughter loved the soup the first time I made it and is looking forward to having it today on Thanksgiving.

This recipe was awesome with two minor changes.  I used butter instead of margarine (yuck) and I used chicken broth instead of water and bouillon cubes.  With these changes, this was the best Butternut squash soup I ever had!

This is excellent.  I DID roast the squash in the oven and cooked the onion in broth (rather than sauteeing); I only had enough ingredients to make a half-batch and only used 4 oz. of cream cheese.  However, as other reviewers have stated, it would be delicious withOUT the cream cheese!  It's a simple recipe, but the results are phenomenal.  Thanks, Mary!

I took a large butternut squash, quartered it, and put it in the oven with a few potatoes and a few large carrots(washed but not peeled).I sprinkled on some olive oil, added about 1-2 tsp kosher salt and 4-5 whole cloves of garlic. Then I stuck it in the oven at 350 until the veggies were soft. After the veggies were cool enough to touch I peeled them and added any juices at the bottom of the casserole to a large pot along with the veggies. Then I added the broth, and other ingredients in the original recipe. I also added the slightest amount of clove to add a bit of kick.

Very rich and tasty. Has the appearance of a cheese sauce. We dipped lightly steamed broccoli in it - yum! Used half the cream cheese - both blocks would have definitely been too much!

Really good.  However, I broiled the butternut squash to make it easier and for more flavor as other reviewers suggested.  I also halved the amount of cream cheese called for.

This is one of the best soups I've ever made.  No need to add all the cream cheese either.  I roasted the squash first, I think it gives a much deeper flavor.

I made bread bowls to go with this soup and the two went together perfectly.  I loved this soup, and my husband thought it was good.  However, it was not a big hit with the kids.

This soup is addicting!  Very creamy, full of flavor, and so easy to make!  I took the advice of other reviews and only used 1 package of cream cheese.  Next time I make it, I think I will add more water and bouillon to make it a litte thinner; just as a personal preference.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

This soup was so delicious, everyone loved it! I did change the recipe a little. I used one large squash. I roasted it in the oven 350 degree for 1hour , cut in half, face side down in a cake pan with water in it to keep the edges from burning. I added a dash of cinnamon, 8 ounces of milk and used 2 cups of water instead of three and one cup of chicken stock.

Really good recipe.  I took the advice of others and used only 1 container of cream cheese.  I also roasted the squash in the oven.  Def. puree in blender and strain.

I wish I could give this 4.5 stars - even people who started out with, "Ewwww" liked the soup. Following other suggestions, I roasted the squash first and did only use 1 block of cream cheese. We like food spicy so I added some cajun seasonings and other personal spices to add some kick. My immersion blender worked great to blend everything. Thanks for the recipe!

Very good.  I did use some of the suggestions of others ie: bake the squash, garlic, celery, more onion, more cayanne pepper.  I also used FAGE Green fat free Yogurt (Costco, TJ's) Better than Bullion chicken in a jar (Wal-Mart) and blended it all with my Braun hand mixer.  I don't know how I ever made soup without my hand blender.  You can put it in a boiling pot of puree.  So much easier than putting batches in a blender.  Thank you for the recipe.  We love it.

Awesome!  My husband, "the chef" modified this, by adding celery, garlic, honey, nutmeg, cinnamon, and some sugar.  He advised me to adjust to taste buds, turned out great!  I agree with other reviewers only need 1 8oz package of cream cheese.  I used fat free, I could not tell a difference.  Lots of flavor and creaminess.  Used two huge squash and made a gallon of soup.  Also, a lot of reviewers roasted the squash first, but I followed the recipe and boiled until I had a great stock base with flavor and the squash was rtender enough to puree.  Will make again definitely!

Great way to use up excess squash, but it was a little bland IMO.  Once it was finished I added garlic powder and a bit more cayenne, which I think helped.  I would try this again with maybe some extra seasoning/spice.  I did half the amount of cream cheese, I think it would have been the dominant flavor had I not

Incredible.  Served with dried apple chips on top and sourdough bread for dipping.  Was very rich and hearty (and I used low-fat cream cheese).  Great for a cold night.

I made no alterations to this recipe when I prepared it, and it turned out great! Expect to spend a lot of time peeling the butternut squash... next time I make it I may go ahead and roast or steam it first to help soften it. Very easy to make, not many ingredients required, and it turns out fantastic. Good recipe all around! Make extra and freeze or can it for later!

I worked with what I had and this recipe came out ammmmazing.  I roasted in 2 squash for about 45 minutes at 350 in the oven.  Meanwhile I did the onion and butter, added the squash and 4 cups of chicken stock when the squash came out of the oven (I used 1 1/2 squash).  Pureed in my little kitchen aide with the cream cheese! Awesome.  Oh, and I didn't have any marjoram and it was still fantastic!

Yum! Roasted quartered butternut (drizzled with olive oil and sprinkled with salt and pepper), peeled and added as directed. Cooked for ~10 min with broth before pureeing.

I would have given this 5 stars if I based it on the soup after I made the recommended changes.  It was a very tasty soup.  I roasted the squash (350 for 45 minutes), added a bit of garlic and only used 1 block of fat-free cream cheese.  So good!

Wow, this soup is amazing! I made some changes: I didn't add any cream cheese at all. I added a sweet potato and 4 carrots. In the spice category i added nutmeg, allspice, red pepper, and cinnamon. I also didn't puree it because i am a lazy cook so i just mashed everything together in the pot (more like a stew) and it was still very good!

I've made this wonderful soup several times but this time I only used half the cream cheese as so many reported that it was just as good...I disagree.  Although still very good,  it just doesn't  measure up to the original version.

I did roast my squash in the oven first. 375, with garlic oil salt/pepper one hour.  Followed the rest of directions except used 1.5x the red pepper.  I think it has a great taste.

Yummy soup!!  I took the advise of one review here and used a potato instead of cream cheese, added a little bit of milk during blending process, and a little extra cayenne pepper due to my family's preference!!  Soup was a big hit!

Ok, maybe I did something entirely wrong, but I tried to follow the recipe exactly. There was definitely way too much cream cheese.  I would recommend anyone making this to half the amount of cream cheese.  I'm slightly surprised by all the great reviews.

It is quite spicy.  And, I like spicy stuff. I only had one small-medium squash so I used it, 1 large sweet potato and the rest of the ingredients. I only used 1/4 block of cream cheese, 2 chicken cubes and 3 cups of water.  I def need to cut back on the cayenne next time...yikes!!!  It's tasty, I like it but my husband was a so-so.

We loved this soup, and don't ordinarily love squash.  I followed the lead of some others and roasted the squash.  I used two squashes, sliced in halves.  I splashed with olive oil and coarse ground pepper and kosher salt.  Roasted cut side down for 45 minutes.  The flesh was super easy to scoop out and use.   I used vegetable buillion to make it a vegetarian soup.  I used 1/2 the amount of cream cheese to make it a bit more calorie friendly.   I didn't have cayenne, so I used about 1/2 t. hot pepper sauce.   I will surely make this again.

As a soup lover, this was absolutely amazing! I made a few changes as some other reviews suggested. I roasted the squash beforehand, sauteed 3 celery stalks and 2 cloves garlic with the onion and also used half the cream cheese. I used whipped cream cheese but I'm not sure if that mattered much. I didn't have any marjoram and added turmeric then topped the soup with fresh chives when I was ready to serve it. Delicious!!

I was really skeptical. It looked really wierd,a nd the ingredients seems kinda strange. I'd herd good things but didnt know how the "at home" version would be, but i made it anyway, and boy am i glad! This was soo good. Choping up the squash was the most difficult, i had to google a video on how to do that part. Everyone has GOT to try this!

I liked the flavor, but this soup was really thick even though I only added 1 of the 2 packages of cream cheese. Probably just needs a bit more broth.

Delicious!  I made this for some friends this past fall and it turned out really good.  I ended up trying to cut the squash while it was raw.... a bad idea.  It was really difficult and took a long time.  I should have taken the advice of the other comments and cooked it first before trying to cut it.

Amazing!  I'm not even a soup fan, but I found this wonderful.  My husband I I both agreed that it was a little rich with the 2 packages of cream cheese (we used the fat free kind), so I think next time we will only use 1 package. But we will ceretainly make this again!

Very good. I used chicken broth instead of water/bullion. I adjusted the serving size to fit 4 people and I also used only 1 pkg of cream cheese.  It was DELISH! I think the cayenne pepper and marjoram added great flavoring which is sometimes lacking in other soups!

I gave it only 3 stars because the cream cheeze is a lot for this recipe and the amount of water. the first time i made it it was too creamy. the next time i used 1/2 the ingredients and a quarter of the cream cheeze, half of the water i used was homemade chicken broth. I added a sprinkle of ginger powder and a teaspoon of crushed fresh ginger. This other batch was alot better than the first one when i folowed the exact recipe.

I used vegetable broth (my daughter is vegetarian) and only one pkg of cream cheese and this was a huge hit. There were no leftovers which is a shame since I wanted it again the next day. Excellent.

It could maybe use some more spice, depending on your tastes, but it was really good, hearty, and flavorful.

Delicious! I used real butter instead of margarine.  I halfed the cream cheese, as suggested. Also, I did not use chick boullion or water--instead, I used 3 cups of vegetable stock.  I added some extra cayenne pepper.  The soup was creamy and sweet with a hint of heat (from the cayenne).  Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe.

I just made this last night and I am very excited to review it.  The recipe is great and I think the secret is in the cream cheese.  I didn't put as much as it was indicated (trying to be healthy) but still the result was fabulous.  I have never had luck with pureed soups and I am really excited that this one turned out OK.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I only used 1/2 the cream cheese and cooked the squash ahead of time in the oven so it didn't have to simmer so long on the stove. I also doubled the amount of spices and added salt, but I like my food with a lot of zing. I can't give this recipe five stars since I made changes, but I loved what I ended up with.

I used 1 pack of cream cheese and it was more than enough.  I'd suggest using 6 oz or just add heavy cream.  I poked holes every 2 inches going around the squash and stuck in microwave for 2 min.  Easier to cut that way, but that was the hardest part.  This soup was very creamy, rich and tasted like a very good restaurant's version.  Husband loves it, but I'm giving it 4 stars because of too much cream cheese.  Also used extra dashes of cayenne and nutmeg.

So delicious!! I had never had a squash soup before, not being a squash lover, but i thought this was very flavorful! I used half a block of cream cheese instead of the half and half and canned pears instead of fresh and it was still very good!

Ohhhh my goodness, this is the best soup I think I have ever eaten. I did make a couple changes but minor ones. I used fat free cream cheese and I can't believe its not butter to cut down on the fat and calorie count since I am dieting. I also added a tad more black and cayene pepper. Yummmyyy

Killer!!!  I made this with a carton of chicken broth and recommended amt of squash.  I kicked up the pepper, and used only 4 oz of cream cheese-  sauteed the onion in 1 T. olive oil-  definitely will make again for MYSELF as a treat!

This soup is just fantastic!  I usually process the squash and freeze it so I will be able to make this soup on almost a  moment's notice.  After cooking the squash, I strain the cooking stock and freeze it in an ice cube tray and put the cubes in another freezer bag.  When I later thaw and add cream cheese to the previously cooked squash, I add some "ice" cubes and/or half-and-half, heavy cream or just water to thin it out a little.

I roasted the squash and then put the soft meat into the dutch oven with the onions and sauteed. This is so good. I added some Louisiana hot sauce instead of the cayenne pepper and was able to control the heat and could add more at the table. Surprisingly filling.

I make this delicious soup every Thanksgiving, and it always receives rave reviews and recipe requests.  As others have suggested, I roast the squash before adding, and cut the cream cheese in half, at least.  I use 4-6oz, and find that to be plenty!  I add 2 cloves of garlic in with the onions, and love that added flavor.  This is a wonderful cold weather soup.  You will not be disappointed!

DON'T use that much cream cheese! 3 stars as is, but probably 5 stars with less. The best bites were right after it left the stove, when it was not as thick as it turned out, after it cooled down. I wish I had read the suggestions before cooking it.

this is a terrific soup!  super easy and everyone who tries it loves it!  i always cut my squash in 1/2 and seed then roast in the oven.  i find that 1 lg package of  1/3 less fat cream cheese is plenty.  i made this for the teachers at my kids school last year and this year they requested it and a great # wanted the recipe.  thanks for a great recipe, Mary!

Very tasty.  I used about 1/3 of the cream cheese called for and added a carrot and a bit of sage.  Also, I roasted the vegetables with a little oil at 375 until tender.

My new favorite soup!  the addition of the cream cheese is key in this recipe, although after the first time I only use 1/2 to 1 block of light cream cheese and that definitely does the trick.  I've made this recipe a few times, and once I did get a slightly mealy texture...I think it must have been the squash since everything else was the same.  Judging from my experience and a lot of the other reviewers, this soup is pretty versatile and can be altered and varied quite a bit with fab results, just don't forget the cream cheese!!!

This was fabulous!  I would say the best I have tasted so far.  I used leftover squash that I had cubed and roasted in the oven the night before with brown sugar.  I sauted onion and added a clove of minced garlic until tender, then started adding chicken stock, then the left over squash until it was all cooked through.  I pureed in food processor with cream cheese, then just heated it through again right before we ate.   Taking into consideration other comments on the cream cheese, definataly add the cream cheese about 3 or 4 ounces at a time, that way you can get to the richness that you prefer before you have taken it too far.  I added less than half the recipe called for.  Lovely!!

This was delicious!  For me, the hardest part was peeling and chopping the squash but once that was done, the rest was a cinch.  I didn't use nearly as much cream cheese as was written; I only used 2/3 of one bar and the full flavor of the squash came through while still being creamy.

I roasted the squash as well as onion and garlic.  I use broth instead of water/bouillon. (Can use chicken broth or vegetable broth - I've made it both ways). Tastes even better the second day.

Easy and delicious!  I baked the squash first, and used 1/2 the cream cheese as others suggested.  I also used oregano instead of marjoram, and a blend of onion, garlic, and shallots (pre-diced from Trader Joe's).  It was quite tasty!  I think you could tweak the spices easily to suit your own taste.

DELICIOUS!  I make this all the time!  It really is so delicious!  If I have the cream cheese, I put it in, but if I don't, I use milk when I blend it.  I also roast the squash with some garlic and olive oil instead of boiling it with the broth.  Depending on who is eating it, I sometimes throw in more cayenne pepper (kids don't like it too spicy) and I eat it with whole grain crackers.  I LOVE this recipe!  Bravo to the creator!

I used this  as a base recipe ---one thing I changed was to use only 2 Tbsp of cream cheese --- and added  can evap milk about 1 cup  --- used 1 cup applejuice  fresh and 1 pear  and lots of spices -- cumin- red pepper - ginger ,nutmeg and thyme & marjoram----I added  a little at time and  kept tasting until  just enough  --I  cooked  about 1/2 cup onion  and  2 cloves of  garlic and blended  altogether- it is delicous--- served  with pumpkin seeds and a dollop of sour cream  on top - yummy!

Delicious!!  I cut my squash in half and roasted for 45min at 375 degrees as others suggested, then just scooped out the inside and threw it in the pot with the onions. I only used 1 package of low-fat cream cheese and it was still REALLY creamy and sooo yummy.  This recipe is a keeper!!

I thought this was delicious.  I roasted the squash for 45 min in a 375 degree oven.  It was a great dinner with a loaf of sourdough and a nice salad.  would definately make again.

This soup was not good.  I cut the cream cheese in half as others recommended and roasted my squash.  I don't know if it was because I had a really large squash or what but it turned out so thick you could eat it as a dip.  And I found it still too rich with the amount of cream cheese.

Amazing! I followed all instructions to a T, except I used 1/4 of the cream cheese called for, since we have family members that need to avoid fat where possible.   I also found that 2 squash made 12 cups cubed, maybe I just had large squash. It was a good thing though, because I doubled the recipe and ran out immediately!! Everyone gobbled it up and I had to send out several emails post-thanksgiving with the recipe.  P.S. - By accident, I added 1 whole tsp of cayenne pepper, and it was DELICIOUS!! For those of us who like spicy foods, of course. I don't recommend that much cayenne for the average person.  I would give this recipe a 6th star, but they won't let me.

I actually want to give this 4.5 stars, but that's not an option.  Loved it!  Bake the squash first and then peel it.  Also, try using low-fat cream cheese to make it healthier.  One package is all that is needed.  Up the cayenne if you like some heat.  You really can't go wrong with it.

Excellent! I sliced the squash in half, brushed with olive oil, added S &P, then roasted. I took the advice of others and only added one pkg. of cream cheese. The whole family enjoyed this. Next time I'll try adding the apple and cider as well. A little more sweetness would totally work in this recipe. Thanks Mary!

EASY EASY AND QUICK! I agree only one cream cheese, the soup loses that great squash flavor if you add more. I used boullion cubes, and next time I'll use butter instead of margarine. This is one of my favorite squash soups ever....

LOVED it - my family is watching cholesterol though, so i made a few changes: i didn't have marjoram, so we used a rosemary/garlic spice mix (the kind you can get for dipping bread in!) we used 8 oz. neufchatel cheese instead of cream cheese, and we got it to the consistency we needed (ours was rich and thick thick THICK) by adding skim milk. we topped ours off with a dollop of fat-free sour cream (so cool and creamy against the warm sweet/spicy soup) and had fresh-baked bread on the side.

The reviews were unanimous: waaaay too thick!  I used the full 2 blocks of cream cheese and it was overkill.  My son actually compared this *soup* to mashed potatoes!  That said, hubby and I agreed that it may be worth trying again with a whole lot less cream cheese and maybe a little extra spice.

Yummy!  Truly restaurant worthy.  I roasted the squash the night before, seasoned in salt, pepper and cinnamon.  This cut down on the cooking time the next day, and added a nice twist to the flavor.  I also only used half a bar of cream cheese, and it was plenty rich. Thanks for the great fall recipe!

Very Good, I only added 1/2 of the cream cheese,I used  low sodium chicken stock instead of water which is probably why it needed quite a bit of salt, I would say 1 teaspoon at least, I also added 1 tablespoon of tarragon vinegar right before serving. Would make a great first course for Thanksgiving dinner, Oh, I also used acorn instead of butternut squash...

EXCELLENT! Made this for my family - even my 12 y/o daughter loved this! Based on the previous reviews I decided to add one package of cream cheese and taste before adding the other...this was a good idea because it was perfect with just one cream cheese package! I would highly recommend using only one cream cheese! I also baked the squash first at 350 for 40 minutes. It's just easy to work with this way. This soup was delicious and satisfying and I will make it again!

This was a wonderful soup!  We used only three ounces of cream cheese otherwise it would have been just too rich.  Awesome flavor and aroma.  Added a little more cayenne pepper for a little more kick, but the recipe is awesome on its own - it tastes amazing without any doctoring.  Thanks to the cook who shared this new favorite recipe!

AMAZING!  I used butter instead of margarine, and chicken broth, cut the cream cheese to 1, 8oz pack, and added some roasted red pepper to the mix, blew my office staff away. I plan to make this for a Thanksgiving course.

Excellent as written.  You don't have to like squash to love this soup!

Yum. Soo good. Even with only half the cream cheese this soup is perfectly rich. Absolutely delicious and perfect for the fall. I've also made this soup with acorn squash and it tastes just as great.

This was absolutly delicious. But for sure, only add one block of cream cheese or even half of a block. Other than that, it was amazing. My mother in-law even approved. Yummy!!!

This is a very pretty dish. I really wish I liked it more. I cut back the cream cheese, but the resulting soup reminded me of baby food. I think the cream cheese just makes it too thick. I wonder if leaving out the cheese and adding a little half and half or whole milk would improve the consistency.

Mmmmmm. This was sooooo good.  I used half the cream cheese and a hand blender as suggested and it turned out great!  Will make again.

I would make this again, it was very good.  I only made a couple of adjustments, roasted butternut squash for 45 minutes, used 2 more cups of broth in the blender, and only used 4oz of cream cheese (it was very creamy). Gave it 4 stars because I tweaked it with added broth and cream cheese.  Flavor was very good.

Unbelievably good! I too baked my squash in the oven first. I used butter instead of margarine, 2 cans of chicken broth and cut the cream cheese in half. I didn't bother getting out the blender and all of the parts, I simply used my immersion blender right in the pot. Next time I will cut down on the cream cheese a bit more or try reduced fat cream cheese. This is now one of my favorite soups recipes and will be great during my Michigan winters.

Wow! I had to create an account just to comment on this recipe. I have been eating a great butternut squash soup at a restaurant for years, but I think I like this one better! And it's so easy to make! I just halved and microwaved my squash face down for 10 minutes or so until it was easily scooped out. Then I just added the squash, sauteed onion, and other ingredients right into the blender, instead of into a pot. I also added a little extra cayenne pepper just because I like a little extra spice. And less than half the cream cheese, but it was still a very rich and creamy soup. Will be eating this all winter!

I thought it was a very tasty soup. I used a food processor (since I didn't have a blender handy), and I thought it added too much air to the soup. Next time, I will use a food mill. Substituted rosemary for the marjoram.

Great flavor, made this for a friend who is undergoing radiation.  Roasted the squash, used two butternut's, could have used three of them.  Added carrots, used fat free Swanson's chicken broth, 6 oz of light cream cheese, and non fat yogurt starting with 1/2 cup but adding more in the blender to decrease the thickness.  Took awhile to make but will make again.

Good base, left out a package of cream cheese and added about half cup of sourcream instead.  Glad I did otherwise the soup would have been so rich there's no way it would have been suitable for as a main dish, great as a starter though.  Thank you for the recipe!

I actually was looking for a recipe to use for some butternut squash that was sitting in my freezer. I just tossed the squash into the chicken stock and cooked! I did not have marjoram on hand so I did add a touch of cumin (which gave it a smoky southwestern style flavor)and dill (which always tastes good on vegetables). My kids had seconds and wanted it for lunch the next day! Mmmmmmmmm!

added a 1/2 block of cr. cheese/1-2 c sour cream... added to butternut squash: 3 potatoes, 1 lg. sw. potato, roasted garlic,chic. stock, 3 sm. apples, extra onion and 1 c hvy. wh. cream. Fresh mint on top would be nice!  NOTE: leave part of this (maybe 1/4 of it) unpureed...or at least just partially pureed. We liked having some small chunks/texture with each bite. Top w/ nutmeg!

This is really good soup. I used about 150g of cream cheese and it was very creamy and delicious. Dh said it could do with a little more cream cheese, but I didn't think so. The cream cheese gives it a slightly sweet, very faint abstract taste that suits it well. I baked the squash with two cloves of garlic. The only problem was, this recipe took ages from start to finish. I made strawberry jam in about half the time. I gave this recipe 4 stars for the taste, though, not on timing as it was my choice to roast the 2 squash I had. I have tasted a better soup at a restaurant that I'm still trying to mimic. Thankyou for the recipe. Even my kids ate it!

This recipe is great! I made it directly as instructed the first time but the second time I made a few changes that I think make this outstanding! Instead of peeling and cubing the squash I just baked it with butter at 350 for about 45 min, it was much easier to cut the squash in half (or quarters depending on the size) than to peel and cube! Then I used only 8 oz of cream cheese and a little more water-probably because of my elevation. But these changes were wonderful! It was still creamy and delicious but not too creamy and thick like before, with 16 oz of cheese it tasted mostly like cream cheese, but with 8 it was much more balanced.

I made this soup last week. As suggested by other reviewers I roasted the squash first and used 8oz of light cream cheese. I also used vegetable boullion instead of chicken to make it suitable for vegetarians. It was easy, creamy and delicious. Great recipe!

I have to say this soup came out delicous. I also baked the squash first. The only problem i had is when it says to add the squash and cream cheese in the blender, do you add the broth also? and if you bake the sqaush do you boi; the rest of the ingrediants seperate while the squash is baking? Anyway I did use the two blocks of cream cheese- reduced fat- and it came out great. Thanks for the recipe.

The soup was very good, but I thought it was a little heavy on the cream cheese. Next time we'll only use one brick.  I used one butternut and one acorn squash and baked them first (I didn't notice they would be boiled in the recipe) and then blended them with the cream cheese and added that to the broth.  It came out incredibly creamy.

A few added details make this recipe superb! Roasting lots of garlic before hand and then adding it to the batch to blend later. Using half the cream cheese and buying broth instead of those super salty cubes. We had this for dinner all week (our squash was huge!) To  jazz it up we used croutons and pumpkin seeds. Yummy.

DELISH!!  The only thing I did differently was to roast the squash, use oregano instead of marjoram (that's all I had), and add 1/4 of the amount of cream cheese stated.  I served this at a dinner party and everyone kept asking me where I bought the soup from!

This is one of the best butternut soup recipes I have made.  I use less than one package of cream cheese and replace some broth with some apple juice or cider.

This was delicious.  I don't think I've ever had anything better.  I followed other reviewers' advice and roasted the butternut squash and halved the cream cheese.  It was sooo good.

I used 4 C. of vegetable broth, and  did not measure the squash and onions exactly, just sauteed what I had in butter.  I added a pear and used whipped cream cheese...perhaps 3/4 cup.  I think the pear lighten it up.  Served with croutons.  Very good!  Will definitely make again.

This was really good !
I also tossed the peeled and cut up butternut squash with olive oil and some garlic powder and roasted in the oven for 40 minutes. I think this process gives more flavor ! Then sauteed with onions, few fresh garlic cloves and couple slices of fresh ginger. Pureed everything together. Used only one cream cheese block. I did add more freshly grind black pepper and cayenne pepper at the end. HEARTY AND HEAVENLY !

YUM! I tweaked it a tad using oregano and basil because that's what I had and the blizzard outside didn't look too inviting for a trip to the market. I roasted the squash and roasted 7 or 8 cloves of garlic with it and added it all in. Also, I substituted chicken stock for water since I am vegetarian. I used one cream cheese, fat free and I sautéed the onions with the barest spray of oil and let them soften with low heat and their own moisture.  So very good and creamy and calorie friendly! Thanks for the recipe!

My wife and I found this recipe easy to follow and to prepare!  We followed the advice of other reviewers and cut the cream cheese serving down to just one 8oz package and also used the light version.  The consistency is quite thick and I think adding a bit more water to the cooking process would help (1 cup water to 1 bouillon cube which is normal).  I will definitely be making this soup again!

Made recipe as listed.  Very good.  Remember to choose a ripe squash, which is indicated by the flesh being darker orange.  Much more tasty when ripe.  Add curry if you'd like.

This is my favorite squash soup. I've made several times with and without the cream cheese (prefer without), with stock and 1 added boullion cube instead of water, and increased the cayenne b/c we like heat. It's a nice change from the brown sugar/cinnamon flavors you usually get with squash. Thanks for sharing!

excellent!!!!!!! wonderful!! what a refreshing soup to have on a cool october night. i took the advice of others and baked my squash with olive oil. i added garlic to my onions as they sauted and also added half of a granny smith apple to add some zip. it turned out very good. this soup is easy enough to make and the presentation is excellent. we are also going to add some spinach ravioli for a more filling soup. thanx for the recipe

I made this soup and pureed everything except the cream cheese the day before.  Before serving I pureed the soup base with the cream cheese and reheated.  It was great.  For fewer calories this soup tasted great even before the cream cheese was added.  Although if you aren't watching your waistline the cream cheese really put it over the top.

So Good! I also roasted the squash ahead of time.  So easy, but tastes time consuming.  I'm making it the night before Thanksgiving, and I know that the flavors will only get better by tomorrow! Thanks so much!

I really enjoyed making this, it was very easy and very good.  I also took the advice of other reviewers.  I made the recipe with 2 large butternut squash, I used 2 small onions, and chicken stock in stead of bouillon.  I roasted the Squash for 45 min at 400 degrees let it cool a little then peeled it.  For the two big squash I doubled the recipe but only put one 8oz pkg of Neufchatel cheese (its cream cheese just reduced fat).  It came out amazing!

I found that 2 packages of cream cheese was way to much for my taste - not only was it to creamy but it overpowered the butternut squash. That said the consistency was nice, but if I ever make this again I will be using only 1/4 of the suggested amount of cream cheese.

What a fantastic recipe! I halved the cream cheese, which uncovered the cayenne. As for baking the squash first - I'm the world's slowest vegetable peeler/chopper but I had no difficulty at all peeling/chopping from 'raw'. The next time I make this soup (which will probably be in the next couple of weeks!) I'll try them baked to experiment with the flavours.

I am sure the original recipe is awesome, but I altered it with what I had on hand. I used one large butternut squash baked and scooped out, three cups of vegetable broth, one pouch of cream cheese, and doubled the cayenne pepper. It was awesome! They cayenne pepper gives it a warm taste after that made my nose run, I loved it.

I didn't have any of the seasonings so I used Curry and pepper only. I also did what others suggested by baking my squash in the oven first then putting it in the blender. I only used 4oz. of weight watchers cream cheese. This soup was so good. I at the leftovers the next day. I also served it with garlic bread. My husband said I did a fantastic job for my first soup!

YUM! My husband and mother-in-law don't even like squash, but they both thought this was really good, too. I cut the fat a little bit by using 2 Tbs. of butter instead of 4, and using 1 package of low-fat cream cheese, rather than 2. SO good.

this was amazing.  My husband refuses to eat soup of any form, and he licked the bowl clean. Then ate the left overs before i could get to them.  I threw a bit more of the spices in it as well as some cream.

This recipe was great! I ended up only adding one package of cream cheese instead of two and it was still quite good. The soup was still delicious days later as well! I will definitely make this recipe again.

I only had 4 cups of butternut squash, so put in 1 cup of acorn squash and 1 cup of spaghetti squash.  I also added 1 1/2 cans of pure pumpkin.  Like one other review, I too roasted the squashes to bring out the full flavour!  I used 2 boxes of Campbell's chicken broth instead of bouillon.  I used butter instead of margarine to saute the onion.  I also added about 1 tsp of fresh ginger and an additional 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper.  The cream cheese is this recipe makes the recipe if you ask me!

I used 4 oz of low fat cream cheese and it was still rich, but great!  I didn't use quite as much better as called for.  I roasted the squash for about an hour at 350 with some olive oil, garlic powder, and pepper.  About 2# squash needed
ETA:  made with less cream cheese and it was not as good, and pepper really took over.  Would stick with my above review.

Excellent ~ The only thing I did different was I used Chicken stock instead of water (extra flavor) And at the end before serving the soup I added some fresh nutmeg.

This recipe was great! I used only about 5 oz of cream cheese and I think it was plenty. I will definitely make this soup again.

Excellent recipe! These are the adjustments that I made: I used canned chicken broth instead of the boullion cubes and water and, as another reviewer said, 4 oz of cream cheese is just fine!
Thank you!

The soup was really good and creamy. I like my soups a little less creamy so I will be adding more veggie broth next time. My husband loved it.

I loved this soup, although my family didn't eat it! But that's o.k. - I've been having it for lunch woth croutons on top. I used a homemade chicken stock I had in the freezer in place of the water. Also, I only used about 1/2 brick of cream cheese. (i know the recipe called for two - I thought it had only called for one and saw other comments about using less cream cheese. I will mkae again.

This recipe is really good but my husband and I like heartier soups so I added potatoes and zucchini and it was great.  I also added a tablespoon of hot sauce.  My husband said it is way better as left overs as well.

I was looking for a recipe for butternut squash sauce for ravioli, a favorite of mine at a local italian place.  I used this recipe as the base, blended everything well and topped with parmesan cheese.  We certainly enjoyed it.

Fantastic.
I made it according to the recipe, but I found that the cream cheese made it a little too thick for my liking, so I added about a 1/2 cup of milk. Also, it is an excellent dip when could, very good with cooked broccoli.

I hate butternut squash, so I didn't care for this, but my family LOVED it. So if you like squash this is for you, but it's very squash-y tasting.

I also oven roasted the squash before hand.  Made it much quicker to put together.  My 9 year old daughter loved this.  I added the called for cream cheese and I thought it was fine, very rich and creamy. Needed a little salt but otherwise great recipe that will go in our do-over file.  Oh, I just made half a batch.

I Looove this soup!!! I made it for Thanksgiving last year and it was a favorite! I have made it several times since, and now it's my favorite! It's one of those soups that you just can't foul up, turns out beautifuly every time. Sometimes you don't have enough cream cheese, or cream... no problem with this recipe. I like to change up the flavor sometimes with curry powder, roasted garlic, or cilantro. Y-U-M!!!!!

Never made squash soup before but someone brought me a ton from their garden and thought I'd give it a try. This is an awesome recipe because you can't hardly mess it up. I've made it with one cream cheese, I've used light cream cheese, I've frozen the squash, I've experimented with the spice amounts (love the cayenne)and all batches have turned out wonderful. Baking the squash first is super easy and more tasty compared to boiling. If you don't have anything against pureed soups, try it!

Very good.  I used 1/2 the (light) cream cheese and extra cayenne.  My squash was out of season, so I had to add a couple of tablespoons of sugar.  That made it perfect.

My brother, Steve, loved this!  I used only 1 (8 oz.) package cream cheese and used chicken stock instead of the water and bouillons.  I also sauteed the onions in olive oil instead of maragarine. Thanks for the recipe!

I have made some modifications to this recipe and it is a regular for my family in the fall.  My children request this soup and it is my daughters favorite.  

I use only about 1/2 of a package of cream cheese rather than 2 whole packages.  I omit the cayenne and black pepper, which is my personal preferance, my husband adds the pepper in his bowl.  This soup freezes well, and when I don't have access to fresh local butternut, I use two bags of frozen squash, although it does result in a thinner soup.  

Thank you so much for this recipe!

I needed soup in a hurry so I used cartons of organic butternut squash soup. I used 3 of these and 4 cups chicken broth. I added italian turkey sausage and browed it with my onion and garlic first. I couldn't resist adding 1/4 of sherry. I added everything else and used only 8oz of the cream cheese. It was heavenly and took only minutes to prepare. Now I crave this soup!

Good soup but came out too sweet for my taste.  I added 1 granny smith apple to onion saute and 1/2 cup apple juice as one reader suggested.  Could have been why it tasted so sweet!  Definitely recommend oven roasting the squash, it really brings out the flavor.

my family loves this recipe. I made many of the changes that previous people stated. I used only 8 oz of low fat cream cheese. Since squash has risen in  price I purchased frozen winter squash in the frozen vege section and works well. I add minced garlic, a couple of apples and a little juice if I have some. Then I puree with my stick blender. Tonight I even added a can of pumpkin and some frozen squash and it is just as yummy!

Pure. Autumn. Heaven.  This is OH SO GOOD...I've made it several times and have passed the recipe on to friends per their request.  I like roasting the cubed squash to get it carmelized and only use half the called for cream cheese.  The cayenne gives it that little extra something! Thanks!

I made this Butternut Squash Soup for our Christmas dinner.  I took the advice of various others:  I cut the squash in in half and put each half in the microwave for 10 minutes then scooped it out.  This proved to be very easy and took much less time.  I also reduced the cream cheese by half, using only one 8 oz container.  I also used 4 cups of chicken broth from a can instead of 3.  Everyone loved it, even the kids ate multiple helpings after they got past the color.  I think the cayenne pepper is very important to this recipe.  It gives it that special something that just makes the soup.  Will make this again and soon!

Like many others here I edited the recipe slightly.. I used 3/4 the cream cheese called for, alittle more stock to make it less dense, and I added a pinch of pumpkin pie spice per 6 servings.  Big hit at Thanksgiving.. many friends have asked for the recipe or by request for parties I attend.

I've taken this to 2 soup festivals and it is always the first soup to disappear! I halved the cream cheese, used chicken stock instead of bouillan and water and added more cayenne. Mmmmmmm...Excellent!!!!!

Oh my GOD this is AMAZING!!!!  I never thought I'd like butternut squash soup, but one of my students gave me a butternut squash and I have been looking for something to do with it that didn't involve sugar.  So I figured I'd give this recipe a shot.  And now I think I'm hooked!  I'm a vegetarian, so I used vegetable bullion instead of chicken and I only used half the cream cheese, but it was delish!

omigoodness so good!I tweaked the recipe a little bit...the first time i made this recipe i used the full amount of cream cheese and found that it was way too thick, so the second time i scaled way back and used a dollop of plain yogurt instead.  I also used chicken stock, real butter as well as ginger and nutmeg..it was so good! a real hit at the party i hosted.
thanks!

A good start, but falls short. With some tweaking, however, it can be excellent. For starters, maybe 1/4 of the cream cheese and about 1/4 cup of half and half. Also, more squash and cayenne with the addition of nutmeg. I included more onion too. Squash was overpowered by the richness of the cream cheese.

This is SO Yummy just as written!!! I made it a second time with an extra acorn squash I had, So I figured I would tweaked it big time... I boiled & smashed one butternut & one acorn together, added about 2 teaspoons of cayenne, about 1 tablespoon garlic, one whole onion, 2 packs cream cheese, 3 cups chicken stock... blended it all together... Mmmm it was thick & delish...

I took the advice of others and only used 1/2 of the amount of cream cheese recommended and roasted my squash in the oven.  Was wonderful!

So good - I didn't have cayenne pepper so I added a few red pepper flakes and it still came out awesome.  I served it with toasted french bread.

VEGETARIAN VERSION
I served this for a dinner party and it got high raves. Two people emailed me the next day for the recipe. 
However, I made one small change; I used vegetarian bullion instead of chicken. Trust me.....no one missed the chicken stock!

Don't get me wrong, the taste of this soup is fantastic but it needs a little tweeking.  If you follow the recipe perfectly, you'll find (as did I) that this soup is way, way, way too thick.  If this soup is the only thing you'll have for dinner, then it's okay.  If you plan to use it as an appetizer, add some more chicken broth to get it to the consistency that you'll prefer.  You can also get by using only one cream cheese.  Everyone enjoyed the soup but agreed it was too rich.  Good flavor just too thick!

I halfed this recipe because I had only one squash which yielded about 3 cups.  I didn't have marjoram so I did a Google search and discovered that oregano is a stronger cousin so I used that instead. The only other thing that I added was about two cloves of chopped garlic and about 1/2 tsp. of salt to balance the sweetness.  I used 4 oz. of reduced fat cream cheese and it was just right.  I will make this again since it was super easy and went together quickly since I pre-cooked the squash in the microwave.

if i could've given this 4.5 stars, i would have.  very good and easy soup.  great with ham or turkey sandwiches.  my kids licked it up too, which is what is really important.  i only added one 8 oz. cream cheese after alot of the reviewers said this was the way to go.  i didnt think the soup was too rich or had too much cream cheese - just right!  the reason why i didnt give it 5 stars is because although it was very good, it didnt "pop".  seems like there was something missing and i am not that great of a chef to figure it out.  maybe it would help to add a little garlic.  i didnt add the suggested cayenne amount cos i was worried it would be too much for my kids, so maybe that was the kick that was missing??(but i dont think so)  overall it is a great fall recipe!  thank you.

This soup has a really nice flavor. I only used 1/4 the amount of cream cheese (half of one block), and it's still very creamy and rich. I only used one butternut squash, medium size, which obviously isn't 6 cups worth -- but still carried the nutty/sweet squash flavor nicely. (I roasted it in the oven for 1/2 hr, as other reviews suggested). Next time I'd use a larger squash just to give it a little more thickness, and a slightly fuller flavor.

As the recipe stands, I thought this soup was only okay. It had a beautiful texture, and a good basic flavor, but wasn't anything special. I took other reviewers' advice and only used half the suggested amount of cream cheese. I tweaked it by adding 1 tsp. of cinnamon for depth of flavor, 1 cup of good grated parmesan, 2/3 cup sour cream, and equal amounts of milk and chicken broth to thin it down to my desired consistency. With these changes I thought it was pretty good, but will continue to play with this recipe until I get it just right.

So delicious!  I used dried oregano because I didn't have any marjoram. I also halved the cream cheese and it was plenty rich.  I made a double recipe so we had leftovers the next day, and I was still wishing I had more!

This soup was ok for a little while but then couldn't keep eating it because it is so rich.  The flavour just became overwhelming.  Too much fat even though I cut down on the cream cheese like others suggested.  I'll stick to my regular pumpkin soup next time.

Very delicious soup.  I followed some advice to bake the squash that way it will be easier to cut in pieces.  I used less than half of cream cheese of an 8 oz package.  Also used some curry powder, very tasting, a new favorite...

This soup was a hit at thanksgiving dinner after I made a couple of changes.  The first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly and found it too salty and way to rich with the full amount of cream cheese.  So instead of adding chicken boullion cubes I made the water into chicken stock and only put in 1/4 of the cream cheese called for in the recipe.  I also used light cream cheese.  The result was a yummy creamy soup great for a cold winters day.

I'm so glad I took others advice and cut the cream cheese by 1/4.  It was great but if you use the entire 16 oz of cream cheese, I think it would over power the squash.  We also cooked the squash in the oven to make it easier to peel and cube.  Glad we did.  Thanks to all with the great advice.

This wasn't any more time consuming than any other homemade soup,and came out really nice. I used only one package of reduced fat cream cheese, which was plenty creamy, and veggie broth instead of chicken. I gave it five stars since both my kids, ages 5 and 14 months, loved it!

It only took 1 butternut squash to get the six cups needed.  I wish I had known that going into it- since I cooked two.  Good taste, but it kind of looks like nacho cheese.

I can't say if this is the best recipe because I followed the advice of previous reviews.  So I would give the reviewers 5 stars!!  I roasted the squash, which made it much easier to cut up.  I used a mixture of bouillion, chicken broth and Better Than Bouillion because I didn't have enough of any of them.  I skipped the cream cheese, added a little garlic and some sherry.  It was plenty thick enough and very tasty.  I will try it again and add a smidge of cream cheese to see how it tastes, but I didn't need the extra calories this time.

This is one of my favorite recipes of any type.  This soup was SO good!  I followed the recipe exactly, but I would do 2 things differently next time:  (1) As recommended by many others, I would cut the cream cheese in half; and (2) I will try roasting in the oven rather than trying to cut it first and then cook it on the stovetop from raw.

This is a really good butternut squash recipe, although I think the restaurant versions are better. I doubled the recipe and added some sherry (I peeked at other recipes!). The butternut squash is a real pain to cut so I took the advice of another reviewer and baked it in the over for 45 minutes. Turned out terrific, but just took a long time. I can't wait to do this soup again for my family at Thanksgiving!

Fairly easy to make.  We added a cooked apple to the recipe and roasted pecans on top.  It had an overpowering taste of cream cheese which I didn't care for.  I think next time we will eliminate that ingrediant altogether and it will taste more like I expected.

Delicious soup!  But like the others, I only added 8 oz. of cream cheese and that was PLENTY.  I can't imagine what it would be like with 16 oz!  I didn't add the cayenne because I wanted my girls to eat it, so I had that on the side for hubby.  I did add something different that made it even more delicious:  I sliced and chopped fresh ginger root (about a tablespoon) and added that to the onions as they were cooking in the butter.  This added a nice taste to the squash and I highly recommend it!

a wonderful soup on a cool fall night. it has a wonderful sweet yet spicy taste, that go so well together. i used half of the cream cheese as did the other viewers. i used chicken broth instead of cubes, taste more authentic. i sauted some onions, celery, carrots and potatoes and added them to the mixture. i blended only half of the mixture in the blender and lightly smashed the other in the pot to give it a little something to grab on to. it turned out wonderful. i would highly recommend this soup.

Cheese soup!  I used only half the cheese stated and it was still far too cheesy.  Has the potential to be good, but will swap cheese for 250ml milk next time.

This recipe is simple, but delicious.  Having made it twice, I've found this a hearty, tasty soup.  However, the first time I made the soup, I used canned low sodium chicken stock which I found preferable to bouillon cubes and hot water.  I did increase the spices as well as add 1/2 tsp ground cloves which works nicely.

Excellent soup. I've made it twice during dinner parties. Leftovers reheat surprisingly well. I used half the cream cheese, like many other reviewers, and followed the rest of the instructions to the letter. It's a favourite now. Cheers.

This recipe is fantastic.  I have made it countless times this winter. The only change I made is to add chopped garlic and celery in with the onion to saute. Thanks for the keeper!

Very good soup. I kicked the spices up a notch because I was craving spicy - used black pepper, cayenne, mild curry powder & a pinch of nutmeg. I used 1/2 the cream cheese called for, but still noticed that the soup smelled really... cheesy. Didn't taste too cheesy, but the aroma was affected. I think next time I'll go with heavy cream instead. Getting the warm pulp out of a squash that's been roasted or in the microwave without burning your fingers is hard enough, I am not even going to attempt to peel those suckers raw!

Like others, I cut out some of the cream cheese, I used less than one block.  We serve this as a yummy lighter meal in the fall with a side of sliced apples, cheeses, and water crackers.

I'll keep it short.  Super soup.  I only used 8oz of cream cheese and used the 1/3 fat version.  I only used 2 1/2 cups water.  I used about 1/4 tsp cayenne, maybe a tad more because I like a little more spice.  I roasted it with EVOO and Salt and Pepper (350 for 45min).  I also added extra fresh ground pepper at the end...Superb.

Definitely too much cream cheese in here. I think half the quanitiy would be better. Sorry about the low star rating but I think the overall average of 5 stars is misleading as the recipe needs to be altered to taste nice. After making it with the original quanities we used the soup as a sauce over broccoli and it was delicious.

My first Butternut Squash Soup!  Turned out awesome!  I did follow the advice from another reviewer and added only 4 oz. cream cheese - 1/3 fat.  It was really thick!  Used chicken bouillon too and a dash of curry.  Didn't have marjoram either but it still tasted delicious!  Next time I will try the soup with heavy cream instead of cream cheese to make the soup thinner.  I will experiment with other spices and herbs too I think it needs a little more flavor. My 8 month old loves the soup too so it's a winner at our house!  Thanks for sharing!

Excellent recipe. Used Pacific chicken broth instead of bouillon which allowed me to salt the final product to my liking. One package of cream cheese was plenty. Opting for a milder version, used thyme instead of the cayenne. Sliced up cold, sweet Fuji apples and generously garnished the soup with the apple chunks and a dollop of sour cream in the center just before serving. Perfect!

i roasted the butternut squash and pretty much followed the recipe, but this isn't as great as everyone has said it is...it's a bit too creamy for my liking. it's also missing something, but i can't quite put my finger on it...i added some ground ginger in it and it helped but i don't think i'll be making this again.

This was very good.  I followed the suggestion of other reviewers, and pre-baked the squash.  After sauteeing the onions, I added the boullion cubes, seasonings, and only one cup of water to the pan, then added only one package of non-fat cream cheese, to warm.  Then, I pureed it in the food processor, and returned to the pan.  The pre-baked squash was pureed in the food processor, with the remaining 2 cups of water, then also added to the pan to warm.  Be sure not to boil the mixture after the cream cheese is added, or it will separate.  This is a lovely, rich tasting soup, with very little fat, if you reduce the butter and use fat-free cream cheese.  Yum!

fabulous soup considering everyone else's alterations--less creamcheese, etc. I also used some zucchini since didn't have a full 6 c. of winter squash. Don't need to dirty an extra pan to fry onions first, either, just boiled them with the squash. Used butter instead of margarine...better flavor.

I LOVE this soup, and I don't even like squash!  I did cut the cream cheese in half as suggested by many other posters, and it was plenty.  I like a nice thick puree, so I reserved a little of the liquid before blending and was glad I did;  you can always add it back in if you like yours a little thinner.  I found that my trusty stick blender was WAY easier than the food processor too. I also followed the lead of many other posters and microwaved the squash to make it easier to peel and cube (quarter it and scoop out the seeds, meat side down for 5 minutes).  It has a little kick to it because of the pepper & cayenne, but my guests and I didn't think it was too much.  If you have a sensitive stomach you might want to cut back on them and then taste.  ENJOY!!

This is a very nice soup, but I tasted it after one cream cheese and it was more than enough.  Any more and it would be cream cheese soup.

Very good soup. I exchanged 2 T of onion for some fresh garlic to add some more flavor. Just make sure that you leave plenty of time to actually cut the squash (it's very hard!).

Sorry, but I just didn't think this soup was very flavorful.  Maybe my squash was not up to par...I measured everything carefully and didn't stray from the recipe (except to only use 1 block of cream cheese instead of 2, and to use chicken broth instead of water & bouillon).  I sprinkled a little cinnamon sugar on top of my bowl and that was a big improvement.  But, it was very easy to make, and maybe I'll try making it again with a better squash!  Thanks Mary for sharing.

This soup is amazing. I made it exactly to the recipe, but added a bit more cayenne pepper. I was concerned that the pound of cream cheese would be too much, but after I let it set overnight, it was fabulous. This will become a fall and winter staple! Thanks again all recipes!

Yummy, Yummy, Yummy!!  I also used just one block of cream cheese and used 4 cups chicken broth.  Even my five year old asked for more!

This was a very easy recipe and my toddler even loved it.  She is such a picky eater!  We will have this soup often during the winter months.

This was tasty, but I think next time I will use less cream cheese. I used the same proportions of ingredients, but I used one bag of peeled and cubed butternut squash from Trader Joe's and microwaved it, in the bag, for the recommended 5 1/2 minutes. It made this soup super quick and easy.

I was surprised and pleased by this recipe.  I love squash, but am not a huge fan of butternut squash.  However, this recipe was a definite winner with me.  The soup was creamy but not too rich.  I did have a little difficulty pureeing everything after I cooked it, because I had to use a ladle to transfer the soup to a blender, which was a messy process.  I also added about half the cream cheese, and used low fat to decrease the calories.  It still had fantastic flavor.  One thing I would recommend that really helps cut down on the prep time is if you buy the butternut squash already diced, then just cook it with the chicken broth.  I've found it pre-diced at Trader Joe's.

Have made this recipe several times and my friends can't get enough of it.  Didn't have cayenne pepper the first time so used crushed pepper.  Went back to using the crushed pepper really had a nice bite to it. My thanks to Mary.

This soup tastes great. I love the spices. However, the amount of cream cheese this recipe calls for is WAY over the top. I started adding the cheese slowly and had to stop at about 3 ounces. Even the 3 ounces I found was too much. I ended up cooking up approx another cup of squash and added 1/2 cup more water. This thinned it out enough so it wasn't so thick and rich.

Changed the prep. a little.  Roasted a large squash and two med. onions with about half a head of garlic until the squash was tender.  Then pureed all in the food processor.  Doubled all the spices and added a 1/4 t. of Allspice and a bay leaf.  Dropped in chunks of one 8oz. pkg. of cream cheese while simmering on the stovetop.  We all LOVED it.  Had some kick, but not enough to knock you over.  Next time might use a hand mixer or a blender to see if I can get it even smoother.

Delicious!  This soup has such a wonderful mild flavor, and it's so rich and creamy.  I made mine using about 12 oz of cream cheese rather than 16 oz, and it was just perfect.  My husband already wants to know when I am going to make it again.  Spectacular!

This fall soup is fantastic!  Make sure you roast the squash for at least on hour.  After the squash is roasted, let cool and scoop out into kettle.  Invest in a and held mixer--you can puree the squash right on the stove.

I tried this and was really disappointed. I'm not quite sure if it was because I've never tried butternut squash before but I did not like it. It had an odd flavor to me.

My  friend served a squash soup at her wedding as an appetizer, and I was hoping to relive the experience, but this wasn't quite the flavor I was hoping for. I did halve the cream cheese, which I think was a good suggestion, but still not "the best" in my opinion.

It was easier than I thought to make.  I used canned chicken broth instead of bouillon and water.  I also substituted heavy whip cream for the cream cheese (it was all I had on hand).

This soup is absolutely delicious. 
I only added about 1/2 a package cream cheese and I thought it was more than enough. 
I will definitely make this soup again!

This was the first time I'd tried butternut squash soup and both my husband and I loved it.  Rich and creamy; great flavor.  Would be a nice soup to serve as the first course for an elegant dinner with friends.

Wow!  Wow!!  Wow!!!  I used one block of cream cheese (1/3 lower fat) and it was wonderful!  My 2 year old got a taste and came running back to me saying, "Mommy, I neeeeed moooore soup."  Go figure, my husband said it was ok, but the rest of us loved it.  I halved the squash, seeded it,  and nuked it for 4 minutes to soften it.  It was much easier to peel and cube then.

I’ve made this recipe several times with success.  Since I dislike cutting the squash, I bake it in the oven for 1 hour at 350 degrees along with one head of garlic – sprinkled with olive oil.  (roasted garlic)

I’ve used vegetable broth as well as chicken broth.  One package of the cream cheese instead of the two.  I’ve also skipped the seasoning other than a pinch of the cayenne pepper.

Yummy! Of course, I used a little over half a package of light cream cheese, and I didn't have any marjoram, so I subbed other spices, but I'll have to buy the marjoram next time.

Yummy soup for a cool autumn evening... and so easy!I roasted the onions and squash first,intensfied the flavor immensely. No majoram in my cupboard so added powdered ginger and thyme...and only a 1/3 of the cream cheese(low fat). I can't imagine 16 oz of cream cheese in this soup!!! Also made my own stock last month and it made the soup that much better. A GREAT soup, so rich it makes a meal with a green salad and some bread.

I made this for Thanksgiving last year and my guests have been raving about it ever since (and insisting that I make it again this year). I roasted the squash beforehand and used just 1/2 a block of light cream cheese and it turned out just right. I have a newfound appreciation for squash!!

I was looking for an easy recipe for squash soup. I always look at the ingredients to see if I have most of them in my cabinets.  I couldn't believe this was so easy to make.  Not only did I think is was wonderful...my husband..who by the way...does not like squash thought it was absolutely delicious!  I served it for lunch with my friends and the next time I will have to make a double bach!  Thanks to Mary for a wonderful and easy recipe.

Great soup, after a few modifications. Leave out the spices and cream cheese, and roast the squash for better flavout. Instead of the recommended spices, add the following, for a really flavourful, rich soup:

1-1.5 Tbsp Thai Yellow Curry Paste
1 Tbsp. brown sugar
1/2 can coconut milk
1 tsp. Thai Fish sauce
juice of 1 lime

Adjust spice to taste, and enjoy!

I loved this.  I too used 1/2 to 3/4 of just one cream cheese.  And I added 2 fresh garlic gloves.  And I too put the squash in the oven after I chopped it up for about 15 min.  It was very good.  I can't wait to make it again.

Perfect for these bitter Canadian winters. I used vegetable bouillion instead of chicken so that I could share it with a vegetarian friend. The cream cheese does wonders for the texture, whether you use a little or a lot. I also tried a batch with a couple of skinned pears pureed into it, which sounds a bit bizarre but adds a lovely subtle flavour. Thanks so much!

Of all the courses I served for Thanksgiving, this was the one everyone raved about the most, even the non-soup eaters.  They were lucky there was enough since my family and I ate so much of it before they came.  Thanks to other reviewers, I also cut the cream cheese in half. Thanks for the tips

DELICIOUS, DELICIOUS DELICIOUS.  You will not be disappointed with this soup.  I did use other's advice, and baked the squash in the oven, then hollowed out the pulp.  I made this recipe with one 3-lb butternut squash.  I only added 1/2 of ONE block cream cheese, and it turned out AWESOME!  I can hardly wait for my family to try this.  Thanks so much for sharing.  This is a KEEPER!

Amazing.  It won rave reviews at home, and rave reviews when I took some leftovers to my parents.  Will definitely cut down the amount of cream cheese and use neufchatel next time, as it was very rich (but still very good).

This soup is sooo good!!!  I followed advice of others by using only 1 pkg of cream cheese and it was wonderful!  Only problem was I didn't realize how filling this would be and prepared an entire meal with it!  We would have been fine with just the soup & fresh bread!  KEEPER - Thanks Mary!

I am not a big fan of creamy soups, so I cut down on the cream cheese as suggested.  I make it for one and I only use 1 ounce of cream cheese.  I've been making it with pumpkin, and it is so tasty.  I've made it 3 times in the past 2 weeks, so maybe I should rescale it again to make more!

This soup is ok.  It definetly needs more spices in it and less then half the cream cheese.  I used one 8 oz package and I felt like I was eating melted cream cheese with a zing.  I did add chicken and top it with tortilla chips, this help cut back the heaviness a little.  It was easy to do, just not my personal favorite recipe.

Excellent soup! I used a hard shell squash and my friend used a Hubbard (?) squash and they both turned out great. We did cut the cream cheese down to one package. Thanks for the recipe

Great recipe!  I have been looking for a squash soup and this one is good and very quick and easy to make.  I added some curry powder and it added some spice to the soup if you like that.

I make this rich creamy soup many times each fall & winter since I found it on this website. Last year it was a very impressive first course for our Thanksgiving meal.
I have used half the amount of cream cheese, it is very rich and half the amount is fine.
Really delicious and easy. The only hard part is cutting up the hard squash, but it's worth it.
My sister took a crockpot full to a party and it was empty in no time.
A winner!

This recipe is excellent!  It's tastes like it takes hours to make but of course it doesn't!  I think I only had about 4 cups of squash so I only included 1/2 pkg of LIGHT cream cheese.  The richness still seems so sinful!  I chopped the squash into small cubes, to help with cooking and the later pureeing.  I also cubed the cream cheese before adding to the blender.  I will be memorizing this one!  Thanks, Mary!

Quite good, but a little spicy.  It makes a lot of soup and, as there are just two of us, I freeze half of it to enjoy later.

I followed the advice of using only 1/2 the cream cheese, and it still turned out very creamy and cheesy.  I think next time I will use only 1/4 of the cream cheese, and perhaps add a bit of milk.  Also, I think i will try a bit of allspice.  I also followed the advice of baking the squash for 40 minutes before dicing, that made it very easy to blend.  I will definitely make this again.  Yummy!

I was so dissapointed in the final result of this soup because it really was like baby food in consistency- so much so that we had to throw it out.  And I also cut down on the cream cheese.  Before I added the cream cheese and pureed it,  I kept tasting the broth and thought it was very good, so I anticipated a great soup.  Then it was a huge pain to puree in batches, and we couldn't even eat the final soup!  I might attempt this again, but will not puree.  Also, what made it much easier was buying the pre-packaged cut p butternut squash our supermarket sells.  You just throw it in- no cutting involved.  Anyhow, the broth tastes good, so it is a good base.

I served this for a dinner for 20.  It was a huge hit. My family was very pleased I had leftovers. I modified it slightly by using chicken broth, using only 2 packages of cream cheese and substituted hot sauce for the cayenne.
If I was a making a quantity for 6 I don't wouldn't put in any cream cheese.  It would still be perfect.

What a great recipe!  I made a couple of modifications....I used a whole onion and included chopped carrot and celery.  I also decreased the cream cheese to one 8 oz pkg.  This recipe would make a great first course to your Thanksgiving Day meal!

I accidently added more cayanne pepper (my shaker broke as I was using it), but decided to take it to a dinner party anyway.  The extra spice was a welcomed surprised and everyone asked what ingredient gave the soup that extra kick.  The only person who went home with an empty dish was me!

Delicious.  I used 1/2 the cream cheese and I thought it was still a bit too rich.  Next time I'll cut the butter down some.

I LOVE this soup.  I used half the amount of cream cheese and used reduced fat.  I cooked my chicken in it while the squash cooked and it was fabulous.  It makes a good sauce for chicken and pasta too.  My 13 year old though it was 'ok' which is high praise for a vegetable from him.

Yum! I roasted the squash and scooped it out. Used sauted onion and garlic, also pepper and tumeric. Skipped the cream cheese. Don't want all that saturated fat! Pureed with chicken stock to desired consistency. Looking forward to squash season next year! I think I'll plant some just so I can make plenty of this soup!

I loved this soup!  The most difficult part was peeling the squash (I used 2).  In the future I may bake it and scoop out the insides.  I also made a few other changes.  I used 2 cans chicken broth, only 8 oz of cream cheese, and allspice in place of the marjoram.  Even with my slight changes, the soup was fantastic.  It will become a staple around here.

I've never had squash before and decided to take a gamble after watching a chef make it on TV. I am not dissapointed. This is really good...you won't be sorry.

What a great way to eat squash!  I love soups in general, but frankly, this was one of the best soups I've ever made!!  My 17 month old loved it which is pretty amazing since I served him cubed butternut squash the day before and he was spitting it out.  As a modification, I cooked the squash in the microwave, only put in 1 tub (8 oz) of light cream cheese (I couldn't imagine putting in 2!), used canned chicken broth and pureed with a hand mixer right in the microwave bowl.  Like others have mentionned, the only time consuming task was peeling and cubing the squash, but it is soooo worth it!

This recipe is very good and very easy.  I did halve the cream cheese.  To lighten the fat I used lowfat cream cheese.  This is now a favorite in our house.  I'm not a big fan of sweet squash recipes so this is great for me!

One of my favorite comfort foods, this soup takes some time (mostly to peel and cut up the squash, but it's worth it. I usually get one large or two small squashes and make a big batch. Sometime I add a dollop of homemade pesto instead of the herbs. Once I adapted it into lobster butternut bisque by coking the squash in stock made from lobster shells instead of chicken broth. And eight ounces of cream cheese is plenty.

Even if you are leary about eating "squash soup" you'll love this.  It is very rich with 8 oz. of cream cheese; I can't imagine it with twice that!

This soup was excellent. I only used an 8oz package of cream cheese and it was still super creamy.  I added cashews as well to give the soup texture.  I highly recommend.

This is one of the best soups I've ever had!!  I served it to friends who all wanted the recipe.  Even a man who doesn't like squash loved this soup.  I used only 12 oz. of cream cheese, doubled the pepper.  I baked the squash in the oven first, and then used my hand mixer to blend in the cheese.  YUMMY!!

I had squash left over in the fridge and didn't know what to do with it.  I scanned the site
for a fast and easy reciepe and stumbled upon this one.  I am so glad I did, my kids loved it!
We don't really care too much for squash on its own but I can see this soup becoming a 
weekly "must-have".  I took it to work and everyone raved about it as well. THANKS!!!

Delicious recipe.  Made a slight variation to the recipe. I added white asaparus and chives.  Garnished with a beautiful flower.  Quick and easy.  The only time consuming part was cutting and preparing the squash.

This soup is delicious.  Make it on a crisp fall day when squash are plentiful and hot soup would surely warm you up!  I used only 1 8oz. cream cheese as suggested and the flavor was wonderful.  I also used my hand blender and pureed the soup right in the pot instead of pouring it into my blender a little at a time because hot liquids expand in a blender once it's turned on.  Less dishes to wash!

I made this recipe w/the extra squash from the garden...took me about 10 minutes to prepare and 30 minutes to cook.  A WONDERFUL soup that is easy and quick.  I'm not sure how kids would like it.  I modified the recipe for only 4 cups of squash, and only used about 5oz cream cheese, and it was excellent!  Everyone that tried it raves!

This is a yummy fall and winter soup.  Nice and hearty.  It is very rich with the 16 oz. of cream cheese, and works better with the 8 oz....better "squash" flavor without losing anything.  My company (and I) loved it!

Baked/roasted or microwaved squash is much easier than peeling.  I didn't have cream cheese but did have squash and real homemade chicken broth.  My sub was about 1/4 C half & half and 1/4 C milk.  This was pretty tasty.  I will try again with the cream cheese but just one and only have a small amount with lunch for several people.  I did the math on 2 blocks of cream cheese for 6 people.  I think this could several variations of spice from hot, to southwest, to pumpkin spices.  I plan to use this as a basic recipe and vary it.

Loved!  Roasted the squash ahead for easier cutting and added less cream cheese only because I didn't have the full amount.  I'm sure it's good with full amount too.

I put a little Chinese hot oil drizzled around the soup. I had baked a butternut squash last night so I used the leftover squash to make this delicious soup. I put leftover salmon on top. It was soooo good! Veg and protein in one dish. I will make this again.

Excellent soup.  Using what  I had available I substituted scallions for onions and oregano for marjoram.  The slight spice and cheese taste made this the best butternut squash soup I ever tasted.

I cut the butternut squash in bigger pieces and put in a pot of boiling water for 15 mins approx.  Then drained and cool the squash. Then I peeled the skin off each piece. It may have taken more time but it is hard to cut uncook squash. In the meantime, while the squash was cooling I mixed all the other ingredients in the pot except the cream and butter.  After I added the Cooked squash and the cream cheese and butter I used hand blender and pureed all together. It was the perfect thick soup for a cold winter night!. I added nutmeg and salt & pepper, my husband added salt & pepper. Add more seasoning to your Desiree. I will make it again and share it with friends.

This is my new favourite squash soup. It’s so much easier and less ingredients than most recipes so it appealed to me. I don’t have a blender or immersion blender so I made a few adjustments. I cooked the squash in the microwave. I cut it in half and covered it with plastic wrap and cooked it until it was tender. Check it every 8 minutes. Then I sautéed the finely chopped onions in the margarine. I used one 8 oz. cream cheese because that’s all I had in the house. I used a food processor and blended the squash, cream cheese that I cut into small pieces and the onions. Then I whisked in the broth. I also had 4 cups of  vegetable broth to use up so I used that. It made the soup a bit thinner but I don’t think the end result was changed just the process.  Very good recipe.

I've made this dozens of times using this recipe and I Love it!!!! I use less cream cheese to reduce the calories and it's still delicious. I bake cut squash in the oven as others have recommended to make it easier to peel. YUM!

Delicious. I followed the recipe exactly, except I only used 1 package of cream cheese (and it was low-fat). Will be making this again and again!

Awesome recipe.  This has become a family favorite.  Love the hint of "kick".  It's a pleasant surprise in the soup.  Just cut the cream cheese down to one 8 ounce package to cut some of the calories.  Didn't comprise on taste at all.

Yum!!! I was worried it would be too rich with 2 blocks of cream cheese but it really wasn't. I used a whole butternut squash. Also, used vegetable stock to make it vegetarian.

This was a great base recipe! Like the other reviews mention, I roasted the squash after cutting it into 8 pieces for an hour at 350°F with a mixture of black pepper, Himalayan salt, freshly minced garlic, and olive oil. It comes right out of the skin with a spoon! I’m in college, so I don’t have a blender or a food processor. I just mashed the hot squash with the cream cheese using a large spoon and incorporated it into the soup after adding the broth and spices. Oh yeah! I used 3 cups of chicken broth instead of the water and chicken bouillon cubes. I also added about a pound of chicken breast tenderloins that I cubed to 1 inch pieces. I put these in with the onions to get them started. Delicious! Sprinkle with some Parmesan cheese when serving. Pairs great with some beer bread.

Made it with 4 cups of chicken stock, butter, and half the cream cheese (1 8oz package) and it came out delicious! Not sure if 16 ounces of cream cheese would make the soup too rich. Definitely going into our autumn/winter meal heavy rotation. 


Also, made it in my Instant Pot - put the squash in whole for 8 minutes which made peeling it a breeze, then put everything but the cream cheese in for another 8 minutes. Came out perfect.

I made this soup.  I roasted the squash like others recommended.  I also added 4 cloves of garlic, a tablespoon of fresh chopped ginger, a jar of sundried tomatoes, and a quarter cup of toasted pine nuts.  I used chili powder and smoked paprika instead of cayenne pepper.  After ladling the soup into my bowl I topped it with a few shakes of Tabasco.

I never made a butternut squash soup before it was never been a soup that anyone in my family prefers.  I saw this recipe and decided to try it and omg I'm so happy I did.  This soup was amazing everyone in the family including children just could not get enough of it.  Will make it again and again.

I added abs took away some ingredients. Added 3 cups spinach. Added Granny Smith apple peeked and chopped. Nutmeg. Didn’t use cream cheese. Added lots of garlic about 6 cloves. Primarily thinking of winter colds. Puréed and froze in containers for those nights I don’t feel like cooking.

I love this soup!  I use a chicken flavored chicken base instead of bouillon.  My son is a chef and said no chef uses bouillon.  I have added sausage and toasted sunflower seeds (at time of eating)!

INCREDIBLE!
Yes; I made a few changes per some suggestions from other reviews. I cut the squash in half length-wise, brushed on some olive oil, then roasted face-down in the oven at 375 for 45 minutes. I think this will really bring out the flavor. I also added minced garlic to the onion, and used a minimal amount of cream cheese.  This recipe is amazing and I will certainly make this over and over.

I made this as per recipe, however cut the cream cheese to half and increased the red pepper to 1/4 teaspoon.  Delicious!

I doubled the recipe, but used only 12 oz. of neufchatel cream cheese and it was perfect. I also sprinkled in a tiny bit more cayenne. The whole family loved it. Husband said it was the best soup I've ever made.

Delicious & super easy. I roasted the squash first in olive oil, salt & pepper for about 20 min. I think that gave it a deeper flavor. I used half the cream cheese and I still found it super creamy. If I make it again I will actually use more squash (I had about 2 cups leftover from 1 big squash) - it was really rich (which was good) but it could be squashier & still taste fantastic. I think this is one you can definitely play with the amounts to find your perfect squash to creamy ratio.

I roasted two squash with a head of garlic in the oven for 70 minutes after tossing with avocado oil, salt and pepper. I used my Vitamix to purée in small batches the squash along with onions that I sautéd in butter, cooked bacon, and chicken bone broth. I dumped the puréed soup into a pot. For a spicy kick, I roasted two large seeded jalapeños and purées those with some heavy cream and added that to the squash mixture. This was fantastic and really hit the spot for a warm, rich meal on a blustery cold fall day. We made some homemade sourdough bread too that we used to dip in the soup.

Roasted the squash w/ EVOO, S&P & garlic on 350 for 30 (it was already peeled & cut up).  Added 1 qt chicken stock, stuck w/ the spices from the recipe.  Added 4oz cream cheese (instead of 16oz) & blitzed.  Delicious!

I typically don't leave reviews but I absolutely loved this recipe. At first it turned out very thick like baby food consistency, added a cup more broth and perfect. The cayenne pepper gives it a nice little kick (I put a bit more than recommended and it was great!). I had an abundance of butternut squash and no idea what to do with it. After cutting into chunks and freezing on a sheet pan, I now have zip locks full of pre cut squash I can use to make this soup all winter!

My husband loved  it, but I  only used  1 8 0z. Cream cheese.  I I think it would have been too much. With the other one. It was really easy too  do. I would make it again.

This was honestly just okay. Way too much cream cheese. I would only use 1 block of cream cheese and even that might be too much. I won't be making it again and I'm really disappointed by it. I wanted a good butternut squash recipe for this week and this is leaving me feeling very disappointed.

This soup turned out pretty good actually. Of course I made it a little different from the recipe after reading other reviews. I brought the precut squash at Walmart to save some time and boiled the chunks in 4 cans of chicken broth. I dumped all the seasonings the recipe called for (I only had Marjoram flakes) plus, 1tsp garlic, 1 T curry powder. I uses a shallot rather than onion since that’s what I had on hand. I used only 1 8oz cream cheese and added 1 c unsweetened coconut milk, 1/2 c half n half. I emulsified the squash but did leave small chunks since my hubby needs texture. I will make this again.

So I have never made this soup before. Never even heard of it before. I was asked to make it for a Sunday dinner. I did double the recipe only because of the amount of people I was feeding. But I followed it to a t. This was such a hit! I will be making this again.

I made a soup based off this recipe. But I used butter instead of margarine, because it's butter. I also added a couple granny Smith apples. it gives for a slightly sweeter flavor and a little tartness to the soup. I left the skin on the apples because I love the texture it gives in there, but if you don't want pieces of skin in your soup just skin them first.

I thoroughly enjoyed this, but as others did, I added my own twist. Instead of all the water I added a can of coconut milk, also cooked a whole bulb of garlic and added it as well, garnished it with green onion. Very good! A keeper

My first Butternut Squash soup and I love it.  As recommended I made two changes; roasted the squash and used only 8 oz of cream cheese.  YUM!

Absolutely delicious! My husband not only licked his bowl clean, he made sure the leftovers were put in the fridge and then he licked the pot clean! I did roast the squash and I only used one block of cream cheese. I was prepared to use two and I think how much you use depends on how much squash you have. Mine started out at 3 pounds. Also, I didn't have marjoram so I subbed oregano since marjoram is in the oregano family. Will definitely make again and again!

I made this for my daughter-in-law after she had 3 wisdom teeth pulled and couldn't chew. She loved it! Made her painful day brighter.  I didn't change anything except a cut it down because my squash was small. Thanks so much!

Made it according to the recipe and it’s quite good.  It’s a bit rich for me so I made again with half the cream cheese and a bit more cayenne.  I liked that better.   The cream cheese is a great  ingredient to make this smooth and rich.  Never would have thought of using it.

Delicious! I added 1 cup of sweet potato as I only had 5 cups squash. I also roasted them in oven first. Only used 1 block cream cheese and doubled cayenne.

I made it many many times and everyone loves it! I use only 1 chicken bouillon, 1 pack of cream cheese to make it less rich and salty. Also, sometimes I had some potatoes with the butternut squash. Delicious!!!

I roasted the butternut squash because I think it has a better flavor.  In addition, I used my homemade chicken broth, it just doesn’t compare to bouillon cubes.  I loosely followed the recipe, trying to get as close to the amounts as possible.  I followed other reviewers’ advice and cut the cream cheese in half, just to reduce the calories.  It was a wonderful meal on a cold winter’s day.

The squash came to 8 cups, so I added 4 cups chicken broth, then followed SLJ6’s recommendations and added 1 Apple, 1 cup Apple cider, nutmeg, 2x the cayenne and 1 cream cheese. Next time, I would cut the cream cheese to 1/2 of a package and drop the cayenne back down. Delicious!

I used low sodium chicken stock instead of water and bouillon and only used one block of low fat cream cheese.  It was beautiful, creamy and absolutely delicious.  I will be making it again.

I’ve made this soup a million times and it’s delicious. The best I’ve ever had. I just wish they’d explain how to prepare the squash, which I microwave first for 5 minutes at 1 minute intervals, then peel with a vegetable peeler, then cube with a very sharp knife, then roast at 350 for 20 minutes. It’s a chore, but it’s worth it.

This was the first soup I've ever made because I'm not a big soup person. Bad winter weather and limited stuff in the fridge...except squash, I decided to give it a try. The recipe was easy to follow and was absolutely delicious! Perhaps I may have to rethink soup again. Nevertheless, you won't be disappointed with this soup!!

We stirred in Greek yogurt instead of cream cheese. Goodness! It was the consistency of mashed potatoes once it cooled. Sooooo delicious on a cold day.

This was a super hit!!  I purchased squash already cut up and put it into my soup pot with chicken broth rather than water.  Didn't have cayenne pepper so added a sprinkle of chili powder.  Used my immersion blender to blend it all.  Served it to my guests plus my granddaughters and family.  Love, love, love and SO easy!!

Good but I thought the cream cheese made the soup feel too heavy.  I prefer using a little heavy cream or half and half.

Have made this soup several times and typically double the recipe when I make it.  We like a bit more heat so I increase the amt. of cayenne pepper.  I don’t use bullion cubes, but instead use the “better than bullion” product. Offers a richer chicken stock flavor in my opinion. I don’t understand why folks think it’s so hard to peel and cube the squash. I use a regular potato peeler - easy peasy.

Fantastic. I used two cans of coconut milk instead of the cream cheese and added some Indian spices to give it a slight kick and a hint of oriental flavor

Added 1 cub of chopped celery for every 3 cups of squash. Omitted cream cheese because it was creamy and why add more calories to a perfectly fine soup.

Followed directions as instructed EXCEPT only 8 oz of cream cheese.  It was plenty.  It's a keeper.

Baked squash abt 30 min at 375. Returned to pot to get softened and pick up flavors. I did use a little more cayenne pepper. Also toasted seeds to sprinkle on top.

I used an organic squash, and added a little bit of Tumeric. The color was slightly paler than the picture, but it tasted fantastic.  I ended up baking a squash for an hour, letting it cool, peeled the skin and put chunks into a large pot, then added all ingredients in the pot, and used a hand blender to blend it all, right in the pot as I heated it!  Easy!

Good recipe, but missing something.  I tried a version with a cup of cider replacing some water, and I added tarragon, but it left my tastebuds searching.  That’s said, it’s butternut soup... yum.

if a huge helping of fat and sodium is what it takes for you to eat a serving of vegetables, then this might be the recipes for you. although this really should be called cream cheese soup. there is entirely too much in this recipe and it overpowers the squash. if you read the positive reviews you'll notice that they mostly altered the recipe. I'm moving on to a lighter versioned recipe.

The best cold weather soup in the history of soups!!  I cut the cream cheese by half, but it was still super creamy and had a wonderful “stick to your ribs” kind of mouth feel.  And the cayenne has a back end kick that makes it linger.

was great.  did as others suggested by putting it in the oven for about an hour. Though i still feel like next time ill purchase them already cut. worth the extra money for me. after i cubed them i used some of the onions and chopped 4 garlic cloves ( made  recipe servings  for 18) and mixed it together with the squash with some EVOO and put it back in oven for 10 min. i then transferred to pot and only added in 2 medium sweet potatoes and an apple. The potatoes  gave it a bit of a creamy texture . I used absolutely ZERO dairy. No cream cheese, no cream, no nothing.  It was amazing! try it without the dairy. YUM!

The hardest part of this soup is peeling the squash.  I used one package of cream cheese and it was delicious!  I'm glad I didn't have a second package-I would have used it and it would have been much too rich.

The soup is fabulous.  I used chicken broth.  Before blending with my hand immersion blender I chopped a small peeled apple, plus one chunk of cream cheese. It is fabulous.  This is the only recipe I will use for butternut squash.  It was thick, creamy, just perfect.

I followed the recipe exactly except that I cut the cheese to just one 8 ounce block. It was plenty creamy and very delicious. It has the right amount of sweetness and kick from the cayenne pepper. Delish!

I did tweak this totally, while I sincerely appreciate the recipe . I baked 2 Butternut Squash drizzled with EVOO and seasoned with black pepper 350* 1hourish! Sautéed 1/2 medium onion in 2tlb butter, added the squash with 32 oz chicken stock 1 8oz cream cheese, cayenne pepper, black pepper and Marjoram all 2+ Tlbs . Puréed with my emulsion Blender.. very good and many compliments

I loved this recipe!  I did not puree it as I like my soups less smooth.  I mashed it well with a potato masher.

I gave this a neutral rating. I didn't realize how sweet butternut squash was before I made this. I guess I'd only had it with apples and cranberries (where it was supposed to be sweet) before. No one in my family could eat this.

This is so delicious I added 1/2 cup of sour cream after it was cooked which made it extra creamy.  I roasted the squash in the oven before adding it to the other ingredients it gave it more flavor

I made it minus the cream cheese, and added just a smidge of half and half to lessen the calories - still delicious!  I also roasted the squash instead of cooking it in the broth.  Adding the cayenne was delicious - give it just a little kick on top of the sweetness of the squash.   I also added sage, cinnamon, & nutmeg as well.  Ok, so I didn't really make this recipe, but it gave me the right amount of chicken broth and the cayenne idea - so I give it 5 stars.  :)  Thanks!

Terrific recipe. Used half the amount of cream cheese and didn’t use “marjoram” but oregano. Either way, the bouillon really helps herb things up. Excellent consistency with these small changes I made. Highly recommended for those cold months! Bon apetite!

This was delicious!!! I made it a bit easier though by baking a large while squash first in the oven at 375 for about 75 minutes. Then when it cooled slightly, I cut it open, took out the seeds, and then scooped out the squash. I then added 6 cups of the cooked squash with the cream cheese and blended with a mixer. After that, I added it to the onion,  butter mixture and stirred in the rest the ingredients. Super easy and super yummy!!

Served it with smoked sour cream. It was pretty thin, but i think that was my fault for overblending it. Still had a great flavor!

Love this recipe! I halved all the ingredients and it still turned out lovely. I do wish I followed the advice of the other bakers on here and halved the amount of cream cheese. It’s not overwhelming, though, and if you like creamy soup you should keep the provided proportions! Otherwise, less cream cheese would give it more squash flavor.

Very good. I  saute the onion and put it in the slow cooker with the squash and spices on low until the squash is tender.   Then mash with only one 8 oz  package of cream cheese. And the 1 cup of broth,  more if needed.

I’ve made this soup recipe several times.  The first time I made it, I followed the recipe to a T.  It’s good as is but after adding a few other ingredients it takes it over the top.  I like to add a sweet potato to it sometimes if the squash is more yellow than orange..it’s a visual thing more than anything else.  I add a little poultry seasoning or thyme, a few shakes of Worcestershire, couple shakes fish sauce (I know it sounds gross but you can’t taste fish unless you overdo it), and a few shakes of nutmeg.  I actually put this additional concoction in many of my stews and chowders and it never disappoints.  Just start really small and adjust to taste (after you’ve blended the original recipe so you can get an accurate idea of what the complete package tastes like and gauge it from there).  It creates an added umami profile you never knew you needed until you try it.  This soup is so good my daughter asks for it as part of her birthday dinner every year.  Also..throw a few bacon bits or pancetta on top and it becomes the pinnacle of greatness..because ya know..it’s bacon.

I increased the broth to 4 c, reduced the cream cheese to 4 oz, and increased the squash to about 4 c. (I used three 10 oz bags of frozen butternut squash). Turned out delicious and very creamy! There’s really no reason to use 16 oz of cream cheese unless you want to be fat.

This soup has nice flavor but rated it lower because the recipe calls for too.much cream cheese. Use 1 block only, or even 1/2 block to avoid overpowering the squash flavor.  Used cubed squash and a hand held immersion mixer. Very easy. added a but more cayenne pepper.

Actually, this was my first time making butternut squash soup and I followed some of the suggestions from previous reviews. I added the apple and apple cider vinegar and it turned out fantastic with that special spikiness that I love!

I love this soup! I frequently add extra apples, which are cooked and puréed with the butternut squash. Pears are good addition too. Just delicious!

This soup was amazing! You could definitely use less cream cheese to make it a little healthier, but this will definitely be on rotation at our house!

Quick & easy:  I sautéed everything in a pot while squash was in oven roasting.  When cooled, I put cooked squash pieces in the pot and mashed with a potato masher.  Then added cream cheese and again mashed with potato masher.   Done! One pot soup, easy clean up!

I just made a few changes - used 3 cups of bone broth instead of bouillon and water.  2 packages cream cheese seemed like a lot so I only used 1 and it was just right. The soup was very tasty with a good amount of seasoning and lots of flavor!

Really tasty soup, for an extra kick I double the cayenne. For a richer flavor I use bone broth instead of water and butter instead of margarine as well.

I'll tell you what is missing from this recipe to give it ALL STARS... as I have been making it for over 21 years when it was published in a Kraft recipe booklet (for the cream cheese that is used).   To take this recipe over the top as originally written you puree roasted red pepper in a food processor and dollop it onto the finished soup.  Using a toothpick you can swizzle and make elegant designs with the pepper and then add chopped basil.  I also love adding thyme while the squash is simmering.  Taste as you go along.  This has been my winter Squash soup for over 20 years and you can tweak it to your liking.....but honestly, garnishing this with the pureed roasted red pepper and  chopped basil as originally written by Kraft truly makes this  eye candy, and a WOW for your friends and family

This recipe has been adopted as a family favorite in our house. My only variation is to halve the cream cheese. Creamy, sweet, and a little spicy, it is fall-time perfection!

Thought it was delicious and easy to make!
My modifications:
I quartered the squash and microwaved face down for 8 minutes before peeling.
Thought it was too salty with 4 cubes, so added only 3 (same amount of water).
Added 1 T fresh minced garlic to onions.
Omitted the marjoram (only bc I didn't have it).
Used 4 oz of cream cheese.
Still creamy, smooth and amazing!!!

The soup was so good and my family loved it! I only used half the amount of cream cheese and I still thought it was too heavy. Next time I’m just going to use quarter the amount.

I did not puree all of the ingredients, I saved some of the cooked ingredients for a little texture.  I added the cream cheese at the end until it was melted in. LOVED this soup, base and have added or deleted new ingredients or spices that I love.  Make it your own be adventuresome.

Delish..along with roasting the squash, I also roasted an onion and a few garlic cloves blended all together with half a block of nuefchatel cheese and it was AMAZING! Always have to roast the veggies!!

This is my go-to butternut squash soup!  Sometimes I use sour cream instead of cream cheese and it's just as good but with fewer calories.  I've also served with pumpkin seeds which gave it a wonderful crunchy texture.  Lately I've only been blending just a few scoops of the squash so there are still delightful chunks of squash left to chew on.  I've also made it with a potato added it and that was a nice addition.

I love this soup! I've made it many many times without altering a thing. It's creamy and flavorful. I'd suggest following the recipe as written before following the changes made by other reviewers. You'll find the changes to be unnecessary. Also, peeling a butternut squash isn't hard with a good vegetable peeler. Hope you give it a try :)

This was easy and delicious. The cayenne added a nice warmth to it.  I used dried sage instead of marjoram and used half the cream cheese. I will definitely make this again.

Pretty good! A little mild in taste, but with a nice little kick! I roasted the squash since I had extra time on my hands. I only came up with 4 cups but it worked out fine.  I thought that much cream cheese was far too much. I only added 1/4 of one package (2oz) and that was perfect! More than that would have been too rich and would have drowned out the other flavors. I used the leftover cream cheese to make the "Cucumber Sandwiches III" on this site. Made for a great lunch!

Want five stars?   ADD A POUND OF FRIED ITALIAN SAUSAGE.  DO IT.  So good!   Also, use real butter, real chicken stock, and half as much cream cheese.  AND DO NOT OMIT THE CAYENNE PEPPER!!!!

Definitely a great recipe! The only thing I would do next time is only use one package of cream cheese instead of two. It kind of overpowered the taste of the squash.

I make this every fall.  As soon as the weather turns cold, the kids (now teens) start asking for it.  It helps a lot that Costco sells the squash peeled and cubed, ready to use!  The only change I make is to use the organic bouillon paste instead of the little dry cubes.  And sometimes, my husband sneaks in a bit more cayenne.  I've given this recipe to so many people.  Just love it!

Really creamy and tasteful! Maybe I would drop one of the chicken bouillon and only use 3 as I found it gave almost "too much" flavour :-)

Found the secret missing ingredient!! More on that below. This was delicious and easy! :) I followed the recommendation of many other reviewers and baked the squash first (halved and put face-down on a cookie sheet, 375 for 50 minutes), cut up an onion, and used 5 c. chicken broth instead of bouillon and water. Cut the cream cheese in half to one block.

GINGER! I added the spices as it called for, which was yummy, but a teaspoon of ginger added such a rich, delicious fullness to it that totally complemented the other flavors already present. I added a dollop of sour cream once it was in my bowl. Sooooo good! I will make this again and again.

I follow this recipe pretty much exactly (other than roasting my squash before hand so I don't have to peel and chop it when it's hard). It is a HUGE family favourite and a big treat when I make it. I did try it recently with just 1 package of cream cheese and my husband and I couldn't tell the difference.

Made this dairy-free using room temperature coconut butter (not coconut oil, but the butter made from the whole coconut flesh), and tahini at a 4:1 oz ratio. It turned out amazing!! And because the coconut butter was room temp, the soup didn't require reheating after pureeing it. I just stirred it thoroughly in the still warm sauce pan. Delish and simple recipe!

This is my daughter's favourite soup. She takes it to school for lunch throughout the fall and winter months. I replace the water and chicken boullion with vegetable broth. I also roast the squash in the oven first. (Cut in half,  vegetable side down in about a 1/2 inch of water at about 375 degrees for 40 mins)  With 20 mins left in roasting the squash, I put in 2 peeled, cored and quartered MacIntosh apples. Once the squash is roasted (fork should easily pierce the skin), I remove the skins and throw the squash along with the apples in the pot with the rest of the simmering soup base. At the very end I use the hand blender to smooth out the lumps. This is so delicious. I have served it as an appetizer for Christmas dinner as well. As a helpful hint - I once bought frozen cubed squash thinking I was saving time. DO NOT do this, it really lacked flavour. It was the only time my daughter did not finish the batch. There is a wonderful taste that comes from the roasted squash.

Meh. Made this as written, and didn't really care for it, even after adding more spices. It was just too bland and meh. Husband also said "soup is all right," which is pretty accurate. It wasn't bad, just not terribly good, either.

This was a very good soup!!!!  I was impressed at how good it really was! I never had butternut squash before and had roasted it the first time I made it.  I enjoyed it but it was somewhat sweet.  So, when I found this recipe I thought it would come out too sweet but it did not.  This soup is lick the spoon awesome!  Only thing I tweaked was I used chicken stock instead of bouillon. Will definitely make again!

Insanely good. We love it as a side for sausage, and we crumble up some Ritz for that crouton crunch.  2 bricks of cream cheese really is insane, though. I used 3/4 of one and it was perfect for us.

The was excellent!  Because I am trying to eat  healthier, I used only one fourth of the cream cheese and it was still very tasty.  I always cut my butternut squash in half and wrap with foil and bake until soft.

This soup is easy and delicious. I did roast the butternut squash in the oven first, which tastes great. The only ingredient change I made was to reduce the cream cheese. I made it once before with two blocks of cream cheese and it was WAY to rich and creamy. I couldn't taste the squash. So, I quartered the amount of cream cheese this time (using only 4 oz or half of a block). It is perfect this way!

It is a winner I used coconut oil to cook the onion ( I aded a clove a garlic)  and coconut milk to thin a bit.  Roasted squash, chicken broth, and seasoning; could it be easier?  I tried cream cheese as a topping and also sour cream it didn't need either. Tasty.

I roasted my squash cause it's way too much trouble to cut.  My family liked it, but it didn't quite make the favorite category - probably because nobody is a butternut squash fan.

I have been using this recipe for years and it always pleases.  I try to eat healthy so I only use 1/4 the cream cheese which i think is plenty! I also use butter instead of margarine.

Made this as directed. Minus one small adjustment. Used only one package of cream cheese.  Made it like 5 times since 1st part of November.  Yummy!

Way too much cream cheese! I cut the cream cheese in half and it was still too rich for me. I could barely taste the squash anymore.

I find it frustrating that so many reviews omitted the cream cheese but then give five stars. It's not really reviewing the original recipe anymore, as the cream cheese changes it so greatly.

I really like this recipe. I make it on those cold, midwest, winter nights to warm us up from the inside out. It fills you up rather well, which most soups don't do. My husband appreciates that, as then he's not hungry for food again in 15 minutes.

I loved it.  I used chicken broth instead of boullion.  I warmed it up and it was even better.  In fact, I had my third day of soup for lunch COLD.  I was surprised how much I enjoyed it COLD, TOO!   I will make this one again.

This soup is so yummy.  I changed a couple of things. I used one whole squash and only used 1 package of cream  cheese and felt that made it plenty rich.  I also added an extra cup of water since I used the entire squash.

Our catering company at work makes the best butternut squash soup, but this one is right there with it.  It was super (souper) tasty.  The only thing I added was a dash of cinnamon.

This is one of the best soups I have ever made; DELICIOUS!  I cooked a med sized squash in the crock pot, and peeled it.  I cooked 1/4 of a  onion chopped and 2 chopped celery stocks in 1 T butter. I added 1 diced clove garlic at the end and then  I added 2 C water and 2 t chicken base, a couple of pinches  of cayenne, and of black pepper and added squash.  Boil for a short time, and then blend with immersion blender.  I then stirred in 4 oz of cream cheese, cooked until melted, and then used immersion blender again.  Really AMAZING!!  MY husband loved it and he does not like squash!

Made the recipe with half the cream cheese but next time I will eliminate it completely. It gave the soup an odd flavor and soup is creamy enough without it.

I used 1/3 amount of cream cheese and added some almond milk instead. This made it a bit more watery than probably intended but was necessary to bring down some of the heat of the pepper and cayenne that was probably relying on the extra cream cheese to neutralize it. Delicious!

This soup was scrumptious and hit the spot on our first snow day! Might try less cream cheese next time only because it was really rich and I'm slightly lactose intolerant.  So good though!

I followed the recipe exactly. I love butternut squash soup very much, but not sure I'll make this version again. If I do I will follow advice of others and maybe try using just one package of cream cheese. We found this made a lot of soup, so great for a crowd!

Like many others, I roasted my butternut squash first.  I only used 1 block of cream cheese....which I think is enough.  flowed the recipe exactly, and I added freshly grated ginger -- because I love fresh ginger in butternut squash soup.  This is the first time I've made

Love the flavor and I add a little more cayenne pepper.  I also use my slow cooker, on high two hours and on low 4 hours.  Be sure and sauté those onions in butter on the stove if you’re using your slow cooker, don’t just add it to the crock pot, the flavor won’t be same.  Delicious and I’ve made this for family and friends many, many times!  Always a winner!

This is super good. I did up the cayenne pepper a bit and added some nutmeg and cinnamon. And as recommended by others only used half the cream cheese. I also tried to just use the hand mixer to blend it, it was too clumpy or grainy so I did put it in the blender for about 5 minutes.  My husband loved it!!

I did not find this to have enough squash flavor. Next time I will follow some of the other reviews, more spices, less cream cheese, and maybe add an apple. Too much cream cheese for my taste.

Wonderful.  A few changes:  Used one butternut and one acorn squash.   Poked cloves in squash ...Halved and baked in oven for an hour..

Added 3 apples to onions...Lots of grated nutmeg.

Make some homemade croutons and add pepper flakes to croutons!!!

Soup is delicious.  I used onion  powder instead of onions because I have a friend who is allergic to raw ones.   Also, I roasted the squash in the oven with olive oil and salt and pepper.   I used chicken broth (two kinds---Better Than Boullion and Watkins).  I also added about 6 cups of water.   I only used one  8-oz. package of cream cheese, and I did not purée the mixture, I mashed the squash and stirred in the cream cheese.    Very yummy on a cold winter day!

So delicious! I added chicken stock instead of water and put in only one bouillon cube. I did not have marjoram so I left it out. I used half of a brick of cream cheese and the result was still creamy and dreamy. Yum!

Love this soup. Amazing flavor a true comfort soup. Served it before main course at Thanksgiving they really loved it. The only thing I  did different was I also added paprika and a dash of lemon pepper. Doubled the batch and canned 5 jars.

The family loved it ! I added a dollop of sour cream and swirled it before serving. Then I garnished it with a pinch of paprika.

This soup is fabulous!!! It gets rave reviews every time I have served it.  I only made 2 small changes.  I only added 1 8-oz. package cream cheese and I added a scant teaspoonful of Turmeric.

pretty simple, but this recipe calls for ALOT of cream cheese.. in the end, the soup came out less sweet than expected, couldn't really taste the full flavor of the squash. Will make it again, but try a different recipe.

I've made this several times and really love the cayenne pepper. I now cut the cream cheese in half and use 8 oz, not 16. Healthier and I can't tell the difference.

This soup was a great hit with my family! It was so tasty! My recommendation would be to forgo the bouillon cubes & water and go with the chicken broth instead.

This soup is delicious!! My family loved it so I will definitely be making it again as the weather gets colder. I only used 1 package of cream cheese as other people had mentioned on their review and it was just enough to give the right amount of cream cheese flavor.

I used both packages of cream cheese as in the recipe and it was way too much in my opinion. Next time I make this, I am going to just use one package of cream cheese. To  keep the consistency the same, I'm going to reduce the amount of broth that I use.

This is one of my favorite Fall recipes, but I do tweak it quite a bit. First, I roast the squash. I also add a chopped, peeled apple or two and cut the cream cheese quantity in half. I use vegetable broth instead of water. 
My son made this recently and followed the recipe precisely, and we all agreed that it was much, much too rich (too much cream cheese) and not "squashy" enough.

I'm a vegetarian, so I used vegetable bouillon, plus I doubled the cayenne.  Other than those changes, I followed the recipe as it read.  Even the picky eater in the house liked it!  We're planning on having it for Thanksgiving.

Delicious!  I microwaved the butternut squash first to make it easier to cut, added a potato, and only use a bit of the cream cheese (and froze without the cream cheese as another reviewer suggested).  I didn't have marjoram, so used oregano.  And used homemade broth instead of water & bouillon!  Delish!

Loved this soup! I roasted the squash with some olive oil and minced garlic first, then blended it together with the rest of the ingredients. I opted out of the cream cheese and instead substituted 2 cups water and 1 cup half & half instead of 3 cups water. I added a chipotle pepper and a bit more Cayenne pepper. It had a little extra kick and a smokey flavor! My husband isn't a huge squash fan- but he loved this soup!

I followed the recipe essentially as written. I did start the squash in the oven to roast for 45 min but then ended up cutting it up and cooking it in my Instant Pot. It did help giving it a start in the oven. While it was hot to touch, it made peeling it easier. Next time I will cook it in the Instant Pot entirely and then make it into soup.

But I digress... following the recipe as written except for only adding one brick of cream cheese instead of two. I also added some apple cider, based upon a previous reviewer's suggestion. This made it good but it seemed bland. I ended up adding some powdered ginger and then some french seasoning from Penzey's. That took it to a new level, can't wait to have it for lunch tomorrow! Thanks for the recipe!

I can't stop eating this!!!! I did change the spices to fresh basil and rosemary  because they are my favorite and I added a dash of cumin because that's what I had in the house and now I can't stop eating it! AND.... I forgot to remove the calories so I'm in trouble now :)

I loved this soup!  Even my boyfriend that doesn't like butternut squash soup liked this one.  I did use chicken stock instead of the water and chicken boulion.  I will be making this recipe many times.  Thank you for sharing.

I added a carrot, chopped, and 1 stalk of celery, sliced with the onions when I sauteed them after seeing another butternut soup recipe.  I also used only 1 pkg of cream cheese as someone else had suggested.  It was very creamy with that one and I think would have been too rich with 2 pkgs.    I also roasted the squash pieces with some smashed garlic cloves as another person suggested.  Then everything went into the crock pot and simmered for about 3 hours.  Delicious!  I will definitely make this again.

WOW!  This was delicious!  The only change I made was I cut the squash in half (lengthwise) and placed each half cut side down on a buttered cookie sheet and then baked it for 40 min in the oven at 375 degrees.  This really brought out the flavor and made it simple to scoop away from the skin.  I then followed the receipe as instructed.  Also I only used 1/2 the suggested cream cheese - for my family that was perfect. Yum!

It was really yummy and had great flavor. It was way too think with 16 total ounces of the cream cheese. Next time I make this I am going to only add 8 ounces. With how thick it is, it makes a great chip dip!

Flavor is excellent...I would thin I out a bit more since I was very thick.  Has anyone froze the leftovers and reheated successfully? Two packages of cream cheese is a lot of dairy and wasn't sure it would freeze well.

Okay, I'll admit I cheated by using the frozen cubed butternut squash. Very tasty with the spices but I think I may have been a little heavy handed with the red pepper but my hubby likes a bit of fire. I didn't have any regular cream cheese but some pumpkin flavored and used  about half the container as it looked really thick after using my handheld blender. Will definitely make again!

This was perfect to make on a cold rainy day. I sautéed the onions with about two tablespoons of butter. I roasted the squash and then brought all the ingredients (besides the cream cheese) to a boil then I just shut it off and let it sit for about 15 minutes. I blended the squash and one block of cream cheese in the blender.  Mixed it back in with the other liquid. I think two blocks of cream cheese would have been too much. It's a great fall recipe!

I made it as requested except I substituted 3 cups of Chicken broth for the water and bullion. We enjoyed it, but I think I would double the amount of squash next time. I think it's a choice between creamy and squashy. I think adding some more squash would be a good balance. P.S. I took someone's suggestion and roasted it in the oven for 45 minutes at 375. It scooped out so easily.

Made it as is but went a little lighter on the cream cheese but not much. A bit heavier on the ceyenne. I roast the squash covered after peeling and dicing. Also add salt salt to taste.  There's another recipe I've done with apple but I do like this one as is for something different. I sprinkle fresh parmesean on top and also use homemade broth.

This is the best soup I've ever had. I roasted my squash, only used 1/2 the cream cheese, added 1 peeled and chopped apple, and added about 1/2 cup of half and half in the end. Wow! I couldn't stop eating it! The family loved it too. I'll definitely be adding this recipe to my Thanksgiving spread this year.

this soup was delicious!  I did double the marjoram and added a tbsp of Jamaican curry powder. I also cut the cream cheese by half and used reduced fat version.  Definitely a make again recipe.

For my taste it was far too creamy, and the cream cheese took away too much of the squash flavor. The recipe's author does mention, though, cutting down the cream cheese if it's too rich. And I took her alternative suggestion and used chicken broth instead of bullion and water.

Made this for a work lunch today. It was a fabulous hit! I followed the recipe as it said- 1 LG. squash, 4 c low sodium chicken broth (one container is 4 cups) and used butter and hot sauce instead of margarine and Cheyenne. I made it last night and was a little thick today, so I added 1 cup water to the bowl and rinsed the container/diluted. I only used 1 pkg cream cheese and it was still it was rich. Excellent! Will now be a staple on our menu!

This is a great but simple recipe!  My husband told me it tasted just like he remembered his mom's butternut squash soup tasting as he grew up.  I really didn't change anything, except that I prefer to bake it for about 45 minutes (@350, cut length-wise and placed cut side down in a baking dish with some water) first to make the peeling and cubing so much easier.  I will definitely make this more than once while the squash is in season!

The cream cheese makes this taste like a cheese soup, and reminds me of a broccoli and cheese soup. Which I'm personally not a fan of.

This was certainly a tasty (and a guilty) soup.  I don't know if it needed the whole pound of cream cheese, but it made it delicious.  When the weather gets cold and the days get shorter, this will lift your spirits for a bit!

My husband gave it 5 stars, I gave it 4.  I used one package of lower fat cream cheese.  I think two packages would have lost the flavor of the butternut squash.  It was rich and creamy with just the one pkg.  I also used 4 cups of chicken broth instead of the water and bouillon.  It was easier than trying to pick the pieces of wrapper off the bouillon that always sticks! :)

So good!  I roasted the squash, added apple, salt, and nutmeg per others' review.  Used only one block of cream cheese.  I wanted it a little more thick so I added a bit of cornstarch slurry.  Delicious!

I made this twice now and my family loves it. The first time, I made it just like the recipe which was still pretty good. The second time, I changed it up. I used chicken stock instead of bouillon. I used rosemary and parsley instead of marjoram and cayenne pepper but I kept the black pepper. I caramelized the onions which added to the sweetness of the butternut squash. I also added a little bit of maple smoked bacon to add more flavor to complement the squash. My family inhaled the second batch. I had no leftovers to put into the fridge.

This is the best butternut squash soup I've ever had.  A true taste of gourmet at home.  It's  creamy, velvety, comforting and all around yum!  Changes - used 3 cups of chicken stock instead of water.  Blended in our Ninja.

Ii took the suggestions of others by roasting squash, onions, garlic and an apple in oven for an hour (drizzled olive oil and seasoned with salt and pepper) sautéed the onions in butter, added roasted vegetables and added 4 c water with 4 heaping tsps of Epicures chicken bouillon, marjoram, 1/4 tsp cayenne, 1/4 tsp nutmeg. Heat until warm and purée small portions in blender, return to pot and heat to serving temperature. I did not use any of the cream cheese...it was amazing without the extra fat.

Weeknight suggestion: If you put the whole squash wrapped in tinfoil in the slow cooker then the only thing you need to do when you get home from work is wait for it to cool, purée the ingredients and reheat. So quick and yummy!

It was really very easy to make and quite tasty. I followed suggestions from a lot of the other reviewers by roasting the squash ahead of time to make it easier to cut and peel and shorten the cooking time. I only added 1 package of cream cheese, used chicken stock instead of water, and added a little red curry powder.  The results were fantastic, my husband who doesn't like squash or curry really liked it! I will for sure make this again to use up garden squash.

I accidentally planted butternut squash instead of summer squash. So I had 10 squash to use :). Made a double batch of this soup and I'm glad I did. It is soo good. Will make again.

I have to say I was a bit intimidated as I have never tried butternut squash!  
I did use the broth instead of water. 

This recipe was easy to follow and a hit with my family!!  I'll definitely be making ahead and freezing for the winter!!

I only cut back in the cream cheese by 1 pkg and it was by far one of the best we've had. I liked the plain simpleness of the flavor.

Replace the water with vegetable broth. Great soup to start the holiday meal.
Place squash in the microwave for a minute and it will be easier to cut.

I don't alter it a whole lot like so many other people did. It's a great soup with only half of the cream cheese as she stated though. Tips for moms of picky eaters: I will often prepare this under the guise of it being fondue and have veggies and crusty bread to dip in it and they eat it! Not real fondue, of course, but they don't know.

The only thing I did that was a "cheat" is I bought pre-cubed squash.  Otherwise I made it just as the recipe called for and everyone loved it!  I also made this around the Holidays and I added a dash of ground clove and a dash of ground cinnamon.

I toss it in a regular oven for an hour until fork tender. Peel comes right off and it's easy to cut- and then your soup is done lickety-split too. 

Like others I've kinda combined other recipes in to this one. I sautée carrot celery and onion, add (homemade but  I've used low sodium broth too) chicken stock, sweet potato or pumpkin purée (I had neither on hand this time so I baked a sweet potato along with the squash- also unpeeled and voila!). I add a few globs of cream cheese, applesauce, honey, cinnamon and for a little kick since I can't do curry I add ginger. Salt and pepper to taste. I add roasted veggies to sautéed veggies in the stock pot, simmer a bit and use my immersion blender.

This was my 1st time ever making butternut squah soup so I was alittle nervous. Followed this recipe exactly and I must say it was easy and extremely delish.  Best part was was my 2 year old and 7 year old eating in all up without asking what it is. Loved it!!

Very easy and delicious recipe! I usually love cream cheese but this recipe does call for a lot. I halved the amount as suggested and it was plenty. I also used reduced sodium chicken broth. I love spice but this was a bit too spicy for my 9 and 5 year old. So I'll probably cut the amount of cayenne next time. Added Crema Mexicana as a garnish which went very well with this soup. 
I was also able to add the entire mixture to the blender at once with no issues.
I think grilled ham and cheese would go great with this soup!

This is one of my "healthy" eats when I'm trying to lose weight. Why? Because this is soooo good even if you leave the cream cheese out. To dress it up for friends, I also add some diced carrots to give it a bit of texture without extra calories.

Used puréed acorn squash that I need to use up and homemade chicken stock (Chef John's recipe from this site).  The soup was so delicious that I could have drunk it with a straw.  It is great leftover and reheated as well.

This is good, but not a show stopper so only four stars. The squashy creaminess is a pleasant flavor. I doubled the cayenne pepper and didn't have marjoram so used a Tbls. of dried parsley. Only used one package of cream cheese and it seems plenty thick and rich.

I cut the cream cheese down to 6 ounces and added some heavy whipping cream(about 1/4 cup but I didn't measure) to make this the flavor texture I liked.  Used chicken broth instead of the chicken cubes and water. Also added cinnamon to sweeten it a bit, and for garnish when serving.  If you are not crazy about onions you can cut that back a bit too, but I used the six tablespoons called for.

Good as is . . . . . but try adding some grated cucumber near the end of cook time, and snipping some fresh dill on top.  It gives it a subtle fresh flavor.

This is my first time making butternut squash soup, but my first time having it was at Panera Bread. I didn't expect this recipe to turn out like theirs, and it didn't, but it was delicious nonetheless.

I bought pre cut squash cubes which I roasted in a 400 degree over with the onion and a little bit of carrot and celery.  I used a homemade very flavorful vegetable broth.   My husband loved it.  As much as I love roasted vegetables I will not roast the vegetables next time.  I may rate it higher when I actually follow the directions.

So darn yummy!  I didn't use oregano because I don't like it. I substituted it with Sage and parsley. I think next time I will only do half the cream cheese just to save on calories. I didn't use the blender, instead I used a blender stick. So much less fuss. Didn't have to do batches just did it right in the pot. This is totally worth the chopping and stirring!

I used home made chicken stock and used 4 oz of cream cheese instead of 8 and left out the onions and this was fantastic! My new favourite soup!

Great recipe, very rich and creamy. My husband loves the little kick the spices give it. To cook my butternut squash, I cut it in half lengthwise, turn the halves face-down in a glass baking dish, fill the dish with about an inch of water, and bake in the oven at 375 for about 40 minutes. After it cools a little, you can just scoop the butternut squash out.

First time so I made it as directed, likely will use less cream cheese and add red pepper flakes next time - maybe but 
Absolutely DELISH as is...!

I found that the amount of cream cheese was too much. I will try it again and cut it by 3/4. Honestly. It's so thick. I'll have to add chicken stock to loosen it up.

I didn't use all the cream cheese (about 3/4s) and used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth.... very good!  Garnished with some slices of  butternut squash roasted with salt, rosemary and tuscan infused olive oil.

Love this recipe. I've made it a few times now, first time I followed a reviewer's suggestion and added half the cream cheese but everything else the same. Turned out great. This last time I was not feeling like peeling and cubing the butternut squash, so I cut in half and roasted in the oven, until it was tender. I also had a head of cauliflower so I roasted that too, and when I mixed the cooked vegetables along with the other ingredients, I used an immersion blender. And, I left the cream cheese out to cut some calories. Still turned out delicious and the cauliflower addition made it a more "meatier" soup.

Used only 1 (8 0z.) package of cream cheese.  I really can't imagine using TWO as it was rich and thick with one package!  Will definitely make it again!  YUMM-O!

This recipe is very yummy, however I wish I would have taken other reviewers advice and reduce the cream cheese dramatically. 4oz should be enough. It was good but very very heavy.

Great soup for a cold winter day!  If you live near a Wegmans do yourself a favor and opt for their precut family size package of butternut squash which is 3lbs total.  I used almost the whole 3lbs and only one block of the cream cheese then added a little Lawry's seasoning salt at the end for some extra flavor.

I hate rating a recipe that I tweaked.  But I appreciated and followed the suggestions to bake the squash first and to cut the cream cheese in half.  Served this for my friends and they loved it.

I love this soup! I have made it five times and it was the star of two large parties.  I use the precut squash which is exactly the 6 cups required and is a huge time saver.  I use Better than Boullion. I like the soup without the cream cheese.  Instead I use a small spoonful of sour cream on each bowl.

This was quick and healthy comfort food. I used non fat plain Greek yogurt instead of cream cheese to lower fat content and boosting protein. Using real butter gave enough creaminess. Purreeing with an immersion blender made it super quick! Using frozen squash cubes made it even faster yet still tasty.

This was my first time trying a squash soup and I combined recipes.   I didn't use the cream cheese and I cooked the squash before cutting and peeling which makes the job much easier.  I added carrots with the onions and I used vegetable soup stock instead of water. I was skeptical of the cayenne, but it gave it a nice finishing touch.  I added some real cream and the texture was perfect.

OMG....this SO good! Rich and creamy. I followed the suggestion of others to roast the squash first. I also used 4 cups of chicken broth instead of bouillon and water. I used only 1 package of 1/3 less fat cream cheese and it was plenty. I also added a little garlic powder and sage to the other seasonings. This is super simple and tastes like restaurant quality. Thanks for the fantastic recipe. I will make this over and over again.

I may have thrown in more cayenne and I didn't measure the squash, but I made a half recipe bc I read that one squash is about 3 cups. I'll try other people's suggestions in the future. This was my fist time cooking butternut squash and I can honestly say I'll do it again! I gave it 4 stars because while I think it's delicious, in sure there is room for improvement.

I baked the cubed squash for almost an hour before I put it in the pan with the other ingredients. I used only one bar of cream cheese. I substituted chicken broth for the water and boullion. I believe it could have used four cups of broth instead of three. We really liked it. Nice enough to serve to guests.

This Christmas season I made it twice.  I don't have marjoram so I used nutmeg instead.  I also added a little jot of cinnamon.  Otherwise everything according to the recipe.  This soup gave me the "need" to purchase an immersion blender and I am surely glad I did!  The recipe is really delightful!

This was my first time cooking with butternut squash.  This was a good beginning.  I read many reviews before making it.  I roasted my squash in the oven, salted with olive oil.  I sauteed my onions in part butter and part coconut oil. Like many I only used one package of cream cheese.  I put in two 32 oz cartons of chicken broth.  Maybe that' why mine didn't come out too thick.  It probably could have been a little thicker.  So next time I'll use slightly less chicken broth, but definitely more than the 5 cups of broth that I was going to use per one reviewer's suggestion. I didn't have marjoram. So I used oregano and thyme as one reviewer did.  I used one-fourth teaspoon of cayenne instead of the one-eighth called for and it wasn't too spicy.  I will definitely make this again.

I am someone that has never tasted Butternut Squash Soup in my life. I tried this just as written ( but only used 2oz. of the Creamed Cheese ), and I liked it ! Super easy to make, smooth and rich. I will make it again and freeze for later this winter. 
Thank you for a Super Basic Recipe !!

This came out great the first time. The only deviation was that I used 1 pack of 8 oz cream cheese advised by other reviewers. My 7 year old even gave me a thumbs up!

Made on December 10/15 used 2 pkg. frozen squash thawed, roast for 20minutes with olive oil . Sauté onions and minced garlic, then add one sliced apple then ad squash, chicken broth (4cups) and spices including 2Tbsp. Brown sugar, 1 tsp nutmeg.  Simmer for 1 hour then drop 1pkg cream cheese to soften for few minutes, when tender cool abit then put in small batches into nutribullet. YUMMY!!!! Made again September 26/18,  soooo good! Next time only 1/8 cayenne pepper not 1/4 tsp. add two apples and roast squash longer 40 minutes on 350 or if using fresh cut into quarters drizzle with EVOO and roast at 375 for 45-60 minutes til tender and easy to scoop, 1-2 tsp minced garlic also try a little cinnamon and maybe cloves or allspice instead of cayenne

I made this recipe but with a few tweaks...I used half the cream cheese,another tablespoon of onion,and an extra half a tablespoon of butter (I can't believe it's not butter).I followed the seasoning to a tea but added bacon salt to the equation.ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!

This came out really delicious! I added 3/4 head of cauliflower, and only 3/4 of 1 block of cream cheese. Next time I would only use about 1/2 block, it was on the rich side for me.  (I feel like 2 whole blocks would make it inedible!) I took the advice of others and roasted the squash in the oven for 45 minutes. I cooked the cauliflower in the spiced broth for about 15 minutes, then added the squash and simmered for another 10. 
Sprinkled some fresh mint leaves on top and some whole wheat naan on the side for dipping. Yummy!

I saved time by using dried minced onion, and just adding a Tbsp of butter to the squash at the beginning.  I didn't have marjoram, so I used nutmeg, and added a packet of stevia for sweetness.  Having said that, I loved this soup.  Perfect thing for a cold autumn night.

One brick of cream cheese was enough to make this soup thick and creamy. I tripled the marjoram. I also tripled the black pepper and cayenne for added heat to the back of the soup. I garnished with green onion and served with sour dough toast and roasted leg of lamb. Delicious!

Very Yummy! I doubled the cayenne, may even use more next time. Didn't have enough squash, so I substituted about half the amount with boiled baby carrots. I also used half the cream cheese. Will definitely make again!

Delicious absolutely amazing and easy. I used half the cream cheese and cut the squash in half placing it face down on a lightly oiled baking sheet for 20 mins at 375 first then boiled it for 5 mins and then pureed. It was a just a tad lumpy but so darn good. Ive been asked to make it for everyone again next week.

All four of the adults at the table raved about this soup. My three kids decided in advance that they weren't going to like it, but two of them changed their mind after trying it. Success! I love making soup on a cold fall afternoon, so thanks for the recipe.  I'll make it again. Oh, and I did follow the advice of fellow reviewers who used half of the recommended amount of cream cheese. It was plenty.

The cream cheese in this soup is too overwhelming.I changed it up after tasting it,To tone the cream cheese taste down, I made up half the recipe again minus any cream cheese and added this to the 1st batch.
I followed up with 1 tsp of nutmeg and 2 tablespoons of brown sugar create a savory taste.

I am obsessed with this soup. I cut the cream cheese amount in half and add some grated parmesan and sharp white cheddar. Holy monkeys...this is the best! I've made it four times in the last month.

This soup was really good BUT definitely need to halve the cream cheese - was overpowering. Also, I cooked the squash in the oven to soften it up before scooping it out (cut in half, cut side down in a bit of water in pan).

I really liked this recipe,but just a little too mild for my taste -   I doubled the spice quantities & it was fantastic.

Once you make this soup there won't be a need for another roasted butternut squash soup recipe; this is hands down the best!  I tweek mine ever so slightly.  I don't put the cream cheese in mine.  Instead I put heavy cream in the blender because it is the ideal consistency in about 30 seconds.  I might add a bit more stock depending on how much butternut squash I added because I usually add a bit more to get a thicker soup.  I put a big dollop of heavy cream on the top of the soup with a sprinkle of the course red sea salt and some homemade croutons (sourdough bread, butter, olive oil and parmesan cheese and kosher salt).  I use the biggest stock pan I have and we seldom have any leftovers.  The roasted butternut squash makes this recipe a real winner!

The basic recipe is ok but it was a little bland.  I added brown sugar, cloves, cinnamon, and nutmeg to taste.  Also followed other reviewers comments Andes an apple and apple juice (no cider n hand).  I only added 4 oz of cream cheese.   This is an essential ingredient as it adds a new layer of flavor but I think the full amount called for in the recipe is over the top.

Bland, added 1 teaspoon pink salt, doubled the oregano that I used instead of marjoram, and doubled the cayenne.  I also used a little less cream cheese. The extra salt may not have been necessary if I would have used the boullion instead of the low sodium chicken broth.  Served with homemade garlic butter croutons and toasted Italian bread.

This soup was so good I had to comment!  I bought two smaller squashes, and microwaved them for 3 minutes to soften the skin.  It was easy to peel and cube them after that.  I substituted butter for margarine, used chicken broth instead of water and bullion cubes, added a little garlic, doubled the cayenne, and used half the cream cheese.  The result was heavenly!!

Roasted the squash, added a sliced apple to the stove top with the mixture before pureeing.  Added a dash of nutmeg, cinnamon, and ground ginger as well.  This was really good.  Added pumpkin seeds and a dollop of sour cream when serving.

Delicious, and oh-so-easy! Substituted a greek yogurt based cream cheese for the regular. Smooth and creamy with the classic butternut flavor. Yum! This will be a regular.

I used the recipe as a rough guideline. I added 2 soft apples that would have been thrown out to the sauteing onions and used fresh oregano instead of dried marjoram (didn't have any).  I roasted 2 medium butternut squash.  I added a bit of salt at the end to taste and used about 6oz of cream cheese.  It was great.  I think this is one of those recipes you can tweak to fit the ingredients you have on hand.

OMG, this is SO GOOD!  Like many others, I roasted the squash first - the day before I made it - then peeled and cut the squash up when cooled and kept in the fridge overnight. When I came home from work the next day, it was short work to throw everything together for dinner.  I also used one pkg of cream cheese, and my own chicken stock instead of water/bouillon - otherwise no changes.  Yum, yum!

This is delicious - of course a couple of differences.  I did roast the squash along with an onion and a couple pieces of garlic at 375 degrees for 40 minutes as others mentioned.  I diced the roasted onion and sauteed it in the butter and then added the squash.  I used 2 squash so for spices I did 1/2 tsp white pepper and just a tiny bit less than a 1/4 tsp of cayenne and 1 tbsp brown sugar.  I used the immersion blender and added non-fat half and half.  It is SO GOOD.  Will make this again very soon.

I loved this recipe.  But I cooked the squash whole in my crock pot on low for 8 hours. It was super easy to peel and completely cooked. I also used neufchatel cheese instead of cream cheese to lower the fat and calories. I think it would be just as good with half the cheese as well.

Easy soup.  I used 4 oz. of cream cheese (that's all I had in the house).  It was delicious.  To save time buy a squash that is already cut into pieces.  Playing with the spices can make a big difference.  The cayenne really made the flavors POP!  A great and comforting soup for the fall.  It goes well with raking leaves and apples.

I prefer to use the broth and no water, 1/2 the cream cheese and 2 diced pears added to the saute'.  Either way a wonderful fall/winter soup that everyone loves.  Can add a small dollop of sour cream on top when served.

Absolutely will make this again. Just delicious. I made 1.5 of this recipe, used a half cup more of the substituted chicken broth (to use up 3 full cans instead of 2.5) in addition to the bullion, not in place of, and used the two cream cheese as called for in the original recipe (not 1.5). I had no problem cutting up the squash-cut it in rings of about 1.5" wide, then peeled it around like you would an apple, then chopped. It was very flavorful and just a smidge on the salty side and not as thick as the picture, which was fine. Next time I will just double the recipe and use only half of the bullion. Still, first attempt was a smash hit! I almost put cubed ham in it, but wanted to taste the recipe as is, so I put the ham on our salads instead-paired very well with the soup. So good.

Only gave it 4 stars because of the 16 oz of cream cheese.  I used 8 oz and could have even used a little less.  I also added roasted yellow peppers and turmeric.  This is a very good base soup to play around with.  Husband loved it.

If I make this again, I would only use one package of  cream cheese. I didn't not care for the texture, which is unusual for me. The flavor was good. My husband seemed to like it more than me.

Have made this recipe many many times but I have only made it with cream cheese once and only 1 package not two.  I generally use about a cup a whole milk or evaporated milk in place of the cream cheese as I prefer it not to be quite so rich.   The blend of spices is very nice.  This soup has excellent flavour!

You can also substitute coconut milk for Philly cheese, roast the cubed butternut squash beforehand and puree only half of it and also add lentils - delicious

Very filling and delicious. I highly recommend halfing the cream cheese and doubling the cayenne. I love a rich soup but two 8oz packages of cream cheese would have been to much.

Is wonderful.  Best way to describe it is creamy yet frothy, butterly delicious.  I only made a few minor changes because of what I had on hand and taste preferences.  Like everyone else, I roasted the butternut squash ahead of time to make it soft and easier to work with.  I roasted 2 butternut squash and 5 carrots.  I only used 1 package of cream cheese, and I used the fat free kind to make the recipe a little more healthy.  And I added about a tbsp. of garlic when sautéing the onions.  Wonderful recipe though.  Perfect for a cool fall day!

Fabulous soup.  Everyone loved it!  I roasted the squash with olive oil and crushed garlic, black pepper and salt and only added 1 bar of cheese.  Thick and creamy.  2 thumbs up!!!

Tweaked the recipe (for my own tastes)
- Skinned the squash before roasting it per SLJ6's review as I used most of their tweaks as well, made for easier handling.
- Cubed the squash instead of quartering it.
- Tripled the garlic, we love garlic.
- 6 cups equals approx 1 squash FYI
- Substituted Veggie broth for Chicken
- Sauted the onions in butter instead of margarine
- Halved the cream cheese

Great soup! Warm, comforting, and freezes wonderfully. Vegetarian family loved it and meatatarian DBF tolerated it. Very heavy and filling, and I can eat a lot so with a salad could be a meal in and of itself.

I have been making this recipie for years and I have finally perfected it!!! I made a few tweaks with trial and error over the years but this soup is amazing if you do the following:

Use 3 butternut squash, halved and roasted in the oven with crushed garlic and evoo at 350 until soft. Let cool and refrigerate over night only because I'm lazy.

Sautee 1/4c onion, add squash, 1 large peeled Granny Smith Apple and 4c water. Boil, then purée with immersion blender.  I get about 10-12c squash out of the 3 I use. Add 5 bullion cubes, add more water as I go to desired consistency. Add 1 brick of cream cheese, 1tbs marojam, 1tsp cyanne, fresh pepper and some fresh salt. Let simmer stirring occasionally for an hour to marry the flavors.

Roast the squash seeds in olive oil, a dash of salt and some lowerys seasoning salt... Just a smudge! Use this to top the soup!!! Soooooo good! 

Serve with crusty bread and cyanne powder. Mind blown!

I pre-cooked the squash in the oven and scooped it out of the skins.  I also substituted coconut oil for the margarine, same quantity.  Lastly, I restrained the cream cheese amount to one 8 ounce brick.  (Otherwise the original recipe was closely followed.)  

The results were terrific.  (I think using 16 ounces of cream cheese would have been too rich for my taste.)

This is a good savory butternut squash soup! Used 2 squash and baked them first to soften them up. Only one package of cream cheese was needed, that made it plenty creamy enough. Instead of water used broth for added flavor.

Wow - this was much better than I expected, and much easier.  I used a quart of chicken broth rather than the water/cubes.  I also peeled and chopped an apple to add, and went heavy on the spices (except the cayenne).  I used only 1/2 the cream cheese (low fat), and I just used my little hand mixer, removed from heat after 20 minutes and mixed 8 oz of cream cheese in.  I can only imagine how rich and wonderful this would be had I used all the cream cheese.  Definitely a keeper and good enough for company.

It was fast and easy using pre-cut, cubed squash from the grocery and frozen diced onion. I also added some nutmeg and a big dollop of organic applesauce for sweetness. I only used 6 oz. of cream cheese. Delicious!

I halved the squash and microwaved until soft like I always do. I scooped out the squash and added about 1 & 1/2 cups of water to puree. I also added 1 tart apple (peeled and cored) to the squash when pureeing. I used vegetable bouillon instead of chicken,  only 1 - 8oz package of lower fat cream cheese, 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and topped at table with chopped chives.

Only use one pack of cream cheese (or none!) I added a couple of carrots and some Cajun seasoning and it tastes good but two packages of cream cheese overtakes taste-wise and consistency-wise. I added some more chicken stock at the end to try and thin it out and it worked to a small degree but I wouldn't make this recipe again without alterations.

I omitted the cream cheese, didn't have quite enough butternut squash to make 6 cups so added a sweet potato.  Also, didn't have marjoram and substituted Thyme.  Otherwise, the recipe was the same.  It had good flavor and was very filling.  Served it with a dollop of sour cream and a side of green salad with apples and cumin cheese with a Walla Walla poppyseed dressing that was a nice, sweet offset to the savory flavor of the soup...oh, and a nice baguette completed dinner.

This is a great starter recipe. I really enjoyed making it. I did make some modifications. I roasted the butternut with olive oil, fresh garlic, S&P. I only used half of the cream cheese as I didn't want the cheese to over power the squash. Added extra cayenne, 2 cans of chicken broth and 1 cup of water.

Been eyeballing this one for a while and finally had some free time to make it yesterday before a ball game, Let me tell you that this was just delicious! If my picky eating son, says its yummy; then it is a great day!!! I only modified slightly: Coconut oil instead of margarine, about 1/2 tsp on all the spices and used 1.5 boxes of chicken stock with one bullion cube thrown in, and we like onions so I diced up a whole sweet vidalia and let it sweat for a while, and only one thing of fat free cream cheese... So nothing crazy just a few minor tweaks to our preference BUT was a fantastic soup and garnished with some chive and a pinch of Mozz!

For the most part, we loved this soup. I just now read the past review suggesting putting the butternut squash in the oven to help with the peeling process. I highly recommend that. I had a very hard time peeling that thing! 

The soup had fantastic flavor. Our only complaint was that it was pretty rich. I'm not sure how to remedy that problem, because, frankly, rich isn't always a bad thing. However, we all left a little hungry because we didn't eat as much as we might have if it wasn't so rich. 

With that being said, I would still recommend making this soup for a nice cool Autumn day.

I wanted a lower fat option and also one that was dairy free. So I used a DF butter substitute and left out the bullion, water, and cream cheese. Instead I used almond milk and a little more seasoning. (More cayenne, salt, pepper, garlic, & parsley). My little ones didn't like it, but the older kids and adults loved it! (It was a bit on the spicy side).  Also, I roasted the squash, then scooped out the cooked meat. The onions I sauteed with all the seasoning, then blended it all together with the almond milk in batches. Finally, I let it simmer while making the rest of the meal. Very yummy!

Awesome recipe.  I've been making it for years.  Freezes well.  The only thing I changed is that I use half of the  cream cheese that the recipe calls for and I also use the neufchatel and not the full fat version of cream cheese.

We liked it but did make a few changes after reading reviews. I cut, seeded and microwaved the squash sprinkled with garlic powder until tender then scooped out. I made 1-1/2 batches and used only 2 bricks of cream cheese. I used slightly less cayenne pepper for our taste. I would make again.

I substituted the potatoes with one large sweet potato.  I  also added one tablespoon of brown sugar and a tablespoon of ground ginger.  Oh, and one Granny Smith Apple. I made a roux with the butter (I used a whole stick) the onions, celery, brown sugar, ginger, salt and pepper.  The rest I followed as directed.  It is soooooo good!

Excellent. We love butternut squash soup at a few of our favorite restaurants but I had never made it before. It turned out great,  I followed the suggestion of half the cream cheese and added a little ginger. I used my stick blender and it was so easy. Will be planting squash in the garden next year.

My first time making butternut squash soup. Loved this soup! Thank you for the recipe and reviews to help me twig it the way I know I would like it. I sprayed a tinfoil lined pan with olive oil and roasted a small butternut squash (open side down/scoop out the seeds)and 2 cloves of garlic (put them under the hole where the seeds were) at 350 degrees for 45 min. Let it cool down. While it was cooling I sauteed 2T butter with finely chopped onion until soft. I added 1C of the chicken stock. I scooped out the squash with an icecream scoop and added it to the pot along with 2 more cups of the chicken stock, a pinch of  five spice (I didn't have cloves so this worked), black pepper to taste. Then I put it all in the blender and mixed it up.I heated it back up in the pot, then added a dollup of sour cream and mixed it in.(I did not use any cream cheese) I spooned it into bowls and grated parmesan cheese in the middle and added a pinch of parsley flakes.  Mmmm so good! Makes 4-5 bowls

I used one pkg of cream cheese, added 1/4 tsp of ground nutmeg and ground ginger plus a pinch of ground cloves.  I used chicken stock instead of water.  Served it for an early thanksgiving meal with a large group and everyone loved it.

This soup is really good! It is easy to prepare and it tastes amazing! I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth, and I added paprika and a little bit of cream before serving.

Too creamy.  I think this could be a much lighter soup.  I would enjoy it more if it had a lighter flavor, too.  I wouldn't make it again.

This wasn't a total fail. First I used Neufchâtel cheese instead. It just gives it an extra layer of flavor. But 2 8oz were too many. I woul recommend 12 oz and maybe 2 butternut squash. But as far as seasoning this needed a lot more. I used cayenne and chilli powders and a roasted garlic in with the onions. 
I live the base for the soup though.

I did the roasting of the butternut squash and halved the cream cheese and it came out great! I would even use a bit less cream cheese. Added a bit of cumin too- delicious!

anytime I've had butternut squash soup it always had a hint of sweetness to it which I don't really care for. This recipe is savory and for that I'm absolutely in love. Instead of marjoram are used a quarter teaspoon of dried rosemary and half a teaspoon of fresh sage. I'm definitely saving this recipe so that I can make it again and again.

It's a good recipe but 16oz of cream cheese is way too much. I only used 12oz and it was still to heavy. Next time I'll try 8. I didn't have enough squash so I subbed the remainder with carrots and that was fine. For the broth I used homemade chicken stock. My daughter loved it but agreed that it needed less cream cheese.

I like this recipe because you can whip up a wonderfully rich flavored pot of soup in no time. I'm sure all the provided tweaks add to the flavor, but if you want something great from the get go, try this recipe. You won't be disappointed.

Kids love it!  I used only one package of cream cheese and just a sprinkle of ground ginger in addition to the restof the spices the recipe calls for.  Only minor changes...  This is a great base recipe for your own modifications.

Really liked the flavor of this soup.  I followed directions exactly, and thought it a little too creamy.  Next time I will only do 1 block of cream cheese.

I followed the advice of one reviewer who shared she cut the butternut squash in half and microwaved the the squash for 5 minutes. It was easy to peel and cooked somewhat. It saved some time also. My family really enjoyed this. I followed the recipe as written otherwise.

i only used 1/2 the cream cheese and still thought it was too...cream cheese tasting for me. but the squash flavor was amazing. my squash was a little over 2 lbs - i cut it in 1/2 , drizzled olive oil, salt, and pepper, and baked in over at 350 for 30 minutes, then preceded with the recipe as written. the hardest part was getting the skin off of it. next time i may skin before baking. once everything was sauteed together in the pan and just before blending with cream cheese, i tasted the squash and it was AMAZING. it was so good i almost didn't want to make it into soup! i'd like to try a slightly healthier/less rich version that didn't involve cream cheese or at least not so much of it...

I used to make a version of this when I lived in the BAsque country in Spain.  Instead of onions, I used a couple of chopped leeks, sauteed until soft, then added cubes of squash or pumpkin and the chicken stock.  Let it cook until soft, throw in ONE, not two lower fat cream cheese packages and used an immersion blender to make a smooth, rich, almost puree-like soup.

This soup is a stand by for me with a couple of changes. I am allergic to dairy so I use coconut milk instead of cheese. I also add 1 T of fresh ginger and a few red pepper flakes. It is one of my favorites. I cook my squash as (in the skin) in the microwave for  about 15 minutes depending on size. Then I cut it, deseed it, and scoop out the squash with a spoon. This is so much easier that trying to peel and cut up raw.

I make this soup all the time. It's always a hit and freezes well. I like to serve it with fish or pork. I have tried this recipe as is and it was great. After a few times I started adding a roasted red pepper as well as roasting the squash. It brings out the the flavours. As far as the cream cheese, it really dose ad a great dimension but the things that are bad for us always do. The soup stands on its own without it but I think the cream cheese is worth the calories, after all it's a starter not a meal.

tasted like nothing but cream cheese and came out baby food consistency.  I added some apples and apple cider vinegar which only had the effect of making it taste like sour cream cheese baby food.

I followed others' advice and cut cream cheese in half. I added the first half a package to blender, but forgot the other half. So I ended up only using 1/4 of the cream cheese called for. My husband loved it and said to leave it that way.

I didn't change a thing the first time. It came out perfect. The 2nd time I added 1/2 of an acorn squash and it was just as good just a little sweeter. Either way everybody loves it so much I grew my own squash this year. Thanks.

This is a great recipe so don't ruin it by using vegetable oil spread, yuck! Only real butter please... By the way water comes from the tap not a bottle made by Nestles!

Yummy!  I've made this several times and loved it each time!  I have used leeks instead of onions, and that's good, too.  I usually double the recipe but only use approx 12 oz of cream cheese (1 1/2 blocks - the doubled recipe calls for 4 blocks).   I also use chicken broth in place of the water/boullion.  Can add a little more chx broth if the cheese you add makes too thick.

Used chicken broth instead, roasted squash first, added garlic powder and curry powder as seasoning. YUM! Favorite at our house!

Excellent, hearty soup!   I only had 1/2 of a squash, so I added two carrots and one potato, and used just one packet of cream cheese.  The cayenne pepper added just enough kick to the soup, but don't add more than the recommended amount.   This is so easy to make and even my 89 & 86 year old parents, and their 88 yr old friend, loved it!   I'll be making this again soon.

I've made this many times and have even prepared this for guests. Everyone loves it. I use cumin to flavor the soup and cut the cream cheese way back - about 1/2 a package to the full recipe.

This is a great recipe.  I only add about 1/3 of cream cheese, a dash of heavy cream, 1 celery stick and about 5 baby carrots. If yiu don't have marjoram, a sprinke of oregano or basil, a pinch of salt.

I loved this soup, but like the others, I also roasted the squash in the oven for about 40 minutes at 350 to make it sweeter.  I also added nutmeg and cut the cream cheese in half.  Oh, and based on personal taste, I cut out the cayenne pepper completely.  It's delish.  Highly recommend.

I love this easy recipe. I make it often and yes roast the squash first. I also half the cream cheese and use broth, Sometimes I add an acid like cooking sherry or a couple tablespoons balsamic vinegar. The original recipe was perfect the way it is though, I just like to experiment.

I modified this recipe based on the reviews and what I had on hand. I roasted the squash. I included a potato to thicken the soup a bit as I didn't have the cream cheese. I included a bit of cream at the end (probably somewhere around 2/3 and 1 c).  Delicious!

Just made this tonight and it was super yummy!  I had to downsize because I had a smaller squash, so my measurements were estimates.  It was pretty good as written but I tasted it before serving and decided not to add the other half of the cream cheese and to add salt and cinnamon.

I used one cup of water and one cup of half and half (That's what I had in the house),  and no chicken bullion.   I baked the squash whole (with some serving sized fork holes stuck in it) for an hour. Let it cool and scraped the skin off. It was so easy. I added some salt. I will add some kick to it later. Since I changed it I felt I should only give it a 4 star.

Great recipe! I changed it up a bit ... Used no soy gluten free butter and only just a spoon of cream cheese and sprinkled goat cheese. The cayenne pepper is a must. It gives a nutty creamy soup with a good kick (cayenne).

I made this in my vitamix - delicious and easy!! I roasted the halved squash face-down as others suggested. To make it all in my 8 cup blender pitcher I: used onion powder (a little over a tablespoon), 3 cups organic chicken broth, and only one package of cream cheese. I can see myself roasting the squash and having everything in the pitcher ready to go when we are entertaining.

I am putting 4 vs 5 stars because I slightly altered the recipe. My butternut squash was 4 cups worth so I decided to reduce the quantities accordingly. I also had to substitute oregano because I didn't have the marjoram on hand (its in the same family just a little stronger so reduced amount to 1/4 tsp). I also used reduced fat cream cheese and instead of cayenne pepper I had a smokey hot pepper meade that I thought would add good flavor instead. Then I tried it and thought it still needed something. I added some cooked broccoli florets and cubeds some baked chicken. Yep thats what it needed to make it fabulous in my book and I shall continue to do so going forward. :) -Thanks for the recipe!

I did not care for this recipe.  Definitely way too much cream cheese.  Will try to find another recipe that's lighter.

Was better than I thought. We all ate it, but wasn't a super favorite. Was easy to make with frozen cubed squash

I made this with blue Hubbard squash....OHHHHH  it was delicious.   I used butter instead of margarine and chicken broth instead of bouillon cubes and water.   It was so wonderful!   I licked the bowl!!!  I added nutmeg and cinnamon and a bay leaf.   Wonderful!

This was awful. It ended up looking and tasting just like nacho cheese you find at a ballpark. I had to dump it down the drain. If I was doing it again, I'd play with much less cream cheese.  I'd start with about a half of one package, blend it in, see what it tasted like, and go from there.

because of having a very large meal i decided to omit 8 ounces of cream cheese, leaving only one package in the soup. I tell you, that this is an amazing recipie! I never stay fully true to any recipie so although i added my own twist to it, this soup is amazing and really good!

It really doesn't taste like butternut squash AT ALL. And the soup is not orange.  I followed it as written otherwise.  It is an okay soup with a little kick.

Delicious!!  The only thing I did differently was to add a half cup of cilantro to the onions and squash as it was cooking and eliminate the cayenne because I didn't have any.  My entire family ate it and that is saying something.  My husband, who hates soup, turned the pot upside down to scrape the last of it into his bowl.  Definitely making again.

This recipe was had to rate. First, it's an easy soup to make, other than peeling the squash which was a pain. I sliced it into rings and the cut off the sides. I just feel, for me, the taste is way too rich and the consistency is off putting (too thick like baby food). Although I can see the appeal and it is highly rated by others, it wasn't for me.

I have made this soup multiple times and it's always delicious. I speed up the process by cutting the squash in half and microwaving it for about 5 minutes to make cutting the squash much easier. Enjoy!!

We loved this soup!! So creamy and so easy to make.
The hardest part was peeling all the acorns.  I took like the recipe said and cooked the squash for 20 min, but I put a lid on it even though the recipe didn't say to do so.  I would serve it at a dinner party
As an appetizer it was so good. We dipped homemade bread in it and my husband ate 3 bowl fulls.

Hard to please everyone at the table right? Wrong! Easy to make and easy to please. Thrilled to have found this. I agree, baking the squash first is a great hint.

I didn't read the comments of others to first roast the squash until after I had it cubed.  So I went with the original recipe, except I used butter instead of margarine.  Also, I didn't have marjoram, so I substituted 1 tsp coriander, 1 Tbsp curry powder, and 1/2 tsp nutmeg.  I also used only one (8 oz.) package cream cheese instead of 2 as the recipe called for.  It was very tasty!  Although I think next time I will try only 4 oz. cream cheese.  This recipe is simple, forgiving, and can easily be tweeked and experimented with to suite personal taste.

So simple and so yummy! Didn't add the cayenne or marjoram but who cares? My husband wants it again this weekend. I also threw in 1/2 cup salsa from my garden before blending.

My wife loves this recipe, it's so easy. the only thing she did different was when she sautéed the onions in butter she added the black pepper, marjoram, cayenne pepper at that time. For more of a kick she also added a dash of white pepper.

Perfect combo of sweet, savory, creamy, and spicy. This is the BEST fall soup.

Great fall soup! I only used one pack of cream cheese, and; it came out perfectly, still thick and very flavorful. I served with grilled basil and mozzarella sandwiches and it was a perfect Sunday lunch.

The only thing I change is I roast the squash in the oven first and then puree it with the other ingredients in the food processor.  I have been making this every fall for years now and my family asks for it.

Delicious and super easy to make!  Only a few modifications - I used an acorn squash instead of a butternut (it's what I had on hand), and roasted it in a 350 oven - cut side down - on a baking sheet for 45 minutes.  I increased the cayenne pepper to 1/4 t. and added a dash of nutmeg.

I followed some advice and halved the squash, brushed with olive oil, salt, pepper and garlic and baked at 400 for 30 minutes.  Much easier to peel...We like things on the spicy side, so I doubled the cayenne pepper, added a dash of nutmeg, a tsp of brown sugar, 2 chopped potatoes, and a chopped apple; boiled for 20 minutes then added the squash and boiled for another 10 minutes.  The cream cheese added a wonderful flavor.  As in previous reviews, I only used one 8 oz brick of cream cheese.  Absolutely delicious!

I have made butternut squash soup before and wanted to try another recipe. The amount of cream cheese seemed like too much so I only put in about 6 oz of cream cheese. I have to agree with other reviews that the cream cheese ruins this. It adds a tang that butternut squash can't compete with. Might have been better with just a splash of cream or half and half. It was also too thick. Cannot recommend this.

I roasted the squash with a little salt and pepper   45 min at 350 for easier peeling, used half the cream cheese, 1/4 tsp cayenne. Added a little salt and a dash of sugar and cinnamon (I like just a hint of sweet with a little kick). So good!!!

This was very easy to prepare after I fought the squash to cut into chunks.  I did not have marjoram so I did not use it & I used crushed jalapeño instead of cayenne pepper.  I thought it was delicious, but very rich.  Next time I'll use less cream cheese.   This was my first time ever to cook butternut squash.

Loved the taste but I changed it up the recipe a little. I used butternut and acorn squash. But kept everything else the same. Soooo good. Oh and also forgot to put in the blender tried mixer but next time I will use the blender. But still turned out great.

This was really delicious. Felt like I was eating at a gormet restaurant. I used low sodium children broth instead of water and chicken bouillon cubes, that's why I only gave it a 4 star rating. The cream cheese made the soup. Thanks for recipe. I will make this again.

One of the best soups I have ever made. I have made it so many times. I keep the ingredients the same, but don't measure any of it.  I used one package of cream cheese and it came out perfect.  I even threw in a bag of frozen butternut squash one time along with the fresh and it came out tasting perfect.  Best soup ever!

My tween daughter loves this (surprisingly) and actually puts in requests for it!  One package of cream cheese is plenty.  The squash is a pain to deal with, but when I roasted it, my family found it to be too sweet.  May try to microwave and see if that eases the prep.

This recipe is AMAZING!
The cream cheese really gives a beautiful texture. However I modified this a bit. I used 1 package of cream cheese and 1 wedge of smoked Gouda. It have the soup an amazing, rich smoky flavor. Highly recommend making this! It was a huge hit and I will be using this recipe again

I found using the ingredients asked for, and the amounts.  The end result was too bland for my taste.  Two packages of cream cheese, this favour seemed to dominate the result. Also using the amounts asked for I have way more then six servings.  I hope it freezes.  Will not try this again.

I recently had my wisdom teeth pulled, so I have been limited to a liquid only diet. I saw this recipe and went for it. I halved the recipe for less servings, but it still turned out well. My dad loves it.  Looks like I will be making this soup again.

Because this soup is rather "bland" in the sense that there isn't a mix of vegetables or beans in it, I choose to serve it over white rice. It is an easy way of making it a hearty soup :)

I have had butternut squash soup before that was MUCH sweeter and better tasting. While the consistency was great, the taste wasn't on par for me. I added brown sugar and cinnamon to help compensate for the lack of taste but it still wasn't the same...still searching for a good butternut squash soup recipe :(

Oh, and one pack of cream cheese is plenty! Richness was fine.

This recipe was not bad, but it's probably not my most favorite soup. I added everything that was already stated except the marjoram and cayenne pepper simply because I didn't have it. I used just regular pepper instead. I also didn't use cream cheese and instead using corn starch to thicken the soup. I also used a mixture of papaya and squash instead of just squash because I was short. I also added just a bit of heavy cream. Overall the soup wasn't bad!

Love this recipe as is and always get great compliments. Did try a different twist for the summer by omitting the marjoram, cayenne and cream cheese and adding a dollop of coconut oil and pinch of nutmeg. It was equally as good!

This recipe is delicious and easy to make.  It's a regular in the rotation at our house.  I use oregano instead of marjoram (half of the recipe amount for marjoram), 1 bar of cream cheese and chicken broth instead of water.

Great recipe. 
I followed some of the changes and added my own and my boyfriend said it is his all time favorite soup and he doesn't even like butternut squash. 

First, I cut two butternut squash in half, put some EVOO and salt/pepper on them and cut side down roasted them at 375 for 45 min. 

Towards the end of the squash cooking time, I sautéed the onions in the butter with two cloves of garlic until translucent. 

I used only two chicken bouillon cubes, added the rest of the ingredients to the pot, including the scooped out squash. Oh and I almost forgot, I added one chopped up and peeled apple to the pot. 

Added that all to a blender and since I only had half a block of cream cheese, used that. 
Tasted PHENOMENAL. 
I topped each bowl with some fresh steamed corn since I had a bunch and wanted to use it and some chopped chives. 

Delish.

I love this recipe! It's one of our family favorites. I made a couple of changes - I bake the squash at 350 for 35 minutes and I add a pinch of nutmeg. Thanks for the recipe!

I baked and seasoned the squash prior. More work, but was worth the flavour payoff. 

Definitely do not use all the cream cheese. 

This soup was delicious however after 2 days it got that grainy texture and I had to throw out.

Loved it but definitely made some tweaks. ..if you want a bit of a healthy twist on it......try substituting coconut oil for butter.  Also the recommendations of cinnamon, garlic and nutmeg is a must! I also left out the potato as I like my squash soup to have mostly that squash  flavour

This is delicious!  I do not normally like squash but love this soup. Fantastic! Used butter, chicken stock, less cream cheese (only 4 oz.), and baked the squash. Easy. Best soup recipe I have. Thanks!

Quick and tasty.  I sauteed the cubed squash for about 5 minutes (after the onions were soft).  Added a bay leaf with other seasonings.  Used half and half and about 4 oz. cream cheese.

This soup was delicious!! I used frozen precooked squash because I didn't have time to roast the squash myself, but it still turned out amazing. I also threw in some pine nuts and dried cranberries right before serving to add a color pop and a little bit of a mix into the flavor. Got great reviews from my guests. Will be making this again!

WOW, I can't get enough of this soup!  What a great texture and flavor.  I could have used a little less crushed red pepper especially for the timid palette.  I used only one cream cheese and it came out incredibly rich.  Used 2 small butternut squash.  I'll make this again and it is a real keeper.  Thanks

Delicious!!!  So easy to make, too!  I bought the butternut squash at Costco already peeled and cubed which made it all the more simple.  I only added 1 1/2 packages of the cream cheese and it was still great. Probably could have used just one 8 oz. package and it would have still been very good.

The only changes I made was to add a bit more [of this and that] as I had more than 6 cups squash.  I also added a bay leaf.  This recipe is SO GOOD AND EASY! Definitely my new favorite.

I made this for the first time and doubled it for our family of five.  I did not make any alterations to the recipe, but wish I had!  Way too much cream cheese!  One 8oz.  Package would have been plenty!  It overpowered the soup and we couldn't taste the squash.  I would like to try it again sometime but with half the cream cheese.

OMG! This was fabulous! Like something in an expensive restaurant where you wish you could have a second helping (but, alas, you can!). I used homemade chicken stock I had just made and like others I only used one package of cream cheese (couldn't bear the thought of all those calories). I also used a precut package of squash, so it was really easy. It was perfect.

This is a great start for butternut squash soup.  I roasted the squash until it was tender (roasting adds much more flavor than boiling it and makes it much easier to cut and peel).  I used oregano instead of marjoram just because I didn't have the marjoram and it was a good substitute.  I used one package of cream cheese and thought it was very creamy.  My husband (who HATES all types of squash) was even impressed by this recipe.  If you have an immersion blender, use it!  Much easier and faster.

This was a real keeper.  I too used real butter (unsalted due to the bouillon.)  I also only used one block of cream cheese. I finished it off with toasted pine nuts.  Delicious!  And so easy.  Definitely better and quicker to roast the squash and scoop it out.

Terrific, though that's way too much cream cheese.  Using one package is fine.  Also I'm good with two or three bouillon cubes instead of four.

I have to admit I did what a few people suggested and put the apple cider and granny smith apple in this recipe that was the only thing I changed. And it was absolutely horrible to sour and the flavors did not blend at all together. I was very disappointed in this soup. I wish I hadn't have wasted the Delicious 2 butternut squash on this recipe, I'm sorry but this gets no stars.

This recipe is good, but I think it calls for too much cream cheese.  When I was in the final stages of prep, I was thinking, wow, I LOVE creamy things - I mean I make my morning coffee as a heavy whip misto - but I thought I'd start small with half the amount of cream cheese - and it was still very heavy.  When I make again, I think I will do with 1/4 the amount.  I have to imagine that this is a typo, because I feel like this recipe is for butternut squash flavored cream cheese.  

Other than this - the recipe is quite fantastic!  I used real butter, add some garlic and extra cayenne, and also added salt as I use homemade stock that does not have any.

OH wow, this is a super yummy recipe. Followed the full recipe, put in all the cream cheese. Very creamy and delicious. But I think next time I can do with just half of the cream cheese or maybe even just a quarter. Try the recipe! It's definitely worthy of all these positive reviews.

Great Recipe! Thank you so much!
This was easy, quick and delicious.  Like so many others, I did alter the recipe some based on the many reviews I read.  The alterations I made that I would do again: Add butter instead of margarine, buy pre pealed and precut fresh squash then boil in store bought chicken broth, add cinnamon, nutmeg about 1/8 cup of fresh parsley and doubled the cayenne for a little extra kick!  Flavor was amazing! Didt not need ANY salt.. love that!

What I would do different... I had already altered the cream cheese down to 1/2  of one pack. If I had to do it again, I would cut it down to 1/4 pack or none. I recommend blending everything and trying it without the cream cheese and perhaps adding it to taste. You may end up with two packs if that is your preference, or you may think 1/2 a pack is perfect, or none at all may suit you.  Just give yourself the chance to make the choice before going all in!

Takes a bit of time to cook, but it tastes awesome. My boyfriend, who says he hates squash, thought it was the best soup I've ever made. Definitely a winner.

Yum!  

The only 2 changes to this recipe were as follows:
1. I used just 1 pkg of cream cheese (1 pkg seemed to be plenty, and I used 1/3 less fat).
2. I baked my butternut squash whole (with a few fork pokes) at 400 for 1 hr and 20 mins.  I used a rather large squash, so if you decide to bake yours, you should adjust your baking time accordingly.

This will definitely be on my list of favorites.  Thanks for sharing!

Followed directions to a T, substituting chicken broth for bouillon.  Delicious.  Was a huge hit at a luncheon I took it to.

Love this recipe but I did make a few changes: I made it a butternut squash/ pumpkin soup. I just split the amount of squash and pumpkin. I also shredded some fresh ginger in after putting it through the food processor. Yummy!

This is the creamiest, richest, most delicious and flavorful soup ever.  What made this extra nice to make was the peeled and cubed squash that was available at Costco during Thanksgiving and Christmas.  Not only did that save money and time, I'm pretty sure it saved a few of my fingertips and the launching of numerous obscenities.

I am lactose intolerant so I was worried that without the cream cheese the recipe would be a flop, however it was absolutely delicious - I didn't have any marjoram as it is not a spice I use often and I used coriander instead which was great!

While I did tweak the recipe a bit, it definitely deserves all 5 stars.  I didn't have a problem peeling the squash with a potato peeler.  For spices, I used a curry masala and pepper.  I also only used one package of cream cheese.  I will definitely be making this recipe again.  It was a huge hit with my family, who, typically are not squash fans.

Love this soup we had it as an appetizer for our Christmas dinner and it was my favourite part of the meal.  We choose to use one package of cream cheese and it worked out perfectly. I am however intrigued at how deliciously rich the soup could taste with two packs.  Either our a dish to remember!!

I did a couple of things different as per other reviews. I roasted the squash and only used 1 package of cream cheese. It was divine. Making it again for my family Christmas get together. Thanks for the recipe and helpful hints.

Made this kind of soup for the first time and I would say I'm not very good in the kitchen. I followed the directions but did reduce the cream cheese as suggested. I found it really easy to make and everyone loved it! I will absolutely make this again.

This is a great recipe, even my husband who does not like squash soup loved it! I did use a little less cream cheese, since it is added at the end, easy to adjust to your liking.

Awesome!  I used chicken broth instead of bouillon and to make this a little thinner I used four cups instead of three.  Absolutely fantastic.  By using more broth I got a soup that was thick but not like gravy.  Everyone enjoyed it.

Very good.  Roasted 2 smallish butternut squashes cut in half at 375 for about an hour. Didn't use nearly as much cream cheese, maybe 6 ounces.

Oh so yummy!  My whole family loved it and I didn't change a thing.  I will definitely make it again.  For those who say butternut squash is hard to peel, I found it peels quite easily using a sturdy potato peeler!  I also roasted the squash before making the soup.

Great recipe.  I used a package of pre-cut squash, and threw a few carrots in for good measure.  I thought the soup was rich enough with just one package of cream cheese.

So easy and yummy. Only thing I would do differently is reduce the amount of cream cheese. Maybe even down to 1 8oz. The soup is good, but you can definitely taste more of the cream cheese.

Wow, this was the best butternut squash soup I've ever made. Rich and delicious. Definitely adding it to the rotation.

I think this soup is wonderful! I have never before had butternut squash, this was my first time and I have to say I am glad i tried it, making this soup! I did however omit one of the cream cheese like others suggested;)

So delicious it almost tastes like a dessert. And it is really filling. All I had was a bowl of salad and a bowl of soup and I was completely satisfied, and I'm training for a marathon so I'm always really hungry!

I tried to make this recipe exactly as it is, except that I did roast the squash ahead of time because it was a beast just to cut in half, and I scaled down some of the measurements because I was just going to use half of a squash.

I brushed on olive oil and rosemary on the faces of the cut-in-half squash, baked them face-down for 1 hour on 375, then scooped out the seeds, peeled them with a potato peeler, and cubed. Meanwhile, I was leaving the cream cheese out to soften. By this point the squash was already really mushy, but I went ahead and boiled it with the onions and other spices. Since the squash had already baked an hour in the oven, it was still really hot, so after I pureed everything in the blender, I just put it in bowls and served. My mother-in-law wanted her bowl heated, but she's the kind who likes things to be scalding. I ate a salad first and my soup was still a good temperature when I moved on to it.

For timing, I put the squash in the oven at 4:15, took out at 5:15, and let them cool, then started peeling at 5:30, did everything else and was ready to serve it by just a little after 6.

Absolutely stellar!  And I didn't have chicken stock, or marjoram....played with measurements, as am genetically predisposed to resist any accuracy or patience with measuring, and it was a massive hit. An absolute favourite, thank you very much.  Should add that I have used water or vegetable broth for the  liquid without a problem, and definitely used only 1 brick of cream cheese--more than enough!  The touch of cayenne just sets it off perfectly.

Yummo!  This was a huge hit with my guests!  I did roast the squash first and then pureed it in my food processor.  I only used 2 pkgs. cream cheese and it was still creamy and loved by all!  It's a keeper.

Amazing! I went back for thirds!  I put a little more squash then the recipe called for so my soup was really thick and I used a bit of basil instead of the marjoram.  I also substituted half and half for the cream cheese.  I will be making this often.  Thanks for the recipe!!

The best!!  I substituted 1 can of coconut cream from Trader Joes in place of the second 8oz of cream cheese(low fat).  Used 1 whole large chopped onion, didn't measure. Also I had no marjoram so I used some Thyme and Basil and used low sodium chicken broth in place of the water and bouillon. Came out wonderful, creamy and perfectly sweet.  I will try this recipe with cauliflower and broccoli.

Amazing recipe! This was the first time I've had butternut squash soup and it was absolutely delicious. I modified it a bit based on everyone's suggestions. I changed the margarine to butter, used only one 8 oz package of cream cheese instead of 2, used 4 cups of chicken stock instead of the water and bullion, and added one clove of crushed garlic. I'll add a bit more cayenne pepper next time to give it an extra zip!

this soup was amazing I made it for my baby shower and everyone loved it! I did however make three changes to it 1) I did not puree the squash and onion mix I just mashed it 2) I only used one 8 oz pack of cream cheese 3) I added cubed butternut squash at the end.

Wow! I recently discovered butternut squash soup when I visited South Africa and couldn't wait to come home and make my own. I roast the squash first as several reviews say and add some ground cloves and cinnamon. I also cut the cream cheese all the way down to only 1/2 of one 8 oz bar and control the thickness by adding chicken broth a little at a time. Great recipe!

First time ever trying butternut squash and wow did this recipe deliver.  The little bit of cayenne really hit the spot, even my 8 year old boy loved it.. we had it with garlic bread. The next day,(today)off the bus, the kids ate it cold and used it as a kind of dip for a sandwich before church. Definitely this recipe will now be on regular rotation. One extra is that we roasted the squash in the oven beforehand, if you do this be prepared for extra time for it. We also doubled the cream cheese, but since we aren't an exact measurement family we probably used more squash also. Yummy!

Everyone in my family loved this soup!  It was creamy and delicious...the flavor and consistency reminded me of a broccoli cheddar soup.  I tried a separate recipe version as well and the only thing I liked better about that version was the addition of chopped carrots before I blended it using an immersion blender.  When I make this recipe again, I'll experiment with adding in some carrots.

I made this for my family the other day, however I only had acorn squash on hand and it worked just as well.  I used half the cream cheese to start and it was perfect. My whole family enjoyed the soup.  I may add some more Cayenne pepper next time for a little more of a kick.  I will be trying a few other ideas that the previous posters shared as well. All in all...it is on my "cook again" list.

As suggested, I roasted my squash first and used butter instead of margarine. I also switched the broth out for stock since I think it has way more flavor and cut the cream cheese in half to avoid it being too rich.  Overall, small little changes to a FABULOUS RECIPE!  Will definitely be making this again! Thank you for sharing :)

Good recipe. Like others I only used half the amount of cream cheese, any more and you;d run the risk of this being squash-fondue. I'd also suggest being careful the water does not boil off and making sure there is enough liquids when you begin blending, or else it comes out too thick. I also doubled the amount of cayenne pepper, because I like the added kick.

Just made this and love it! I read the reviews and made some minor adjustments. First, I made 3 times as much so I can freeze some for later. I also used veggie broth instead of chicken and added about 1/2 cup half and half to make it a creamier texture. Also added about a tablespoon of brown sugar. At first I thought it wouldn't be thick or creamy enough, until I put it in the blender, then it came out perfect! Yum.

We are a family of 4 who have had no choice but to cut back on our food budget. I have added soup night to the rotation along with a salad and bread to stretch things.  this soup was AWFUL - totally inedible in my opinion.  All I tasted was hot cream cheese.  I had no choice but to play with it b/c there was nothing else to feed my family for dinner.  I added another cup of squash and of all things sugar to get rid of that awful hot cream cheese aftertaste.  I refrigerated it (as I made it at lunchtime) and by dinner it was at least edible.    sorry

I baked the squash at 350 for about an hour, scooped it out of the skin into a bowl added the cream cheese and whipped with a beater until it was smooth. then I boiled 4 cups of water with 6 table spoons of margarine added the bouillon. added the rest to the pot and let simmer..then like another viewer suggested..added apple cider!!! yummy!! to die for!

Honestly I think this produces a better soup, with less hassle, than roasting the squash first. Shocking I know. But it works well for me. I use real butter and 1/8th of the cream cheese called for. Honestly I would not add more than 4 oz of it and it is still velvety smooth. A go-to for us!

This is my first time making this soup.  I was hesitant to try it because my daughter hates squash of any kind.  It's almost finished warming up and she tasted it saying it was 'delicious!'   Thanks for a great and simple recipe!

That is delicious.  Simple flavors that blended well together.  And much easier to make than I thought it would be.  I did add a bit more squash and only used one 8 oz. package of cream cheese.  And as a warning- it makes rather more than I suspected it would.  More than my husband and I could put down in 2 meals.

I just tried this for the first time and it was a success. I used organic chicken broth and only one package of cream cheese. Texture is great, has good flavor. I sprinkled bacon bits on top as a finisher. I'd like to try experimenting with different flavors and toppings, but overall it's quite good the way it is!

This soup is SOOOOO good.  I have been making it for years and am finally leaving a review.  The only thing I would add that makes it so rick and yummy is that I roast the butternut squash....I cut it in half. drizzle my pan with olive oil and roast at 400ish until I can easily poke a fork into the butternut.  I let it cool then just scoop out the squash into my pot.  It adds a whole new dimension to the soup!

My husband and I made this tonight to use up a butternut squash that came in our weekly box of organic veggies. We did make a few modifications to the recipe. We cut the squash in half, seasoned with salt and pepper, rubbed with a little olive oil and roasted it, cut side down, in a 375 degree oven for 45 minutes.  Since there was no marjoram or cayenne pepper in the pantry, we subbed in a tiny bit of hot chilli powder for heat and flavor. Also, we cut down the bouillon to two cubes as ours is not sodium-free and it seemed that 4 cubes would make the soup too salty. It tasted beautifully rich as it was so we decided not to add any cream cheese, which cut down the fat.  We did thin the soup with some 2% milk before serving as the texture was a little thick - everyone in the family loved it. Great recipe - will definitely make again, especially in the wintertime!

Took the common advice of baking the squash first. But the problem is this recipe has way too much cream cheese - might try with 1/2 next time.

This was SO SO yummy! Like others, we did cut the cream cheese to about 7oz (Instead of 16oz) and we used 3 cups chicken broth instead of the water/cubes. I also roasted the squash first. It was absolutely delicious and will definitely make this again!

I made this soup for the family and everyone loved it. It really needs a bit more salt and we added a dash of cinnamon which gave it a kind of "harvest" taste. All in all, a great recipe for a smooth delicious cold weather soup.

This is a must-have in our kitchen these days! I've tweaked the recipe and added the Italian Seasoned Philly Creme Cheese cooking creme; I've added celery to the sauteed onion step; all variations have been a huge success! Thanks for making me feel like a chef- this one impresses!

This was pretty good, but I wouldn't make it for guests. I only used one pkg of cream cheese because I tried it after one, and it already tasted cream cheesy. Also, I didn't have marjoram, so I used herbes de provence.

This tasted great but it was a pain to make.  Peeling a raw butternut squash is just not a great idea, so I boiled it whole and then peeled it and chopped it, then added it to the onions and water.  I ended up having to add at least double the water and bouillon because the mixture was too thick for me to puree.  As a final product, the soup was very good, but it's not fun to make and the broth amount in the ingredients needs to be doubled, or the squash and cream cheese halved.

If youre trying to be a little bit healthier when making this just omit the cream cheese and milk all together and add about 3 cups of chicken broth, this is for six servings. I swear it pretty much taste identical just a few hundred calories less, and you might prefer not to use as much salt bc there's usually salt in the broth. Hope this helped!

I thought this tasted pretty good before I added the cream cheese...and I used only 1 package of it.  The cream cheese was still overpowering.  I baked the squash first for 40 min. and then scooped it out.  I might try again without the cream cheese.

I just wish I had found this recipe sooner! I used half of the cream cheese that the recipe called for, and it was still very rich. I would do the same, or possibly use even less in the future. The flavor profile is perfect, it could be a bit spicier if you like spicy food, but is great as is. We will definitely be making this again.

Wow, lots of suggestions which I read quite a few. Used only one cream cheese. This recipe is defintely a keeper. You can have many variations and still create an incredible tasting soup. Thanks.

Just finished making and eating this. Wow, there's a reason for so many amazing reviews! I followed other suggestions and only added 3 oz of cream cheese. The soup was so thick that I ended up adding some skim milk to thin it out. So incredibly delicious!!

Loved it!  Used 1/2 the cream cheese (forgot to buy two) and it was PERFECT! I ate two small bowls after dinner as I was "putting the leftovers away"! Don't think I can freeze it so I will just keep eating it until it is gone. Lucky me!

I used three cups of chicken stock in place of water and bouillon.  At mealtime, I found it needed seasoning and heat, so added salt and Tabasco sauce.  Next time I make it, I'll use a full teaspoon of cayenne.

This soup is delicious! I cut the cream cheese in half like others suggested and used vegetarian bouillon. Will definitely make again!

The whole family loves this.  Delicious and very filling for a soup.  The kids didn't even know they were eating vegetables until I made the mistake of letting them watch me make it.

I loved this soup and so did my family. I did make some changes after reading some of the reviews.  I used 2 tablespoons of butter I don't like margarine, 3/4 of the cream cheese ( I thought 2 pkg was too much)and I did not use chicken bouillon instead I used 32oz of chicken broth from the box or you can use the cans. I peeled the butternut cut in pieces and put in the oven in a cookie sheet to roast. You can adjust the consistency of your soup by adding water or you can add half and half. Since I did not use 2 packages of cream cheese I did add some half and half. If your soup looks great and taste wonderful then you made a delicious soup. Very good on these cold days. :)

Really good - I had to scale down as I didn't have enough squash so didn't have measurements down quite right.  But really creamy & good flavor.

This was amazing.  Even my college-age son loved it.  I used half the amount of cream cheese called for and found that it was more than rich enough.

Delicious!!!! I added a good squirt of Sriracha to heat it up and it was awesome. Next time i think i'll try using less cream cheese to make it a little less rich.

This is yummy! If you have a Trader Joe's in your area, you can buy bagged, diced butternut squash.  It's a perfect-sized bag for this recipe and a huge time-saver. Just pop the squash into the broth (with the cooked onions) and simmer for about 20 min.

Thanks for sharing such a great recipe! Per reviews, I roasted the squash (and garlic) first, to make the squash easier to peel. The only substitutions I made were: bacon fat instead of margarine for sauteing the onion and plain yogurt instead of cream cheese (because I had it already). 

We had mixed reviews over this in our house... I loved it. It has a gorgeous color, a smooth texture, and an uncomplicated flavor with a bit of a kick. This is quite a spicy soup. It was too 'hot' for my three year old & I ended up making something else for her. Next time, I'll keep that in mind. My squash-hating husband didn't like it, but said I should make this at Thanksgiving (though I'm guessing he meant so he'd only have to eat it once a year! *laugh*).

I loved it this soup. I will be making this soup for my dinner parties until I find another to love. I tweaked it a little, I used one package of cream cheese and substituted the 3 cups of original soy milk instead of water too keep up with the creamy flavor. I did not have marjoram so I used oregano and thyme instead. Thank you for such a yummy recipe.

Just tried this one.  My hubs who hates squash loved it.  As well as the toddler.  It's a forgiving recipe.  Went a touch light on the cream cheese, accidentally doubled the bouillon, and used sage instead of the marjoram that I didn't have.  Absolutely will make this again... with a touch less bouillon (that made it taste a little veggie-dip-ish).

I used this recipe as a base.  
My version:  
. Substitute marjoram with basil
. Increase cayenne pepper to 1/4 tsp
. Reduced cream cheese to 1-8oz package

Great, easy recipe.  I know the squash can make the soup sweet, so I added 2 cloves of garlic to the onions.  I also added a red chili for a little kick and instead of cream cheese, added half and half after I pureed the soup.  Delicious.

This was exce llent!  and I've ruined a good butternut before!  I did bake the squash in the oven cut side up (reversed from what I tried last time) and just salt and peppered it.  I used 2 cans of chicken broth (my squash was a bit small) and only about 3 oz of cream cheese.  DELISH!

I added a couple cloves of garlic and used vegetable bollion cubes instead of chicken cubes, and didn't use the cream cheese it was so savory and flavorful without it! May use a little whipping cream if it comes out too thick.

This is a yummy very creamy squash soup.    I made it to recipe except that I agree with a lot of other reviewers-  Half the cream cheese was plenty!!    It was probably still a little too rich.  I too quartered the squash and then roasted it cut sides down in the oven as other reviewers suggested.   More flavorful and easier to peel the squash.  But still a great recipe.

So easy and tasty, and healthier with some substitions:  I used ghee (for the butter),8 oz. homemade kefir cheese (for the cream cheese), homemade chicken stock, and blended it in the VitaMix.

It was delicious!  We used just one bar of cream cheese and it was plenty rich for us.  There are only three of us in our family and there were barely any leftovers.  I think that speaks for itself!

I enjoyed this easy recipe very much! I definitely did not add in all the cream cheese, however, as it would have been way too rich. I only added 2 tablespoons for the whole batch. I also added 1 cup of apple cider to the soup and used chicken broth. Before serving, I sprinkled some ground cloves on top for garnish. It was delicious and I froze the leftovers. Thanks for sharing!

WOW!  This was a huge hit.  Most people turned their nose up when I said butternut squash but after tasting, the group talked about it the rest of the night.  Dynomite recipe.  Very warm and cozy for those chilling evenings.  TRY THIS, YOU WILL LIKE!

I have done the butternut squash soup recipe. I used vegetable broth, A vegan brand of cream cheese, and vegan margarine, and topped it with a spoonful of vegan sour cream. delicious, an excellent recipe.

This recipe is amazing. I've made it many times and EVERYONE asks for the recipe. I roast the squash face-down in a 350 degree oven until it's soft enough to be poked with a fork. Then I let it cook and peel. It's much easier this way and the flavor is more intense! I also add a few chopped cloves of garlic when sautéing the onions, double all the spices, and use only 1 package cream cheese. This is a winner every time!

Called for WAY to much cream cheese!  Made it more like a sauce than a soup.  Had to cut it with more broth.  On the up side...I did like the seasoning choices and have go on to use them in my own recipe for Butternut Squash soup.

First time to even eat butternut squash soup.  Loved it!  Sweet and hearty with a slight bite.  I did take the advice of many and went with half the cream cheese.  It was almost too rich with 1 package, I can't imagine 2 packages.  Edit/add: After making this multiple times now, I think the key is making sure you have enough liquid to start, and to make sure you catch it at the right time.  You want to boil the squash until it's breaking down, but not turning into a paste.

I made this recipe AS DIRECTED, no changes.  It's easy and very tasty.  I use the pre-peeled butternut squash halves from the store, saves so much time.  My kids love it & have no idea how good it is for them.  I'd like to try the Butternut Squash Soup II on this site as well, it looks great.

It is possible that I don't like squash soup, but I wanted it to be more flavorful.  I even added some apple.  Perhaps will try something with more spices next time.

This was good, I only had half the cream cheese, and no cayanne, but I added butter and milk, paprika and a a few ounces of vegatable cream cheese. It was very tasty!

OUTSTANDING!!  I had an excess of spaghetti squash from the garden and used that instead of butternut.  I think any winter squash would produce an excellent soup with this recipe.  The only variance from the recipe was using just 1 package of cream cheese as others suggested....and it was the reduced fat version.  It was still very creamy and very flavorful for so few ingredients.  This is better than restaurant quality!

Serve with hot Parmesan rolls or garlic bread sticks (homemade of course)
8oz of cream cheese is PLENTY! 4C chicken stock is just right. Can add some mashed potato flakes if soup is too thin. (Don't over do it..it takes a minute for the potato to absorb the moisture) Use a stick blender to puree right in the pot. (No burned fingers or lid exploding like in blender) Puree is a must for creamy texture. You can substitute any kind of winter squash or pumpkin

So yummy! I'd already made 30 trips to the store this weekend, and was out of cream cheese... so I used the Laughing Cow cream cheese flavored wedges and it was still DELICIOUS! And super simple. (:

Think it's great! I used chicken stock instead of water + bouillon cubes and halved the cream cheese. I think I added too much cayenne, but still yummy with the extra heat. The soup thickens quickly once it sets.

I like this recipe. I tried it out for the first time today and it was easy to make. I added a bit more cayenne pepper than the recipe called for to give it a spicy kick. My girlfriend loved it.

What a hearty, rich and creamy soup!!! This will certainly be a winter staple this season.  I used a 32oz package of chicken broth instead of the bullion cubes and water and it tastes like a dream!!!!

Its a delicious soup, so fitting during the fall season...The only changes I made was adding a granny smith apple and I roasted the squash as well as the onion in the oven with garlic, salt pepper, and olive oil....very good! My husband raved about it and my 9 month old ate it all up!

The spice and thickness of this soup was really good. I didn't add any salt or pepper, and I doubled everything (2 squash, 2 carrots, 1 onion, twice the stock, twice the spices), and only used 1 package of cream cheese. I also baked the squash for 40 min at 350 after poking a few holes in them. Really yummy- would have given it 5 if already included my changes :).

This was very simple to make.  I made a few changes.  No Marjoram, so used Garham Marsala, and used Chipolte powder instead of cayenne.  Also roasted cut side down brushed with olive oil for an hour.  Fabulous soup, hubby loved it too!

This is one of my very favorite recipes! I add a clove or two of garlic to the onion, cut the cream cheese in half and substitute heavy cream for the rest. I always get rave reviews! Thanks!

A good solid soup. I made it as the recipe stands and I think it maybe a tad too salty and too cream cheesey. I think next time I will reduce the number of bouillon cubes and use half and half instead of cream cheese and see how it turns out. Tastes excellent with saltine bits broken up into it.

Very tasty!!  Based on other reviews I roasted the squash first, cut the cream cheese in half and used twice as much cayenne.

I have made this twice.  Both were amazing.  Second time was easier because I simply baked the squash (cut open, remove seeds and place flesh-side down on aluminum foiled pan) for an hour.  I sauteed onion, boiled the water then combined all with the squash and seasonings.   I pureed with little hand-held blender.   So easy!  The flavor is incredible; I added heavy cream because I am out of cream cheese.

Anyone who I serve this soup to, loves it and wants the recipe. Sometimes I add a littleless cream cheese to thin it up a little. It is delicious.

This was so delicious! few changes however. I only put in 1/2 package of cream cheese...it really doesn't need more than that! i also added a little more onion and doubled the cayenne pepper. the only thing i would do for next time would be to buy butternut squash that is already cubed just to save time. i get home from work real late and also wanted to make a salad and bread. im a new cooker too so i was amazed how well this turned out knowing im no expert!
Can't imagine anything better.

I used four boxes of frozen squash instead of fresh and it was delicious! I thawed the frozen squash in the microwave for four minutes, stirred and added six bouillon cubes and water and microwaved for four more minutes. Then followed recipe as directed from step two. I did add a tsp of salt. Absolutely delicious! Everyone LOVED it! Will definitely make again using frozen squash.

My husband loved it but I didn't as much. Maybe because it was too thick. I would need to double the liquid next time.

This is good, but like another reviewer mentioned. I only added about two tablespoons of cream cheese. And I used 3cups of chicken broth instead of bullion.

I agree with many of the comments that it needs a little something extra.  I added ginger, chili powder and garlic.  I could not imagine putting two bricks of cream cheese in though.  It was plenty thick with one.

Absolutely the best Butternut Squash soup I've had anywhere!  The ONLY change I made was reduced the cream cheese by half and used Neufachatel instead of full fat cream cheese.  SO easy and SO delicious.

Absolutely wonderful flavor. I only used 1/2 the cream cheese and it was excellent. I took the suggestion of microwaving the squash and don't think I will do that again. Too hot to handle and  messy. Maybe if I did it ahead and allowed it to cool before scooping out? Anyway a definite soup favorite in this house. Thank Mary.

Followed the recommendation to cut the cream cheese in half; otherwise made no alterations.  The soup is really good but I think 4oz is still too much cream cheese.  I'll make it again but try adding carrots and cinnamon.

This turned out WAY too thick for our tastes.  Definitely use half or less of the cream cheese.

UPDATE: I decided to give it another try and I made it according to the suggestions that @SLJ6 gave in their review.  It helped, but the soup still ended up being meh.  I added in a generous amount of brown sugar which seemed to help, but it still seems like it's missing something.  I've seen another recipe for a butternut soup with crab meat, and I think that might give this soup the counterpoint of taste that it needs to be really good.

I like many reviewers roasted the squash in the oven first. Cut in half and roasted with cut side down on a greased baking sheet for about 40 min at 375. Cut down the cream cheese. I've added red peppers (sauteed with the onions) to the soup as well.

I have never made butternut squash soup before, but had a squash sitting around, so I decided to give it a whirl.  I was not terribly impressed while eating it...until I looked around online and found that some people add balsamic vinegar to theirs.  So I put a dash in my bowl and a miracle occurred!

In short - balsamic vinegar will take this soup from okay to great!

roasted the squash at 375 for 45 mins. (as was  suggested by others), didn't use any cream cheese but did add a generous splash of whipping cream and apple cider. This soup was amazing! My husband (the critic) declared it the "best he'd ever tasted".

Truly delicious! Definitely use chicken stock and 1 cream cheese. Tried the hand mixer but the mixture wasn't creamy enough for me so I put it in the blender and it was perfect. A must try and a new staple in our home.

I make about 3 batches of this each fall. It is so delicious. I also cut the cream cheese amount in about half. I look forward to it every year.

OMG!!! Delicous!!! I've never made a squash soup before and the hubby HATES squash. I made this for the family and the ATE IT UP! This was absolutly amazing. I did however add a little more bouillon to take away some of the sweet taste and only used 1 package of reduced fate cream cheese..... I WILL MAKE THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN!

I HATE squash and last year our pastor's wife gave me a sample of the soup.  I did not have the heart to tell her I would not eat it because I hate squash so I took it and put it in my freezer with no plans to eat it.  Then one day, out of groceries and needing a lunch for work, I packed it.  I heated it up at lunch making faces at the soup and then tasted it.  It was SOOOOOO YUMMY!!!!  This seriously is now one of my all time favorite soups and I HATE SQUASH!!!  I only use 1 block of reduced fat cream cheese and 3 TBL of butter instead of the margarine but it turns out perfect every time!!!  Highly recommend this recipe!!!!

Amazing. I didn't have marjoram or cayenne pepper, and instead of butternut squash, I used yellow squash. I only used 1 package of cream cheese.  It was soooo yummy.

Great tasting recipe! Since I'm vegan I used vegetable broth instead of chicken bouillon. I left out the onion and used Italian seasoning (so I wouldn't have to buy the marjoram). I blended the sour cream into the mixture one tablespoon at a time until I got the creamy taste that was right for me. Delicious!!! Did not take long for the butternut squash to soften when boiled.

I was skeptical when i read this recipe but decided to try it anyway.  So glad I did, this is my new favorite soup.  My only complaint?  It is almost impossible to stop eating it! I roasted the squash 1st (also toasted the seeds for a snack) and added a couple shakes of nutmeg.  Have given the recipe to friends and they too loveit.

What a nice comforting soup for a day when our high temperature was 10.  I did change the method while keeping the ingredients the same.  Having never worked with butternut squash before, I took some other reviewers' recommendations and roasted it first.  Then I put the squash and cooked onion with some of the broth into the blender.  I put all of the blended squash in my slow cooker and added 1/2 the cream cheese.  The cheese melted right in, and I let the soup cook on low for about 6 hours.  It was fabulous - rich and creamy and delicious.

I just made this soup and I literally can NOT stop eating it!  I am so impressed with how easy it was to make yet it tastes like a gourmet soup.  I used 1 pkg. of cream cheese and 2 chicken bouillon cubes (because that's all I had).

I made this soup for my best friend's birthday dinner and it was delicious! The best tips I picked up on this website were to cook the squash, halves face down, in a cake pan with an inch of water at 350 for 1 hour. I then used an ice cream scooper to scoop the squash out and added it to the blender with the cream cheese and chicken broth. I was already sauteing the onion in butter in a saucepan and so it was easy to puree the squash mixture in the blender and then pour it into the pot with the onions and heat through. This reminded me of a soup I used to order at Wolfgang Puck! I highly recommend this one on a cold fall night!

I like texture in my soup, so I blended the squash and the cream cheese (only 8 oz) then added it to the onion mixture, then added the broth and spices.  I really enjoyed this soup, but still tasted cheese more than squash, I may use even less cream cheese next time.

My husband and I don't particularly like squash or soup but oh my, this was delicious.  This recipe is one of the best I've tried from this site.  I used kabocha squash, which has a milder flavor than butternut and is supposed to be excellent for soup.  I roasted the squash before finding this recipe so I didn't follow the recipe exactly.  I added the frozen pureed squash and let it simmer until it thawed.  I whipped the cream cheese on its own and then whisked it into the soup.  I also used veggie bullion to make it vegetarian.

Delicious!  I used only 4 0z cream cheese as I am counting calories.  I added a touch of nutmeg and orange zest.  I used boxed chicken broth with low sodium.  I felt I did not sacrifice flavor to make it a bit healthier.

I have a tendancy to stay away from bullion so I use organic free range chicken broth, 3 cups and use a packet of Crocks Spicy Soup mix and remove the onions prior to puree. No cream cheese needed.

Delicious! I was hesitant, since being in the fall season I was on pumpkin/squash overload. But the cream cheese made it! I only had one package of cream cheese and it made it very rich and creamy. Perfect! It did change the taste a little bit, but in a good way (I was tired of the squash taste) I used only one squash and it made enough for 4 people with leftovers. Served with these little turkey meatloaf stacks from Trader Joes. I would make this again

LOVE this soup, made it twice, once with butternut and once with hubbard.  Excellent taste, easy to make and easy on the budget too!  I made it as written and wouldn't change a thing!

Delicious soup! My husband dislikes squash of any kinds prepared any way. When he asked what I was making, I stated "Soup...would you like to try?" He took a small spoonful and said "That is really good." I did not change the recipe other than using only one 8oz cream cheese.

I thought this recipe was great.  It was very easy to make and it was very tasty.  I did roast the squash in the oven for 50 minutes at 350, and I only used a 1/2 a package of cream cheese, but it turned out wonderful!! This is a soup I will make again and again. Thank you

Added some carrots and celery to the squash and roasted in oven at 400 for approx 40 min. Also used a whole onion and chicken stock (from a box.) Used 1/2 the cream cheese and added extra chicken stock until I got the desired thickness. IT WAS DELICIOUS!

I am 52 years old and this is the first time I ever cooked a butternut squash and I have to say I had my doubts. My husband and I were blown away with the savory flavors. I must have used a very big squash because it was like mashed potatoes but we loved it anyway!

The soup is one of the soups where after you taste the final result, you say outloud, "I made this??" It is delicious! I did use 1/2 the cream cheese, used some nutmeg bc/ I didn't have any cayenne pepper, and used 1/2 apple cider instead of water.

Great soup!  I like things easy, so I pealed and cubed a butternut squash put it in a large (glass) pot added a small chopped onion with a couple of cloves of crushed garlic.  Almost covered with some chicken stock, then into the microwave until the squash is tender (about 12 minutes).  I then added the spices, a little brown sugar about 4 oz. of cream cheese and a little half & half then hit it with my immersion blender until smooth.  It was done in no time and to rave reviews.

I have this recipe in my recipe box at home--it's the ONLY one I use! This soup is so good and so addictive!  I didn't change a thing.  Bought 2 large butternut squash today & will be making this soup tonight.  DEFINITELY, prepare your squash by slicing down the middle, turning cut side down on a sprayed pan and BAKE for an hour at 350 until fully roasted.  I can just taste it now. .  . :-)  Yummy and so good for you!

I made 1 1/2 recipes and used 2 8 oz fat free cream cheese. I also added nutmeg and extra cayenne pepper.  It was good and creamy and my family wants to know when we can have it again.

I would give this recipe five stars, but I changed it slightly, so I can't give it a true review. I also roasted the squash first as others had. I used three medium sized squash and that was just enough. I also used only one 8oz package of cream cheese and it was plenty creamy. I cannot imagine using two - it would be way too rich, in my opinion. I also used real butter and low fat cheese and chicken stock, rather than bouillon. It was perfect for fall and squash season.

Extremely easy and delicious.  My only addition was 1/2 cup of brown sugar.  I felt this was needed to balance the cayenne pepper.

I roasted the squash (pierced with fork, on cookie sheet in 400 oven for 1hr), pulled off skin, scooped out seeds, and then put the "meat" in the blender with all the other ingredients but just 4oz cream cheese. Delicious! Everyone raved about it. I highly recommend it.

I added to much onion but this dish still came out rather good. I think it could almost go without the onion and bacon. My daughter loved it and ate most of it which is impressive because she is 2 years old and usually hates stuff like this. I almost wanted to add creamcheese instead of more flour to the base of the soup but I decided not too. I almost wanted to also add some brown sugar because I think that would have really added a punch of flavor. For this recipe I baked the buttnut squash with butter and brown sugar in the middle of the squash and to cut the squash I did as one reviewer suggested and microwaved the squash for five minutes in water before cutting overall great recipe!

Holy moly! This was absolutely delicious.  I did cut the cream cheese by half, but kept everything else the same.  It was a hit at Thanksgiving this year and quick to make.  I then made it again, but this time no real measuring, just using up the remaining of what I had, and it was still excellent.  Even my 2 year old kept asking for more.  Her cousin also 2 years old had three bowls of it and then couldn't eat the turkey! LOL

I was skeptical of a soup that used bouillon instead of broth, but this was delicious.  I used butter instead of margarine and only 4oz. of cream cheese, and my husband and  2 and 4 year olds loved it.

Fabulous soup!  I did as others suggested and roasted the squash for about 40 minutes in a 350 degree oven.  I used about 2/3 the cream cheese called for and doubled the cayenne.  It gave it just enough kick to notice it was there.  Everyone, even the picky guys thought it was fantastic.  I will definitely be making this again.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was fantastic! I followed some of the other reviewers comments and roast the squash first,  only added one 8 oz pkg of cream cheese, still amazing! I also didn't have marjoram, so I used Italian seasoning, MMMMM!

I totally agree that roasting the squash works better. I also put a bottle of wit beer in the soup to add a slightly fruity flavor.  Love the soup!

SOOO good.  I agree with most people - only use one package of cream cheese, though.

delicious! I did make some changes: 1. roast the squash with 4 cloves of garlic and a drizzle of olive oil at 350 for an hour 2. cut the margarine to 2 tbsp 3. you really only need 1 package of cream cheese and use the 1/3 fat version I had never used a butternut squash before.

I loved this soup! My family really loved it, too. My son said it was the best soup ever! I did change a few things because of other reviewers' comments including roasting the squash for an hour, cutting back to 1/2 package of cream cheese (a little less would be even better), skipping the marjoram, and adding fresh nutmeg. A keeper for sure!

I did tweak this recipe a bit-  I used only 1 block of cream cheese, added 3/4-1 cup heavy cream, 1 tsp. more marjoram, 1 tsp. savory and I used cxn stock instead of water.  I also roasted the squash first as others suggested.  It was delish!  Very thick and definitely for a cold day!

This is not what I was looking for. I thought it was on the sweet side rather than the hearty side. My family liked it ok but I will look for another recipe. I even halved the cream cheese and added haf and half.

Quite good, although I altered the recipe somewhat, so I'm not sure if it still counts as the same recipe... Like many other commenters, I roasted the squash rather than boiling it. I also used 8 oz. of some homemade herbed cream cheese I had. It had thyme in it, so I let that stand in for the marjoram. Basically, any combo of squash, broth, and cream put through the blender is going to be pretty tasty though. :-)

This is part of my regular rotation of soups. I love the slight zip you get from the cayenne. I use only one package of cream cheese and find that's plenty to make it creamy.  I also slice & bake the squash, then scoop it out and cook with the rest of the ingredients. I get an allergic reaction to touching the squash that makes it hard to peel and slice. But baking seems to work as well without changing the flavor.

FANTASTIC! Used two butternuts from my garden... Like many others, I roasted the squash in the oven for about 45 mins at 350.  I ran out of time, and stored the cooked squash overnight in the fridge. The next day, I sauteed the onions in a dutch oven then put them in a large bowl with the squash and all its juices, and the bouillon (I used Emeril's, as I love it). I used a hand blender to puree. I then added only ONE package of whipped cream cheese. I returned everything to the dutch oven and seasoned with black pepper and a few grates of fresh nutmeg. Did not use cayenne - personal preference. It was rich, thick and delish - loved by all, and reheated beautifully. Thanks for this recipe - I will make this many, many times in the days ahead!

Amazing! My husband said " it tastes like Fall". I too roasted the squash before. Also I added a grated clove of garlic with the sauteed onions, 1/2 tsp of Cayenne, 2 dashes of cinnamon and 1 dash of ground cloves. I also put in half of the cream cheese as was recommended. It was awesome!

I would have never thought to put cream cheese in butternut squash soup, but this was one of the best butternut squash recipes I've ever tried!  The only difference I made was to use sage instead of the marjoram.  I made this for my book club last night and everyone raved and asked for the recipe.  Definitely a keeper!

I doubled the recipe because I had a large squash and wanted to use the whole thing.  I didn't double the cream cheese.  I only used the cream cheese that the original recipe called for.  This was an absolutely delicious soup.  My family loved it.

The best soup I've ever made! I used chicken stock instead of bouillon and used half (even less than half, actually) of the cream cheese this called for. I also roasted the squash before I added it. I couldn't get enough of it and will make it all fall and winter! Wonderful, wonderful recipe!

Tons of different variations to this soup. This recipe works well w/o cream cheese and marjoram.  I also followed other reviews and baked the butternut (brushed with olive oil/garlic) for an hour at 350. Serve with some homemade toasted bread. Great warm meal for a cold fall night!

This is a great base recipe for those of us who need a starting point.  For a delicious twist, substitute the marjoram and cayenne with a bay leaf and curry to taste.  I'm making a pot right now using a hubbard squash I inherited.

Made this tonight - very delicious! I used 3/8 tsp cayenne and 1/4 tsp cinnamon. I also substituted oregano because I didn't have marjoram. I used 8oz. Cream cheese but will probably cut it to 4oz. next time. The soup got a bit thick toward the end of a bowl. Also we crushed plenty of Ritz crackers into it. So yummy!

Doctored up and it was delicious!! Rich but delicious! I took bits and pieces of other reviewers suggestions when I made this.  I used one medium squash and one sweet potato.  Both which I baked @ 375 for about an hour with olive oil, salt, garlic and about an inch of water in the pan. The rest was according to the recipe except I did use only one cream cheese package.  It has a richness that made me only want one bowl but very soothing on a rainy fall day!

I just made this to go with a fall fish fry and it was a hit. I only used 1 pkg of cream cheese and added 1 cup of heavy whipping cream.  I also used about 3 cups of broth and some water and one whole onion, roasted all the onion and squash as suggested in other reviews.  I added chives and a little extra cream to top it off.

FANTASTIC!!!  But I docked it a star because as almost every other reviewer noted it calls for entirely too much cream cheese... I just did one brick.  Pre-Roasted the squash as others did and this made it so much easier to peel and slice.  Made with vegetable base and needed more liquids, but I think my squash was more than 6 cups (it was around 6 pounds).  Tried to "cheat" and just use a hand mixer in the pot, but that wasn't cutting it so I did have to blend in batches as directed which was somewhat labor intensive and MESSY.  Will definitely make again and experiment with making it further ahead of time, and even freezing it.  My mom suggested tweaking it with curry, which would be a very nice acompaniment to an Indian meal.  Next time I'll serve it with a swirl of sour cream or creme fraische and drops of herbed oil like they do at fancy restaurants =)

AWESOME! I roasted the squash with olive oil, s,p, and garlic for about 1:15 at about 375. Only used 1 block cream cheese, 1/3 less fat cream cheese. And used 2 cups water, 3 cubes bouillion. Used 1 squash.

So SO YUMMY!!!  I have never made Butternut squash soup before-or even cooked a butternut squash.  But this recipe was so EASY and so YUMMY!  I did as others had and roasted the butternut squash before and I also only used one package of cream cheese.  Thank you so much for this recipe!

Excellent!  As other reviewers noted, 1/2 of the cream cheese is plenty, and I thinned the soup down a bit with more chicken stock.  It was a HUGE hit!

Great soup to use up my abundance of garden butternut squash!  I roasted the squash with olive oil as others did and I feel this adds greatly to the soups flavor.  I added 3 cloves of garlic in with the onions and a couple stalks of celery.  I had no marjoram, so I substituted sage, which adds a surprisingly good taste.  Left out the cayenne altogether. I did as others and used 3/4 of a pack of cream cheese (1/3 fat).  As the squash was well roasted, it fell apart in the cooking process, so I did not puree it, so it had more texture.  As a vegetarian I also used vegi broth.  Next day the flavors melded wonderfully when we had it as leftovers.  This is a keeper.

Great recipe but I made several changes. Butter instead of margarine, almost doubled the squash, used half the cream cheese, chicken broth instead of water/chicken boullion and added more cayenne, pepper, marjoram and a pich of salt. My family loved it.

I loved it, kids thought it was too spicy with the Cayenne Pepper (oh well I thought it was great!). I might do a batch someday without it....just white pepper instead.

I just made this and it was so simple. I followed other reviewers advice and roasted the squash first, then followed the recipe as directed. I didnt have any marjoram, so I used a little oregano. Its a very good, rich soup. I am not too crazy about the cayenne flavor, but other than that, I will be making this again. Thanks!

This recipe is amazing! It was my first attempt cooking butternut squash and now I want to make this every week. I did omit the cream cheese because it tasted fantastic without it.

This soup is perfect for the fall and absolutely delicious!! :-) I substituted marjoram for dried oregano & red pepper flakes for cayenne pepper. I cut the cream cheese in half and it was a nice balance, not too rich.

This soup is absolutely delicious.  I pretty much followed the instructions, but found it slightly bland, so I increased the marjoram to 1 tsp, and added about 1/2 tsp. of onion salt.  I also found that 1 & 1/2 pkgs. of cream cheese was enough.  A great consistency, and wonderful flavor.  Can't wait to eat dinner tonight :)

This was amazing!  Relatively easy to make and so darn good.  I used only 1 1/2 cream cheese squares and did not measure the cayenne so may have added more than it called for.  It had a spicy kick at the end but not the kind of hot where you drink endless amounts of water while eating  it.   Next time I will add more water as it got a little thick as it cooled.  Will definitely make this again.  My kids even liked it!  Such a nice fall/winter meal.

Super yummy!  After following the recipe, more or less, I thought it was a little bland then added too much black pepper.  Too much for my little guys, but I still loved it.  Next time will let people add their own add'l seasoning.

Everyone loves this soup! We make it a meal with some fresh sourdough bread. Definitely roast the squash to make peeling and cubing possible.

SOOOO Good!  I experimented with this soup with my mom and my husband and we all indulged in just 3/4 cup each and it was not only delicious but was very rich and filling!  We all kept rolling it around in our mouths and commenting on the flavors.  The red pepper leaves a slight spice in the back of your throat, but it is great.  I followed the recipe exactly and made no changes.  It is a pretty soup that can be garnished with many things like green onion, bacon bits, or thyme.  I've never used Marjoram before, but now I will be trying it in other dishes since it was so good.  My mom hates butternut squash, but loved this soup!  We all agree that this would be a good starter soup to a pork, turkey or roast.  It's very rich, so you only need to serve about 1/2 to 3/4 cup per person.

Very easy to make, especially after following the advice of other cooks on here to roast the halved squash in the oven first for an hour at 350 degrees. I only used 4 ounces of cream cheese, and it was plenty. I did not have cayenne pepper on hand so I substituted chili powder and a little bit of crushed red pepper. I added some porcini mushroomand thyme ravilois after cooking and it was so yummy!

It's my first time cooking with butternut squash and I have to say that I joined just so I can write this review! It was wonderful! My fiance loved it! I cut the squash in half and scraped out the seeds, drizzled some olive oil and sprinkled some salt, then baked them, upside down for 45 mins at 180°C. I added just 3 bouillon cubes since the ones we get here seem large, and 1.5 of the cream cheese and 1/4 t of cayenne.  Next time, I plan to use 1 package of cream cheese, and 2 bouillon cubes. I plan on including this into my Thanksgiving menu this year!

This soup was absolutely FABULOUS!!!!  I couldn't believe that I made something that tasted like it came from a 5 star restaurant!  It is super easy.  I didn't have any marjoram handy so I just substituted a little cinnamon and nutmeg...not much.  I am so glad I found this.  I will be making it for years to come.  My extended family thought it was outa this world, and coming from my dad, being a restaurant owner, that is a big thing!!

Very good, definitely a keeper. I used half the amount of cream cheese as other reviewers suggested. Also used oregano instead of marjoram as that is what I have on hand.

This was a very easy soup to put together, like others I too roasted the squash prior to assembly. I only used half the suggested amount of cream cheese, and I think a person could omit it entirely if they didn't have it on hand. I added a teaspoon of curry powder to the soup as well, as I like the added heat and thought it balanced the richness a little better. Overall a really great and rewarding recipe

This soup was absolutely awesome, and I'm generally not a fan of squash. It's creamy and rich with just a hint of heat. Great for those days you just want to be a home body. I added a fourth of cayenne instead of an eighth tsp. The recipe makes a large quantity of soup, and there is only two of us. Unfortunately we didn't get through it all. I'm going to try freezing it next time.

Made it the second time tonight and it is even better than the first.  Only change was the amount of cream cheese (1/2 the amount per the suggestion of many).

Love this Recipe!  My husband will tell you its the reason he asked me out.  I do some things different.  I cut the squash in half, rub it with olive oil and roast it until it's tender.  I use chicken stalk in place of bouillon and water, real butter, 1 teaspoon of cayenne and only 1 package of cream cheese.  I make this soup every fall.

The best soup ever! I had never made squash soup before, and my husband was very skeptical, but he was crazy about it. I only added one pkg of cream cheese, and it was rich and delicious.

This was my first time eating butternut squash soup (and I think butternut squash in general) and I found out it just wasn't for me! Too sweet or something I think. However, my boyfriend gives this recipe 5 stars and ate his portion as well as the rest of mine :)

I veganized this soup.  It was a little thick so next time I will add more liquid.  I used a low sodium vegetarian bouillon and vegan cream cheese.   Absolutely delicious.  Such a treat that I can invite my vegan friends over for butternut squash soup.  I used a mixture of butternut squash, turnip and yam believe it or not and is wonderful.  I got this at Trader Joes and tried the soup.  It's a real winner.

I followed the recipe and the soup had a paste-like consistency and a very strange, sweet flavor.  I expected it to have a a smooth, rich flavor.  It was inedible.  What did I do wrong?

I've made this soup twice now. The first time, exactly as specified. It was good, but I felt like there could've been another layer of flavor added. Tonight, I tweaked it a little and WOW! What a difference. My husband loved it so much, there wasn't any left over to freeze this time.
First of all, let me say that I halved the recipe as there are only two of us - it still comes out beautifully.
Here's what I did:
After sauteeing the onions in (real) butter, deglaze the pot with 1/2c. white wine. I substituted Herbs de Provenc for the marjoram and I roasted the squash.
The biggest difference is that I added about 2Tbl honey to the soup after it was blended. It adds a subtle sweetness that compliments the soup without making it sweet, and I grated fresh nutmeg over the top of the bowls before serving.     
What a lovely soup on a cold, rainy fall day. I will definately make this again.

I loved this recipe but as always tweeked it a bit by adding some curry powder, salt, nutmeg and about a cup of Greek yogurt...the yogurt gives it a zing because I felt it was just too smooth and I wanted a contrast to the sweet of the squash.  I plan on changing this recipe a little each time just to see what progresses...maybe next time with beets and spinach?

So satisfying.  I followed other reviewers and used about half the suggested cream cheese.  I also added an apple, cinnamon, and nutmeg.  Before serving I drizzled with cream and toasted coconut...YUM to say the least, thanks!

Delicious!! I used 4 cups of water instead of 3, a bit more marjoram, 1/4 tsp cayenne, and 1/2 package of 1/3 less fat cream cheese. And butter instead of margarine. It is sooo good! I might even use a little less cream cheese next time or a little less better. As I saw in another review, 6 cups of butternut squash is roughly equal to 2 lbs.

My husband was very impressed with this recipe...which, in turn, impressed me! The only change we made was adding garlic. It was delicious, but a little bit goes a long way because it is so rich and flavorful. I wouldn't serve this as an entree, but rather in small bowls for a starter so you don't get burned out on it half way through your meal.

I have rated this before but I have now made this many,many times and it is requested often. I use one whole squash (large) and only one cream cheese. The cayenne is what I love, we love the kick this gives.
When making ahead , remember to add some more broth or water as this thickens up quite a bit.
This is a healthy and delicious soup!

Very good.  Only four stars because I cannot even imagine what it would have tasted like with 2 packages of cream cheese.  I used only 4 ounces and still though it was too much.  Next time I will use less, or use none, and just garnish each bowl with a dollop of cream cheese.

Love this soup!!! I've made this many times now for friends and family and get rave reviews. The flavor is amazing. Only a couple of minor alterations - I use half of the cream cheese (fat free). Try adding a little nutmeg and sprinkle of sugar (I used Stevia). WOW!

Had a nice taste with the changes I made.  I used chicken stock versus bouillon and water.  I added 2 sliced apples.  Since I didn't have morjoram I used allspice.  And used 1 8 ounce package of low fat cream cheese.  Soup was good.  But I used the leftovers as a sauce over rigatoni pasta and that was DELICIOUS!  Thanks for sharing.

Yum!  However I did take the recommendations of several others.  I roasted the squash...reduced the cream cheese...and added milk.  Then.....I added some garlic and roasted chicken...the chicken really finsihed it off!!!  Definitely a wonderful combination of flavors....so creamy and delicious!!!

I made this for friends and there were lots of moans and groans while they ate. Said it was the best butternut squash soup they ever tasted. The second time I halved the cream cheese and it was much more balanced. I haven't tried roasting the squash first but am looking forward to that.

WARNING!!  THIS SOUP IS HABIT FORMING.  This recipe is incredible.  I as many, roasted the squash in the oven first.  I also used only half the cream cheese.  While I was making it, my 12 year old son kept saying, "I won't like it".  He now says it is the best thing I have ever made, after my burgers of course.  Also, don't think of this recipe as only a soup.  We have found it makes an excellent sauce also.  Use the leftovers to pour over other items.  I made omlettes the day after the soup and my wife immediately poured some soup over it.  It was quite delicious.  

I have now made it 3 weeks running.  And the family still wants more.  Use it for Eggs Benedict in place of the Hollandaise.  Delicious

This soup makes me feel like I'm eating in a restaurant each time I make it. I prefer using pre-cut squash to save time. 2LBs is about 6 cups. I add an apple, and use 2 - 14.5oz cans of low sodium, fat free broth. I also reduce the cream cheese to 4-6 ounces. My kids don't like spicy, my 1st born likes nutmeg in his, and DH likes Hot Madras Curry in his, so I put those and cayenne on the side. I serve with French bread (tried sourdough, and we feel it's too tangy for this soup). Thanks for the keeper!

My husband is willing to try anything, but is very selective with his feedback.  He literally said, "this is the best soup I have ever tasted," after the first few bites.    I followed recipe for the most part but used only about 6 oz of cream cheese (rather than 16 oz), and substituted a vegetable bouillon (without MSG or other preservatives) for the chicken bouillon.  The VitaMix blender was awesome to puree, and all I can say is that it was phenomenal.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Everyone that tried this just loved it, just the right kick.  Didn't use as much cream cheese as the recipe called for.

I always add 1 tsp. of garam masala (not spicy) curry and 1/2 tsp of regular (spicy) curry to the onions just in the last 2 or 3 minutes.  It's just spicy enough for me and the kids. I also occasionally throw in 10-13 cheese ravioli's, just to make it go a little further.  Def. in the heavy rotation!

Excellent recipe!! I put the squash in the oven at 400 for about 30 mins to soften it up a bit. Then I put it in the food processor to chop it up before putting it in the pan with the onions.  I had no marjarom, so I substituted it with oregano. I only used half the recommended amount of cream cheese.  I thought it was a really tasty and easy recipe and I will definitley make this again!

I followed previous reviewers advice and 1) roasted the squash cubes first (with olive oil, s&p) and 2) used less cream cheese (4oz instead of 16oz).  Soup was slightly sweet with a strange consistency - it reminded me of liquid sweet potato pie.

This was not for me. There was way too much cream cheese, It actually overpowered the flavor of the squash. My boyfriend said it reminded him of the texture of nacho cheese, which it did. I would bypass this recipe if I were you.

I used half the cream cheese, neufchatel style, and added 1/2 cup of dry reisling, and a teaspoon of curry powder. Then let it marry for an hour.  It was even better the next day.

Everyone loved this when I made it. I used 2 whole butternut squashes and when it came time to add in the block of cream cheese it worked well with the blending, but because it wasn't a thick enough soup for me, I tried to add more cream cheese, this time the container kind. I ended up with chunks of white speckles. But it was still phenomenal.

Highly recommended. I halved the amount of cream cheese and omitted the cayenne pepper. For us, I'd also reduce the amount of pepper, but I'm not a fan of black pepper. Very creamy, sort of frothy, delicious!

This is a real comfprt food and hard to mess up!  I have already made it twice since finding the recipe a week ago.  It is smooh and creamy and very satisfying.  I used only one package of cream cheese because I thought I would loose the taste of the squash.  One package was more than enough.  The cayenne pepper makes it a little hot for those who don't like any heat.  (You may want to leave it out.)  For those who like heat, you will bearly notice it and want to add more.  (Like my husband.)   Personally, I thought it was just right.

This soup was the hit of my thanksgiving dinner!  I made it just as the recipe suggests, and we loved it.  I didn't expect it to be so spicy, but it was great!  The recipe makes a lot of leftovers, but we're looking forward to them.

This is was so yummy.  I roasted the butternut like others suggested with butter, salt and pepper at 350 for 1 hr.  I also used 4 cups chicken broth instead of water/bullion cubes.  I also only did one cream cheese, and I added a couple of dashes of nutmeg.  So good.!

Wonderful soup! I just roasted the squash in the oven first for 45 mins, the followed the recipe. I reduced the cream cheese a little, but think it would be good either way. I added cooked bacon and sour cream on top. YUMMMYYYY!!! This is a keeper!

I roasted the squash in the oven like other reviewers had suggested and it was super easy to skin and cube up to add to the soup. I also used vegetable stock to make it vegetarian and only added one package of cream cheese. (And some garlic. I put garlic in just about everything.) The first night it was kind of bland, so next time I'll either add more spices or simmer spices in the vegetable stock while the squash roasts. I also felt like it was a bit too thick, so next time I'll halve the cream cheese. Or make it ahead of time. ANYWAY. The second day it was awesome! I added about a cup more broth and it's fantastic.

Simple and delicious!! I did make a few changes. I used 1 cup of cheddar cheese and 1/4 cup of cream because that was what I had on hand. Roasting the squash makes things a lot easiest and gives the soup a great flavor. The cayenne pepper is a surprising "must add"! :)

This is a great soup and love making it in the fall.  I peel and cube the squash and place in a crockpot with all ingredients except the cream cheese.  After squash is cooked I add the cream cheese, melt it and use a blender since I don't have a food processor. Yummy!

Perfect!  I didn't want to make a heavy soup with cream or cream cheese so this recipe fit the bill.  My family all loved it!  Added an apple and some apple juice for the perfect touch! Thanks!

This didn't have much taste to me aside from the cream cheese. I used less than half the required amount because I had tasted the soup prior to blending it with cream cheese and was concerned that the whole thing would just taste like cream cheese if I used it all.  I also added much more of the recommended spices towards the end of cooking the squash because it didn't taste like much.  Perhaps my squash wasn't fresh enough to add good flavor?  Not sure. I might try it again and re-rate, but for now it's a 2.

This was a huge surprize.  My husband and most of my kids don't like squash so when they heard what was for dinner I got a lot of flack.  They all loved it!  It was so amazing!  Now another wonderful way to use up my bumper crop of butternut squash that they will all eat!

This was very good... I was looking for an easy to prepare butternut squash soup and this fit the bill.  It does help to roast the squash first, makes the skin come off much easier... I followed the advice of using chicken stock and half the cream cheese and it was wonderful... I used my emusion blender to puree and this was ready in no time at all...

Great!  I used a little oregeno instead of the Marjoram.  I also added a chopped up apple and a little ginger.  It's a stick to your ribs fall/winter kind of thing.

Yummo!  I have never had or made butternut squash anything and this was very very good. I only used about a 1/4 of the cream cheese and tiny bit more cayenne and it was delish! Even my son who doesn't like any kind of squash liked it.

Delicious, thick and hearty soup!  I also roasted the squash first (much easier to peel that way in addition to giving it that roasted flavor) and used 1 pkg of cream cheese instead of 2.  Perfect!  I'll make this again fo sure.

DELICIOUS! Same changes as others suggested... roasting the squash (drizzled with olive oil and black pepper) in the oven first. They were perfect at 425 degrees for 45 minutes. I also only added one pkg of cream cheese. Best if served with a fresh loaf of bread.

Absolutely delicious!!!  My husband loved it so much and said it tasted like something you would find at a gourmet restaurant.  I also roasted the squash at 400 for 45 minutes before adding it in.

Fabulous!  As others suggested I roasted the squash first, did chicken stock instead of water/cubes and added 1/2 the amount of light cream cheese.  I also drizzled honey on the bowls and would've added a bit of granola w/ cinnamon in the bowl but didn't have any on hand.

This was incredible!!!  I've never made anything with butternut squash before so I did take some of the other reviewer's suggestions.  I halved the squash, brushed it with olive oil and then roasted it.  It was super easy to peel after that.  I added some garlic to the onion, used half the amount of cream cheese and left out the cayenne pepper.  It was perfect.

This soup is so wonderful and creamy.  I didnt alter the recipe at all!  It has a nice spicy kick to it.  I happen to love spicy food, however, if spicy food isnt your thing, I would suggest using a little less pepper.

This soup is a rarity on this site -- the recipe is nearly perfect as-is. The only changes truly are personal preference tweaks, but no changes are needed. I created a custom version (see custom tab) that incorporates the things I changed and is a generalized version for all winter squash. Basically I replaced margarine for butter, replaced cream cheese for Neufchatel + decreasing quantity by 1/2 and I added some cinnamon. Very minor!

Fantastic!  As others have suggested, I first roasted the squash on the oven at 375 degrees for 45 minutes.  That helped a lot.  I put twice the amount of cayenne pepper and it was JUST spicy enough.  Delicious!

I love this soup! I've made it at least six times. I roast the  squash for 20-25 minutes first and halve the cream cheese. I'm thinking it'll make a nice Thanksgiving day soup.

I made this last night, and was just a little disappointed. I used one package of cream cheese, but I used the Neufchatel cheese instead of full-fat cream cheese, and the soup isn't as creamy or rich as I was hoping for. Next time I'll just go for the fat. :)It WAS really easy to make, though, which was great. I roasted the squash in the oven for a while before peeling it and cutting it up, which made it easier. Thanks for the recipe!

This turned out way better than I had expected! I used two small squashes, and it made exactly 6 cubed cups. I used a hand blender to blend directly in the pot, and then decided to only use one block of cream cheese. It was PERFECT with just that.

Following it to the letter is pretty bland. It's a good base to start running with but I will need to doctor it up alot the next time.

Butternut squash is a favorite and I love soups. This was ok, but I've tried better recipes for this. Not thrilled with the cream cheese.

This soup is easy to make and was delicious!  I am going to take some other readers suggestions on reducing the cream cheese, it was very rich.  Otherwise, I could not get enough of this soup.  This recipe is fabulous.  Thanks!!!!!

One word: WOW! This recipe meets all of my criteria for 5 stars: easy, healthy, and delicious. I took some suggestions of other reviewers - I roasted the squash first (much easier that way), added less cream cheese (I didn't have the full amount on hand), and added more cayenne (love a little spice). I used a hand blender to puree. Thanks, Mary, this recipe rocks!!!

I only used one package of cream cheese, I felt two would've been overkill. This needed more flavor, garlic, more onions, maybe cilantro? I will try the other butternut squash soup recipes in an attempt to find the perfect recipe!

Delicious! Along with everyone else, I agree that one block of cream cheese was plenty.  I will probably use 4 oz next time. I  used 3 c. chicken stock with an additional large bullion cube.  I think it could have used more liquid since I prefer my soup to be a little less thick.  Seasonings were just right

loved it! i've made it numerous times. took the suggestions of other reviews. chopped up some celery, carrots, a granny smith apple and sauteed it with the onion. only added 4 oz of cream cheese and put in a little coconut milk. so soothing on a cold winter day.

Good with 1/4 of the cream cheese, better with 4 oz fresh goat cheese.  This is a very rich soup, a little too rich for a main course in my family.  Serve with crusty bread and greens.

To Die For!!! I made this last fall, and twice in the last week. Everyone raves over this soup. So good and rich. Smooth and creamy. Warms you up on fall nights. I follow the recipe exactly as written. I always use all the cream cheese. I plan on making this as a vegetarian option at my Halloween chili party this year. I will be making a double batch though, because I will guarantee you every non-veggie will want it too!! I use an immersion blender and blend it right in the pot. Velvety smooth. :)

Great soup! I roasted the squash as recommended by others. Since I was roasting the squash, I roasted a garlic bulb as well and put it in the soup with the squash. Used good quality chicken stock and only one package of cream cheese and it was phenomenal! I'm embarrassed to admit that I made it two days in a row.

This soup is absolutely delicious!  I used butter instead of margarine, and chicken broth instead of water.  I also roasted red pepper and garlic, and put all the ingredients into the blender.  This is definitely one of my favorites and what you would expect from a fine restaurant.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Maybe using butternut squash is the key. I used an heirloom squash, crookneck, and it was very bland, so I used a suggestion from another squash recipe and added alspice, nutmeg and ginger. It needed a lot of salt too. It helped a lot. I liked it fine, but my husband who is not fond of squash, didn't care for it and he is not a picky eater.

This is a really good recipe.  I cut the creme cheese in 1/2 and will probably cut a little more next time (but it still tasted wonderful).  I also roasted the squash (brushed with olive oil, fresh roasted garlic, pepper, marjoram & cumin).  I sauteed onion and red bell pepper (cut fine). Used hand blender and warmed.  The consistency is fantastic.  I will play with flavor a little more, but will definitely make again and again.

I read this recipe and then read of few of the reviews and made some changes.  I baked the butternut squash with olive oil, salt, pepper and crushed garlic for 1 hour @ 350 degrees.  I added 1/2 sliced apple.  I used 32 oz. of chicken broth because I knew if I didn't use the entire package for this recipe it would end up going to waste.  I blended the soup with a hand blender (easy!) I didn't have any cayenne pepper so I used extra ground pepper and a little bit of ginger.  I also left out the cream cheese because it was creamy enough and the butter (I used butter instead of margarine) added enough calories and fat.  Next time, I will try olive oil instead of butter.  It was sooo good!!!

MMMMM!! Will make again!!! I used 1 butternut squash, and half a bar of cream cheese because that was all I had. I added a teaspoon of garlic when sauteeing the onions. I put the squash in the microwave and used a hand mixer to blend in the pot. It was actually quite messy that way but left the soup a little lumpy which I enjoyed!! I used chicken stock and doubled the cayanne because I love soup with a kick!!! My 18 month old and 3 Year old both loved it too!!

This soupd was too rich for me with 2 bars of cream cheese, so the next time I made it I used only one 8 ounce reduced fat cream cheese, and used 7 cups of butternut squash and it was the best butternut squash soup I have had.  A friend suggested toasting some pecans and coconut and sprinkling them over the top for decoration and a little crunch.  This made it even better.  Yummmm.

I thought this tasted like a mix between pumpkin and carrot soup. I really enjoy the flavors and only used 1/3 of the cheese that was asked for. I used laughing cow cheese instead of cream cheese. Also, I used my immersion blender twice. First to puree the squash after I cooked it in the oven. Second, after I added the cheese and let it melt. It really helped to give this a smooth consistency.

I did not enjoy this recipe at all. I am not too fond of squash to begin with so take it with that understanding. The texture of the soup was unpleasant and the over all flavor too bland for my liking.

This was my first time cooking with butternut squash. I was afraid that after all that work making it that I would not like it. I loved it! I used butter, one block neufchatel, 4 cups broth and added some salt.

YUM!  This is a great recipe!  I listened to fellow reviewers and cut the cream cheese by 1/2. I added a 1/2 tsp. of marjoram, because I love it!  Last, I roasted the squash instead of boiling it.  Overall a hit with the family!!!

My family LOVES this recipe.  I've made it several times and usually double it.  I do only a couple of things differently.  First off I don't ever use margarine, so I used butter instead.  Also, before blending I leave out a couple of handfuls of cubed squash and add it to the soup for some texture.  I have used low fat cream cheese on occasion and it doesn't seem to make a difference.  Either way, with or without my changes this soup is amazing!

Roasted 2 medium sized squash for about 45  minutes at 425 (30 minutes in I cut the squash in half). Put them in a large purex dish, added the liquid like suggested then added 1 package of reduced fat cream cheese. Using a hand blender I pureed right in the dish. It is delicious!

I've been craving butternut squash soup and this was a delicious recipe.  I roasted my squash in the oven and then added it to the rest of the ingredients.  The only thing I did not care for was the large amount of cream cheese--I only used half a package and it was still a little too much for my liking.  I think 1/4 of a package would be perfect.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

I bought a butternut squash at the grocery store.  The cashier kept talking about this soup that she had.  So, I decided to try it.  I was not really impressed.  Very flavorful, but way too thick.

EXCELLENT, you can use about 1/2 of the amount of cream cheese and inrease the water to make it healthier and less filling.  I find it plenty rich with only 1/2 the amount of cream cheese.   Also, I cut the amount of Cayenne in 1/2 so that my 2 year old will ask for seconds, and thirds!  Excellent recipe!!

I followed it exactly except i roasted 2 squash at 375 for 45 minutes. Very tasty! Next time, I am cutting down the cream cheese because it was overpowering and kind of a weird taste... so next time just one package. Otherwise, very very good!

I have made this soup several times and everyone always loves it.  It is very rich though so I would recommend either serving it as a meal in and of itself or in small portions with dinner.

Absolutely delicious!  I baked the squash in the oven as others suggested and that was wonderful and easy.  I did not measure my onions, just chopped up two smallish onions, so I'm sure I had more than 6 T, but I like savory soups, so I did that on purpose.  I also only added a couple ounces of Neufchatel cheese - a little less fattening than cream cheese.  I added just enough to change the color of the soup and pureed it all together.  It was not sweet at all (may have been with all the cream cheese) - it was nice and savory, the way I like it.  The cayenne was delicious in it.  I make soup from summer squash pretty regularly, but I liked this even better.  My husband raved and my kids even liked it - I just added a little milk to their bowl to bring down the spice a bit (they are 3 and 5), but a little dab of sour cream would have been great for a garnish for them too, if I'd had some.  I will definitely make this many more times...thank you for the recipe!

Delicious!  Definitely half or quarter the amount of cream cheese you add.  Also, I tried making it with acorn squash.  Not quite as good, but not a bad option.

I've been making this for several years and it's a hit every time!  I baked the squash first, then scoop it out into the chicken broth.  I only use half the cream cheese.

Favorite comfort food recipe!!! Love it.  I made it the same as the recipe except I use Italian seasoning (that has marjoram in it) instead of just Marjoram because that's what I had on hand.  Yum!

I just made this today and we loved it! I followed advice from others to bake the squash because it brings out the flavor and makes it easy to work with. I softened the onions in butter then added the water and bouillon cubes with the spices. I used rubbed sage because I didn't have marjoram and added a pinch of nutmeg. Also upped the cayenne just a bit to our taste. Then I scooped out the baked squash and added to the mix w/ the cream cheese. I used my hand blender to puree it altogether. Excellent recipe! To make a beautiful presentation you could swirl a tsp. of cream around the top of the soup. If you love squash this is a must try. Thanks for the great soup recipe.

I followed this recipe exactly as stated. It was too creamy. Next time I would only use 8 oz. cream cheese. Nevertheless, my husband still LOVED it.  I will try again.

Tastes like creamy cheesy potato soup!  Only needs one package of cream cheese (never had it with two... neufactel at that).  Would be great base for cheesy broccoli soup or good with carrots added.  Followed another's suggestion and cooked squash first in microwave about 10 min (cut in half & place insides down).

This was amazing soup. I followed recipe to the tea, and I have to say I liked it even without the cream cheese. The only thing is I wished I made more.

The kids and I really loved this soup and I had never tried Butternut Squash before.  It was rich,creamy,and just the right amount of sweetness for a hearty and healthy soup.  My hubby didnt really care for it but he's not much of a soup person.  This recipe is a definite keeper for the cool winter months.  Thank you!

Delicious and Healthy! I used less butter (only 1 1/2 T.) and used fat free cream cheese. I thought the taste was great, although next time I will experiment with different spices because I thought the majoram was a little strong. The only other thing I did was add more water, because it seemed almost like mashed potatoes instead of soup when I blended it. I will definitely make it again though!

This was very good, but next time I will cut down a little on the butter (I use butter instead of margarine). I added minced garlic & used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of cream cheese (sour cream would probably also work).  This is a good basic recipe & one that you can easily customize to your own tastes.  I will definitely try again.

I made this with what I had on hand - only 4 oz cream cheese.  I can't imagine if I had used all of it.  You wouldn't be able to taste the squash.  All in all, a good soup though.

This was wonderful.  I roasted the squash with some Olive Oil, Cinnamon, and Coriander for about 60 minutes.  I added a diced potato to the soup mix to thicken a little.  We just added a spoon full of cream cheese to our bowl and it was perfect.  I will be making this recipe a lot :).

This soup is delicious, and pretty easy to make, but VERY creamy.  I even followed the suggestion of others and only used one package of light cream cheese, and was still VERY rich!!  In the future I'll only use a spoonful of cream cheese!  I also added a lot more cayenne (maybe a 1/2 a teaspoon), and the cayenne flavor was strong (yet delicious).  I also baked the squash for maybe 45 minutes before, makes it easier to peel & cut.  Will do it again, with modifications.

excellent!  I used two pkgs of frozen squash and added about 2 cups of skim milk in place of one of the cream cheese.  So good!

Other than cutting up the squash the soup was super easy to make.  My husband had one bowl and was filled!  (This never happens with soup)  I made garlic biscuits to go with it and put some chives on top with a swirl of cream and it looked like it came from a five star restaurant!

This recipe is amazing!  I only used 1 box of cream cheese and it's still SO rich.  I also added a bit more cayenne to give it a delicious kick!  Thank you, thank you for this recipe!!

I have made this soup with both frozen cooked squash and fresh roasted squash.  a friend who made this soup gave me the recipe. It is a simple soup that gets wows everytime it is made.  I have also made without using the cayenne pepper. very good. Will continue to make.

I also baked the squash in the shell for an hour, with olive oil, salt, pepper, and garlic powder. And then scooped it out-easy!  And I used only one block of cream cheese.  I only added some ginger to flavor it.  And it was really, really, good!!

Yummy and rich! Perfect for a cold day when you need some comfort food. I took previous suggestions of roasting the butternut squash first and that helped a lot to make it easier to cut. I als used 1/4 of the cream cheese and it was still plenty rich and hearty!

This makes a wonderful soup! Excellent for cold fall & winter days.

To make it more smooth, I'll sometimes substitute the cream cheese with some whipping cream or canned milk. I also like to put fresh spices into a cheesecloth that I can take out at the end. This makes the soup more uniform in color and flavor. When I serve it, I like to save some of the cream/milk and give the soup an artistic swirl.

Very good and creamy, I only used half the cream cheese.  Fairly simple as well, I made in between baking and mixing Christmas cookies. Kids and hubby liked it as well.

very rich and fantastic!  ETA: I've made this a few times and always roast the squash. I even served it as part of Christams dinner and my Mother loved it even though she hates squash. The cream cheese is what sets this recipe apart so don't skip it. I use the 1/3 lass fat kind to cut fat but not flavor.

This soup was fantastic. The only thing I varied was the cream cheese - used 1 pkg (half of the standard recipe amount). I added more black and cayenne pepper than suggested - just a matter of taste - started with the recipe amounts and just added a bit at a time until it was just right. I tasted the soup to make sure it was OK and I just couldn't stop! Everyone at our Thanksgiving table loved it - even the guys who didn't think they wanted to try it. It is pretty easy too - a bit of a pain to pour into the blender, mix, pour back into pan - but overall it's easy and quick and DELICIOUS. Enjoy!!

One of my new favorite soups - wow! I baked the squash ahead of time to soften it up, used fat free cream cheese and no sodium boullion. 

My only suggestion is that I will probably use half the boullion next time - the "chicken-y" flavor overpowered the spices and squash a little.

I've made 3 soups with butternut squash this year and this was BY FAR the best tasting. Like other reviewers, I roasted the squash first and used 6oz of cream cheese (which I still think was and oz or two too much). I also put a tad more cayenne pepper. Overall, if you're looking to make an easy and very tasty butternut squash soup this is the one.

First, thanks to all of those reviewers that said to use only 1/2 of cream cheese.  I can't imagine you would be able to taste the squash if you used the amount listed in the recipe.  This was good but I couldn't give it 5 stars because I could easily taste the cream cheese.  I prefer recipes that are the sum of their parts.

I am not sure if something went horribly wrong or what, but while the taste of this soup wasn't bad, I found the texture of it to be too much.  I think this would be good as a sort of appetizer dip but I thought I'd gag when I attempted to eat a whole bowl of soup.

I just made this and... wow.  It was a huge hit.  I did make some changes.  I only used about 6 oz. cream cheese.  I used sage instead of marjoram (b/c sage and butternut squash were made to go together) and I used more like 1 1/2 tsp.  I used a bit extra black and cayenne pepper.  AND I used about 1/4 cup parmesan which added a nice extra flavor.  I boiled the squash before working with it to soften it up.  So I cut the stovetop cooking time down to 15 minutes. 

This was so easy and so decadent.  I'll definitely make again. But it is FILLING!

Delicious!
I changed it up by using low-fat cream cheese and only 1 package of it.
Additionally, I cooked my squash in the microwave (ten minutes, cut in half with 1/4 inch of water) while I prepared the other ingredients. I also put the liquids in my sauce pan after lightly sauteing the onions. Then scraped out the squash with a spoon and everything went into my Vita-mix blender and I blended for one minute.

Fabulous consistency: creamy, rich and smooth. For my portion I added a couple extra dashes of cayenne, as I like it on the spicy side.

This recipe is wonderful, i did change it up a little and it came amazing!!! I've made this soup now about 10 times and i think i got it just right, everyone raves about it and asks for the recipe! I use 2 1/2 lbs squash, 4oz cream cheese, 32oz chicken stock and 1 (the secret) beef boullion cube! every thing else I do the same but by mistake I used a beef boullion cube once and it turned out even better!!!!

Really delicious soup.  I used 1 eight oz package of cream cheese (lowfat even) and it was still very rich and creamy.  An immersion blender is much easier than transferring to a blender in batches.  I will definitely make this recipe again - I could barely stop sneaking spoonfuls before I served it!

i only used 1/3rd of the original amount of cream cheese called for in this recipe, and i still found it to be very rich. it was very flavorful, but not exactly my style. i don't think i'll be making it again.

Similar to the other reviews, I also thought this recipe was a good foundation.  I used reduced fat cream cheese and also only used 8oz.  I had to thin the soup with a little milk at the end it was so thick. I added nutmeg and a small amount of cooking sherry wine.  I thought this was good and will definitely make again.

Very tasty soup - restaurant quality! I will be serving this for Thanksgiving as I think it has universal appeal. Thick and Creamy and Filling. 
I did have a problem though, with the squash itself. It is impossible to cut thru with a knife, I ended up scrabling up a way to peel and cube it and had to microwave it to soften it up. Once it was cubed, everything else was easy.

This recipe is the best!  I, too, only used 1 stick of cream cheese, but the soup is still so rich and flavorful.  I have made this 3 times already this fall and haven't tired of it yet!  Plus, each time I've made it I get tons of requests for the recipe and I am almost ashamed to show it to them because it is so easy yet the soup tastes so elegant.  Definite winner for anyone who likes this type of rich and hearty soup!!  You won't be disappointed!!!

This recipe is very simple and delicious.  I opted for one block of cream cheese and that worked for our taste.  My husband practically licked his bowl!  We will definitely make this soup again.

I am pleasantly surprised.  I've never had butternut squash before at all, but decided to be adventurous.  This was yummy.  I roasted the squash in the oven and used about 4 oz. of cream cheese.  My kids will probably even eat it!!  :)

At the advice of the other reviewers, I used 1/2 the cream cheese (and even used low fat) and it was WAY too rich.  I guess it's a preference, but for those of you looking for a fresh, lighter soup... this is definitely not the right recipe.

Very tasty. I also did a lot less cream cheese, and added these seasonings which were nice: poultry seasoning 2T, ginger 1t, lime juice 3T. This had more breadth and hint more tang.

I substituted Thyme for Marjoram (because I had none.) I also roasted the squash as did a lot of other reviewers and only found I needed one package of cream cheese! YUMMY soup.  It was completely gone and now I'm sad I have no leftovers for tomorrows lunch.

I made this tonight and can't wait to share it with friends tomorrow.  It's fabulous as is, but I made some changes to suit my own tastes.  I roasted the peeled and diced squash, along with an acorn squash and 2 sweet potatoes, tossed in olive oil, garlic powder, poultry seasoning, sea salt and black pepper for 45 minutes.  With an immersion blender I pureed the vegetables with 48 oz chicken broth, 1 pkg. cream cheese and 1.5 cups skim milk.  I substituted red pepper flakes for the cayenne that I didn't have.  This is a wonderful, velvety recipe!  An easy way to peel the squash is with a vegetable peeler.  It didn't take any longer than a potato.

I made this soup with yellow squash and it came out delicious! I didn't add the marjoram (didn't have any) or cayenne and I used 4 oz of cream cheese.

This is so good. I think I used about half the recommended amount of cream cheese and it was still very thick and creamy. Also, like many other reviewers, I roasted the squash first.

I give it 5 stars, but I only used ONE 8oz pkg of cream cheese.  I think if I had used 2 it would not have been as good.  It's plenty cheesy with one pkg.  YUMMY!

Loved the base of this soup, but I also adjusted for our tastes.  I roasted the cubed squash tossed in olive oil and salt & pepper. Used 4 oz low fat cream cheese.  I added fresh ginger and used Ancho chili pepper as it complements the sweet flavor of the squash.  After pureeing, I finished the soup w/ a swirl of FF half and half in the bowl.  Pretty, Yummy and really easy!!!

I roasted the squash separately, then just scooped it into the saucepan with the sauteed onion, poured the chicken broth over and added the spices, and voila, a soup in 5 min flat! I added 2 T cream cheese last minute and it lumped...maybe because it wasn't room temperature. Anyway, I'll leave it out next time or add milk instead. A pinch of sugar or drizzle of honey really makes the squash flavor shine. A quick, easy favorite.

After reading all the great reviews i was disappointed in this soup. I usually like butternut squash soup but this did come out well for me. A little too spicy which is odd become a prefer spicy food.

I used one reviewers suggestions by roasting two squashes sliced in half at 375 for 45 min - I also used more cayenne, and only 1 package of cream cheese (although probably should have used 1/2 of a package).  I used Smart Balance instead of margarine.  Delicious!

I only used one package of cream cheese, and I pre-roasted the squash as others suggested; I thought this soup was bland and too thick, though the smell was deceptively delicious! Probably won't make this one again.

This was great!  I ended up roasting my squash and using canned broth instead of bullion.  I also doubled the cyanne to 1/4 tsp instead of 1/8.  My hubby loved that but it was almost too hot for me.  Finally, just one package of cream cheese seemed plenty!  Will definetly make again:)

This soup was amazing! I did tweek it a little bit though. What I changed from the original recipe was I added carrots, celery and a potato to it as well. I also baked the squash first as others recommended, and I only used 1 package of cream cheese. So good!

I was really hesitant about making this soup but was glad I did after! Thick and great flavor. I followed the recipe exactly as far as the ingredients go but did roast the squash for 45 min on 375. I did add it all in the pot and boiled for about 10 minutes to infuse the flavors. I will make this many more times!

This soup is fantastic! Especially after it's a day or two old. I took other recommendations and cut two large butternut squash in half, placed them face down and baked on 375 for 30 min... scooped out the inside and blended it in a blender with the cream cheese in batches. I seasoned just as recommended and it really didn't need anything extra. I've been eating the left overs for two days now with rolls. It gets better the longer it sits. I will definitely make this again!!!

My husband who likes neither squash nor soup said this was his new favorite soup!  This was great for a snowy, cold night next to the fire.  
I roasted the squash like others suggested and cut the cream cheese down to about 1/5 of one 8 oz package.  I can't imagine how yummy it is with the full amount.  I also cut the cayenne out because I didn't like the spice last time I made it, subbed about a 1/4 cup of brown sugar.

This is the easiest and best soup!  The only thing I did differently was to bake the squash at 350 degrees for 30-40 minutes with a little olive oil/salt/pepper.  Amazing!  Thanks so much for the recipe.  It's going to get a lot of use this fall.

very good and easy to make.  I will make again.  I loved it but my husband thought it was just ok (that's why I gave it 4 stars).  But if you love squash, you will love this soup.  Thanks for the recipe!!

very good, with some of the adaptations suggested by fellow reviewers:  I roasted the squash, used chicken stock & real butter of course, and half the cream cheese.  However, the suggested amount of cayenne was enough--if not too much--for my family.  My five-year-old wanted to know why the top of her mouth felt "sour" (she still mixes up spicy with sour).  This would be really excellent with French bread or bread sticks to dip.

I used a Fuji apple with the onion, sauteed in mirco... then added everything, this was ready in 15 min's! I had already roasted my squash. I did not add cream cheese, I only added a small amount of half and half. Delicious. Served with day old bread, to dip! WOW! Kids loved it too! Thank you!

I'm rating it a 4 because I liked it but my kids didn't. Its a very rich soup and I only added half the cream cheese. I also didn't have cayenne pepper so I did not add any. I cooked the squash the day before and just added everything together just before lunch. I will make this again however I will add a little more chicken stock and less if any cream cheese. I hope it freezes well. Thanks for sharing.

I served this as an option on a birthday buffet at church and everyone loved it, in fact it was so creamy that some people thought that it was a dip to go with the crackers I set out with it.

I followed some of the other reviews and used 1/2 the cream cheese (plenty!) and used 4 cups of vegetable broth instead of water and boullion.  It turned out great - even my father, who won't touch most butternut squash recipes because he doesn't like his veggies "sweet," loves this one.

This was good.  My family liked though they thought they wouldn't.  They said it tasted like cheese soup.  I halved the recipe and it was almost too creamy, so like others, next time I would cut down the cream cheese a bit.

This is the first time I have made butternut squash and the soup was amazing! I added one cup of organic apple juice and only used 1/2 the cream cheese.  I also baked the squash (brushed with EVOO) for 30 min in the oven to help with cook time. It was so good that even my 2 year old ate it.  I will only use 1/4 the cream cheese next time.  GREAT RECIPE!!

Great basic recipe.  I also roasted my squash as other reviewers suggested - those suckers are a pain to peel!  I added about a cup of really good apple juice in addition to the chicken stock and only used 4oz of cream cheese - it was plenty creamy!  The girls at work went ga-ga over it.

Yummmmmm!

I followed the recipe exactly (only thing was my squash was already pureed as it was leftover from when I was making a pumpkin pie last week).  So i didn't bother pureeing the soup, just let the onions be a bit chunky.  SUCH good flavor, and I used about a third of the cream cheese.  Try it!

Great Recipe, I normally make Squash soup all the time with the basic but wanted to try this recipe, while I slightly deviated it was still great. I added only about 2 Tbs spoon of cream cheese, and also added heavy whipping cream. I chopped about 2 tbls spoon worth of fresh chicken in small bits with half a handful of pasta. This allowed the soup to thicken real nicely. The chicken bouillon was reduced slightly to reduce the sodium content. The soup was rich and creamy with small bits of chicken, and the occasosional penne pasta bit.

This recipe is fantastic!  I have made this soup twice, and everyone who tries it loves it!  I must admit that I made a few changes.  I roast the squash first, and I add in extra cayenne pepper and some curry powder (I like mine with a little kick).  But my biggest change is that I cut down the cream cheese significantly - I only use 4 oz (half of a block), and it comes out perfect.  Smooth, creamy, and delicious.

Roasted the squash split lengthwise face down at 375 for 45 minutes first; makes the skin easy to peel and the squash easy to scoop. And cuts the boiling time down to only about 5 minutes once you add to the chicken broth. I cut the cream cheese in half, I used three cans of chicken broth. PHENOMENAL. I made this for a potluck dinner last month and it was the only soup that was really touched out of four choices - everyone loved it. Roommates and friends have requested it 4 other times since. Super easy to make (about 30 minutes after roasting) and VERY delicious.

Creamy, flavorful, delicious!
I did make a couple of changes to mine.
I used one butternut squash and added a 
15 oz can of pumpkin after squash was tender. I used only three bouillon cubes and 12 oz cream cheese. My 18 mo. old, who tends to be a finicky eater, loved it.

This was great.  Made it with pumpkin from my garden, also cut the cream cheese to 12 ozs. and doubled the onions.  I used a stick blender.

4 out of 5 only because I made modifications... I roasted for 45 minutes.  I also added into the mixture 1-8oz block of fat free cream cheese.  I grilled chicken & apple sausages and threw those in as well.  Spices used: Cinnamon, nutmeg, and curry.  Also, added baby spinach at the end for a nice contrast in color - and swirled at the top of my bowl a little maple syrup.  Oh. my this was heavenly.  Will do again, but next time will add chopped apple as well.

This is better than most brands I have bought in the store. I know I am strange, but I decided to make this sweet and add brown sugar to it. I also left in the cayenne and it had a sweet/spicy taste that I love.

Overall very good soup, but I did make some adjustments.  First, I roasted my squash is the oven brushing it lightly with olive oil and the sprinkling it with salt and pepper.  I only used one half of one cream cheese block, 4oz I guess.  It was still very rich and creamy.  I can't imagine liking it if I used the orignal two cream cheese blocks that the recipe calls for.  Sometimes less is more.  Also, I used chicken broth and omitted the bouillion.  I loved the kick the cayanne pepper lends to this soup.  Delicious.

This is a delicious soup, especially because it is a little bit different from other butternut squash soup recipes.  I'm a vegetarian, so I made it with vegetable broth, and that worked well.  As others have mentioned, I used less cream cheese, actually only about 1/4 of a block of neufchatel.  I would recommend only using about this much when you initially blend the soup.  You can always put it back in the blender again with a bit more cream cheese if you decide you want more, but you can't take out the cream cheese once you've blended it in.  Also, I found the soup a little bit thick, so I added a little bit more vegetable broth (about 3/4 cup) to the soup once it was entirely done and blended.  That thinned it out, and it was great!

Everyone raves about this soup.  I only use 1/2 of one package of cream cheese, otherwise its way too rich for my taste.  The other secret is to DEFINITELY roast the lightly oiled squash (cut in half) placed over some garlic cloves until soft.  Your house will smell like heaven and it makes it makes it taste so much better.  This is a new family recipe that will be at every Thanksgiving from now on.

Absolutely outstanding. I do use about 48 ounces of chicken broth and only one package of cream cheese, because otherwise it's WAY too thick. This has become a huge favorite in my family, and requested every fall and winter. Everyone loves the pepper! To make it super easy and quick, I pick up four packages of the cubed, peeled butternut squash in the salad section of Trader Joe's. Very yummy, and very filling!

I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this recipe and I am NOT a big soup fan.  I thought it would be nice to have a soup with christmas - it was easy to make once you get the squash cubed (which no small feat!).  My husband thought it was too rich (I used 2 packages cream cheese) so maybe next time I will use only 1.  It did taste amazing with only 1 package I just wanted to increase the volume so I added the second. Thanks for this amazing soup recipe!

I made this soup on the spur-of-the-moment with fabulous results. I've been asked for an encore, so you know it's good. I read the reviews and did limit the cream cheese to one package (I figured I could always add another, but didn't need to.), and I roasted my squash instead of boiling (old habits). Otherwise, I followed the directions with rave reviews. Thanks

This was really rich: a great fall/winter time soup.  I enjoyed the buttery flavor.  I roasted the squash and it worked great that way.  I also used a very small amount of light cream cheese to make it healthier.

This soup was delicious, but since I altered the recipe based on others' reviews, I only gave it 4 stars.  Definitely half the cream cheese - it is very creamy with only using 1 package and would be way too rich with 2. I also roasted the squash first with olive oil, salt and pepper.  It really brought out the flavors and made it easy to work with.  I brought this soup to a large party, and was asked for the recipe by many people.  There wasn't a bit of it left.  Served it with warm rolls. Fantastic!

I made this soup for the first time as the first course for our Thanksgiving dinner. It was absolutely delicious! Rich, creamy, with a little heat from the cayenne pepper. My guests nearly licked their bowls clean!

I only used one and a half blocks of cream cheese, though, due to the suggestions of reviewers here. I thought it came out fine!

Thanks for the recipe, Mary!

A very good soup!  I roasted the butternut squash before making the soup which gave it a wonderful flavor.  I used veggie broth and only about 4 oz of cream cheese.  In the future, I'll just use milk or cream; the cream cheese was ok but it kind of left a few little pieces floating around that looked a bit like curdled milk.  I loved the cayenne-it added a GREAT zing to the soup.  I really loved that this soup was not sweet as most butternut squash soups are.  Wonderful and a definite keeper.  Thank you!

It was alright, if I use this recipe again, there will be a lot of modifying.  First, I cut the cream cheese to about a 1/2 of what was state.  Also, I used vegetable soup stock instead of water, and about twice what was recommended, as the soup was way too thick.

I don't like the flavor that cream cheese gave the soup - use milk or half& half or yogurst instead - definitely cream cheese though.

Sorry, but I didn't like this dish. The cream cheese gave the soup an odd "tangy" flavor, which neither my husband or I enjoyed. Also, and maybe it was the butternut squash I used, but the soup came out "yellow", not orange and the color was unappealing.

Excellent!Both my husband and I loved it.
However, I am glad I tested the soup after I added 12 oz of cream cheese. Its incredibly rich. I would suggest starting with half a rectangle (4oz) and add incrementally to make sure your soup fits your desired richness. I agree with some of the reviewers that the soup would be great even without any cream cheese, rather a dash of cream. I will definitely be making this again.

Wow, this was definitely a keeper.  To make it easier, I split the squash and baked it ahead of time.  Also, after sauteing the onion, I just threw the rest in the crock pot and mixed it up with the hand blender.  I really liked the bite the cayenne gave it, but will use less next time because it was a bit too spicy for my little kids.  Also used a little less cream cheese than called for, but probably wouldn't do without it entirely.  The texture was still nice without, but the taste was greatly improved by adding cream cheese (of course, I think EVERYTHING is better with a little cream cheese). Really great comfort food and easy too!

This was delicious!  I used chicken stock (not broth) and 1 package of cream cheese was plenty.  My hand-held blender was perfect for this recipe, the end result was creamy and smooth and no blender was required.  Will make again!

Great recipe! I used two medium-sized butternut squashes, halved them, and roasted them for 35min in 350F, cut side down, with chopped garlic, salt, and pepper. I also eliminated the marjoram, used 4c chicken stock, and added only 4oz fat-free cream cheese. I tried it without the cream cheese and it was just as good. Since the butternut was already pretty tender from the oven, I only brought to a boil for a few minutes, then used an immersion blender to blend it all. Finally, I added the cream cheese at the end so it wouldn't curdle. Overall, very good. It was missing just a little something though...I wonder what it'd be like with a little sharp cheddar...I'll report back :)

This is a great recipe for squash soup.  I also cooked my squash in the oven for about 45 before preparing.  I also added a little extra squash than what the recipe called for.  I would recommend also that you cut the amount of cream cheese in half, one package is plenty.  This soup was a hit in my house!

This is a really good recipe.  It would probably have been fine as is, but we cooks love to tinker!  I roasted the squash with butter, salt, pepper & brown sugar for 40 minutes at 350.  I sauted onion, garlic and 1 small apple in the butter and then added almost a cup of apple cidar (all I had left) and 2 cups water to the onion mixture.  I added chicken boullion, @ 2 cups of leftover chicken, oregano, red pepper, salt & black pepper.  I used only 1 package of cream cheese and only had 1 medium squash, so blended it and added it.  I also like to chew my soup so threw in some leftover brown rice.  The consistency was just right, but a little sweet.  Maybe I'll leave out the cidar next time.  Everyone liked it very much.  Thank you for the recipe.

This is our family's all-time favorite allrecipes.com recipe--we've eaten it frequently since first discovering it (and allrecipes.com) more than 2 years ago. The only change we've made was to make it the way our friend first fixed it for us: a block of low-fat cream cheese and a block of silken tofu instead of the 2 blocks of cream cheese. It doesn't alter the taste, but adds a little extra protein. My toddler LOVES this soup and requests it often. Peeling and cubing the squash is time consuming, but the soup freezes well before the addition of the cheese, so I often devote an afternoon to the beloved butternut!

I liked it, but the cayenne pepper was too much for me (I'm a wimp!) Next time I'll leave it out.

Awesome Soup!  I too used only 1 package of cream cheese but followed the rest of the recipe to a tee.

This was GREAT!!!  I wanted a Squash Soup and this filled the craving and then some!  It was easy and inexpensive.  I will make this again.  I am starting WW and figured that I could actually use either reduced fat or fat free cream cheese (although I don't know about fat free as sometimes that has a funny flavor), and use minimal points.  HIGHLY RECOMEND!!

Smooth and delicious. I had only one butternut squash and two acorn squash, but it turned out great. I also only used about 1/2 of a bar of low-fat cream cheese, which was plenty! Wonderful fall soup with a hint of spiciness from the cayenne pepper.

This is a fantastic recipe!  Just to make it a little easier, I used one 32 oz. carton of Wolfgang Puck's chicken stock and upped the squash to 7 cups.  I increased the spices just a smidge to compensate for changing up the other ingredients. It had a wonderfully sweet flavor that I don't ever remember coming from squash I had eaten previously. I will definitely make this one of my favorite fall recipes. Thanks for sharing!

I roasted the squash meat side down like another reviewer recommended and it was so easy to work with and had a great flavor.  I also used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and it was very rich!  If you used fresh ground black pepper you won't need to increase the cayanne.  I'm from Texas and my tongue is used to some heat - trust me.  Enjoy!  This might be our new Christmas soup.

I used SLJ6's suggestions and roasted the squash and used apple cider and an apple in the mix.  Added some fat free half and half at the end.  Didn't use the marjoram or cream cheese, but did use the cayenne and black pepper.  Turned out great!!

I followed this receipe to the letter.  The soup came out delicious but was a little thick and cheesy.  I would recommend reducing the amount of cream cheese by half.  I added about a 1/4 white wine a 1/2 cup water to thin it out a little and it was perfect.

Great recipe!  My family, which includes a 5 and 9 year old, absolutely loved this soup.  I chose to roast the squash first and included  seasoned sauteed chicken diced.  We had it for Sunday dinner and it was a hit.

This was really fantastic!!!
I made it with one package of cream cheese instead of two - one seemed like it was plenty.  Also I put crumbled bacon on top right before serving.  wonderful!

This recipe is pretty good.  The only kind of squash I've ever had before was fried squash and it was less than tasty.  I give 4 stars because I think it needs to have something in it...I added a little more cayenne pepper and salt and pepper to taste when i was finished cooking it.  Also, I added a can of kidney beans (well rinsed)-I think this soup would also be a good base for a chowder or creamy stew.  Its also very good for dipping a crusty french or sourdough bread.  Overall pretty good-just may need to do some tweaking based on your own tastes.

Great recipe, though I did alter it a bit. The first time I made this soup it was too thick and much too rich, so I added a cup more chicken stock. I also used only half the cream cheese. Additionally, I love onions, so I used an entire medium sweet onion. 

Great for a cold evening!

This soup is delicious. I have made it exactly as described, but I prefer it with half the cream cheese and try substituting the cayenne pepper for curry powder! Delicious!

This stuff is fantastic!  I get cravings for it.  I cut the cream cheese in half and it's still too rich to eat plain, but I use it as a dip for sourdough bread and it's perfect.  My husband, who dislikes squash, eats this willingly because the cream cheese covers up the squash taste.  One warning: you have to use a good squash or the recipe is ruined!  Out of the many times I made this, it has come out all wrong once (strangely sweet) and I had to throw it out.  I'm pretty sure the squash was at fault.

While making this, I was going to add the amount of creme cheese and thought it was way way too much.  I ended up adding only 1/2 and it was great.  Next time I will even add less.  I would like to tase the squash more instead of the cheese.

Was very tasty but I should've used less cream cheese like reccommended, the cream cheese overpowered the flavor of the squash. Otherwise, not a bad recipe.

A perfect soup on a cold night! I followed the advice in previous reviews and added extra onions and garlic and an apple, and used only 4 oz of cream cheese, which was more than enough! The taste of the cream cheese would be way too strong otherwise! I also kicked up the spices a bit and added some dried coriander powder.

I thorougly enjoyed this soup. I did cut the sour cream in half and also used non-fat (couldn't taste the difference!) My wife thought that it was a little bland, mainly because she prefers soups with a chunkier texture. I may try adding some cubes (cooked) squash before serving. I highly recommend this tasty soup!

I only used 6 oz. of cream cheese and it was perfect. Very creamy and thick, but the taste was not too strong. I roasted the squash in the oven and it made it easier to work with. Next time I will leave out the cayenne or put an even smaller amount, but it was too spicy. Good soup otherwise.

I am a cream cheese addict so I thought I would love this recipe.  I cut the cream cheese in half like others suggested and it was still way too creamy.  We had to add milk to make it thinner.  It still was too thick and creamy for me.  I added the fresh ginger as a few people had suggested and it added such a fresh, yummy taste.

I love this recipe, but I never use butternut squash, I use a hearty winter squash. In the Fall I buy several large squash, cook them and freeze them in 3 cup amounts in ziplocks. Then its easy to throw this together. I also use 1/2 regular cream cheese and 1/2 nonfat and double the pepper. It has become my favorite soup. Thanks for sharing!

I have used this recipe time and time again, and it keeps getting better.  Everytime I walk through my office, people stop me and ask "when are you going to make the soup again?".  One thing I did do diffrent was used an entire Walla Walla onion the last time and due to it being a sweet onion made a great flavor in the soup.  Also im sure I use a little more cream cheese then what is required.  but everyone seems to like the richness.

Yummy, Yummy, Yum.  The richness, smoothness, and taste of this recipe has dazzled my family.  It has been requested every Thanksgiving since I found the recipe 3 years ago.

The soup was nice and warmed the family up on a cold night.  It was o.k.  I used less cream cheese than it called for.  It could use more seasoning or spice for flavor.  The kids liked it.

I thought this was a surprise hit!  It is still a pain to cook butternut sqaush, it takes so long in the oven, and that is the way I do it.  Plan ahead on that one.  I cut the cream cheese down to about 4 ounces and I can't imagine going any richer-- it's a heavy soup, but very flavorful!

Excellent consistency and perfect for the cold fall and winter months. I boiled the squash in water for apx. 15 minutes prior to cutting it to make it easier to skin and cube.

This is a good start - but totally agree with many other reviewers who halved the cream cheese the recipe called for. I doubled this recipe and still only used 8 oz of cream cheese and it turned out really nice. Adding fresh grated ginger also compliments the squash. Gives it a nice vibrant kick - which the recipe needed if prepared as is.

I got this huge tub of peeled and cubed butternut squash at Costco and came across this recipe when trying to decide what to do with it. When I told my husband what I was making for dinner he said "yuck" but said he'd try and ended up eating 3 bowls... I guess he liked.. I loved and so did my little one.  I used all the cream cheese (light) amount but added more squash and water and a little ginger, added the cayenne but used sparingly and put on the table for me to add a little to the finished product, used the blender on the stove method..awesome idea and theres only a bowl left for my lunch tommorow... thanks will make again!!

This is the best butternut squash soup we've ever had!  I use about half the water and half the amount of cream cheese plus I use light cream cheese. It's still VERY creamy and we like the thicker consistancy.  Also, if you have one of those single hand mixers they are GREAT for putting straight into the pot to mix the soup so you don't have to transer the hot liquid through the blender.

Loved it!  It's rich yet still light somehow.  I think I put a little too much onion in it the first time.  Also using a hand blender makes life a lot easier than using a food processesor.  And I added a few tablespoons of cream just to make it a smidge richer.

This soup is awesome; I've made it twice now, once for me and once for Christmas dinner.  It went over real well and had many requests for the recipe.  As many others suggested, I only used 1 block of cream cheese and it is definately creamy enough.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I'd give this a 4.5 if it were available, so I rounded up.  This was a really good soup, but be prepared for some serious richness!  It is quite heavy.  If I make again I'll increase the amount of squash used just a bit, and maybe add  some more broth.  Thanks for the recipe!

Fantastic flavor.  I wish I would have cut back on the cream cheese though because I had a hard time keeping it warm (without lumping up) while the rest of my dinner came together.

Very good!  Didn't have an onion so I put the butter in with the chicken base (never use bullion cubes!).  Also only used one 8oz. cream cheese.  Replaced marjoram with thyme as it was all I had.  Very creamy, very sweet.  All 3 of my boys, ages 1/5/10, ate 2 bowls!  A great keeper for chilly fall days!

This soup has a very subtle, but delicious flavor. I was a little apprehensive about the cream cheese, given I'm not usually a big fan. But it made the soup nice and creamy. My fiancee and I loved it!

This soup is fantastic.  I deviated from the recipe a bit.  These are my changes: substitued 1/2 cup white wine for 1/2 cup of the water; added a diced celery rib when sauteing onion, and omitted the marjoram since I don't have any.  Oh, and I used 1/2 pgk of lowfat cream cheese.

Very good and very easy to make.  I took the advice of many other reviews and I only put one block of cream cheese in and I was great.  I might even put a little less in next time but it turned out very well.

Wonderful fall soup.  Tastes like you spent hours on it.  I only used 1pkg of the cream cheese and used chicken broth instead of bullion.  I also added ginger and put toasted crushed walnuts on top.

I've made A LOT of recipes from this site and most of them have been very good and worth making again but this recipe actually inspired me join up just so I could rate it!  What more can I say when a husband with a cold (i.e., grumpy), a 6 year old, a 4 year old, and a 2 year old all love dinner!  I've never been a butternut squash person but this was yummerific!!  (I did follow others' advice, though and add an additional 2 cups of water.)  It was good!

My young boys LOVE this soup.  They don't even know there's squash in it.  They call it cheese soup and ask for seconds.  I definitely recommend cutting the cream cheese in half.

This was good  I made it for my husband who was coming down with a bad head cold - he loved it but I have to admitt it needed something - maybe a good shot of wine wouldve hit the spot. I'll make it again.

Instead of using less cream cheese I added about 2 cups more water, Also I had a large Butternut Squash, almost 2 cups more than the recipe called for. Soup was very good!

WOW! I changed this a little, less cream cheese, different spices, but it was so good! I added canned chicken,bacon bits and croutons to give it some substance.I thought I would taste it in advance because I wasn't sure about it and I ended up eating 2 bowls! Try it, it is sooo good!

Excellent flavor - with the chayenne. It seemed like it was missing something so I sprinkled crountons on it and it added a wonderful zesty crunch to it. Didnt really need the cream cheese but added 3oz any way. Looks spectacular!

Very scrum-de-licous soup!!!!  I did as others and roasted the squash with some oil, minced garlic, salt and pepper.  Only used one package of cream cheese and substituted red pepper for cayenne pepper.  Just a pinch of cinnamon and nutmeg and you have yourself a tasty little soup.  This soup tastes great as is but I think I will add some broccoli and chicken or cooked bacon to spice it up a bit for my husband.

I made this with only 1 package of cream cheese as several other reviewers suggested and it was still very thick. It was very tasty and I even enjoyed it cold. However I did find it a bit time consuming to make and I think one might try adding some nutmeg or brown sugar to make it a bit sweeter.

An easy and 100% delicious recipe which can be served as a light supper for a large crowd. It can easily be dressed up with a sprinkling of chives and croutons for visual effect.

I used chicken stock instead of the bouillon/water method and added more cayenne,used basil and thyme instead of marjarom.  I think the flavor is excellent but a bit heavy for a soup.  I will use this as more of a sauce presentation on a white plate along serving with some type of poultry.

This is good as a side dish, but a little overpowering to be the main course.  Half the called for cheese is definitely the way to go.  A very good cold weather soup.

Surprisingly excellent!  And the reason I say "surprisingly" is that I usually don't like creamy soups.  I picked this recipe because it was a soup and it had butternut squash, and it was rated 5 stars by at least 200 or 300 people.  Then halfway through making it, I realized that this was a creamy soup!  I followed the optional advice and used only 1 package of cream cheese.  Delicious!!!  And I love the little kick from the cayenne pepper!

Delicious! I halved this recipe because I didn't know how well it would turn out. I took the advice of some others by roasting the squash first (1 med. size squash was plenty)and only used about 3 ozs. of cream cheese. This is a keeper for me.

This soup is awesome! I only used 1-1/2 packages of low fat cream cheese and it was quite rich. And, I added some steamed broccoli and baked chicken to zip it up a little. Yum! 
Thanks Mary!!

I really liked this recipe and have made it several times.  I only use about 6 oz of light cream cheese and I double the cayenne.  This is a good one IMO!

Used only 8 oz. cream cheese and added more cayenne. Color and texture were fine. Flavor a bit bland. Pureed  jarred roasted red peppers and swirled (separately)  on top with sour cream. Added a bit of flavor and great presantation.

This recipe is wonderful!  I made it for my extended family and everyone asked for the recipe.  I only used 3-4 oz of cream cheese and roasted the squash first.  I also used a little more cayenne as a personal preference.  Thanks for sharing a  great recipe.

I made this yesterday and it turned out great!  I made a few changes, I added garlic, used vegetable stock, used rosemary instead of marjoram, omitted the cayenne.  I also used only 1pkg of cream cheese. I served this in individual french onion soup bowls with pastry crust over the top.  Delicious, just like at a dinner we were at a few weeks ago. A perfect appetizer!

Absolutely delectable!  A balance of sweet & spicy made this soup a winner.  I like chunky soup so I scooped out the squash with a spoon and put it right into the soup to cook and left it at that.  Wonderful!  Thanks for the recipe.

Not sure what all the fuss was about.  I found this recipe to be very average.  The squash didn't seem to have a strong enough flavor to carry the recipe, and I added a small portion of the cream cheese, and it overpowered the flavor of the soup.  I'll eat it, but I won't make it again.

Okay, so with all the rave reviews, I had to include this on my very first full-out Thanksgiving day menu for my family of 16!  As a newlywed, I was eager to use all the new China and Silverware.  Anyway, I made this soup the day before, and found it to be only average; I personally didn't care too much for the taste.  However, my Aunt and my sister raved about it, and took all the leftovers home!  To each his own, I suppose.  I just couldn't eat more than a couple spoonfuls of this, as the taste is just so...rich.  I did convert this from its original 6 serving recipe to a 15 serving recipe, and only used 2 of the 5 packets of cream cheese it originally called for.

This is the best butternut squash soup I have ever tasted.  I have given this recipe to family, friends, and co-workers who all agree it is wonderful.  I prepare the squash by using a vegetable peeler and peel the skin and then cut in half, scoop out the seeds and cut the squash into 1 inch pieces. I also use 6 oz of cream or neufactual cheese.  My husband loves this soup and I make it at lease 5 times (if not more) during fall and winter.

This was an excellent soup.  The cayenne pepper gave it a little extra kick.  I changed the recipe a little, I used a small cooking pumpkin and also a squash called sweet dumpling.  I baked both squashes in the oven for an hour until very soft then followed the recipe after that.  I also used 11oz of cream cheese instead of 16oz and it was just as creamy.  I will definitley make this recipe again, very, very good!

This soup was ok, I thought it was bland. I used 4 ounces of cream cheese and baked the squash in the oven before scooping it out.  It would have been very hard to cut.  The soup did not have much flavor, it needs more spices.

Though this is a very easy recipe, the results do not warrant making this again.  The kids would not eat anymore after the first bite.  Even my husband (who will eat anything!) didn't really care for it.  Personally I thought it was OK.  It does need more water however, it was too thick with just 3 cups.  I'd like to add that I always use the highest quality ingredients and still this recipe lacks appeal.  Sorry, I know I am a minority on this.

I tasted the soup prior to adding the cream cheese.Fantastic (and low cal.). I than added only half of the requested cream cheese and I thought it was way too rich. Next time I'll just stick to a little light cream.

I really liked this soup, but I too put half a block of cream cheese and I think next time I would put a little bit less, too rich for me. I would definitly baked the squash, just easier to cut. I will definitly make that soup again.

This soup was absolutely delicious!  Because of previous reviewer suggestions, I used only 4 ounces of cream cheese and it was still very creamy.  I will definitely make this again and again - next time I think I will saute a little carrot and red bell pepper with the onion.  Yum!

I made the mistake of using 2 packages of cream cheese in this recipe-- WAY TOO RICH AND THICK!  Even so, the flavor was great, so I will definitely try it again with 1 or even 1/2 a package of cream cheese.  Very, very easy.

Delicious! My teenagers loved it. I used 1/2 the amount of cream cheese and it was plenty rich and creamy. I'd use a bit more water or stock next time as this soup was fairly thick. I also used fresh marjoram--1 Tablespoon--with wonderful results.

I use papaya peach squash, it is slightly sweeter than butternut.  I also use lowfat sour cream and about 1/2 cup canned milk in place of the cream cheese and it is simply fantastic.  My daughter even likes it!

I prepared this soup along with several other recipes from this site for a couple on Valentine's Day.  It was mind-blowing.  The couple is still telling everyone about this soup and the Almond Mandarin Salad (another big hit).

Yum, yum!  If you don't like rich foods, this is not the soup for you, as it is very thick and VERY rich.  This soup converted someone who thought they didn't like squash.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

Modifications: Doubled all spices, used vegetable broth, and halved cream cheese.

This recipe is to die for!!  The only suggestion I would have is to cut it with milk because it is too thick just by itself.

Excellent!!  This recipe was so easy to make.  The hardest part was peeling the squash, which I found easiest by using a paring knife.  The cayenne gave a nice kick.  I used half the amount of cream cheese because that is all I had at the time, but was glad because any more would have made it too rich.

AWESOME!!  I followed the other suggestions and added less cream cheese...also I baked the squash first then used my hand blender in the pot to mix.  Big hit!  I have to say it was better with the squash from our garden rather than the supermarket.

Excellently creamy and surprisingly tasty!  Melt some crumbled blue cheese in it, and you won't be disappointed.

This soup is excellent. I did however added 4 cloves of finely chopped garlic with the onions. I couldn't stop eating the soup!

Thanks for sharing.

Wonderful recipe, however I would recommend that you not use all of the bouillon cubes.  I've found that 1 or 2 do just fine.

Fantastic!!!  I've never made soup before and I must say that this recipe was easy.  I baked the squash beforehand like so many people have suggested and I used chicken broth.  You must try this soup; it's just like in the restaurants.

When I received an immersion blender as a gift for my birthday, the first recipe I tried was this one, and all of the rave reviews are true... this is an amazing soup.  The first time I tried it, I used one 8 oz package (it was too rich)  The second time (I must admit, a few days later), I used half of a package (4 oz) and it turned out much better.  I can't even imagine trying it with the two!  Second admission.. I licked the bowl! It's that good.

One thing of note: after the first try, I now always leave out the onion/butter step.  I didn't like finding little pieces of onion in an otherwise smooth soup.

everyone loved it even my dad who turns up his nose at most things very filling and worth the effort pot gone in hrs I rosted the butternut in foil first though with a wee bit of salt and pepper oil and honey this made it easier to cut and peel.

This has been the best tasting soup ever! I took the advice of one of the other reviews by cutting the butternut squash in half, spread oil with salt and pepper to the inside, and baked it in the over for 45 minutes.  You might even want to  consider doing this a day before you plan on making this soup since it takes so long.  This has been one of the best recipes I've tried yet.

It was good.  The amount of cream cheese was definitely overkill.  I have made butternut squash soup before and it was much sweeter and less heavy without the creamcheese.  I would definitely make it again but I will cut out the cream cheese in this receipe and I'll use chicken broth instead of bouillon.

I used 4 oz cream cheese, which seemed ample and  also baked the squash.  Soup-hating husband loved the recipe.  It was even better 2 days later.

This is a great cool weather recipe.  I wouldn't hesitate to serve this at a dinner party.  I halved this for my husband and I and still had some leftover.  Not sure if anyone has tried this with a different veggie, but I think it would work wonderfully with broccoli.

Excellent. My husband and son who said you are making what? loved it!  I used 3 cups of chicken broth instead of boullion.  Only (1) package of cream cheese and I cooked the squash in the oven first for 40 minutes at 350.  Good winter meal with biscuits.  Thanks for sharing I will definately make again.

Delicious was to use squash that my whole family loved!  (Even the 4 year old!)  I don't have a food processor, and my blender died on this meal, so I used a hand mixer and it did a great job puree-ing the squash.  Will definitely pull this out again as the weather turns cold!!

I thought this recipe had a lot of flavor. I had a little extra bouillion cube and I did cut down on the cream cheese. I think I will try milk next time instead of cream cheese. It was plenty thick.

I tried this recipe this weekend. I didn't change anything in the recipe except I did not have cayenne pepper so I used red crushed pepper. I brought the soup to work today & 3 other people also liked it & asked for the recipe. This is one recipe that I will continue to use over & over! Thanks Carolyn G, California.

This recipe is just delicious. I used the chicken stock and one 8 oz. cube of cream cheese and it came out creamy and GOOD! I could even use this soup for a nice sit down dinner if I wanted and it fixes up so quickly!

I didn't have time to puree the soup, so I just mashed it with a potato masher. Obviously, it was chunky rather than smooth, but the flavor was great!  I couldn't convince my non-soup and non-squash-eating husband and children to taste, but I will definitely pass this recipe along to others!

Two words: Comfort food. It was a chilly autumn night when I made this, and the perfect way to end the day. My husband cringed at the sight of it, but as promised with all my cooking he did try it and loved it after all! I used vanialla yogurt instead of cream cheese and it was still creamy and delicious!

I love finding and trying new soups and this one will be a repeat! Easy to make, tasty and a great way to have squash! I did substitute the cream cheese for a small carton of whipped cream. I loved it and so did my picky family!

Coming from a young amateur chef, this soup was fantastic. It's only the second soup I've attempted and it came out wonderfully. I added fresh parsley and a dollop of sour cream at the end which made it aesthetically pleasing.

Yum!  I love butternut squash soup, and this was really good.  I used less cream cheese than was called for, and I think that helped.  It was rich and flavorful, with only half the cream cheese.  Will definitely make again!

Great soup, Mary.  The consistency was a little thick and I would suggest adding more broth to the original mix to give it a more "soupy" consistency:  that cream cheese (only half, of course, use only 8oz) really thickens it up!

Wonderful soup! I found that 8 ounces of cream cheese (half of the recipe) was still too much, so next time I'll try 4 ounces. Definately microwave the squash before peeling- it's so much easier.

Really, really wonderful soup.  I made it with half the cream cheese and without the cream cheese.  Both taste wonderful.  Very easy to make, the hardest part is peeling the squash. A lady at the market said to microwave the squash for 3 min and then peel - much easier.

This was really delicious!  I took the suggestions and halved the cream cheese an used chicken broth.  I like things with a little spice so I kicked up the peppers just a smidge.  I also added about 4 cloves of roasted garlic which gave the soup a little depth.  Very good.  Served at dinner party and there was not a drop left by the end!

Simple and very tasty; goes well with French bread for dunking.  Definitely recommend using less cream cheese than it calls for though, it came out quite thick.  Or, thin it out with milk.

This was GREAT!  I used 8 oz of Neufchatel and it was just right.  I also used a hand blender instead of a full size blender which was easier to clean-up and worked very well.

I didn't enjoy this recipe at all.  I found the final result to be the consistancy of baby food and to have lost the great flavor of the squash altogether.  Perhaps I did something incorrectly when making it...

This soup is amazing!   Simple, inexpensive to make and very yummy!  (I used one package of light cream cheese instead of the 2 that the recipe called for.)
