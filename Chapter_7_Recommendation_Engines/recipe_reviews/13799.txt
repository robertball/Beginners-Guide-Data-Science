This was a big hit on Thanksgiving.  It went perfectly with a Tofurky.  I was in a rush and did not read the reviews, so mine came out way too thick.  I just added more spices and water until the consistency seemed right to me.  Next time I’ll cut back on the oil and flour.  The trick to a perfect gravy is to always have equal amounts of fat (oil or butter) and flour so be sure to cut both equally.    I also allowed the flour to brown a little before adding the vegetable stock.  I think that really adds to the flavor.  I would say that the nutritional yeast is not necessary, but it helps a lot.  For those who don't know, for some reason nutritional yeast + soy sauce = total goodness.  You see that combination in a lot of vegetarian recipes.  This will definitely be in my recipe box permanently with some doctoring.  I think this recipe would adapt well, like using mushroom broth instead of vegetable.  I’ll definitely try it again.  Thanks.

I'm not a vegetarian, but it had gotten down to the end of the month, and we didn't have any sausages for my standard sausage gravy. As a matter-of-fact, we didn't have a lot of things, so I had to make quite a few substitutions. Olive oil for the generic vegetable oil, no nutritional yeast, ordinary soy sauce, portabello mushroom broth for vegetable broth, no salt, and parsley, rather than sage. The result was extremely good, and I was pleasantly surprised. This is the sort of thing you can pull off without much effort, and I'll definitely make it again.

i can't believe how good this gravy is.  last year i bought vegetarian mushroom gravy for thanksgiving and it was awful so this year i looked for a good recipe but this exceeded all of my expectations.  i used half the oil because of other user comments and omitted the salt and added about 3/4 cup water because it was thick but it's the best.

I made this gravy for Thanksgiving because I wanted a recipe that didn't require turkey drippings. It had a very good flavor, but after it sat on the table for about 10 minutes, that 1/2 cup of oil all started to pool up at the surface. I wanted to go stir the gravy every five minutes to make sure no one noticed. I think this is a good, sound gravy recipe and is probably an outstanding alternative if you're a vegetarian, but if you're not, take my advice: substitute the 1/2 cup of oil with the same amount of butter, and if you prefer, use chicken broth instead of vegetable broth. It will taste - and look - a lot better.

This is a delicious and tangy vegetarian gravy.  My mom and I have searched for years for a gravy that could stand up to the fat & meat based fare at Thanksgiving and this recipe definitely does it.  Even the meat eaters at the table were impressed and asked for seconds!  I added about 2/3 c. mushrooms, which I cooked with onions and garlic (this means that it needed to cook for several extra minutes to cook off some of the water released from the mushrooms).  Wonderful gravy--most definitely a part of my permanent file.

It's hard to find vegetarian recipes that impress my non-veggie friends, but this is one that did! I did cut the oil down to 1 tbsp, without effecting the great flavour.  Yum!

This gravy is absolutely amazing.  I plan on serving it for Christmas instead of the traditional turkey gravy.  It was a little thick so I added some water.  I probably should have added more vegetable broth which is what I will be doing next time.  It has such a hearty taste...simply wonderful!  You will not be disappointed.  I can't wait to see my mother in law's reaction because she's the type that can't believe you can make traditional gravy without having to use the fat drippings, etc...!!!!!

This recipe was delicious!  I used a half of an onion instead of a 1/3 cup, and added rosemary in place of the sage.  I also omitted the salt and pepper because it tasted perfectly salty after combining everything else.  I used Shari's organic vegetable broth, too.  Can't wait to taste it again!

This is easily the best gravy I have ever had.  The flavor and consistancy are perfect, however I did add maybe 1/4 cup water to thin it a bit.  No more "brown gravy" packs for us.  I made it for Thanksgiving and will make it again for my carnivorous family for Christmas.  They all love our "veggie" food once they try it.  Yes there is life after meat...

The first time I made this I had to add 3 more cups of broth because it was too thick. The second time I made this I cut the vegetable oil in half and made up for it with butter. Again I had to add 3 more cups of broth but both times it came out very tasty. I made this for my vegetarian wife but the whole family enjoyed it. I would imagine it will be our "go-to" gravy recipe from now on. Oh, and make sure you add the nutritional yeast. It really makes the flavor perfect. It was hard to find in my area but they carry it in bulk at Whole Foods.

Sorry, but I really didn't care for this. I did not have the nutritional yeast, so I don't know if that would have made it better. Since many other reviewers mentioned that this gravy was thick I cut the oil and flour in half. That made the amounts in line with other gravy recipes. Definitely cut these two ingredients or you will have a very, very thick gravy. I think it was the soy sauce that I did not care for. Next time I try this I am going to eliminate the soy sauce and try some other spices, like poultry seasoning. I think it can be worked into something I like, but not as is. Sorry.

With a few variations, this is indeed a five star recipe. I have made it three years in a row for my vegetarian sis-in-law. The first year, I followed the recipe as written and found it WAY too garlicky. Since then, I've reduced the garlic to two nice-sized cloves and it's just perfect. When this recipe was originally published, it called for 1/4 cup of light soy, not four teaspoons. I still make it with that amount and find that no additional salt is needed. In addition, this recipe is for a very, very thick gravy, so I usually add about another cup of vegetable broth to get the consistency I like. I'm a meat eater and I absolutely adore this recipe – I'd recommend it to anyone!

This gravy was delicious! I was so surprised at the use of soy sauce but it really worked. I improvised a bit by using mushroom broth instead of vegetable, and ended up adding about a cup of white wine to thin, and the results were wonderful.

This gravy is very good and easy to make. I decided to half the amount of salt added because soy sauce is salty in itself. Next time I probably won't use any salt. It was very good with Tofu Turkey and I also enjoyed it on mashed potatoes.

Oh, my.  So good.  I used fresh sage (a couple of tablespoons) and added fresh parsley (3-4 tablespoons) and chopped my onions really fine.  I used Better Than Bullion to make the veg broth. I also made this gluten-free by using sweet rice flour.  I guess that has more thickening power than flour because I ended up having to add another cup or cup and a half of water to thin it back to the right consistency.  I did not have the problem some people had with the oil separating, though.  My non-veg, gluten-eating sister preferred this to her turkey gravy at Thanksgiving.  I will definitely be making this again and again.  Thanks for the recipe!

I read all of the reviews and followed much of the advice instead of following the original recipe which I believe would have been quite thick and salty. Hence - the 3 star rating.  I used 1/4 butter & 1/4 cup flour; minced the onion and 2 cloves of garlic and sauteed them with 2 minced button mushrooms; Found the ~4 tsp of nutrional yeast at a natural food store in bulk for 20 cents; Used only 2 T of soy sauce; omitted the salt - used fresh sage, lemon pepper and cayenne to taste; used 2 1/2 cups of veggie broth; It was fantastic!  My carnivore husband really liked it too!

Found this recipe forever ago and have been making it for years.  I use butter instead of oil and as I make this to go with mashed potatoes I use the potato water in place of broth.  I used to make without yeast, but bought it once, and now buy it regularly to add to my veg recipes.  Amazing taste.  Maybe it's b/c I hadn't eaten gravy in years before I found this, but I swear it's better than any gravy I've had.

Delicious! I don't like gravy, but my boyfriend asked if I could try making a vegan gravy for a treat...and he loved it!  We served it up in what we call a "Diner Stack:" a vegan sourdough biscuit on top of hash browned potatoes, all smothered with the gravy with vegan sausage stirred in.  He LOVED it!!!

A few changes I made though: I didn't have sage so I used thyme and I reduced the oil to a little less than 1/4 c. replacing the remaining volume with water or unsweetened soymilk.  I will definitely be making this again. VERY simple....

This is so yum! I made this to go with Christmas dinner and it turned out amazing! The non-vegetarians at the table didn't think it was a veg gravy and I even got asked for the recipe! I did sub butter instead of the oil and did not add the yeast. This will certainly curb my gravy cravings! Could almost pass as a beef gravy! I think next time I might try to add some sautéed mushrooms to it - I think it would be a nice addition. Or maybe use it as a base for a vegetarian stew. This will be a staple around here now :)

What a surprise!  The gravy is good!  But the recipe calls for much too much flour as it thickens the gravy into a heavy mush.  Also, I had no nutritional yeast and it didn't seem to make any difference.  I'd do this again using less than 1/4 cup of flour.

I agree with the other reviews that it is a bit salty, but so was my mom's meat gravy (from what I remember from when I was eating meat).  I was very excited to find something I can use on mashed potatoes, Yorkshire pudding, rice, etc.

variations: I don't have any nutritional yeast, so I left it out.  It worked fine and was very tasty without it.

Just used this for Thanksgiving.  It was good but needed a lot of extra seasoning - I added poultry seasoning extra sage and rosemary.  I used light soy sauce and it wasn't too salty for us.  It just needed to be balanced with other flavors.

This gravy is so, so, so good.  The only things I do differently to the recipe are; more broth (can be a little lumpy without extra broth), more salt (because of more broth) and no yeast.  
This gravy is mouthwatering... I often just have it with french bread!

Great gravy!  I had to add a little more vegetable broth than the recipe stated because it was a little thick but I think the thickness is more of a personal thing than anything.  Very Very good!!!!!

I have been looking for a good vegan gravy recipe, and I'm thrilled to have found this! I made a few changes based on my preferences and what I had on hand.

First, I did not want chunky gravy, so I substituted 1 tsp onion powder and 1/4 tsp garlic powder for the fresh onion and garlic. Instead of using prepared vegetable broth, I diluted 2 rounded tsp of "Better Than Bouillon" vegetable base in 2 cups water. I discovered I was out of sage, so substituted savory. I also used half the amount of salt called for.

The gravy quickly became too thick during cooking (I started with less oil than called for because I was not going to saute onion and garlic), so I added an additional cup of the water and veg base mixture and that worked out just fine. The gravy was rather salty when I tasted it by itself, but it was fine once we put it on our food. Next time I will further reduce the salt.

With the ease of preparation, use of items I typically have on hand, and the authentic gravy taste, this vegan gravy was a very pleasant surprise! I am a BIG fan of gravy, so I will definitely be making this many times in the future. Thank you for posting a real winner of a recipe!

I made this to go with veggie-meatloaf (seitan) and mashed potatoes.  I substituted fake chicken broth (made from Whole Foods fake chicken bouillon cubes).  I didn't have sage, so I just put in some all purpose seasoning.  Tasted great!  Note: this turned out much thicker than other gravy recipes I've used in the past -- this is not necessarily a bad thing but may be useful to know.

This is a delicious gravy that we used as a sauce over egg noodles, addictive!!  I did use one giant garlic instead of the 4 regular and 4 leaves of fresh sage instead of the dried.  This is definitely one of my favorites!

The best gravy I have ever had (vegan or meat-based)! We have been buying packages of vegetarian "chicken" or "beef" gravy...which i am always unsatisfied with. But this gravy is delicious and savory and full of flavor! We just had grilled portabello steaks with steamed vegetables and homemade mashed potatoes with this awesome gravy! Thanks so much, we will use it everytime we want gravy :) **sophie**

What a GREAT recipe! It's tastier than any gravy I ever tried before. Sage gives it nice meaty flavor and gravy turns out nice golden color. It will be my gravy recipe from now on. The only thing I'm going to change is the amount of oil, I'll cut it by half (it was a bit too rich for my taste). Delicious gravy!

I read a lot of the reviews before making this, and so when I give it 5 stars, it's more that I loved the modified version I came up with.  I can guess if I followed it exactly, it would have come out like a gooey paste-like texture.  Here are my mods: 2 tbsp Sunflower Oil, 1/3 cup flour, 2 1/2 cups of vegetarian stock,  fresh Sage, chopped (kept stems for seasoning the stock), and a pinch of Oregano, Thyme, Marjoram, and Rosemary.   I did not add the salt because the stock as well as soy sauce seemed like more than enough salt for me.  I first brought the stock to a boil in a separate pan, and put the seasoning and sage stems in, then turned off the heat.  I removed the sage stems before using the stock.  Once I mixed everything and had a gentle boil and it was thickening, I used a hand blender to make it a smooth gravy (my preference).  It turned out great!  I have been leaning towards becoming vegan, and this was the closest thing I've had that reminded me of the sage sausage gravy my Mom would make for biscuits.  Definitely going to be a staple in our home for holiday dishes.

Nutritional yeast is key to this recipe. If you don't have that, don't bother. I've made this recipe for the last 5 years and no one can believe it's a vegetarian gravy. Always a hit. I do like to blend it up before serving to make a smooth gravy though, and I only use about half the flour.

This is a great recipe of ingredients, but the proportions are way off.  For starters, the combination of nutritional yeast and soy sauce (I actually prefer Tamari) is the vegetarian equivalent of meaty.  So if you aren't going to use these two ingredients - don't bother with this recipe.

Nutritional yeast is an expensive ingredient, so I can see why people will want to omit.  Tip - check out Whole Food's bulk bin section.

Here are some adjustments I made:
1) don't add any salt until the end.  See if it even needs it at the end.
2) use fresh sage
3) cut the oil in half and add more if necessary
4) add flour slowly until you get the consistency you want, may not require full amount.
5) I added ALOT of nutritional yeast until I got a flavor I liked.  Maybe 1/2 - 1 cup.
6) Use some butter instead of oil

Again IMO, this recipe has great ingredients but terrible proportions.  That being said, no one touched the meat gravy when I made this.

So amazingly good. Everyone who tasted it raved about it, and the meat eaters didn't realize it was vegetarian until I ate it, and even then, they were skeptical. Turned me on to nutritional yeast, which has become a staple in my pantry.

I had tried to make vegetarian gravy twice before this - once from scratch (a lot of effort for an ok gravy) and then another time from a packet (it never thickened). I decided that this recipe would be my final attempt at veggie gravy, before giving up. Wow! This is absolutely fantastic! Sooooo quick and easy to make! We had it with Quorn mince and it was just perfect. My boyfriend is not vegetarian and he really enjoyed it too. I left out the nutritional yeast (not really sure if this is any different to 'normal' yeast?) and the sage, as I didn't have any. I'd agree that it needs more of the broth, but other than that, this is absolutely spot-on. I'm so glad I gave veggie gravy a final try with this recipe!

This was really good. Probably the best gravy I've ever made. However, I left out the salt--with the soy sauce it was salty enough! Also, didn't use nutritional yeast (didn't have any), and used beef broth instead of vegetable broth (not a vegetarian). Will make again next year!

Four stars as is, but five after some tweaks. Other reviewers said to use half the oil, and that's a good idea. I used vegetable bouillon instead of stock, and it's quite salty so I omitted the extra salt. I also chopped up what turned out to be a cup and a half (or so) of brown mushrooms, and used low sodium tamari instead of soy sauce. Tasty tasty!

this was the best gravy! I didn't have nutritional yeast, and I didn't have vegetable broth so I used chicken broth, but it was delicious, and no lumps! I made it for my dad, who is sick with chemo, and he thought it was wonderful! Next time I will make it vegetarian.

I made this recipe for my Permaculture class and everyone LOVED IT. I love it too. My friends who are too picky to try anything new took a little taste, and fell in love. I am not vegetarian, nor are most of the students who ate it (with biscuits) yet compliments abounded. 
It is an EASY gravy recipe to follow!! This is the first time I have made gravy and even I coudn't mess it up.
I did follow other's advice and cut the vegetable oil and flour in half. There was no pooling of oil.
I substituted "nutritional yeast" with a tb of cornstarch and added chopped onions.
YUMMMMMYYY. A hearty, tasty gravy. Thank you for posting this recipe it wowed my students and peers.

We have been vegetarians for over 2 years now and this is my first time trying out a gravy--- this is by FAR the best gravy I have ever tasted--meat or otherwise--AMAZING.  I suggest adding at least 1 more cup of water, though!  I added 1/2 cup and it was still too thick, but delicious!  I also added one pinch of rosemary.  Other than that followed it to the tee.  SO delicious.  My husband and 3 year old also devoured it.

Excellent gravy. Like others had said it would have been too thick as is. I used less oil and then forgot to use less flour. I ended up adding about 1/2 cup of water. If I hadn't it would have been too salty. End result is delicious. If I need gravy this is my go-to recipe.

I made this gravy for Thanksgiving. I doubled it, but used only 2 tablespoons of oil for sauteing the onions and garlic. It came out perfect and was so easy to make. Delicious.

I whipped this up after seeing that all "mushroom" gravys in the store contained beef fat - I was loathe to make a gravy, I really don't enjoy the process but this turned out lovely. I halved the recipe (I'm the only veg at my table) but needed about 1.5 cups of broth instead of just one and it's still pretty thick. I also took someone else's suggestion of skipping the oil and using butter instead (I used Earth Balance) - there is no separation of the finished product and it tastes divine! I also skipped the yeast because apparently my supply had been hosting a family in my cupboard and was no longer able to be eaten - oh well... even little beetle-things need to eat on Thanksgiving!!

This gravy is RIDICULOUSLY good. I've been a vegetarian for years, and always felt a little jealous on Thanksgiving as everyone slopped gravy on their mashed potatoes. No more deprivation-- this gravy is fantastic!

Absolutely fantastic!  I followed the recipe to the letter, except I cut back on the garlic just a bit & I used vegan chik'n bouillon + water for the vegetable broth.  It was so easy & quick to make, and the results were just amazingly delicious.  Vegans & meat-eaters alike LOVE this recipe!  It doubles nicely, too.

With Thanksgiving being only days away I had to find a good vegetarian gravy to go with my "turkey". I came across this recipe and decided to test it out today. I didn't have any nutritional yeast or sage so I made it without them. I also substituted olive oil for the vegetable oil, left out the salt and added a little more vegetable broth to thin it out some. The outcome was pretty darn good. It is a very rich gravy with an almost mushroomy flavor. My husband agreed and said it is the best vegetarian gravy he has ever had. The only issue I had with it is that it turns into a thick, sticky glob when refrigerated and you will definitely need to add more vegetable broth when you reheat the leftovers.

I love this gravy recipe! The only changes I made were to use 1/4 cup cornstarch instead of the flour to make it celiac friendly, and didn't add as much salt as asked for.  Next time, I'll cook the onions a little bit before adding the garlic, since I ended up burning the garlic this time. Thanks for the great recipe!

EXCELLENT recipe!  After purchasing vegetarian gravy from Whole Foods every Thanksgiving, I decided to give it a try and make it myself.  This recipe is both delicious and easy.  I omitted the yeast and used two tablespoons of soy sauce.  I also sauteed mushrooms.   YUM!

What can I say except,"YUCK"!! Maybe I just didn't prepare it right. I cut down on the oil as suggested, and had to add more broth. What I came out with was a disaster. I looked like chuncky peanut butter and tasted awful.Plus the consistency was never quite right. I'm glad so many people enjoyed this recipe. Maybe I can try it again and hope to come out with a better result, as I am really desperate for a good vegan gravy.

Good recipe, but not for me, I am a carnivore and I made it for my wife and her family who are vegetarians. I thought it was pretty good at first, aside from it being too thick, I forgot to reduce the oil and flour which I too would suggest. But the next day my brother-in-law decided that a can of Cream of Mushroom soup was a better choice and after trying that as well I would have to agree, that is great for me though! Next time its CofM soup for the Vegsters and I'll be making some real gravy for myself.

Delicious! We have a meat eater, two vegetarians and a vegan in our household and everyone liked this gravy.I didn't add any salt and doubled amount of broth. I used the gravy for my vegan salisbury steak recipe I found on line Here's the link. It is super good. Just a note, I increased the amount of onion and garlic powder and just fried the patties in an oiled pan until it was browned. Then topped with the yummy gravy. http://www.veganmeat.com/rec/steak.html

This gravy was awesome.  Tastes even better then greasy meat gravy!  It was thick so I added extra veggie broth.  I had never heard of nutritional yeast before, but I easily found it at the bulk food store for pennies (literally).  I think that is the secret ingredient that makes this gravy so good.

I've never had much success with gravy until this recipe! It's a bit tricky, whisking out the lumps, but that's gravy. The flavour is superb, however! I've no idea what nutritional yeast is, so I left it out. I was uncertain about the soy sauce too, but it really does work. I have also tried this recipe adding the juice from my Thanksgiving turkey and it was wonderful.

you should bill this as the "drippings-free homemade gravy" too!  it's wonderful for vegetarians, but it's staying in my recipe box cuz this is so hard to screw up, and you can make it without any roast turkey sitting around!  I love this.

This is my go-to vegetarian gravy recipe... Changes that I’d make: use 3 Tbsp of soy sauce, 1/4 cup of flour, and no additional salt or the yeast, otherwise it’s super thick and salty. I also don’t add all of the flour at once. Instead, I sift the flour and add the broth as needed to avoid clumps.

This was delicious ! But I made some changes. Firstly, like everyone else, I added more vegetable broth because it was WAY too thick as is. 
I also added a can of mushrooms, and instead of soy sauce I used worcestershire sauce (I do eat fish and it has anchovies in it, so don't add it if you're a strict vegetarian) along with just one tbs of soy. Served it over mashed potatoes with some veggie breakfast sausages and green beans. SO GOOD!!!

Going by the other reviews, I halved the fat and the flour.   I actually used vegan margarine and potato starch.  Cut the garlic by about half and went with mushroom broth--tricky to find, but I think worth it. Subbed white cooking wine for half of the soy sauce.  I think Frontier brand nutritional yeast is noticeably better than others I've tried, so I used that.  (No financial connection.)  I am wild about the taste of standard store-bought poultry seasoning, so I put a scant teaspoon of that in, instead of sage and pepper, and no salt.  The result was a minor miracle of flavor for a gravy without turkey drippings.  I know it sounds like I barely used the recipe at all, but without the yeast, soy sauce, and fresh sauteed onion from the recipe, I never would have gotten nearly as good results.  In fact, I doubt that I would have attempted it.  Thank you so much, Becky, for sharing.

Read the other comments and only used 1/4 cup olive oil.  Also used 1/4 cup gluten free flour. Turned out fabulous!

I made it for my non-vegan family on Thanksgiving and they LOVED it. I just made it again for Christmas, by request :D which all Vegans hope for! I did as another reviewer suggested and used Rosemary since I didn't have sage. I used regular Soy Sauce, not Light, so I didn't add salt because it was way salty enough. I used Better Than Boullion  and it was tasty. Can't give enough stars.

it turned out to be the most delicious gravy. I half-ed the recipe. I did use butter instead of oil, and i did brown the flour before adding liquids. Also, i ended up adding another 1/2 water to make it thinner.  I also left out sage. Perfect.

This gravy is awesome!!  I have been a vegetarian for 7 years and thought my gravy days were over, but I am thrilled to say...gravy is now a regular treat! I did make a small change that made it taste more like roasted turkey gravy.  The first time I made it,  I didn't have lite soy sauce, so I only put 3 tablespoons in the recipe. Although it was very good, I thought it had too much soy sauce in it. The next time, I cut it back to 2 tablespoons of soy sauce and added a couple of dashes of liquid smoke (just a small amount) and wow....it was the best gravy I have ever tasted!! My family (who are not vegetarian) asked me never to make a different type of gravy.

This gravy was a great substitute for turkey gravy!  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, light tamari sauce instead of light soy sauce, and I did not add the nutritional yeast.  Delicious!!

I had to add a ton of water and then wine to try and break the extreme soy flavor!

My thanks to all of the other reviewers. I took your recommendations and incorporated the following changes: 1/4 cup veg oil; 1/4 cup flour; no nutritional yeast; 3 tablespoons light soy; 1 1/2 cups veg broth; no extra salt. Used a sifter while adding the flour and ended up with no lumps.

Based on reviews, I only used 1/4 cup each  of olive oil & flour and I reduced the soy sauce to 2 Tablespoons.  I also added 1/2 cup of white wine just before adding in the broth, as well as some thyme.  If the gravy is too thick, just thin it out with additional broth... I added an extra cup.  The result was delicious! Best gravy I've ever made!

Very good veg gravy.  I did add another cup of broth to thin it a bit and I like my gravy smooth, so I used a stick blender to process the entire batch and it turned out great.  Will definitely be making it again and again.

This recipe is awesome!!! I didn't use 1/2 cup of oil because I am the only one eating this, so I decreased the oil, flour and the veggie broth and added chopped fresh sage, only because I love it, and I used everything else and it was fantastic.  Put in a bag of meatless meatballs and this is what I will be taking to Christmas dinner for me - the others can eat their turkey. Love, love, love it.  Thank you for a very fantabulous recipe.

This was great!  Flavorful and very comparable to the classic gravy I remember from my meat-eating past.  I lightly sauteed a whole onion (I really like onions) and garlic, and then pureed it in the blender with the remaining ingredients, minus flour.  Then I heated the mixture on the stove in a saucepan and added the flour last.  A 1/2 cup makes a super thick gravy.  I also subbed sage for poultry seasoning and nixed the nutritional yeast, but only because I didn't have any.  It turned out fabulously, and my dad said, "wow that's almost better than mine..."

This was my table gravy for T-giving last year. Absolutely delicious. Doubled quite well. But the original non-doubled recipe does call for 1/2 cup of oil, which was WAY too much.  I did not add any more oil when doubling the recipe. I will use this recipe again this year.

Delicious! Thanks for all the reviews, here are the alterations I made per the recommendations made. 1/4 cup butter, sauteed the onions, garlic and about 1/2 cup of chopped mushrooms. Omitted the salt completely and halved the soy sauce. Didn't have nutritional yeast, so substituted parmesan cheese. My mashed potatoes will never go gravy-less again!

I made this to go with vegetarian shepherds pie for the 3 kids I look after, 4 7 and 8.  They gobbled it up and raved about how much better it is than regular gravy.  It makes lots so I think I am going to try out for some poutine later on in the week.  I didn't add any extra salt because I used bouillon cubes instead of broth.  I also used tamari sauce instead of light soy sauce and left out the sage and black pepper.  I added an extra cup of water though in order to get my desire constancy.  Turned out great overall!

Tasty, but difficult to mix the flour without it clumping. Due to this problem, I ended up ising an entire can of vegetable broth. Came out tasty anyways.

I have never made gravy before and this is DELICIOUS!! :) A must try. I am not a vegetarian...it doesn't taste any different from "regular" gravy. Quick, easy and oh so tasty. As for consistency it was a little thick so I just kept adding vegetable broth...it's perfect. Thank you so much!!

Really good, but wayyy too salty. I am going to halve the soy sauce next time and not add any extra salt. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, low sodium soy sauce, and omitted the sage since I didn't have any. Besides the overpowering saltiness, this recipe was really easy to make and delicious.

for a longtime vegetarian it was a treat to have such delicious gravy again.. i made this recipe with a few changes - instead of yeast i used some cornstarch, and instead of sage i used basil. i also didn't use nearly as much salt as requested, and i think next time i will cut back a wee bit on the soy sauce. it was slightly too salty for me. but it was excellent!

This gravy was AMAZING. Perfect vegan alternative, rich and delicious tasting. Like most people though, I found it a little too thick but if you just add some more water to it you are good to go!

AWESOME recipe. I added some seitan chorizo to make it chunkier (I was making biscuits and gravy), but it wasn't necessary. I used a bit less salt because my broth was salty.

YES, another satisfied Thanksgiving customer! I omitted the soy-sauce, but only because of one guest's soy issues, and it was still perfect.  I used broth from a carton (not overly "distinctive" .. or salty like broth in cubes or jars can be) and WONDRA sauce & gravy flour, which is my lump-free secret.

Excellent flavor!  My friends didn't believe that this was vegetarian.  I gave it 4 stars because I had some trouble with the flour clumping.  Next time I think I'll add the flour after the broth, so that it can dissolve more effectively.

I have to say I was shocked at how good this was. I did reduce the oil and flour to 1/3 cup each. I also used chicken broth (I know, I know, it sort of defeats the point...) and I found it to be a little too salty this way. Next time I will either go for reduced-sodium broth, or skip the additional salt. Still - fantastic!

This was really delicious!  I used un-chicken broth instead of vegetable broth, omitted the salt and used poultry seasoning instead of sage because that's what I had on hand.  Thank you for the wonderful addition to our Thanksgiving dinner!

The flavour of this gravy is absolutely delicious! I thoroughly enjoyed it! IT is however, EXTREMELY think. I always had to add water when I was reheating it.

Turned out very good with a couple of changes- used 1/3 cup of olive oil to 1/3 cup of flour, as some suggested doing so it wasn't too thick. Also cut the garlic down to about 3 large cloves, as 5 seemed like a lot, even though I love garlic, I have been known to ruin things with too much garlic! I increased the broth to about 4 cups, and decreased the soy sauce to 3 tbsp braggs as it seemed quite salty already with the broth. Added extra sage too, as well as about a 1/2 cup chopped mushrooms- yummy! Great consistency in the end. Was a blob of jelly the next day, but nothing a little water and heat couldn't fix. I will make this again!

Thanks so much Becky.  As a new vegetarian (about a month), I faced my first real meat craving the other night.  I really wanted some comfort food and my mind went right to brown gravy and hamburger.  Instead, I made your gravy and it was excellent.  
The only thing I added, that other posters have also said, was about a cup of water.  This gravy got really thick, really quick.  However, the taste was excellent and it satisfied my craving.  Thanks!

This gravy is incredible! You can find the Nutritional Yeast at Whole Foods and It really makes this gravy divine! I recommend you do use it. I made this gravy with my vegetarian Thanksgiving meal and everyone loved it and they are all meat eaters.  I made a double recipe and we ate it all, we made another batch the next day! I added a couple cloves more of garlic and if i recommend a garlic press you want the garlic to almost melt into the gravy.  The Key is to constantly stir! Keep extra broth on hand if you over cook it will get very thick but you can add more broth to get it the consistency you want it. it does start to separate when it sits too long so serve immediately!

I love, love, love nutritional yeast - based gravys! I made this to go with buscits & gravy and it was awesome. For personal preferences, I made the following changes: lightly roasted the flour in the pan before adding the yeast (increased to 1/3 cup), then added the 1/2 cup of fat, by using 1/4 c oil & 1/4 c butter. I subbed braggs for soy sauce as a healthier option and reduced that by about a tablespoon. I added about a tablespoon of mince garlic, but no onion because I was out. I also ended up adding a little more water as I went along in order to get the consistency that I wanted. Yum!

Delicious recipe!  It was a huge hit with both my vegan and meat eating family members.
I deviated from the recipe slightly and used potato water and bullion to make the broth with great results.  I recommend using a little less soy sauce than the recipe suggests, but then I was using full soy, not light.  Otherwise it was fabulous.

This is a mighty fine basic recipe for vegetarian gravy. I didn't have nutritional yeast on hand, so I left it out.  The flavor was great anyway.  I replaced half the oil with butter and did not have the oil pooling problem some of the other reviewers mention. Also, I will use half the amount of flour called for next time.  Using the amount called for in the recipe left me with a gravy jello once the gravy cooled.  I had to reheat it and whisk in an additional can of broth to thin it out enough to serve.

I LOVED this recipe! The only changes I made were to leave out the yeast because I couldn't find the right kind at the store, and I used butter instead of oil. Yes, as other reviews have said, it turned out really thick, but I like thick gravy, and the taste was DELICIOUS.  My grocery store does not carry any plain vegetarian brown gravy, so I'm very happy to have found this recipe to use for my vegetarian husband. Thank you, Becky!

I've made this gravy twice over the holidays. It's a great alternative to meatie gravy that goes well with a slice of Tofurkey or turkey! The only tweak I made was I added 2 1/2 to 3 cups of veggie broth. (Personal preference for fluid gravy.)

I liked it just as well as the perfectly executed turkey gravy we had at Thanksgiving.  I made it so the vegetarian at the table would have something to smother all over his mashed potatoes and stuffing.  I did add some mushrooms to the saute.

Update: Not sure what I did last time but I made this again and it was FANTASTIC. Maybe it was the broth I used, but this time I used some "no chicken" broth instead of vegetable and OMG...perfection. Used it on some mashed potatoes and vegan turkey cutlets. So yum!

Old review:
this was a last minute recipe for me and i thought it was only average. it just wasn't flavorful enough. i guess it's a good base, but if i make it again i will def season it differently.

Delicious! This got great reviews from everyone on Thanksgiving. I halved the amount of oil called with apparently no ill effects. I didn't have light soy sauce so used regular and then omitted the salt. It was plenty salty with just the soy sauce and I was afraid it was too strong, but with mashed potatoes was perfect.

4 tbsp soy sauce is WAY too much, in my opinion. I used only 3 tbsp and it was still overpowering. overall, it's a great starting place for vegetarian gravy. next time I'll try 1-2 tbsp of soy sauce.

Great flavour, but a bit thicker than I was aiming for. I would definitely make this recipe again though, and perhaps add more veggie broth. I took it to Thanksgiving dinner and it was gone wayyy before the turkey gravy!

This gravy was beyond excellent!  The closest to real gravy I have ever tasted.  I did have to add some water to it after it thickened a lot.  Nutritional yeast is key.  Will make this frequently!

This is a really tasty recipe- much better than any vegetarian gravy you can buy in the store and easy to make. I have made it a few times and I made some changes. I didn't like the big chunks of onion in the gravy, so now I grate the onion instead of chopping it. I also used vegan margarine instead of oil, more vegetable broth, added some herbs de provence, and omitted the extra salt.

This recipe was very easy to execute and worked out really well.  A lot of the guests at Thanksgiving liked it better than the meat gravy. I was happy to find an alternative that I could enjoy with the rest of the meal.

My husband and I are both vegetarians and love this recipe.  I serve it with tofurkey or over breaded tofu.  This recipe keeps well in the freezer, as long as you divide it into several small containers.

I made this as is once and found it too salty and thick and, since then, made the suggested changes (halved the oil, used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, cut out the salt, doubled the liquid) and it turned out great.  I've also added sliced mushrooms and have used vegan 'no-chicken' broth instead of regular vegetable broth for a more traditional flavor.  It's a great gravy recipe for those of us who have gone without for ages!  Thanks!

As written, I think this recipe is too salty and too thick. 4 Tablespoons of soy sauce on top of 1/2 teaspoon of salt seems like way too much salt to me. I used 3 tablespoons of soy sauce and didn't add any salt at the end, and I used 3 cups of broth. When I made it this way, the recipe turned out really well. I will definitely make it like this again.

this was a hit at our tofurkey thanksgiving, and with a couple changes will be a yearly staple. first, definitely lose the salt, it is by far salty enough from the soy sauce. second, saute some chopped mushrooms with the onion, and you've got a gravy to die for!

This recipe was a huge hit at the holiday dinner potluck I brought it to! Vegan, vegetarian, and meat-eaters alike were looking for things to dip into it and pour it onto by the end just to scoop more of it up. I added mushrooms (which I food processed), Italian herbs instead of sage, and Bragg's liquid aminos, a delicious healthy alternative to soy sauce, and no yeast. It was wonderful. I've promised my partner to make it again for our holiday dinner.

This recipe rocks!! The meat-eaters loved it too. I only used half the amount of vegetable oil and added butter instead so the oil wouldn't separate. I omitted the yeast and it worked out great.  I also used  slightly more soy sauce than called for and nearly doubled the amount of broth because the gravy was way too thick.  This was incredible and I will totally use this recipe again.

I made this over the weekend testing it for Thanksgiving.  My 19 year old son recently went vegetarian but still wanted gravy for Thanksgiving,this was wonderful!  My husband came in from yard work and wanted to know what I was cooking, then he couldn't get enough of it!  Thanks for the great addition to our Thanksgiving menu.

This is THE BEST veggie gravy recipe in the entire universe.  My partner and I have been looking for a good vegetarian gravy recipe for a long time now, as most of them seem to be kinda difficult or have mushrooms, etc., in them (which he hates) but we both love this one sooooo much.  It's good on absolutely anything and everything.  And it's simple and quick to make.  LOVE it!

The reviews for this were really good so I thought I'd try it and it was!  While I was cooking it I was like "this looks so gross, like lumpy peanut butter" so when I put it on the dressing I used it sparingly but after I tasted it I went back for seconds and thirds!

Best gravy I've had since going vegetarian a year and a half ago. I think the soy sauce really makes it and gives a depth to it. I've tried a few other recipes that haven't turned out great, but this one is a winner for sure and I intend to use it any time I make gravy!

Really yummy!  I thought it was perfect.  My husband thought it was a little bit too thick & plans to add more broth next time.  My daughter initially thought it tasted too much like soy sauce, but the flavors married nicely after a few moments.

This is the BEST vegetarian gravy. I replaced the oil with unsalted butter and even the carnivores at Thanksgiving loved it! It pairs super well with Gardein Lightly Breaded Turk'y cutlets (which comes with a frozen gravy, but I don't care for the taste of that one). Thanks for the recipe!! Definitely using this in the future.

Just made this for my husband's pre-thanksgiving. It's his favorite holiday! I made it with vegetarian Better than Bullion. Mine came out too thick and too salty. I didn't have all my ingredients prepped so it got too thick to quickly. I also used full sodium soy sauce plus the salt that it called for, and 2 tablespoons of jarred minced garlic. I had to make this because the one my husband made didn't come out so great. It saved pre-thanksgiving and I even have some left over for actual Thanksgiving! Might thin it out with more broth or water to fix the salt and thickness. Definitely adding to our favorites.

This is a fantastic gravy! I used 1/4 c butter and 1/4 c canola oil. I used more onion and only two large cloves of garlic. I didn't add salt. I didn't use sage because I'm not a huge fan of it, but I do feel like the gravy needed a little something. Maybe more black pepper (which I already upped) or paprika? I'm definitely keeping this recipe! My husband said it was some of the best gravy he's ever eaten - and he's from the Midwest!

I didn't measure anything but I followed the recipe by eye and it was fabulous.  The only change I made was decreasing the amount of soy sauce (I didn't have lite) and using granulated garlic since I didn't have fresh.

This recipe has won a place in my Hall of Fame.  I will be taking it to holiday dinners in the future.

Great and simple recipe. Meat-eaters thought this was chicken-based gravy. The difference was the sage. As others commented, no salt required and cut the oil in half. Tip: slowly add the liquid in small amounts while whisking to ensure the flour gets well incorporated otherwise you'll end up with clumps.  If that happens, use an immersion blender to get rid of the clumps.

I have never experienced a meat gravy that made me feel as delighted as this  veggie option- taste buds were flying on stars! Best vegetarian gravy I’ve ever had! Perfect with Quorn Roast and/or mashed potatoes. Perfect!!! Do NOT forget the sage! It adds the exact element you need for the flavor to turn out perfectly.

This is a wonderful gravy especially delicious on mashed potatoes! I use it on my seitan chickn fried cutlets and it is out of this world!  I cut back on the garlic cloves, omitted the salt, added a heaping tbls of mushroom powder and used my immersion blender after it was done cooking to make the onions, garlic and mushroom bits smaller.  Definitely my favorite gravy recipe!

I LOVE THIS GRAVY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I add my homemade chicken stock, so it's not so vegetarian(sorry!). My very meat-eating boyfriend also loves it!!! I will attempt to make this with homemade veggie stock at some point, but THIS IS MY FAVORITE GRAVY EVER!

I made this gravy for Christmas dinner and it was a massive hit. I did find that it was too thick (not enough liquid).  I think it could use about twice the liquid the recipe states.  I didn't have any sage, so I just left it out.  It turns out you don't need any meat drippings at all to make a great gravy.  This was really really good!

This is the first vegetarian gravy recipe I have tried. It was very easy to make. I would recommend cutting the soy sauce in half. The soy sauce gives it a nice brown color but is too strong in flavor for my taste. Will continue to refine it.

This is beyond excellent. Even if gravy is not that good for you, I would choose this as my number one gravy to go for. It's just a matter of changing the broth around to beef or chicken. I rate it a ten star.

Great recipe! I didn't read the reviews first and it was indeed a little thick, so I thinned it out with some water and a cube of vegetable bullion so the taste would stay as strong. I added some fresh mushrooms with the onions as well. Yum! Also, I didn't have any sage so I just omitted it and it was still delicious!

This is actually vegan gravy! If you're not vegan you can replace the oil with butter for a richer gravy. I used 1/4 cup vegetable oil to sautee my veggies and added 1/4 cup of butter while sauteeing them to avoid burning the butter fat.  I added 1/2 cup of mushrooms in with the onions, which I definitely recommend if you like them! This is a delicious recipe for anyone, vegetarian or not. It is a very thick gravy, and I think maybe 1/3 cup of oil and flour each might make it closer to standard gravy viscosity.

Addictively delicious but thick, reduced the nutritional yeast by half and doubled the broth, as it sat it thickened- needed to be thinned with broth each time we used it.

I made this for Thanksgiving. 3 of the five of us are vegetarians (and most often, the  3 of are vegan). This was amazing! My daughter, used to say, when she was a meat eater, 
"my favorite part of Thanksgiving is the gravy! This year, she was able to have her fill of gravy, and it was DELICIOUS! This recipe is good enough for even the meat-loving person. It is savory. It has depth of flavor. It is so good that we froze the leftovers in small portions so they could enjoy this yummy gravy whenever they want. It ended up being far too thick, so we just added more veggie broth. You'll want to give this recipe a try! Sooooo gooood!

This is the best gravy ever and the fact that it is vegetarian is a huge bonus for my daughter.

Making this right now for a veggie roast I have in the oven. Even when I have a Tofurky at holidays that comes with gravy my daughter will request I make this as well. The only gravy I ever make!

I wanted to  make this a bit healthier.... I used Whole wheat flour.I 1/2 the oil. I did not use Vegetable, used Olive. I used 2 tablespoons of Mckay's  chicken and broth seasoning in 2 cups of water in place of the Vegetable stock. I 1/2 the Soy sauce, eliminated the salt and added an additional cup of water. I did use the sage. I used 5 garlic cloves...it was a tad bit strong so next time I might use 3. I used the gravy over Brown rice.

This gravy was quite good. It made a lot!  In the future I will probably cut the recipe in half and use a little less soy sauce to reduce the saltiness.

Cut the flour and soy sauce in half for a thinner and less salty gravy. Other than that, the flavor is spot on.

Very nice.  I did double the recipe to have gravy left over. I read that the recipe was a little salty, so I replaced one of the cubs of broth with water. Was perfect. Loved it.

This is leaps and bounds above other vegetarian gravy recipes out there. I've been making it for years and both my vegetarian and vegan friends as well as the meat-eaters love it. I think it's even better than meat gravy, at least from what I remember back when I used to eat it!

I used a grapeseed/olive oil blend and 1 Tbs of standard soy sauce.  I also blended it through my Vitamix blender to make it smooth in consistency. It came out excellent. 
Next time around I will add mushrooms to the saute as a variation. I would also consider substituting Worcestershire sauce for the soy sauce. Capers come to  mind too. 
As it is, it is a great gravy recipe.  Enjoy!

**Use Nutritional Yeast**.  If you're wondering if you can do without, you can't; go get yourself to the store.  I have made this twice, and the first time, without the nutritional yeast, it was just mediocre.  I just made it again and what a difference it makes.  Recipe is bomb.  I used homemade vegetable broth and it kicks.  I dropped the oil content a bit and added some extra broth as it was too thick for my liking

wonderful recipe... i did not have the nutr. yeast this time. even without it, it was very delicious. i also replaced the vegetable broth to chicken broth, which changed its 'vegetarian' status. very easy to make. (i used low sodium soy sauce, btw)

I can't believe how good this is!  I made a scaled up amount (4 qts.) for 60 servings for a large dinner and followed the recipe, but adjusted the soy to taste because that can be strong and I only used enough oil to sauté the onions and garlic.  I thickened the gravy at the end with a cornstarch and broth mixture.  This is a keeper for when you need gravy and won't have any pan drippings.

I added veggie broth to it, the recipe itself came out looking a lot like queso. But it tasted amazing. I just wanted the consistency to be different. A little looser and not so thick. But I didn't like the flavor as much when I did this. So I added some more soy sauce and sage. It turned out a littttttle too salty then. Next time I think I would just add the veggie broth. Take out the added salt I did in the beginning. And it would turn out more to my liking. 

It was good overall. The nooch gave it a great taste that I would of never thought of.

Better than traditional gravy! I chopped red onion fairly small, 7 cloves of garlic and used a 1/2 cup butter instead of the oil since my husband and I are vegetarian not vegan. I also just made my own deactivated yeast by toasting a single packet of active dry yeast (2 1/4 tsp) in a small saute pan because I couldn't find it at my local grocery store. I will definitely make this again and again!

I was looking for an alternative to the gravy that comes with the Tofurkey and chose this recipe. So glad I did! I made a few subtitutions due to not having a few things (used onion powder for onion, garlic powder for garlic and the "better than bouillion" fake chicken stock in place of vegetable stock). Did not add any salt. It really was great! Mine came out a tad salty but I think the fake chicken stock was the reason behind that. Totally easy and will now be a staple around here!

I use this every year for my tofurkey, and this year it was the best because I followed other commenters and halved the flour and halved the nutritional yeast. Everything else was the same as the recipe and it was PERFECT. :)

I made according to the recipe with the exception of the light soy sauce, because I didn't have any on hand. I'm not sure how much difference it would make, but as I made it it was fantastic and a big hit around the dinner table, even all the carnivores loved it!

It tastes really good but is way too thick. I'll definitely make it again but probably reduce the flour to 1/4 cup. I also added mushrooms to the onion/garlic mix because I happened to have them and they add a great flavor to gravy.

When a gravy makes you go "daaaaamn" you know it's a winner. 

In the future I might take it a little easier on the garlic, but I'll be using this one a lot. It helps that it's incredibly simple! The most "vegan" ingredient here is that nutritional yeast, which more people should keep in their kitchens anyway.

WOW! I also cut the flour in half and halved the amount of oil (I used butter). This was the most awesome gravy I have ever tasted. The two non-vegetarians that I was cooking for also could not get over how great it was, and actually asked for the recipe. Highly recommended!!!

This was okay. I should have tried it before serving it at Thanksgiving. All you could taste was soy sauce. I even used the lite kind. I followed the recipe exactly. If I was to make it again I would definitely use a lot less soy sauce, or maybe omit it. Even with 5 cloves of garlic all you can taste is soy sauce. I do have to say the texture is spot on. Super smooth, glossy, and it kept well (not very much got eaten so I had a lot of leftover gravy).

I have not tried this recipe yet. I plan to soon but adding Bragg Liquid Aminos (a vegetarian soy sauce alternative). I use it to make gravy because it tastes even "meatier" than soy sauce. The nutritional yeast is excellent for making dishes "cheesier". I use it for making cheese sauce for my vegan friends.

This gravy was delicious tasting.  I made the recipe as is but it was way too thick.  I kept adding water but it still kept thickening up.  Will try again with maybe half the flour and oil next time.

This is terrific gravy! 
After reading the reviews, I only used 2 tablespoons of oil. I added 1 rib of celery, no nutritional yeast and only used 1 glove of garlic. I used immersion blender to smooth it after it cooked. 
Delicious!

Great vegetarian alternative to regular gravy; however, keep extra vegetable stock on hand because it tends to be thick and you might need to add extra stock to thin it out.

I made this last year for a vegetarian at my thanksgiving, she hadn't had gravy and potatoes in over 20 years and was so incredibly happy. I didn't use the nutritional yeast I just made it taste good because that's what I do.

This gravy is delicious!  I discovered this recipe a few years ago, and it has been a Thanksgiving staple ever since!  You can make a big batch of it and freeze some for a later date.  Hint: I get my nutritional yeast in the bulk foods section at Central Market.  You can also get it in the bulk foods section of WinCo.

This gravy is delicious.  I've made it a few times and tweeked it based on the reviews I read.  I reduced the oil and flour to 1/4 cup.  I'm the vegetarian of the family, but my meat eating relatives prefer this gravy over their traditional turkey gravy.  I've also prepared it with mushrooms added to the onion.  Delicious.

We have made this a few years in a row now! It's a big hit here the only things we have changed is adding a no-chicken chicken broth instead of vegetable. And instead of the usual amount of soy sauce we do 2 teaspoons of soy sauce and 2 teaspoons of gravy master!

Delicious and easy!  Some people found it to be thick, but I didn't.  It's supposed to be a paste first and then you thin it out with broth.  It was amazing!  I'm never buying a packet of gravy again!

I learned the hard way that in this recipe, light soy sauce means reduced-sodium. (In the Asian food world, there is "light" soy sauce versus "thick" soy sauce.) The gravy came out pretty salty...but still underneath the salt there was great flavor. I can see how this is a 5 star recipe and I'll make it again...the right way.

I only use 1/3 cup oil and 1/3 cup flour but it still turns out great.  I use this as my go-to gravy for all my holiday feasts!  Even the non-vegetarians love it.

This is the best gravy I have ever had - thick and flavorful. It was definitely worth driving all over town looking for nutritional yeast (I finally found some at Whole Foods). I use it on a dumpling recipe, but I imagine it would be great for holidays as well. Sometimes, I use vegetarian no-chicken broth, instead of vegetable broth, but either way is delicious. At first, I was using low sodium soy sauce in this recipe, but it still came out too salty, so I've cut the soy sauce completely. The gravy can come out a little too thick, but just add more broth until you get the consistency you want.

It's great :) You might like it with a little less flour, to make it thinner.

So yummy! It was more chunky than smooth, but I didn't have yeast or sage and I used powdered broth, so I'm not sure if that had anything to do with it.

Still, it was pretty good, but it could have used a little more flavor.

Amazing flavor!  I had some dried shiitake mushrooms so ground them up and added them for extra umami.  I used about 3 cups of water/broth and consistency was good.

This was good, not fabulous.  I added diced mushrooms.  Apparently I used the wrong nutritional yeast per my vegetarian mother.  I used Brewers nutritional yeast, I guess there is a different kind.  Did not know that!  It tasted good on Thanksgiving day, but not so good as leftovers.

I was always intimidated about me preparing homemade gravy; so this was my 1st time, and to top it off, it is a vegetarian recipe. IT WAS DELICIOUS!!!!!! I just added more water because it was thick enough you could eat it with a spoon (which I did)!!! Smiling....

HUGE HIT! This bold tasting gravy really is magnificent. Even my meat-eating bf complimented on how good it tasted. It did turn out a bit too thick though, but that was nothing that some more broth couldn't take care of. I will be making this every year for Thanksgiving from now on.

It is absolutely delicious. It's not hard to make either. I would add less oil next time because the onions took longer to sauté sitting in so much oil. Plus the oil began separating a little bit after the gravy was made. Still yummy nonetheless!!!

My meat eaters loved this! I didn't have veggie stock so I made some quickly and it didn't take much extra work at all, just a bit of extra time. We added mushrooms for extra flavor. I haven't had gravy since I was a kid so thanks for the rush of memories this brought back. Also, it was the first time my son got to have gravy on his mashed potatoes! Excellent.

Just recently became vegetarian, and we were mourning our first Thanksgiving without gravy. This was one of the best gravies I've EVER had, not just as a vegetarian substitute. I plan on making this again!

This was a hit at Christmas for vegeterians and meat eaters alike. I made some changes: used half the amount of soy sauce, added a tablespoon of tomato sauce and replaced the nutritional yeast with parmesan cheese. Yum!

It was fantastic! I used chickpea flour instead of white flour and used Bragg's amino acid instead of soy sauce. After cooking the gravy I blended it for a smooth silky texture. The meat eaters in the family had no idea it was vegetarian and kept pouring more and more on their turkey and mashed potatoes.

Too garlicky the first time; we also added extra broth and it was still quite thick.  Next time, we'll do less garlic, even more broth. Great starter though!

Alright, so I skipped the yeast and used turkey drippings instead of vegetable broth (I know, not vegan, but I'm not vegan- just looking for a great gravy)and this has to be my favorite gravy recipe.

Best veggie gravy I have tried so far... And I usually try a new one every thanksgiving!  I think my yearly search is over.  Didn't need any additional salt in my opinion.  I used Better Than Bullion vegetarian beef flavor to make the broth.  Came out darker than the photo, but I would recommend it if you are looking for something very savory.  Also substituted butter for the oil, per recommendations, and that too worked beautifully!

I made it tonight for our first vegan Thanksgiving and it was delicious!! I think I overcooked it because by the time dinner was ready it was pretty thick and not pourable. This is the only gravy recipe I'll ever make! Everyone  loved it.

This gravy is great! HOWEVER, I couldn't find nutritional yeast at the store so I just bought active dry yeast. The gravy turned out super thick so I added a cup of water and then I realized I should have used milk. It was still thick so I added a half of cup of milk also. I didn't want to add extra oil because of the fat. I ended up with lots more gravy and it was still thick. It tasted great! My kids love it too. I would add 1 1/2 cups of milk or do what I did so it isn't so thick. Much better than I expected and tons better than the last vegetarian gravy I tried.

Very good!! I have been missing a gravy since I went Vegetarian, and this gravy is PERFECT!! I am a very picky eater, and I also wont eat anything with palm oil (or anything that the ingredients have palm oil, because it destroys rain forest to get it). This is PERFECT!! Thank You!!

I'm vegan and my husband is not, so when I needed a gravy recipe that satisfied both of us this was the perfect choice. I didn't change anything in the recipe but I did forget the black pepper on accident. It was still very good.

I tried to like this, I really did. I made it to go with poutine since I'm a vegetarian. I've made it twice and both times, even with subtle changes, I found it too thick and too oily. It doesn't reheat that well either. I think I will use a beef gravy recipe from now on and just use veggie broth instead. It's also super garlic-y and I'm not overly fond of that.

I thought this gravy was better than any animal-based gravy I've ever had and my omni family agreed! I used 1/4 C each of oil and flour, my onions were minced, I cooked the flour for awhile before adding the other, I used mushroom broth, only a pinch of salt, no sage and a tiny pinch of rosemary.

I have played with this recipe many times and it is absolutely delicious!  I use Pacifica Low Sodium vegetable broth.  I haven't tried homemmade broth yet.  I have never tried the nutritional yeast component, but it's always amazing gravy!  The soy sauce can be omitted in favor of salt, but the soy sauce gives it a more appetizing color.  The only ingredient you really cannot ommit is the garlic.  I love this gravy.  It's a good way to cut down on unhealthy fats.  If you make this with olive oil, it's actually good for you!

Perfect gravy.  I've been a vegetarian for 25 years and this one is the best I've tried.  I'm a careless sort of cook and don't measure carefully and I'm always surprised when something turns out well.  This looks to be a fail-proof recipe.  I did add more onions (because I didn't want to throw away the rest).

This gravy is the best vegetarian gravy I have ever tasted. We use this instead of the Tofurky gravy that comes in the box because this one is creamier and much more delicious!  Definitely a staple in my cookbook!

Excellent. The family loved it. I cooked chicken that didn't generate enough fat to make gravy, so this was the perfect alternative.

I made this for Thanksgiving, and most of our group liked it better than the turkey gravy. I did not have nutritional yeast, and may have accidentally added more sage than called for. The only thing I will change next time is to add less sage, and hopefully will have nutritional yeast on hand to try it the way the recipe was written.

SUPER YUMMY!!  I served it at dry run Thanksgiving dinner with friends and everyone LOVED it, meat eater or not.  I added mushrooms when I sauted the onion and garlic.  I did have to cook much longer as noted by another reader.  I could not find the nutritional yeast so I made it without.  I made 4x the recipe and substituted half of the oil for butter.  Savory, flavorful and a huge hit!

Awesome!  I wanted a vegan gravy, and this was easily veganized by subbing butter for a vegan substitute.  I didn't follow the recipe perfectly - probably used half a cup more broth since I had a big frozen jar, used olive oil instead of vegetable, and added some diced up mushrooms I needed to use up.  It came out exceptional.    The last part of stirring in the flour is key - don't get lazy.  I had to whip it up for a while to get all the flour worked it.  It was still a little thin so I added a touch more and some corn starch.  This is a really good baseline recipe to use - you can totally modify it with certain spices to lend to particular recipes.  It also stood out well on its own.  Reheating is a bit tricky, I found adding a splash of water and stirring it in helped bring back a smooth texture.

I am a vegetarian and have been on an endless trek to find a good veggie gravy.  I was very excited to try this based on its good reviews but I was sooo disappointed.  I tried incorporating the other reviewers tips - using butter instead of oil; cutting down both the butter and flour to 1/4 cup; omitting the salt due to using regular soya sauce...  I'm a big garlic fan but was suspicious about 5 cloves, but, against my better judgement, I went ahead and threw them all in and MAN - it was WAAY too garlicy.  And coming from me, that should tell you something.  It probably didn't need more than 2 cloves.  Even besides that, I thought it tasted a bit "funky".  I may try to play around with this more in the future, but for now I'm back to my powdered organic veggie gravy packets I buy at the grocery store...

I use a lot less oil than listed, because it tends to separate as it cools if you use the full amount.  Still tastes great with less oil, though.  I make this recipe every Thanksgiving, every time I make mashed potatoes, and when I want poutine.  LOVE it.

I was thoroughly impressed with how delicious this tasted. I halved the recipe because I was feeding a small amount of people and the measurements transferred well. I don't really think salt & pepper is necessary, though. And combination Italian seasoning worked just as well.

Absolutely delicious, could never tell it was even vegetarian!  The only thing I would do is cut down on the oil, much to oily.  Maybe cut it in half.

I made this forever ago - for Thanksgiving. There seemed to be a slightly strange flavor, but it was my first vegetarian gravy - so that's to be expected. All in all it was pretty good and it was great over mashed potatoes.

I didn't have the yeast or light soy sauce so i added 3 tbsp regular soy sauce and ommitted the yeast. I also added 1/2 tsp of onion powder and a little extra sage. I made an open face chik patty (morningstar brand SO good) sandwich by toasting whole wheat bread, smothering that with the gravy then adding the chik patty then topping with mashed potatoes and more gravy. Delicious! Tastes great leftover too.

Great tasting, easy to make vegetarian gravy! I increased the onion amount and threw in some garlic too. Nutritional yeast is delicious, but non-existent in my current corner of the world, so I just left that out, no problem. Oh, and just to experiment, I used 2 T soy sauce, and 2 T Worcestershire sauce - it was great with our mashed potatoes and lentil loaf!

This is my third year using this recipe. I've followed it to the letter and I have used it as a guideline for doing my own thing. Either way, the results are amazing. It's definitely for the onion and garlic lover (that's me!) I can't foresee using another recipe again. Delicious!

I made this to smother cheese biscuits with on a really cold day and it really hit the spot!  I did not find the soy taste to be overpowering, but I used Bragg's Liquid Aminos in place of regular soy sauce, anyway.  I only give this four stars because the thickness is too much- I will certainly be making this again but with less flour/more broth.  Great vegetarian gravy!

After reading other reviews, I left out the salt.  I should have cut the soy sauce at least in half as it was still way too salty for me and had too much of a soy sauce flavor.  Would be good with some mushrooms added in.

Thank you for this recipe. My daughter and her boyfriend became vegetarians in early 2009. This recipe, plus a meatless-soyless turkey thing helped make it through the holidays. She is allergic to soy, but can have soy sauce because it's fermented (go figure). Thank you. It's a keeper and on the stove again this Christmas morning.

the gravy is awesome. I am giving it four stars rather than five because it got very thick after sitting out (had to keep adding olive oil) and I read another persons review and used butter.... Also the soy sauce was very promininent.

I used 1/4 cup of olive oil instead of half cup of vegetable oil.  Also, I ran out of soy sauce, so I used two tablespoons of dark miso paste instead.  I thought it looked unsightly with all of the onion chunks, so I pureed it before thickening - it turned out lovely!!

We've been looking for a good vegetarian gravy for a while now, and this fit the bill!!!  My husband loved it!  I did it with less soy sauce and more broth as some of the reviews suggested and it seemed just right.  Might try it with less salt.  The flavor was perfect, everything blended together so well.  Not even hard to make.  Highly recommended!

This is a fabulous recipe!  I only use one clove of garlic, a personal preference, and no nutritional yeast, don't have any!  Next time I will pick some up and try it out.  I also use poultry spice instead of sage. Highly recommend!

Great flavor!  Added about a cup more broth as other reviews suggested, and it was still plenty thick.  Next time I think I'll try adding even more broth to cut the oil content and reduce the salt.

I used 1/4 cup unsalted butter instead of vegetable oil and also less soy sauce.  I never would have imagined that the nutritional yeast (I used Marmite brand) and soy sauce combination would make such good gravy.  All vegetarians at my Thanksgiving dinner were excited to have gravy, so thanks for posting!

Really weird consistency-really thick and pasty. Also, too salty for my taste.

Add a little rosemary.  This was a huge hit at my Thanksgiving pot luck.

Wow, this was delicious! I followed the recipe exactly except I used 2 cups of water and a bouillon cube instead of ready-made vegetable broth. It came out very thick so I stirred in some extra water. I would go easy on the salt also, since the soy sauce will make it salty.

This recipe is incredible! I love love love this gravy! I put it on mashed potatoes and it was super. I used EVOO and Safflower oil instead of vegetable oil...(they are my preferred oils and are always in the house)....

my first time making vegan gravy and after following the recommendations of others, it came out great. i used 3 cups of broth (all i had was spicy tomato broth from the mexican store, but it added some kick!), a little less than half a cup of flour, added mushrooms, and instead of sage, used some dill. delicious for my biscuits hooray!

This was surprisingly good! Even my husband, who cringed when I said "vegetarian gravy", liked it. After you make the roux (that is, adding the flour in and letting it cook a little), grab a whisk and slowly add the broth, whisking away so as not to get a big clump. 

I actually had to add a bit of water because it was very thick. I did not have sage but I had a "poultry seasoning" that had sage in it so I used that.

Defenitely will be using this recipe again. I froze the leftovers, i'm curious to see if it will defrost well.

This turned out on the thick side for me too but the taste was good.  I didn't use any yeast and I used tamari soy sauce.  Not the absolute best I've ever has but it sure beats store bought and with some tweaking it could be great.

I made a modified version of this today:  1/4 cup olive oil (plus a bit of butter), 1 cup of broth, same amount of onion, 2 cloves of garlic.  I also used 1/4 cup of a cornstarch/flour mix (because I ran out of cornstarch, not because I prefer the mix).

I have to say that both my husband and I are VERY impressed with this gravy.  I wish I'd made the whole recipe instead of halving it!  :)

Yummy, very oniony, not as close to "normal" gravy as I expected, but it was still nice. My guests really enjoyed it - much more than I did.  I will continue searching for a better veg gravy.

I loved this gravy.  It's one of the few things I've missed since becoming a vegetarian.  I too had the issue with it becoming very thick but I just added some water and it seemed to turn out fine.  My only issue with this recipe is what seems to me to be an ungodly amount of vegetable oil.  I might try cutting that back next time to see what happens.  Such a great recipe!

This is my favourite vegan gravy recipe, hands-down. The only note I'll make is the same others have made -- you must double the amount of stock listed! Oh, and the quality of your stock makes a big difference -- homemade stock and tetra packs of stock really do make a better gravy than bouillon cubes. 

The recipe makes a fair amount once you double the stock, but the gravy disappears all too fast.

Tastes AMAZING!! Took it into my office with biscuits and it was gone! So good. I made it without only about a tablespoon of olive oil instead of the veggie oil and it was still delicious! Highly recommend!

It turned out okay.... the non-vegetarians didn't even know it was veggie friendly! A little too thick for my liking though... I'll tweak it next time but do plan to make it again!

This is a very good recipe. I had to almost double the broth because it is very thick, but it was good.

Great recipe. I've been working on a vegetarian gravy recipe and there always seemed to be something missing. This was simple and good. I took the suggestions of others and eliminated the salt. Also, since I like a little kick, I used a few shakes of Hot chile oil and a teaspoon of fresh ginger. Finally, I used 2 vegetarian boullion cubes w/ 2.5 cups of water instead of broth.

This is sooooo good!  And even my carnivor husband loved it.  As noted in previous  reviews, I omitted the salt and used only 2tsp.'s of regular soy sause.
