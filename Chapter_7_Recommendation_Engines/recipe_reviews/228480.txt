I really loved these, but I have to agree with the first reviewer that they were too dry.  I ended up using a half cup sour cream instead of 1 tbs mayonnaise, and it was the perfect amount of sauce.  I recommend upping the mayonnaise and adding a little less vegetable.  I ended up with 10 overflowing wraps, and I didn't use the whole head of lettuce or the entire second tomato.  I will definitely make these again, with my adjustments.

Hmm, this kind of just tasted like a dry salad on a tortilla. I followed the directions exactly, just making 2 sandwiches only. The ingredients didn't seem to come together, esp. the green pepper slices. I added some Italian dressing, which helped a little. It's definitely missing something.

I left out quite a few of the ingredients. I mixed the lettuce, tomato, and cucumber together, using only a few lettuce leaves and adding more tomatoes. I was not using large "beefsteak" tomatoes, but instead the smaller plum tomato. I left out the green pepper because I am not a fan. I considered adding celery instead for some crunch. I will try that the next time. Then I just used straight mayo for the spread. Between the mayo and the tomato, I had no problems with it being dry. Yes, it is basically just a salad on a tortilla, but it was different and an easy way for me to get the kids to eat salad. I also plan to use some shredded cheddar cheese the next time as well.

I was very pleased with this simple and light recipe and its ease of preparation.  I served this at a small luncheon and everyone enjoyed.  Fresh and light flavors.

Very good recipe! Quick and easy for lunch. Next time I will not use as much salt, perhaps an 1/4 tsp. I only had the smaller tortillas, so I made them more like a soft taco and I also added Siracha and Thai Chilli Sauce to the avacado sauce. Unlike other reviews, I didn't find them dry at all! In fact, they were quite tasty! Dig in!

Loved the flavors!!! It made a lot of stuff to roll into an 8 inch wrap, even after dicing my pepper and cucumber.   I used whole wheat tortillas and didn't add salt since the mayonnaise and tortilla already contain salt.  I wrapped the leftovers in tin foil, stuck them in the fridge; I must admit, I liked them better the next day.
