This is a wonderfully tasting, moist and delicious chocolate cake. My entire family raved about this cake. I did a couple of things different- used all butter (no shortening) and used all purpose flour instead of self-rising flour. Next time I will only use half of the frosting... I love frosting, but this cake didn't need that much. I might even try a sprinkle of powdered sugar on top instead of frosting all together.

I baked this in cupcake form and they came up round and crisp at the top, moist and fluffy in the middle. They're just as good, if not better the next day. My guests couldn't stop eating them!

Okay, the frosting made the very top of the cake taste good, but the rest of the cake was dry, crumbly, and could not possibly be served to a guest.  I keep re-reading the recipe, to see if I did something wrong, considering the previous review, but I followed it to a tee, and generally have excellent success with cakes.

This recipe came out great, and I am not a baker at all!  The only thing I did differently was add more cocoa powder to the icing.

Made this tonight in a 9X13 pan and followed recipe exactly.  It is just right...moist and light crumb.  Had to use AP flour w/baking powder + salt as I don't keep SR flour.  This cake would be fine with only a powdered sugar dusting as topping but I went ahead and used the Vanilla-Chocolate Powdered Sugar Frosting from this site.  I've eaten two large squares of cake already which I really have no business doing.  But it is soooo good!!!  This will be my go-to chocolate cake recipe from now on.  Thank you for sharing, Denise.  Photo doesn't do it justice.

I'm really rather torn on how to review this recipe. I'm sitting here with a mess of a cake, but the mess tastes delicious! I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of splitting the batter between two 9 inch cake pans. When I went to flip the cakes out of their pans, everything went south! The cakes completely fell apart, and I'm left with a terrible mess. I made this cake as a test run for my friend's baby shower, and boy am I glad I didn't wait until the last minute! Since the cake still tastes fine, I plan on letting my family eat it instead of just throwing it out. I would probably make the cake again, but only in a 9x13 or as cupcakes. The taste is good, but it turned out a little disastrous, which never happens to me when I bake. I also agree with those who said the cake could be served just fine with a dusting of powdered sugar instead of a thick frosting. It's sweet as is!

This is such an easy cake to make.  Unfortunately I live at high altitude, so the first time I tried this the cupcakes sort of exploded and fell at the same time.  I made these alterations and the second batch are perfect!  
Add 2 tbsp Water
Add 1 more Egg
Use All Purpose Flour instead of Self-Rising
Decrease Sugar by 2 tbsp 
Take a pinch out of the tsp Baking Soda  

Makes 24 cupcakes and bakes in 15 mins.

I made this cake for my brother's anniversary cookout yesterday...I had no trouble with the cake staying together at all! I baked it for 28 minutes not the 30-40 listed in recipe and I only used half of the icing..It was yummy and the recipe is super easy!

This recipe turned out great! I made it for my mom's birthday, and after I had gotten the ingredients, she told me she wanted a yellow cake instead, so I didn't add the cocoa to the cake, but I added 1 tsp vanilla, and 1 tsp butter flavor (love that stuff!). I liberally sprayed Baker's Joy non-stick spray to my two 9 inch rounds, and let them cool for about 10 minutes before removing them from the pans. They turned out great! No sticking, no falling apart. I ended up using buttermilk in the icing as well as the cake, and used 3 tsp before it was the right consistency, but it smoothed onto the warm cakes like butter. I decorated with pecans instead of adding them to the icing. Will definitely make this cake again. Looking forward to trying the chocolate version!

I grew up on this cake but my mom called it "Ann's Chocolate cake"  and she and I just do everything in the sauce pan.  Why mess up a bowl?  Sometimes I use leftover coffee instead of water and it's very yummy.

I'm not normally a chocolate cake person, but my boyfriend is so I have baked this cake for his birthday the past two years (with my own chocolate buttercream frosting recipe), and both of us just love it!  So moist and delicious, and not overpoweringly chocolate-y.  Easy to make, too.

I make this cake ALL the time and my whole family loves it.  If I take it somewhere, I am asked for the recipe.  Be sure to save it to your favourites because the MMMmmm part of the name makes it tricky to find again!   The icing is deliciously fudgy and, as other reviewers have mentioned, it tastes even better the day after baking.  I have substituted buttermilk for Homo and also 2%, no problem.  Also, don't be put off by the 'self rising flour' requirement...just use a simple recipe that can be found on this site to make your own! (2 cups flour,  1 tsp salt, 3 tsp baking powder)

Great recipe. It's light, fluffy, not too sweet. I made some adjustments, replaced the shortening with butter and made half the amount of icing from the advice of other reviewers. I will make all the icing next time. I like icing. I took mine out after 30 minutes so it didn't dry out and it's perfect. YUM!
