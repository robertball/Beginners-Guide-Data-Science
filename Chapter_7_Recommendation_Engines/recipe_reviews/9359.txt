For some reason I've been craving Christmas treats a little early this year so I made this late last night.  I didn't have the whipping cream for the filling so I sprinkled instant coffee granules in cool whip and used that.  I went ahead and used 5 eggs instead of 3.  I have another recipe that I used along side this one and it called for 5 eggs.  I loved the outcome.  It was so yummy, though time consuming but a lot cheaper than buying one from a bakery (even though their not available this time of year).  Thanks for sharing.

This a great recipe! The chocolate is not overpowering, and if you plan ahead and read the recipe before starting, it isn't messy. I sprinkled the whip cream with chai spices, and the hint it gave the whole dessert was amazing!

The frosting was the challenge I was nervous after reading all the reviews. I gave it a try and it turned out perfectly!  I think the key was stirring it until it came to a boil. It set up just fine once it cooled off. This recipe had plenty of chocolate flavor. It was a hit at Christmas Eve dinner.

The frosting never set for me so I ended up whipping the frosting in my Kitchenaid after letting it try to set for like 16 hours.  The cake could be a little sweeter IMO but the end result is very pretty.  I might try again around Christmas but my husband wanted this for his birthday in September.

I loved this recipe, it was very easy to follow. I plan on it becoming an annual bake. I may try a different filling next time. My first rolled cake came out very well.

I kept everything exactly the same, and I wouldn't make it again. I found it bland, and the frosting didn't set. I ended up having to chill the frosting for ages, and then whip it. It was still too runny. The frosting needed way more flavour
