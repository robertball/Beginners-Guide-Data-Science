Made this tonight with Tasty Tuna Burgers as another reviewer suggested- absolutely delicious! Can't wait to make the combo again, but could definitely imagine using this with a number of other recipes.

I made this for my fish tacos. My husband won't eat fish without tartar sauce and the first thing he said was "forget the tartar sauce!  I want this from now on."  Now I am making it again tonight for baked cod.  Great recipe.  Thanks for posting.

This was so good!!!! I used it on salmon burgers one night and mahi mahi burgers another night. The only question I have is how long can I keep it in the refrigerator?

This has great flavor with earthy tones from the ground cumin. This would be good on fish tacos.

I didn't have any limes on hand so instead I used two tablespoons of lime juice. Also, I didn't have cilantro on hand but I did have cilantro paste, I used a little less than 1/3 cup of that stuff. The aioli came out tangy and delish.

Absolutely delicious! Made as written with the addition of the lime zest. Served with baked sweet potato fries for dipping. 
This would be a great sauce for any summertime pasta salad, wraps, sandwiches, etc.

Holy moly! This sauce was bomb. Definitely lick the spoon sauce. I only made the recipe as is the first time and it was gone within minutes. Made yucca fries with it and used that as a dip. So so good. You definitely need to double it because you can use this stuff on so many things.

I made one small revision and added a full avocado, a bit more lime, cuman, salt and cilantro and I have to say, this was absolutely delicious.  This is probably my favorite recipe on this site for quite awhile.  With the avocado, it looked like a shamrock shake and was almost as good only savory.  This would go on just about anything.  This will be my go to sauce for several recipes.

This stuff is crazy good! Made chicken, avocado, and mushroom quesadillas with extra sharp cheddar and drizzled this sauce over them. DELICIOUS! Definitely a keeper.

Great recipe, drizzled it over crock pot pork shoulder and it was delicious. Didn't have coriander or dill, but it was good without it. Used half fat free Greek yogurt and half olive oil mayo to cut down on the fat.

We didn’t have quite the amount of cilantro. Used a Ring-of-fire pepper from the garden. It was delicious. Thanks for the inspiration!

We were looking for a good egg-free topping for fish tacos and this really is fantastic! Made a few slight changes:
Increased garlic to 2 cloves, used 1/8 cup sour cream instead of all mayo and used egg-free mayo. Also, added 1 tablespoon of Sriracha sauce, and increased salt to 1/2 teaspoon, and added sprinkle of paprika. For measurement purposes, used 2 tablespoons of fresh lime juice.

The name says it all! I made this as a sauce for the best margarita chicken recipe (on this site as well). Can’t wait to try it on fish tacos, salmon, and anything else I can think of.

This is literally lick the spoon good! Addictive even. I’ve made this recipe twice for tacos, and have loved it every time. First was with fish tacos for friends (they raved) and then again with a basic pulled chicken (lightly seasoned with chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, salt and pepper): amazing. Can’t recommend this enough!

5 stars all the way! I added a little extra cilantro, I used about a full cup of the leaves. Soooo amazing! I was trying to copy the cilantro mayo from a highly rated taco place I went to in Hollywood Beach, FL. THIS ACTUALLY SURPASSED IT! I could drink it, it’s that good lol

Amazing!! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!  a few small changes since I left just a little membrane on my pepper for just a little "kick". Plus added 2 cloves of  garlic instead of 1 1/2. zested the lime per another suggestion, and added a pinch or two of some Paprika Lemon and Lime spice blend. Plan on serving with Zuchinni latkes this evening.

I made this for fish tacos.  I loved the sauce.  I think it makes a decent coleslaw dressing as well.  I followed the recipe exactly at first, but I wanted more heat when it was done so I added a few dashes of cayenne.  It is also good with a little greek yogurt stirred in for tang.  I will use this again.

So easy and delicious! The taste  reminds me of the Mediterranean veggie sandwich from Panera. Lots of flavor.  Will make again.

Great recipe! Used it in coleslaw for fish tacos and also added more to fish for extra moisture.  Will definitely make this again and try it with other proteins.

Delicious!!! The ingredients are excellent and is not super spicy but with the  amazing flavor of the jalapeno pepper. I love cilantro so  there's no more to say but that is really, really  good. We had it with raw vegetables and chicken wings.

This aioli is amazing! We used it for fish tacos and it was the perfect combo. Left the jalapeño seeds and membrane for added kick. Didn't have olive oil mayo so I used regular mayor and added about 2tsp olive oil for flavor.

so good!  Now my shrimp and fish tacos are better than restaurant quality, according to my husband.  :) Made it as written many times. I have used regular mayo as well as the olive oil mayo and couldn't really taste a difference.

Lick the spoon is incorrect. It's more like tip the bottle and eat it all. I'm not a regular rater of recipes but this was just too good. I am a BIG fan of cilantro so I had to try this. I made it with the cilantro lime chicken tacos that you make in the crock pot from this site and it was to die for with angle hair cabbage slaw some chopped avocados, tomatoes, and just a bit of shredded monterrey jack cheese on a soft flour tortilla. I almost added the juice from the other half of lime and I almost used half sour cream in place of all mayo. I'm so glad I made it as is or I wouldn't have known exactly how good this stuff is. I also thought it would be hot but not at all. Of course I didn't add the seeds or ribs from the jalapeno either. If you are a fan of cilantro, trust me you will love this!

Loved the flavor. I didn't bother to chop anything just threw it all in the Ninja blender. Quick, easy, and creamy. Served on top of fresh fish tacos.

this stuff would make a leather shoe taste delicious. I put it on chicken and fish tacos. delicious. only thing I tweaked was less cumin (not a fan) and way more jalapeños. also letting it sit in fridge for a few hours before serving  is key to marrying all the flavors together.

I've made this once so far, but I know I'll be making it again and again.  This dressing is fantastic!  I followed the recipe exactly and used it on fish tacos--my boyfriend and I couldn't get enough of it.  I was doubtful of the accuracy of the name before I made it, but I really did lick the spoon!

I ventured out of my comfort zone to make this and it was just delicious. I accidently doubled the cilantro but evened it out with sour cream. Absolutely delicious. It went very well with my duck tacos and the whole family liked it.

Made this as a slaw dressing for fish tacos. Excellent, simple, fresh, perfect for that and I'm sure it would be great with honey over fruits for the Mexican flare.
