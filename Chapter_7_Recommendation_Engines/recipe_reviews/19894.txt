I make this same recipe too pretty much to a "t".  The only things I change is that I keep the peanuts whole and put them on top of the ice cream before putting the fudge topping on top and I omit the butter in the fudge topping, you don't need it.  The fudge is good to make alone and keep jarred in the fridge for over sundaes too!

My friend's mom used to make this when I was in high school.  I knew it as Peanut Buster Parfait dessert.  It is delicious! I did find that the chocolate mixture has to be stirred longer (until thick).  I also leave the Spanish peanuts whole and layer them over the ice cream and over the chocolate.  I have had to give the recipe out to many people.

Oh my goodness!  This is SO rich.  I made this for a potluck and people just raved about it.  I have one person tell me this was the best dessert she had ever had!  I left the peanuts whole and mixed them with the chocolate sauce on top.  I let my sauce cool to room temperature before pouring it on the ice cream but it melted the ice cream a litte and I had little "marshmallow" looking spots in the chocolate where the ice cream floated up to the top.  Maybe the sauce could be refrigerated a while before pouring on the ice cream.  I personally thought this was just average (a 3 star recipe) but others loved it so I gave it 4 stars.

Yum - this was the comment I heard from everyone who ate this.  I made a half recipe and put it in a pie pan instead of a 13 x 9 pan.  I put nuts on half and left the other half without.  The chocolate sauce is wonderful.  I made up a full batch since it stays soft to use as a topping or to use in a milkshake.  Thanks Lisa for sharing your delicious dessert.

The homemade fudge sauce is super yummy!!  Just be careful, it melts fast.  We took it to a pool party and they all raved about it.

The homemade fudge was so delicious, it made this dessert definetly worth the extra time and effort. To make it even more simple I bought already made cookie crust.  Yummy!

Very good and so easy.    Because we love peppermint sometimes substitute peppermint icecream and omit the peanuts.    Goes very well with the chocolate sandwich cookie crust.

This was a big hit as a July 4th dessert. The kids loved it and said it tasted just like the popular ice cream sundae! The chocolate topping did not freeze and harden as I thought but stayed soft instead. It will definitely become a requested dessert for future.

I made this dessert for my husband's bday this week.  Very good, everyone liked it. I made it in a 10 inch spring form pan lined with parchment paper. The sauce is SO good too.  Thanks.

Everyone at the BBQ we attended loved this dessert.  It truly does remind you of a Dairy Queen Peanut Buster Parfait.  The sauce wasn't as thick as I would like, so I'll use a bit less evaporated milk and more chocolate chips next time.  I also recommend starting the sauce mixture first, prior to crushing the Oreos, to give the sauce enough time to cool completely.  As with others who tried this, while I thought the sauce was completely cool, it melted the ice cream somewhat.

Awesome.  Like dq peanut buster parfait.  Don't let chocolate cool too much or hard to spread over the ice cream
