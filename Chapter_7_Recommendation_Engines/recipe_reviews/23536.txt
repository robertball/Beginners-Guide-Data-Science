This was my "try a new drink" choice tonight. I agree with the other reviewers, a little heavy on the raspberry. If I make this again, I will cut back on the raspberry liqueur a bit.

Definitely different. Nice for a warm day like today. I would have never thought of putting raspberry liqueur and tequila together, that's for sure.

Strong Raspberry flavor, too strong for me, reduce raspberry and use more tequila or just reduce.

Very Tasty.  The raspberry taste is strong, so if you are not big on the fruity, just change it to 1.5 oz tequila to 1 oz raspberry liqueur
