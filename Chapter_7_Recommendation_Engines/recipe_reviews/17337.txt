This was so tasty.  A little messy to shape, but very easy since if it gets too hard just the heat of your hands will shape it.  Very rich so you'll need to slice the little potatoes.  I would roll them in powdered sugar for snowmen and add them to my Christmas candymaking.

I've used this one before, and it's really good...to cut the sweetness a bit we usually roll it out into a large rectangle, spread peanut butter on it, and roll it up and slice it rather than shaping it into potatoes...really good either way.

I tried this recipe with a friend that likes to bake.  After about 1 hour of cooling, I was finally able to shape the potatoes.  But, I still don't think they are right.  I followed the recipe, but also ended up with a lot of gooey-ness.  Won't try it again.

Disappointing ... I followed the recipe EXACTLY and waited til mixture cooled as directed to add vanilla and beat until creamy and firm ... all I got was a gooey mess.  Not sure what went wrong here!

I did everything right and they came out like little crumbly sugar balls. Bummer. Won't be making these again.

Very good, even though they didn't have coconut in them. They didn't last very long.

Delicious! I did not change anything with this recipe. It just so happens that a very picky eater actually really enjoyed this, as well as many others :)

Just like mini potatoes!  The brown outside tastes like a fireball, while the inside is smooth, creamy and white!  I used cream instead of the evaporated milk to make these delectable treats!
