I wasn't too sure about this. Mixing strawberries and peanut butter just sounded weird. But it was good. The only change I made was to use almond milk instead of skim milk. My protein powder is not pre-sweetened, so I did add some stevia to make the shake sweeter.

It tastes amazing and kept me full for a long time. A great add on would be some almonds. :)

I also thought this was an odd combination, but it's delicious! My banana was frozen and I just skipped the ice. The strawberries are not a prominent flavor but they work here.  I also used peanut butter powder and 2% milk. For my tastes, this needed a little sweetness, so I added a few tsp of honey, and it was just right.  A healthy and very good smoothie!

I'm new to making protein shakes and my first attempts have been disappointing, especially in the texture - way too thin. This recipe is perfect in taste and texture. It's thick like a milkshake should be, but not too thick, either. Love it!

I really like it but, it would have been better if I had fresh strawberries not frozen. I will make it again.  I am having hip surgery and I need to up my protein.

Super easy to make, and delicious. I did half the amount of ice and used frozen strawberries to keep it cold but a little thicker. I swapped coconut milk for skim and almond butter for peanut. #cleaneats #allrecipesallstarscanada
