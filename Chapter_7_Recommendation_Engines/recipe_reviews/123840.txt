I used a prepackaged bag of salad and this was incredibly simple and quick. I omitted the tarragon because I didn't have it but otherwise followed this exactly. I really enjoyed the light but tangy dressing. I loved that it didn't require oil! Will definitely make again. Thanks!

This was so sour and tart it made my mouth and lips hurt. After three bites I had to stop eating it.
