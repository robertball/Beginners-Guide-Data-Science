I did not care for this recipe!!! there's obviously NOT enough flour to make these roll-able, let alone transferable to baking sheet. Take your favorite sugar cookie recipe and dip in semi-sweet chocolate instead.

I did not dip in chocolate, just topped with sugar. Found them to stick when rolling wthout a lot of flour on the counter. They are soft, buttery, and have a great texture.  Did not re-refridgerate either.  One of out favorites.
