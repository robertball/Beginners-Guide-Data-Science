I am from San Antonio and this is a healthier version of how we make them.  However, you do need a tortilla press.  And you must make them larger to have them come out like the originals. To avoid the "volcano" effect, start making the fold after flipping them and Viola!   San Antonio style puffy tacos!

In order to have these puff up, in my opinion, you really do need a tortilla press.  It wasn't until I made the 5th one that I finally pressed it thin enough and it puffed up nicely. I'm going out and buying a tortilla press and making these again, that's how good they are.

If you donâ€™t have a tortilla press use the cut plastic bag and a clear glass pie plate. Just place on top of the dough and tilt the dish in a circular motion. Voila! Perfect round tortillas and they can be made thin enough to puff perfectly with this method.

Way to much work and too time consuming for me to just get a few little shells

I  just want to let everyone know that I tried this recipe with wheat germ because I had it at hand and was lazy enough not to go to the store. I might have added more dry wheat germ because it was sticking when I was pressing it out and they didn't puff up as much as it the video. Still Loved the flavor, naturally but just letting everyone know that you are not going to get the same outcome. Will try again with the right ingredients and tools!
