One of my top 5 favorite dishes to make. It combines my top two ingredients - shrimp and eggs. I also like that you can be versatile with this dish and add other vegetables such as cabbage and carrots (which is my usual added filling). I never tried it with celery before, but it was nice added texture. There is a sauce that is usually served with it, but I normally just top it off with soy sauce/tamari (as this recipe suggests).

It tasted just "ok" and looked awful. Mine was no where near restaurant quality. I doubt very seriously that I would make this again. "Hated it" (Using my Blaine and Antoine voice from In Living Color)

My shrimp egg foo yung did not look or taste like restaurant quality. The taste was decent, but the appearance was awful. It's very unlikely that I would make this dish again.
