These are great, something a little different than the ordinary oatmeal cookie.  Always a hit when I make them.

This oatmeal cookie recipe is to die for!  The cinnamon chips really add flavor to the batch, and the chewiness is out of this world! Delicious!

I think this is a very good cookie. I enjoyed the taste, appearance & texture. I omitted the raisins for my son because he doesn't like them, but he didn't like the cookie either.  He's finicky, so next time, raisins are in!  I want to make them again and add fresh chopped apples, walnuts would be good as well.  I will be putting this one on my list for Christmas baking.

These cookies are good.  I might omit the 1/3 cup of granulated sugar next time  as well.  I am not a fan of raisins so I did not put them in, but I did add chopped walnuts and would like to try putting some craisins in the next batch.  I think that would be a really yummy cookie!  Cranberries, walnuts and cinnamon!

I was dissappointed with this recipe.  No matter how I placed them on the tray or what I cooked them on a cookie sheet or baking stone, they flattened a lot and were really crispy around the edges.  They were gooey, which I liked but almost impossible to get off the baking stone.  Maybe it was the baker?  The flavor was good, but I'm still in search of a good oatmeal cookie that I can add the cinnamon chips to.

These were OK cookies.  I felt the cinnamon chips were a bit overwhelming with the quanity.  Might have liked to cut the cinnamon chip amount in 1/2.

These are the best cookies!! I suggest using real butter, the texture is better. I take them to work all of the time and everyone fights over them!

After reading all of the great reviews I had to try these cookies. They turned out great and are a pleasant change from chocolate chip oatmeal. My only change was to reduce the amount of sugar, this is just a personal preference and they still turned out wonderful.

Delicious!!  What a nice change from oatmeal-raisin and oatmeal-butterscotch chip.  Crispy and chewy just like I like them.  My husband loved them too.

If you like oatmeal cookies, you will ADORE and CRAVE this recipe. Dense and chewy and not too sweet, with the unexpected addition of sweet cinnamon chips. I made this recipe for a party and the cookies were gone before all of our guests had even arrived. The dough freezes well too - shape into a log, wrap tightly in wax paper, then aluminum foil, then store in a freezer bag. Allow to thaw for an hour or so and then bake according to the recipe's instructions. Just as good as the day you made it!

I made this recipe to enter in a contest we had at our family reunion.  All five judges picked these cookies as their favorite out of nine other recipes!  Have shared it with several friends and have taken some to work -- everyone loves these cookies!  GREAT RECIPE!

My BF baked these cookies and they were great!  We halved the recipe.  Some reviews said to eliminate or use less white sugar but we  followed the recipe and the cookies weren't too sweet for us.  We did leave out the raisins though.  Also, the first batch was very chewy but the second batch got cooked a little longer and they were very crunchy so I think the cooking time determines the texture of the cookie.

Can't stop making these!  I have been baking these super yummy cookies for several years now and they are one of my most requested no matter what time of year!  I like fall flavors and add about 1/8 teaspoon of the following: Cinnamon, Cloves, Nutmeg & Allspice.  This may help those of you who say they are a little bland.  I just like the added spiceyness. If you have trouble finding these chips Hersheys website has a customer service number to call and find out which supermarkets in your area supply them.  Or just ask your grocery store manager to order you some.  Wegmans ususally has a great supply, I'm spoiled since I live only an hour from Hershey, PA.

I have made many regular oatmeal cookies, but I love love love these, just a treat for me.  Just do not want to eat too many.  I used hearty, rough oats instead of quick oats...makes for a thicker and more substantial treat.

I have used cinnamon chips in muffins before, but this was the first time I have used them in a cookie recipe!  These are now my favorite oatmeal cookie!  They are crisp and chewy and they wont last long.  Great alternative to the traditional oatmeal cookies!

These cookies are great. I took the advice of others and did not add the additional sugar. Also, took Loveyloo's suggestion and added Craisins instead of the raisins. Did not have walnuts, but added about 1/2 cup of chopped pecans. Will make these cookies again !

I was a bit disappointed in these cookies.  I didn't find the cinnamon taste overwhelming...if anything I thought the cookies were a bit bland.  I didn't have the full 1 2/3 cups of cinnamon chips as a package only gives you about 1 1/3 cups.  I added 1/3 cup of mini chocolate chips along with the raisins.  The cookies are nice and chewy, but I have other oatmeal cookie recipes that I like better so I wouldn't make this one again.  If you don't have an oatmeal cookie recipe that you love, this would be a good one to try.

These are great cookies.  My kids hated oatmeal cookies until I made these. Now when I make them they camp out in front of the oven until they are done, so they can eat them when they come out. They don't last long in my house. My oldest rather have these instead of chocolate chip cookies, which is nice because I have a hard time just getting him to eat oatmeal for breakfast.

Not as impressed as I hoped. The chips gave huge bursts of flavor but the bites without a chip were just plain. Will try this again when I can figure out how to get the chips to melt more during baking.

The cookies are good! However, the sugar content needs to be lowered in the recipe. I would omit the 1/3 cup granulated sugar. Then they would be absolutely delicious!

I was really excited about this recipe and it took me months to actually find cinnamon chips.  I didn't like the texture of these cookies.  I think I will use my favorite "soft oatmeal cookies" from this site and add cinnamon chips instead of using this recipe in the future.

All my co-workers loved these cookies over the chocolate chip cookies. Only down side is the cinncmon chips are hard to find in east central florida. Finally found a store selling them and they were having a closeout sale on them . So I bought all 18 bags that were left. I now have some time to find a new place that sells them. These are my favorite cookies also.

This is my favorite cookie!! My boyfriend is constantly requesting these, too. I've always had problems with my oatmeal cookies coming out cakey. Not these. They are the perfect texture. I made no changes at all to the recipe.

These cookies were great. I did change the recipe a bit. No chips bc I live in Belgium so only fresh cinnamon. 1/2 of the fat and no added substitute, we like them crispy. And there is no way you can get 4 doz out of this recipe in my house! 2 maybe of big yummy cookies.

Excellent recipe.  Only change I made was add 1/4 c flour and left out the raisins.  These were a big hit at the office!

The whole family loved these--and they weren't chocolate chip cookies for once!  The taste is so addicting and new.  Great, great recipe.  And we finally have cinnamon chips in our area :)

I think the cookies are probably the best oatmeal cookies I have had in a long time. But I think they need a little more raisins.

Yummm! I absolutely love them. Their so chewy and cinnamony. I halved this recipe and will be using it as a jar mix for Christmas gifts. I think the cinnamon chips are a delightful addition to the Hershey's chip line. Yeah for Hershey's.
