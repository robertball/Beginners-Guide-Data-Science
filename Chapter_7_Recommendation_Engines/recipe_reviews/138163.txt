The is a FANTASTIC venison chili recipe!!  I made some changes, but LOVED how it turned out.  Used one white onion, 3 stalks of celery, a fresh serrano pepper minced (with seeds left in tact), a green pepper, added dried: cilantro, thyme, oregano, paprika, garlic granules, a dash of cinnamon, salt & pepper.  I also used a small amount of agave syrup to mellow out the tomato acidity.  Then I added 2 cans of diced tomatoes, a can of tomato paste & sauce & a can of chicken broth.  For the beans I used 2 cans of great northern white beans, drained.  I omitted the o.j., but we LOVED the addition of the tequila!!  It's subtle, but you can taste it in the background -- yummy!!!

Thanks for posting this recipe :)

Very hearty and delicious! I agree with the person who was worried about the 1/4 cup of chili powder but it worked very well. 

I added one jalapeno pepper and one serrano pepper for some heat but I could have added more as just those two only spiced it up a little bit.

Loved it!  I used 'chili ready' tomatoes and crushed tomatoes.  Also, I always dump into my chili a combination of whatever beans I have in the pantry.  So, I used Great Northern beans and Black Beans.  I am not a big venison fan, but have two hunters in my home.  This is one venison recipe I can enjoy.

Good.  I made this in the crockpot.  I browned the beef with the onions, then added that along with the remainder of the ingredients to the crockpot.  Also, I omitted the OJ because we didn't have any.  Next time, I will add some chopped green bell pepper.  Served with Beer Bread I from this site.

DELICIOUS CHILI! I didn't have any venison so I substituted with beef. It was amazing! The tequila definitely set it off!

It was very tasty.  We made it to specifications just to try it.  My husband loved it.  I even forgot to top it with cheese.  Next time, because I like to experiment, I'll probably add some green peppers and top with sour cream and grated cheese.  I think the tequila and the orange juice really do add something.  Very nice recipe.

This recipe was very good.  I pretty much followed it as written but did make the following changes:

1.  I used fresh jalapeno instead of red pepper flakes and sauteed them with the onion & celery.

2.  I added more chili powder, plus used cumin, coriander, and cayenne pepper.

3.  I omitted the orange juice.  Other reviewers have said that this lends a nice flavor but I don't think orange juice has any place in chili.

The end result was quite tasty.  I didn't even need to add sour cream to my bowl (a chili staple).  In fact, the sour cream ruined it for me which is testimony to how tasty this chili is on its own.
  
My only complaint is that it was too runny.  Next time, I will pull back on the sauce or add more meat.  Otherwise, this is definitely a keeper and I will make it again.

I followed this recipe exactly except I only had 2 lbs of venison & I think my hubby used a heavy hand when adding the tequila because the taste was strong...too strong.  It burnt my throat going down!  I finally added the other chili I had made for a group of kids that were coming over...then it was perfect, so I wonder if mis measured.  (We had to borrow tequila from a friend cuz I am more of a martini kind of girl!)

Great recipe! I tweaked it a little bit by adding a couple of bell peppers, a can of corn, a tsp of cumin and a tsp of cayenne pepper. I also had some fresh parsley that needed to be used up, so I tossed some of that in as well. The tequila definitely adds some kick, and the OJ gives a bit of sweetness. Very good!

Excellent recipe. Didn't have any tequila, but it still turned out great. Added some brown sugar to cut back on the acidity, helps with heart burn. No leftovers. Will be making it again!!

Excellent...I added a half of a bottle of Newcastle beer to it, as well as the tequila.  I believe next time, I'll add some beef broth...it was just a little thick as written.

This recipe is AMAZING!!! I've made it quite a few times and tried adding extras such as fresh jalapenos and bell peppers but no matter what it's always a huge hit... even won a chili cook-off at work with it! My fiance is a big hunter and there always seems to be an abundance of ground venison in our freezer so this is an great way to use it up... with some tortilla chips on game day... YUMM!! Thanks for sharing!

Just made this fantastic chili!  Took suggestions from other reviewers and used ground beef and added 1 tablespoon brown sugar, and 2 tablespoons cocoa powder.  Everything else the same.

I made this recipe, according to the directions. I served it over corn chips, and topped it with shredded cheese. It was a little bland for my taste, so I added some hot sauce before serving it.

I tried this recipe because it was specific to venison and had good reviews. It did not disappoint! There was no gamey flavor, even when eating the leftovers.  It needs a little more spiciness though, and what is chili without some peppers?!  It needs peppers and  Vegetables. So it will be 5 stars with some some simple adjustments.

We LOVED this chili!  Had to make a few changes, subbed out black beans for chili beans and added about 1-2 cups beef stock since this was a long cook time, and need moisture added.  I've had a ton of venison sausage in my time, but this is only me second time having ground venison and I must say, it beats the pants off ground beef in flavor lol!  Loved it!!
