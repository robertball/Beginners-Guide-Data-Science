These were delicious and make such a pretty presentation. I topped each one with a whole tiny shrimp and a small parsley leaf. Even better the next day!

The BEST deviled egg recipe I've ever made, bar none!  I made 18 of these for a small gathering of 10 people, and they were gone in less than 15 minutes.  Thanks so much, Geritzla!

Really great & different flavor!  I was a bit leery, but decided to make 1/2 the recipe to test - boy was I sorry I hadn't made them all! Will make these often - and if you like the ingredients, you'll like them mixed!

This is a great way to upscale your deviled eggs. I'm not a fan of salad shrimp so I used regular shrimp chopped up. I was generous in the amount of shrimp that I used also. The eggs were gobbled up!! Great recipe!

Use rough chopped crawfish tails and fine chopped sweet pickles for the ultimate deviled eggs.

This is a fantastic recipe and I have gotten future party invites on the condition that I bring it.  I substituted regular shrimp for the baby shrimp because I prefer the firmer texture of regular shrimp.

I used to make shrimp deviled eggs  on special occasions just to change things up a little. My recipe did not call for butter and it included a little dill. You could easily add it to this recipe. Just remember if you try it, a little goes a long way! Great recipe!

the only real change i made was the portion size - other than that i enjoyed it tremendously.
