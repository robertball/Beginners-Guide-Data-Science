I agree that this is a good, basic soup recipe.  I also had to "spice" it up a bit by adding cumin, chili powder, garlic powder, black pepper, cayenne pepper, red wine vinegar, oregano, and basil.  Adjust to your own taste, and you've got a winner!

I loved the basics of this soup - you had no spices OR "love" so I added a whole lot of cumin, chili powder, cayanne pepper, wayy more garlic and a can of creamed corn.  I blended up a can of pinto beans and the tomatoes (sweet onion) to make it a bit thicker.  Great Base reciepe!

OK, I saw this recipe and freaked out! I soaked 1 cup black beans and 1 cup of cranberry beans overnight. I rinsed and boiled them w/red pepper flakes, in chx broth; sauteed japs, 1/2 onion, & 4 big garlic cloves. I chopped 3 Romas and threw 'em in; had no carrots. Everybody now goes in the crock pot (high) 5 hrs-adding spices. After 5 hrs. I added Rotelle w/green peppers and 1 can of corn (drained) and 2 more cups of chx broth. Garnish w/chopped onion, sour cream, and shredded cheddar! Dip Italian bread in this and you'll freak out at the flavour/spices!!!

Super yummy and healthy!! I made the following adaptations: vegetable broth instead of chicken broth, only one can of tomatoes, used a full cup of green chiles, used one minced hot pepper, and cayenne pepper to taste. With those adjustments, it was hot to our liking. Thanks for the recipe!

I spiced it up with extra garlic, chili powder, cumin and cayenne pepper. I also used dried beans instead of canned (soaked and simmered for a couple of hours), because I had them. But this was really good and super healthy! Thanks for posting!

Easy recipe; family enjoyed it.  Makes enough for two dinners for family of four.  Couldn't find frozen shoepeg corn, so used regular frozen corn, and served with warm tortillas, and topped soup with shredded cheese.  Tasty!!

Really good.  This has become a staple at our house.  We love to mix in a spoonful of sour cream to our bowls and sprinkle with cheese.

This soup was okay. The name implies that the soup is spicy. It is not spicy at all. In fact we thought it was a bit bland. We all ate it but I don't think anyone thoroughly enjoyed it. Don't think I will make it again.

I made this recipe almost exactly as stated except that I don't know what shoepeg corn is, so I just added regular frozen corn. I also added about 1 tsp of cumin based on previous comments. Overall it wasn't very spicy, but my boyfriend and I enjoyed it very much. Very colourful, healthy and filling.

This is a great crockpot recipe, especially for church suppers.  I use only black beans,instead of kidney beans, and spice the soup up with cumin and chili powder.  This is a favorite at church and in our home on those cold New England evenings!

I added smoked sausage, red wine vinegar, basil, and oregano to make a very good chilly day meal. I like to make soup on weekends when we get company in and out during the day, this soup kept everybody happy...

Great starter soup.  I added spices as recommended by others and smoked sausage.  I ended up serving it over rice.  My hubby loved it so I hope to make it again this winter.

I made this for supper last night and did add extra garlic and cayanne pepper and it came out perfect. What a nice little zing it had!!! Matter of fact, looking at the recipe this morning I noticed I had forgotten the diced tomatoes. Forgetting this ingredient I was still very impressed with this soup, so I wont add this ingredient to my left overs, but I may possibly(?) add this the next time I make this. Great recipe Chelsea!!!

This was very good.  I followed the advice of others and added 1 tsp chili powder, 1 tsp salt, few shakes of cyane pepper, 1 tsp cumin. It could have used more than 1 tsp of everything. Once you get the spices correct, this will be a great soup.

I took other's advise and added cumin. garlic powder, chili powder. However it needs salt. 
Was a little surprised by the sweetness of the first bite but it soon grew on me. 
Nice soup.

Great soup!! I did not add corn but I did add creole seasoning, tobasco and I also added some shrimp for more protein then served it on some rice. I also put in 1 more cup of chicken broth and more black & red beans pureed which made the soup a little thicker.

The only reason I'm giving this three stars is because my husband said it was "all right," meanwhile I did not care for it much at all, and I'd give it more of a 2.5. I fail to see how something can be called "spicy" when the only "spicy" ingredients are the green chiles, which really, are not all that spicy. Also, sugar is not exactly spicy either. Still, I noticed this before making it, and added plenty of cayenne pepper, chili powder and additional oregano and garlic powder. I made this in a slow cooker, so I left out the veg. oil, but kept everything else the same. I think this would be better minus the sugar, but I don't think I will be making it again.

This recipe is a great base that you can add alot of different things to. I sliced 1 lb spicy smoked sausage and 2 good sized chicken breasts and sauted them in oil with salt garlic black and red pepper and a little Worcestershire sauce. I seasoned the carrots and onions about the same as the meat minus the Worcestershire sauce. Instead I used some of the broth. I also left out the canned chili peppers and diced three fresh jalapeños (which went in with the onions and carrots.)  Then combined everything in the pot with the beans and tomatoes.  It turned out amazing and I ended up making it again within a week.

I liked this recipe however in its written form is not spicy at all. I am a fan of really spicy foods so I added 1 tbsp of cayenne pepper, jalapeno powder, chili powder, and cumin.

I have been making this exact recipe for a couple of years.  Funny how this matches the one of have been making from COOKING LIGHT.  Aren't these supposed to be your own original recipes?  Great soup recipe COOKING LIGHT came up with.

Great recipe but I thought it needed some chicken and sausage (quantity can vary) along with extra black & red beans. Turned out the be a keeper. Of course this does make a lot of soup.

This makes a ton which is great. It's not spicy at all and I failed to read the reviews beforehand or I would have known to add more spice. I omitted the sugar and can't tell that it was missed. Will make again.

I added frozen red, green, and yellow bell pepper strips. It gives the soup a beautiful color.

The sugar and onions in this recipe go together really well!  Very healthy too.

On the good side, this was very easy to make and a good way to use up cans of beans.  But it wasn't as good as my expectations -- just didn't have quite enough flavor for something called "spicy."  But not bad either - just needs spiced up some.
