As usual, I read reviews - nearly 6 pgs of them - got tickled that several reviewers didn't really REVIEW; they REVAMPED the soup into something entirely different from Kwollaks original.  Suit yourself, but this soup, just as it IS, is wonderful.  I made this for a "Gourmet Group" and all agreed that it is terrific. Being part of such a group, I actually used fresh chicken broth, made from boiling a real chicken and no-salt added.  Thank you-this soup was a HIT!

I changed a few things and all the neighbors loved it-5 people asked for the recipe.Instead of bacon I used 3cups chopped ham (leftover from Thanksgiving), I changed to regular chicken broth, 2 cups of cheddar, omitted the salt, added 1/2 cup milk, 3 chopped green onions, and 1 TBSP parsley.  BEST SOUP EVER!!!

Excellent flavor!  I made just a few modifications- sauteed the veggies in the bacon fat & used 1/2 chicken broth & 1/2 milk to make it a little creamier. I also used a potato masher to break up the potatoes in the pot prior to serving.

My husband and toddler gobbled it up!

I make about 20 soups a month and almost never make the same soup twice in a month however I've made this soup 4 times in the same month it is to die for people can't get enough of it.  I'm a caterer for small event (under 50 people).  I cater to all types of people from blue collars to suits and they all love this soup just the same.  It will become a perminate item on my menu.  Thanks so much!?!

This soup is delicious! I didn't think it would thicken up after I poured in 4 cups of chicken broth, but after simmering, I had no trouble with the thickness. I would recommend maybe 3/4 cup of cheese instead of 1/2. Other than that, this came out wonderfully!

It was pretty good as written, but why in the world would you get rid of all that yummy bacon grease and replace it with olive oil??? I know it's supposed to be healthier, but my grandparents both lived into their 90's eating bacon fat and/or lard nearly every day!

This was very tasty!  I used regular chicken broth, not low salt.  I pureed half of the soup mixture in the blender, then added it to the remaining soup with the bacon.  That made for a nice texture.
I added some corn and chopped ham to the leftovers the next day for a hearty lunch.  This is a keeper, thanks!

No good.  Only decent after MAJOR changes.  It was like potatoes in broth, not a creamy hearty soup.  I had to add milk, knorr chicken bouillion and more to make it palatable.  Will trash this recipe- not for us, sorry.  Maybe better suited to those looking for a brothy potato soup vs. a hearty creamy one?

Great soup and my daughter shouted "mom-give this five stars!" My boyfriend ate 3 bowls (and didn't touch the sandwiches I made to go with the soup!). I cooked the veggies in a TBLS of the leftover bacon grease and added 1/2c milk just to ensure it was creamy. Very good soup Kwollak!

This is an outstanding soup!  It's hard to find a good potato soup that doesn't use milk/cream or flour/cornstarch, but this more than fits the bill!  Both my husband and I loved it!  With a glass of chianti and some warm, crusty bread, it's the perfect warm up at the end of a cold day.  I cooked to the recipe, though I used some of the bacon drippings rather than olive oil to saute the onion, carrots and celery.  The cayenne pepper sets off the veggies and bacon beautifully.  1/8th tsp is perfect.  Easy to make, quick, and tastes good the next day, too.  This one is an instant classic in our home!

I HAVE MADE THIS RECIPE MANY MANY TIMES FOLLOWING THE RECIPE EXACTLY AND IT IS DEFINATELY A KEEPER! I WAS LOOKING FOR A NON-CREAM SOUP. I HAVE EVEN ADDED MORE BROTH AND MORE POTATOES TO MAKE IT GO FURTHER. BECAUSE I DO NOT LIKE VERY SPICY FOOD, I SOMETIMES USE A TINY BIT LESS CAYENE PEPPER. I NOTICED THAT SOME CHEESES DO NOT MELT AS WELL INTO THE SOUP. IF YOU WANT A CREAM SOUP, FIND A DIFFERENT RECIPE. THE TITLE IS BACON AND POTATO SOUP, NOT CREAM OF POTATO AND BACON SOUP!

OMG, I've been searching for this recipe for years (a non-cream potato soup!).  It's just like my Baba's from when I was little!   I did make a few changes.   My Baba used to put vinegar in her soup to ensure the potatos hold together.  So I added 2 tsp white vinegar at the same time as the chicken stock.  Also, I didn't add the cheddar cheese, she never added cheese and the soup doesn't really need it.  I didn't used olive oil either, I just removed enough bacon grease to ensure about 1 tbsp and the drippings were left in the pan to cook the veggies in.  Delicious!!!!

This was delicious!  Perfect for a cold winter day.  I followed the recipe exactly but did add some cooked Italian sausage I had in the frig.  My husband, not a soup craver, loved it and even had a second bowl.  I'll make it again and again.

I think it's important that I state, that I completely followed the recipe.
My family loves this soup, that I've used this recipe more than once. When I am short on time I used the frozen cubed potatoes. (note: the potatoes will be done in 5 mins or less). I hope your family enjoys this soup as well.

Liked it but it needed help. Was trying to find a bacon and potato soup that didn't have too much fat, but was still hearty and had substance. First off it needed more chicken flavor, so I added additional chicken base. I also added 2 cloves of minced garlic to the veggies when sweating them. Then pre-cooked half of the potatoes and pureed them in a blender to add consistency. Left out the cayenne and cheddar, and my wife said its the best soup I've ever made(and i make lots!) Will keep this one with the changes.

I have never written a review about any of the recipes I have tried on this site, but this was by far the best potato bacon soup, ever.  Didn't change a single ingredient other then to add extra carrots, and used my emulsion blender just to puree it slightly, left a few potato chucks.  Husband and son loved it, no left overs for work the next day.  Plan to make this soup many times over the winter.

Oh my goodness....we just finished this off.  I didn't have cayenne pepper so just used black.  I also added 1/2 cup of rice milk (dairy allergy).  The cheese was mixed into each bowl individually.  It was difficult to eat because of the cheese, however but the taste was AMAZING!!!!!!!  I look like a pro with this recipe, thank you!

Ok for starters this is NOT the thick white potato soup in many Restaurants. It is yummy but if that's what you are looking for you will be disappointed. But I was looking for a soup that was less than my 1000 calorie per serving butter, flour, cream, cheese bacon type. I made this as stated except I did cook the veggies in a small amount of the bacon fat..it was already in the pan. And I did add garlic in the veggie mix. I also cut my potato in small and large chunks. As the potatoes and veggies simmered and I stirred the small ones broke down and made a thicker broth. The cheese really wasn't necessary but it was my first time making it and tried to follow before I change it. I only added a small handfull maybe a 1/4 cup it did thicken the soup up more. And its cheese it was still yummy. But if you can't eat cheese the soup was still good without. I only seasoned with the cayenne and a little salt and pepper. Very simple but tasty.

This soup is very flavorful. Sauted the carrots, celery and onions in the bacon grease, giving extra flavour. I simmered the soup with the lid off, thickening the broth. It was not as thick as if I had used cream or milk but was not water runny. I wasn't looking for thick as in creamy. I doubled the recipe, will triple next time. Crumbled the bacon and put on top of soup along with chopped green onions, also added a dolop of sour cream.  This recipe is a keeper, will make often specially in the winter time. Thanks for posting. Peggy

When I made this recipe, I was very impressed by the simplicity of it all and how it turned out to taste quite well. However, I made some changes: I didn't have bacon, so I used pork-bacon sausage that I had. It added just as much flavor. I also did not shred my cheese, I cubed it and stirred some in last minute, and also garnished with a few cubes to make it look more appealing and less dull. I added some spinach for green color and just a HINT of hot sauce (mexican hot sauce in my case, I like to add some spice to things). The soup was VERY filling and very much a comfort food. Also for visual appeal, I pureed HALF of the soup to make it creamy, and added the rest back to it for texture. I added a tiny bit of heavy cream swirled in last minute.

This is a nice light potato soup. I used some of the bacon grease as someone had suggested and have a hand blender, blending about half the potatoes to give it a nice auburn, yellow color. I also used regular chicken stock and regular Cheddar cheese to add to the flavor and center-cut bacon.

If your looking for something hardy don't try this. You have to make a lot of changes adding flavor and richness. This is just a runny soup like from a cheap can.

This was so good.  And I made it with vegetarian bacon and vegetable stock.  Thank you for sharing that one, it is a keeper.  With a handful of green onion on the top and a little more cheddar cheese, it is like a baked potato in a bowl.  Yummy.

Huge disappointment.  My soup did not turn out like the picture.  It's like someone forgot a major ingredient or something (flour or starch) because all I had was a clear liquid broth with veges. If you are looking for the average Potato soup you get at restaurants, this is NOT the one!

Delicious, made this wonderful soup after hours of snowshoveling, it was great.  Followed a reviewer's tip and used milk instead of water to reconsitute stock.  I can't get low sodium stock right now, so I used regular but omitted salt.  Next time I'll also omit red pepper--it doesn't need it.

My family wanted to go out for dinner but I told them I could make a homemade dinner that would be fantastic and much less expensive. I made this soup and they LOVED it!!! I added 1/4 cup of heavy cream at the end to thicken it up a bit. It was delicious!!!

This was really good! I made a few minor changes: increased the cheese and added 1/2 cup of milk. This went over so well with my husband that it will be a winter staple recipe. Thanks!

I'v made a variation on this recipe for a few years now (it adds a few more calories and fat). I make the bacon first, then drain off all but a tablespoon of fat and sautee the onions and carrot and celery in the fat. I then add the remainder and substitute regular pepper for the cyanne. after its done, I blend it with an immersion blender before adding the bacon bits back into the soup. It's a great recipe.

tried this for dinner tonight, what's more perfect on a wet cold day. Made it per the instructions plus added a clove of garlic because I use it in everything and served with fresh biscuts. OMG it was awesome and my hubby loved it, second serving to boot, and he seldoms has seconds of soup.  It thickened up just fine while cooking. For those that found it too brothy maybe cook it longer so the taters disappear into the mix. Thanx for this recipe I'll definately be making it again.

Surprisingly better than expected, as it appeared very thin/liquidy during the cooling process.  Potato flakes would be good to thicken.  Would be better to use thick bacon.  Don't shy away from the salt.

Really good soup, but doesn't need the cheese. That was overkill. Tastes excellent without. Instead of cayenne I used chipotle, which added an extra smokiness.

Oh yummy.  I read some reviews first. Always a good way to pick up hints.  So I added 2 chopped cloves of garlic, about 4 shakes of instant mashed potatoes, 2 more cups of water and a couple sprinkles of chicken broth. I left out all the veggies except the onions, celery (did not use a lot of celery)  Didn't even measure the bacon since I had hormel already cooked shredded bacon. I am not a "measuring person so I went with appearance".
 It is awesome! I converted to 8 servings. Next time I will go with more since this was not enough for a family of 4.  Added some fresh baked bread (in the bread machine of course) Perfect for a dark rainy cold day!

I loved this soup, but changed a few things; first I didn't need 6 servings so I lessened the broth, using only 2cups of chicken broth and 1 cup of 2% milk.  Had no cayanne pepper so I used paprika instead and also added a chicken bouillon cube for flavor.  I only used 3 cups of potatoes and 1/4 cup of onions, I didn't touch the quantity on the vegetables.  I did however sautee them in the bacon grease instead of olive oil. I like a hearty broth so I added a 1/2 tsp of cornstarch and removed half of the soup, blended it and then returned to pot and mixed it Back in.  I couldn't believe I made a soup that was so good, will definitely be a staple in my winter meals :)

This dish is fantastic. my family loved it. although i did change it up a bit. i added flour and mash potato flakes to thicken it up, I also tossed the onions, carrots, & celery into a blender to make them super tiny. (my family hates veggies) it was an absolute success!

I just made this for our Sunday Night Dinner. It definitely was a hit. This recipe is very versatile for other types of soups - i.e., turning it into a lentil soup, or even add Bulgar in. We are not fan's of Cayanne Pepper and would not add it in next time. Very fulfilling and satisfying.

It was good and tasty, but I used marble cheese and it did not melt nicely. I also added a splash of cream to make a creamy look. Otherwise its more of a clear soup. It has a nice flavor. Feb 5 2011

This was just completely delicious. I did as some others did, I cooked the celery, carrots and onion in the bacon grease, added some ham cubes, added 2 tbsp. cornstarch dissolved in 1/2 cup water, 2 cups of milk and a dash of smoked paprika. It's just delicious.

This was really good, but not the creamy typical potato soup.  The prep work took a while but otherwise very easy. I used the bacon fat, but apparently too much as it pooled on top.

This is not only delicious, but much healthier than a lot of other versions. We like our potato soup more creamy than chunky, so I use an immersion blender to puree after the vegetables are soft. Easy to make with ingredients I always have on hand - this recipe is one I use often.

Very good!  This was easy to put together for a weeknight supper!  I added some milk in place of the broth as suggested by other reviews.  I think this would be just as good or better without the milk.

My family loved it!  The only thing I did differently was I used some of the bacon grease instead of removing it and adding olive oil.  Great wintertime soup!

Very good and easy to make.  Next time I will add cream or evaporated milk in place of some of the chicken broth to make it creamy.

I guess I was expecting more of a creamy soup. This came out with a really thin and watery consistency and I had to "mash" some of the potatoes to thicken it up a bit. Even then, it wasn't great. The smoked bacon I added gave a good flavor, but I recommend using the leanest kind you can find; finding fatty bacon chunks in your soup is no fun!=)

This was the most delicious tasting potato soup I've ever made. It was very hearty and my family gobbled it up! The flavors were rich and comforting. This one is a keeper! :-)

Quick and easy!  As another reviewer indicated, I enjoyed a potato soup that was not cream based.  My soup came out nice and thick after I let it sit for a bit then reheated.

This is so delicious and very easy to make.
I like creamy texture soup, so I used hand blender to puree half of the soup and it is super good.

Duh people...this isn't milky and creamy because there isn't any MILK in the ingredient list!! OK, rant over. This soup's ingredient list is perfect as written!!!!!!! I changed the procedure a little bit: I cut the raw bacon into small pieces before frying them in the pan; drained on paper towel. Then I removed all but about 2 tablespoons of the bacon fat and sauteed the veggies in the fat then added the potatoes, stock & pepper. I let the soup simmer for about 45 minutes then used my immersible blender to make it a little smoother, but I did leave a fair amount of potato and carrot pieces. Then I added the bacon pieces. I served it into bowls with cheese on the side to add on the top of the soup. NO salt was added, and I used Knorr Chicken Stock...which was not low-salt. Next time I would use a low-salt stock or broth as the husband and I agreed that it was a bit salty (my own fault). The recipe is a keeper...thank you!

I made this soup and it was delish!  I made two minor adjustments: I cleaned the pan after cooking the bacon, and I took out some, not all, of the potatoes and chicken broth and blended it together until it was creamy, then poured it back into the pot.  Topped it off with the cheese and bacon!  I will be making it again!

I doubled the amount of bacon and celery and threw in a good amount of fresh minced garlic. To make it a cream soup, I cut the amount of chicken broth back by a half cup and added in a half cup of evaporated milk. It is a thinner soup than I expected but the flavor was very good. We ate every bit of this soup for lunch, paired with ham sandwiches.

Very good soup.  Made exactly like recipe using an immersible blender to thicken up the soup.  I used more cayenne pepper, but would stick with the 1/8 teaspoon.  Had company for lunch and it was a big hit.

Good wholesome soup! I omitted the bacon being a vegetarian and replaced the chicken broth with vegetable. I like another reviewer pureed half to make it creamy. I also added my own spices like dill and Mrs. Dash. I thought this had a really good flavor and is a great lowfat soup if you don't add the cheese (which I didn't). I also like the celery and carrots to give it color. I would definitely recommend it.

I am on a low-carb diet so I changed the potatoes to butternut squash which I bought already diced in a 1 pound container which was 4 cups. I also increased the carrots, onions and celery to about 1 cup each and put them in the food processor to really chop finely. I sauteed the veggies in the bacon grease and didn't use EVOO. I added 6 oz of smoked diced ham after sauteeing the veggies and at the end I did use a hand blender to smooth it out and left some chunks of squash. It was yummy and both my husband and I loved it!!!

WIFE THOUGHT IT WAS VERY GOOD. A BIT TOO MUCH POTATOES FOR ME. I ADDED FRESH BLACK PEPPER AND A BIT OF CILANTRO AND IT IMPROVED THE FLAVOR. WILL PROBABLY TRY IT AGAIN WITH SOME CHANGES.

After reading a "ton" of the reviews, and trying to make it straight from the recipe, I have to say this kinda needs a bit (lot) of tweaking.  Sorry, and it may just be my taste and the fact I can't add any pepper to things for my mom's sake.  BUT....I added garlic to the veggie saute, (love garlic), chicken thigh to the broth, (trying to make a richer base), and then still tasting and tasting as it went along....it was still lacking in flavor (IMO).  Ended up adding the garlic, some thigh meat, parsley, onion powder, and mushrooms, oh and used emulsion blender to puree some of the potatoes and make it thicker. My Mom loved it when she added some cream at the end in her bowl, so I will keep it as a great starter.  I added black pepper, red pepper and a shot or two of hot sauce to mine.  We'll see how it tastes tomorrow, as SO many things like this are better after melding overnight.  We ALL tweak things to our tastes, allergies, etc., but I will say this recipe got me into the kitchen to try making a potato soup for the 1st time- so that's always good! :-)

Wow, this was so good! It tasted like it had been cooking all day, amazing! I used turkey bacon and fat free chicken broth to make it a little healthier. Next time I'm going to throw in some cloves of garlic with the onion to make it even better!

Made this today for lunch for me and my husband. Turned out pretty good. Only problems with it were cooking error(I put too much salt in) Only thing I changed about the recipe was I omitted onions, since we aren't big into them, and added half a cup of milk to give it a creamier taste. Tasted great. Despite there being a little too much salt in it, it was still edible and tasty, we each had two bowls worth.

thank you for a great recipe!!  My husband likes thicker soups so I tweaked it a bit to fit our personal preference! I used 2 cans of broth and 1 can of evaporated milk and before adding the liquids I added some flour to create a thicker soup The red pepper really set this one apart from others I've tried!  KUDOS!!!!!

I just made this soup for the first time and I think it's delicious.  I used homemade chicken broth so  I may have used a bit more than what was called for.  I did remove some of the potatoes and puree some with the broth, but I think this is a personal preference and you can judge for yourself whether you need to puree or not.  It's definitely a nice, simple and tasty soup!

Mmmmm....Mmmmmm... good. We found ours a little salty even after using low salt bacon and adding no salt, but we added some cream (as others suggested) and that really made a good thing even better.  Thanks for the recipe!

this was excellent.. i made a few changes.. added a clove of garlic, doubled the amount carrots and celery, added some black pepper, and i put the bacon in after the boil to become part of and flavor the soup. also right before serving, i mixed in the cheese (probably a full cup).. and it was the best potato-bacon soup ive ever tasted. Thanks for the inspiration!

I prepared this recipe EXACTLY as written and it was FABULOUS!  It was a bit hot for the kids so I put a touch of cream in it to cool it down and that was great too.  Everyone from age 2 to 32 loved it.  A definite winner!

This was awesome. Like other reviewers, I added cream/whole milk to make it creamier. I also added some extra veggies like broccoli and it was very hearty. Thanks for the recipe!

This soup is GREAT! To those who quickly dismissed it as "too brothy" - take a hand blender and give it a few quick "whizzes" - the cooked potatoes are a great thickener and yet the soup remains slightly chunky! For those who said it was "flavourless" - add some chicken Bovril (liquid) or more salt to taste. I like this recipe as I usually have all these ingredients on hand (I used turkey bacon instead). Add some crusty bread and you have a hearty  meal - yyummm!

I made a triple batch of this for a church fundraiser and it was well received.  I used gouda instead of cheddar as I am in Holland and it is much cheaper than imported cheddar.  I also took the advice of others and stirred in some creme fraiche to add some creaminess.  Next time, I might save some potatoes to add later on, as many of my potatoes had dissolved by the time we served.

Great flavor. I increased amounts to 6C potatoes and 6C broth, so I increased the cayenne to 1/4 tsp. Quite a kick. Also used 1C cheddar, and pureed half for a creamy consistency.  Will definitely make again.

This is EXCELLENT! I didn't have any regular chocken stock in my pantry, and my family is rather large, so I doubled the recipe an added what I DID have in my pantry-14 oz. of roasted garlic chicken stock, then I substututed water for the rest of the liquid and adjusted the salt so that it wouldn't be too bland.

When I served it, my son asked me to top it with a bit of shredded cheddar, a dollop of sour cream and some chives. This gave it a really good baked potato soup type taste.

It's cold and rainy tonight and this was a perfect cold weather soup with some crusty bread. Great recipe!

My family loves this soup. I didn't have the pepper(just used black pepper instead) and I added cheese at the table so it would be easier to reheat.

I used a little milk and also mashed the potatoes after it had boiled for 10 minutes to make a thicker/creamier soup.  I didn't have celery but we still thought it was delicious and would make it again.  We like spicy foods, but felt the cayenne pepper wasn't necessary and would either add less or none at all next time.

This soup is perfect for a cold winter night! My boyfriend was skeptical that it would be substantial enough to eat as a meal but he and I were pleasantly surprised. It's simply bursting with flavor and hearty and warming. The changes I made were leaving out the celery because I was out (didn't really miss it), and taking  out about half of the cooked potatoes and broth and mashing them in order to add extra thickness. I usually make a soup once a week and this will one will definitely be added to the list.

This soup was really good as is, but I did tweak it a bit. I don't use the bacon because it just gets soggy and chewy and doesn't add much flavor. Sometimes I add cubed cooked ham, but often I don't. I also add potato flakes at the very end to thicken it. I use red pepper flakes instead of cheyanne pepper. This soup is really good and very easy to make.

More work than my regular creamy poatto soup, but a good change of pace. I also added about 1/4 cup of potato flakes for thickening, as well as a dash of evaporated milk. Oh, and also doubled the cheese to one cup, as recommended. I also pureed half in the blender for a smoother texture. Great potato soup option for those who can't handle milk products.

This was a simple recipe and it turned out way better than I expected.  Not a creamy soup but it is really good.  I cubed the potatoes in about 1/4 inch cubes and they had a lot of flavor this way.  I didn't have enough to feed our family of four with the recipe.  Next time we'll double the size for sure.

YUM.  Increased cayenne to 1/2 tsp (I like it spicy) and used green onions instead.  I also used 3 cups cubed potatoes and 1 cup shredded potato (shredding all of it was far too tiring) and that made the broth thicker and creamier.  The second time I made it, I increased the broth to 6 cups, doubled the cheese, and added 4 cloves minced garlic to the initial sautee.  For a group of picky eaters, this is a great vegetarian soup (if made with herb bouillion) that you can sprinkle bacon bits onto for the carnivores.

This soup was fantastic.  I did however use leeks in place of onions and the chunky style hash browns for the potatoes.  With the hash browns I added them about 30 minutes before serving. Quick & Easy!!

I made this "waist-line friendly" soup for a large group at Christmas. At first a few comments were made about a non-cream potato soup. However, I'd like to report they were fighting over the last bowl..it was really a hit! Deeeelicious!!

I made this soup for my family last night, exactly as written.  It wasn’t bad, but it wasn’t great either.  We all agreed that it was missing something.  I think it just wasn’t creamy enough.  Next time (if there IS a next time), I think I’ll add a little half & half, and/or possibly more cheese.

This was a hit at home! I wasn't too confident that this was going to turn out so good but since I had all the ingredients in my pantry I decided to give it a shot. The only change I made draining the bacon grease. Who doesn't love cooking veggies in bacon grease! By accident I doubled the amount of cayenne pepper and I think it added a nice level of spiciness. It wasn't too hot considering that my one year ate it all up. When serving I added a dollop of sour cream and some cheddar cheese.

I have converted this recipe for the a slow-cooker. In lieu of sauteing the vegetables, I chose to place everything in the crock of my slow cooker raw , and set my timer for 6-8 hours. Gently stir in the cheese, and you will have the perfect velvety texture.  Serve with sour cream and chives and a nice dry cornbread!

I made the recipe as written, except I left out the celery because I don't like it and I decided after I'd put everything in the broth that my potatoes weren't cut small enough, so I ended up chunking them up with a potato masher. I thought the recipe was delicious as written. I'm not sure why anyone who read the title, description or ingredients would have been expecting a cream of potato soup, so I don't get all the "the soup wasn't creamy" complaints. It is clearly a broth based soup and a good one imo. I'm sure there are plenty of cream of potato soup recipes out there and this one could be converted if someone was determined to do so. Will definitely make again.

This soup is amazing and so hearty when the weather is lousy.  The only thing I omit is the cheese but that's just personal taste.  My boyfriend loves it with the cheese.  Perfect as written.  Thanks for such a lovely soup!

Wonderful recipe!  The family loved it. A great hearty soup on a cold day. I've made it twice: the first time by the recipe and then with two slight adjustments.  It's a great soup following the recipe. Different than the typical creamy potato soup.  The second time I made it I took the suggestion several reviews offered and added 3/4 cup of mashed potato flakes just before serving.  This thickened the broth up so it was more like a traditional potato soup. I then added 1/2 cup of pre-cooked bacon bits and served with cheese and the crumbled cooked bacon on top. 
This is a great soup as is and is great to modify.  A definite keeper!

My husband loved this, thought it had really good flavor. My son thought it had too many potatoes! LOL! I liked it but potato soup is not my favorite so we won't be having this real often. I left out the celery since we don't like it and I never cook with it.

I thought my kids would enjoy this, and I was right!  Thought it isnt a *pretty* soup, it tastes really really good.  I sauteed the veggies in the bacon grease, and added in a spoonful of sour cream in addition to the cheese and it's a total hit!  For me, I wouldn't add either cheese or sour cream.  Excellent recipe!  Try it!

You know a recipe is a hit when my 5 year old asks me to pack it in her lunch! This soup was FANTASTIC. I didn't change a thing. It was just hearty enough to serve as the main dish along with a salad and slice of French bread. Thank you for this new family favorite!

The kids absolutely loved this soup.  I thought it needed more salt than the 1/2 teaspoon.  Also added additional cayenne, some black pepper, and about 3/4 cup of whole milk (just because to me the cream in the potato soup is what makes it comfort food).  Topped with cheese and green onions.  The green onions were an awesome addition.

This recipe was super easy and super delish.  I didn't even use the cayenne for fear of too much heat.  I also used a hand blender and pureed the potatoes before serving and adding the bacon.  Next day the  kids were looking for the leftovers!

This was delicious!  I pureed the soup and liked it better than eating chunky potatoes, but that's just personal preference.  I let it sit a minute, then put it in the food processor.  Fantastic, served with crescent rolls.

I made this without the celery (didn't have any) or cheese (lactose intolerant), but added some chopped parsley alongside the potatoes, and cooked the onion and carrot in a bit of leftover bacon grease instead of oil. So good!

Delicious! I really did try to follow completely but first I realized I only had 2 potatoes, so I used a can of sliced potatoes also (couldnt even tell). Also I didn't discard the bacon grease I used to to saute onions. Everything else I followed except I omitted celery (gross) and at the end I wanted it thicker so I added a combination of corn starch and water. I also didn't measure the cheese just put a ton in because we love cheesiness. :) Sooo yummy and easy for a quick winter lunch!

This soup is very good.  I didn't add the cheese.  Instead, I added 2 teaspoons of chicken bullion.  I brought the soup to a boil and let is simmer for about 1 1/2 hours.  My husband had 3 bowls  ...that is saying a lot, he is very picky.

Awesome recipe for a chilly winter night! I used both bacon and diced ham from a ham steak. Also, didn't use olive oil, subbed bacon grease. Use a high-quality sharp cheddar cheese and serve with crusty Italian bread!

I didn't drain all of the bacon grease (left about 1 tbsp) and I used an immersion blender to make the soup creamy.

Not really sure what this soup was trying to be.  It wasn't creamy at all which made the starchiness of the potatoes stand out.  I tried to save it by adding some milk at the end and mashing it up a little, but it didn't help much.  The taste was good, but the texture threw me off.  I'll go back to my old creamy potato soup recipe.

This recipe is a winner!  I doubled the cheese and added 1/2 TBSP of butter and bit of cream to make the broth creamier.  The cayenne pepper is a nice touch - creating some zip with the cheddar.  A hearty dinner for fall and winter with a side salad.

Excellent as is. Sometimes the simplest things are the best! I left the bacon on the side so one could sprinkle it on top.

I am vegetarian, so I used vegetarian chicken stock and omitted the bacon and it was still very tasty! Even my carnivore boyfriend liked the veggie version.

This was very good.  I read the reviews and using reviewer suggestions, added 1/2C half & half, and increased the cheese a bit.  Before adding the milk and cheese, I used a hand blender and blended the soup just a bit.  Perfect texture.

this soup was so good!  after reading the reviews, i was a little skeptical but wanted to give it a try.  i followed the others advice and changed 1 c. of the broth to 1 c. of milk for the creamy factor, put in 1/2 tsp of the cayenne pepper, added a little more cheese and added broccoli for more veggies.  i want to make it again tonite!

Fantastic soup.  I was pleasantly surprise. The only alteration that I made was adding garlic and a little parsley since I did not have celery.

I made this exactly but used shredded potatoes (Simply Potatoes) from the dairy dept.  I was not impressed at all.  It had very little flavor, I ended up adding more cayenne pepper- probably doubled it to make it edible.

This is my all-time favorite soup recipe.  I make it pretty much as-is, but since I don't like to take the time to measure, I just use 2 cans chicken broth and 2 large potatos.  Wonderful soup!

Excellant recipe! I have changed the bacon to Hot Italian Sausage and added Rosemary. My wife and I both love the soup! i think she actually prefers the bacon but hey I'm cooking! Actually, this is one of two recipes i can do and enjoy doing if you don't count briskets and grilling. Thanks thanks thanks!

I made the recipe as written but doubled it.  My husband and I both really liked it.  I was surprised at how flavorful it was for not having much in terms of spices.  The 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper went a long way and provided the perfect amount of heat for us.  I will certainly make this one again!

This is good - I've been making at least one new soup a week this winter and some of them really rock!!  I am giving this a 4 star to differentiate this soup from the ones that rock.  I would make this again - it was very easy and the ingredients are always on hand.

Wonderful Wonderful Wonderful!!! As a new cook I found this recipe very easy and tasty. At -8 degrees this soup warmed up the entire family. This recipe will stay in my book ! Though it does not really come across as the "usual"potato soup that grandma used to make, it was delicious! Thank You very much for the delicious meal!!

YUM!!and easy!!  I cooked the bacon in the microwave- and added it as a 'garnish' to the top of the soup once it was dished up.  I followed the recipe exactly and used the immersion blender to puree some of the potatoes to make the soup more creamy.  This was easy and good and impressed our guests!  Win-win!!  Tasted great today for lunch too!

I love this potato soup.  It is the best comfort food ever.  The only thing I did different was use a whole onion, add 2 cups of cheese, add a clove of garlic, 1/2 teaspoon of Cayenne and I bought two 14 ounce cans of broth.  I whisked mine when it was finished.  This goes great with some garlic toast.  Thanks Kwollak for the aesome recipe.

This is one of my favorite soup recipes.  I never get a chance to try to freeze it, everybody loves it and it is gone in no time.

Excellent.  Pureed about 2/3 of the soup after cooking to thicken it up, and topped with chives and sour cream.  A definite keeper.

Loved this soup.  I did make a few changes - added garlic, deleted cheese and, because I served this for New Year's Eve, added fresh black eyed peas.  Many compliments.  I did use precooked bacon as well.

Very good. It was a little thin for my taste. Next time I will use something to thicken the broth up a bit. Otherwise, taste was wonderful.

A big winner with my family. So easy and quick to make, and so tasty. A great recipe as is, and can be modified to your personal freferences. Next time I'll add a small can of peas for added color variety. This is good with or w/o the cheese; kids enjoyed adding cheese at the table and watching it blend in. Could also add cooked chicken chunks.  This is a keeper and a new favorite.  Thanks!!!

Ever since finding this recipe about a year or two ago, it is a regular in our household. It is the perfect meal (and it IS a meal!) on a cold, wintery day.

I made a couple of modifications the second time I made this.  Added a few dollops of low fat sour cream at the end which gave it a nice flavour.  I also eliminated a bit of the broth in place of a nice full bodied white wine I had left over which was really good, and of course how can you make a soup with carrots, celery & onion without adding some garlic to the mix?  This is an excellent soup on a lazy kind of Sunday.

I followed most of the previous suggestions and came up with pretty good results.  I added a little milk and used potato flakes to thicken the soup a little bit.  I didn't have celery so I used a little celery salt to season it.  It was good.

This recipe tastes great and is so easy to make my husband made it to take to a sleigh ride party he and the kids went to!  If the soup isn't as thick as you would like when done, I always add a little bit of mashed potato flakes to thicken.  Highly recommend to everyone!

I omitted the carrots, celery, and kosher salt.  I also substituted black pepper for the cayenne.  I didn't cook real bacon but added bacon bits on serving.  Will add real bacon next time.  After the potatoes were cooked I added in broccoli tops and stems cut up small, approx 3 cups and cooked on low.  Once broccoli was cooked I added in one can of creamed chicken soup and the cheese.  I added more cheese than the receipe called for.  I also thickend the soup by taking a cup of the broth and mixing it with a few tablespoons of flour and then stirred it back into the soup pot.  My older kids don't like broccoli so they were not happy about the addition until they tried it.  they all came back for seconds.  Will make this recipe again.

A hit with my in-laws and my husband!  I used "Better than Bacon", which is a lean ham product that tastes similiar to bacon, instead of the real thing, but will probably try it both ways in the future - will definitely make again!

Good soup.  Changes I made:  Microwaved bacon then chopped it in processor.  Added about a tablespoon of the bacon drippings to soup and discarded the rest.  Chopped onions, celery  and carrots in the processor.  Also finely chopped two to three of the potatoes in the processor to thicken the soup.  Midway through the cooking I added a coup of fat-free mild.  I didn't add the cayenne pepper.

Thank you for sharing this great soup.

My picky daughter loved this soup!  Instead of using fresh celery, I used dried celery leaves and it worked out great!  Thumbs up on this one!

A wonderful hearty soup for a cold, Northwestern day (or whereever you may be).  Healthy, satisfying, and easy... can't ask for more!

Not my cup of tea. Bland and watery. But we like spice and cream! Give it a shot.

I am a 'soup person' all year round. This one is delicious. I added dried parsley for color and interest and a bit of garlic powder. I prefer to use fresh garlic but did not have it on hand.

I followed all the directions except one - the cayenne pepper.  Instead, I added extra black pepper - my stomach doesn't like the "spicy" part of this recipe, lol.  Other than that?  It was perfect and the hubby wants it again!  Score!

This is a great recipe to use as a template. Of course, I made it a little different, used more of everything. Added spices I needed to get rid of, etc. This recipe is really easy and doesn't use a lot of ingredients. It was very helpful. I didn't want to have to puree anything, and was looking for a very basic, easy recipe. I was not disappointed. Thanks!

I had my niece make this, I didn't have any celery so I subbed with green pepper. I added some garlic, and used Eden cheese, a white cheese here in the Philippines. Imported cheddar from the states is hard to come by, once-in-a-while in the local stores. A little salty, maybe from the bacon, I used Black Label. Next time I'll omit the salt. Other than that it is very tasty, I give it 5 stars!

It is just potato soup. Good. Healthy. You can make it as thick or thin as  you like it to be. You can do lots of other things with this recipe without ruining it.

Delicious! I added some minced garlic to the vegetable saute ( I used some of the bacon grease instead of olive oil for the saute). I added some cream at the end as well as a dallop of sour cream in the bowl.

I made this as the recipe as written, because it's only fair to judge it that way. My husband didn't sound interested in eating this soup, but had a little bowl of it. He then had another bowl. My adult daughter and I loved the soup. She did request that I mash the potatoes a little bit but only because my cubes were a bit big. This is a keeper.

I will make it again ! I did make some changes. I added the vegetables (carrots, onion and celery ) to about a tablespoon of the bacon fa, along with a small amount of garlic..  After about 7 mins on low I added the potatoes and broth , after 15 mins, I added a 1/4 cup of pumpkin. Then at the end I added about a cup of milk and the cheese and I used the emulsion blender to give some smoothness. Excellent  Served with Bacon sprinkled on top and some Italian bread with a salad of dark greens. Yummy ! Family agrees !!

Cheddar spoiled the soup. It tasted like Panera soup which I don’t like. I cooked it with Swiss , much better. I’m going to try with mozzarella.

If you want a creamy soup, leave out the cheese, puree everything, except bacon, and add a little cream.

I added about .5 cup heavy cream,  puréed half of the mixture, and doubled the cheese. My family loved it, even my picky 6 year old. This is a simple and delicious recipe.

A great option without milk or cream. Like other cooks, we also pureed half of it to create a thicker consistency, but that's all we did apart from the recipe. Will make again!

Made as directed for the most part, added a wee bit of bacon grease to the sautéing vegetables, added 2 tsp of Farm Dust. The wee bit of spice from the cayenne is just perfect. I will definitely be making this recipe again.

Like many, I just made minor adjustments. Added a little bit butter and milk, a bit more cheese, and mashed the potatoes. It was delicious.

the only thing i changed was to make it in slow cooker, and omit carrots because  i don't like cooked carrots and added a can of cream of chicken soup to thicken 1 hour before done.   but the next time i make it, i will wait to add my bacon at last minute, dicing it and cooking it crisp, since i love my bacon crispy.

This ridiculously easy and tasty soup is great on a cold November day. I used a cup and a half of cheese and a little more bacon because, well, I like bacon and cheese. I'll be using this one again for sure.

Made this with my granddaughter and she loved it! Sautéed  potatoes, onions and carrots in some of bacon grease. Yum! As other reviewers have said used half milk/half broth but also added 1 T each black pepper, dried parsley and basil. Did not add much salt due to the bacon. Love the cayenne.

I really enjoyed this, but I ended up adding 1/2 cup of heavy cream and 1 cup of cheddar cheese. It was very creamy and delicious. Perfect for any day. The only problem was that the potatoes were slightly bland so I prepared them with butter and sour cream beforehand.

this was a very simple and straight forward recipe. i added an extra half cub of all the veggies and a half cup of milk to make it a bit more creamy. I also used the left over bacon grease in place of the oil. 
Half way through cooking i took half of the soup and pureed it to add some thickness. 

Amazing soup will for sure be making this again!!

I went ahead and used regular chicken broth and sauteed the onion/celery/carrot mix in a little of the bacon grease plus a little olive oil. I had maybe as much as 5 cups of potatoes - when you chop, you don't want to throw away your work.

The cheese is what thickens it, so don't worry about thinking it's thin. I turned off the heat, stirred in the bacon and cheese, and my wife had just come home from work and said she was starving; meanwhile, I had a migraine and had a rolling tummy. This soup did the trick for both of us. It was great!

Made the soup according to the drections.  It was good but not great.  Broth very thin and runny.  I much prefer ham and potato soup with a thick cream broth.  This soup definitely needs "something" to liven it up.  It's almost like eating a very thin beef stew (without the beef).  It was good but I will most likely not be making it again.

Enjoyed this, family seemed to think it was Just OK though. Complaint was the bacon was soggy, maybe I should have used it as a topping? Picky, picky. They had no problem cleaning their bowls LOL. Will make this again!

I just made this soup and we already ate every bit of it! It was the best potato and bacon soup we've ever had. It was easy to make and did not require anything that wasn't already at hand. The only change I made was I used regular broth instead of the low sodium.

Very good soup!! I didn't have carrots so I added celery and corn. For cheese I used velvetta, because I love using it and all I had. Added a bit more parsley and a lot more pepper to bring in a bit more flavor... Otherwise very good soup!

I tried this recipe because it was the only potato soup recipe that didn't include flour or a rue-based canned soup. I have to keep to a gluten-free diet. It was delious, even though I was out of cayenne pepper. I made it last night and I'm making it again tonight, it was so good!

Delicious soup, just wish I would have made more. I didn't have bacon, so I used sausage. I sauteed celery and onions in the sausage grease; I didn't have carrots. It was a great meal, especially served with corn bread.

I thought this was pretty good - not my favorite, but good enough to make again.  I was out of celery (and don't care for it much anyway) so I threw in a handful of fresh chopped parsley and that was a nice addition.  I also added a couple extra pieces of bacon (obviously).  And after the potatoes had simmered, I mashed them lightly with a potato masher, leaving plenty of chunks but mashing just enough to give it extra thickness and texture.

The base of this soup was great, creamy and sweet to offset the bacon taste.  However, do not use peppered bacon.  It does not bode well in this particular soup.

This was AMAZING!! I doubled it for my family (my parents and siblings) of six and the pot was scraped clean! I did six slices of bacon as opposed to twelve because bacon is pricy, but they were long slices and I thought it was a nice ratio to the soup (though you can always have more bacon :P). I did make a few changes. I eyeballed the onion to my taste, used chili powder instead of cayenne pepper, sauted the veggies in the leftover bacon grease, and used a stick blender to make it just a tad thicker. It was AWESOME! Thanks so much for the recipe, I will definitely be using again!

This soup is really good. I like the fact that adding the bacon back at the end makes it stay crispy which is good. I used purple potatoes. Whole family loved it, definitely a keeper!

Great recipe AS IS! Made exactly as written and didn't even have any leftovers to put away. I've made this several times already and will definitely make again. I love potato soup and this is an awesome one! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

Absolutely delicious with some changes!!

Changes: Used the bacon grease instead of olive oil, use a whole medium yellow onion, 3 carrots, and 2 celery stalks, and about 7 white potatoes; Added a bit of minced garlic when the veggies were cooking; used black pepper instead because we don't like spicy; added some milk and used a mashed to smoosh some of the potatoes before adding the cheese to thicken it a little, added more cheese (monterey jack) and bacon because that's what we like.  It was still soupy and not a "creamy" type of soup, filled with veggies that weren't mushy but just right. will make again and again!!

One of my favorite soups to make! The entire family loves it. I get a loaf of sour dough bread from Panera bread to go along with it and there are never any leftovers!

Really good soup. Even my picky non soup eaters loved it and went back for more. I did use my hand mixer and slightly puréed it before adding the bacon and cheese but that was the only change made.  Excellent!

Pretty good but why are we draining all of that good bacon grease and replacing it with olive oil to sauté the vegetables? The rest of my changes were inadvertent. I accidentally purchased about half the potatoes which was fine because 4 cups would have been a lot. I also bought regular broth and it was nowhere near too salty. Not sure if some of these things were for health reasons but once you put bacon in it that's all out the window anyway.

This was a hit! Everyone went back for seconds (luckily I'd doubled it). I really hate when people "change" the recipe, but I did. I added 1 can of rinsed white beans pureed with some of the chicken broth to add more protein and I also added chopped up kale, about 3 cups, to add some more veggies. My daughter-in-law and granddaughter hate beans and never knew they were there. Just makes a bit thicker broth.

This soup is delicious, very hearty and flavorful. I went by other reviews, and pureed half the soup in the blender, leaving some chunks of potatoes and other vegetables. Also, I added the shredded cheddar cheese when I served the soup, garnishing with parsley. I served grand biscuits and a salad with it. It was the perfect meal, as we had a blizzard yesterday, and spent a good part of the day TRYING to shovel out.

I also loosely pureed the soup with an immersion blender leaving some large piece of vegetable.  It gave it a very creamy consistency.  My daughter said it was just like Panera Breads!  That is high praise from her.

I used diced  pancetta a instead of the bacon.  I also used my immersion blender to slightly  puree the veggies.  My husband loved it and asked me to make it again.  Terrific cold weather soup.

This was a good soup but I changed it up quite a bit. If I'm going to spend time cleaning and cutting up vegetables I'm going to make a pot full. I added more of all vegetables. Also added more bacon, cayenne pepper & seasoning salt. Next time we are going to add Italian sausage. I also added milk & instant mashed potatoes to thicken it. Very good soup. Served with warm bread.

I tweaked this recipe from the tips from other reviews I read.  I used a whole package of bacon, some minced garlic, whipping cream and milk to make it a white sauce instead of a clear broth.  I might even add ham pieces, sour cream and chives in it next time!  It was a hit at our bible study!  Delicious! :)

So this recipe actually forced me to write a review. It is Mmm Mmm good. I did follow some of the other changes, but just the small ones. I cooked the vegetables in the bacon grease and add a little bit of garlic. We love garlic. The people who are looking for the creamy potato soup, all you have to do is what the one reviewer suggested. Take out half the soup and purée it in a blender. It is amazing!! I do think the prep time is off, but I could just be slow cutting up everything. All in all, this is an excellent recipe, especially for those of us who can't have dairy!

Awesome!  I was out of carrots and celery, but cabbage worked just fine with a little celery salt tossed in.  This does warm you up on a winter morning.  I used pork broth, which doesn't get mentioned often, but is easy to come by in oriental stores and more and more by Knorr in the cubed broth section.  Great recipe, full of rich flavor!

I tried the recipe with a twist, i used the bacon fat to saute the carrots, potatoes & onions, after which i poured a little of the pork broth unto the pan to pick up more of the flavor of the bacon.  After deglazing the pan, i poured the veggie and soup to the rest of the pork stock in another pot. I didn't add the cheese but just settled for a lighter soup.  My family enjoyed the soup so much! Thanks a lot! I love it!

cooking it with the lid off thickens this soup  I also added a cup of milk replacing 1  cup of broth and use bacon drippings instead of live oil.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was just ok.  It didn't really have a lot going on, so I added about 1/4 pound of velveeta and it made a world of difference! I still don't think I will be making this again.

I made this as directed, and it was perfect.  Next time I might try bacon bits instead, and/or turkey bacon.
The potatoes didn't taste very good the next day.  But the soup was my absolute favorite!

I thought it was too thin and a bit flavorless to begin.  I added lots of spice (salt and pepper, thyme, basil, etc.) and also some heavy whipping cream to thicken it up a bit.  I also used twice the amount of cheese the recipe calls for.

This was good.  I gave it 3 stars because it didn't seem to have much flavor.  I will make again but will experiment with different seasonings.  I scaled the recipe to 9 servings because I wanted leftovers.   I also added too much broth (3 cans) so there was way too much liquid.  My fault as I didn't measure the broth.

This soup is very good! I added a couple of slices of ham diced up in place of half of the bacon and a few cubes of velveeta. I will be making this again!! Thanks for a great recipe.

Soup was great. I mashed the potatoes like others suggested and I think that made a big difference. I used low sodium bacon because my husband has to watch his salt but I ended up adding it to my bowl, this soup needs salt! Pretty easy, good for a weeknight.

This soup was yummy! I added a little more bacon and I mashed the potatoes with a hand masher in the soup after they were cooked to make it thicker.  Delicious!

So good...I added the chicken (cut into small pieces) from the stock that I made for the soup and it was delicious (would have been delicious without the chicken)!  It was excellent the next day for lunch.  Thanks.

This one's a keeper!  I substituted ham soup base for the chicken broth, and pureed half the potatoes for a creamy texture as other reviewers have suggested.  Very simple; very good.  (I had trouble finding ham soup base locally but finally found it online)

Delicious! I took advice from a couple of the other members and before i put the cheese in I took out most of the potatoes and mashed them which made the soup creamy, then put the potatoes back in the soup mixed and added the cheese. It was so good. This recipe is a keeper! Thank you Kwollak!

This was great soup.  My husband had potato ham soup at a pub and wanted me to make it.  This was the closest to what he described.  The only change I made was to add ham in place of the bacon.  I added the ham (about 3 cups) about 5 minutes before adding the cheese.  I only had a block of cheese so I just added small chunks of cheese (did not want to get the grater out) and it turned out just fine.  When making this make sure you stir it a little more often after adding the cheese to ensure it does not burn.  My husband said it was even better than the pub’s soup!!

Loved it. I substituted some evap. milk for the chicken broth. I added potato flakes to thicken and garlic powder and season salt for extra flavor. I've eaten it three days in a row and I'm ready to make more.

We ate the soup but thought that it would have been a lot better if we just made cheese soup and then added bacon to it (with the potatoes and carrots of course)It also would have been better if I didn't add the cayenne pepper. Gave it an unappealing flavor.

I chopped the bacon, then fried it in the soup pot (wiping out the most of the grease before adding the veggies).  My husband wished it was more creamy so I may add milk/cornstarch to the leftovers and see how that turns out.

This recipe really turned out great.  My wife loved it.  But I would suggest starting with a bigger than 3 qt saucepan.  As I "adjusted" the recipe, it seemed to grow in size.

This was a hearty, fast soup that is easily made with staples from your pantry and fridge. I added
about 34 cup of milk, and thickened the soup   with some corstarch. I also increased the cheese to one full cup. I served it with crescent rolls and my family gobbled it up!

I chose to make this in my crockpot.  I put in 4 cups of water, 5 chicken bouillon cubes, and then the carrots and potatoes.  I sauted the onion and celery in butter before I added them to the pot.  Also, I used the precooked packaged bacon and cut it up and threw that in.  I did not use cheese and wow!!!  This was really good.  Not bland at all--the cayenne pepper really makes the difference!!!

Very good soup.  A few changes I made, regular chicken broth, mashed the soup a bit, added some half and half at the end and a few dashes of hot sauce.  My 7 year old loved it.

I'm not really sure why this recipe calls for low fat, low salt chicken broth and then adds kosher salt to the recipe? I didn't add any salt after all the bacon that goes into the soup, it was plenty salty enough.
