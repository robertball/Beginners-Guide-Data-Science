I like this cooking method for beets although I use the microwave rather than the stove top.

How the recipe turns out, though, will depend on your pesto.  Mine is strongly garlic and I found the garlic clashed with the beet rather than complementing it.  I prefer a mix of olive oil, salt, pepper and either sage or thyme rather than the pesto.  YMMV.

I was more interested in the method in this recipe as opposed to the ingredients.  I don't have pesto right now, and although I could have made it, I didn't really feel like it.  I just used minced garlic instead, and it was a hit.  These beets are good roasted!  Thanks for the recipe!

All the pesto melted away during cooking, so these just tasted like roasted beets.

Not bad, but did not have much of the pesto flavor.
