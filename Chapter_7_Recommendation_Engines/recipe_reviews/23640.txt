Good recipe.  I used two 9X5 loaf pans instead of the 8X4's,  I also baked the breads for one hour and fifteen minutes.

Instead of coriander I used 1/2 tsp of Mace and only 1/2 tsp. of ground cloves.

I also made a Maple butter, by stirring in 3 tbs. of Grade B Maple syrup into one stick of softened room temp. butter.

I have a dual degree in the Culinary Arts, and have also worked in Europe as a Pastry chef.  Suffice it to say, that it is indeed a good product when I decide to add it to my personal recipe collection; but when you accidently drop a piece on the floor and THE CAT eats it, IT IS A VERY GOOD recipe indeed!

This is an AWESOME recipe for pumpkin bread!  We have tried several of the recipes on this site (trying to use up many pumpkins worth of pumpkin!) and this is by far the best!  It's not as sweet as many we tried, full of savory flavor and extremely moist.  This is our new favorite quick bread recipe!

This is probably one of the best that I have come across.  I replace the walnut oil wiht canola oil and toasted pecans in place of walnuts.  I also baked in a bundt pan and used a maple glaze and served with the maple butter from another review.

Very nice as is.  As I prefer things a little less sweet I cut the white sugar down to 1-1/3 c.  The sherry is necessary to provide the acid to activate the baking soda and to add liquid to make the steam that raises the bread, so if you don't want to use it, sub with apple juice concentrate or orange juice or strong Earl Grey tea, that will do the same things the sherry does.  You may want to sub powdered ginger or allspice for part of the cloves, since for some so much clove may be a bit overpowering.  The walnut oil is wonderful, but the less expensive sunflower seed oil or peanut oil is almost as good.

This bread is AMAZING!!!  It is so rich and flavorful.  The only thing I changed was that I used pecans instead of walnuts because that's what I had on hand, other than that this recipe is perfect.  The walnut oil really gives it a wonderful flavor.  I would not try to substitute it unless you want to use a different nut oil like pecan or hazelnut.  I'm not a fan of sipping cream sherry (my mother told me it used to be her favorite drink over ice), but if you sip it while eating a slice of this bread the flavors just burst in your mouth - this bread is incredible!!

This has become one of my most treasured recipes. I use raisins instead of nuts, and my favorite trick is to soak the raisins in the sherry for at least 20 min before mixing up the recipe.  I recently had to substitute some applesauce for part of the oil when I ran out, and found it was just as good as ever... will probably do that from now on to cut down on the oil. (1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce.) Thanks for this yummy recipe!!

Made this using pumpkin pie spice and extra mace and ginger. Also used half T each baking soda and aluminum free baking powder, got immense lift. Used 2 cups chopped toasted walnuts (we love nuts) would be good with pecans or toasted pumpkin seeds too. Soaked 1/2c craisins in the sherry warmed in microwave for one minute to help absorb. Used half butter half oil, little shy on the oil. Went half cup less on each sugar measurement. Add the eggs to the creamed mixture before adding pumpkin as with all baked goods.  Baked 6 mini loaves (40min) and one dozen mini bundt (30 min). Perfectly baked, no goopiness. I have never had good success baking full size loaves with most quick breads, so I don't! Would have made 10 mini loaves without the bundts. I filled everything using a 1/4c/2oz disher (average icecream scoop) and one was perfect for the muffin size, three heaping each was more than enough per loaf.  Mixed warm softened 8oz creamcheese with 3T real maple syrup for a drizzle to serve. Not too sweet and very delicious.  Heading out to take mini loaves to homebound elderly neighbors.  Yay autumn!

Have used this recipe for the past 2 years at our cafe & it turns out perfectly every time.  Ice it with a cream cheese/butter icing & sprinkle with toasted pecans.  We have customers coming back looking for this bread & have taken plenty of special orders too!!! Definitely a keeper!!

Great recipe!  I made a few healthy substitutions.

I used 1 2/3 cup of defatted soy flour, the rest regular flour, 2 1/4 cups of Splenda and 1 cup brown sugar, 1 1/4c egg substitute instead of eggs.  Also used dried cranberries and raisins instead of nuts since there is a lot of fat in the recipe.

The bread turned out very moist with a delicious cream sherry flavor.

I only had a 15 oz can of pumpkin so I halved the recipe and made 18 muffins instead of loaves of bread. I liked the flavor-it was definitely something different and spicey, but the muffins were a little *too* moist. I'm not sure if it was something that only would happen to the muffins, but that detracted from eating them. Something I think I'll try again.

Excellent Recipe! I didn't add the cream sherry or nuts (my husband hates them) and it was absolutely perfect! I will keep this recipe for sure!

Fabulous...followed one reviewer's advice to soak some raisins in the cream sherry for 20 minutes before adding to the mix.  A terrific idea, because you pick up the richness of the sherry (I used Vanilla Cream Sherry from NY State) in every bite. My husband and son thought this was a terrific pumpkin bread. Thank you for sharing the recipe!

Delicious!  I made some of this because it is fall and it is time to enjoy some of the delicious breads of the season.  This is not exception!  I made one batch, and while I had to substitute the walnut oil for safflower oil with some Hazelnut extract, it turned out wonderfully.  I will be making more as soon as I get the walnut oil it calls for as I think that nutty flavor was the only thing mine was lacking, and the hazelnut was just a little tame.

This was pretty good but would have been amazing without the cloves.  Normally cloves goes well with pumpkin, but the flavors clashed for some reason.  Without the clove it was REALLY great.

I have made this bread for over a decade now around the holidays and it never disappoints. I change nothing and it's perfect every time. Make this recipe and you'll never need another.

I made 2 changes, used 1/2 cup walnut oil (expensive) and 1/2 cup canola oil plus reduced the white sugar to 1 cup, loved it - baked within the time listed - had never ground my own coriander before - wow smells so good - did toast the walnuts - have added this recipe to my favorites

Not Your Mother's Pumpkin Bread:  A wonderfully moist and delicious bread!  I used olive oil instead of Walnut Oil (it is rather expensive and I was trying for the first time), and cooking Sherry instead of Cream Sherry (perhaps that's the same thing??).  Put into two 5 x 9 loaves.  Made full, lovely loaves
of melt-in-your-mouth pumpkin bread.   I will make small loaves to give as gifts!
