Was looking for something different for breakfast.  This is great.  I used walnuts instead of almonds and added a little shredded coconut.

My family LOVES this! It’s excellent as written but also incredibly versatile. Apple is delicious as is blueberry, peach, and mixed berry (fresh or frozen). I adjust the honey depending on the sweetness of the fruit. And I’ll switch out the cinnamon for other seasonings such as lemon zest with the blueberries. I don’t mix the nuts in when cooking but have them available as an optional topping. We serve it in bowls and pour milk over it like a hot cereal. Sometimes we’ll splurge and top it with lightly sweetened whipped cream. Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!

I love this!  So quick and easy to make for a healthy breakfast. I wouldn’t use as my Sunday night dessert. The only thing I changed is the coconut oil.  I used cinnamon maple Ghee instead. It’s what I had on hand and figured it would work perfectly and it did. This recipe had a granola type consistency which would pair well with some Greek Yogurt.

It turned out okay, I doubled the cinnamon and halved the honey. The amount of honey probably should vary depending on how sweet your fruit is but 1/2 a cup is a lot.

This is one of my favorite breakfasts. I have my own homemade apple pie filling so I often is a quart of that rather than the cut up apple part...
