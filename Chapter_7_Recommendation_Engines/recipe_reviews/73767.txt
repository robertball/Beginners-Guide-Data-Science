As the original submitter of this recipe, I have since changed a few things when I make this. I sautee the mushrooms in soy sauce and water. I use roasted red peppers from the jar instead of fresh and I sprinkle fresh basil leaves on top. Also, it helps to cook the dough for about 5 minutes prior to adding the toppings. Glad most of you are enjoying it!!!

This pizza is delicious!  I also sauteed the garlic, peppers, and mushrooms beforehand, and added a dash of white wine, and some fresh rosemary and oregano.  Then, to give it a little bite, I sprinkled crushed red pepper all over the dough before baking.  It was great :)

After reading some of the constructive reviews, I cooked the sliced mushrooms in the microwave first so that I could soak up the moisture with a paper towel. I also raised the cooking temperature to 375 degrees and still cooked it a little longer than the suggested 20 minutes. I’m a new cook at age 65, but I’m not afraid to try something out of the ordinary such as this. Because I do the cooking 3 nights each week, this was ample for my wife and me for two meals. It reheats OK in the microwave. I liked it well enough to take the picture. I’ll make it again.

Tasty, beautiful, simple recipe. Loads of toppings; I used orange and red bell peppers and sauteed all the veggies and garlic in olive oil and flashed with balsamic vinegar instead. I loved how the goat cheese added a nice tang and saltiness. Next time, I'll try roasting / grilling the vegetables too to add another layer of flavour. Thank you for sharing this Stephanie!

Wonderful!!!  Very yummy.  I used homemade whole wheat dough, which went well with this rustic style pizza.  I did two thing differently.  I add caramelized red onions after the garlic and I used herb flavored goat cheese.  I'll definitely be making this again.

This was absolutely the worst tasting pizza ever.  My husband who will eat just about anything, couldn't touch more than one bite.  AWFUL.  Can't believe the time I wasted preparing it.  Makes me not believe the reviews anymore.....

I took the suggestion of adding crushed red pepper flakes to the dough, and didn't pre-saute anything. Wonderful!

This was so good.  I thought it would be dry with out sauce but the vinegar, olive oil, and garlic made it taste as if it did have sauce.  It might be good with sun dried tomatoes.

It was very good, healthy and so easy. We haven't had pizza in a while since my husband and i are both lactose intolerant and this was an excellent alternative. The goat cheese is very tasty. I thought it will be a little dry but it wasn't at all. You can put any vegetable or meat you want and it will still taste good. I've been making this almost every other week now.

Very good. Added a bit of additional seasonings. Also, I sauteed the peppers and garlic before adding to the pizza and baking.

I had a bunch of extra artichoke hearts and goat cheese from a holiday dish and came across this recipe. My family isn't used to sauce-less & mozerella-less pizza but I gave it a shot anyway! I made some whole wheat pizza dough and followed the previous suggestions of sautéing the veggies prior to placing them on the pizza. Also took the suggestion to bake the pizza dough for 5 minutes before adding the toppings. I didn't have olive oil (shocking, I know) so I used the oil from the artichoke heart marinade as the base layer on the crust. This recipe was easy, delicious, and got rid of my extra ingredients! For the record, my family ate the entire pizza and didn't mind that it was sauceless!

I made this using jarred roasted red peppers instead of the fresh ones, cremini mushrooms, goat cheese and artichokes. I also made my own dough. The toppings were great, but the pizza seemed really dry, even with the olive oil and balsamic. It definitely needs some sort of sauce, and I doubt I would make this again without that. Dipping in ranch helped, but still wasn't perfect.

This was a great pizza!!! I didn't have Balsamic vinegar so I used the Balsamic Vinaigrette I had in the fridge. I have already told 2 people about it and just made it earlier this evening. LOVE IT!

This was ok - I liked all the ingredients, but I felt something was missing.  I think next time I'll add some spinach and maybe just a little mozzarella underneath the veggie toppings to help bind everything together, as all the veggies and goat cheese kept falling off as we ate.  I did reduce the balsamic to maybe 1 tbsp - just enough to get a taste, but not enough to overwhelm.

This was amazing pizza! I think I'll be making this over and over. I used marinated fire roasted red peppers, marinated canned portobella mushrooms, and sauteed a yellow pepper with the garlic. I added a splash a white wine to the peppers, too. I baked the dough for about 5 minutes, then sprinkled it with crushed red pepper, and the toppings as listed. Absolutely divine.

This was awesome!  I carmelized onions in olive oil, added everything but artichokes and added a little lite soy sauce.  At the very end I added artichokes and I added the balsamic to the veggies - I used a high quality balsalmic.  I cooked the crust for 6 minutes at 400 degress and then put the remaining ingred on top - I also added slices tomatoes and black olives the goat chesse and through some FF feta top!  It was great the next day and was not soggy at all.  I think mixing the balsamic with the veggies instead of spreading on the crust directly is the saver of not being soggy!  I will def make AGAIN!  Oh yeah - i then baked at 400 degrees till hot!

This is one of our favorite pizzas at our house.  My husband found this recipe when we were dating.  We frequently take it to parties and our friends love it. very unique flavor combination, just be careful not to go overboard with the balsamic vinegar.

I made this pizza 2 ways: one as written, but the veggies were sauteed and I added caramelized onion and wilted spinach. I used the same veggies on the second pizza but spread a layer of hummus on the crust instead of the olive oil and ommited the balsamic. I thought both were tasty but the hummus pizza got much more praise from my friends. I would make either one again, but would probably add a little bit of red pepper flakes.   * Make sure to bake the crust for 5 minutes before adding toppings. Even with pre-baking my crust, it was still a little soggy.

My friend forced me to try this, because it's not the kind of thing I like to eat at all, but I was surprised at how good it was. I'll be making this to take with me for lunches in the future.

I thought that this pizza was very tasty. It was a nice alternative to traditional pizza. The goat cheese and balsamic vinegar flavors are very strong, so this recipe probably would work best if you REALLY like those two ingredients.

Sounded better than it actually tasted. I just think that it needs some tweaking.  The balsamic vinegar/ goat cheese combo was a little overpowering ( and I love both usually).  I will attempt this again with some changes.

This was delicious.  I sauted the peppers (also added some onion). Didn't have portobello mushrooms, used button instead and it was just as good. It was a hit with my family. Will make again.

This pizza was awesome.  I, too, was worried about not having a sauce (my husband also commented on it while I was making it) but it was fabulous.  Definetely a keeper.

I htought this was great! It's got all my favorite things :)  I used peppers from a jar.  I sauteed the mushrooms, peppers and artichokes in olive oil first.  I cooked the pizza crust for 5 minutes before topping.  It was great!

this is delicious and very easy! a few variations i made: i sauteed the mushrooms and spinach in white wine vinegar before putting them on the pizza dough. i also spread garlic on all the pizza dough (not just the crusts) and also added fresh basil. next time i will add sundried tomatoes for extra tang. this is is a delicious, light pizza!

This was AWESOME!  I sauteed the garlic, mushrooms and peppers and added some red onion in some soy sauce and water.  I also used herbed feta cheese since the store didn't have any goat cheese.  I made fresh dough from a receipe on the site.  I will definately be making this again.

This is a great recipe because the toppings can be easily changed to suit your guests tastes.  The only problem I had was getting the crust to bake all the way through without burning the top.  Next time I will either use a premade  crust or grill the pizza.

Good stuff!  We did make our own crust...it just tastes so much better.  Also, we sauteed the veggies before baking (no artichokes on our pizza), and pre-baked the crust.  If you like "zing" this is your pizza.

Rather disappointed; crust was soggy. Suspect it may have been from the mushrooms and balsamic vinegar.  Flavours were good. Doubt I'll try it again.

I did not like the flavor of the goat cheese it was really strong and the vinegar made the crust soggy.

Fabulous! I used crimini mushrooms since I couldn't find Portobellos and I quickly sauteed all the veggies. I also added fresh and sundried tomatoes, and fresh basil. A knife and fork pizza due to the oil and vinegar but a definite "make again". Thanks.

I found this pizza to be very tasty. I used baby bella mushrooms and only half the amount of the artichokes. Also, I used half the amount of goat cheese and mixed it with feta to keep it from being too tangy. I am making it again tonight for my boyfriend. I will add some red onion (cuz he likes them), olives and crushed red pepper flakes to the dough. I'm sure he will love it!

Delicious! The toppings compliment each other well. Saute the mushrooms first. I used two 6.5oz. packages of pizza crust mix and made a 16 inch pizza. I raised the oven temperature to 400 and cooked for about 20 minutes. Came out great!

since I couldn't bring a pizza to the party I was invited, I used the same list of ingredients, chopped them, then put about a teaspoon of mixture on a triangle of cresent roll, rolled it up and cooked for about 16 min.  Came out great.

I thought the toppings were fantastic, but next time will add sauce. Was much too dry. Also, I subbed roasted red peppers for the fresh red pepper and added fresh oregano and basil.  Tasty!

This was the most flavorful pizza I think I've ever had! I sauteed the mushrooms in olive oil and garlic. I also roasted the peppers for about 20 mins in olive oil, salt and pepper. This was easy and looked and tasted like a gourmet pizza when it was done. The only thing I would change is I will use a bit less balsamic next time. I love balsamic vinegar but it was a bit strong. Does almost carmelize while it's cooking. Thought I would add cheese (b/c I always do :)) but 4oz goat cheese was perfect! YUMMY!! Oh...I also added a bit of sauce as you can see from my pic.

I didn't like it at all, and my daughter thought it was one of the best things I'd ever made, so I split the difference and gave it 3 stars. My complaint is that the balsamic vinegar seemed to overpower the taste. Also, you have to make sure it's all eaten that night -- the leftovers were soggy.

Great pizza. Added fresh spinach and bell peppers.  Pillsbury crust is my favorite.  :) I would serve this to anyone!

Too much bell pepper and mushrooms, would not fit on crust, but it was pretty darn good.  Will make again.  Added some red sauce since boyfriend likes sauce on pizzas.

This is pizza was excellent. I did make a few modifications based on the reviews. I partially baked the crust ahead of time, which seemed to be a smart move. Also cooked the peppers, mushrooms and some spinach in a pan with soy sauce prior to baking. Used some fresh basil out of my garden, along with dried oregano and some salt (go light on the salt, the goat cheese is already salty enough). I also sliced some cherry tomatoes in half and threw those on top. This combination was wonderful and I wouldn't do anything else different. Thanks for the recipe, I will be sharing it with friends for years to come.

This was quite nice.  I made a variation, I used a whole wheat pita bread instead of a pizza crust, because it is what I had, plus it made a nice thin crust. I added carmelized onions, and used rehydrated shitake mushrooms instead of portobello, and added fresh spinach chopped.  It was quite nice and the vinegar and goats cheese really goes together for an interesting taste.  Next time I would roast the peppers first.
