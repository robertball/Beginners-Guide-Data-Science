Two stars from me as the published recipe makes no mention of what to do with the onion, bell pepper and celery. Personally, I browned the Andouille and chicken in olive oil, then threw in the veggies, and sauteed til they were soft. I used a whole can of diced tomatoes, and also added a little garlic powder. I ended up adding about 2 cups of water so that the rice cooked completely, and everything else didn't dry out. This is not the kind of meal to make on a 90 degree day when your AC isn't working :( We enjoyed this but it was a complete pain to make.

Edit: Allrecipes has corrected the recipe, so I'll up my rating to 3 stars.
