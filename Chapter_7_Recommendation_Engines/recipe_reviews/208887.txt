Loved it! No butter used olive oil instead. 24oz.of baby bella mushrooms. Used fat free 1/2 & 1/2 instead of skim milk and used a sweet red pepper in place of the wax.  I love dill so that with mushrooms are amazing anyway. Filling and hearty yet low fat and low carb. Very tasty and will definately make again!

Loved this soup! This gave me the base for what ended up being one of the best soups I think I've made! I had to adjust because my hubby is allergic to dairy & wheat (so no flour, milk or sour cream) and I added extra spices for personal taste. I bet it is wonderful just as it is but here are my additions for those that may like them. Used soy flour, plain soy milk, cubes of firm tofu, 1 can of stewed tomatoes & extra chicken broth. Spices were dashes of curry, smoked paprika (along with the sweet Hungarian paprika as listed) seasoned salt & pepper. Fantastic!!

This soup is awesome!  I love that it didn't have cream in it.  I added a couple diced tomatoes at the end and toasted some bread to add as a crouton on the top.  Super flavorful for something that doesn't have meat in it. I didn't have chicken broth so I just used water and it was still great!

Just like my Mom made over 70 yrs ago. Only thing different, she used wild mushrooms that we gathered in the fall. Some were dried and some were canned.  The soup was a mainstay at Christmas Eve dinner. Oh, for the good old days!

Excellent! I followed the recipe exactly, except for using regular butter, milk, and sour cream instead of unsalted and lowfat varieties. I added a few more chopped tomatoes to the top of this when I served it. So there I was, trying to decide if I like this Hungarian mushroom soup better than the other Hungarian mushroom soup on the site and...oh! I don't HAVE to decide, huh? What a relief! Thanks for the recipe!! :)

Fantastic hearty soup. Brings back memories of wild mushroom soup my father used to make. Along with fresh rye bread it becomes great comfort food

I made a few changes to make this a vegan soup. Used 1 1/2 cups soy milk and no sour cream. A tad of Olive Oil instead of butter. A few minor changes too, based on items on hand. Still was great! Will make double next time.

Spectacular! I have a Hungarian wax pepper plant and I'm trying to find recipes using them. This one was a sure winner! I didn't have any fresh dill so I used 1.5 tsps dried dill instead. This soup is rediculously good! i used a mix of baby bella and white mushrooms. I love that it uses skim milk and light sour cream, too. I only used a quarter of a tsp of salt instead of the full one that the recipe calls for, as well as low sodium soy sauce. I didn't have Hungarian paprika, so I just used regular paprika. After removing the wax pepper and tomato, I ended up chopping them up and using them as a garnish. I usually do not care for dill but it was perfect in this soup! I can't wait to make this again!

This is a very tasty recipe but I can't give it 5 stars because it just wasn't as "hearty" as the other reviews would lead me to believe... I made it exactly as written (except for the Hungarian wax pepper) but my soup never thickened as I expected and I ended up adding rice to it to make it more filling. Otherwise, a good recipe - I will definitely try it again and hopefully have better results.

This soup was as good as its reviews.  I used a yellow hot pepper in lieu of the wax pepper and normal paprika. Fantastic.

After Irene hit the East Coast I cleaned the insides from three siblings refrigerators because of no electricity.  The most common find were three containers of almost (to old) mushrooms. I decided to fry them up-a friend suggested making a mushroom soup!! Found your recipe-and WOW- what a hit. The various ingredients really gave it the extra touch!!Thanks!!! LKM

This recipe is good. I didn't change a thing. I did leave the tomato cut up in bite size pieces and it tasted great in the soup. I will make again.

Very filling, and delicious! Used olive oil instead of butter, veggie broth, and soy milk. I used smoked paprika because I didn't have the sweet. We loved it!

A delicious, filling, easy recipe! I used 1/2 cup tomato sauce instead of the tomato and 1/2 mild red pepper and a dash of hot chili instead of the pepper suggested, because I didn't have any. Thanks for sharing this - a future stapler in our house!

9-20-2017  ~Rich, satisfying and immensely mushroom flavored.  I used no flour, but substituting heavy cream for the skim milk made up for that nicely.  I used no Hungarian pepper – black pepper did the job adequately for us.  The tomato and Hungarian paprika contributed to a complex flavor, but gave this soup incredible visual appeal as well.  Other than my small changes as a matter of personal preference, this required no tinkering.

This was ok, however, I thought the consistency was a little thin.  Also, I'll definitely add more paprika next time.

One of the best mushroom soups I have had in a long while....I did make some alterations (and in no way am I say it is better this way as I did not try it the original way) - I used my own hot paprika - I like things a bit spiced up - I roughly chopped a couple of tomatoes and threw them in about 5 minutes before serving -I actually slivered the raw pepper and mixed it into the yoghurt which I dolloped on top just before serving - I had no parsley so I used finely chopped coriander..  A nice warm and filling soup (if you chop chunky it is almost like a stew!)

Was looking for new ways to use my Hungarian wax peppers out of the garden and this soup was a great find. I think I will be making this a few more times this summer, so I can freeze it and stow it away for the winter. As an aside: while making the soup, I did not discard the pepper or the tomato as I felt they added great texture and depth. Other great features of this recipe is that it is very filling as well as satisfying and can be easily converted into a vegetarian option. Overall a wonderful recipe, thanks Geneva for sharing!

This is incredibly creamy and delicious!  Even though it's 90 degrees and humid outside, I'm cooking this soup and enjoying it with the A/C on.

DELICIOUS!! Rich and creamy without being fattening. I didnt use low sodium broth, and it was perfect. I accidentally used hot paprika instead of sweet and it had a kick, but we loved it! Next time I may use 1/2 sweet 1/2 hot. This is a keeper.

We loved this soup! I used baby bella mushrooms, full fat sour cream, whole milk and reg chicken broth and only 1/2 t salt. This was one of the best mushroom soups I have had. Thank you for sharing!

I made this soup in my instant pot. It was excellent! Full of flavor and very creamy. I would made again, with perhaps a variety of mushroom.

Excellent soup!  Used the recipe, substituted Greek yogurt for sour cream.  Very rich tasting.

I haven't made this; yet. But the comments that say, "I made this exactly as written, "except"", and, yet yield 4, or 5 stars, is laughable. The most helpful review is full of substitutions. 

I'll make it, as written, and get back to you.

I love mushrooms cooked any way, or just fresh so this was on point for me! My store doesn't carry sweet paprika so I just used my smoked and we also do not have the wax peppers but I did find sweet banana wax peppers that were jarred so I just used those. I also used veg broth vs chicken because it was for me. I chopped the tomato and about four banana peppers ( they were small ) and didn't remove them after simmering.....honestly, I forgot they needed to be removed but once they were chopped I had to commit to it....The flavor is really nice and I love the large bites of mushrooms and the color, I will make this again! Thank you Genevajones!!

I loved the subtle flavor the tomato and wax pepper added to this soup and would recommend not skipping that step and of course with all Hungarian soup recipes you need a really good Hungarian paprika and fresh dill is a must.

I have this soup many times and love it! It is filling and different. It reminds me of the kind of Eastern European soups my Mom used to make when I was a child to keep me warm and a to make sure I had a full tummy. Love using veges as much as possible.

I did make some changes to this recipe because I wanted more vegetables in the mix. I added some carrots with my onions and instead of adding half a tomato, then removing it, I chopped it up and left it in there. I omitted the pepper since I didn't have the type called for in the recipe. Loved the outcome. It tastes like it's a rich soup but the calories are  low enough that I didn't feel guilty pairing this with a grilled cheese sandwich for dinner. My husband was skeptical but had two bowls once he tasted it. Will definitely make again.

Excellent! I scaled this down to four servings, using 8 oz white mushrooms and almost the same amount of shitake mushrooms. The shitakes were dried, and I reconstituted them in water. I used that rich, mushroom liquid in place of the chicken stock. For the tomatoes, I just halved two Campari tomatoes and just over 1/4 tsp cayenne as a sub for the wax pepper. I used regular paprika, and it was fine. I almost left out the sour cream because I didn't want to open a new container, but it really adds a nice layer of flavor, so I'm glad I used it. I'm sure it will be better after it sits a bit. Thanks for the great recipe!

Excellent soup recipe!  Lots of mushrooms and delicious flavor. I used a jalapeño pepper and other than that I followed the recipe exactly. We loved it and I can't wait to make it again!

Followed the recipie. I'm a neophyte cook. My family loved it. Not all were mushroom soup lovers but still liked it. Its a hearty soup mostly because of the ton of mushrooms. Dealing with the volume of mushrooms and onions was an issue (i doubled the recipie). Took large tri-ply pan as well as the soup pot. I put some mushroom stems in there but mostly i cut off. This was mistake one because some were kind of rubbery. No one noticed this but me. At the end as well i thought i'd thicken it a bit more and sprinkled in a little more flour at the end. Now i know why you wisk the flour and milk together. The sprinkle method caused clumping. Most of it dissolved in the simmer. So thats the story but the soup was terrific.

Excellent recipe! Made exactly as written. Didn't have a Hungarian wax pepper. Heck I never heard of those or seen one. So I used a dash of cayenne pepper. Also I used regular chicken broth and half and half instead of skim milk. Very filling and tasty! Will make again! Thanks for posting!!!

My wife and I made the soup as written except we used 2% instead of skim milk, and it turned out wonderful.  Great flavor and very hearty; it's a fantastic Fall or Wintertime dinner accompanied by a piece of crusty, warm french bread.  I think this recipe would also be good with barley added to it.

Excellent flavor. I used Portabella mushrooms.  I also thickened the sauce by running half the mushrooms through a food processor. It gave it more of a bisque texture than a broth soup.
