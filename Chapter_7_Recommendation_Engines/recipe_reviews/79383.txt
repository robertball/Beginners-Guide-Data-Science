YUMMY!!!!! I made this soup last night in the crock pot. It was YUMMO...LOL..i made a few changes though. I used 4 Tbsp of butter (Big Fan of Ms. Dean) 5 large potatos, 4 stalks of celery(diced) 1 cup of baby carrots, 2 whole tomatoes cubed, 2 whole onions diced, dash of rosemary, 2 Tbsp of italian seasoning, 2 cups of milk, 2 cups of chicken broth, ( almost the same) half a can of red beans w/o the liquid) and i added a whole keilbasa. i had no cornstarch so i put a little bit of flour ...i was cookin it on the stovetop but it was taking too long and i had to go somehwere so i put it in  the crockpot for about 4 hrs on low (long enough to cook the potatoes...) when it was done i served it with croissant sandwiches...so hearty and when my hubby asked me what it was called i said HEARTY MAN SOUP...he loved it. so fibrous and healthy....... when done add salt and pepper to taste to your liking....will make again.......

This is one of the best soup recipes I have ever made!  I have been searching for a recipe like this, we have a local restaurant that serves a baked tomato soup with veggies in it that is out of this world, and this is the closest I've ever come to recreating it.  I changed a few things, I used a 28oz can of tomatoes, and pureed them before adding them to the soup.  I also omitted the celery, as we don't prefer it.  I added grated parmesan cheese on top, but am going to try feta cheese next time.  Thanks so much for sharing this!

This recipe is really surprising -even after all the reviews, I didn't think it'd be that good.  It was though, really good.  After sauteing the onions, spices and garlic, I "deglazed" the pan with a bit of white wine, waited til it had evaporated and then added the others according to the recipe.  I used primarily fresh herbs, making up my own Italian seasoning, and finished the soup with a touch of sherry and more fresh herbs.  Presented with fresh rosemary and shredded parmesan, and served with garlic herbed scones.  Healthy, sophisicated, delicious.  Thanks for the recipe.

A fabulous, easy soup...it was perfect for a rainy night.  I added two chicken breasts cut into bite sized pieces to make it a little bit heartier for my hard working man, and we ate it with warm french bread...yum! ;) Infinitely better than soup from a can! Thank you!

I have made this soup 4 times and love it!  It is a mellow, creamy comfort soup and is not meant to be super spicy.  Make sure that you use enough onion and garlic.  The first 2 times I did not have a premixed Italian seasoning so I used a combination of dried basil, oregano and rosemary.  I think the flavor of this soup develops as it stands so I suggest making it a little ahead of time and letting it "sit" for at least 30 minutes before serving. As you would imagine the leftovers are wonderful.   Great with grilled cheese!

This is so good! So fresh tasting. I did have to cook mine longer. I used less potato. I didn't have tomato paste so I used 1 sm can of tomato sauce. I wasn't sure what kind of tomatoes to use so I used a can of diced petite tomatoes. Before serving sprinkled with parmesan & Italian Herb Seasoning from a grinder. Delish!

This is a great recipe!!  My husband hates potatoes in soup and he had  two bowls.  I served it with beer bread.  Perfect for supper on a cold Sunday night. Also, I let it simmmer for much longer than called for in the recipe.

I'm not sure what I was expecting, but I wasn't overly impressed with this. It was like a vegetable stew, in need of sliced kielbasa or pasta or something. It also confirmed what I have been suspecting for a while: that I personally prefer creamy smooth soups. Thanks anyway.

This was ok.  I thought the broth was good but the potatoes seemed very bland.  We ended up adding a lot of garlic salt and pepper to make the soup more flavorful.

DO NOT cook this soup according to the directions! It needs to simmer A LOT longer than instructed. The flavor was great but the veggies are not tender in 20 min. Simmer 35-40 min. and it will be delish :)

Very yummy!  I made this for my teammates in China and they asked me to make it again.  I had no cornstarch, but it didn't make a difference.  Very tasty and great flavor!

This is a good hearty soup, but I agree with another reviewer - it needs to simmer for at least 1 hour so the vegies can cook and for the flavours to blend together.  I think it would be even better if served the next day.  When I make it again, I'll make if for the next evening's meal.

This was excellent.  My wife is really into soups and said this is her new favorite.  I omitted the carrots and onions. I also added the seasonings while sautéing the potatoes and celery in butter.  This is a wonderful recipe I will make it again and again.

This was very good and I will make it again. Like most of us foodies we have to make it our own so I added sweet italian sausage to mine. I plan to make it again with little meat balls.

We love this soup!!  Be sure to let it simmer for at least an hour.  I always double the minced garlic (adding it to the onions to sautee about 20 seconds before adding the other veggies), use 2 cups of chicken broth, and add 2T fresh chopped basil to it 15-20 minutes before serving.  Great flavor!  Substituting an 8oz can of tomato sauce for the tomato paste doesn't hurt the overall outcome at all.  I will usually add a couple cooked & cubed chicken breasts for the hubby to make it even heartier (use a total of 3-4 cups chicken broth if adding chicken).  Highly recommended!  Per another reviewer, I've found that 1 1/2 tsp salt & 3/4 tsp of ground white or black pepper is perfect.  I have also made a vegetarian version with vegetable broth instead of chicken broth for a vegetarian family member and it was a huge hit!  If you don't mind the added calories, topping your bowls of soup with a sprinkle of shredded italian four cheese blend is really yummy!  Thank you so much for the recipe!  :)

I'm always looking for recipes I can adapt to the crockpot and make dairy-free for my dairy-allergic family. This one did beautifully! Didn't even bother sauteing the onions, etc., just threw everything (including vegan margarine and soy milk) into the crockpot and let it simmer on low setting for the entire day. Turned it to high, stirred in the cornstarch with a little extra cold milk and let it sit for another half hour. Very tasty the first day and even better the second - thank you for sharing!

this was really good, it was intersting though! i was expecting it to be like canned tomato soup with just some potatoes added into it, but it was definitely more of a vegetable soup! i really liked it though, and even my husband who always says "i'm not much of a soup guy" really liked it and said it filled him up!  i followed it exactly, omitting the carrots and celery.

I made the following changes. This soup was fantastic! Olive oil instead of butter, added 28 ounce can of diced tomatoes with liquid, more garlic, 2 zuchinni diced, less celery, more carrots, only 1 potato, 2 cups chicken broth. This was thick and yummy and lovely. My toddlers didn't love it, but they're toddlers. Topped with grated parm...super yummy on a cold night and full of great veggies.

I think this is a great soup base.  I prefer more spices so I adjusted that, added zucchini because I had some on hand and pureed my tomatoes.  Next time I'm going to try adding cabbage and hamburger.  Yum!

we enjoyed this, but it definitely needs a bit of tweaking. i love stew type soups, but this was really stodgy!  i scaled it down for 4, which required half a can of tomatoes, but i ended up chucking in the lot.  i might omit the cornstarch next time and see if that helps.  i also threw in a handful of elbow macaroni.  next day when reheating it, i added some white wine and some water to it to give it a bit more liquid consistancy, and added some lemon juice and it made a world of difference.  i served it sprinkled with grated cheese.  think i'll add some red bell pepper next time for a slightly fruitier taste too.

This was really good. I added a pound of shrimp and another whole can of diced tomatoes (didn't think it had enough tomato taste) and I accidently added the whole 8 oz can of tomato paste. My family like, even my picky eater. With my changes, it ended making about 12 servings and 2 cups is still only about 280 calories; an awesome diet staple! Will definetly make again and play around with it, maybe with some smoked sausage or chicken. Thanks!

In all fairness, the only reason I rated this so low is because of the milk.  I don't really like milk and I didn't realize this recipe called for milk until I started making it.  It is edible, but I will not make this again.  The picture looks so good, but milk in soup is not my thing.

This recipe was okay. I had to add more garlic, some basil and onion salt for more flavor. It was pretty bland the way it is, way better the next day though.

My whole family really enjoyed this recipe. It was filling and healthy. The chopping did take a bit of time. Next time I will double it so we can have it with dinner one night and for lunch the next day.

Great soup,healthy and tasty!  I added a couple cans of condensed mushroom soup! Kicked it up a notch and added volume. Also I used a lil chicken concentrate and more spices than it called for :) thanks for the great recipe! :D will definitely make again! freezes well also!

: )  Cheated and used purchased diced celery/onions, shredded carrots and used the mini chopper for the potatoes so it wasn't so "chunky" due to health issues here.  Little bit more chicken broth, couple more cloves of garlic and whisked the cornstarch with the milk prior to adding as scared of lumps.  Also used a bit more tomato paste as I had no need for it and didn't want to freeze the leftovers.  Thus practically no need for much added salt and pepper.

This was a simple, tasty vegetable soup that I will make again.  A good base for adding any veggies you choose.

Very delicious soup!  I made it in the crock pot and added the milk shortly before serving.  I also halved the recipe.  I did not use cornstarch and my potatoes were left over seasoned roasted greek potatoes cut up.  Sprinkled pepper & parmesean cheese on top. (Did not add salt as I used canned tomatoes which I find salty to begin with)

Great to make and take to heat for lunch at work.  Planning my garden accordingly so I can have plenty of tomatoes to freeze so I can make this thoughout the winter.

This recipe is great and easy to play around with and make your own. I used red bell peppers instead of celery and four small-ish fresh tomatoes (peeled) instead of the canned variety. I let the onions simmer in butter with the peppers until tender and added the tomatoes (halved) with the broth and then used a hand mixer/blender to make them creamy before adding all the other stuff. Oh, and I grated cheese (something neutral like mozzarella) over top like in the picture-- delicious!

Really tasty and chunk.  I too used the crockpot, actually overnight, and the vegetables did not get too squishy.  Instead of corn starch, I added a few mashed potato flakes -- tastier and just as effective.

I wasn't sure how this would come out, but it was excellent! Only changes: I cooked the onions in olive oil, and added parsley flakes, garlic salt, celery salt, and oregano. I did everything else exactly as the recipe called for, and I will definitely be making it again. So easy but such an awesome twist on regular tomato soup. Thanks for the recipe!

Super Yummy!  I always add my cornstarch to a little bit of water and wisk it ... add the water mix to the soup - it never clumps this way.

Loved this soup, it's a definite keeper!  Even my husband, who doesn't like tomatoes, likes it! Pureed tomatoes before adding to mixture to make it less chunky, didn't have any celery to put in it. For a kick, added 1 Tbsp chili powder.  Great tasting healthy meal with salad and French Bread!

Husband had one bite and said it was a keeper. Next time I will chop the vegetables a little smaller, it took longer than 20 min.I added 1 tsp. ( all I had) oregano leaves and 1 tsp. Of Emeril's Original Essence. Will be making this again.

A great hearty and healthy soup! I added a cup of alphabet pasta during the last six minutes and omitted the milk and cornstarch since the starchiness of the pasta thickened the soup quite well. I also seasoned with a few dashes of smoked paprika, a pinch of cayenne and a tsp or two of sugar to add some depth. I sauteed some cubed chicken breast (marinated in lemon juice, minced garlic and EVOO for an hour) and added it in at the last moment, too. Delicious! Sometimes something so simple can be so good. A soup tip to remember: the longer you simmer, the tastier it'll be. I simmered for about an hour.

WOW this was Amazing :) I changed a couple things though. I omitted celery. I didn't have italian seasoning, so i used Oregano, basil, and Clubhouse Garlic Plus Spice.  I did not have tomato paste, so i used 1/2 can of tomato Soup and 3-4 tablespoons of Medium Salsa. I also added 1 1/2 whole tomato. It was scrumptious!! Perfect for a cold or snowy sunday. Served with warm buttered Buns :)

This was more of a chunky vegetable soup and I am not a big fan of those, so my rating is based on my husband's opinion.  He loved the soup.  I think I will do this in a crock pot if I ever make it again.

I used 1/2 the amount of celery, 1/2 the amount of Italian seasonings and added frozen corn.  It was more like a creamy tomato veggie soup.  It was very tasty.  Will make it again.

We like tomato soup, and we like potato soup, but we did not like this combination of ingredients.  We felt it was bland and that the italian seasoning dominated the soup.  We did like the overall texture of the soup, and I added other seasonings to salvage it for a meal, but won't be making this again.

Not great: I followed the instructions exactly and left out only the corn starch, which wouldn't have impacted the flavour anyway, which was blandish.  Too much celery flavour, not enough spice. Edible, but won't make this again.

Such an easy yet filling soup!  I followed the recipe except I used soy milk instead of milk and added a can of corn.  Next time I make it I will probably add some chipolte or cayenne to give it a bit more zing.  Thanks for a great go-to recipe!

Used pureed fresh tomatoes instead of canned ones. I didn't use the full amount of potatoes or onion, and used equal amounts of milk and broth. However, I found this soup to be way too thick. I think maybe increasing the total amount to 3 cups milk and 3 cups broth would work better. Seriously, it was so thick, you would have thought it was baby food!

This was great!  I made it into more a vegetable soup by adding about a cup of fresh green beans, a can of corn, and 2 cups of diced onion.  I omitted the celery, but added some celery salt for the flavor.  My boyfriend finished most of it before he even thought about the fact that there was no meat!  Thanks for a hearty, healthy meal!

This is a great recipe though I did make a few changes. Instead of butter I used olive oil to saute the onions and garlic. I used 1 1/2 onions instead of two.  I used two 14oz cans of diced tomatoes (pureed). I shredded a pre-cooked whole chicken. Instead of italian seasoning I used only basil. This was so creamy and I never needed to add the corn starch.

Very tasty! I did follow the first reviewer's suggestion & added a pack of diced smoky links. Yum! I also went ahead & put in the whole 6 oz of tomato paste, rather than 2 T. It worked great. It calls for salt & pepper to taste. I ended up adding about a 1 1/2 t. of salt & 3/4 t. of white pepper. This is a really good recipe. I'll definitely make it again.

Super-excellent soup.  I used tomato paste and fesh tomatoes instead of the canned tomatoes.  I would add a few cups of water as well when it gets too thick-especially when re-heating. Quite a bit of chopping time but worth it.

Pretty darn good. I'd make it again.

I just used one onion, fresh celery and added a bag of frozen peas, corn, carrot & green bean mixture).  1 can of crushed tomatoes plus one small can of tomato sauce.  Plus I used the whole carton of chicken stock because 2 cups wasn’t near enough liquid to cover the ingredients.   I also had to simmer it for about 40 min until the taters to soften up.

This is a great base recipe!  I took aleismommy's advice and made this in the crockpot, I let it go for 4 1/2.  My husband is Mexican, so he's always asking for spiced up recipes, and this does well with the heat turned up!

I added a small can of green chiles, substituted tomato based sofrito for the tomato paste, and substituted adobo for the italian seasoning and salt.  

SO good!

Low fat, healthy and delicious?  Awesome!  I just made this tonight for dinner and we all loved it.  Living in China, I don't have all ingredients available at all times but the only sub I had to do was fresh tomatoes for the canned, and added more paste to give it more of a tomato flavor.  It is also very easy to throw together once everything is chopped.

I made this recipe and it turned out pretty  well, however, the taste was a little bland so I added some cheese to it and that really helped.  I also did not use the recommended number of potatoes either.  I do not plan on making this recipe again. -Jessica

This has the potential to be a delicious vegetable stew! Great basic idea but the recipe needs tweaking. My vegetables were (adult) bite-size and nowhere near done after 20 minutes of simmering...give it at least an hour. I added 2c veg broth and still needed to add more water after simmering so long. The seasonings, in my opinion, need changing up, too.  It's not bland but just not homemade yummy (waaay better than canned if that's all you're used to though). I'll definitely make this again but with enough changes to not really be this recipe anymore.

This is very good as is but there are lots of goodies you could add. I like it because it has to be a healthy soup without meat and all those good veggies. I do think it would be good with smoked sausage. I made this in the crock-pot, cooked it all day on low. When I got home from work I added the mixed milk and cornstarch. Then turned in on warm till we were ready to eat. Would be great with a gormet grilled cheese sandwich!

Pretty good hearty soup and a great way to use up whatever veggies are lying around. Added sliced fennel with the onion and didn't really measure the vegetables. Left alone, taste is probably just alright. Replaced the chicken broth with shrimp stock. Added some hot sauce, cayenne, beau monde, celery seed, fennel seed, and a couple bay leaves after the first 25 minutes of simmering and adjusted to taste every 20 minutes or so. Probably a bit thick (more of a stew now) but very good taste and Italian sausage would be a good addition for meat eaters.

I made this recipe exactly as it was written but added fresh chicken breast cut into bite size pieces and fresh spices instead of dried.  Cooked in a slow cooker.  The kitchen smelled wonderful.  Put it in the fridge over night, heated the next night, and it was too bland. One of the worst recipes I have ever made.

I didn't change the recipe too much. I used 4 cloves of garlic, didn't put in celery and I used flour instead of cornstarch. Next time i will add spinach. My 6 year old ate two bowls! I will make this one again.

Simple, good soup! I used a can of petite diced tomatoes that had garlic and olive oil in it for the tomatoes.  The only things I changed were to use less onion (a personal preference) and no tomato paste because I didn't have any. Will definitely make again!

Really tasty and simple to make. I used a 28oz can of tomatoes and after cooking the onions, poatoes,carrots, spice and milk I added the remaining ingredients to the crockpot to simmer all day. Next time I will add the amount of tomatoes called for to have a creamier soup.

This is my favourite winter time soup.  I cut my pieces of potato pretty small, so that may account for the difference in cooking time.  I find this is best made with a 2% milk or higher, but that's just a personal preference.

This soup is lovely.  I made a few important changes, however.  I doubled the quantity of tomatoes, eliminated the cornstarch (didn't make any difference, so why add it), and most critical, simmered the soup for two hours instead of 20 minutes.  My whole family loves the soup, even my 8 year-old son who, on principle, hates all fruits and vegetables.

Way too much italian seasoning.  I had to add a lot of chicken stock just to counter act the seasoning.  We didn't like this much.  The photos really make it look appealing but not so much in person.

My family didn't care for it, but maybe they just don't like chunky tomato soup that uses milk.  I've made non-milk chunky tomato stews that they loved.  I thought it was okay, but too heavy on the Italian seasoning.  For anyone who wants to try the recipe (it's had lots of good reviews), I would suggest starting out with less than the whole tablespoon of Italian seasoning and then adding more if you think it needs it.

As written bland, make changes with seasonings if you make.  I added salt, pepper, and garlic powder.  I also blended some of my soup at the end to give it a smoother texture.

Tasty soup. My husband added 1/2 tsp thyme and 2 cans of clams. A bottle of clam juice would be perfect too. It turned into a wonderful Manhatten Clam Chowder. With some french bread we had a very tasty dinner

I did this in the crockpot with the following recommended modifications: doubled the garlic, 28 oz can diced tomatoes instead of 14.5 z whole, additional 3/4 c chix broth, one sliced zucchini, and additional 1 T tomato paste. I did 1.5 tsp salt and .75 tsp white pepper.   It took *forever* to get the potatoes cooked (12 hours on high?) - but maybe that's because the ol' crockpot might be dying on me - and then I added the cornstarch diluted in the milk.  It was just ok.    I doubt I'll be making again, for all that work.

Very good.  Mixed the tomato paste in with fire roasted tomatoes.  Also put the corn starch in to the milk, blended it before adding it to the veggies.  A little too much onion for me and I added a dash of cayenne pepper.  My husband liked it and said I could make it again.

So good! I loved that this was so easy and so hearty! Definitely warmed us up on a cold fall evening..and when I told my mom I made a soup from scratch later that night..she was impressed that I came home from work and still had time to make a homemade soup in time for dinner..definitely a keeper!

this recipe was delicious and easy to make. i added some cream instead of milk to add a bit more thickness and dilluted the broth a bit for less sodium. i had to simmer the soup a bit longer for the potatoes. the seasoning was nearly perfect, i might add a touch more next time. but overall, this is a very good recipe for cooking beginners or advanced cooks who want to experiment! my family is extremely picky and they couldnt get enough of it! will definitly be making again very soon!

I wasn't crazy about it.  I think it needs more  spices added.

This recipe was great!! I modified it a bit, used 1/2 cup of dry milk powder and 2 extra cups of chicken broth, and I cooked the carrots and potatoes in a separate pan until they were "Nearly done" Then I added them to the soup. It worked out awesome! We will add this to our family recipe book!

Made for 6 servings. Tripled the amount of garlic called for. At the point where the recipe says to add milk and bring to boil - there wasn't really enough liquid. Added the water/boullion at this point to get all veggies under the liquid level to cook them. Came out perfectly - veggies were not too hard, not too mushy.

Wonderful taste - rich and creamy soup, but with the lovely chunks of healthy veges.  Didn't change a thing except that I replaced chicken broth with plain water to cater for a vegetarian guest. I didn't think it was necessary to make vege stock separately since it would have been the same ingredients anyway! Didn't detract from the taste at all.  Made it twice already for company, and my guests were impressed.

This was really really good, I loved the broth.  I added kidney beans (which didn't do much for the flavor), and smoked sausage (which was good).  I think next time I'll put some cut up squash or zucchini and maybe mini meatballs.

I wasnt paying attention and forgot to add the broth, but it still came out great!  Also, I
didnt have canned tomatoes so I threw a few fresh ones in the food processor and used that instead (added them before the milk).  I think this recipe is a great one to have printed in your kitchen bc you can easily substitute ingredients and make it with whatever you have on hand (as long as you have potatoes). This one's a keeper. Thanks!

A good recipe, but it wasn't a 5-star. Good flavor, consistency. It will take longer than 20 minutes of simmering to soften the potatoes and carrots.

pretty good.  I put it in the crock pot.  Used tomato sauce because I didn't have paste.  Also cut up 3 bacon slices and added it for a smokey flavor.

I liked this....I was out of a few of the ingredients, but even then, it was a terrific stew.  I added 2 teaspoons of sugar to give it a more "Brunswicky" taste...LOL.  I am not a fan of tomato sauces, but with the addition of sugar it made it a very tastey dish for me!  Thanks a bunch!

This is WAY better than I thought it would be! The only changes I made were adding double the garlic, plus some paprika and white pepper.

Delicious, quick-to-fix.  Since I had no tomato juice or paste on hand, I substituted two cans of tomato soup - worked well. Want to try it with the tomatoes and paste to compare.

I made the recipe according to the directions, but it did not turn out very creamy- more like a minestrone.  It is filling and the flavor is fine but not interesting enough to be a repeat .

Made it basically as written with a few minor adjustments due to shortages and surpluses.  Little less celery and carrots and added some fresh tomatoes that needed to be used.  I gave it a four because I did end up liking it but when I tasted it at the end it still needed something.  I added 1/4-1/2 tsp. of crushed red pepper to spice it up a bit and that helped enormously.  It ended up needing to cook for at least an hour.

Made it last week. Great recipe! Changed the serving for two as I live by myself. I was looking for a meatless soup for Lent and this was perfect! Only thing I changed up was replacing the celery with chopped basil instead, and a handful of spinach (greens I had in the fridge). Serve with pesto on top and a side of bread. Yum!

VERY goood!!!!  2 things I added, a couple of chicken boullion cubes, and way more "simmer" time, about 2 hours.  I think ALL soups benefit from a long, low cooking  time.  I will definitely be making this many more times, thanks for sharing.

Very good! I used 1/2&1/2 instead of milk to make it richer. I didn't need the cornstarch as it was already thick. Added extra garlic and italian seasoning to boost the flavor a little.

Followed the recipe and it was really good.  I was surprised at the cornstarch ( only 1tablespoon) but it gave it that made with cream silky texture that the potatoes alone can't give it.  With summer around the corner, I can imagine this with some fresh zucchini, fresh basil, maybe even eggplant.

It was ok, I found it was good the first day but the second day it was not as good. Usually soup gets better as it sits in the frig. Made the recipe as written. If I make it again I will tweak it.

I made this for dinner tonight. Delicious, cheap, easy! I followed the recipe pretty closely (but veg stock instead of chicken). The only real difference was that instead of dumping in Italian seasoning, I made up my own with oregano, basil, and cumin. Also, I put the spices in to cook with the onions as a way of jazzing up my old stale spices. I topped the soup with Black Diamond Italian blend shredded cheese and a spring or two of the leaves from the celery stalks. I served it with Black Pepper and Olive Oil Triscuits which added even more spice. My boyfriend and I both had seconds :D I might try simplifying it for cream of tomato soup sometime.

This was good but not what I was expecting from the earlier reviews of 4 or 5 stars! I found the spices odd with the milk. I will make it again but next time I'm going to add some grated aged cheddar to it and leave out the spices.

I modified this slightly.  I used Italian stewed tomatoes and left out the Italian spice.  I used two cans of the tomatoes and left out the paste.  I also substituted the celery with zucchini and baby corn.  This was yummy and I'll definitely make it again.

Very little flavor and I couldn't think of anything to add to it to make it better. I don't like standing in the kitchen chopping veggies that long for a dish ... if I do, it better be worth it! This wasn't ... maybe I'm just not a good enough cook to figure out what to do.

Very yummy soup! My only edit would be to cook it longer as the carrots and potatos needed more time to simmer.

Per a previous reviewer I added more diced tomatoes and for the chicken broth, I had some homemade turkey broth that I used.  Great taste and a fabulous rich soup. I couldn't wait for the cooler fall weather to make it and I'm glad I didn't.

My niece came to spend her March Break with me and we made this recipe.  It was sooo easy and sooo good (oh yeah and sooo cheap).  She's a teenager and she liked it.  I'm a vegetarian and so I just switched in veggi stock and it worked really well.  Thanks for the new addition to my recipe book!

I really wanted to fall in love with this soup but for some unknown reason it never reached my expectations. My hubby and 20 month old daughter ate it but there were no compliments that came my way. I don't think I will make this again. Thanx for sharing cloudless

To us, this tasted kind of like beef stew without the beef.  It was good, but tasted like it was missing something.  After simmering and adding salt and pepper, I added some seasoned salt, about half a teaspoon.  Garnished with a dollop of sour cream and that helped a bit, but probably won't make this one again.  Thanks anyway!  Served with a cheddar bay biscuit clone.  I'm going to add some cooked chicken tomorrow to the leftovers and see if that makes it more to our taste.

A very good hearty soup. I had to cook it quite a bit longer than specified here though, my potatoes and carrots were still raw at the end of the 20 minutes. Still, when it was done, it was delicious!

One of the best soups I have tasted! I added spicy turkey sausage and only used one onion instead of two. Two seemed like overkill. Very flavorful and was great over some Italian herb polenta.

I gave this soup 3 stars, my husband gave it four. I'll defer to his rating since I'm always impressed when he likes something vegetable-based and am willing to give bonus points for that. But I thought it was just average.

WOW!! We added turkey kielbasa, fresh spinach and lots of extra garlic and this turned out fantastic!!!  We used a whole carton of chicken broth and 4 small fresh tomatoes to enhance the flavor as well.  This dish requires some time if you choose to use fresh ingredients but is well worth it.  Will add to our favorites list!

This was a pretty good soup. Easy to make. I brought the milk to a near boil very slowly, but it still broke. Once the rest of the ingredients were added you couldn't really tell. I had to use about 3 Tbsp. cornstarch to thicken the soup. Also I only used about 1 tbsp. butter initially. Will make again, but not a 5 star recipe for me.
