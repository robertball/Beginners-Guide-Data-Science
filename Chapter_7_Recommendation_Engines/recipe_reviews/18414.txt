I made this for Easter with ham and cheddar potatoes and everyone loved it.  I just sent the recipe to two people who requested it.  Don't skip the lemon zest part.  It adds to the flavor and a great presentation. I let the asparagus marinate overnight as I like to do as much prep in advance as possible.  I also blanched for longer than one minute...maybe 3 minutes...as my asparagus was not thin.  I didn't serve the balsamic vinegar on the side.  It really didn't need it.  Overall, a healthy, easy low fat recipe.  I'll repeat it again and again.

This was awesome!  No one in my family expected to like this, even me, but it was really great.  Very different and unique.  It was simple to make and looked absolutely beautiful on the platter with the lemon zest on top (for prettiest results, sprinkle lemon zest on after parsley, salt and pepper).  I can't wait to serve this for my healthy-eating aunt; she'll be in Heaven!

It was allright. Nothing you can't do with packaged Italian dressing. Also, keep in mind that two pounds of asparagus is a LOT.

I have never EVER liked asparagus before but decided to give it another try as I am on a hypoallergenic diet and am in need of some ideas.  I used "Mama's Balsamic" dressing off this site as the marinade.  It was soooo tasty.  I am so glad I found this recipe.  Thanks!!

This is my favorite way to cook asparagus....hands down.  I have eaten it both cold, as directed, as well as grilling or roasting the asparagus after marinating it for some time. All ways are good - thanks for sharing the recipe!

Great recipe for a veggie I usually add butter, salt and pepper. I used Ken's bottled light olive oil vinagrette and added balsamic vinegar...My family thought it was a tasty take on asparagus.

I think this would have been better for me if I had used a better balsamic vinaigrette dressing? I didn't really like eating them cold, either. I gave 4 stars b/c I didn't realize how easy it was to cook asparagus perfectly! Next time I will blanch and then seal in bag with soy sauce, salt, pepper, parsley and then cook them a little in a dry pan.

I didn't eat these, my husband beat me to it.  He found them marinating in the fridge and gobbled up half of them at once. I only made a half batch.  He finished off the rest a few hours later.  I never did add the lemon zest or salt or parsley, but I'm assuming the vinaigrette is what gives it the most flavor anyway.  Gotta give these five stars because hubby loved them so much, also he said they'd be great in a bloody mary.

This was a nice addition to a fried chicken, mashed potato, and gravy meal. I used a 2.5 lb bunch of asparagus I bought from Sam's and I did not add salt or parsley. I marinated it overnight and took it to the family get together of 17 people. I did add the lemon zest and pepper before serving. Everyone raved about it and there were no leftovers! Even my sister-in-law who doesn't like asparagus said she liked this. It is a great, easy, make ahead side dish. Loved it!

I followed the recipe but did not cut the asparagus.  I made individual servings on a bed of lettuce and sprikled Feta cheese over it.  Made a beautifully presented salad.  Good tangy taste.

Delicious! I cut these spears up and put them on skewers with marinated mushrooms, grape tomatoes, and cheese raviolis bathed in pesto sauce for a BBQ appetizer. Everyone loved them, thanks so much for the recipe!

It was okay but nothing special.  I would rather save my balsamic vinegar for marinated zucchini on the grill.

After marinating overnight, it wasn't as pretty as I would have liked but was a real pleaser at Easter dinner.  The boiling time really depends on the type of asparagus you buy, if the stalks are small and tender a minute is perfect.  I skipped the parsley, it wouldn't have added much.  Thanks for sharing!

I made this for Easter and it was a huge hit! I made it the day before which is always a plus when cooking a large  family dinner. I blanched for 3 minutes as my stalks weren't the pencil thin.  My husband liked them better before I added the lemon vest, but it sure looked pretty. I wanted the girls from work to try so took in on Monday, now they all want the recipe and even 2 days later they weren't mushy.

This recipe is just great.  I made it for passover dinner and it was a huge hit.  Very easy to make in advance.  The lemon and parsley give the dish allot of depth.

turned out excellent and I didn't even prepare the correct way. Recipe says to marinate for 3 hrs. I didn't read ahead, but served it anyway after marinating after only 5 min or so. Was still very good. AND very EASY. also, one of those recipes that gets better the next day. Will definitely make again.(served with flounder, was a great meal)

I made this for thanksgiving as a side dish, and now my mother, my sister and my boyfriends mother all have the recipe and have made it for friends!  It is lowfat, easy, and really tasty.  Even great to put over lettuce to spice up a salad!  This recipe has become a new tradition in my family.  Thanks!

Excellent! Very easy to make, hardly any effort required at all. Tangy dressing and asparagus make a great combo. I made this as a side dish to Thanksgiving dinner, and surprised everyone. I'm putting this on my "potluck dish" list.

I took this to a pot-luck at my office and many people raved about it and
asked for the recipe.  No one felt it needed the extra marinade on the side. 
It is an elegant vegetable to serve at a brunch, casual or more formal dinner.

We like asparagus, so I tried it, and the family liked it.  I added a small jar of pimentos for color -- didn't add to the taste, but it gave the dish more interest.  I would have preferred roasted red pepper, but didn't have any on hand.  I think it will be on my list for holiday meals.

I only made a few asparagus spears to garnish each plate at dinner tonight, and it was wonderful.  Used my own homemade balsamic vinaigrette recipe to marinate; served with the curried chicken sandwich made famous by Oprah, on homemade challah bread from this site.  Thanks so much, J Carter!

Fast, easy and colorful addition to summer meals. I served this with grilled leg of lamb and roasted red potatoes with rosemary. Followed the recipe exactly, but also added some diced red pepper and white onion sauteed in olive oil for extra color. The lemon adds a nice flavorful touch. Yum!!

I thought this was pretty darn good. I am not an asparagus lover, but when it is cooked just right and with a good sauce like this, I can definitely eat it. I was too lazy to do the lemon zest part, so left it off.

A great tasting veggie that's quick and easy, if you have the time to let it sit in the dressing.  I didn't prepare as much of the asparagus as the recipe called for and still used the same amount of dressing.  I wouldn't want to add any dressing over the top again though, the asparagus absorbed plenty.  I will probably reheat the asparagas before serving next time though.

Family member took recipe with her! Most asked for recipe after meal. Did have problem with blanching for "one minute" needed to blanch longer. Asparagus a little crunchy. Will have again for next party.

This recipe was simple, but disappointing. When I read all the good reviews I was impressed, but it turned out to be balsamic in the shape of asparagus.

Great "different" way to do spring asparagus.  I tried it for Easter and even my friend who "hates" basalmic vinagerette liked it!  Definately a keeper!

I was skeptical, but this is great - served cold.  I bought medium-size asparagus and blanched it for 2.5 min.  I then marinated it for about four hours.  It turned out terrific.  I served it with butternut squash and pancetta risotto, so this asparagus provided a nice balance.  Will definitely make again!

My family has never eaten asparagus, but my grandson and I decided to try it. I was looking for a quick recipe to serve with stuffed fish and decided to try this. We both like it, although he said he prefer a hot dish. Based upon our like for this, we're going to try more asparagus dishes.

I choose to grill this and to not drain the liquid, so it was more or less boiled in this.   I wouldn't do that again, I'd direct grill the drained asparagus.   There was plenty of sauce for 3 pounds of asparagus.   I used a onion  vinaigrette.   I definitely will make this again using a different method.

I used Good Seasonings dressing and made by balsamic dressing (which i like because I can control the oil). I used way less then 1 1/2c though. Loved the fresh lemon zest and I also felt that the balsamic reduced as the asparagus roasted. Simple and delicious!

I chose to leave my asparagus whole for a prettier presentation. I certainly feel that the quality of the dressing you choose could change the outcome of this recipe, perhaps next time I'll make my own! The only thing I'd do next time is to cut back on the lemon zest a bit.

Delicious and so easy. Each time I make it, someone requests the recipe.
