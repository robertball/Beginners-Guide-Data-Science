While we did enjoy eating this, we felt that the sauce lacked a bit of flavor. Somehow, even with adding a full can of pineapple and its juice, the overall pineapple flavor was lost. I also felt that the sauce wasn't quite sweet enough. In the future, I would add more pineapple, maybe some brown sugar, and bit more heat to the dish as well. I sprinkled on some seasoned rice wine vinegar just before serving and that helped spruce it up a bit more as well. For the ease of this dish though, I would make it again, but with adjustments.
