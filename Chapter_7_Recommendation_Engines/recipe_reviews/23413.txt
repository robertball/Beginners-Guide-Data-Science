Use cold cubed butter.  I had to add 2 TBL buttermilk. Chop fruits fine or bake 4 layers instead of 2 and splitting them.  The larger chunks of apples and nuts makes it harder to slice the layers in half. VERY GOOD CAKE!

This cake is delicious! I had some dried apples I needed to use up so I used 2 heaping cupfuls and omitted the pecans, coconut, and currants. I melted the butter (didn't know if I was supposed to) and baked the cake in a 9X13 for 30 min. I didn't have any apple butter so I made a glaze with 1/4 cup butter, 2/3 cup white sugar, and 1/3 cup juice from a can of fruit. Cook and stir til dissolved and pour over warm cake. Yummy!

I wanted to make something for a bake sale benefit and strangely enough had the random items to make this.  My only confusion was whether to add the water the cake mix calls for.  It seemed like not enough wet ingredients, so I added the water.  Seemed to turn out ok.  Made 24 cupcakes plus some extra.  Used a spare can of cream cheese frosting mixed with some marshmallow creme.

Every time I try using a cake mix, I wind up being disappointed. I hope I've finally learned my lesson.
