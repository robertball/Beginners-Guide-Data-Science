As backpack would say, YUM YUM YUM DELICIOSO!

Subbed chopped pecans for the hazelnuts and used baby spinach. Perfect!

Awesome!  Oddly enough, I hate mangoes.  I substituted mandarin oranges.  This was a major hit at a party I attended this past week-end.  You can't go wrong with this wonderful berry salad.

I love this salad!!  Really delicious, especially for mango lovers like myself.  The flavors come together so well, makes me think of something that could be served at a high-end beach resort.  I ate this over fresh spinach since that's what I had for greens.  I think the mango raspberry dressing would be great over a veggie salad as well.

I have made this salad for BBQ's and parties, it is always a hit! I add some whole raspberries to the dressing in a clear jar so it looks as amazing as it tastes.

Delicious. Perfect for summer. I made my own raspberry vinaigrette and added the mango to it in the food processor. Yummmm. I was fresh out of hazelnuts, so I used pine nuts I had on hand.

This salad revieced rave reivews for Easter!  I did make a few changes, 50/50 blend of spinach & spring greens, added mango chunks directly to the mix, and used pistachios and added a little bacon, no cheese.  Served with Paula Deen's poppyseed dressing.  My berries were just gorgeous and the beautiful colors in this win over the crowd every time.  Thanks for sharing a versitile recipe with us.

Fresh and very tasty! I took this salad to a potluck recently and had so many requests for the recipe. I've saved it to my favorites and will definitely make it again.

Deliciously fresh!  My twentyish kids and husband all loved it!  I substituted toasted pecans for the hazelnuts and green onion for the red onion - yummy!  Will definately be serving this again for friends and family!
