This was really good but I gave it 4 stars because I added a little bit and think it would have been too dry and maybe a little bland without me fiddling with the recipe. On the crust I brushed a mixture of olive oil, crushed garlic, a little extra fresh basil, salt and black pepper before layering on the Prosciutto, cheese and more basil. I like how this recipe calls for the avocado to be put on after the pizza has cooked, it's a really nice temperature combination with the hot pizza and cool avocado. The red pepper flakes were a very nice touch as well.

Didn't have prosciutto so used pepperoni. Also, used the first reviews advice and made a oil base of olive oil, crushed garlic, basil, salt, and pepper. This turned out beautifully. Very nice and fresh flavor.
