Not bad, but with the suggested "tweaks" I like it much better. I personally don't like to work with pyllo, so I use Pepperidge Farms puff pastry shells. Very easy to bake. Next, reduce the cream to a half pint or so. You sure don't need a quart! I found the snails somewhat bland, so when I'm draining them before sauteing them, I liberally sprinkly them with cracked black pepper, kosher salt and dill weed which gives them a very unique taste. I add all of the cream sauce to the pan and bring it to a boil. I pile about 6 snails in and around the smaller baked puff pastry shell and pour sauce over the top.

I made a double recipe at a New Year's party and everyone loved it! I did cut back on the cream and used half of the amount listed as well as half of the egg yolks. Even so I had a little extra sauce. I love how easy these are (but you still get a big wow factor).

Jamie, I have never made escargots before until I came across your recipe.  I don't know what kind of experience others have had with it, but I have to say that mine came out great.  Everyone in my home loved them, even those who are not to fond of eating snails.  Thanks a bunch, Michi in Miami

I found it a bit bland.
