Great base recipe - used a can of coconut milk instead - is the same as using coconut cream & hot water.  Poured the coconut milk in with the onions & garlic and added 1/2 tsp of lemon juice, chilli powder, ground ginger, salt and pepper before adding the chicken.  Without that, I found the sauce to be a little bland.  But I definitely enjoyed those spices on the chicken.

I had a tin of coconut milk and tried this recipe. I am allergic to bell peppers and did not want a curry recipe. This chicken was so delicious that is my all time favourite now. My husband was so impressed, he told everybody about the chicken. I did not add the cup of hot water, just simmer the chicken in the coconut milk. Next time I am going to add some mushrooms and bake it in the oven.

I have been looking for this recipe.  I left out the onions as my favorite dish at the Chinese resturant does not have them.  I put walnut halves in this.  Wonderful!

After reading the most "helpful" review I couldn't help but make this dish. The erroneous information they gave certainly would result in a very bland product as they reviewed it.  As the "most helpful" reviewer said....Coconut milk and cream of coconut are the same. Sorry...NOT even close. Two entirely different products.  That being said, I made it exactly as directed initially only adjusting the seasoning a bit before I served by adding about a half teaspoon of chili garlic sauce  and another tablespoon of lemon juice. Next time, I will skip the water and use chicken broth instead to add more depth and I will add some red curry paste too. I would also add some fresh ginger. I served this with fried broken rice and chopped peanuts and cilantro for garnish. Very tasty indeed. (though a bit heavy on the calories) For the adjustments, I give this 4 stars. My husband and a dinner guest gave it 5 stars as served. Thanks so much for sharing a terrific recipe. This is a winner!

Great base for a recipe, but it needs more vegetables!  I diced 2 chicken breasts and took the advice of another reviewer and used coconut milk instead of cream of coconut.  I also added mushrooms and diced red pepper.  So good, my roommate said it tasted like something she would get at her favorite Thai restaurant back home!

This was very tasty. The onions overpowered a little bit though. I wouldn't use as much onion next time.

This recipe is a great starting point!  I used a can of coconut milk instead of coconut cream because that is what I had in the house. I used 1 TBSP of minced garlic instead of the ginger (personal taste) and I cubed up the chicken breast so they would cook faster.  Once everything was cooked up I threw in some frozen peas, beans, and carrots for a one pot meal!  Serve it over some jasmine rice and it is a quick, easy and great tasting meal!

This is way to sweet.  Half the cream of coconut should be more than enough-I had to add a lot more of everything to be able to eat this.  It was still to sweet.  You can always add more if you like it sweeter.  This needs some work to make the flavor more complex.

This isn't a meal you will come home & throw together & it is not the most calorie concious you can find but my goodness it is good! Really a home cooked meal that was a treat!

Loved this recipe. I was looking for a creamy sauce I could serve my son. He cannot have dairy. This was perfect. I had the ingredient on hand so didn't have to run out for anything. I did add a bit of chipotle powder but just a bit as I didn't want to make it to spice for my toddler. I think that was all I changed. We used the meat and sauce to make a chicken wrap. We filled the wrap with sweet peppers, cucumbers, lettuce, tomatoes, and avocados. My kids were both asking for more.

I followed this recipe exactly on every count. The sauce never thickened and the onions cooked into nothing by the time the chicken was cooked through. It was too sweet for me and lacking in spice flavor. I would have to alter this to make a thicker sauce and add more of the spices for my taste. Not sure if I will make this again.

This is way too much water for the can of cream of coconut.  Sauce was also bland so added fish sauce, fresh grated ginger and anything oriental/thai I had.  3 tbs. peanut butter did help to thicken it a bit, but I was really hoping for a thicker sauce.  Needs a lot of embellishment to be good, but it was once I added the extra ingredients..

The technique (preparation) is spot on. Browning the chicken, removing and then cooking the onions/garlic before adding the now spiced chicken back in along with the coconut cream/water was spot on! But the flavor is a bit off. Too much water for the amount of coconut cream. Made as written, it turned out a bit watery and not enough flavor. Added two teaspoons of coconut extract and two teaspoons of coconut sugar to balance out the flavors. Next time, will use about 1/2 the water but still plan to add some coconut extract and sugar!

We all liked this. The sauce did not thicken at all though. We just served it over rice.

This was really tasty, but definitely too sweet made as is. I will make with half coconut cream/half coconut milk next time. I did add one large green pepper, 1 TBS of fresh ginger, 4 garlic cloves and the juice of one whole lemon. Also floured, salt and peppered, pan fried the chicken until brown but pink. After removing the chicken from pan (sprinkled with 1/2 lemon juice), added the ginger/garlic/pepper/onion and cooked for few min. Then added liquid, then chicken breasts  simmered uncovered for 30+- minutes, liquid reduced and browned and chicken was very tender. Added more lemon juice and served with Sambal Oelek - for more spice.
