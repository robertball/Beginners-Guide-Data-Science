Delicious. I never thought about putting basil on a burger. A little balsamic glaze or vinegar mixed with the tomato and basil would be good too. (Next time) The weather was not cooperating so I had to do these indoors in a cast iron skillet. Here is a tip: When forming the patties put a small indent in the center with your knuckle so the burger cooks through without shrinking. Thanks for a new take on burgers!

A great marriage of flavors with the basil and tomato topping. So easy to make.
