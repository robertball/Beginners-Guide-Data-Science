So as I said I'm going to let you know how this turned out! I did a whole lot of tweaking on this recipe! I started by simply following the directions but after doing all the chopping,dicing,cutting etc, this whole dish took on a different life of its own! I said screw it and made this into a main meal! After rummaging around in my chest freezer I took out two bags of skinless, boneless chicken breasts. I had 5 breast halves so after thawing I diced them all and saut√©ed the meat is butter and added 1 medium onion. I also added a cajun seasoning to give the chicken some pop. While the meat was simmering I 'hotrodded' the base of this 'salad'. Mayo,sour cream and one cup of Ranch mixed together and mixed into the elbow macaroni. I decided that as long as I'm now making this into a main dish I added three quarter bag of grated sharp cheddar cheese. After the chicken was cooked down, into the mix it went! I've got to say it turned out great!

Mixed mayo and ranch dressing, did not have Miracle Whip. We like grated cheddar in our mac salad so added that. This mac salad came out very good, will make for the next pot-luck at husbands work.

5 stars for coming out the way I believe it was intended too. The taste was sort of bland. More herbs/spices needed or just more salt. This made much more than the 8 servings it says. 6 large tomatoes is a ton of toms.

It is very bland. I had to add things to it to make it taste like anything. Added green onions, celery, bread and butter pickles, and a small amount of sugar and vinegar to my salad which made it a lot better. A bit of grated cheese and chunked ham would also make it better. I did like the fact that it had tomatoes in the recipe. I used our garden tomatoes in the dish which is why I gave the recipe 3 stars and not 2.

TOMATOES IN MACARONI SALAD ARE SOOOOOO GOOD!!!!  I use ALL Miracle Whip Light plus 1/3 cup vinegar and 1/3 cup sugar, to liven the taste.  Also, if you add some VERY finely diced sweet onion, it adds a little extra flavor, but little kids won't even know it's in there, as the pieces dissolve.  IMPORTANT... GREAT salad to make a day ahead, just add some milk to give it extra moisture before serving (if needed.)  The macaroni absorbs the dressing!
