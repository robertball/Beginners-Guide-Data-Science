This is the recipe I've been using for thirty two years.  The only exception I make is that I will usually use vegetable oil instead of roast drippings: I spray pan with vegetable spray and put 1/2 tsp oil in each cup.
An absolute must to have the oven pre-heated to the right temp before putting the puddings in the oven. I always remove the roast from the oven to set/carve while puddings bake on their own.

I have use this same recipe for years. I make it with a 1/2 teaspoon of Criso shortning in each muffin pan hole  (makes 9). I also make this in the blender until its light and fluffy. They are more crispy in the muffin tins. If you want 12 then use in high powered blender:

1.5 cups flour
3 eggs
1.5 cups milk
1 tsp salt

Left overs can be reheated in the oven for a few minutes the next day, that is if there are any left :-)

This is the same recipe I've used for years.  just a couple of tips -- spray the muffin tins with Pam, and DON'T open the oven.

I love this recipe!  I make it to specs, except that I use Crisco instead of beef fat.  As a vegetarian, I ate Yorkshire pudding growing up and wasn't willing to let it go.  Just preheat the pan (with the Crisco in it) for about 5 minutes before pouring the batter in.  It always rises well and comes out puffy and crispy.

I see no mention of putting the drippings/oil in the oven to get them very hot before putting the batter in whichever tin you're using.. which should always be done.  Also, I cook my roast to completion, remove & tent it with foil, heat my yorkshire tin, then carve the roast while pudding is baking so that I can serve everything right away when the pudding comes out of the oven.

Good. For a pancake called Dutch pancakes, use butter, but same batter. When done, serve right away because it collapses. Sprinkle cinnamon, or powdered sugar on it and lemon juice. Or go with syrup. Serve for breakfast. My family loves them. They also like the Yorkshire Pudding with the roast.

I made this recipe today with my Easter standing rib roast. While the roast was resting, I poured the batter in the cast iron skillet the roast had been in.  I cut the cooking time down by about 10 minutes as the skillet gets sizzling hot and retains heat.  The outside of the pudding was crispy, and the parts that rose up the sides of the skillet and puffed out were airy.  It's too bad this can only be a once a year thing, I can feel my arteries clogging as I type this. But it was delicious.

These were good but I needed to turn the heat down a wee bit as these burned a little.  I like the pan instead of the muffin.

this game out great.  I  used the tips from other reviewers.  I coated the glass dish with crisco lightly, then I put the dish in the oven for a few minutes while I beat the batter.  then pour the batter into the heated dish.  450 for 10 minutes, then 350 for 25 minutes.  Also the batter needs to be room temp.   Make the batter an hour before you plan to cook it.   I made the recipe 4 times in a row to perfect it because my family loves this.  They kept eating them.  the taste was the same but if the dish is not heated and the batter is not room temp or at least warmer than the refrig, then the pudding does not get all puffy.  we like it puffy.  if you use muffin tins it comes out crispy and may not be puffy.

WOW!!! Amazing results - thank you so much for this recipe, I couldn't believe the size of them when I opened the oven!  I, like some of the others, made individual ones and also used vegetable oil instead of drippings.  :)

These were just ok. Nothing special but not awful. I currently live in England, and I was looking for a homemade Yorkshire Pudding recipe that tasted like the ones you find in shops here. This was not the right recipe for me. Thanks for sharing it though.

I didn't have enough drippings from my meat, so I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 coconut oil to make up the difference.  Then I saw how much grease was in my skillet and dumped out 1/2 of it to be used in gravy.  My whole family loved it!  I pre-heated my cast iron skillet with the oil before I poured in the batter, and had to cut the bake time by 10 minuted.

It as very tasty! Soft on the inside, crunchy on the outside. I used the crisco/muffin tin method used by another reviewer because I am a vegetarian too. Reminded me of tiny German/Puffy pancakes.  I served then with bananas foster.

I set the oven to broil to heat it up quickly, and accidentally forgot to reset it to 425. I AM DUMB. They actually turned out pretty good though.

We had never had Yorkshire Pudding before, but I wanted something traditional to go with our Christmas prime rib.  This came out wonderful and everyone loved it - no leftovers!  I had beef au jus and people dipped their pudding into the juice.  Someone had told me that the pan being hot when the batter is poured in is key - so I made sure of that.  It was neat how it puffed up so much during baking, then fell.  Even the guests who had ham instead of beef ate this.

I had never made these before when I tried this recipe and they turned out great! I don't use the drippings though. I put a half inch of oil in a muffin tin and heat it in the oven then pour the batter in and cook. They cook faster this way and are still really tasty!

You have to pour a little vegetable oil and some butter in pan and heat that up in oven until it is "popping" then remove pan and pour in the batter then bake until it is golden brown and risen. This is the proper way to make Yorkshire pudding ! I made this in the big muffin tins where I poured a little vegetable oil and a small pat of butter heated up the pans until they were "popping" removed and poured in the batter then baked. I made these the day before and then reheated them for about 10 min in oven at 350.

I needed more batter because I wanted to prepare this in a 11x17 pan so I went with another reviewer's recipe (1.5 cups flour, 1.5 cups liquid, 1 tsp salt, 3 eggs).  I ran out of milk so I used .5 cup of milk and 1 cup of water.  The pudding came out chewy/bready with lots of crispy edges rather than eggy, delicious!

This is my go-to recipe. I use it to make individual portions in a muffin tin, and a doubled amount fills a 12 cup tin (with a little bit leftover) a single amount makes about 7 individual servings. I cook at the same temp but watch for it to be finished... roughly 15-20 minutes

I've made this recipe for years, and my mother before me.  The only difference was that mom kept the eggs in a bowl on the counter all day, and beat them periodically throughout the day.  Her pudding was always light, fluffy and tasted better than any I've ever had, even in England.  She never used muffin tins, and always heated the oil in the oven before pouring in the batter.

I made it in a pan with bacon fat instead of pan drippings,  I didn't heat the pan and oil long enough as they didn't puff up, it was a bit heavy but still tasted good. I will try again and come back and review.

did I miss something?  Did not rise at all, hard as a rock, was I supposed to stir it all together, not noted in recipe.

yummy- Will definitely make it again. Only thing I changed was that I made it in individual pans

We tried this recipe as part of our Christmas dinner. Included was rib roast. We used the juices with the pudding. Followed the recipe to the letter and it was awesome!  This is now part of our Christmas dinner staples. .

I used to make this a lot, but never memorized it.  Through many life changes, I managed to loose my recipe.  This an awesome duplicate.  I don't make individual's, I use a pan.  Also, I melt butter in my pan (in the oven) instead of using the drippings.  When finished I spoon apricot jam on top!  Great with chicken and rice and a nice salad.  Thanks!

A real hit.  Just like Mom's.  I used muffin pans for this traditional recipe.  Each serving has a little reservoir in the centre to slather with gravy.
