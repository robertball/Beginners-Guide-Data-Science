This recipe was such a huge hit with my friends! the only thing I would modify is instead of pizza dough, use biscuit mix. either way,  this dish is delish!

This recipe was very easy and really delicious. I brought to my in-laws and they enjoyed it very much. I made the recipe exactly as instructed, no substitutions.

Comes out looking like the picture but it takes way longer than what is suggested and does not taste as good as they look

“I am very glad that I made this dish, it was the best dish ever!!” - says my 9yr old.

This is an appetizer that is a starter for any ingredient you want to put in the dough.. garlic Mac to a meat...
