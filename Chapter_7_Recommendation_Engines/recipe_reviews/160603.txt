Not exactly Bond's Vesper. 

The original recipe called for 100 proof Vodka and 94 proof Gin.  Over the last 40 years distillers have, generally, lowered the proofs of their liquor. 

If you really want the taste, and kick, of the original, use Stoly 100 and Tanqueray Gin. 

Then as Matt noted in his review, use Lillet Blanc with a few drops of bitters.

The original recipe called for Kina Lillet which had Quinine in it. Since this is no longer available, use Lillet Blanc with a few drops of Angostura Bitters to simulate the bitter taste of Quinine.

Seems like I'm not the only person obsessive enough to look up a Vesper. Pretty good. But remember, Bond specified GORDAN's gin and he said to shake it.

This is so elegant, once you have gathered all ingredients: Lillet Blanc, Gordon's Vodka, Gordon's Gin, shaken! Lemon twist. Better be sure you are sitting down. Fireplace helps. BTW, you can keep it in the freezer pre-mixed for really tough weeks. Life is good.

I made this for my husband and a similar one from this site for myself that used orange instead of lemon. I actually preferred the one with the orange but hubby liked this just fine. This is POTENT for sure. Knowing it would take awhile to finish the drink I made custom ice cubes with lemon zest frozen inside to keep it chilled yet add flavor as  the cubes melted.
