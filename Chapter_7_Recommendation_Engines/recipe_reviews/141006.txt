My family really enjoys this but we let the jicama set in the lime/lemon juice overnight and put chili powder on it. It makes for a light snack especially on a hot summer day.

These are great!  This snack was first shown to me by my young Mexican friend Vero in the early 90â€™s.  She spoke very limited English but got the idea across just fine.  Cut the Jicama into sticks or chunks then make your own Chile powder.  A chunk of dried out corn tortilla, 6 or 8 dry Chiles de Arbol toasted in a dry skillet, and a pinch of salt.  Snap off the chile stems and grind tortilla, chiles, and salt in a mini blender or spice grinder until a powder.  Put Jicama on a plate, squeeze fresh lime over, and sprinkle on the chile powder.  Really good with a cold Dos Equis or Pacifico!

Yummy. These are not high in carbs, its acceptable during Atkins Induction and on a lot of low carbers food lists.  1 cup = 11.5g of carbs, 6.4g of that is fiber.  4oz has a glycemic load of 2.

Lime juice, salt and powdered chile- be it a mild one like guajillo (GOO-AH-JEE-YOH) or a super hot like piquin (PEE-KEEN)- is a widely popular addition to almost any fruit or veggie all over Mexico. Try it with green or medium ripened mango, cucumber ,pineapple, carrot, even celery and watermelon!  It's addictive !

Made this first for a Bunco group w/white bean monterey jack dip and although most had not had jicama before, they tried and enjoyed it.  It'll never replace tortilla chips, but it was very light, refreshing and EASY.

JPretty good, and nothing could be easier. Not good for a carb watcher or a diabetic. Too many carbs.

I was introduced this as a dieting food when I was in the military.  I needed to loose a few pounds and my friend Rocio showed me this and there really aren't but like 11 g of carbs in a cup I love it.  It was light and the lime made it a bit tangy...I have added a dash of lemon sometimes and find it gives it a kick.  I love the lime chili mix.  I sprinkled taco seasoning on them one day.  I did not expect it to taste all that great, just trying new things.  I loved it....it was awesome.

Lovely! Not high in carbs more like moderate. Since they have 10.3 g of fiber so you would deduct half of that from the amount of carbs which leaves 14.4g of carbs.

These are deeeelicious! We used ground arbol chiles, only half a lime (which seemed to be plenty), and added some chopped cilantro, a pinch of sea salt and a little drizzle of mild olive oil. Definite keeper, and looking forward to having this as a cool, crisp snack in the summer!

I am giving this recipe more stars than it deserves only because the Jicama itself is worthy of high praise. As written, this recipe is WAAAAAY to spicy for human consumption. A *tablespoon* of crushed red pepper for a single Jicama? Yikes!  But the Jicama is an *EZ* to appreciate root veggie. It tastes and feels a whole lot like an apple.  My thought is that it is very healthful to have variety in our diets. You get fantastic health benefits from a carrot that you don't get from a grape. So we should all eat as many different fruits and veggies as we can.  And the Jicama is completely compatible with my US pallete.  So do this recipe but either reduce the amount of pepper to 1/10th, or at least knock it off on the side of the dish before you put it in your poor mouth!

Refreshing best describes this.  The only thing I didn't like is how the crushed red pepper clumped together from the moisture.

A good carb is one high in fiber (this is especially true for diabetics) and there is almost nothing better in the carb world than jicama. Great tasting snack.
