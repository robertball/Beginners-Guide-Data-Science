For the last 35 years I have always used a can of chili mixed with an
 8 oz. pkg of cream cheese heated in the microwave until cheese is melted and easy to stir up. This was what my kids ate when they came home from school and were "starving"!  Tortilla chips and this dip were a staple in our house!

I've been making a chili dip with Hormel chili for years. But I have different cheeses. I have 8 oz of Monterey Jack with jalapenos, and 8 0z of cheddar cheese.In a fondue pot to keep it warm and serve with tortilla chips. People Love it.

This was an awesome recipe. My family has never been a fan of chili and cheese dips (especially not processed cheese ones) but I wanted to give it a try. My husband picked out the Velveeta Jalapeno cheese dip to mix with it. It was delicious! We (4 of us) went through two whole cans of chili (with one full block of the cheese) in a day. The chili had a great flavor and you couldn't tell the cheese was what it was. We'll definitely make it as a side for parties in the future!

As written this was ok- it was a little thick and cheesy for our tastes- it was also a little mild and we like more kick.  I ended up adding a second can of chili (with beans), 2 Tbsp diced jalapeños, and 1/4 C half and half.  Perfection with tortilla chips!  I'm glad I used the chili with beans, we really enjoyed them in this dip.

My family loves this dip! I use Mexican cheese, chili no beans, and 1/2 1b. browned ground beef.

I have made this dip for years switching the chili for spicy chili and made it in my mini crockpot for potlucks at work.  It is an easy no fuss appetizer.  I have (if any left overs) put it on a omelet the next day.  Great Super Bowl snack.

I got this recipe from a co-worker and she uses 1 can turkey chili to one 8oz block cream cheese, chopped green onion and a pkg of cherry tomatoes cut in half. She adds veggies after heating in microwave for couple minutes, serves with Tostitos scoop chips...yummo!!

I've been making this for years...it's always a favorite.  I've made it as the recipe reads, and at other times I added a can of Rotel tomatoes with chile...gives you some heat.  I prefer the original recipe.

I have been making this dip for years.  I like to find Mexican flavored cheese.  It always disappears quickly from party tables!

Pretty darn simple! You can’t really go wrong with this one- it goes quickly & is extremely popular for an easy appetizer. My only issue: it solidifies extremely quick after heating & removing from heat. So, if you have one of the mini slow cookers- keeping it in that is ideal to keep it at the warm, creamy consistency. Otherwise, you’ll need to keep warming it if it sits for more than 30 minutes, having to stir it before it begins to solidify. Served this with some Frito scoops & tortilla chips- perfect combo for taco night, as many opted to “sauce” up their tacos, too!

Simplest dip I've made. Not the absolute best, but darn good and when you're juggling other things for the "Big Game" this is a great way to take some pressure off. Throw a bowl of this and a bag of chips out to buy some time while you tend to the brisket. I've made other dips that might get 5 stars, but this is just TOO easy. About a 3.5 dip with an upgrade for ease.

Nice quick dip. Everyone loved it with chips. But I put it on top of tater tots instead of dipping chips in it :)  Yummers!

Chili and Velveeta cheese- what's not to love about that combo?! This would be great for a party dip while watching sports or for having an easy appetizer for guests!

This Velveeta was so overpowering that it was difficult to tell that there was chili in the recipe. My husband commented the same. So I decided to add another can of the chili and it was much better.  It still seemed to lack something. I may try this again and use one can of chili and one can of Rotel tomatoes. We ate this with tortilla chips and also experimented with garlic bread sticks.
