Made this for Thanksgiving dinner.  Took the advise of some previous reviews and tweaked the recipe a little.  I felt that 10 cups of water was too much for a couple of turkey wings and adjusted to 31/2 cups of water and 3 1/2 cups of canned chicken stock.  I added a little celery salt to taste and ended up with a recipe that I will be using every Thanksgiving.  What I really loved about this recipe is that I made my gravy on Tuesday, put it in a quart jar and put in the refrigerator, all I did on Thanksgiving was heat it up in a saucepan, saved me a lot of time and work during those last minutes of crunch time.  Thanks for a great recipe and great technique.

First word: Wow! We can have gravy in the freezer for everyday cooking all year now! But I must say I was astonished that CJ tells us to throw away veggies - and the meat? Having been raised by parents who grew up in the depression, I couldn't do that of course. So I followed the recipe, but changed the method a bit. First, I sliced the onion in very thin half-slices and a finer slice of carrots and diced celery. My store had 3 large wings per pack, which I thought was perfect. Roasted in cast-iron skillet for the full hour, flipping wings once. Then into my old standard-size crock pot; filled w. water + 1 small can chicken broth, 3 big pinches dried thyme (1 per wing) and 3 large cloves garlic minced fine. Set on low, covered, all night, about 12 hrs. total. Let cool awhile, removed skin, fatty bits and bones, and had a platter of tender meat for an easy start to dinner or to save for post-holiday soup. There was so little fat floating on top that I didn't bother to skim. Just pureed broth/veggies in blender (in 4 batches) and strained. Set aside 1-1/2 c. to replace half the water in my dressing, leaving 4+ c. for gravy. This was already silky from having the fat already incorporated, so for the roux I just used 3T salted butter and 1/3 c. flour. Whisked over heat until it was the same lovely caramel color as the broth and whisked together. Velvet! Planned to add the drippings from the bird for final seasonings, but it doesn't even need it - I could just drink this stuff!!

I have made ths recipe for years. The only difference is that I use 6 or 8 turkey wings because there isn't much fat on a wing, and I use chicken or turkey broth instead of the water. I also add some white wine as part of the liquid. I usually make the gravy about a month ahead of the holidays because it freezes well. When it comes time use it, I put it in a crockpot, thaw it out and heat it up, saving stove space. It's my favorite gravy recipe.

First, I must say that I don't think make-ahead gravy ever tastes as good as making it from the pan drippings, but it's a tremendous time saver for that time-consuming Thanksgiving meal.  Maybe my turkey wings weren't "large" enough, I don't know, but the broth did not have a lot of flavor even though I used a box (quart) of turkey stock as part of the 10 cups of liquid. Something I rarely do when making a recipe is modify it too much first time, but I found it necessary here.  I added some Better Than Bouillon Turkey Base, some poultry seasoning, finely chopped wing meat, and some of the roasted veggies which I'd pureed in the blender.  It all came together well, and I ended up with a flavorful gravy.  I made another recipe last year from this site, but with these modifications, I think this is a better recipe.  I have to wonder if 2 turkey wings is enough to flavor 10 cups of water, and in the future, I will use more wings and some necks if I can get them.  Don't like changing a recipe this much, but after tasting the gravy, it was necessary.  All was good in the end, and this 4-star rating is based on the tweaks I made.

I'm going to rate Chef John's recipe because it is virtually what I have done every year for many years other than also roast the neck with all the veggies too before simmering them for hours.  I agree that two wings would not seem to add enough flavor.  I save about 2 cups of my turkey stock for basting my turkey in the oven on the big day and make my gravy a bit thicker so I can pour some the pan drippings into it and into my dressing before placing that dish in the oven. No one would guess my dressing is not cooked in the bird!  I don't mind a bit having my gravy done ahead of time, either.  Great time saver when you really need it in the last hour trying to get this 'labor of love' meal on the table!!

This gravy is amazing.  A little time consuming but worth having that extra gravy on Thanksgiving.  I ended up with 7 cups of gravy at the end because I used 14 cups of water at the broth-making stage.  That's how much it took to completely cover the wings and veg.  That's the only change I made.  Definitely a keeper!

I just finished making this.  Last year I decided to try a new gravy recipe on Thanksgiving and for the first time ever, I had to toss everything and depend on jarred gravy.  Not fun and most embarrassing!!  Well, it took a few hours, but no rush since Thanksgiving is a couple weeks away.  The only thing I changed was used 4 carrots and 4 celery stalks and used 8 cups of chicken stock and 2 cups of water per other reviewers.  After simmering for the 3 hours, I only ended up with 4 cups of stock, not 6.  I just added 2 more cups of water with 2 tsps. of chicken bouillon.  It came out smooth as silk and my husband's eyes actually sparkled when he tasted it. He was very impressed and I think it beat every gravy we've made for 31 years of marriage.  Hubby said it probably won't last until Thanksgiving.  I plan on freezing it and thawing that day to save the craziness trying to make gravy with the entire family watching and waiting for dinner to be ready.  I highly recommend trying this!!

I've been doing this for several years but it's not the only gravy for the meal; it's a supplement to the gravy I make when the turkey comes out of the oven. We love hot turkey sandwiches here so need gravy to go a long way. If you're going to use this as your only gravy, you have to either up the turkey wings to four, or cut back on the cold water to about 6 cups in order to achieve a full-flavoured gravy.  Downside to reducing the water is that you will end up with much less gravy.  And, to the person who commented about frozen gravy being separated upon thawing, simply add a couple of tablespoons of water, heat, and whisk it well to recombine.

Hey, Chef John! Thanks! Made this for Thanksgiving & was so pleased. Followed the recipe exactly & liked it BUT then cheated by adding more flour and butter (might sub some corn starch next time). I wanted a thicker 'gravy base' in order for the gravy to be 'just right' when ALL the pan juices were added at dinner time! Made it thicker than I meant to, but the results are worth repeating. Why? I placed just some of the 'gravy base' from this recipe into a medium sized, lined slow cooker a couple hours before dinner. When the turkey came out of the oven & was removed from the pan, the pan juices went into the slow cooker w/the 'gravy base.' After whisking the gravy mixture, it was just the perfect amount of thickness for my taste! If it hadn't been, I'd have had a touch of easy juggling to do: add more 'gravy base' if it was too thin, or add some chicken stock if it was too thick. Easy fixes! Added touch of balsamic & garlic. Later crocked the turkey bones; pulled the bones out in the morning; ran out of time & crocked the broth a whole day more. The next morning after that, added onions, parsnips, carrots - especially carrots O Best Beloved, etc. In the evening, I added the rest of the 'gravy base', whisked it, stirred in some frozen peas   & heated it through. Finally added a bit of turkey to the pot just before serving (just enough time to warm it through so it wouldn't dry out). Best turkey soup I've ever had. That after making the easiest turkey-day gravy ever! Thanks!

This recipe is fabulous! I just made this in advance so I won't have to mess with making gravy on Thanksgiving day. It's going in the freezer and I'll take it out a day in advance to thaw. I will reheat it in a crock pot to save precious burner space. ;) After boiling for 4 hours (don't skip on time), and staining, I put the liquid in a big glass bowl in the fridge over night. Next day, skimmed all fat off the top (reserving 2 Tbs) made the gravy. Is cooling now to go into a BIG container foe the freezer. Can't wait to enjoy this gravy!

This recipe was very good and the instructional video was really helpful for those of us who are visual learners.  I used two turkey legs instead of wings.  Added some sage and rosemary along with the thyme.  The finished product was a little too runny for my liking, so I removed a bit of the gravy and added some of the cooked carrots (not too many as you don't want orange gravy) onion and celery and about another tablespoon or so of flour.  I used my smart stick hand blender and blended it all up and then put it back in the pot. I finely chopped a bit of the turkey leg meat and threw it in. Another shake or two of salt and it is delish and just the consistancy I like!  I agree with jeniferken, it is time consuming but worth it!  Update 11/13- I'm making again this year.  Using three turkey legs and double the water to make the stock.  I'm planning on putting it in the fridge overnight and making the gravy in the morning. I'll use the amount of stock the recipe calls for and put the rest in the freezer for later. Since you are making turkey stock in all but the last step (in which you are actually making the gravy) it's a natural stopping place if you are in a time crunch.  If you use turkey legs you will NOT need to add other stock to get a good flavor.  It will be pure turkey stock/gravy bliss!

This gravy was amazing!  It does take some time, but it is well worth it.  I followed the recipe to the tee other than adding some fresh rosemary and thyme at the end.  One thing to keep in mind is to make sure you cook the flour long enough...I didn't do it the first time and it was wrecked, however I trust Chef John as I have tried many of his recipes and decided to give it another shot.  We deep fry our turkey and this is the perfect gravy for us as we don't have the standard drippings.  Me and my family all found the gravy to be the best turkey gravy we've had.

Absolutely Awesome, worthy of 10 stars. This was time consuming but I made the day before Thanksgiving to free up the last minute crazies.  I used 4 1/2 cups of water and 3 1/2 cups of turkey stock (large box), totaling 8 cups of pre-recipe liquid and it yielded approx. 4 cups of finished gravy. I was concerned that 10 cups of plain water may leave an unflavorful gravy, glad I adjusted.

Simply amazing! 
I had a 23 lb turkey with huge wings and figured why not try this since we discard the wings anyway. Well, it was the best gravy we ever had! 
I followed the recipe almost to the letter. The wings were quite large and yielded plenty of fat (5 Tbs) and stock. So much that I used only 2 tbs of butter.
The 10 cups of water was perfect…it reduced itself to 6 cups after simmering for the 3 hours just as the recipe said it would.
Seeing the assembly process on video was a huge help for us novice gravy makers. Added the flour to the fat and whisked like in the video and wala…it started to look just like Chef Johns! Slowly added the stock and watched the miracle of grave forming right before my very eyes! Thickened it up a bit with a little more simmering, added some salt and pepper, popped in the fridge…DONE!
Had to email this link to everyone at the dinner.
Can’t thank you enough for this first gravy success I ever had.

I had a rotisserie chicken and threw the carcass and leftovers in  a pot and made stock. I continued with this recipe and made the most wonderful tasting gravy. Everyone raved about it. I will definitely be making this again. Thanks Chef John.

I was excited to do a make-ahead gravy for Thanksgiving, but this ended up being a lot of trouble.  I lost so much volume while simmering that I ended up going to the store to buy turkey stock.  As other reviewers suggested, two turkey wings didn't seem to be enough for a decent stock.

I made this recipe last Christmas for the first time.  It turned out great and it's my go-to gravy from here on out.  I couldn't find turkey wings so I used two turkey legs.  One other change is that I only used 3-1/2 cups of water and 3-1/2 cups of turkey stock.  Thanks for the recipe.  11/2016 Update - I've made this twice a year since 2014.  I didn't think it could get better, but it did!  This is my best batch yet.  I used 2 turkey legs & 1 turkey thigh.  I used 4 cups (1 box) of chicken/turkey stock and 4 cups water.  OMG...to die for!  It is so worth the extra time a few weeks early.  Thanks Chef John!

I am the queen of gravy in my house and always am frantically stirring over the hot pan once the roast has come out of the oven.  This recipe is a little time-consuming, but definitely worth the trouble given you get to make it ahead of time.  It is truly smooth and velvety.  My only modifications to the recipe were to up the quantity of turkey fat a little, to be used in the roux, and then season it very simply with salt and pepper, as is our family's taste.  Excellent recipe!

I make a lot of mashed potatoes and never seem to have gravy to accompany them. Not any more! I make this and freeze it in 1.5 c freezer bags, then when I make mashed potatoes for dinner during the week, I take out a bag the night before and viola, done and done. If I use boil-in-bags, I don't bother thawing, just toss it in the potato pot while they're boiling, it thaws as the potatoes cook! This gravy IS amazing!

I haven't exactly done it this way (I think the idea of buying extra turkey wings and roasting them is a bit silly), but I have always taken the neck and giblets and made broth with onion and carrots, then made my gravy with the roux and broth as he describes, then poured in some of the pan drippings (avoiding the fat) after the bird comes out of the oven.  I'm sure this gravy tastes good as he makes it (although personally I would leave out the thyme and garlic), but you can abbreviate the process, use the parts most people simply throw out, and not use up precious oven time and space.

This recipe was a hit with both me and my guests! I loved the fact I could make it a couple of days ahead of time and save the space on the stove. Like others said it is a little time consuming but having it done and out of the way was worth it. I made it exactly as written except in place of the cayenne pepper I used 1/4 tsp bhut jolokia powder which gave the gravy an unusually nice spicy taste. I ended up with a qt of gravy. Thanks Chef John I will be using this recipe again in the future!

So... I made this gravy one day prior to Thanksgiving day... as written.  The only change I made was to double the recipe.  I used five turkey wings  (three came in one package; two in the other).  I did let it simmer for four hours, rather than three, because of the extra ingredients required to double the recipe.  On Thanksgiving morning, I put it - cold from the fridge - into a crockpot on low and let it get happy for about five or six hours.  Just before dinner, I took some cooked and sliced giblets (plus some extra turkey gizzards I had picked up, cooked, and finely chopped) and added it to three cups of the gravy and put in on the stovetop.  Those who didn't care for the giblet gravy helped themselves straight out of the crockpot; those who wanted giblet gravy had theirs from the gravy boat on the table.  Let me just say that both "versions" were spectacular!  After the "big" dinner, with plenty of guests, it was unanimous... everyone agreed it was the best gravy ever!  Getting "The absolute best gravy I've ever had, honey!" from my wife made it all worthwhile.  I WILL make this again for holiday dinners... many times!  It's completely worth the time, if well-planned ahead.  Thanks yet again, Chef John; you're consistently helpful, inspirational, and you make me better than competent in the kitchen!

I don't think the gravy can be ready in 2 1/4 hours since it asks you to cook the wings (I used 2 turkey legs) for 3 hours. Instead of discarding the vegetables I pureed them and added them to the broth. I also added a bit of Better than Bouillon turkey base. Very tasty gravy. Didn't add any salt - I'll let diners add their own. So nice to get this done before Thanksgiving. Just read lutzflcat's review and she did some of the things I did also. I didn't add 10 cups of water, maybe 8.

First of all, this recipe's listed timings are WAY off: It says oven-cook the veggies and wings for 45-60 minutes, then cook the main mixture 'until the meat falls off the bones -- about 3 hours'. That hardly works out to 'ready in 2 1/4 hours'!
Second: The recipe is wasteful -- insofar as it says 'discard all the solids' from the main cooking. Two issues here: The fattier matter is excellent food for dogs -- yours or a neighbor's. The rest -- the vegetable matter and a large share of the meat -- can be saved and combined with boiled rice (and some jalapeno or sereno pepper) for an excellent, easy-to-prepare single-dish supper.
'Hate to say it, Chef John, but this is a gravy for wimps! Its so-mild flavor is a mere hint of what, with a little more effort, it can be.
After the first straining, add back as much meat as can easily be retrieved from the 'discard' bowl. And, after using a cleaver to break off the marrow-rich bones' ends, add back both bones and ends. And add in the rest of the liquid beyond the six cups already used. You may even want to gently whisk in a bit more flour while you are reducing this enhanced mixture to your desired thickness. (Keep in mind it will thicken more as it cools.) Strain again -- saving the meat for the dogs, or to be recombined w/ the veggies,and discard the bones.
What you end up with is a MUCH more flavorful gravy.
BTW, Don't skimp on garlic: Two cloves seldom get ANY job done. I used eight in this recipe. Dried thyme's OK, too.

Used the basic recipe except the garlic and the cayenne pepper - in defference to my wife's taste. I also made the recipe process a bit more complicated.

First, I used 2 wings (fresh) and 2 legs (smoked).

Second, I seasoned the mirepoix with salt and pepper.

Third, I used a bottle of dry, white wine (one that I would gladly drink), along with enough water to cover.

Fourth, I did not skim while cooking the broth. After removing the solids and straining the broth, I refrigerated it overnight. I removed the solids from the top of the gelatin, then gently warmed the removed solids - oils always rise to the top. That is how I recovered the 2 tbs. of turkey fat.

Fifth, I heated the gelatinized broth to a boil, added fresh thyme, rosemary, and sage to the boil. I removed  the broth from the heat, covered it with a lid, and let the herbs steep for 30 minutes.

I then followed the directions for the roux, using XXX flour, 3 tbs. of butter and 2 tbs. of the reserved fat. I did not season the roux.

I used two senses to determine that the roux was ready for liquid. Smell to make sure the roux smelled like pie pastry and sight to allow the rough to turn golden in color.

I then stirred in the broth and brought the mixture to a boil to thicken the gravy. At this point I taste tested and added a few pinches of sea salt and some freshly ground pepper to taste.

The end result: The best tasting turkey gravy I have ever cooked and have ever tasted. Thank you, John for the basic recipe.

I love this gravy, and so does my family. I have made it the last two Thanksgivings and LOVE having this important element of the meal done ahead of time.  I can give it the attention it deserves well in advance of the last minute frantic race to the table, and I know ahead of time the gravy will be 'just right'. Thank you Chef John for the recipe, and for making my Thanksgiving easier to manage.

"Make ahead gravy" made me nervous, but I will turn to this recipe year after year now!   Plus, knowing I had enough for a crowd AND leftovers and I didn't have the stress of making ALL the gravy the day of were all pure bonuses.  I did use more wings than the recipe called for, which further deepened the flavor.  And on the day of, I made a small batch of fresh gravy with drippings and whisked it in.  Delicious and recommended!

The gravy was amazing. Our gravy is great each year, but it is so hectic that last 15 minutes before serving. We plan to do our turkey on are XL Green Egg smoker again this year and now I have my gravy set aside in the freezer. 
I used 4 turkey wings and 2 turkey thighs. I doubled the onion, celery and carrots. I added enough water to cover the meat. I also doubled the roux. I had less than a tablespoon of turkey fat, so I just added a little more butter and a bit of oil. 
Thanks so much! Gravy is so important and having it all done ahead of time is a huge relief.

Everyone loved this when I served it up yesterday with Thanksgiving dinner. I made it the day before, buy only used half the recommended liquid, ending up with a thick pudding-like consistency. When the turkey was done, I pulled out my "gravy pudding" and whisked it with the juices from the turkey - about five cups of it, and then brought it to a simmer. Everyone at dinner commented on the great flavor.

I made this gravy today, in preparation for next week's Thanksgiving dinner.  I must say, it really IS the best gravy I've ever made! I followed the recipe exactly, but did thicken the gravy just a bit more with some corn starch. I will freeze it and reheat in my crock pot on Thanksgiving - thanks for sharing this easy, time-saving recipe!

This was so good!  I've been making turkey stock ahead for many years now but the method in this recipe makes it better.  Roasting the wings on top of the vegetables so that everything caramelizes made a rich brown stock that made it so much more flavorful.  I followed the recipe exactly and found that the two wings were enough for a hearty meaty flavor.   I used my 12 inch cast iron skillet so was able to easily extract the fond without balancing a roasting pan over my small cooktop. The 10 cups of water reduced to 6 cups, just as you stated it would.  I will definitely use this method from now on.   In fact, I plan to roast my turkey carcass for stock using this same method.  Thanks, Chef John!

We always deep fry our turkey, so pan drippings to make gravy I never have.  I have had this recipe 5 years running now an it's the best time savings and tastes better than normal gravy. I use wings and drum sticks to make this amazing gravy!

So disappointed. I've never used flour before to thicken gravy, always cornstarch and I think the flour is what ruined it for me. Had to doctor it A LOT. Had no taste.

This recipe provided a delicious solution to dinner timing.  By making it a few days in advance of Thanksgiving there was enough time for testing variations.  Some of the variations were created by reducing some of the stock to intensify the flavor of the gravy, add sauteed mushrooms to a portion of the gravy, seasoning additions, etc.
I will gladly use this recipe for future holiday gatherings. 
Thanks, Chef John.  This one's a gem.

I use a turkey back, necks and a turkey thigh instead of the wings.  They are all low priced and they work well for this.  I also use 2 quarts of good quality chicken broth and a cup or two of spring water for my broth.  I have been making this now for several years-it's a hit!

Really good recipe.  I followed the recipe with 3 changes.  1)I took recommendations from others and put in 5 cups or so of chicken broth and 5 cups of water.  2) I also pureed in vitamix 1 cup of cooked onion, celery, turkey meat mixture.   3) I also added a cup of good red wine.  Yum.  Saves precious time when turkey comes out.  Highly recommended.

It was twice as much work.  Yes it was done ahead of time but everything else was well planned and I had time to make gravy with my turkey juices.  I don't think I would do this again.  Gravy was ok but the turkey wings I found were not as good as the actual turkey.

We smoked our turkey and wanted the side dishes prepared in advance to have less clutter on Thanksgiving. This recipe was perfect! Will keep it on our menu for future holidays!

followed other poster's advice, and used 4 wings..also added a package of trader Joe's savory turkey broth concentrate, after deciding there was not enough turkey flavor when it was done...other than that, followed the rest of the directions....everyone loved it, and said it complimented everything on the Thanksgiving dinner menu...I strongly advise using 4 wings, then tasting for depth of flavor...as is, 4 stars..after adjustments, 5

This is good, but for what it cost to make it's not good enough to make me want to fix it. You have the cost of the vegtables, turkey wings etc. then you have all the time boiling it. If I had the ingredients on hand and time to kill, then I might would make it again.

This is a good basic recipe. I did use broth instead of water.  The gravy was a little thin, and I had added extra flour since I had extra turkey fat and wanted lots of gravy.  I put it in a crock pot to stay warm and knew it would get even thinner, but the flavor was good. I thickened it with a little cornstarch and water, and also put in some bouillon.  Sure beats making gravy last minute!  I would make this again.

Made this gravy yesterday, finishing today, and I agree with majority.  Did not quite have the taste of "the real thing".  I agree, next time I will add broth instead of water, and maybe use chicken legs versus wings.  Two wings did not add enough flavor.  Also I ended up with about 3 cups broth.  I will freeze and add to it.  However it did come out smooth and velvety.

This gravy was sooo good! It made Thanksgiving dinner so much easier to serve knowing that I didn't have to make a gravy at the last minute. All of my friends and family loved it and were really impressed that I made it from scratch! Thank you for this recipe!

My first time making gravy, turned out great! A little time consuming but well worth it. I was soooo glad I wasn't running around trying to make gravy when the turkey was done. I was able to focus on heating the rest of the meal to serve. I would recommend.

This is the 3rd year I've made this.  I followed recipe EXACTLY.  If you don't please do not review.  You aren't reviewing the recipe, you are reviewing YOUR version. This version is great by itself.  I've tweaked it the last couple of years, but be careful, too many herbs changes it and not for the better.  First time, make it exactly as the recipe states, then go from there.  I partially cover the pot and simmer gently and don't lose much volume, I wind up with about 7 cups of stock.

Hands down the best gravy I've ever made or had. I doubled the amount of wings and threw in the neck.  Being able to prep much of the Thanksgiving meal in advance makes the day of so much more relaxed and enjoyable.

Delicious! I've done this for the past 2 years now. I did use 4 wings and 8 cups of water. ( I can always add more water but I can't take it out after the fact)  On the big day I always add my turkey drippings to the gravy at the end to have the flavors match. Like another person wrote I could drink this stuff. Family loved it too. Saved some in freezer for a turkey pot pie.

I will make this every year from now on.. We added drippings from the actual turkey, but the kitchen time just prior to serving dinner for 35 people was so much less frantic, having made this delicious gravy ahead of time.

It was quite flavorless for taking so long to make. I should’ve saved my time. The recipe also says to discard all the solid parts used to make the stock and that’s just incredibly wasteful.

Okay Chef, John! I love you!! Well, okay, I love all your recipes! This is my first time making homemade gravy! So I decided to make it today Sunday for our Thanksgiving dinner, and it was amazing! Actually made some mashed potatoes to try it and it was ohhhhhhhhhhhh soooo delish! By the way, I made it with 4 turkey wings, that’s how my market had them- in 4, so I made it with 4 and with about 5 carrots, celeries and like 4 cups of onions. In any case, thank you for this delicious recipe! Happy thanksgiving to all! Cheers!

I have made my gravy like this for years- it's wonderful!  I also cook the neck etc day of to get more stock if needed to add to the gravy.  For the cook that commented that taking the wings off of the turkey bothered her I just buy turkey wings separately they have them packaged in the butcher department.  I also add wine

What an incredible waste of time. My only change was to use turkey thighs and I blended the left-over vegetables to add back in the broth for more flavor. Good thing I did, this wasn't worth the effort and the flavor is incredibly bland. I ended up with a ton of broth that will probably be used for something else, but even the measurements for the 6 cups, flour and butter to make the final product were off. I ended up doubling the flour and butter to the 6 cups of broth and have way more watery gravy than I want. On to the freezer with it and hopes for a better recovery later.

Loved the recipe!  Takes some time due to amount of tme to cook, easy preparation, though.  Makes enough gravy so I didn't have to worry about running out.  Kind of pricey to make, the turkey wings I bought were HUGE and 2was plenty.  The wings cost as much as the turkey breast I got (just cooking for my husband and myself.   But the gravy was so good.  Enough for leftovers.  Highly recommend.

The only changes I made were I used 3 turkey legs since that's what came in the package and I added 1 carton of turkey stock to the pot along with water to cover. This recipe made a wonderful broth and I had a lot of it. The problem I had was getting it to thicken into gravy later. I realized my problem was that I had tried to thicken it in a pot which does not allow for enough evaporation. You should try to make the gravy in a large surface area like a frying pan or even a baking pan across 2 burners. Don't use more than 1/2 inch broth at a time and make sure it is boiling before you add thickener. If you need lots of gravy you may have to do it in batches, but at least it will be thick and velvety!

Made it for Thanksgiving this year and loved it. I added some extra spices but basically a great recipe. Then added the turkey juices and it was amazing!!  All of Chef Johns recipes are wonderful. Also made his scalloped oysters and they were excellent!!

It was a bit of work, but I agree with other reviewers that it needed more turkey wings.  Doctored it up with a little gravy master for a richer color and some drippings from the cooked turkey.  Yes, would probably make it again if I knew time would be a factor for a big group.

I didn't used 10 cups of cold water, instead used 4 c. chicken stock (because I couldnt find turkey) and 3 c. water.  Also, I used 3 large turkey wings and 1 tsp. dried thyme.  This gravy was very uneventful for more and  not worth the time and expense.

This made very good gravy. It was a TON of work.  And I still have to do more before dinner today to add the drippings and fuss with the consistency. The only change I made was half turkey broth instead of water but I did use the full 10 cups. Plenty of flavor. As others stated, you will lose volume as it simmers.

This was my first time making gravy.  I did all main ingredients the same quantity wise, but did take advice of other reviewers and instead of all water, I used 3 cups chicken broth and 7 cups of water.  I was not able to find fresh twigs of thyme so I used 2 tsp dry thyme.  Ended up with 5 cups of stock after the three hour simmer.  I also puréed the veggies after and added about half of it back to stock by pressing through strainer.  I used the given amounts of flour and butter and fat to make the gravy even though I only had 5 cups of stock and it came out to a great consistency.  Added 1/2 tsp salt, couple dashes cayenne, couple dashes celery salt, and a few grindings of fresh pepper.  Yumm!  And my mother was already nibbling on the turkey meat when I pulled it out of the stock, so we are adding it to the main turkey platter.  Other than the turkey, all food is ready to just heat up on Thanksgiving - yay!

DELICIOUS!!!  I'm a pretty good gravy maker and make it quite a bit but this is absolutely THE best turkey gravy I've ever made.  It's just me and hub for dinner tomorrow so I only added about 5 cups of water.  Accordingly I used less flour.  Other than that I followed the recipe omitting the garlic.   It reduced down to about 1 1/2 C of broth.  I had a smallish turkey for just us two and the wings made the flavor just right.  Now that I know I like this gravy I'm going to make a much bigger batch to freeze.  I'll probably add a leg for the next batch to make sure plenty of flavor.  I'm not a fan of canned broth and only use it in a pinch.  Why add something canned when you're going to so much trouble to make this lovely gravy?  Hub LOVES gravy.  This is a keeper!!  Will make this every year now.  Thank you Chef John for another fabulous recipe!!

Made it exactly as per the recipe, except I used King Arthur Gluten-Free flour. The resulting mix failed to thicken without addition of more flour, and had almost no flavor of turkey at all. There was also no fat to skim during cooking, which seemed surprising. This was not anything special.

I made only one change.  I added 2 extra wings.  Somehow I only had 3+ cups of stock after removing the fat and solids though I drained it well.  Because of this, I reduced the fat, butter and flour by half.  That may have been my downfall.  It didn't thicken up.  It also had a sweet taste that was unexpected.  Perhaps it was from the carrots.  We will enjoy this regardless because deep fried turkey is our son-in-law's specialty and canned gravy is an abomination.

We made this for Thanksgiving dinner 2015. It was okay. Not the same as making it from your turkey drippings and it did reflect that in the flavor. Most of my family switched to the vegetarian gravy I made instead. I was disappointed. I suggest just making it from scratch next year (like I always do), or for those that need to- use a mix packet. I think that would be better, tbh.

I had really high hopes for this recipe and after making it as directed, found that it was too sweet and didn't have a deep turkey flavor. I feel like I must have done something wrong, because everyone and their mother liked it.

It surely made my life simpler when I made a Thanksgiving dinner for my Chilean family at Christmas. I used four turkey wings, and my only complaint is that they didn't produce two tablespoons of turkey fat. I also agree that gravy made at the moment from pan drippings has a better flavor, but exchanging some flavor for less last-minute hassle was worth it.

Honestly, this felt pretty intense for my first time making gravy and if there hadn't been a video, I probably wouldn't have made it. I had a few problems: it simmered almost into nonexistence- there wasn't a ton of gravy at the end of the day. It was really hard to get the fat that was needed. I ended up using lard that I had on hand to do that part because I barely got any while simmering. It was kind of a bummer because what did come out was amazing! I just wish more had come out of it. Also! I wish I had known to really let the it set when separating the stuff from the broth... it would have been great to know that it needed a lot of time to really get all that broth out- again, that wouldn't be an issue if there were more in general.

Made this gravy for Thanksgiving dinner, following the recipe to the letter.  Everything smelled great while cooking but the gravy didn't have much flavor.  Ended up adding a packet of dry turkey gravy mix to the pot  for flavor.

I was tired by the time I put this on the stove for Thanksgiving dinner.  I forgot to reduce the amount of stock to 6 cups and ended up with runny gravy.  I didn't throw away the meat that was palatable.  Next time I will give it more time to cook after thickening and use more flour if I have more than 6 cups of stock.  I will also use chicken broth to give it more flavor and puree the vegs instead of throwing them out.  Will make again but learned from the first go around.

I was disappointed in this recipe. It was costly and time consuming for the end product which was bland and awful.   I ended up making gravy from my roasted bird instead. Sorry Chef John, but I can't recommend this one!

This recipe has so much potential for great flavor that my friends and family don't mind having to wait for their "liquid gold".  Here are the changes that I've made to make this a favorite at my house...
* More wings – I use 6 turkey wings. You can also use 2 pounds of chicken wings instead.
* Roast the wings and vegetables up to 90 minutes, layering the meat on the bottom of the roasting pan.
* Deglaze the roast pan with 1-1/2 cups dry white wine instead of water and allow that liquid to reduce to about 1/2 cup before adding to the stockpot.
* Add a mixture of water and turkey/chicken stock to the stockpot (I use 4 cups of each).
* Use equal parts fat (I prefer butter) and flour.  You can give your gravy even more flavor by cooking and whisking the fat/flour misture into a medium or dark brown roux, but the darker the roux gets the less it will work as a thickening agent for your gravy.
* Add the stock into the fat/flour mixture 1 cup at a time, whisking until the liquid is almost completely absorbed before adding the next cup of stock.  
* Remove any meat from the wings, shred and add back into your gravy.
And instead of throwing away the leftover bones/skin/vegetables, I throw them all into the crockpot, cover them with 6 to 8 cups of water, simmer on low up to 24 hours, and strain the liquid into jars for homemade stock. If using turkey, I’ve been able to continue adding water to the solids to get up to 3 batches of stock from the bones.  If using chicken, the bones will

It really boils down if you leave the lid off when it simmers.  I had only 3 cups of stock left to work with.  Next time I am going to leave the pot lid on during part of the simmer process.

Just so so. Should have read all the suggestions first. Gravy tastes more like vegetable soup than gravy. Will probably add the drippings from the roasting pan to give it more taste.

I used 3 turkey drumsticks as my grocer didn't have wings.  I found it very bland, although silky in texture.  When it was all done I did add some ground sage to give it a little more flavor, but I don't think its good enough to use on its own as thanksgiving gravy, and its not nearly enough for our crew of gravy hounds anyway.  I'll do my usual gravy from the pan drippings on the big day and if it looks like we're going to run out, will add some of the Chef's to stretch it out.

My second year to make this gravy.  It takes me all day basically, but so worth it - It's delicious and removes that stress in the too-many-cooks kitchen on the day of Thanksgiving.  I used a few springs of fresh time and rosemary on top of the roasting turkey parts and added an herb bag with those same things in it to the simmering stock.  I used a little water and a bit of balsamic to deglaze the roasting pan.  I used one box of turkey broth (4 cups) for part of my liquid.  I was really patient with the roux and then incorporated the entire amount of broth with the whisk.  I was generous with the salt, pepper and cayenne at the end.  Can't wait to serve this to my guests!

Mine did not come out good at all had no taste I do not know what I did wrong I was so disappointed.  I did exactly what John's video said to do.  I might try it again but use the two wings and a turkey thigh, the first time I did i just covered the meat I did not put a lot of water in the pot.

I made this using three drumsticks, chopped up a large onion, 4-5 stalks of celery, a double handful of baby carrots, coarse chop and one coarse garlic clove, salt and pepper.  Into the oven at 400 and 1 1/2 - 2 hours.  Then into the soup pot with one 32 oz. each of commercial veg. broth and chicken broth, some poultry season, herbes de provence, thyme, two gloves of garlic and thank you to lutzflcat, a heaping dollop of Better that Bouillon turkey base. Then cooked as directed.  No fat to speak of.  When cooked through, stripped the meat, saved for the dog, sandwiches, snacking. (Dog is very spoiled) Put the vegs into the blender and pureed.  The result tasted yummy so put it back into the gravy.  DH helped me bag it up for the freezer.  We will let you know after Thanksgiving how it was received.  DH and I thought it was very good. Thank you lutzflcat and all the other contributors for your great ideas and than you Chef John. Oh, I''ll add any thickening just prior to serving.

Like the idea of roasting the veggies as well as the meat.     BUT - Use thighs or legs.  Can put the meat in your stuffing or gravy or save for sammies. This also does not have enough herbs like poultry seasoning, bay leaves. I use fresh sage leaves too since I need sage for the stuffing & to tuck under the bird's skin as well. Also like some wine and a packet of turkey gravy mix (more turkey flavor).  And a bit of that bottled "Browning Gravy Sauce" gives it a richer color.

This is more trouble then its worth...
Its quicker and easier to make gravy from the turkey broth and u dont have to wait for the turkey to be completely cooked before you make the gravy.

This was just wonderful. Included the 2 cloves of garlic. Instead of 10 cups cold water, used 4 cups turkey broth and 2 cups of of water. (added more broth, depending on thickness and taste in the end). I seasoned the wings before roasting with salt pepper and poultry seasoning I did not include extra salt and pepper while simmering.

This was the best gravy ever.  I always panic over the last minute making gravy.  This was wonderful to make ahead of time and just heat up day of Thanksgiving. Followed all directions, but used 4 turkey wings and didn't add as much water substituted turkey/chicken soup I already had made, also college Inn turkey broth would be good.  But was a pleasure to be stress free day of dinner and not worry my gravy would be too thin or not tasty enough.  As everyone else has said you can tweek it to your own liking.  5 STARS. Marie G.

OUTSTANDING! WOW!  Not only is this replacing my gravy recipe for the holidays that's I've had for many years, I didn't have to make gravy when trying to prepare 8 other dishes for my whole family the day of Thanksgiving.  I thought my gravy was the best I've ever had and it is good but this gravy is packed full of delicious flavor and was a big hit.  I did use like 4 - 5 large smoked turkey wings and added a little more chicken broth (in place of water) and added some chicken bouillon (Herb*ox my favorite, I just didn't add salt). It reheated wonderfully. I am freezing the rest for Christmas! Thank you Chef John for another absolutely wonderful recipe!!

Just finished making this recipe took four to four and one half hours. Instead of water I used chicken broth. Couldn't find wings so used thighs and drumsticks. So delicious. Time consuming but worth it.

I could not find turkey wings so I used a couple of big meaty necks. I missed the pan drippings. I see one reviewer adds her drippings later. I might give that a try. The gravy was very good. It is labor intensive but having that component ready at meal time is a good trade off.

I discovered this recipe this year and made it for Thanksgiving. I used it again for our Christmas turkey. We couldn't find turkey wings at the grocery store, so I used 3 drumsticks and it worked beautifully to make a flavorful stock. This is a great timesaver and even my mom, who never eat meat or poultry, tried the gravy and loved it.

I'm not a new cook, but gravy and its timing on a holiday, with a house full of people, is always what makes me sweat. I've looked at this recipe for some time and finally tried it. Bless you, Chef John! I've just finished it and the flavor is wonderful. I'm sure with the addition of some of the Thanksgiving turkey's goodness it can only get better. Thank you!

Perfect!  Had abode amount from this method, and made another amount from the roast turkey itself.  One needs to remember that “ gravy is not a beverage.”

I made this last night for next week’s Christmas dinner, and it is in the freezer as we speak.  Sure, it was time consuming, but not labor-intensive—it’s the kind of recipe where you perform a couple of steps, wrap a few gifts; perform a couple of steps, watch a little football...that kind of thing.  The result was a silky, smooth, mildly flavored gravy that I can doctor up if needed on the day of the meal.  Oh, BTW, my main course will be chicken, so I followed the recipe but used 10 chicken wings instead of turkey.  I also used 4 cups of chicken broth and 6 cups of water.   I ended up with exactly 6 cups of gravy, as predicted.  Looking forward to serving this on Christmas Day!

I substituted 8 cups of the water with chicken broth. This gravy turned out as expected,  but really wasn't a time saver. I actually feel like this was more work than making gravy from the Turkey pan drippings. The only benefit of making this way is that you can make ahead and still have an authentic gravy. The recipe only made about 5 cups of gravy, so if you're cooking for a big crowd or gravy lovers, consider doubling this .

I rated this a 4 not a 5 simply because the amount of fat shown in the video from 2 turkey wings was misleading. I followed the recipe pretty much exactly except my store had no fresh thyme so I substituted fresh sage. I kept cooking and cooking my stock but barely any fat would bubble up! I wondered what was wrong. Thought maybe the sage somehow reacted with the fat and broke it down-I could have accidentally discovered the next diet craze, haha. Anyway I decided to refrigerate overnight so I would have some fat to skim off, thus defeating the main purpose of the recipe. I still had just a thin layer of fat, more like 2 tsp than 2 tbsp. I had made an herb butter to rub on my turkey and that recipe said to set aside the excess (the stuff that was NOT in contact with the turkey, just to be clear & avoid giving people salmonella) for your gravy. I made the roux as directed by CJ, added the herb butter w flour for more roux, added the stock-it was probably pretty concentrated because I’d cooked it longer due to my no-fat problem-and thinned it a bit with potato water from the mashed potatoes. Then seasoned as directed. So I still was able to make the gravy before taking turkey out of oven, just not the day before like I wanted. It was very good, everyone complimented it, a beautiful dark color, no Kitchen Bouquet needed! and very herby from the herb butter. Regular butter would serve as well.But if you want to use all turkey fat, listen to other reviewers & cook more wings!

Made this for Thanksgiving dinner.  Making it ahead of time is genius!!  I would suggest a couple of changes.  I saw other reviewers talking about the amount of water vs. the amount of turkey meat.  I used 4 cups chicken broth and 4 cups water.  I also increased the turkey wings to 4.  It still needed more flavor.  Next time I will use all broth and will probably add some turkey legs or thighs.  Overall this was fantastic and a real time and stress savor for Thanksgiving day.  I added the drippings from the turkey that day and it was fantastic.  This will be my gravy from now on.  I gave it four stars as written but with the adjustments it's definitely a 5 star.

Everything worked great. But after cooking the stock for three hours I had only 8 cups instead of 10. So I had to make more stock. Lucky for me I have an Instant Pot. The flavor of this stick is great and I used the reserved turkey fat for the roux. Then I combined the original stock and the Instant Pot stock to make the gravy. Since I used giblets for the IP gravy I chopped and added to it. Came out awesome and I had enough for dinner for 5 and two more dinners. I froze the rest about a cup and a half. Loved doing this ahead of time. Roasting the wings gives it such flavor and I added some pan juices. Too. Next time I will add more water while cooking.

This was fabulous. It took our turkey dinner up a few notches. Granted I was never especially good at making gravy from pan drippings and this year the turkey was being made on the grill so I would not even have pan drippings. I followed the recipe. It took longer than expected but was very simple and the reward (the incredible tasting gravy) was worth it. I used the 10 cups of water and in the end  only had 5 cups of gravy. Not nearly as much left as expected. Would have liked more leftover.

I made this gravy 2 days before Thanksgiving this year.  Yes, it did save time for the big day--all I did was reheat it on the stovetop.  And I was very grateful.  Of course, it took some time the evening I made it.  It had to roast and then simmer for 3 hours.  But the flavor was very good, somewhat subtle rather than WOW.  I let some of the water evaporate while simmering to intensify the flavor.  Will do this again next year.  Thanks Chef John!

awesome! messed up and bought 4 chicken thighs, and it worked great, just required more water to cover which resulted in more broth.  Threw the giblets in too since I'd started bry-brining the turkey already.  I made the stock the day before Thanksgiving, and refrigerated it so I could prepare the gravy fresh while the turkey roasted.  It worked wonderfully!   I still only used 6 cups of broth for the gravy (froze the remaining stock), but found I needed 2 tbsp. more each of butter/flour  to get it to the right consistency.  Best gravy I've made over the years, and way less stressful.

I will use this as my go to gravy from now on. I do think I'll add either turkey stock or chicken stock instead of some of the water next time. I did use 4 turkey wings instead of two and I seasoned it well with lawry's seasoning salt and fresh ground pepper.

I have been using this recipe for a number of years, sometimes with variations. This year I couldn't find turkey wings, but got abut 5 necks to work with.  The result was still the same... the best Turkey gravy! Ever!

Don’t change a thing about this recipe!  It is amazing just as CJ intended!  This is my second Thanksgiving making this and it is coming again next year.  I’m notorious for ruining the gravy the DAY OF...this recipe is 100% redemption for back up jars from Thanksgivings past!!!  Don’t be afraid of the cayenne.  Flavor does not have to mean heat.

We doubled the recipe and cooked three large  Turkey wings from the market. I’m just cooking those wings took over two hours. Her than that we follow the recipe right to a T. Fortunately he could use some kind of seasoning to kick it off. It only tasted like turkey gravy but I could’ve used a little more kick

WOW!!!! I needed a gravy with no onions as I just found out I am allergic them. The only thing I did different was omit the onions and I had 4 turkey wings as that's what came in the package I bought. This came out FANTASTIC and I plan to save it for the next couple of days for Thanksgiving. THANK YOU!!!

Made it as written and it turned out great. Have my husband a taste and said he could drink it. Instead of throwing out the solids, I threw away the bones and, over a couple days mixed it in with my yellow lab’s dry food and she demolished it.

Great make-a-head gravy. I use chicken legs because that’s what I had in the freezer, about 10 of them. I doubled the recipe so I had to use 20 cups of water five of which were chicken stock or broth and two of which were white wine simply because I needed to use up the bottle of wine. Everything else was the same. I cooked the chicken legs for about two hours on 425. I’ve been simmered the broth for a good three hours maybe 3 1/2 hours. The consistency is smooth. The flavor is there. Not too overpowering not bland. I added a teeny bit of salt at the end along with pepper and a splash of poultry seasoning. This is a great recipe that anyone can alter to their taste buds and preferences. I think as long as you get the base right which is cooking the chicken in the oven for an appropriate amount of time for there to be a bit of “ char“ at the bottom of the pan then you’ll be fine with the rest. During the three hours that the broth is simmering you should taste it to make sure it tastes good. That is the point where you should also add a bit more seasoning to your liking.

This took a long time to prepare and like some others, I lost a lot of liquid while it was simmering. I added more water so that I could have 6 cups at the end. I also substituted white wine for 2 cups of the water. After I let the gravy simmer to thicken, I had to add salt and cornstarch to get the finished product. But I will have to say, I’m glad we won’t be making gravy on Thanksgiving Day-it’s already done!! So it was worth the trouble!!

I've made this ahead now 2 years in a row as last year this gravy was a hit. The only thing i changed was to add the pan drippings from the turkey, lightly apple wood and hickory smoked on the grill and grilled to temperature.

The gravy is outstanding.

Ok here's what I do. I make the gravy according to Chef John's recipe except, instead of adding 10 cups of water, which I feel is too much, I add 8 cups of Swanson (Swanson is best) turkey broth or chicken broth. That would be 2 of the 32 ounce boxes of broth. I also use 4 wings instead of 2, and add an extra 2 Tablespoons of flour to the roux. You want it to be quite thick because you will add the whole thing to your pan drippings later.
Once made, I taste it and, if I want more turkey flavor, I add a heaping teaspoon of the Better Than Bouillon turkey base. Mix it in and taste it again. I keep adding a teaspoon at a time until I like the flavor. On Thanksgiving, I take the turkey out of the roaster, pour all the drippings in a gravy separator (Oxo makes a great separator), throw out all the grease, then I add the drippings (minus the grease) back into the roasting pan. Then I take the make-ahead gravy and dump it into all those delicious drippings and mix it in as I heat it up. Make sure you get all the delicious stuff that has stuck to the pan mixed in. Believe me, your guests will be raving over your delicious gravy!! My husband calls my gravy "the nectar of the Gods"

Great recipe,  It was cheaper to just buy a second turkey at .68 cents a pound rather than buy turkey wings.  Winter time meals later on........Threw the neck and back bone in with the wings to roast.  Had to strain out one lumps of flour but no big deal.  Flavor is great.  Salt and pepper and a pinch of poultry seasoning added.  plus some of the roasted meat shredded up, a family tradition.

Just made this ahead of time for Thanksgiving, and it is excellent!  The only thing I added was some chicken base since others thought it was a little bland with just water, and simmered for 4 hours instead of 3.  Came out perfect and very tasty. I made quite a mess, and you have to commit the time to be around to keep an eye on the stove, but to save time on the most hectic cooking day around, no contest. Thanks again Chef John for another winner!

I have always struggled with the gravy on Thanksgiving, even to the point of buying it from the country club (big mistake).  This was very good.  I did use low sodium chicken broth instead of the water.

This gravy is wonderful. It’s a fair amount of work, but it’s a great way not to have so much to do on Thanksgiving Day, especially at the last minute. I also feel it has nutritional value, whereas there really isn’t that much in the gravy you make at the last minute from pan drippings.

I made this gravy last year and I have to say, it saved the day!  I had so much going on that it was wonderful to have this made ahead and it was really tasty.  I may have tweaked it here and there (as I am in the habit of doing!), but basically stuck to the recipe.  Thanks Chef John.  Think I will be using this recipe a lot!

This was a perfect solution to the problem of making turkey gravy from the turkey drippings after the turkey has been roasted. I often did not have enough gravy. I made 2 quarts of gravy from this recipe, and everyone was satisfied. I was able to use the gravy for several meals after Thanksgiving. 

I will try to spice it up more the next time I make it. (I don't use garlic, so have to use different combinations of pepper flakes and herbs to create a spicy dish.)

Love doing gravey this way tastes great and is a real time saver when guests arrive and it’s time to put dinner on the table. I was amazed at how great my gravy turned out. I’ve used this recipe for turkey and pork both are perfect , thank you Chef John

Been making this for the last 3 times I've roasted a turkey for the holidays. I use whole turkey wings that include the drummette, wing, and tip. I found that carmelizing the vegetables during the roasting process produces a richer flavor and color to the gravy.  I add cooked chopped giblets to the gravy. This is the gravy I serve with the bird for the big meal. After guests are gone and the kitchen is mine again, I make traditional gravy from the roasted bird drippings. This way there's  less panic and plenty of gravy for leftovers and pot pies.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was surprisingly good.  I had 2 large wings and a back, which I oiled and put in a jelly roll pan at 350.  An hour or so later, I added the vegetables and roasted it for another hour and a half or longer until it was a lovely golden color.  I did keep an eye on it.  Then I followed the directions as written, though I didn't have fresh thyme.  Simmered it a long time until the meat was falling off the bones, then I strained it and let it cool.  Put it in fridge overnight, skimmed off the fat, heated it up, strained it thru cheesecloth, and continued with the recipe.  It was very good.  The meat from the bones was a hit with the dogs and the gravy was a hit at the table.  Will do this again.

Excellent receipt.  I usually try to make it exactly as listed, but I was not able to get turkey wings.  I used turkey thighs and I also used the neck.  I did add a table spoon of better then bullion chick stock.  My wife, who is not a gravy fan, loved it.  Easy to make and full of flavor.

I used 5 turkey necks instead of wings (they were cheaper at the store)...GREAT flavor.  I didn't have fresh Thyme, so used 1 tsp. thyme leaves.  I also added 1 tsp. minced garlic, 1 bay leave and 1 tsp. chicken bouillon to the stock. 

I cleaned off the meat from the necks and used it for my bread stuffing (let's not waste). 

I was worried that the gravy wouldn't reheat well (I was afraid it would break down and be runny).  I was pleasantly surprised...I had rave reviews.  

Making the gravy ahead of time, took a lot of stress out of getting everything on the table at the right time and I enjoyed more time with my guests.  I love homemade gravy and will not buy that stuff that they sell in jars at the store.

My grocery store was out of turkey wings so I substituted turkey legs. That was the only change I made to the recipe. The gravy received rave reviews from all my family and guests. "The best you have ever made." I made the gravy two days ahead of time. Reheated it and voila, fantastic gravy.

The only change I made was 4 wings instead of two, and that's only because that is what I bought and I wasn't about to let the wings to to waste.

Delicious gravy, there was none left. My only complaint is that next year I have to make more!

Good flavor but the gravy came out grainy. I’m not sure if it was the recipe or me, to be honest. I did triple the recipe to make a larger amount for Thanksgiving - it was way too much. I probably would have been fine with the original serving size.

This was the first Thanksgiving that, 1 I had plenty of gravy for everyone and some left over, 2 did have to go crazy trying to make gravy after smoking and frying turkey.  Tasted amazing and everyone loved it after putting a few personal touches to it before serving.

Best turkey gravy we ever had. The turkey wings we bought were really very large, so we used 2X the mirepoix veggies and all the water listed. We had to use dried thyme which turned out fine (but might have been better of course if fresh was available). Roux directions were really helpful.  Thank you for the recipe!

If I could I would give this recipe 10 Stars.  I’ve made it 3 years in a row, it is perfect.  My family and friends call it Liquid Gold.  Although it takes a long time, it’s simple and easy and worth it. I will never make any other turkey gravy. Just DELIS!!

Used this recipe for my first gravy. I used smoked turkey stock that I saved from cooking split pea and smoked turkey. I followed the rest of the recipe. Used garlic. Absolutely delicious.

Particularly impressed with how smooth it is, and it's hours before the turkey dinner and the gravy is ready! Want to know how it will be when i add in some turkey drippings too.

turned out pretty great, I doubled everything to make a really large batch for the 31+ people I have coming over.
I had read in a magazine to add a little soy sauce and maple syrup for flavor, so I did that. I had a little stock left over and I will make another gravy with the drippings tomorrow (when I am roasting the turkey) but this definitely took the pressure off of me to get it absolutely right with so many people waiting for it. The only thing that I didn't love is that the color is pretty light, I prefer a slightly darker gravy aesthetically, but the taste was great with my few additions! Will make again!

I made this recipe in advance for the Thanksgiving, I loved it and so did my husband. Thanksgiving is tomorrow so I will update to see what my family members said about the gravy. I did tweak the recipe up, I doubled the veggies, and while they were in the oven i added 2 cloves of garlic, and the neck.  I added 4 cups of chicken stock, 1 reduced sodium chicken flavored bouillon, 8 cups of water, bay leaves and a rosemary, it simmered on low with the lid on and I ended up with 2.5 quarts of stock.  For the ROUX I added 3/4 cup of flour to my butter and turkey fat, my gravy was on the runny side but that was my fault next time will be adding more flour.. to thicken it up I pureed the vegetables from the stock and some meat from the wings, it DID thicken and it definitely added more FLAVOR!!  My husband said that this recipe is a keeper and that he doesn't want any more packet gravy!  I will be definitely be keeping this recipe. Maybe next time I will follow the recipe to the T if I don't have to make the most of my gravy to take to 2 different party dinners celebrations, LOL.

A lot of work for a recipe that all comes down to how much salt and pepper you add at the end. I’ll stick with adding chicken stock to pan drippings the day of in the future.

I just made this and followed the recipe exactly. After 3 hours of simmering, I have strained the mixture and I have 2 cups of liquid. (not 6 cups). Luckily, Thanksgiving is in 2 days so I have time to doctor the 2 cups up with broth or something else. Seems like a lot of work for 2 cups of turkey stock. Won't make this one again.

This turned out well. I doubled the veggies, and once the gravy was simmering I added more spices, like a little sage, more time, white pepper and some smoked salt.

Excellent!!!!  But I substituted store bought turkey broth for the water.  Afraid that the water wouldn't add much flavor as the turkey broth would!

Turned out great! This recipe does ask for a lot of water which required me to thicken it a bit with cornstarch. I added white wine and soy sauce (great ingredient for gravy) for extra flavor.

I had too much fat, between the oil, turkey wings and butter, I ended up spooning out almost 1/2 cup of fat and still needed to add cornstarch mixed with chicken broth to soak up the rest  I also added extra garlic, poultry seasoning and fresh rosemary.  I will probably make again with some modifications, including less onions.  They made the gravy a bit too sweet for our taste.

Loved making this ahead of time so as not to delay dinner once the turkey settled. The whole family raved that this gravy was awesome.

Used thighs since store was out of wings. Used 8 cups water and 4 cups chicken broth and let reduce longer, about 5 hours. Only ended up with about 4 cups liquid so reduced flour a bit. Incredible taste and will do again.

I just made this recipe! it is the best Turkey gravy I've ever tasted. at first I thought it was too much work however I cooked it in two days. Made the stock as instructed allowed it to cool down a bit and put it in a large mason jar in the refrigerator. The next morning I took it out and the turkey fat was at the top nice and hard so I was able to scrape it off and follow the rest of the instructions. I will allow it to cool and will freeze for later use.
  Made two cups extra added just a little bit more flower about a tablespoon and another tablespoon of butter.

Another 5 star from Chef John! After reading reviews, the only change I made was to use 4 turkey wings and use chicken broth for all of the liquid. I followed the instructions exactly. I only ended up with a little over 4 cups of stock to make the gravy and was concerned but it is the most flavorful gravy I have ever had....definitely will make again!

I made this today but had to use turkey legs could not  find wings. I froze it for Thanksgiving. It was time consuming to make but feel it’s going to be worth it and a time saver on Thanksgiving. My taste test today I thought it was very good! Let’s hope it passes the taste test for my guests.

Great way to get another dish out of the way ahead of time!
My edits:
I put vegetables including thyme and lots of whole cloves garlic in bottom of my huge cast iron skilletand put 3 turkey wings on top , salted & peppered and roasted 1 hour at 400 stirring and turning wings over ½ way through.
I used 6 cups low sodium chicken broth and 4 cups water to simmer on stove. I may add another wing this year. I also add some of the turkey drippings when heating on Thanksgiving for more flavor.  On Thanksgiving, I heat it in my 2 quart slow cookerad save space on the stovetop!

Added 1tsp. Poultry seasoning.  When you deep fry your turkey and your family is screaming for gravy, this is the best way to go. Will definitely make again. I did use chicken stock instead of water.

I have made this recipe twice with no substitutions.  Absolutely delicious!  Tastes great when done.  I have put it in the freezer for a few weeks before Thanksgiving and let it thaw on the way to the sister-in-law who doesn't cook.  We have added Turkey drippings to it, but it doesn't really need it.
This is my favorite turkey gravy recipe.  I make as much as I can to take with me to make the day easier.  Love it!

If you use chicken broth instead of water, you get a much richer flavor.

THIS RECIPE IS THE BEST!  I HATE MAKING TURKEY GRAVY BECAUSE YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO WAIT TILL THE LAST MINUTE AND IT TAKES SO LONG AND I USUALLY END UP HAVING JAR GRAVY OR POWDER ON HAND THAT HAVE NO TASTE.
THIS WAS SO TASTY, EASY TO MAKE AND IT THICKENS UP AFTER REFRIGERATING. I REALLY LIKE THE IDEA OF USING ALL FRESH VEGGIES AND REAL TURKEY FLAVORING.  I LOVED IT!!  THANK YOU FOR THE RECIPE - I WILL BE USING THIS ALL THE TIME!!

Made double amount for a work thanksgiving potluck using chicken stock for half  of water. Coworker thought it so yummy she asked if she could take remaining home for her family's Thanksgiving dinner. The following Monday  she stated everyone loved it. Her aunt then asked her if she could take the leftover home! 3 separate Thanksgiving celebrations. Worth the time and effort.

I used organic chicken broth instead of water. Everything else was the same. Oh, I always use arrowroot flour for thickening (roux) since I can't tolerate gluten in regular flour. Used the same quantity of arrowroot as reg. flour. This gravy turned out exactly as in the video. Nice dark color & perfect thickness of gravy. I love it........def. a keeper. Worth the time it takes.

This recipe is a lifesaver. I’ve made this a few times and it’s delicious and eliminates the last minute stress of making the gravy after the turkey is done. I do add some pan juices to the gravy to bring in some of the additional flavors (this year maple and apple cider), but that takes a second. Even though it does take some time to make this gravy, its so nice that you don’t have to coordinate this with everything else on Thanksgiving!!!

I made this gravy three days before Thanksgiving this year.  It turned out great.  I didn't use 10 cups of water but about a quart of turkey/chicken broth.  It was so nice not having to stress over making turkey gravy at the last minute.  It was delicious.

I preppep many side dishes the day before Thanksgiving and was the first time to make gravy the day before. It saved a lot of time and it turned out great. I would definitely make it again. I agree with the other reviews using 10 C of water was a bit much. I just cut down the recipe in half and I don’t measure when I cook and it was delicious!

You might get into the middle of this recipe and start to wonder if it's way too much trouble just for some gravy.  DON'T DO THAT!! It's totally worth all the work!  Every year at Thanksgiving, gravy has been an after-thought for me.  I take what's left in the bottom of the pan after roasting the turkey and try to make a gravy out of it.  It's always disappointing at best.  This year I made this recipe instead, and I couldn't believe the difference!  I didn't change a thing from the original recipe, and it was so creamy and yummy! It really made our Thanksgiving dinner complete.  I'll definitely be making this every year going forward!

Delicious and easy,. We usually smoke our thanksgiving turkey so we don’t have meat juices to use to make a gravy.  I have tried different things through the years but this was by far the best.  It was nice to just warm an already made gravy during the last minute rush of putting the meal together  and my family loved it. I added smoked paprika and used sage instead of thyme but everything else remained the same.  I plan to make this every year.

Made this gravy for Thanksgiving and my family and extended family loved it!  It's a keeper.  Worth the extra effort to make it.  It really wasn't that hard to do.  Kids are already saying they want me to make this again.

Firstly I love that you can make it in advance.  Last year it came out so well using the cut turkey wings.  YUM!!  This year I did it on the Monday BEFORE Thanksgiving which took stress off me.  This time I was cooking only a turkey breast so in order to make this recipe, I bought a chicken roaster--cut off the wings and drumsticks and proceeded with the recipe as written.  The gravy was good but not as full flavored as with the turkey wings but a good alternative.  (I then butterflied the roaster and put it on the grill for a wonderful dinner.)   I recommend this recipe!

To avoid the stress of the last minute gravy dilemma, I gave this a try and it was very good! It was a pretty lengthy process and I was shocked at how expensive turkey wings were. The gravy turned out tasty, but in the end I made my own also (never too much gravy!). It's easy,gets rave reviews, and costs next to nothing. After 50 years of hosting, I should not be afraid  of making my own gravy but I know I that IF it doesn't turn out well, it could spoil the whole meal for some people.

I used chicken broth instead of water. It turned out great even tho it was a bit time consuming. It was a relief to have it done ahead of time!

I  made this on the Tuesday before Thanksgiving.  I would have made the stock earlier, but my butcher doesn't have the wings until the Monday before Thanksgiving.  What's up with that?  

I felt it was a good starting point; a bit too anemic for me. I wanted more color and it didn't have it.  It was as white as the turkey.  However, the day I made it I was disappointed, but when I reheated it on Thanksgiving, it tasted much better.  I put two whole sprigs of thyme in the day I made it and pulled them out.  Much better.  I do think that I was careless reheating it because it came to a rolling boil and separated. Other than that, it made my day much easier and my kitchen didn't look like the usual train wreck. Thanks for the great video.

I was a little unsure of the recipe because I had read some of the reviews pointing out some issues others had.  I shouldn't have had any concerns- this recipe was perfect in every way.  I made everything ahead and then whisked in the heated flour/butter at the end (which you can increase the amount of depending on how thick you want the gravy to be).  I had so many rave reviews that I felt an obligation to point out the recipe wasn't mine!  If you want a more concentrated broth, you can decrease the water- instead, I increased the turkey and it made a rich, tasty base.  The turkey and veggies I strained out were perfect for a doggie casserole I feed my canines on the holidays- if you don't have dogs, you can easily make a soup or a creamed dish with the cooked items (no waste necessary).  I did use the garlic (definitely not overpowering in any way) and I used thyme I had dehydrated from my garden, but the commercial type would have been fine.  All in all, a perfect experience with a recipe and a wonderful idea I could make ahead.

I really wanted this to be awesome, but it's very bland. I roasted 4 turkey wings with recommended amount of veggies, even added a couple cloves of garlic. When simmering, I used 1 box of turkey stock and water, this still isn't enough flavor. I will heat it tomorrow and when my turkey is finished I will add my pan drippings and that should take care of it. Sounded like such a good idea, but it's just lacking that hearty flavor.

Followed recipe to the letter.....and was not very good nor did it yield much (about 3 cups yield).   Chose to toss vs. serve to my Thanksgiving guests.  Thankful I bought jar gravy just in case.

I made this for the first time a few years ago.  This year, I used turkey stock instead of water.  It was even better!  It just takes planning ahead.  I made the base a few days ahead of time.  Now I just need to finish it the day I need it.  Best gravy ever!

Like others I was very excited to make this. I thought not only was I going to have a ton of homemade gravy I also thought it would be delicious. Well it was a lot of work, a ton of time and it yielded bland results. I even tried adding a packet of gravy and that didn’t do much for it either. Pretty disappointed guys.

Made this today to freeze & use next week for a large Thanksgiving group. Used 4 lg. Turkey wings & 12 cups of Turkey broth instead of water. Otherwise followed the recipe. To me I'm tasting a little too much flour as is (used the 1/2 cup as directed). Will browse the market tomorrow & doctor it up with a turkey base or dry turkey gravy mix to disguise the flour taste a little, then freeze. Love the velvet consistency and thrilled to have this done ahead of time.

This is such a delicious recipe.   I made it and froze it for Thanksgiving.   I roasted a small turkey to make the gravy and stock.   Used the meat for chili and soup.   This takes all the stress out of making gravy on a day when you are busy all day at the stove.

Turned out great.  Smelled wonderful.  Made it for our smoked turkey which of course you don't get gravy with. But everyone still wants the gravy.  I ended up using turkey thighs as the butcher didn't have any wings.  Kept the meat to make soup.  Added salt pepper and thyme as the the spices.

I have been making Chef John’s recipe for quite a few years now. About the only thing I’ve changed is I add about 1/2 white wine to the gravy. Everyone raves about this gravy. It does freeze perfect so when you cook the turkey, having the gravy made ahead of time makes me feel less rushed. ??

The perfect gravy if you deep fry your turkey.  We made 2 turkeys for Thanksgiving so I used 4 wings instead of 2.  Loved having the gravy done instead of preparing it at the last minute.  This recipe is a keeper!

The only gravy I've made that topped it is from the actual stuffed and roasted turkey drippings.  One thing though - this is not a quick recipe - it takes time and is truly a tasty make a head.

Gravy came out great. Husband usually makes the gravy, which is fine, but he uses Cream of Mushroom Soup. I preferred this yummy recipe. It was also my oldest son's favorite part of dinner.

I made a double batch. I had bought a small secondary turkey to supplement our big bird and used the wings and legs from that one for the gravy. The recipe is time consuming but you can let it cook throughout an evening a few days before Thanksgiving. The recipe is very forgiving and can be adjusted as you go. I had found it too thin, so I just added more flour mixed in with the stock to thicken it. Definitely watch the video!.

Absolutely delicious! I couldn't find turkey wings or thighs so I used chicken thighs and it came out perfectly.  I was so excited to serve such delicious gravy full of flavor and silky smooth with no lumps on Thanksgiving.  This is restaurant quality for sure and worth the extra effort for a special occasion.

Made this for Thanksgiving this year and last year.  Very good recipe plus it takes all the tension out of getting perfect lump free gravy on "The Day".  Thank you Chef John.  Can always count on Chef John.

I doubled the turkey wings and vegetables then I added 14 cups of water.  I ended up with 6 cups of stock.  This turned out  perfectly.

I love this recipe! it is easy, I make it 1-2 days before Thanksgiving, and it is so flavorful! I just heat it up on Thanksgiving, cutting down on some of the last minute tasks that have to be done.

This helped get everything on the table at the same time. A wonderful time saving make ahead recipe. We also made our mashed potatoes ahead and put them in a crock. The only thing we had to do at dinner time was carve the turkey.

Amazing but I did what others have done added chicken stock in place of some of the water and purée the vegs but took out the celery. This made it thick and added salt and pepper. My husband is a chef and he said it was the best and we will do it again for sure.

I was curious about how this would turn out.  I followed the directions with the one exception.  I replaced the 10 cups of water with 96 ounces of  reduced sodium chicken broth.  This was absolutely the best  turkey gravy we've ever had.  If I could give this 10 stars, I would!

The only thing I did differently was to make this to the stock stage without any skimming of the fat.  I chilled it so the fat would solidify on top.  It made things so much easier to just take the fat off and use that for the roux.  GREAT depth of flavor!

Fantastic recipe -- I used a bit less water and since turkey is very hard to come by in South Africa, I used chicken wings instead  -- the best gravy I've ever made.  I put it on top of a sous vide turkey I made (major improvement to the traditional roasting method). Thanks chef john

Total stress reliever and ultimate time saver!  I used 4 turkey legs and the stock and gravy came out spectacular.  Made this a week in advance and didn't have that last minute lumpy sauce I typically serve at my feast!  Thank you Chef John, this one did not disappoint!

Excellent results.  I used four wings and went half water and half chicken broth.  A question and a comment:  What fat?  My turkey must have been on Atkins.  Also, anyone who can throw away perfectly good turkey didn't grow up in my neighborhood.

I made this last year and will make it again this year.  I also added some celery salt and used mostly chicken broth.  But it's really an exceptional recipe even as-is and will make your holiday dinner significantly easier.  I paired it with the make ahead mashed potatoes.  I really enjoyed my holiday dinner last year!!

Made this and used four turkey wings, subbed 8 cups of chicken broth for 8 cups of the water (and added two cups of water) and followed the directions, as stated.  This was very tasty and did not need any salt (with the addition of the chicken broth).  It's nice to have my gravy ready a week ahead of time!  I'm sticking it in the freezer and will defrost it and warm it up next week for Thanksgiving!

This was a huge undertaking for me as I'm not known as a cook in my family.  However, my husband is making a turkey as our part of the family Passover dinner and the kids will only eat it with gravy.  I decided to make it from scratch.
Your recipe didn't seem difficult, just lots of steps and time.  The result was perfect.  We actually did end up with lumps and had to strain the gravy once it was done, but that worked wonderfully.  I now have a large container in the freezer ready to bring to my niece's Friday afternoon.
It did need salt which we added to the finished product.  I am now saying "we" because my husband got home from work after the roasting pan part was done.  He was impressed I did that on my own, but we watched your video together twice to make sure we could get the rest done even though I had to wake him at the final step.  
I will make this again, but only for a large dinner or if we hosted family Thanksgiving. Too long and too many things to clean up after.  
Oh, I used chicken broth for 4 cups and then cold water for the rest.  Just think it gives more flavor.  Also, we kept the dark meat for the dogs to have as a treat with dinner over the next few nights in their food.

I used this for Thanksgiving, making it the day before.  I will definitely make this again because it is SO nice to have it already done when everything is crazy on the day of the dinner.  I followed the recipe exactly.  The only problem I had was that when I checked my veggies and wings at 45 minutes, they were already too done and stuck to the roasting pan.   I guess I need to check my oven temp... however, the gravy still turned out fine.   I will be checking my wings earlier next time.

My nine year old daughter helped me make this for Thanksgiving 2015!  We didn't make it ahead of time however.  Nonetheless, it was fabulous.  We followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect.  My daughter is NOT a gravy person, but she LOVED this and has already requested it for this year.

I made it in Brazil as a side dish to a turkey and since we do not have all the the ingredients here in Brazil I had to adapt some of the ingredients. Even so it was great and besides all the work it demands it's a great recipe.

Yes, it takes a long time but it is delicious! I had a leftover chicken back from another recipe, so I used that instead of turkey wings. I did end up with a lot less gravy than expected, but it was still perfect for us. Using the recommended amount of water for simmering, this left about 3 cups of the best gravy I've ever had. I also did not have fresh thyme, so I substituted dried thyme. Will definitely make this again.

Best gravy ever!!!  Not to mention how nice it is to have gravy made ahead of time. I  did use the recommendations of other raters by reducing the water to 3 1/2 cups with stock of 3 1/2 cups.

I did the gravy only as I already had cooked pork for the meat and had saved the broth. I had to vary ingredients due to dietary restrictions.. used 3 T Ghee and 2 T red palm oil and then the gluten free flour (Namaste's Perfect Flour Blend). Came out great!  I added carmelized onions I had made previously for extra flavor.  Very tasty alternative for those who have gluten issues.

Had to use chicken wings, hard to find turkey wings in Australia.
Made it a week ahead and froze, on the day was easy and great.

Loved it and it TOTALLY saved time….what I did different is what John mentions in the video - I also used the pan drippings from the turkey I cooked on the day of….used my gravy separated and just added some extra bits from the cooked turkey…the gravy recipe does take some time but it is leisurely done a couple days before.  Finding the turkey wings was a snap - I found them at my local market.   I also added more thyme and sage.  Bravo John!!!!!  You've changed the way I do Thanksgiving Day!

This is very good gravy and very time consuming - but worth it.   I had 3 wings in my pack, so I roasted 3 wings with the veggies. After roasting, my husband ate one wing so two went into my stock pot.  I used 1/2 water and 1/2 chicken stock for my stock pot - actually more than the recipe called for.  I added extra chicken stock to the turkey stock to make more gravy and ended up with 5 1/2 cups of gravy.  I divided into two freezer bags for the Holidays.  The only thing I will change next time is to use my slow cooker for simmering the turkey and vegetables because of time involved.  I put the turkey meat into a freezer bag for a future pot pie and pureed the "discarded" veggies and added to the freezer bag for pot pie flavoring.

Awesome and well worth the time to make it. The family loved it and have demanded it is to be made every year now.  I don't know if that is a blessing or a curse...hmmm.  Anyway, I followed some of the hints and used the neck as well as the two wings.  For next year, I think I will use turkey broth instead of water as some have suggested.  I did take one person's advice and make the broth from the carcass and then freeze it.  I'm part way there for next year!  No wasted part of the bird.

This made a BEAUTIFUL gravy! A bit labor intensive but more than worth it, on Thanksgiving day I placed the gravy in a small crock pot next to my "crock pot mashed potatoes".  It was so nice not having that mess or stress in the kitchen once the turkey comes out of the pan.  I served it the way the recipe called for but for leftovers, I added a boiled egg and some of the meat from the turkey neck.  Equally delicious, just not as appealing to the eye.

I omitted cayenne pepper and garlic.   Followed all other directions. This is amazing. It's so much easier than waiting for the turkey to be done and hurrying at the last minute.  Made my holiday much better!!!

This recipe was excellent!  I could only get a turkey leg for the meat, but it was just as good.  Making the gravy ahead was a big time saver, and since my brined turkey never has any juices or fat renderings, I knew that I would be stressed out if I didn't do something different this year.  Definitely a keeper!

This is going to be my go to recipe for turkey gravy!  Using a food processor made prep a snap and once it is simmering away you don't have to do too much to it other than give it a stir once in a while.  I strained it through cheesecloth and froze the liquid for 3 days, thawed it overnight and finished it with the rest of the ingredients right before dinner.  Got lots of compliments from the family.

Not only does this recipe free up time, but using the stock makes a better tasting gravy than drippings alone.

I brine my turkey so I can't use the drippings for gravy.  Well I could, but I don't think my blood pressure could handle it!! :-p . I've tried other turkey stock gravy recipes but none come close to this one.  The roasted wings and veggies give the stock a rich deep flavor.  The use of the roux as a thickener (as opposed to adding flour of cornstarch) also adds depth.  Since I like mushrooms in my gravy I had to cook them in the stock for a while to soften them.  Added some hardboiled egg too!  This one is a keeper!!!

I didn't want to remove the turkey from it's wrapping before Thanksgiving, so I looked for turkey wings at my local market. There were none, so I bought 2 turkey backs & used them instead. Other than that, I followed Chef John's recipe - super delicious, and you couldn't tell that I didn't make it in a last-minute frenzy.

I made this gravy two weeks before Thanksgiving.This is time consuming as far as you need to plan to hang around while it's roasting and simmering doing it's magic, but you can get lots of stuff done around the house during this time. I was afraid it would be difficult finding a couple of turkey wings a couple of weeks before Thanksgiving, but I found some at Walmart. I froze the gravy after it had cooled completely. Don't be worried about how the gravy looks consistency wise after it's defrosted (but before you've reheated it). Once you gently heat it up it's just like you had made that gravy that day. It's delicious. Give it a try. Oh, and I do agree with Jonah's mom -- it doesn't make as much as the recipe states and I simmered it very gently trying to avoid a lot of evaporation. I ended up with 4 1/2 cups instead of 6.

I couldn't find the turkey wings, so I substituted with two large turkey thighs and one turkey neck.  I added more than a pinch of cayenne pepper, perhaps 1/2 tsp or a bit more.  This gravy is my favorite.

The store was out of wings - I got legs from the butcher - the gravy turned out divine!!! I used 1/2 water and 1/2 chicken stock to equal 8 cups total liquid as suggested by others and had to squeeze the veggies/meat to get the 6 cups at the end. Next time I'd use more liquid to start. This is the best gravy I've ever had. We're gluten free so I used "Cup for Cup" flour instead of wheat flour and it worked and tasted great!

This gravy is the best gravy I've ever tasted. I only had 4 turkey wings and it still came out great. I refrigerated it overnight and by the next day it got really thick so I just put it back in a saucepan and added enough chicken stock to thin it out again. Really good!

This was a good recipe but it lacked some serious flavor for my taste. After tasting the broth I decided to go ahead and add various herbs and seasonings that I used for my turkey so they would marry well and that helped tremendously. I added the neck to the simmer stage, I didn't think of using that ahead of time since I didn't have it out and I also ended up simmering a bit longer to cook that fully. I was shocked to find that I had exactly 6 cups of liquid left  so it worked out great.  That amount of flour made a slightly thin gravy but my guests loved it anyway. I will definitely do it again, with my modifications.

Perfect gravy! Great flavor and made the mad dash on Thanksgiving day much less stressful especially for those of us who have small apartment kitchens. One less dish to juggle at the last minute. I was a bit worried because my gravy was darker than a typical turkey gravy because the roasted veggies may have been slightly overcooked. But this gave the gravy great flavor, a bit stronger than most perhaps but everyone loved it. Thanks Chef John!

Took a while to make but well worth the effort.  Also combined the excess homemade turkey stock with corn starch and butter to make a gluten free version for my mother in law.  Both versions were a hit!

Made this for Thanksgiving dinner at the very last minute.  I followed the recipe as is - except I did not add the whipped topping.  I loved the flavor.  It is very very good and easy to make.  I will make it again.  The only thing I didn't like is the appearance of the top of the pie with out the whipped topping.  Maybe I should have put plastic wrap on it will cooling in the fridge?  If I figure it out - I'll write a review.

For the third year in a row, made this exactly according to instructions two days before Thanksgiving and froze it.  Put in the crockpot (frozen) Thanksgiving morning.  It was full of genuine turkey flavor and the exact right consistency.  Chef John is a genius!  Yes - it was time consuming but what else was I doing on a Monday night?  Saved so much time today on Thanksgiving.  Will definitely do this every year!  UPDATE - just FYI - tried to make this in October for my niece who was visiting from Germany and wanted a traditional Thanksgiving Dinner.  You can’t find turkey wings any time of year except mid November so I used chicken wings and thighs.  Had to really doctor it up with “Better Than Bouillon” Turkey base.  Turned out just ok.  No substitute for turkey wings to get the flavor you are looking for!

This is a great recipe!! I used only two cups water along with 4 cups each of turkey and chicken stock.   Two turkey wings were just enough to render the required amount of fat.  Time consuming but worth it!!

I made this per the recipe except I used potato starch in place of flour. It was delicious, and I so loved that it was done days before I roasted that turkey. I will use this recipe again and again.

This gravy is awesome! I made it for Thanksgiving dinner tomorrow. The flavor and consistency are perfect. Was it time consuming? Yes. But while it was simmering, I was able to make two pies and get some cleaning done, so I cannot complain about the time it took to make. It will free up so much time tomorrow. My only deviation from the recipe was replacing 8 cups of the water with College Inn turkey stock. I will use this recipe for any future holiday dinners. Thanks again Chef John!

I doubled the recipe as I'm cooking for 20+ people. I also used 2/3 turkey broth and 1/3 water  based on the reviews. Took all the leftover cooked veggies and turkey meat, ran it through my nutribullet with some of the stock, and put half of the puree in with the gravy and will add the other half with additional stock into my stuffing. Overall a lot of work but the end product is delicious and it's one less think I have to worry about on Thanksgiving day. Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this exactly as written and it is amazing!  The only thing I did different was add a little poultry seasoning at the end with the other spices.  It took me a longer than 5 minutes to get the thickness I wanted at the end - maybe closer to 10.    Wonderful recipe and so glad to make it ahead of time!

We BBQ'd the turkey this year (on our Weber by cutting the bird in half. It took 2 hours for a large bird and it was awesome!) so taking off the wings and roasting them for this gravy worked out excellent. I did have to add in more flour later as I prefer my gravy  a little thicker.  TIP: I also served the gravy out of new insulated coffee carafe which kept the gravy pipping hot throughout the meal.  So much better than a gravy boat!

Just made this.  I had to use turkey thighs as my store did not have turkey wings.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.   I only ended up with 4 c. of stock after only 2 hours of simmering, so I added about a cup and a half of chicken broth I had on hand.   I do love the consistency, but it could use a little more flavor.   It's good, but not fabulous.    I intend to freeze until Thanksgiving and add turkey drippings.

This recipe was a lifesaver for a thanksgiving potluck. I used wings and neck and substituted turkey stock for water. I also added a touch of sherry. Compared to my usual gravy it seemed to have less depth but it is beyond good enough for a make ahead version. Don't skimp on carrots onions and celery in the roast which was probably my mistake. Definitely add fresh thyme if you have it. It does take time but not much effort.

Made this today in preparation for next week's Thanksgiving dinner. It is a lengthy process but oh so worth it! I tasted it before I put it in containers- so delicious! And it was, in my humble opinion, one of the smoothest and shiniest gravys I've ever seen. The only change I made was I used turkey necks and wings. The amount of water was perfect and yielded exactly 6 cups of stock.

Excellent flavor! So good to know its all done & in the freezer.  Our celebration was Sunday the 22nd and this gravy was a hit with my family! I took it out of the freezer and let it defrost in the refrigerator the night before. Just added it to my smaller crock pot and it was perfect - thank you Chef John for this keeper.

The only change I made was to use a turkey leg instead of wings. I took the meat off the bone and added it to the gravy instead of giblets. I did add poultry seasoning the leg as it cooked along with the other ingredients. I find it works just as well to do all in the stock pot and skip the roasting. It makes a lighter gravy which my family prefers.

I add a several cloves of garlic to the mirepoix, along with a few bay leaves and some mixed herbs. I then cover the mirepoix with hot stock, and place the meat joint / bird / wings / pieces on top of the mirepoix and stock. Once the meat is ready, I tip the stock and all the mirepoix into a large pot, and blitz everything with a hand held blender stick. Then sieve the blitzed liquid so that you have a smooth gravy base. You can then thicken the gravy up with a roux, corn flour or some granules. 

I find this method to be far superior as you are getting a lot more of the goodness and flavour from the vegetables.

I've been doing this for years but in the interest of shaving off some fat and calories I use turkey necks.  They have very little fat and when I roast them nicely browned with garlic , onion, celery, rosemary, thyme, sage and anise seeds the stock becomes soooooo flavorful the wing fat is not missed nor necessary.  I fry the flour in oil instead of turkey fat.  Last year I provided a gallon of turkey gravy for our church supper by roasting 8-10 turkey necks  with the above seasonings then simmering them in 1 1/2 gallons water for about 2 hours or until the necks are practically falling apart.  When the broth is adequately salted the necks are tender and deeelicious.  Because the necks are so big the meat is easy to pick off the bones and can be added to soups or casseroles and you get A LOT of meat.  My daughter and I like to sit and eat the meat right off the bones.  I usually cook 2-3 potatoes and a few carrots in the broth the last 1/2 hour and eat them with the necks.

Wonderful!  I always save the drippings from my last roast turkey (skimmed of fat and frozen) to add to my current gravy. It makes this gravy even richer. Be sure to reduce your water by the amount of drippings and don't add the drippings until the last minute so you will retain the full flavor.

I have made this for the last two years using turkey drumsticks instead of wings.. I have never been able to find wings in my grocery and the legs obviously have much more meat on them.. turns out awesome every time.

This is the first time I made this gravy.  I am so happy with the results! And I don't have to make gravy tomorrow while my guests are here.  I did add a turkey leg with the wings.  That meat came out excellent as well.  Thank you Chef John & happy Thanksgiving!

I think this is an excellent recipe and can save someone extra stress on Turkey Day. As with some other reviews I agree it can be time consuming and slightly wasteful, so I have prepared this a week prior to and combined it with a recipe for 'Turkey Wild Rice Soup' from allrecipes. I was not able to find any turkey wings or legs (I live in a small town!) so I bought a small bone-in turkey breast to use. I cooked it with the vegetables then cut the breast meat off for the soup. I used the bones for the broth and then saved the'discarded' vegetables for the soup. Both recipes turned out really delicious. Thanks for the great idea and the recipe!

This recipe is very good. When I grocery shopped this year however I could not find turkey wings in either of my grocery stores.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was awesome.  I added a little dry sherry and it made it even better.  It is definitely the way to go! EllenH

This was delicious and really eased up the time crunch before serving. I made it exactly as stated. It had an awesome flavor, color and smoothness. I will say though, that it tasted better before I froze it.  I froze it for 5 days and then thawed it out, heated and served it. Some of the flavor seemed to get lost, which is the only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5. I will most definitely keep this and use it again, I'll just be sure to make it only a day ahead of time so I do not have to freeze.

What a relief to have this done ahead of time. For 10 people I should've doubled the recipe.  The gravy was bland and pale at first, so I used an immersion blender and added some of the vegetables and a little meat back in.  Then it was tasty so I guess that means I should have cooked the stock longer.

This is outstanding! Definitely time consuming but very worth it.  This will be a staple in my home!  Couldn't find plain wings so I ended up using smoked turkey wings and it is delicious!

I grew up with jar gravy, and have never been a gravy person. But I tried this last year and it was fantastic. I didn't want to buy extra wings so I just used the neck. I also ended up using pan drippings day of instead of make-ahead (having made the broth ahead and having messed up getting those drippings). Making again this year so family can try. I also used it to make turkey pot pie; tossed carrots, peas, and leftover turkey in the gravy and baked in pie crust. It was amazing.

What I like about John's recipe the most is the time-saving advice.  I learned a little bit more about making gravy that I can incorporate into my everyday gravy.  The video was most helpful.  I did modify it on the first go by using two cartons of chicken broth instead of water.  I also added a little sherry cooking wine. Garlic salt I find to be a little tastier than plain salt, and added a few more cloves of garlic in the stock.  The house smelled divine when it was cooking. On the day that I need the gravy, I will add some drippings for a little extra boost in flavor.

Just finished making this gravy!  Gravy has always been a down fall for me, not this year.  Tasting this gravy, it was delicious.  I may tweak it in the future, but I felt like a good clean gravy this year.  I am happy I won't have to stress over gravy this year.  Only thing I has to do was add chicken broth, because I did not have 6 cups of broth when I strained the pot.  But no worries I had organic low sodium chicken broth.  Thank you Chef John.

We always deep fry our turkey so there are never any drippings to make a good gravy. Just finished making this gravy and it is out of this world.  It is worth the time and effort to make this. I am thrilled to have finally gotten a recipe like this that I can make ahead and prepare it when I want and not have to worry about it on Thanksgiving Day.  Hurray!!! I am thankful for you Chef John!

Just made Chef John's gravey for this Thanksgiving and it is amazing!  Wish I had found it years ago!  I did add some of the meat from the wings back into the gravy as I like it little meaty.

Chef John, you are my hero.  All these years I've been cooking the turkey giblets during the day to use with the broth and slaving over the hot stove at the last minute making my giblet gravy.  I never thought of cooking inexpensive turkey parts for the fat content. What a brilliant idea and one I will always use. Thanks and Happy Thanksgiving to you all!

Ok, read the reviews and decided to take the chance….Wow, it's great and so easy.   Other than having to stick around the kitchen to keep an eye on things it's not much work.   I used 4 wings, didn't think 2 would be enough plus mine looked smaller than chef's video wings.   Added more carrot/onion but other than that followed the recipe, didn't use the thyme because I didn't have any fresh.

My batch reduced down to 5 cups, despite a low simmer, so I added a cup of water to take it back up to 6.   Definitely a keeper & I have sent it on to some other friends so they can try it as well.

This is a very good recipe. I agree it was a little time consuming but it was well worth it. The only thing I will change next time is to cook the flour in oil a little longer. Also, I added small amount of horseradish sauce at the end (only because I like a stronger test). This recipe is a keeper. I recommend to watch the move as well.

I am making it today 11/21/12. Made the wing stock last weekend. It turned out so great I simmered it for as long time and got 4 cups of beautiful looking and tasting gravy. I am so freaking excited!!!! My only problem now is how do I go about re-heating tomorrow without ruining it??? I want to add turkey drippings also... Well at least I have great tasting gravy this year. Will do this all the time now. I love you Chef John!!! Thanks so much for your videos and recipes!
