Very good! It had excellent flavor. The only thing I would do differently is add more sauce. A brown rice would have been wonderful with this meal.

Easy to throw together and much tastier than I expected.  I think next time I'll add some Italian seasoning blend, but other than that, perfect as written.

Absolutely a win-win recipe, the ingredients are inexpensive and there's very little prep-time needed for this meal. I'm more akin to spicier and bolder flavors, but the "tomato and basil" sauce with the specified vegetables work well. If you want a bolder taste, I recommend adding whatever spice fits the taste of your palate.

This is a fine dish.  I agree with others that more sauce is better.  I used two jars and still wasn't satisfied.  Also, the peppers and onions were still crunchy, so if you are used to them being soft, saute them first.  Kids liked this just fine, husband liked it very much.  Easy and hearty.

a bit salty, could have used more add-ins, but the chicken was super tender and delicious.

I thought this was very simple and very flavorful.  I didn't even use the recommended sauce, whatever I had in my cupboard.  I think I will add more garlic next time. My 4 year old even liked it!!

this recipe is not worth it.  i'm a pretty good cook and followed the recipe to the letter. something about it just tasted off.  i will say, the chicken was nice and tender, i shredded it up as it cooked.  if you want chicken cacciatore, make it traditionally.

This was a nice, easy recipe. I threw everything in my slow cooker when I was home at lunch (with some additional seasonings), didn't even have time to thaw out my chicken breasts. When I got home 6 hours later, I cooked some rice to go with it, and the sauce and chicken were perfect!

I added a few more spices to the mix, but all in all this is a simple, comfortable and flavorful dish. I will certainly be making it again.

This was very tasty and I put it in my slow cooker on low for about 8 hours. I followed the recipe and added some seasoning salt, parsley, and oregano for more flavor for the chicken. Was very flavorful and the chicken was tender as always from the slow cooker.

Had to add a bit of mild salsa to compensate for the lack of sauce but just a bit.  Normally I would serve a dish like this with salad but Mother cannot eat uncooked vegetables anymore unfortunately.  So threw in some pre-shredded carrots and all was well.  : )

I found this recipe just "alright." Though it was super easy, there was something lacking in the flavor department. Won't be making again.

SO delicious.  I added italian seasonings, fresh ground pepper and a LARGE handful of fresh basil, and used 2 jars of sauce to serve over noodles or rice.  I'll probably freeze any leftover sauce for something else!  Mine was done after only 5 hours on low.

Very good, different dish. I don't think you need 24 oz of past sauce, I felt it made it a little soupy, while it still had an excellent flavor. Next time I may hold half the peppers, onions and mushrooms to give the dish a little more crunch. In order for the chicken to cook, the vegetables can be a little mushy.! And, it need salt to bring out and meld the flavors. With a little tweeking, it could be a 5 star!
