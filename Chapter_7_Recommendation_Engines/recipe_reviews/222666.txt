This is my recipe. It should be 1 Tbsp GROUND coriander (NOT THE WHOLE SEEDS!). If you don't have red chile powder (from an Indian grocery store), you can sub cayenne pepper. If you don't have ginger garlic paste, just use equal parts fresh ginger & garlic and mash it up.  After I add the water, I cover the pot to allow the vegetables to steam.  I check it occasionally, stir and add more water as needed.  Once the vegetables are cooked, I open the lid to let the water cook off.  Cabbage takes a while.  You can also use cauliflower & potato (instead of cabbage & potato).  You don't want too much potato in there.  I use 1-2 small ones.  One last note - I serve this with jeera rice and/or pita bread.  To make jeera rice - Heat about 1 Tbsp oil in a pan.  When hot, add 1/2 tsp cumin seeds, fry for a minute.  Add 1 cup of basmati rice.  Stir to coat and let it fry for a minute or 2.  Add 2 cups of water and 1/2 tsp salt. When the water boils, cut it down to low and cook, covered for 15-20 minutes.  Enjoy!  This is traditionally served with dahl (lentils) for protein.

This didn't look quite like I expected but it tasted good and was very "moreish". I found I needed to add a bit more water (perhaps up to a cup) and turn the heat down to low once it was simmering. My husband did find the coriander seeds a little bitter.

Great Indian flavor. This is a nice foundation you can substitute different vegetables.

I did a double (full head) so I doubled most stuff.  I didn't have potatoes.  I added a large onion.  I added some heat to make it more like the restaurant where I usually get it.  I would make it again.

Served this with home made chapatis. Was a tasty dinner, and not too spicy for my picky eaters.

This was really quite delicious. I added cauliflower and onion to this, but otherwise made it as stated, and served it with garlic basmati rice and tofu, and boy does this a hearty meal make! The cilantro is a lovely touch, and while the favors all worked great together, next time I will be adding more chile powder and coriander (personal taste). It's a very easy dish to prepare too if your new to Indian cooking  but are still looking for an authentic dish. Makes excellent leftovers!
