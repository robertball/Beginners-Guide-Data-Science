Very good waffles.  I used only about 4T butter and added a teaspoon of vanilla and they tasted great.  My 4 year old and wife both gave the thumbs up.  As a bonus, I let the leftovers cool, then froze them.  Just pop in the microwave and they make a nice school day breakfast.

These are really good!  They had a great texture, crispy outside and fluffy inside, even though I made them 100% whole grain.  Used old-fashioned rolled oats, 1 cup whole grain oat flour, and 1/2 cup whole wheat pastry flour.  I cut the butter down to 4 TSP. and used skim milk, and half the sugar (since I knew we'd put syrup on them anyway).  My kids loved them too.  They made a delicious, filling Saturday breakfast along with some bacon.

5 stars for sure! Everyone in my house said they were the best waffles they've ever had. I used 1 cup white flour, 1/2 cup wheat flour, 3/4 cup oatmeal and 1/4 flaxseed mill. We'll be making these again and again. I'll be doubling the recipe from now on so we'll have plenty of leftovers for school day breakfasts.

Great recipe! My husband, who normally does not like waffles or pancakes, loved them - and so did our 1-year old son. I keep them frozen and just pop one in the toaster as a good snack. Instead of all white flour, I used 3/4 cup whole wheat flour and 3/4 white flour - just to make them a little more healthy.

I made them exactly as written, and they came out just a little bit thick and heavy. I might add a bit more milk next time to thin the batter just a touch. My husband loved them. He said they weren't just sugar-coated puffed air like most waffles. These were heavy and dense and filling, and the taste was good. We like the oats. Next time we might sub in half whole wheat flour to get more whole grains in. The kids loved them too.

Excellent! These tasted healthy and filling, but still delicious-- not always an easy feat. The second time I made these, I subbed 1/2 cup of wheat bran for flour, and 1/4 cup of milled flax seed for oats. Added 1 tsp. of vanilla and halved the sugar, and we liked it even better. Thanks!

I made these last night for dinner. They were good, nice and fluffy. I did make just a couple changes. I used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup all purpose, old fashioned oats, no cinnamon because I was out, and a little less butter. I would have liked it if they were crispier on the outside. Next time I might use less whole wheat flour and more all purpose and see if that helps.

These cooked up light and fluffy, my family really enjoyed them.  I used buttermilk instead of plain milk and I used oat bran in place of the rolled oats.  I also had to add an extra 1/4 c. of buttermilk to thin the batter a  little.   There is no amount of brown sugar listed in the ingredient list so I  added 1/4 c. (1/2 c. when doubled) I doubled the recipe for my big crew.

Now these are my kind of waffles. Oatmeal and cinnamon - yum! They are crisp on the outside and a little chewy on the inside from the oats. They stay crisp too, even after pouring on syrup. It is a thick batter and I ended up adding a little more milk, but they turned out great. As always, I recommend using an aluminum-free baking powder for waffles and pancakes.

Wonderful!  Also great subbing wheat flour for part of it.  We've also tried adding blueberries or chocolate chips, and it's just great!  I love that these waffles stay crisp - other recipes seem to get soggy a couple minutes after they're out of the waffle iron, but these stay nice!

Everyone loved it!  Cooked nice and golden crisp. I cut butter back from 6 tbs to 4 and cut brown sugar in half.  I added a little extra milk.  I used rice milk instead. I always to that in my baking.  I am going to try using some wheat flour next time.

Pretty tasty.  I halved the recipe and used whole grain wheat flour.  Next time I'll be sure to get quick cooking oats (vs. the old fashion ones I used), since they stayed a bit hard. Thanks for sharing.

Tasty and hearty! Good way for me to get my husband to eat fiber. Needs more cinnamon and vanilla. We also included chopped pecans.

Made these exactly as written.  They were just "okay."  For us, there was way too much cinnamon and I would have to tweak the recipe quite a bit to give it five stars.

Last time I home-made waffles they were ok.  We had leftovers which I ate for the next few days.  This time, we devoured them all in one sitting!  They were soooo good!

These were so good and very hearty. Instead of using all-purpose flour I used white whole wheat flour to make them 100% whole grain. I added a 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract to the batter and that gave them a really nice flavor. I topped the waffles with lots of butter and pure maple syrup to make the perfect fall breakfast. One thing we really liked about these waffles is that you don't feel as guilty as eating them as all white flour waffles since they are full of much better for you whole grains. Thanks for the great and very easy recipe!

The addition of the cinnamon was perfect.  I slightly chopped the oatmeal in the blender, then soaked them in the milk over half an hour to soften the oats.  I topped the waffles with strawberries because that is what I had on hand, but this would be a perfect fall breakfast served with “Sauteed Apples”, a fabulous recipe - http://allrecipes.com/recipe/sauteed-apples/reviews.aspx.  These were wonderful and I’ll be making these often during apple picking season.

Oh wow these were delicious! I doubled the brown sugar though. The batter is thick, it almost looks like cooked oatmeal, but it cooks up beautifully in the waffle maker. We had these with warm real maple syrup. Will definitely make these again, great for a Sunday breakfast!

The cinnamon fights with the maple syrup taste, so I Cannot vote it better than a Bisquick waffle, but the oatmeal and overall waffle were good.

We love this recipe. I changed it up a bit and reduced the butter to 4 T and replaced all-purpose flour with whole wheat flour and they came out great. We also add more spices like nutmeg, ginger, allspice, cloves. We sometimes add ground flaxseed for the Omega-3.

I "ground" the oats down to a fine consistancy (think similar to whole wheat flour) before I used it in this recipe. I didn't realize until after I'd added the oatmeal to the combined wet ingredients that I'd flip-flopped the amounts of the oatmeal and the flour. No big deal, they still turned out fabulous. The smell of these cooking was insane. My family LOVED them. NOTE: The recipe does not tell you to let the batter sit five-ten minutes to allow time for the oats to soak up some of the additional liquid. You must do this or it will not be as thick as it needs to be. This recipe made eight full waffles. For us, this served four.

These were really good! I have never had waffles with oatmeal in them. They smelled good to with the cinnamon. I was able to get 4 large waffles out of the batter, but honestly 1/2 of one is filling with a side of bacon. I served it with pure maple syrup and maple flavor bacon. Delicious! TY

4.5 stars:
This healthy waffle recipe makes 5 round belgian waffles. I used freshly chopped walnuts sprinkled over batter before baking then topped with thin slices of banana & strawberry. Topped with drizzle of real maple syrup, a dollop of whipped cream and whole blueberries. Undercook remainders and freeze. Cut in half to put in toaster for a quick, healthy 2 minute breakfast. A new favorite here!

I completely enjoyed this recipe! I made a minor adjustment, I didn't have quick cooking oats, so with the old fashioned oats, I soaked the 1 cup oats with 1 cup milk and 1 teaspoon vanilla for about 10 minutes. Then using the rest of the half cup milk, followed the recipe as is. So in other words, the recipe called for 1 1/2 cup milk, the one cup I used soak the oats and the rest was used in the recipe, no more, no less. I used a large round waffle iron and it made 4 large waffles with these ingredients. It was delicious!

This is our go to waffle recipe now. It is really good made with our gluten free flour recipe. The oats give it a hearty boost that is sometimes missing from when using the light rice flours.

Delicious! I also tried using apple sauce instead of butter and they came out great, fluffy and yummy.

5* for ease of preparation; 4* for taste; 3* for consistency - which may probably just be something you have to get used to.  We used a belgium waffle iron which made them thicker, so perhaps that's a contributing factor to the texture thing as well.  As others have mentioned, they do have an 'oatmeal cookie' type of taste.  Only change was to add splash of vanilla.  While these weren't knock your socks off great, they are *good*.  For those trying to incorporate more fiber or oats into their daily menu, I'd highly recommend.

I would have given this recipe 5 stars if I didn't have to altar it at all. The taste was superb though! I added 2 tsp of vanilla, sorry, I have have to have vanilla in waffles and the mix was far too thick. I added another 1/2 cup of milk and they cooked up nicely. I used whole wheat white flour also.

Yummy yum yum! I only use old fashioned oat meal so that's what I used. The oatmeal didn't have time to soften. I put the batter in the frig to use the next day. Wow! Was it excellent then because the oats had a chance to soften up. This weekend, I made the batter Friday night and put it in the frig to use Saturday and Sunday morning. It was so good. That's what I will be doing from now on. It's so quick to throw it together the night before and it was so creamy and nice the next morning. I did add a bit more milk like other reviewers suggested. The waffles are hearty but not too heavy and rich, but not too rich.  I have been looking for a waffle recipe that I liked for quite a while. This one is the one I've been searching for. Thanks Marna.

This recipe is perfect.  The waffles are a great texture and have amazing flavor.  You can add berries to the mix for a special treat.  I freeze uneaten waffles then heat them in the toaster for a quick breakfast during the week.  Delicious!

These waffles are so AMAZING that I can't even wait until I'm done eating them to rate them! They are the BEST waffles I have ever had. Followed the recipe exactly. Light & fluffy inside, slight golden crisp to the outside. Topped with maple syrup, fresh raspberries, and a sprinkle of powdered sugar. TO DIE FOR! Will never use Bisquik or any other recipe ever again!

Wow! Only added a splash of vanilla. These were much heartier than typical waffles, but still had enough sweetness to fill that craving. They tasted amazing with fresh strawberries. I doubled the batter and froze half, so I hope they are just as good in the toaster.

I was looking for a healthy waffle recipe and decided to try this one, using white wheat flour instead of all-purpose and adding vanilla.  They were a bit heavy but very, very filling.  I didn't feel hungry again for hours.  I will make them again.

Oatmeal Waffles Haiku: "Hearty, yet fluffy. Nice texture, and a great taste. Love the cinnamon!" Followed recipe to the letter and was pleasantly surprised that these waffles weren't heavy and dense. Just as with a bowl of oatmeal, these waffles are easily complimented by just about any type of fruit topping, making them a fine choice for different weekend breakfast styles. Thanks for a great recipe Marna!

Great tasting, easy to make. I just threw everything in the bowl in order, mixed enough to have an even consistency, then poured into the waffle iron. I didn't  have butter so I subbed 1/4 cup sunflower oil. They are nice and moist thanks to the oatmeal, but crispy outside.

WONDERFUL!  I made these yesterday in our thin waffle iron.  I served them with applesauce instead of syrup and they were a big hit.  I also used oatmeal with extra added fiber, so they are better for you.  We had them again this morning.  The better half asked me to make a double batch to keep in the freezer to take to work.  They are SO filling.  This is a keeper.

Replaced the butter with applesauce. The waffles are hearty and filling, but very tasty.  Applesauce keeps them moist, even when reheated.  Excellent!!

These were wonderful - I've finally found my go-to-recipe for waffles.  The only thing I changed was sub. 1/2 cup whole wheat flour for 1/2 cup of the all-purpose (just enough to be a little healthier but not enough for my picky eater to notice). And a little extra cinnamon because I love it.

Made them once as shown; that's the rating I gave. Second time added about 1/3 c fine chopped walnuts, and 1/2 c dried cranberries; and used 1/2 c oat flour for 1/2 c of the regular flour. I'd give that a 5 star rating as it had more pizzaz. Either way, it's an easy and delicious alternative to the norm.

These were really good.  I didn't have quick cooking oats, so I boiled the milk and threw a cup of old fashioned oats in.  I ended up having to add more milk though to get the right texture.  I used 2TBSP butter and 2TBSP canola oil.  Also, I wanted it to be more like oatmeal raisin cookies, so I added raisins and butterscotch chips.  The chips kind of made a mess, so next time I think I'll throw them on top after they comeout of the waffle iron.  Will def make again!

These are awesome! I made them gluten free for a baby shower recently. I used Pamela's Gluten Free pancake mix in place of the flour. Other than that, I made the recipe exactly as shown and several people asked for the recipe. This is a keeper, thanks for sharing the recipe!

I've tried these a few times.  They turned out best when I used Canola oil in place of the butter.  The trouble with the butter is that you MUST insure that the milk and egg mixture is at room temp or warm before adding the melted butter.  if not, the butter hardens because it comes in contact with the cold milk/eggs.  I would simply use oil instead.

These were really good.  I added a tsp of vanilla.  The batter was a bit thick, which is to be expected I'm sure.  I added a bit of water.  This will probably be our default waffle recipe.  That's for posting it!

I made these for family and no one liked them except for me. There was definitely a different consistency to these. They tasted healthy and maybe that's why my guests and family didn't care for them.

Even though I already added some more salt, I thought these to be too bland. So it's an okay recipe, but I will be looking for another better one.

These were pretty good. I've made a few different waffle recipes in the last few years and these stood out a bit. The oats added a little heartiness, and the hint of cinnamon is different too. I made this recipe exactly as written, and it yielded 7 waffles. I didn't, however, "top with fresh fruit and yogurt" - just the usual real maple syrup.

Will probably use more cinnamon next time. Added a fair splash of vanilla and followed someone else's suggestion to soak the (old-fashioned) oats in the milk while prepping all the other ingredients. Used vanilla soymilk and Ener-G egg replacer (egg allergy), replaced half the butter (Smart Balance) with applesauce, and used .5 cup white wheat flour and 1 cup white all-purpose. Whipped the "eggs" and folded them in at the end--kept the waffles from being too dense. Think this might have become our new favorite waffle recipe!

Love these waffles.  They are the best we've ever made.  I've discovered a few changes that work for us.  We add 2 cups of milk so the batter isn't so dry,  I add an extra egg for protein and omega 3, and a tsp of vanilla for flavour.  I substitute in 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour and I just guess on the butter adding less than 6 tbsp.

It is no doubt better than the version I tweaked out of it. I used the blender to process old fashioned oats, changed the sugar to splenda, and cut the recipe in half. I gave it 4 stars but my version would get no more than 3 as it was very bland and flavorless. Would vanilla perk it up for me? I may try this again as I'm always looking for oatmeal recipes and have really wanted to find success with oatmeal waffles.
I use a 7 1/2 inch waffle iron and half the original recipe only gave me 2 unfilled waffles. (They don't spread much after pouring.) I think the full recipe would only give me 3 not 6 waffles.
This definitely is healthy though.

Love these! We topped them with reall maple syrup and they were out of this world. The flavors of cinnamon and maple combined with the crispy oats were amazing. We used fresh ground wheat flour and they were still delicious. I also whipped the egg whites separately and folded them in at the end. Definitely a keeper!

Thatsa lotta butter! It can probably be cut back. I substituted one packet of maple and brown sugar instant oatmeal and omitted the rolled oats, sugar and cinnamon. It made perfectly fine waffles. If you want it sweeter or crunchier, you could probably add a second packet.

I know people get annoyed when a reviewer rates the recipe and then makes a bunch of changes but I did make some changes and I'm still reviewing the recipe so people know that the base recipe is excellent and can withstand modifications without being ruined and IMO that is what makes it a 5 star recipe.  These were healthy and delicious and I think the proportion of wet to dry ingredients was perfect.  For my mods, I subbed 1 cup regular & 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, 3/4 cup coconut milk & 3/4 cup 2% regular milk and I added about a tsp of real vanilla extract and the zest of one lemon.  I will be making these over and over again!

My husband said these are the best waffles he's had (and we really like waffles!). I think I even forgot the baking powder, but they turned out great anyway! I also used only half the butter. We have a Belgium waffle maker and this made four waffles. I had to double the recipe for our family. The kids loved them as well. Very hearty, filling, and delicious. I expect to start making these about once a month.

My husband declared these "the best textured waffles ever!", and they tasted super yummy!  I made a couple small changes - used 1/2 c. whole wheat flour and 1 c. white flour, added 1 tbsp. vanilla extract, and reduced the margarine to 4 tbsp.  Otherwise the perfect, quick and easy waffle recipe that I've been looking for!

Wow!! Loved them! All 4 people in my family gobbled them up, and they sure smell unbelievably good when they're cooking.
The only thing I did differently was use rice milk instead of regular milk because of my son's allergy. We try not to do too much dairy in one meal for him. These waffles were so good my hubby and daughter had no clue that I used rice milk instead. This is the only waffle recipe I'll need, love it that much.

Yum! Used 1/2 cup all-purpose flour, 1/2 cup whole-wheat, and 1/2 cup wheat germ. Replaced the butter with 3T apple sauce and 2T vegetable oil. These were magnificent. Made 3 big waffles for me.

Very nice flavor. I added orange zest, and lessened milk by a couple Tbsp for  a couple of Tbsp of orange juice. I also added cranberry craisins. With these additions, it's a 5 out of 5!

I make these for my family Sunday mornings before church, and they are stellar! They are more nutritious than any other waffle we make, and the cinnamon makes them tasty! Don't change a thing--this recipe is GREAT!

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe!  The oatmeal makes the waffles heartier than a traditional "baking mix" waffle.  Thanks for sharing.

Awsome waffles we just thought there was a bit too much cinnamon so will use less next time we make them.  My boys had blueberries in one batch and chocolate chips in another and they both liked them but both said too much cinnamon.  We will definitely make these again

good, love it that u can freeze it and even though it have oat it doesn't taste too much of an oat. my first success waffle, the only negative that it should eaten right after it done so it still crispy.

Light and Fluffy with a crunchy crust! Delicious!  I doubled the recipe so I would have enough to freeze for next weekend.  I added a tbs more brown sugar, used half white flour and half wheat flour and added about 1/4c of toasted wheat germ.  These were the type of waffles that you don't even have to add anything to the top...you can eat them plain and they still have a great taste!! My husband said that they were very filling but not a dense waffle and they actually have flavor!  I think the amount of cinnamon was great in these!  My one year old LOVED them!  What a nice change from the regular waffles...will make all the time now!

These were reasonably tasty. I think I just didn't care for the texture the oatmeal gave, although I like that in pancakes. Probably when it comes to waffles I'm comparing them to those dreadful frozen ones I grew up eating, which have no texture and lots of sugar. Your crispiness will be affected by 2 factors. #1 If you reduce the fat, they'll be less crisp. Period. Guaranteed. Using oil (whatever kind) will work in place of the butter, if you decide you can't do butter. #2 Sitting around waiting will make them less crisp to the point of being soggy if they wait long enough. The heat they let off will touch the other waffles, or themselves, and soften them up. Neither of these are a fault of the recipe. My waffle iron (a Sunbeam which makes square, thickish waffles) made 10 of these waffles. Thanks for the recipe, I may use it again playing around with perhaps flavored instant oatmeal packets instead of the canister kind, as I think their texture is even squishier (which I would like in this).

These were really good.  The batter was very, very thick.  It took about 1 cup of batter to make a belgium waffle.  We added a bit more milk and made pancakes for the waffle hater in the family.  They also came out great.  Thanks for sharing.

I thought these waffles were very good and hearty. I added a grated apple to the batter. My husband never likes anything different and commented "What's wrong with the ones you made before" meaning "Mom's Best Waffles" which are good too. I told him I wanted a change. I will make these oatmeal waffles for myself and freeze the extras next time.

My family loved this recipe! I made a few changes. I used 1 cup all purpose flour and 1/2 cup wheat flour. I used rolled oats and reduced it to 3/4 cup. I also reduced the butter to 4 T. They were quick and delicious!

Awesome!  These waffles really stuck with me through my busy morning!  They tasted great!  I made one change and used Land O Lakes Light butter instead of regular butter.  I would make these again and again.  They froze well too!

O.K. So I bought a waffle iron a couple of days ago. This is the second recipe I tried, but I wanted it to pack even more of a nutritional punch, and I also wanted to try to do waffles the way Grandma does them - with walnuts... and my daughter wanted bananas with her walnuts, so here's what I came up with:

I used 3/4 c. all-purpose and 3/4 c. whole wheat flours.
I sent my oats through the food processor because they weren't quick-cooking - I had thick-rolled organic oats.
I also sent 1/4 c. toasted flax seed through the food processor and added to my dry ingredients.
I added 1/4 c. wheat germ.
I increased the cinnamon to 3/4 t and added 1/4 t nutmeg.
I used a total of 3 T sucanat.
I added 2 mashed bananas to the wet ingredients.
I increased the milk by about 1/4 c. as, with my other additions, the batter was on the thick side.
I substituted 6 T Stonyfield Farms lowfat Banilla yogurt for the butter.
I separated my eggs, whipped the whites, then folded them in after I mixed the wet with the dry ingredients.
Prior to pouring the batter into the waffle iron, I sprinkled the iron with coarsely chopped roasted walnuts.

All I can say is YUM! Of course it's not your traditional waffle - it is very hardy - but it worked out really well.

I apologize for rating and reviewing when I made so many changes, but I wanted to share.

Enjoy!

These were good, and pretty crisp straight out of the waffle iron, but they became a little tough as they cooled.  A nice hearty breakfast, though!

YUMMY!!  Made these this morning for breakfast with fresh melong and strawberries on the side and they were very filling with great flavour.  Used a little more than 3/4 c whole wheat flour and just under 3/4 c white.  Reduced butter to about 2 tbsp, got about 8 waffles in my waffle maker.  My almost 3 yr old and almost 5 yr old boys loved them too!!

We both liked these as a change from ordinary waffles.  The slightly sweet taste means they can be eaten without syrup and with only a little butter or some fruit.  I found that the automatic setting on my waffle iron beeped before the waffles were browned much, so I gave them a little more time to make the outside crisper.  These are not a light, crisp waffle as ones made with the usual ingredients are--not that that's bad, just a comment so others will know.  I liked the little bit of crunch the oatmeal gave them.  Would definitely make again.

I made this recipe this morning and it was pretty good. A bit more grainy than my usual waffles, but that's to be expected with oats in them. I did make a couple of changes. I used 1 cup AP flour and 1/2 cup white whole wheat flour. I also added 1 tsp vanilla flavoring. Besides that, I made it just as the recipe called for.

Yum! I usually use another recipe from this site and we love it. These are delicious as well and a lot more  hearty, substantial and filling. A winner! I used buttermilk and it worked well. Next time I will increase the brown sugar slightly and add some vanilla for a bit more flavor, as my little one likes  to eat his waffles without syrup. I ate mine with sliced bananas and maple syrup...so good!

Excellent! Great texture--crispy outside, soft inside. I doubled the recipe (except for the salt) and used 2 cups vanilla milk and 1 cup skim milk. I did not need to add additional liquid. Definitely a go-to recipe.

These waffles are one of my families favorites. However, they aren't as good in the belgian waffle maker.

To make these even healthier I replaced butter with olive oil and added 2 T flax meal.  They were good and hearty. Seems like they needed something though.  Will make again.

to make these gluten-free I used "Carole's Sorghum blend" (you can find the recipe on-line) and added 1 tsp vanilla, and doubled the vanilla. I didn't add any xanthan gum and they turned out perfect.  Great!!  I freeze the leftovers and after I thaw them out I pop them in the toaster on 2 and they get crunchy again!!

These waffles are really good!  My batter was fairly thick and I was worried that they wouldn't cook through, but they turned out fantastically!  I had to use a spatula to spread the batter to the edges of the waffle maker and cooked until I saw no more steam coming from the iron.  My only changes were that I used buttermilk in lieu of milk and I added a teaspoon of vanilla to the batter.  These were loved by all in my family tonight!  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Marna Heitz!

These are great! I made them exactly as written and they turned out crunchy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. The batter gets very thick and bubbly but it turns out fine.

These were great, though we only got four instead of six.  I think I would add vanilla next time, they seemed to be lacking something, but otherwise they tasted great and were more filling than 'regular' waffles.

No longer need to buy Costco's pancake mix for our Sunday morn waffles - cooking for 7 so i 2x the ingredients. As the other reviewers stated - LESS BUTTER FOR SURE! add a tsp of vanilla into the wet ingredients. GRIND THE WHOLE OATS in your blender & BLEND the wet ingredients in your blender, add a teaspoon of vanilla to the wet ingredients. 2)  less butter (8 tbs for double ingredients). GET A CUP OF WATER in the batter - 1 less egg + less milk. After the kids waffle are done i like to add some finely chopped walnut and 1/2 mashed banana (not too much banana - just give the taste a sweet smell taste). Enjoy. Make sure to purchase your waffle irons @ bedbathandbeyond - they'll replace free of charge no matter how many years later the machine finally wore out.

These are really good waffles.  I used 'one-minute' oats... These are heavier than your average waffle.  One recipe easily feeds 3-4 people, or I've doubled it and frozen some for weekday mornings - just heat in the toaster!

This recipe is great and can be altered to suit your dietary needs!  

I made these waffles this morning in my 7 inch Oster Belgian Waffle Maker.  I wanted something relatively healthy.  They were a hit with the family and my 9 year old daughter loved them and ate hers without any toppings!  

I did do a few things differently but nothing that really made a huge impact in the outcome of the actual waffle.  I accidently measured and added 1 teaspoon of baking powder instead of a tablespoon, upon that error I tossed in an extra teaspoon and they turned out fine, nice and fluffy!  I cut the butter back to 2T because who needs all that fat?!  I added a tablespoon of vanilla extract, 1 tablespoon of cinnamon and used old fashioned oats because it's what we had.  

Overall these were perfect and would be wonderful with fresh fruit.  We only had syrup at the time and that worked fine and kept things simple.  It made 5 round waffles in the 7 inch waffle maker.  The best way to describe them when they are done, they remind me a bit of french toast crossed with a waffle.  The texture was great!!

This will find it's way into our weekend breakfast rotation and leftovers can be used for weekday morning breakfasts, just pop them in a toaster!

Absolutely Wonderful. Almost had an oatmeal cookie taste to it. I used old-fashioned oats and it came out fine. I also used light margarine and added 1/2 tsp vanilla and whole wheat flour instead of all purpose. Very Very filling. I could barely eat one waffle. YUM!

Added pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon, used agave  instead of brown sugar (didn't have any.). Very good and hearty, will  use as my go to waffle recipe.

This was yummy good!  I topped it with peach yogurt before serving.
The only thing I did different was added 1/4 tsp more cinnamon.  Next time I am going to add 1/4t vanilla like another poster suggests.
My 2 year old twins both asked for seconds.  
definitely a keeper.

These were delicious.  So much quicker than some other waffle recipes.  They cooked up in our Belgium waffle maker perfectly.  Coooked exactly as written except for the addition of 1t of vanilla and upping the cinnamon to 1t (family taste preference).  Very filling and the whole family loved them.  We topped them with a homemade syrup made with sliced apples cooked in water, sugar, brown sugar and cinnamon.  Perfect fall comfort Sunday brunch!

I thought that the waffles were very heavy and not very sweet. I was worried my kids wouldn't eat it, but they both loved it! My youngest said she wanted to eat them every day. I think they are better when not too crispy. When they get crispy they are tough and hard to eat. Next time I would add more cinnamon and try it with buttermilk.

I was looking for something quick and easy for dinner one night and ran across this recipe.  It turned out great, my kids and husband loved them.  Especially with whipped cream and fruit for the topping.  Will be keeping this one in my recipe book.

These were absolutely fabulous!  Needed to add 1/4 cup extra flour, but that was the only change.  Served with toasted pecans, sliced bananas, dusting of powdered sugar and lite syrup. Yumm!!  My dad said they were better than anything you could get in a restaurant.

These are awesome! I easily converted them to be gluten-free by using Pamela's pancake/baking mix (baking powder is already in it - so omit extra). Fabulous!!!

I grew up in a waffle-crazy home where the waffle iron was never put away.  My boyfriend is from the South where they eat them in a variety of ways.  I used organic rolled oats and they turned out heartier than w/the quick cooking,  with more oat flavor.  I sometimes add bits of cooked bacon & some drippings.  They're sturdy enough to pack in a snack bag too.  Great recipe!

These were really good!  More of a rustic waffle, they made me think of something we would eat while camping.  The oats added a wonderful texture.  I only had whole wheat white flour on hand, and once I started putting ingredients together realized I had no baking powder!  Decided to press on without it thinking they'd be a flop, but they held up perfectly and were delicious!

I followed others' recommendation of reducing the butter.  I thought they were pretty good, though if I make them again I think I might soak the oatmeal in the milk prior to adding it all to the batter.

Very easy and tasty. 10 year old son loved them and said he liked these better than the basic waffle. I'm happy with the added nutrients the oats bring. Will definitely make again.

Doubled the recipe so we could have leftovers to freeze as an easy breakfast during school days for the kids.  I powderized half of the oats in a coffee grinder so my kids a). didn't realize they were eating healthy and b). weren't put off by the texture.  I did let the waffles sit for about 30 min before cooking so that the oats softened up and everything kind of melded together.  These were a wonderful, hearty, extremely filling waffle.  We will definitely be making these again.

This is a good basic recipe. I changed the ap flour to ww and the milk to buttermilk and added blueberries. I thought that it tasted a bit like the powder. Next time I'll change the powder to a tsp and add a tsp of soda. Also I did the recipe by 1 1/2 and it made 12 large waffles.

Excellent!  Thanks!  I did make a few small alterations to make it even healthier and they worked great.  Used 1 cup whole wheat flour, 1/2 cup white.  Threw in a few tablespoons of Flax Seed.  Threw in a handful of fresh raspberries, cut up.  We loved this and will make again!

Wow!  I have been trying recipes for pancakes and waffles for a few months now and these are the best we've had!  And of course I love the oatmeal instead of all the flour.  Thanks for sharing, we'll be using this one again!

Great! Extremely picky 7 year old loves these waffles.  I am made this many times, using 1/2 cup wheat flour, 1 cup white flour and 1/4 cup wheat germ in addition to the 1 cup of oats.  Doesn't taste healthy.  I think the secret is the 6 tablespoons of butter.

Very yummy.  My husband and children ate them up and asked for more, even though they're healthy!!  I subsituted whole wheat flour for half of the all purpose and used flax seed meal instead of eggs.  Mmmm, definitely will be making these again.

These waffles were so good.  My kids are pancake snobs and will only eat sourdough pancakes, but they likes these waffles.  I loved the oatmeal in them and the texture it gave.  We do have allergies so I used rice milk, and for the eggs, one flax egg and one powdered egg replacer.  I was so excited that they worked out.  You never know when you have to replace eggs, but it worked out great.  Thank you, we will be having these often.

What a great recipe - we really liked the nutty flavour from the oatmeal. While we were eating the waffles, I remembered I had left the melted butter in the microwave, so I made the recipe without any of this added fat, and they were still delicious (I even used skim milk). I served the waffles with vanilla yogurt and sliced banana (although my son had them with maple syrup, which he said was very tasty). Next time, I will try them with half the butter, just to see if it makes any difference :-).

This was fabulous.  I changed half the butter for applesauce, half the milk for buttermilk, and added a little nutmeg. Served it with fruit on the top, and my aunt declared that I should become a professional chef :)

This is a great, BASIC waffle recipe that will remain in my breakfast repertoire forever I think. I normally like to add things to waffles to make the taste more complex, but I wanted to try a waffle recipe that did not call for a stiffly beaten egg white (to make fluffiness, as opposed to a pancake mix), so I followed this recipe exactly as is. The ingredients were simple and easy to find in my cupboard/refrigerator. My housemates gobbled up these goodies in no time flat! They pointed out that the oatmeal gave them a nice texture and that they were soft on the inside and crispy on the outside, just as waffles should be. We topped them with fresh raspberries and Aunt Jemima maple syrup (like when we were kids...)

Great recipe, thank you! Like some of the other reviewers, I used wheat flour and old fashion oats, because that is what I had. I've tried this recipe a few times, my favorite variation uses 4 tbls. coconut oil in place of the butter, and added half of a mashed banana. Again like other reviewers, I make enough to freeze the leftovers.

All I had in the house was packets of oatmeal.  I used 3 plain and 3 flavored cinnamon rolls ones so I did not add the  cinnamon. I also used applesauce in place of the butter.  Really good.

Wow, these waffles are the bomb. Light, crispy and the smell while cooking is heavenly. I did add a bit more sugar (I like them sweet) and some vanilla extract. Will be making again.

this was GREAT.  I used regular old fashioned long cooking oats, ground up into a very fine flour in my blender, plus i doubled the recipe except for the butter/oil, and added 6 tbsp of plain yogurt to make up the difference.  (and separated the eggs, etc to make them lighter).  This is now my absolute favorite waffle recipe! I make a lot on Saturday and then freeze them for during the week.

I added 1/4 c. canola oil instead of butter but probably should have added a little more plus more salt because they were kind of dry and lacked a little in flavor.

I made this for brekkie yesterday and it was very good. I used 1 1/4 cups flour, and 1/4 cup ground flax for a little added fiber. I also added a little more brown sugar, maybe 2 tbsp more. Very fiberful, and delicious! Thanks! UPDATE: I made again, and used 3 TBSP Flax Oil and 3 TBSP melted butter. So good! Also used homemade pancake syrup! Fantastic!!! Thanks!

so I cheated and used oatmeal plus whole grain pancake mix for this recipe but it was delicious! I also always use applesauce instead of butter or oil in waffle recipe, and i think my oats weren't the quick cook kind but i like how they gave the waffles a nutty texture and flavor. just eyeball the milk amount (soy milk in my case) until it gets to the desired consistency. vannila"s always a good addition too

I thought this was a very good, hearty waffle. I was glad that another reviewer stated how many waffles it made (4 or 16 pieces if you cut each waffle into 4 sections) as that gave me a good idea as to the quantity to make. I found that these were so hearty we could only eat 1/2 waffle each. The only change I made was to substitue white flour for wheat and used canola oil, as suggested by other reviewers and that worked out well for me. I think the next time I make it, which it will be a keeper, I'll add some chopped pecans. I put leftovers in the freezer to enjoy another day.

I added some chocolate chips and used 3tbsp canola oil instead of the melted butter.  I also threw in some ground flax to make it a bit healthier.

These are AMAZING! I substituted whole wheat flour, cut the butter in half, and used skim milk. Score! My picky 3 year old daughter downed hers as well. Double score! Thanks SO much for this recipe, they are going in our "recipe regular" file!

Very tasty.  Will likely reduce the butter next time because it just seemed unneccesary and they were actually slightly greasy.  Will make again!

I love this recipe! These waffles are "hearty" and really stick to your ribs. The only adjustment I made was in the amount of butter I use. I substitute 1/2 of the butter for applesauce. This is a great recipe to make a big batch, let them cool, and freeze. It's so easy to pull them out of the freezer and pop them in the toaster. My husband and I love them toasted and dipped in applesauce. Yummy!

We had these for brunch yesterday and they were fabulous!  Easy to make and so good.  My husband was skeptical when he saw the oatmeal in the batter.  But after eating them he told me that he hoped that I would make these again soon.  We both loved them.

Fabulous recipe!!! I made these waffles for my niece and nephew before sledding on a cold winter day and they devoured them. They had a great flavor and were very hearty-and best of all, they are much healthier than a regular version! This one is a keeper!

This recipe is great! My family asks me to make this for them all the time! I've made 4 or 5 batches of these waffles in just the past month! Instead of using only all-purpose flour, I use 1 cup wheat flour and only a 1/2 cup all-purpose flour to make the recipe heartier and healthier. Everyone LOVES these waffles!!!

These were tasty!  They cooked up surprisingly pretty fluffy, considering they were kinda heavy/dense.  I was full with just one, so it was perfect for a hearty, on-the-go breakfast.  I'm happy with the health benefit of the oats.  I'm not a big butter fan so I reduced the amount by half (3 Tbsp).  I got 4 big waffles out of the batter, so I'm freezing the leftovers to pop in the toaster whenever I want 'em.  Thanks for the recipe!!!!  Yumm-o.

Great hearty waffle.  I added some orange extract (1 tbs for double the recipe)for added flavor and a bit more milk to make it easier to work with.  They taste great, and all my kids love them!

A very simple, fast recipe that turns out well and makes heavy filling waffles. I didn't pack the brown sugar at first and the waffles were a little bland so I added some brown sugar into the batter, make sure to pack your brown sugar. I also doubled the recipe and it made 9 belgian waffles. With our usual recipe we eat 2 to 3 waffles but this recipe filled us with only one waffle - it must have been the oatmeal. Finally, I love that my 3 year old is eating what amounts to a bowl of oatmeal by simply having a waffle.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  When I made it, I cut the recipe in half and I used 1/4 C. whole wheat flour and 1/2 C. all-purpose flour and it tasted great!!  When I cut the recipe in half I was able to make 2 belgian waffles

SOOOOOO YUMMY! Worth the effort! I double the recipe every time so I have enough to freeze for a quick school lunch. By adding a little more brown sugar, the kids don't even add syrup.
