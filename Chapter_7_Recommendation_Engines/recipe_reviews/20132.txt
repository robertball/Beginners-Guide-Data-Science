Everybody has their own opinion on what they consider a "perfect" martini. I'm actually not that picky as long as it's not too watered-down. I would call this recipe very nearly perfect. I usually swirl my martini (in the shaker) until my fingers start to freeze, which might be a little less than 30 seconds. If there is any left in the shaker, I pour it into a spare glass, so it doesn't get too watered-down with melting ice. Lately, I've been using anchovy-stuffed olives which I find quite delightful.

Being a retired Bartender,I was happy to see a great Martini recipe that's made with Gin! As of late, Martini's almost always have been made with vodka. I do love your Martini recipe but even more I love to change it into a gibson & add a few cocktail onions,now that's a great drink! Good job on all of your classic's. Someone really did do their homework! Thanks

Oooohh, Shaggy! I've always wanted to order a martini, as I like gin, but feared the disappointment.  So I made your recipe, just to test drive this baby, and I'm in LOVE!  Can't verify its perfection, however, since I haven't had much experience.  But I gave this five stars on its own merits.  Thank you!

I'm an 80 year old martini lover. The oldest recipes were two parts vermouth to one part gin, I prefer four parts gin to one of vermouth and I prefer Noilly Prat over Martini-Rossi or Boisierre. Any good gin will do. some say the name came because it was first served at an inn in Martinez, California. Others think it was named for the fine and powerful British Army Rifle, the Martini. The Martini rifle had a powerful "kick" and so does a good Martini cocktail. This recipe is 8 to 1 and a bit drier than I like, but it is a good one. If you like this, try a bit more vermouth at least once. Ask me about my cousin Elizabeth's choice of vermouth!

To make it even more "perfect", don't shake it, just stirr slowly.  Shaking infuses air into the drink and changes it's flavor (bruises the gin?).  As a long time "shaker" I found could really tell the difference when this was pointed out to me years ago by a barkeeper in Manhattan.  Just try it.  James Bond was just plain wrong  (but we knew that when he chose vodka over gin).

Classic cocktail! A Gin martini is the only true martini, no? This is a near perfect ratio gin to vermouth, but I do like my martini a little "dirty"...

This martini does have a nice ratio.   But really, no good martini with olives only has one olive.   I always use 3 and have fun with the stuffing (depends on what the finger food is).

It has to be dry to be good.  The only change I make is that I use a lemon twist instead of the olive.  Or sometimes, a pickled onion, to make a Gibson.

A gin martini is the only kind I like!!! Add a cpl drops of olive juice, if you like, and make it a "dirty martini." Bafferts gin is sublime. Happy martini holidays!! Brooke

Martini is my drink of choice before dinner and also love anchovy stuffed olives.  Keep my vermouth in spray container - when martini is in glass I spray a mist over drink then stir.  One thing that is missing from all reviews - even from bartenders!  The "perfect" martini is made with 80 proof gin.

A great base for a good martini! I left out the olives and added 1/2 ounce of cherry juice instead. Wonderful taste and light pink color.

This is far from perfect.  A traditional martini is supposed to be a cocktail.  As in a 1:1 ratio of vermouth to gin.  A "dry" martini can go down to a 1:2 ratio.  I honestly don't know where a "dry" martini became a glass of gin with a drop (or less) of vermouth!  Absolutely ridiculous!  I think it had something to do with Winston Churchill.    If you don't like the taste of vermouth in your martini, then get better vermouth.  If you're only adding sparse amounts, (1:8 ratio in this case) chances are your vermouth has just been sitting around too long and went bad.  It should also be kept in the fridge!  And secondly, a martini should NEVER be shaken.  Stir only!
