What are milk crackers?  I've always made cornbread dressing, but would like to try this.

My mom has made a similar stuffing for years.  The only difference is she uses Portuguese linguica instead of pork sausage and hot water instead of the milk.  This is absolutely the best stuffing anywhere!  The Milk Crackers are hard to find though.  They seem to be available only in New England.

I think what's missing in these ingredients is to specify "Jimmy Dean" sausage.  We've tried it with others and it's just not the same. This stuffing is the absolute best. Let's face it people... if you're going to have stuffing... have the BEST... and this is by FAR the best stuffing ever.

Very delicious! We all loved it. Since I couldn't find milk crackers, I used Ritz (by Nabisco) regular crackers instead, and for pork sausage I used Jimmy Dean Pork Sausage. For poultry seasoning I used Grill Mates "Montreal Chicken" by McCormick. We'll definitely make it again.

i have been searching for a recipe similar to this one that my grandmother used to make, however, she just used saltine crackers, ground beef, fresh parsley, and eggs. I swear it is the best stuffing but i am having a hard time duplicating it and of course she never wrote down the recipe.

Great recipe!! Milk crackers have been hard to find, but I've found Heritage Mills Lunch Milk crackers at Stop'n'Shop, Big Y, and Hannaford Bros all over New England, in NY and NJ. If you have Market Basket near you, they also have their own brand that's great.

For those of you looking to make this recipe and can't find the milk crackers, I found a cracker that tastes just like the Royal Lunch ones at our local Ocean State Job Lots store. It's Burton's Rich Tea Biscuits. They are in a bright blue wrapper and I think they are made in the U. K.

I use one pound hamburg that's been cooked with 1/4lb stick butter, 3 carrots, 3-4 stalks celery, 1 egg, 4-6 oz milk, salt & pepper, poultry seasoning and either stuff turkey or bake in greased bowl for 30 minutes @ 350Â°.  This is for when I just buy turkey slices at deli instead of whole bird.

This recipe is great with my sausage stuffed shells.  Simply stuff jumbo stuffed shells with this stuffing (except you want to add another lb of sausage) and place them in a baking dish faced up.  Add 1 can of Campbells cream of cheddar and 1 can of cream of chicken, and two cans of regular milk.  Bake at 350 for 40 minutes covered and you will have a great dish.

This was delicious!  I had some family for dinner and had prepared the stuffing ahead of time to put in the oven 40 minutes before dinner.  Ten minutes before I  realized I had forgotten the stuffing in the refridgerator.  I had no choice, but to microwave it.  I microwaved for 10 minutes and still people were raving.  I cannot wait to bake it.  This was probably the best new recipe I have tried in years.  Thank you.

I have used this recipe for the last 35 years. Everyone loves it. I see everyone questioning what milk crackers are.  I have always used saltines. However, I don`t grind them up, I break some of the them up and leave some whole and then just gently fold into mixture....I think it makes for a fluffier stuffing.
