Mmmm. So good. I simplified this recipe by substituting 2 jars of Herdez salsa verde for the tomatillos and chiles and doubled up on the garlic because I LOVE garlic. I also substituted Dos Equis beer for the water. This was killer. So delicious and so easy. It would make an excellent base for a green pork chilli if you wanted to add a couple of cans of white beans as well. Hominy would be a fun addition too. I will make this again and again. Mmmmmm.

Also, a note, if you can acquire Mexican oregano, your tastebuds will thank you. It has an amazing earthy flavour that you just can't replicate with anything else.

Fantastic! I used a 32oz. jar of tomatillo salsa to replace the tomatillos, onion, garlic, jalapeno and chiles. It had everything in it. I also replaced the water with chicken stock. During dinner my husband kept coming up with more ways we could use this pork. We ate it like soup, we had it wrapped in tortillas and next I will use it to make enchiladas! Yummy :)

Excellent. I used fresh tomatillos instead of canned, pork tenderloin instead of shoulder, and chicken broth instead of water. The meat was very tender, and had a great flavor. I strained some of the water out of the sauce, and added it back to the slow cooker with the shredded pork. We spooned it into warm tortillas and topped it with avocado, cheese and sour cream. DELICIOUS!!

This dish was excellent. However, you MUST take the advice of others and use chicken broth instead of water for added flavor. I also used pork loin instead of pork shoulder. The recipe came out excellent. My husband and I made tacos with the meat the first night, using corn tortillas and the same toppings as called for in the recipe, and had it as a stew the following night. My husband was apprehensive at first, but ended up loving it!  He even called me the next day from work to get the name of the recipe because he was telling all of his co-workers how good it was.

Excellent.  A little on the hot side for us, but still excellent.  I used boneless country style ribs and cut them into chunks before I browned them.  I used less jalapeno than called for (last year’s harvest, which I froze, were HOT), and rounded everything out with some salsa verde in addition to the tomatillos and green chilies.  I found it unnecessary to add any water.  I served this over Mamacita’s Mexican Rice along with some sour cream and guacamole, and Skillet Summer Squash, both recipes also from this site.

This is great! I used chicken broth in place of the water and maybe only a 1/2 tsp. dried Cilantro because I don't care that much for it. I also used pork loin instead of pork shoulder because it is what I had. It turned out awesome and quite spicy which I love!  Thanks for the great recipe.

Not what I call a real mexican recipe as my wife is Mexican and we call this dich chili verde(green chili sauce) but we only use fresh tomotillos,Anihym chilis and jalapenos or serrano chilli's which are simmered in chicken stock for about 1 hour only the stems are removed from the chili's then they are run through the blender using some of the stock poured over the browned meat (cubed)and allowed to simmer we make large batches so you need about 4 lbs of tomotillos,8 to 10 of each type chili (we like it spicy)simmer for a couple hours serve with Mexican rice and flour or corn tortillas enjoy!

I'm going to give this 4 stars, since it was good, but I changed it around a little.  I couldn't find canned tomatillos, so I used salsa verde and only one jalapeno (it was pretty fiery).  With that, it tasted great!  However, when I went to put the recipe in my "permanent collection", I turned to my fiance and said, ".  I was suppposed to put a quart of water in this thing!"  So...with the other reviews saying to use chicken broth instead of water, I say use salsa verde and no water (or broth).  It was still stew-like and not bland at all.

First I want to say a big thank you to Shel1986 for her suggestion to use Herdez brand Salsa Verde. For everyone who complained this recipe was bland next time add 8-16 oz of this Salsa Verde in your crockpot and watch your mouth explode with flavor at dinnertime. 

I substituted a bottle of Corona beer for the water. Second I omitted the tomatillos, green chiles, and jalapeno peppers and instead added 16 oz of Herdez Salsa Verde. I doubled the oregano to 2 tsp. I also added 2 T of fresh Key lime juice. (I kept the onions, cillantro, and garlic amounts as per the recipe). If you don't like super hot spicy then back down on the Salsa Verde and add it in 1/4 cup increments until you get the right level of heat for your personal preference. 

This pork had a complexity of flavors with the garlic, salsa verde, oregano, lime juice, cilantro, and onions. I'm not a big pork fan but this turned out to be the best pork recipe I've ever fixed. Forget the chipotle peppers in adobo sauce and find yourself some Herdez salsa verde instead. This recipe is a keeper. In fact I'm going to dig out a couple of more pork shoulders from the freezer to cook and freeze in smaller portions for making enchiladas, tacos, and burritos.

Most excellent! I went with the Herdez salsa verde (two 16oz jars) in place of the tomatillos, diced green chilies and jalapeno peppers. Only one clove of garlic for us, and I substituted two bottles of Dos Equis beer for the water!! Loved the recipe! Definitely add jalapenos if you like it spicy though!

Do not add any additional salt.  I added salt and I feel that it made mine too salty.  I took this to a Cinco de Mayo party and people loved it.  I did what others said and used 2 jars of Pace Salsa Verde- tomotillo salsa in place of the tomotillas.  It was so simple and easy.  I recieved so many compliments all night long.  Mine was the first dish to be completely finished out of 30.

I had fresh tomatillos I need to use so I used those rather than canned.  The recipe was a big hit.

This dish is AMAZING!!! I subbed the pork for chicken, used fresh tomatillos and omitted the sour cream and grated cheese. Fantastic! This recipe is a keeper!

I made this recipe exactly as written, but since I could not find canned tomatillos, I used 1.5 pounds of chopped, fresh tomatillos.  I found the finished product to be bland, and much too "sharp" (practically lemony) from the fresh tomatillos.  I added:  2T cumin, 1/2t cinnamon, extra salt, and a sprinkling each of tapioca and corn meal to thicken it (I got this idea from another Guisado Verde recipe).  It was better after those additions, but still not great.  The acidity from the tomatillos overpowers everything. Then I added some white cannellini beans to see if that helped.  Not really.  I am a huge chili fan, and make it at least twice a month (including many green chili varieties).  I can't believe I'm saying this, but I wouldn't recommend making this with fresh tomatillos.  It's just too acidic and nothing I add to it helps. I won't be making this again.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I would recommend a leaner cut of meat and adding less water next time.  Overall great recipe!

I used left over pork that I cooked in a slow cooker with mushrooms.  I chopped it all up, put it in a sauce pan and used a bottle of salsa verde and chicken broth and garlic.  I didnt put in the jalepenos because one of my sons cant handle hot food.  It was very good.  I will make this again sometime exactly how you are sapose to.

I have a picky family, but we are usually good to try new Mexican recipes. Today I made this Guisado Verde using about 3# of a Boston Butt pork roast. I took the advice of a couple of the reviewers and used Herdes salsa verde (my favorite) instead of the tomatillos, chiles, etc. I also used chicken broth instead of water. I did not use jalapenos, because my wife and son are more "delicate" than I am. 

The roast stewed for about 6 or so hours, then I shredded it and cooked for another 30 minutes as I made some cilantro lime rice to serve as a side. 

I served it in my bowl with cheese and sour cream as a soup, with rice on the side. For the second bowl I served it over the rice. The flavor was really good, and my wife said she will eat it again; however, she prefers less liquid and more of a chile verde consistency. It is a great recipe to play around with, and I recommend it.

EXTRAORDINARY. I did the suggested sub of using Herdez green salsa instead of the tomatillos and green chilis. For 4lbs of meat I used three cans Herdez, two jalapenos, one qt of broth. Dbl onions and double garlic. Then at the end I took the liq out and cooked it down to 1/3-1/4 of its volume to make it all less soupy. We ate it as stew or in tortillas as tacos. Reheats really well so make a lot! REALLY that good.

Oh MY GOSH! This is great! It smelled so good that when we served it up we forgot the sour cream and cheese... and didn't miss them! Fabulous recipe and so simple! I removed the seeds from the jalapeños but left the core and the heat seemed pretty moderate to me.

Next time I'll try it with chicken broth, and maybe another time, I'll make it with chicken instead of pork... seems like that would work as well! Sort of a Latin version of coq-au-vin!

This is tasty and as someone at party said, "authentic".  That's what I want to hear!  I followed other reviewers advice and went without the quart of water.  Believe me, the meat generates a LOT of juices.  We used the pork in tacos so I didn't want extra liquid, but if you want to enjoy this as a stew, add the water or broth.  I used two jalapeños and they added that authentic heat, not too crazy, but warming.  Very tasty with cilantro, guacamole, finely chopped white onion and lime wedges on the side.  I added some of the delicious juices to canned black beans on the stove top for a quick side dish.  Thanks FAstcooker!

I didn't bother to brown the meat and just cut it into 1 inch chunks and threw everything in the crock pot. I didn't even bother to chop the tomatillos since they basically fall apart after cooking I didn't have the jalapeno so I dumped in Herdez Salsa Verde. Jalapeno would have been better. Did not add the water since the crock pot generates so much liquid anyway. Infact I scooped out quite a bit of liquid and then added 2 cans of white beans and 1/2 a beer. After 6 hours the chunks just fell apart, no need to shred. I strongly recommend not adding a quart of water. Good flavor, even though I forgot the oregano.

This is a really awesome recipe.  I added two cans of drained Northern beans and a cup and a half of long grain rice.  I use two teaspoons cumin and two teaspoons of chili power in place of the spices the recipe called for.  I also used chicken broth in place of the water.

This dish was excellent on the day after I made it. At first I was not crazy about it. I used fresh tomatillos (I prefer to use fresh ingredients) The fresh tomatillos gave it almost a bitter taste, but by the second day the flavors blended together and the overbite was gone.  I also used a goya chicken bullion packet and pork shoulder. The biggest suggestion I have is to use mexican oregano. You can find it in most markets, typically in a plastic baggie next to the dried peppers... the flavor of mexican oregano is a lot different than regular, and really adds authenticity to the dish. I served this with shredded montery jack, a dollop of sour cream. I fried up corn tortilla's, filling them with only avocado for dipping into the stew.

I made this for tacos for a party-- super delicious!  Used pork shoulder, jarred Herdez salsa verde, as tomatillos aren't quite in season here, and most of a bottle of Corona.  Drained off most of the liquid after cooking in slow cooker all day, and shredded the meat.  Yum. Yum. Yum!

Very good.  I made a few changes to fit personal preferances, such as using a leaner cut, and left out the cilantro completely, and used no canned products but instead used all fresh ingredients. Tasted wonderful and even better when topped with a dash of sour cream

we loved this!! served with rice and pinto beans and encouraged a "have it your way" style of eating.  tortillas, cheese, sour cream, tomato, lettuce and avocado  were offered.  I ate mine as a soup/stew. the BH made little tacos with his. It was delicious and great fun.  something to be filed under "PARTY FOOD" future reference.

Delicious!  I only used 1 jalapeno so it would be kid friendly.  Has a nice little kick, but not too spicy.  I also added 1T of Caldo del Pollo (powdered chicken bullion) to flavor the broth (this is a cheap, easy substitute for the chicken broth advice everyone gave).  I saw the advice about using jarred green sauce, but if you saw how beautiful and delicious the onions and garlic looked after sauteing the pan juices I'm not sure you'd want to substitute for the fresh ingredients.  When the pork was done, I lifted the roast out and used my immersion blender to make a smoother sauce, then returned the pork and shredded it.  Yummy!!

My husband made this last Sunday for a family dinner and all of the adults LOVED it! This dish is just bursting with flavor! However, our young children found it a bit too spicy (we used medium heat salsa verde, the only one we could find).  Next time we will probably leave out the jalapenos unless we can find mild salsa verde. We only  made a couple minor changes:  we cooked this on the stove and we cubed the meat rather than shredding it.  Served this over rice with cheese and sour cream on the side.  Delicious!!!

WOW! I had to tweak this a little because I couldn't find canned tomatillos (used Herdez Salsa verde as someone else suggested). We like things spicy, but I omitted the canned chiles and jalapeno because I didn't have any, and I still think it's plenty spicy. YUM!!! I used a one #roast for my small family and cut it into chunks before browning so it would cook a little faster, used one can of salsa verde and one small can of chicken broth instead of the water, was pretty liberal with the onions, garlic and oregano, and it's "soupy" enough that I'll add some barley or quinoa before serving to make it more "stew" like. I plan to reserve some of the meaty filling to use in tacos or burritos later in the week. I cooked it on high for the first four hours, then switched it to low, and it's falling-apart tender after two more hours on low. Oh-and I added a hefty dash of cumin to the mix, just cause we like it.

Sorry to folks who don't like it when reviewers review recipes with changes, but this came out so awesome, I had to share. It'll be a great "spice things up" dinner for a very cold, blah winter day.

I loved this recipe so much that I couldn't help but tweak it a little bit.
First, I cut the pork into pieces no larger than 2-3" in any dimension before browning it. This added a bit more 'browned meat' flavor to the mix. This also reduced time in the slow cooker to about 4-1/2 hours but extended the preparation time by about 15-20 minutes. I then used about a 1/4 cup water to get the rue out of the pan. Why leave that flavor in a pan or washed down a sink?
Second I use a pound of fresh tomatillos cut in halves or quarters depending on size. Because the fresh tomatillos lose a lot of water during the cooking cycle, no water was added except that used to get the rue out of the pan. I did have to stir the mixture a few times in the slow cooker to ensure the ingredients on top exchanged places with those on the bottom for the best result.
A little more work but I think it was well worth it.

As an added bonus this makes an excellent taco ingredient:
1 white corn soft tortilla (heated),
1 heaping tablespoon or so of this excellent dish,
a light sprinkle of shredded jack cheese,
a nice bit of chopped cilantro (to taste),
a dash of hot sauce (also to taste),
(optional) a few drops fresh lime juice which works well with the cilantro

This is a very good recipe. I have made it 2 times and changed the following both times to make sure it was consistently wonderful. I used Boneless Pork Roasts(2 pack at my local store), inexpensive, lean and less waste. I used 1 1/2 to 2 pounds of Fresh Tomatillos, roasted on my bbq till soft and marked well. Used Vegetable Broth instead of water and Mexican Oregano. Other ingredients the same as recipe. I place pork on bottom of Slow Cooker, Everything else on top of pork. After cooking on high for 7 hrs in slow cooker, remove pork. Strain tomatillos, peppers, etc. Save the broth.  Blend to make a beautiful Verde sauce, add broth to achieve the desired sauce consistency. Put pork back in broth to keep warm and moist till serving. I serve with roasted red or yellow potatoes. Can freeze leftover pork and sauce. I use leftover pork, reheated with some of the Verde sauce and broth and shred it to make Fried rolled taco's. It's all good!!

I made this for a family gathering and even my 20 month old granddaughter loved it!  I cooked it on the stove due to time constraints and only used 1 can of tomatillos.  Other than that, I followed the recipe.  Definitely a future go to recipe.

I've been searching for a chili verde recipe that would be similar to that at  one of our favorite restaurants.  This is closer than I have gotten before, but it had too much liquid and not enough heat.  I followed the recipe pretty closely but it had a kind of vinegar-y taste.  Next time I will put less tomatillos and use a pepper that has more heat than a jalapeno.

We really enjoyed this over rice.  I used the ingredients as written, but cooked it on the stovetop as more of a stew, leaving the pork in tender chunks. I also used chicken broth, though less than called for so the consistency would be thicker.  It was very flavorful, somewhat tart without being overly so. I can imagine several ways to use this as a filling or topping and look forward to making it again.  Thank you!

I loved this, even though I was a little confused about the addition of the water.  I used salsa verde in place of the tomatillos, etc...  I added the water to the crock pot, which covered the pork shoulder but really dilluted the salsa verde mixture.  It was very tender and tasted good.  It just didn't have much of the salsa verde flavor.  I used it to make quesadillas, and could add more salsa verde at that point.  Don't know if I did something wrong, but it worked out OK for me.

I omitted the seeds in the jalapenos, but wish I hadn't.  It was a good dish, but I like it spicy!  I will definitely make again and leave the seeds.  It would be wonderful on a cold evening!

This was very good! I added 2 jalepinos but it was a bit too spicy for me so I took some out half way through. I also used a pork roast because pork shoulder sounded gross. Some of us ate it as stew, and some put it in a wrap. It was delish both ways. Thanks!

Excellent!  Based on comments, I made an even easier version.  Meat, broth, and a very large can of salsa verde.  The results were fantastic and this is now a staple in our house.

We fried up corn tortillas and did the normal taco fare of tomatos, cheese, avacado, cilantro, and of course hot sauce. Amazing! Even put the left over meat back in the pot with the juices and other ingredients and will eat it like a stew for leftovers.

I doubled the meat by mistake with a pork shoulder blade roast, it was fine, but probably more tomatoes (I used tomatoes, couldn't find tomatillos, should have added lime juice to add tartness) would have been better to balance the additional meat.    One jalapeno is plenty for medium heat even when I doubled the meat-to-pepper ratio (you can taste it, but it isn't persistent in your mouth).  If you get a jalapeno burn when chopping up the pepper, by the way, the sour cream you need for this recipe does the trick.  I tripled the garlic, but I like a lot of garlic.  Recommend serving over brown rice, or with a big hunk of fresh bread.  Of course, I made several significant departures from this recipe, so who knows.

I did this in pressure cooker and it came out awesome. I used 6 oz. salsa verde in place of tomatillos . 1oz jar jalapeño because I didn't have fresh.  Sautéed in cooker to brown all sides.  Had cut the 4 lb. roast into 6 pieces. I also added 3/4 Cup chicken broth to help pot get to pressure .  Cooked hi pressure 75 min. Was perfect ??  After it was shredded I felt it needed a little more seasoning so I added 1tsp cumin and 1 tbsp chili powder . Excellent........omitted the 1 qt of water

I have done this dish probably 4 or 5 times now and it turns out great each time. I usually use all chicken broth instead of water, and add an extra jalapeño or two for some extra kick. Will do again and can't go wrong with this one.

We live overseas and our base commissary did not have canned tomatillos, so I followed other reviewers' suggestions and substituted them for Herdez salsa verde.  I also substituted the quart of water with two Coronas and two cups of chicken broth.  Ours turned out more like a soup, but it was delicious nonetheless.  It had just enough of a zing without being too spicy.  I did not brown the pork or saute anything, just mixed it all up and dumped it over the pork.  We will definitely have this again.

Tried the entire recipe as written, exxcept for cilantro, which we both dislike.  Used fresh parsely instead. Smelled good as it cooked, but felt the dish was bland with little real punch or flavor. I really wouldn't recommend wasting 2-3 lbs of good pork shoulder, 2 hour' time and 7 hours of cooking for the result we obtained.

If use make this exactly as written it doesn't have much flavor. I added about 2 tsp of chicken flavored better than bouillon, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, chopped the rest of the bunch of cilantro and added it, found about 1/2 jar of salsa verde, about 1/3 cup of chopped jarred jalapeños, some chipotle lime chulula and salt to taste.  Served with sour cream, shredded cheese and diced avocado.  Turned out wonderful.

Simply put - this was delish! I did make a few changes because of what I had at home and what the store did not have. And to fit our tastes a little too.  One can of tomatillos, 1 c. of salsa verde, I had homegrown roasted, seeded, & peeled anaheim, 1 serrano, 1 jalapeno, I used chicken base, and less water. I served it over black beans & rice (kinda like Qdoba does with their chicken tortilla soup). The DH loved it too and said it was a keeper. Thank you for sharing :)

very good, almost too much meat, if that's possible. I would probably cut back to 1-1/2 lbs of meat. i was worried that with all that water, it'd be bland, but the flavors and the fat from the meat made for a real nice taste. also used only about 3 cups of water.

Great recipe! Only thing I added was Knorr caldo de pollo (chicken bouillon). Didn't need anything more. Great flavor with a little kick. My husband loved it.

This was delicious! I already had leftover shredded pork with garlic and onions, so I started with step 3 and made it on the stove top. I couldn't find canned tomatillos so I used fresh instead. I chopped them up and cooked them in just a bit of water until they were soft, then added the other ingredients. It took a little extra effort but it worked fine. We ate it over plain white rice with extra cilantro and monterey jack cheese. Very delicious!

It's still cooking away in the slow cooker, but I snuck a taste and WOW!  I used chicken breasts, fresh tomatillos and instead of jalapenos I used a habanero because I like it spicy.  I also used chicken broth, but only used 2 pints instead of a quart because I don't want it too soupy.

This was awesome. I used chicken broth instead of water and used one large jalapeno instead of two. I served it with shredded cheese and reduced fat sour cream, with arepas and yellow rice on the side. My version was too soup like for putting in a tortilla, but I imagine without (or with a lot less) water/broth it would be more of a filling. 

In any case it was lip smacking good and we hardly had any leftovers between my boyfriend and I since we stuffed ourselves. Will be making again...and again.

I made this dish for our weekly Bible Study Potluck Dinner and it was a huge hit!  Our local grocery store does not carry the canned tomatillos so I purchased the equivalent weight in fresh tomatillos, cut them up and sauted them along with the onions and they worked great.  I did not even have to take the meat out of the crookpot to shred it.  I just used a large spoon to break it up, so each bowl had some nice chunks of meat, in addition to topping with the cilantro and the Monterrey Jack cheese I also garnished with some avocado.  This recipe is a keeper, will double next time.  5 stars

Not sure why this recieved such high reviews. This was edible at best. The meat was very greasy and the flavor was weak. And that was even with using chicken broth instead of water. I wont bother making this again.

Meh. So-so. My hubs was by far a bigger fan than I was. Don't get me wrong.... This wasn't terrible (I had two servings), it was just really boring. To be fair, I did make several changes, hence my 4 star rating. I can't justify a lesser rating because I feel what I did significantly impacted the outcome (and to my surprise, not in a good way). Instead of using canned tomatillos, I subbed (2) 32 oz. jars of Herdez salsa verde (I already had one barely used jar in the fridge that I wanted to use up anyways). I omitted the jalapenos and diced green chilies, but still added the onion and garlic. I subbed chicken broth for water (to add flavor), added a 29 oz. can of (drained) hominy and ended up using a pork loin filet because my grocer didn't have any 2 lb. shoulder roasts available. In retrospect, I think whole tomatillos would have been perfect. They would have added some texture (as is, my stew was very soupy). I won't pass over making this again, but when I do, I'll be sure to NOT make any major alterations. I do however, feel that subbing chicken broth or beer for water and adding hominy or cannellini beans are a good idea and would make those adjustments again. Shredded Monterey-jack cheese, cilantro and a dollop of sour cream were nice garnishes. Thanks for sharing, Fastcooker! :-)

Excellent recipe. Just the right amount of kick. I couldn't find canned tomatillos so I used 24 oz diced fresh tomatillos. I used chicken broth instead of water and a slightly larger roast. I think you really need a shoulder roast to get the right texture. I don't think this would be as good with a loin roast.

I am rating this on the changes I made with other reviewer's suggestions. I used 3 pounds pork loin. Did not brown it first. I happened to have the tomatillo salsa, so add the chopped jalabeno. I substituted 12 oz beer for the water and did not add any more liquid. I also added about 5 tsp chopped garlic. My husband loved it and said to put it to the top of the rotations. I thought it lacked a little something. I think next time I will use the salsa verde with jalapeno as I could have used some subtle heat. There also was A LOT of liquid, even with only 12 oz added. The beer maybe added a strange taste, so next time I will use chicken stock and reduce it to 8 oz. It will be even better leftover, I think. Also plan to make pulled pork sandwiches. Definately a good recipe to play with. Thanks

This is now my husband's favorite recipe. Could not find canned tomatillos so I had to use a couple of jars of green salsa that included tomatillos & jalapenos. I also doubeld the cilantro and used an entire small head of garlic (personal preference).  I will try this again with chicken.

This was super easy and yummy.  I substituted 2 jars of Herdez salsa verde for the tomatillos, chilies and jalapenos, and chicken broth for the water (made it a little salty so next time I will not add extra salt).  Delicious served over rice - I think it will be even better tomorrow.  The pork just falls apart - melt in your mouth yummy! Good recipe.  Thanks!

This was really really good. I did not add water, but used the juice from the large can of tomatillos. 2 fresh jalapenos was perfect for us, but too hot for the little one. She did not like it. We used pork loin as the meat instead. Made excellent tacos (wet ones since there was a lot of juice). I will make this again, as it is husband-approved...

This is seriously amazing.  I made very few changes and they all had to do with just making it easier for me.  I like som otheres used salsa verde 2 16 oz bottles instead of the tomatillos since canned they are hard to come by.  Other than that I probably didn't use quite as much cilantro as called for.  I made twice and the first time I did brown the pork, I used pork loin.  The second time though I was putting everything in the  crockpot the night before and having someone else take it out of the fridge and turn on the next day so I didn't brown it.  I was unsure if browning it and then putting it in the fridge would be safe.  I couldn't tell a difference either way.  I did use straight water but just 3 coffee mugs full and I did put a couple chicken bouillon cubes in it to up the flavor.  Got tons of rave reviews.  And since after the meat is shredded and mixed back w/ the juices there is still so much juice left I actually heated up some posole in the juices separately and it was great.

EXCELLENT!  I accidentally bought "pork for carnitas" - twice as much meat for the same price - and it was still delicious.  With fresh tomatillos, Dos XX rather than water (suggested below), about a Tbsp of cumin, and a bag of frozen corn thrown in at the end (the sweetness is great with the tangy tomatillos!), it was really incredible.  My first way to serve it was with the "baked tortilla chips" also from this site.  I can't wait to have the leftovers!

This is a tasty basic recipe, but I think it needs more to be an actual stew.  I made it as directed, but afterwards wished I had thrown in some veggies or beans.  We ate it as tacos with frijoles and cheese.  I'll make it again, but will add more to serve as a stew.

I was also disappointed with this recipe.  Maybe it would have been more exciting if I had also used salsa verde instead of the tomatillos called for in the recipe.  As it was, after hours of anticipation, there was just nothing to get excited about.  It went in the fridge to hide, knowing that it wasn't going to be touched again.  I let it hide for two days, then resurrected it by adding a fresh can of chicken broth, 1/4 cup quinoa, a couple of diced potatoes, a few sliced carrots and for seasoning I added cumin and a ittle chipotle chili powder to give a nice smoky flavor.  After a 30 minute simmer on the stove my crew ate this up!

I didn’t know what to expect of this dish, but I love tomatillos, so I had to try it! First, I used 2 lbs of pork roast, what I had on hand. Store didn’t have canned tomatillos, so I used the Salsa Verde. Based on other reviews I used a 12oz bottle of beer in place of the water and also added two cans of white beans so I could eat it as a stew/soup. I let it cook on low for 8 hours, then shredded the pork and put back in the crockpot for about an hour. Turned out fantastic! I like my dishes spicy, so next time I’ll add some hot sauce or crushed red pepper, the japalenos didn’t make it spicy enough for my taste. Turned out great, can't wait to eat the leftovers tonight!

I substituted the tomatillos for a jar of salsa verde and a bit extra normal salsa, I wasn't sure what this was going to taste like but I was really surprised by how delicious this was...

i cooked on the stove for two hours, rather than in the slow cooker.

Loved this!  Next time I'll kick up the spice a little bit more, but this was very tasty.  Used a 3lb pork loin- cooked whole.  Couldn't find tomatillo's (in AZ- I know it's weird right?) so I used a 16 oz jar of Salsa Verde as suggested by others.  Also used 12oz beer instead of water (also another helpful suggestion :-)  My fiance liked this so much he requested I make it on a regular  basis.

Delish!  Easy to make, cheap, and sooo good! 
Like some others suggested, I substituted a large jar of green salsa for the tomatillos and jalepenos.  I also used broth, not water, and added 4 diced red potatoes.  It was soooo good!  Delicious served over rice with sour cream and jack cheese!  We're planning to use the leftovers as enchilada filling/ sauce.  Thank you for a great, easy, fast, super great recipe!

This was pretty good. I also added a couple of potatoes to make it more "stewy". I added several fresh jalapenos, I'll watch that next time as it made it really spicy. Seved it with mexican corn bread. Havent' decided if I'll make it again. It is very different, not in a bad way, but still very different. Thanks for the post.

Delicious! I made this with beef roast rather than pork, and I also added 2 potatoes chopped into small pieces. I also only used about 1/4 of a jalapenjo as it was very hot and chicken stock rather than water. It was sooo good! We ate it as a stew with tortillas and it was very authentic tasting. Will definitely be making this again.

YUMMY!!!!  No changes to the recipe except that I added chicken broth instead of water.  You could eat as a stew, but we opted for putting it in flour tortillas with some chese, sour cream and salsa.  It was soooooo goooood!!!!!!  Thanks!

DELICIOUS...full of flavor and spicy. 
I forgot to read the reviews before assembling the recipe.  So, yes, I added Season Salt to taste.  It was very soupy.  So I added instant potato flakes to thicken slightly.  Couldn't find canned tomatillos.  I used fresh that I sauted slightly.  Also, served it over tortilla chips, which absorbed even more liquid and added a nice flavor. Salsa and sour cream as a topper.  I would definiately make this again, maybe even the same way!

Yum yum. I had a pork tenderloin so I cut that up into cubes and used that. I cooked it on the stove, no time for the slow cooker. I simmered about 1 hour, maybe because it was tenderloin, the meat was very tender.  The whole family loved this including my 15 year old son & my 75 year old mother. Served with crusty bread.

Yum!  All you need is a few minutes in the morning to throw it together and into the slow cooker.  My husband LOVED it and my mother-in-law even asked for the recipe.

This was great!  I've tried 5-6 different verde recipes and this is a keeper.  I did add 1 can of chicken broth instead of the water, skimmed the fat from it a couple of times and added 2 tsp pepper flakes because the 2 jalapenos did not make it "hot" enough for my husband.

Average at best. Just seemed like it was missing something, but I can't figure out what.  We still ate it, but dumped the left overs.

Excellent recipe! Served with flour tortillas, refried beans and salad. Everyone loved it including my 11 year old who is a very picky eater and my husband who is not too crazy about Mexican food.  I made the house smell great too because everyone who came through the door said "smells yummy in here".  The only things I changed was adding a can of chicken broth in place of the 1 quart of water and I used pork loin chops (I am sure anytype of boneless pork would go great). Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was soooo good!!!  I substituted fresh tomatillos for canned, chicken broth for water, and left out the cilantro (because I forgot to buy it).  It was exactly the type of chili verde recipe I was looking for!  Thanks so much for posting it, Fastcooker!!!

I guess I didn't read the directions well enough the first time I made this. I didn't cook the pork whole. I cut it up into bite sized pieces, removed most of the fat and browned it that way before putting it into the crock pot. I didn't have to remove it and shred it that way.  I also tossed the canned tomatillos and green chiles into a blender before pouring into the crock pot. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. Subsequently, I used less water which strengthened the flavor. Also, I add a large can of hominy when it is almost finished. I really like the added texture it brings to the dish. This is a very filling meal with a few tortillas, some diced onion and a little sour cream on the side. One of my favorite recipes. Quick, easy and tasty!

Well, this was just ok.  I also couldn't find canned tomatillo's so I used the Herdez Salsa Verde.  Well it sure was tangy!!  My husband liked it after I toned down the tang a bit with cheese and a little agave syrup.  Not sure I would make this again.  Too many other recipes for mexican pork stew that we love.

I was smoking a pork shoulder so I took it out of smaller after 6-8 hours, sliced off the needed pork and followed the recipe. It turned out great, i added a can of black beans for more depth too. I would add some more hot peppers next time but overall it was great

Good and easy. I used fresh tomatillos and jalapenos. I only added 1 and 1/2 cabs chicken broth and no more liquid...a quart would have been way too much.

Um, wow and yes. This is delicious and I want to eat the whole thing. I pretty much followed the recipe as is. I used greek yogurt instead of sour cream and I added 1.5 teaspoons of salt to the top of the ingredients in the crock pot. I used 2 cups of chicken broth only because my crock pot wasn't big enough. I served it on top of mexican style rice. It would also be delicious as a stew, just add chopped potatoes for the last few hours. Which reminds me, this cook time is too long. I think 5 hours on high is enough. For 6-7 on low.

I already had cooked pork, so besides adding it at the end of step 3, and not putting it in the slow cooker, I followed this recipe originally. It was super acidic, so in order to tone it down, I added a couple tblsp of honey. Still had a strong acid taste. Think I will leave out the cilantro in the future, and just use it as a fresh garnish, as it was strong.

I made some changes based on my preferences, and what was available at the grocery store. I used pork butt and fresh tomatillos (no pork shoulder or canned tomatillos at the store). I cubed the pork before browning (so I wouldn't have to shred it) and used only a tablespoon of cilantro. My husband and I aren't crazy about cilantro, but a little bit is good. I left out the water and combined everything else (except the cheese and sour cream) in a dutch oven and baked at 250 for two hours. Served with cheese, sour cream, and warm flour tortillas. Loved it and will make again.

I think this dish alone is good, but it would be the PERFECT thing for a chipotle restaurant style burrito. the filling would be so good on a burrito. Still a very good recipe, but not filling enough for me alone

Used 32 oz Herdez green salsa, 7 oz chopped green chilies, and only a small amount of jalapenos. Eliminated the water. Used a very lean cut of pork shoulder, and I think it would have been better had I stuck to what the recipe called for. Still, it was very tasty served with cilantro lime rice.

This is in our top five recipes of all time!  We use the suggestion of subbing the salsa verde and it is fantastic. We serve with chihuahua cheese if we have it and teat up some warm tortillas if we want it a bit more hardy. Love, love, love!!!

Fantastic !  I used just one jalapeño (unseeded) and threw in a chicken bullion cube with the water.  Midway through the cook, I tasted the broth, told everyone to forget about this for dinner, TOO HOT.  Went ahead and let it finish off and when I plated it, FANTASTIC. Not too hot, calmed right down.   Absolutely one of the best dishes I've had.

We were hoping it would be like a nice, green chile stew, but the flavors just weren't there.  You can't count on canned green chile for any flavor...gotta have the real deal--fresh and roasted!  Anyway, it was an easy meal and it smelled really good all day...would probably be great for people with a blander palate, but we were hoping for more.

Fantastic, even for the kids!  I used pork loin instead of shoulder and used fresh tomatillos instead of canned or jarred salsa verde to avoid the additives and preservatives.  So yummy!

This turned out wonderful! I made it with two pounds of fresh tomatillos that I cooked down with 1.5 cups for water, garlic, salt and cilantro. I served it more like a caldo with corn tortillas in the bottom of a soup bowl. I did serve the caldo with a dollop of sour cream and the cheese! 
I also only used 1 jalapeno so kids would tolerate it! Will make again!

I used fresh tomatillos and I'm not sure if those made the recipe too watery, or it just had too much liquid.  It was still good, though!

Really easy & delicious. Hubby loved it. Added 2 chicken bouillon cubes after reading the reviews, and it made the bland broth taste much better.

Like others who did this, I substituted with a jarred salsa verde.  I think I may have used too much chicken broth for my personal liking as I never could get it to thicken enough to serve on tortillas.  Instead, we did rice bowls, which my kids then turned into burritos.  Served with Mamacita's Rice - the spice factor wasn't an issue for my tender tummy'ed husband and everybody really enjoyed the meal!

This was flavorful and easy.  Definitely we'll have it again.  I substituted chicken for pork and green tomatoes (the abundant garden!) for tomatillos.  I also used chicken broth.  We served it over spanish brown rice.

Great recipe! I have made it several times.I did use fresh tomatillos and roasted them before I added them to the crock pot. My husband loves when I make tacos with the shredded meat (minus the juice) use corn tortillas, add the shredded meat to the taco, top with chopped onion and cilantro, crumble the Mexican chesse "cotija" on top (add salsa verde if you like it hot!). reminds me of home!

My husband went food shopping and mistakenly bought 2 lbs. of boneless pork loin chops so we had to keep an eye on the meal so it wouldn't be mush. I did a quick cook on the stove top just so I would have the juices to cook the onion and garlic. I also used 2 16 oz. jars of the Herdez verde like others recommended. I also used a little less than a qt. of chicken broth instead of water. I cooked it on low for about 7 hours. We used it for tacos and then for the stew the second night. Great flavor and the cilantro really makes it. Great cheap meal to use for 2 nights too. We are only 2 people so 4 servings was just enough for us (2 tacos and stew). I plan on making a lot of this for when we have company.

The combination of ingrediants produces a very flavorful pork.  I have used a crockpot all my life and decided not to add the extra water.  I prefer that the pork cook in its own juices along with the peppers, onions and salsa verde (I used a jar of salsa verde instead of the tomatillos).  This made fantastic burritos - the meat was falling apart.  The little amount of liquid was actually perfect.  I didn't want a soup.

I loved this, my husband thought it was okay. I used chicken broth instead of water and a couple extra cloves of garlic.  I will make it again for sure, next time around I will add an extra jalapeno. Thanks for the recipe.

Suprisingly enjoyed, used it as filling for burritos, even my 2 year old loved it, and my foodie sister raved. The only thing I altered was to decrease the jalapeno to 1, and  made sure to season well with salt and pepper. Will definitely make again.

Somehow after all that cooking the tomatillos didn't shine through as much as I had hoped.  It was a little bland.

Very good and very easy to prepare.  I omitted the water entirely and reduced the amount of salsa to one can.  This makes a fabulous filling for fresh bakery roll, burrito, enchilada, taco, etc.  Or, fry the leftovers in a skillet w/hot oil and serve with eggs for breakfast.  Speaking of leftovers, this recipe freezes well for up to a month.

Delicious.  My only change was to use 1 one pound pork tenderloins.  This reduced the cooking time to 4 hours.

I also used the tomatillo salsa verde with 2 cans of chicken broth.  Then, I made a gravy base to add it to.  It came out much thicker more like guisado.  We were all surprised at how tasty the pork was!  Great recipe!

I substituted a jar of salsa verde and some chopped fresh tomatillos for the canned ones, because I could not get the cans.  We liked this very much, though it was a bit watery when it was fresh; however, it thickened up quite a bit in the fridge.

Soooo good...followed advice of others and just got the verde sauce as it had the tomatillos in there with the garlic etc...I did add minced garlic on top of that also and maybe not as much liquid as mentioned.  Did add more chicken broth than water.  But it was sooo good.  Next time, I will add some carrots, radishes and some other veggies to make it more of a soup.  We had it rolled in tortillas, like an enchilada and it was excellent.  This dish gets even better over the following days.  Thanks for sharing.

I love Guisado and have been looking for a good / great recipe for some time. I'M STILL LOOKING FOR A GOOD RECIPE!!!
This was a real disappointment - especially after the great reviews. I followed several suggestions: salsa verde, reduced water / beer, added jalapenos ....
The consistency was good, color was good, but lifeless and bland.
Still looking for a good recipe for guisado.

This is really good!  I took the advice from other reviewers and I replaced the tomatillos w/ salsa Verde and I used 1/2 can of broth instead of water.  I also replaced the seasonings with Adobo Seasoning from penzeys.  This is a keeper in my house!

Excellent flavor!  I made it with a whole pork tenderloin cubed and browned because that's what I had on hand. Next time I would double the amount of meat I use because it is turning out quite brothy. I did adjust the spices to my prefered level of heat and did throw in a packet of Goya Sazon con culantrro y achiote. Instead of water as the recipe calls for, or the chicken broth others suggest, I used a can of vegetable broth... lots of flavor, but I prefer it with pork because the taste is more "neutral".  I'll be serving over a nice garlicky white rice pilaf dish and refritos on the side.... Thanks for the recipe!

I've made this twice and my husband and I both really like this recipe.  I've never had anything quite like it. I use the Herdez salsa verde as well. I added potatoes the second time at my husband's request and it made it thicker for a stew.  I like to serve it with simple cheese quesadillas.

YUMM!!
Just like my Mom's, but no potatoes.  I followed the recipe, except used chicken broth in place of water.  
It could be a soup, add potatoes for stew, use meat for tacos, then make burritos.
Very versatile and YUMMY!

I found this a little bland. I couldn't find canned tomatillos, however, so I used fresh...perhaps I should have added more salt. It might have been a little better with a couple more jalapenos too. Maybe using chicken broth instead of water would have perked it up as well.

ooh soooooooo good.  I changed it though.  My guests would have not eaten anything spicy, so I omitted the tomatillos and jalapenos, and instead used a jar of salsa with seasoning salt.  It was GREAT.  Everyones favorite.  I'm going to use the drained meat for tamales.

This was absolutely delicious!!!!!!  I used chicken broth as someone had suggested and I used serrano peppers (just because that's what I had on hand).  I might use less liquid next time, but that definately didn't bug me enough that I won't make it again.   We will be making this a lot!!!!!!!!  Thanks for the recipe!
