I really did enjoy this chicken breast last night. I used 2 humongous chicken breast. I probably should have cut the 2 to make 4. And I butterflied the chicken.I just used the white sliced mushrooms I had on hand. The meal was delicious!. Next time I will coarsely chop the mushrooms and may try fat free or reduced fat cream cheese. It was so good I felt guilty eating it! Delicious!
