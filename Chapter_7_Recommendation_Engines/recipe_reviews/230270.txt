These were excellent.  My son absolutely hates both ricotta and cottage cheese so I was excited to try this recipe.  I added a scant tbsp of baking soda to get rid of some of the acid.  I put all the cheese on top, not some on the bottom and some on top as stated in the recipe.  Excellent recipe--great for make ahead meals!  Keeper Box!

Made these tonight and they were amazing.  Delicious as written- I just added some salt to the sauce and some mozzarella sprinkled on top of the roll-ups (in addition to the Cheddar cheese).  Both my husband and 2 year old daughter devoured theirs. :-)

This was great for a quick and easy dinner! I had leftovers of 'Wedding Gift Spaghetti Sauce', from this site in the freezer, so I used that instead of the sauce listed. I did not put cheese on the bottom of the baking dish, just meat sauce. After spreading the cream cheese and sauce on the noodle (I didn't measure it, made 10 rolls and used almost 1-1/2 blocks of cream cheese), I sprinkled it w/ parmesan cheese and mozzarella cheese before rolling. After filling the pan w/ the rolls, I topped them w/ the rest of the sauce, and more parmesan and mozzarella cheese. These were very tasty, and I really liked the richness that the cream cheese added. My ricotta-hating hubby loved these. I will be making these again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Great sauce but I'll hold off on the nutmeg next time.  I made a regular lasagna with it and it was great.  Good idea with the cream cheese!  Thanks!

Added some onion, spinach and bell pepper. I was curious to try the cream cheese in these, but for me I missed the texture of ricotta and they were very rich. However others in my family loved it as is.

Wow, I'm definitely going to be making this one over and over! There's enough sauce to make more than six pieces (eight or maybe even ten) and it's easy to serve since each piece is separate. I used shredded cheddar and mozzarella. I didn't measure, just put the fillings on until it looked right, and ended up using about half the package of cream cheese. I accidentally drained the pasta too early and it wasn't quite cooked through, so I baked the dish about half an hour and that did the trick.

This was a hit!!! I undercooked the noodles slightly by 1 minute so they would be firm when rolling.

I made 12 roll-ups.  Instead of cream cheese, used 1 container ricotta, 1/4 c. grated parm, s/p and 1 egg.  Used Ground Beef, but Italian Sausage would be great, too!  For sauce I used 3/4 jar of marinara with 1/4 jar of Alfredo.  Upped the nutmeg to about 1/8 tsp.  E ate it with some help, but A LOVED it!

These were good, but a little bland.   I would try again, but kick up the spices.

My family loves lasagna and loves these lasagna roll ups. I loved how they were little individual lasagna. How ever fun these are (and they really are) it is easier just to make a pan of it.

I would make this again, personally I think it's easier to make than a tray of Lasagna. I'm a vegetarian so I substituted the beef with faux meet crumble (I like morninstar). 
Next time I would make the meat sauce and cheese mix first and let them cool. Then while they are chilling in the fridge I would boil the pasta so that the ingredients are cold and easier to handle while rolling them up.

So I came across this recipe as I was looking up some lasagna recipes and thought, "hmm, lasagna roll ups?" and thought I'd take a shot at and to MY surprise it was a HUGE hit with my husband who isn't a BIG noodle fan but boy was he in LOVE with these. kept complementing on them hours after we ate them and requested we eat the leftovers for dinner again tonight lol 

I did change the recipe a bit to mine and my husbands taste.. I wasn't too sure on how having the cream cheese in it would taste and was worried we wouldn't like it so I didn't put it in mine. I didn't have any of the spices so I just put what I had which was garlic salt with parsley leaves.. came out great. I cut up some onion and mixed it with the ground beef once it was done I drained and mixed in the sauce I used (Prego Fresh Mushroom) into the beef and mixed it (just as recipe said, too) But, before I rolled up the noodle with the beef mixture I added a pinch of shredded cheese and some chopped up olives into every roll. I did also spread a good amount of sauce onto the bottom of the pan I used only 12 noodles and with the rest of the beef mixture I spread it on top of the noodles and added the shredded cheese with olives (pictures provided) it was a delicious meal. I will be adding this to my monthly meals. I'm glad I took the shot.

Delicious!  We added fresh spinach that was cooked in the microwave first.  Also, we used 1/2# hamburger and 1/2# saugage.  Might use mozzarella cheese next time.  Loved that it didn't have ricotta for my non-ricotta daughter.  Easier to roll than I thought it would be.

My 3 yr old granddaughter helped with this.  She had a great time spreading the ingredients on the pasta and rolling it up.  I had to make some substitutions, like using sausage and ground turkey instead of beef. Otherwise I followed the recipe and everyone loved it.  Next time I think I'd like a bit more of a tomato sauce than what I made, but that's just my preference.  I will make this again.

Love this! A few changes--used a sauce already seasoned and put the other spices in the cream cheese(without the nutmeg). It's a keeper!
