I make a similar version of this recipe that everyone swoons over: I add a teaspoon or two of "liquid smoke." Adds a great smoky flavor and tastes great!

Very good. Disappeared fast at the party. It was easy, looked nice and tasted great. The deep pink of the ball contrasted nicely with the fresh parsley. I used red salmon and added white pepper to the ball.

Everyone liked this.  In place of the salt I used about 1/2 teaspoon of garlic salt, about 2 tablespoons of green onion, and a little liquid smoke as suggested.

I can remember my grandmother and mother always making a salmon ball (served with wheat thins) at any party we had.  I always make this with a vidalia onion for a little sweetness, to go with the salty-ness of the salmon.  Also, I roll it in a mixture of fresh chopped parsley and chopped pecans.  They give it great color and texture!

The BIGGEST hit at a Thanksgiving pot-luck at work, then Thanksgiving dinner, then Post-Thanksgiving dinner, then another party later on (you get the idea!).  I noticed a lot of people mentioned smoked salmon.  For someone who doesn't have the money for a handled smoker, and canned smoked salmon isn't available in the regular grocery stores and is way too expensive in the fancier, Bumblebee's Atlantic Salmon is a pretty flavorful alternative.  The leftover (if there is any) hold up very well in the fridge overnight for a second helping the next day.

Quick and easy.  Tastes good, although I would recommend adding a little more horesradish to give it a little more bite.

I have been making this recipe for years and often I add liquid smoke. Kicks it up a notch and is a hit with my family and friends.  Use 1 to 2 teaspoons according to your taste.

I really had to doctor this up to keep it from being bland. I was excited to find fresh horseradish but I couldn't taste it. I put in about 2 tablespoons. I also added some garlic powder, dash of liquid smoke, white pepper and worchestersire sauce. I suggest making ahead, it tasted better the second day.

Very Good And went fast at a party but was more of a spread and never would form a ball, and I only used 14.oz can of salmon and 40. oz more of cream cheese. I added 1 tsp oliquid smoe and extra green oninons too. VERY VERY GOOD!! But it was a spread.

Good appetizer! Didn't have any horseradish, so subbed a little bit of red wine vinegar, in the search to add a little 'bite'.  Maybe spicy mustard would work also?

I also added a couple teaspoons of liquid smoke, and skipped on the fresh parsley. I made a mixture of panko breadcrumbs, dried parsley and a bit of Old Bay seasoning for the coating.

Edit: The cheese ball ends up being mostly salmon to the point that you really can't even tell there's any cheese in it...I even used a couple ounces less salmon than what the recipe calls for. I didn't think it had a whole lot of flavor, even with adding the liquid smoke. I would definitely try again with a leftover fillet or 2 of fresh grilled or baked salmon instead of canned.

This was good.  We used salmon that we had smoked and home made horseradish from this site (great horseradish).  Next time I will not roll in parsley.  I thought it overpowered everything.  I will try this next time rolled in nuts.

I had to substitute Chopped pecans to roll the ball in when I discovered that the Parsley I thought I had was actually cilantro. Other than that, this was pretty good though we prefer the recipes I have used before that add liquid smoke. Next time I will add a half tespoon of liquid smoke. Thanks so much for sharing!

Good stuff. Easy to make with ingredients that cost little and is always a good party hit. I did amend this recipe a bit by adding  a dash of liquid smoke. I roll into a ball and let set in the fridge for a few hours and then roll the ball in dried parsley flakes, cracker crumbs and paprika.

I was specifically looking for this recipe, it's a very good basic recipe. I too add a little liquid smoke. Love it spread on a freshly toasted bagel with some red onions and capers. I use about an equal amount of smoked salmon from the Pacific Northwest and cream cheese. Fabulous!!

I used salmon that my Dad caught off the coast of WA and had smoked, so I omitted the salt. Also never got the parsley rolled on...the dip went too fast! Had as an appetizer at Tanksgiving and everyone loved it! Will use again.
