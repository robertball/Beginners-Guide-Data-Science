2.14.19  Wanted just a little something to end a Valentine’s Day dinner today.  I just knew this would be the perfect finish to the meal with a couple strawberries that are peak season right now in Florida.   There are a number of peanut butter blossom cookie recipes on this site, I’ve tried several, and this one certainly measures up well.  Although the peanut butter-chocolate heart didn’t melt into a blob on the top, it’s melted when you bite into it (yum!).  There’s only one issue with this recipe, and that is it doesn’t tell you what temperature to use.  I baked at 350ºF, and since my cookies were a bit on the large side, it did take about 15-16 minutes total time.  They were good!
