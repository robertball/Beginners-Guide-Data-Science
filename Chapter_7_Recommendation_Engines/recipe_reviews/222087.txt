I love the fact that you posted this. I was shopping for sausage and turkey as a substitute and saw your modifications here on allrecipes.The result is fantastic and I really didn't miss out on flavor or the fat of the cheese. Now to come up with a vegan version for my friend! Thank you!

Can't go wrong with Chef John (original recipe).  I doctored the sauce a little (use red wine); added egg mix and fresh parsley to the ricotta.  Oh and I used whole wheat lasagna noodles and everybody loved it!

I'm sorry hate to be that guy but you can't call a recipe with SIXTEEN ounces of ricotta cheese, 2 cans tomato paste, AND two cans tomato sauce healthy....just because you used ground turkey instead of ground beef. That's an absurd amount of saturated fat and sugar...

Horrible false advertising for people on here that are taking your word for it.

As for the recipe obviously still super delicious hense the 3 stars, but god bless those who think this is "healthy"

Made this for Christmas dinner and was a hit, family said it was the best lasagna they had ever had!  I've made it twice now and used 1 1/2 to 2 pounds lean ground beef and it turned out wonderful!  Will definitely do this again!!!

This is the best lasagna ever! I have made the less healthy version before, and this one is just as hearty and delicious! The only thing I changed was I added lots of spinach to my red sauce at the very end of the simmering process. MmmmmMmmmm good.

This recipe was excellent and easy to make.. I used whole wheat lasagna noodles and I cut down on the cheese and it was Excellent.  I added mushrooms to my sauce.  Next time I'm getting a slice some zucchini and eggplant as well.   The noodles I bought did not require me to boil them first I cooked them hard with the sauce and the cheeses and it turned out excellent.

This is the world's best lasagna - everyone loves it and begs me to make it again.  As a personal preference, I did switch out the ricotta for a cottage cheese/egg mixture, but otherwise followed it as written.  No one minded the turkey swap one bit as it had plenty of flavor.  

One strange thing, I did find myself with some extra sauce both times I made this so I think you can be more generous for each layer. I ended up freezing it and using it for spaghetti sauce and that was good too.

This lasagna is excellent!  Great flavor in the sauce, and my only change is to swap out Italian sausage for one of the meet options.  Makes a nice amount and saves well for leftovers!

Excellent, but needed a little salt, more fennel and Italian seasoning. My addition of low fat provolone and half the ricotta made it perfect.

I made this with whole grain noodles, Aldi sweet italian turkey sausage links for the sausage portion, Splenda instead of sugar, low-fat ricotta cheese instead of regular, added an egg to the ricotta cheese, and doubled the italian seasoning and basil.  Also, I purchased two 7-oz packages of Kraft Slim Cut Mozzarella cheese and used both packs.

It turned out great but it made a lot more sauce than the recipe called for. I ended up using all of the sauce to avoid wasting it. I wonder if that impacts the nutrition content? The recipe doesn't explicitly state there will be a lot of leftover sauce.

*Edited:  I did the math for the recipe with the modifications listed above, using ALL of the sauce.  It came to 425 calories per slice

Love love loved this.. I am new to cooking and my guy (and his son) who loves lasagna thought it was great too. He went to the store for the ingredients and bought shredded mozz vs the slices.. But it still turned out great.  Other than that unintentional change, I didn't change a thing!! Thanks Allrecipes for another great one.

This was fantastic!  I made this the day before and let it sit overnight.  I used Jenni-O italian ground turkey and regular italian sausage (I couldn't find turkey sausage). Other then that I didn't change a thing in the recipe.  Definitely take time to make the homemade sauce.  It was so good - it will be the only pasta sauce that I use/make from now on.  This recipe is a keeper for sure.  I can't wait to eat the leftovers for dinner!

This was really awesome!!! My husband who is a picky eater said he couldn't tell it was turkey.  I used shredded mozzeralla cheese and low fat ricotta cheese and I did not pre-cook my noodles.  This turned out so good I will definitly keep this recipe and even make it for company!

It was a total hit and I made it without cooking the noodles and adding the 1 c of water after 25 min of baking. Turned out perfect!!

It sounds good, but here's what I do to make lasagna healthy.  I replace noodles with sliced eggplant.  I replace all the meat with roast vegetables (cauliflower, broccoli, mushrooms & carrots) ground to a chunky paste.  It's delicous

Very simple and yummy recipe! I used 3/4 cup more Parmesan cheese than this recipe called for and next time I'll try it with either more garlic or Italian seasoning. It was good, especially the day after, but could have used a tad more seasoning in the meat sauce since turkey sausage doesn't pack much flavor on its own.

Amazing and so easy.  Even my picky son ate it.  The sauce needs to be seasoned with salt and pepper before using to assemble the lasagna.  I used ronzoni no bake noodles since they are thicker than the other no bake noodles.  I find That The thin type no bake noodles can't support the sauce or meat in this recipe.  I didn't have turkey sausage so I skipped it and only used ground turkey.  Also to get some veggies in, I added 2 cups of frozen kale as well in the sauce.  Next time I will add mushrooms and carrots into the sauce and double the ingredients to freeze an extra pan for another night. With a salad, it is the perfect family meal.

Since I had add'l ingredients on hand, I'm using the leftover ingredients (ricotta cheese, sauce, cheese) to make calzones later on this week.

Really good and easy! I added a thinly sliced zucchini to the sauce while cooking, used light ricotta, and whole wheat noodles to give it a little more health factor. Yum!

This is  a good recipe. I made the sauce and assembled it the  day before and cooked it the following Evening. I didn’t boil the noodle prior to construction the lasagna. The noodles softened up sitting in the sauce overnight and were perfect after it was cooked in the oven. I would really reccommmend this method because I wasn’t too exhausted to eat it when it was completed .

My friends and family really enjoyed this lasagna. I'm not a big fan of carrots but it was quite yummy. I looked at the other reviews and did not include the water in my mixture. Also decided to go with go veggie mozzarella to be a little bit healthier and no one could tell the difference.

Really enjoyed this a lot. I've had the original version several times and didn't miss the beef and pork. I don't add fennel or parsley but it needs the teaspoon of salt so I added that. This winds up only being 11 smart Weight Watcher points.

Great recipe!  Sauce was kinda thick, so I would this out a bit to use dry lasagna.

My husband and I loved this lasagna.  I froze a good part of it as there was just the two of us and the following week when I thaw some of it we loved it just as much.  I'm going to make it for the children  and grandchildren this month as we' ll get together before the holidays.

I used Part Skim Mozzarella and Fat Free Ricotta, along with the Parmesan.  I wish that I could find Whole Grain Lasagna Noodles, but I can't.  I like to add a pkg. of thawed & squeezed-out spinach into my cheese mixture.  I used a combo of Lean Ground Turkey, and the meat which I squeezed out of Butterball Lite Italian Sausages. They're seasoned perfectly, and they add  lots of flavor.  I make my own Marinara Sauce from garden tomatoes which I canned.  I loved the addition of fennel, which definitely added even more flavor.  This is about as 'healthy' as you'll get Lasagna to be, so let's face it, it's a treat.... and we don't eat it every week (even though we'd like to) so let's just ENJOY it!  We have Lasagna once a month, w/an Italian Salad & Garlic Bread.  Mangia!

This turned out delicious! Only needed 6 lasagna noodles vs 12 (3 lasagna noodles per layer/ 2 layers total), doubled the Italian seasoning as well as the crushed garlic, and added 1/4 teaspoon of salt to the turkey/sauce mixture. So good! Yum!

Really, really good. I would probably add more veggies next time just to make it a bit healthier but it was good as-is. Made it for a birthday dinner and there wasn't much left.  Definitely more time consuming that my normal recipe but for a special occasion I would make again. Thank you!

This recipe is excellent.  I made it for my husband who normally does not like healthier recipes and he absolutely loved it.   I did add mushrooms to my sauce and it turned out wonderful.

Great recipe! I used turkey Italian sausage in place of regular sausage, low-fat ricotta cheese, and wheat noodles. Also added fresh spinach and finely grated carrots into the mix.

I doubled this recipe for my family and to give the other as a thank you to a neighbor. When I went to deliver it they were out of town so I am freezing the second batch as recommended by other reviewers.  This is unbelievable!  Took some time but not difficult at all.  Thank you!
