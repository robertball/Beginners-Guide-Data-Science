Sorry, I wasn't a fan of this.  It was a little too salty, I'm guessing from the soup, since I didn't add any salt.  And the pork chops were on the dry side.  We ate it, but probably won't be making again.

Very tasty and easy to make. I used reduced sodium soup because another review said it was too salty with the regular. I was out of thyme but it was fine without. The only thing I'll do differently next time I make it is double the soup, water and rice. I used 6 very small chops and it still barely covered all of them in liquid. After I ate and my boyfriend had two helpings almost all of the rice and soup was gone. If you don't cook for someone who's a big eater this probably won't be necessary. The pork chops themselves were a little tough, but flavorful. I'll definitely cook this easy meal again. Frozen dinner rolls baked in the oven were perfect for scraping up the leftover soup in the bowl.

I always use brown rice so it takes longer for the rice to cook, but for as easy as this is it's an excellent dish!  We love it :)

This seemed to be a stove top version of the ol' No Peek Chicken - only thing missing was the cream of chicken soup... Ok, but not my favorite.  Kid's didn't so much love it either.

liked this one a lot, left out the celery, added 1/4 tsp of crushed dried tarragon. this paired well with an american pinot grigio by Barefoot.

Tastes fine, but presentation is challenging.  Much better if you use boneless.  Bones are invisible in the rice  + sauce.

Sorry, we didn't like this one at all, unfortunately :( It was salty and the chops were quite dry.
