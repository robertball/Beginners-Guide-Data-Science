I think this is one of those recipes where you just have to adjust the seasonings to suit your personal taste.  I thought it was a little bit on the bland side, so I added more jalapeños, cilantro, and a shot of hot sauce (again, personal taste).  We love bean dishes, and we enjoyed this one.

Adding the salt seasonings before the beans are soft can make your beans stay hard and crunchy.  It all depends on the age of your beans, they type of water you use, and the altitude.  So, to make sure they always turn out well, add the seasonings with salt after they become soft.  
I took out the beer and reserved some of the cilantro, tomatoes, & jalapenos to add to each bowl while serving and this became my family's favorite.

As is I think they were a little bland as someone else has already mentioned.  I agree they do need to be doctored to your tastes.  I added more jalapenos, salt and 2 cups of chicken broth- everything else the same and they were fantastic!

This was great! I added chopped smoked sausage, 2 bay leaves, and used a regular  yellow onion  as well as some jarred jalapenos with juice  and some ground cumin along with a Tb of chicken broth powder.. I added the cilantro during the last 30 min of simmering . Also heated some corn tortillas on the plancha.

I often see drunk beans (and how I make them)  made with chili powder, cumin, fresh garlic, a chopped yellow or white onion and a couple jalapeños in addition to many of your other ingredients.  For those who can’t tolerate a lot of seasonings, these look good.

This is good!  I had to adjust the seasoning a bit, and I used fresh garlic instead of powdered.  I also added more heat.  Will make again.

Quite a tasty recipe!  This is a good start, but my family of teen boys likes a bit more "kick," so I added a small can of green chilies, a few splashes of Frank's Red Hot sauce & after 1 hour of cooking I fished out the jalapeno, seeded it, then diced it  & added it  back to the pot & cooked it another hour.  It then had a nice medium spicy flavor.  I served it over rice for a hearty meal!

I made these for a group of people and followed the recipe exactly but I did add Diced ham and also added a cup of bourbon. Everyone loved them, well done, I will be making them again soon.
