I must admit I didn't follow the recipe exactly, because I needed to use up some leftover fresh salmon that I cooked last night, so didn't use canned salmon.  I adjusted the quantities to suit the amount of salmon I had, and thought it was delicious!  The peppers and seasonings add nice flavor that I haven't found in other salmon patty or salmon loaf recipes, but do not overwhelm the delicious flavor of the salmon.  Instead of making a loaf, I used cupcake tins.  Next time I may increase the oven temp, because I had to add time for it to be done.  We added some tzatziki dip and/or a little jalapeno Greek yogurt dip (from Costco) on the side, and it was yummy. Thanks for sharing!

I also used cupcake pan instead of loaf and it turned out great! Made 6 delicious cakes and ate with dill sauce. I will definitely make this again and highly recommend this recipe.

Used this recipe to make salmon loaf from leftover poached salmon. I added extra tobacco sauce and was generous with the cayenne pepper. It was moist and very tasty. I would make it again!
