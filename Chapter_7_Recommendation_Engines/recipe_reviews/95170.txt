The "stew" taste delicious, is easy to make, and the addition of the fresh parsley and cilantro really give it a wonderful flavor. Two problems - the broth is more soup-like and maybe this should be renamed to reflect that, and I think you meant to say add white wine, not red. My chicken turned PINK and the broth is very red - not like the picture at all. Still VERY tasty, just would change the wine next time....

This recipe was in our local paper (Pittsburgh).  It sounded good so we gave it a try.  Anyone looking for an alternative to pasta should give this a try.  I’m not a big fan of cilantro so I omitted it and used all parsley instead.   I didn’t have cans of chicken broth handy and easily substituted chicken bullion.  We really enjoyed it.

This was so healthy and delicious, a wonderful combination of flavors. We loved it. I could not find smoked chicken, so I marinated a chicken breast in liquid smoke per label directions, cooked it in the microwave, diced it up and it worked just fine.  This recipe is going in "my favorites file".

This is one of the best stews I have ever made or eaten! I used kidney and borlotti (white) beans and upped the red wine a bit. As others had a problem with consistency I used a bit less stock and simmered it until it was nice and thick. Served with a side of cous-cous which was a nice compliment, made it heartier but didn't overpower the stew. Can't wait to make this in winter, I will remember it.

A really good, tasty, easy recipe.  I didn't have parsley and used spicy italian sausages instead of smoked chicken, also used a chicken stock cube and more wine instead of a can of chicken broth. Oh, and it made a lot so my pot was too small, I had to transfer it all to a large casserole dish and bake it (covered) for an hour.

We did not like this at ALL. We threw out the pot. No flavor, looked disgusting. Even when we added salt (which it sorely needed) it was unsavable.

I love this recipe! I am on a healthy food diet, so this was a great way to have high protien & fiber without a whole lot of fat.  My family enjoyed it aswell, but I added 2 1/2 cps. brn rice for them.   P.S. I was out of celery, so next time I cook it I will include the celery.

I did not care for this recipe. For 8 servings there sure is more than enough beans and tomatoes, but no real flavor. I won't make again.

I used 1 tbsp of oregano AND 1 tbsp of basil.  More onion and added 1 cup of Swiss Chard.  Regular chicken.  Omitted the wine since my daughter does not like sauces made with wine.  Very tasty.

I liked this dish very much. I played around with it just a little,  left out the wine and scaled it down to 4 servings.  As I am on low fat diet this suited me very well, I ate one portion and froze the rest

Really fantastic recipe, thanks for posting. Adaptions i made:  I used 2 tins black beans because i couldnt find navy beans anywhere, im not sure whether theyre called something different in the U.K but i cant find em.  I didnt add the smoked chicken, (oh and the italian herbs i decided to use were mint, oregano and thyme)  I served it with mash and my boyfriend went back for thirds, he really loved it.

This was good, quick, and easy.  To shorten the cooking time and because I didn't plan ahead, I put frozen chicken in my crock pot to cook all day while I was at work.  When I got home I pulled it apart and added it to the other ingredients in a pot on the stove.  Very nice stew on a cold day. Thanks for the post.

This made quite a lot - my pot was a bit on the small side so I left out some beans and the carrots.  The stew is quite tasty - very savory and smells wonderful, but I can see how many would call it bland.  Very filling, inexpensive meal.

Wonderful flavor.  I left out the wine, added only 2 cans of beans, and added green pepper and zuchinni.  The fresh cilantro is key.

This recipe was missing something or had to much I'm not sure if it was the smoke flavor, the wine or one of the spices. I know that I won't make this again. 3 out of 4 of the people who ate it didn't like it. The one that did had put cheese in it so maybe that would help.

I made this tonight for my husband and he LOVED it!! He loved the fact that there is plenty of left-overs. I even enjoyed it, which says a lot of the recipe since I am not really a beans person. Great recipe all around!

I thought this was decent, Healthy, filling, my husband throws hot sauce on it and eats it up.  But I didn't think it was anything special.  That may have been because I used dried herbs instead of fresh ... I will try again with fresh to see if it makes a difference.  To make the broth a bit thicker I added some cornstarch in.

Very strong flavor.  Served it with mashed potato which helped to soften the taste. Might reduce the amount of Italian herbs next time.

I thought this was great. Used all organic ingredients and a great wine which I feel really adds to the flavor.  I went with grass fed ground beef and beef stock instead of chicken and it came out tasting  quite good!

This is a hearty one pot meal.  I serve it over rice.  The proportions of ingredients can be altered based on taste or availability and it is always good.
