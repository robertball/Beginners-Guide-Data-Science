This is amazingly delicious and simple to make.  I usually shy away from summer-type pies, but I really highly recommend this.  Very out of this world!

This recipe was quick and easy.  I thought the raspberry Jello over powered the other fruit flavors.  Next time I my use half plain gelatin and half raspberry.  Either way it is delicious and it make 2 pies so you have one to enjoy and one to give away.  Thank you, I will be making this again!

Very sweet and fruity. Pretty good. I don't know about "out of this world" though! I cut way down on the bananas...It does not LOOK very tasty. But my husband said "It tastes better than it looks" : )

I took this pie to a potluck at work and it was a huge hit.  I used the Graham cracker crust instead.  I have since then made it again using strawberry Jell-o, and Lucky Leaf berry filling instead of cherry. I have decreased the sugar to 1/2 cup and it is still plenty sweet.  This is better if you let it sit for 6 + hours to allow it time to set.

A good pie. I didn't think it was too sweet at all. I didn't have all 6 bananas and it was fine. It was popular among alot of fellowship coffee hour desserts this AM and I heard good comments. I would think about adding some strawberries next time. Note: Needs at least 4 hrs to chill. So maybe an overnight thing.

I have made this recipe so many times, and everyone loves it!  It is fairly simple to make and since it makes two pies, it's a very good dessert to serve several people.  Women especially love it, but men like it also.  I've made it with sugar-free Jell-O and Splenda instead of sugar, and no sugar added cherry filling, and it's just as good!  It's good in the summertime, but also pretty to serve at Christmas!

I don't usually care for pies, but I love this one. My Aunt gave me the recipe years ago, but with nuts. I use the graham cracker crust, it's easier and just as good. Oh, I just noticed this one has cherry pie filling, I used just plain sour cherries and a cup and 1/2 of sugar. It just got too expensive to make. But it is my favorite.

Made this pie after finding the exact same recipe in a church cookbook.  It was an awesome fruit pie. I decreased the sugar to 1/2 cup. My husband thought it tasted like a fruit salad.  I never would have guessed that there was cherry pie filling in it.
