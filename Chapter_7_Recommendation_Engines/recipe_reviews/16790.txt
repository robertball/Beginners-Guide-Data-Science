This is definitely restaurant quality!  I did make a few changes so I could use what I had on hand -- I left out the chile pepper and used 2 lbs. of shrimp, 5 orange roughy filets and 2 6 1/2 oz. cans of chopped clams and it was wonderful. This is a very full-bodied and flavorful cioppino.

This was amazing!  I order Cioppino at a Italian restaurant we frequent and this was just as good if not better!! I actually added 1 cup chicken stock instead of water. Served it over Penne, Just PERFECT

This was a huge hit at our Italian Christmas Eve dinner.  As my daughter-in-law put it, it's "dynamite".  My family would give it a rating of 7, that's how much they loved it.  I added 3/4 teaspoon of dry crushed hot pepper instead of the red chile pepper, gave it just enough zing.

This was awesome!.. I've made this a few times following the seasonings and sauce to a T!.. I do change up the seafood though!  For special occasions I'll add some crab legs and scallops.  Traditionally the seafood is served in this dish with shells on... Part of the fun eating it is you get messy!... I always add a bag of frozen seafood mix during the last 10 minutes, shrimp, and clams... Served over cooked linguine with sourdough french bread!  Yum!
Note::::::::::::::::::::::: For the people using clams in the shell... If they don't open cook a little longer; the ones that still don't open throw out.. they are bad!

After searching much searching I came across this recipe and gave it a try. I used mussels, scallops, clams and shrimp. I served it over linguini. It was absolutely delicious. Perfect meal for a Friday in Lent. I followed what others said about simmering for 2 hours, which really enabled the flavors to come together beautifully.  I learned one important lesson from this recipe. My grocer sealed the mussels in a plastic bag. I later read that if not able to breathe mussels will suffocate---I ended up throwing many of mine out since the shells were opened. Make sure your mussels can breathe while storing them in the fridge!

fantastic. I have made it twice. I used crushed red pepper for the chile pepper and  I added 2 cans of clams and left out the mussels, using canned oysters instead. I am going to stock up on big shrimp whenever they are on sale, since the smaller shrimp dont cut it.

The seafood cippino was such a hit at my last party everyone asked for the recipe.  We had 10 people over the other evening (6 of us from San Francisco) and everyone was so impressed with the flavors.  We added crab and calamari to the recipe and it was great.....  Thanks so much for a wonderful recipe.....

Thanks,

David

I loved this recipe.  It's so easy to make and you can substitute ingredients for stuff you have around the house.  You can use whatever seafood you like and it's great served in a bread bowl.

I have been making the same version of Cioppino for nearly 40 years.  Because of the expense I have found many shortcuts...using frozen mussels, scallops, shrimp, lobster tails, any firm flesh fish.  I've made it for anniversary parties for friends and they raved about it for a long, long time...hinting  to make it again.  Made it just for HB for his birthday dinner and was he surprised.  This recipe is a close to a San Francisco restaurant as you can get.  Love it, Love it.

MAMA MIA! What a recipe! We just finished our Italian dinner of the the 7 fishes with this dish being the headliner and all I can say is that this dish was absolutely AWESOME! It was soooo easy to prepare too - it would make a super impressive company dinner as long as you know your company loves seafood! I started the soup at 3pm, let it simmer for 2 hours, added the seafood and cooked an additional 15 minutes then served it up over fettucini. A tossed green salad, toasted French bread to sop up the sauce and a Kendall Jackson Chardonnay rounded off the menu and I must say, I now have THE recipe for Christmas Eve forever! If this tells you anything, my 3-year old told me he wants me to make this for his birthday dinner!

I've made this recipe twice for my husband and myself and I always scale it back for two people. The last time I doubled it for a family gathering/dinner and their, still, was not enough. This dish was the star of the dinner table and almost everyone went back for seconds. For my family dinner I made a couple of changes, to suite every palate, though the recipe is perfect as written. I used both red and green peppers, added  fresh squeezed lemon juice and extra garlic, substituted  about 2 Tbl tomato paste for the sauce, halibut for the cod, fresh clams for the minced, clam juice for the water plus extra and red wine for the white. I also tossed in some calamari. Everyone kept commenting how good the cioppino was. My elderly uncle, who usually  eats without comment, asked for bread to sop the bottom of the bowl. Now that was the ultimate compliment.

This is a FABULOUS recipe, which got rave reviews.  I made a few adjustments ...
1) I did not use the fresh chile pepper (the pinch of cayenne pepper was sufficient) for our taste.
2) I used two 14.5 oz. cans of fire roasted diced tomatoes instead of the 28 oz. can crushed tomatoes.
3) I did not use the canned clams (didn't have any)
4) I used a container of frozen mussels (approx. 35), which I'd rinsed under tepid water to defrost.
5) I upped the count of shrimp to about 30.

I served it with freshly baked French bread and it fed 4 hungry adults, with a little left over for lunch the following day.  I'll definitely make this again.

This is a great recipe! I've never had a Seafood Cioppino before and it was very good (reminded me of Paella). I made it for my finance and she actually got seconds (she never gets seconds). For the white wine an an inexpensive Pinot Noir was used and Tilapia was substituted for the Cod.  Also be sure to take the full two hours to cook the sauce down if you plan to serve over pasta.  I had to add corn starch to thicken it up.  Alternatively, serve it over rice or in a bowl!  Highly recommended!!

Yummy!  The best.  I LOVED it and so did all my guests.  This is the best cioppino. The sauce is fabulous. Costco had a 2.5 lb. bag of prawns, calamari, mussels and scallops and I put the whole bag in.  I also made the sauce a day ahead.  It made for a wonderful party. All I had to do was heat up the sauce, put the fish in, cover it and wait a few minutes to serve.  It made a meal for 8 people.  EVERYONE loved it.  A real hit!

This was a really good base- I used 1.5 pounds of Cod fillets and a bag of seafood medley from Costco that had calamari, shrimp, mussels and scallops in it. YUMMY!!! I didnt use the white wine and subbed chicken stock for it, added one leek, one fennel and skipped the red chili pepper. Thanks for a great recipe!!!

Very flavorful dish and so many options. I cooked the sauce for 1 hr but I should've cooked for 2 hours. Also, pay attention to the seafood used. I used (frozen)cooked shrimp, scallops, mahi mahi, clam, and crab. I should have put the shrimp and crab in after the other seafood had cooked a bit instead of at the same time.  I'm don't like spicy so I didn't use the chile pepper, just a dash of cayenne. Overall good recipe.

This gets better every time I make it. Don't sweat the recommendations on what seafood to put in, or how much to put in. Make the stew per the instructions, then add whatever seafood you can get/afford. Haven't tried it with freshwater fish or crayfish, but suspect it worth a try. This evening I used canned clam, small frozen scallops, small inexpensive shrimp, and some fillet of some Costco fish in a bag - but still turned out so good my wife commented on it in a positive way.
Two thumbs up.

Followed the recipe with the pepers and onions but added 2 bulbs of garlic since my wife and I are Garlic nuts, herbs as suggested, 15oz. of diced tomatos instead of tamato sauce. We live at the Jersey shore so little neck clams are very inexpensive so I steamed 25 in white wine and garlic and used the broth, shucked these clams  and later added them to the sauce, I did not use the mussels or scallops, Right now it is spring and we have a great run of striped bass used this instead of cod, striped bass is a very firm white fish.

Sooo good!  Made a couple of small changes but nothing major.  Served it San Francisco style with hot sour dough bread and nothing more.  Love it and thanks for the recipe!

Made this for my husband's birthday dinner because he loves this kind of thing in restaurants.  I didn't think I'd be too too wild about it but, WOW, was it ever good!  The seasonings were addictive.  Glad I tried it.

Delicious, and easy. What makes this such a great recipe is not just the result, but its flexibility with the kinds of seafood used. I omited the Cayenne and Chile pepper and substituted fresh ground pepper, and subbed lobster for the scallops(had some on hand). I also cooked the fresh mussels over the tomato sauce base, the mussels' juices made the dish "taste like the sea". This recipe will be on the radar on every occasion.

Good recipe. I didn't have a red chili pepper so I used 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes in place of it. I only had a red bell pepper so I used it in place of the green bell pepper. Pollock was on sale for $1.99 a pound so I used pollock in place of the cod. I served it with a crusty artisan bread for dipping. I used a pinot gris for the wine. One cup for the cioppino and the rest for the cook.

My boyfriend and I were looking to try something different, and this was excellent!  Great flavor.  The only part we didn't really care for was the cod.  Next time we may try a different type of fish, or just use more shrimp in place of the fish.

This was absolutely delicious!! I would give this more stars. I didn't have a red chile pepper so I used a small amount of red pepper flakes instead. 
I used shrimp, scallops and Talapia, instead of Cod, as recommended by another reviewer. 
It was even better the next day. 
I will make this again and this will be great for my dinner party! Thank you for the great recipe!

This was fantastic. I served it during a seven course meal and it was a hit with everyone. I added all sorts of fish and would probably cut the cod in larger pieces next time. This is for sure my favorite soup of all times.

Amazing just the way it is. I've also made it with an additional can of fire-roasted diced tomatoes... wow, it adds a little extra something, but don't think you'll miss it without it. The way it is written is yummy! I also usually add 2 to 3 pounds of cod and use a Kitchen Basic Seafood Stock (32 oz) since we needed a larger amount. Enjoy! Oh, almost forgot, try to get thick pieces of cod, I really like the chunks instead of thin pieces. :-)

This is a keeper!!  My husband said he may never order it in a restaurant again.  I, too, added a red bell pepper to the mixture as well as increasing the garlic to 6 cloves.  I also substituted 2-14.5 ounce cans diced tomatoes for the crushed tomatoes.  I left out the water, but added one can of clam broth.  I served it with sourdough bread to sop up the wonderful juices.

I made this today for my wife and me. I followed the recipe but added 3/4 tsp crushed red pepper, 1 can of red clam sauce, 1 dozen little neck clams and 1/2 bottle of Corona Extra beer and a pinch of sugar.

I used all of the ingredients in the original recipe but added the above. This was the best cioppino I ever had!!! I wanted to have it again tomorrow but decided to give the leftovers to my Sister-in-Law
for her family to try as they love good food but she does not have the patience for a recipe like this...........Simply Wonderful!

I agree with all of the comments.  This is easy and very good.  I had to improvise on the fish since I couldn't get live mussels or shrimp. I instead used a lobster tail, a can of baby oysters and 10 silver-dollar sized scallops that I quartered. I served over linguine and be sure to have some good bread with this for dipping!!

Awesome recipe and we'll be doing it again!

This was enjoyed by my crew. I skipped the mussels and clams and opted for a frozen seafood mix from Trader Joes. I supplemented with some extra shrimp and cod. I thawed all of the frozen seafood in cool water before adding it to the soup base.

This is a very good recipe. I combined the ingredients from seafood cioppino and cioppini on this site. I simmered the sauce for 2 hours so herbs blended. Will make this again.

Made pretty much as written except no red chile pepper so I used crushed red pepper, and skipped the mussels..Delish, cook as directed so the favors come thru..a keeper..next time I may use red snapper as the fish guy suggested since the cod fell apart

This recipe is definitely great. I have made it many times. I leave out the chili pepper, wine. I add another can of tomatoes and tomato sauce.  I use two 6.5 oz cans of clams. I serve over angel hair pasta. This way of making it leaves plenty for leftovers. It's even better reheated.

Very versatile recipe. I used green bell, but also added mixed colored bells and some already roasted bells I had in the fridge. Instead of using whole crab (for money saving purposes) I used two cans on crab meat with the juices. I also added I can chicken stock to thin out the sauce a bit more. The family said it was the best Cioppino they ever had

I made this for Christmas Eve and everyone loved it!  I used the clams, scallops,muscles , shrimp and tilapia. The only thing I will do different next time is to cook the muscles by themselves first then the rest of the seafood.  I found that the shrimp in particular, over cooked while I was waiting for the muscles to open up.   Couldn't find a fresh red chili pepper so I used hot pepper flakes instead- it added just the right heat!

So good and easy!  I made for a dinner party and my guests all had seconds. I changed the recipe up a bit.  I used the Costco Seafood Medley bag which includes shrimp, scallops, mussels and calamari in addition to the fresh cod.  I also added in 1 dungeness crab.  Lastly I added two thick slices of lemon to the pot while the seafood cooked, it gave a nice acidic touch.

I replaced green bell pepper with a red one and used jalapeno pepper + anaheim pepper and it turned out great.  I tried recipe with cod and tilapia, tilapia was a lot better.  Serve it over some jasmine rice and it's amazing.

This needs 20 stars.  My husband took it to work to show off my work.  Everyone loved it and got a couple emails directly from his co-workers!  This will become a regular treat at my house.

This recipe was great! I followed the recipe with the following changes: I used spicy tomato sauce, 2 more pinches of cayenne pepper, fresh basil and a little fresh cilantro,the meat from 1 crab and I omitted the mussels. My husband and I ate it with sourdough bread the first night and then had the leftovers over linguini the next night. It was awesome! Thank you!

This was excellent.  I used this recipe for a potlock and everyone loved it!  First I turned it into a stew by adding 2 or 2 1/2 cups of chicken boullioun and extra cans of tomatoes and tomato sauce.  I didn't have the fresh red pepper so I used chili powder.  That wasn't quite enough so I added some tobasaco sauce to make it a little more spicey!  That definitely did the trick.  I will definetly make it again!

My husband LOVED it (and the rest of the family enjoyed it as well).  I added some crushed red pepper as well as the red chile pepper, and instead of the canned clams I used whole clams along with a little bit more wine in place of the canned clam juice.  Served over hot pasta with a dash of parmesan...it was great!  Will definately make it again, maybe I'll add some crab meat next time just for fun.

I made this the other night for friends who are excellent cooks and very particular about their food. They, my hubby and I loved it! It is an excellent recipe and definitely a keeper. I made the broth a day before and the flavors married beautifully. Also makes it easy to just add seafood and enjoy your company. The leftovers were fabulous the next day. Served with rice and of course, sour dough bread. If I could give this 10 stars I would.

My girlfriend and I made this dish today. I must say it came out excellent. I added linguine pasta  but  I think it would of been better with yellow rice. Over all the sauce was outstanding. Just the right spice to it. Can't wait to do it again.

Love this recipe! I buy the seafood mix that you can buy at costco when the seafood guy comes around... They are usually there on Thursdays. Then I add a few other seafood items we might have to make a medley! Delicious!

I made this dish for my birthday party went over very well. I added more shimp and kicked the heat up with some cajun spices, and replaced the cod with lobster meat, and kingcrab legs yum.

I would give this 5-stars if the recipe called for fresh herbs; I'll always use fresh herbs as I just don't care for the taste of dried. That being said, I used fresh herbs and crushed my own tomatoes.  It was very good!  I didn't have clam juice but it was perfectly fine without it.  Nice, basic, tasty cioppino recipe. Go fresh, though, you'll never regret it.

This recipe was excellent - very easy to follow and came out perfectly - our family loved it!! We have one family member who can't eat scallops, so I substituted 1/4lb shredded crabmeat, which added to the body of the soup. Also, I used 1 tsp of crushed read pepper instead of a red chile. Super yummy!

Excellent! I made this recipe yesterday with few changes, like i used chicken stock instead of white wine,10oz water plus fresh Clams instead of can minced clams and fresh Crab instead of mussels and scallops.I can recommend that you can add any shell fish or fish that is available.These were my husbands comments: Delicious, cant stop licking my fingers :) He tried a similar dish at the Fishermen's Grotto, a resturant in San Francisco.Bon Appetit.

This was wonderful! I picked up a bag of seafood from Costco, with everything but the fish, which was fine, because I don't really care for fish stews. I changed very little, but maybe added a little more of something, just for personal taste. I might have added a little more wine. ;-)  I made spaghetti to go along with it and some ate it over spaghetti and I chose to eat it like a seafood stew. Fabulous. It definitely needs all that time for the flavors to meld together.  Don't try to shorten the time.  Once you get the desired flavor, then you know that you're ready to add the seafood. I made it at Christmas and decided to make it again tonight.

This rocked! Dead easy to make, impressive enough for company, delicious, varied and you don't really need to change anything but it's very flexible if you do want to add different seafood or adjust the heat. I loved it. Made it for NY Eve dinner, served with rice and an arugula salad and lots of crusty bread. Literally a one pot meal. Awesome! I'd be sure to use only the thicker cod pieces next time so they don't fall apart and i'd leave out the chewy canned clams although the clam juice was a nice addition. I'd bump the heat too but that's truly a personal preference so I tend to go lighter with guests.

So delicious. Simmer slowly for a long time. I changed a lot because I was looking for a recipe for fish stew. So I added 4-5 cups of water and 4 stalks of celery. I used the spicy V-8 that reviewers recommended but the soup is so flavorful that I wonder if it matters. I left out the wine. I used only fish, Tilapia worked wonderfully, making this actually a very inexpensive dish. Buttered (not garlic) bread on the side for balance.

I added smoked paprika rather than regular paprika, and didn’t put hot peppers in for the kids. Added a couple of dashes of Worcestershire sauce as well.  Those two changes gave it a deeper flavor without making it spicy. Went great over pasta and rice, we tried both. Will make it again sometime soon!

Great recipe.  I added 1 bulb of fennel with the onion, and used red bell pepper instead of green.  I also doubled the dry spices.

I've made this seafood soup earlier this week. I've made some minor tweaks. I've passed on the chili peppers and used only green peppers. I've used pasta sauce instead of tomato sauce, since it was the only thing I've had on hand. It was a bit touch to cube a thawed frozen cod for the soup, but it was quite manageable. And my mussels were marinated in sauce and already opened when I brought it in a box. I've made it with salad at the side and  had leftovers to have over rice too. It tasted pretty good. I might make it again someday.

Very good.  Made as recipe says, no shrimp.  Jalapeño not a red chili on hand. Hubby over it.  Will make again, and again.  So good, may use as a holiday dinner.

I did add Portuguese chourico which added a slight kick to the sauce, but the entire family enjoyed it. ( even my granddaughter gave it a two thumbs up though the chourico was a little too spicy for her tastes)

I loved this recipe! I did it almost exactly as directed. I would add extra garlic if you are garlic lover. I omitted the  cayenne pepper and it was just mildly spicy. It was so easy and delicious with all fresh seafood. I can’t wait to try the same base with different seafood combinations. We did add about a cup of extra water because the sauce was thicker than we like, but I think I will follow another reviewer’s advice and add extra clam juice or a little chicken stock next time. Definitely easy enough to make and serve a fancy meal for company. Thank you!

This came out great.  I took the advice from another reviewer and substituted chicken broth for the water and did not use a red chili pepper but instead 3/4 tsp. of crushed hot peppers.
Can't wait to make this again...it was a big hit!

Super yummy! The whole family enjoyed this dish! I couldn’t find. Red chili pepper so opted for some jalapeño instead. Next time I’ll add in a bit more heat!

Followed the recipe almost completely.  I skipped the red chili pepper and only added a few drops of hot sauce and the cayenne.  We prefer just  a mild spice.  Loved it!!!!  Great with a grilled piece of bread for the broth!!!

Probably one of the best seafood dishes I have made in a while! I followed the recipe as was written but subbed red wine for white cuz red was what I had. I also added 2 tsp of sugar to decrease the acidity of the sauce. Thanks for posting this recipe!!!

I made this recipe thinking my son and i would enjoy it, but that my very picky husband would open a bottle of sauce and cook his own pasta. Much to my surprise my husband actually tried and loved this dish. the only thing i did different was to boil shrimp skins, a couple of scallops, and a few mussels to make my own fish stock. served  the cioppino with pasta and garlic bread. DELICIOUS!

The Cioppino was wonderful!  We made as close to the recipe as possible. We did add extra broth because after adding all the seafood we felt it needed it. Definitely will be making this one again.

I will make this again for sure.  It was delicious.  I did make some minor adjustments for convenience.  I used a can of clam meat, about 12 - 14 ounces from Bumble Bee.  This added a lot more of them than the suggested 18 clams.  I also found  it was not that convenient to buy just 18 mussels so I bough a 2 # bag and used all of it in the stew.  I did include the cod even though that was optional.  I took this to a family dinner I was invited to and everyone raved about it.

This recipe is amazing.  The amounts of seafood can be tweaked based on what you like.  I usually use more shrimp and scallops but it's up to you.  Also, jalapeño can be substituted for the red pepper. Some crusty bread with it is awesome.

Excellent! Having made Cioppino a number of times and had it served to me on Pier 39 in San Francisco and elsewhere, I have perfected it! Using the above recipe, I increased the amount of tomato sauce to a large can (28 oz.), used garlic flavored diced tomatoes (2-3 cans) and substituted chicken broth (leaving out the white wine for a few non-alcohol consumers that were in attendance - never missed it!) Seafood as recommended, added snow crab legs, live clams, and live mussels and used bay scallops as well as a lot of raw shrimp. (2 bags of 41-50 ct.). A party of 15 for watching NCAA Basketball tournament all raved about it and wanted the recipe!

WOW!!! My new favorite seafood recipe. This is a go to dish to impress any and everyone. I allowed the sauce to cool for 1 hour and then re-heat to add seafood. I also used fresh clams. I should suggest adding them 3-4 minutes before shrimp and fish so they open about the time the shrimp are ready. My fish of choice os Tilapia. Also, I used head-on shrimp because I like the extra flavor headed shrimp add to the sauce ( New Orleans secret). It does require that you peel and de-head the shrimp AFTER cooking - to be a good host ;0). But it is worth the effort since so much of the shrimp sweetness is lost if you cook shrimp after you have peeled them. Try it once and see if you agree. We  served over linguini and it was amazing. Thank you for adding this to my list of favorites.

Didn't have the mussels, so I added extra shrimp and scallops.

I added catfish instead of cod, 1 ghost pepper & a baby Bok Choy. Wife & love it just the right amount of heat. Served with a glass of white wine.

The sauce was thick like gravy. I recommend adding enough liquid to make Cioppino  a broth.

I have made this 3 times between Christmas and first week of the new year.  It was awesome and I got rave reviews.  Easy to make with such great flavors.

Delicious,  I used clams in place of the mussels. Also added  some large slices of carrot, this is how we have had it in a restaurant.

The flavor was decent but I thought it had too much of a tomato base that over powered the seafood. I didn't have clams,so I substituted prawns,and scallops,and I only had red wine no white. I added no parsley because I don't like it.

I'm giving this 4 instead of 5 stars as I made a few changes.   
"25 shrimp" is wide open to interpretation, even though the instructions mention prawns.   I used a pound of medium shrimp.
Instead of wine, I used seafood stock.  
Instead of clams, I used crab plus a little extra seafood stock.  
It's a great base recipe that can be tweaked to the cook's particular tastes.

Afyer looking Hi and Low for a recipe similar to my great - grandmothers (who took her recipe to the grave), I gotta say this was definitely it! That being said, it is definitely not for the faint of heart wallet wise, so this would certainly be a special occasion type of meal. But oh man! The longer everything simmers, the better the flavors meld together.  I didn’t add any of the seafood until the last 5-7 minutes because lets get real here, who's honestly likes overcooked rubbery shrimp, clams, crab, scallops, etc? I also added a little extra red pepper flakes as a personal preference because I like the broth with a lil kick and zing to it. 

Definitely a keeper!!!!

I made this recipe as written and it was really easy and delicious! Kind of expensive to make with all the seafood, but totally a company-worthy meal. Even my 3-yr old gulped it down! Definitely a keeper!

THE ASBOLUTE BEST SERVED WITH SEMOLINA BREAD.  I used mussels, clams, shrimp, lobster and scallops served over DeCecco linguini.  Can't wait to make this again.

I loved this. I followed it pretty much to a "T" (which is hard for me)...maybe used a little extra garlic, and haddock vs. cod, but that's it. The broth is heavenly. It's surely a keeper.

I was a little nervous to take on so much seafood when I have never prepared mussels or clams before, but this came out fantastic. I used crushed red pepper instead of jalepeno just for the convenience but other than that I didn't change a thing. I also was able to freeze the leftovers and reheat in the oven without issues. Great recipe.

Excellent sauce recipe.  I doubled and froze some sauce ... used it later by just pan searing skinless chicken thighs with a cup of onions (we love onions).  Then simmering in the sauce for about 1 hour.  I didn't have as much success with the seafood though, I think the clams made it a little bitter.
