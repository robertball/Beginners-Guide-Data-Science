i like the idea of using a broiler instead of frying in a pan with a lot of butter. next time, i'll stick with 1000 dressing instead of the mayo/chili sauce combo. otherwise, an easy sandwich.

Delicious!Instead of sauerkraut,we used a jar of sweet-sour red cabbage,and spray butter on outside of sandwich before broiling. Definetly a keeper!

I used a spicy chili sauce instead of the typical mild store brand and added a slice or 2 of pastrami.  Great stuff, will be keeping this one.

We really like these. Followed the recipe using a rye/pumpernickel swirl bread and a stove top grill pan instead of broiler. This worked out great and we will make them again. Thanks for sharing!

Toasting in the oven has really made this recipe.  I usually toast on the stove top, the broiler was much easier and taste excellent.  Also, used thousand island instead of chilli mayo.  Slow cooked the corned beef in a crock pot with a porter beer, red onion, black pepper and that packet they include.  This was by far my best Reuben ever!!!

1-31-13:  Still better is "The Real Reuben" recipe from this site.

Super easy and fast. But better than that, it was an amazing sandwich!. We've had it several times since I found this recipe. Loved it!
