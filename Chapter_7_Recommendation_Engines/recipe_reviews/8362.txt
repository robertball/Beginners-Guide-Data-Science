This was okay. The directions don't say where to put the heavy whipping cream, so I just added it to the wet ingredients when I added the potatoes. I left out the almonds due to allergies. The batter tasted slightly bland, so I added 1tsp salt and that helped immensely. The recipe made exactly 24 cupcakes, which baked beautifully. The flavor was nice, though weak. They were not as light as a typical cake, but not as dense as a pound cake or quick bread. Moist enough the first day, they got dry fairly quickly after that. I might make again, though I would use more zest and substitute oil for the butter to increase moisture.
