I also made this exactly as the recipe said, with Bush's Baked Beans.  It is indeed a bit sweet, which the kids loved!  For a mostly adult crowd, I'd probably use 1/2 - 3/4 cup brown suger instead of 2 cups.

This is the only baked bean recipe I make anymore. It always gets raves. As others have said, 1/2 to 1 cup of brown sugar is plenty. I always cook my bacon first and then saute the chopped up onion in the bacon grease before adding to the beans. And I add a couple squirts of yellow mustard to give it a bit more tang. And I always use Bush's baked beans to start - they seem to be a bit smaller in size and all the kids in our extended family like them better. This dish is awesome to use with leftover chopped up brisket.

The best thing about this recipe is the Chili Sauce - for this alone it deserves 5 stars! Chili Sauce adds a bit of bite, and makes this really special. For vegetarians or those avoiding pork, omit the bacon and use canned vegetarian beans - it will still taste delicious! I do have a problem with 2 cups of brown sugar - that's way, way too much for me; I start with Bush's Homestyle Baked Beans, which are already sweet, and add 2-4 tablespoons of brown sugar. I also think 1 cup of chili sauce is plenty. I saute the onion briefly, in a bit of bacon fat or canola oil. This is now our favorite baked bean dish!

Was the best beans I have had yet.  I used pork and beans instead of regular baked beans.  The pork and beans didn't have the brown sugar, so, when I added it, it all came out perfectly.  I threw everything in a crock pot and just let it go for about 7 hours on low.  It was perfect.

These baked beans were awsome.  I would recommend to drain your beans prior to cooking, as my beans were soupy yet delicious!

These are excellent beans.  I also use Bush's Baked beans, cut the sugar in half and I added 2 tbsp. mustard and 1 tbsp. of Apple Cider Vinegar.

Wonderful flavor, a little different from most other bean recipes I've tried.  The one thing I will change when making it next time is to drain the two cans of baked beans.  Mine came out very soupy. Luckily the great flavor made up for it!

These were really delicious. I was out of bacon (and bacon pieces) so I just added some melted bacon grease. I cut the brown sugar down to about 75%. My regular recipe calls for mustard and worcestershire sauce, I might add this next time. By the way, I drained the beans and this dish was still plenty "soupy" enough that I had to serve with a slotted spoon. Everyone in my family liked these.

These baked beans are AMAZING.  We had a BBQ dinner and served these baked beans along with Southern Pulled Pork (also from this site...and highly recommend as well).  The dinner was fabulous and everybody went back for seconds on the beans.  After reading reviewer comments, the problem with the "soupy" beans is because most people used Bush's Baked Beans.  Although Bush's Baked Beans are great on their own directly from the can, the consistency of Bush's is already semi-soupy, (which is why some reviewers “drained” their beans first) so by adding all the ingredients listed, your end result is very soupy.  Also Bush's beans are already flavored so by adding the sugar called for in the recipe makes for a really sweet bean recipe.  To avoid all this, you need to use Grandma Browns Baked Beans for the beans called for in this recipe.  Grandma Browns Beans are VERY thick (you need a spoon to get them out of the can) and are generally not sweet on their own.  Then following the recipe exactly as stated, the beans turned out perfectly!  Oh – I did add a good squirt of yellow mustard, but that is the only change I made.  I thought a pound of bacon was going to be too much, but it really was not - the recipe is just perfect!

This is a very simple, yet good recipe.  I have been looking for a recipe close to the one my Aunt used to make (she passed away from that "horrible" breast cancer disease), and this was by far the closest.  Although, I'm not sure why you would use baked beans to make baked beans...(was it supposed to be pork & beans....which I did use) anyway I used turkey bacon and they came out good.  Thanks meanjeanne!

This is a great, simple recipe. Instead of using multiple pans, I cooked my bacon in a cast iron skillet. I did toss in the onions to saute for the last few minutes the bacon was cooking. After draining, I added everything else into the skillet, and just put the whole pan into the oven. I do prefer it with a bit of mustard, but that's simply a preference thing.

This recipe is delicious! I used Bush's Original Baked Beans and as others recommended, I drained the beans well. I fried up the bacon in a large pot, then added the onion. When the onion was nice and soft, I drained off most of the fat and then added the beans and chili sauce. I took the advice of other reviewers and added 1/2 cup yellow mustard and 1/4 cup worcestershire sauce, which really gave it that extra kick.  I did not add in any brown sugar. I covered the pot and simmered on the stove top for about 3 hours. It did not come out soupy at all. It was nice and thick. I quadrupled the recipe for a party of 40 people and there were no left-overs. I will definitely make again.

outstanding recipe! I had a graduation block party over the weekend with 150+ people, so I multiplied the recipe by 8 to use 4 of the large Bush Baked Beans cans. Used many of the suggestions found here (ie drained all the cans first, used half the sugar, cooked onions in bacon grease first, bake beans 2 times). Given that it was such a large amount I almost chickened out due to having to cook so much bacon but ended up cooking it in the oven at 350 for 15 minutes then used scissors to cut the strips into small pieces. I personally do not enjoy baked beans but I have never received so many compliments on a recipe. They were the first thing to disappear.

This has been a family staple for years!!  There are never any leftovers and I always get recipe requests.  I first saw this recipe from Taste of Home years ago.  Like the other reviews stated it's definitely better with less brown sugar, about 1/2 to 1 c instead.  Drain the beans, I even rinse them too.  I include about 1/4 c. of the bacon drippings for an extra naughty home cooked taste!  Also, I add about 1/4 tsp of dry mustard.

These beans are easy to prepare and delicious, too!  I cut back on the brown sugar as suggested by other reviewers, and instead of baking them in the oven I put them in the slow cooker on low for three or four hours...I took the to an event I was going to, plugged them back in on the buffet table.  There was not even one spoonful left at the end!

The key to great baked beans is cooking them twice....once the night before for a 1 1/2 hours and again for an hour right before serving.  The double-cooking method makes them extra thick and really enhances the flavor.  Make sure an add some chopped up green bell peppers, garlic and worcestershire sauce too!

Excellent! I decreased the brown sugar to 1 cup per some reviews and I will use 3/4 cup next time. An easy way to cook bacon - put the bacon in the freezer for about 5 minutes, slice it up and toss it in the pan with the diced onion. It will come apart when cooking. I still drain it on paper towels to get rid of the excess grease. This will definitely be a repeat recipe this summer!

HONEY, HUSH!!!  These taste just like the ones I grew up eating at church socials and community fish fries, and the Heinz chili sauce is definitely key.  The only change I made was to add ground mustard (adding prepared mustard would make them too soupy).  You do need to bake this longer than recommended in order for it to firm up like it should.  Other reviewers have said to use less sugar - if you're serving this to Southerners and you want it to taste authentic, stick with the recipes recommended two cups of sugar. Served this to guests at two different large cookouts last night & the night before - rave reviews all around.

I work for Bush's Baked Beans and think they are the best prepared beans around but this recipe steps it up another notch. I generally cut back on the brown sugar and add a little Worcester sauce.

Love it and so easy!  Have made this for several baked bean connoiseurs who proclaimed these their favorite.  They have also won over my bean-hating husband.  I do halve the brown sugar (never tried the full amount, but it's plenty sweet with half), and sautee the onions with the bacon, as we only like onions if they are soft.  I love trying new recipes so much that I don't remake very many, but this is one that I will continue to make repeatedly!

I loved these! THey were just what I was looking for! The only thing I did differently was add a pound of ground beef. I like the addition of the ground beef to the beans and it took care of the issue of the beans being too soupy. I baked it in the oven covered for an hour and uncovered for an additional hour to reduce the amount of liquid even further. May reduce the amount of bacon next time. There will be a next time!!!

I have made this recipe twice now; for Memorial Day and for the 4th of July (because everyone who had it at Memorial Day requested that I bring it again)! I use the original flavor Bush's Baked Beans. I cut the brown sugar down to 1/2 cup, which still makes it plenty sweet because they are already flavored with brown sugar. The first time I made them, I only used a small onion because I am not a big onion fan, but with the amount of the other ingredients, the onion got washed out. So the second time, I used an entire large onion and that was much better. For those saying their beans turned out to soupy, I think maybe you just didn't bake them long enough. I baked my beans for 1 hr 15 minutes the first time and 1 hr 30 minutes the second time, and they turned out great the first time and even better the second. Not soupy at all. I will probably have to make these for every family holiday or cookout from now on. And by the way, the chili sauce is a great touch, but it doesn't really make them "spicy" the way I would have thought.

Yep! These were great!  I followed other reviewer's advice and reduced the sugar, drained the beans, (Bushes), and added a squirt of yellow mustard.  I had to increase the servings to 20 for Easter Sunday brunch so the cook time was about 2 hours. Everyone LOVED the beans, went great with ham and potato salad!  Thanks for sharing!  I will make these again!

Fantastic sweet & spicy flavor! Instead of Hot Chili Sauce, I used "Mild Sweet Chili Sauce" by Taste of Asia. I found this brand in the Asian section of the grocery store where all the stir fry sauces are.  I only used half of a 10 oz bottle - anymore would be too much. To ensure they were thick and not soupy, I drained one can of beans but left the 2nd can as-is. I also used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and sauteed the onion.  I cooked in the crockpot on high for about 2 - 2.5 hours. e and cooked on high in the crockpot for 2 hours. Fabulous - my husband said they came out better than his moms southern recipe - a true compliment!

These were a HUGE hit with my family and friends.  I did doctor them a little based on reviews.  I drained one can of Bush's original baked beans, the other can we just added to the bowl.  I used two small yellow onions, made sure to cut up the bacon in chunks instead of crumbled it, and we only used 1 1/2 cups of brown sugar instead of two.  We could probably go down to 1 cup, because it was sweet.  The chili sauce gave it a very nice touch.  Overall this recipe was great and I will be making it again!

I had to doctor these up some to suit our taste.  I drained the beans as my first batch turned out too runny.  I cut the brown sugar down to 1/2 cup as we don't like them sweet and added hot sauce.

This could be a four or five star recipe if the brown sugar was cut WAY down!  It was almost to sweet to eat!  It has the makings of a great recipe with some modifications.

OK - I do not care for these as they are too sweet for my taste.  But...all of the neighbors loved um as did my husband!  Since I was outnumbered, I gave them five stars!

These beans are great. The Chili Sauce is the key. As others stated, I halved the sugar, 1 cup is more than enough. I  chop the onions as small as you can and throw them in right before you take out the bacon esp if you're making it for a large group, hide them from picky eaters. but don't be afraid to use a whole onion.  Also this recipe is good in the oven or crock pot.  I've made this recipe for many functions up to 50 people. It multiples wonderfully and everyone wants this recipe!

I noted the reviews with recommendations to use less brown sugar and here are the proportions I used:  1/4 pound ground beef, 1/2 medium onion, (browned together), 1/3 cup chili sauce, 1/4 cup molasses, 1 heaping Tblsp brown sugar and 1 15 oz can pork and beans (drained, although I did add some liquid back in after it was all mixed together.)  I served the beans as a topper for a garlic baked potato. Made my kitchen smell great while it was in the oven - I'll be fixing these again!

This is a really good recipe.  The beans were very, very good.  I did cut the brown sugar back to 1/2 cup because the beans I had (Bush's Homestyle) already had brown sugar in them.  Also, the bacon I keep isn't 'regular' bacon, but Nueske's Applewood Smoked (the BEST bacon in the world!!!).  I actually had guests taking baked beans home and then calling back to compliment again.  That's gotta be pretty good.

The best beans I've ever had.  I do not like baked beans but these were awesome.  I drained the juice off of the Bush's original baked beans, ran a little water over them and put them in a crock pot with the sauce.  I only used 1 cup of the brown sugar and that was perfect.  I let them sit in the crock pot for about 5 hours on low.  They started to smell burnt so I asked my husband to try them.  He hates beans so I gave them a shot.  They were SO good, I'm glad that I had to try them.  I will make this for every BBQ!

These beans are really great with a few changes.  They are the only beans I make now.  You only need one cup brown sugar.  I also add one tea mustard powder.  I rinse the beans well before remixing them with the sauce and baking them otherwise they are too soupy.  I get many many compliments.

I decreased the brown sugar down to 1 cup, but still think they are overly sweet. Next time I will make them with 1/2 cup.  I also added 1 tsp. of allspice as I do in all of my baked bean recipes.  I prepared these in my crock pot on low for 2 hours and then added some sliced beef hotdogs and let them cook another hour. My crock pot cooks rather hot on low and they were bubbling! Very good!
UPDATE:  I made these again today and used 1/2 c. brown sugar.  I think you could easily get by with 1/4 c. but they were still really good!  I added the allspice again and baked them in the oven. I will continue to make this recipe!  Yummy!

The most delicious baked beans we've had and SO SIMPLE! My hubby even said "These are better than my Mom's". WOW and I about fell out of the dining room chair! He even asked what was in them, which he usually never asks unless it's REALLY GOOD! Of course, I told him it was a "secret" :)

I double the recipe for pot luck. I don't use brown sugar, use Karo Dark 1/2 cup.  Equal  parts Chili sauce & 3 Alarm BBQ sauce with 2 shots of Jack Daniels.  Sautee onions & Red pepper for 15 minutes...reserve 1/2 the onion/pepper and sautee until onions are a bit brown  (adds a nicee texture).
Use drained Bushes' beans, black beans, and black-eyed peas.  Sprinkle top with bacon bits,

I used Bush's homestyle beans and reduced the brown sugar to 1/2 cup and added about 2 tablespoons of mustard the second time I made this recipe and it was awesome-5 stars for sure!  Recipe "as is" receives 4 stars-pretty good but too sweet.

Excellent! My family loved them! I used 1 28oz  can of Bush's baked beans and 1 small can of pork and beans. I did drain both cans. I also used about half the brown sugar it called for. I cooked the bacon then cooked the onions in the bacon grease. yummy!

Absolutely Delicious! Seemed like a lot of bacon (one pound) but came out perfect. Did cut back the brown sugar to 1/2 cup and used Bush's baked beans - chili sauce was wonderful addition! Thanks again and will be #1 baked beans recipe from now on!

Yummy! I took these to a neighbors picnic and they got rave reviews (an old lady tried to take me home she loved them so much). I didn't have the chili sauce so I used some BBQ sauce and hot sauce, and it worked just fine.

These were definitely good.  I followed other suggestions to drain the beans out of the can and mine came out a litte bit "gummy" after cooked -- next time I will not drain entirely.  Everyone seemed to like them though.

I found this recipe in the Taste of Home magazine a few years ago and I've made it numerous times since. I also drain the beans before mixing the ingredients as it is a little soupy if you don't. The recipe is very easy and everyone loves it...even those that don't like beans!

If I could give this more stars I would. My son doesn't like any beans, I got him to try this - he loves them.
   I used one can of Bush's maple baked beans an two cans of pork and beans,'cus that's what I had,splenda brown sugar  and I had have the amount of chili sauce. Still just wonderful. I've made this twice already and will make again for the fourth of July.

I made this recipe tonight for a party!  All I heard was "Who made the beans"! I had to give it out to several people,  I did however, use only half the brown sugar.  These beans are really good.  I made a double batch and there were no leftovers!  This recipe is one to keep.

Well I made this recipe for Memorial day and everyone liked it.  What I did was cut some of the brown sugar because I used Bushes Baked beans and since I live in New Mexico I used a local red chili sauce for an extra kick this seemed to help balance the sweet and the spicy but this is a good simple and fast recipe.

Great tasting and easy recipe!  I made these for a picnic and received rave reviews.  Later that week I made baked beans from scratch.  After spending all day cooking them they were still firm and tasted bitter.  I will use only this recipe in the future.  A quick sure fire hit! JC

This is the only baked bean recipe I've used for about 5 years. I drain the Bush's beans first and cut the sugar to 3/4 cup.  It's so easy and so, so good. I never come home with any leftovers. It's a 10 star recipe.

I'll give this a 5-star rating. Perhaps there are even better baked beans dishes out there, but I enjoyed this a lot, and gobbled it all down by myself over four days. I made it almost exactly as written, using just over a pound of applewood-smoked thick-sliced bacon. I baked the dish for only 45 minutes, figuring that the extra 15 minutes wouldn't make much difference. This isn't very healthy, but it is very tasty - thanks!

I didn't give it five stars simply because it was too sweet. It had a good taste but next time I will cut the sugar in half. I would still recommend this recipe to anyone, someone else might like them this sweet but it was too much for me personally.

I made this recipe for a family reunion a few weeks ago.  I'm really picky about my baked beans, and do not like them straight from a can!  This recipe was perfect.  Since the canned beans that I used said that they had brown sugar in them, I did decrease the brown sugar to about 1 1/4 cup.  I used Heinz chili sauce.  I had NO leftovers!

This is a great recipe. To improve it just a little, put a small can of crushed pineapple in it. No one can figure out what it is, but everyone loves it.

These are absolutely wonderful!  I took the suggestions of others and only used 1/2 cup of brown sugar.  Other additions I made were:  I only used about 3/4 of the bottle of chili sauce and then I added about 1 T of mustard, 1 tsp liquid smoke and a few dashes of worcestershire.  I also used Bush's original baked beans and drained them before adding.   I will use this recipe often!!

I love this simple dish. I took the bake beans to our annual high school picnic and everyone love it.  The bits of crunchy bacon was awesome.  I took members advice and use 1 cup of brown sugar. Will make again.

these are AWESOME!!  I did follow the suggestion of decreasing the Brown sugar.  I used a very healthy 1 cup of dark brown sugar.  They are YUMMY!!  My husband and I did laugh about them being a heart attack in a dish (1 lb of bacon).  Will totally make them many more times!

We ended up loving these. Added just 1 cup of sugar tho. They seemed to taste better Day 2. The chili sauce adds a zesty interesting touch. Thanks for this!

These beans are great! The only change you need to make is only add 1/2 cup of brown sugar and then they would for sure be five stars thank you for the easy recipe made them in my crockpot on low for two to three hours and they made the house smell great too.

We made these for a 4th of July party. Everyone seemed to like them.  I'm not big on baked beans but I liked them and even had seconds. As other posters had recommended, we reduced the brown sugar to 1/2 cup.  It seemed to work great.

Very good baked beans! I was a little concerned about the chili sauce, but put the whole bottle in, used 1 cup brown sugar (beans were flavored with brown sugar), followed the directions and enjoyed some of the best baked beans I have ever eaten! My wife thinks we should use 1/2lb. of bacon the next time we make them ... guess I will, but I really liked the bacon. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This was great!!! Look no further!! This is your "NEW" and easy baked bean recipe!! Yes, cut down on the brown sugar and add some green bell pepper slivers when sauteing the onions!! Only need half bottle of chili sauce!!  It's the key though!! :)

I love this recipe. My friends have said it's the best they've ever had. For me a whole bottle of chili sauce is too spicy. Half a bottle works well. Also you can throw your cooked onion and bacon into a crock pot with the other ingredients on low and forget about it until you're ready to serve it. Thank you for the recipe.

This was a great recipe.  I did make a few changes based on what I had and personal preference.  I used 12 oz center cut bacon, snipped into small pieces and then cooked in a glass bowl in the microwave until browned.  I then drained the bacon on papertowels and used the same bowl to mix everything together.  Since I like my beans more on the tangy side I only use 1/2-1 cup of brown sugar.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

This recipe is a great start.  I drain as much liquid out of the beans as possible and then cut the brown sugar to 1/2 cup and the bacon to 1/4 pound.  Then throw in a some habanero pepper sauce to give it some really good kick.  Awesome!!!

This was good, but too sweet for us, and I used pork and beans in place of the baked beans (which are pre-sweetened), so with that in mind, l think the recipe would be way way over-the-top sweet with actual baked beans as an ingredient

Really tasty baked beans! Also, super easy to do! I added BBQ Sauce and Worcestershire Sauce, which made the flavor SO much better. Really gave it a nice kick, but super without too!

I made these twice for Memorial Day Weekend and received rave reviews. I used half the brown sugar as others suggested, cooked the onions in some of the bacon grease and a pat of butter, and cooked them in the slow cooker.  They were so easy to prepare. I will make these often.

These are the best baked beans!  Everyone raved about them!  The only change I made was to cut the brown sugar in half because I am just not a sweet bean fan.  At first, the beans seem really runny, but they thicken up just perfectly once baked.  This was a great side dish for the picnic- I just popped them in the oven and didn't even time them.

Very easy.  Great for potlucks.  I used 1 1/2 cups of unpacked brown sugar and could have used a little less.  Next time, I will brown the onions first.  Mixed and cooked in crock pot on high for 3-4 hours.

YUM! I've made it several times and it's always a hit. I use Bush's Original Baked Beans and Heinz Chili Sauce. I've even used low sodium bacon without losing any flavor. I cook the onion in the bacon grease and throw everything into the crockpot for about 3-4 hours.

I usually make it in the slow cooker (let it sit for 4 or 5 hours).  Even better the next day (not as soupy).  Has become a go-to dish for gatherings.

I have made this recipe many, many times and everyone loves it.  I'm not sure how anyone can honestly rate a dish when they didn't follow the directions and changed the entire recipe.  That being said, I have followed these directions to a T and I have also made adjustments.  Either way this is a great, deceptively simple recipe!  If you don't like your beans as sweet, you can drain off some of the liquid from your canned beans and cut back a bit on the sugar.  I think it depends on what you are starting with as to how much sugar you need to add.  Also, if you cook them a bit longer, they will be thicker.  Again, personal preferences.  My family wont eat beans out of a can anymore because they love these so much:)

I nice version of baked beans.  I made a half-batch but cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup and they were plenty sweet for us.  I served this with 'Italian Hot Dogs' a personal recipe from AR.

Excellent!   Followed directions exactly the first time, wouldn't change a thing.  The second time, after cooking bacon, onions, I put it all in the crock pot for a few hours on low and it was just as delicious!  I used canned pork and beans from Sams as they are not flavored like many of the other baked beans that already have sugar, bbq and spices mixed in.  The sugar and chili sauce made an excellent flavor combination.  I make double recipe and always take to events as my contribution and get rave reviews.  Update:  This time I sauteed the onions in the bacon grease as a couple people didn't like visible onions.  Turned out awesome.  A never fail recipe.

I made this recipe twice now.  First time was best, although a little sweet.  This time I followed other folks that said to cut back on sugar, so I only used 1 cup of brown sugar.  Also, this time I chose the Original Bush baked beans (vs. Bush Home- and Country style).  The beans came out ok, but no wow factor and definitely not sweet enough for my taste.

Awesome baked beans!  I used pork n beans. It was a bit soupy out of the oven but thickened up some as it sat. Very sweet, like southern baked beans should be. Yum!

This a terrific recipe!!!!!!! I accidently used Sciracha??? Chinese Hot Sauce before I realized the recipe called for Heinz Chili Sauce. We loved it so much that the second time I used the Sciracha sauce AND some Chili Sauce. Sometimes mistakes are right on:)

Dad loved them!  But I was short on time and watching my waist.  So I sauteed the onion in non-stick cooking spray with olive oil, and then tossed in a handful or two of real bacon bits.  Incredibly easy and saved a gazillion calories of bacon fat!

I came across this recipe and wrote down the ingredients and then somehow misplaced it so I ended up winging it. Now that I have once again come across the recipe I can see that I made a few changes.  I used 2 cans of baked beans in tomatoe sauce (Ralphs brand). After cooking the bacon, I sauteed the onion in the left over bacon grease. In a crockpot I added the beans (undrained), 2 cups brown sugar, bottle of Ralphs brand chili sauce, drained bacon & sauteed onion. Cooked on high for a couple of hours. They were the absolute best and everyone has asked for the recipe.

I thought chili sauce in baked beans sounded terrible but my husband likes spicy things so I tried it. It wasn't too spicy at all and these are the best baked beans ever. I have since made them for a family gathering and a church pot luck. I came home with empty bowls both times. This is my new favorite!

These bake beans were really good.  I followed the advice of the other fellow members and cut the sugar back to just one cup I can't imagine it with more than that.  I think the chilli sauce really took this beans over the top.  Thanks for such a great recipe.

I just made this for my daughter's first birthday bbq and it was amazing!! It was so quick and easy and tasted like I had been cooking all day. I did reduce the sugar to 1 cup like some of the others suggested. I also put mine in the crock pot on low for 3 hours.  They turned out perfect! This will definitely be my go to recipe for bbq's!

YUM!!!I used this recipe, but doubled it because I was taking the dish to a cookout. I did however use half the amount of brown sugar. I have received emails and phone calls from people at the cookout telling me how delicious the beans were. I was also told that this would now be my assigned dish to bring whenever there was a gathering.

OK baked beans. When I told my bf how they were prepared, he was confused. He didn't see the point in using a can of "baked beans" to make "baked beans".  I get his point. For all of the prep (minimal, but still a time commitment involved), I would have preferred a can of Busch's. Good, but not WOW! I won't be making these again. Thanks anyways!

Awesome! I followed the recipe as is and got so many compliments. Next time though, I think I'll drain the sauce from the Bushes Baked Beans so that the one that I make is even stronger and then it'll also be thicker!

These are delicious...I did as some others and cut the brown sugar to about 1/2 cup, and used Bush's original baked beans- plenty sweet, and we ate the leftovers the next couple of nights!  Will definitely make these again, especially for potlucks!

I made this for a bunch of teenagers and they absolutely loved it.  Some proclaimed that it was the best baked beans they've ever had!  This recipe is a keeper!

*The only thing I did differently was cook it in a crock pot instead of in the oven.

These were fantastic.  I doubled the recipe but only used one bottle of hot sauce.  I am a vegetarian, so I did not try these, but the response was only positive!  People were asking what the secret ingredient was.  Easy Easy!

These were really fabulous beans! One of the easiest recipes I've ever made too. A little on the sweet side, but great nonetheless. I cooked these for double the time called for and they were just right. Thanks, I'll keep this recipe, we really liked it!

My Entire extended family loves this recipe so much that I have to bring it to all our family gatherings!  1/2 the sugar is much better.  To spice it up a little I like to use the Bold and Spicy canned baked beans!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Terrific!  I've made it 3 times now.  Once I added another can of beans b/c I needed to feed more people, and that worked just fine.  In fact, we liked it a bit less sweet, so that was great!

This is the best recipe for baked beans that I have tried!  I made them for a party, & had many requests for the recipe!  I also cut back on the brown sugar & preferred it that way.  Other than that, it's the only recipe I'll use for beans.

Cut way back on sugar - used only 1/2 cup. Otherwise, simple and delicious.

I just made these for the 4th of July.  Fabulous!!!  I used regular pork n beans instead of "baked", cut the brown sugar down to 1 cup, and cooked in the crock pot.  I also fried the onion with the bacon.  Best baked beans recipe I have tried.

I made this for the 4th and cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup - still very sweet.  These were very good, but nothing spectacular - I expected more "zip" from the chili sauce, but all I could taste was sweet.  I would cut the sugar even more next time.

I used my kitchen shears to cut up the pound of bacon to crumble-sized pieces before cooking to save time and skip the flipping of pieces process. No microwave bacon for me please. I used Bush's Original Baked Beans. I cut the brown sugar quantity to 1 cup instead of 2. After that, I still found it too sweet and the chili sauce overwhelming the recipe. So, I added 1/4 cup prepared yellow mustard. That helped even it out. My husband really liked the bacon flavor. Unfortunately, the kids didn't care for it. Although, it could have been the texture and not the taste for them. This is a nice large recipe for social events.

I made these last night and followed the recipe exactly.  I used Bush's Baked beans and the only thing I will change next time is the amount of brown sugar.  2 cups was WAY too sweet for us!  I will reduce to 1/2 cup next time.  The chili sauce was great.

This is our favorite baked bean recipe - and it's so easy!  I make these in the crockpot.  I made some small changes: I used maple beans (Heinz), only used 1/4 cup of brown sugar (the beans were sweet enough), used pre-packaged cooked bacon, one jar of chili sauce, and carmelized onions.  I threw everything into my crockpot and left on high for 4 hours, stirring occasionally.  Heaven!  This is a hit at every party I bring them to.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

Pretty darn good!  Husband says he would do nothing different with the recipe.  I'd like a little more onion next time.  Only used half of the sugar and added some dry mustard.  Husband says to tell all of you we used honey bacon.

Great recipe. I followed some of others advice. Cut down on the sugar,
and drained the liquid from the beans.
Quick and easy crockpot recipe.

I hate to give anyone a low score, however we were really looking forward to trying something different from the normal brown sugar molases, for a bbq get together.  No one really liked them and I thought with bacon you can never go wrong.  It wasn't so much that they were bad just not good, they brought nothing to the table, maybe everyone else is using a different type of chili sauce.  Our guest instructed us to stick with our traditional beans.  Love trying something diff.

I had some friends over for a bbq and needed another easy side dish to go with my pasta salad and a great steak. This was definately it! The nice thing about this recipe is that you can adjust the amount of chili sauce for a perfect dish. Thanks, it's a keeper.

I chop up the bacon first then sautee the onions in some of the left over bacon grease almost to carmelization stage.  I think you don't need as much sugar may be next time I'll cut back to half the amount.

This recipe has been a huge hit.  I brought it to my boyfriend's family get together and they loved it. I made 2 dishes because we had 27 people and there were no leftovers.  Now, every time there's a family function I have to bring these baked beans.  I don't put quite as much brown sugar, probably 1 1/2 cups and I add a little more chili sauce, it's perfect!

Way too sweet for my taste.  However, I served it to my volunteers and it went over very well.  I called it HOBo beans since I used a combination of dried beans (red, navy and black eyed peas soaked over night )  to which I added 1 can of tomato paste then followed the recipe.  Of course I cooked this alot longer than suggested since I was using dried beans.

I made the recipe with some changes = 1/2 onion, 1 cup splenda brown sugar, 1/2 lb bacon w/2 strips uncooked prior to baking. I baked 1 hour and 15 min. Another 15 minutes bake time would have been ok also.

It turned out really well and everyone liked it.

I was ready to not like this recipe but it was delicious and got rave reviews.  I followed others’ recommendations and only used half of the brown sugar and it was perfect.  Next time I will use Busch’s Baked beans.  This time I used Van Camps and it was a little runny but it was still wonderful.  A winner!

I've made this many times and my family loves it.   The beans I use are campbells chunky baked beans: maple, bacon and beer flavor.   I've also mixed the chili sauce with barbeque sauce (2/3 chili sauce and the rest BBQ).  We use this when we smoke ribs on the smoker.  We put the foil pan of beans under the ribs to catch the flavors as the ribs smoke.    Yum!!!!

is is the first time I've made my own Baked Beans and thought this would be  a good starter recipe!  I did not have canned baked beans in my pantry so I did have Bush's Chili pinto beans.  I think they worked very well considering the amount of sugar called for in the recipe.  I did not have any chili sauce so I felt the chili beans would cover that.   After everything was mixed together, I found it too sweet and too much bacon.  I ended up adding apple cider vinegar to cut the sweet and a third can of beans.  This worked for my family's taste!

Vegetarian redux:
* skipped the bacon, though you could use vegetarian bacon like Morningstar Farms. 
* used Bush’s Vegetarian Baked Beans. 
* Substituted a vegetarian BBQ sauce for the chili sauce. Requires less - about 1/3 cup. 
* reduced brown sugar to about a cup as others have suggested. 
* added 2 cloves fresh garlic because I like garlic. 

Turned out fantastic!

5 Stars with some minor changes..  I used Campbells Pork & Beans... did not drain them as they are thick .  I used 5 cans... not the smallest but the next one up.  I also used only 1 cup of brown sugar.  The beans were amazing.. I baked them at 300 for 1 1/2 hour.  This will be my go-to recipe for Baked Beans.  Enjoy!

I too have been searching for the best baked bean recipe.  This one is pretty close.  I have made it twice now.  The first time, I used just 1/2 cup brown sugar, and added some yellow mustard.  My husband said they were too salty.  I cut back the bacon to 1/2 pound, added a small green pepper and increased the brown sugar to 1 cup.  This time it was definitely less salty but I should have stayed with the 1/2 cup brown sugar.  I think they were too sweet.  Next time I will cut the brown sugar down and maybe add a little Worcestershire sauce. Still trying to get the perfect combo.  Just a note, I sautéed my bacon, onion and peppers together for about 10 minutes then added the other ingredients.  You do not need to drain your beans.  I baked them for an hour.  Also, just let them sit in the oven for awhile to cool down and thicken up.

These were amazing!!! Everyone at the party loved them. We did change the recipe a bit by not adding an onion and doing both a chili and bbq sauce mix. Really, the hardest part of this recipe is frying the bacon. We loved it! For sure, do this at your next cookout!!!

I like this recipe for its simplicity. However, I did tweak it a bit. I added two cloves of garlic (finely chopped), 1 small apple diced, 1/4 teaspoon hot pepper sauce and 1/4 C Blackstrap Molasses. Then I baked it at 325 for two hours.  The apple cut some of the bite of the pepper sauce and gave the dish a sweet and spicy tang. This will be my go to baked bean recipe. Everyone raved about this dish.

I have made this recipe 4 or 5 times now, trying, first as written which was to sweet. I tried mustard, worstershire sauce, all good additions. I find what really makes the beans  is the chilli sauce. Also you must be choosy about the beans you purchase, a honey bean will be more sweet, so accordingly you must adjust the amount of sugar. But don't get me wrong as written is fantastic if you like sweet baked beans.

Quadrupled the recipe for a big picnic and everyone LOVED these beans!  It was a little sweet for my taste but easy enough to back off on the brown sugar a little.  I was the only one who thought they were too sweet though. lol

I made this exactly as listed.  It turned out great, but very sweet.  Next time, I will reduce the sugar significantly. I also cooked the bacon a bit longer than I.  I think that next time I will undercook it just a bit.  I will most certainly be making this one again.

These were a hit! Modifications made: 1) drained half the liquid 2) diced up the bacon first and cooked it with the diced onions together, drained them before adding to beans 3) only used 1 cup brown sugar 4) added 4 teaspoons mustard powder for extra kick and some black pepper. Baked it the night before, let it sit in fridge overnight. The next day reheated and it was the perfect consistency. Everyone had seconds!

On the sweet side. Cooked for a family BBQ and everyone loved the beans. 6 people ate this entire dish because they kept getting more servings. I think adding a few diced jalapenos would help balance out the sweet.

I took it to a potluck it was a huge success.    Used 2 cans of bush baked beans decreased brown sugar to 3/4 cup and added 2-3 TBlS of ground stone horseradish mustard.   Delicious and very easy to make

Good! I used bacon crumbles from Costco and only about 8 oz. Also, only 1/2 cup of sugar and it was still really sweet. Would make again.

There were no leftovers, but for my own liking, less sugar. lol Very good recipe!! Thank you

I took away one star because the amount of sugar is way too much.  I took advice from other reviewers and reduced to 3/4 cup.  I would have done that even without others advice, it was obvious.    I also sautéed the onions in some bacon grease before adding to beans,  my mom used to do that with her beans and she was an excellent cook in her day.  Having  said that, the beans were delicious!  I have never used chili sauce and it was a great flavor addition.  Thank you for the recipe!!

Way too sweet! I love sweets and add a pinch of sugar to everything- and this is too sweet. It also needs  mustard or something else to bring some tanginess to help balance out the flavors.  Will not use this recipe again.

This is by far the best baked beans recipe I've ever had and always gets rave reviews when I take it somewhere. The chili sauce makes the difference and adds an interesting kick to the recipe. However, 2 cups of brown sugar is too much for my taste and I've lowered it to 1 cup and it's very good.

I cut the recipe down by using 2 small cans of Bushes Baked Beans, I used one Home style and one Country.  I then cut back on the other ingredients accordingly. My fiance and his 15 year old grandson love them. There wasn't any left and they asked for more. I'll make the full recipe for our Memorial Day barbeque. This will be my go to recipe for baked beans.

Delicious side dish to our season's first cookout. I saw the reviews about reducing the amount of brown sugar, so I went conservative at first and used 1-1/2 cups. We loved these baked beans and my guests also raved saying they've had "good" baked beans before but these were outstanding, they even went back for seconds. I used Bush's original baked beans. I recommend this recipe for your next cookout!

Made this as is - yes even with the 2 cups of brown sugar... I like things a bit spicy, so I added some sriracha sauce. SO GOOD.  (about 2 or 3 ounces). 

Second time I made I did not have any chili sauce, so just used ketchup and sriracha. (about 10 ounces ketchup and 3 or 4 ounces sriracha).  I almost like this version better!

I made 1/2 a recipe, turned out delicious. Cooking the bacon first added a nice touch. The chili sauce adds just the right amount of tang. This is a keeper.

These beans are so delicious that we never have any left. (I usually make them once a month for a crowd of 15-20 adult men at 4x the recipe.) I've done them in the slowcooker, too.

This is the only way I make baked beans I only use 1/2 cup brown sugar and cook the onions in bacon grease as well as dab bacon and onion with paper towels after cooking.  We prefer our onion cut as slivers for a wonderful taste.  Have also made this other times with some sriracha for a little kick.  LOVE THIS RECIPE...     P.S drain your beans

Very good but to be honest they did not taste a whole lot different than plain canned beans. I used 1 cup brown sugar which was ample sweetness. Next time I may even reduce sugar to 1/2 cup. Nice dish if you are feeding a crowd . Would be good to take to a BBQ or pot luck dinner.

Ok, I was a little scared that an entire bottle of chile sauce would be too much (chile sauce is basically ketchup) so I upped the amount of beans by 50% and kept the rest of the recipe the same. I also used about 3/4 cup of brown sugar, which considering I was almost doubling the amount of beans was really the equivalent of using less than a half cup if you follow the recipe.

Bottom line, these were NOT good! I brought them to a barbeque and honestly my gilfriend and I were both embarrased that we brought them. As expected the chile sauce was WAY too strong and "ketchupy" and even using as little sugar as I did, it was too  sweet. Oh, I used Bush's baked beans original btw. Anyway, I don't understand the great reviews but I'm telling you these are really NOT GOOD.

good flavor, I baked at 245 for a while and then brought it up to 350 for about 15 min, think if i would have cooked them longer at the higher temp i would have liked them more, i also only used 1 cup of brown sugar and a half cup of sugar free maple syrup as we have diabetics that i was cooking for. thanks!

These are soooo good! I cooked them a little longer than called for because I worried they were a little too runny.  After taking them out of the oven and sitting for about 10 minutes, they were the perfect texture.  I served this with a salad and ribs.  Perfect meal.  I can't wait to taste them again next time I make them because there are no left overs! (I had seven for dinner and they ate them all!)

This is a keeper, but I did use only 1 cup brown sugar and added a tsp of Wrights Liquid Smoke and a Tablespoon of molasses. Used a Vadalia onion. I cooked about 1/2 lb of bacon in the oven on parchment paper for about 23 min (don't let them touch)at 400 degrees. Great raves. I cooked the beans in an iron 4qt pot in the oven for about 1 1/4 hrs uncovered at 350. They were not soupy. I used Bush's Original with bacon and maple. So easy.

After reading some of the reviews I did the following: used generic baked beans, used the whole bottle of chili sauce, used 1 cup loosely packed brown sugar. Then I baked it for 2 hours at 350 degrees, decided to lower it to 250 for about an hour and then lowered again to 250 for about the last hour. Took it to a cookout and didn't bring any leftovers home

My husband loves baked beans but agreed with me on this one - these are too sweet.  I am going to try this recipe again but I will just add a small bit of brown sugar since the canned beans are really already sweet enough.

This is a very good "traditional" baked bean recipe.  Like other reviewers, I halved the brown sugar and thought that was just fine.  These were a hit at our barbecue!

Update 4/21/13 I have made these several times now, but I've decided to up my rating to 5 stars after this weekend's bbq. The difference this time is that I started with plain organic vegetarian baked beans and then added the other ingredients, using just 1 cup of brown sugar. They were excellently flavored without being overly sweet and syrupy or ketchupy like I feel Bush's beans are. One guest raved that they were the best baked beans she had ever tasted. I think next time I will make one more change and try just 10-12 oz. of bacon instead of a full pound.

Too sweet!!! I used one cup of brown sugar instead of the two cups that the recipe calls for.  They were good, but I will use 1/2 cup brown sugar next time.  I followed the advice of others on this website and drained the beans first. The chili sauce makes the beans a deep appealing color.  I didn't use as much bacon as the recipe called for either. 

My husband liked the beans, but agreed that I should use less brown sugar next time.

These beans are awesome!  Everyone asks if I'll be making them at my bbq's when they RSVP.  The only change I made is adding more bacon because everyone loves lots of bacon.  This is a definite keeper!

I loved the taste of these, but 4 stars because its kind of cheating to make baked beans when you already start with canned baked beans! Outside of the US these were hard to find, so I used small white beans instead. Had to add something extra to give it more sauce though, so I put in ketchup and worcestershire  sauce - delicious!

Made these beans for a 4th of July Party.  GREAT!!!  Cut back on the brown sugar to 1/2 cup and did not use as much bacon (around 1/2 lb).  Also added a dash of Worcestershire sauce.  Very tasty!

This was a big hit! I definetely agree with other reviewers that the amount of brown sugar this recipe calls for is way too much! I only put in 1/2 a cup, and that was sweet enough for us! I also put everything in the crock pot, and cooked it on high for 4 hrs. Delicious thank you!

Sounded good to us and different but the kids and I just did not like.  Husband thought they were just okay.  Not sure if it was the chili sauce or the onions but I think we like more of a traditional bean recipe.  Thanks for letting us try

These were very good and so easy!  I used Hormel already cooked bacon.  Next time I plan to try adding chili powder because I wanted a spicier taste.

My husband thought it was a little heavy on the chili sauce, but I thought this was very tasty. May cut the chili down a bit next time to please him.

Excellent.  I also reduced the amount of brown sugar as well as cooked in a crock pot.  Thank you for the recipe!

This is the easiest most delicious baked bean recipe I have come across althoug,h I did use pork & beans instead of baked and I drained them first. If you're in a hurry, you can even use frozen onions and the precooked bacon in the zipper pouch and it's ready to toss in the oven. Every occasion I have taken these to has prompted requests for the recipe.

after reading the reviews I didn't use the full amount of sugar like some had said. I Probably added about half thinking I could always add more but I didn't have too.  Half was plenty sweet enough for us.  I used the crockpot like some had said.  It was very easy and very good! Everyone liked them.

Delish baked beans!  I made these yesterday for large family gathering and tripled the recipe. I noticed that all of my guests who went back for 2nds had these baked beans on their plate!    I halfed the sugar as suggested by other reviewers.  Only a small portion left today and kids are fighting over the scrapings!  Thank you All Recipes for another homerun!

This is the best baked bean recipe I have ever eaten!  I've made it three times now and there are never any leftovers.  I did reduce the sugar to 1 cup and it tastes great.

I loved this recipe, only thing I did different is I used red onion and I cooked it with the bacon that I cut up before frying. FANTASTIC! I will use this from now on!

Very good!  I made in the crock pot and only used 1 cup of brown sugar and a little less chili sauce.
