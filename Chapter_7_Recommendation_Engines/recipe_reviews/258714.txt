Great recipe however I did tweaked it a bit. I put in vanilla bean paste to add a little more dimension & a tad more brown sugar. I found that the recipe doesn't actually give a size pan, so mine was a small bundt pan. I added more apricots too that when unmolded, showed the apricots up the sides as well as on top. The cake itself is very moist & I had more than enough for the size pan I used.  Easy enough to follow for my 12 yr old granddaughter. Everyone loved it for several days. I'd keep it refrigerated, then warm in micro for a short burst w/some vanilla ice cream to enjoy!

The flavors in this cake are really good! The only problem I had with the recipe is that it looked a little flat when I was finished. Maybe the bundt pan I used was too big for the amount of batter? I used a 9.5"x 3.4" for reference. I'll definitely make this again using a smaller pan.

Was looking for something to do with fresh apricot.  This his was the first time I have even made an upside down cake and it came out amazing!
The fruit was amazing and the cake was super moist.  
I'll make this again forsure!
I would of loved to have attached the photo, but I kept getting an error.

I don't usually bake from scratch but was given a bunch of fresh apricots and couldn't resist trying. It took me about three time longer than the recipe said. The butter brown sugar mixture was very thin and difficult to get to stay on the sides of the pan. I put it in the refrigerator to cool and thicken. Substituted plain yogurt for the sour cream. Wasn't sure how long to let it cool, waited over an hour and then turned over and it popped our very easily. Had bought new non-stick bundt pan.
