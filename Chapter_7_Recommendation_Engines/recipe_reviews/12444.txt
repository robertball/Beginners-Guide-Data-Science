This was easy and good. Make sure to eat the two layers and crust together. Separately they are "ok" but all together they are good. It reminds me of a no bake cheesecake. **UPDATE** After this chilled overnight, the taste of the cream cheese completely disappeared....now it just tastes like chocolate pudding with a graham cracker crust.

My husband is a diabetic, so this lowfat, low sugar recipe is great! I substitued sugar for splenda, but it was about 2 Tbsp, I also used 'chocolate fudge' sugarfree pudding instead of regular chocolate. Also, I used a full 8oz. of reduced fat cream cheese. I guess that makes it more fattening, but the cream cheese flavor is more vivid and makes a fuller pie. Very Good!

Really delicious, especially given the lower fat and lower sugar aspects of this recipe. My husband, who is usually picky about me substituting healthier ingredients in recipes, devoured his slice of pie, as did I!

This recipe was designed for the small pie graham cracker crust. Easy to make. I did have to add some extra milk (1/4 cup) due to the fact the pudding mixture seemed a bit dry. I used a Dessert Decorator and the star tip to pipe the topping on the pie.

OK but not a standout dessert.  The taste of the cream cheese gets lost in the chocolate.  However a quick remedy for a sweet tooth...
