Since you basically dump everything into the pan, it was easy to prep. But I had to baby it too much while cooking because the beef kept sticking and burning. Probably shouldn't have used a cast iron. But it still tasted amazing...the next day! Also all my lemongrass broke down and was hard to find.

This dish is incredible. My husband and I have made it three times and it still knocks our socks off when we get to have that first bite. Watch the video!! It’s the best way to make sure you’re interpreting the recipe correctly and he gives little verbal tips as well. If spicy isn’t your thing go jalapeño instead of Serrano and leave out the chili flakes. I do recommend cilantro on top, personal preference. Thank you, Chef John!

This one is a keeper. I’ve made it 3 times now and I’ve done a few edits each time but overall it’s a great recipe. What I normally do is reduce the salt to just about 1/2 tsp and half the recipe but still add all the coconut milk in lieu of the water. I like my food spicy so it’s easy to add extra chili.

Not a fan. I love spicy. I have always roasted and ground my own spices, I even grow as much as I can myself. Unfortunately My wife has a LEGIT medical issue that prohibits her from eating spicy food so I only used 1 Serrano pepper for this dish. The heat was still farrr to high as all these flavors concentrate as it reduces. I wasn’t impressed with this.

Made this tonight - turned out fantastic, even though I forgot to put the garlic in the curry paste and didn't add it until halfway through the braise. Which I guess is the advantage of a 4-hour braise; still had plenty of time for the garlic to suffuse. 

One note: on Chef John's blog, this recipe has a tablespoon of kosher salt in the curry paste, whereas this version doesn't. I suspect that's an oversight - towards the end I tasted it and found the flavors really weren't coming together, so I added salt until things improved, which was about a tablespoon worth.

Easy to shred the beef if you aren't careful. Otherwise I love this dish when not over mixed!
