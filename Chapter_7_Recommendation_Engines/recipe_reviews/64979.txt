I have been making this recipe with a few changes for 30 odd years and my family loves it.  I use about 1/2 head of cabbage instead of the slaw mix,cut into bite size pieces, salt, pepper and a little garlic powder to taste. I also sprinkle parmesan cheese on top before I bake it. I put it in a 2 1/2 Qt casserole dish

This is a good base recipe but, and I know how everyone hates this, I had to change a few things.  First of all, I had a head of cabbage left over so I cut that up and sauteed it with olive oil, 1 chopped onion and 3 cloves of garlic, minced.  I used 2 lbs. ground chuck which I browned and drained.  Then I made 2 c. of white rice in a large stock pot.  Added the cabbage mixture, ground beef, 2 cans of soup, 1 can water, and 1 can of tomato sauce with the herbs and such already in there. and 1 envelope of dried onion soup mix.  I mixed it all together and let the cabbage soften a little more with the lid on.  It DISAPPEARED!  My husband and brother added a few dashes of hot sauce to theirs.  Definitely a winner and much, much easier than traditional cabbage rolls.

I loved it. Used some diced tomato and tomato sauce in place of the soup. Yummy! Like cabbage rolls without the work.

Very good when you don't want to do all the hard work that making cabbage rolls takes. 4 stars because I do like the taste of cabbage rolls better.

I have to say that my expectations were pretty low here...and I am not going to say that it is as good as my wife's Cabbage Rolls as they are killer. That said...while this needs some spice IMO, it is pretty dang good and it is hard to imagine anything being easier/faster to put together. A good one to keep in the back of your mind for those days when you want something a little different or don't have much time.

Excellent recipe! I especially liked the use of the coleslaw mix, which I was kind of sceptical about.. It was a fantastic dish! Everyone wanted more - I will never make traditional cabbage rolls again.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because of the lack of seasoning, I added paprika, dill weed, salt & pepper and a can of whole plum tomatoes with juices.  I plan to play with this one quite a bit, different meats, veggies etc.  Thanks for posting!

After reading reviews, I substituted Italian sausage for the beef, and a can of diced tomato and tomato sauce for the soup. I sprinkled Parmesan cheese on top. It was easy,delicious and no leftovers. My family loves stuffed cabbage rolls and this is a good alternative when I don't have the time to devote to that kind of project.

Okay but very very bland even though I had more to make it spicier. Would not make again.

Awesome recipe, allows you to customize your own spices for the added kick. Used half a cabbage instead of coleslaw mix as another reviewer mentioned. Great for beginners.

I made this and took the advice of TARAWVU. Adding onion soup mix and cooking the rice before is helpful. I had 1/2 a cabbage laying around so I opted for that vs the slaw mix. I have also used this as a base after I had leftover boiled dinner and did not know what to do with it. Using the cabbage, carrots and a few potatoes fit nicely into this recipe. This is a 3x winner in my house.

We love this recipe and it’s a staple during colder weather.  We do add extra spices for more flavour.  This time we used one can of cream of bacon soup, one tomato soup and ground chicken instead of beef.  It’s wonderful.

I used ground turkey and a can of v-8 juice instead of two cans of soup.  I added garlic and other spices to spice it up a bit and it was wonderful.

Traditional way my grandmother from Poland made it was to roll them up.   Couple of tips, parboil the rice.   Saute very finely diced onion in butter and add to the beef.   If you have some leftover leaves, chop and saute them also.  Instead of soup, we also used a couple of small cans of tomato paste mixed with one can of water (each can) and 1 tbs of vinegar.   

Also, if there are leaves left over, lay those on top of the rolls, helps to steam them.    Smaczne.

Good easy recipe. Browned my beef with Montreal seasoning and onion. Used tomato soup, diced can of tomatoes and about a 1/2 cup left over pizza sauce adding pizza sauce gives stuffed peppers or cabbage a little zing. We like it.

I took others advise and used salt, pepper and garlic while browning the beef and onions. Also added some hot sauce to the tomato soup and water. But some shredded cheddar cheese and bread crumbs on top. Also used minute rice as that's all I had on hand. Very tasty, even my picky husband enjoyed it. Will definitely make again.

To spice this recipe up, I use 1 11 oz can tomatoes with jalepeno pepper and 1 15 oz can tomato sauce withsuggested water.  Also added chopped green pepper.  I pre-soaked the rice and micro-wave on high for 20 - 30 min.  Save 
heating up the kitchen

I was surprised at how tasty this was, especially after a day or two.  I was looking for a way to use up a half a head of cabbage from St. Patty's day.  I'm not that fond of cabbage, but this recipe caught my eye because of the tomato and meat.  I made some changes because of what I had on hand.  I used ground turkey, seasoned with salt, pepper and cumin, and added garlic along with the chopped cabbage.  I only had one can of tomato soup so added some left-over tomato sauce.  And the best thing was that it was so easy to make.  I may actually buy cabbage in the future so I can make it again.

This reminded me and hubs of that San Francisco treat, with the coleslaw replacing the vermicelli.  It had a nice crunch and overall was a good dish with some modifications in the way it's put together.  I browned the ground beef and onions in a chef's pan while the rice cooked in a separate saucepan according to package instructions for 4 servings.  I added seasoning which was lacking based on other reviews.  A small palm full of herbs de provence, some crushed garlic, and dashes of salt and pepper.  I drained the fat from the cooked meat, then added a 15 oz can of diced tomatoes and a 15 oz can of organic tomato sauce.  No need for the can of water.  Just added the cooked rice to the mixture, then tossed in the coleslaw.  For a nice presentation, I placed a cabbage leaf on each plate and filled with the Golomke.  In hindsight, I wish I would have added some caraway seeds.  Maybe next time if I make it again.

I have made this twice.  Easy-peasy and delish!  I did add a dash of nutmeg to the soup mixture, it gave the cabbage/meat a good pop of flavor...Hubby had me add a breadcrumb & cheddar cheese topping, which was very good as well, gave the dish some crunch.

I made this in Instapot (35minutes on stew setting) instead of layering and baking it. I also used brown rice and leftover spaghetti sauce instead of the white rice tomato soup. It tastes pretty good. Texture is good with the brown rice.

I am Slovak, so we make our cabbage rolls (Holubky) a little bit differently. I used this recipe as a base for the one I grew up making. So, I cannot give an apples-to-apples comparison. I will say this:  I still prefer the cabbage rolls, but this is quick and easy

I always follow the recipe exactly when I make something for the first time and did so with this.  As others stated, it was pretty bland, but my husband and I both liked it.  Next time I believe I will add onion salt, pepper, and diced green bell pepper. I'm not sure about anything else, but will start with that. Thank you for the recipe!

this was ok. I loved that it was easy to make, but I think next time I'd use pork and maybe add some garlic... the original recipe is lacking flavor. I only gave this 1 star- Reason, taste was lacking and if my family doesn't eat the dish on the day I make it or finish leftovers in the fridge then it's not keeper in its' current form.

After reading the reviews I did what another reviewer did and substituted italian sausage  for the beef. Italian seasonings, diced tomatoes and two cans of tomato sauce. Instead of uncooked rice I used leftover rice from Panda Express. Took  microplane and grated fresh parm onto the top. Casserole came out great. I think next time I will use a pound and a half of sausage to give it a meatier texture.

Seriously, one of the best comfort food ideas.  I am on Weight Watchers, and may have taken it down a notch.  However, am delighted with the results and must have seconds!  The bones of this recipe can take you where you want to go!  For me I used the 98% fat free ground chicken, put cumin and caraway sees on top of the rice.  Cooked the chicken with A LOT of garlic and black pepper.  Used hot sauce, diced tomatoes, tomato sauce.  Added a cup of water after stirring everything up.  Put the oven on 200 for another half hour.  So  good!

This was just okay. As per other reviewers, it truly does need seasonings to avoid being bland.

Made this for a quick dinner for when my daughter was visiting.  A big hit!  Only change I made was replacing tomato soup with diced tomatoes which I had in the pantry.

I really enjoyed it - added salt and pepper to taste, etc. It really reminds me of the cabbage rolls my grandmother made (still makes?) when I was a kid. That said, I don't think there was enough soup in it. Going to tweak this in the future!

I thought it was rather bland.  My husband didn't really like it.  I don't think I'd try it again.  Maybe it would be better with tomato sauce and diced tomatoes and some garlic.

The only change I made was to add garlic to the meat mixture and would also add salt and pepper next time.

Loved it. Easy to make and taste was good. I cook for elderly people so I did boil the cabbage for about 10 min to make sure it was soft before everything was layered.

This hotdish was even better reheated as a leftover! I used tomato bisque soup and brown basmati rice. Delicious!

Didn’t use condensed tomato soup. I used a can of diced tomatoes with onion and peppers. Turned out great. Use your imagination and take the basic recipe asa guide.

Easy recipe,  but no flavor. I give it 2 stars because it is a good base to something better. More seasoning is needed.

Loved it. Added an extra can of water by accident so compensated by adding more rice to get the ratio of 1:2 rice to liquid.  Worked fine! Also added more salt and seasoning to account for lost flavor after diluting it with the extra water.  Used a large dutch oven because I doubled the recipe and it worked great.

This was not what I thought it would be.  The cabbage was barely tasted, the soup a bit overwhelming.  It feeds a fair number but noone liked it. Noone hated it either, but I will not make this again.
