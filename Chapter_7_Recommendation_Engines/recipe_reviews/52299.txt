This is my recipe, but I got married and have a new log-in name! A few notes, based on other reviews and my subsequent experiences with the recipe: YES - follow package directions for the rice noodles ... when I created this recipe I was buying noodles from an Asian market and could not read the text on the package.  You can actually even use linguini or fettuccini if you don't have access to rice noodles (not quite as good, but this is obviously an Americanized recipe anyway).  You do not have to sautee the noodles before tossing them with the sauce  -- I too have problems with them sticking to the pan and have pretty much just eliminated this step.  Finally, when I have it on hand, I also substitute lime juice for the lemon, though lemon works just fine.  A side of shredded cabbage and julienne carrots/cucumbers provides a refreshing break from what can be a heavy dish (especially with all that sauce - but I love it!). Hope that helps!

OK...too peanut-ty and lacked some depth.  I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and reduced the peanut butter (I used smooth ground natural with no added salt/sugar) to 3/4 cup, and reduced the brown sugar to 1/2 cup but it was still too much. I also used 3 cloves of fresh garlic, pressed, chili paste instead of cayenne pepper, and lime juice instead of lemon.  Here's some helpful hints that I will try the next time:  don't cook peanut sauce too early...it goes from that nice smooth sauce to a gloppy, thick mess that doesn't want to stir through the noodles.  Don't skimp on the oil when sauteing the noodles.  I'd never made rice noodles before and mine ended up all clumped together (I didn't soak them for a full hour, either).  Skip adding the extra peanuts.  Julienne carrots instead of shredding to add some crunch.  Maybe increase the lime juice, chili paste and add some fish sauce...give it a try!  Thanks Sarah for sharing.

This is easy and Absolutely Fabulous.  My husband and I thought it was better than what we get at the Thai restaurants we frequent.  I substituted curry paste for paprika to good effect.

This was absolutely delicious. I soaked the noodles in water for a little over an hour. I didn't have peanut oil, but seasame oil worked just as well. I cooked the sauce in a large pot, and sauteed the vegetables in a large pan. The noodles were plenty soft and so I just added them to the sauce while I was cooking the vegetables. (I didn't have a wok) I added the veggies to the large pot and stirred everything up and served. Absolutely yummy the next day as leftovers too. Restaurant quality. I've also cut the recipe in half and used linguine noodles, which made it all come together really quickly.

Wonderful! Just like the savory Seattle Phad Thai I used to get years ago (minus the tamarind, which I will add next time)!! A few caveats: I used a can of coconut milk in place of the 1 c. milk, and only about 1/3 c. brown sugar, despite using Adam's natural chunky PB which is not very sweet; I also used Asian chili sauce, not cayenne. For veggies I used 1 pkg firm tofu, snowpeas, onion greens and shredded cabbage. Everything came together so quickly and easily & angel hair pasta was just great with this; we'll be making this recipe again and again in the years to come!

I have found that Phad Thai is a tricky thing.  To get a truly authentic taste, it is necessary to use authentic ingredients.  However, I, for one, don't usually have all of these ingredients on hand.  So, I've been looking for a recipe that closely approximates the flavors without requiring all of the traditional ingredients.  This recipe comes the closest of any that I've tried.  It was too sweet (and I only used 1 c. of sugar to begin with!) and I add a bit more lemon juice to give it that tang.  Also, don't be skimpy with the cayenne; it takes at least 1/4 t. or more to get the right heat.  I will definitely make this dish again and I'll probably keep tweaking it.  One last thing--this recipe makes an absolutely enormous amount of sauce!  We barely used half of it.  But, it's a good leftover, too.  =)

My daughter and husband loved this dish.  I did however, make some changes based on others' reviews.  I lowerd the amount of peanut butter and sugar to 3/4c and used lime instead of lemon.  Great dish! I will make it again.

I didn't think this recipe was that great.  Submerging the noodles in hot water for 1 hour was WAY too long.  The noodles turned out way to soft.  I did cut the brown sugar and peanut butter in half like the other reviewers suggested and I thought the sauce was very good.  Not sure that I will make this again.

I can not possibly serve this to my family.  I might as well add jelly to create a new recipe called peanut butter and jelly noodles.  I'm sorry but this was terrible.

My husband and I are big thai food fans.  This was my first attempt at making pad thai.  It was good.  I've since found that the recipes that call for fish sauce, ginger, and garlic, and no peanut butter, are much more authentic in taste. I also like to add tofu stir fried in egg...thank you anyway.

Pretty darn delicious.  I've made it twice now and served it to company.  I do cut the sauce in half.

I love Phad Thai, but when I made this it didn't resemble what I am used to having in the restaurants.  It was way too sweet and it had way too much peanut butter.  I'm still learning to cook Thai food, so it was a learning experience that hopefully I can grow from.

Too much peanut butter and too much sugar. Also, it needed more spice. I'm sorry but I won't be making this again. If I did, I would recommend adding more milk/soy sauce to thin the peanut butter sauce out, using a fraction of the brown sugar, and adding frozen stir fry veggies for a variety of texture and color.

I'm sorry, but this turned out pretty badly.  I followed the recipe, plus a couple of suggestions to cut down the peanut butter, and I still found that this came out very glutenous and sticky and way too sweet!  I feel cheated that I wasted my money on the ingredients plus wasted the ingredients themselves!

This recipe would have been a huge mess with all that peanut butter!  Good thing I read the review and cut WAY back!  Nice ingredients though besides that!  Didn't have the peanuts so left those out.

I agree that this was not like the Thai restaurant I go to but it was similar to their peanut sauce. I made it exactly as posted and rated it at 4 stars. It was way too peanut buttery for my liking so I had to add an extra 1/4 cup milk and 1/8 cup soy sauce. I thinly sliced a large chicken breast, baked it then added it and the resulting chicken broth to the sauce. It became 5 stars! Husband already requested that I make it again. (He never says that.) I will reduce the peanut butter next time and re-taste it before adjusting it again.

I have used this recipe for about 5 years now.  The only thing I've added recently was a dash of fish sauce to give it a bit more of an authentic Thai flavor.  Other than that, I've used the recipe as-is and it is still one of the most demanded dishes in the house.  Even my usually "meat-and-potatoes" in-laws ask for it!

This is the best Phad Thai. Instead of peanut butter try it with almond butter. It is so good.

Very good recipe!  It has a very peanutty taste, so if you don't like peanuts, this is not the recipe for you.  Delicious with fresh lime squeezed on top!  I used sesame oil instead of peanut oil, as some reviewers suggested, because I was unable to find peanut oil at the store.  I made a half recipe, and there was probably more sauce than was needed.  When I make it next time, I think I'll use 1 1/2 times the noodles along with the amount of sauce that the recipe calls for.

Way, way too much sauce and too sweet. I think it might be good if you halved the sauce and then halved the peanut butter and sugar again and added salt and more soy sauce. I would cook the noodles half way and then pan fry them till they are done. This way the noodles will not be too mushy. I might make again to see if it can be good. Good luck, but do not follow the recipe “as is” you will be disappointed!

This was delicious. As previous reviewers suggestes, I used about half the brown sugar and only about 1/2 cup peanut butter. I love cilantro so I added some as well as about two tablespoons of sesame oil.  I made this for a dinner party and everyone LOVED it. I'll make it again and again.

I just tried this and am eating it as I type, and it's excellent. It is definitely a little sweeter than the pad thai I've tried in restaurants in the US but as a sweet tooth I like that! I think I went a little heavy on the cayenne pepper though.

I wish I had read the other reviews before I tried this recipe.  The sauce came out way too sweet & goopy.  My noodles stuck to the bottom of the pan and then never did fully cook.  When I tried to mix the sauce and the noodles, the sauce was so thick that I could barely stir it.  My roommate, in an attempt to help, poured some water into it thus turning the dish into Pad Thai Soup.  It ended up being quite a disaster and barely edible.  I do think that it has potential and may make it again but with a bit of modifications based on the other reviews here.

This recipe ROCKS! I have tried so many times to make this dish, with bad results, but this recipe was a perfest reproduction. Advice: Unless 6 or 7 people are eating, cut it in 1/2, I also put corn and broccoli in it and used crunchy peanutbutter with excellent results! You cannot screw this up!

Excellent! My family gobbled this up...   Here are my alterations: I reduced the peanut butter to 1 cup, it was plenty for sure, and used lime juice instead of lemon which I highly recommend, so tasty!  I also ran out of soy sauce so I used teriyaki sauce instead and omitted the sugar.  Lastly I used about 1 tsp of curry powder because I was out of paprika too.  My husband said, put this one on the heavy rotation!

My husband LOVED this dish!  I took others advice and modified the peanut butter and sugar.  I used 1 cup of peanut butter and 3/4 cup of brown sugar. I wanted more veggies so I added mushrooms and bok choy!

This is one of my favorite recipes.  I have made it several times at the request of friends.  Go easy on the cayenne, most people don't like it.  Also, use 1/3 less peanut butter than suggested or it will be too overbearing.  I always end up putting in a little extra water so it doesn't get too thick and clumpy and alot of extra lime juice.  I didn't have peanut oil so I used half veg. half sesame oil.  Only used 1 c. brown sugar.

This was OK, but like many other reviewers I would say to cut WAY down on the peanut butter and cut back on the brown sugar.  It was overwhelmingly peanut-y and a bit sweet for my tastes.  Also, I say save the raw chopped/ground peanuts to sprinkle on top at the end.  Otherwise would be good with a bit of tweaking.

Yummy! I've never made anything like this before, we have so much leftover! I didn't realize how big a pot I'd need. I took the advice of others and used only 1/2 cup peanut butter and half the amount of brown sugar and it turned out great. we also accidently forgot the cayenne pepper but didn't notice until we were done. I'll make this many more times! Maybe add some tofu next time...

This was ok but not as good as I'd hoped. I soaked the noodles for about 20 mins as the packet instructed, and they turned out fine. The peanut sauce was quite tasty but very very thick. I kept adding half-and-half until it was the right consistency. Husband's verdict was 'nice but weird.' I probably won't make this again.

Well I'm not sure.  This tasted JUST like the pad thai at a restaurant I go to, and it was therefore very good.  But it was a lot of work and really filling, you only need to eat a tiny bit.  Then again it wasn't actually HARD or finicky, just time consuming.  I would say make this when you have time, if you like pad thai, and don't eat much of anything during the day beforehand.  The peanut sauce is very good and could be used for other dishes.  Notes: Used 1 cup brown sugar, which was plenty with regular peanut butter (i.e. sweetened); used plain old bean sprouts, have no idea what "mung" bean sprouts are.  It is not too spicy, follow the guide lines - 2 tablespoons sounds a lot but it MAKES a lot.

This recipe tastes very authentic!  I like that it is completely vegetarian and still tastes like it came from the best Thai restaurant.  It is also very easy to make.

Do not add more peanut butter lol. I love peanut butter and i added 1/2 cup extra! Needless to say i ate and powered through my brave experiment. It wasnt horrible just very peanut buttery. Cut back on the PB and it would have been really yummy. Thankyou for sharing recipe.

I didn't read the reviews before making this, but I agree with all the people saying to cut back on the peanut butter and brown sugar. My partner loved how peanut-buttery it was, though, so that's just to your taste. Some people recommend fish sauce, but that would defeat the title, "Vegetarian Phad Thai." I want to try this again but with less PB and sugar and maybe more soy sauce and lemon. I think ginger would be an excellent addition. Follow package instructions with your noodles. They should only take ten minutes. One thing I liked about this recipe was that I could just pull some of the cooked noodles aside and add soy sauce and chicken to it for my non-vegetarian finicky son.

It was nice to find a recipe that does not use fish sauce.  I did like others suggested and used less peanut butter (used only 1/2 c.) and limes instead of lemons, but I felt that it was really thick and peanuty when I plated it.  So I squeezed on some ketchup added some more milk, hot sauce and red pepper flakes and it turned out alot better. I will definitely make this again!

What an excellent recipe!  Made it with leftover rice instead of noodles and used 2 red thai peppers instead of cayenne.  Added a small can of water chestnuts for crunch and cut back on the peanut butter and sugar (about half of each).  Thanks for a great meal!

This was very good. I followed some advice from the others who made it and used 1/3 cup of brown sugar. I don't think I made this dish exactly as directed but it's still really good and is a good 1st asian dish for me. I highly recommend a Wok because the large sauce pan didn't make it as pretty. I'm going to add this recipe to my cookbook. Thanks for the recipe!

I've made this dish many, many times since discovering it on this website and wanted to say thank you for the great posting, as well as all the other user's suggestions.  It makes a great dish that all three of my picky eaters (2 kids and 1 husband) all agree on.

This was the first recipe I used on allrecipes.com, and we still love it.  Is pretty heavy and sweet, but worth it.  We make a whole batch, then add it to recipes in smaller amounts.  I love it because I can't eat fish, and my husband likes the extra peanut flavor.  Follow the directions on your noodles.  I boil water and pour it over the noodles until they are pliable but not completely soft, this helps them not stick. We spice ours up with chili paste and use lime, not lemon. This is still my favorite recipe here.

Great recipe - one of the best Thai recipes I've ever had. Just as another reviewer recommended, I also substituted curry paste for paprika - it was delicious. The next time I make this I might try reducing the amount of peanut butter to lighten the dish.

I made a half recipe and that was perfect for four.  I didn't find there was too much sauce.  I did substitute agave syrup for the brown sugar (lower glycemic index).  I found it rather bland though.  Maybe my peanut butter isn't as peanutty as others because I didn't find the peanut flavor over powering either.  I jazzed it up a bit with a little ground ginger and some fish sauce but still didn't really ring my bell.  Sorry.

My husband's new favorite.  And I can't get him to tell me any dish he loves, but he loves this one!  Richer than what you normally get in a restaurant.

I would prefer less peanut butter and brown sugar.

pretty good recipe. I made it twice and used flat noodles the second time and I think it looked better. I reduced the amount of sauce the second time but had to make more later as hubby liked it more with extra sauce. Apart from that, I removed the sauce and stir fried the veggies on high for about 2 mins. Served the noodles first, sauce on top and finally crunchy veggies. Raw shredded cabbage is a must I think. Thanks for a good recipe.

I have made this several times, and love it.  I prefer the flat rice noodle sticks, cut peanut butter to one scant cup, also cut the brown sugar to 3/4 cup, lemon juice to 1/4 cup.  I like it spicy to use quite a bit of cheyenne pepper and also serve cilantro with the lime wedges for added garnich. As another reviewer suggested the sauce could be cut in half and still be wonderful.

Delicious! If you're not vegetarian, and are looking for a little more meat, I added a package of mini frozen shrimp.

Excellent.  Do NOT overcook the noodles, or they turn to mush.  Found this out the hard way :-(

I thought it was a little too rich, but my husband loved it. Next time I'll cut down the amount of peanut butter a little in favor of peanuts

This came out so delicious.  It was just like what you get at a Thai restaurant, and it was easy to make.

Great recipe.  Big hit with roomies, especially the peanut sauce.  Keep some aside for those who like extra on the side.  Follow instructions that come with the rice noodles.

I made this once at home and my boyfriend and I loved it.  I tried to make it again for a large group but I think I mucked it up somewhere cause the sauce was way too runny... but if done right it tastes like the closest thing to the Phad Thai at my favourite authentic Thai restaurant.

Very peanuty and a little too much lemon juice.  But it definatly got eaten.  I used "natural" creamy peanut butter and got absolutly perfect peanut sauce.

A very flavourful dish...much enjoyed by my husband and myself.  However, although I omitted the cayenne pepper because of my kids (2 & 1)they still thought I was trying to posison them and wouldn't touch the noodles (which they ordinairly love).  I don't know what there problem was but something to consider if you have young children.

A little too peanut-y for our tastes, but we still enjoyed it.  I think I might try it again with a little less peanut butter next time.
