Pretty good.  I omitted the extra teaspoon of salt and instead of cooking fresh garlic, I just added wet garlic to the cheese mix.  I didnâ€™t have a 14 oz. jar of pasta sauce, so I mixed what I had: 8 oz. can of tomato sauce, 6 oz. can of tomato paste, and 1 Tbsp. of dried Italian seasoning.  I fit the 8 roll-ups in a 9x9 square dish and as a main dish, this recipe made 2.5 servings in this house.

I've actually made this recipe twice on our newly adopted "Meatless Monday".  I used fresh baby spinach the second and just laid a single line down the middle over the cheese mixture.  I get the 8oz block of cheese and use half in the mixture and use the rest to cover the rolls.  My children love it

Trying this for the first time. Looking pretty yummy so far! I substituted cottage cheese for ricotta and added 1 lb. of lean ground beef. Because I added more ingredients I used ten noodles. Putting a 1/4 cup in each roll made it a perfect portion. This is super easy to make and good to make ahead of time so I can pop in the oven when we are ready to eat!

The spinach and ricotta was a little overwhelming. Next time I might add some more garlic to the mix and maybe some sugar. I had to thicken the sauce with tomato paste in order to get the right look to it. Overall was still very good.

Surprised how delicious this was! Maybe the garlic gave it something extra. I usually layer the cheese and meat sauce together but liked it this way. Nice and creamy was my husband's comment. I used a little less spinach than called for.
Also - i chose this recipe for its size. However, the cheese mixture only filled 7 noodles.

This is a family favorite; my husband has been begging for this meal for a couple of months. Some recipes call for onions, but I have to leave them out due to an allergy. Try it, and you won't be disappointed.

Came out really tasty! I served this dish for a family new year's party and they were gone in a matter of minutes! I opted for whole wheat pasta noodles instead though. Will be making this again for sure!

Will make this or something like it again...added parsley, pepper and one egg to the ricotta mixture.  To dry spinach I squeezed it between two dinner plates and that worked well. Just added garlic powder this time because I did not have time to saute. Wished I would have used 9 noodles because the mixtures made enough for nine rollups, used a 11x7 pan and put a little sauce in bottom first, sprinkled mozzarella on the top, too.

Found this a little salty, so I will probably reduce the amount of salt added the next time I make it. My husband asked for seconds which is a very good sign! Simple and easy to make-it's being added to our meal rotation for sure!

I liked it a lot, but my husband thought there was too much spinach.  I'm making it again tonight, replacing the spinach with 1 lb. of ground beef.  He'll probably like that a lot better.  :)

Very good option for Meatless Monday!  It took a little time to prepare, but it was not difficult. The presentation was very nice.  I prepared everything according to the recipe.  I used Newman's marinara sauce for ease of a "weeknight meal"
 
Leftovers were even better.  I'll be making this again.

This is the second time I have made this dish. This time I wanted to use the whole box of noodles and small container of ricotta so I used extra garlic, salt and ricotta cheese. I also added mozzarella to the top with the Parmesan cheese. It was delicious!!! This recipe takes a little time to prepare, but very tasty!!

Original version is pretty good, but making changes to make it our own.  The last version we really liked, probably won't change much more.  Used a blend of Italian cheeses instead of mozzarella, added dash of black pepper and red pepper flakes to the filling, used a little less spinach.

Very easy! I doubled the riccota (cuz I love it) and added an egg (seemed like the thing to do). I also used fresh spinach and sprinkled the top with mozzeralla cheese before baking. Yum, Thanks for the post  Chickentarian :)

Very good. I doubled the recipe and used 8 oz of fresh spinach. I put a small amount of sauce on the bottom of the pan first. I added an egg and parsley to the ricotta mixture. On top of the rolls I covered with sauce and more Mozzarella cheese and Parmesan cheese.

Loved it. Soaked the noodles in hot water as one reviewer suggested, which worked out great when I needed an extra noodle. Added parsley and an egg as one reviewer suggested and put in a little onion powder and oregano for extra flavor. Will definitely make again.

Great recipe as is.  Made my own sauce, as I do not do jarred sauces.  Made the mistake of using low fat ricotta the second time- do not do this, as taste and texture suffered.  Use full fat cheese and eat a smaller portion.  Quick, elegant meal  to serve at parties.

I liked the recipe but I must admit I added a few things to make it a bit meaty and to use up ingredients I had at hand that were in dire need to be used. First, I did not use cottage cheese only mozzarella. Second, I cooked some remnant Italian sausage I had (less than 1/4 lb) and diced 2 bacon strips and cooked them with the sausage and garlic. Third, I added a bit canned diced tomatoes that I had leftover. In terms of the directions,  I followed the recipe to a T. It came out excellent and went well with crusty bread. Will make it again!

This was very tasty.. I followed the recipe as written. The dish was somewhat dry, but I can't blame this on the recipe since I made my own marinara sauce & it was thicker  than jarred. Next time I will make a less dense sauce, or double the sauce I used, or "doctor" a jarred sauce by adding  spices.  I also soaked the noodles in hot water for 20 minutes rather than boil them, so they were firmer than if boiled.  This was a plus, in my opinion, since it made the noodles easier to handle and serve.  I will definitely make this again.

I love lasagna in this guise. So perfectly sized. Have one or three...whatever. I usually make my own tomato sauce/marinara. Works w/ an alfredo sauce as well. I've used spicy sausage for protein/flavor/heat.

Will I make it again: 
YES! It will defiantly make this recipe again. It was simple and easy to make. 

Did I change anything: I added my extra mozzarella cheese to the top, instead of Parisian cheese

Iâ€™d use a little less spinach next time. Maybe 7 oz since itâ€™s a family meal for like kids.

I had to make some changes due to what was available at the time:
I used 14 ounces of fresh spinach, sautÃ©ed.  
 To the sauce I added a half pound of cooked ground beef, some Italian seasoning and  oregano 
 1 cup of Cottage cheese in place of ricotta 
2 tsp of jar-type  minced garlic in place of  of fresh garlic
      ( added to the beef as it cooked)

I made one batch with this recipe but added mushrooms and egg to ricotta mixture, excellent! My daughter and I loved this version. Then made another batch with beef minus spinach plus egg which the boys loved!! I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll made regular lasagna again, very good recipe.

I made this and just used fresh spinach instead of frozen. I also just mixed the raw minced garlic (to save time) in the ricotta and added a bit of fresh parsley to the mix.

This recipe was delicious! I did make some changes based on the ingredients I had, instead of fresh garlic I used powdered and for the cheese topping I used a blend of mozzarella and parmesan. Also as another reviewer mentioned I put a layer of pasta sauce on the bottom of the baking dish and a line of pasta sauce over the spinach cheese mixture on top of the noodle. Turned out excellent and I'll be making again and again!

I didn't have ricotta cheese and replaced with sour cream. Tasted great!
