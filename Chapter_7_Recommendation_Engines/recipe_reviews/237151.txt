Very nice! I added an extra tablespoon of apple cider vinegar, and about a quarter tablespoon of fresh ginger. I can almost feel it kicking my cold in the butt!

Coming down with what feels like a cold I decided to give this a try. Easy enough to make followed recipe. Does not taste bad at all sweet with the vinegar twang. Only gave it 4 stars because I had nothing to compare by. Will update if this remedy actually works!

I was a little skeptical about the taste of this drink but turned out to be good. Sweet and quite enjoyable. This drink definitely helped to unblock my sinuses. This is a natural recipe that works and there is nothing better than that.

Looking for a tea to help my wife with her cold and sore throat I found this. Some what weirded out by the garlic, I was skeptical that my wife would even try it. However, I bought the stuff and made it anyways. Long story short, my wife said that it wasn't terrible, just a bit strong. I did remove the garlic pieces but left cinnamon stick inside the cup. Today she looked and felt so much better. Was it the tea? Who knows, but I will definitely keep this recipe for the next cold. Thanks allrecipes!!
