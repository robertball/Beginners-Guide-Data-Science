Family Favorite Turkey Chili Haiku: "Thought this would be blah, but it turned out really good. Better leftovers." I really expected this chili to be dull, due to it not having cumin or oregano, along w/ so little chili powder, so I tasted it at the halfway point and it was great ... even better when we served it that evening, but even BETTER the next day. Followed the recipe exactly as written, even neither draining nor rinsing the beans which I always do. W/ cheese, sour cream and Fritos, it will surely become a family favorite. (OK, mine needed some Sriracha.)

I absolutely love this one! My first attempt at turkey chili, but I had such a good feeling that I doubled most of the ingredients. I used red pepper instead of green- personal taste. I didn't double the onions nor the beans as I was going for more of a tomatoey taste.  Doubled the turkey, diced tomato, tomato sauce, basil, garlic. I had enough to share w co-workers the following day, and the family at home. So delicious! Ate it with shredded Mexican blend cheese, dollup of sour cream and leftover toasted hamburger buns- the way to go!! Will definitely make this often!!

It was easy to make. I'll make it again. Next time I'd add 1 1/2 lb of turkey. I forgot to pick up cheese to sprinkle on top.  It was delicious.

Love this easy and simple recipe for chili! I used a pound of ground beef in addition to the ground turkey (my husband loves his meat!) and added another can of sauce for the right proportions. I also added a can of black beans. Topped it with some cheese before serving and we both loved it!

Best chili recipe! My husband could not stop raving about it. I added 2 more cloves of garlic. It could use a bit more spice for my taste so next time I may add a little extra.

My Wife always makes the chili in our house. Well, she is working this weekend so I took advantage of the opportunity to have the kitchen all to myself and try my hand at it. Very good recipe. Simple ingredients and crock pot makes it even easier to cook. I did make a small change to the recipe by using only 1 can of beans and that being chili beans. Thank you for this recipe and making this guy feel like a superhero today!

I used 1 can of dark kidney beans and 1 can of light kidney beans. Next time I will season the meat a little more, but other than that, it was really good!

I didn't make any changes and my husband and I both loved it. A great way to use leftover turkey!

My family and I enjoyed this recipe. I cut down in half the chili powder and was still a little bit spicy. Very practical recipe for a busy day. We ate it with white steamed rice and a dollop of sour cream.
