I made a partial recipe of this using fresh mushrooms rather than canned.  We thought this was good, but the sauce wasn't as satisfyingly rich as we would have liked.  It was easy to make, and so that is definitely a plus.  Thanks for the idea of this recipe!

Not bad. The sauce is very light. Best with noodles

I really doctored this recipe, but it turned out to be delicious. I used 6 boneless skinless chicken thighs and cut them into 1 inch pieces. I sautéed onions and mushrooms in the butter, then added a stalk of celery with the leaves and a 4 oz can of chopped green chiles (I know it isn't for Marsala, but it was good). In a bowl, I mixed 2 cans of mushroom soup with 1/2 cup light cream, 3/4 cup dry sherry (I didn't have Marsala on hand) and 3/4 cup vegetable stock, and a half cup of shredded Mexican cheese. Then mixed sauce with sautéed veggies and chicken, and baked in 350 degree oven for 1 hour (no foil). Served over noodles! Yummy!

Flavor was good, but the sauce needed to be thicker. Would doctor it up if I make it again.
