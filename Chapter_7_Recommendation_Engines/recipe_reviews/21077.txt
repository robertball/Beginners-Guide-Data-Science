I did not have high expectations for this dish...I was just looking for a fast and easy recipe.  This was awesome!! However, I made many alterations to the dish due to time contraints.  First, I heated the olive oil and browned some garlic and minced onion. I then added 1 cup chicken and half green and half red bell pepper, chopped.  When the cubed chicken was cooked through, I added 1 8oz container of cream cheese with chives and 1 can Italian stewed tomatoes.  This addition not only thinned the sauce, as others have stated, but also, it allowed me to eliminate the basil, parsley and other spices.  Served over the penne pasta and viola!! Dinner was a hit (to my surprise).  Sprinkled some dry parsley and parmesean cheese over all for presentation.  Great recipe Toni (even altered) and will make again!!

This was a great start to a wonderful dinner. I changed a few things because it had quite a few bad reviews. I added 1 8oz package of mushrooms, 1 red pepper sliced,fresh green beans, 1 cup of milk,and 4 cloves of garlic. I also used low fat cream cheese and dried spices because I didnt have any on hand. My dinner was great! The recipe is to thick without the milk. My fiancee is picky and he really enjoyed it. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Amazing! I am now inspired to grow my own herbs for cooking.  The fresh basil, oregano and parsley are neccessary for this recipe to work.  I was a little scared after reading some of the reviews but it was great!  The only thing I did different was used low fat cream cheese and substituted 2 Roma tomatoes.  I served it with grilled chicken soaked in a red wine marinade. I am not a very good cook but this was delicious.  My fiance loved it!  What impresses me is being able to make a fantastic meal in under $5.00
Thanks Toni-great job

I liked this (as did my 5 year old)....I added a finely diced onion with the garlic and sauteed first then added the herbs and two diced fresh tomatoes.  I also used low-fat cream cheese.  I didn't think the sauce was too thick (it held the herbs and stuff nicely to the penne) -- until it cooled off....just add a splash of milk to thin.

I really loved this recipe. At first I wasn't too sure about tomatoes and cream cheese. But all the different ingredients really work. I did use canned Italian tomatoes and added onions with the garlic and used the chive and onion cream cheese in the tub. But those were the only changes I made. Oh, I did add fake crab to the mixture and it was so good. I am glad that I overlooked my thinking and made this. I will definitely make it again.

This was delicious and we'll definitely be making it again! We added mushrooms and onions to the mix and a spoon of pesto. A little seasoning also to give the sauce more of a flavor. 1/2 cream cheese and then used 4 oz of a delicious chive & onion sour cream. Oh, and after the pasta was added to the sauce, we threw in a handful of shredded mozzarella that melted in nicely. Yum!!

THis pasta sounds great on paper, but it didn't translate too well to the table. The basil and oregano overpowered the dish and the cream sauce was very thick. Maybe a few alterations to the recipe would help it. Otherwise, i wouldn't plan on this one for a dinner party.

Very good and easy to make.  It's important to use fresh herbs, as they really enhance the flavor.  (Plus they make the kitchen smell wonderful.)  I added chicken marinated in lemon juice and garlic, and the tang of the chicken was a delicious set off against the cream sauce.

I made this with seasonings that weren't fresh.  I also used Italian style stewed tomatoes and half the amount of cream cheese.  The results?  While it didn't taste bad, it was kind of tasteless (probably my fault for using dried seasonings).  Even though I used the liquid from the tomatoes and half the cream cheese, my roommate complained that it was too thick.

This was very tasty! I did change it up a bit. I  added 2 tablespoons of butter w/ the oil and sauteed some onions in there w/ the garlic. I only had dry spices, so I just used those to taste along w/ some crushed pepper flakes. After adding the cream cheese (I used light) I added milk (fat free) to smooth it out and get it to the consistancy I wanted. Instead of basil, I used a few spoonfuls of pesto that I had on hand, which gave it great flavor. At the end I did stir in a bit of grated parmesan cheese along with the chopped tomatoes (I used 2). The tomatoes were a nice addition in this. I would definately make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I added extra garlic and added minced onion and red onion flakes, used dry herbs (1tbs oregano and basil, didn't measure parley), and used a can of petite dice tomatoes. While that was simmering, I cooked in some shrimp. The cream cheese I used was fat free and did not have any problems with my sauce being too thick. I know the leftovers will be even better.

I swapped the measurements of oregano and parsley to 1/4 cup chopped parsley and 2 tablespoons chopped oregano. 1/4 cup of oregano is a LOT for my tastes! With that change this is a tasty comfort dish.

Perhaps I shouldn't rate since I don't prefer creamy sauces, but cream cheese is not necessary for this recipe, it is plenty greasy and good with only high quality oil and other ingredients. I minced my garlic with coarse salt in my herb pot which made a paste and spread evenly throughout. Very tasty both ways, too milky fatty for me with the cheese.

recipe as is...is goodish. I added juice of one lemon, 1 tbsp of italian dressing, cut the cream cheese in half and added 1/4 cup of milk, 1/4 cup sour cream and a some Parmesan. I prefer a really flavorful dish which is what it became. The kids like bland, so if you're serving just kids..leave it be. If you are serving adults, I suggest doctoring it a bit.

Starting out positively, my kids ate it without complaining.  I added milk to thin out the sauce.  It wasn't at all what I was expecting.  I probably won't make this again, unfortunately.  It sounded good but didn't turn out all that well.

I made this as suggested by other reviewers- with a can of diced tomatoes and some chopped onions.  Turned out well.  If you like cream cheese, you'll like it, since that's the dominant flavor.  I only used about 5oz of it and that was enough.  It's not to die for, but it's good.  I'll make it again.

Tasty. A little too cream cheesy. Made a few additions: 3 chopped green onions, to the sautee. Then once onions were tender, I added 1/4 c of the pasta water, and 1/4 c chicken broth. Kids even ate it and asked for seconds!

This was great!  Both kids ate it up without any complaints and it took less than 15 min to throw together. I didn't have the fresh herbs so decided to use pesto instead. I also used canned tomatoes and thought the recipe would definitely have been too thick without it.  Next time I will add the chicken.

Way too cream cheesy for my taste.  I used lo-fat cream cheese and dried spices along with a can of diced tomatoes to add liquid as others suggested.  I then tried to add milk and butter to try to tame the cream cheese taste, but didn't succeed.

Simply scrumptous! Didn't have fresh herbs on hand so I used dried at 1 Tbs. each. Worked just fine! Added cubed chicken for a one-pot meal. Does require thinning at the end as others mentioned. I added about a 1/2 c. at a time until I got it to the consistency I wanted. Very delish! Will make again.

It was a delicious recipe, however, it seemed over the top on spices.  We halved the amount of spices and also combined it with a white sauce so it would go farther.  With those changes, I would recommend it!

This was very easy and not bad tasting. I used dried herbs so that may have contributed to the lack in taste, however, with a little work, this recipe could be a keeper.

This recipe was just o.k.  I used low-fat cream cheese, maybe that was the culprit.  I bought all fresh herbs, but it hardly seemed worth it for this recipe.  May try again w/ regular cream cheese, but not for a while.

I made this for my housemate, and she loved it! If you make sure you have the fresh herbs, then it is extremely quick to make. I followed another reviewers example and added Italian stewed tomatoes, and used reduced fat cream cheese at  a little over half the quantity. The one thing I would suggest is to really season well with pepper and salt, otherwise it is a little on the sweet side. And, top with fresh Parmesan cheese!

This is one of my favorite recipes.  I share it with everyone because it's so easy and so good.  I use fat free cream cheese and leave out the oil and it tastes just as wonderful.  This recipe will be a mainstay for dinner!  THANK YOU! :)

This was sooo good.  I used 1/2 package of cream cheese and added a can of stewed italian style (w/ oregano and basil) tomatoes instead of fresh ones (including the liquid in the can), this resulted in a not too thick sauce.

Excellent recipe...it was a big hit.  The only thing I would change is that the sauce is really thick and pasty.  I think I'll try adding some milk to thin it out a bit next time.  Great flavour though!  Five stars.

I like the others used a can of italian tomatoes with the juice instead of a chopped tomatoe/basil/oregano. It really thinned it out because it was looking too thick. I also cubed some chicken breast and sauteed it in margerine and crushed garlic and added that in there. All in all it was fabulous and I will definatly make it again :)

I added in mushrooms while the pasta sauce was simmering. Then when it was ready I tossed the sauce and the pasta together. Then when it was done, I decided I needed some meat, so i sauteed some ham, onions and sweet peppers and mixed it in to the already finished pasta. It gave the bland pasta quite a bit of flavor! Everyone loved it.

DELICIOUS!  
I tweeked the recipe just a bit based on what other reviewers had written.  I used two HEAPING Tbsp. of garlic, dried herbs, and a pinch or two of red pepper flakes.  Instead of the fresh tomatoes, I used a can of diced with the juices, plus 1/4 cup of water and 1/4 cup of a dry red wine.  After that simmered for a bit, I added the cream cheese and voila!  Super easy.  Super good.

I really liked this recipe.  The overall taste was amazing...  I'd recommend adding milk to make the dish a little more creamy, onions, and more tomatoes.  And probably using a little less basil and oregano.  But this dish was easy and quick to make and tasted delicious.  You should definetly try it.

Excellent!  I had some leftover chicken that I shredded and added, as well as some shrimp.  Mixed it with the pasta in a casserole dish and sprinkled some shredded romano over the top and popped it in the over for about ten minutes.  Yummy!  Beware, though, if you don't care for basil, you may not like this recipe - had a very strong flavor, but was absolutely delicious!

This is good, simple, and quick to pull together. The reason for 4 stars is the fact that it is very rich because of the cream cheese. I used reduced fat cream cheese, but it was still very rich. Everyone loved it and ate it all. 
I used fresh herbs from my garden.

This was very good, but I had troubles getting the alfredo sauce to thinken and stick to the pasta. After stirring for a long time with heat, it finally worked, but unless you are very good with alfredo sauces, you may have troubles. Otherwise, my family and I really enjoyed this recipe!

This was just ok for me. I may fix it again but it's not one of my favorite pasta recipes. I also did as someone suggested and added milk to thin out the sauce a bit. That helped but it was still really thick. It needs a bit of salt because with the fresh tomato, it absorbs it. I added it while cooking and had to add more when it was finished. I think next time I'll either add a little more tomato or used canned tomatos that are already flavored.

Hmmmm....the dish was just okay.  Cream cheese with pasta didn't taste quite right to me but it was quite edible.  I added portabella mushrooms to the sauce and did vermallli pasta instead penna pasta because that's all I had.  I would not make this again unless I wanted to make something easy which doesn't require any time.  Overall, this recipe is average, nothing exciting about it.

Perhaps it was my fault for using fat-free cream cheese...but this recipe was horrible!  Although the ingrediants sounded like a winning combination all I ended up with was pink, creamy, goo.  (Not to mention the after taste that followed.)  I am thinking about possibly (probably not) trying the recipe again, with regular cream cheese--but why waste the ingrediants?!

My two-year-old nephew wasn't a fan of this one, but I loved it and so did my brother and his wife.  The only change I'd suggest is to add a little milk with the cream cheese; it was almost too thick to serve.

I have braces so I've been spending time looking for recipes that are easy to devour. This was so good I did tweak it a little bit because I love creamy pastas & spicy so I seasoned the crab, shrimp, diced tomato, onions & cream cheese with Cajun seasoning. I think next time I'll add chicken and bell peppers

Very simple to make.... however in my opinion that's where the good part ends. Way too much spice. Only my oldest daughter liked it and the jury is out as to what my wife thinks of it as she hasn't come home from work as of yet. This is NOT a taste issue but more of an texture issue. I prepared the recipe EXACTLY as presented.

If you like cream cheese, this recipe is for you.  I thought this would be a great way to use up some of my fresh herbs from the garden at the end of the season, but the cream cheese overwhelmed the herb flavors.  To thin out the sauce a bit, I added a can of diced tomatoes, undrained.  It was much better, but still not one of our favorites!

My family is more of a potato family although I have been trying to introduce more pastas and a few of the recipes I have tried have gone over well. This one did not.

When I added the cream cheese at the end it seemed overly dry. I added some heavy whipped cream and this helped ALOT. I also tried to leave out the tomatoes but after tasting it, decided to add them- it made a big difference but not a big enough difference so that people ate the salad. 

On a more postive note, one family member (who absolutely loves pasta) enjoyed this recipe. So for those of you who love pasta, this salad might just be for you. For those of you who are looking to expand your pasta horizons- look elsewhere.

i really enjoyed this dish!  I didn't have any tomatoes on hand, so I had to leave those out. (I really wish I had had some though!) and I added crab meat in.  Despites using dried spices, it was still delicious and so creamy! I also used rotini noodles because that's what i had on hand. ( I love cream cheese, which is probably why i enjoyed it so much

We added shrimp, as suggested, and it was really good.

I won't make this again.  I didn't have all the fresh herbs, but some of them.  It was dry and needed something else.

oh well.  worth the try - but won't use it again

This was alright,3.5 in my opinion my kids liked it and keep asking for this, I used garlic and herb cream cheese and added milk and butter to thin out wasnt enough sauce for 1lb pasta. I added red pepper flakes and cut way back on herbs which i added in the end because cooked herbs are not good to me anyways.

good flavor but cools really quickly, and i added a bit of milk to make it more creamy and not sticky
