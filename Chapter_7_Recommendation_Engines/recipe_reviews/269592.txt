I grew up on this casserole. I have made it dozens and dozens of time for my own family. Modifications .... for sure.....I added a thinly sliced onion when browning the mushrooms.  I make a roux with butter and flour (I like my flour to have that nice nutty flavour that it gets when you make a roux) that step really amps up the dish. Also deglaze your fry pan with 1/2 cup  of white wine and then pop the entire meal into the oven and cook on 325 for an hour. Fall off the bone tasty.

Delicious as written! My chops were thick so I did have to cook them longer but this is an excellent recipe. With the exception of bacon, pork is my least favorite meat so for me to give 5 stars for pork says a lot.

This recipe is very good. I added fresh Italian parsley for color and a bit of mild flavor. It is pretty easy and tasty. Just boil some potatoes and serve with the sauce. This is a truly delicious dinner. I think dried or fresh thyme could be used and will be just as awesome as it it. Will make it again. Have some crusty bread to eat the remnants of sauce. Update: If you want to add some richness and body to the sauce, before adding the garlic and mushrooms, try this:  add about 2tsps of white wine, deglaze the pan, and let the wine dissipate before adding the garlic and mushrooms. Yum!

Made it twice. First as directed above. The second time I used portobello mushrooms and added red onions and halved the broth amount and added white wine for the other half,  and it was amazing!!!!

KEEPER!  We can't wait to have this again!  Just follow the recipe and you'll be happy!  I did add about another 1 1/2 teaspoons of flour to the mix, but that's all I did.  This is really good!  Thanks, April!

This turned out very nicely. The only change I made was with the mustard. I didn't have dijon mustard, so I used spicy brown mustard. The pork chops were very tender, and the sauce/gravy was delicious. The only thing I might add is onions with the mushrooms and garlic.

Thank you for sharing this recipe! I am always on the lookout for quick and simple recipes and this one definitely fit the bill. I made mine with 4 thin, boneless pork chops and I only added 2 cloves of garlic. I also added a small chopped Vidalia onion and man was it delicious!! My husband spooned the extra gravy over 2 grands biscuits because he liked it so much. 
I will most definitely make this again and plan to share it with my daughter and daughter in law.

Holy Hannah this was awe-some!! I made the recipe mostly as-is, with the exception I didn't have beef broth so I used Campbell's beef consume, it was delish. I also used baby portabello mushrooms, talk about visually appealing! ?I would cook noodles or rice to serve this on.

Don't know, exactly, what I expected from this recipe, but I was a bit disappointed in it.

Tasted "ok", at best, with me adding salt, pepper, and garlic powder- repeatedly.

My husband liked it.......

Guess I was expecting more with the recipe note that it was close to one served to the author, at a restaurant. 

Probability of making it again, are slim.

I made this exactly as the recipe says to, except I used a little wine with the mushrooms. I also put the dish  ( covered in foil), in the oven @350 for 30 minutes. It was so tender & delicious! I will make this again & again!

This recipe was easier to make than I thought it would be, and tasted great. No leftovers. I’m not a fan of pork chops, but I get them when on sale. This is a keeper, thank you!

I had to use 2 pans bc my family is big. I used EVOO for one and butter for the other. Definitely will use butter as it made for a better crust with butter. So flavorful, and I used a lot more garlic as we love garlic! Will be making this again!!

Great recipe; it also works with chicken cutlets and chicken broth.  Serve with noodles, rice or mashed potatoes as the sauce is delicious.  Like others, I usually add some onion or shallot with the mushrooms, and sub  wine (up to 1/2 cup) for some of the broth.  Definitely a keeper!

This was very good. I made it exactly as the recipe stated. 
I am making another batch this weekend of just the cause. I have a bunch of chicken I need to use. 
This is so easy and inexpensive to make.

Fantastic.  Wouldn't change a thing.

Except, I used too much salt.  There's a story in my family that my mother once put potatoes on to boil - my father tasted the water and realized they weren't salted; my mother had asked my brother to salt the potatoes, and this he did; and my mother returned home, said my brother never salted the potatoes before, figured my dad wouldn't do it, and therefore more salt went into the pot.  Too young to recall, but I heard they were delightful.

Short story, it will be perfect when I control the sodium input next time.

This recipe is delicious!  An addition for me: Prior to cooking the mushrooms (Portabella) I deglazed with 1/3 cup burgundy wine.

I used chicken broth instead of beef broth. Otherwise, I stayed true to the recipe. Very tasty. My son swore that he didn’t like pork chops. He changed his mind. I will definitely make this again.

I loved this dish.  No exotic components.  I added onion with the mushrooms like another reader stated and it added so much flavor(I love onions though).  I have also found that the recipes take longer than stated as I am a novice cook, I double the prep time.

Delicious! Made using bone in pork chops and doubled the amount of mushrooms in the recipe. Will definitely be making it again. Cooked up some brown rice and sautéed veggies on the side.

I made this EXACTLY as documented.  I was disappointed in the lack of flavor, but I guess you can’t shortcut a depth of flavor in a 30 minute recipe.   For 30 minutes, it’s actually pretty good.  My sauce didn’t thicken., so I’ll probably try making it again to see if I can correct that.

I made the mushroom sauce alone since I had already fixed a "rack of pork" for Christmas dinner (and had NOT seen this recipe yet).   Not only was it DEEELISH, but it was gorgeous!!  I served this over the leftover meat and it will be used again and again!!  If I were to change it up at all?  I might add 1 t. of apple cider vinegar just to put a bit of POP into it.    It will go with anything!!  Yum!

I had made this near Christmas and decided I really had to make it again! I had it prepared in less than 20 minutes. The first time I made it with fresh mushrooms b it this time I only had canned. It didn't change my opinion of keeping it among my favorites. You need to definitely make this!

Really good! I would make the sauce thick enough so you can pour it on top of the chops and have stay on top.

Very good! I doubled the sauce for the portion of pork chops, added more than twice the mustard. Served with risotto - so good! It’s a repeater!

I mixed my mushroom gravy sauce with some cooked Reames frozen home style noodles. I placed the cooked boneless pork chop on top. It was very good and very filling. I'll make this again and put the mushroom gravy sauce on top of the pork chops and serve with a side of garlic mashed potatoes.

This is so delish! We ended up grilling the chops because we had a large party. I made the sauce on the stove and it was sooooo good! Served on top of smashed potatoes with peas on the side. The perfect meal!

I made this for my husband and he loved it. Was a little rich but flavor was great and I recommend mashed potatoes with it to take up some of the gravy.

I'm happy that I saved this recipe. 
I added more garlic to the recipe and added a half of an onion. 
Pork chops just found a new home.

Not sure how I feel about this. I thought the pork chops were too dry. Next time I will broil then before mixing with the gravy. The gravy was also extremely runny, after 3 tablespoons of flour. It was kinda bland. Not sure what it’s missing.

At first I thought it was bland, and was disappointed. I added a bunch of fresh tarragon, and some extra seasonings that I found in my pantry. Then it turned out more tasty. I’d also add less Dijon mustard, and more fresh garlic to taste and a hint of Maggi seasoning. I noticed some people used minced garlic found in a store bought jar in their pictures. I would use fresh garlic minced in a garlic press.

We loved this and plan on making it again. I did increase the amount of Dijon mustard to 2 T. (Yes, 2!) And as the gravy was a bit thin will add more flour next time. It was so good!

After reading a few reviews, I did the wine reduction and used 1T of what I had on hand (Beringer White Zin) and put it in a 350 degree oven for under 30 minutes and it’s definitely a keeper! I used thick boneless chops. Delicious!!

Easy to make and so delicious!  I read other reviews of this recipe and adjusted the recipe based on the reviews.   I seasoned (rubbed) the pork chops with salt, pepper, paprika and Emeril's Essence seasoning blend and let the seasoning's work in before searing the pork chops.  I love garlic, so I increased slightly the amount of fresh minced garlic.  I also increased the amount of mushrooms, from 8 oz to 12 oz.  I added sliced onions to the mushrooms as they were cooking.  And I substituted 1/2 cup of the beef broth with white wine.  I will definitely make this again!

This was super yummy- a great meal for mushroom lovers. I found I needed more paprika, salt, and pepper to cover both sides of the pork. My family really liked it! I'm be making it again.

Super easy recipe. Can be ready very quickly especially if the chops aren’t very thick.  I did not have Dijon so I used spicy brown mustard instead. This was quite good and I’d make it again in a heartbeat!

Superb. One of the best recipes I’ve made in a while. I looked at the measurements and adjusted to my liking on everything on it. Somehow I felt like the pork chops needed to be seasoned each side with extra salt, pepper and paprika. I added extra butter and onion and garlic salt to the recipe.  It came out delicious!

Great, easy recipe! I added 1/4 c of wine for flavor and to make up for the 1.5 oz that the can of beef broth shorted (white zin is what I had on hand, but I'm sure any kind of wine will do). The only other change I made was to add dry thyme because I love thyme. Fabulous dinner with sour cream mashed potatoes!

Turned out really well! The sauce is very flavorful - the garlic really shines. If I were to do anything differently, I would use bone-in instead of boneless chops, as they tend to be on the dry side. All in all, though, an excellent dish!

This dish is delicious. I halved the recipe as there are only two of us. Based a previous comment,  I used half beef bouillon and half red wine. Otherwise no changes.

Was looking for a recipe I’ve made in the past, Thur a out this wasn’t it. Wish the sauce was thicker, not as flavorful as I hoped, a little bland.

I followed the recipe to a T. It was very good , but I’ll have to add more garlic next time. I understand why they had a lot of garlic in it in the first place. The garlic will balance the mushroom flavor . I cooked for 15 years professionally and had my own restaurant . Balance is key.

I made this dish looking forward to sitting down and eating it.  Prep was easy and cooking it a breeze.  I do not ever make changes to the first time cooking a new recipe.  But, this just didn't quite do it for me.  It was certainly edible, just nothing special.  Looked great too but doubt I will make it again without trying to ramp it up somehow.

I opted to use chicken broth, outstanding.  The pork was very moist and the gravy was excellent over roasted Yukon gold potatoes.

I did not have any pork chops on hand but, I did have boneless chicken thighs and I used them instead. I also had my own chicken stock that I used in it! Everything else stayed the same. The meal turned out very good.  I really liked the idea of the added Dijon Mustard, it really added some nice flavor and texture to the sauce! I would definitely recommend this dish. Either with Pork or Chicken

I enjoyed the recipe and used boneless pork chops. I think because they were kind of thin, they got overcooked. I would make this recipe again, but would suggest bone-in pork chops.

REALLY good, but I definitely added more seasoning to the pork chops before cooking (extra paprika and I also added in Homestead and Mt. Elbert Seasoning from Savory Spice) and applied liberally. I also added a few dashes of Worcestershire while the mushrooms were cooking.

Very good! Next time, I'll add some onions to the mushroom sauce. I cut back on the salt since beef stock in my corner of the world has 24% sodium. This recipes makes delicious leftovers for lunch the next day.

This was very good. I used thick bone in chops which required cooking a bit longer. Meat very moist. Plenty of gravy. Served with mashed potatoes. As far as mushrooms and garlic go, what’s not to love? Will definitely make it again.

I used canned mushrooms and minced garlic from the jar .  I sprayed the pan with canola oil when I cooked the pork chops but used the 1/8 of a cup of butter to make the gravy. It was good.  I served mine with rice.  I will definitely make this again.

After following this recipe precisely, the pork was very tough and cork-like and didn’t have much of a taste, I’m disappointed and I won’t be making it again.

I halved the recipe for two of us. I seasoned with Penzey's BBQ 3000 rather than paprika, salt and pepper. I also added sherry when cooking the mushrooms. The pork was tender and the sauce was flavorful. It was a bit salty for us - I would use low sodium broth next time. Overall an easy recipe to make and very good.

I always have to change something. I used a blacken seasoning rather than the paprika and salt and pepper. Added a little corn starch to the gravy to thicken it. Plated with garlic mashed potatoes and sauted green beans.

yes, tonight. Adjusted recipe  for prep in instant pot. Delicious  and tender. Sauteed onion garlic, and mushrooms in the pot and also browned the chops. Added beef broth then pressure cooked for 9 minutes. switched back to saute and added a slurry of flour and water to thicken.Served with buttered noodles and mixed vegies. Yum!

I made exactly as written and just didn't like it that much. It was too much work for too little flavor.  My husband however really liked it, so maybe should have given it a 4, but I'm the cook, so my vote counts.

This Recipe is great.  But I want to say I grew up when you had to cook pork longer and we did sear and then cover the pan which had a Seasoned liquid or gravy.  Let the meat break down as it does in a slow cooker. Then the meat is so tender.   Bone in is helpful as well.

I used it with a pork roll. Great taste and very easy to make. I wonder if I can do the same thing for chicken using chicken stock instead. May try that!

I used a small, boneless pork roast. Sauted in butter, used exact  ingredients, simmered in crock pot.  It was divine-tender, moist and flavorful.  I plan to use the leftovers to make pulled pork BBQ sandwiches.  We will definitely make this again. Thanks for the rcipe.

This was very good and very easy.  I bumped up the garlic to the original amount and realized the reduced amount in the recipe was better.  Take the chops out of the sauce as soon as they are re-warmed or they will over cook.  The mustard smell was overpowering when added but it didn't overpower in taste. This is a keeper.

I made the recipe as posted, and served it with Brussels sprouts and baked potatoes. My husband and I both enjoyed it and the mushroom gravy was substantial enough to serve on both the meat and the bakers. We are looking forward to enjoying it again, maybe when we have dinner guests.

Expected a lot more flavor.  I would change it to breaded chops, probably in the air fryer, to get a more tender chop.  Also need to rev up the gravy a bit.  Perhaps with fresh lemon juice.

My wife & I liked this dish  a lot.  I used a pork tenderloin cut into medallions, & followed the recipe pretty closely.   This recipe should hold up well to some experimentation.  I will try with chicken thighs (boneless/skinless), or add a bit of rosemary.   Will certainly make this again!

not only did i make it once but made it a second time in less than a week.   telling everyone i know what a delicious  fancy dish it is with little work.  the most time consuming part is peeling and slicing the mushrooms(which i prefer to do myself).

Great, easy & delicious. Being GF & DF, I used earth balance in place of butter & corn starch slurry for flour. Only had 4 chops & would double the rest, especially mushrooms if I made 8. Super easy, basically one skillet delicious meal.

Excellent if you follow the recipe. Season chops but do not add salt to the gravy as the beef broth is salty enough. I will definitely make at least once a month.

Absolutely delicious!! The chops I used were really think so I kept them in the oven much longer than specified in the recipe. They came out so tender and restaurant quality! Didn't think to take a picture, they were wolfed down too fast. LOL.

We loved this recipe!  Very easy to make.  Served mashed potatoes with the mushroom gravy. 
The only addition I made was to add a little white wine to the gravy.

This a really easy recipe that I halved for 2 thick bone-in chops. The final, very addictive, sauce was very well suited to using wild mushrooms instead. You will definitely need a good baguette or any crusty bread to soak up all that delicious flavor. Simple, delicious!

It  came out good, I used thin pork chops, so they were a bit over cooked. Next time I will use thicker, But otherwise very yummy!

Great way to cook pork chops - tender, and gravy  great - might cut back on the garlic next  time , but other than that don’t change a thing!

Made accordingly to the recipe, only change I am going to make is to double the ingredients for the gravy. Exceptionally good. Definitely going into the recipe book.

Good but not great.  This is a good basic recipe that with a few tweaks will be excellent. Next time I make it I will add onions and saute them before adding the mushrooms, and will also add white wine, both of which many other reviews suggested.  I will also double the mushrooms as we like to have more than this called for.

I bbq the chops rather than pan fry.  Seemed to crisp up the fat in the chops. Other than that, as per recipe.  Served with red skinned rosemary smashed potatoes  and a full garden salad.  This was our Xmas dinner with some friends over and everyone was raving !!

I was a little disappointed with the taste. Meat was surprisingly tender considering time of cooking. It needed a little more spice or herb flavoring.

Followed the instructions. I should have added more garlic. Besides the lack of garlic taste it was great.

this was absolutely delicious.that little teaspoon of dijon gave it a little something without having a mustard flavor.i made one pan with mushrooms and one without.you definitely need the mushrooms for the flavor otherwise would be nothing special.cant wait to have again.will double thw sauce and mushrooms next time.i enjoy them more than the meat.

Nice change of pace from my usual pork chops. The only thing I did different was deglaze the pan with Sherry and increased the sauce by 50%.

I didn't have mushrooms, so used sliced onions and also added a few tablespoon of wine and cut back on the beef broth.  My husband and I both liked it and the fact that the cooking time for the pork chops was short, they did not dry out and get hard as boneless chops can do.  Would rate very good and great with mashed potatoes.

Nothing you can do to fix this dish...I’m a “seasoned” cook and I did add some extra seasoning but this adish that will never be made again.

I made it exactly as written, and it was delicious.  My husband helped by cooking the pork chops until brown and no longer pink, but he thought they weren't soft enough.  I explained that as they simmer in the sauce, they will become very tender, and they did.  I served them over buttered noodles, and he couldn't stop eating them.  I will definitely make them again.

This was so good, cheap, and easy to make!! A new favorite! I suggest seasoning the chops liberally, I did so and it made the gravy that much more flavorful.

This recipe was super simple and absolutely delish. I followed it exactly. I served over mashed cauliflower and paired with a nice bottle of bourbon barrel aged cabernet. Again, the whole thing was fabulous.

Made this for my wife and used onions and ginger and fried them with the garlic first. Made my own broth with the flour, curry, black pepper kernels and water. I did not use extra flour. Served with avocado and Irio, which is potatoes, green peas, pumpkin leaves  and green peppers steamed together, then fried in onions, ginger and garlic. Too die for

I am going to give the overall recipe a five... with that said I was chasing flavor when I was making the mushroom sauce... when I returned the pork to the skillet I add a 1/2 bottle of roasted garlic marinade to the mix covered and let thicken and it turned out perfect ... side dish was seasoned roasted red potatoes......(on a side note Wifey loved it)... Enjoy...

Sorry don’t know why but we really disliked this. Followed exactly. Sauce lacked flavor despite garlic and Dijon. Even upped mustard after tasting and it still didn’t work for us.  Maybe some wine would have helped.  Hate to leave bad review but it just didn’t work for us.

I've made this twice now and it's so yummy!  I used boneless pork chops, American cut, which is a thicker cut.  The chops  were tender and juicy and the gravy was so good with the garlic in it.  I served with the mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables.  This recipe is a keeper.

Made this with bone-in chops for more flavor. Only thing I added was a cap full of Gravy Master to give a richer dark color.
