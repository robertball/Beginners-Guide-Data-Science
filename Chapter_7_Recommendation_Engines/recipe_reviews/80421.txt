The previous recipe by "themeese" clearly states that she believes that "it was not the recipes fault" and that it was in fact a bad crop.  Leaving 1 star reflected a very bad recipe on the publishers part and was unfair.  Please try for yourself, enjoy!

I used half the sugar and butter, and milk instead of cream, and it still came out plenty sweet-n-buttery.  I really like the unusual flavor combo, but will do it with still less sugar next time.

So I In the spirit of adventure and because they were dirt cheap, I bought some turnips and now I know why there's, like, 5 recipes for turnips.  Half the receipes on this site call for a half pound of bacon and copious amounts of butter. No kidding. Even with the added spices and mashing -- no matter how I wished them to be like mashed potatoes these suckers had a life of their own. They retained their diced shape -- no matter how much mashing I subjected them to. The hubster, a man who claims to love vegetables and would like to go vegetarian but in reality will only eat maybe 3 vegetables (green beans, cauliflower (raw only) and I'm hard pressed for third vegetable), was very adventurous in his forkfuls...and I had to call it early -- Dear God Man! Back away from the turnips! I still gave the receipe 4 stars as it's not the recipe, we just don't dig turnips.

Well, I learned a lesson today.  If the turnips you grew in your garden came out kinda small, tough, and strong, not even a generous dose of fat and sugar will magically make them edible!  I will have to revist this idea with store-bought turnips and see if I can give it more stars.  The concoction I wound up with hit the trash can PDQ. I don't think it is the recipe's fault. You shouldn't go wrong with sour cream and brown sugar!

Didn't really care for the combination of flavors in this dish. I would leave out the brown sugar and nutmeg next time. Not sure about the sour cream, but might try adding a little to my usual way of coursely mashing turnips and carrots, with butter and seasonings.  The carrots add a sweeter flavor and no need for sugar.

I liked it, however, following the recipe to the letter was too much liquid in the bowl.  I will definately make this again and cut back the liquid a bit.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was a hit at all 3 Christmas dinners that I had to prepare! I did cut back on the liquid, adding the cream slowly until I achieved the desired consistency. I even had Turnip haters asking for more.

Pretty good. My husband who is not a fan of turnips actually liked this one.
Thank you for sharing.

This was very good prior to adding the brown sugar.  I went with only a couple tablespoons of brown sugar to start and wish I had just left it out.  I didn't even add as much butter, sour cream or half & half, but it was still excellent.  Just didn't like it sweetened.

Yummy! I didn't know what to do with all those turnips from my CSA, but now I know. I halved all the ingredients except for Turnips (stuck with 2 lbs on that) after reading reviews re: too watery. It was perfect.  Thanks BUNKYDARL

This is really good!  I also added a carrot (boiled with brown sugar) to give it some more flavour and colour.  I also added a pinch of ginger along with the nutmeg.  Five stars!  Thanks a mil :)

I thought this was way too watery. We ended up mashing it up because of that, and it was still a bit watery.  That, and there was just a hint of a "radish" aftertaste that did not go over well in my book.

I'm glad that the family of the creator of the recipe is so thrilled with it, but I found it to be so sweet as to be pretty much inedible.
