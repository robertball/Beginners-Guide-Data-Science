This was excellent! I used whole wheat PASTRY flour instead of regular whole wheat which gives these cookies an excellent texture (very similar to regular snickerdoodles). I used 1/2 teaspoon more cinnamon, the same sugar/cinnamon ratio I usually use (2T/1t). They seem a bit sticky when you are rolling them into balls, this is OK, they will turn out fine :) I did NOT press them down with a glass and they spread out just right. Like all snickerdoodle cookies you have to take them out before they look set, which was after about ten minutes for this recipe. I would highly recomend these cookies to anyone! They do NOT taste like molasses/gingersnap type cookies like some have suggested. They do NOT have a strong whole wheat flavor. They DO taste like snickerdoodles. Very good snickerdoodles :)

I've used this recipe with some minor tweaks: Instead of butter, I used 1/4 c applesauce, and 2 tablespoons of butter. I also used 1/2 c all purpose flour and 1 c whole wheat flour. The applesauce can make the batter a little too "wet" so I used a little all purpose flour when rolling the cookie dough into a ball. Baked them for 10 minutes, came out perfect!

I used the Whole WHeat Snickerdoodle Recipe as the crust for the Fruit Pizza Recipe and it was delicious and much healthier since it was made from whole wheat.

Wow!  I was pleasantly surprised with this recipe's outcome!  To make it even healthier, I used about 3/4 cup unsweetened applesauce and 2T butter (instead of 1/2 cup butter).  The batter was very sticky so I added about one tablespoon of all purpose flour.  I forgot to flatten them but am glad I forgot.  After just 10 minutes these cookies came out of the oven like little fluffy pillows of yumminess!!!!  Wow.

I love cookies but am also a nutritional freak, so when I found this recipe for whole wheat cookies, I had to try them.  This was my first time making Snickerdoodles, so I had nothing to compare them to.  Out of the oven, these cookies are nice and soft.  I tried them again the day after and they are crisp around the edge and still nice and soft in the centre!

As for the whole wheat part, I definitely could taste that they were whole wheat but I enjoyed that aspect.  As one other reviewer mentioned, it gives it a bit more of an "adult" appeal but my cousin still loved these.

My aunt says these are similar to her Ginger Snap cookies, so I may try adding a bit of ginger powder next time to see how they turn out.

Great cookie!  Highly recommended.

I LOVED THESE! And i'm not a snickerdoodle lover! i used splenda for baking in place of white sugar and splenda brown sugar (YUM) for the brown sugar. i used 1/3 c. wonderslim in place of the egg (you can get this at wild oats health food store-it is basically prunes/dates cooked down and put through a seive and it replaces eggs as well as fats in recipes.  it is great stuff and no artificial junk or hydrogenated oils or cholesterol-and it doesn't alter the taste). i accidentally put the topping mix ingredients in the dough because it doesn't separate them on the ingred. list but i think that made it better. of course i had to make topping to go on the outside too. ***it is important to take these out when they are crackly on the outside and look wet on the inside. they finish outside the oven.  my first batch was crunchy but still the best snickerdoodle ever-couldn't keep hubby and kids out of them!

These were pretty good considering they were made with whole wheat. I made with 1:1 Whole Wheat:All Purpose because I was afraid of the overbearing taste of the wheat. I'm glad I only did half, as I believe it would have been too strong. Cookies were pretty moist & chewy, although I have definitely tasted more moist and chewier snikerdoodles before.

I was craving a good snickerdoodle and these hit the spot - bonus points for being whole wheat!  I used whole wheat pastry flour and got a nice, smooth texture.  I did not have cream of tartar so I substituted the cream of tartar/baking soda combo with 1 tsp. baking powder - did an excellent job!  I also recommend chilling the dough for a few hours - it will be much easier to roll.  And definitely flatten the cookies.  I flattened most of mine and got cute, perfect rounds.  The last pan in the oven, I forgot to flatten.  The result was not-so-cute dome shaped cookies.  :\ Hubby loved them, I loved them.  A KEEPER!

WOW! i'm really impressed by this recipe! my whole family loved it, said it had a very nice flavour and didn't even notice that it was made with whole wheat flour! however i never had an original snickerdoodle before, so i don't know if it was supposed to be puffy and soft ( i thought they were supposed to be flat and crispy). either way this was a very good cookie.

CAUTION DANGEROUS! I can't stop eating them. I used 1 cup whole wheat pastry flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, 1 1/2 tsps. cinnamon. Used my small Pampered Chef cookie scoop which made 35 cookies. Baked for just 8 mins. Let cool for 3 mins. and transferred to a cooling rack. They are only 1 point for Weight Watchers even using butter. I am in big big trouble, I love them! UPDATE, made them today trying to make them healthier, big flop! I used white whole wheat flour and applesauce in place of the butter, to me it was not worth the difference in fat and calories, will use butter next time. My grandson did say they were good and I should share my recipe with every one in my town and his.(he is 4 years old) UPDATE 1/30/2011 Made them again today and put the cinn/sugar into the dough by mistake. Made more cinn/sugar to roll them in. They tasted great and will probably do that from now on.

These kinda turned out to be 'fiber cookies'. Maybe my cream of tartar was too old or something?? I might try them again with half WW, half AP.

This recipe is great.  I love the idea of actually getting some fiber in my diet from a cookie.  My only complaint is that I could'nt stop eating them, and now I have a stomach ache!  Great recipe- saved to my recipe box!  Thanks!

excellent recipe - I actually was looking for a recipe to use up my huge bag of WW flour - and stumbled upon this one. Not only did they turn out beautifully, now I have a recipe that gets some whole grains into my little ones. Thank you!

A really good "healthy" snack option.  I did alter; I used 2 Tbls butter and 1/2 cup applesauce, similar to another reviewer and had my doubts b/c the dough was very sticky even after I added extra flour, but these cookies turned out very tasty!  My daughter liked them better than our usual healthy cookie option and that one has chocolate chips!  I will still play with the ratio of butter/applesauce because I like a criper cookie - these are very cake-like in texture, but really very good even with the lower fat alteration!

I am rating these 4.5 stars.  They have a great flavor!  Not dry and crumbly at all.  My 3 year old daughter helped me make these, she rolled and dipped them in the sugar.  She loved it!  She ate a lot after they were baked too!  Make sure not to overbake these.  It was hard for me to tell when they were done, because they didn't spread at all.  Just stayed in a round ball shape.  The first batch was overbaked, but after that one, I learned and they are very good!  I got about 2.5 dozen.  I will make these again, and will also try the other whole-wheat snickerdoodle recipe on this site to see which one I prefer.

These are delicious and healthy!  I used Whole Wheat Pastry Flour instead and they were perfect.  I usually make Mrs. Sigg's Snickerdoodles, which are the best, but not as healthy.

These were pretty good. The only things I changed were the cooking temp to 350 degrees and cooked them for 6 minutes because I like very soft cookies with little crunch and they came out perfect.  I also changed the cinnamon to 1 teaspoon.

As suggested, I replaced half the wheat flour with unbleached AP flour. Yum!!! I'm a cookie lover, so this definitely helps in the nutrition area. Also, my 13 year old even gave them a big "YUM!"!

These were a disappointment.  I followed the recipe exactly, but the results are poor.  The cookies spread a lot despite chilling the dough, I did add a bit of salt but still feel something is missing and I also thought they seemed a bit greasy.  I did use WW Pastry flour, could that be the problem?

Made these healthier by using egg substitute and light margarine.  I baked them for 9 minutes on parchment paper- perfect!  As a side note, if you do not like whole wheat, these cookies will not be your cup of tea.  Most of the grains that our family eats are whole grains, so these cookies are right up our alley!

These are great!  I followed the recipe exactly and the flavor is great, the dough is easy to work with - I really love these! We all did. I brought some to a cookout and everyone there really liked them too, they were surprised to learn that they were made with whole wheat flour. I will definitely make these again - yum!

These are great.  I substituted the brown sugar and white sugar with Splenda brown sugar/Splenda mixture and a teaspoon of baking powder for the baking soda and cream of tartar (because I didn't have any cream of tartar).  These turned out delish and felt a little bit healthier!

Delicious! I love that these cookies are so flavorful and yet they're so low in sugar and high in fiber. Wonderful! The only thing it that I think in my oven they cooked really well at just 7 or 8 minutes. Other than that, these cookies are wonderful!

Yum! The whole wheat gives it an interesting texture, yet doesn't dominate the flavor. This one's a keeper!

Pretty straightforward. You really can't mess up a snickerdoodle. I followed the recipe exact, only I added about a pinch of salt. I didn't make these for me, I made them for the boys so when they've gotten to try them, I'll update my review.

Wow!  What a great cookie!  I also had no cream of tartar in the house, but thank goodness for the internet, as I learned I could substitute baking powder for the soda/tartar combo.  I also mistakenly added in the cinnamon and sugar to the batter, then made more to roll cookies in.  They came out so good, I wouldn't change this goof.  This recipe is definitely going into the Christmas cookie rotation at my house!  And, I am so glad to have found a really delicious use for my WW flour!  Thanks!!!!

Whole what??? I can't tell they're whole wheat. Only edits: used Earth Balance instead of butter and used 1 tsp cinnamon. I baked mine for seven minutes - just as they started to crack - and think another minute would have done them well. They're soft and light and sweetly perfect.

Fantastic! I just took my first bite and man I am stoked about these!!!! They are nutty from the whole wheat and just the right amount of sweetness from the brown sugar. I am a huge fan of snickerdoodles and this is a wonderful healthier version of them. Thanks for the recipe it has a permanent spot in my box :)

Good for a whole wheat cookie.  If you are expecting something identical to a traditional snickerdoodle recipe you may be disappointed.  These were softer and more cake like but with comparable flavor. Most important to flatten with a glass because these cookies do not spread out much and retain their shape well.

A Very Good Cookie! I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of using whole wheat pastry flour, which I highly recommend!I will add this recipe to may collection.

Yummy!  I used stone ground whole wheat flour and thought it looked a little course so I replaced a 1/2 cup of the wheat flour with just regular all purpose flour.  I might try it with whole wheat pastry flour the next time.  The hubby and 5 year old loved them!

These were awful!!!! I halved the batch and after forcing my little brother to try one ate the entire batch!!!! IT WAS AWFUL! but in a good way of course. I used splenda brown sugar, and normal sugar as a replacement, and used my smart balance light butter spread instead of the butter to decalorize it even more and it was sooooo good. Mine turned out really puffy, which i hate, but after doing some research :P, i think this was due to me halving the recipe but using a whole egg, using cold butter and eggs, chilling the dough before baking (which made it more rollable) and maybe using too much baking soda. I also didn't find it to be very sweet, which I kind of liked, but I think next time I will had a tablespoon or two of honey, or some liquid sweetener like that. Also, I think I overbaked mine with 8 minutes. Next time I'm going to try 6 and see how it goes. I didn't feel like getting out my mixer so I softened the butter and just kind of whisked it by hand. I also just kind of stuck the dough in the freezer for a couple minutes to chill it thinking it would be easier to make round and roll in sugar and stuff, but next time after I put the dough on the cookie sheets I'm going to let it warm to room temp. to see if they turn out flatter and chewier. These are officially my new favorite healthy cookie!!!! Thank you so much!!!

My teenager made these while I was shopping today...she couldn't find cinnamon so used some apple pie spice instead, as well as Splenda brown sugar.  They came out very tasty!  She didn't flatten them after rolling in the cinnamon/sugar so they were very thick in the middle, but that didn't effect the flavor.  They are very good, with a nice sweet "wheaty" flavor that is complimented nicely by the spices.

I followed the directions except I used Smart Balance instead of butter (I was out of butter).  Half of the cookies were baked on a cookie sheet and the other half were baked on a stone.  Those on a cookie sheet had a burnt bottom; not sure if this was due to the Smart Balance.  I let the ones on the stone sit a few extra minutes and they came out perfectly!  I used Sigaon cinnamon and doubled that amount (we really like the flavor) to the sugar mixture.  They came out tasty.  Next time I may add a little cinnamon to the cookie mixture for a little more flavor.  Otherwise, I'll make this again.

These were yummy little cookies.  I made the following substitutions:  used light butter, Splenda's brown sugar blend, egg beaters, 2 parts whole wheat flour to 1 part soy flour (my husband is diabetic so I was trying to reduce the carbs), and granular Splenda.  They were delicious and the perfect texture!

These are a nice variation on the standard snickerdoodle cookie.

They do have more fiber than snickerdoodles made with white flour, but they do still pack a carbohydrate punch.

They go nicely with a cup of coffee.

The recipe was well written, and the cookies were easy to make.

I used a small scoop, #70, to portion the dough.

Unless a child is familiar with whole wheat baked goods, he or she might not care for them.

I used the King Arthur

Awesome!  Crispy, crunchy.  These cookies have a wheaty and airy texture to them that gives them a sense of being lighter in calories even though are a cookie.  My family loves them.  They have become a favorite.

I've been looking for a wheat cookie with flavor & this is it. I made changes after reading reviews to better suit my personal preferences. I used 1/4 c butter & 1/4 c I Can't Believe It's not butter STICK to cut back on fat. Used 1 c whole wheat flour and 1/2 c all purpose white. Also accidentally put the toppings in the cookie since they weren't separated in the recipe, but it gave them lots of flavor.  Rolled them in the cinnamon & sugar topping which I doubled.  Really good, going to try to use the Splenda sugars next time & will update this!

Very good!  You can taste the ww a bit, but it definitely doesn't bother me.  I like ww breads, etc, so it's all good.  This doesn't make a lot of cookies, and I made small cookies, but they are cute and good.  They are kind of crispy on the outside but soft on the inside.  I did end up baking these for 8 min, which worked perfectly. Also, I had very little cinnamon sugar mix leftover, which is good--the recipe is almost spot on.   Thanks for the recipe!

I've never had a Snickerdoodle so I wouldn't know how these compare, but they are pretty good cookie! Especially for something with all whole wheat.  I used "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter" (stick form, of course) and was very pleased with the cookie - except I think the baking temp and time are a bit much.  I'd bake at 350 for 6 to 8 minutes to avoid overly dry cookies.  Pretty tasty! Thanks, Marguerite!

Made these exactly like the recipe and they tasted nothing like snickerdoodles in my opinion. They tasted like sugar cookies. I even put more cinnamon than the recipe called for.

The cookies tasted a little too "wheaty" to me.  They also can out a little hard to manuver when it came to rolling but that may have just been with me.  Overall its a good recipe for a healthier choice!

Yum!  Delicious snickerdoodles!  It's such a delight to be able to use whole wheat flour & get a wonderful cookie treat!  We love these snickerdoodles.  I doubled the cinnamon for us cinnamon lovers but kept everything else the same.  Just the right flavor & not too sweet.  They bake up crispy on the outside & perfectly soft on the inside.  Great with a glass of milk!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!  :)

Okay, a few things:
The cookies are great,but there are some things you shouldn't do. First,make sure you mix the sugar and butter JUST until they're blended;don't over mix it.Adding some cinnamon won't hurt at all,just make sure you don't add too much.Also,i tried to change up the recipe a few times:did half butter/applesauce.Came out kinda dry and had an apple-y taste to them.Added some molasses.Came out hard and crunchy,and tasted like a ginger snap.Added honey,and got the same result as molasses,except they didn't taste like a gingersnap;just gross.They're usually done after about 7 minutes,not 10.If the first tray comes out kinda dry,adding a tablespoon or so of milk helps.This recipe is great,as long as you do it right.

Holy smokes this is delicious! Yes, I have done a bit of tweaking, but still the heart of the recipe. I am so greatful to be able to make Snickerdoodles that have slight redeeming nutrtional value to them. Nice and fluffy and tasty! I've made it twice in the past month, now. I definitly recommend this.

I discovered the snickerdoodle cookies just last year, and I loved it. Now that I am more conscious about what I put in my mouth, I find this great recipe for WW Snickerdoodles. Let me tell you, they are amazing!! I made them a bit bigger and got 30, baked for 9 mins at 350 and they were perfect! My son (he is 2) can't stop eating them. They have the right amount of flavor. I will definitely be making these very often! (also this recipe has a lot less calories than the other one on here, I'm sticking to this one!)

Wow! I'm impressed with how well these turned out, considering they don't have any white flour in them.  They are delicious! I added almost a teaspoon of cinnamon to the batter - definitely essential if you want a flavorful cookie. They are pretty sweet so the sugar could be reduced.

These are very good whole wheat cookies, but in my opinion, they are not very reminiscent of the true Snickerdoodle.  I will probably make again just because they were so yummy!  Thanks for the recipe :)

I took the advice of several other people who have rated and reviewed this recipe and decreased the sugar.  Big mistake if one is looking for the true snickerdoodle flavor.  I had made some regular snickerdoodles with my own recipe and they were much sweeter and tastier.  Next time I make these I will use all the sugar in the recipe.  Other than the sweetness, the recipe turned out really well.  I will be making these again.  Thanks for the recipe!
Hugs, Anj

I was excited about this recipe's use of wheat flour. I'm not sure what I did wrong, my cookies were kinda dry and cakey. I cooked them for 8-10 mins, perhaps I should've pulled them out at 6 mins. I may try them again and up the butter and lower the cooking time.

These are excellent - my favorite cookies!  I tweaked the recipe a little to my liking, though, adding 1 TBSP of vanilla and 1 TBSP of cinnamon, and they turned out fantastic!  I've even mixed the cinnamon right in, and they work just fine.

Yumalicious cookies! This was my first time using whole wheat flour and I can't believe how good these are. The texture is different than a regular snickerdoodle, lighter, airy even, but still very good. I will make these more often and not feel bad for eating one too many. One tip I read I'll repeat is to NOT overbake, these don't look quite done but they are. Thanks for the recipe.

OK the skeleton of this recipe is EXCELLENT. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because I thought they lacked something- so I added about a teaspoon each of cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves. They are moist and delicious. I might try to turn this recipe into a REALLY healthy cookie recipe and do half butter and half applesauce, and probably cut out at least 1/4 of the sugar- these are very sweet. Enjoy!

I wanted to use up my whole wheat flour.  I think I just don't love snickerdoodles.  I thought the cookies were very bland with a strong wheat flavor.  Next time I would add some chocolate.

Oh..My...God! These are amazing! Extremely simple to make, yet they taste and look like a pro did. I'm 15 and made these in a snap. They taste more like a molasses or gingerbread cookie, but hey, that's fine by me =D

WOW!  These are fantastic!  They are a dream come true - not only are they healthier than most cookies but they taste very good as well!  The texture is excellent & the sweetness was perfect.  I would not say that they taste like a snickerdoodle though, there is a similarity but they are good in their own right.  I love the texture & they are visually pleasing (they look like a molassas cookie).  Even my husband likes them & he is a one cookie man (chocolate chip).  Great recipe!

These are very good for a cookie that uses all whole wheat flour.  I added cinnamon to the batter and sprinkled a tiny bit of extra sugar on top after pressing them down.  They spread out more than I thought they would after reading other reviews.  A bit crumbly but very good.

This recipie really hit the spot! I rolled the top of each cookie in brown sugar and cinnamon, instead of refined sugar. This made the cookies sweeter and crispy on top - these are heavenly cookies.

This is a very good recipe. It's a little less sweet than the traditional Snickerdoodle and in my opinion has more of an "adult" flavor. I'll make these again, but not for a while since we ate the entire batch in 2 days!

I really liked this cookie!!  I was looking for a recipe that I can made Grahm Cracker crust.  I thought this could be the closest recipe I could get for that.  I baked them and couldn't stop eating before making a crust with them.

I never write reviews, but these actually turned out incredible, so I had to. I make cookies quite often, and most of my family say these are the best I've ever made! They taste sweet, but not overly so. They get crispy on the outside, but soft on the inside. "The perfect cookie", as my mom said. Will definitely make them again!

If you scoop 2 teaspoons of batter roll it and don't  press down the cookies come out really fluffy.  Overall they were good although I did add 1 tablespoon more of the flower which helped with it sticking and added a little bit more ground cinnamon.

I always make changes so the recipe is healthier but this one was rather pitiful. I won't make again but it was a good try.

I made these with homemade oat flour so they'd be gluten-free, and I added several additional spices that I had out for gingerbread cookies. They were amazing but very crumbly, so the second time a made them, when I made them for guests, I added an egg to hold everything together better.

This is an amazing recipe and everyone at my work will agree. If you don't have whole wheat flour on hand, you can blend some oatmeal and cut it about half and half with regular flour. You might need to add a little more of the mixture until it's the right consistency but it tastes great. I've never liked snickerdoodles as much as when I found this recipe and I'll never use another one.

absolutely melt-in-your-mouth cookie.  Only I gave it a 4-star because of the servings that states makes 36 cookies.  It only made 15, 2" cookies using a medium scoop by Pampered Chef which is the average cookie making scoop. So be sure and double this recipe to make your time worthwhile. I'm going back to recipe by Nan....makes more and tastes better!

Love these cookies.  Fresh ground whole wheat flour works fine in this recipe.  I used white sugar, instead of the brown.  That is more like the version I loved growing up.  My favorite part?  Not having to refrigerate the dough.

This is the snickerdoodle recipe that I keep coming back to! I love that the whole wheat flour makes a slightly firmer, chewier cookie - and my family loves them, too :).

Just made these and they are delicious! Used light butter instead of regular.  I used a brown sugar blend and sugar/stevia blend instead of the regular sugars and used 1tsp of baking powder in place of cream of tarter and baking soda.  Will definitely be making again.

I used whole wheat pastry flour, and these turned out fantastic. I don't think anyone would have guessed that these were 100% whole wheat cookies.

I love these. Had to dbl the 2nd batch because the first batch disappeared way too quickly.  I used Wheat Montana White Whole Wheat flour.  I froze the dough for 5-15min before rolling it in the cinnamon/sugar.  I used more cinnamon than sugar and got a nice dark crackled finish. These cookies are heavenly straight out of the oven but I think they get even better after cooling and stored in an airtight container.  So soft and chewy and they kept well for 4 whole days (I'm sure they'd go longer just haven't had them around long enough).

I've read that some people tend to think the texture is on the grittier side. You can combat that by using whole wheat 'bread' flour. It's ground down more then The regular whole wheat flour so the consistency is more fine.

These were disappointing to me.  I did not have Cream of Tarter.  So, I also eliminated the baking soda and substituted 1 tsp of baking powder. Per a site: "When baking and cream of tartar is used in tandem with baking soda, the obvious substitute is baking powder. Baking powder is made up primarily of baking soda and cream of tartar. Every 1 tsp of baking powder is the equivalent of 1/4 tsp of baking soda and a tsp of cream of tartar." http://www.fitday.com/fitness-articles/nutrition/healthy-eating/substitutes-for-cream-of-tartar.html#b So - maybe my review isn't fair.  However, they were nice and fluffy and a little chewy on the inside, so that seemed right.  Just the taste....I don't think I like the whole wheat.

I felt the taste of these cookies was pretty good, but the texture was gritty because of the whole wheat flour.  If I were to make these again, I would use half white flour, or see if I could find some whole wheat pastry flour.

The first time I made these they burned.  The second time I made them I baked them at 300 for 7 minutes and they turned out perfect.  The whole wheat is no overbearing.  My family ate them all in 24 hours.

Only change I made was Smart Balance in place of butter.  Yes, they are sticky.  But, they turn out pefectly.  I will chill the dough the next time.  They do not taste like Ginger Snaps. Just of a browned, brown sugar tste. YUMMY!

These are excellent cookies!  The only change I made was to use half butter (1/4 c.) and half margarine (1/4 c.) instead of all butter.  I've found using all butter usually makes cookies and cakes too dry.  As I made it, the recipe turned out chewy and delicious.  The whole wheat works really well with the brown sugar and cinnamon.  My boyfriend, who generally eschews anything claiming to be healthier, actually liked them!

I made these yesterday and they are gone. I used the smart balance butter blend and splenda baking and splenda brown. The recipe does not make many so if you have kids I would double it. My kids, 10 and 1, loved them. These cookies turned out like a bakery cookie. Chewy, soft, a little crispy on the edges. I think these are the best cookies I have ever baked.

Whole wheat snickerdoodles are definitely not the same as regular, all-purpose flour snickerdoodles.  They're not bad, but also not a replacement for a regular snickerdoodle.

Great recipe!  I really enjoyed the cookies.  I love using Whole Wheat and really enjoy cookies.  They were easy to make and took no time at all.  I used the 50/50 butter/Smart Balance plus omega sticks instead of regular butter and they were perfect.

Yum. Yummy. Yummification. I made this just as the recipe says except I substituted rapadura (dried sugar cane juice, less processed sugar)for the brown sugar. It was perfect to dunk in my milk and in my Irish Coffee!

I don't generally give recipes I tweak a 5, but this was just so good I broke my rule. I added 1 and a half teaspoons of cinnamon (instead of the 1/2), and I didn't have vanilla so I used maple extract. I don't know if I'll bother with vanilla since the maple worked out so well. The only thing I'll do differently next time is double the recipe. They disappeared too quickly.

absolutely wonderful.  I had previously tried 'editing' another recipe to whole wheat and it didn't work.  My husband practically vowed never to eat whole wheat baked stuff again, but he tried these and LOVED them.  By taste you cannot tell they are whole wheat!!!!

Delicious! Everyone had several and asked for the recipe. I doubled the cinnamon and vanilla, and added the white sugar and cinnamon straight to the batter, not on top. Makes a light and healthy cookie that would be great for breakfast or any time.

Wow! These are really delicious, tender cookies. Not at all what I expected from a recipe that used 100% whole wheat flour.  I followed the recipe to the letter except I doubled the vanilla extract (always do).  Only complaint was that mine didn't have that cracked top look like some snickerdoodles--still delicious, though.

I added extra cinnamon to the batter, as well as a dash of cloves, just to make the cookie itself spicier before rolling it in the cinnamon/sugar mixture. I also substituted applesauce for a bit of the butter, say 1/4 of the amount called for. And I forgot to flatten the cookies both times I baked them, so they were puffier than the picture shows, but still yummy. They're a little dry and crumbly because of the whole-wheat flour, but good with a glass of milk or cup of tea. And they taste good warm out of the oven, but even better the next day. My husband and I had a hard time NOT eating them by the handful!

The taste of these cookies were great, I did add more cinnamon to the sugar for more spice. My cookies came out somewhat flat but they had a great chewyness to them and I felt great that I was able to get whole grain in a cookie. They were also so easy and quick to make and the batch made quite a few cookies I would definitely make these again.

This recipe is really great.  I LOVE the whole wheat flavor and have already made this twice.  I used Smart Balance instead of butter the first time and I thought it gave a better flavor and texture. I couldn't keep my husband away from these!

I would call this a milk & cookies recipe.  I prepared them exactly as the recipe was written, but I did add 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon to the dough.  The whole wheat flour gives a nice slightly nutty taste, and - hey - it's good for you, right?  Eat as many as you want.  In fact, I will make these again, but I will double the recipe.  I made these today for a trip to the Outer Banks of North Carolina tomorrow, and they will probably be gone by tomorrow evening.  Baking them exactly eight minutes should give you a crisp cookie edge, and a soft middle (the cookie, not you - remember these are GOOD for you).  They flatten nicely by pressing with the bottom of a drinking glass, and rolling them in sugar/cinnamon gives a sparkle to their appearance.  This is a great easy anytime recipe.  Thanks!

These cookies were great.  It was the first time I made snickerdoodles and this recipe was so simple and easy to follow.  The whole wheat flour reminded me of oatmeal cookies.  I'll definetly make these again.

These were WONDERFUL! I added 1 tsp cinnamon to the batter before rolling it in the cinnamon-sugar mixture. I am switching to mainly whole wheat in our household & this fits the bill perfectly. Thank you so much!

awesome! awesome! awesome! I can't say enough!! I was a little skeptical about the whole wheat flour, but it turned out awesome! I was looking for a healthy cookie and I found a healthy and EASY cookie! I accidently added the c&s in the batter, but I think it enhanced it, I also added it on top before cooking. I will def. make more of this! Smells awesome and tastes great!!

These are good, healthy cookies.  I do like the flavor, but it took a minute to get used to the taste.  I would definitely make them again.
