I submitted this recipe - don't remember anything about chocolate chips. The idea is a fast and easy recipe, and the melted chips seem a bit fussy to me. And the cake doesn't need them. This is close to the top of our family favorites list. CK

Loved it!  My kids wanted to make their own dessert for a family party.  Needless to say I needed something easy because they are still quite young. This was it! We put it in a glass loaf pan so we could slice it and see all the layers.  I was surprised at how good it was for the amount of effort and they were so proud of themselves when people complimented on how good their dessert was. And I agree that it doesn't need the chocolate chips. Thanks!

GREAT - I made this completely sugar free except for the Graham Crackers and not one person could tell.  I used sugar free puddings, surgar free cool whip, and sugar free chocolate sauce to drizzle on the top.  It was delicious.  Great for calorie counters and those that are watching their sugar intake.

this was excellent and a very fast prep for dessert.  I have done this twice once using choc and banana pudding and once using choc and cheesecake both yummy!! I used the cinnamon grahm crackers to give it just a bit more sweetness, hus and coworkers love it!

made this last weekend - it was yummy!! Next time I might try using vanilla wafers instead of graham crackers - could also use any flavor pudding for a change. Definitely a keeper!!

Excellent recipe!  I was looking for something tasty, fast and easy and this was perfect - total prep time for me was about 10 to 15 minutes.  The pudding firmed up right away so I didn't bother waiting the five minutes before adding the whipped topping, (which wasn't thawed, but incorporated well anyways with a whisk)  Followed directions as written, except omitted the chocolate chips.  Chilled for about and hour and served.  The graham crackers were a still a little crunchy, but everyone said they loved it just the way it was.  The little bit leftover was eaten right away the next day by my son and he said he liked it either way, with soft or crunchy crackers.  Anyways, thanks for the post.  I think we have found a new favorite!

When I make this, I use all vanilla pudding and I frost the top with chocolate frosting instead of the melted chocolate chips.  Delicious and easy!

Very Yummy. I agree, chocolate chips were not necessary and they didn't melt very well in the microwave anyway. My Dad said this was just like the ice box cakes from the 50's!!!!

YUM! Fun and simple to make! Delicious! Without thinking, I made the puddings the way the box says to- 2 cups each. And I had to use whipped cream from a can, not the frozen stuff... I thought it would really alter my results but it turned out great anyway!

My family's favourite quick, easy and yummy dessert! It is a great treat for any special occasion.  I once accidentaly used twice the amount of whipped topping and it tasted fantastic.

This was super easy to make. I only used Vanilla pudding.  I had some very ripe bananas and added slices to the pudding layers.  I did not add chocolate on top.  It tasted like banana cream pie.  Very Good!

I also doubled the ingredients and used a 9x13 dish.  It was really easy and really good.  I served with ice cream.  A nice "make ahead" dessert!  Thanks!

This receipe did not turn out well for me!  The pudding part was good, the rest tasted like soggy graham crackers, not like cake.

Very light and yummy.  I used skim milk, light cool whip, and omitted the chocolate chips and it turned out great!  My boyfriend ate 4 pieces in one day!

Tastes like something you would get at a cafeteria style restaurant.  Super simple to make and pretty tasty, too.

I made this without the chocolate on top (doesn't really need it) and it was so good! My husband said this is his new favorite dessert!
