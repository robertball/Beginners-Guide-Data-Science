This recipe for spinach dip is very easy to make.  It's also pretty tasty.  The only thing I thought to do different next time I make it, is to cut back or omit the brown mustard.  I thought that it over-powered the dip.

This dip was a huge hit, I did make some changes. Instead of adding the mustard and hot sauce I added about 1 tbs of smoked paprika and 1/2 tbs of ground cumin. I also doubled the sour cream and cheese so the dip wasn't to thick for chips. Made the night before and reheated in the oven at 350 for 10 min and then broiled on low for about 5 min to brown the surface. It was great on chips, veggies and also pretty good on cocktail shrimp.

I just made this for my boyfriend and I to eat while watching a game and I think it turned out great! I didn't add the hot pepper sauce and I used plain yogurt instead of the sour cream. I also used two cloves minced garlic instead of the 1 tsp. Totally addictive just the way a dip should be.

Very yummy Im eating a fresh batch as I type! I only gave four stars becuase I had to tweek it to fit my taste. I omited the mustard as others suggested and I had to add garlic and onion extra cheese and salt with out these it would be on the bland side.

very good - needed a bit more spice to counteract the cheese though, so i added some veggie dip mix to it to punch it up a bit.

very yummy!! The only thing I changed was I didn't use the mustard and added 1/4 cup mayo to made it smoother for chips.

I ended up using 2 bunches of chopped fresh spinach, doubling the cheddar cheese and omitting the spicy mustard.  My bf said it had to much cream cheese.  Next time I'd probably halve the cream cheese and still double the cheddar but I will definitely make again! Thanks for the recipe!

I love how quick and easy this was! I usually make a more traditional baked spinach dip, but didn't have time for that the other night, so I tried this and it was great. I will absolutly make this again!

Cut back on the mustard and used yogurt but the flavor was wonderful.

Absolutely delicious!  I am suprised there are not 1000 reviews for this already!  I followed the recipe to the exact instructions and the taste, way better than some other spinach dip I've had at restaurants!  The only complaint I have is that once the dip has been sitting out and no longer warm, it is very thick...however still tastes great!

This was so fast and easy and it tastes great!  I did not have any sour cream so I used a combination of a little whipped dressing and milk instead.  I also excluded the spicy brown mustard (suggestion from someone else) and I added some parmasean cheese!!!  It turned out great!!!  Thanks for posting!

I also thought the mustard was overpowering (and I love mustard).  If I were to make it again, I would omit the mustard and possibly add some onion.  I would have given it a 3 as it was because the mustard taste was overpowering, but it was so easy, and I know it would be awesome without the mustard, so I gave it 4 stars.  Quick, easy recipe  :-)  Would also be yummy to add breadcrumbs to the top and bake for a few minutes.

I made this when I discovered I was out of real mayo. I used 8 oz of onion chive cream cheese and added canned asparagus. We loved it and will make again!

Great and easy recipe!  After reading everyones reviews, I didn't add the mustard and added more cheese.  I also added chopped water chestnuts, which gave it a fun crunch.

This was great! I used vegetable cream cheese instead of regular. I also added fresh basil. Mmmmm.
