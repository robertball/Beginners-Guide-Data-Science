I really likes this recipe. It was so easy and very flavorful. I used a bit more basil and garlic and also sauted the string beans in the garlic and oil befoe the chicken so I wouldn't have another pot to clean. Just take the beans out before you cook the chicken, cover them and add them back in to the oan at the end. So simple!

This was excellent !! When chicken and garlic was cooking in olive oil, I sprinkled oregano, parsley,and basil all over the chicken and garlic. I then added the fresh green beans. All I had was a big can of whole tomatoes which I then cut up into small pieces and added them and all the juice. I cooked 1 cup of mini penne and then added that. I also sprinkled parmesan cheese all over the mixture, then cooked it for a few minutes till it was good and hot. A couple of dinner rolls and you have a delicious meal. Very easy to make and very tasty. My family loved it. This definitely will be a keeper. Can't wait to make it again.

I made this the other night and it has become a favorite of my fiance and I.  I altered it a little by adding the green beans and simmered on low for about 10-15 minutes after you simmer on low for 3-5.  It adds an amazing flavor to the green beans.

I am rounding up from 3.5 stars. This was good, but bland. I had read the reviews so I added, salt, pepper, dried basil and used roasted garlic puree.... I should have taken it further with spices. Overall this was good, and it certainly was good for us. I used Allen's italian green beans from the can, just simmered them right along with the petite diced tomatoes. I wish I had made a crusty french bread to go along with this meal, or added pasta. I think the addition of shredded parmesan cheese would also be good. Thanks.

This recipe was easy and quick.  To help with the flavors use canned tomotoes with roasted garlic,oregano, basil etc. anyone of those.  and I still added more oregano (that's my favorite) I ommitted the cheese and served it over boiled potatoes.  reminded me alot of the dish I had at my boyfreind's aunt's house.

We followed the recipe almost to the letter, just added slightly more fresh basil (our garden is filled with it). It is a very appealing dish and a surprisingly good combination - well beyond my expectations. It's also one of those recipes that is excellent if you are trying to behave yourself and eat healthy; good for almost anybody's diet. I think you could add more garlic and/or more basil and make it even better. We used Italian style green beans (because I prefer the taste) but I'm sure any green beans work well with the recipe.

This was delicious served over angel hair pasta, with a crusty baguette and a fresh green salad.  Cheese and grapes followed for dessert.  I will definitely make this again!

This was an excellent dish. My family loves garlic so I used about 6 cloves of minced garlic and added parsley and oregano along with the basil. I tossed with penne pasta and sprinkled Asiago cheese on top.

This recipe is quick and pretty tasty.  My 3 year old even liked it!  The beans are just ripening in our garden, so we will probably have this meal a few times over the coming weeks!

Also, I did not have fresh basil, so I subbed with 1 T of dried basil.  It worked just fine.

This was just ok for me. Everyone else who ate it loved it. Absolutely no leftovers. If I were to make this again, I would use fresh tomatoes instead of canned and probably add chopped onion and sliced mushrooms as well.

I sauteed the green beans in garlic and oil and salt and pepper first then removed them and added the chicken.  I added salt and pepper to that too.  When browned I added the rest of the ingredients.  I served it with rice.

We thought this was a good, easy, fast dish.  I added salt, pepper, additional garlic, basil and fresh oregano (because I had it handy from putting my herb garden to bed).  The fresh green beans were great.  We're old geezers who don't need a lot of food; so the only thing I did was serve with some good crusty bread.  Nice meal.

This was a good dish.  Wasn't as quick prep as I thought it would be, but not bad.  Unfortunately it was lacking in flavours.  I served this over angel hair pasta and it just wasn't as flavourful as I thought it might have been.  Maybe some more herbs would help add some flavour, or some chopped onions.

I really enjoyed this recipe and most imprtantly so did my family.  I did add something...I chopped up two slices of bacon and sauted it with the onions and garlic...and then drizzled olive oil over it when I plated it...

This was good.  I agree with the other reviews that it was a bit bland.  When I make it again, I will add more garlic, salt, and pepper.  The fresh basil made it taste really fresh, although I still think it would be good with just dried basil.  We served it with/ on top of farfalle pasta tossed with olive oil, herbs, and parmesean.

Nice, simple dish - I added more garlic, salt and pepper with the chicken and some white wine just before adding the tomatoes.  I probably added more fresh basil than what was called for, too.  I ate it (and liked it) as is, but I think others in my family would definitely need some pasta or rice to make it complete.

This is a great recipe, nice and light and awesome way to get some extra veggies in.  I followed pretty close except I didn't cook my chicken all the way through at first, I browned it then let it simmer in the tomatoes to finish cooking.  I also added onions and more garlic and added a couple pinches of crushed red pepper to add a touch of heat.  Served over pasta with a bit of parm or feta cheese was a great meal.

Dang, that was GOOD!!  Taking the advice of others, I sauted the fresh green beans in the six cloves of garlic and 3 TBSP of olive oil.  I removed the green beans and added the chicken after pounding it some.  I aprinkled the chicken with oregano, basil, parsley and garlic salt and let it simmer.  I didn't have diced tomatoes but I did have diced tomatoes with green chilis so I added a can along with the green beans back into the pan and continued to let it simmer.   Meanwhile, I had diced up and boiled red potatoes, and when they were done, I drained them and added 1/2 stick of butter, salt and pepper, parlsey and parmesan cheese.  This dish came out great and everyone loved it.  It was quick and very tasty.  Will definitely make it again.  =P

This dish was decent, but sort of bland. I especially did not enjoy this dish the next day as leftovers. Based upon previous reviews I made a few changes: doubled the garlic, used italian-style diced tomatoes, and served over bowtie pasta tossed with olive oil, herbs, and parmesean. I probably will not make this recipe again.

This meal is really good and the best part is it's really low in fat!  I scaled the size back a little bit...2 chicken breasts, 2 cloves of garlic, 1 can of tomatoes & 1 can of green beans instead of fresh.  I chopped the chicken the night before cooking & marinated in light Italian dressing which added extra flavor.  I also dumped all of the marinade in the skillet when I cooked it to add some extra sauce.  I cooked the green beans with 1 clove of minced garlic & some pepper while the chicken was cooking so they would get some flavor.  I also mixed in 3 cups of bowtie pasta.  I'll definitely make this again!

I thought it was really good and very quick. No, it's not as flavorful as some other recipes, but light and healthy. I added lots of fresh basil, 1 can of tomatoes, sliced mushrooms and some pine nuts. If you have them available, I highly recommend adding pine nuts.

This was pretty good.  Very easy to make.  Needs more garlic or something to spice it up just a bit more.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. It was so easy to make, and delicious. It's also great because we're dieters. I did add extra garlic and used Roasted Garlic flavored tomatoes (canned), I also added a bit of previously cooked rice, and it made it a little more filling. this would also be very good with Xtra FIRM tofu instead of chicken for vegetarians.  5 stars!!!

Wow - I feel so full - that was a very satisfying meal. I paired it with rice. I resized the meal for two - and it was perfect for my husband and I. He added extra salt and pepper - but mine was perfectly flavored. Very delicious indeed -- and I would make it again.

This was just OK.  Would not make it again.  I did use dried basil instead, but I really don't think that made THAT big a difference.  It just wasn't anything special.

This was great on rice.  I made a few changes like adding butter, italian dressing, oregano and parsley just for added flavour.  Tasted great.  The only thing is that this made enough for the four of us, but if there's 6 people you may want to increase the amount you make.  Apart from that great recipe :)

This is the basis for a great meal! I would highly recommend using fresh green beans and sauteing them in olive oil with some garlic and Italian seasonings for 5-7 minutes depending on how you like them cooked. I removed mine from the pan and tossed them with Parmesan cheese. I cooked the chicken right in the same pan and also added Italian seasonings and garlic to that while cooking. We love garlic. Best part about this recipe is you can customize it with any seasonings you like. Once the chicken was cooked I added a can of fire roasted tomatoes with garlic and one with Italian seasonings a good helping of fresh basil. I let it simmer for a few minutes and then added the green beans and continued to simmer for a few minutes longer to let all the flavors blend. Served this over pasta and it was awesome, and I don't even like green beans!

After reading that this could be a little bland, I planned ahead.  I used alot of garlic (minced in the jar as I am all about quick weekday cooking!) and chicken thighs (boneless/skinless for more flavor), and sauted in olive oil together til chicken was browned on both sides. Added two cans of fire roasted garlic diced tomatoes, Costco's No Salt seasoning that is similar to their old Tuscan seasonings and let simmer.  Added several splashes generous splashes of balsamic vinegar which I believe gives the final product alot of flavor and more richness.  You do not taste the vinegar in case  you are not a vinegar fan.  I ended up cooking the green beans seperate with seasoning but on the plate they mixed together for a nice combo.  Very fast and easy recipe that my family loved and they thought I made from scratch!!

The comments were helpful.  The amount of tomato is what causes the blandness. 
I followed suggestion of sauteing the green beans first in Garlic and oil.
 I added more basil when I sauted the chix and garlic and also added some zinfindel.  When chix was done, I removed the chix and reduced liquid to almost nothing.  Then I added the tomatoes,  1 t sugar, and some cognac.    Salt & Pepper along the way.  It was great with bowties.

This is a great recipe - we love it, however, I tweeked this recipe for 2.  I added an 8 oz. can of no salt tomato sauce to 1 can of diced tomatoes; added italian spices, oregano and basil.  I added a 4.5 oz. jar of mushrooms and chopped onion and poured it all over the cooked, sliced chicken, garlic and oil. I let that simmer for 1/2 hour then added the freshly steamed green beans.   I served it over mini-rigatoni pasta.

This was excellent. I altered the original recipe a little, though. I added Italian seasoning, salt and pepper to the chicken while it was cooking and used stewed tomatoes with Italian seasoning instead of plain diced tomatoes. I served it over spaghetti.

This was easily a "10" out of 10 in my house!!  Everyone loved it.  I followed the recommendation to use diced tomatoes with spices added, and added a chopped onion to the garlic.  I also marinated the chicken pieces in balsamic vinegar for about 30 minutes.
Thanks for the great, easy addition to our menus!

I made this last night. It was super easy & fast - perfect for a nice weeknight dinner. Other reviewers suggested adding balsamic vinegar, fresh tomatoes (instead of canned) & pine nuts. I didn't have pine nuts, so I added a handful  of slivered almonds. I put it over penne, because it was what I had, but I think spaghetti or rice would be better, as the sauce is rather thin (but delicious!) I do agree with another reviewer though - no way would that be enough for 6. Maybe 4... In any case, it's a quick, easy & delicious recipe! Thanks for sharing!

I loved this dish. I took the advice of another cook and added two slices of bacon while cooking the garlic for added flavor. Be careful of the advice to add Italian style chopped tomatoes as they are loaded with sugar and unneeded carbs. This recipe is naturally low in carbs so skip the store bought recipes and add your own italian spices to your canned tomatoes and keep it healthy.

We LOVED this dish!! To add a depth of flavor, I marinated the chicken in Italian dressing before saute it. I didn't have any fresh herbs on hand so I used dried. I served it over bowtie pasta. YUM. It has made it into our regular rotation.

Very good, quick and healthy meal!  I only had 1 can of chopped tomatoes, but I did have another can of tomatoes w/ green chiles...I didn't know how that would turn out, but it gave it a nice little kick, so I will use that in the future.  I will definately make again!

This was pretty good with changes I added fresh parsley, black pepper and dried oregano and only used one can of tomatoes. I used tofu for my eldest daughter and actually think that was better than the chicken. We had this with new potatoes and a green salad. Thanks.

Rather bland, although to be fair I did not have fresh herbs, which may have made all the difference.  I added the two cans of tomatoes as called for, next time I would only add one- it was very tomato-y.

My garden is producing a nice crop of green beans, so I've been prowling for good bean recipes.  This one was excellent, in that the beans add flavor and texture to the sauce, which tastes great over rice without being a visual serving a green beans (not again, mom!) on the plate. Next time I will try it with pasta.

I don't know why I chose rice- maybe because we had enjoyed some lamb stew over rice, so I was in the rice mindset.  If you are hesitant because of the tomato based sauce, don't be.  It was really delicious and I used a jasmine rice.

Very good. I wanted something that I could combine left over chicken and tomatoes. I also had a pound of fresh green beans that I needed to use up. This recipe was perfect. Quick and easy. Don’t forget to season it with a bit of salt to your liking. Will make this again.

I made this on the barbecue, in a pan. Sautéed the garlic in olive oil with the green beans, removed beans and sautéed chicken, when chicken was cooked, then added chopped fresh tomatoes with parsley and basil, added the beans back in to heat up for 2-3 mins. Absolutely delicious.

Made this exactly as written with one substitute.  I used Hunts Spicy Red Pepper diced tomatoes.   This gives the recipe a kick of flavor.  If you don’t like spicy beware!  My husband loves it.

After reading other reviews about flavor being lacking. I added a few things that made it fantastic. I kicked up the garlic and then added 1 chopped onion, 1/4 cup white wine, 1 chicken bouillon cube, mushrooms and salt and pepper.  For a healthy dinner I put it over cooked spaghetti squash. The family loved it and will make again.

I love this recipe, it's so easy! I used canned green beans instead of fresh ones, but it still turned out excellent. The garlic and basil impart the perfect amount of flavor into the tomatoes, making a wonderfully delicious, easy, and healthy dish.

I thought this needed a LOT more seasoning. Next time I may try the tomatoes with basil and oregano, as well as adding more of those as well. I served it over rotini, and I need to make sure the beans are broken into smaller pieces next time.

enjoyed this dish, but like others have said - cooked as is - it is bland. It allowed me to play with flavours.  Thank You..RSx

We enjoyed this healthy and easy to prepare dish very much.  Like others, I doubled the garlic b/c that's what we like.  The chicken turned out a little overdone, though, so next time I'll prepare the green beans w/ the garlic and olive oil first, and move them to a plate so I can saute the chicken. I'll add the tomato mixture toward the end, and simmer for just a few minutes before serving.  That should keep the chicken from overcooking.  Loved this though!

Very tasty and easy. I had a lot of fresh tomatoes from our garden so used those instead of canned and also added salt, pepper and some Italian seasoning. My husband said it was very good but needed a bit more seasoning. Next time more garlic and spices would probably make it a 5.

This was phenomenal! Very Easy and tasty! I wasn't so sure about adding the diced tomatoes but tried it anyways and was glad I did. It was a nice twist and made it juicier. I am a Hawaiian, Puerto Rican and season everything. So the only change I made was adding some seasonings like a little salt,pepper, onion powder, and I didn't have fresh basil so I used dried but it still came out tasty. I will definitely make this again!

I served it over pasta because I wanted to add a carb to the meal.  It was a good, easy weeknight supper, but nothing spectacular.

Used fresh/steamed green beans as instructed to in the recipe and added some garlic pepper seasoning to the chicken cubes prior to cooking.   Used 6 garlic cloves as you can never have enough garlic. Thought that the chicken mixture was a little soupy to start with so I let it evaporate to desired amount that I thought would go with the spaghetti. Served over whole grain thin spaghetti. Great for a light/healthy meal.

Loved it - quick, easy and tasty.    One addition - I added fresh, sliced mushroom, just before adding the green beans.  I love mushrooms and they are a great addition to this meal.

Delicious! I stayed quite close to the original, but when it came time to simmer the garlic, chicken, tomatoes and basil, I threw in a heaping handful of penne noodles. We ate it as an all-in-one meal. (Though, it would have been delicious with some really fresh, French bread.) Some reviewers have complained that the dish was too bland -- we felt the garlic and basil were perfect, and it really let the flavours come through without being overpowered. The diced tomatoes I used had salt, so there was no need to add any. Can't wait to make this again soon. :)

This is a great heart healthy recipe. It didn't leave you feeling bogged down and the taste was surprisingly wonderful.  I steamed fresh green beans while browning the chicken. I didn't have fresh basil, so I added one teaspoon dry basil. I served it over rice spaghetti and sprinkled a little parmesean cheese for a finishing touch.  My 20 and 23 year old sons loved it and hubby might not be so chubby if he continues to eat like this.

We love this recipe, with a few modifications. I only use 2 diced chicken breasts for the whole recipe and then add a can of garbanzos. I also add black olives (sliced in half, lengthwise). I then make a simple polenta to serve the chicken over. My husband and both kids (3 & 4) eat it up!

Loved this.  Added onions to the garlic in the pan, but kept it the same other than that.  (Frozen green beans work fine!) Served it over rice instead of pasta since the sauce comes out a little thin.  Awesome healthy quick meal!

This recipe was great.  My whole family loved it.  It was simple to prepare and very healthy.  I served it with brown rice and it was under 350 calories per serving.  I would definitely make it again.

Found this recipe looking for a way to use up garden produce.  Like another reviewer, I used halved cherry tomatoes instead of canned with about a teaspoon of sugar. Had so much basil that I added 1/2 cup chopped.  I doubled the garlic, and microwaved the green beans to soften before adding them,  Served the final product with whole wheat blend rotini pasta.  YUM!  There are no leftovers, so I'll just have to make it again. :)

With a few of the changes that other reviewers suggested, this recipe receives five stars.  I added 3/4 Tbs each of dried Parsley, Basil, and Oregano.  I didn't have canned tomatoes at the time, but 3 fresh tomatoes diced worked great.  My husband and I really enjoyed this quick and delicious recipe.

Excellent recipe if you add some extra spices. First of all, I used a whole bulb of garlic, and I probably still could have used more. I used dried oregano, dried parsley, and a lot more fresh basil than the recipe called for. I put salt and pepper and just a bit of red pepper flakes to give it a tiny kick. I served it over brown rice cooked in chicken stock. It was excellent, and my boyfriend loved it too. I will definitely be cooking this one again. It's so healthy and has great flavor. Easy to make, but took a little bit longer than I thought it would to prepare.

I have made this several times and my family loves it! I follow the recipe exactly but as others have said fresh tomatoes would probably taste great as a sub. for canned. I make sure we have some chewy bread to soak up the yummy juice. Also I have not tried it over pasta but that sounds like a good idea!

I really like this recipe.  I made it my own by adding 1 onion to the sauted garlic, and to the sauce I add 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar, 1/3 cup diced sundried tomatoes (I have the kind that is in a jar of oil), and 1 tsp of cayanne pepper.

I adore this recipe for 3 reasons.... quick, healthly, and YUMMY! I add a few of my favorite seasonings to spice it up, but everything else I keep the same usually. I cook this atleast once a month! I serve over white rice, and my fiance loves it, he even takes the leftovers for lunch the next day!

The name of this recipe doesn't sound like it tastes.  The name has no pizzaz but the taste sure does.  We have used this recipe several times over the last few months and tremendously enjoyed each time.  It's one of those recipes that not only tastes good, it also looks good.  Don't forget the hot crusty bread.

This was a quick and delicious dinner. From prep time to table was only about 35 minutes!  Next time I'd probably snap the green beans the night before so I could have everything ready to go when I get home from work.  Great recipe!

This was alright... i added some asparagus to it, and that was pretty good, it just came out a little too wet and didn't have a ton of flavor. IT was ok, but i probably won't make it again.

Very good and easy to make.  I used precooked chicken,only one can of diced tomatoes and a can of French style string beans.  Served it over rice.  My husband loved it and took the leftovers to lunch.  I'll make this again.
