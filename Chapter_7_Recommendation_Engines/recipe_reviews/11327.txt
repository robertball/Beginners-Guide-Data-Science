This recipe has been in our family for over 50 years. We use it every Christmas season. There is a slight difference in rolling out the dough. We roll it out paper thin, then add Solo Brand Poppy Seed, Almond, or any type of preserves you like. When we cut out the dough with a glass, we fill it, then we fold the corners to make a small popover, then we pierce it with a fork to keep it together. We cook them for 12- 14 minutes. Everything else is pretty much the same. If you would like more info, contact me via email. This is a wonderful recipe.

I made several batches of these over the holidays, and received many compliments!  I used apricot, raspberry and sour cherry preserves.  Also, I used large cookie cutters to make them look especially festive!

These were beautiful! I didn't need to add anything extra to them. I used Haagan Daaz(sp?) Vanilla and added it with my hands because I don't have dough hooks, and I had to defrost myself several times with warm water. I realize now I could have worn gloves, but it doesn't matter. I rolled the cookies to about 1/4 inch thickness, and made the holes with my thumb. I filled the holes with strawberry preserves. The cookies were perfect, good flavor, texture, and appeararance. Also easy to make. MAke this recipe!!!

I made a couple of batches before getting this right.  I did need to add more flour (about 2/3c) to get the dough just right.  Making the 1/8 inch circles did not work for me. After baking for 20 minutes, the center was not done..I baked and baked, the center never cooked and the edges were getting dark...I threw that batch away.  I saw another reviewer had mentioned rolling them paper thin and folding them over with the filling inside.  I did this and they came out perfectly (I reduced heat to 325 and checked them frequently)  Thanks for sharing, I will definately make this again.

This is a wonderful recipie and got rave reviews from my mother who made kolackys for years. I did find the dough a bit wet and adding an extra 2/3c. of four helped greatly.When rolling out the cookies we use powdered sugar instead of flour. It gives the cookies an added sweetness. The only other variant is the way  way we cut out the cookies. We cut squares aproxamently 2x2 and add a small dollop of lekvar, apricot or nut filling then roll tightly pressing the open ends to seal. Thank you so much for posting this recipie and giving me a wonderful holiday cookie from my childhood.

I hope this is helpful to those trying this for the first time.  This is a pastry and should be made with butter-not margerine-or spreads.  Butter is from cream, margerine is from soybean or corn oil and a spread contains up to 50% water.  There is a huge difference in using butter vs. margerine, and an even bigger difference if you use a spread.  The success of this recipe depends on using butter. Those reviews that recommend adding more flour are likely not using butter and are also likely to have a tougher pastry as a result of adding more flour.  This recipe is perfect as written and these pastries will melt in your mouth if you make them as directed. Refrigeration will firm up the dough so you can cut out your pastries.  We make these at Christmas and special occasions and use holiday cookie cutters.  You can roll the dough out using powdered sugar (don't use flour-it will make them tough), but I roll out dough on wax paper on my cookie sheets, adding no powdered sugar if possible.  I return it to the fridge to firm before cutting out the shapes with cookie cutters and place them on the baking sheet.  Do this quickly as the butter will return to room temp and be difficult to cut.  If this happens, return to the fridge till firm and continue cutting out cookies.  After baking, then sprinkle with powdered sugar or drizzle with a glaze.  I've never used a jelly or jam as they are thinner than the solo brands of fruit fillings.  This will be a 10 star pastry for you.

The cookies are great!  I did both the popover and the regular cutouts.  A little messy for my cookie sheets.  They puff up alot more than I expected, which gave me trouble with figuring out when they were completely cooked.  I also had to add flour to get them to a point where I could roll them out.

These were awesome! It needs a little extra flour, though. I used fresh raspberries from my raspberry bush, mashed them, put them in a saucepan, added some corn starch plus a little water, then I cooked it for a couple of minutes until it thickened. I suggest using fresh fruit and cook it like I did...it is really delicious! They turned out great!

I've used this recipe for nearly 40 years.  My grandmother had a SOLO pie filling cookbook that we made many recipes from and this was one of them.  I usually make 3 or 4 batches every Christmas and my boys can't get enough!  And sooo easy!

A Kolacky is a pastry that is filled; not a cookie. That being said; these are SO good! There is NO need to add extra flour (like some reviewers have stated, the recipe as written is perfect) however, You MUST use butter in order to get the dough to set up right and you must let it chill overnight. I can't speak for those who used their hands instead of dough hooks, but these were easy to make. A little time consuming but well worth it. The secret is to use powdered sugar instead of flour when rolling it out and to cut all your shapes out 1st before adding your preserves & folding them, that way the dough is still chilled. Roll it thinner than 1/8 inch, because they puff up while cooking. Cut the dough into circles or squares, add the preserves, fold them over, then pinch them closed. ( I cut out both shapes since I made 2 different flavors.)  These pastries when made into a turnover look more appealing and aren't  messy at all. I cooked them for 20-25 minutes and opted not to roll them in powdered sugar at the end. (they didn't need it) Enjoyed with a cup of hot tea, Yum! I will definitely make these again. Edit: Blueberry was better than strawberry and all pastries were eaten after only 3 days. I will be making more blueberry ones this week!

I was reading all of the bad reviews.  This is a polish cookie!  There is not a lot of flavor to the dough so that the flavor of whatever preserve you use.  I also add at least 2 tbl. of sugar to my dough.  You also have to sprinkle them with powdered sugar, and a heavy duty mixer is a must!  We have been eating these kolacky since I can remember and the whole family loves them.  They are a tradition in our house!  I can't believe that this recipe is on here!  We have been making this recipe for at least 40 years, as someone else had mentioned.  Except our recipe was from a clipping in the newspaper.  This is the BEST kolacky recipe ever.  The dough is so flaky and my family absolutely loves them.  Don't let the ice cream scare you off, you only have to let it soften, not melt!  A really easy recipe!

I had to play around with this a bit to get it to work for me.  I've made thumpbrint cookies before and had few difficulties, but this is a different type of thumbprint cookie; actually, I would argue this is more of a pastry dough and the final product makes me think of a tart or mini pie. So, I ended up putting the dough in my muffin tin and making them into pastry cups, which worked exceedingly well.  Although you can get thumbprint type cookies, part of the reason it is hard is bc this dough puffs up and doesn't really keep the thumbprint.  The dough itself is wonderful; I kept some back to use as a piecrust for my next fruit pie.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for a "World Cultures Day" at my daughter's school - she had "The Czech Republic". Although I felt they took a longer time than expected to prepare, I took another reviewer's advice and used French Vanilla ice cream. They turned out very tasty and one parent even told me they were her favorite dish of the day. I would consider that a success.

This was a nice, easy to roll out dough. I used icing sugar instead of flour to roll it with. I would like to try making this with a peppermint ice cream or choc chip mint for something a little different. Over all pretty nice.

These are incredible--everyone asks for them at Christmas!  Love.
My only tip is to make the most out of the first time you roll the dough--the second roll-out is not nearly as good.

I made these and they are to me just o.k. dough need's  some flavor, vanilla flavoring maybe, vanilla ice cream just not enough for the dough part, as long as you get a bite of the preserves with it o.k. Not to sure I will take the time to make again.

These were okay, but way more work than they were worth.  The dough was so hard to mix, and after it chilled it was really hard to roll out.

Yummy, cook them at 300F for 45-60min.  When I followed the temperature and time suggested here, they did not cook well inside.

I had difficulty deciding how to rate this, so decided to start with 0 stars and work my way up.  I loved the idea.  (I was curious about the ice cream!)   (+1 star).  I followed this recipe to a "T", and really enjoyed making them (+1 star), and was quite surprised I did not run into any of the problems listed by other reviewers, such as spreading, messy jam, or sticky dough, or having to add exta flour or milk.  Simply awesome and fun to make!  (+2 stars).  When they were finally in the oven, both my hubby and I were so excited.  They looked good and smelled GREAT!  (+1 for 5/5).  I watched them like a hawk because of others having trouble with baking all the way through.  Not the case here.  They turned out evenly browned and baked through (an added plus in my book when I can accomplish what others can't)  (+1 for 6/5).  And very fluffy and nice (+1 for 7/5).  BUT When they cooled and were tasted, all the excitement dissipated quickly.  They were quite bland(-3 for 4/5) -- until we added the icing sugar, which is not listed in the ingredients and should be.  (-1 for 3/5)   Not sure we will waste ice cream or money for this again.  And for the calorie-wise -- 504 calores for 3 cookies?! That's almost 164 calories per cookie without the confectioners' sugar.  Whipping cream and sugar (or maybe even Cool Whip?) might even be better -- at least it will be cheaper.  Cool idea, though (No pun intended) -- and I'm always up for experimentation.:D

I am not the best baker - my cookies normally go in the garbage but this recipe was amazing!!!  I followed the directions and used strawberry jam for the filling.  The cookies were so tasty and easy to make.  I am going to make them again for my christmas party!!!

I followed the recipe exactly, and the dough did not turn out well, it was still like liquid the next day.  So I just made drop cookies and put a little bit of jam in the middle and they still turned out ok.

Fabulous Recipe, everyone that has tried the cookies loves them.  Its like eating a fabulous paistry.  All I can say to someone having trouble with getting it right is that you need to use real butter.  It makes it so yummy and flakey wether they are warm from the oven of a week old...So so so good :)

Not sure what I did wrong with the recipe, but the dough was impossible to roll out, way too sticky.  So, instead, I rolled into small balls, put them on the cookie sheet and then pressed down in the center with my thumb and filled.  So more like a thumbprint cookie.  I didn't find that the cookies had a lot of flavor, maybe better with vanilla or almond extract?  They were good, but a little plain.

Great taste but be conservative with your dough.  You cannot use the scraps and reroll it out.  Even after freezing it for 20 min.  Maybe using a pizza cutter and cutting out squares so there is no waste.

Great recipe.  I was a little worried when I finished the dough as it seemed very hard.  In the morning I let dough sit out to soften a little before attempting to roll-out.  I followed a reviewer's suggestion and rolled dough out on baking stones covered with wax paper.  I cut out with glass and then just removed outer edges and didn't have to move cut cookie.  Cookies shrink up so I could cut them close together and get a dozen on each cookie sheet.  Didn't need any flour to roll out as long as I only rolled in one direction.  I used a decorator tip to squirt jelly on cookie. I was able to get 4 1/2 dozen with one batch using an average size glass.

There's hope for this recipe.  After almost throwing this dough out the back door, I took a deep breath and decided there must be an answer to making this combo work. I thought about the ice cream and the fact that it needed to freeze up in order to make the dough firm up.  I put a cup of the dough in the freezer for about 15 minutes to see if it would firm up.  In the meantime, I mixed a cup of powdered sugar and a cup of flour together for rolling out the dough. (My mother-in-law taught me to use an old sheet for rolling out dough..an old German trick which works well and is an easy cleanup).  I coated the sheet well with the sugar/flour mixture and them rolled the dough into a ball and then the dough was easy to roll out.  I had to keep flipping the dough over to keep it well dusted and kept dusting the rolling pin too.  I used a biscuit cutter to cut the circles and they flopped right out of the cutter on to the Pam sprayed cookie skeet.  The first batch stuck to the cookie sheet and that's when I decided to use Pam.  I put an indention in each cookie and used cherry jam which ran quite a bit.  Oh, I also added a 1/2 cup powdered sugar to the dough because it tasted bland.  All in all the cookies were a hit with my husband and they did taste pretty good.  I don't know if I will try this again because it was a lot of work.  Another thing confusing was the softness of the butter.  Mine was soft so I did not get a crumbled mixture.  I guess the butter should be cold.

Maybe I did something wrong, but these cookies didnt turn out for me. They tasted like flour! I was so hopeful after reading all the wonderful reviews, but I just couldnt get them to turn out. Probably my own errors, but  I was dissappointed.

I made this with vanilla and mango ice creams, And I have to say the vanilla was wayy better!! I rolled it out real thin, and filled it with a coconut-icing sugar mix, and it tasted amazing!! I also made some thumbprints and filled them with orange marmalade, and that was great too. everyone requested I make them again soon! thanks for a great and easy recipe!!

well, i picked this recipe because it looked easy and I am totally useless at baking. As predicted, I made a complete mess of this.  The icecream melted all over the place and it became one big soggy mess! I don't know what I did wrong. I need to make some cookies for an exchange.

We did a taste test.  Friends of ours claim this is the best dough.  So I made the usual cream cheese dough and this one with ice cream.  The ice cream dough is easier to work with I think and it puffs up much nicer.  But I like the taste of the cream cheese dough better.

This recipe has been in my family for 60 years. You HAVE to make it with vanilla ice cream that's made with SUGAR and not corn syrup or they will not firm up or brown properly.

This recipe was pretty easy except for the mixing of the dough and trying to get the butter and the ice cream into a smooth ball. I separated the dough into three sections that made it easier to roll out on the floured board. I used SOLO brand prune and apricot, which I have used before with the recipe for cream cheese dough. I love the taste of this recipe because it does not have the after taste of the cream cheese, you taste the prune and apricot. I did let them bake longer then the 15 minutes that was suggested, they held their shape nicely and were slightly brown on the bottom. I also used a smaller size biscuit cutter to make them a smaller size.  Nice flakey dough, good taste and I will make them again.

And how for something completely "Different" with this recipe.
I use this recipe for "Thumbprint cookies" and
I let the butter and ice cream sit together overnight,
add 3/4 cup regular sugar while creaming then
add 1 Tbl. vanilla flavoring and this will improve the taste before
addding the flour. I also use this as a vanilla cookie.  I have
split the dough and added Lemon flavoring instead of vanilla.
Taste the mixture before adding the flour and experiment.
I never roll out the dough.

These have become a Christmas tradition at my house.  We bake half with blueberry preserves and half with raspberry.  They taste more like an airy biscuit than a cookie, but they disappear very quickly.

Just wasn't impressed with this recipe.  Very rich, dense cookie.

Super popular. Really cold, wish I had my kitchenaid before Christmas when I made these! I tried them with some plum jam and some leftover cranberry sauce. The sauce was messy and not attractive (once the liquid cooked out) but tasted really good. I used up all my plum jam =( for this, but nobody else regretted that!

Hmm, unusual for sure and enjoyed them.  Not sure if I would make them again.  My dough was very stiff, and didn't give at all in the oven.  The jam bubbled over.  Not sure I'd make them again.

I had never heard of Kolacky but was very intrigued by the recipe. I or my family didn't care for these. It just tasted like pie dough with some jam on it. They do not keep well, becoming soggy in one day in a air tight container. They were best shortly after baking. I used regular vanilla ice cream, maybe would be better with a richer version. I didn't find any trouble mixing the dough but it never formed a smooth dough. I used my heavy duty Kitchen Aid with the dough hook. To those who like Kolacky I think it is an easy recipe, for those who think it is a butter cookie.... it is not.

I made this with store-brand low fat vanilla ice cream. It was still good, but highly recommend going ahead and using a high quality regular vanilla ice cream (not low fat). I think it will definitely make a difference. However, it was great still, just more on the less-sweet side, which was totally fine!

I was disappointed with these.  They were SO much work... from mixing in the ice cream with rubber gloves to cutting out each cookie...  and then they just didn't keep very well.  They got very soggy and gross.  No one in my family even wants to eat them.  My mom actually said they're a good kind of cookie to have around--because they aren't tempting you to snack on them!  :o(  I won't be making them again.  Ever.

I made these cookies and was told that they tasted as they should have by other people but we found them very flat in taste and would not make them again.

My fiance has been ating these not stop since they came out of the oven.  I used Ben & Jerry's Cinnamon Buns Ice cream and Trader Joe's Pumpkin Butter & Cranberry Apple Butter for the filling. I also use the backside of  the larger side of a melon baller for the indent instead of my thumb and the smaller side to fill the cookie.  Didn't find the dougf to be hard to work with or dry,  i did follow others suggestions & added 2/3 cup more flour to the mix.  Will definatley make these again & experiment with other ice cream flavors.

These looked really good when finished and the dough was really nice to work with, however they weren't sweet enough for my family.  Tasted like flour with jam and powdered sugar.  They did look like professional cookies.  I have never tasted kolacky before so maybe this is just how they taste, lol.

Agreed with all the reviews that said these "have no taste", "dough too sticky", etc. Floury, dry, and tasteless. We stopped baking them after the second sheet. The dough was workable after adding a bit more flour and refrigerating for a while. The cookies  came out with slightly browned  bottoms, a flaky, pastry-like interior, and no taste.

My only complaint was the fact that it was messy! Putting your thumb in the middle really doesn't do much for making sure the jam doesn't go all over the place. If I could do 4 1/2 I would because that's not enough of a reason to keep me from making this again. It was delicious!

I was given a few jars of preserves and needed a recipe to use them in. I received this recipe in an email and decided to try it out before Christmas. I used a Kitchen Aid mixer with the bread dough hook and it couldn't have been easier. They are delicious! I was worried about the actual cookie not being sweet enough, but that wasn't a problem at all. They taste just like the sandwich cookies that we buy at the bakery (and that my sister and I fight over!). I can't wait to make them again for Christmas next week since I just finished up the last one! These will definitely be added to my list of annual Christmas cookies.

These cookies were not the easiest to make - freezing fingers and very stiff to roll out the next day after a night in the 'frig.  However, I had high hopes based on the reviews---and it had ice cream in it!  They were good and everyone who ate them liked them; some loved them.  To me they tasted like a flat, flaky biscuit with jelly on it. Thus, the four stars.

So yummy and easy. I wasn't sure about the dough before cooking, but the cookie turned out great. It is very buttery and flaky. I used homemade boysenberry jam and Trader Joe's pumpkin butter to fill the thumbprints.

The funny thing about making this was that I followed everyone tips in making it a turnover and I really should have left it alone. The original directions were great other than the extra flour needed. They were a huge hit with my FIL. I did glaze some with sugar water, but you couldn't tell the difference between the ones I did and didn't so it wouldn't have matter. After I finally followed the original directions everything went smoothly.

This was bland.  I thought the ice cream would make it really good.  How can you go wrong with ice cream.  The  5 year old didn't like it, I didn't like it but my wife likes to dunk them in coffee.

The cookie does not have the rich flavor expected, it lacks flavor.  The only good thing on the cookie is the jam, but not worth the effort.  I ate them, but not one other person liked them at all, including my 4 year old granddaughter.

These were okay, but not the rich delicacy that I was expecting. Also, it's hard to make an indention in a cookie 1/8 of an inch thick that will hold 1/2 tsp of jam. And the recipe didn't state whether the butter should be cold or soft.

I thought by the other reviews, that this would be a great recipe. But mine turned out with no taste except for the jam. The dough itself was tasteless. If someone knows What I did wrong Please let me know.

Like so many other reviewers, this recipe was handed down to me by my mother-in-law.  I simply must make it every holiday, and occasionally throughout the year too. Thanks for posting!
