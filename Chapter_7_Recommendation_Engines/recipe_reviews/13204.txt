Easy to make, and quick to boot! I wouldn't put so much orange zest in it, though. It overpowers the overall taste. Otherwise if you're a fan of cold soups this one is pretty decent.

I love avocados but did not enjoy this.  Perhaps it would be good if tweaked to enhance the flavor of the avocado instead of just relying on it.

Perhaps I'm not too keen on avocados, but this seemed a little bland.  I used fresh ginger and that taste didn't blend very nicely.  My hubby (who is REALLY picky) actually like this more than me, but I added sugar and topped it with whipped cream.  Not thinking I'll make this again, but it's definitely worth a try!
