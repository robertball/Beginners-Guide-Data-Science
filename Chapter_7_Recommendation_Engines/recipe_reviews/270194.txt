These were the best wings I've ever made. We devoured the whole 3 pounds I made. I didn't make the sauce but used bottled wing sauce and BBQ sauce. Next time I'll at least double if not triple it. The were delicious and a lot less greasy then regular wings either fried or baked.

I loved these. Making them in the airfryer is so easy. The wings are super crispy and not oily. The sauce is delicious. I used Chinese rice wine with 4% acidity, which turned out nicely. I served these with white rice and cool veggies to tame the heat.

A little suggestion, when I make the sauce for the wings, I would heat the sauce plus and some jelly, any kind would do, this will make the wings sticky.
