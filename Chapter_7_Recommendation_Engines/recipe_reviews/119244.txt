Since my fruit was super sweet, I used about a tbsp. of honey instead of the sugar, the grated rinds and juices of one lime and one orange.  No soda in the house, so I added a splash of club soda before serving, although the carbonation didn't really do anything for me - this would have stood on it's own quite well!  Makes an elegant presentation in tall glasses, and is also quite pretty in a large serving bowl.  A nice touch of elegance to a brunch or tea table.  Really enjoyed this, and I will surely make again! Thanks for sharing!

I didn't measure the melons & I used honeydew melon, sprite melon & blueberries. Everyone enjoyed this but most felt that it was a little too "minty".... maybe because I had more sauce versus melon ratio? I served it in  tall glasses w/ teaspoons. Thanks for the recipe Sue Ross!

This salad was delicious and refreshing. At first it tasted like there was too much orange, but the orange flavor mellowed after 2 days or so. Next time I might reduce the amount of orange juice and Splenda just to see how that tastes, but overall, this recipe is excellent as is.
