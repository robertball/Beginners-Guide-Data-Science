Delicious! Didn't have sesame oil, so I added some sesame seeds when sautéing the garlic. Left out the oyster sauce, used extra hoisin. Subbed rice wine vinegar for the red wine but I think it would be very similar either way. Had ramen noodles on hand so served it with them.  Really delicious way to use stuff you've got on hand to make a tasty Asian-inspired dish!

This is very good.  There are a lot of ingredients in the marinade, but once that part is done, it is easy to complete.  I did cut the chili sauce in half and it was plenty spicy.  I'll definitely make this one again!

I made this as directed except for substituting venison loin for the beef. Marinated overnight. I might add a little fresh ginger next time because the wife likes ginger.

Excellent flavor,  so simple to make. Substituted different Chinese noodles because that was what I had on hand. I'll definitely make it again and again.

Very tasty- my changes were due to personal taste and habiit.  I used 8 oz wide rice sticks for the noodles, rice vinegar, and peanut oil to saute the vegetables. I grilled a pound of top sirloin medium rare, sliced it and marinated it for about 30 minutes. I doubled everything else and had the amount of dinner I wanted. I sauted the onion (1 sweet onion cut in slivers), added the garlic then the broccoli flowers. When the broccoli was bright green and slightly cooked, I added the beef and marinade to heat up, then the noodles. My husband needed more heat and added Sriracha sauce to his dinner. Yum.

This is the second time I have tried this recipe. The first time I followed the recipe I can't say I really enjoyed the result. I marinaded the meat  and broccoli for the stated time. I found the meat was very salty after cooking and the broccoli made tough and discoloured by the marinade. 1 cup  of broccoli was not nearly enough either. The flavour over all was quite good, and made the recipe worthy of a second try -  with alterations. Second time around I marinaded the meat for a couple of hours only and blanched the broccoli - using much more this time - before adding it to the pan just before serving. This way it kept its colour and bite.  You could use a cheaper cut of meat for this, because it is tenderised with the marination. The addition of about 1/2  tsp cornflour mixed with 1 1/2 tsp water to the sauce at the end of cooking makes a slightly thicker sauce which holds onto the noodles a lot better. This is a 'once in a while' dish because of the salty sauces, but nevertheless a good standby if you have a bit of time for preparation and want a quick meal with not too much cooking at the end of it.

This entree was excellent!  Tasted just like I got it at a Chinese restaurant.  I also made beef fried rice to eat with it as a side.  I just cooked the rice in beef broth and added onions and peas and the other ingredients for making beef friend rice.

I made this without the Chow Mein, used brown rice instead. Loved the flavor, it’s simply amazing! We use the leftover steaks that have been grilled on the Traeger for this recipe, which adds a little smoke flavor. My boyfriend LOVES this, and always asks for it after a steak dinner.

This recipe is a keeper. I added more broccoli. The photo accompanying the recipe includes red peppers, which I will include next time I make this dish. If adding extra ingredients, I suggest increasing the amount of marinade used.
