Easy to follow recipe and the cake turned out perfect! The cake was also super moist with the added addition of the pudding. It has been years since making a Pineapple Upside Down Cake and the first time making it in a Bundt Pan, so I was a bit nervous. I made this for a work function and they loved it!

The cake is very moist.  I do add a little more brown sugar, that and the pineapple is the best part.

My husband likes moist cakes and he liked this one as did our guests.  I didn't have the cherries so used  a can of whole cranberry sauce instead.  It worked fine, using a half teaspoon for the spots where cherries should be.
