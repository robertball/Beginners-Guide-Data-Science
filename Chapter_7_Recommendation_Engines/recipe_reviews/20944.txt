My husband and I love eggplant but dont like all the oil with frying so this recipe was really great.  We substituted sour cream for the whipping cream and did not boil the eggplant first; just to keep the eggplant firmer and less fat.  Really yummy!

YUM YUM! Very pleased with this! Changed it a bit though. I added 2 cloves of garlic, used 200ml of cooking cream to make it more saucey. I only had a 1/4 cup of cheddar so used 1/2 cup parmesan. I don't live in the US so I don't know what poultry spice is so I used half a veg stock cube. 
Will be making this again and eating the leftovers for lunch tomorrow.

I liked this recipe a lot!  My husband thought it was excellent as well.  I will mention that this recipe is for those who have had eggplant before.

I used half mayo half reconstituted milk and I didn't boil the eggplant.  I didn't add the spices either and instead added a fourth a cup of salsa.  I also used bread crumbs instead of cubes.  I mixed it all together and sprinkled with half the cheese.  I didn't skin the eggplant either because most of the good nutrients are in the skin.

Fabulous!  We're in a CSA and I was running out of ways to prepare eggplant.

I used a little more cheddar than called for, substituted half the flour with arrowroot powder (my thickener of choice), and threw in a small onion, minced and cooked in olive oil with some 
herbes de provence and lots of garlic powder, deglazed with some Jack Daniel's.

I also roasted the eggplant ahead of time instead of boiling, and since I didn't have any poultry seasoning, I used seasoned salt, cumin, and more garlic powder.

I can't believe how great this tastes.

Yummy!  My second attempt at making eggplant was a success(first attempt was a disasterous baba ganoush).  I added diced cooked chicken and a can of mild green chilies and used monterey jack cheese instead of cheddar and used bread crumbs instead of cubes.  I didn't have heavy cream so I used sour cream thinned down with some milk.  It wasn't very pretty, but was very tasty!

Well....pretty bad news.  My 5 year old refused to touch it-My 8 year old said it was disgusting, and could we please order a pizza? My husband, who will eat most everything could not choke it down, and said it felt slimy in his mouth.  I thought it was really bad.  It only smelled good.

It was good but I changed it a bit.  I steamed the eggplant until just tender using chicken broth, used Italian seasoning instead of poultry seasoning, garlic flavored cro√ªtons instead of toasted bread & non fat cream instead of heavy cream.  I was a little watery but very tasty all the same

My family does NOT like eggplant, but this was a huge hit (even though it's not visually appealing.)  I followed another reviewer (I think) and roasted the eggplant.  Very tasty!

Very good!  Would definitely either use salted water to boil eggplant in, or salt eggplant after it's cooked.

I thought this recipe was pretty good.  I steamed the eggplant in the microwave for 5 minutes in a covered bowl with some water instead of boiling it.  I think the recipe was dry for the people who substituted bread crumbs for toasted bread.  Mine was not dry and I might even add more toast next time because the crunches were yummy.  Steaming vs boiling the eggplant also prevented it from getting too mushy.  I added about an extra cup and a half or so of mozzarella cheese to the cup of cheddar because I was trying to use up what I had in my fridge and I think I will add extra cheese next time too.  Next time I will just use 2% milk instead of heavy cream.  It is rich enough with the extra cheese.  I didn't have poultry seasoning so I substituted sage instead.  It was pretty mild flavored so I put salt, pepper, and celery seed on top.  This reminded me a bit of a summer version of Thanksgiving stuffing and I really enjoyed this new way of preparing eggplant.  Thanks!

I only recently joined this website, and this is the first recipe I have tried.  I love eggplant but have been looking for something new to do with it.  This recipe was awesome, and I didn't change a thing; my husband loved it too!  Thanks!!

This recipe has the potential to be good, but unfortunately - as written - it needs serious changes.  I boiled it as it stated.  It only needs a few minutes at a rapid boil. I also used bread crumbs, per some of the other members suggestions.  However, upon removing it from the oven after 20 minutes - it was already very dry and hard on top and the eggplant was soft in some spots - hard in others.  In an effort to save the dish (call it a stroke of genius if you will) - I removed the dish from the oven and retrieved my handy potato masher.  After mashing the cheesy eggplant concoction to a "chunky" mashed potato consistency, I stirred in about a 1/2 cup of salsa and then topped with a 1/2 cup of mexican cheese.  I put the eggplant casserole back in the oven for about 10 minutes at 275 to melt the cheese. The end result was awesome!!!!

I thought it was really good.  The reason I gave it 4 stars was because my husband felt it was a bit soggy.  He said I should have used real bread crumbs rather then toasted bread.  I did have a very good taste though.  Will make it again.

Very, very good. I followed many of the recommendations here, and added a bit of my own. Carmelized some onions, added a half-can of shoe-peg corn to that... added this mixture to the toast (two slices ;) and then cheese... Both of my little boys ate it, no problem. Looking forward to leftovers!

This is great!  I doubled the recipe and used mozerella cheese.  Serve with large pita chips and drop a tiny bit of tobasco on before eating - yummy-licious!!!!!!!!!

Also - another time  - I fixed as a side dish too - put under the broiler to make extra crispy on top - served with veggies and fried pork chops!

I would eventually like to put this in the middle of a soup bowl (after getting very crispy under the broiler) and ladle some onion soup around........very versitile recipe!!!

Not impressed. This is the only recipe I've ever given below 3 stars... it was just missing something to really pull the eggplant and cheese together! I used seasoned bread crumbs instead of toast, and added some crushed garlic. The entire dish was literally too dry. I will not be making this again.

Although we are not great eggplant lovers-we found this dish really yummy. Even our 6yr old asked for more. Due to what I had at hand I needed to modify this recipe - using toasted Turkish bread crumbs, fried the eggplant, substituted the seasoning with Moroccan spice and used sour cream and it worked fine. We will certainly have this one again!

This recipe was awful. I used sour cream instead of heavy cream and used bread crumbs instead of toasted bread so maybe that is what made it taste so bad. I took one bite of it and had to throw it all away. Maybe next time I would attempt the recipe instead of trading ingredients out.

Eggplant is good but this was not the greatest texture with the cheese. It is easy to make but the leftovers go bad quickly so food can go to waste. I wouldn't really recommend this to people with kids because the textures just don't look or taste appretizing to them.

This was too bland.  I realize that eggplant is very mild but I think I was expecting something better than what it turned out to be.

I am barely 30-something and had never tried eggplant... until this evening. I am expanding my family's culinary horizon, but for some reason we all looked behind us tonight. We are three, and I have leftovers for three more. Oh, what to do?!? Perhaps, this dish is quite tasty for those who are accustomed to the tecture of this unique vegetable. I will try eggplant again; I will try this recipe again... someday, but not anytime soon. Our palates just aren't ready for this thing called eggplant.

Instead of heavy cream, I used half and half, and substituted wheat flour for white.  We had it for lunch and it was a nice change from sandwiches or soup on a chilly day.

Decent dish although I'm not sure about the size of eggplant that's called for since they vary so much.  I used Japanese eggplants and roasted them unpeeled first to maintain the nutrients.  I don't use heavy cream, so I tried someone else's suggestion of sour cream and left out the flour.  I also don't know what poultry seasoning is, so I used some garlic powder, chili powder, cumin and minced onion.  I also only baked for 20 min since I'd already cooked the eggplant.  I didn't see the point of an additional 10 min.
