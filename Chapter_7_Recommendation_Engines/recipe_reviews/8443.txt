Choose this recipe!!! :) Trust me there is no better recipe out there then this! With a few changes to increase their healthy nature they are amazing! The first time I made these muffins I followed the recipe to a T, although after making it the third time I felt that they were becoming to sweet tasting, and I found they were a bit high in cals.  So to make them into healthy blueberry muffins I substituted 1/4 of the butter with unsweetened applesauce, added wheat flour instead of the white (which is bad for the body), and I cut down on the sugar to 1 cup and less two tbsp. and added 1 tsp. of vanilla and it turned out great!!! Based on my backround in nutirtion I advise these substitutes!! anyway, its overall the best recipe in the world.....I have tried all the others on this site but this is "#1" :)*****(*)

This recipe tasted great, but wasn't quite what I was looking for.  I now understand the "cake-like" reference - they come out dense, moist, and filling, not fluffy like I was looking for.  They taste delicious, however.  I only put a cup of sugar instead of 1 1/4 and it came out just right - I don't like my muffins to be super sweet.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly, except that I reserved 1/4 of the flour to coat the blueberries so as to avoid them popping during cooking.

THIS IS A WONDERFUL RECIPE. I MADE IT JUST THE WAY IT IS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ADDING A TABLESPOON OF VANILLA, GIVE OR TAKE A LITTLE. IT MADE 30 AND IN LESS THAN 24-HRS THERE WERE ONLY 15 LEFT. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS RECIPE TO ANYONE.

This is a classic muffin recipe in its ratios of sugar, fat, egg, and flour.  The generation of cake muffins that most people come to expect didnt come around until the advent of betty crocker muffin mixes.  So yes, it is soft, and very simple in ingredients ie: no lemon, orange rind, spices, etc.  It is a delightful recipe similar to one in my mothers 1919 cookbook.    Two things to note:  muffin papers didn't exist when muffins came about.  They developed a nice brown crust in the iron and steel pans they were cooked in.  Do yourself a favor and make a traditional muffin in the traditional way and enjoy the golden crust that held the muffin together.  The last thing to note:  muffin recipes use baking soda and that means they really bake best with higher heat.  425F is the magic number for muffins.  First it sets the crust quickly which controls the "spread" and forces the muffin up into a pretty crown.  The creation of mushroom shaped muffins is a modern thing.  So crank up the oven to 425 when you make this recipe and they cook for about 12 minutes.  By doing that you can have a muffin that is 2/3 full and have a nice crown.  Love the recipe!

FABULOUS!!!!!!  This is the best muffin ever!!!  The top comes out lightly crunchy without having to make a special topping.  I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers and added 1tsp of vanilla, and I cut the sugar to just 1cup, but I totally could have handled the entire amount....I have a raging sweet tooth, though.  Even though I cut the sugar, that's not to say that these weren't sweet.  They were absolutely decadent!!!  I HIGHLY recommend making this recipe!!!!

These muffins are fantastic.  I added about a teaspoon of vanilla and a little more blueberries. I used frozen blueberries that I allowed to thaw.  I also made a topping of; 1/2 C sugar, 1/3 C flour, 1/4 C butter and 1-1/2 t cinnamon and sprinkled on top before baking.  Delicious!

What a happy thing it turned out to be that I had so much extra topping left over from "Rhubarb and Strawberry Crunch." (I recommend that recipe highly too, by the way) If it wasn't for trying to find a use for that topping I wouldn't have tried these muffins today.  They're not an old-fashioned muffin in the traditional sense mind you, more cake like...but darned good cake.  I added a teaspoon of vanilla (cake should have vanilla, right?) but other than that I stuck to the recipe.  I got eight Texas-sixed muffins, and I had enough of that wonderful brown sugar oatmeal topping for all of them.  When/if I make these again I'll probably make them exactly the same way!

These make a lovely thick batter. One little thing I did differently was to not completely fill up the milk measurement ad top it off with a little vanilla - we like vanilla in almost everything! :D This is my go-to recipe - they're not AMAAAZZZING but they are wonderful and easy to put together.

I made these with sour cherries and used 1 cup flour, should have stuck to 1 1/4 cup. Very moist muffins, make sure to mix your berries with some of the flour before adding to the batter so they won't sink to the bottom.

I don't know what was wrong, but my muffins flattened out at the top and spilled over the pan.  They didnt' make a nice shaped muffin with a mounded top.  I was very disappointed in the appearance, but the flavor was good, but a little sugary or grainy.  I probably won't make these again.

These tasted very good, but didn't cook up real well.  Admittedly, it could be my oven.  It's very tempremental and needs a new heating element.  They were flat and didn't puff up like I was hoping.  I used frozen blue berries as well and tossed them with sugar.  The batter was great.  They got eaten, but no rave reviews.  I was disappointed - but again I think my oven was the real culprit here.  Will try this recipe again and hope for better results.

These were great!  I substituted 1/4 c. brown sugar for some of the white sugar, and also substituted 1/2 c. raspberries for some of the blueberries.  They were absolutely fabulous!

This is a great recipe.  I followed the original recipe and added a teaspoon of vanilla extract and extra blueberries (I used frozen and they worked just fine).  I also topped the muffins with a streusel:  
1/4 c butter, 
1/4 c sugar,
1/4 c brown sugar,
1/3 c flour,
1 tsp cinnamon.

I filled the muffin tins about 80% full and this made 15 muffins which didn't run over.  They were light and fluffy (make sure your baking powder is not expired or old). Excellent!

These were quick and delicious.  They were not what I'd call light and fluffy fall-apart kind of muffins.  They were not dense like pound cake but like a normal cake.  They held together for the most part when you bit into them which I appreciate as a mom of three!  I used frozen blueberries and put them in so they didn't bleed blueberry juice all over and turn my muffins purple.  This was a nice thing!!  I absolutely will be making these again.  One other thing, I doubled recipe so I could have more than one dozen muffins.  I filled my four muffin pans to the top and a bit over the top in some cases and it came out to exactly 24 muffins.  So... figure this into your calculations.  You can stretch it out to more servings if you're conservative in your muffin size.  Me?  I like bigger muffins and they actually didn't get puff up huge... so I wouldn't make mine smaller than I did.

The first time I made this recipe I used a square pan instead of cupcakes.  The resulting cake was wonderful - added a lemon glaze to the top.  Now I use this batter for all my "cakes"  just adding whatever berries I have on hand.  I've used this for petite fours glazing the plain cakes and decorating with fresh violets, candied fruits, etc.  What a wonderful recipe.  Thanks to Aunt Blanche.

The batter for these whips up real quick.  And even though my kids didn't like them (I knew it was a long shot -- they don't like anything even slightly healthy. Or gooey.)  I thought they were delicious.

This is the perfect muffin recipe - super easy and versatile.  I followed the lower fat version and doubled it to make 12 jumbo muffins. An instant hit with our family.  Will make again and again ~ thank you!

Absolutly delicious! They are best fresh. They have a little crunch of the top. Yum! The top wasn't crunchy after the first day, but they were still delicious.

Excellent!  These were super easy the make and better then what you buy at a bakery.  Use fresh blueberries and the flavor really pops out.  I normally have a problem with my blueberries falling to the bottom of the pan.  Not here.  A word of caution...they stick to the pan, use muffin liners.

These are yummy! I add sugar in the raw to the top of them for a little sparkle and crunch. Also- I've made them with fresh and frozen blueberries and both versions worked out well.

These were good, but not great.  These are perfect if you want a no thrills and very simple blueberry muffin recipe.  I will make these again because they are easy.

You know, with all the muffins I've made from the pre-made packages, and the flops I've created myself, I couldn't believe how easy this was to make. My daughter (3) helped me the entire time and they turned out fabulous!(Even with the apple substitution.) My kids devoured their entire muffin, something they have never done before.  This is definitely the recipe i will be using from now on. Thanks Aunt Blanche! ;O)

Delicious! Thanks for a great recipe Bevy. Followed recipe and added 1 teaspoon of vanilla and sprinkled tops lightly with natural cane turbinado sugar before baking. Took about 42 minutes at 350 to bake 6 jumbo muffins in paper liners. (had enough batter left for about 2 more. Need to get another Texas pan for the next time I make these which will be soon) Came out Golden on top, sides and bottom and loved the light texture inside. Had really large fresh gourmet blueberries that stayed suspended throughout the muffins.

My goodness these are wonderful. I've been looking for a recipe similar to my favorite store bought mix.  This is it.  They are moist and cake like, but with a nice crunchy top. Perfect sweet.  The only thing I added was a little vanilla.

these are exactly what i was looking for. fluffy, crumbly, and sweet. i doubled the recipe, so what happened to me might not be typical - the batter came out sort of like cookie dough instead of muffin batter, but i added 1 and 1/2 cups of milk and it was fine. they baked up perfectly and ill make these again and again

I don't know who Aunt Blanche is but she knows a good muffin.  Never liked muffins with oil so this recpe suits us very well.   It is a little heavy on sugar for our taste but cutting back by 1/4 of a cup works fine.  Also, someone suggested cake flour and that would make them more like a cupcake  - a good idea.    Some lemon rind ups the flavor which is always good with blueberries. Please do not make too many changes to this recipe because it does not need them.....

These  muffins were good, however I thought that they were missing something. Next time I will add some real vanilla. I do not think that they were overly sweet. The top is crunchy and they are very cake like. They are really good.

These muffins came out beautifully. I actually did as a reviewer suggested, using whole wheat flour, cut down on the sugar and used 1/4 unsweetened apple sauce and 1/4 butter. They turned out great and my family enjoyed them as well. Thank you.

I have been searching for years for a nice, sweet blueberry muffin recipe, and now I found it! I used frozen blueberries as that is what I had on hand, and also added 1 teaspoon of vanilla to batter. Otherwise, followed exactly. Next time I want blueberry muffins, I will look no further than this recipe. Definitely a keeper, and I am so glad I found it! Thanks, Bevy!

These are fabulous and gorgeous!  I didn't make any changes and they came out moist and cake-like, just how I like my muffins!  I topped them off with some raw sugar before baking to add a little sparkle and crunch.

YUM!  This was my 3rd Blueberry Muffin recipe this week and was by far the best.  So delicious.  I used frozen blueberries (thawed) and they turned out fine.  I added vanilla and just a tiny bit of Cinnamon Sugar on the top of each muffin before cooking.  Will definitely make over and over again.  Even the dough was divine (I know you aren't supposed to eat it because of the raw eggs but I couldn't resist!).

This made 6 very large muffins.  I baked them in deli paper for 38 minutes.  I do not suggest replacing 1/2 the white flour with whole wheat flour...the taste isn't right.

These muffins were excellent! They really put boxed muffin mixes to shame. I added a bit of cinnamon sugar to the batter (maybe 1 tsp- 1 1/2 tsp) and topped them with sugar before baking. These were a big hit! My family gobbled these up in an afternoon. I wish I had doubled the batch- now I have to make them again!

Nice recipe because dough had enough butter in it that blueberries didn't sink to bottom like some recipes.  Doubled and made 2 doz (regular size paper cupcake liners).  Easy, tasty, not too dry - added vanilla, replaced sugar with 1/2 Splenda, used 1 less egg, fresh fat blueberries.

very moist. I cut down on the sugar to 1 cup, didn't add any salt because I used salted butter. Also I sprinkled brown sugar on top before I baked. Wonderful Saturday morning treat! Thank you for the recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly but the mixture came out runny. I tried to add more all purpose flour to make the mixture less runny but this did not help. The blueberries sank to the bottom and melted and the muffins were flat and sour. Might try again without salt or the milk.

these didn't turn out so good for me.  they tasted much too milky and they fell apart very easily.  i think the milk also made the mix much too liquid and they flowed around the top of the tin rather than rising like a normal muffin. i'll try another recipe next time.

Wonderful muffin recipe! I did make a few changes including, using 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup Splenda (instead of the 1 1/4 cups sugar), using half canola oil and half butter, and decreasing the amount of blueberries to 1 cup. I also used frozen blueberries and mixed them with a tablespoon of sugar in a separate bowl (last time I tried making blueberry muffins I found the blueberries to be a little too sour) and then I added them to the batter without any thawing. The muffins had just the right amount of sweetness, a firm outside, and a light, cake-like inside.

This recipe is similar to the Best of the Best Blueberry Muffins also on this site although the directions are a little different. About the only change I made was to substitute buttermilk for the milk. (I actually used the powdered buttermilk) The 1 1/2 cups of berries equaled 2 pints.  These were very good--not too sweet and have a great cake-like texture. I don't know if I have smaller muffin pans but I doubled the recipe and got 36 muffins. I did sprinkle a little sugar on the tops before baking. I'll definitely make them again.

YUMMMM! These are so easy to make.  My 5 year old daughter did everything (except the mixer)!  They are so tasty, I will definately make these again.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I used buttermilk instead of regular milk. Tasty!

I made these muffins with my 3 year old.  They are easy, and quick. He helped do the dumping and mixing, and sprinkled the crumbles on top with a little help :).
I didn't use fresh blueberries though (not in season).  I actually tried canned blueberries for the first time, and drained the juice first.  It worked GREAT. These are truly yummy muffins, and I am kinda a snob when it comes to muffins.  I love the crumble topping and moist consistency.   They tend to be a bit crumbly the next day...but still yummy!  These were a hit with my son and husband and even my 10 month old!! I will never use a boxed mix AGAIN!

Excellent!  As others have suggested, I added a teaspoon of vanilla extract and cut the white sugar down to 1 cup.  My flour is always a mix of white and wheat.  I used large fresh blueberries and probably put in almost 2 1/2 cups!  The batter was thick enough to suspend the many blueberries perfectly, no falling to the bottom.  The recipe doesn't say what kind of milk, I used 1 percent.  My oven runs very hot, and I found 21 minutes at 350 was perfect, for me.  No liners for me, just a metal pan sprayed with Pam.  They came out easily, with a lightly crunchy top.  A dense, cake-like muffin which my family prefers over light and airy.  A recipe I will use again!

I had some HUGE blueberries, so I thought might were a touch soggy,BUT my kids absolutely destroyed (by eating!) the entire batch, so we will be making these again! Seeing that my kids ate the whole batch, I didn't get a pic this time!

After reading the raving reviews, I just had to try this recipe. YOU'VE GOT TO TRY THIS RECIPE TOO!!! It's AMAZING! It's more like eating a cupcake. These don't puff up very much in the oven, so fill your muffin cups to the top. So easy and so good.

My timer just went off for the last batch I had to bake and I already ate 3 from the first batch and so has my fiance. AMAZING!!! I must say that I did change it up a bit. I used 1 cup of wheat and 1 cup of white only because we wanted them a bit more healthy but didn't want the dryness of wheat flour. We also coated the blueberries in flour before we added them to help hold in some of the juice. We also egg washed the tops with egg whites and sprinkled them with brown sugar. Also added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and cinnomin and 1 tsp of vanilla to give it more flavor since we used cheep blueberries. Also used only 1 cup of sugar which was just enough. PERFECT!!!!

Allinfun's review is right on the mark. I baked mine at 400 for 20 minutes in a steel pan without paper liners and they were excellent. I also used buttermilk powder in place of the milk and only 1C of sugar. This is a wonderful basic recipe everyone will enjoy.

These were flavorless...essentially blueberry filled blandness.  I'm not sure why they have such good reviews. Typically, the ingredients are listed in order of use also...it could mix someone up if they didn't read twice.

Just my experience (obviously a lot of folks got these to come out perfectly): The batter was SO stiff before adding the blueberries that I had to believe I'd used too much flour -- so I splashed in maybe another 1/4 milk to loosen it up a little. Probably as a result of that, they took forever to cook (over an hour), and came out very very brown on top and just barely done in the middle. So I'd suggest not worrying if the batter looks REALLY stiff before you add the blueberries. I had enough batter to fill 17 jumbo-size muffin cups, and a couple overflowed a little -- I'm baking the last 5 muffins now, and am not sure it's worth another hour of oven time. These are, I think, way too sweet -- UNTIL you get a mouthful with a blueberry, and then you need that sugar 'cuz my blueberries were sadly VERY tart. All in all -- too much work and mess for an unsatisfactory batch of muffins.

Thank you for sharing this recipe - it's wonderful!  I've made these muffins a few times now.  I just finished baking a double batch for visiting family who will be heading home on a plane today and one of the teens (who doesn't normally like blueberries) had 3 muffins in one sitting and then said he wanted to take a bunch home with him.  Absolutely delicious and incredibly easy to make with basic ingredients.  Thanks again!

I followed the recipe and turned out to be fantastic! I uesd frozen blueberry as fresh ones were too expensive. I coated frozen bluberry with sugar first so they won't sink to the bottom. It was a big hit!!

This recipe is my new fave. I doubled the recipe and used whole wheat pastry flour instead of all purpose(King Arthur Flour makes a good variety called white whole wheat that can be found in most supermarkets). I also used brown sugar instead of white, and plan to use sucanat (less processed organic sugar)the next time I make them. Before they went into the oven, I sprinkled wheat germ and a few oats on top of each muffin. They baked up beautifully! The double batch made 24 muffins; enough for my family of 5-and enough to take to my husband and his crew at work. The men all raved enough that I'm taking another batch today!

Just whipped up a batch of these yummy muffins!  Kitchen smells great.  This was simple to put together and the muffins are delicious.  I ended up with 16 muffins, having filled the muffin cups nearly to the top.  EDIT: I hate to say it, but these aren't so hot on day two.  They are great if you expect the batch to be consumed right away, but if not they don't hold up well.  On day two, the texture wasn't muffin-like at all and they seemed less flavorful.

Pretty basic blueberry muffin. I used whole wheat flour and cut the sugar back to 3/4 cup. I think I might have overcompensated by adding more sour milk than I needed because my muffins turned out a little wet. I'll try these again and see what happens the second time. Though wet, they turned out nicely. Before baking, I sprinkled just a touch of white sugar over the top.

Aunt Blanche is a GENIUS.  I made these this morning, and while I can see the argument for adding a bit of vanilla, I went ahead and just followed the recipe...and they are DELICIOUS.  And so incredibly easy!  I've saved this recipe now, and will be using it as my go-to recipe for All Things Muffin.  Thank you, Aunt Blanche, for making breakfast taste so good!

I made these according to the recipe, but cut the sugar down to 1 cup, and added 1t of vanilla. They were amazing! The batter ended up thicker than most muffin batter, but they cooked up great! I think next time I will cut the sugar down a bit more (they were still very sweet), and try substituting apple sauce for half the butter, like someone else suggested. And possibly use some whole wheat flour for part of the flour. It was a GREAT recipe though - would just like to make it a bit healthier, and less sweet.

Wonderful, I did add 1 tsp of vanilla, but I like vanilla! I made them for the first time, and it was also for house guests and everyone raved about them, they were perfect. Extremely easy!

This & the Jordan Marsh recipe are very similar.  I blended the recipes.  I made with half cup margarine, 1 cup sugar, 2 cups berries, 1t vanilla.  Pretty good, but not "it," again.

Fabulous muffins. It made 7 large ones. I gave a couple to my neighbors and she asked for the recipe right after. Really turned out just like a cake batter.  I made some more today using 2 nectarine (or I guess peaches would do the same) and again, they came out yummy. This recipe is a keeper for sure. Thank you aunt Blanche.

Although these muffins were very good, they were definately cakelike.  I just prefer my muffins to be like muffins.  Since these were more cakelike than muffinlike, I probably won't make them again.

Good Blueberry Muffins if you like moist cake like taste. I added a little more milk, baking powder, added vanilla and more blueberries. Also made it with fresh peaches with the blueberries. Very good. Will make again and may try other fruits.

A good, basic, respectable blueberry muffin.  I added a little vanilla and extra blueberries - more of a habit than anything else.  I sprinkled a little sugar on the top 5 minutes before it finished baking just for appearances.

This recipe never fails.  Lovely fluffy muffins.  I sometimes use frozen berries (whatever I have on hand) and it works just as well- maybe an extra couple of minutes baking time.

These came out very dry and biscuit like.  My fiance thought they were alright, split open w/ a huge pat of butter, but you shouldn't HAVE to do that with a muffin.  I followed-the recipe to a T, but substituted egg beaters for the egg.  I've never had a problem using them before, so I don't believe that's the issue.  Next time I'd add some unsweetened apple sauce or something for moisture,  but if you're looking for blueberry biscuits, then this is the recipe for you.

I did not care for this recipe. They stuck to the paper liners and when I took them from the pan they crumbled all over. However, the flavor was good! But I have had better blueberry muffins!

Good recipe!  The only thing is that I had more batter than for 12 muffins and don't try to add more than 2/3 full because they will run over!  I'll just have more muffins to enjoy next time.

They are kinda bland. They are OK but I wont make them again they are missing something. I fallowed the recipe to a T except for adding some vanilla and I find myself thinking what would these taste like without that because I think that is the only thing that is giving it flavor. The actual batter should have some flavor to it not just the blueberries. Maybe they should be mashed. I might try it again just to see if mashing them makes a difference.

This is a great recipe!  I used defrosted frozen blueberries tossed in a little flour.  I also found the recipe makes more than a dozen.  I made these for my husband's meeting.  One person said these were the best blueberry muffins he has ever had!

These are good, great basic recipe, I left out 1/4 cup of the sugar and they tasted great.  I did add a little extra milk since the batter was pretty thick and I didn't want to smash the blueberries when I added them.  It filled 12 muffin cups to the top and I baked for almost 35 minutes, the tops didn't get very brown but they were fully cooked...  I might add a little oil or applesauce next time to make them moister.

Not sure how or why but the center of my muffins kind of caved in, hubby had a lot of fun at my expense with the presentation at the family BBQ however, I liked the taste, kind of a cross between a corn muffin w/blueberries?  I’ll give them another whirl, maybe I did something wrong.

Excellent Receipe. I switched to one cup of whole wheat and one cup white flour and used organic Sucanat instead of white sugar.  I thought it would be a disaster because it was hard to cream the butter & sugar - however it was great :)

Def a keeper!  I have made these several times already and they have been perfect every time.  The second time I made them with vanilla, frozen blueberries and used oil instead of butter.  They were still awesome.  Thank you for sharing such a wonderful recipe.  I will never buy boxed ones again. :D

Delicious - definitely a sweet treat.  The only change I made was to use buttermilk instead of the milk because I have quite a bit to use up and thought it would work just fine in the muffins.  They were moist and just like the submitter states - cake-like.

These are excellent!  My husband couldn't believe that they were from scratch.  I did alter them a little bit.  I only put 1 cup of sugar in the batter, I only used 1/4 cup butter and added about 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce.  I also sprinkled them with sparkling sugar before putting them in the oven.

Very, Very Good!  I made the recipe just as it was written and mixed everything just as described in the directions.  I baked about 2 minutes longer than it said, and the edge of the top of the muffin had just a little crunch to it which was perfect!  This was a great recipe for a person who is not usually a baker!!!

Made these with strawberries instead of blueberries - WOW!! The flavor just POPS! Even though I made a mistake in the recipe - put the sugar in with the flour instead of the butter. Had to enlarge the recipe to make it work... But it was very forgiving and tastes great! Love them. :) Definitely worth a try.

These are really good. They are sweet but not too sweet and the consistency is nice. And they are very easy. I took this recipe to an elementary school in Sweden and made it with two 4th grade classes. They had no trouble :)

The flavor wasn't bad at all, but I had trouble with these. I cooked them quite a bit longer than the recipe and they still looked raw on bottom although they were nicely browned on top. I didn't use muffin liners, but generously greased and floured muffin tins. Still they didn't come out of the pan easily and almost all broke apart although I cooled them. I wanted to like them, but was disappointed, although flavor still good. I will try another blueberry muffin recipe.

These muffins are delicious! There are more cake-like and do not make the traditional dome top that muffins traditionally have.  I added a little vanilla just because I always add vanilla to every sweet batter.

I was really looking for blueberry cupcakes, and these are close.  They definitely need vanilla.  Mine were flat on top, and I only got 17 normal sized muffins.  But I will try it again with a few changes.

These are good.  I noticed this recipe has the exact same ingredients as many other blueberry muffin recipes on this website.  This must be the "standard way".  My muffins were very flat, not the beautiful domed ones I had hoped for.  Maybe I should check the date of my baking powder BEFORE I bake.  October '08!  No wonder the muffins didn't rise that great.  So, I'll try again..........

I think these were great but loaded with Bluberries. I will reduce the amount by 1/2 next time.

Excellent muffins!  I made a few changes as suggested by some. I substituted 1/4 of the butter with applesauce, used 1 cup sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar and also added 1 tsp vanilla.  Great texture.

I had to figue out what to do with extra blueberries and stubbled into this recipe. It was sooooooo easy to make and everyone loved the muffins. Would recommend this to anyone.

Yummy!! I needed a recipe in a hurry and this took only minutes to put together.  I did reduce the sugar to just 1 cup and will try adding vanilla next time.  I think it is a great "basic" recipe for using different fruits, and I liked the crunchy top.  A "keeper".

Very yummy recipe! After picking gallons of berries I needed a good recipe. I love that they are slightly crunch on the outside and light and fluffy inside. I agree with other posters, they did not rise up much while baking, so not the prettiest looking muffins, but they taste great!

I Loved this recipe!  They turned out as good as everyone raved on here.  I did end up adding 1 tsp of vanilla into the recipe and think that it was a good addition.  I would probably double the recipe next time to make the muffin's a little bigger but the taste was awesome fresh out of the oven and again after they cooled.  The true test of a homemade muffin is if it tastes good AFTER they cool off and this one definitely passes the mark!

Based on taste, I'd give these muffins a "5" rating.  However, as others also shared, I had challenges with them puffing up...they ended up pretty flat.  Except for adding 1 tsp. of vanilla, I followed the recipe as written.

These are great muffins. I didn't have butter, so I used butter flavored Crisco and added my blueberries still frozen. These muffins are as good as any bakery's and better than store bought! Thanks's for the recipe! My husband said I outdid myself! LOL!

Had some lefotver blueberries, and was looking for something to use them in!  I listened to some of the other reviewers and substituted 1/4cup of brown sugar for some of the white, and added a little bit of vanilla.  Threw in a little bit of cinnamon for extra measure and baked in a loaf pan(didn't have muffin cups).  Turned out absolutely fantastic.  Was great sliced for breakfast!  Thanks much

Great recipe.  I did like some of the others, and cut the sugar by 1/4 c.  I also tried to make it a little healthier by substituting 1/4 of the butter with applesauce and used 1/2 whole wheat flour and white flour.  There is enough flavor that those who dont like whole wheat cant even tell.  
I will definitely make this again.

Wonderful easy recipe, don't change a thing, I sprayed my muffin liners with Pam. Just make sure that you mix your room temp butter and sugar well. The batter is like consistency of toll house cookie dough. So I was spooning it into muffin liner. Turned out great, no sticking at all. Will make again!!

Moist and delicious muffins. I added 1 tsp. of vanilla to the batter and sprinkled the top of the muffins with sugar and cinnamon(not too much) before baking.

Light, fluffy, and moist--the perfect cakelike muffin.  I don't think it's too sweet at all; sometimes we need sugar to get going in the morning.  Followed the recipe to a T, adding a splash of vanilla along the way.  Force of habit.  ;-)

Easy recipe with everything you already have in the cupboard. They are very tasty and moist but quite crumbly.  I'll make these anytime for breakfast, just maybe not for a party.

I screwed up twice on this recipe, I forgot the milk, and I used dried blueberries instead of fresh.  Don't use dried, they stay little hard balls that don't release any flavor.

Still, even screwing up repeatedly, they were delicious.  I'd love to know what they'd be like if I made them properly, and I'm going out to  buy blueberries to make some more as soon as my current ones are gone.  

Also, sprinkle cinnamon-sugar on top of the unbaked muffins, it's delicious.

A terrific blueberry muffin recipe!  I made the recipe as directed, with one exception: instead of adding all the flour at once, I added the first cup, and stirred the blueberries into the second cup.  The flour coated the blueberries and that way, when I stirred them into the batter, they didn't smear.

The double-portion batch was wolfed down in two days by my family - it's definitly one that I will make again. :)

The texture on these muffins resembled those on cornbread!  These were just average, nothing to write home about.  Note: blueberries are in season right now, so I suggest you stock up (while they're cheap) and just freeze them, that way, you can have fresh blueberry muffins year around.

Many years ago I worked in downtown Minneapolis, and at the time, Penney's department store had a breakfast/lunch counter in the store.  On our morning break, one of us would run over to Penney's and buy their blueberry muffins!  Over time, the store moved as improvemnts were made in the downtown area, so we all had muffin withdrawals.  The muffins were so tasty, and cake-like.  For many years I've searched for a recipe that resembled the famous "Penney's muffin", but to no avail---until THIS recipe!  BINGO!  I made them this morning for the first time, and boy, did it ever bring back memories!  This will be a keeper in my recipe box.  Thanks Bev!

This is a great recipe - VERY easy and a GREAT taste!  I added a sprinkle of sugar on the tops for a final touch.

For years I have been on the look out for (what I believe to be)the ultimate blueberry muffin recipe...sweet rich flavor,and a high rise peak. This was close.  The flavor was great!!  However, its rising was flat.  I will continue my search or tweak this recipe a bit.

I didn't experience any of the problems mentioned in some of the other reviews.  The muffins were crispy and golden on the outside and fluffy on the inside, and the flavor was fantastic! I ate far too many in one sitting! Definitely a keeper for my family.

I thought these were going to look like bakery-style muffins and taste really good. But I was wrong. Mine didn't even rise, and they look awful. The taste is bland and has no sweetness to it. It is in no way cake-like! I do not recommend this recipe.

Loved this recipe, mind you this should be called 'Aunt Blanche's Blueberry Cupcakes' as that by creaming the butter it gives it a cake like texter, as opposed to a true muffin texture that you would get of the fat added was in a liquid form (ie oil).  For a true muffin try 'To Die For Blueberry Muffin', but this is a good recipe(I actually prefer these cupcakes over the muffins).

These muffins have sweet, crispy tops and moist, tender centers.  I like to change the recipe slightly by adding a dash of vanilla and lemon extract.

These taste really good!  Adjustments do need to be made for high altitude, because they ended up falling.  I will definitely make them again w/a few adjustments.

My kids absolutely inhaled these - they loved them! Very sweet, almost like a blueberry cupcake rather than muffin. No need for a topping. I also made this with chocolate chips and they were great that way as well.  Very nice recipe to have on hand for a quick breakfast/tea.

I love this recipe!  I made it with a crumb topping, but the muffins were so good they didn't need it.  Next time I will make them plain.  These are dangerous-- I ate four in one sitting.  Enjoy!  Thanks, Bev!

These are delicious.  I used frozen blueberries which can mush up and turn the dough blue if they have been thawed.  My husband rolled them in sugar and poked them one by one into the dough in the muffin tins. They looked and tasted excellent.

I have never made blueberry muffins from scratch and was looking for an easy recipe when I came across this one.  I did make a couple slight changes because I can't have too much sugar. I substituted splenda for the sugar and added 1 tsp of vanilla as suggested by others. They turned out amazing!!!! Thank you so much for the recipe!!!! It's definitely a keeper!!!!

I made no changes to this recipe. These were the most amazingly delicious muffins I've ever tasted. It's impossible to believe that the same general ingredients can have such varied results. I made them in my mini muffin tins, but everyone was devouring four or five a time, so it will be mega muffins next time. I'm also planning to sub out raspberries or blackberries in future iterations.

These muffins were delicious. I doubled the recipe as many reviewers suggested and I made the large muffins. My problem was that every single muffin stuck to the pan and I had to carefully try to remove them one at a time. I did not use muffin papers (never do) but rather sprayed a good coating of PAM in my muffin pans.  All the blueberries sank to the bottom. I will definitely make again as the muffins themselves were very good but will use muffin papers next time.

The flavor is nice, the batter a little thicker than expected, so I  now know this makes 15 regular sized muffins. It also works well with dried cranberries with a tsp of orange peel added to the batter and sprinkled on top.

I make these regularly for my kids’ snacks and they love them.  My only minor change to the original recipe is to add a tsp of vanilla.  Just be warned this makes more than 12 muffins if you fill each 2/3 full.  If you try to use all the batter for 12 they will overflow.  They also often take less than 25 minutes to bake for me so I start checking them at 20 minutes.  For those who don’t like blueberries they are equally as good without them!

the first time i made these, they were great. the only change was i had very small eggs and used 3 instead of 2. i had some blueberries left but not enough to make them again. i had about 1/2 cup. i decided to make the muffins and use 1/2 cup blueberries, 1/2 cup walnuts and 1/2 cup golden raisins. they turned out great also.

The first time I made them I used blueberries and they were good, but missing something. The second time I made them I used fresh blackberries instead and added 1 teaspoon of vanilla.  My family preferred the second batch. I believe adding the vanilla gives the muffin a better flavor.  My husband said they would have been good even without the berries.

I found this recipe quite enjoyable throughout my senior year of high school. While my family prefer the "To Die For" muffins recipe, it has way too much sugar! This recipe was the perfect go to muffin recipe for me. It's nice and simple to follow and quite flexible! I would often use oil instead of butter when I lacked any and the recipe still turned out very yummy! Also replaced blueberries with red huckleberries, salmonberries, thimbleberries, and blackberries too!

Delicious muffins and very easy to make. I reduced the sugar to 1 cup as other reviewers suggested and also added 1 teaspoon of vanilla.  They were done in 30 minutes cooked on convection. I will definitely make these again.

I added cinnamon-sugar topping and used fresh picked blueberries.  They are very good.

I agree this recipe is great! I used what the previous reviewers suggested and it turned out fantastic. I used 1 cup of sugar and added 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1 tbsp of vanilla. Thanks for sharing!

The flavor was good however my muffins were sunken in.  They didn’t bake thoroughly.  I followed the directions exactly.  I have removed this from my favorites and will not many again.

I’ve been making these for years now. She’s not my “Aunt Blanche” but my kids now know her muffins. Always good. All the time. Cut the sugar to 1 cup for 12. Perfect as written but if you’re trying to cut down it’s not noticeable!

I'm not much of a baker, but figured I'd give this a try. I will say, it was extremely easy to make, but I have seen a few reviews  commenting on the amount of sugar in this recipe, but I found the muffins weren't sweet enough for me.I did add a little vanilla, and some cinnamon, so the flavor was ok, but I had hoped for better. I'll stick to buying my muffins.

I cut the sugar to one cup. I also reserved some of the floor mixture and tossed the blueberries in it so they didn't pop while making. I made these for a Coffee Connections catering gig and they were a hit!

Great Base a Recipe... I cut the butter by half & added in 1/4 cup Extra Virgin Coconut Oil. Plus, 1/2 ground Pecans added in with the blueberries as my family love pecans. 1 made smaller portions muffins...and ended up with 24 muffins! I recommend as this recipe is not only delicious but very easy to make

Loved it! I used frozen blueberries and it still worked! Next time I think I would add about a teaspoon of dried lemon zest, but very yummy as is! I also put a teaspoon of vanilla extract and my whole family loved them! Definitely will make again!

I made these without reading any reviews.  The only thing I did different was increased the ingredients an additional 1/2 this gave me 24 muffins or in my case 6 large ones to take to work and 12 regular ones for the family. I also added vanilla.  I found these to be extremely tasty and airy however I had to increase the milk by near double and I found that the 350 degree oven was too cool for not only the large ones but the regular ones also.  After 30 minutes, I increased the temp to 375 for about another 15 minutes.

These are pretty good, but not really the best I have ever made.  The texture is more muffin like than soft cake like to me, which is good but they are way too sweet with so much sugar.  My muffins flattened out on top and the appearance wasn't so pretty so I was glad I wasn't sharing them.  I did add some vanilla and a little lemon rind which was a good addition.  May try them again another day.

Reduced the ingredients by half to make 6 muffins, but decided I didn't like how thick the batter was and added 1/4 cup extra milk before folding the blueberries in so it would be easier to pour right into the muffin tin without too much scraping out of the mixing bowl. Then to play it safe since that made it into a much more fluid batter, I baked at 200 degrees Celsius instead of 175. These are so buttery and good!!

I made these muffins and added my own touches as I was mixing, which made them more rich and cake-like. I mixed brown and white sugar, using 1/2 cup of brown sugar and only  3/4 cups of white sugar. I used 1/2 cup of heavy whipping cream and 1/2 cup of whole milk. I also added a dash of almond extract, lemon extract and vanilla extract to the batter and topped them with a sprinkle of cinnamon and Malden sea salt. Delicious! Great with a strong cup of French Roast coffee. An amazing way to start a Sunday morning.

This recipe was just what I was looking for! I used frozen blueberries and didn’t defrost them before adding them to the batter and they came out perfectly.

Muffins were very good.  I added another 1/2 cup of blueberries to the mix.   The muffin tops didn't quite swell like the recipe photo, but still turned out tasty.

Exactly what I was looking for, and the best old fashioned blueberry muffins I've ever made. I took the advice of another reviewer and oiled the muffin cups, baking without paper liners for 12 minutes (actually 14 for me) at 425 degrees F. This is the recipe I plan to use from now on!

I made these for my diabetic mother in-law, who loves her sweets. I substituted the sugar with Splenda. Except the topping.  She had no clue, she kept on sneaking herself another one.

made this recipe for my husband and it turned out fluffy and delicious. I did only use one cup of sugar instead of the one in 1/4 cups of sugar. For the homemade glaze I used a cup and a half a fresh blueberries, 1/2c sugar and water and boiled them down together then strain.

Used vegan margarine instead of butter, almond milk in place of regular milk as we have some dairy allergies in my family. Added a tsp of vanilla as some ratings recommended and they were awesome. My new blueberry muffin recipe for sure!

I made these just like recipe called for.  They're delicious but I'm not crazy about the texture. Baked them 30 min when tops were golden & firm to touch but inside was still a little undercooked.  And the tops were flat.

Great recipe! Not as dense and heavy as some muffins. These needed a glaze and sugar on top as the blueberries I used were plump and juicy but a bit tart.  These were more cake like and the way my husband prefers them. This gave me 16 regular sized muffins. They were so good that fresh from the oven my husband ate 3 of them! Definitely a keeper.

I liked the texture and appearance of the muffins, but there is way too much sugar in it. The second time around,  I used a half cup of sugar, and they tasted much better.

III’m not sure what happened as it may be on my end (to be fair) but these did not turn out.  They didn’t rise and the texture was that of a bad cookie. I followed recipe to a T.  I felt the batter looked good. Pretty shocked.  Hate to leave bad reviews but I oroababy won’t try this again

A delicious and nicely textured muffin. I cut back on the sugar by 1/4 cup and it was still plenty sweet. Next time I intend to cut back another 1/4 cup. For no other reason than I try limiting sugar in everything & feel the blueberries are sweet enough to carry the muffin. Thisis by far one of the best muffin recipes I’ve tried!

made 24 mini strawberry muffins = 6 servings. 
used 1/2 cup of sugar and was sweet just right!
i like the cakey texture of the muffins, really light and moist with a crunchy top.

The only change I would make would be to make larger muffins, very good flavor and moisture.

This recipe is a keeper! 

Let cool completely, and enjoy the moist texture! The reason I say that is the muffins were okay when they came out of the over; cooled a bit (15 min.);  and were still warm.  The next morning, when the muffins were at room temp, that's when these things filled my mouth with over-the-top yummyness! 

The only other thing I will do next time, add a bit more baking powder.  My muffins ended up a bit flat.

This recipe is simple to follow and makes great tasting muffins. Today I only used 3/4 of a cup of sugar and 2 tsp of vanilla after a taste of the batter, because we happened to run out of sugar. The vanilla added the sweetness to counter the butter flavor in this instance. So, if you're looking to reduce the amount of sugar, that's one way to do so. I also used duck eggs for this batch because they are good for baking and we had over a dozen on hand. They finished up right at 30 minutes and a delicious.

Nice cakey muffin. Batter gave me more than 12 muffins, so I poured remaining batter into a small baking dish. I chose the recipe because of the few ingredients, but I still substituted some applesauce and oil for some of the butter because I was too lazy to soften more butter. DH and I like them.

They were good. I followed the recipe and I got  18 muffins. I'm thinking my pans are smaller. Therefore they were done in 20 mins.

This was pretty good. I substituted the sugar with Splenda and used 1/4 unsweetened applesauce in place of half the butter. I added 1/2 tsp vanilla.  Had to bake 35 minutes.

So I made these and they were great! I did make a couple of changes though. For the 1/2 cup of milk, I used a quarter of heavy cream and a quarter of nonfat. Also, I used 1 cup of sugar because I wanted to taste the blueberries more thank have it just too sweet. I added some raw sugar to the tops, mostly for looks. UNBELIEVABLE! Would make it the exact same way again!

I followed the recipe and instructions exactly.  My muffins were very good and moist.  They were a little flat, but I think my baking powder may have been old.  Will make again...

Only suggestion: Don't be cheap...use the muffin liners.

I followed some tips from the comment section and these are amazing. They are cakey, as described and the top crust is slightly crunchy when done. These are exactly what I was expecting. 
I used 1/4 cup brown sugar, 3/4 cane sugar. Added a drop of vanilla and nutmeg. When adding the eggs to the sugar mixture I used an electric mixer to blend the eggs. 
These would be show worthy with a strusel on top.

Great recipe--moist and not overly dense.  I substituted vegetable oil for butter, and it worked very nicely.  Will also try this with other berries--should work very well.  Thanks, Bevy and Aunt Blanche!

Really good blueberry muffin! I added 1 tsp of vanilla, but other than that, followed the recipe to a "T". I got 18 muffins out of one batch. These are really light, cake-like and not overly sweet. Will make again, for sure.

2nd Time around we made these with applesauce instead of butter, and frozen blueberries. Super yummy. Kids gobbled them up.

Baked these for family and they wanted more! Read all the comments and did the following: Used only 1 C sugar. Added vanilla. Coated the blueberries w/flour before adding them to the mix. Didn't use muffin papers in a non-stick Texas size tin which was first  coated with butter and a little flour, then baked at 425 degrees for 15 mins. Made 10 great muffins that melt in the mouth.  Gave the recipe to three others who have all since baked these delights and loved them.

Made this exactly as it says, whole family loved them including 3 picky teenagers.  Got a little stuck in the muffin pan even though I used flour and baking spray.  Will just use papers next time.

I used wheat flour. You have to add more milk if you do.

Delicious gluten-free option: substituted Cup4Cup gluten free flour for all purpose flour. Topped with bakery-style white sugar crystals and baked for 30-35 min in a 9x13 cake pan pre-sprayed with Pam. My family couldn't get enough of this delicious treat! Great for dessert, breakfast or any time.

I've made these several times!  I've made them with cake flour and all purpose flour.  I prefer using all purpose flour for these muffins.   For a sweeter muffin use the organic wild blueberries---DELISH!!!!!   I'v been using this recipe for four years and have yet to find anything better than these!!!!

These muffins are really tasty. Not too sweet, they're just right. I do wish that I had used some whole wheat flour in place of the a/p. I'll have to remember that for next time.

I had to use 1 cup of brown sugar because I ran out of white sugar. But the muffins were still delicious. I used 1 tsp of salt instead of 1/2 because I always used unsalted butter. These came out delicious, even though the kids "helped" ??

Very good recipe!  I used dried blueberries, which I hydrated in boiling water first.  I also took other reviewers recommendations and reduced sugar to 1 c. and added 1 tsp of vanilla.  I beat my batter very well and let it rest for about 20m prior to baking.  I also greased and floured the muffin tin and they came out nicely golden.  Family loved them!

This  recipe is very good!  It reminded me of my childhood, coming home from school to my Mom's baking.  This recipe made 18 muffins.  The only thing I added was 1/2 tsp vanilla.

Awesome recipe!!!  These are beautiful! For the  milk I made homemade buttermilk.  (Just add a dash of lemon juice to the milk and let it sit.)  I also added about a quarter cup of sour cream and topped them off with sprinkled sugar.

I usually make the 'best of the best...' recipe on this site but decided to use this one because I didn't have enough blueberries or buttermilk for that recipe. This is a good recipe but I still prefer the best of the best because of the sugar topping. I only used 1 cup of sugar as recommended but found that it could have used more sugar so would stick to the recipe. I did add the tsp of vanilla though. It's not a bad muffin. I just prefer the other recipe so won't be making this again.

Excellent recipe. I'll use this one from now on. I like to use the jumbo muffin tins - and got 6 beautiful muffins out of it. I love the crust on the outside, with the soft, moist middle. I used frozen blueberries (thats what I had). I tossed them with the flour and gently mixed it until no flour remained. Mmmmm! They freeze good too.

I was so confused with the milk and where to add the 1/3 cup or was it part of what I added to the oil and egg, the batter was so thick I just figured to add a 1/3 cup. They are baking guess we will see.

Look no further this is the best Blueberry muffins recipe you'll find! These were a huge hit, more were instantly requested! I added vanilla as others suggested and used a cup of light brown sugar since I was out of white. Soooo delicious!

These were not very good. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I had to use thawed frozen blueberries because I couldn't find fresh ones since they're out of season right now. They turned out quite dry and didn't have much flavor, although I could taste the baking powder. I've used other recipes for blueberry muffins before that turned out much better than these. Even my 2-year old didn't like them. :(

i liked these muffins. I used 1 cup whole wheat pastry flour and 1 cup all purpose, I used egg substitute for the eggs and half cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup splenda to cut the carbs a little bit.  I used a stick of regular butter but next time I plan on using 1/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup butter.  they were dense and moist and had the right amount of sweetness for me.

Satisfactory. Just made them and the muffin was salty and floury. Only a little bit sweet and I had to add more sugar. Muffins were going over the sides of the container. Could easily be perfected.

These muffins were really good, I just wouldn't call them "cake-like". They were more dense, almost like a biscuit. I was looking for something a little more cakey in it's texture. I followed the recipe, the only difference I did was 1tsp vanilla, 1tsp lemon juice, and 1 tsp cinnamon. Lemon and cinnamon enhance the blueberry flavor. Adding those small additions would not make it do dense. I think next time I will use cake flour. Overall, they are really good, just not cake-like in texture.

Pretty yummy coming out of the oven.  However, I agree with another reviewer that it was not great the next day - lost its crunchiness and was a bit soggy.  Not sure how to fix this so I probably will not make this again.

Great tasting, easy to make muffins!  I took other bakers' advice and added 1 teaspoon of vanilla.  Great!  I will be making these again.

Love this recipe!  The only thing I changed was to reduce the sugar to 1 cup and I used an Egg Replacer.  They were delicious!

Really, really good. Don't overfill the muffin tins. These raise up nicely if you do 2/3 full--otherwise they will be all over the place (but will still taste really good). Made 13 for me.

Crossed my fingers making these last minute without a test drive.  They came out perfect!  The only change I made to the recipe was to add 1 tsp Vanilla as mentioned by others.  I made mini muffins and reduced the cooking time to about 17 minutes.  I'll be making these again.
*UPDATE - I tried these without the vanilla one time and they were not as good.  Also, last night I decided to make these and was out of milk.  I had a box of chocolate milk and substituted it - my kids said they were the best muffins EVER!

Delicious! I went all out, and added even more fat and calories by using coconut milk for the milk (actually, had no milk in the house but coconut).  These are very cake-like and moist.  Used only 1 cup sugar.

I enjoyed the recipes. I do think that it could have used less butter. I think that using fresh blueberries is essential to this recipe.

The perfect muffin!  I substituted half the butter with plain nonfat yogurt, and it turned out great!
The second time I made these, I changed the blueberries to mixed berries.  I also added chocolate chunks, unsweetened cocoa powder, vanilla, and cinnamon.  These turned out better than I could have imagined!  Soooooo good!

Daughter and young grandsons loved these muffins! Not too complicated. Made them with frozen blueberries and came out just fine. I would have liked a bit more of a puffed up, rounded top. They were light and airy.

This was a wonderful recipe. The only thing I changed was an idea here to use cake flour instead of all purpose, and they turned out perfect.  I actually have never successfully made muffins before this, (at least in my book ) and was extremely happy with the  results.   Thank you Bevy for sharing with us, and will be making these again.

These tasted good but the texture of mine were soggy.  Maybe due to the fact I used frozen blueberries.  I cooked them until they tested clean and the bottoms turned out a little soggy.  Anyway, the taste was good.

Make this recipe. You will not be disappointed. The consistency of the muffin is so delicious - fluffy, the top gets perfectly crunchy. THe batter is delicious and I think that you could do a lot of fun things with it such as subsituting chocolate chips for the blueberries or flaked coconut and dried cranberries. I doubled the recipe and we are gobbling them up. Delicious! My mom (who is great baker) said that I took it to a whole new level with these muffins and that we'd better write the recipe down so that we make sure not to lose it:)

Great recipe! I have tried a few different ones out there and this recipe is great! I've made them twice now and did add a tsp of vanilla. I'll be using this recipe as my base for all kinds of different muffins. Thanks for posting this!

Came out of the pan easy.  Did not over mix, but still came out a bit tough for my taste.  My boyfriend (my official taste tester) loved them though.  I added a slightly sweet cinnamon crumb topping and some extra blueberries for a little more "umph!".

Great muffins!! I have used this same recipe and adapted it for orange cranberry muffins and chocolate chip muffins. The only change I made to the blueberry muffin recipe was to add a tsp or 2 of vanilla. These muffins are VERY good!

These were great!  I added the sugar on top...not sure I even needed that.  I thought they were cake like, but certainly not too dense.  Will make again.

Pretty tasty, no complaints.  Quick and easy. I liked someone else suggestion of substituting some of the white sugar with brown sugar.

These muffins are sooo good.  I've made them twice so far.  I added 1ts of vanilla but followed the recipe the rest of the way.  The muffins do have a cakey texture to them.  The first bunch I made with only fresh blueberries.  The next time, I did not have enough blueberries.  So I shredded two apples, used the small handfull of blueberries I had left and threw in some walnuts..I like a little crunch in my muffins!  It was delicious.  I think this recipe can accomodate for any fruit you'd like.  The sugar topping makes the muffins have a crisp top...however, once you store them in a sealed container, the top will get mushy.  Nonetheless, I highly recommend making these muffins..

tasty.  very cake-like, which I loved.  I added some streusel topping, which was good.  My kids didn't really care for them which is why I rate with a 4.

My kids loved them and it was a wonderful/easy recipe.  They were a little dry, but I don't know if it was because I made mini muffins or what.  I did put vanilla in them like I read from others.  All round it was a good recipe for an easy breakfast.

I followed the recipe exactly and it just didn't work for me.  It didn't have the depth of taste I look for in a blueberry muffin and I thought it had a strange undertaste.  It also stuck to my silicone bakeware to the point that none of the muffins came away in one piece.  Maybe I did something wrong? but I think I'll look for a new recipe next time.  Thanks anyway.

These muffins came out delicious. The only changes I made was swapping one cup of the white flour for whole wheat pastry flour and used raw turbinado sugar instead of white, and they still came out very light and delicious.

I substituted about 10 oz of thawed frozen blueberries. The muffins were great, but I think there were just too many blueberries! (Is that possible?) Otherwise, this was a great recipe, and like other reviewers, I translated it to make other types of muffins, and it worked really well each time. I will make this again - but with fewer and possibly drier berries.

Wonderful!!  Easy recipe, very moist and flavorful.  I added an extra cup of blueberries since I had so many fresh picked ones.  I also added about a 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla.  I'm going to go make another batch to send off with my husband to work.  Thanks for the great recipe..will make again!

These were awesome. I sent them to my daughters pre-scool as a snack and was told the little one loved them! I only used one cup of blueberries, but they were really big berries! My 7 year old wants me to bake them again soon. They did puff up much higher than I thought which was an added bonus since they looked so nice.

These are pretty amazing. I used fresh blueberries and 1 whole cup more than the recipe calls for. I added about 1/4 cup extra sugar too and I also took them out a few minutes early and they were soft and yummy! They are addicting. You won't be able to eat just one!

My kitchen skills need fine tuning and I managed to mess up the recipe, however the muffins still came out tasting great.  I was surprised!  My Husband at first was leary, but tried them and he was impressed.  Easy to make and tastes wonderful!

Having tried about 5 different recipes, I can honestly say that these are head and shoulders above the rest.   They're sweet, moist, and best of all, made with butter and fresh blueberries.  Look no further. :)

These muffins are excellent! I used a jumbo muffin tin and made 6 giant muffins - came out very moist but light.
Frozen berries worked well also. I will definitely make these again. Thanks!

I thought these were great.  They were simple and yummy.  I used 1/2 flour and 1/2 wheat flour to add a little bit more nutrition and they came out great.  My son and husband loved them also.

although this recipe was delicious while hot, the tops of the muffins didn't turn out golden brown. and they became gummy and kinda sticky.  i might have taken them out too soon, but the inside was delicious and moist.  i modified it by using cherries instead of blueberries. i'd still make them again, but maybe i'd cook them a little longer.

These were good muffins, but not excellent.  The texture is very good - very cakey - and they rise up very tall.  The taste however was not as moist and delicious as other recipes I have tried - something was missing.  The taste was similar to many bakery/coffee shop purchased muffins that look so tempting and beautiful, but when you bite into they are just good, not wonderful.  However, if you love the taste of coffee shop muffins, then this might be the recipe you've been hunting for.

Bev is right. I also had 4 at one sitting. My husband had taken too many blackberries out of the freezer so I substituted blackberries for the blueberries. I think it will be a great basic recipe for a lot of different fruits. They were wonderful. I think next time I might add nuts.

I love blueberries had some frozen ones in the freezer didn't know what to do with them.  I had a craven for some blueberry muffins but the stores were closed.  So I came on this site and found this recipe.  I found a use for the blueberries and now I don't have to get the store bought blueberry mix I just make my own.  Its pretty quick and its really easy.  So let me go and get to baking.

These muffins are a hit!  I sprinkle a little unrefined sugar on top and make them a bit more exciting...I used fresh blueberries and the muffins turned out so well.  A great choice indeed.

They were great.note "were" 8-).You can make mini-muffins outta these really easy. Great for on the run, and not messy to eat. Forget the kids, parents will love them.

These were probably the best blueberry muffins I have ever had.  Sweet and moist.  They go down really easy!  Thanks!
