I thought the flavor of the cookie was pretty good. But like another reviewer said - It only initially tastes of mary jane candy. The flavor after that is nothing great although not bad. The inside was nice and chewy but the whole cookie had a pretty thick hard outer shell that I didn't care for. Maybe that wouldn't happen if it wasn't rolled in sugar? I followed the recipe exactly. I was unsure about using the full amount of the dry mixture cause the dough got pretty crumbly and tough to mix but I did. I think if I make this recipe again I will use less dry ingredients and not roll in sugar before baking. I also wonder how this dough would work for cutouts? All in all this cookie isn't bad it's just not the fantastic cookie I was hoping for.

These had a very unusual taste. The texture out of the oven was not good at  all. The texture got better with time though. I just think  I like more tradition flavor of cookies. Will not make these again. was hoping for something new and delicious but these aren't it.

I wanted something a little different and with some nutritional value for my toddlers.  This recipe sounded great.  I substitued 1/2 of the flour for whole wheat and skipped rolling them in sugar at the end and they are still wonderful.  My 16-month old twins LOVED THEM (and I ate a few too ;-)

LOVELY appearance, taste, texture, and smell!  Next time I will use less ginger and/or cloves though...slightly spicy if you want a peanut buttery cookie.  Delicious, quick, easy--definately makes my top 5 cookies list!  I will be making these again soon!

I'm a little sad that these didn't turn out as good as I'd hoped!  The peanut butter and molasses flavours weren't very prominent at all, and most of my cookies burned on the bottom despite my oven rack being set in the middle.  The flavour wasn't bad (except for the burnt bottoms) but it wasn't what I had expected.  The dough was easy to make and roll though.  I had fun trying something new, even if they weren't the best.  Thanks anyway!

The dough tasted fantastic but the flavor of the baked cookie was only so-so. After baking the molasses and peanut butter flavors mellow.  It's not peanutty enough to be a great peanut butter cookie or spicy enough to be a molasses cookie.

These are SOOO good. Once they have cooled they're slightly crispy but chewy in the middle, and the flavor is devine. While they look prettier rolled in sugar I think they're just as good without it, although I've never been a fan of sugar rolled cookies to be honest.

They were so good! The peanut and spices were a great combination, and the molasses accentuated the peanuty taste. I'd make them again in a heartbeat.

These are some of the chewiest, tastiest, most delicious cookies I've ever made!  I accidentally doubled the ginger and cloves, but it's such a small amount anyways that it didn't seem like a mistake (they were delicious!) I also used about 1/8 to 1/4 cup more molasses than I should have, because that stuff is difficult to work with! I have a new respect for the phrase "as slow as molasses," it's on par with the phrase "herding cats" now for the slow people in my life now. But I digress. These cookies rock!

i couldn't resist trying these cookies because i grew up with mary jane candy (back when they were a penny apiece). the flavor is wonderful if you're a spice fan & more complex then hot. i measured the cookie dough by level tablespoons, baked them for the same amount of time & got 41 chewy cookies. thanks so much for the tasty recipe rachel!

This was a rather unique recipe. My grandson likes them a lot. I gave only 4 stars because I didn't like the cloves, cinnamon might be better.

Everyone loved these once they figured out they weren't chocolate.  They all said "woah, what is this?" and ate them all.

5 stars, these cookies are lovely. Good flavor and not too sweet, like the Mary Jane candy. Texture is perfect, a little crispy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside. Great for kids!

I wasn't sure I'd like these, but bf and I both really like them.  The mix of pb and molassess is really nice.  I didn't roll them in sugar, but it didn't make a difference to us.  I like the crinkling pattern these cookies end up with.  Thanks for the recipe!

My husband picked out this recipe. Besides omitting the cloves since it was 9 at night and I didn't have any on hand, I stuck to the recipe. 

The first wafer of flavor IS Maryjane-like but after that its just an OK cookie. Nothing special but its not bad.

It was soft which my husband likes.

Only issue I ran into was it was a DRY dough. So dry that it was verging on crumbly. After the first batch, I added a few teaspoons of water to help.

The scoop I used was a Tablespoon scooper and I dropped it into the sugar and then placed on my sheets. They had perfect uniform shapes and looked nice.

great texture and easy to make, but very strong clove flavor (and I like a spicy cookie). however, I will make these again, only with half the amount of cloves called for. thanks for sharing this yummy and unique cookie with us!

These go really fast whenever I make them, and they are pretty easy to put together with things I normally have lying around (if you keep molasses lying around as I do). I have noticed the consistency changes -- they are nice and soft out of the oven but eventually get quite crunchy.
