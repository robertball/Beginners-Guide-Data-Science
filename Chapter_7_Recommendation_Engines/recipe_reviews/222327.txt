This is EXACTLY how my Grandma made cucumbers and green onions straight from the garden. She always used fresh dill weed from her garden as well. This is still one of my most favorite "salads". When I make it now, I use reduced fat sour cream and EVOO.

My mother used to make this and it's still going in the family. Only we also add garlic powder! Please give it a try I'm sure you'll love it.

So happy to see a  cucumber salad recipe on here. I use my Oma's recipe that has been passed down through the years as well. My Oma's is the same as this one with the exception she don't use sour cream but I am going to have to give it a try for me, mom and Oma.

The best cucumber salad I've ever had! A lot of cuke salads are just too sweet for me because they call for sugar. This one was just perfect. I followed the recipe exactly but omitted the onions. I will make this one often.

My Hungarian grandmothers also made cucumber salad this way - it is so good.  They liked the sweet/sour version and added a sprinkle of sugar to the dressing.  I can't wait for garden cucumbers!

4-11-2016  ~This is neither a difficult nor an unusual recipe for dilled cucumbers in sour cream, but some things about this one stood out for me.  First, some, but not all, recipes like this instruct you to salt the cucumbers first and I believe it is an extra step worth taking to release much of the excess liquid in the cucumbers.  The green onions add freshness, additional flavor and color.  Not sure exactly what the teensy amount of oil contributes, but I’ll tell you what – I’d leave it in there just because this was so delicious.  Other than using fresh dill rather than dried, I prepared this just as directed.  The only issue I have with the recipe is that I must have had an extraordinarily small English cucumber as I had probably twice as much of the creamy dressing as I needed.
