Admittedly I changed this recipe somewhat adding garlic, carrots and toping with Olive Oil but I found that this recipe wasn't as tasty or juicy as I would like. Generally I'm someone who likes a lot of sauce but I think it needs tahini or something like that to liven it up a bit.

This is a rather bland dish... I should have known, it being that there isn't much seasonings/spices to this dish, especially the meat... not something that I would make again.

I substituted an anaheim pepper for the green pepper, and added a pickled red pepper and extra tomato, and a couple of whole garlic cloves and this was out of this world!!!!

I was thrilled to find this recipe because I lived in Turkey for 3 years and the food there was AMAZING!  This recipe was pretty close, but to get the real taste that is lacking is red pepper paste.  You can buy it in jars and they come in both mild and hot. Now, I have had it with chicken, which was delicious, but the REAL DEAL is made with lamb. Those bite sized, tender morsels of goodness, you just have to try it!
Don't be afraid to use your spices! This dish is not so hot that you can't eat it, BUT it does have a bit of heat to it, so celebrate that!   They know their food in the Middle East, trust me!   Use this recipe as a guideline because I have the feeling that the submitter enjoyed this dish as much as I did and she's just trying to recreate it.   Believe me, I have been doing the same thing since I lived there.  I'm just going to tell you again... The people in the Middle East KNOW their food, and it is AWESOME!
I would, however, suggest that you try lamb as your protein.  Lamb is used A LOT in the Middle East and , when they make it, it is like butter.  It literally melts in your mouth.  Just try it.  Not only will you be eating what they use most to make this dish,  but you will be eating something INCREDIBLE.
