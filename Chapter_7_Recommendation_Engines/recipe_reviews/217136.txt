I'm not a pork chop fan but these were really good.  I seasoned the chops with a heavy dose of chili powder since we like a kick in our food.  I also did not have fresh apricots or canned, so I used apricot preserves instead.  I will definitely make this again..very easy and quick!

Outstanding  - followed the directions + I added sweet onions. Next time I would add more honey. I used canned Apricots and dried them with a paper towel before stering them in. What a treat

This is a simple and delicious recipe! I added a lot  more honey and used a whole can of apricots. Be generous with the salt on the chops. I served this with rice to absorb some of the sauce and it was a hit!

I made this tonight with just 2 boneless pork chops. Hubby and I loved the flavor. Made some changes, because I didn't have fresh apricots. Used a handful of dried apricots cut into pieces and a tbls of sugar free apricot preserves and 1 tbls of agave (hubby is diabetic). Should have used less olive oil, but the flavors were great. This will also go great with chicken (bnls thighs or breasts). Served with tomato, corn, onion salad from this site; great compliment. Terrific dinner. Hubby had offered to go out, but said that this could be served in a great restaurant. I'm smiling.

We really liked this.  We had steamed asparagus with a warm lemon vinaigrette as she suggested and it was a beautiful counter-point.  Brilliant.  
Yes, once the chops were done I took them out and mashed up the peaches so that they were more of a sauce.  (store did not have ripe apricots but our Colorado peaches were nice and ready)

Absolutelly DELISH!!!  We didn't have fresh parsley or fresh garlic, so we subsituted.  Unfortunately we didn't have honey either. The apricots weren't ripe so we also used a can of lite apricots.  This was fabulous and I can't wait to try it exactly as the recipe is written.  I wouldn't trade for a steak dinner.  BTW, the apricots don't have to be ripe.  We sliced them thinly and they tasted better than the canned.  Next time I may thicken the sauce a bit with cornstarch.  Or not.  I'm so satisfied!!

I substituted apricot preserves instead of fresh apricots and used bone in pork chops instead of boneless and they were very good.

This was very disappointing. The pork tasted fine, but the apricots stayed tart and the pan juices were thin. The apricots added nothing to the flavor of the pork. Next time, I will use a recipe that uses apricot preserves instead of fresh apricots.

I substituted 1/2 a sweet red onion, sliced, for the garlic, sauteeing it for a few minutes in the olive oil before browning the meat. I also substituted 4 (peeled, sliced) peaches for the apricots, as there were no fresh apricots available. When the meat was done, I removed and covered it and reduced the sauce a bit before serving. The resulting dish was delicious, and went well with green beans and brown rice. I look forward to next summer's apricots so I can try the original. Note: no extra honey was needed.

The flavors were great, but following the directions as written produced pork that was too well done for my taste. After reading some reviews, I also substituted preserves instead of fresh fruit. 
The second time I made this, I seared the meat for about 4 minutes per side. After searing the second side, I removed the pork from the pan and poured in the sauce, simmering until it thickened up a bit. Then I returned the meat to the pan and simmered for only 5 or so minutes.

I didn't follow this recipe exactlyâ€¦I did not have fresh apricots so I used apricot jam and added fresh mango to the sauce.  I thinned the sauce using chicken broth.  I added cinnamon & ginger to the sauce.  Everyone loved it, including our 2 yr old,  and came back for seconds!  Highly recommend!

I followed the recipe with only one change.  I used a can of apricots.  This isn't a bad recipe, but I was pretty disappointed with it.  This didn't make very much sauce, and the flavor was not out of the ordinary.  There are other, similar recipes that are better.

This was a really easy and delicious recipe. I served it with a nice Pinot Grigio white wine and it paired really well with this dish because it was sweet.  I will definitely make it again!

I followed the advice of other reviewers and added some extra honey. It tasted nice, but I'm not sure it was to our preferences. I think it's unlikely that I'll make this again.

Yes, after reading reviews I included many of the suggestions. No fresh apricots available, so substituted both preserves and canned apricots. I only had mango infused honey which I think only added to the yumminess.
A big deviation was the addition of tamari, low sodium version and a small slurry of cornstarch to thicken up the sauce. We all loved it. Quick and easy.

If you prepare it exactly as written, you will not have enough liquid to simmer. The suggestion of preserves is a good one. Nothing to write home about without several changes (gotta love the folks who leave 5 stars then make a list of everything they altered).

Tried this recipe to use up some fresh apricots I had on hand. It was yummy and we all liked it, but I wish I would have read the reviews first and used some of the suggestions from other cooks. If I make it again I will add more honey and maybe more apricots or a little apricot or apple juice because the pan juices were spare. I also like the idea of a little chili powder or chili seeds because it seemed like it would benefit from a little heat. Definitely worth trying again!!

EASY and QUICK!  Made it with canned apricots, but no other changes. Very tasty and on the table from frozen to meal in under an hour.  I added rice (the apricot sauce was delicious on it) and a bag of frozen vegetables (onion, pepper, zucchini and summer squash) and our meal was wonderful!  Give it a try tonight...or at least save this recipe!

Yum! Pork was tender and juicy. I'll never make chops any other way. I used cut up mango instead of apricots since that is what I had. It was sweet and delicious! Tonight I'm trying it with chicken tenders.

This was amazing. EVERYONE in our family loved it! Apricots are not in season here, so I was only able to obtain them in a can. I drained, rinsed, and patted them dry, but otherwise followed the recipe to the letter. Wonderful, will definitely make this again!

Great! Will be making again. I have started to add fruit to our menu and this recipe does.  I did use canned apricot instead of fresh. A dish I will make again!

This was good, but the chops were a little dry we thought... next time I'll make this in the slow cooker. I used about 4 tbsp. of apricot preserves instead of the apricots.

I made this and it was successful.  The store didn't have fresh or even canned apricots, so I substituted two cans of fried apples in syrup.  Because the syrup already had sugar, I left out the honey.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe.  I used 3/4" boneless pork chops.  My family complimented it.  One person commented on the tenderness of the meat, and another said they initially thought it might be too sweet, but when they tasted it, it wasn't.  I would make this again.

It was a good dinner.  The family liked it.  I did add more apricots, used 8 because they were small, and added more honey, used 4 tablespoons, and everyone liked it.  Will make again.

This was delicious or "licious" as my granddaughter used to say.  I did add an extra tablespoon of honey and an extra T of olive oil.  I served it with egg noodles drippd with lemon juice.  I made sure my chops had some fat for flavor.  My husband also said it was a keeper.

It was ok. I was disappointed because I really couldnâ€™t taste the apricots. I think next time Iâ€™ll do less honey and try apricot jam   Perhaps the honey garlic and apricots should sit overnight. Iâ€™d also add a tiny pinch of Chile powder. Itâ€™s a good basic recipe but needs refining.

very simple and delicious.  Our local grocery store didn't have fresh, canned, or frozen apricots so we used pluots and nectarines instead.  It turned out  excellent.  Served with steamed white rice, red cabbage and asparagus.  Cant wait to find apricots to make this as intended.

Came out great! I did use can apricots. I Use 8 pork chops,  two cans apricots, six tablespoons honey and a lot of garlic. We love garlic. It did come out a little running but I thickened it up with a little corn starch and water. It mixed with the rice great. Will be making it again.

I substituted peaches for the apricots and had to cook the pork chops longer because they were so thick, but everything turned out right and it tasted great. I will do this dish again with apricots, for sure.

Used canned apricots in own juice put all in pan after took browned chops out  and simmered to reduce some of the liquid and scrap of the good little bits. Everything else the same except had only two bone in chops but there are only two of us and I can't eat much meat. Meat needed more cooking time. Must depend on thickness of chops. Wonderful apricot flavor. I had some precooked rice an just tossed it in at the simmering stage to be sure it was warm. Served with green beans. Will make again.

I have now made this twice.  The first time, I followed the recipe as written.  I liked the flavor, but the pork chops were very dry after browning 5 mins. on each side, and the honey very quickly turned black during simmering.  This second time, I used thin-sliced pork chops and only browned them for about 1.5 mins. on each side.  To simmer them, I mixed 1 cup of apricot preserves together with the honey, then added that to my skillet....  this way, I got much more apricot flavor, and I got the honey flavor without it turning dark and ugly.  I also think it helped with keeping the pork chops moist.  Then, I added my quartered fresh apricot wedges to the simmering mixture for just the last 1-2 minutes.....  this was enough to warm them, but not turn them to a cooked mush.  I served the pork chops and fresh apricots over rice, with all the delicious juices spooned on top.  THIS I will make again!
**ADDENDUM: TONIGHT I MADE IT USING PEACHES, AS THEY WERE ABUNDANT AT THE FARM MARKET, AND PEACH PRESERVES..... I THINK THEY WORK EQUALLY AS WELL AS APRICOTS! :) **

I absolutely love this recipe! I added some very finely chopped, seeded, habaneros and it was amazing! I used more honey than the recipe. There was a lot of the mixture left over so I used it with over easy eggs for breakfast the next day. I cannot get over how good it is!

Made true to recipe and it couldn't be easier! I was a little concerned it might end up too sweet but it wasn't at all. Excellent recipe that turns out a beautiful dish and brought a little fancy to our weekday dinner.

This recipe turned out perfect and was the perfect compliment for the pork. They came out juicy and full of flavor this way. The second time around I tweaked it a bit by using a dash of chili powder and red pepper flakes as well as some bits of chopped dried apricots I found in the cabinet. It gave it a little more of a kick.

I am disabled and just starting to really cook. I tried this recipe tonight for my husband and I, using 1 large bone in pork steak. I made the mistake of using pink Himalayan salt, which is much saltier than regular salt. Being fairly new to "real" cooking and following the recipe as closely as possible, I did not realize that the heat should be reduced while simmering and the recipe did not specify this. The meat and apricots were scorched, but they still tasted pretty good despite being overly salty. I will be trying this recipe again, making adjustments accordingly. I made broccoli with balsamic dressing and my own recipe for sweet potato casserole as side dishes. There are no leftovers so it must have been good!!

This was really good. Based on other reviews, I doubled up on the honey and added an equal amount of apricot preserves. I only had dried apricots instead of fresh, but these seemed to work just fine. Will definitely make this again.
