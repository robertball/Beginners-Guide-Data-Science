I love the addition of rice krispies to the basic cake mix cookie recipe! You can add another egg, and another cup of cereal-- you'll get a stickier dough, but the extra crunch is great! Or you can substitute plain/lemon yogurt for some of the oil-- adds more of a kick, and reduces the fat!

Oh my! This recipe was so wonderful!  I am doing a bake sale for Cystic Fibrosis and I am sure people are going to love these! I know we do...I used just lemon cake and added vanilla pudding to the ingredients(dry not made), used 2 eggs like previously mentioned and also an extra cup of rice crispies and cooked for 14 minutes in my oven.  I topped them with lemon icing! Divine!!! Making these again soon!!! Thanks so much!

I made these for a party and everyone LOVED them.  Almost everyone asked for the recipe.  I live at high altitude, so I added 1/4 cup of flour and 2 tbs lemon juice.  I piped some lemon frosting on each cookie. So Easy! So Good! Would have taken a picture, but there aren't any left.

I made these for a baby shower, and everyone loved them!! I added a lemon icing to top the cookies with and found that they were too crispy if i baked them for 9 minutes like the recipe calls. So I ended up leaving them in the oven for about 6 minutes and they were just right!!!! :)

Couldn't believe it would be so quick and easy and still good, but BOY! These are awesome. I did add more than one cup of crispy rice cereal... maybe cup and a half. The crispiness was right on. And the lemon flavor was perfect. This recipe will go to the top of my cookie list.

I made these little delights to be included in the treats that I made for gifts for Christmas. Everyone just loved them! I also drizzled the powdered sugar icing over them so they looked beautiful as well. VERY EASY RECIPE! I followed the recipe as posted and was very pleasantly surprised!

These cookies sounded so good to me, and the texture was good with the chewy/crunchy combo.  However, they had an off-taste to them.  They tasted fake, if that makes sense.  Too chemically tasting or something.  It's like the difference between boxed brownies and from-scratch brownies.  It's a HUGE difference.

I purchased regular lemon cake mix, by accident, and had to add some more melted butter (2-3 Tbsp.)  I served them without the frosting and they were a HIT!  It is a different kind of cookie - a welcome change from the regular stuff.  Will definitely make again!

These are very easy, delicious cookies.   I whipped up a batch using the recipe as written and they turned out fantastic.   I found the dough became more workable when I let it rest a minute following the addition of the melted butter.  Once the butter was worked in, I added the egg.   The batter was easy to work with and I'm thinking this recipe might lend itself to other flavors, such as orange or cherry.   After looking at the reviews, I might try some of the tweaks suggested; I particularly like the one for using lemon juice.

I was scanning for a quick and easy cookie recipe, and found this one. I skipped the cereal, and added 2 chopped jersey milk bars instead. They're now my boyfriend's favourite!

These were not a hit in our house.  One family member thought they smelled like lemon pledge and the other family member asked if the chewy cereal in the cookie was corn.

I really like the cookies!  I had a bunch of lemons on my tree, so I added fresh squeezed lemon to the mix (a little more than 1 tblsp).  I also found I had to cook them 18-20 minutes in my oven.  Don't know if it is the pan I used, or the oven!

I also iced the cookies with the Lemon Frosting recipe I found on this site, ymmy!

I thought I would love these but the texture was weird and they didn't keep well after I made them. I think I expected them to be more tart. I may try again with a lil modification. =)

At first I wasn't sure how I felt about the lemon flavor, but after a few cookies I was hooked. Definitely a nice change from your typical cookie recipes. I think that I will also experiment with other cake mix flavors - maybe confetti cake!

Normally I don't like cake mix cookies because of the texture.  BUT, because of the addition of the rice krispies they have a nice crunchiness.  I got the regular cake mix (accidentally) instead of the one with pudding.  I added a couple tbsp more butter because of it.  Also used 2 eggs and double the rice krispies.  I used a cookie scoop and baked them about 11 min.'s.  They came out great!  They didn't spread much at all.  I did have a little trouble with them sticking to the pan just a little. Parchment paper would fix that.  I glazed with a buttery, powdered sugar glaze.  REALLY good! The kids loved them!

these were good, fast and easy.  seemed a little too dry when forming balls, but came out of the oven okay...?  I might add some melted butter next time to make shaping the balls easier.

Love these little guys! It was so very easy. I did the same thing someone else did by buying the mix w/o pudding. However, they came out fine. I bet they would have been better had I got a mix with pudding! If I could, I would rate this as a 10. I would have liked it even better if you had included the glaze you used.

These were good; however, came out a little hard.  I understand they are crisps, but they were still a little 'snappy' - Next time, I might use a little water. I made powdered sugar icing w/ green food coloring to add a little 'pizzazz'... Other than that, yummy!

I am a lover of lemon cakes and pies so I was anxious to try this recipe. Unfortunately, the cookies were hard and did not taste like a good lemon flavor, too imitation.

I made this recipe for a cookie exchange. I followed the recipe except took the advice of other reviews and added 1/2 c more of the Rice Krispies. I always use real butter in everything and because I wanted a more lemon flavor i added 1 tsp of real lemon juice as other reviewers did. I liked the ease of this recipe. I liked the simple ingredients. I loved the lemon taste. I should not have added the extra Rice Krispies. However, regardless of the extra 1/2 c I'm not sure it would have changed my star rating. The Rice Krispies made the cookie turn out very gross. The cereal had an almost rubbery texture and or stale texture. I just opened the box so I know the cereal wasn't stale. I topped all the cookies off with a lemon icing I got off another cookie from this website which made the cookie better but not enough for me to forgive the cereals texture and fast. If I made these again I would leave out the Rice cereal and add white chocolate chips and and the same icing which was 5 star worthy. If I hadn't procrastinated with making cookies I'd have a better cookie to take to my exchange but I did and this is the consequence. I'm glad I won't be around when the ladies taste my cookie.

This was a quick and easy recipe, which is what I like. It made exactly 2 dozen cookies that my family and I loved! I added some powder sugar frosting with lemon oil. The perfect top off on this cookie.

My son, who is in the Coast Guard and stationed in a small town in Alaska, loves all things lemon. It's hard to know what to send him as birthday and Christmas gifts, so this past Christmas, along with a gift card, I sent him an assortment of home-made cookies. Included in these were a couple dozen of these lemon crisp cookies. He had company for Christmas, and he said these cookies were a favorite for everyone. He also asked for the recipe. These cookies stayed fresh and didn't arrive in Alaska in crumbles. I packed them in freezer bags and then packed those in bubble wrap and sent all in a sturdy cardboard box. 

The only things I did that varied from the recipe were add a little bit of lemon juice to ramp up the tartness, and I crushed the Rice Krispies a little bit before I added them to the batter. I sprinkled the tops of the cookies with baker's sugar before I put them in the oven. 

I'll definitely make them again...as a matter of fact, I'm going to the store to buy another box of lemon cake mix tomorrow so I can bake more to send my son for his birthday in a couple of weeks (along with another gift card...his choices where he's stationed are limited but at least Amazon delivers there).

Didn't care for these.  Were dry and crumbly.  Probably won't make again.

I took these to work along with a can of lemon frosting. Everybody loved them. They were gone in no time.
