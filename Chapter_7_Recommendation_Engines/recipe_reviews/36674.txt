This was absolutely fantastic. I made it with baby artichokes that the grocery store had on sale (because no one knew what to do with them). It was very easy. I served it over pasta and grated Parmesan cheese over it.

These tasted pretty good but not sure it was worth the trouble to clean/trim the artichokes.  If I try again it will be with frozen hearts.  Thanks, though!
