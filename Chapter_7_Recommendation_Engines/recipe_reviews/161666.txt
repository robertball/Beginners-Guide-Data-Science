A rich dish. I added 2 cups sliced small Bella mushrooms during the last hour. Spooned over a background of soft cooked grits. Oxtails are all about deep smooth flavor. I upped the garlic and onions salt and pepper to give it some edges. The recipe works well for this classic. I might spoon in some tomato paste and up the liquid next time.

My family absolutely loved this recipe. 3 1/2 hrs made it a little overcooked but the flavour was out of this world and the meat just fell off the bone!!

OMG! This was AMAZING! I followed the recipe almost and it turned out perfect. The only thing I did differently was to salt the actual oxtail pieces rather than mix the salt in with the flour and garlic/onion powder. Also I didn't have onion powder so I just used double garlic powder and it was still awesome. This is definitely going to be my go-to meal if I need to impress someone! Cook it the full time...I did only 2.5 hours and it was not fall-off-the-bone which meant it was harder to eat.

This was amazing. I basically followed the recipe but added mushrooms potatoes extra carrots and peas toward the end. I cooked it in my le creuset pot for over 3 1/2 hours and the meat was falling off the bone. Rave reviews from my friends. Fantastic flavor. Will definitely make again.

Love this recipe! I substituted beef shanks for the oxtails... they were more readily available and a lot cheaper. Not to mention was just as tender and delicious with a ton more (accessible)meat. The shanks actually turned out better for me than my oxtails did.

I've made this with a similar recipe. But instead of thyme it called for oregano I also used celery salt instead of celery root/stalk 1 bottle of red wine 1 cup of broth no flour. But I suppose that is to thicken the fluid. It also called to season the oxtail with allspice salt and pepper over night or at least 2 hours marinating. Seared the oxtails before putting it in the liquid mixture. Placed everything in a Dutch oven & covered. My oxtails were cut so thick so I cooked it for 2 1/2 hours on 325 in the oven. Tastes heavenly. This is how I'm going to make it all the time.

Very delicious! I served it over rice. I did add a wee bit more garlic but other than that I didnt change a thing. I did however cook it as directed but in a crockpot at low for 3 hrs. Still turned out fine! thanks for a great recipe.

I love this recipe...have never eaten oxtail before this.  Wasn't even sure what they were, so I googled it and found it sounded too good to skip.  Then I found this recipe...It reminded me of a recipe for Beef Bourguignon that I love.  It is every bit as rich as that...but with a little more subtle overall flavor.  

I will make one change next time and that would be to soak the oxtail in the red wine overnight...that will help breakdown the toughness even more than just slow cooking alone.  The only other change I made was I added more garlic powder...it was actually an accident...but one I liked.  I served it over an al dente' fettuccine which was a perfect match for the sauce.  Speaking of sauce...OMG!  Yet another reminder that if you cook full flavored, rich food, you don't need typical American type portions.  A much smaller portion was very satisfying.  The only problem I had was that I got impatient and didn't  reduce the wine enough in the first part of the recipe, which left me with too much liquid at the end so I had to reduce that more to make up for it.  That's my own fault and a reminder to all to take your time and don't rush this one.  You'll be glad you didn't because the final outcome is perfect if you follow this recipe.

When I bought the oxtails (I'd never eaten nor cooked them before) my husband faked a gag and said his mom used to make vegetable soup with oxtails and that's why he hated vegetable soup until he'd met me. He said he'd trust me as I'm a great cook but also asked me what we'd have as a "back up" in case oxtail was truly awful. Well!!! This was decadently fabulous! I pretty much followed the instructions as written. I took someone's suggestion of marinating the oxtails in the red wine (I used Bogle Old Vine Zin - only 1/2 a bottle) and added several cloves of sliced garlic. I marinated for about 4 hours. I then heavily dredged the tails in the seasoned flour and used a cast iron skillet to pan sautee them in a mixture of bacon grease and butter. Once the tails had a good crust on them I placed them on top of uncooked celery and carrots in a tall dutch oven. I then deglazed the cast iron skillet with the marinating liquid and garlic gently stiring and letting it thicken/reduce to roughly 1/2. I then poured the contents of the skillet over the tails in the dutch oven. I then added the beef broth pouring it directly over the contents of the dutch oven. Cooked for about 4 hours at 350. The dish was so rich and flavorful and the meat just fell off the bones. This is more than enough for at least 4 or 5 people. I served it with mashed garlic potatoes and sweet and sour German red cabbage on the side with sourdough toasts. WOW! Oh...and my husband said he'd never

The dish is delicious and very simple. It takes some time but is totally worth it. The meat is moist and very flavorful. I served it two different was (both pictures posted). I served it with some thyme rice with a red pepper soup. I also served it shredded atop some sage gnocchi with broccoli and peas. Both dishes were delicious and is an easy way to impress without having to do too much.

Holy cow this was delicious. I cut the whole recipe in half since I only had 2.5 lbs of oxtail. It made about six decent-sized servings. I hadn't ever had oxtail before and I'm very glad I started with this recipe.

I made this recipe just as it was written except I didn t have shallots and I used onions. The red wine sauce was really good but a little bit strong for me. I will make this again but next time I ll cut it with a little bit more beef broth so it has more beef flavor than wine flavor. That was the first time of ever had ox tails and they were super tender and way more meaty then I ever thought. This dish went really well with rice and gremolotta.

This was a different option for my husband's change in diet. I cut out most of the salt, using a low salt or no salt seasoning. He was delighted and asked for me to make it again.

I omitted the onion powder garlic powder Parsley. I added red potatoes and rosemary. I then added some red wine vinegar to brighten the broth after I had reduced it by 1/2 to brighten the flavor. Next time I will use 1/2 of the beef base to the same amount of water. It was just a tad to salty. Otherwise very unctuous and delicious. Very rich stew. I'll make it again but just once a year..

Almost didn't make due to the prep effort before baking but sooooooo glad I did! I think the BEST oxtail dish I've ever had. Didn't have/use celery so substituted roasted corn & okra. A MUST try if you like oxtail...

So good as it is but next time I think I'll take the top off the pot an hour be free taking it out of the oven. I also will add some button mushrooms with the carrots and onions.

OMG the meat just falls off the bone. The liquids were more than I needed in my pan and had to remove 2 cups. I had a little more than 5 lbs but it was oh so good.
