The flavors really go well together. - The earthy parsnips, salt from bacon, tang from vinegar, with a hint of sweetness from the sugar and the crunchiness of the nuts.  Didn't have pecans so I used walnuts.  Will make again.

The flavours went together well! I was quite surprised. The parsnips were a little under-cooked, so I'd recommend cooking them slightly longer. I will definitely impress guests with this side dish!

Very nice combination of ingredients! I used regular bacon and omitted the onion and this turned out quite tasty. Will make again!

My father asked for a parsnip dish when we cooked dinner for them.  Without ever really knowing what a parsnip was, we stumbled upon this recipe.  My father absolutely loved this recipe and has asked for it several more times!  I don't care for parsnips but, lucky us, he always asks to take home all of the leftovers!
