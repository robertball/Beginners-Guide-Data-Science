Anniebb, I've found the potato starch will be make the dough denser and stickier, while potato flour will make dough less dense, a little less sticky. It really depends what you are making. But if you are making pie crust, a combo of rice, tapioca and potato flour or starch works fine. For example, if you use in potato starch in chocolate chip cookies it makes a dense, cake-like cookie. I use sorghum, rice and tapioca for cookies now. It makes a texture similar to the traditional "toll house cookie." Hope this help. Happy Thanksgiving.

I was intimidated since other allergen free pumpkin pies involved tofu...ack, not in my pie! But this recipe had no tofu and it tasted like normal pumpkin pie. We do not have a gluten problem in our house so I did use my preferred crust, but used the filling and it was really, really good. It came out a little bit denser than I was expecting so may try a wee bit less cornstarch next time, and I may also try ditching the crust, putting the filling in souffle ramekins and then sprinkling gingerbread cookies on top of it. Amazingly good allergen free option, I highly recommend. Thank you so much!

I would have rated this recipe five stars, but I cooked it for 1 1/2 hrs. and it still wasn't done in the middle!!  My oven is less than 6 months old and I've never had this happen before so I don't think my oven was the issue.  Even though it wasn't done, I pulled it out of the oven and refriderated it overnight as called for. It was very, very good! I also used a store bought GFCF pie crust. I will make this again and maybe turn the oven up 25 degrees.  Yumm!

A friend of mine recently found out he was allergic to gluten and I am a baker so I of course had to find some recipes to try out.  I found this book... Check out the site, this book has AMAZING recipes! Just thought I would share it with you.  I had satisfied customers - everyone in my family!

My 7 year old is allergic to milk and eggs, but loves pumpkin pie.  This was a GREAT alternative for him and he LOVED it!!  I used a Pillsbury crust since we don't have a gluten issue, but it turned out perfectly!  Thanks for submitting!!

My first ever gluten-free (vegan) pie - SUPER EASY and YUMMY! I made this pie for Thanksgiving and it was a hit. I mostly followed the recipe with the following exceptions: instead of ½ tsp ground ginger I only used a dash and added ½ tsp pumpkin pie spice; instead of canned pumpkin I used freshly baked & finely processed pumpkin – 2 cups as called for; and I was unable to find soy creamer at the store, so I used coffee-mate French vanilla creamer instead. Bake the crust 15 minutes – no more, no less. Follow directions exactly for the crust and it will turn out amazing – flakier than a regular (gluten) crust and with WAY more flavor. Since I was using a stone pie plate, I had already planned to bake the pie more than 60 minutes. My knife inserted 1 inch from the crust didn’t come out clean after an hour, so I didn’t feel bad leaving it in for 30 more minutes. I didn’t use the knife test again at the end of 90 minutes because if that wasn’t long enough, then there was something I did wrong with the recipe. Don’t let the appearance fool you – It won’t look done in the middle, but at the end of 90 minutes this pie was perfectly cooked. After I let it cool on a cooling rack on the counter for 2 hours, it was indeed cooked in the middle. I made it the day before Thanksgiving so it sat in the refrigerator overnight. To serve I simply reheated in a 350 degree oven for 15 mins. This recipe is virtually fool-proof; it’s easy, simple and SO tasty! Highly recommended!

Made this Gluten Free, Dairy Free, Egg Free and Soy Free for my daughter with multiple food allergies and she LOVED it!  I used Almond Milk with a touch of vanilla added, in place of the soy creamer.  Thank you for a great CRUST RECIPE that I plan to use for all my Pies!

Very good recipe.  My husband did not even know the difference between this one and my other pumpkin pie.  The only change I will try is changing the spices to my favorite pumpkin recipe.  I thought there was to much spice for me.

As long as you let the pie chill overnight it is fabulous!  It has a slightly different texture than normal pumpkin pie, but still very good.  I only used the pie filling recipe and put it in my own crust.  I used canned coconut milk instead of soy, sucanat instead of brown sugar and pure maple syrup instead of corn syrup. This is the best allergy friendly pumpkin pie I have tasted!

Great!!! I used regular milk (less than called for), less spices, less sugar, molasses instead of corn syrup. Baked with no crust for 30, topped with an apple crisp topping, finished baking. It was delicious warm and cold!!

Excellent.  Since I didn't need to avoid gluten, I used a refrigerated pie crust and used pumpkin pie spice instead of the cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg & cloves.  We thought the flavor of this pie was better than traditional pumpkin pie.  I will definitely make again even if I don't need to avoid egg and dairy.

An absolute family favorite! I have food allergies and made this for our family Thanksgiving one year; my husband, who is a pumpkin pie nut, says this is his favorite recipe because it has more flavor and tastes more pumpkin-y than traditional recipes. I even have people asking me for the recipe. The crust is a little salty and dry, but it provides nice contrast to the filling and I kinda like it. Just don't expect flaky traditional crust and you will be very happy

I didn't make the crust (I used store-bought since I'm not vegan), but I made the filling exactly as the recipe called for, and it was delicious! I am lactose and egg intolerant, so this recipe was perfect for me! The filling had great flavor and texture. I baked my pie for about 75 minutes since the knife didn't come out clean at 60. The filling looked darker than most pumpkin pies I've seen, but it tasted great! I'll be making this again next Thanksgiving.

Just made this recipe and followed recipe as listed but changed one thing....to make it soy free I used coconut  milk (carton) instead of the soy creamer in crust and pie filling.  I did have to bake it about 15 min longer than the stated hour but this pie is simply delicious! I am so glad I found this recipe so myself and my grandson with allergies to gluten..dairy...egg and soy can eat this!! I am planning on making a coconut milk whipping cream for it and hope that is just as yummy!!

This pie was baked with love for my 3 yr old with Food Allergies. :)
But... I'm so terrible at following rules (and recipes), so I DID do a little of my own stuff with this recipe, but this recipe was what our pie was based on. First of all, I used a store bought pie crust. (I was saving time because I was also baking 4 other pies besides this one). Anyway, I basically followed the instructions in this recipe except I used a little aunt jemima syrup instead of the dark corn syrup (didn't have it) and I used pumpkin pie spice with a bunch of extra cinnamon just until I thought it tasted good. Also, I added a little extra sugar (white) until I got it sweet enough to suit me... Looked delicious, tasted even more delicious!!!

Haven't tried it yet, but can't get my question asked without rating the recipe (-:  Kate, Do you use potato flour or potato starch in your homemade GF all-purpose flour mix?  Just starting to bake GF and have read that potato starch is better, but don't know why.  Thanks.
