This was a great recipe, with some recommendations.  I added a little more honey, less sesame oil(would use a tablespoon or less), definitely used mirin, soy sauce(low sodium - it's what I have) and rice wine vinegar.  Some wasabi paste added to the marinade and dipping sauce is a must for some zip. I cut the steaks so that they are about 1/2 to 3/4" thick and sear for about 40 seconds.  If they are thicker they burn before they even cook a little - I like them pink, not red in the middle. Preheat cast iron, but be sure to turn down the head to medium high or you will have smoke and smoke alarms going off.   Sesame Seeds - don't bother - I've tried it both ways, they don't add much, and they pop all over the place when you sear the steaks and make a mess. ( I lightly toasted them first - so if you have to have them - toast them, then dip the seared steaks just before you serve, and save yourself a lot of clean up. I served  with plain rice or long grain and wild rice.  Great to sop up the dipping sauce.

Awesome. I thawed frozen Ahi from Costco. This tastes almost like steak! Don't have iron skillet - used non-stick. Didn't have mirin - used sweet vermouth.  Still perfect. This recipe rocks because my house doesn't stink like fish as long as I use the pan's lid while cooking! I split more like 30/70 for the sauce, because we like extra to put on our rice (and there is still plenty to dredge the fish in). I "dry" the fish with paper towels after thawing so it will absorb more of the sauce.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  However, I took the very thick tuna steaks pretty much directly from the fridge to the skillet and they were (obviously) still cold in the middle during consumption.  Next time, I'll let the tuna come closer to room temperature before searing.

I make seared tuna at least 2x a week. This is a good recipe. If you want to cut out some steps with the same great results instead of making the sauce Kikkoman puts out a "Roasted Garlic" Teriyaki sauce that is excellent with this fish.I serve the tuna on a platter with a small bowl of sauce, seaweed salad(found at your grocery store sushi bar)pickled ginger and wasabi paste.If your seeds are scorching add them to the tuna after searing just make sure that you toast them first. Enjoy!

i loved the tuna.  sooo good.  my bf asked if we can eat this every week!  a few suggestions that i have: adding a bit of grated ginger along with juice to the searing marinade really spices up the recipe. instead of coating the tuna with sesame seeds then searing them, i bought toasted sesame seeds and then sprinkled the sesame after my tuna was cooked.  make sure the tuna is seared on medium heat b/c high heat burns the tuna and causes lots of smoke.  chop up some scallions and sprinkling them over the tuna along with the sesame makes the whole plate look more attractive (i.e red and green contrast)

simple and delicious.  Ran into a friend who is a chef when I was buying the wine the recipe called for and he said to forget it, it won't matter.  He was right!

This recipe is unbelievably easy and fantastic.  I used brown sugar because I didn't have honey (allergic) and I doubled the dipping sauce.  Half the sauce I used to marinate the tuna steaks for about 2 hours, and the rest for dipping.  I have never had a recipe disappear so fast. Definitely my new favorite fish recipe.

Delicious.  I have been waiting to try this recipe for a while now.  I only make fresh tuna for occasions and it was sensational.  The sesame seeds were a great crunchy contrast to the tuna steaks.  Seared them for only 30 seconds on each side.  Hubby loved this...and I did too.  (So did my 1 1/2 year old son who doesn't like fresh tuna).  Will be used again and again.  Thanks for the post.

ABSOLUTELY OUTRAGEOUS!!!! My kids love tuna steaks and we always eat them rare, (this is a must or you might as well toss them) however, this is the first time we've made them this rare and I must tell you that I'll never eat another tuna steak any other way. After searing, hubby sliced the steaks paper thin and although the kids were a little apprehensive at first, one taste changed their minds completely. A pound and a quarter was devoured by the four of us in no time. Thanks for a superb recipe!!

I have been looking for a recipe like this one!!  The flavor and texture of the tuna was awesome.  I did not have the mirin wine.  Used a little white wine and still was great!  Sesame seeds to scorch easily.  I was dancing around when we were eating it as an appetizer.  Also made some wasabi vinegrette and served it with the soy sauce as well!!
Thanks!

Pat Tuna very dry, don't marinate - only soak for a minute in sauce. I would not substitute artificial sweetener for honey, turns bitter at high heat. You can substitute cooking sherry for the Kirin without a noticeable difference. Slice thin over crisp salad w/raw veggies and a light ginger/miso dressing for great texture and sweet/salty flavor. If you don't like rare Tuna, open a can, overcooking ruins it.

A good dish. However, I wanted to warn against using olive oil for searing. 

There's a good bit of debate over whether olive oil is suitable for frying. Virgin olive oil on its own is a very healthy fat, but when heated past its smoking point - the temperature at which fats begin to break down, unique to each variety of fat - it can potentially do you more harm than good. Estimates can vary, but I've usually seen olive oil's smoking point cited between about 375-450 degrees fahrenheit, depending on the type. Searing can involve temperatures twice that high. 

So that's something to consider.

Easy, tasty and fantastic! What more can I say about this dish? Here in Hawaii we can get fresh Ahi everyday as it is part of our local Pacfic Cuisine. Using only the freshest Ahi Tuna can really make a world of difference in this dish. I did marinate the Ahi in the sauce (personal preference). I already had all the ingredients on hand. prep time was easy and approximate. To the soy sauce (I use Aloha Soy Sauce), I added a pinch of freshly grated ginger as well. The wasabi is a must in the dipping sauce because it does add a "kick". I heat the skillet on high heat at first then lower it to medium after I place the Ahi in the pan.  I sear the Ahi for a quick 30 seconds or less depending on the thickness of the Ahi and how seared you want it. For myself? I like it a little more raw on the inside...Mmmm. I then serve this with hot steaming rice and a side of, "Tofu Salad," also found on this AR website. I've also eaten this with, "Asian Ginger Dressing," from this site, served on a bed of organic mixed greens. A Tasty, fulfilling and perfect meal! A keeper in my recipe box to use again in the future.

Excellent recipe. I made this for dinner tonight and it was a hit.  The only change I made was I substituted Agave nectar for the honey because my husband is diabetic.  Served with a rice salad of jasmine rice, julienned carrots, peas, diced red onions and thinly sliced jalepenos.  I will make this again.

This recipe is amazing.  I've made it twice now, and both times it has been perfect.  The first time I used the sesame seeds; the second time I didn't.  Tasted just as good without the sesame seeds.  I also did not have Mirin wine and used white wine instead.  I made it for a friend the second time, and he commented that it was better than anything he ever had in a restaurant.

Fantastic! The flavors were amazing. I made the full amount of sauce, though I only cooked two steaks. I didn't add vinegar to the extra sauce because I didn't have any, but it was still wonderful. I used peanut oil instead of olive oil to avoid smoking up the house. I used a mix of white and black sesame seeds, and used tamari premium soy sauce (low sodium). Also, I put the tuna directly from the pan onto the plates on a bed of fresh spinach, to wilt it, and then I tossed chopped water chestnuts, chopped green onions, and more of the sauce into the pan and stirred it on high for about a minute or so. Then I put that on top of the tuna and spinach. I served miso soup as a side, (I admit, from dehydrated soup packets.) This was a fast, healthy meal that tasted like I'd ordered it at a 5 star restaurant! Thanks!

yummy. i halved the sesame oil and it was plenty of oil. i sprinkled on the toasted sesame seeds after searing the tuna. i also added the wasabi to the marinade, like others suggested and that was good. i cooked two 5 oz tuna steaks for my husband and i and we would have been happy with half that much. i can only eat so much of raw fish at a time! thinly sliced green onions would be yummy on top - when serving. will make again!

I was hoping someone had tried this with salmon as I had no tuna.  (Never have cooked tuna,so...)  No one had tried it.   I did. Man it was good!  I followed the recipe exactly, frying the salmon in a cast iron skillet.  I did cook it thoroughly as "rare" isn't my thing exept with oysters. (OK, not smart..just good) It was wonderful.  Try it with salmon! Cook to your level of liking.

This is a fairly standard recipe and suitable fr all Tuna lovers. There are different variety of Tuna and for this I used Yellowfin (ahi) for a less fatty presentation. I have been encouraging my students to experiment with salts and sugars and so for this I substituted Melon Tawny sugar for honey and to maintain the nuttiness from the sesame seed I substituted Peanut Oil for Olive Oil and watched my husband raise his eyes, for I am an advocate of Olive Oil and I import it directly from an Olive grower in Italy every year when I get the first Cold Pressed (suitable for drinking too). But for high flash cooking I use either Peanut or Grapeseed oils and occasionaly Canola, when I have been assured that it is not genetically modified. When purchasing Tuna do try to have a good Fishmonger cut it choice and examine the grain. I do not encourage guests to "dip" at my dinner table so try using the sauce to accompany or dress a salad when setting a formal course.

Excellent marinade and a perfect compliment to the tuna.  I also added grated garlic and ginger and let the tuna marinate for about 3 hours.  I cooked the tuna for a couple of minutes on each side then sprinkled with toasted black and white sesame seeds and did a quick flip on each side to further toast them and adhere them to the fish.  Delicious and a definite keeper recipe for us.  We'll also try on other firm fish.

I loved this marinade for the Tuna steaks! It's great with or without the sesame seeds too. I served it alongside some sushi rice and drizzled soy sauce over it and some fresh grilled veggies. Yum!

Definitely 30 seconds or less for each side is more than enough time to sear the steak. The grated ginger adds a kick to the taste.  No wasabi was available so that was left out.

I followed others advice and decreased the oil and increased the honey.  I actually let the tuna sit in all the marinade for a few hours (don't know if it really did anything).  Before cooking I made a half batch of marinade for dipping and drizzling.  I let the tuna sit for a bit to come up to temperature before cooking and then seared.  I didn't time it, I just watched it like a hawk.  I didn't turn my pan up all the way (read about burning the seeds) so it took a little longer...but it was Y U M M Y!!!  I served it in thin slices over jasmine rice and then drizzled the sauce over the top.  Will make again!  No need to go out anymore.

Thanks for sharing! Easy & tasty recipe for when one spots great looking ahi tuna at the market. I didn't have and definitely missed the wasabi paste, because without it, the dipping sauce could be a bit cloying to the palate. Served with creamy mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus spears.

This tuna tasted 5 stars, but the searing made it smoke a lot and scorched the sesame seeds so I gave it 4. I would advise adding sesame seeds after cooking. I didn't have mirin so I skipped it, and I also used apple cider vinegar instead of rice wine vinegar. Yummy :)

Fabulous! My 17-year-old thought it was the best recipe we'd made in months. I served the tuna with white rice and oven roasted asparagus, red pepper and garlic, coated in olive oil. The lefover fish was great in a wrap the next day with baby greens, cucumber and sesame-ginger dressing!

AWESOME!  Try serving the tuna steaks over a bed of spring mix greens and mandarin oranges from the can.  use some of the mandarin juice in your dipping sauce which serves as the salad dressing also. put a little wasabi on the plate to dunk for some more zip....a complete meal, healthy and delicious in minutes flat!  a real family favorite.

This is an excellent recipe.  If you really want to enhance this recipe I advise one small addition.  Get yourself a nice sized shallot.  Before you sear the tuna, slice up a nice sized shallot and fry in olive oil until they are golden brown rings.  When the tuna is done, sprinkle the fried shallots over the tuna slices. It not only makes it look really good but it tastes fantastic and gives it a different and very delicious texture!  Also, for those who do not think Olive Oil makes a difference....It Does!  Do not skimp on olive oil on this recipe! It gives it such an amazing flavor, even if you use a ugh, George Foreman.  Also, know your butcher! Don't just sear Tuna from some place like a Super Target or Costco! BAD IDEA! Get the tuna where it is fresh or  they fly it in fresh! Freshness makes all the difference with this!!!

My tuna was "previously frozen".... so - I thought it came out poorly.  I had to cook it much more than the 30 second searing - that did not even make it luke warm inside.  After cooking it more so it was very rare - the taste was just not there for me.

This turned out perfectly.  A note on the amount of the sauce - I only made 2 tuna steaks and the amount of the sauce was perfect so I would double it for 4 steaks.  Also, did not need 1/2 cup sesame seeds - I used about a tablespoon per steak (half on each side). Thanks for sharing, will definitely make this again!

I made this using gluten free soy sauce, wine white, agave nectar instead of honey and added a teaspoon of garlic paste.  It was awesome - my husband the fisherman thought it was heavenly!  Thanks so much!

AMAZING! I made it exactly as the recipe said...well almost.  I didnt use the olive oil.  I used cooking spray and an electric grill.  Came out amazing. This is a keeper! I paired it with Asian Coleslaw and grilled asparagus.

Hubby adored this...but I had to put mine back into the skillet to cook through.  I've got a very adventurous palate and I know everyone else loves this dish...but I couldn't handle the rare part.  Everything else was fabulous after I cooked mine.

Very good.  I did not have the mirin so I omitted it.  I also added some hot chili oil to marinade instead of using the wasabi since I did not have any. Very tasty and easy recipe.  Thank you.

This was really good, but I felt like the sesame oil was just a little too overpowering.  I think next time I'll try it making it with half of the sesame oil and hopefully that improves it.

Wow!! So delicious! Will definitely make again. Highly recommend going very rare, very high heat, maybe 30 second a side just for color n carmelization. Also, let steaks get at room temp. So they aren't cold in center like other viewers have mentioned! Everyone loved this! Thanks for a great recipe :)

This was an excellent recipe! I recommend using a shallow plate to "dunk" the tuna in the marinade. I also used toasted sesame seeds and they seemed to stick to the tuna better. 
I served this dish with birds nests from Trader Joe's. Excellent recipe!

The flavor was amazing and I loved the dipping sauce.  I had a little problem with burning the sesame seeds but I'm new to searing tuna, so it was probably my fault.  We had a leftover steak that we sliced up and used the next day for little sandwiches with wasabi mayo, and that turned out great too.

My husband bought salmon instead of tuna and I didn't have any mirin, so I just used red wine.  I wanted the fish cooked more, and as a result ended up scorching the sesame seeds.  It was still incredible.  Definitely use the wasabi.  It complements the fish perfectly.  Next time, I'll not heat the oil so high so that the sesame seeds don't scorch.  But there will definitely be a next time.  So simple, yet very gourmet tasting and makes for a beautiful presentation as well.

We didn't have the japanese wine, but I used 1/2 the servings b/c I was making it for 2 people.  The wasabi paste served with it really sets this dish apart.  I served it with brown rice and a salad.  I'm hungry for it now!  Very very good.  I'll be making this again soon!

Wow - this was soooooo good - better than we've had in a restaurant.  We used a mixture of black and white sesame seeds to coat and pan fried in sesame oil rather that olive. (1 minute on each side) PERFECT.  Skipped the wasibi - the dipping sauce was perfect by itself - definately *****!

If I could give this six, seven or more stars I would!  Simply divine.  We loved the marinade and we seared the tuna for 30 seconds as directed - perfection!  If you have problems with rare tuna please please try it!  It really is delicious!

Will make again and again!

Didn’t have mirin so I substituted sake along with an extra ½ tablespoon of honey. It turned out perfectly!

I didn't waste time trying to find a sweet wine.  I used some Merlot.  It was perfect!  Followed the directions except I marinated the tuna steaks for 2 hours!   Fabulous!

Great flavor, fast and simple.  I always eat tuna with wasabi, and sadly didn't have any on hand when I sat down to this dish last night - but the sauce was perfect, and I didn't miss the wasabi at all.  This would also be GREAT as an appetizer at an elegant party.

This was both incredibly good and incredibly easy. It makes a great work night meal that can be ready in just a few minutes.  I double the sauce recipe and have used it with other types of fish too. It would probably make a good base for chicken too (well done of course). Thanks for the great recipe!

Good, but I felt like it was missing something.  Maybe it needed to marinade some, but I couldn't taste the sauce on the tuna at all.  Also, my cuts were pretty thick, at 30 seconds on each side the middle would have still been cold.  I like rare tuna, but it needs to be warm!

Wow... delicious!  I made changes because I didn't have all the ingredients, but my biggest change was that I COOKED THE TUNA THROUGH.  My husband likes his fish fully-cooked, so having red meat in the middle wasn't an option.  First, I didn't have any mirin, or rice vinegar, so I followed the recipe with just the soy, honey and sesame oil.  I kept 1/2 for the sauce and it was tasty.  I let the fish sit in the sauce for 15 min. or so, and then seared it on both sides for a few minutes.  Then I covered the pan to let it cook through.  I took out the fish and added the sesame seeds to the pan, to toast them.  Once they were toasted, I pressed them onto the tuna.  I drizzled the reserved sauce over it and served it with white rice and tomatoes in Olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  It was great!

I was never able to get ahi tuna cooked right.  My husband was a little worried when I announced that I was trying to prepare tuna again.  This recipe just hitted the spot!  My husband loved it.  I will do this many more times again.  I used the frozen steaks from Costco and cooked them on a non-stick pan and it worked like magic.  Great recipe!

I'm rating this on what my dinner guest thought and not me. I didn't particularly enjoy the recipe, but he thought it was excellent and ate my portion, so I guess it was a hit for a serious tuna lover!

This was absolutely delicious. The dipping sauce was phenomenal. This was the first time I made seared tuna and now...it'll be on our dinner list each week. The only problem I had was the smoke from the oil but I think that was my fault not the recipe's.

Easy. Very tasty. I had wasabi powder and added it to the dipping sauce. I also toasted the sesame seeds and added them on top of the tuna after searing. I seared for one minute on each side and it was perfect for my taste. I will definitely make this again.

So delicious! I used Fiery Sesame Oil (it has chili powder in it) instead of regular because I love spicy tuna. I didn't use mirin, but I followed the rest of the recipe. I can't wait to have it again.

I also let the steaks marinate in the sauce before cooking.  Doubled the sauce too.  We prefer ours very rare, so about 20 seconds per side on High was good enough.  Hubby said it is his new favorite meal and it was better than Filet Mignon!

sauce was delicious...if you cannot find mirin, you can also substitute japanese plum wine, also, i would use more honey and mirin in the recipe and slightly increase the cooking time of the tune if you have thick tuna steaks

Oh my goodness - this was sooooo good.  I had something like this at Bailey's in Key West last year, and I'm so glad to have found this recipe.

Amazing.  I've made this so many times, and it's always a hit.  I never have bothered with mirin, just used sherri as I've got it on hand.

I followed the recipe pretty much just as written, though I seared the tuna about 60 seconds on each side, to medium rare.  The flavour was wonderful and the steaks were moist and delicious.  Served with a fresh green salad and some couscous, it was a hit.  I'll certainly be making this again.

My husband and friend were so impressed that I made seared ahi.  Thank you for the recipe.  I used black and regular seasame seeds as another reviewer mentioned and it looked just like what I get at fancy restaurants!  I can't wait to make this again.

This was excellent and so easy! The sesame seeds formed a nice crust, and the rare tuna was velvety and juicy. I followed the recipe exactly--the only thing I'd change is I'd serve it with pickled ginger.

No need to alter this recipe because it is perfect as is!  The key is to not over sear it.  I sear only about 30-45 seconds each side and it is perfect.  My wife insists that it be served with Japanese-style sesame green beans also found on Allrecipes. BRAVO!

This is awesome - easy, quick, and restaurant quality.  My husband raved about it.  I did add   just a bit of minced fresh ginger because  I love ginger. I buy the tuna at Walmart when it's on sale and ask  for the frozen packages so it will be fresh when I want it. It thaws quickly - this is what I cook when I have NO time.

I doubled the sauce & I used a non-stick skillet instead of iron because my iron skillet is a grill pan & I didn't think that would be effective in this recipe. I did cook mine for a little over a minute on each side. I had a couple of outer pieces that were overdone but the center was just perfect at MR. Better IMO to have some overdone outer pieces than to have to look at a really rare center. It just grosses me out, sorry. But bear in mind, that I usually eat my meat MED to MW so this was a big stretch for me. I really liked the dipping sauce but it might have had just a hair to much rice vinegar for my tastes.  It was very flavorful, healthy & I will make again. I served this w/ Corn & Zuchinni Meloday (from this site) & although that was a wonderful side dish, I don't think it was the right side for this. I wish I had made some coconut rice w/ mangoes & some pan-fried asparagus instead. But it's sometimes hard to pick a side for a dish you haven't tasted...hindsight is 20/20. Right after the meal, I served Tropical Mango Mousse (also from this site) for dessert & it was the perfect finish

Since finding this recipe, we have made it several times.  Absolutely the best tuna ever!  We liked it exactly as written, but added wasabi paste to dipping sauce and sliced ginger on the side, which made it even better.

I seared 1min on each side, it was too long, I should have followed the directions and only cooked for 30seconds.  I didn't like the taste of the sesame oil- it was too heavy, next time I will use light olive oil.

This recipe was amazing!  I added wasabi paste to the marinade for a little kick and poured some reserved sauce over the fish before serving.  I didn't have an iron skillet, but it didn't matter.  My husband and I fought over the leftovers the next day!  Thanks!

This recipe was so delicious! I followed the ingredients and measurements exactly and it turned out great. I didn't have an iron skillet, but I don't think it mattered. It was so easy and took hardly any time at all, just 15 minutes, because of the chopping.  Highly recommended for anyone who likes sushi or sashimi!  Thanks for the recipe!!!

My wife wanted to take me to a fancy restaurant for Father's Day. I checked the menu and really didn't like anything on their menu. She then asked where I wanted to go and instead of another restaurant I sent her this recipe.

She made it and it turned out incredible. She used the recipe here exactly (except for the fish monger gave her much bigger steaks). Served on a bed of unflavored ramen.

Absolutely fabulous.

I'm in the middle of nowhere on a Philippine island and have access to the freshest tuna on earth! Slowly got the Internet to bring up this recipe. I brought a few ingredients with me but just have sesame oil, seeds, olive oil and soy. This is the best tuna I've tasted.  Highly recommend. Now to make tuna Kinilaw!

I have to agree with most other reviewers that found this
recipe extremely easy and quite delicious!  I would even venture to say that 
I enjoyed this home made Sesame Seared Tuna more than most restaurants I have eaten it at. Since I did not have sesame oil, I omitted it but added a little more honey as another reviewer suggested and also immediately turned down the high flame after putting the tuna in the cast iron pot.

This was okay. Maybe my fish wasn't high enough quality?  This just didn't have much of a punch to it.

We have made it at least 3 times and absolutely love it as is.  We have to be careful to get the tuna seared correctly, but getting better each ti me!

Amazing!!!  I did not have a cast iron skillet so I just used a regular skillet (still amazing).  Since then I have purchased a cast iron skillet JUST for the seared tuna!

The sesame seed coating is a great idea.  The dipping sauce has too much sesame oil.  In fact, I would cut out the sesame oil altogether and substitute ground sesame seeds instead.

Wonderfully delicious! I actually combine black sesame seeds with regular sesame seeds and it creates a beautiful presentation. Based on other reviewers, I coat the fish with seeds after I remove it from pan. 
SAUCE is AWESOME! Sesame oil - love it! It really adds a great taste to the sauce. Thanks for sharing!

Great Recipe! 
My husband and I LOVE seafood, and this was SO much easier on out wallet! not to mention quick!
I did have to alter it a bit though...
I used chili oil instead of the sesame oil, same thing but spicy. Masala wine b/c I figured any sweet wine will have to suffice. Teriyaki sauce from trader joe's instead of the honey, because it just felt right (and I didn't have honey). I added garlic to the mixture that coated the fish.

I made this with black and regular sesame seeds and served it with teriyaki rice and a spinach salad. I cooked it a little too long, I'll leave it more rare next time. It was wonderful! I will make it once a month!

Fantastic - both hubby and kid loved it! Definitely getting quality ahi is key. I didn't have mirin, and used agave nectar instead of honey; also added a tablespoon of Moonstone's Coconut Lemongrass Sake to the dipping sauce. Yum! I marinated for 30 min. each side, and ground black sesame seeds over it after cooking. Garnished with fresh grated daikon radish and sliced green onions. Was requested to "do this meal again!". (Served chirashi sushi with it, and steamed spinach w/soy sauce.)

This was wonderful.  Took the advice of toasting the sesame seeds on the stove top and sprinkling them on the cooked Tuna.  This worked and tasted great and looked very nice.  I added ginger to the marinade sauce and also added plenty of wasabli paste to the sauce/marinade.  Very tasty!

I've made this twice and it turns out fantastic each time. Don't be afraid to remove the tuna from the pan at 30 seconds, it will not be raw! Also, I like to mess around with the amount of honey, soy sauce, rice wine and sesame oil to taste. What I did was make the sauce and marinate the tuna in it for an hour or so before cooking it, and then I had a spare bowl of the sauce to pour over the tuna after it was sliced followed by sesame seeds, finally I chill it for a few hours in the fridge. Comes out cold, soft and sweet!

Very good restaurant quality tuna, dish. Definately observe the short cook time. The first time I coked for over a minute and it was too done, second time 30 seconds on each side and guests thought it was some of the best tuna ever. Will definately make gain especially since tuna is my wife's favorite!

Made it exactly as the recipe calls for, and it was great!!  And that's saying a lot for someone who hasn't cooked fish much.  The only change I would make is putting the sesame seeds on afterwards as they got a little burnt.

so i used it as a marinade and dipping sauce.  i used only 1T of sesame oil as i know it can be a wee bit overpowering. also, i used splenda brown sugar and no wasabi. oh, and i didn't have mirin so i used a white meritage. and i sprinkled with sesame seeds after cooking. the flavor was super yummy but lacking the oomph that the wasabi would provide.  i'll definitely prepare again with ingredients as outlined b/c i know the flavors will work perfectly.

this recipe was very delicious, didn't use the sesame seeds like the other users suggested and it turned out great. i seared the tuna first and then added a little bit of the sauce just for flavor to the pan, then served it along with the tuna on the side as well.

No need for any changes to this recipe. I purchased sushi grade tuna (well worth the extra cash)and seared it for about 45 seconds on each side! It was some of the most delicious tuna we have ever had!!

One of our favorite recipes! I make it all the time, my husband compares all restaurant Tuna's to this recipe. We actually just had it for dinner tonight. I too add more honey to make it a tough sweeter and just use regular sesame seeds.

Excellent flavors! SUPER quick and easy! I was impressed! Tips are starred below. This was my first time preparing ahi tuna--and this recipe was fabulous! Like others, I purchased the tuna from CostCo. I did not have mirin--did not use any substitutes and it turned out just fine! **Canola oil even smoked with the high-heat: wouldn't recommend using olive oil. **Sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds after cooking, per others suggestions. Glad I did! **Sliced the tuna in half horizontally because the slices were SO thick. Served it with rice and steamed spinach & garlic. Enjoy!

Loved the flavour of the sauce. Next time I will definitely slice my tuna steaks to be more like a 1/2" thick. Mine were closer to an inch and were still cool on the inside. I did bring the tuna to room temp before cooking but I think the steaks were just too thick. Served with a garlic spinach saute. Yum!!

This was wonderful!  I ended up with no leftovers because I kept picking at the piece I'd planned to put away.  I'm a sushi-lover, which is probably why I liked this dish so much.  The tuna will definitely still be red if cooked 30 seconds on each side, and any longer will char the sesame seeds.  Also, I used Japanese plum wine as I couldn't find mirin.

I had a difficult time searing the tuna without either burning the outside or having the middle still be very cold. Also, the marinade didn't seem to add a lot of flavor.  Sorry, but I was a little disappointed.

YUM. I got some Ahi tuna, never frozen, from an Oriental market, as well as all the other ingredients.I marinated the tuna for about an hour then used toasted sesame seeds. I cooked it in an already hot skillet (not smoking hot, the seeds will burn) for about 3 minutes on each side, sliced it up and served it rare with sauteed spinach, garlic and leeks. And sake. It's impressive enough for company and plates beautifully. Gotta use ahi grade tuna for this one.

This recipe is excellent!! I basted the finished steaks with more of the sauce before I served it.  We have made this 3 times in the last couple of months.

didn't have the sweet wine so just put a little sugar in the mix. cast iron skillet was WAY too hot for this IMO. the seeds burnt up in not time flat. scrapped them off and put it onthe grill to let it cook through. will probably make again using the mix as a marinade and cook the tuna through.

Really tasty! I forgot the vinegar in the sauce that went with the tuna, and it still came out excellent. I also didn't have any sesame seeds, so made a simpler version.

Delicious!!! I made this according to recipe (for the most part), doubled the sauce amount and left out the sesame seeds.  I did use them the first time around trying this recipe but they didn't add much and it ended up getting a bit messy, as another poster mentioned.  Served over wild brown rice, which was perfect for soaking up the sauce that I drizzled on just before serving (with some left over for dipping too).

I have used this recipe three times and it is great! I could not find the Japanese wine, but I substituted a sweet Spanish wine that worked well. I served the tuna on top of some mixed green lettuce leaves which added color and texture. I have trouble remembering to separate the sauces before adding the vinegar. New Orleans Giglet is my newest hero!

Hubby loved this recipe. He ate his and half of mine. I think I didn't care for it as much because it had cooled off too much before I ate it. I probably would have liked it better if it was warmer. (My fault, had to take a picture of it first.)I didn't have any mirin used sake instead. Also used red wine vinegar instead of rice wine vinegar (I was out). I seared these on a very hot BQQ grill for about 45 seconds on each side. I think next time I will only cook them 30 seconds on each side.

WOW!!! Amazing recipe!!This was my first time searing tuna so I was reluctant to try adding the sesame seeds for fear that I would burn them. Boy, I wish I would have. I think they would have added an excellent crunchy "crust" that would compliment the velvety texture of the tuna. I will make this again and try adding the sesame seeds after cooking as one person suggested. This is definitely a recipe to make when you want to impress guests. The dipping sauce was amazing and the wasabi gives it a wonderful kick. 
Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

Wonderful and easy to do. I used less sesame oil since it can be overpowering and less honey, which I may eliminate entirely the next time.  But this is a keeper.

Awesome!  I would give this one 10 stars+++  I bought two small fresh tuna steaks for ten bucks from my local fish market but it was so worth it!  DO NOT use frozen.  When eating these steaks, they're practically raw, so make sure that they're bought and eaten the same day.  Also wasabi is a must...adds a much needed kick

A very good and simple recipe. 30 seconds was too rare for me. If you like your tuna slightly rare, add another minute or so to the cook time. Also, the sesame seeds scortch easily, so have some good ventilation.

Simple, easy, tasty.  There isn't anything difficult about searing tuna, there is some trickery involved in making an awesome dipping sauce and this recipe gets it right.  We also added a bit of wasabi to the mix to give it a bit more bite.  If I had fresh ginger I'd have added just a bit also.

Quick and easy prep and cook time, but flavor was not what I expected.  Was hoping for more pizazz.

The dipping sauce in this recipe is to die for!  Absolutely fantastic.  Very good tuna recipe, too.  Quick and healthy.  Make sure the tuna is seared in a very hot pan and is served rare inside.  Delish!

I have tried this with both the fresh tuna and chicken. If you use either, it is excellent! I didn't make any changes in the recipe, it is great the way it is.

We made this last night along with the Japanese salad dressing, and this meal was faboulous - 30 seconds on each side nicely seared the tuna (make sure your can is very hot).  The sauce was great, however, I added a little more soy sauce to the mix.  Great meal!

Flavor-wise this was great so I'm giving it 5 stars for great taste.  But I have a tip both for myself when I make this again, which I will do, and for anyone else. 

Next time instead of putting the sesame seeds on wax paper, I will put them on plastic wrap in a thin layer about the size of the tuna steaks. Then I'll sprinkle sesame on the top and put more plastic wrap over the tuna, and press down.

When I tried doing this as I would bread a chicken cutlet, I got sesame sees all over my hands and they didn't stick as well as I'd like to the fish. 

Maybe other poeple suggested this - but I didn't read the other reviews... bad me.

I made this as per the directions and it was very good!  I did use frozen tuna steaks but will wait for fresh tuna next time. I used the extra marinade as salad dressing (added lime and ginger) and served it sliced over salad with diced mango and avocado.  Simply divine.

I made this on the stove with a regular skillet because we were out of propane. I cooked seared them for 1.5 minutes on each side and had a nice cool center in each one. Great flavor. Careful not to burn it.

It's all about the freshest tuna but if you have that, this recipe is the best I've tasted in a long time. The marinade/sauce is excellent and I wouldn't change anything. I like Poke so searing for about 1 to 1.5 minutes each side is ample. This is an appetizer or salad topper for me, it's such a fresh dish I find starch takes away from it.

I have made this recipe twice now.  I was so easy and delicious!  I followed the recipe pretty close.  I read some other reviews and toasted the seeds first.   I also, doubled the dipping sauce.  I would have had enough, although I like to have extra.   the Tuna was delicious. I did cook it for 45 seconds each side as I had 11/2 inch thick steaks.    Definately a keeper.  
Thanks, neworleansgiglet

I didn’t have the Mirin, so I added extra honey, but otherwise followed the recipe.  It was a bit too vinegary, so I added more honey. I didn’t use it as a dipping sauce & instead marinated the tuna in it , then cooked it & threw the marinade/sauce away. Also, I used low salt soy sauce, Coconut Aminos, which is delish! 

We liked the cooked version, but not the uncooked one. Maybe next time I’ll cook the sauce & it will mix better.

I had never made anything like this but had it at a restaurant and used this recipe to try to recreate it. It was awesome! The only changes I made were to use white wine instead of mirin since I couldn't find it at our store, and I toasted the sesame seeds first and then pressed the seared ahi into the seeds just after cooking. Served with wasabi mashed potatoes and crunchy slaw with a quick vinaigrette. 
Just a note on quality, we tried this with frozen ahi as we didn't think we'd nail it on the first go and didn't want to waste a piece of nice fish. We made the sauce (no vinegar) and marinated our thawed fish at room temp for 2 hours.  We created another batch of the sauce, this time with vinegar, to use with the actual meal for dipping. We will be making this again with a bit better fish quality. The frozen tasted great, but the consistency could have been better.

We followed the recipe for the marinade exactly but skipped the sesame seed coating and grilled over high heat to sear.  So much flavor without overwhelming the tuna.

My first time.  I had frozen 5 ounce albacore section  and defrosted it.  Made it for an appetizer.  It was easy and tasted exactly like I hoped.  The dipping sauce was perfect.

Turned out absolutely phenomenal! I used the Soy sauce, Sesame Oil, lemon juice and wasabi for the Ponzu marinade. Dip the steak in 5he sauce for a few seconds and roll in the seeds. Completely covering the steak. Medium high heat pan until slightly toasted and then switch sides.

It was delicious! my tuna was about 1-3/4" thick so I cooked for about a minute and a half per side. Served it with stir fried green cabbage, green pepper, broccoli, and mushrooms.

I used sherry with a tiny bit of stevia for the mirin.  I did not use any sesame seeds, and we didn't miss them.   I will make it again the same way.  It was great!

Dipping sauce had unpleasant flavor, perhaps the vinegar came through too strong. Followed one person recommendation to marinate in soy sauce instead of "a quick dip" and that was a mistake. Will not make again.

This was a delicious dish. I did make some tweaks to it: I didn't have any wasabe paste. I didn't have any rice wine vinegar and used distilled white  vinegar instead. It tasted fine. I wished I've used more sesame seeds, since I didn't know where to press it into the fish to coat it. I would make again for sure.

This may be the best thing I’ve ever made. Cudos!  Caution! It says high heat in the skillet. 30 seconds is at the edge of burning not roasting the sesame seeds. Next time med high heat. Turn on the exhaust fan, my smoke alarm went off.

This is a very easy and delicious recipe. We used the grill as it’s summer. The tuna steaks definitely have to cook longer than a 30second searing. Hubby did a 45 second searing and it still could have been a whole minute. We do like raw tuna so it was delicious for us. But for those who don’t like tuna to be so raw it needs to cook a bit longer than this recipe suggests.

Really good - but for a little more pizazz - mix coarse ground black pepper with sesame seeds - 1/3 ground pepper - be sure it is coarse ground - and 2/3 sesame seeds.  Otherwise - great.

Great, easy recipe but excellent. Just a bit messy with Sesame seeds popping with the high cast iron skillet temp. Use a screen for easier clean up.

I would add only one step to the technique: use tongs to sear the sides, too. It takes only seconds, makes it look better, and keeps you from overcooking the tuna, i.e., keeping the tuna flat in the pan too long so that the sides look better.

This was absolutely fantastic!  Wish I would have taken a photo but You should have seen how fast we devored them,,,,should have made more!  The flavor rocked!  The only thing I did differently since I was doing this inside and didn't want to smoke up the house was to coat the tuna with the toasted sesame seeds & sprinkle with thinly sliced green onions after I seared the steaks.  Served with steamed rice, an Asian chop salad, wasabi, and pickled ginger.  Oh and don't forget the dipping sauce,,,mmmmm!  Makes me want to go get more tuna and have it for dinner again tonight!  Definitely a keeper!

I found this really good. I read the reviews prior to making. From the suggestions, I added the toasted sesame seeds after cooking as well as just the 1 Tbl of sesame oil after tasting the sauce and deciding it was good. I seared on medium heat for about a minute or so each side. I may add some chilies and half of the honey next time for a change. Thanks for sharing!

Never cooking tuna steaks before, I was quite leery of cooking it rare, but I threw all caution to the wind after reading reviews everywhere that this is the ONLY way to have tuna steaks.  Wow, I'm so glad I did!  The kids and I all loved it.  The only change I would make is to toast only 1/4 cup sesame seeds, as 1/2 cup was too many.  I had also toasted separately from searing as other reviewers had suggested.  I'll be making this again today for my husband to try.  Thanks for the recipe!

It was extremely delicious! I went with frozen ahi from Costco and cut them 1/2-3/4 inches thick each to ensure that the insides would get cooked too without burning the outsides. Then instead of cooking them with the sesame seeds, I toasted the sesame seeds separately.  I also only cooked about 1/4 cup of sesame seeds and it was still more than enough. When heating the skillet, I first preheated the cast iron skillet on very high, then went to medium. I seared each side around 40 seconds each for medium rare (which is the best and had the most texture in my opinion), and about 55 seconds for well done. It was only after cooking the fish that I layered on the sesame seeds that gave it a wonderful crunchy texture!

This was so good! Even though my tuna was purchased frozen from Sam's Club, it was great. I have made this twice already. I toasted the sesame seeds and added them when I was done searing the steaks, but other than that followed the recipe exactly.

If I could give it more starts, I would.
I followed the recipe to a tee.   I used fresh, good quality tuna.  I took it out of the fridge for 10-15 minutes prior to cooking.  I seared each side for 90 seconds.
The taste was out of this world and the texture was like a rare steak.
My husband was hesitant to try, but he rated it a 10/10.  I am so happy with this recipe.  Thank you for sharing.

The recipe was delicious!  I prepared almost exactly as written, but with a bit more "tuxedo" sesame seeds on the outside.  Served on top of wasabi mashed potatoes and it was a restaurant quality meal for a fraction of the price.

This was amazing. It was quick and easy too!
In place of sesame seeds I used Trader Joe's "Everything but the Bagel" Sesame seasoning. I will be making this a lot.

We enjoy Ahi tuna EVERY Friday night and were looking for something a little bit different.  Well, THIS IS IT!  It was extremely flavorful, easy to prepare and definitely satisfied our desire for Ahi!!!!

Delicious!  I had to substitute some white wine for the mirin (didn't have any on hand) and I added a touch of rice wine vinegar to both the cooking sauce and dipping sauce.  Will definitely try with the mirin in the future.  I also chose to marinade the steaks in the sauce for about 30 min.
My husband isn't a fan of rare meats of any kind so I cooked the tuna steaks approx 3 min per side for med-rare.  
Served with some rice noodles and stirfried veggies - they were huge hit!  Thanks for submitting!

We go offshore every year so we always have tuna in the freezer that I am looking for recipes for. This one was excellent. I made it exactly as written except I didn't use a cast iron pan. I used a regular non-stick pan and I didn't go quite as high as medium-high so as not to scorch the sesame seeds. I cooked it rare and it was perfect!

Used Agave Nectar instead of honey,  Moscato instead of Japanese wine and didn't have sesame oil so used evoo in the marinade and grapeseed oil to cook with.  It was good but next time I will wait to add the sesame seeds like a lot of reviews suggested until after searing the tuna bc it was burning and seeds were popping everywhere! Luckily I like somewhat raw tuna.

Made this recipe without any changes, and really liked it.  It's quick and satisfying.  Especially liked the sauce for dipping.  Thought I'd put some green onions in it next time.

Great recipe. We love our sushi-grade tuna rare, but it needs to be seared more than 30 seconds per side. Perhaps 1 minute per side or even longer and at a lower temperature. I used a combo of white and black sesame seeds and one needs to be careful about the popping when you add the fish to the hot pan.

This recipe is pretty good and the dipping sauce is a fantastic pairing. I personally think a crust of sesame seed is a bit much. Did only 1 tbsp sesame oil as others mentioned. Next time I will sprinkle the sesame seeds on the steaks to get a more consistent and lighter coating. Wife absolutely loved it and was impressed by the sear. Definitely keep to a min on each side over med-hi and you are in business!

Easy and fast, the sauce was delicious! We did substitute some dessert wine for the Japenese wine as we didn't have any of that and it was still great.  We did cook our tuna a little longer as it was previously frozen, so we did 2-3 minutes per side. This still maintained a pink center.

Thickly coated the tuna by rolling all sides and pushing firmly, but gently in sesame seeds for restaurant-style seated tuna. We like ours rare so we seared all sides and left center red. Mixed both black & white sesame seeds for presentation. Yummy and seasoning doesn't overpower the taste of tuna.

I made this and it was absolutely amazing! Fast, healthy and so full of flavor.  I  added more honey and skipped on the wine, (used seasoned rice vinegar instead),  it was still a memorable dish that is now a favorite for my family!

I fixed this for the first time this week and it was a big hit! I used low-sodium soy sauce, honey, sesame oil, and ginger (as suggested in another review). I did not have mirin, so I added Balsamic vinegar for the dipping sauce. I also toasted the sesame seeds and used for coating after searing the tuna for about 90 seconds on each side.  I will be making this again!

Followed Ginger C's suggestions and added more honey, toasted the seeds beforehand, and did not put the seeds on until after searing the fish. They stuck fine to the fish and was a lot less messy. I would suggest cleaning and re-oiling the pan between pieces so the next batch does not get too blackened looking.

Taste was amazing! Couldn't find mirin :( Will have to try again with that... Only thing I had trouble with was getting the sesame seeds to stay on the tuna when I flipped it to sear the other side - Any suggestions on this? An otherwise great dish - served with ginger cream from another tuna recipe! Delish!

AMAZING! I didn't have the mirin, but substituted with dry sherry (crossed my fingers while doing it) and it came out delicious! I'm sure with the mirin it'd be even better.

I used half the sesame oil. To make sure it was warm in the middle I seared it off and then left it in the oven on about 350 for a couple of minutes. It came out with nice flavor and not overcooked.

I felt like I was eating at a seafood restaurant when I ate this tuna!  Very good.  I accidentally added the wasabi before reducing the sauce.  It didn't seem to matter.  I served over a bed of Japanese pickled veggies from the garden and a grilled rice cake on the side.  I'll be making this as much as my mercury levels will allow!

Excellent! Easy and delicious! I didn't have the Japanese sweet wine so I added more honey and it was still fantastic. I think I will try grilling it next time. I will also use the dipping sauce for other recipes it was so delicious and easy.

I make this frequently, with a few modifications.  I use hot pepper sesame oil.  I make twice as much dipping sauce, because we like to pour a little on sides of white rice and vegetables.  I also add some green onions to the dipping sauce.

Made this last night with some beautiful ahi.  I followed the recipe exactly on thing I messed up on was adding the rice wine vinegar to the entire dipping sauce.  Oh well it came out fine.  I also doubled the dipping sauce so all four of us could have our own.  Next time I may cut back on the sesame oil just a tad.  Oh and the 30 seconds per side in the cast iron pan was perfect I just had to dust the cob webs off of it before I used it:)

This is the first time I have ever tried to pan sear tuna and it came out great! I got frozen steaks from the store and defrosted them in the microwave. I then let them marinade for an hour before cooking. I used pam instead of the olive oil and omited the mirin. I also added garlic to the sauce. I cooked mine 30 sec on each side and it really did turn out perfect!

Made this recipe as-is. It was good but not great. The fish and or sauce needed more zing. Next time I'll try sprinkling chinese 5 spice on the fish first.

We used an iron skillet like it said....probably won't do that again. Our sesame seeds burned b/c our skillet was too hot :(  All in all though still pretty tasty. I definitely recommend using Mirin. We found a substitute recipe online....not the same. I would also use less sesame oil.....it's WAY TOO oily.

Incredible -- am so proud of the meal I just made -- thanks for the recipe!  I omitted the mirin (tasted great without), and also put the sesame seeds on after searing and added wasami to the dipping sauce as others suggested.  Seared on an indoor grill pan at high heat for 1 1/2 minutes per side -- beautiful grill marks and about medium rare.  Yum!  May add some garlic and fresh grated ginger to sauce next time . . .

Great flavor.  Make sure to mix the marinade super well otherwise the oil seperates.  I also cut down the cook time as the tuna should be very rare!  Will definately make again!

The absolute best sauce and total recipe for tuna ever.  Wouldn't change a thing.  The only thing we did was to add a small amount of the wasabi paste to the sauce mixture. Start small and increase according to your palate.  A complete winner.  My husband cooked our tuna steak in a cast iron skillet on the grill, about 2 minutes each side for a 1-1/4 inch steak for medium rare.  Perfect.  Thanks bunches.

I was soooooo disappointed!  After reading the reviews I had myself all psyched up for this dish.  But neither my husband or myself cared for it.  At all. We thought the sesame flavor was overpowering and the smoke in the house from the preparation was very unappetizing.  Darn -- I really wanted to like this one!

Made this last night, was very good, didn't have the fancy wines but used a dash of cooking wine, tasted good Best tip would be to melt 1 tsp of corn starch into the sauce and stir it in a hot skillet for a minute or two until it's thick.  Thick sauce made for richer flavor! Ate it layered with sliced avocado and sauce drizzled on top!  Yum!  My kids even liked it! (cooked theirs a little longer)

Outstanding, very similar to what i've been served in high-end restaurants.  My wife and kids like it as well.  In fact, i've yet to serve this to anyone who didn't like it.  If you enjoy a high quality steak, you'll likely savor this recipe.

Can only give 5 stars but should be 10!! Wife ridiculed me for buying a Tuna steak, once she tried it she was singing praise. Very good, I went simple and only used soy and sesame for more of a semi-cooked sushi outcome (plenty of wasabi too!!) Kind of a cross between a med-rare Filet Mignon and Sushi.

WOW!  this is a MUST dish to try!  So fast and soooo yummy!  Do make sure to cook the tuna for ONLY 1 minute on each side.  I was a little wooried that they would be too raw and cooked them for about 90 seconds on each side. Still came out awesome although I will be more confident and use the directed cook time.

Delicious and easy!  I did as others suggested and marinated in the sauce for a little while.  I also cooked 3 minutes each side over medium heat.  I made sure to use high-quality tuna - I don't know how I'd feel about using supermarket tuna on this one.

Absolutely delicious !
I have also marinated the tuna in the sauce for a couple of hours before searing and the flavors really show.
I made this as a first course for a dinner party once and used both toasted sesame seeds and black sesame seeds( both found in Asian isle )to coat. Served with Asian style cole slaw
It turned out so elegant !

This was very good - not as good as what you'd get in a restaurant, but perhaps that is because I'm not as good a chef as they are, or maybe my tuna wasn't quite sushi grade.  I really enjoyed the flavor though and will definately make this again.

I didn't have mirin on hand and used a little bit more honey instead.  I also didn't put the sesame seeds on until the end and turned down the heat while searing the tuna.  It turned out fabulous!

I don't give many recipes 5 stars, but this one is truly amazing.  Stayed true to the recipe, used sushi-grade tuna and kept it very rare.  I gave my kids the dipping sauce without the wasabi and it was good - but mix some wasabi into the sauce and it is as good or better than quality restaurants.  Thanks for the recipe!

The tuna was very good...but with the dipping sauce it is out of this world! I could see using the sauce for chicken or pork also.  Yummy and healthy!

This was very yummy.  I used all the ingredients and it had a nice flavor on the tuna... grilled instead of stove-top but that helpedd the sesame seeds form a nice crust without burning.

I thought this was pretty good.  I dont like my tuna raw in the middle, so I cooked mine for a minute on each side, but I did my DH's rare in the middle and he LOVED it.  He is definatly the raw or seared tuna conniseur so I trust him when he says this was melt-in-your-mouth wonderful! Next time I make this, I will probably cut the sesame oil down to 1 Tbsp as I thought it really overpowered the sauce.  Also, I based on other reviews, I decided to toast the sesame seeds then sprinkle them on after the tuna was seared.  It was very good that way, but I felt like with the toasted seeds and all the sesame oil in the sauce, it was a big taste of sesame for sure.

I made this for my husband last night because he loves ahi tuna. He thought it was great. I thought it was just okay, but I'm not a huge fan of tuna. I had 1" tuna steaks that I cut in half to make them 1/2". If yours are 1/2" only sear them for 30 seconds on each side. We did 45 and they were a little too done.

This is great! The only thing I changed was using sweet vermouth (that I had on hand) instead of mirin and since I don't own a cast iron pan, I used a stanless steel skillet which worked perfect. The tuna is very rare, but just melts in your mouth. I'll make this again!

We were using a pretty thick piece of tuna from Costco.  The first time we made it it was just too raw (which is odd since we like sushi).  The next time we had it I cooked it at a lower temp for about 3 minutes per side which was still med rare.  It was perfect.  We liked the dipping sauce too with a little wasabi on the side.  Yummy.

Wow!  This is awesome.  Restaurant quality meal that is so easy to prepare.  The only thing I changed was the mirin.  I didn't have any so I added a little bit of sweet white wine that I had.  I served it with sushi rice and a wasabi/ginger mayo.  This is a definite keeper and is sure to be a dinner party meal.

You can't go wrong w/ seared ahi, but this recipe didn't dissapoint. Make sure you get sashimi grade ahi, as fresh as possible. I didn't have rice wine vinegar, so I used white wine vinegar, and it turned out fine. I recommend you use less sesame seeds and hot mustard works as a good dipping sauce too. If you have a smaller skillet, cook the pieces one at a time, I tried to throw them all in a once and the outer pieces didn't cook entirely even. Like I said before though, you can't go wrong w/ Ahi, unless you cook it through.

Yum!  My boyfriend hates seared tuna, so I made this for myself one night while he was out of town.  It's an easy recipe to scale down, and I'm so glad I made this!  For a side, I made Jamie's Cranberry Spinach Salad from this site (which I HIGHLY recommend).  Dinner took about 10 minutes in all, and it was one of the best meals I've had in a while.  The only thing is, I felt guilty about wolfing down a $15 tuna steak in so little time.  What can I say?  I couldn't help it; it was too good.

My husband really enjoys rare tuna so his was perfect.  I prefer more medium tuna and found the seeds to be burned.  The sauce was amazing and the fish was great otherwise.

This is quick and easy and it taste great.  I think it's better if you toast the sesame seeds first.  We served it with rice, seaweed salad and steamed veggies.  Everyone cleaned their plate.

This was very good.  I think it could have soaked in the sauce a little more.  I also used light soy sauce, which did not add quite enough soy flavor.  Still, it was quite tasty.  I cooked it closer to one minute to get it medium rare (it looked a little too rare the first time).  This one is definitely a keeper!

This recipe was awesome!  I didn't use all of the oils, and it still was a great dipping sauce.  We cooked the tuna for a bit longer than 30 seconds on each side and it tasted great!

Great sauce! I used very Fresh Ahi Tuna ($21.00 per Pd. We like our tuna rare and only cooked on very hot for 30 seconds each side in a flat skillet. I didn't have a iron skillet handy. I will do this again but will shop somewhere else for my tuna. You can't go wrong with this recipe if you follow here directions exaclty. Next time I'm trying it blackened. Yum.

I used my George Foreman grill for this so I didn't need the olive oil. Also used regular wine instead of mirin. I loved the sauce but the sesame oil was a little overpowering. I might use half of it next time or even use olive oil instead. The sauce was great on my rice as well. Also cooking it for 30 seconds on each side didn't do much except for brown the seeds. It was cold and red more like sushi. I happen to like it that way but I don't think most of the people that I would invite over for dinner would feel the same.

My fisherman caught a big tuna in Gulf recently.  We needed recipes for tuna steaks & this one was fabulous.  Thanks.

This was a great recipe. I will definately show this one off, very restaurant like. I used the remaining marinade right away by coating the prepared tuna with it before serving (as opposed to using it as a dipping sauce). And I think I would mix in VERY LITTLE wasabi into it next time to add some spice.  Also, 30 seconds barely sears the tuna, 5 minutes each side would still leave the tuna rare without being totally raw inside.
