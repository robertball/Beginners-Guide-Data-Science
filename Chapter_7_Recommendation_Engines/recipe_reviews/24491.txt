I think this is a good base recipe. I'm allergic to coconut so I didn't use the coconut rum. I used 1 ounce Bermuda Gold Rum, 1 ounce Capt Morgan Rum, 1/2 ounce Brandy, 3 ounces orange juice & 3 ounces of pineapple juice, then I added a splash of cherry syrup from the jar of cherries and garnish with cherries and pineapple slice. It reminded me of the Mai Tai's I had in Hawaii!

I used a passion fruit rum instead of regular light rum.  Very good drink.  I find it's helpful to keep those little 6 oz pineapple juices on hand for drinks like this!

I don’t know what the hell this is, but it’s NOT a mai tai! No pineapple, apricot in a mai tai!!!! Only rum, orange curasco, lime juice and almond syrup!
