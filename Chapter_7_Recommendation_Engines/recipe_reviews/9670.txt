This recipe was delicious, though I changed it to be a bit healthier. I made all of the flour whole wheat, changed the shortening to margerine, and the dried cranberries to almonds. Plus I added 1/2 cup of chocolate chips too!

Not really what I was going for, but they tasted pretty good. VERY sweet. It was more like granola cake than granola bars. I certainly don't like boiling the cranberries. sure it softens them up, but I think they lose a lot of flavor.

My 13 year old daughter made this. A little bit crumbly, but very good. Will make again.

These were gone within a day of me making them. I also made some for friends at camp and they were gone as soon as they got them!

I love love love this recipe. I was looking for a good sub. for Dutch Bros bars and found it. I added golden raisins, sunflower seeds and white chocolate. I left out the regualr raisins and walnuts. It only cost me approx. $10 for 3 batches.

These are very good. Not exactly what you think of when thinking of a granola bar, but terrific!

Delicious!!  Agree with others, more like a granola cake but still really great flavor.  I think next time, I might try a larger pan it took a long time for this recipe to cook.  I think in a 9x13 it with cook through better and maybe get a bit more crunchy.  Easy to make and satisfies the sweet tooth.

I really liked the 'cakey' texture. I used dried cherries. The grandkids loved it!

really quite nice! Very cakey but excellent. I used coconut oil bc it was the only thing i had on hand and seemed to work OK. But this is less granola bar and more straight=up cake
