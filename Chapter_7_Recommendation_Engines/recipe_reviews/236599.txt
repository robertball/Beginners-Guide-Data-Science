I loved this recipe, and whats nice is we changed just a few things instead of a trip to the store and it turned  out spectacular!  I used all hot sausage, 1-28 oz. can of diced tomatoes, and white kidney beans. We enjoyed the incredible flavour!  He was right, such a nice change from beef. Chef John won't steer you wrong! Best chili I have ever made.

Awesome! Made a few variations of my own, however. Added 1b of beef with the sausage, a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes instead of puree, 1/2 can tomato paste, 1 4oz can green chiles, 1 glass of red wine, 1/2 tsp of Italian seasoning instead of oregano, 1/2 tsp cayenne, 1/4 tsp coriander and along with the bell peppers I threw in about 8 or 9 chopped baby bella mushrooms as well as 1 can of fava beans with the cannelini. I made this for a superbowl chili cookoff and I placed in the top 5 and my crockpot was empty within an hour! Will definitely do this again, soooo good.

I love this recipe.  It tastes great.  It has a little burn, but not so much that a little sour cream or cheese can't handle.  I would recommend this recipe.  Chef John delivers again.

This is just what is says!  A variation on chili and so worth the try. It is full flavored and a different change of pace from usual chili's.  Adapt seasonings and liquids to your own tastes.  I have this on the stove simmering now and the smell is nothing short of fantastic.  Again, it is Italian Chili. not Texas Chili, not Midwest Chili, nor Southwest.  Each are all different.  That is the best part - this offers you an alternative base and I highly recommended any of Chef John's recipes.  He is well trained and not simply a home cook, but he presents all recipes as easy to follow and just delicious.  Trust me - this smells like it is worth bursting your comfort bubble.  Delish!  And no - true Texas Chili has neither beans nor tomatoes.....

I made this for a party, and it was gone in half an hour! I made a few substitutions, but I think this recipe, with its high sausage/bean ratio, would be hard to ruin. It has a lot of "give." I used turkey sausage (both hot and sweet, as the recipe calls for), an additional can of red kidney beans, and used my own homemade chili powder (which was probably milder). We're making it again this weekend because my son never got any at the party!

This was amazing Chili.  I used one can of canellini beans and 1 can of black beans. I couldn't find chipotle chile powder so I substituted one tablespoon of canned chipotle.  Sprinkled fresh Cilantro on the top with shredded tex mex cheese, avacado and sour cream.  Another HOME RUN for Chef John.

To cut down on the prep time, I saut√©ed the peppers in EVOO until softened, then added a spoonful of minced garlic to the peppers and cooked for an additional minute or so, & finally added the veggies to the sausage mixture. I let it cook for 15 mins instead of 30. No salt needed. This dish is really amazing the next day. WOW!  

I was surprised to see Italian sausage instead of the traditional meat found in chili however this was a great mix of flavors and a hit at my house.  Another winner by Chef John. I am becoming a huge fan of his recipes. Thanks much!!!!

I am usually not a chili fan, but I like this chili.  Way better than the usual ground beef ones.

We really liked this - it does have a bit of a kick but the sour cream and avocado garnish help to tame it.  I made this with Johnsonville All Natural sausage. I didn't have tomato puree so I used a can of diced tomatoes in sauce which worked great.

I made this today and my wife and my neighbor just loved it. I must say it was great will make again. I made a few changes, I used vegetable broth instead of water and used less. I and a half cans De Monte petite diced tomatoes and one can tomato sauce. I used 2 can's of chick peas instead of cannellini beans. It was great !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

When I wanted to make chili  I looked for a recipe by Chef John.  I haven't  cooked very much, but he makes me look like a pro every time!  It is so good.  I didn't change a thing, nor will I next time.  Perfect and spicy just the way it is.  The texture is wonderful.  Fabulous!

It was a hit at a group function with many people asking for the recipe. Only a minor tweak... I used 1 28 oz can of tomato puree and 2 cups of water instead.

I live in Texas and YES your chili should have tomatoes in it. Lots of them. This chili wasn't even red until I added more tomatoes (and lots of hot sauce). Be better with green chilies as well. Not spicy enough. It WAS better the second day though.

Great flavor with just the right amount of heat. I served mine over steamed hot dogs with cheddar on top. I didn't have chipolte chili powder so I used regular and it was great.

We changed this a bit; we had the sweet sausage, but substituted the spicy sausage for regular minced beef and it worked really well.

I didn't follow his recipe to the letter. I used my own variant on it. I made 7 quarts for a pot luck at work. When shift was over. I had 1/4 cup of leavins' in the slow cooker. Considering, most went home with half or more of, what they made for the potluck. I think it went well. Many are telling me; Make That Chili Again!!

My family absolutely loves this!  I like it a little less spicy, so I make it with half the amount of hot Italian sausage, and twice the amount of mild Italian sausage.  That made it just right for all of us to enjoy!  Thanks Chef John!

Wonderful flavor, I used 3 links of Italian Sausage and 1 lb of beef ground meat because I didn't have the 6 links, and a can of tomato sauce not having puree available.  I can't say enough about the taste.....pretty darned easy to make too!

I wanted to make chili all day. It's all I could think about at work. I made chili-mac last week but it just wasn't the same. I knew that I had 3# hot italian sausage in the freezer, so as soon as I got home I googled and found this recipe. I knew I could always trust Chef John so I went for it.
I didn't have the sweet Italian sausage that I thought I had so I just had to wing it with all "hot". Good call. 
Only changes I made other than that: I added 3 T minced garlic  and sauteed with meat, onions and peppers; added 3 tsp. of beef bouillon to the water; subbed 1 tsp. Hickory Salt and 1 tsp. Chipotle Salt for the "salt to taste".
And, most importantly, I used my Electric Pressure Cooker. I did Manual for 5 minutes, Natural Pressure Release for 15 minutes and it was AWESOME!  Tasted like it'd been cooking all day. It's spicy but by the time you add cheese and sour cream it's all good. 
You can also add 3 T of sugar to quiet it down a tad. This is my new Go-To Chili Recipe. Thank you, Chef John!

I get compliments on this all the time!  I can't eat green peppers so I use yellow or orange and they work just as well, just takes away from the Italian colors :(  I also add a couple of teaspoons of cinnamon doesn't seem to do much to the flavor but while cooking it gives off such an aroma I am a huge hit :D

This was great, we all loved it.  I didn't give 5 stars because I did change the recipe a bit.  I used 2 lbs ground mild italian sausage.   I added a can of diced tomatoes and 2 tablespoons of tomato paste in place of the tomato puree.  In addition to the spices, I added a pinch more of each seasoning at the end when I added the peppers .  I did not have the ancho chili powder mentioned, i used plain chili powder with the chipotle powder.
