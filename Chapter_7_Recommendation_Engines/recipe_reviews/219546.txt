1 used 2 large chicken breasts and a bullion cube in water instead of a packet.  This works great over rice.  Will make again.

I was actually quite surprised at how good and flavorful this recipe was.  And it's very healthy.  I didn't have the concentrate broth packets so I just made a very concentrated broth w/ buillion cubes.  I overcooked the chicken but that was my own fault.  I needed to reduce the cooking time due to using boneless skinless chicken that I had butterflied.

Great recipe.
Trader Joe's carries a low sodium chicken broth concentrate that is delicious--more intense, less salty flavor.

Ok, recipe, but not 5 stars.  just ok as far as my family of 6 was concerned.  THe broccoli absorbed too much of the broccoli and my kids who normally scarf it down, barelly touched it.

tasty and easy to make.  I only used one packet of concentrated chicken broth (to cut down on the salt) and as I browned the chicken I sprinkled salt-free Lemon Pepper seasoning on the chicken.

Perfection. I subbed asparagus for the broc & added lemon zest. Then used cornstarch to thicken the sauce. My mouth was happy!

Absolutely love this recipe with a few changes that I gathered from other reviews!  I made a thicker sauce by adding self rising flour, more lemon juice, honey, water and some sugar to calm the strong lemon flavor.  I also seasoned my chicken with lemon pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, garlic salt and rosemary.  Very flavorful and yummy!

I added about a cup of water, so that I'd have some sauce.  Without any extra sauce, this recipe would really be lacking.  Great flavor!

This was very good.  I used chicken thighs.  Also used 3 flavor packets instead of 2 and added some water as I wanted more sauce.  Really enjoyed the sauce over rice! Will make this again.

We found this to be just OK. I used BLSL breasts cut in strips. It was easy enough but just not very flavorful. There are better Lemon Chicken recipes out there. Thanks for the recipe but I'm not likely to make this one again.

Easy to make,  Tastes great.  I sprinkled some garlic & herb seasoning on the chicken when I browned it.  I did not find this dish salty at all like others did.  I also used asparagus instead of broccoli and I put the asparagus in with the chicken and ended up cooking the dish covered on low for 40 minutes.  The chicken was very tender.

I used 2 cups of chicken stock instead of the Swanson packets and used a little more lemon juice (1/3 cup instead of 1/4). Served it over rice. My family loved it! Thank you for sharing this.

Easy, lowfat and tasty main course. We loved the lemony taste of the chicken but next time would cut back on the onions and add mushrooms. Served over pasta

Much the same can be done with using spinach rather than the broccoli, but in either case I de-glazed the pan with some white wine and also added some sautéed  mushrooms to the dish.  Excellent served over brown rice.

I loved this recipe. I will cook the broccoli less next time. I didn't use lemon zest because I did not have an organic lemon. I used chicken breast because that is what I had on hand. The sauce was light and flavorful.

I put my chicken in cold--half frozen in fact--initially.  This made the outside burnt which was a factor in the final dish.  I think I put too much broth in as well.  It wasn't easy figuring this ratio out because I had none of the concentrated broth and had to use buillon.  It seems like the recipe could've taken into account the fact that bouillon is a lot more affordable to most people--or at least given a substitute ratio for the buillon.  By the time this was finished, it was greasy, overcooked, and bitter.  Again I bear a great deal of responsibility for this.  I don't know if I would try this again.  And I really was looking forward to something different.  My husband hated it.  A lot of trouble for nothing.  Sorry.

Quick, easy and healthy! Surprisingly great flavour (I added a bit of lemon pepper but would still be good without). Served this with egg noodles.  I dish supper with few calories and little clean up.  Thanks so much to the submitter!

Maybe I just didn't brown the chicken enough, or maybe it's because I just used thighs, but even after I browned it and poured off the fat, it still felt greasy. 

Because one of the comments said there wasn't enough sauce, I added a little bottle (like, 4 ounces) of white wine after cooking the chicken, to deglaze the pan, to the onions and garlic, and that made more sauce. Also used organic low sodium chicken stock instead of the concentrate. 

Don't think I'll try it again, or if I do, it'll be with chicken breasts instead of thighs.

We really liked the lemon flavor! I made as directed, except I only used 3 chicken breasts. And I didn't add any more olive oil when I sauteed the onions, I just took the chicken breasts out and threw the onions right into the pan.
