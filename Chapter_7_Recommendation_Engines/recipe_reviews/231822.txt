Really good! I normally try and make my meals from scratch, but being short on time yesterday after a busy day of errands, I saw this and it sounded "too good to be true"! This one's a keeper! Super easy to make, few ingredients, tons of flavor! It's the type of meal that tastes like you spent way more time on. The package of chicken tenders I bought had 8 tenders in it. I kept the rest of the ingredients the same. Some of the tenders were too big to stuff into the shells, so I'd trim a little bit off the sides and set the extra bits off to the side. By the time I had stuffed all 8 shells, I had enough extra bits to stuff a 9th shell. Even though I used the full amount of sauce stated in the recipe, next time I will add slightly more water bc by the end of the hour of cooking, the dish was starting to dry out. I would have prefered a little more sauce. I imagine if I would have made the full 14 shells that there would have been an even greater need for more sauce.  I had also used 1.5 tbsp of Montreal Steak Spice instead of 2 bc that seemed like a lot. Next time I might even use just 1 tbsp. Aside from the great flavor, my favorite thing about this recipe is the ease and simplicity. Thanks for the great recipe Jessica! I normally photograph all my recipes, but this one was gobbled up way too fast!

i have made this more then once. And both times it's been a hit with my picky husband and kids! I did not put any of the McCormick on the kids and very little on my husbands as that was their complaint the first time. And both times now our biggest complaint is there isn't enough sauce. So I will make it again many time but I will put the seasoning to liking for everyone and I will definitely double the sauce!

I loved these for the ease. I even put my chicken tenders in partially frozen. I baked for 45 minutes instead of the hour and only added 1 tablespoon of the Montreal seasoning as it seems like a lot. I think I would even go less next time as it really overpowered the overall dish imo.

Fantastic, used left over fried chicken, used roasted garlic alfredo sauce, did not use garlic powder. Followed recipe except for chicken and Alfredo sauce. Great served with steamed broccoli. Had leftovers, which were also very good.This recipe has gold star in our house. My suggestion is that this recipe works with any kind of leftover chicken, you do not need to use fresh or frozen chicken.
