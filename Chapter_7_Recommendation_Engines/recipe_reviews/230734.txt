I did not have gorgonzola cheese, I substituted equal amounts bleu cheese. I used chopped chicken thigh meat (discounted meat sale) added a little more chopped green onion and some fresh ground pepper. I made this last night so it would have time to sit over night. VERY tasty pasta salad. NOTE: I buy my jarred roasted red pepper at the Dollar Tree. Cheap and tastes just as good as the expensive brands!

Very good salad. Everyone loved it at our BBQ. I went by the recipe and it wasn't very buffalo chicken tasting. It was very mild. So I put half into a bowl for my guests who didn't like "hot" food and then in a small bowl I mixed some ranch and buffalo sauce and poured it into the salad and it was amazing! I also decided to then double the ingredients except for the noodles and I liked it much better.

Very simple summer salad, and flavorful!  I added green peas and red onion, used raw red pepper instead of the roasted red peppers, and substituted yogurt for half the mayo ...  but those are small changes ... The recipe would work well as written.  We also ate it before chilling (couldn't wait!).

Great recipe! I did increase the amount of onions and hot sauce as we like our food spicy. Will make again!

I usually like roasted red peppers, but not in this. If I make it again I will dice a fresh red bell pepper. And more cheese!

I accidentally bought gluten free noodles but went ahead anyway. I didn’t have Gorgonzola cheese which would’ve been a positive addition. Score: I found roasted red peppers at the dollar store. I had to add much more of the mayo mixture than the recipe called for. I’d make this again.

I didn't have Gorgonzola cheese so I used shredded cheddar and it was fine. Also I added peas. We liked it.

I will definitely make this again. I used rotisserie chicken and didn't  have the cheese or roasted red pepper on hand so just made due, was delicious!

I made this for my son's graduation party. I followed the recipe using  Datil pepper hot sauce. Everyone LOVED it. My brother-in-law who can't stand pasta salads went back for seconds!  I even doubled the recipe and there were no leftovers. I will be making this often! I did use my hand mixer to shred the chicken. I read that somewhere and it was a major help!
