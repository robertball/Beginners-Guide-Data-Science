Although this is yummy I don't think it is healthy.

Extremely tasty. The boyf (a meat and potatoes guy) chowed down on this and asked for seconds. The only thing I did differently was add some mushrooms (which I add to every savory dish I make) and switch out the swiss cheese for goat cheese (I'm lactose intolerant). But I think even without the changes, this dish would be great.  Oh, and be sure to keep an eye on it once it hits the 45 minute mark in the oven. The bread started getting really dark and I covered it with foil at this time.

TIP: When making a strata, I always place saran wrap over the top and press it down on top of the strata. I will place boxes (ie: brownies, cake mix, etc.) on top to hold the saran wrap down. Place the strata in the fridge overnight. This will keep the pieces of bread from burning, and soaks all the egg into the bread. Love this recipe...turned out golden brown and PERFECT!

This needs more flavor. I would definitely recommend a decent amount of garlic in any form, additional salt & pepper, and parsley...? It was ok, but nothing great. I followed the directions to a T, and after checking it at 40 min., the bread on top was dark and only minutes from burning, so I had to top it with foil. I then had to turn the heat up to 375ยบ to complete the cooking, because it was still wet and runny in the center. I wouldn't make this again, however to those of you who wish to try it, I would suggest an oven temp. at least 350ยบ, and also be sure to foil it for half the baking time. And if you like garlic, definitely add it!  :)
