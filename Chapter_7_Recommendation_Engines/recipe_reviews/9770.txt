When my Grandfather passed on, I became THE cookie baker and candy maker of my entire extended family. Which means... I bake and ship a LOT of cookies.  I began using this recipe several years ago and it has become my absolute favorite. These cookies are easy to make, freeze wonderfully (both prior to baking and after), and are GREAT for shipping as gifts.    The only changes I make to the basic recipe is that I use regular (always good quality) salted butter, and freshly ground sea salt, in place of table salt, which makes a subtle but amazing difference in taste.  When baking for home, I wrap stacks of cookies with aluminum foil and store in the freezer, taking them out as needed. this way they stay super fresh and yummy!  If I am baking for Christmas gifts, I add dried cranberries, and after they cool, I either drizzle with melted chocolate, and/or dip half of the cookie in white chocolate. Everyone RAVES about them!   Other ingredients I add at times are mini chocolate chips, raisins and spices.   A little tip to those who mention issues with their cookies turning out greasy... Try refrigerating the cookie dough for a couple of hours before baking. After baking, allow them to cool on plain brown paper (I save all of my paper grocery bags for this purpose).  The paper will absorb any excess fat in the cookies, and it's a great way to recycle! :o)

Well, these were OK, but they really wern't shortbready. To me, there were just another oatmal cookie. I expected something more buttery and rich. They were good cookies, just not what I was after. Sorry :(

My friends love this recipe when I make it.  Rather than nuts, I use dried cranberries - they give a nice little tang to go with the richness of the cookie.

These came out great. Living at high altitude I did need to add about 1 1/2 Tbs, flour to the mix, and I did add about 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/8 tsp nutmeg. Chewy and crunchy at the same time, yum!

This makes an oatmeal cookie (which is fine) but definitely not shortbread and the reason probably is the baking soda.   As far as a cookies goes no problem.   Sorry.......

Not terribly shortbready but still very good. The only change I made was to use regular butter. They took about 10 mins to cook. Not bad at all! Thanks, Zaz!

Mine also came out oily -- especially when eaten the next day. It was not so noticible right out of the oven.

OK but nothing special. Very crumbly. I expected more flavor from the oatmeal and nuts. In a word...boring.

Very good cookies but a bit dry. A glass of milk or tea would be perfect :) I used almond pieces instead of walnuts and they are just as good.

These cookies were very thin and oily. I know I followed the recipe - perhaps it contains an error?

This cookie is wonderful. I didn't have the chopped nuts or almond extract on hand, but they were still mighty tasty. My husband loves oatmeal cookies, but hates raisins. I think these have become on of his new favorites.

One reviewer noted that there wasn't much oatmeal flavor to the cookies.  The cure for that, as well as to make nuts sweeter and "nuttier" is to toast them first.  Put the oatmeal in a dry skillet, I use my favorite iron skillet (Grandma called it a spider, but I am deathly afraid of spiders!) and toast over medium-high heat, stirring the oats every little bit until I get a lovely fragrant oat perfume, and a little golden color.  Your oatmeal cookies will be better than everyone else's if you follow this simple, quick step first.  It's the little things that make baked goods amazing!
