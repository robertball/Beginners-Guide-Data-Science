We loved it!  New summer favorite drink!  We ended up finding Ginger Beer at Total Wine & more, Fry's didn't have it.  Don't try and substitute it with ginger ale; ginger ale and ginger beer are separate things.

So refreshing! I used Jamaican ginger beer and domestic vodka instead of Russian, so what would you call that? I also threw a sprig of mint in there just for looks. Because presentation is everything. Thanks for the recipe!

My new favorite drink that I first had on a cruise a few months back. So refreshing. Made this exactly as written with a slice of candied ginger on the glass. Yum.

If you want a light, easy drink that goes down smoothly, you simply cannot go wrong with a Moscow mule. It is so delicious and takes seconds to make. I love this drink!

I searched high and low for the perfect copper mug.  So it only makes sense I would search for the perfect Moscow Mule recipe!  I used Goslings Ginger Beer and vodka we got from a distillery we visited in Virginia this past summer.  Fresh-squeezed lime juice is the only way to go.  Yummy!  So  cool and refreshing on a hot summer day!

Make sure you use ginger beer, not ginger ale! A great summer drink, but also nice when you have a cold as the ginger is good on the throat.

I love Moscow mules this recipe is great. IMHO this drink is better with cheap vodka. It was created as a drink that could smooth out rough vodka I’m talking $14 for a jug vodka.  Just my 2 cents worth.

Some recipes suggested adding sweetener. I used a small shot of Amaretto Torani and it turned out AMAZING! Soooo good!

I LOVE these! I make my own ginger beer from a "ginger bug".  I make my ginger beer very spicy and sometimes add a little tumeric root to the ferment. Yummy!

Jamican Ginger Beer, by D & G  bottling company..Krogers! If you don't have Krogers, try an ethnic Hispanic grocery which may well have Caribbean supplies....here in East Lansing Michigan there is an oriental grocery that imports several Ja sodas from Canada!!! A fun change of pace drink for me.

I always use fresh mint (mull it into the drink), and if I can't find spicy ginger beer, I grind fresh ginger and stir it in.  I like a bit of ginger ale for sweetness. The copper cups keep the drink nice and icy.

If you love the taste of ginger, and I do, then this mule's for you!  It is simple, very refreshing, and a great, barely noticeable enhancement to ginger beer.  Love that the recipe is for a single serving, but it would be an easy cocktail for a busy host!  Thanks for posting!

Simply delicious! Easy to make. As others have said, the real Ginger Beer is what makes this drink. (Gingerale is different, so you won't get that true pop of ginger.) Fresh lime -- yum! Good quality Vodka, too. The bonus: a copper mug provides extra chill & beautiful presentation! Enjoy!
