This was VERY tasty! OK, I changed it just a little ... but not really.  I used BOTH gorgonzola and bleu cheese, BOTH basil and tomato pesto, and picked the pimentos out of green olives so I could stuff BOTH black and green olives.  I also spent what seemed like hours squeezing the cheese mixture into all those olives, because I made enough for a feast my medieval group put on (35 or so people) the first time.  The best part - or maybe it was the worst - was that I didn't get to bring any home!  Worth the work, in any case.  Just be careful not to put a fingernail through the ziplock bag while stuffing!
