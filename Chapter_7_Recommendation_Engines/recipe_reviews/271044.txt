Ok so I'm new to air frying, just bought one a few months ago. All the recipes I found for ribeye steaks were for grilling, only grilling in November in Idaho isn't all that feasible so when I found this method, I decided to give it a try. The author was vague as to which pan to use. My air fryer came with three options; a slatted grill type, basket and a solid pan. After much consideration, I decided to use the pan so the steaks would cook in their juices. And to sear or not to sear? That is the question. The very few comments made by others didn't suggest searing, although I've never known a method of cooking beef without searing but I decided to throw caution to the wind and go with not searing as it was not mentioned. What the heck, it's only one dinner and if it doesn't turn out right there's always Taco Bell so I went with not searing. Also, the author assumes we all have steak seasoning on hand, which I did not so I made my own. Mix in a small cup 1.5 tsp salt 1.5 tsp pepper 1.5 tsp garlic powder  half tsp paprika  half tsp onion powder quarter tsp rosemary quarter tsp thyme. Then I spooned out the 4 tsp and added to oil and soy sauce in a gallon zip lock bag. Added steaks. Squeeze out air. Put flat in fridge. Again, the author was vague but I know how to cook and meat should never be cooked from a cold state so I marinated the steaks for 2 hours in the fridge, turning every hour to mix. Then I took them out and let them come to room temp on the counter for another 4 h

My husband was so upset I was putting our rib eyes in the air fryer...until they came out! He was amazed. I used my own seasonings. The timing on this is perfect!  When it is just the two of us we will prob never grill our steak again.

Fine for the winter months when you can't grill. Steak did turn out nice and pink and juicy but the texture was different than with grilling.

Very good. The ready in 2 h 25m is wrong. It's ready in about 20 or 30. Good taste for sure.

I made it and it was perfect. I am not eating soy, so I substituted balsamic vinegar (half).  Otherwise, cooked per instructions.

Made as written and this turned out pretty good. It was too salty though and I like salt. Grilling is still the way to go in my opinion but if weather doesn't permit, this is a great stand-by method.
