It was good. I added a little soy sauce and also added some cooked chicken at the end.  I am always looking for recipes for leftover cooked chicken - and this one will make it into my rotation. Before I cooked the bok choy I had a huge bowl of greens. They, of-course, cooked down to be the right amount, but with all of the greens and mushrooms it was a very healthy meal.

**Updated 1/21/2020: Made this dish again last night with broccolini, in place of bok choy.  I also tried it with dry sherry - couldn't tell the difference, both were good.  My 8 year old grandson loved it. Next time will use spinach as this recipe works well with veggies. Not to mention it is also very filling ** Will definitely make this again and again! It's quick, simple and delicious.  I substituted the chicken/mushroom broth for vegetable broth. I have pictures that I will upload.  Thanks for sharing and this will be a staple in my home.

I added onions and tofu and it still didn't make hardly enough food for 2 ppl for dinner. Anyway, taste was fine and it was quick to make on a weeknight.

Very good. Made as recipe directed, except used fish sauce in place of oyster sauce. Served with rice. We decided it would taste really good with some ahi tuna poke, so I ran to the store and got some, and it was the perfect compliment!  Oh, and I added 1 Tbsp chili paste. My husband liked it :)

It tastes good. Missing something, but even though it is missing something- it was really good.

I thought that I liked bok choy, but maybe not.  Neither of us really cared for this.  Will not make again.

We enjoyed this simple stir fry--although I made a few modifications. I had some japanese eggplant in the frig and added that to the recipe.  I added one thinly-sliced eggplant prior to stir-frying the mushrooms. This may seem counter-intuitive for what began as a vegetarian recipe, but I also had a few ounces of  tri-tip left from a prior dinner and threw that in too.
