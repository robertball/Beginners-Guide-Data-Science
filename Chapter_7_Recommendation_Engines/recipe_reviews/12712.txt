My 3 1/2 year old daughter and I made this over the weekend and it was great. We added extra veggies and used half & half instead of milk to make it extra creamy. It is definitely in our family's soup rotation from now on.

This is very good chowder - thick, rich and tasty.  I cut the amount of cheese just a bit, but it definitely added a richness to the flavor without tasting too "cheesy".  I will be making this one again and again.  Thank you.

Needs more potatoes.  Directions step 4 & 5 both say to add the potatoes.  Which is correct?  Still a good flavor, will use again (modified).

Wonderful Clam Chowder.  I made this the day before to serve on Christmas Eve to a small group.  They loved it.  Had some left over for the next day - yummy!  I used sharp cheddar cheese and half and half instead of milk.  Very rich and delicious!

Loved it - made up a batch for National Clam Chowder Day (Feb 23) and it was a huge hit. Used sweet potato in place of white because it was all I had on hand. Also use extra sharp white cheddar - gave a tremendous kick to the chowder although it didn't look as nice, it separated too much but that was my own fault.

I loved this receipe! It had just the perfect combination of flavors. The cheese added
a little zip, I used sharp white cheddar.   Also, I didn't add all the flour it called for,
made it more like a soup rather than a thick chowder.
Everyone loved it! Thanks

I loved this soup! Even my six year old, who loves the "clam" in the soup but hates the "chowder" part, loved this and wanted seconds!!! It was delicious. Thanks for the recipe!

This is the best clam chowder recipe I've made from this site.  I made it as written except that I added extra carrots, celery, and onion.  I used 2% for the milk.

Tasted great!  I mad it less sodium by leaving out bacon and only used clam juice from can.  Potatoes need to be added with carrots and onion to cook before adding milk in order to cook thru.

Very good.  I doubled all of the veggies.  It would be a little thin without that.  The bacon grease adds a good flavor, but use very little bacon garnish as it can be a little overpowering.  I will definitely make it again and maybe try the Half and Half next time, although it was thick enough with the milk.

This is the best clam chowder I've ever made! I substituted half and half for the milk which made it thicker. Next time I will only put in 4 oz of cheese instead of 8 oz because although it was delicious the cheese is a bit overpowering.

I thought this soup was very good.  I had never had cheese in clam chowder before, but it went well with it.  I will definitely make this again.  Had enough for left overs too.

good, mine came out a little runny. I used more potatoes-and omitted the celery and carrots--we don't like either. I added garlic and crushed red pepper to add more flavor.  Maybe I will add some old bay next time.

Easy to make and Great Taste. I made this with Lactaid Free Whole milk and Sharp Cheddar, but it would taste alot better with half and half.

VERY good! Doubled the potato due to another reviewers comment and added a can of corn/black bean/red pepper blend for more flavor. Also, did 3 cups of skim and 1 cup of fat free half & half to make it a little healthier. Its a keeper!!!

This is the best!!! I actually put in more vegetables than the recipe calls for but thats just the way I cook. I never follow a recipe exact. Also I use Old Bay seasoning in it. and Real Cream! This is such a hit I make 18 quarts of it once a year for our soup supper. I actually have people give me money to make it for them. YUMMY!!

I've been making this recipe for five years now.  I loooove it.  Every time I make it a little different, but the base is fantastic. Everyone I feed it to have seconds without fail - so good! Thank you for such a wonderful recipe :)

This is A++. I have never made it with cheese and I am a cheese freak. Only difference I did was omit the cornstarch and carrots and used 2 cups milk and 2 cups half & half. Thanks for a great recipe.

Yes, I loved it, but after reading the reviews I added an extra can of cream of chicken soup, traded the frozen vegetables for 2 cans drained mixed vegetables and add pepper and some salad supreme seasoning.  My family loved it.  It is a keeper

I doubled all the vegetables, including the potato, I added a shallot I needed to use up. I reduced the clam juice to 16 oz bottled juice plus what came in one can of clams. The milk I reduced to using 16 oz fat free half and half plus one cup 1 % milk. I used 50 fresh steamed clams and one can minced clams. I had to simmer it for almost an hour until the potatoes were cooked and soup thickened, but it was worth it. We will make again
