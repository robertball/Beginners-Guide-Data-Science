The kids (ages 3 through 15) loved it!  I didn't have cottage cheese so I used sour cream. I also had to replace the mozza with cheddar cheese. Overall, they thought it was amazing and asked for seconds (when do kids do that?)  It will definitely be on the menu again!

I wanted to try this because I could sub brown rice for noodles, because brown rice is a better choice for me calorie-wise. Brown rice instead of noodles works great! But only 4 stars for this recipe as written, because it's pretty bland (needs garlic and lots of fresh herbs, and more cheese, and maybe an onion or two with the meat) and also because you need to cook up another half-cup or so of rice to properly layer a 9x13 here. I really liked the idea of using rice (and in my case, regular brown rice, fully cooked) instead of noodles -- thanks!

I found a favorite, tasty and easy recipe!  I had leftover rice in the fridge to use (not instant) and it worked great, too.  I was worried that the recipe might lack in flavor, so I substituted one large clove crushed garlic and added 1/3 cup chopped onion, and it definitely did not lack in flavor.  I also used the sour cream substitution of the cottage cheese, and that worked well for me, too.  Great idea for making an easy lasagna!

A keeper! I used Success boil-in-bag brown rice instead of minute rice and added a little chopped onion and green pepper to the ground beef while browning. I also added a clove or two of minced garlic, and used a 28 oz. jar of spaghetti sauce instead of a 15 oz. jar. And I used 2 cups of mixed italian shredded cheese instead of just mozzarella. Baked it in a 7" by 11" pyrex baking dish - delicious! It also seems very adaptable. Next time I might use italian sausage instead of ground beef and maybe a little red pepper flakes to spice it up.

I made this last night. It was excellent! If you follow this recipe, I suggest you use a muck smaller pan. I used a 13x9 but I used 3 cups rice, 5 eggs 3/4 cup parm cheese, 2 cups motz cheese, 2 1/2 cup cottage cheese and one and one half lbs of GB. I seasoned to taste, it was wonderful.

Not bad.  I used 3 egg whites instead of 2 eggs and added 1/4 c  spinach dip to the rice and 1/4 c to the cheese mixture.  I think next time I will add more spinach dip, as it's rather bland without it.

I am surprised at how yummy this turned out!  However, next time I make this, I will double the amount of the rice layer, and possibly the cheese layer.  I will also either add onions to the spaghetti sauce, or use a chunkier sauce -- and I will also add more spices.  I also substituted the cottage cheese for sour cream.  The recipe as-is turned out very tasty, just somewhat bland.

A very nice, simple alternative to noodle lasagna.
This was quick and easy to make, and the entire family enjoyed it.  Thanks!

i thought it was a little too cheesy but my husband thought next time we needed to add more. it doesn't hold together like regular lasagna, so just be prepared for that. we didn't add the meat and next time i think we'll probably add spinach or something like that just to give it more substance. it was still very good though. also, i used a 9x13 pan and could barely get all of it to spread as one layer. if you want it thicker i'd suggest an 8x8.

I thought this was delicious!!  I followed the recipe except for using brown rice, but baked in an 11 x 7 glass casserole.  I would definitely make more rice next time.  What an easy alternative to regular lasagna.

I am always on the lookout for something to please my picky Italian family and this did the job. Although none of them had high hopes for this dish, my son states that he now prefers this over regular lasagna...and heck it is way easier to make.

Surprisingly good.  I was skeptical.  I added more rice like others mentioned.  Used cottage cheese and a little dab of sour cream.  Only had fat free mozzarella but worked well.  I also used ground chicken and egg beaters to make a little more healthy.   Filled to the top of my 8x8 pan.  Hubby and kids ate both gave 5 stars!

Definitely different and pretty easy.  I didn't think the cup of rice would be enough so I used 4 cups to fill the 9x13.  Also used three jars of ragu (normal sized) and the full tub of cottage cheese.  Well this made enough to fill an army!  I will make it again but would probably just let the rice cook in the sauce and then add cheese to the top instead of dirtying up extra pots/bowls, etc.  But the taste was really good!

I added more rice as recommended and used an 8X8 pan. After scooping, it was more like a mix than a lasagna, but still tasty.

Wonderful! This has become a regular in our house. My only change is that a 9x13 pan is way too big for the quantities called for. I used a good size bread pan and it turns out great, even holds together well. I've made it for parties and get requests to make it again. The best part is that it reheats SO well for lunch the next day! Even my 2 year old loves it!
