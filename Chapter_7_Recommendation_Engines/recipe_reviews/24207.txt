How can people rate a recipe badly when they don't follow the original ingredient directions. "I used... and replaced ...with..." You have totally changed the recipe. If you've changed the recipe that drastically, submit your own. It really deceives people when we read bad reviews only to come to the conclusion that the reviewer didn't follow the recipe exactly. Is the ORIGINAL recipe any good?

This recipe didn't work for me. The muffins looked and smelled good when I took them out of the oven, but fell shortly afterward. They were very heavy and stuck to the liners. Maybe they need an egg?

Absolutely terrible.  After reading the other less than steller reviews I decided I'd give this a try anyway.  I used ap flour and added one teaspoon baking powder.  These muffins were still gooey and uncooked after 55 minutes in the oven.  The tops were like leather and the muffins deflated after cooling a minute or two.  Just plain awful.  Maybe the problem is too much fruit or the batter needed an egg.  Who knows but I know I won't make these again and next time I will listen to other members reviews more carefully!

I omitted the milk and replaced with 2 eggs. [I didn't have any orange so omitted this too!} I only added 1 grated apple. I also added some well chopped walnuts. I put egg, banana and vanilla into food processor, and then poured onto dry ingredients. I added about 1 desertspoon of rice milk because I felt the mixture was a bit solid. Muffins are yummy and I will make again. Next time I might cook at 170Â° for 5-10 minutes longer, and maybe add a fraction more milk.

This recipe has taught me to read the reviews! Awful result-did not cook in the middle and btw no mention in the directions of when to add the milk(although not a difficult thing to figure out...)

I saw the bad ratings and decided to make it anyway, and was glad that I did.  I made three changes:  I added an egg, and a cup of sliced, frozen strawberries instead of the apple, and I added a teaspoon of all spice.    For those complaining about the wet centre, there should be some wetness expected when you are using mashed bananas! They aren't going to solidify completely when baked, they remain moist and mushy.  If you want to prevent some of the wetness, either cut down on the bananas or mix them extremely thoroughly so that you have no chunks (even small ones.)  Personally, I loved being able to take a bite and finding a moist banana/strawberry mixture in the middle.   Considering how low-fat AND low calorie this is, I give it four stars.

I wish I would have read the review before I made these.  The muffins were mushy and stuck to the liners.  I keep wondering if I forgot a step. Maybe too much milk in the recipe?

I substituted stewed pear for the apple. I found that with a little bit more flour it makes 24. Very easy and yummy! My grandkids love them

I pretty  much have to echo what previous reviewers have said. The muffins smelled amazing, but the insides  didn't cook.  So disappointing.

I also gave this a try due to the people that gave it a 5 star rating and also I had granny smith apples and some bananas to use up.  After cooking an extra 25 ins they were still gooey and raw inside.  Maybe only needs one apple? Too bad because they do smell delicious.

Muffins did not cook,even after ten extra minutes. I believe it was most likely due to the moisture that came out of the apples when baking. The apples I used weighed 9 1/2 oz shredded and bananas 6oz. It would have helped to know the weight of the fruits in the recipe, because fruits vary in size. I think my apples were too big. I think muffins without any solid fat or oil or eggs in the recipe tend to not come out as intended. Not trying again.

I must say that as excited as I was to make these I was equally disappointed. They smelled awesome as they were cooking but they did not rise and they were gooey in the middle.  I put them back in the oven but this just made the outside leathery.  I thought about trying again with baking powder and soda but after reading the reviews, I am guessing that that won't work either.

This recipe is awesome!! I run a daycare and this is one that I come back to a lot.  Not only is it one of the only muffin recipes I've found that doesn't use eggs (allergy), but it's healthy, the kids love it and they really taste great!  It's not a cupcake, so don't expect over the top sweet flavor, but it's very delicious.
