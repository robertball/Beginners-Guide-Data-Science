I made this and we loved it. 
I removed the zucchini seeds after baking it for 20 minutes, filled it and baked about 15 minutes. Topped with cheese and baked 5 more minutes. 
We topped ours with sour cream, diced axocado and chopped cilantro. Yummy! This will become part of the regular rotation.

Overall a really good one dish meal. I also used zucchini, not patty squash. I don't like food waste, so I took the zucchini that was scraped out and chopped it up and added it back to saute with the onions and garlic. This created enough moisture that I was able to omit the chicken stock. Note: there are no spices in this recipe. The spice of the chorizo does carry pretty far, but not far enough. I added salt and pepper to the mixture before stuffing the squash. In the furture I will layer in some other spices, possibly smoked paprika, cumin, or even oregano. Also, mine needed to bake much longer than 5 min. It took about 20 min to get the cheese melted and bubbly. Family loved it, and I will definitely make this again.
