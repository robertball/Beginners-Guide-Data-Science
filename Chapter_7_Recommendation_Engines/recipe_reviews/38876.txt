This recipie was excellent! I used shredded cheddar and mozzerella 2% milk cheese and I didn't have any squash so I made up for with more mushrooms and zucchini.  I coated the vegetables with 1 tablespoon of olive oil & basil in a bowl before mixing it in with the pasta and I also used  Garlic and Herb tomato sauce which added a perfect kick!  Will defintely make again.

Definitely lacks flavor and needs some tweaking.

Yum. But don't add your pasta until the very end. Otherwise the starch or something leaks out and makes the liquid cloudy and thick.

Lacks a bit of taste. Next time I may try some turkey sausage or spicy chicken.

This dish was really good, but it didn't totally "wow" me.  I would definitely leave out the squash next time- the squash and the zuchinni have such a similar taste and consistency that it was a little much for me.  I added brocolli (steamed it first) and next time I think I'll add some cooked chicken, cut up.  As for my hubby, it was one of those dishes that he said he really liked, but then never took any of the leftovers for lunch.  It was super quick and easy to make though, which is why I'll definitely hang on to it.
