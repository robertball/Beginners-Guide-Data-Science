yum! what a tasty & wonderfully moist bar! i only made a few simple modifications such as substituting half of the all-purpose flour with whole wheat flour & tossing a 1/2 c. golden raisins into the batter (just because). "pumpkin pie spice" isn't something i have in my pantry. instead i use the spices my grandmother put into her pumpkin pies: 1/4 tsp. ground ginger, 1/4 tsp. ground nutmeg & 1/2 tsp. ground cinnamon. a couple more notes: i went with the flow & baked these in a 9 x 9" pan to get a thicker bar. mine were done in 30 minutes. lastly, i skipped the frosting & sprinkled mine with confectioner's sugar. these bars have enough flavor to stand on their own. thank you debbi!

I JUST MADE THIS AND IT TURNED OUT GREAT. I TOO USED AN 8X8 PAN AND BAKED FOR 20 MINUTES. I WAS ALSO OUT OF PUMPKIN PIE SPICE SO I USED A LITTLE ALLSPICE, NUTMEG AND CINNAMON.  IT IS DELICIOUS. I ALSO ADDED SOME BROWN SUGAR TO THE ICING, FROSTED THE CAKE WHILE WARM, AND CUT MYSELF A SLICE.  GOOD!! MY 3 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER AND ONE YEAR OLD SON LOVED IT AS WELL.  THANKS FOR THIS SIMPLE RECIPE.

These are sooooooo good. I substituted a homemade cream cheese icing instead and spread it on right after baking. It gave it a glazed affect. They were gone in a matter of minutes!
(icing: cream cheese, butter, vanilla, powdered sugar... yum)

These were delicious and so easy to make!  I followed the directions exactly the first time.  Next time I might try adding raisins and drizzling the frosting instead of spreading it.  The bars come out just moist enough, not wet like some applesauce bars.  This will be a regular snack cake in our home!

Outstanding! I doubled the recipe per earlier reviews and it needed to be baked for 45 minutes. I don't use compound spices like pumpkin pie spice, so I incorporated 1-1/2 tsp ground cinnamon, 1 tsp ground nutmeg, 1/2 tsp ground allspice and 1/2 tsp ground cloves. I wanted to make them easy to pack in a lunch so when I removed the baked bars from the oven, I turned on the broiler and poured a mixture of 1/4 cup (half a stick) of melted butter, 1/2 cup packed of brown sugar and 2 Tb milk over the top and broiled until the topping was bubbly. The result was nice and spicy, plus wonderfully moist, with a slightly crunchy top. My son couldn't wait until they were cool and cut himself 3 huge bars, devouring them immediately. This one's a keeper.

These were amazing--didn't last 24 hours! They taste like carrot cake without all the work.  I added about 2 tsp. light brown sugar to the frosting to give it a touch of caramel.

These turned out really good!! Low fat too ;)  Thanks for the recipe, I usually have chunky applesauce but I only had the cinnamon kind so I diced an apple and threw it in, they cam out a bit moister obviously, but still delicious.  A bit sweet, perhaps next time I will thin the icing and drizzle instead.  Thanks a lot for sharing!!!

LISTEN UP: for those of you who want more of a bar and less cake-like consistency, double all ingredients EXCEPT for the egg, and use a 9x13 pan.  Less egg=less fluffy.  I used 1/2 wheat flour and added raisins and they were TERRIFIC bars.

This is not a 'bar' but rather a spice cake. If baked in a smaller pan, then it gets to also look like a cake; if baked in a 9x13 pan it's still a cake, but too thin.

I had no idea how moist applesauce cakes could be.  I was very impressed.  Sure the discription always says moist when making cakes from scratch but what you usually end up with is a dense heavy cake.  Now I am writing this review as a "cake" becuase that is what I made.  I doubled the recipe and kept it in a 9x13 and it came out moist and delicious.  No need for frosting just powderd sugar on top.  I will definatly keep this recipe on hand.  It tastes better than most boxed spice cakes.

These bars are wonderful.  They're unbelievably light and moist.  I made them in an 8 X 12-inch pan and they are just a nice thickness.  They were done in about 18 - 20 minutes.  I used a glass pan so reduced the oven temperature to 325F.  I didn't make any changes to the recipe except for the icing.  I had some chocolate cream cheese icing left over from another cake so used it instead of the icing in the recipe.
Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I had a bunch of McIntosh apples I had to process into applesauce before they went bad.  This was a great way to use the applesauce in baking!  I made muffins instead of bars (400 degrees for 15 minutes) and they were very moist and flavorful.  The people in my office really enjoyed them.  Next time I plan on adding dried fruits and nuts to make them a little heartier.  I might even top them with a streusel topping for a twist.

This is a wonderful base recipe that can really be catered to individual tastes.  If you are looking to use up some applesauce or have a tasty harvest treat I strongly reccomend you give this recipe a try.  It is very quick and simple and the results are delicious.

Very good.  I added some raisins and they were delicious.  A note on the frosting....you might want to add a little extra milk.  It was way to stiff and would have smashed the bars if I tried spreading it.

I give this four stars because it was easy and I have most of the ingredients on hand at all times, and they were very moist and mildly sweet.  I didn't make the frosting to cut back on calories, but Hubby topped w/whipped cream and Carmel sauce and said it was amazing.  Next time I will add walnuts and use a slightly smaller pan.

Very good and simple bars!  I didn't have pumpkin pie spice, so I used 1/4 tsp. of ginger, 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg and 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon.  Great flavor!  I ended up cooking them for 30 minutes and that was definitely too much.  The 25 minutes specified would have been just perfect.

These are great! I followed the recipe with the exception of the all purpose flour. I prefer the texture of cake flour and found it worked very well with this recipe. The bars held together and I didn't feel they were too thin at all being baked in a 9x13 inch pan. They did, however have to be cut into squares directly in my pan. They don't come unstuck without some effort. Topped them off with powdered sugar. Not a fan of frosting. This recipe is a keeper!

Yum! I made the following changes: 3/4 cup whole wheat flour (1/4 cup all-purpose), 1/2 cup white sugar (instead of 2/3 cup brown; I was out of brown and ran out of white after 1/2 cup), and 3/4 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg, 1/4 teaspoon both cloves and ginger instead of the pumpkin pie spice (didn't have any). I also added about 3/4 cup chopped walnuts. It is PLENTY sweet, even with unsweetened applesauce and without the glaze; I will probably decrease the sugar to 1/3 cup next time. This cake is awesome by it's self. There is really no need for the frosting! I will definitely, definitely make this again and again!

These bars are fantastic!!  Very moist, as claimed.  I would definitely double for a 9x13 pan, unless you like them thin.  I used apple pie spice instead of pumpkin pie spice, and I used cinnamon applesauce rather than regular.  They are definitely something I will make again soon.  My kids loved them!

Very easy and quick.  I used an 8x8 pan the first time to make a cake.  The second time I tried it in an 11x13 pan and baked it about 20 minutes.  It does taste like carrot cake.  Delicious!

I don't know how the recipe calls for 9x16 pan. I used an 8x8 and the bars were still thin. The icing was also too sweet and not enough to cover the 8x8 surface.

The taste and texture were good though, but I felt mislead by the recipe.

Delicious, and so very easy! I know a lot of people had some problems with the size of the bars, but I thought the bars came out fine in a 9x13; they're more like a "bar" than a cake square.  I also used a cream cheese frosting drizzle-type topping.  I made these in a pinch when I had company over and they were eaten right up! I highly recommend this recipe.

My search for the perfect applesauce bars have ended here!! I am so thrilled that I came upon this recipe because it's fantastic. I doubled the recipe and added raisins, per some viewers suggestions. I'm glad that I did because I would imagine that the bars would have been way too flat if I baked them in such a big pan without doubling. Other than those few things, I didn't change anything else and I can't say enough. I love this recipe!!

Wonderful taste however they were way too thin.  The 9/13 pan suggested didn't work well.  I suggest a 9/9 pan and increase cooking 5 minutes.

VERY yummy! And extremely easy. But I screwed up the frosting by using regular sugar (don't let pregnant women try new recipes!). The bars were very moist and flavorful, will definitely make again.

If I could rate this any lower than zero I would. This was terrible. I made this recipe according to the directions, put it in a 9x13 inch pan as the instructions call for and the "bars" were no thicker than a chocolate chip cookie. I'm not sure what everyone else here has done with these but to say they are amazing or fantastic is completely off the rails. My advice... either bake them in an 8x8 pan or find a different recipe because this one is horrible. If people have to make modifications to the recipe to make it work than the recipe is flawed and needs to either be edited or removed completely. A complete waste of my time and ingredients.

I love these easy bars and have made them many times. I usually sub Splenda brown sugar blend for the sugar and add raisins. Cream cheese frosting is the best compliment to them for me. Today I made them and added a grated apple (to a half recipe) and they were very yummy and apple-y. Thank you for the recipe!

I used whole wheat flour for the all purpose, also used 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice, baked in a 9x9 pan for 25 minutes, a 9x13 pan would have been way too thin, skipped icing as bars were sweet enough, nice snack bar.

Delicious! I didn't alter the recipe at all except for using Splenda Brown Sugar instead of regular because I'm diabetic.  I also used Sugar Free Vanilla Frosting instead of the provided frosting recipe.  Definately a keeper  :)

Very moist and delicious!  I'm giving it five stars b/c of the yummy flavor and IT WAS SO EASY TO MAKE!  Aside from using a 7x11 pan, baked it according to recipe and it turned out moist and delicious.  If you need a quick go to, this is the recipe for you. Just for fun, will try either cream cheese frosting or just some pumpkin spiced whipped topping next time.

Great recipe & very moist. My family loved these cake like bars. I did make a few changes: Substituted pumpkin pie spices with 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp ground ginger & 1/2 tsp cinnamon. Didn't have regular applesauce, so I used chunky & it worked very well so I will do that again in future. Also used cream cheese frosting. Next time I will use 9x9 pan or double recipe so bars are thicker. Great snack & dessert.

Very good recipe! I just sprinkled powedered sugar over mine instead of the glaze, and it tasted just as good. I also made sure to add 1/2 cup of raisins, it creates more texture and flavor!

Maybe a 3 because I did not put icing on them, as I was tryng to keep them healthier for my daughter's pre-school. I did sprinkle a little confectioner's sugar and it got absorbed and was not seen on top. Overall, they were a little bland leading to the 3 stars - may try again with icing.

light, fluffy, and delicious! I baked them in a 9 x 9 pan for 25 minutes and they were perfect. I also cut the glaze recipe in half because I did not want them to be too sweet!

Overall, these bars were great!  However, I did not particularly like the texture, which was a mix between cookie and cake.  Maybe my family is just not used to the cakey/chewy texture.  On the plus side, the flavour was wonderful.  Since I didn't have pie spice, I used half a teaspoon of cinnamon and two pinches each of nutmeg, cloves, allspice, and ginger.

This simple recipe is easy and delicious.  I don't keep pumpkin pie spice on hand, so I substituted 1/2t cinnamon, 1/4t nutmeg, and 1/4t cloves.  I baked in a 9x9 pan so that I could use my convection oven, so the result was more cake-like than the original.  Very tasty.

WE LOVE THESE BARS!  I would've never thought that such a simple recipe would taste so good, even my husband has been won over.  For two days everytime I asked my four-year-old what he wanted for a snack he would shout, "Applesause Bars!!"  The ONLY thing I might change next time is the amt. of vanilla in the frosting... it was almost a little too overwhelming.  Other than that they were perfect for us. Thank you, Debbi!

These bars were just as others said, TERRIFIC!!!.  I doubled the amount and added in the mixture 1 teaspoon vanilla essence, 2 teaspoons cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon mixed spice, and a dash of nutmeg.  I also added 1/2 teaspoon lime juice into the frosting mixture. Yummm! Delicious, moist and close to the taste of a carrot cake.  Next time I'll add raisins as others recommended.

These were one of the easiest desserts ever.  They were very moist and so delicious.  I took them to a work gathering and some people thought they were pumpkin bars.  I will make these again for sure and next time try nuts on the topping.

Flavor is mild. I think I will add some ground ginger next time. They were done in 20 min. using a 9 x 13 pan. Yes, they do come out thin but not a big deal. Very good and will make again. Family liked it too.

Fantastic! I am the food service director at an upscale independent living center. I recently made these for desset. The only thing I did differently was I doubled the recipe and added some raw ground carrots. To the frosting I added some pumpkin pie spice. Moist and delicious. Thanks for sharing.

These are pretty good but cake like.  A bit too sweet especially with the frosting.  I added 1 tablespoon of brown sugar to my frosting after reading it in a review and it made the frosting gritty.  Not sure if I was supposed to beat the brown sugar with the butter and then add in the confectioners sugar (I just mixed all together by hand) but the result of the frosting wasn't worth it.  Next time I will stick to the recipe for the frosting.

Ridiculously easy to make and oh so good.  We skipped the frosting and are having them for breakfast.  Delicious with dried currants added.

My bars were more like cake because I doubled the recipe but still used a 9X13 pan.  I think another reviewer suggested using just one egg to make them more bar like.  I also added 2/3 c. of raisins and one peeled, finely chopped apple.  They taste good and are really moist.  I sprinkled powdered sugar on top instead of doing the frosting.

These are tasty bars.  I baked them in an 11 x 7 inch dish and they were pretty thin.  I can't imagine how thin they would be in a 9 x 13 inch dish.  I frosted them with cream cheese frosting I had leftover from another recipe.  These taste great and thanks for a great recipe.

Used chunky applesauce and followed recipe exactly.  Family ate these up in a few hours flat!  Didn't put on icing because they ate them up before I could get it on!

WOW! These are awesome- especially for being somewhat lower in fat. The kids gobbled them up too. The frosting was a little sweet- but oh so good on the warm cake.

WOW! Melt in my mouth insanely great! ONLY problem was the oan size... 9x13?? Wish I would have read other users reviews first and changed the pan size, since these are like as thin as a piece of tissue paper! But a CRAZY GOOD tissue paper :) The icing is perfect too! Everyone just said, "Wish these were 10 times as thick :)" It's a compliment hehe.... Great recipe!

Wonderful, simple, easy cake.  After reading reviews I added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp vanilla extract & 1/3 c chopped walnuts and used cinnamon applesauce.  I also used Smart Balance original in place of the butter.  I baked mine in an 8X8 metal pan & it was done in 28 minutes.  I frosted this with (Janni's) Cream Cheese Frosting II & it was an excellent combo!  Next time I'll try adding raisins like other reviewers.  Thank you!

Made as instructed, taste was okay, needed more spice. Bars were very crumbly though. Very disappointed in that. Won't make these again.

Very good! I didn't have any pumpkin pie spice, so I used 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp of nutmeg just as suggested by another reviewer. Also, I didn't make the frosting, just powdered sugar was enough for us.

Delicious, quick and very easy!!!  I had all the ingredients on hand and it took hardly any time to put it together.  Definately use a smaller pan; I used an 8X8 metal pan and they are the perfect size bars.

I used Splenda brown sugar blend, whole wheat flour, homemade chunky organic applesauce and homemade pumpkin pie spice. I did add a half cup of raisins to the bars and a teaspoon of baking powder. I only used a sprinkling of the confectioners sugar on the top to cut back on the sugar/fat. These were pretty tasty, my littlest especially liked them. I think when I make these again, I'll bump up the pumpkin pie spice. NOTE: I also made this in an 8x8 metal baking pan.

Oh sooo good. I doubled it for a 9x13. Added a pinch of cloves and nutmeg since I don't have pumpkin spice and I have made it 2 times in 3 days. Rave reviews from even the pickiest eaters. Thank you!

I made this in an 8 by 8 pan too, so it was more like a snack cake.  I substituted whole wheat flour for part of the white, and my kids keep begging for more.

These bars were simple to make and very moist. I added the vanilla frosting and wow it really made the bar delicious. Alone the bar was still good just not as exciting ;-). Confectioners' sugar on top would be another great alternative.

Love these!  I like the fact that they don't have much butter and they are still moist and have great flavor.  I have left these plain, frosted with brown butter frosting as well as using cream cheese frosting.  They always taste great!

These are great.  I used the cream cheese, butter recipe frosting.  But I am sure they are great on thier own or w/ the frosting from the recipe.  My boys ate all of it in the first 24 hours.  I sifted my flour but will not next time.  They were a little too moist to cut and eat like a bar, more like a cake.

This is probably my dd's most requested dessert!  The only change I make is to use 1/2 cup ap flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour.  Otherwise I make as directed to rave reviews.  I (and my dd) thank you for sharing.

These were very good. They turn out soft and moist. We sprinkled our with powdered sugar. They were a nice "non-sweet" addition to our christmas cookies.

Delicious! Only change I made was to use an 11x7 baking dish and it was perfect. The recipe doesn't specify, so I used unsweetened applesauce and that was fine. Still plenty sweet. I also added about 1/3 cup cream cheese to the frosting. Half the pan was scarfed up by daughter and friend within a half hour after arriving home from school. This is so easy and can be whipped up in the blink of an eye! Thanks Debbi for this great recipe.

I thought that these were just ok, but I still gave them 4 stars because the recipe is so easy and also because they are fairly low calorie.  They would be much better with a cream cheese icing.

This was so delicious!  I brought it to two different group events and everyone loved it.  I followed the recipe almost exactly, except I substituted 1/2tsp. cinnamon, 1/4tsp. ginger, 1/8tsp. cloves, 1/8tsp. nutmeg for the pumpkin pie spice.  The first time I made it, I frosted it with storebought vanilla frosting.  The second time I sprinkled powdered sugar on it.  It was great both ways.  This is my new favorite fall dessert.

This recipe is wonderful!  So moist and the spice is simple but robust.  I just made these to bring in to work today and they went like hotcakes.  Even someone here who doesn't like sweets loved it.  The only issue I had was that the glaze/frosting didn't set very well, but I made this part this morning and only had it in the fridge for an hour before bringing it so this might have affected things.  It tasted great though.  Next time I will try it with a buttercream or cream cheese frosting.  Also, I followed the recipe to the letter, except for doubling it and baking in a 9x13 pan.  WONDERFUL!

This is a fantastic recipe!  I make it in a 8 X 8 pan for 25-30 minutes in the oven so that it's not too wet.  I also make it even healthier by substituting 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup white flour and use less butter (2-3 tablespoons) than the recipe calls for and you can't tell there's any difference!

Another variation: substitute the apple sauce with another kind of fruit sauce (of similar consistency).  I've done it with mango sauce (from Trader Joe's) and it came out great!

I doubled the recipe and used a 9x13" pan. I add, besides the pumpkin pie spice, 1 t. ground cloves, 1/2 t. nutmeg, 1/4 t. allspice and a 1/2 t. cayenne pepper. I baked it for 30 minutes and topped, while still warm, with a mixture of confwctioners' sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg which I put in a small strainer and rubbed with a spoon to give a dusting effect. They were very moist and very, very good.

everyone seemed to be using a narrower pan or doubling the recipe, so i did the same, but this probably detracted from the original meaning: bars.  what i got was a (delicious) cake bite, not a bar.  so, as a cake bite, four stars!

I had several pints of homemade apple butter I did not want to go to waste.  I made a double recipe following the recipe except using 2 Cups of apple butter instead of applesauce.  I eliminated the spices since the apple butter was highly seasoned.  Added a handful of cranraisins.  Baked for 45 minutes at 350 degrees.  Bars were thick and very, very good.  Will do it again with no hesitation.

The flavor was great, but I thought the cake a bit too moist.  I probably should have baked it about 5 minutes longer.  Probably will try again.

Very quick, easy and simple recipe - but also very tasty.  I lacked the pumpkin spice and used a cinnamon and nutmeg combo, as well, and also followed the advice of another cook who suggested adding chopped apple (about a cup / 1 large apple) - what a GREAT addition!!  We skipped the frosting and never missed it.

Since I didn't have any Pumpkin Pie Spice I substituted 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg and 1/4 tsp allspice and I baked it in a smaller pan.  The result was a very aromatic, moist bar that was a delight to eat!
I did not put any frosting or sugar on top, but maybe next time I'll try thinly sliced apples with a sprinkling of cinnamon sugar on top.
Overall a wonderful recipe.

Amazing! I made my own apple sauce well,(Sarah's Applesauce from this site), not my own, but it was amazing.  I took it to a card/game night at a friends house, and it was gone by the time we left.

These bars are very good. They're extremely spicey with all the pumpkin pie seasoning. It reminds me of a spice cake more than applesauce. I put them in a 9x9 pan, and it worked perfectly. If making them in a 9x13 I would definitely double the recipe or they would be too thin. I frosted them with 1/2 recipe of cream cheese frosting. They are very moist and flavorful.

I substituted 1/4 C. applesauce for the butter and added 1 C. quick oats.  I also frosted with Caramel Frosting IV.  They were awesome, and I'll be making them again and again.

Very quick to assemble!  An incredibly easy recipe that disappears fast!  I think next time, I would add raisins and bake it in an 8X8 pan; the bars were cake-like in texture, but quite thin.  I also drizzled the icing as opposed to spreading it and this looked very pretty and professional. UPDATE: I made these bars again as I had some applesauce to use up. I baked in an 8 x 9 inch pan for 22 minutes. They were perfectly moist and delicious. I did not frost them but sprinkled icing sugar on top. Compliments from my family and guest.

Thanks, Debbi -  I love giving the kids a snack that's a bit healthier than store-bought cupcakes!  I made this recipe as muffins - they only took about 15 minutes to bake, and it was easier that way to "customize" them for different family members: some get icing, some get icing sprinkled with chopped nuts, some get powdered sugar, and some get sprinkled with cinnamon sugar.  For icing, I used some softened cream cheese beaten with powdered sugar (taste it until you get the sweetness level you like) and a little milk to make it more spreadable.  Really good recipe!

Very moist and yummy.  I made these for a family get together and the adults liked them better than the kids.  I added a 1/2t nutmeg and 1t cinnamon.  I drizzled some store bought cream cheese frosting over them, instead of frosting the entire pan.

I made these bars and the whole family LOVED them.  My husband says they are addictive and they didn't last long in our house.  So simple too, with ingredients you probably have on hand.  I did add a little more milk to the frosting to make it easier to spread.  YUM!!!

These were really good.  Next time though, I will add raisins or diced apples for more texture.  I didn't care for the sweet icing and might just "drizzle" it next time.  Kids loved them as a after school treat......

Very good, moist and really a pretty light dessert if you go easy on the icing or opt for the confectioner's sugar instead of icing.

I actually had to change the recipe a little, since I don't own any Pumpkin Pie Spice.  I just left that out.  It baked just fine without it though.

My applesauce was Motts Peach flavored, and the end result was really good!

I left these bars at home for four brothers and my dad when I had to leave. Fifteen minutes later I recieved a text, "deeelicious!!" and within an hour another message telling me they were ALL gone. The whole batch. I did skip the icing, but served them warm and they were a huge hit in my family!

I've made this recipe twice; we think it's terrific.  The first time, I added 1/2 t powdered ginger because I was in the mood for something really spicy.  I also added 1/2 t cinnamon to the frosting.  We couldn't leave them alone.  I used white whole wheat flour and they were still moist and tender.
Yesterday, I made the recipe again and doubled the recipe.  It baked in 30 minutes, in a 9/13 pan, and was just as good as the first time.
One thing I would say is to watch them carefully; our oven is new and may bake hotter, but the bars were done before the time specified in the recipe.

Agree. Smaller pan!! I used an 8x8 also. The batter would be too thin for a 9x13 IMHO. If you doubled the recipe, then the larger pan would be fine. 

I used 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and a smidge of fresh nutmeg instead of pumpkin pie spice.

Definitely a keeper! So easy and fast to prepare with basic pantry staples! I didn't have any pumpkin spice on hand but a tsp of cinnamon, a 1/4 tsp each of nutmeg and ground cloves substituted perfectly.  The cake/bar comes out very moist and flavorful. An option to consider when making frosting ... a quick change from a buttercream frosting ... replace the butter with a Tbs or so of peanut butter ... delicious on applesauce cakes! Thanks for sharing your recipe!

These were disappointing just because I was expecting them to be a "bar" type cookie but instead the recipe really produces a cake. For a spicy fall type cake though you couldn't go wrong with this recipe. Would be good warm with vanilla pudding.

Just cut into these and they are PERFECT.  Only changes I made were to sub a banana for the egg (I was out of eggs) and doubled the recipe and baked in a 9x13 pan.  They are so good I'm not even going to make the frosting!

Bars were good but thin.  Might be better in a 9x9 pan.

ohmygosh.  This was the BEST SPICE CAKE I'VE EVER HAD. And the glaze...wow...these were melt-in-your-mouth incredible.  Especially warm from the oven!  My whole family (of 3) devoured the entire thing in one night.

these are AMAZING!!  my only change was to add about 3oz of cream cheese ot the frosting.  the cake is sooo moist and the flavor is wonderful.  the frosting goes very well with the dense texture of the cake.  my entire family loved this...i can see already it will not last long in our house!!  :)

These are so amazing! It's super moist with delicious fall flavor. If you're debating on the icing, do it! It totally makes it. I usually add a little extra cinnamon, for preference. I have other family members making this all the time now.

These bars are heavenly!  I made mine in a glass  9x 13" pan greased with butter and they turned out perfect.  The frosting recipe listed was too bland for me so I tossed it and used Duncan Hines Whipped Vanilla frosting, very lightly.  Also sprinkled with cinnamon for prettiness :)  I made these for a cookie exchange party...After tasting one, I want to make more!

This was a good recipe, but mine looked a lot more dense than the picture. 
I made my own applesauce for the recipe (granny smith apples) which made the sauce more tart which I like. 
Also, I cut the icing recipe in half and just drizzled it on top of the bars an hour before serving. It was the perfect sweetness. 
This was a hit at a church meeting!

Made these today and they are delicious!! Mine came out more like a this cake than a bar cookie. But still very yummy. I made mine in a 9x13 pan, and it only took about 12 mins..my oven seems to cook things faster for some reason

Delicious!  These were so easy to throw together as a last minute dessert- all of the ingredients are pantry staples.  Mine cooked perfectly in about 22 minutes.  They're nicely moist but not soggy.  Not a dense, heavy dessert like some spice cakes can be.  Frosting came together nicely, too.  I'm having a hard time not eating more while I type this!

I baked in an 8x8 pan, and added 1/2 cup walnuts and 1/2 cup raisins.
I chose to skip the icing in this recipe and topped it with cream-cheese frosting instead.
With my changes, I wouldn't call these bars -- it was a cake. But it was a DELICIOUS cake!

this was a very simple, easy bar to make.  i doubled the recipe and made it in 9 x 13 pan.  had i not, the bar would have been much too thin for me.  the spices were tasty, but i did not find anything special about this bar.  it's not that i didn't like it.... i just wasn't wowed.  i didn't find it memorable.  i will keep looking for another applesauce bar/cake.

This was delicious!  I added raisins, might try some walnuts next time too.  I had to make two batches of icing to cover the whole 9x13 pan, and it needed a little extra milk to make it easy to spread.  Just wish there was a way to make it a little healthier, with less butter.

These were delicious, but I must confess that I got distracted by the kids and put the remaining ingredients (intended for the icing) less some of the butter into the main batter mixture!  It still turned out delicious without a bit left, and I made a double helping, so that speaks well!

Very easy to make and very good!  My boyfriend and daughter loved it.  I also didn't use the pumpkin pie spice. I used ginger, cinnamon, and nutmeg in place of it.  Also, I used powdered sugar as a topping in place of the frosting.  In the powdered sugar, I added ginger, cloves, cinnamon, and nutmeg - just for something different! Great recipe

I make this with Cinnamon instead of pumpkin pie spice and it still turns out great! I sometimes add raisins soaked in water, then drained. I have used gluten free flour or wheat flour and it still turns out. I cut down on the sugar, and add a shredded apple or two. I also replace the butter with EV coconut oil or extra applesauce. As for the frosting, any will do and none at all is still good.

Wow! Even with all the rave reviews I was still surprised at how good these were. I made them as an afternoon snack for my kids, but ended up eating most of them myself! I skipped the icing and powdered sugar and thought they were perfect plain.

These bars are a moist, soft treat that are perfectly spiced I halved the frosting and it still made enough to cover the whole thing.

This turned out to me more of a cake than bars, but it was delicious and I'll definitely be making it again, though probably without frosting.

If this was an apple sauce cake rather than bars, I'd give it 5 stars. Made the recipe as written and found it more like thin hard to handle cake rather than bars that I would assume meant that it would have the consistency something like a brownie. I made it again and double the recipe per review. Results were a wonderful moist cake that people thought was a pumpkin cake. I used a cream cheese frosting instead of the one in the recipe and went over great at a beach potluck. I'll make the "cake" again but not try the bars.

Made these twice (without frosting) thinking it needed more spice and maybe the raisins (as others suggested), still it did nothing for anyone who tried it.

Although it turns out to be more like cake than it does bars (due to it being so moist), it is yummy!  I took the suggestions of some others and added golden raisins and substituted cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger for the pumpkin pie spice, since I don't normally have that in my pantry. It was a hit in my house and VERY easy to make.  Will definitely make again!

I really want to give this 3 1/2 stars, I didn't have pumpkin spice but I did use nutmeg and cinnamon. Alone the bars tasted kind of bland however I did not use brown sugar in an effort to cut back on sugar. Next time I may use brown sugar. I made the cream cheese frosting but I added lemon juice to make a lemon frosting. The bars are amazing with the frosting. However, I really would like to use less sugar and have a good tasting dessert...

red flag.  I did not have enough batter to spread this out 9 x 13 pan, lets just say it would be almost cookie thin.  I doubled the batter.

This was awesome, I listened to most of the people and made it in an 8x8 pan and added a little cinnamin and it was just wonderful!!!!  To the frosting I also added about half a bar of cream cheese, wich made it more creamy and flavorful.  The kids loved it and I will be making this again soon. :)

Ah, these satisfy my craving for fall baking spices! Easy recipe and delicious.  I made a few changes based on previous reviews: half wheat flour and half white; 1/4 tsp. each of cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and allspice instead of pumpkin pie spice; and I baked it in a glass 8X8 pan for 30 minutes.  The bars came out perfectly moist and full of flavor.   I made cream cheese frosting: 4 oz cream cheese, 1 cup confectioners sugar, and a dash of vanilla.  I put the frosting on the cake while hot, which turned it into a glaze, kind of like cinnamon bun frosting.  It goes great together and I don't even like cream cheese that much.  Thanks for the recipe... I will make it again, I'm sure!

These are wonderful snackin cakes!  I made them early this morning to take on a picnic today.  They went together so fast, and with no mixer, yet!  Love that!  All I had were those little applesauce single serving cups, so I used 2 of those pluse a big spoonful of apple butter to equal the one oup needed..it was great.  For the frosting, I used some homemade butterscotch sauce and a dribble of heavy cream instead of butter and milk, that accent was delicious, too.  Will definately make these again.  Thanks, Debbi

This is a great recipe.  Went with cream cheese frosting, didn't use a recipe--about 4 oz cream cheese, 2 tbsp butter, 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar, 1 tsp vanilla, dash of half  and half.  I also added a tsp of vanilla to the batter and used my own mixture of cloves, cinnamon and ginger for spices and homemade cinnamon apple sauce.  I can't stop, I've eaten half a pan.

I used a 9x9 pan and added 1/2 cup of pecans. Initially, I tried them without the frosting, but then I felt like something was missing so I made the frosting and added some brown sugar to it. I suggest you add the frosting! It made these applesauce bars even better!

I give this 5 stars!  my husband says less cause there's no chocolate!  : )  I baked mine exactly like the recipe only I baked it in a round cake pan.  I didn't feel like digging out my 8x8.  I would definitely recommend baking it in a smaller pan.  I was looking for something light and something other than chocolate and this was great!  I used powdered sugar on top instead of the icing recipe.  Will definitely make again.  oh, this would be great on a cold wintery day!  Excellent!

These are great.  I did not have pumpkin pie spice, so I substituted with 1tsp cinnamon + a pinch of cloves.  I also used less sugar, approx 1/2 cup, and it was more than sweet enough for our liking.  I just dusted with icing sugar once they were cooled, and then cut them in to squares and wrapped each one in plastic wrap and kept them in the fridge, so we could grab'n'go..... they didn't last long at all!

5 stars because it is so easy to make with nice results.  Mild, slightly sweet flavor, very moist.  It didn't need icing at all.  I used 100% whole wheat flour and made it an 8x8 pan which made it very cake like.

We really enjoyed these and will incorporate them into our dessert rotation.  I couldn't believe how much they tasted like carrot cake, so good!  Next time I will probably bake in a smaller pan or double the recipe to make them thicker but will change nothing else.  Thanks for this great recipe!

Excellent. I followed the suggestion of baking this in a 9"-square pan, and the bars were nice and thick. I didn't put anything on top as they were sweet enough as is. Thanks for sharing!

These were excellent!  I modified the recipe slightly, using 1/3 c brown sugar and 1/3 c Splenda, and only baked 20 minutes in the 9x13 pan.  I think I'll do the 8x8 next time as suggested, but I will definitely be making these again - so tasty, and I know they'll be a hit at work tomorrow!

So good..always a family favorite.  I used homemade applesauce this time..to die for!  I also doubled the recipe and baked in a 13x9 dish.  When I pull it out of the oven I poke holes with a fork all over and pour the icing on the warm cake..then oozes all though the cake...mmm good!

I thought these bars were excellent!  They have a very cake-like texture, and I have a feeling that you could also turn them into muffins as well.  I didn't use any icing on them, and they definitely satisfied my sweet tooth!  I used a combo of cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves instead of pumpkin pie spice.  Yum-O!!

Very good!  I did substitute homemade apple butter for the applesauce and it worked fine.  I will try making in an 8x8 next time since I felt like the end result was way too thin when done in a 9 x 13 pan.  I used the sprinkled powdered sugar on top and that was very nice.  I also think this recipe would be fantastic with a crumble topping sprinkled on before baking - 1 part flour, 1 part brown sugar and 1 part butter cut in to form crumbs.  I might even add some cinnamon to the crumble part too.  Will be trying again for sure!

I make this recipe every week.  My entire family loves them and I always have some on hand in the freezer.  I have added to the health benifits by using whole wheat flour, dropping the sugar to 1/2 cup (I use raw sugar) and I don't do the frosting because the bar just doesn't need it.  Even if you make the recipe as is you are only talking 2 Weight Watchers points.  I do find a 9X13 creates a thinner bar so I do a square pan to make them a bit thicker.  It does reduce your portions so WW folks need to factor that in.

I don't post reviews often, but I was so surprised as to how delicious this turned out that I had to post! I followed the recipe exactly with one exception. I didn't particularly care for the icing, so instead of spreading it all over, I cut a very small hole in a plastic baggie and put a thin line design on the whole cake so there wasn't so much. I'm not a big cake person and I had a couple pieces and so did everyone else!

I made these bars last night and they turned out great!  I just thought the icing was too sweet and overpowered the delicate taste of the bars.  Next time I will lightly drizzle the icing on or go without.  Otherwise this is an excelent recipe.  I will definately be making these again.

I was not expecting these to be so amazing (despite many good reviews) but they were in fact awesome. And easy. Halved the icing because they're so tasty on their own. I have to disagree with those reviewers who compare this to carrot cake - personally hate carrot cake, love these. Hubby ate half the pan for breakfast the next day. Yum!

Everyone in my family loved these...maybe too much, as we could not stop eating them! My dad referred to them as "those square cupcakes." They really were delicious. I didn't have any pumpkin pie spice, so I substituted 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp cloves, 1/2 tsp allspice, and 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg. Also baked them in a smaller pan, so they were a little thicker- had to up the baking time.

Excellent.  My family raved about it.  I even didn't have pumpkin spice and just did 1/2 cinnamon and 1/2 nutmeg and it was absolutely fantastic!  Further, I used an 8 by 8 pan.

Easy to make.  A tad spicy and sweet though.  My 18month old loved this with a cup of milk.  As per other reviews I also doubled the recipe and made it as a cake.  Added raisins.  I just used icing sugar to dust the top but I'm going to try it with the icing next time.

This recipe was delicious.  I would make one change which would be to double the recipe.  It is more cake like than bar like, but very delicious regardless.

It was moist the way I like it and with the spices, it tasted a bit like gingerbread/pumpkin muffin-ish.  I doubled the recipe and baked it for 35 minutes.  We didn't use the frosting either.

Wasn't sure what to expect but these bars were a good surprise: very moist and tasty. Like other reviewers, I thought they were too thin. Next time, I'll double the quantities or use a smaller pan. EDITED to make it a five stars review! I love the versatility of this recipe: last time I made them, I added 3 tbsp. cocoa powder! Yumyum!

These are yummy! They are very moist, dense, and similar in taste to carrot cake. I made a double batch, because I had applesauce that needed to be used up (which I made from apples that needed to be used up; I don't think I'll have that problem with these bars!) You can see in my picture that the double batch cooks to about 1 1/4" high. My applesauce was unsweetened. I will also try these as written, so that they are more bar like, and try cream cheese frosting as well.

I doubled the recipe to make a cake and accidently quadrupled the butter. I remade this with the regular amount of butter and I am sorry to say that we loved it so much  more with twice the butter. I am going to try it next with whole wheat flour. Loved it!

Very good, moist and flavorful, didn't have Pumpkin Pie Spice on hand...so I used a combination of nutmeg, cloves, allspice and cinnamon - worked well. These would be good with raisins and/or nuts added.

These bars are very moist and simple, and taste wonderful!  I used butter and natural applesauce (unsweetened).  I had to add 1 additional Tablespoon of milk to the icing.  Even my brother who dislikes cookies with any kind of fruit in them ate several and took some home with him!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I doubled the recipe and made it in a 9 x 13 pan.  I used light butter, added 1 cup chopped pecans and 1/2 cup raisins.  It is so moist and tender that I decided not to add and frosting...just sprinkle some powdered sugar on top.  YUM!

Absolutely Fabulous!  I love good food that doesn't require a chef's time or pantry.  I didn't bother with the frosting as my family is notorious for picking off frosting and eating things plain.  The recipe also handles the blend of 1/2c. whole wheat flour, 1/2c. unbleached flour, which I try to slip by the kids every chance I get.  Golden raisins, dried apples, and chopped dates have also made their way into this home's new-found favorite.

MAKE THESE!  I had so much homemade applesauce I just had to try this recipe and they are wonderful!  I used cream cheese frosting II, from this site, cut the recipe in half and still had plenty.  These were fantastic!  I love that it uses so little butter and I had all ingredients on hand.  Use the pumpkin spice,  nice Fall treat.  Many compliments when served at a party, but no leftovers.  This is a keeper, thanks Debbi!

Excellent! Nice & Light bars, but we topped them with carmel frosting VI & pecans instead of the recipe frosting since I had no powdered sugar.  The 2 of us polished them off in 1 weekend!

Sweet, mildly spicy, and very harvest-y.  I really liked these and will for sure make them again.  They were so simple to make, made the house smell great, and tasted so good.

These were okay. I thought the icing was kind of gross, so I didn't use it. I think they would be really good with a cream cheese icing. They are very moist and the flavor is decent, but I probably won't go to the trouble of making them again.

These bars were so moist and delicious. They reminded me of spice cake.  I will certainly make them again. Great recipe. The frosting makes them melt in your mouth.

My son is on a gluten free casien free diet, so I changed the flour to a gluten free flour,added some xanthan gum, and used soy butter and milk substitutes where needed. These were great!! My son loves them and they are a great way to get fruit down him.

This recipe makes a fabulous moist cake!  After reading some of the reviews, I doubled it, substituted half the flour with whole wheat flour, used 1 teas cinnamon, 1/4 teas nutmeg, and 1/4 teas of cloves, and one cup of plumped raisins.  I didn't bother with the frosting, which is a good thing.  We would have eaten it that much faster!  I made it again 6 days later for company with the doubled recipe and this time used 1 1/2 cups chopped pecans instead of the raisins, and baked in a Bundt pan.  I served with whipping cream just because I had some.  If prepared and frosted with a cream cheese frosting, it would be hard to stop eating it! 
Also, I was worried the cake would fall in the middle because of all the moisture in it and the fact that we live at 3000ft.  I often have problems with a carrot cake or fresh apple cake.  But it held it shape beautifully!

Easy and Delicious 

I used a 9x9 pan and the bars came out great.  This was a quick make and will be on my list for an Autumn treat.

Made these for my husband's work. They really enjoyed them. They cut up nicely and didn't break apart. Thought they were more of a cake than bar, but they didn't care.

Like some other reviewers, I made it as a cake in a 9 x 9 square pan. It's too dense and heavy to be a cake—would have been better as bars. It had a good taste, but the density was somewhat unappealing.

Really good! Used recipe exactly as written except I I used a a 7x11 pan. Next time will try my 8x8 to make it even thicker. Thought the icing was way too sweet though. I even added some lemon juice and sprinkled nutmeg on top. Will definitely make again. Very moist. Baked at 325• for 30 minutes.

These were absolutely delicious! I made a mistake and put the wrong amounts of sugar and flour but they still came out great. The icing was also delicious. The recipe was different from typical Thanksgiving desserts which I enjoyed. I will definitely make these again!!

Moist, tender, and delicious!   I used a 9x9 pan and the out come was cake like but still able to be held in the hand like a bar. This is a good recipe and I have added it to our favorites.  This bar doesn't need frosting.

I made this with my 3 year old granddaughter and 10 year old grandson. It was a hit! This is easy to make  and so yummy!
We added chopped walnuts.
I didn't have pumpkin pie spice so I used cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg.
Also, I put some vanilla extract in the icing.

Added dried cherries instead of raisins , baked it in a 9x9" dish and frosted it with half a recipe for a cream cheese icing I found in Allrecipes that had grated lemon and lemon juice in it.   Kept them in the fridge.

LOVED these bars! The only change I made was adding a half cup of craisins. The bars were SO moist and flavorful. They didn't need frosting. We had some tonight, 3 days after I made them; they seemed even better than the first day!

Absolutely delicious! I followed the recipe exactly but took others' advice and used an 8 x 8 pan. This is simply a must as they are less than 1" high using that size; can't imagine how thin they'd be if I'd used a 9 x 13. I will definitely make these again!! I might even add some raisins next time.

I just made this along with the cream cheese frosting from all recipes and it is so so delicious. Very very moist. I cooked it and a 8 x 8 pan and it came out just like a cake. I normally do not eat sweets but this is not overly sweet and it is absolutely delicious you don't know what you're missing if you don't make this!

Very good and very moist!!! I used cinnamon instead of pumpkin pie spice (simply because of the thanksging and fall things having pumpkin spice in it) and instead of vanilla I used Goodmans imitation cinnamon to flavor up the icing.  That's why you see a pinkish color.  It was a hit!!!  I plan on using this recipe from now on. Oh. And I am told that when I cook things. I make them look pretty. Lol so yeah. I sliced up a couple apples and garnished this delish dish. Happy cooking!!

I knew this would be phenomenal because the batter was flippin' delicious!!  I doubled the ingredients, except I used 2/3 cup each of brown & white sugar.  I added 2 dollops of vanilla to the batter.  I also didn't have pumpkin spice, so I used 1 heaping tsp cinnamon, 1/2 heaping tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp allspice and 4 shakes of cloves.

This recipe was absolutely delicious! I didn't expect it to taste so good. I did change a couple of things. I used coconut oil becauseI didn't have butter, and I cheated on the frosting, I had caramel dipping sause for apples and a small container of frosting from dominos pizza and I mix them together with a little vanilla. I will definitely be making these again.

Fantastic even without the icing. I just sprinkled on icing sugar as suggested but they would probably be great even without that too. I didn't have any pumpkin pie spice but I made my own by combining 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/8 teaspoon cloves, 1/4 teaspoon ginger, 1/8 teaspoon nutmeg.

These bars really are just a thin spice cake, but they are tasty! I added 1/2c. raisins and used a browned butter frosting. If I make them again I think I'll try to double it, so how that works.

Truly excellent. Easy enough to whip up for a quick dessert anytime, but moist and tasty enough to serve to company along with after-dinner coffee. Frosting is optional - this cake really is that good. We've made it per the original recipe, and also doubled the recipe and baked it longer at a lower temp. It was delicious and beautiful both ways.

Just made these to take to a playgroup and they turned out fantastic! Quick and easy recipe! I used a 9x9 inch pan and instead of the frosting I sprinkled them with powder sugar. Aside from adding 1 tsp of vanilla extract to the batter I followed the recipe exactly. I will definitely be making these again. Next time I may add some raisins or walnuts.

Get the coffee brewing!  I really liked this recipe---probably a little TOO much!  It was very simple to put together, and the cooking time was spot on.  The amount of frosting was just enough to cover the bars with a thin layer, so not overly sweet.  I definitely recommend using unsweetened applesauce, as the sugar-added sorts would be too much sugar.  If you like raisins and walnuts, they would be a nice addition to the batter.  So far, this treat seems to satisfy all ages.  A real keeper!  Thanks for sharing.

These are delicious. I used the Land o' Lakes frosting since I've read a couple of complaints about the one in the recipe, I've also added raisins, chopped walnuts and a bit of cinnamon and  I can't get enough of them! They're moist and sweet and crunchy (thanks to the walnuts and I will definitely make them again.

All I can taste is buttercream icing. It is likely a nice, moist cake, but this icing was way too overpowering.  

Next time I make it I will make it as a thicker cake, and will likely try a cream cheese icing for carrot cake--which would be more suitable.

So good! I use homemade spiced applesauce and add maple flavor to the frosting. I also omitted the pumpkin spice and used the spices that make it up: all spice, nutmeg, ground cloves, cinnamon, ground ginger. It doubles well too!

4 stars because we did not add the frosting. It was already sweet and yummy...and we used unsweetened applesauce. Used half whole wheat  and half all-purpose and added the vanilla to the batter. Yummy. Thanks for sharing.
If you do not have pumpkin spice, you can "google" for homemade, or use a pinch of ginger, some nutmeg, cinnamon, allspice, and cloves.

I didn't really like these.  Not much apple flavor and the bars turn out really thin.  They would probably be better in a 9x9 pan.

A very tasty spice cake bar. Quick and easy to make. I used a 9 x 9 pan and baked for 22 minutes. I had unsweetened applesauce and debated adding more sugar. I didn't and the flavor was perfect.

Nice lightly spicy bar was good with the frosting. I did add a little brown sugar to the frosting as others suggested.  I will try making it in a smaller pan next time.  The bars were very thin.  Would be good with raisins.

It must be the icing (which I didn't use) that made other reviewers rave over them but I was very disappointed in them.  The only thing I did different from the recipe was to use self-rising flour and omitted the baking soda but that would not change the taste which was almost insignificant.  The texture was good though.  After all of the glowing reviews I couldn't wait to make them - what a disappointment.

I used my homemade applesauce with this recipe and it was delicious.  My boys LOVED this dessert and it was so easy to make.  I added raisins and used cream cheese frosting.  It was even more delicious out of the fridge the next morning!  Will definitely make this again.

Very yummy!  These whipped up quite quickly, too.  I used canola oil in place of butter to make lactose free and added 1/2 cup of raisins.  Cooked them in an 8.5 square pan and they were just the right size.  When cut they were like brownie size.  The taste was great and so different than your typical brownie or bar.  They were so moist and flavorful without being too much or too rich.  I did not add the frosting or powdered sugar....none needed.  If you like spiced cake/cookies/hermits then you will like these.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was a very easy, quick snack to make.  I followed the recipe exactly but did NOT frost it.  I felt it was a relatively healthy snack without the frosting.  I dusted them with powdered sugar just to make them look a little more festive.  This is a keeper for our household.

Delicious! I added some chocolate covered raisins and they were the hit of the potluck BBQ. Scrumptious -- moist -- YUMMY!

The first time, I tried these as is.  Moist, Moist, and more moist!  Mom made homemade applesauce so I used that and added store bought to bring my amount to a full 1 cup.  Sweet and spicy I can't really say anything else about them.  I think walnuts and/or raisins soaked in hot water would be good in these.  Next time, I'll try cutting back the sugar since the applesauce already has some sweetness to it.  I'd also like to try substituting oil for the butter and see what that does.

Very good recipe. The cake was very moist and had a nice spice to it. I should have made a bit more frosting though as it was a little thin. I will make this again.

These were great.  I used cream cheese frosting instead of the frosting suggested here.  Tasted just like a spice bar and really easy to make!

I love the simplicity of this recipe. It was more like cake than I expected. Next time I  will use whole wheat flour to make it more substantial. I also took the advice from another review and added raisins after I plumped them in hot water for about 3 minutes. I served them with cream cheese frosting (after the cake had cooled) and everyone loved them.

YUM!! I added a cup of shredded zucchini to these which was wonderful, and I slightly altered the frosting by cutting the sugar back a little and replacing the milk with sour cream. I am making these again as soon as we empty the pan!

First of all, these bars need to go in an 8" X 8" pan. They were very thin. Secondly, they tasted greasy so I wouldn't grease the pan or cut down on the margarine in the recipe. Thirdly, they are extremely moist almost too moist for my liking. I will not make them again.

The frosting is overly sweet.  If you make it - use only 25% to 50% of the frosting and drizzle it - don't spread it.  The bars themselves are very moist and would be good alone, sprinkled lightly with powdered sugar.

These were really addicting! I wanted to make a simple dessert with ingredients I had on hand and thought this would just taste average like many desserts, but my husband and I were surprised by how good this was. I made no modifications other than using butter in the frosting, because I don't have margarine. The texture came out great and it wasn't too crumbly and not too heavy. It is not a bar consistency if you are expecting that. It's more like a cake. It tastes REALLY good served slightly warm.

Added 1 cup rolled oats, used whole wheat organic flour, added raisins, walnuts and cut the brown sugar to 1/2 and substituted stevia for the other half. Lined a 9x13 pan with non-stick aluminum foil (for easy removal) and baked for 23 minutes. Delicious!

Very good.  I used Splenda brown sugar (1/3 cup) and unsweetened applesauce. Then I only frosted half of the pan.  My husband prefers them without frosting, and we have a friend who is diabetic.  They were kind of thin, so next time I might use a 9 x 9 pan. There WILL be a next time!

Delicious and super moist.  I followed the recipe exactly and used my homemade applesauce.  It is very easy to make and tastes great.  I would not change a thing unless you use store bought applesauce which may need some more spices.  My applesauce had a lot of spices already in it.

Yummy! These are so easy to make & so moist & delicious. I did not change the recipe at all and they came out perfect. The only thing I did was take them out of the oven after 20 minutes. I think  25 would've been too long. The icing on the top is delicious. Will definitely make them again.

Yummy!! Like other people I didn't have pumpkin pie spice so I just added a 1/2 teaspoon of ginger, nutmeg and cinnamon. I did not use the frosting because I felt it was sweet enough. It is really yummy and super moist! I baked it in a 9 inch cake pan. It turned out great. I baked it for about 20  minutes

Fabulous! My new favorite cake for fall!! I made it as directed, but I baked it in an 11x7-inch pan for 20 minutes. Turned out perfect and moist. I used the frosting in the recipe, made it with good Mexican vanilla, and I thought it complemented the cake perfectly.

This was absolutely delicious! I halved the recipe and used an 8x8 pan. Also, since the recipe in whole called for one egg, I substituted 1/2 tablespoon of milled flax seed and 4 1/2 teaspoons of water for egg. The result was delicious and moist and got rave reviews. I will definitely use this again! Thank you!

Like other reviewers, I baked this in an 8X8" pan so it was more like a cake.  It was very quick and easy to make and turned out very moist and flavorful.  I followed the recipe except for one minor change - I substituted some of the white flour for whole wheat pastry flour.  I will definitely make this again.

Bland and boring as written.  I suppose the recipe has potential if extras were added such as cinnamon, raisins, and/or diced apple. I made this 1st attempt as stated but didn't add the butter to the topping to keep the fat content down. Not sure if I'd bother tweaking this one or just move on...

Delicious & Moist.  I added a handful of chopped pecans and used a ready-made cream cheese frosting.  The frosting was too sweet and should have been drizzled lightly on top rather than spread on like a cake.  My 10-yr old boy requested I add raisins next time instead of the pecans.

This was just okay.  The frosting was ridiculously sweet, even for frosting.  My husband ate it, but my 2-year old, 6-year old, and I didn't get past the first couple bites.  I might try again without the frosting and use a smaller pan to make thicker bars.  I would also add raisins as other reviewers suggested.  Or I may not try these again at all.  Disappointed.

These were very easy to make but tasted just OK.  I used a 9X9 pan and they were still VERY thin. I cannot imagine using a 9x13 pan.

These were very good and would have been even better with raisins.  I liked that they were moist and the frosting was just enough.

For the holidays, I used only 1/2 cup of applesauce and 1/2 cup mincemeat. Sprinkled powdered sugar on top instead of icing.

Overall a very easy recipe that's tasty and moist!   Treat yourself with a sweet goodie that isn't packed with guilt calories, or fat! My alterations, I reduced the sugar, like I always do, by half tp 1/3 c, added 1/2 c freshly roasted walnuts (just harvest a few months ago from a neighbor) that I pulsed in my mini food processor for a few seconds, added 1 t ground cinnamon, 1 t ground ginger, 1/2 t allspice, 1/8 t ground cloves. I used fresh applesauce from a fresh and ripe Pippin apples, and also added 1 ripe Pippin apple that I shredded to oblivion in the food processor (with skin on). I baked it in an 8x8 pan for about 26 min.  It tasted really good, the mixing of flavors. I chose not to do the icing, as I feel it didn't need for my tastes.  If I had used the frosting, I probably would have reduced the sugar in the icing, so it didn't overpower the flavors in the cake.

1)  I used a 8x8 pan for thicker bars.  I also cooked them for about 30 total minutes.  I cut them so that I ended up with 12 in a pan.   2)  I used cinnamon applesauce because it's all I had. 3)  I added some coconut to the bars when mixing the batter, just because I had some and needed to use it up. 4)  I used Soy Egg Nog instead of Milk in the frosting, and used about 2 tablespoons to get the consistency a little thinner.  These are so good!  I want to dive into the pan!

Very moist and yummy! I usually omit the frosting, and use whole wheat flour because I prefer the flavor. Also, I include cinn. extract (1 tsp) if its in the pantry. I have already made these a few times and there will be many more to come.

I followed the recipe exactly adding some extra ground cinnamon, but I did bake the bars in a smaller pan; there is no way there was enough batter for a 9x13 pan - those would have been VERY thin bars. The bars (or, really, cake, since it had to be eaten with a fork) were moist, slightly crumbly, slightly sweet, slightly spicy, and quite good. I frosted them as instructructed, and my 4-year-old loved them that way, but my husband and I decided we'd prefer them with cream cheese frosting for a more adult taste. In any case, I'll make again.

So I thought - oh how pretty and delicious would it be to add some dollops of homemade applebutter and swirl the top? Yeah, not so great. The actual cake under the applebutter swirl was very good - moist and flavorful. I should have just followed the recipe!

Great recipe. We lightly drizzled the frosting on them and they were delicious. Next time we will probably omit the frosting. You have to have an extra sweet tooth for it but A GREAT RECIPE.

Quick and easy recipe.  Prep/Cook time accurate.  I didn't make any changes - it was good.  I found it to be a very light bar.  Next time I think I'll add some walnuts for a little more substance.

The title was rather deceiving as I was expecting a healthy treat with a hint of sweetness.  These turned out more like a cake with frosting.  Still very good, just wouldn't title them "bars".  I made the bars exactly as written and would definitely make these again, but next time would play around with the ingredients a bit and mix things up.

This was a big hit at an office birthday party.  I didn't get a taste, but everybody else raved about it!  The only change I had to make was substituting cinnamon and nutmeg for the pumpkin pie spice (I forgot to get it while out shopping).  Super easy!

Made this twice and couldn't call either 'bars'.  It was delicious but needed to be eaten with a fork as it wias 'cake'.  I'll make again as family loved it.

These are SOOO tasty! Fluffy and light, these are an especially nice treat for fall time. I made my own pumpkin pie spice (ground allspice, nutmeg, cinnamon, a dash of cloves) and added golden raisins, as well as added a tablespoon or so of brown sugar to the frosting. Delicious! Baked for 20 minutes in an 8x8 glass dish, and by the next day they were gone. I also used sugar-free applesauce and butter.

These were easy to make, and delicious! Easy to customize, as the reviews show. WORD OF WARNING: I made mine using a well-known "crock" vegetable oil spread: they turned out almost BOUNCY! The taste was great, but I'll use stick margarine or butter, next time. I love this recipe!

Tasty! I doubled the recipe and made it more of a cake and made an almond glaze for the top. This was a hit for everyone who tried it.

These were really good and really moist!  I made the recipe exactly as stated and even made the icing, but next time will leave the icing off, because these are so good that they don't need it at all!  Highly recommend and thanks so much for the great recipe!

These are the best bars/cake.  So moist.  I would suggest melting the butter and adding the other ingredients to the butter.  Also made in an 8x8 pan.  Used homemade applesauce.

We loved these.  Baking is my favorite way to spend time in the kitchen, and I always like ways to make baking a little more healthy rather than with tons of sugar and fat.  These are really moist and flavorful.  I did make a cream cheese glaze/icing for them and also added some chopped pecans to the top of the batter before baking, similar to the way I make my carrot cake.  I will make these again and again!

I absolutely love the bars.   Very moist and delicious.   I did add a cup of golden raisins that I soaked in hot water for ten minutes.   I did not like the frosting.  I think a cream cheese frosting would be a lot better.

Followed almost exactly, except added 1/3 cup raisins to the applesauce and let them sit about 10 minutes before mixing it in and made my pumpkin pie spice as per others suggestions. Haven't frosted them yet and don't know that I will! So yummy plain. May just sprinkle with powdered sugar before bringing to a bake sale tomorrow.

I thought this was a great easy bar to make.  I had to use applesauce with cinnamon and it was great addition.  I also didn't have pumpkin pie spice so I used a combination of other spices.  It worked out great, very "spicy"!

Had 4 teens all say this recipe is "fabulous!" and "so moist!" Are you kidding me?? What teen comment is "so moist!!"  I was crunched for time to get them to their dance, so I had to use a store-bought cream cheese frosting instead.  Also doubled the recipe and baked in a 9x13 pan.  Was more like Applesauce Cake, but nonetheless, I agree, it was fantastic!

This was so great! After reading the reviews I decided to add raisins and even without the raisins the flavor and texture was perfect!  Next time I think I'll add walnuts too.  Thank you for this recipe, I will make this again for sure.

What an quick, simple and healthy recipe!  I used 1/2c wheat and 1/2 white flour, egg substitute, and light butter, to even further cut calories.  Bars cooked up nice and moist, with cake like texture.  Delicious, and highly addictive!

These are Great!  I made them for a snack for my son at his swim meet.  I was trying to go a little healthier so I didn't use the frosting.  I also used 1/2 c. all purpose flour and 1/2 c. whole wheat flour.  And I don't have pumkin pie spice so I just threw in a dash or two of cinnamon, allspice, ginger, and nutmeg.  So Good.

These squares definitely are cake and not bars--I didn't have pumpkin pie spice--Used cake spice instead and they turned out well--I like my spice cake spicier so should I make these again I would definitely use some extra spices.  I did make these in a 9x9 pan and baked for 20 minutes.  They were moist and tender.  Also utilized egg beaters in place of the egg.  Would like to try with whole wheat flour and home made apple sauce.  Extremely easy recipe--whipped them up quickly after dinner for a little treat.

These are definitely a 4 if you bake according to the recipe. The frosting is the only thing that made them sweet enough for my taste. I would not just dust them with powdered sugar.  I used a 9x13 pan but doubled the recipe.  I anticipate they will have more flavor after sitting a couple of days. The spice flavor is a little weak.

I made these for my son's Harvest Fest at school and they were awesome! Perfect flavor and moisture, soft, fluffy and addictive. They were extremely easy to make (there was very little mess to clean up), they bake fast and they are foolproof. The recipe is easy enough to be tackled as a kids baking project. I skipped the frosting part and sprinkled confectioners sugar instead. I followed the recipe exactly - I did not and would not change a thing. I will be making these over and over again. Thank you, Debbi, for the wonderful recipe!

Deliciously moist!  The frosting is definitely superfluous and just detracts from the incredible bars/cake/whatever they are.

tasty and popular with my family, this recipe produces a good basic cake.  I frosted mine with homemade cream cheese frosting.  I think caramel frosting would be good with these as well.

I made these with 1/2 the amount of sugar, but you need to add more spice, or they will be a little bland. (for my palate anyway) Nice & easy recipe, but if I wanted something like this again, there is no substitute for real carrot cake!!!

I made this recipe exactly as stated, and it turned out truly delicious.  Made them yesterday and between my husband, son, and a couple friends, the whole thing is gone.  YUM!  A new fall favorite!  This recipe turned out great just the way it was.

My baking powder might have expired given the discrepancy between my ratings and everyone else's, but I am never going to find out. I should have trusted my gut, there wasn't enough batter for a 9x 13 pan either.

These are pretty good bars, and honestly, I don't think they need frosting at all.  They are very moist and spicy, almost like a spice cake.  I did frost them, although not with the frosting called for, bc I have leftover buttercream frosting I am trying to use up.  I agree with other reviewers who suggested cream cheese frosting with these but otherwise they don't need a thing.  I also made in an 8x8 pan.  Thanks for the recipe!

So so good. I made these first in a 9x9" baking dish, added raisins & nuts and left them plain (unfrosted or sugared). Also have made them as cupcakes, frosted with cream cheese icing. They are very moist and satisfying, tasting kind of like an easy version of carrot cake.

Pretty good! Very moist.  Can eat with or without the icing depending on your mood.  It's good both ways.

only thing i changed was the size of the pan.  used a 9x9 and ended up with a wonderfully moist and fluffy spice cake.  it certainly has enough spices... anymore and it would be overkill.  i'd say it's pretty near perfect if you're looking for a nice light spice cake.  eat it plain for calorie/fat awareness or ice it with a great cream cheese frosting or the broiler icing recipe on this site!

This recipe was "ok".  The bar was very thin (i'd definitely put it in an 8x8 pan if i made them again), and the flavor was very mild.  It needs a little more spice to it.  The frosting was very good.

The flavoring was good, but it wasn't what I expected.  I thought it was a true bar bar, but it was more like a cake or muffin. But with that said, it was still very flavoraful.  I also dropped the dough on a cookie sheet and they came out pretty good, cake like but nice and crispy around.

Very yummy and super easy. My 13 year old son put the batter together in about 5 min. Baked this in an 8x8 pan for 30 min and it was perfect. Used 3/4 whole wheat pastry flour and 1/4 white. While it baked, I beat together butter, cream cheese, pwd. sugar, and vanilla to taste, and spread it on as soon as the bars came out of the oven to make more of a glaze. Delicious!

YUMMY!  And so super easy to make - I found that these are ingredients I always have on hand - which is what I was looking for when I discovered it was my turn to bring snack to playgroup at the last minute.  They are light and moist and the kids gobbled them up!  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

A very good cake bar, moist.  I changed the recipe a little.  I doubled the recipe and replaced 1/3 cup of brown sugar with honey and added 1 cup of raisins, and bake the bar in a jelly roll pan, 15x10.  I didn't frost the bars just sprinkled powdered sugar on them.  Everyone enjoyed this bar, will make again.

Excellent...made in a 8 inch brownie pan for a thicker bar....texture was more like a cake. The taste was great even though I did not use the glaze and the amount of spices was right on. I also used my homemade applesauce for this. My family inhaled it. Will definately make again!

These are great - tasting & texture.  After reading reviews, I did add 1/4 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 c. raisins & 1/2 c. coarsely chopped pecans.  I messed up by adding the applesauce at the beginning and was surprised at the thin batter before discovering my mistake, but they turned out fine.  Thought pan size was too large however will try making it right next time before adjusting that. Nothing wrong with the icing - even wished there was more (which would happen with smaller pan). My husband is not a "cake with icing" fan and later noticed he had helped himself to TWO pieces.

The best recipe I've tried from this sight so far. These lasted 20 minutes before they were completely eaten -- a great hit with my family.  I added in cut up dried apples, next time I will try dates or raisins.

I have to say these make the nicest cake type squares I have tasted!  Here are some things I did differently. 

Added Cinnamon Applesauce instead of the regular
Added Cinnamon and Nutmeg instead of the Pumpkin Spice

Icing
Added nutmeg and brown sugar to it, and it made an awesome glaze!  

My 7 year old daughter helped me with it so I KNOW it's easy to make.  She even had the idea for the icing nutmeg.

this is an excellent recipe.  i used a brownie pan (8x8), baked about 5 minutes longer and it came out more like a cake.  it was delicious with powder sugar on top.  i used unsweetened applesauce and subbed half of the flour with whole wheat flour and added a small box of raisins.  so good!  i think i'll make this now instead of pumpkin bread (similar flavor)

These are SO moist and delicious - everyone just loves them...a definite keeper, and one I will make many times over!  Great, too, with walnuts added in. I did not add the icing - just sprinkled confectioner's sugar over the top

I just made these bars with my 4 year old daughter last night.  They were great!! I followed the recipe without the raisins because my little kid doesn't like them, they turned out great!!  Shed loved them and so did my husban who is a little picky with spices.
Thanks for a great recipe.

We thought this was a wonderful recipe.  Church family and coworkers couldn't get enough of the bars.  My husband suggested using the apple bar recipe for the traditional pumpkin cream cheese roll.  We'll have to try it.  The recipe is very cake like (1 1/2 in. thick), might try baking it in jelly roll pan if you are looking for something not as thick.  I did not use the icing, but just dusted with powdered sugar.  The bars are so moist that they absorbed the powdered sugar overnight:)  Still great.  Definately will make again.

Nice and moist. Baking them in a 9x9 pan resulted in 16 cake squares. Instead of frosting, I added chocolate chips on top. They are tasty, but using pumpkin puree instead of applesauce would probably taste better. I will probably try this recipe again

I would give this recipe 5 stars for the versatility, but the pan was FAR too big! I was hoping the dough would rise a lot but it didn't happen. After reading other reviews I would definitly suggest a smaller pan.

They tasted great! I added chocolate chips, omitted frosting, and used extra applesauce instead of the butter to cut down on the fat content.

Very moist and yummy! I added brown sugar to the frosting to add a bit of texture. Would taste GREAT with raisins or nuts as others stated! Great fall cake recipe!

I baked them in a 8x8 pan and topped with a dusting of confectioners sugar.  Delicious, spicy snack cake.  Next time I will try the frosting recipe.

This recipe was OK, but in general I was looking for something a lot richer and denser from a bar. I tried them first without the icing, and then added the icing, and they were much better frosted. I also added more spice (particularly cinnamon) then what was called for.

These are spicy and moist - most of my family really liked them. I found them just a tad too moist. I think next time I'll cut the applesauce by 1/4 cup. Also - this recipe must either be doubled or baked in an 8x8 if you want a respectable bar.

these weren't bars these were like little cake squares. wasnt impressed because they didnt taste like applesauce at all, more like cloves for some reason really and i was expecting cookie-like bars not squares of cake with an over powering flavor. wont be making these again.

..I have been canning apple pie filling and had a few leftover apples to use up.  I came across this recipe and with the help of "Sara's applesauce" made these bars.  Really moist and yummy!  I baked mine in a 7x11 glass dish at 325 for 25 mins.  Just sprinkled conf sugar on top (makes it easier to pack for lunches)..Love the pumpkin pie spice!

I thought these were just okay.  There just seemed to be something missing and they were definitely too thin.  I don't know if I will make again, but if I do, I will double the recipe and add a little something more.

I’m not sure what applesauce bars are SUPPOSED to be like, but I have never tried it before, and even though I really like the TASTE, I’m not so sure about the texture- it definitely is very moist, maybe too moist.
I didn’t have any pumpkin pie spice so I used a pinch of cinnamon, a pinch of clove and a pinch of nutmeg. I don’t think I’ll try these again…

This broke up a bit when I took it out of the pan. My fault I couldn't have greased it well enough. I managed to salvage about two thirds of it and topped with confectioners sugar instead of frosting. Very spicy. Will try again and grease the tin more. Thanks.

I didn't have pumpkin pie spice, so i used half cinnamon and half nutmeg. It made it taste like banana bread. These are really more of a cake than a bar. Good though.

These were pretty good but did not have a whole ton of flavor.  Some people thought that it was gingerbread-probably because it had the same color.  It was good but nothing amazing so I probably won't make it again.

These were awesome, with perfect sponginess!  I used half the icing and they were plenty sweet.  Bet they'd be good even without the icing for those without a sweet tooth.

These bars are "YUMMY", not too sweet.  Friends and family really enjoyed the changes I made.  I doubled the receipe and baked in 9X13.  Served with real whipped topping and fresh mixed berries I sweetened with Conf. Sugar.  Love them every time.  I think I'll add sliced apples to the batter next time!!

YUMMY!!  I doubled the recipe and baked it in a 9X13 pan to make it a cake.  Served it at our cook-out and it was a hit!  (It waaay out-ranked the lemon bars and choc/PB chip cookies.)  It's moist yet light and the pumpkin pie spice really sets it off.  I'll make this one over and over again.

My daughter took these to school for "Apple Week".  The kids loved them!  I dusted the bars with confectioners sugar, and they were great!  Next time, I'll sprinkle them with sugar just before serving.  They were so moist that the sugar dissolved quickly.  Delicious!

Wow! This was wonderful!  It stayed moist for three days...then it was long gone.  The only change/substitution I made was using Wildtree Herbs' Apple Pie Spice Blend rather than Pumpkin Pie Spice.  I did double the recipe, in order to make a cake out of it.  Fantastic!

Moist & tasty, not too sweet (unless you use the frosting, which is good but best spread thinly).

This is an awesome recipe!  I left off the icing and dusted with powdered sugar.  I also added some chopped pecans.  It's not too sugary, and great for using up some frozen apples I had.

These were excellent. I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of skipping the frosting. Yes, they are thin compared to most bar cookies, but they taste wonderful.

I was craving something like this (well, I was craving carrot cake, but I just didn't feel like making it) and this satisfied the craving.  Hubby must've liked them, too, since I think I got to eat 2 squares and he had the rest.

This was an excellent recipe - easy to make and simply wonderful tasting.  I made 2 pans and my family cleaned them up in 2 days.
