I'm not a big fan of marmalade, but this is delicious.  I did take the liberty for a small tweak.  Batch #2 I sliced rather than quartered the kumquats.  The family agreed we preferred the texture in the second batch

Second time to make this. I’ve made 2 batches this year. 8 cups each time. I reduced the water to 3 cups for 8 cups fruit. Thicker and yummy.

I made this with maple sugar. I'm not sure why this doesn't include the pinch of cayenne that is called for in the video or the star anise pod, but it should. I used a cinnamon stick instead of the star anise pod. I liked it, but it tends to irritate my mouth after eating it for a couple days. It's good, but I'm not sure that it is worth the trouble.

I've made kumquat marmalade for the past 3 years, but couldn't find my recipe.  This one was much easier than the others I've seen.  Most jellies/jams say to stay with the recipe's measurements, but because this has no added pectin I doubled the recipe.  It turned out great, but only produced 3 small jelly jars.  Next time I will quadruple.  I use the entire kumquat (except the seeds).  Your kumquats need to be fresh picked or can be kept in the refrigerator for probably up to a week.  They dry out quickly if left at room temperature.  This was the first year both my kumquat and my Meyer lemon tree produced, so I used them.  They are not as tart and substantially larger and juicier than storebought lemons which offset the tartness of my kumquats.  Some kumquats are sweeter, so you would want to use regular lemons with those.   I left out the spices, as I've tried spiced recipes in the past and didn't care for it.  It was so good, I'm ashamed and yet proud to say that my husband and I ate 2/3 of a jar the day I made this recipe.   Also, this recipe doesn't mention it, but if you want to store them in the cabinet, cover the filled jars with hot water, bring to a boil, and boil for 5-10 minutes.  Then remove.  After they cool, check to ensure they sealed by pressing in the center of the lid.  If it pops, it's not sealed and you would need to store that one in the refrigerator.

Delicious recipe! It's worth all the labor of cutting and trimming because the end result is so good! I preferred julieanne cutting the kumquats instead of quartering and I fined using scissors to trim the inside easier than cutting it off with a knife. I would make this again. Thank you Chef John!

My kumquats were a little on the sour/bitter side, so I had to increase the sugar just a bit. This recipe is perfect though, and definitely a keeper for any marmalade lover. :)

Easy recipe but lots of prep time for kumquats.  Used more zest because I like the appearance and texture.  FYI, one cup prepared fruit translates to about one cup of finished preserves.  One serving is 2 weight watchers points.

Ohmygosh. This recipe is fantastic. Everyone in my house loved it, even the marmalade-haters. Cleared out my kumquat tree but I’m saving it for next season. Now I know why I grow kumquats!

I didn't have the anise star, so I added a little cinnamon.   It was a good simple recipe that produced a beautiful and tasty marmalade.  With that said, the kumquats are very time consuming to prepare, so I'm not sure I would make this again.

Incredible recipe. I made this with orangekuats from my parents tree. I also added some of the vanilla sugar that I had made. Yum. 
Next up. Using the marmalade on empire biscuits.

I have made two batches.  The tedious parts are removing the seeds and chopping.  I am going to try to incorporate a food processor hopefully to simplify the process/  I have a tree full of kumquats with which to experiment.
Don't omit the cayenne pepper - a pleasant sting to the taste :)

I like the addition of cayenne pepper for a small bite but it needed a LOT more sugar. Guess my fruit was more on the tart side. Didn't have any anise seed - I'll try this next time.  Thanks

I skipped the cayenne pepper and lemon as I'd read another receipe that said to put all the pips into a muslin while softening the rind to extract the pectin.  Otherwise pretty much followed this recipe.  The video showing how to chop the Kumquats was great, the actual process is exhausting.  The marmalade was delicious however so I guess all good things take a little time.  Flavour and colour of this this is amazing.
