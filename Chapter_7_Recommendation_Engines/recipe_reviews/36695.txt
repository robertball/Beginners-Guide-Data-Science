This recipe tasted alright--but I'd not recommend it.  The flavors were okay, but the pasta was too dry.  I added two dollups of sour cream to the salad, and it improved it greatly.

great "starting off" dish- I added a can of chicken broth and some white wine so I'd have more sauce.  Skipped the capers (forgot to buy) and added some hot pepper flakes, and salt and pepper to taste.  Was happily surprised hubby liked it so well, with all the greens, and no meat!

Great, healthy recipe!  Quick and easy, and my boyfriend and I both loved it!  Add extra kalamata olives and balsamic vinegar for a little more flavor.
