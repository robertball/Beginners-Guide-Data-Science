Very easy to make and clean up! We really enjoyed it, the only think I might do different next time is to put a little taco seasoning in the meat mixture or something to make it taste a little more mexican. I also added onion to the meat, which was really yummy. I definately will make this recipe again. :)

Good basic recipe, and I used this along with the inspiration from some other recipes on this site and the result was better than the canned enchilada sauce.  I sautéed diced onions and garlic in olive oil until tender, then added diced tomatoes, Pace Picante sauce, cumin, diced jalapeños and simmered until cooked down.  I then placed this in a blender and pureed it into a sauce.  Turned out beautifully.  Will make again.

This recipe was "too simple to be good" I thought.  But it WAS GREAT!  My family & I loved it.  I could prepare the beef and ingredients ahead of time so it was quick to pop in the oven when we got home.

I made this for the first time to bring to a church buffet dinner tonight.  Everyone raved about it and I brought home an empty 12 x 15 casserole dish!  I used the basic recipe and only added some refried beans which I put in the wraps before adding the meat mixture.   I will definitely be making this more often.

I've made this twice now (just started eating the second batch). Maybe I'm easily pleased, enchilada-wise, but this is pretty good for being a simple recipe. I made it exactly as written, using 6-inch corn tortillas. The first time I used Pace's "hot" version and shredded cheddar. I like "hot" foods, but it just didn't seem quite right here. The second batch, I used Pace's "medium" sauce, and "Mexican blend" cheese. These options made it noticeably better. Great stuff!

I added sour cream, tomatoes and lettuce as you would for tacos.  This makes this dish or better.

I make this with ground turkey instead of ground beef, and it's still a wonderful recipe! I enjoy it more with the flour tortillas than with the corn. The corn tortillas gave a kind of "sour" taste that I didn't enjoy. I've used this recipe several times, and will continue to enjoy it. I do believe, after some research, that Picante Sauce is just another name for Salsa, so a nice salsa would also do the trick.

Good, simple recipe. It's easy to add extras that you may have on hand. I added sliced bell peppers and onions, and used ground turkey since it's leaner.

These were good, but I needed to spice them up a bit.  I added onions and a packet of taco seasoning to the meat.  I also added a can of diced green chilis.  Without the added seasoning they would have been bland.

this was quick and easy.  The one thing I want to make a note on is that I normally don't care Picante sauce on hand, it's always salsa. So I used my Pacy Chunky Salsa and I added more then stated in the recipe because of the chunks. But my family loved it. And I could totally add onions in the ground beef while it's cooking. But for fast, quick, easy and simple. It's a winner. I'm glad this recipe says corn or flour. I prefer corn, it's what I was raised on when it comes to enchiladas. This recipes is very very versatile and simple so it's a winner in my books.

This was very tasty for so little effort!  This recipe takes no time at all and made everyone at my table happy.  Although using a pre-made salsa felt a little like cheating on the recipe, it's easy to adjust for different tastes--mild, medium, or spicy.  I would definitely make this again.

4 stars but only because the pace sauce needs to be "hot" and use half pepper jack cheese and cheddar.

Can also stir other items into the filling such as black beans and corn....turned out great.  No left overs on this one!

Easy. Not bad for a fast meal. I added seasoning to the meat as I cooked it (onion, garlic, oregano, cumin, salt) and Salt Lick Restaurant salsa. I scaled this down to use a quarter lb of beef and got 4 enchiladas from this. While these were okay and I would eat them again, this recipe by no means compares to enchiladas that use a homemade enchilada sauce rather than a salsa and more seasoning in the beef besides just the salsa. This is a good base though for a beginning cook to follow and obtain acceptable results.

This was very good for how easy and simple it was.  I only had a jar of store brand picante sauce on hand, but it was still a really good flavor.  My only additions were ground turkey instead of ground beef and I sprinkled it with 1-2 tbl of taco seasoning mix (from this site).  Will add this to my list of quick dinner ideas.  Thanks!

For a quick enchilada dinner it's not bad. I'm confused if the "enchilada" sauce in the description is actually the pace picante sauce or not.  I served this w/ spanish rice.

This was terrific. I added a chopped onion and a chopped up tomato as I browned the hamburger, and then added a packet of taco seasoning. I always like to slip some veggies in when I can. Outstanding and so easy!

LOVED this recipe! So easy! Gave it 4 stars instead of 5 only because I added to the recipe a little. I added diced onions and green peppers in with the ground beef, and 1 pkg of taco seasoning to the meat along with the salsa. I also added fresh jalapenos when I put the meat in the tortilla! I Make this all the time!!

This is the first time to make enchiladas though I've been cooking for my family for almost 40 years. Wanted a simple recipe. I must say this basic recipe is quite tasty. Only two changes - used mild Picante Sauce and left it in the oven approximately 8 minutes longer to firm up the tortillas & to brown the cheese up a little. I coupled this with the allrecipes recipe for Aztec Salsa - which is a perfect match-up to the enchiladas and fresh red grapes as a dessert.

I used red enchilada sauce instead of picante sauce. Also, never use flour tortillas, only corn since flour tortillas turn gooey when cooked in sauce. The meat is rather bland so I used a packet of Taco Bell taco seasoning, diced onions, and a can of chopped chiles to give the meat some personality. It was wonderful and well received by the family.

This is pretty quick and easy. I did make a couple of alterations. I added onion and some Rotelle to the beef. A little salt and pepper, and it was pretty good. I'll make this again.

I've been making this recipe for a few years now, and it's a family favorite. The only change I make, is after draining the grease from the ground beef I return it to the stove top, and add some taco seasoning with a little water. Simple and easy to make, kids will love it.

I made this recipe exactly as written, thinking that the simplicity of its ingredients would make it more appealing to my three children. But alas, my kids didn't like it, and my husband and I thought it was rather a dull recipe.

I made this for our neighborhood block party, and people wouldn't stop talking about how amazing it was. I was surprised because it was so simple! The only change I made was to add a can of refried beans to the meat. I will definitely be making this regularly for my family.

I added white onions and I mixed Pace Picante mild and medium sauces. Nice quick easy dinner. :-)

This recipe was surprisingly good. I added a half of a sweet onion, chopped, to the ground beef while it was browning along with regular ground black pepper, no salt.  I used a large can of old El Paso red enchilada sauce instead of Pace, but otherwise followed the recipe. It took about 30 mins to bake. My family loved it and all agreed no taco seasoning was needed. I'll make this one again!

I added a 10 oz can of Rotel instead of picante sauce to the meat and it had more flavor.  Works with any pre-cooked leftover meat on hand-chicken, ground beef, turkey or pork. Good basic recipe to customize.

Absolutely simple and delicious!  Made exactly as written, but used medium salsa instead of picante sauce (as that is what I had on hand) and Kraft Habanero shredded cheese for a little heat...it was fantastic and hubs asked me to make this on a regular basis!  I definitely will, for sure :-)

I sautéed half cup of chopped onions and half cup of chopped bell pepper with the hamburger. Took out the grease & added 1.5 cups of Pace Salsa with taco seasoning mix. Added 1.5 cups of shredded cheese and a quarter cup of sliced olives. Heated the corn tortillas to make them pliable, filled them with meat mixture and rolled them up. Covered them with canned enchilada sauce, shredded cheese & sliced olives. Covered the pan with foil & baked for 20 minutes. It was easy & fast! Everyone loved them!

I mostly followed the recipe, but did make one change. I used enchilada sauce instead of Pace, because we hate Pace. I fried the corn tortillas briefly in oil, about 2-3 seconds per side. This makes them much easier to roll, and they don't absorb all the sauce. I added another 1/2 cup of cheese to the filling mix, because we love cheesy enchiladas.  Adding extra cheese shouldn't count as a recipe change, it's an enhancement! This rates 5 stars with enchilada sauce instead of Pace, because it so very simple and delicious, with only a few ingredients. Enchiladas shouldn't be an all-day affair, after all. I only made 4 enchiladas, and will use the remainder of the filling tomorrow night, tossed with macaroni, I think. That should be yummy! **UPDATE** I used some of the leftover filling today for a burrito. Heat the filling, warm the tortilla, grate a little more cheddar. I used about 3T filling in a 10" tortilla, added a bit of cheese, then wrapped it carefully. The filling is much wetter than you'd normally want, but just don't overdo the filling and wrap carefully, it'll work fine. Beefy Burrito Perfection in under 5 minutes! It may even be better for burritos than for enchiladas. Seriously, it's that good.

I have never left a negative review before but this was just not good.  It was dry and poorly flavored.  I used corn tortillas and ground turkey.  I'm not sure why as I followed directions but I will not make this again.

I really love this recipe.  I used the advice from others and added a pack of taco season to the meat and boy was this fantastic and extra yummy!  I also don't bake for 20 min.  I usually leave it in for about 15 min and it turns out perfect.
