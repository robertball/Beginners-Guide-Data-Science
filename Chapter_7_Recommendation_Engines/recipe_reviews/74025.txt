This is a fast and easy recipe. I changed it a little and added ingredients that I already had in my frig. I used oyster sauce to give it a little sweet flavor. I also used ground beef instead. The mushrooms & tofu really go well together. My family really enjoyed it.

This was a great base...I too changed it a bit. I didn't have chili sauce so I added chili flakes, yellow pepper, diced zucchini, reg mushrooms. I added tumeric to my rice...it was nummy!

This was nice for a change but it needed a bit of tweaking for flavour.  I added an extra tablespoon of pepper sauce and one more of tamari.  Next time I will add extra green onions and maybe more mushrooms.  thanks!

Really liked this recipe but I did end up adding a bit more Asian chili sauce and I used soy sauce instead of tamari and used 4 tablespoons.

This reminded me slightly of sweet & sour.  It definately isn't as sweet or sour as traditional, but there is a resemblance.  :D  I subbed chow mein noodles for the rice.  No mushrooms so went with regular onions & more green onions.  'Think extra firm tofu would've been a better choice, but firm was good, too.  Package of ground pork was a pound ... so ... ya know.  Chow mein noodles were good with adding crunch, but more vegs should do that, too.  Oh, subbed regular soy for tamari.  It's thinner, but similar.

Good basics here, I also added some sliced sweet peppers (color and texture), doubled the sauce and added some hoisin to it as well, a drizzle of sesame oil and some shaved ginger. Tasty!
