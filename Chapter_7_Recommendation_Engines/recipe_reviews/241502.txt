made it as written.  Usually I modify recipies.  This is spot on!  Blended it in a bullet blender.  Make sure to chop the garlic first.  Topped salad with feta and olives-made with lemon greek chicken-great together!

Nice! I used white balsamic vinegar (I prefer it to the regular), and just shook everything up in a jar b/c I was too lazy to pull our the food processor, lol. Nice combo of flavors and very tasty on our dinner salads tonight. I would make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

So easy to make with few ingredients for an excellent balsamic dressing! I only did half of the oregano, which I'd do again. I don't like when one spice overpowers anything. My balsamic vinegar was very good quality, so that may make a difference.  It doesn't make a large amount, so I would double the recipe the next time. This is a keeper and thanks!

I have made this so many times! prefer white balsamic. I also use maple syrup in place of the honey. Basil is also a great addition. I just dump everything into a bowl using a stick blender to emulsify.

I think this is the best balsamic vinaigrette recipe I have ever tried. The only change I made was using white balsamic vinegar because that's all I had. I too didn't want to drag out the food processor, so I used my salad shaker jar and shook it vigorously. The salad dressing ingredients combined beautifully using this method.

We had stuff for salad but silly me forgot to pick up a dressing I like. I found this and had everything for it, so I made it and threw it on top of a salad with dried cranberries, slices of tomato and crunchy jalapeno. It was quite yummy. I will definitely make it again.

This was ok.  I took the suggestion of some previous reviewers and halved the oregano.  Next time I will use the full amount, but halve the dijon mustard.

I would give it 10 stars if I could.  I doubled the recipe, which I recommend since it does not make a lot.  I put in 1/4 tsp of salt for a double recipe. And used sugar instead of honey.  It was perfect.

love this! I make it often. Sometimes, I use a bit of sugar if I'm out of honey. Delicious! I just whisk it with a fork if I don't want to pull out the blender or food processor.

I tripled the recipe and put in the exact measurements, but maybe I left it run in the food processor too long and it was so thick I kept having to add more vinegar until the flavor was diminished.  I'll serve it to my guests tonight and hope they don't need a spoon to get it out.  Nice flavor.

Simple and yummy - I make this all the time.  I just put it all in a glass jar with lid and shake the heck out of it, rather than dirtying up my food processor.  It's best if you mix it up an hour or two ahead of time so the garlic mellows a bit.

This was a little stronger and darker than the picture looks but really good. Put it over roasted veggies.

I used pink Pure Himalayan Ancient Sea Salt, only because I had a jar of that on hand. Very nice blend of flavors!

I've been on a mission, for some time now, to find the perfect homemade balsamic dressing...mission accomplished! This is, by far, the best I've found yet. So simple, yet so good. Besides using a bit less oil, I followed the recipe as written. Would be awesome with white balsamic too. Thanks for the recipe, this is definitely a keeper!

This dressing is very good. Next time I will make it with white balsamic though.  It didn't last long in the fridge which is always a good sign!

I didn't have any red balsamic vinegar so used white balsamic instead. It was excellent! Will make again.

Delicious! I used half the balsamic because I wanted a mild dressing and it was great.

No changes to this recipe and it was really delicious! The combination of all the ingredients was spot on.  I used 18 year balsamic vinegar and regular EVOO (with a slash of herb olive oil). This is my new favorite salad.

Easy to make. I used white balsamic.  Best if made at least a day ahead to allow flavours to meld.  I am not big on salt but thus does need a bit.
