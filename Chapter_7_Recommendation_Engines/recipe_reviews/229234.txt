Unfortunately I think the name of this recipe is a little misleading and doesn't do the dish justice.  Chicken isn't even mentioned and is a glaring omission.  Still, as this recipe's first reviewer I couldn't be more pleased to say how much I enjoyed this.  It has so many good things going on - chicken, artichokes, black olives, zucchini.  It would take a lot to make this dish go wrong! Given there is chicken in this "salad," I made a main dish of it.  I also chose to serve it hot rather than chilled.  I sauteed the chicken  and zucchini separately, adding fresh minced garlic, salt and pepper.  I combined that with the remaining ingredients along with some fresh chopped parsley and grape tomatoes . Score!  It really was a flavorful medley of well-chosen, compatible ingredients!  Not sure I'd like this as much chilled, but that of course could just be a subjective preference.   I  also think this would have been over the top tossed with a good  pasta.

This "salad" was amazing. I agree that it's more of a main dish, and I also added garlic (just a given in my household). I also left out the beans cause the kids don't care for them. I tried it by itself and highly recommend trying this. Afterwards we served the leftovers wrapped in a warmed pita with some creamy dressing. Very good as a wrap too. Will make this again and again :)

Really good.  I used less of the veggie/salad ingredients because I wanted to make sure it was hearty enough for a main dish for two, and even with two chicken breasts we easily had enough for four servings.  I also served it warm because it seemed strange to have cold zucchini in a dish.  But, the next day I took leftovers for lunch and ate it cold, and it was even better!  Either way, this recipe will become part of our regular rotation.  Thanks for sharing!

As is, this summer salad is pretty good. Following the recipe to a T will result in a refreshing summer dish. I tasted it as prepared and then I made some changes that made it out of this world for me and my family. I cut the zucchini into smaller cubes so that everything would be about the same size. I also seasoned the chicken breast with garlic powder and Mrs. Dash Italian Blend in addition to the salt and pepper. (It is my favorite!) Instead of grape or cherry tomatoes I used sun dried. This felt very Mediterranean, so I added some roasted red bell pepper strips. Both of these were the perfect addition.  Fresh Parmesan and a dash of bold olive oil did the trick. I have munched on this for two days with nothing additional and zero guilt.

I've made this a few times...if you'd like some carbs, I have done it with brown rice and with whole wheat bow tie pasta and also with quinoa. When I use quinoa, I also add diced avocado because it makes for an incredible texture combination.

This was pretty good.  I actually think it would be better served hot....maybe with fresh crumbled bacon.

Very nice and easy dinner salad.  Had pepperoncini peppers screaming at me in my fridge so chopped up a few of those and wish I had some grape tomatoes to add as well.   As I am a garlic fiend, added 3 minced cloves to the zucchini and added more olives.  A simple green salad on the side and dinner is ON!!!

I made this recipe without the chicken. When I had it for lunch I thought it was not good at all as a cold salad. I believe it would be much better warmed. The other reviews mentioned eating it warm instead, I will plan to do that when I eat more of it. I believe that way it will be a good vegetable side dish because these are all good ingredients together.

I removed the chicken and cheese to make it more veggie focused. Served it warm as a side dish. It was good even with these omissions and changes.

Thoroughly enjoyed this salad and it's a great way to use the abundance of zucchini coming out of my garden.  I sliced the chicken before cooking it and bought sliced olives.  I liked a vinegar and oil dressing with it.  My mom used mayo and my husband enjoyed it without any dressing.  Heading  to the store to get the necessary ingredients to make it again tonight.

I added 1 tsp of confetti pepper while tossing it all together, skipped the salt and the oil. Everyone who ate it said it was great.

Thought it was fairly tasteless - needed an italian dressing at least.  Great ingredients though.

I thought just salt and pepper would be a bit bland so I seasoned the chicken with onion powder, paprika, lemon pepper and Italian seasoning in addition to the s&p.  I also sauteed the zucchini with a clove of minced garlic. I'm glad I did the extra seasoning because the salad still lacked some flavor.  However it did make for a nice mild, refreshing meal for a hot summer night.  I also realized too late that I was out of olives so I will definitely make it again with them.  I think making it into a pasta salad with an Italian dressing would be delicious as well.

There are cherry tomatoes in the photo of this recipe, but none listed in the ingredients.  I added the cherry tomatoes in and also a large clove of  garlic mashed to a paste with sea salt.

I made it as described and found it very bland since it calls for no seasoning. If I made it again, I'd add a vinegarette or something.
