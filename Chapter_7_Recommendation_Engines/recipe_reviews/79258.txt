I added a few things to the crab meat to give it more flavor and stretch it out further; 1/2 cup of sliced green onions, 1/2 cup of chopped water chestnuts, 1/2 cup juliened carrots.  This allowed me to use 24 egg rolls instead of a mere 15.  I baked mine for 15 in a 400 degree oven (turn 1/2 through cooking) so they won't end up greasy.  The dipping sauce has fablous flavor, would definetly make it for more than just these eggrolls.

We loved these!  I think I'll follow the other raters review and add some stuff to make the crab go farther.  Also, the crab in the bag works fine for these if you don't have a grocery nearby that sells lump crab.  The sauce is great!

I am giving 5 stars! Other ratings are not fair. You can't bake these in the oven and think they are the same as fried. Don't rate a recipe unless you follow the instructions as written. Thank you!

I think I did these wrong, but followed the recipe fairly closely. The sauce was horrible and watery, and baking these produced a floury, really awful tasting item.  I don't know what I did wrong. Deep frying would have been a huge improvement.

BP3,  the directions say that you are supposed to deep fry them in a dutch oven. A dutch oven is not actually an oven, it's a pot you fry them in, THEN you put them in the actual oven to keep warm after frying.  5 stars,these were delicious.

Great simple recipe. I would also add to the crab to stretch it and change the flavor slightly. Just not so much as to cover the crab taste. Maybe a tbsp Old Bay or some chopped garlic chives. Also use a whipped egg  to seal the seams. This helps if you need to delay frying.

After reading the reviews I decided to add chopped water chestnuts and sliced green onion to my filling to make it go further. These turned out really good. The sauce was a bit stout and on the spicy side but still good. I recommended doubling the sauce if you plan on having enough to go around for each egg roll. The pink chili sauce found in the Asian section of your supermarket would be a great dipping sauce for these too. It would compliment the crab nicely.
