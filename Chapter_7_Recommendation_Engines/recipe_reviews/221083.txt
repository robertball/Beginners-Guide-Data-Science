2 cucumbers and 1 bottle of dressing was plenty! I used pickled banana peppers because that is all we have in my area. They worked great. Overall this is a great recipe and I loved the fact that it didn't call for mayo but I do feel some of the veggies need scaled back as to not overshadow the pasta.

I had banana peppers, bell peppers and cucumbers in my garden this year so I used them in this pasta salad. It came out great. I only used one bottle of salad dressing, that seemed to be enough.
