I was a little intimidated to try French Macarons, but this recipe, especially after the first batch, was pretty easy.  The cookies came out beautifully and were delicious!  A big hit at our granddaughter's 12 birthday party.

I made them, but they came out a little misshapen. They are delicious, but they did not look like the picture. They were very flat and were cracked.

This recipe does not specify that I should have allowed them to sit for 15-30 minutes, weather dependent. My macaroons cracked (all of them) and the 50 rotations of the spatula is not enough. You need to specify that the consistency should be “glue” like as long as the air from the egg whites is not pushed out. Thanks.

I was so nervous trying to make these, I have always been intimidated by Macarons, but I decided to just do it and I’m so glad I did!! These are delicious, I used lemon extract instead of vanilla for the filling to add a little punch of flavor. I also learned that I should let the batter rest for 20-30 minutes, the first batch I put in the oven cracked, but the second batch didn’t, so I’ll be keeping that in mind for the next time I make these!! If you’re an amateur baker who is terrified to try Macarons, don’t be!! These rock!

I am so very sorry. I wrote a review earlier and it was for a different recipe. I found this one that looks so much better than the one I started. Having more than one recipe open at one time though caused confusion and I posted the wrong review. This recipe looks great and I'll probably try it one I've gotten almond flour. Can't wait!

The eggs wouldn’t peak no matter what so I had to skip that part, but make sure you make the cookies SMALL because they expand after you get them on the baking sheet and sometimes join together. Also, my first batch burned using 9 minutes so I did 6 and 6 instead. They taste delicious though.

A very simple recipe for making French Macaroons. Just be mindful to add the granulated sugar with egg whites and not the rest of the dry ingredients.

My kids love macarons, but they are soo expensive.  My skill level when it comes to baking is newbie.  I used this recipe, but watched YouTube videos to learn the pointers and how to fold the ingredients.   After piping on to parchment paper let it sit for 40 minutes before baking.  Making sure to bang the pan on the countertop to get the bubbles out before baking.
Overall good recipe.   The flavor is good.  Not too sweet.

This recipe was easy to follow, though laborious in terms of time expenditure.  It was well worth the time to see my family enjoy my first endeavor into this French delight.  I added matcha as both a flavoring and coloring to avoid using food coloring . That added flavor was appreciated and enjoyed.

It was a good recipe, but they could've been prettier. I added some orange coloring and flavoring.

Made these exactly as written and they were really good!  They didn’t come out like the macarons I buy in a patisserie... but they’re so pretty, I think they’ll make a nice gift or bake sale item.

I made this with my 9 and 13-year-old children, and they frankly did most of the work.  This is a very well-explained recipe.  Thank you for the tip about coloring dough at the egg step.  Very helpful!

One note: The filling in this recipe was a little too buttery for us, so we turned it into a normal buttercream by doubling the powdered sugar. We then put vanilla extract in 1/3, almond extract in 1/3, and cocoa powder in 1/3.  

They don't look perfect, because it was our first attempt, but they taste heavenly!

I think the buttercream might make it a little too sweet. thinking next time I will try the filling will a dollop of raspberry jam to tart it up a little to cut how sweet it is. other than that I love this recipe! this was my first time making Macarons and it's not as intimidating as I originally thought.  if you follow the recipe to the T, they come out great! the only think I did differently was take them out of the oven about two minutes early.
