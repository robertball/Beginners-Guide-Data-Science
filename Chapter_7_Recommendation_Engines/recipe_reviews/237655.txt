Yummy, moist, easy peasy. I used Bobs Red Mill baking mix for the flour, coconut oil, and extra thick coconut milk. Cut out half a cup of sugar. Added 2 tbsp of lemon juice at the end because it seemed to be too sweet. Baked in a torte pan so it took an extra 10 minutes or so. Popped it out and Shook some powdered sugar on top. It was a hit. Have made it twice now.

Really tasty. Made w coconut oil, coconut milk and tried with suggested sugar and reduced sugar (1cup) and whatever coconut I had on hand and always turn out great. Freezes well, does well with icing and I'm sure does well with nuts although I haven't done one with nuts yet. This one gets written on a card and goes in my sacred personal recipe book with my grandmas recipes.

An excellent recipe, my bff has celiac and I'm always looking for recipes she can have, or that I can convert so that she can have. I'm crazy about coconut, so I made the cake with 1/2 ap gf flour and 1/2 coconut flour. I also added coconut extract/flavoring, and used coconut sugar, which isn't as sweet as regular white sugar. I made it in my bundt pan and served with coconut/maple strawberries with whipped cream. Everyone enjoyed it. This was my second time making it, and I have shared it.

Everyone who had this at Thanksgiving loved this.  I made no changes but was shocked at the cost of xanthan gum.  Whole Foods actually gave me a sample when the guy helping me saw I only needed a tsp and the bag was $14.00. I love that store, they are very helpful and will seek their advise again when making something to take to friends who are gluten free.

This was amazing. Made it for my father in law for his 81st birthday. He’s insanely picky, offensively honest and he wanted a coconut cake. I have a 3y/o with celiac so I figured I had to make the cake. She helped me. We used coconut oil and we sifted the dry stuff. It was SO good! Not only did my father in law declare that it was the best ever, but now I’m on request to make one for everyone’s birthday, even the people who didn’t like coconut cake to begin with!

Very good! I did cook cake five mins less for ultra moistness. For the icing I used buttercream and added coconut extract. Yum!!

Great recipe as it is both gluten & dairy free. I took it to a dinner party and the guests loved it.. I placed Saskatoon berries between the layers and made a Saskatoon berry sauce and added a dollop on each serving along with whipped cream for those who love their dairy.
My frosting was also dairy free as I used coconut milk and marg..
I also found a recipe for coconut milk whipped cream that I will make next time..
Thanks for the base recipe for so many new dessert variations.

Followed the  recipe without nuts and made it with King Arthur GF Flour. I used two 9" rounds and it baked in 20 min. (as the recipe stated)  I give it 5 stars for texture and the cake baked perfectly (a challenge for those of us who need to bake GF).  Unfortunately, it lacked flavor and was really bland. Maybe it really needs frosting which I didn't have on hand.  I will definately try again (maybe adding more coconut and/or sugar and/or frosting). Thank you for posting GF recipes!

Made this on a whim, since I had most of the ingredients and expecting company for dinner.  Changed a couple things.  I used a gluten free flour pre-mix, 1 cup coconut sugar and 1/4 cup raw honey for sweet.  Also did the coconut oil as one review recommended.  Used sliced almonds instead of walnuts.  A dash of nutmeg  might have been good too.  I used 1-1/4 c. of the "lite" canned coconut milk.  My coconut is unsweetened and toasted, giving a rich dark flavor, more caramel in color and taste.  More vanilla was used, about 1 T. of Bourbon Vanilla.  This was done after 35 max. min. cook time and fragrant.  A little bit dry, not bad, probably because I cooked it 35  min.  Will do less next time.  Couldn't let it cool down to try a bite plain.  I don't do frosting, instead I use a dollop of fresh Greek Honey-Caramel- Vanilla yogurt, or frozen yogurt.  A lite non dairy whip would be great also.  My cake is very caramel in color, due to darker ingredients no doubt.

I FINALLY have a “go to” cake. Besides being incredibly easy to make, this cake was insanely delicious! I am dairy free and for years I’ve struggled to make a dessert my family likes. They loved this cake! Everyone went back for seconds, even my dad who only likes supermarket bakery cakes full of bad chemicals and dairy! Plus it’s gluten free. No one even believe me. 
Anyway. What I did was I used coconut oil, half cane sugar half coconut sugar, full fat canned coconuT, And i found a super high quality coconut extract I used. I beat the eggs separately, one at a time, with a stand mixer and added the coconut and vanilla extract to the beaten eggs (enhances the flavor). I made in 2 9” rounds in convection oven for 17 minutes. Frosted it with a homemade vegan buttercream frosting (it was drool-worthy) made of vegan butter, powdered sugar and more coconut extract. I also topped with toasted coconut shreds. 
It was very very sweet (the way we like it) so you could easily cut sugar in half. It was so moist it honestly didn’t even need frosting, but if you want an ultra indulgent dessert then frost it :) 
Can’t wait to make it again!

This recipe was wonderful!  I used Bob's Red Mill 1-to-1 Gluten Free baking flour and I used Coconut oil for the vegetable oil. I will definitely be making this delicious recipe again!

I replaced the xanthan with flaxseed, the white sugar with coconut sugar, added coconut extract, and instead of buttercream a coconut sugar carmel.
It is for a fellowship at my church. It will be so yummy! Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent cake. Just found out that I had to go gluten free  and was concerned about deserts which I need to make for my 96 year old mother who lives with me. This is now our favorite cake. Made the vanilla butter cream icing (as recommended). I made no changes to the recipe and highly recommend it.

Yum!  Ok, so I was craving carrot cake when I came across this recipe and realized I had all the ingredients except one..so to the store I went.  I followed the recipe as stated but sifted the dry things together and used pecans instead of walnuts.  I tasted the batter once it was mixed and was a bit worried that the GF flour (bobs red mill) may be a bit strong but I charged on...I made 18 cupcakes and a small cake. 20 minutes later all done and golden brown. I tasted one cupcake and it was FANTASTIC!!! OMG...the texture was light and airy, not overly sweet and slightly crispy on top...I had another one. Wouldn't know it was GF if I didn't make them myself.  I usually don't bake GF because the texture and aftertaste of the things I've made and tasted in the past that were GF was not good at all..somehow the goodness of baked goods turns to something resembling rubber and cardboard at the same time when made GF.  THESE WERE SUPER GOOD....planning to frost them with a cream cheese coconut frosting but they really don't need it.

This was fantastic! My first attempt at gluten free baking..... I must say I’m sold. Only thing is, it was way too sweet for me.... mostly my fault though. I cut down the sugar in the recipe to one cup but my coconut was sweetened shredded coconut. Just a personal preference as no one else complained! 
Definitely a keeper!!! Thank you!

I made this, but with brown sugar instead of sugar and lactose free milk instead of the coconut milk (I didn't have any). The cake still turned out wonderful. It still has a slight coconut flavour. I will definitely make this again! Oh, I also cooked it for about 10 min less

Made it according to recipe. By adding spices that I had used for a white cake (cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, ginger and a little black pepper) it truly was one of the best cakes ever!  First gluten-free recipe I made. Granddaughter has celiac.  She absolutely loved it!  Thanks for the the recipe!,

I made this cake and it was the best GF cake ever! I used 1-1 AP baking flour and added pecans to the batter. I also frosted it with homemade buttercream frosting and sprinkled pecans and coconut on top. Awesome!!!

I am SO HAPPY I discovered this recipe! I followed the directions, however omitted the nuts. The constancy and taste are outstanding. For frosting I made a simple powdered sugar glaze using the left over coconut milk.  Delicious!

I made this Gluten free.  I would make this again and not take the advice of other reviewers and I would leave in the amount of sugar in the directions.  I would also use just GF flour and not use a mix of GF and coconut flour.  I would also add a light vanilla frosting with coconut added in.

followed recipe and used 2 nine inch pans.  Cook notes said 20 min. cook time...NO WAY..
Recipe called for 1 tablespoon  b aking powder. I questioned this but thought perhaps the gluten free flour needed more than the usual.  Caused large rising and overflow in the oven and the cakes to fall.
That being said...the flavor is delicious and the texture was chewy after 40 min of  baking time.  Kind of a brownie or should I say blondie.
Anyway...creator, check the ingredients and maybe make an adjustment to the baking powder.

I used coconut oil, coconut sugar, and coconut extract. I cooked them in 2 8” round pans. They came out pretty brown but some of that is the coconut sugar. I cooked them for 35 minutes.

45 minutes??? I'm glad I checked it at 30, because if I had let it bake any longer it would have burned. Except for the amount of time in the oven, I made this cake exactly as directed. It's a nice tasting cake but if I hadn't made it myself, I wouldn't have guessed that it was coconut. I see some reviews mentioned using coconut oil, maybe I will try that next time to see if it enhances the flavor, but my guess is that coconut extract instead of vanilla will be key.

On one hand, I like the simplicity of this recipe, but sometimes it can taste a little too bland. The only changes I made were cutting the recipe in half, omitting the walnuts, and then only using 1/2 cup sugar instead of 3/4 cup (I then baked it in only one 9-inch round pan). Perhaps adding more vanilla extract or using more coconut flavoring would help improve it, or using some coconut cream. In any case, this is a really easy cake to make, and one that I feel is best enjoyed warm.

This is an awesome recipe. Everyone loved it. Including all my non-gluten free relatives.  I made a few changes and would add a little more sugar next time, as it wasn't sweet enough for my taste.  Next time I'll add a few fruits to it as well. I used rice flour and substituted chia for the xanathan gum.  AWESOME easy to make cake.

Great.  Didn't  have walnuts on hand but still good, like a moist sponge cake. Tasty with cooked apple & cinnamon!
