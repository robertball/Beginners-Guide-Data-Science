The recipe doesn't say when to add the potatoes! It was gross.

I made this last night I thought it was delicious! Just add the potatoes when you add the onion.

Great find! We are vegetarian and I wanted to duplicate the chicken pot pie of my youth (minus the chicken!)I added the tofu (but I browned it separately) and cooked the potatoes with the onions and garlic - I also added cauliflower and white cannelini beans - yum! When you add extra veggies just be sure to up liquid content (I used more milk and water - no broth) and salt enough. Taste "sauce" that forms to see if you like it - then adjust! I also added some paramasian cheese to the sauce - it was VERY very good! Hearty and fairly healthy!

This was absolutely amazing; it was hard to stop eating it even when we were too full! It has that quintessential pot-pie flavor that I loved as a kid. I added about 1/4 cup more potatoes reduced the broth by about 1/4 cup and there was actually a little room to spare. I did dice up the tofu and veggies fairly small which probably made a difference. Now that I know it fits I'll make the pieces a bit bigger next time. I also added more seasoning: thyme sage marjoram and a little bit of tamari. It was exquisite and I can't recommend it enough. Thanks for the recipe Jessica!

This is versatile and delicious! This is what I did... 1/4 cup butter; mushrooms instead of tofu (didn't want to open a block of tofu and not use the whole thing); frozen pie crust; not an oregano fan so I sprinkled in dried basil parsley and thyme; for the cup of frozen veggies I measured out a combined cup of frozen peas and matchstick carrots; I used two small red potatoes and would cut it down to just one next time... I had more filling than my pie crust held... It's even good after sitting overnight and being reheated!

I made this last night using canned vegetables along with 2X spices of various sorts to jazz it up. I love the creative use of tofu in this. The family loved it except for my tofu haters... but that is no reflection on the great recipe. My one issue is that when I was done the potato was still on the table... the recipe does not say when to add it so I didn't even notice the issue until after I sealed up the pie. I'd put it in with the onion to give it time to soften up.

I've never made a pot pie before and this turned out great! I used trader joes pre-made pie crusts which were totally yummy. As others have commented the potatoes need to be added with the onions. Also the recipe doesn't mention when to add the flour. This should be added with the milk and broth in order to thicken. I used a little less milk/broth/flour than the recipe called for because i was afraid it would be too milky. I like how it turned out but probably following the recipe measurements would work too. I also added 1/4 cup each of sliced mushrooms and shredded cheese. And as suggested by another reviewer i poured a dash of soy sauce in when sauteing the tofu. Yum.

Delicious! Very much like a traditional chicken pot pie. The only change I made was to omit the bottom crust - I put a top crust only.

This is very good as is I'm sure but of course I messed around with it a little. I microwaved a potato separately til it was still fairly firm then chopped it up and added it to the thickening filling. Used thyme and a pinch of sage instead of oregano. I used oil instead of butter and vegetarian chicken flavoured boullion. If you haven't got time for pie crust this recipe works well with a thinnish drop biscuit batter just dolloped on top. Leave a little space for filling to bubble (and if your vessel is particularly full I would bake it above a sheet pan for drips). Comfort!! Ease!! Love!!

I liked it, but I personally think there was too much tofu and not enough vegetables, especially since the tofu was quite mushy, even though I used extra-firm.  I would add more potatoes personally.

It was very tasty!  When you tell others of what you made they think it will be bland, but no!  I found extra soy packets in the fridge and put in two of them.

Made this pie for the first time today. I added the potatoes in step 2. Marinaded the cubed tofu in red curry paste. The only other thing I did was put an egg wash on the top crust.

Delicious and easy to make. Works well for making ahead of time.
