good tasting, pretty easy.  no peas so i used sm pkg. cut froz. green beans nuked first per pkg directions, worked fine.  agree that chicken should be cut into bite sz pieces and stirred into stew, then just garnish all with lemon slices.  would make again.

We loved this thick stew - much more to our taste than soup!  I didn't have any peas, and can't say I missed them.  Next time I might cut the chicken into pieces and stir them into the stew rather than serving on top.  Otherwise I wouldn't change a thing.  Yum!
