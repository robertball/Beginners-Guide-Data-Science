This is the ONLY Margarita I serve at our parties. The Jose Cuervo Margarita mix has a recipe on the back of the bottle that specifies mixing one part tequila to three parts mix. This is simply not enough tequila. I found my guests constantly splashing a little more tequila into their glass. This recipe of ONE part tequila to TWO parts mix is perfecto!!! I make a large pitcher (one part tequila to two parts mix) of this in advance so that my guests can help themselves by simply pouring over ice. This frees me up to enjoy my own Margarita!!

This is the base for the way we make margaritas, but I agree with an earlier review, it's best with one part Cuervo Gold to two parts mix.  We also add a splash of orange juice and that takes it up a notch.  People who say they don't like tequila love the way my husband makes them.

My husband came up with a good recipe using this mix. Equal shots of tequilla, Cuervo mix and lime flavored G2 (Gatorade).  He makes it this way and everyone loves it.  He says your rehydrating as you drink!
