I have found this type of cookie is one that folks either love or hate.  My grandmother, who was German, made these for my dad.  She lived in Michigan and would always ship them to us in Georgia every Chrismas.  When I was about 12, she taught me how to make them and gave me her recipe.  She died about ten years ago and since then, I've been the one to make these cookies.  Today, Christmas Eve, 2002, I went to bake the cookies for my Dad, and found the recipe had been torn out of my book and is gone.  It was such a relief to find this recipe here.  This is her exact recipe, except she didn't use nutmeg.  This recipe is a wonderful recipe and the moister the batter, the better the cookie.  Also, you CANNOT over-cook this cookie.  If you do, you lose the entire flavor.  So, bake for exactly the amount of time alloted, or a little less.  Thanks so much!

Merry Christmas from Jill in Atlanta, GA

For a long time I have been looking for a recipe for a soft molasses cookie that wasn't too sweet. This was perfect! They were easy to make, have a great soft texture and the flavour is even better after a day or two. Next time I might try adding 1/4 cup more molasses to make them even richer. Overall a great recipe!

These were delicious!  I made the recipe exactly as written.  They remind me of a soft gingersnap.  Per another reviewer, I made an "optional" cream cheese frosting to serve with them for added flavor, but most people said they liked them every bit as well without the frosting.  Thanks for the recipe Rini- we really enjoyed these!

The recipe was pretty bland and I really would not make them again.  Also, the cookie dough was too sticky to roll out so I dropped them by the spoonful in a bowl of sugar to coat and then baked them.

I'm sorry to say we didn't really enjoy these cookies. The flavour was pretty bland and the texture was dry, even though we only cooked them for the recommended amount of time. I think the large amount of flour in the recipe may have contributed to this. They might taste better as frosted molasses cookies. More traditional drop molasses cookies with sugar on top taste better and have more flavor.

Very good cookies! I didn't have buttermilk or shortening, so I put my own little spin on it. I used cold butter in place of the shortening and used regular whole milk in place of the buttermilk. I then chilled my cookie batter for 5 to 10 mins to make sure the butter was nice and chilled. I also didnt have ground cloves so I just used more nutmeg (I did for 36 servings so it called for 1/4 teaspoon each and I used a 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg) I also added a pinch of salt!

I am wheat intolerant, so I  substituted wheat flour for spelt.......I think I needed to reduce the splet flour a little more it was a tad dry.

Came out really nice and very well liked.  We did add about 1/4C dark brown sugar and 1/4C honey to the dough, and used half butter/half shortening.  Instead of cutting, just rolled the chilled dough into balls, coated in white sugar, then flattened with a glass to 1/8".  Took about 11 1/2min to bake up and worked better for us to cool on the cookie sheets about 10 minutes before removing to a baking rack.  Chewy, soft, lots of flavor, not 'cakey' at all.
