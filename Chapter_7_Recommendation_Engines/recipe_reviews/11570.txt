WAIT!!!!  Before you make this recipe you should know that butterscotch morsels contain barley extract, which is not gluten-free.  I would stick with semi-sweet chocolate morsels.

GLUTEN-FREE BUTTERSCOTCH CHIPS - can be found by buying either Hershey or Kroger brand butterscotch chips.  Read the package to make sure, but as of 11-23-09 both those brands are gluten-free.

This is a good recipe but we have made them with a gluten-free ginger snap crust.  Just crush gluten-free ginger snaps and combine with melted butter until the mixture holds together and press into the bottom of the pan.
 
It works great and tastes even better!

This is a great recipe and everyone loved it (even though it was made specifically for someone on a gluten free diet). After reading the other reviews, I made several changes.  Line the pan with Reynolds Release foil...they didn't stick at all.  Also, I used more of the coconut on the bottom (it was more like a crust) and easier to handle.I also baked it about 10 minutes longer than indicated and that helped the bars stick together.  I also added a handful of extra chocolate chips (or you can sprinkle them on top).

I am new to celiac and love to bake. This was a life saver! Do add more coconut- and when it says 'wait till completely cooled' that means COMPLETELY. I would cool overnight before cutting.

After reading all the reviews, I decided to add a crust, using crushed Gluten free Ginger Snap cookies(roughly a cup), finely chopped pecans(roughly a cup) and 2-4 Tbls of melted butter.  I also allowed them to cool overnight before I cut into bite size pieces, which was also recommened. These were very good. A great chewy cookie type dessert for those of us that are gluten intolerant.

this is similar to my Hello Dollies.  You can use any GF breakfast cereal (like Rice Crunch'ems), mixed with melted butter, as a crust.  BE AWARE!! that the most popular brand of butterscotch chips has gluten, so don't use them.  I haven't found a substitute.

Made these for the first time last night. They are YUMMY and turned out really well based on some of my own adjustments and reading other reviews here. 

First, and I'm surprised only one other reviewer mentioned this, I had to make these in a 8X8 pan. I can't even imagine how anyone makes it 9X13 unless she doubles everything. There simply aren't enough ingredients.

I measured one cup of crushed Trader Joe's gluten-free ginger snaps. Then I melted 5-6 T of unsalted butter and mixed it with the ginger snaps and 2/3 of the coconut. I pressed all of that onto the parchment paper in the bottom of the pan and then layered according to the recipe (using chopped peanuts). I think next time, I will take another's suggestion and use toffee chips. I don't care for the butterscotch all that much. I'd also love to try pecans in place of the peanuts.

Many reviewers mentioned the overly sticky results, so I used 1/2 of a can of the sweetened condensed milk. It was PERFECT! They were amazing right out of the oven, if you didn't mind eating them with a spoon :)  I let them sit overnight to cool completely, and this morning I was able to cut them into bars quickly and easily. They hold together and are not too sticky. I only wish the chips had melted more. The bars do crumble some when you bite into them which I think may be a direct result of the chips not really melting much and holding all of the other stuff together. May try microwaving them ever so slightly next time.

I'd give this 6 stars if the option were available.  My oldest daugher has Crohn's disease and is on a gluten-free diet.  She LOVES these!  I'm on no special diet and love them too.  In fact, everytime I make them, they disappear. I've been asked for the recipe each time I make them and when I bring them to work, they disappear within minutes!   Thanks so much!  Wonderful!

My boyfriends parents are in town and his dad cannot have gluten.  We were having a fathers day bbq with him and I wanted a dessert he could eat.  I put most of the coconut on bottom then choc chips, pecans, more coconut, chips and pecans then the condensed milk.  They all loved it.  I make these normally with the crust, but I would have never thought of it without the crust.  Wonderful!!!

I have made these many times and everyone loves them, not just those on a gluten-free diet. They are very sticky and fall apart, but they are so good we keep making them anyway. Thank you to whoever suggested a crust. I'm excited to try them again but with a crust!

Great taste result, but I would change 3 things: finely chop the peanuts; line the pan with parchment paper or its almost impossible to remove; refridgerate for 24 hours before cutting into squares or it will be too soft to make formed squares.

**FYI GLUTEN FREE BUTTERSCOTH CHIPS-In addition to Kroger and Hershey's as mentioned in a previous review, Publix brand is also gluten-free. They have a great printable list on their website of all their storebrand items  that are gluten-free.  **   These came out great.  I sorta combined this recipe with the Magic layer bar from Eagle recipe.  I made a crust from Scharr GF shortbread cookies, and reduced the coconut to 1 1/3 cups.  I kept everything else the same as this recipe.  A great gluten-free dessert everyone will enjoy.

Easy and yummy. I made these for my Dad who is visiting this weekend and has celiac disease. Instead of butterscotch chips, I used Reese's peanut butter baking chips, which are gluten free.

Used Flourless Peanut Butter Cookies for crust.  Make as directed, allow to cool, then crumble in your well greased pan. Pat down lightly then proceed with layers. We left out the butterscotch morsels (couldn't find any without gluten....but we didn't miss them). Great recipe!  My dad has a major sweet tooth but is now restricted to a gluten free diet.  I was tired of him missing out at dessert time during every holiday meal so I  went searching for gluten free recipes.  I came across this one and am thrilled!  He LOVED it!!  These little treasures really do make a difference for those that have a restriced diet. Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe! I chilled it for two hours and used a pizza cutter to cut. I also couldn't find gluten-free butterscotch chips so I used heath toffee chips instead.

Good!  I made this using rice crispy treats as a "crust" and everyone loved them!  I made the recipe as directed, except I eliminated the butterscotch chips as one reviewer suggested just to be on the safe side.  I made rice crispy treats separately.  Then, I put the layer bars on top of the treats after they cooled.  They were gone in a matter of minutes!

After reading the "Wait" review, for safety, I omitted the butterscotch chips and added more chocolate chips and coconut.  It was pretty gooey the first day, still, everyone liked it. But the next day it was firmer and cut a lot easier. Next time I will make it a day ahead and use the crushed gluten free gingersnaps for the bottom layer.

This dessert was super easy to make -- no chopping, melting, or even mixing!  I made this dessert for a party which included a friend who cannot eat wheat.  I was afraid it might be a little too sweet, but everyone loved it -- especially the men.  Some of the guys, who are not big on sweets, had three servings!  I think the coconut and peanut combination really appealed to them.  I used lightly salted (rather than unsalted) party peanuts, added a bit more coconut than is called for, and cooled it in the fridge after about 30 mins. on the counter, so it would be ready to cut sooner.  If you keep the ingredients on hand (and can find gluten-free butterscotch chips), this would be a great recipe to whip up in no time to serve to any guests, even the gluten-free ones!   I'm sure you could substitute cashews for peanuts if you have guests with peanut allergies.

I followed the recipe but took the suggestion of adding a gluten-free ginger snap crust but without the butter. These were very sweet and sticky but that didn't stop them from being devoured! I think next time I was press the ingredients into the pan before baking to make them more firm... don't know it will help but I'll give it a try!

These are very sweet!  I had a problem getting them out of the pan.  They were very gooey.  I ended up patting them in ground almonds, just so I could serve them.  They did not look very nice on a plate but if you like sweet, it tasted okay.

I accidentally bought the most popular brand of butterscotch chips and found them to contain gluten. HOWEVER, I just found a "store" brand of butterscotch chips that don't contain gluten. Just read the labels.

I have made it twice and just use what ever combination of nuts I have on hand (tonight I have a bakers dried fruit and nut mix of peanuts/pineapple/papaya/date pieces/walnuts and added raw unsalted sunflower seeds). The first time I used mini peanut butter cups in place of the butterscotch chips- or, tonight I replaced butterscotch chips with more chocolate chips. Also, to reduce the guilt factor I use fat free sweetened condensed milk and unsweetened coconut- still plenty rich and sweet! P.S. I don't usually measure, I just grease my pan with a thin coat of butter; layer an unsweetened finely grated coconut to cover well (shake pan a bit to even out); next layer of nuts or combo dried fruit and nuts- again shake; layer some chocolate chips; layer some sunflower seeds or another fine nut- shake a little; drizzle the sweetened condense milk; top with an ample layer of medium shred unsweetened coconut and bake!

Be careful with butterscotch chips not all are gluten free. Like other reviewers I made a gluten free graham cracker crust first then layered everything on top. I also added some gf toffee chips to it. Our family loved it

This is a good recipe. I gave this as a gift to someone on a gluten-free diet. It was so good that I made another batch for a small get together. So why 4 stars? Thanks for the warning on butterscotch gluten concerns from the other reviewers. Used semi-sweet chocolate chips instead. Thanks to MGK for the line-with-foil trick, and a thicker coconut bottom layer. The foil was a great help in removal and clean up--this goodie is VERY sticky.

Check your butterscotch morsel ingredients for barley protein (contains gluten and is used as a "natural flavor" in the only brand they sell at my store). Homemade butterscotch is not hard to make, especially with a bit of practice (wikihow has directions). My butterscotch is soft enough that a crust is a good idea if using it in layer bars.

I made these for a friend of mine with Celiac's and for being such a quick and easy dessert they turned out well.  I'm not used to making something so simple, lol!  Simple flavorful ingredients, good for when you don't have a lot of time (or space) to make a dessert, and even better for being gluten-free.

This is a great recipe and every suggestion is good.  I used 1/2 cup white chocolate chips sprinkled on top and less than a cup of butterscotch. Being only gluten intolerant, the butterscotch did not bother me.

These bars are absolutely amazing!! I did used peanut butter and milk chocolate morsels, instead of butterscotch, walnuts instead of peanuts, and unsweetened coconut flakes instead of sweetened. Took these to a friends house for dinner and came home with an empty container! They are seriously amazing!

I used chopped cashews for the nuts (not sure if they're considered gluten free), and all dark chocolate chips. The second baking did take about 40 minutes - I left it in the oven 'til the coconut was evenly toasted. *thanks!* for a great new keeper! ...cjb

I was pleasantly surprised when I tried the first bite. I don't like coconut that much, but in this it's amazing. I haven't had anything quite like this before. I followed a few tips on here like using nonstick foil and chocolate chips instead of butterscotch chips.

This cooked faster than I thought. The edges were starting to burn at 20m. I would check on it after 15m because it can cook faster if you spread it thinner.

Overall this is very easy to make, with lots of room for improvising, and it tastes great!

Of couse this is very tasty, but didn't hold together hardly at all. Very hard to cut too. I sprayed the pan with PAM and they stuck, so I should have used shortening. My gluten free guest only took one bite and my husband and I were left to eat the rest.

Very sweet, but good. Everyone loved them. They taste like a yummy dessert, not like a dessert substitute as other gluten-free recipes I've tried do. I think they need to cook just a few more minutes to reduce the stickiness and create a stronger crust. Overall the best gluten-free dessert I've had.

Another winner gluten-free recipe.  I did miss the notes about some butterscotch chips not being gluten free though.  We are using gluten-free as a guideline so good to know for the future.  I did leave out the peanuts as we are trying to also avoid legumes.  Still yummy without them.

These bars are amazing but not gluten free as written.  Don't use the butterscotch chips as called for in the recipe if you are making these for someone who can't have gluten.  My mom made these bars and just used chocolate chips - they were excellent, especially the next day after they had a chance to firm up.

Absolutely delicious! I used crushed gf ginger chunk cookies from Trader Joe’s, Organic unsweetened coconut flakes and melted butter as crust. I patted it down on a 9x13 glass baking dish that was sprayed generously with Pam. I used toffee bits, semisweet chocolate chips and chopped pecans. I did not use the whole can of condensed milk, maybe just 2/3. I topped everything with coconut flakes and sliced almonds. Baked it for 25 minutes and let it cool overnight. I did not have any problems cutting them at all. You can see the pictures, before and after cutting.

I followed this recipe to the tee. However, when I served the dish, it did not cut into squares. It served up in clumps. The taste was wonderful, but it was embarrassing when serving it up.

Made these for a baby shower. While the flavor was good, they did not hold up well to slice into bars, even when I added a crust as others suggested. I ended up rolling them into balls instead and no one was the wiser

My in-house taste tester (my husband) gave it 3 thumbs up! I cooled it in the refrigerator for over an hour, and it was a very gooey bar, so I'm putting it in the freezer overnight to see if it will be a little less messy to handle.

Not happy with this recipe what so ever!! Bottom stuck to the pan and top came away even after cooling sufficiently. If this is to require a base then please put this in your instructions . I like to do a recipe as shown but from now on will be reading all reviews ??

A very  good  treat! I would give 5 stars but it is little sticky . This does not  change how good it is though. I will make it again.  Thank you for sharing.

Made with GingerSnap/Coconut/Butter Crust and pecans instead of peanuts.
Several people asked for the recipe.
Used a 9x13 pan...everything fit wonderfully.
Definitely chill overnight  before cutting and keep chilled until close to ready to serve.
I tried just lining the bottom of the pan with parchment for one batch and lining the whole pan with aluminum foil (sprayed with cooking spray) for the other.  The full lining makes it a cinch to get out and to cut.

I made it with a couple of changes, I used cashews instead of peanuts and white chocolate chips instead of butterscotch. I followed the recipe and even. greased the pan as instructed - generously! Set at 350 for 20min. Delicious morsels! But what a disappointment: the stuff could not be pried from the pan in actual bars! Total mess. Some barely got out of the pan. Had to soak the rest to get them out! Seriously, how much grease do I need to put in the pan because I put a lot in the pan including the sides. This stuff was literally welded to the pan.

Very, very good but because I made the following changes: First of all, you need to use an 8x8 pan, 9x 13 is too large. Instead of just using coconut for the bottom, I ground up Cheerios and added 3T brown sugar and 1/3 cup melted butter. Like you're making a graham cracker crust. I mixed that together along with 2/3 of the coconut and pressed it into pan and baked for 5 minutes at 350 degrees. 
For the filling I used 6 oz. semi-sweet chocolate chips, 1 cup chopped walnuts and 4 or 5 chopped up Reeses peanut butter cups (instead of butterscotch chips). Used the entire can of the sweetened condensed milk on top and sprinkled with rest of coconut. Baked for 30 minutes (vs. 20) at 350 degrees. Awesome and all gluten-free!

Excellent and extremely easy.  I substituted white chocolate chips for the butterscotch, which were not available.

I made this for a picnic and everybody loved them! It came out a little too gooey once I started cutting them but I put in the freezer and they were just as delicious.

I have made these with a crust using Annie's gluten free cookies. They were rabbit shaped called chocolate and vanilla. I put them in a food processor, then combined the mixture with a stick of butter for a crust. I eliminated the butterscotch chips and used walnuts for the nut part. They were better than the gluten recipe that uses graham cracker for the crust.

Our daughter was recently diagnosed with celiac disease so gluten free cooking is very new to us. I wanted to have a GF dessert for her at a recent dinner and since 7 layer bars are a family favorite I gave these a try. I used GF ginger snap cookies as others suggested and everyone approved.  Thanks!

These bars were delicious. I baked them for closer to 28 min, and stuck them in the freezer for a few hours and fridge over night and they still were a little soft and fell apart. But everyone loved them anyway. Maybe if it was left to bake even longer it would melt together a little better? Also, Hershey's chips are all gluten-free.

AMAZING!!!  Like rich candy bars.  SUPER easy!!!  I omitted the peanuts and butterscotch and used walnuts.  This recipe is the best to curb a sugar crave.  Thank you for it!!

This was a hit at a holiday office party and two family parties.  Mix it up.  One time I only had walnuts and those were great too!
