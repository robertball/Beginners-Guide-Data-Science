I made some modification to the original which makes a 4 star to a 5 star.

Use a 20oz can of sauce.  Instead of puree use a 14.50 can of crushed tomatoes that you puree in the blender or food processor.  Use no water.  The amount of tomatoey sauce will help with the overwhelming herb taste that some people have described.  Keep all other ratios the same.

Best served with garlic bread or crostini  topped with parmesan cheese.

I finally tried all my recipes that I have been saving from allrecipes.com and this was my favorite. It is hard to find a low fat soup that has flavor. It's rich and thick and easy to modify to your taste. Try a little habanero in it for kicks.

I loved it.  But I added a little cheesey twist.  Instead of the smoke flavoring, try using smoked gouda and cut out 1/4 cup of the heavy cream.  I think it added more flavor and who doesn't like cheese!!

I used only a tablespoon of Italian seasoning in place of the seasonings listed and I chickened out on the smoke flavoring. But the soup was so good I didn't want to risk it! I used 1/2 a cup of water, and next time I might use a whole cup. It's very thick, but that's how I like it. Tasty and easy to make.

I doubled this for 9 women for book club and it made just enough.  Followed the recipe, decreased the spices in about half, but added more basil.  Such a good soup!!  Will definitely make this soup again!!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I sauted mushrooms and fresh garlic with the dry ingredients before adding the liquid ingredients.  It turned out great!

We made this as is except for the smoked flavor, no idea where to find that!  It was great!  We didn't halve the spices like planned (boyfriend started making it before I got home) and we still loved it.  Very yummy!

Without adding water, it is more like tomato paste rather than soup.

Liked the bisque, I thought it was a bit thick and a tad on the bitter side, but I can work wiht that and I'll be making this again.

I used 1/2 of the seasonings and it was still a little too strong.  I had to add a teaspoon of sugar and left out the liquid smoke.

This was excellent.  Fast, easy and does not require alot of fresh ingredients- most I had in my pantry.  I garnish with a piece of basil and shredded smoked parmesan or gouda.

Very good!  To add more flavor and thin out the soup, add 1 can of beef broth. Yummy!

The taste was too strong. Next time I'll use no liquid smoke and 1/2 tsp of the herbs each. I did like the thick texture.

Delicious soup!  I didn't have all the ingredients listed but it still turned out great!  All I used was a 10.5 oz can of tomato sauce, 1/2 cup heavy whipping cream, 1/4- 1/3 cup water.  Also, I used a bit less of the basil and 1/2 tsp or less of the rest of the dried herbs (didn't want it to too spicy) and no liquid smoke.  My husband thought it was so delicious and I can't believe how fast it was ready for lunch!  A definite keeper!

This was a wonderful, easy, yet flavorful recipe. I  added a can of crushed tomatoes to make it a bit thicker and richer in  flavor. It got rave reviews, and I definitely plan to make it again and again!

Too acidic for my tastes, looked around at how some pasta sauces are made, and toned down the acid by starting with 3/4 onion thinly sliced, and 2 shredded carrots at the bottom of the pot with some olive oil.  Cook on medium high heat, until the onions are translucent, and then follow the recipe as normal. Doing that pushes it up to 5 stars in my book.

We used CedarHouse brand liquid smoke. Flavor was amazing.  Also tried it with Wrights...CedarHouse liquid smoke was better.

Great soup. Will definitely make again. I agree, seasonings a little much. Next time will start with 1/2 on spices, then add to taste. Also added a little sugar.  I think I will let it simmer longer next time before adding the cream, 15 minutes is not long enough.

I didn't add the liquid smoke because I don't deal with hot stuff very well, but this soup was still quite good with just the regular seasonings.  Very filling too!

This was the first time I made a tomato bisque and I thought this was pretty good. I didn't have the tomato puree so I just used a medium sized tomato and diced it up.  I also used 1/2 the amount for the herbs, I think using the whole tbsp would have been WAY to over-powering for me.

Let me first say that I love tomato soup.  This recipes, however, was awful.  I didn't find it too thick, but the flavor was definitely lacking.  The herbs were overpowering and it was somehow bland at the same time.  It was extremely disappointing.  I will definitely not be making this again.
