My sister was the one who discovered this recipe on Allrecipes.com and made a few modifications which made the meatloaf even tastier. First, chop a large onion and mince (about) 3 cloves garlic.  Coarsely chop 1 pound mushrooms (any variety you prefer) and saute along with onion and garlic until soft.  Add mixture to the rest of meatloaf ingredients along with 1 teaspoon salt and freshly ground pepper to taste. Mix everything together well and set aside in the refrigerator for 2 hours for flavors to meld.  It's also better to do a free-form loaf rather than baking it in a pan as it a free-form loaf browns better and allows excess fat to drain off.  Follow the above modifications for an outstanding meatloaf.  We served the meatloaf with the Awesome and Easy Creamy Corn Casserole (also from Allrecipes.com), grilled asparagus and baked potatoes.

I'll be honest; I didn't make this per the recipe on the first try. There were so many reviews saying it was dry and/or bland ... I tweaked it right out of the gate. I'm glad I did! It was FANTASTIC. Here's what I did:

I used 20 ounces of turkey, and a 6 oz package of turkey stuffing. I mixed two cups of the stuffing (2/3 of the package) with a cup of water (about the proper amount per the package, minus a bit to allow for turkey juices), plus 1/2 tsp chicken bouillon.  To this I added the turkey, one egg, one stalk of celery chopped small, about the same amount of diced yellow onion, and the following seasonings: garlic, marjoram, thyme, rosemary, ginger, white pepper, celery salt, and sea salt. These were eyeballed. I was liberal with the salt and garlic - a few decent shakes of the rosemary, thyme, and white pepper, and small dashes of the marjoram, ginger, and celery salt. I plunked it in a loaf pan and kind of settled it down in with a spoon making ridges in the top (so it wasn't domed). The remaining cup of stuffing I mixed with 2/3 cup of water and poured over the loaf. I recommend baking to the internal temperature - mine took longer than an hour. I did make turkey gravy to pour over top, but it didn't need it! It was flavorful and moist! Hubs (picky) went back for seconds! As an added plus, it looked GORGEOUS with the baked stuffing on top. YUMMY!

(I gave it 4 stars because it wasn't the actual recipe. What I did make I would definitely give 5 stars.)

This is a great simple recipe.  My five year old, who never eats anything that I cook, loved it.  I, too, served it with a jar of turkey gravy, which I poured on top for the last 15 min of cook time.  I spooned out the run-off gravy and topped mashed potatoes with it.  With corn, it was a perfect meal, and enjoyed by all.

I only had a pound of ground turkey, and I think I didn't judge correctly how much stuffing mix to use, so it was a "tiny" bit dry - I'll work it better next time.  If I had had the gravy, it would have been just fine actually, but the hubby didn't feel like gravy that night.  Added a few sauteed onions and some grated carrots and garlic powder for our personal flavor.  The next day, meatloaf sandwhiches were sooooo good!  lol  I think I'd make this just for the sandwhich part to be honest.  Yum!

Easy, delicious, cooks well either in the oven or the crockpot.  Some other ingredients that work are: garlic, onion, poultry seasoning, chicken broth, and/or sauteed celery.  Just a very adaptable recipe!

This is really a fantastic base recipe to use, and it's very easy to experiment with. I halved the recipe (only had a little over one pound of turkey) and replaced the chicken stuffing with cornbread stuffing.  I also added one sauteed onion, a can of stewed crushed tomatoes (drained), 1/2 tsp. marjoram, and 1/2 tsp. garlic powder.  It's an eclectic assortment of stuff, but my husband and two-year old son loved it, and it was much healthier than the food my son normally loves to eat.  I covered it with foil while baking, but there were so many juices that I would recommend covering it for only about half the bake time if you're concerned about dryness.

I also used this recipe as a foundation. I chopped a whole onion, and minced 4 cloves of garlic and a medium-sized carrot - i sauteed all of these until they were fairly soft. I added this mixture to the turkey, the stuffing (i used the low sodium version), egg beaters (instead of whole eggs). I also added 2 teaspoons of mustard, as well as some freshly ground black pepper. I served the meatloaf with some prepared gravy and it was wonderful!

Everyone loved this recipe! I too added chopped onion, garlic and seasonings. For once, I didn't have any ground turkey in the house, so I had to  ground beef instead. I then made a brown gravy with the drippings and served with mashed spuds. Terrific idea Michelle!

I read the other reviews and added some onion soup mix and garlic powder.  My daughter loved it.  I, however, hated it.  I think it was the cooking time (or maybe my oven)  I think this needs to cook around 75-80 minutes so the stuffing is not so mushy.  Maybe I will try it again.

Great! I saw one review that said this was a little bland... Knowing that, I added some more spices and dried cranberries to the meat. Then topped it with a little gravy and served with a side of whole cranberry sauce. Goes great with mashed potatoes. Great recipe idea.

Very appetizing! We used 2 lbs ground turkey, 2 cups organic bread crumbs, 2 eggs, & salt/pepper. Baked in a brownie pan, for 60 minutes, thin slices were flavorsome. Cooked on Christmas Eve 2010.

I do not like ground turkey and was given some from a friend. I made this recipe and could not believe how easy it was and how great it tasted. It has all the flavor of a turkey dinner with dressing.

Excellent, easy meal.  I added dried onions, crushed garlic clove, S&P and some spices.  It was definitely a hit with the family. 4 stars b/c I altered it some.  This one is going into dinner rotation.

Ok..been thinking about this recipe (adding on to my original review) and I think if you are having it for Thanksgiving it may be fine as is.   Cranberries,potatoes,gravy etc,all the fixins' you may just want to leave it alone...may be just right.  Thinking, if you are making it for a weeknight meal, spice it up.   Really good for a base recipe.  I normally do not complain about bland,but just needs something.  I cut the recipe in half and maybe that is the problem also.  I did put sauteed onion,garlic,salt,pepper and some poultry seasoning...just not enough.   I made a turkey meatloaf years ago that had the whole cranberry sauce in it and that was excellent  (long lost)..I think that would be good in this recipe..will try again as a base recipe.  The more I think about It I am betting that when you cut the recipe in half you just don't get all the seasoning from the stuffing mix, and that could contribute to the lack of taste.

I gave this 4 stars because i changed recipe, but it was very good with changes. I followed some changes as per previous reviewers and did as follows. I used a microplane and grated up 1 carrot, 1 celery stalk and half an onion with roughly 2 tsps of minced garlic. I used 1 1/4 lbs. of ground turkey and half of 6 oz. chicken stuffing prepared. With that I added about 2-3 good shakes of thyme, rosemary, marjoram and S&P. Mixed all together along with 1 egg beaten and 2 tbsp and 2 tsp of milk. I lined a cookie sheet with foil and down the center of a cooling rack also foiled I just cut some slits down the foiled rack. I freeformed a loaf shape onto the foiled rack and i added the remaining stuffing mix to the top of loaf. I baked at 350 for about 75 minutes and served along with some roasted garlic mash and steamed string beans with an onion gravy. It was delicious!!

I thought this was very good.  I did add sautéed carrot, celery and onion but other than that I stuck to the recipe.  My family loved it!  I also served it with turkey gravy.

This turned out pretty good, better than my previous attempts at turkey meatloaf. I added a cup each of finely diced onions and celery, left out the milk and eggs, and poured a cup of hot chicken broth over the stuffing. It was very good and tasted more like a really hearty stuffing than a meatloaf. Cook temp was perfect- don't over cook! I was worried about leaving the loaf uncovered while cooking, but it didn't burn and made a nice crunchy topping. I didn't add ketchup or mustard because I wasn't trying to make MEAT loaf and it came out a good balance of juicy and crunchy.

This was a great recipe for using ground turkey! The only things I did differently was to halve the recipe,add some diced garlic ,dehydrated onion, seasoned salt and pepper. For the last 10 min. of cooking time I spooned some canned turkey gravy over the top. I also cooked the remaining stuffing mix to serve with it. My family said it was very good and I would defineately make again!

I loved this recipe, but I did add a couple things based on the previous reviews.  I halved the recipe, and added some salt, black pepper, and garlic powder for some extra flavor.  I also spooned turkey gravy over top of it for serving.  It's super easy and definitely good.

I like to follow the advice of others who have reviewed a recipe... on that note I took the advice to add more seasonings.  It was still a bit blah for my taste.  I don't think I'll use turkey for meat loaf again.

I, as the other have, tweaked the recipe. I made a small stuffing from scratch and mixed it with turkey. In my stuffing, I used .5 lb of sausage. It gave it great flavor. The meatloaf was pretty good (with gravy on it) but I think the real treat will be sandwiches with cranberry sauce tomorrow. Mmmm, the moist maker!

delicious! We had a pre-thanksgiving craving that this meatloaf satisfied! Thanks for this creative, easy and adaptable recipe! 
I followed recommendations from other reviews and added garlic and onion and celery since I had it. We served it with veggies, sweet potato fries and cranberry sauce just for the extra thanksgiving touch

Lower the fat in this tasty dish by using 3 egg whites and water. Add any extras to give more flavor, I add onions and garlic (a friend of mine adds peppers). This is a great 2 point per serving for those on Weight Watchers when prepared as mentioned above. My picky (and I do mean picky) toddler absolutly adores this! Very easy to make too! Sometimes to give the more tradional meatlaof appearence, I add tomato sauce. Not necessary, but tasty nonetheless!

This was great!  We are very health conscious and used just egg whites which tasted great!  Next time, I may add a bit of salt and pepper to the meat.

I'm so happy I found this recipe! I have not had much luck with ground turkey recipes. This is the first one that ws a hit with the family, including my super picky daughter who is HAPPILY eating leftovers for breakfast as I type. I didn't give it 5 stars only because I imagine if you followed the recipe exactly it would be bland. I sauteed garlic, onion, and celery and mixed that in with salt and poultry seasoning. It also took about 90 minutes to cook instead of 60.

Not that lucidnoodle will ever be back to read this, but this wasn't a good test of ground turkey if you've never had it -- I think you need to be used to using it to like this recipe.  That said, I'm used to ground turkey and still thought this was only OK.  I've made turkey burgers with stuffing before and those were great, so I thought this would be similar.  It was definitely easy, but also definitely needed more done to it.  (And since I rate the recipes and not my "fix" of the recipes.... after all, I could fix it up and make it like the Salsa Meatloaf on here that I made with ground turkey, but then it would be *that* recipe.) I did like someone's idea to make sandwiches of it -- that might actually be pretty good.

This was quite good.  Very moist and flavorful.  But I agree with some of the other reviewers, it needed some veggies -- I put onion in mine and it was good.  Next time I'll probably add celery and/or carrot as well.  Served with turkey gravy (and ketchup for dipping!).

I liked it, my husband didn't care for it too much. I added a pack of dry onion soup mix, and it was a little much. Next time I'll use just 1/2 a pack of the onion mix. 
It's a little dry, be sure to make lots of brown gravy!

I am not a ground turkey fan, but this was delicious!  Both my husband and I really enjoyed this, and my 18 month old son LOVED it.  I've been having a hard time getting him to eat meats, but I thought I'd try this because of the stuffing (which he loves).  He gobbled it up and wanted more!  Great, unique recipe.  I added some onions and next time I'm going to add a little carrot.

I made this recipe for some friends because it was so easy, and it was a last minute dinner.  It was great!  I did add some chopped onion, salt and pepper, Old Bay seasoning, and about a tablespoon of mustard.  I also used an egg substitute. I will definitely make this one again!

My family did not care for this at all. They thought the texture was funny. maybe because we are not used to ground turkey.

I followed Sunlee's review recommendation exactly and it made this recipe fantastic!  It really does taste like "thanksgiving" with the added onions, mushrooms and garlic.  I will definitely be making this recipe again.
