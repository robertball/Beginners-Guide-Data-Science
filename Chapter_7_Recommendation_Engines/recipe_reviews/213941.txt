Yummy!  Very creamy and smooth. I ran out of Dijon mustard so I just used yellow mustard.  It was still delicious! I served it with a pot roast.  Rave reviews from guest.

Oh My Goodness!  This is wonderful! The sauce is not too spicy, but creamy and tangy.  It went deliciously with my Prime Rib roast!  A "Must" to try, you won't be sorry.

I followed the recipe exactly and found it very quick and easy to make. Made it a couple of hours ahead to serve with beef tenderloin and it held up fine...still smooth and creamy, and my guests enjoyed it. I would have given it 5 stars, but the mustard flavor was a little strong. Next time I'll cut it down by 1/2 T.

This is excellent! Wish I would have read “20 servings” before I started though...this makes a lot! So prepare to scale if needed.

I made this and used it as a spread on steak sandwiches. Perfect!! The tiny bit of sugar really rounds off the bite of the horseradish without adding any sweetness at all.

This sauce is amazing! I didn't make any adjustments and it is perfect as is. It is now my go-to horseradish sauce. I served it with prime rib and everyone loved it! Everyone asked for the recipe. It was a huge hit! Thank you, Momof3girls, for this excellent recipe!

I made this for the beef tenderlon at our Christmas dinner.  We had the option of peppercorn gravy or horseradish sauce.  I used both, but it was delicious, creamy & smooth.  I followed the recipe exactly.  The horseradish lovers at the table loved it. I will definitely keep it in my file.

This was fantastic! Served it with Foolproof Prime Rib. Very creamy, fluffy, and delicious! I don't think I would have liked the sour cream versions. 10 stars!

I made this got our Christmas gathering to go with the eye of round roast. It got rave reviews. Some saying it's the best horseradish sauce they ever had. I didn't change anything. This does make a lot of sauce so the next time I think I will make half. This is now my go to recipe for horseradish sauce.

I liked the fact that the horseradish wasn't so strong that it made your eyes water! It was light and creamy.

I did substitute whipping cream for the heavy cream and whip it to hard peak stage. Great flavor served with my rosemary dry rub beef roast also potatoes, onions, carrots and mushrooms! Husband loved it.

I just made this at Christmas to go with the tenderloin I served.  The horseradish sauce i bought was quite hot so I simply whipped 1/4c more heavy cream and added a dash more sugar and also added some orange rind.  Delicious! Rave reviews from everyone!  
Love and blessings!

I had to do some major adjustments (extra mayo, sugar and honey mustard) to cut the bitterness so I can still serve it to dinner guests. The only thing I can think it might have been is that I used hot horseradish.
