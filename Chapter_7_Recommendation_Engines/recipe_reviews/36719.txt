Not bad -- you could probably buy other flavored sprays to try as well.  And healthier than potato chips!

This is basically exactly how I make my pita chips except I use olive oil cooking spray, and greek seasoning (mccormicks).  I always get requests to bring them to parties, and they are always the first things to go.  Even picky eaters seem to love them.  Everyone always asks me how I make them and are surprised when I tell them how easy it is!

They are very healthy and don't give you that greasy chip feeling.  They go great with almost any dip, and I have made salsa, hummus, spinach artichoke dip, dill dip, roasted red pepper dip, the list goes on and on, and I haven't found a dip that doesn't go with these chips.  

I use kitchen scissors to cut up the pitas, and find that it's the fastest and easiest method to cut them up. Cut them down the middle, split them in half, and then just cut the halves into triangles.

Ewww. All I could taste was the Pam and I wasn't heavy-handed with the spray. I may as well just sprayed it right into my mouth. Blechh! I made this for a friend who is "health conscious" and won't believe me when I tell her olive oil is actually beneficial. Steer clear of this one.

Good, except that I used evoo instead of the spray. Also added more seasonings. Went great with an eggplant spread from our site. YUM!
