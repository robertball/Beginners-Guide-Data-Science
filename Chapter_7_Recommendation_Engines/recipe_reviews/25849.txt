This eggnog was the perfect addition to the holiday party my dorm had this past winter! I cant say enough good things about it -- everyone loved it and asked me for the recipe! Considering the fact that my dorm is in Germany, and most people had never heard of eggnog (and were a little suspicious when i explained what it was!), that was the highest compliment! I used whole milk instead of half and half and Schlagsahne (german for whipping cream) for the heavy cream. I think the scotch whiskey (which isnt always added to eggnog) also gave this drink a particularly holiday-ish punch. Prost! Well done!

I tried making eggnog a few years back & it went horribly wrong but this recipe was a huge success.  Don't be tempted to speed up the cooking process at the beginning (making the custard). Keep the heat low & stir constantly until it's thickened slightly.  I didn't add the ice cream (it was sweet enough without) and used part whole milk & part single cream because we can't get half & half in the UK. I also only used rum as is the tradition back home.  It was delicious and everyone loved it - and most of my friends had never tried eggnog before - by far the best eggnog I've had.

Delicious even non eggnog drinkers loved it.  I used only spiced rum to replace the scotch and dark rum.  Also added some cinnamon.

Excellent. I never made eggnog before and never liked eggnog, but my husband loves it.  So I made this for my Christmas party and it was a hit. I even loved it!  I replaced one cup of the cream with skim milk, deleted the ice cream and Scotch.

Very good, I used all rum instead of rum and scotch, quite time consuming to make but well worth it.

This Eggnog is fantastic. We served it at our Christmas party and everyone raved about it. It was completely gone by the end of the party. We made it without alcohol and had a bottle of spiced rum next to it so people could add it if they wished. It tasted almost like a boiled custard and was wonderful with the spiced rum. I highly recommend it.

A+!  I do not like eggnog at all but my family does so I made it for them and I love it!  I do not like drinks that you can smell and taste the alcohol and so I was so happy when I tried it and I could not taste the rum or scotch.  I will be making it a lot more even when it is not the holidays.

Last Christmas I was looking for an easy eggnog recipe as it would be the first time I was attempting to make it.  You couldn't find an easier recipe than this but, more importantly, you CANNOT find a better tasting eggnog recipe than this.   I've since made it for Thanksgiving, Christmas Eve and Christmas Day this year.   I didn't change one thing about it.  I've gotten a friend hooked on it, too, and she made it for the first time this Christmas also.

ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!  I made this a couple of years ago, and will be making it again this CHristmas since I'm not pregnant this year!  A few things:  no need to add ice cream, with all that heavy cream and sugar that'd be a waste.  Also, you can use just dark rum and brandy - no scotch.  THat's what I do and it's popular at my house.  It won't last long!  Double the recipe!

First of all, I have never made Eggnog before, and was very uncertain if it I could do it. I added NO Booze and my family and friends loved it! I added some rice wine to it later and it was still great. The only negative about this recipe is the use of 11 eggs. Other than that I would highly recommmend this for anyone.

I made this last Christmas and it was requested for this year. I did make it by the recipe and it was good. The last time I made this I used Captain Morgans Spiced Rum and even the non-drinkers liked it. Already requested for the next holiday season.

I changed the serving size to 11 servings and there was only 6 of us. The entire pitcher of eggnog was gone within an hour. I didn't add the rum or scotch since there were people who didn't drink at the party and instead i sprinkled cinnamon and nutmeg on top. It was absolutely amazing.

I made this. First time I’ve ever made anything like this. I do wish the recipe mentioned to what tempera the stove top custard should reach, and time to cook. Once done, I let it chill overnight. Woke-up and light bulb in my head appeared. I poured some nog into coffee cup, heated in microwave, added nestle chocolate powder mix...results? Best Hot Chocolate ever.

I made this for a sweet potato recipe, I didn't have all the alcohol for it but I did add a touch of Kahlua to it. It was good n thick! Trouble is, no one drank  it and it is still in the back of the fridge. I think I'll add some raspberries to it and make ice cream with my food processor! Ta Da! Thank You Sal:) Merry Christmas!

Delicious and easy to interchange milk for cream, but it's not eggnog without a little nutmeg.

made this for christmas. it was ok. im not much of an eggnog fan. so i thought this would be the recipe to turn me into a "nogger". but i guess its just not for me. the custard turns out beautiful. it took about 10-15 mins of stirring for it to come together. nobody really raved about it though. maybe theyre to used to the box stuff which is really gross. this is good though if you like that sort of thing.

This eggnog was the best eggnog I've tasted.One person wrote to be patient when you are heating the cream,sugar and eggs on the stove to form like a custard,and I was (thank you for that comment). Everyone enjoyed it very much and I will make this eggnog again.

Absolutely the best eggnog recipe.  A favorite now for years.  We make it every Christmas.
