This is an excellent bread recipe.  It's easy to follow and rolls come out perfect.  The best thing is you can make them far in advance.

These potato rolls are great!!!  They are very similar to Grandy's and Logan's Roadhouse rolls.  They are yeasty, soft, light and you can't eat just eat one.  Use this recipe if you love hot soft dinner rolls.

I gave this five stars because it was very good and everyone loved them. However, I must say that I am looking for a potato roll recipe that is much lighter. I once had potato rolls that were feathery light. This recipe has great flavor and it comes out puffy but just not the cloud soft texture I once had.

Doubled recipe to 40, used bread flour as suggested.  Big hit at party and all wanted the recipe. Tender crumb and good outside finish.  Please try these.
