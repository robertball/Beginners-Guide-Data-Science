I did not care for this salad as written, but I liked the simple ingredients.  Cut the pepper WAY down
and the garlic powder WAY up.  The salt and mayo proportions seemed fine.
Everyone's taste is different, but I was even afraid to switch the pepper and garlic proportions, thinking it was mistyped.  Just make to your own taste!

Used a touch of powdered ranch dressing mix and added one small very thinly sliced red onion. Let it sit at least an hour, and make sure to peel the cukes if you want a truly creamy cucumber salad (I didn't the first time, but I will next time!). Thanks for the recipe!

I thought this was pretty good.  The mayo was a nice twist, as I would normally opt for sour cream.  I've made this twice.  The first time I followed the recipe exactly as written, the second time I used white vingear in place of the mayo, although I used only 1/4 cup.  Vinegar and cucumbers seem to compliment each other perfectly, and with the addition of the salt, pepper and garlic powder, well...it was just yum! I'll be making this recipe again...both ways.

I didn't have enough mayonaise, so I used light ranch dressing and seasoned pepper. Very good!

Much better with onions sliced thin and only adding vinegar, salt and pepper. But I bet the sugar would be a nice touch.

My husband loves this recipe and says it is even better then what his Oma made when he was growing up.  Follow the ingredients listed but alter the amounts according to your own taste buds (we prefer more garlic and less pepper).

I'm giving this a 4 based on the way I prepared it. I peel the cucumber, cut it lenghtwise, and scoop out the seeds. I then place them in a strainer with the sliced onions and sprinkle it with about a tablespoon of salt and mix it all together. Let it sit and drain for about an hour. After that, mix in the mayo and season with pepper and garlic powder. Tastes like summer in a bowl!!!!!

This salad was a great side dish for sunday night dinner. I served it with some more spicy pork and it was a great way to cool everything down. I thought the proportions for every thing except the salt were just right. I would use less salt next time and i think it would be perfect.

To sweeten this recipe up just add sugar. Start with a small amount until you reach a satisfied amount or taste.

I used all the ingredients but didn't follow the amount exactly. I also added vinegar like most others were saying, and added ranch dressing. I loved it!

I thought this recipe was ok, but lacked flavor.  I added about 1/4 cup sliced onion, 1/4 cup chopped pepper, 2 tsp. of  white vinegar, and about 1-2 tsp. of dill.  Really tasty now!

This is good!  My father makes a similar dish that uses sour cream instead of mayo, and he adds plenty of thinly-sliced onions to it as well.  For this particular dish, I really enjoy the addition of halved grape or cherry tomatoes.

This was great. I was worried that the mayonnaise was going to be overpowering, but it wasn't.

Very good, this is just the recipe I was looking for.  My husband had a similar recipe years ago and wanted me to find one like it.  He said this one was just like the one he had.  The only change I made was only adding 1 tsp of pepper, I might even reduce that amount the next time I make the dish.

I was hesitant to use mayo since we are a vinegar family but it actually pretty good!  I cut the pepper in 1/2 and it was fine for the toddlers.  Got a bit runny after awhile but still a nice change, thanks!

I had this salad growing up. I used plain greek yogurt instead of mayonnaise to make it a healthier version, and I also added about half of a chopped onion. It was pretty similar to what I remember growing up, and a whole lot healthier!
