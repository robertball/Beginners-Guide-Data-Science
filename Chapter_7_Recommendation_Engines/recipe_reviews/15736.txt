I made this recipe in a Panasonic Inverter 1000 Watt microwave oven. I checked the candy at 6,9, and 11 minutes to make sure it was not burning, then cooked one minute longer, added the butter and vanilla, and cooked 2 minutes longer, added the baking soda and poured it out to cool. It turned out perfectly! What I did differently, and I learned this last year making another microwave candy recipe, is this: I use a fairly heavy, large pottery mixing bowl to make candy in. Something like Pyrex will not work as well and often causes the candy to burn.

YES, FOR MOST HIGH POWERED MICROWAVES THE COOKING TIMES ARE FAR TOO EXTREME WHICH RESULTS IN BURNING...THE FOLLOWING IS A MORE ACCURATE ADJUSTMENT, BUT REMEMBER, ALL MICROWAVES ARE DIFFERENT AND IF YOU CHOOSE TO MAKE A SECOND BATCH IMMEDIATELY, YOU MAY HAVE TO ADJUST THE TIME AS THE MICROWAVE HAS ALREADY BEEN 'PRIMED'
 Butter a cookie sheet. Combine sugar and corn syrup in a 2 quart glass bowl and microwave on high 4 minutes. Stir in peanuts and microwave on high 3 1/2 minutes more, then stir in butter and vanilla and microwave for 1 1/2 minutes. 
Stir in baking soda until light and foamy. Pour onto cookie sheet and spread thin. Cool completely and break into pieces and serve.

We had problem with burning the peanut brittle becouse our microwave was a 1000 watts. So we cut the time down to 5 minutes instead of 12 minutes and then cooked for 1 1/2 minutes instead of 4 minutes and it didn't burn the peanut brittle.

This recipe came in a book with my microwave in 1990 and it is a must every Christmas!  So easy, inexpensive and quick!  Do make sure not to use utensils that will melt!  Also, heat the cookie sheet so it spreads thin.

This is so easy and so good! **** Note - I did reduce cooking time to 9 Min and then 3 min. I also tried it with almonds, also producing great results.  This is TOO HOT for kids to be working with.  Boy talk about making a gift in a hurry! Do try it!

This recipe is the BEST! My microwave is very old, the wattage is lower, I am sure. The time was perfect. Perhaps the burned recipes are due to the higher wattages? Don't know, but I did this and it came out perfect, every time. Made it at my sis' house, it would have burned if we hadn't been watching it. Her microwave was 1000 watts. ??????? Hope this helps.

Good recipe BUT....Nothing on this recipe indicated the wattage of the microwave.  This recipe cannot be cooked for 12 minutes on a newer high watt microwave after the total 16 minutes the mixture exploded out the bowl with the addition of the baking soda.  The peanuts were already 'burnt smelling' when it came to 6 minutes on the timer.  It tasted like marshmallows blackened over a campfire.  I threw it all in the trash, and started over.  I cooked it for only 6 min, THEN added the peanuts with the butter and vanilla.  Cooked it for another 4 minutes....tested it with the old water trick then added the baking soda...Much Better....BUT....not nearly enough peanuts.  I would put in like 2 cups for the amount of the candy mixture it makes.

This was very easy to make. A little messy for a first timer but turned out great. Used mixed nut instead.

I tried this easy recipe in a 1000 watt microwave.  I did everything "exactly" as directed.  The cooking time was too long and result was burned peanut brittle.

I did, however, follow the advice of a previous reviewer and reduced cooking times to 9 minutes and 3 minutes and it turned out beautifully.

This was good in flavor, but as it turned out, mine didn't get cooked enough! We have a 1250 watt microwave, so I decided to reduce the cooking time to 8 and 2 1\2 minutes. Well, I was wrong, it seemed cooked, but never hardened up. I gave it to my Grandmother anyway, and she said it was good, if you eat it in small pieces. I put what I had in the oven (350 degrees) to cook it a little more, and that worked fine. I may try this out again, except cook it a little more.

THIS RECEIPE IS FANTASTIC.  I ADDED 1/4 TSP OF CREAM OF TARTAR WITH THE SODA, AND CANDY IS NOT SO STICKY.  VERY EASY TO MAKE.  TASTE DIFFERENT WHEN YOU USE PECANS INSTEAD OF THE PEANUTS.  THANKS SO VERY MUCH.  REMEMBER TO LET YOU MICROWAVE COOL BEFORE YOU MAKE ANOTHER BATCH.

I was sorry I didn't read the reviews before I tried this recipe. I have made peanut brittle before many times but had lost my recipe for it so I tried this particular site. The microwave time is too long & 2/3 cup peanuts is way too small amount of nuts for this recipe. Looking at the 12 min. time I automaticallly adjusted as I thought it sounded too long but even at 9 min. it burned badly. I won't be trying this recipe again there are too many good ones out there that you don't need to adjust to make it right!! This one is a real loser!!!!

I was shocked and pleased. I know this can be hard to make for the first time, but I tried just a half batch and guessed with my microwave. I had no idea when it was done and not too done, but I cooked it first for about 7 minutes, then added butter and vanilla and then cooked another 3 minutes. It seems to taste good and be the right consistency. : )

I was torn on what rating to give this. My end result was a gooey mess, it tasted good but not brittle. I don't know if it was my microwave or what. After reading other reviews of microwaves burning the mixture I reduced the cooking time to 9 minutes  and 3 minutes since my microwave is high wattage. I will not try this again.

Wish I had read the hints before making this. All was well up to about minute 10. Things were boiling away nicely. I was getting nervous because the bubbling seemed be slowing down.....a sure sign it had reached critical mass. I should have gone with my gut feeling at this point.
I added the butter and vanilla. It hissed a bit as it seemed to have taken on a life of its' own. The heat emminating from it was akin to being on the edge of a lava field. I swear I had opened the gates of hell.
Reluctantly, I put the pot 'o magma back in the microwave for the remaining 4 minutes. It rose perilously close to the edge of the caldron....I mean, pot.
It was time to add the baking soda. That's when the true science experiment began. It expanded.....and expanded.....and expanded. It was like the story of Tina and the magic pot. As it roared upwards over the edge of the container and began advancing towards me I grabbed my oven mitts and dumped it in the cooling pan. The mitts stuck to the container. A dishcloth stuck to the mitts.The bubbling mass continued to grow. There was a sharp pain on my forearm where it had tried to assimilate with my body. I smelled fire and brimstone. My life flashed before my eyes. A muffled scream was heard.
Do yourself a favor. 
Buy peanut brittle.

I made this over the weekend. I was going to use it in gift baskets I'm making. I took the advice of other reviewers and broke up the cooking time to 4 minute intervals. Mine turned out really gooey. I even put it in the freezer! I never set up and got hard like a brittle should be. I had to call someone and get another recipe. Sorry. The taste was fine, but I won't be using this one again. Thanks anyway.

This is the best peanut brittle. I love the way it has a very light airy texture. This will be on my Christmas goodie trays for the neighbors. I used a 1000 watt microwave and put it in for 9 min then 2min 45 seconds and it was perfect. I do recommend stirring the corn syrup and sugar before microwaving.

I tried this without reading reviews first and it burnt so bad.  My husband and I was having a peanut brittle cook off and needless to say I lost big time.  The time is way to long for my microwave.  There is not enough peanuts in the recipe, you should add more.  I will try it again and see about using as some have suggested 9 min then 3 min.  I would check it often and see what your microwave is doing and adjust the time of cooking accordingly.  Sounds like a real good recipe if done right!

I wish I had read the reviews first. 12 minutes was far too long in my microwave.
