This is a great chile rellenos recipe.  My husband lived a lot of years in New Mexico where there is an abundance of really good Mexican food.  He said that he never had the chiles stuffed with meat (usually just cheese)--but he really liked the flavor.  He said that these were as good as what he had in New Mexico.  I used my own homemade salsa instead of the chopped tomatoes, (which has skinned roma tomatoes, onion, green chiles, cilantro and brown sugar,garlic, salt and pepper) I cooked 1 lb. of hamburger, so I had enough meat left over to use to make tacos another night.  Thanks for a great recipe and for helping me to prepare something my husband really enjoyed.

muy tasty recipe. I omitted the beef, since I hate it, just stuffed them with cheese. I also used big fat jalapenos instead of poblanos, which are smaller but look a lot nicer and taste better when roasted. I am subtracting a star for the choice of cheese--mozzarella is a bit too bland. something stronger like sharp cheddar would hold up well.

I have made these before and they are absolutely wonderful......if you can't take the heat, you can use anaheim peppers instead.  Because I haven't found a good recipe for ranchero sauce, we purchase it from our favorite Mexican restaurant and spoon over the top of the peppers.  These freeze well also, so if you are taking the time to prepare them already, take a little extra time to prepare some for freezing.

This is a somewhat labor-intensive recipe, but well worth making. I substituted 1/2 cup tomato/chipotle salsa for one of the tomatoes. My husband's comments: "You can make this one again. The poblano peppers are just spicy enough, but not over powering...you can make this again." He usually doesn't repeat himself like that. These were very tasty!

Reminded me of summers at my abuelitas house.  I used mexican queso fresco (Cacique Brand) because that's what I remember my granma using.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  Finally, a trully authentic Mexican recipe just like my granmas!!!!

These are so good and just like you would get at a restaurant. I've always wanted to make these so that I didn't have to go out to eat to have them. I did only use monterey jack cheese for the stuffing of the pepper and that was so easy.

Baked instead of fried, and still good!  Used grilled chicken instead of beef.  Added some chili powder, cumin and crushed red pepper to onions.  (We like it hot!)  Then rolled in eggs and breadcrumbs, and baked at 400 for 12 minutes.  Took out, poured red enchilada sauce and added some cheese to the top, baked for a few more minutes just to melt the cheese!!!    My husband and I LOVED this recipe!  Will make again when we harvest these poblanos again!

This is an authentic recipe, something that would really top it off is a nice tomato sauce over the top.  I use about 4 roma tomatoes, 1/2 white onion diced, 2 garlic cloves chopped finely, 1-1/2 chicken bouillon cube, and about 2 cups of water.  Put everything in pan and bring to boil, then once tomatoes are tender, put it in the blender and blend until smooth.  Pour over the chile rellenos, and enjoy!

This is fantastic! Will definitely make again! 

The only thing I did differently is I added 4 cheese mex blend you buy in the bag instead of mozzarella.  Also after I fried them, i poured about 1/2 cup of enchiladas sauce, sprinkled a little cheese on top, covered, and baked about 10 min at 275.

I followed this recipe mostly but didn't want beef in it, just cheese.  We used a Mexican cheese blend.  Followed the directions the rest of the way and then made a sauce of 1 - 15 oz. can of tomato sauce with 1 can of Original Rotel tomatoes.  Very spicy and tasted really good.

I made this recipe but instead of frying I layered the ingredients in a rectangular pyrex peppers, cheese, meat and tomato  sauce , black beans and corn onions and cilantro,  more cheese and then the egg mixture on top and baked in oven at 350 for 25 minuted instead. Came out great and less greasy than original fried recipe. served with rice.

I ended up roasting 3 peppers and not roasting 3 other peppers and put them to the taste test.  My family agreed we liked the taste and texture of the peppers that were Not roasted.  I like my chile rellenos with cheese only and I knew I wouldn't like mozzarella, so I used montery jack.  Good, but I'll continue to search for a better mexican cheese.  (but maybe with the meat mixture it works better)  I loved the coating - make sure you whip the whites almost stiff.  The first few with the stiff egg whites came out much better than the peppers coated with only the frothy egg in the bottom of the bowl.  UPDATE:  At a restaurant I prefer cheese only, but for this recipe I prefer the ground beef and cheese.

When making 4 chiles ,use at least 6 eggs for the batter and add like a 1TBLS. Of flour to the batter.I dip the chile into the batter with both hands into the hot oil,just be careful not to burn your fingers,and if some areas need covering with the batter just spoon over the areas that need it.

Very delicious with a few adjustments to personal taste. I did have a difficult time keeping the peppers together - they kept ripping further as they were stuffed and dipped. I may have over-steamed them. I added Garden Fresh Jack's Special Medium salsa in place of the tomatoes and some cumin as well as hot red pepper to the beef for more spice.

Very tasty!  I used blue cornmeal instead of flour for rolling the stuffed peppers in.  Beating the egg whites really does make a huge difference in the texture of the batter- it sticks easily onto the peppers, and fries up very crispy.  I will definitely make these again!

i was suprised these turned out good! i was apprehensive about them falling apart in the pan since the peeling was messy, but they actually held up well. next time i will probably use a sauce to pour over like some people suggested, and perhaps try mixing cheeses.

This recipe was ok.   when you roast the peppers, make sure you roast every inch, and expect it to take a long time.  (I learned that the hard way.)  Also, you definitely need some type of sauce to go with it, or else it is  way too dry.   the meat mixure is good, but a little heavy.  Next time, I would definitely half the meat mixture and add more cheese. Overall it is a good recipe.

I made these 2 days ago without the meat & they came out great! They taste just like my aunt makes them. Im Mexican & ive tried chiles rellenos before & to be able to make them is just a great feeling! I didnt put the chiles in a plastic bag, i just peel them like that (thats how my mom makes them), and i made some refried beans 2 go along with it. Im glad i found this recipe! Thanks a lot =)

I'm from Tx, and recently moved to Minnesota where good Mexican food is extremely hard to come by, much less good chiles rellenos. This recipe is fantastic. The only thing I do differently is that I use ground pork rather than beef 'cause I'm saucy like that. Additionally, try adding raisins and/or almonds to the meat as well.

No one in my family really liked this. To be fair, I believe I really didn't roast the peppers long enough and that may be the only reason none of us liked them. The filling was fine.

Made Chile Rellenos for the first time last night.  DELICIOUS!  Family loved it.  Will do more often now.  Used ground turkey meat instead of beef to cut down on fat.  Used 75% monteray jack cheese and 25% colby cheese in place of mozerrella.  Also used Canola oil - better heart healthy oil.  :-)

Good but NEVER EVER rinse the peppers after roasting. A big no-no. It washes away the smokey-char of the skin that adds depth to the roasted pepper. Just remove what you can and the rest of the small burned bits remaining add to the dish's authenticity. I also am a purist and omit the meat.

Made these for dinner and they turned out great. They are more filling then regular cheese filled chiles. We don't eat our chile rellanos with rice as a side we usually have them with corn tortillas as I serve them with a broth of sauted onion, garlic, tomato and cilantro with chicken broth. However, I did add potato and carrots with the meat mixture making it a picadillo. Yummy!

I saw this recipe being made by mexican chefs in mexico on PBS. What I saw them do differently is they dipped chille in egg white fluff...no yolk, then lightly dusted with flour and deep fryed the chille. If you have a deep fryer...that's the way to go. My chille's were a disaster b/cos I had to flip them over in the fryer and I lost alot of the crust. Other than that a fantastic recipe!!

Very, very good......was quite a bit of preparation, but worth every minute.  Will definitely try it again and again.  Hopefully it will freeze well and I will make a bigger batch next time.  I went to our local Mexican Restaurant and bought their Ranchero Sauce to put over the top of peppers........great!! Would recommend this recipe to anyone.

These do take some time to make, but are totally worth it.  Mine took a little under 2 hours.  (I wasn't rushing, but wasn't totally taking my time either).  I used a cheddar and jack cheese blend instead of mozzarella because that is what I had on hand.  I will definitely make these again.  My husband and father were very impressed and gobbled them up.

I wanted to make that dish because we had it in Mexico and we liked it.  It took only 45 minutes to make 5 peppers.  Authentic version we tried had a thicker coating, I assume you can increase coating thickness by alternating flour and egg several times.

I chose this recipe because it was the only recipe on this site that offered a 4 1/2 star rating but the payoff was not worth all the work that went into the recipe. I made it with a bed of ranchero sauce as well. This was just too much work for not so much flavor.

Very yummy. I used canned tomatoes with chili peppers added to make less work. It added some heat also. I struggled getting the outside crust to stay on though. Not sure what the trick is? Next time I won't let the peppers get so overdone under the broiler.

LOVED this recipe, and so did my sisters and they're very picky eaters!! I learned not to let the egg mixture sit for too long becauuse it will go flat, and also cut the chiles carefully because it will get messy with all the toothpicks!

I've been wanting to try cooking my own!!  I prefer  only cheese in my Rellenos.  Using a restaurant sauce over the home made Chiles Rellenos sounds like a good idea.  I'd really like to learn  to make that, also.

this was so bland it was barely edible. DO NOT use mozzarella for this! and find a good red sauce for the topping. if you follow this recipe exactly as i did you will be disappointed.

These were fabulous.  I didn't blacken the skins, just got them to where they had separated from the pepper and then gently rubbed them off.  I sliced them open only about half way, that way I wouldn't have as much pepper to suture up later with toothpicks and gently crammed the cheese mixture into the cavity of the pepper.  Everyone gobbled them up and I was only able to salvage 2 for myself.  I will definitely be making these again!

To speed up the process you could also use the chiles that come already prepared in the can. They won't taste as fresh but you still get the same result.

Peppers were so hot I was choking preparing them!  You must love hot stuff to like this.  We thought it was great and our bellys were on fire afterwards.  Probably won't make again, it was torture to prepare peppers for me.

I'm not a fan of fried food, so I think this is a good alternative.  Roast peppers and make mix as described.  If you like spicy like me?  Add a chopped jalepeno and 1/4 cup pine nuts.  Stuff peppers, and add 2 tablespoons of your face tomato sauce.  Top with the Mozz cheese.  Bake for 1/2 hour.  I believe this is a good healthy way to go, and tastes better.

My husband LOVES chile rellenos so I was excited to find this recipe!  The restuarants around here do NOT batter and fry them so I didn't do that either.  YUMMY!  He was so excited and told me I had to make them at least once a month. :)  One other change I made is that I used Land O'Lakes white american cheese instead of mozzerella...I've been told that's what our favorite Mexican restuarants use, and from the taste, I think they're right!!!

I used Queso Blanco instead of mozzarella, as recommended by another reviewer, these were absolutely FABULOUS!!! The MAN friend had 2, and normally I can't get him to hardly finish his plate for ANYTHING! I had some left over taco meat so I got to skip a step, and one egg was plenty for 3 Poblano peppers, had some bacon drippings, so I skipped the more heavy and excessive corn oil. Topped with heated picante sauce and served with home made spanish brown rice! We WILL be having again!!

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!  Must try but be warned that they are messy and time consuming. Read the directions and make a mental note of how you will prep all of the other sides you will be making with this main dish.  The chilies alone take a lot of time. Aside from how disgusting mine looked because I over grilled the chiles and over stuffed them... they were like a little bit of heaven.  Even after all of them mess and time it was totally worth it!!!

I really liked using the flour instead of a batter.  Combining the filling of half meat and half cheese worked perfectly for my version using chorizo sausage.

This was the first time I made chiles rellenos, and they came out pretty good. I gave some to my parents and my aunt, since my husband and kids don't like them. They said it came out really good. I did have trouble with the batter sticking to the chiles, but it still came out good either way. I love them with cheese and ground beef, so I stuffed them with both. It was a lot of work, but they tasted real good!

Much spicier than you'd think. I am married to a chef, and he said bell peppers would have taken it down to less spicy if you prefer. But pretty simple and very good.

My husband fixed these and they were delicious but he said they were such a pain to make that he will never make them again!  We liked them stuffed with the ground beef and he used monterey jack cheese instead of the mozzarella.

I liked these and my daughter loved them but I don't think I'm very good at making them.  They were too greasy for me, probably didn't heat the oil hot enough, which made them difficult enjoy.  I think next time I'll make them in a casserole so not only will they be easier for me to make but also not so greasy.

This was really good! I followed the recipe exactly but only for one pepper.  I hadn't had this before but I thought they looked really good at the restaurant so I decided to try it at home! I really like regular stuffed peppers anyways.  It didn't take me as long as the recipe says but probably because I made only one.  I will definitely make this again!  If anyone knows, are they typically fried? Because the ones I've seen weren't...? Thanks :)

This a lot of preparation, but it is worth it, what I like to do is prepare the picadillo one day ahead if I can, to the picadillo I like to add carrots thinly choped and bell pepper as well. Some chiles come out hot, since my husband does not eat too hot, I prepare some water and salt (about 1 1/2 cup of water and 1tbsp of salt)and dip the clean chiles for at least 15 minutes, you can rinse them and dry them after that.

Delicious! Husband loved it too (and he can be picky)...he likes spicy so I substituted pepper jack cheese for the mozerrella and I like mild so I used cheddar in mine (thought mozzerella might be too bland)...I also substituted jarred salsa for the garlic, onion and tomatoes per another reviewer's suggestion...turned out great. Was thinking that to make this dish less time consuming, you could prep the the meat mixture ahead of time.  And be careful not to over cook the peppers...I grilled mine too long and when trying to skin them they split in several places making it hard to stuff.

I liked the simpleness of this recipe.  I thought it could have used a little more flavor in the meat mixture.  Perhaps some cilantro or using chorizo instead of ground beef.   This was the first time I fried my poblanos and the flour and egg batter worked very nicely.

Came out great! My husband and I didn't put any meat in it just cheese, since this is what we're used to. Next time we will definitely try w/meat. Also, instead of mozzarella, try cotija cheese.. it works very well.

The peppers fell apart and the toothpicks weren't saving them.  Not sure how long they were supposed to be broiled but I guess they were overdone.  Also the fried part was too oily to eat.

very labor intensive with having to blacken and peel the peppers. While I was peeling the peppers they fell apart so I could not seal them back up, and therefor could not finish the recipe as directed. (I would have had tooth picks all over to hold them together). So I stuffed them as directed with the meat mixture and cheese on top and baked them. I used the cheese the recipe called for on two of them and used goat cheese on the other two. Flavor was good but too much work for the return.

I opted for a healthier version and skipped the batter & frying, and used the cheese only as a light topping.  I baked at 350F for 35 minutes.  

It was flavorful and mildly spicy, good portion size, great addition for a balanced meal.

I don't know if it is fair for me to review this, but these were VERY difficult to make! I did the egg mixture and surprised that it stuck to the pepper well  but it did not taste the same. I had trouble peeling the peppers' skin and making the right thickness of batter. I melted a spatula in the oil and the second one turned out okay but would definitely not attempt this again. I very much respect the mexican restaurants now and will enjoy them even more now when I order them.

Absolutely Yumalicious! Worth the time and the mess. I substituted the cheese with some colby after reading a few reviews. I also replaced the tomatoes with some Herdez hot salsa to give it extra zing.

I made this recipe for dinner last night. It wasn't bad, but there are a few things I changed/would change. First, I mixed the ground beef with a store bought soffrito sauce which gave it a good flavor. I also used a monterey jack and cheddar cheese mix. I followed the recipe for the batter, but I did not like the way it came out. I think the next time I make this I will use a cornbread batter (like the kind corn dogs are made with).

This pic does not do these peppers justice.  I used 4 poblano peppers and 4 green chiles, (chiles were a little small to stuff very well).  Didn't change anything for the batter recipe and my friends and family raved about them.  I was lazy, did not wash my peppers after I cut out the seeds, but they were still wonderful.  Last time I made them, I placed the leftovers in the freezer, froze them individually, and my husband and I had them one night for supper.  Just threw each of them in a  tortilla, added pico and cheese, mmmmmmmm.  Thanks for the recipe!

We made this last night.  We used Provel rope cheese and some Habanero cheese melted on top.  Getting the chile to stay closed when frying was tricky.  We added sour cream on top at the end and lots of hot sauce.  THIS DISH WAS AMAZING!!

Great dish!  The only alteration we made was to spoon (tomatillo) salsa verde on top before serving.  This is how it is served at our favorite Mexican restaurant and it tastes delicious!  We will make this again and again!

This recipe is a keeper!! I always order these when I go to a Mexican restaurant because it is rather labor-intensive to make them, but I decided to give it a try when my son wanted them enough to help. Rather than beef, we used canned chicken and Sharp Cheddar cheese rather than mozzarella. They turned out terrific! I'll definitely be making them again!

These peppers were tasty, but they tasted like regular stuffed peppers.  They weren't really my idea of chiles rellenos, which is why I only gave it 3 stars.

Nice flavor, but very labor intensive, and they tended to fall apart.  I saved most, and they were pretty good.
Also used veggie crumbles instead of meat.

We messed up when blistering/roasting peppers so they got mushy and the final product didn't look too pretty.  We also used hot italian sausage instead of hamburger which was really good.  Will make it again!

They are very good, just wish the chilies were easier to prepare.   I did get a tip to shock them is cold water after  roasting them.   It makes the skin peel easier.

Delicious, my first time making Chiles Rellenos. We loved it. I followed the recipe for the most part, but knowing my family's love of spices and stronger seasoning, I substituted a can of Rotel original in place of the Roma tomatoes and I added about a teaspoon of cumin. I'm sure its delicious as written, just wanted to kick it up a notch. This goes in my 'keeper' file.

Flavor was good. Not spicy (poblano peppers). I only gave a 4 star rating as the instructions on how long to sweat your peppers was missing. So, I over sweated my peppers and and they became hard to handle, fill and close.

One change really, I baked the meat mixture with cheese sprinkled on till melted.  Served the fried peppers with meat & cheese on top. The peppers kept tearing as I was removing skin.  My SO loved it, (he is of hispanic descent). Named them "Open Face Chiles Rellenos".

Very authentic! My Mexican friend, who grew up in Mexico, taught me years ago how to make these. This is her recipe all the way. We only did cheese stuffed, but there are many variations on this. Also, you can substitute whatever kind of cheese you like, per taste.

Good dish...nice flavor combo. I didn't fry, just cuz I need to keep calories down. (Note that the recipe calls for a full cup of oil...most of which is prolly not used, based on the frying instructions in the recipe...but I think the nutrition counts do include the full cup.) Used mild Rotel with the ground beef and pepper jack cheese. Spread a thin layer of enchilada sauce over the bottom of a 7" X 11" baking dish, added the stuffed peppers,  and then spread  about a tablespoon of sauce on each pepper.  Baked at 375* until bubbly, added more sauce and a layer of cheese, and then baked until the cheese was melted and bubbly. My peppers fell apart when I peeled them, so I kinda had to half stuff/half roll...and use a few toothpicks = ) ...!!

I added some spices into my meat like oregano, parsley, cumin, and tumeric. I also added my own tomatoes red salsa. Had a little trouble keeping the peppers from breaking but it didnt matter once they were done because they tasted great. Definitely was a lot of work and creates the garnacha smell in your house.

These are delicious!! The recipe is so easy to follow and they are very true to the authentic flavors. I added a dash of cumin when cooking the meat (I also used ground turkey). This has always been a favorite dish to order when eating authentic Mexican food, and on this first attempt of mine, I am one happy pregnant lady!!!

Since this was the first time for making this for me, I made a few mistakes.  I roasted the peppers too long so they didn't maintain their firmness and I had trouble getting the seeds out through a small slit. Because I cooked them too long, the toothpick trick didn't work.  I didn't use a large enough bowl to coat the rellenos in the egg mixture so the coating wasn't even. Since these were issues for me, I thought I would pass it on.  I looked specifically for a recipe that had beef in it. I also substituted tomatillos for the tomatoes. These tasted great.

I was really hesitant about coating with the egg white but it came out perfectly!  I added a little enchilada sauce to the meat mixture before stuffing and used a Mexican blend of cheese in place of the mozzarella.  Served with more enchilada sauce and grated cheese on top.

3 stars because this was not easy for me...being my first time to work with peppers this way.  THIS DOES NOT REFLECT THE RECIPE...as I'm sure better cooks did a better job.  I just want anyone out there that is not real experienced to know ahead of time...it's not easy.  I wish someone could message me on what I did wrong.  :(  I plan on making them again, but my peppers all fell apart.  They were ripping here and there...stuff falling out...barely got them fried up.  My husband wasn't impressed...with MY cooking...not the recipe.  I love stuffed peppers and really want to make this wonderful recipe work!  HELP!!!!  :)

I'm not the fan of Chile Rellenos to begin with, so I'll go off my husband's opinion as it's his favorite dish. He thinks something is missing... but besides that this is one of the best versions we've found on this site. We used some Mexican queso instead of mozzarella for fear it would be too bland. Will keep searching for that missing piece....
