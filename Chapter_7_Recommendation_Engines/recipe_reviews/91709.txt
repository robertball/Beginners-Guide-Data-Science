Very good, quick and easy too.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 since the texture is exactly like a brownie/cake-like instead of a traditional cookie.  But it's very moist and chewy. This could easily be used as brownie batter and baked in a brownie pan. The sweetness is perfect, not too sweet as I expected.  I used walnut sized dough balls and baked for 9-10 min. I chilled the dough first or else the batter would have been too soft. I melted the chocolate squares in the microwave and then threw the butter right into the hot chocolate and it melted right up. Quick cookie to make if you're in a pinch and very tasty.  But tastes very similar to the Cake Mix cookie recipes on this site.

Excellent cookies. I have a tip! The mix is very thick. Heat a cup of water and dip a metal spoon in to the water. Then use the spoon to place the mix on the cookie sheet. Big Help!

Great simple to make cookies.  Tasty!!  Q quick hint--After adding the melted chocolate chips let it sit for about 1/2 hour and allow the mixture to cool.  Makes it a lot easier to handle.  You can roll into balls and it won't stick to your hands or spoons.

Very good- more like a cake like cookie but perfect for a chocolate lover. I did not have enough white chocolate so I added chocolate chips to make a full cup. I think next time I will grease the pan- it called for ungreased but was a little hard to remove from the pan and I have new non stick pans.

Fantastic!!  These cookies are super easy to make and come out perfect every time!!  They come out soft, gooey and delicious.  I don't melt the semi-sweet chocolate, I just pour the melted butter over them.

I never write reviews and this has just become my favorite cookie.  I made them last night and it was super easy.  Yes, it's gooey, but not a problem at all.  I didn't have any nuts so instead I added 1 cup of semi sweet chocolate chips.  I'm sure that made it sweeter, but what's wrong with that!

Not sure what happened, but these did not turn out for me.  I had a big goopy mess even after extra time in the oven.  Had to add probably 1/3 cup flour to salvage the batter.  Will try again, just in case.  They are easy and very rich.

These are so good!  Rich and chocolatey and very moist.  I used peanut butter chips because that's all I had.  I took mine out at 8 min and let them finish baking on the pan, they came out a lot like a gooey butter cookie.

Excellent cookie and so easy to make.  The only thing I did different was to use a cookie scoop so I had to increase the baking time and only came out with 36 cookies.

Something's missing. Good flavor, but textures okay. I didn't use nuts, but am allergic to them. Perhaps that's the needed piece.

I followed the recipe exactly as stated, and the batter was too thin.  I placed the batter in the fridge for 10 mins. +/- and it was a lot better.  The cookies bake kind of like a cake; the dough drops become more round and rise like a cake.  Airy texture, and definitely taste better warm.  I used margarine, and next time I will for sure use butter to find out if the taste is any better.    While writing this review I noticed the first ingredient is biscuit baking mix.  I read it as Bisquick.  I wonder if this has anything to do with the taste.  Next time I will have to use the CORRECT mix and hopefully have better luck with consistency and taste.  I'll let you know how they turn out next time.
