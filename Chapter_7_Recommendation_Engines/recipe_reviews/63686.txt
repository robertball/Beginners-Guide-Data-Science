Well, I give the MARINADE four stars.  The flank steak was too tough, so next time I would use a more tender cut.  I even marinaded the steak for more than 24 hours in hopes of making it more tender and I made sure I poked it really well with the fork.  The marinade made a nice colorful presentation though, so I think it would do well for guests if you had a nice cut of meat.  I did add a little extra basalmic vinegar since my onion was big and I needed a little more juice.  I also was a little heavy handed on the garlic and capers, but I think all in all I kept the basic proportions of the marinade the same.  I just did a little more than the stated amounts.  I will make this again, but I will find another cut of meat.

I liked the lightness of the flavour in this recipe.  My boyfriend didn't like the combination of the red onion and the capers but I love capers and thought the taste was fine.  The timing was perfect even under the broiler.

This was simple and delicious.  I used a fork to poke some holes in the steak (I actually used london broil) and then poured the marinade over, making sure it was thoroughly coated, then marinated overnight and grilled it on our Foreman grill.  Terrific!

This recipe was easy and delicious. I left out the capers, marinated about 7 hours and cooked it on my Forman for 5 minutes(med-rare to med). The flank steak melted in my mouth.

This was very simple to prepare, i just so happened to have capers in the house.  I did add olive oil, for no other reason than i felt like it.  I marinated over night but i didn't find the marinate added to much flavor to the steak, however, when you add the reserved marinate with the onions it was FANTASTIC.  

I cooked the the reserved marinate with the onions in it.  I could have sat and eaten all the onions out of it, it was excellent.... i wrapped it all up in foil and threw it on the grill with the steaks.

I will make this again, although if I'm out of capers i will not feel so bad, i don't think it added much.

I thought this was alright. Instead of using flank steak, I made the mistake of using a good cut of Beef Top Sirlon. The marinade did not make enough to endulged the entire steaks. I also did not add capers b/c I am not a fan. The balasmic tasted great after the grill. I probably wouldn't make it again.

The marinade was awesome.  We did not think the meat was tough (per some of the other reviews)... but then my hubbie grilled it perfectly!  Definitely marinate it overnight.

Very good marinade.  Did a great job of tenderizing a steak that is inherently tough.

This was EXCELLENT (although I did not use Flank Steak, but opted for a different cut). It was VERY easy to make; the marinade took quickly to the meat. I grilled this at night for lunch the next day. Then, warmed it up in the micro, along with some chopped tomatoes.

great taste, but not a good option for those who do not like their steaks 'pink'. I didn't realize that until halfway through cooking it, but it was still very good.

AWESOME!!! I loved this recipe! I did leave out the capers, only because I didn't have any and upgraded the cut of meat after I read some of the reviews. I will make this a regular for sure! LOVE IT!!!

The original recipe was very good.  But to add a little variety to our diet, I used pork loins the second time around, took out the capers and added a tablespoon of olive oil to the marinade.  Instead of red onions, I used yellow onions and also added sliced mushrooms to the recipe.

The marinade was really good, I used lime instead of lemon. I'm new at grilling so the toughness was probally my fault sice I left it on too long. I was also too cheep to buy flank. I got a top round cut. Still, the taste was wonderful!

This was really good. My whole family loved it. And I had enough for a topper for my salad the next day. I'm doing the South Beach Diet and this was perfect, the family didn't even know it was healthy.

Not one of my top favorites, but it was good. Slicing thin & diagonal to the grain helps the toughness of the steak. The reserved onion mixture added flavor after cooking.

This was really good. I made one change, I minced the capers only so my kids would eat. Made the flank very tender.

Loved the marinade. I took some of the suggestions and used filet instead of flank steak. I also sauteed the reserve marinade on the stove for a few minutes before serving. Delicious! The south beach mashed "potatoes" recipe on this site paired great with this steak!

Marinade was really good.  We broiled it with the onions on top from the marinade.  Flank steak was a little tough.

I would have given this a 5. But the steak was way to chewy. My boyfriend complained ALOT.

This was a little too sweet for both my husband and me.  I recommend making the Tuscan Steak instead of this one.

this recipe was pretty good! who knew being on a diet could taste so good. the flank IS quite yough however...anyone have any suggestion for a more tender cut? as an alternative, i sauteed the onion/caper/etc mixture with sliced mushrooms and topped the steak with it after i t came out of the broiler. delicious and very filling!

Very tasty and extremely easy!  The suggested times are perfect for a tender steak.
