LOVE these!  I make a really similar dish, I make the sauce with butter, brown sugar & honey until its all bubbly and brown and yum, then add the carrots to that.  Totally unbelieveable.  Simple, cheap, fast, good with sweet or savory.  I'm thinking since someone was saying it was too sweet for them, about maybe using roasted garlic.... not sure how I'd blend that in but it seems like it may work out.

I made these for Christmas dinner and my family just ate them up!  Due to the fact that I was cooking for a lot of people, I had to make them ahead of time and keep them warm in a crock pot.  I didn't change anything to the recipe, and in fact, I was asked for the recipe by 4 people.  I will be making them the same way for Easter.

Super easy! Based on other reviews I used half the sugar and these were perfect.

My husband loves glazed carrots, and it's pretty much the only way I can get him to eat this vegetable, (unless I bake it into a muffin - HA) so I used a steam in bag of carrots and just tossed them with a Tbsp. of light butter, cut the honey down to 1 Tbsp. and added a few dashes of cinnamon, salt and pepper along with the rest of the ingredients.

Several decent reviews on this although, I really didn't care for these at all. I thought maybe these would be like some I have had in restaurants but, not at all what I was hoping for...

It was good, but I made a few changes. I added some cinnamon and ginger because it was lacking something.

Very easy recipe with lots of flavor! I used can carrots due to what I had on hand, drained the juice and I added one tbsp. of butter as well. Used it for a side for my chicken and dumplings! Delish!

WOW...my boyfriend loved these carrots! I served it with ginger chicken and french rolls. I cut the brown sugar in half, as recommended by several members. A "H-U-G-E T-H-A-N-K-S" to all those members who post their reviews!

This recipe was so sweet, I thought I might have to go to the dentist afterwards. I guess if you like really sweet carrots, this is the recipe for you. Also, I foud the sauce was too liquidy, maybe if you cook it longer it may thicken and mellow out a bit.

Didn't care much for the flavor.  I guess we just prefer the plain old 1 part butter 1 part brown sugar recipe.

disclaimer: I only had a few carrots so my measurements were probably off. This recipe was verrrrry sweet- a bit too sweet, (and I have quite the sweet tooth!). Carrots are sweet on their own, so don't make my mistake of using generous measurements.  Probably a great way to fool kids into eating carrots though! I used regular sized fresh carrots, quartered, but that shouldn't make a difference. Great simple way to dress up carrots though. Needs to be served with the right dish... maybe pork chops & applesauce?

The family really liked this recipe and it is easy enough to make quickly when you need more color in a meal. We always have baby carrots on hand so it was a great choice.

Made these for Thanksgiving, a little on the sweet side, but still very good.  I definitly had to cook my carrots for longer than 8-10 minutes, I'd say almost 20 minutes for them to be tender.

I'm not sure what I was expecting, but these were not good. Edible, but that's about it. I should have just made plain old cooked carrots.

OMG these were delicious. I think the only thing I would do different is 1/2 teaspoon of lemon juice, other than that it went perfect with my pot roast!

This is also a recipe I have had for a while. I made it with Thanksgiving meal and overall, it was not too popular. I think generally the crowd found it a bit sweet. Of course they were not so rude to say this, but it was about one of 2 things they did not dish up for seconds. It's simple, and fast, but try to add a dash of salt (I typically do but forgot this time) and lower the amount of sugar. As carrots are already naturally so sweet.

It was too liquidy, how could I make it thicker? I also agree that it was a bit on the sweet side so next time I plan on cutting the sugar in half.

A nice change to plain carrots, my husband really liked the sweetness of the carrots.  I cut down on the brown sugar, and next time I will use less honey too.  A great dish!

These were pretty good. I steamed the carrots, and added one less TBS of honey, and it was more than enough.

Maybe not the best glazed carrots I've ever had, but considering the dearth of ingredients, the simplicity, and the lack of any added fat, I was really impressed. I almost always have all of these things on hand, and this makes for a great veggie side for dinner in a pinch. I like how the tartness of the lemon plays off the sweetness of the honey and sugar. I always play with the ratios and cook it down some to give the sauce a thicker consistency. Tasty!

Good recipe for glazed carrots.  Had a little too much of a honey taste for me - maybe I'll use a milder honey next time.

Very yummy, made these 2x, the second time I cut back drastically on the brown sugar just adding pinches at a time until it seemed right and that made all the difference. If you don't cut back on the sugar they are very very sweet--even from the kids perspective--after cutting back on the sugar everyone agreed they liked them better.

Delicious! I included this in my Christmas Feast to rave reviews. Went with previous suggestions of less sugar and was plenty sweet.

This was alright. If I had a surplus of carrots on hand, I MIGHT consider preparing them this way (I like carrots, but I don't LOVE them). This was a nice side dish with fried pork chops.
