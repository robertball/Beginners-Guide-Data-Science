This was really lacking in flavor.  Not delicate, not plain, not simple....it was bland.  With some garlic/onion/hot sauce this could definitely be a 5 star dish.  The texture was fabulous and the ease of preparation was refreshing-no canned soups, processed cheese, etc.  If I make this again, I would definitely add a lot more flavoring agents.  Thanks for a no fuss--no massively processed food ingredient casserole!  Though their favorite cauliflower recipe is Roasted Garlic Cauliflower from this site...my eaters enjoyed it too, so it's in the keeper box.

Edit:  made it again for a better picture and it never set.  Literally the custard set in top but the bottom was a runny mess.  Used purple cauliflower as that is what we had.  Added dried shallots and roasted garlic powder for flavor.

I'm giving this five stars because I honestly wasn't expecting this to turn out that great but it DID!   I made it exactly as written, the only change I made was to add half a chopped onion.

I am rating recipe as I made it, not as written. Based on the suggestions in the previous review, I added half a sauteed onion to the cauliflower, put garlic salt in all three steps, added a little red pepper and upped the parsley significantly. Tasty!

I loved this! I halved the recipe and only used 1 egg. It turned out great!

I think I did this wrong.  The egg mixture was sort of runny on the bottom and didn't blend with the flower mixture.  Overall it was very bland.

this recipe was not precise enough for me! For example how much Cauliflower ?I substituted dill for the parsley and added a eighth of a teaspoon of cayenne pepper because we like it spicy but I would not make it again!

I liked the fact that this wasn't a cheesy dish. The sauce is good, though I did reduce the milk a little and added saut√©ed onions and mushrooms
