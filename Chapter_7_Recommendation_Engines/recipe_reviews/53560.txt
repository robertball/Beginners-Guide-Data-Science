I LOVED this dish.  I'm sure it would have been great as written, but I made a few changes and it came out really well: I diluted a can of garlic & basil pizza sauce to use in place of the tomato sauce, doubled the oregano, basil, and cumin, and added a few drops of hot sauce to the vegetable mixture.  I also cooked the rice in vegetable broth instead of plain water and added 1/2 tsp. of onion powder to the broth for even more flavour.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I was soooo tempted to add cheese to this final product, but resisted that urge to keep it healthier. Like others suggested, I used canned tomatoes. I also put in a whole mix of veggies - broccoli, carrots, zucchini, summer squash, green beans and the onion & canned tomatoes.

Super simple & tasty!

This was good, but nothing spectacular. I cooked the rice and lentils in the same pot, and instead of sprinkling the second half of the spices over top, I mixed them into the remaining tomato sauce. Instead of a fresh tomato, I used half a can of petite diced tomatoes. This has a great combination of vegetables, but I think it could benefit from a little extra tomato sauce on top, or perhaps some cayenne pepper in with the spices. Still, I thought this was pretty good, very healthy and I'll probably make it again.

Pretty nice, but if you're using red lentils, don't cook them this long! Cooking them for 15 minutes will turn them into an orange-ish paste. 5-7 minutes of cook time in boiling water will usually suffice.

This was really nice! I didn't have the vegetables mentioned in the recipe because I've been running low, so I just used some frozen mixed vegetables in the freezer and this still turned out so well! Instead of one tomato and the tomato sauce, I just used one whole can of chopped tomatoes - half cooked with the vegetables and half on top. I also added some cheese inside and on top. It was gooo-oood!

After a weekend away I was looking for a recipe to use the lentils and rice that I had in the refrigerator.  This was perfect!  Obviously I modified the recipe using lentils and rice that had been precooked and that were left-overs from a previous meal.  In addition I had left-over vegies from fajitas, and asparagus from an omelet, spaghetti sauce (homemade), and some crisp bacon.  I sauteed onion, garlic, celery and carrots...added them to the lentils and rice with the chopped bacon.  I seasoned them with hot sauce and dried red chili peppers since the fajita vegies weren't "Italian" seasoned.  Mixed in the leftover vegies and put about 1 cup of spaghetti sauce ('gravy' in our family) on top.  It was great!  My husband said, "This is another one of those dishes that we can never duplicate....darn it!"  Thanks for helping me clean out the refrigerator, and get dinner on the table without going to the store!!

I followed the recipe to a "t" with the exception of the zuccini and celery and it came out dry. Im not sure what I could have done to keep it from getting dry during the baking time. :/
any suggestions? It was ok. not as good as I was hoping it would be.

I left out the celery and added in some mushrooms, I also cooked the rice in vegetable stock instead of water. I am compiling a folder of easy vegetarian recipes for when my daughter goes to university in September. She has requested that this one definitely be included. Thankyou so much Allison.

Loved this recipe. I didn't have zucchini so I substituted broccoli. I also topped it with french onions for the last five minutes of baking. It looks like some have complained that the meal was dry or didn't have enough flavor, but mine was not like that at all. I may have used more tomato sauce than called for as I didn't measure it just threw in on until it looked like enough. This will definately become a staple recipe for our vegetarian family.

A keeper. Shredded cheese helped this dish  a lot! Used 1 large onion. 1 cup of celery & carrots + 1.5 cups of zucchini (1 small zucchini). I used 2 8 oz cans of sauce since I used more  veggies.  It would have been dry if I had not. I doubled the spices. Added S&P to the plates.

Very tasty! I used minute rice and I substituted cauliflower for the zucchini and marinara sauce for the tomato sauce, because I had those ingredients. I also crumbled up some tofu into the veggie mixture instead of using lentils because, sadly, even though I have been a vegetarian for over two years now, I cannot make lentils, per anyone's instructions. I will definitely make this dish again.

I am giving this recipe the 5 stars because although I tweaked it to meet my families particular tastes, we were all really happy with the end result. I am cooking for 3 non-dairy kids, 2 vegi. adults and three omnivores. And EVERYONE liked it. I followed some other reviewers advice: topped it with green onions for the last few minutes, added some extra veggies and was able to serve three generations of specialized eaters with no complaints. And that is a miracle.

Great Recipe. Modified it a bit to my tastes. Used organis vegetarian broth instead of water, add some ginger and used 4 oz more of the tomato paste. Should have added some more peper however. Got rave reviews from my boyfriend who is a very picky eater! Served it with some fried zucchini slices and a green salad.

Yum!
I had to alter this recipe based on what I had on hand (green lentils, brown rice and for veggies: carrots, parsnips, tomatoes, zucchini, broccoli and mushrooms- not a veg, I know), however my boyfriend and I both really liked it. I will be making this again!

I enjoyed this casserole, but made some miner changes.  Added more spice than called for, used bottled pasta sauce, and canned diced tomatoes. Overall, I thought it was alright.

It was good, but it was a little bit dry. I would add more tomato sauce more.

Thank you! My husband and I LOVED IT!! And he is a meat eater but he said he was very satisfied when he was done. I added mushrooms and red peppers just because I had that in my fridge too. I did not bake mine though. I just cooked the veggies in a pan separate and tossed it all together and served.

Hubby requested this be added to the rotation :)  Such a delicious dish for us gluten free vegetarians (aka weirdos - lol).  I used wild rice and red lentils cooked in homemade veg broth, used more carrots and zucchini and used a 15oz can of tomato sauce instead of 8 (maybe this is why others said it was dry).  Kids added moz cheese to theirs and liked it.  Thanks for posting this recipe!

Yummy! Added cheese to the top in the last 5 minutes and place under the broiler. Rave reviews, think that I might add some chopped green chillies next time for a little more kick. Thanks for a great vegetarian recipe!!

I used brown rice instead of white rice and skipped the salt.  The dish turned out a little dry, but after adding 1/2 cup of tomato basil marinara, it was delicious!  Hearty, healthy... and even my meat-eating boyfriend approved!

mmm... this was so good. I just used what was around the kitchen - carrots, yellow pepper, tomato, bunch of garlic and onion, spinach and canned black beans instead of red. It turned out great!! i used olive oil instead of veggie oil and pasta sauce instead of tomato - i also suggest using more sauce than what is suggested. i also put more spices than what was called for and added cayenne pepper as well as some hot sauce to heat it up. i added mozarella cheese to half of that top and it's great with or without the cheese. yum yum yum.

A terrific, easy and quick-to-make vegan meal.  I cooked the lentils and rice in the same pot (add lentils when 8 minutes left in rice cooking time) and added garlic salt, onion powder and veggie bouillon to the water.  Used a large jar of pasta sauce and skipped the tomato, added sliced green olives.  I love the versatility of this dish - you can pretty well add anything you want to it.  I think next time I will take one reviewers advice and top with french fried onions!

Really Yummy! I'm always looking for recipes, besides soup, with lentils because they are so healthy! I didn't realize I was out of onions, so I just left that out, it probably would have been better with, but it was still great! I used marinara sauce for the tomato sauce, and added just a little part skim shredded mozzarella cheese before baking! YUM!!!

sub'd brown rice for the white and regular lentils for the red, and cooked them together in chicken broth instead of water.  I used spaghetti sauce and canned tomatoes in place of the tomato sauce (still used the fresh tomatoes as well) really, really good. Much better than we were expecting, actually.

I find it quite amusing that some cooks didn’t use a single item from this recipe. So you didn’t make it. It is delicious as originally posted!

I gave this 5 stars because of how easy and versatile it is. I read the other reviews and made changes accordingly; I used brown rice, cooked the lentils for less time, used whatever veggies I had in the fridge (including mushrooms), doubled the spices, and topped it with a little bit of low-fat mozarella.   There are so many ways to make this and very few ways to mess it up, so it's 5 star worthy. It was a hit at my house with everyone, even the carnivores. You could add a little meat or get fancy with the veggies, even substitute spaghetti sauce for the tomato sauce. I loved it and this will be added to our regular dinner meal rotation.

Not good with tomato sauce. Next time I'll make it with chicken broth only.

One of the few recipes worthy of 5 stars - YUM-O!!!! My 16 mth old twin toddlers loved it too!  Only substitution I made was adding a cup of vegetable broth to the casserole before baking. Thank you for the perfect fasting recipe!!

Like many, I changed a few things:   1. I used a 14 oz can of Fire Roasted Chipotle tomatoes instead of a whole tomato + tomato sauce  2. I don't like celery or zucchini, so I replaced them with frozen peas and corn.  3. I cooked the rice and lentils in vegetable broth rather than water.  Aside from that I followed it exactly and it was bursting with flavor. The best part of this recipe is that it is easily adaptable to whatever vegetables you like or have on hand. I was afraid it might be too light, but the lentils gave it bulk so it was very filling. A good meal to come home to on a cold night.

Very very yummy vegetarian main dish.  I doubled the tomato sauce, exchanged red pepper for the carrots and celery, and used a can of lentil soup instead of cooking lentils.  I recommend adding a bit more rice if this is a main dish.

This was very tasty! Instead of the long grain white rice, I used brown. Instead of pouring the rest of the tomato sauce on top, I would just mix it in. Next time, I think I'll add some chopped up peppers and even some Bella mushrooms.

This was a very good recipe but I did feel that it needed tomatoes so I added some and added more tomato sauce. I also added some pepper flakes for a little spicy touch. It was really good.

This was REALLY good.  I made it exactly as written except I didn't have any celery so I used a little extra zucchini and a couple of freshly sliced mushrooms.  Thank you for a great recipe - it will be in my regular rotation now.

The BEST new recipe I have made in a long time. My husband who isn't a vegetarian is always asking me to make this. I too double the tomato sauce and use 1 can Italian diced tomatoes.

I thought this was great, easy and healthy!  I did add cheese, and I used canned tomatoes.  I made the lentils with chicken broth instead of water.  A great quick meatless meal!

it was very good! i took the suggestion of mixing the second half of the sauce with the spices before pouring it on top of the veggies, also added a bit of garlic powder to that... mixed it with grated cheese on my plate, yum! i will add some hot chili sauce next time though, just to give it more of an "oomph!"

I loved this.  Better yet, my son who is vegan really liked it.  I took the suggestion of a previous reviewer and cooked the rice and lentils in vegetable broth.  The store was out of zucchini, so I substituted broccoli, and I used a can of seasoned diced tomatoes and seasoned tomato sauce, one 8 oz can in the casserole and one on top.  Actually that is the best thing about this recipe - it is very adaptable.  I am really looking forward to experimenting with different combinations.  Oh, and it was even better a couple of days later as leftovers.

This gets a three because of the use of white rice. Brown is more nutrients. Just prepare according to directions on the box or bag. The tomato sauce on top needs some help. Mix the herbs in with it instead of just putting them on top, or perhaps even leaving it off altogether and mix the whole can in with the other half. Not a bad recipe, but it just needs a big of tweaking to make it four or five stars.

Awesome recipe! I was looking for something other than a curry to use the mountains of lentils we have in the cupboard and this was great :) It was similar to another recipe that just throws everything into the dish and bakes it for 1 1/2 hours, and thats what I did here, cause Im lazy I guess ;P (be sure to mix it half way through if you use this method) Turned out great, lentils weren't mush either. I added all the spices into the lentils and rice and topped it with tomato sauce for the last 20 mins. Very yum, hardly any left and I only just made it! (I also threw in some peas and yellow beans I had)

Really good.  I've made it a few times.  Once we didn't have red lentils, so I used brown.  Still good, but the consistency isn't as smooth.  Since we're not vegan, I used chicken broth for the rice and lentils instead of water.  Also added crumbled, browned sausage to the casserole.  Good with brown rice, too!  Very tasty combination!

Wonderful recipe.  I had to substitute a little with things I had on hand and it all worked well.  I used garlic powder, canned tomatoes, and broccoli in place of the garlic cloves, fresh tomatoes, and zucchini.  I also added cayan pepper.  The results were a little dry but otherwise well-received by my family.  I can't wait to make it again and see what else I can do with it.

Quite tasty! Lots of flavor and filling. Suggest sautéing the veggies before adding the tomato sauce. Can use more tomato sauce than the recipe suggests. Used half a can of sauce mixed in and then half baked on top.

Not bad, healthy, though I did add mozzarella cheese on top since I had some I wanted to use up. My wife loved it, and she's not usually a big fan of lentils.

Very tasty! Added a bit more spice-cumin and cayenne pepper, because we like it hot. Also, some feta.  Used leftovers to stuff green peppers the next day. Add some cheese on top and bake to heat through.

I made this in an Instant Pot  - I didn't have white rice and didn't want to go to the store.  The IP cooks brown rice in 25 minutes

Sauteed onions and garlic in the IP and then added
everything but the carrots and celery.Cooked on "pressure" for 23 min.   Instant release.   Added carrots and celery and cooked on pressure for 3 minutes.  Turned it all out into a 9 x 13 pan and heated at 350 for about 15 minutes until bubbling.
Generous servings for 6.....

Big hit w my vegan daughter. I did shortcut a few things, based on what was in my fridge. 1- cook the rice and lentils together.  They turn out fine. 2- use Marina sauce, its faster and already has oregano, etc.  3- i used frozen peas, because i always have them i would think fresh green beans would also work. Great meal, the meat eating guys also loved it.

Added yellow, orange and green bell peppers instead of celery. Also mixed in 1/4 cup of shredded parmesan cheese and about 1/2 tsp of crushed red pepper to make it spicy. The family loved it.

This was delicious! I read the comments and added the mushrooms as someone suggested since we love them. I also watched my lentils carefully so they didn't overcook. Lastly I cooked the rice in water with a package of onion soup mix. Outside of that I followed the recipe and it was great! A great vegan dish!

I followed the recipe for the most part as written except I added 1/2 cup of crumbled herbed feta and 2 minced serrano peppers for some spicy bite. The feta really put it over the top for us. The next time I think I'll swap out the tomato sauce for Rotel tomatoes with green chilies.

My mistake is that I assume all recipes labelled vegan are healthy.  I don't do white rice or canned vegetables.  I used short grain brown rice and my own tomato sauce.  With some adjustments it worked out fine.

Great general idea of the recipe above. Did increase the amount of tomatoe sauce to 1.5  15oz cans. Also tripled the amount of spices used. 
The veggies were increased to include mushrooms and zucchini squash. 
Pretty sure that the recipe would work wonderfully with which ever veggies are on hand.

Very good! I used steamed broccoli and cauliflower as the veggies cuz that’s what I had on hand. Also used one can diced tomatoes instead of using a fresh. I also put a small 8 oz can of tomato sauce on top and added garlic and other Italian spices to the sauce to make it more flavorful. I used brown rice to make it more healthy and zero oil.

Too much work and sheer number of dishes to be washed for the rather boring outcome.

FYI: if you're going to try it, DON'T double the spices or the recipe. Too much of both. I had to add cheese to make it decently palatable after the volume of spices. Not the author of the recipe's fault.

I read other reviews and worried that this might come out dry, but I made the recipe as written, without any additional sauce, and was not disappointed. The only substitution I made was to use brown rice instead of white. The recipe is listed in the "Main Dishes" category and says it's supposed to be enough for 6 servings, but I'd say it's more like 4 servings. In my opinion, it would be 6 servings if served as a side dish.  Served this with naan bread.  I'd make this again.

I mostly followed the recipe but did add cauliflower and peppers. It was good, but both my husband and I like spice so we added Sriracha which was very good. I will make it again but not as a main dish.

Yummy! However, you definitely don’t need to cook the lentils for so long. 5-7 minutes should be enough.  Cooking the rice in veggie broth also helps add flavor.

I made this as written and thought it was a bit dry. Next time, I will add all the sauce to the mix before putting it into the oven. I will also use a different lentil, perhaps green or brown. The red seem to soak up all the liquid from the veggies. I topped it with some nutritional yeast for a cheesy taste. I also tried cooking the rice and lentils together. Epic fail. Tossed them and started over. Thank you for the recipe.

Excellent dish. After reading some of the reviews where cooks found it to be dry, I used a can of diced tomatoes rather than a fresh one. We found it to be perfect casserole consistency. The only thing I had to purchase was a zucchini, so it's definitely a good dish for lean times when one needs to eat out of the pantry. I've never had a casserole where spices are sprinkled on the top before baking rather than incorporated into the mixture (half of the spices are sprinkled, half are stirred in) and I'm still not entirely sure if that was to my liking. I will definitely make it again.

Other than doubling the recipe, we substituted fresh basil leaves for the dried basil, and added toasted sourdough bread crumbs mixed with shredded mozzarella cheese on the top while it baked. It was good, but rather mild in terms of the spices, since my partner & I really like well-spiced food. In our humble opinion, the spices could've been doubled with good effect, especially the garlic.

I made this recipe as is, and we all enjoyed it, including my kids. I didn't fry the veggies for long enough and they were a bit crisp. As there was no suggested time for that step, I'd say try 10 min, especially for the celery. I used yellow zucchini, which was nice. 2 celery stalks, 1 medium carrot and half a zucchini worked well. Don't forget to rinse and drain the lentils well before cooking, especially red lentils.

My husband says I cannot make any recipe even the first time without changing something, and he is right.  On this recipe, I more than doubled the amount of vegetables.  I also changed the method a bit, using my cast iron skillet to saute' the veggies and also as the casserole dish.  Why waste all that flavor and dirty another pan by transferring it to another dish, I thought?   

I deleted the tomato sauce altogether and used three heaping serving spoons of middle eastern yogurt, instead.  My stomach does not like tomato sauces, and when I could not find oregano in my spice cupboard, I switched the spice family from Italian to Indian and went with Turmeric with my Cumin and Basil.

I cooked one medium onion, chopped, on medium and low, along with the minced three cloves of garlic until the onions were clear and garlic browned, then pushed them to the side as the carrots took the center of the skillet.  I used two, about 8 inches long and about the diameter of an American quarter on the fat end.  I chopped them into small pieces, not quite fine.  I used three 7" celery stalks (after trimming), and sliced them thin and they moved into the center of the skillet once the carrots were about halfway to done.  The zucchini was nice and fat and about 9 inches long and I used all of it.  I chopped it more coarse than the carrots as it is a softer veggie.  I added it on top of the celery and stirred them together after a couple of minutes, then gave them a couple of more minutes after

Good flavors, good nutrition. Lots of pots/pans, though. I used the same pot for the rice and lentils. Lentils got mushy. For next time, I'm going to try using brown rice (allowing more time).

Made it for my women's group, but made a few changes.First, I had leftover rice so I didn't need to cook any. Second, I only had green lentils, which require more cooking. Third,  I used one whole zucchini. Fourth, I used the entire 8 oz. can of tomato sauce because it appeared to be too dry when I combined everything. Fifth, I used a second 8 oz. can of sauce to pour over the top. Everyone loved it!

I don't think 8 oz. of tomato sauce is enough. I added the 8 oz of tomato sauce and one 15-1/2 oz can of stewed tomatoes and even then, when it came out of the oven, it wasn't bubbly.  It was moist though.

a. this just doesn't have enough veggies. try adding shredded cabbage; b. there's no way carrots cook well enough - steam 'em 8 min or so before adding them to the saute part; c. when cooking the lentils, add some better than bouillon veggie base - you're welcome; d. replace the 'tomato sauce' with some Newman's marinara. In general, I added more veggies, seasoned more and sprinkled a bit of parmesan on top - if you're vegan, forego the cheese, but the rest I stand by! :D Oh, I also added chicken better than bouillon to the rice as it was cooking and used BROWN rice, but again, if you're vegan, you can find your own seasoning.

I spiced it up a bit and I didnt have any of the  veggies so instead I added a  bag of steamed soybeans. Wow! Talk about good. Rice, Lentils and soybeans. So healthy. Also added 1 can of diced tomatoes instead. This recipe is versatile. Will make again.

I would definitely make this recipe again. I made a big casserole dish of it so i think I will be eating good for the week. I added jalepeno and a couple extra spices because i had some on hand. It came out really great. and it was very filling

As with any meal I adjust based on a fam of 6 and plan for leftovers. I only had frozen veggies but sautéed the extra water out at a high temperature. Used Fresh onion and garlic, frozen bell pepper strips  and yellow zucchinii. I accidently used a pot too small for my 2c lentils. Added tomato buillon to those and the rice. As a omnivore,  I added Cooked beef fajita (bite size pcs) and cooked chopped bacon :-D I will have to add the sauce after it's all combined in one dish. My best chance is a 13"x9". Lol. Thanks for the great dinner idea. 5 stars!!

Phenomenal.  The only changes I made were doubling the recipe and using an entire can of "robust and zesty" pasta sauce as the tomato sauce.  Very easy to save and microwave later.

I had no red lentils so I changed it up with green one and instead of cooking rice and lentils with plan water i used vegetable broth. Very good recipe, quick and easy.

Very good recipe! As others suggested, I used a 15 oz. can of tomato sauce w/Italian herbs, and a pinch of cayenne and it came out amazing!I also only boiled the red lentils for 7 minutes to avoid mushy lentils.  Will definitely be in my rotation.

Made a couple of changes per other reviews. Cooked lentils in veggie broth. Used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil to sauté veggies.  Added mushrooms instead of celery, and a full jar of marinara sauce. The lentils took double the recommended amount of time to cook. Sprinkled some Colby cheese on top prior to baking. Overall, another great dish to add to the rotation.

This was good.  I did add parmesan cheese on top before baking.  I enjoyed it but the boys in family did notice the meat not there.  Thats what happens when I try to slip one by them.

im a college student and this was cheap and easy to throw together in the pan.  im not big on measuring and like to get the most nutritional value so i used a whole zucchini, and twice as many carrots (i didnt have celery on hand) and just eyeballed the herbs/seasoned to taste could have cooked a bit longer, and used more pasta sauce.  i also threw in some crushed red pepper flakes which added a kick.  I'm a vegetarian and added a pack of the "smart taste" sausage which i browned before adding.  very hearty and filling while low in fat and cals.

My family and I really enjoyed this recipe.  I think that it is a very healthy and flexible recipe.  I thought that it had a very strong tomato flavor but it was still very good.  We didnt have celery and it was fine without it. I did put some cheese on top and I thought that it was a great addition but it was not needed.  I thought that the carrots were still a bit crunchy so I would maybe reccomend cooking them a little first but some people may like the texture. Overall a great recipe that I will make again at some point.

I made this tonight with the following substitutions/additions:  I cooked instant brown rice with the lentils in 2 cups of chicken broth and 1 cup of water (and more as was needed)...i used diced potatoes, peas, carrots, onion and celery as vegetables...then i added some cheese to it, i had a little mozzarella, a little swiss and a little jack/cheddar mix that i threw in at the end as i mixed everything together, then put it all in the casserole and just let it sit in the oven for a few minutes.  It was very good!  The lentils make it pretty rich, nice and healthy and warm!  For non-vegetarians, this would be good with a little ground beef in it!

My roommates and I really didn't like this.  Well, 1 of them said it was "alright".  We added extra veggies (other squash and things from the farmer's market) as well as extra herbs and cheese as suggested by other reviewers and found it exceedingly bland and dry.  So bland, in fact, that I will not be making this recipe again.

We are low-carbing so I cut out the rice and it was great.  I found that an easier method was to steam whichever veggies we were using (this recipe lends itself to whichever combo of veggies you have on hand), combine with tomato sauce and transfer to a baking dish.  The most recent time I made this dish I topped it with some leftover cheese sauce which made it a little like a veggie lasagne, but without the pasta and it was really yummy.

The dish was very good and tasty (I did add 1/2 pound sweet cooked italian sausage). However, took almost an hour and a half to prepare to put into the oven. All that chopping is so tiresome. So, I've only given this dish 3 stars because of the length of preparation time.

Similar to another reviewer, I'm lazy. I sauted the veggies, mixed them with uncooked rice and lentils, etc... baked in the oven at 350, for about 45 minutes... It didn't really need to cook much longer, in my opinion. Good post, thanks!

I enjoyed this very much, I also tried it in a tortilla and wrapped like a burrito.  It was awesome.

This was a delicious meatless meal for Lent. I didn't have zuchinni, so I used fresh mushrooms. I also didn't have a fresh tomato, so I used half a can of diced tomatoes including the liquid. Definitely a keeper recipe!!!

didn't have zucchini but made with the other veggies and used pizza sauce. added the extra seasoning which made it taste great. Put some mozz on it after it came out of hte oven and replaced the lid for a minute, and it was great :) easy to make!

Needs some adjustments to the written instructions. Enjoyed the flavour, but my lentils were way too mushy with suggested cooking time. Will try again, and shorten lentil cooking time and maybe add some cheese. Thanks for the idea. It was tasty...

Really Yummy! My vegetarian brother took the leftovers. I modified a bit, due to what I had on hand... olive oil instead of vegetable oil, canned tomatoes, didn't have zucchini or basil, just increased celery and carrots. I also sprinkled cheese on top when it came out of the oven. Delicious!

Made with left over spaghetti sauce and green bean because that is what I had on hand. It was good and I will make aging with a few changes. Next time I will add some pepper, also think it would be good with mushrooms.

Cooking this was a lot of fun, it smelled so delicious. I added a cup of mushrooms as well. I also made my own tomato sauce so it had all the flavors I love in it. I would recommend more sauce as well. It smelled great when cooking the vegetables, but after baking it all together it kind of lost some of the original intensity I thought it would have. Despite this it was delicious and healthy and I'll be making it again.

I'm giving this 3 stars not because it is bad, but because it is not anything special. Tasty enough really, just nothing I oooh-ed and aaah-ed about while eating it. I really liked the lentils and zucchini in there. Even the celery. But you know it's not the greatest meal ever if the celery is one of the best things about it. The sauce was fairly dull. Not sure what half of the tomato sauce was doing on top. Maybe stopping it from drying out? If so, fair enough. It wasn't dry which is always a relief with casseroles. Otherwise, I would have prefered to mix it in, so that it could blend in with the herbs and garlic. It is a little plain there, sitting on the top as is. I grated some emmental cheese on it when reheating, that helped. All together, really not a bad meal. But not something I'd happily serve to friends.

I really like this recipe! Very healthy, relatively easy and good. I may try adding raisins next time - seems that might be a good addition with the flavor combos. Very happy to find yet another good way to use lentils and veggies.

This was okay, but that's it. Too dry, and a little on the bland side.
