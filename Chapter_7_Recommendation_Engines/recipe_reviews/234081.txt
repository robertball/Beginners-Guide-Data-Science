My son is addicted to the Restaurant Style Chicken Nachos recipe on this site, so I always have tortilla chips on hand. I was looking for something else to go with the chips -- I love nachos, but unlike Mr. Pickypants, I get tired of them -- and found this recipe. I followed the recipe almost exactly -- I have no tolerance for heat in my food, so I omitted the jalapenos (and indeed, that mere 1/8 t. of cayenne was at my threshold!). This dip is light and flavorful, nothing like the heavy, pasty stuff that comes in a can; and it took just a few minutes to make! Thanks, PresidentJim; you have my vote! 3/10/2014: Just a couple of notes: If you drain the beans well, you will get a thicker dip. And although you will think it needs salt, don't do it! You'll get plenty of salt from the chips.

This dip is wonderful! My hubby loved it! I did add 2 roasted green chilies, 1/8 tsp. of garlic salt and a pinch of cumin. No more buying the little can of bean dip!

This was a very simple recipe, I like that part. The suggested amount of salt was WAY TOO MUCH, in my opinion. I'd cut it in half, if not more. I didn't have any jalepenos or cayenne pepper, so I added chipolte pepper powder. I put some cheese on top and microwaved it for about 30-45 seconds and I've got a delicious, cheap, easy dip!

Great flavor but way too salty.  Next time I won't add the salt.

This was super!  I used a can of Rosarita Refried Beans because I didn't have whole ones.  I omitted the jalapenos and the cayenne pepper and substituted 2 chipotle peppers in adobo sauce and about 2 tsp. of the sauce.  I also omitted the salt completely.  I added about an 1/8 tsp. of cumin, also.  We ate it with fresh veggies instead of chips; I'm trying to break my chip addiction. We eat hummus with fresh veggies, so I figured, "Why not?" This is one of those wonderful recipes that you can spice up any way you want! Thank you Mr. President!

It was good, but way too salty for me. I would recommend cutting the salt in half at the least maybe even to 1/4 tsp and taste it before adding more. If you want heat add half a jalapeño seeded and diced.

I followed the recipe exactly the first time I made it. The following times I added a bit of olive oil to give the dip more creaminess for easier dipping. I make this now instead of buying premade dip.

So easy to make and I really liked it.  Blended it long enough to give it a nice, light whipped consistency.  My beans were low sodium so I did need the salt.  Used just 2 of the jalapeno rings, but all of the vinegar (I used rice vinegar, which I like for it's mild flavor).  Added cumin, adjusted all spices to taste.   Thank you.

After tasting, I increased the amounts of all of the spices quite a bit, and threw in some cumin.

Very good! I didn't have onion powder so I used dried onions and since I made this for my littles I completely nixed the hot peppers. There's still a mild kick with the paprika and cayenne, so it was perfect! I'm very pleased with this recipe and will for sure be making it again! Thanks

Excellent!  So much cheaper to make than the canned stuff you can buy in the store and so much better.  Definitely worth your time to make this!

I wasn't too sure about the vinegar but ended up working great. I did have to add more beans though. I ended up basically tripling the recipe except for the vinegar. :)

I used a stick blender and this came together quickly! Better the next day. I also used fresh onion and more jalapeños to our taste.

Yum! Next time I’ll double the recipe. Started with the original recipe, except using taco seasoning instead of the individual spices since so many reviewers complained about the salt and added cumin. Wanted it spicier and creamier, so added 1 tablespoon low fat cream cheese and more jalapeños and a little jalapeño juice. Smooth, spicy, and tasty.

it was a little too vinegary for me. next time I make it I will substitute the vinegar with 1/2 distilled water and the other 1/2 the brine from the jalapeno jar.

This was my first time to make bean dip. My friends who are bean dip lovers said this was fantastic. I reduced the salt based on other reviews. Great recipe.

This was good.  I don't like spicy foods, so I left out the hot peppers.  Even my husband liked it.  Next time, though, I will halve the vinegar.

It was good, just too salty. I used half the salt and jalapeño juice instead of vinegar and it was great! I garnished it with fresh cilantro and paprika.

I liked this recipe but I thought it was a little too salty for my taste.  I will be making it again but cutting the salt down.  Also, 3 jalapeno slices do not give a lot of heat.  I would recommend trying it and then adding more to your liking.

I've made a similar recipe of my own. You can also add fat free Greek yogurt for extra calcium and protein. Also works well with whole roasted garlic cloves and smoked paprika.
