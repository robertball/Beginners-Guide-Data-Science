Classic Chicken Marsala this isn't, but I don't care WHAT you call it, this is just a wonderful dish. With the exception of using less oregano (just sprinkled a bit over the flour-dredged chicken) and adding a couple of cloves of fresh, minced garlic with the mushroom mixture, I prepared this exactly as written. Colorful presentation, perfect blend of flavors. I served this with penne pasta and additional sauteed fresh spinach as sides.  Outstanding recipe!

Ok - here is the deal.  I just made this tonight.  I thought it was good - Although the marsala (I used a dry marsala) was a little too overpowering -next time I would use 1/2 C to 3/4 C - not a whole cup.  I would use a little more mushrooms and sundried tomatoes.   I would use less butter (my god, 3/4 of a cup??) and I would use more spinach.  Actually, I did use more spinach - the recipe calls for 1/2 cup and I used about 2 cups. This will probably taste even better tomorrow, so the flavors have a chance to "marry" overnight - I probably would make it again, but next time I would:
use more portabello mushrooms, more sundried tomatoes, more spinach, less butter and less marsala.  This recipe has all the ingredients for an excellent dish - the amounts of the ingredients just need to be tweeked a little bit.

This was fantastic! The sun dried tomatoes add a great flavor.  I used tomatoes packed in oil so I cut the butter almost in half and it still turned out perfect!  I also added a clove of garlic and a green onion to the sauce for a little more kick.

Winner, winner, chicken marsala dinner!  This
recipe was exceptional, and received rave reviews from my marsala loving husband.  I followed the recipe pretty closely, using less butter, added more mushrooms & minced garlic.  I added the wine and about 2/3 cup of chicken stock to the pan with the mushrooms and tomatoes, reduced for about ten minutes, then added a good amount of rough chopped fresh spinach, and finished with a splash of heavy cream.  Placed the chicken back in the pan with sauce while hubby and I finished happy hour.  Yummy!  Will make this many more times.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Really good recipe! We have tried a few other Chicken Marsala recipes, but none of them were this good. I made 3 small changes that made the dish perfect for us: I added about 1 teaspoon minced garlic with the mushrooms. I stirred in about 1/2 c. cream when I added the spinach (makes it smooth, creamy and richer). And I also put the chicken back into the gravy to simmer once the mushrooms were tender, for about 15 minutes. Our only Chicken Marsala recipe from now on!

This turned out beautifully.  This is my first review because so often, the people who review a recipe on this site, give it a poor rating and then detail all the substitutions they made.  Sometimes, it is hilarious!  It seems to me, if you rate a recipe, it should be prepared as written.  I try to make the recipe as written and make adjustments later for our own personal taste.  Unless ---I don't have all the ingredients!

Easy and very good.  When you pan-fry the chicken, try adding the marsala wine for a little more flavor.

I have never received so many compliments on a recipe!  Actually made it for guests on a Saturday night and they liked it so much, I repeated it for Sunday night guests.  Tasted better than many restaurant versions.  A definite "do again" especially if for a special occasion.

Probably one of the best dishes I have made in awhile! My family inhaled this chicken. I did sautee a large bag of spinach in olive oil and garlic first off and set aside. I also omitted the butter completely and used a little more olive oil instead. I had no problem with a nice thick sauce that was incredible. I cooked the chicken until lightly browned on both side (but not cooked through) and placed them in a baking dish, topped with the garlic spinach, and topped that with the marsala mushroom and sundried tomato sauce. Covered with foil and placed in a low oven of about 300 degrees for 30-40 minutes. This chicken just was so tender and juicy and Im telling you amazing with flavor. No leftovers at all. Will make again very soon....thanks!

I have my own marsala recipe that I usually use, but I though I would try something different.  I shouldn't have.  I wasn't at all impresse with this recipe. It definatly wasn't much for eye candy.  Sauce was brown, the spinach turned greenish brown and the tomatoes were redish brown.  It was a pretty brown meal.  The tomatoes added a unnaturally sweet taste and the spinach just got in the way.  Also the breading on the chicken is bland, and since it wasn't cooked with the sauce the flavors don't get into the meat at all.  I won't be making this again.

I cut the butter amount in half & added 2 cloves of garlic to this. I also boiled my tomatoes in about 1/2 cup beef broth before adding them. This was a big hit with my family.

Delicious - I made this for my husband and one of his friends one night and they loved it - I've been making it with less butter than it calls for (because I accidentally did it the first time, probably 6-8 Tbsp,) and it's great like that too.  I also added more spinach because I love the veggies as much as the chicken!  Great recipe - thanks!

Excellent, robust dish right here! I follwed this to the letter, and it turned out superb! I read many reviews discussing the amount of butter wasn't necessary, and more veggies should be added, but I have to disagree. This is over 5 stars as written. I made this for a dinner with my family on the weekend and I got rave reviews and requests for this again. The flavors in this dish are wonderful, and the amountof wine is perfect. Just be sure to let this simmer a good 10 minutes after it's added so it thickens nicely. This would be wonderful for entertaing because it really is beautiful when plated. I served this roasted garlic mashed potatoes and roasted baby carrots with herbs. Only wish I took a picture, next time for sure. Thank you :)

Turned out very well, however the Mushrooms over powered the dish by sheer size. I made this dish a second time and used button mushrooms and it seemed to be more in proportion.  Overall recipe is excellent.

WOW!  Everyone loved this.  Four really picky kids had THIRDS!  I used asparagus because I did not have spinach, and I used I can't believe it's not butter instead of butter.  My sun-dried tomatoes came packed in olive oil so I drained them and used the oil from there to cook in.  I think this may be the most praised meal I've ever made :)

tastes great and looks awesome!  We did alter the recipe a little just by adding more chicken, sherry wine, and more of the veggies.

Used two chicken breasts, and lots of sliced mushrooms.  Did not add butter and used fresh tomatoes put in just before the spinach.  Served over linguini.  We really enjoyed this.  Easy and healthy.  Probably 4.5 stars.

This was was very easy to make and was the best chicken Marsala I ever made! I have added a little more oregano because we like the stronger taste of it. also went to 3 cups of spinach as this cooks down and we love the extra spinach. Also went up higher on the wine to 1 1/2 cups  for the extra sauce to put over pasta. 5 stars!!

I'm a horrible cook and yet this recipe was easy enough for me to pull off.  My other half said this is by far the best meal I ever made him and his friend was very impressed and said this recipe is "restaurant quality" So if you want an easy receipe that tastes good and is hard to mess up -- this is it!!

Now that I am re-reading this recipe, I realize that I forgot to use flour...when the sauce wasn't thickening, I added some corn starch, and it worked out fine. I also used the sauce over top sirloin steak instead of chicken. not only is this a simple recipe, it is great and delicious! Thank you for sharing. :)

This was very good.  It's always great to find new ideas for chicken, and since I had the sun-dried tomatoes and spinach on hand, I was happy to find this combination!  I'm on a campaign against naked chicken!  I did add some garlic, and next time, I will add two cloves.  Really rich and satisfying--I served it over whole wheat linguini.

This is excellent! I really like the combination of flavors. Such simple ingredients, easily prepared for a quick meal. I sauteed extra spinach to serve with it, since we had lots on hand and love it... I opted out of the flouring and didn't add all the butter... I'm sure it would've been even more rich and delicious had I prepared it that way, but it was still wonderful!

Excellent!  My only ingredient changes were to add two cloves of minced garlic to the sauce and I used a lot more spinach - about 3 cups worth - to add more veggies.  I slightly altered the cooking method by returning the chicken to the pan with the sauce just before adding the spinach, to give the chicken a little more flavor from the sauce.  This was an excellent dish - I do think it needs the garlic, but all that depends on your preference.  Thanks, Shanou!

I don't care for sun dried tomatoes so I left them out but the addition of spinach was inspired. I do wish there was more and  "saucier" sauce (for pasta). I tried adding about a cup of the salted pasta cooking water (a quick and easy sauce stretcher and thickener and one of the most useful cooking tips I've ever gotten) and letting it simmer for a bit but it still wasn't quite the consistency or amount I was wanting. Still very tasty though.

I really liked this (though DH didn't care for the sun dried tomatoes).  I did increase the spinach to 1 c. and decreased the butter to about 1/2 c.  I actually prefer this dish to another chicken marsala recipe I tried from this site.

This dish is wonderful and tastes like something you would get at a fine restaurant!  It is so flavorful and the recipe is perfect just as it.  I have used baby bellas and added more spinach on occasion, but it really is great just as it is.

We loved this!! It makes a very nice presentation. I followed it as written except I put the chicken back in the pan w cooked spinach, sub dried tomatoes and Marsala wine to let the flavors soak in the chicken better and to heat up the chicken at the same time. Delish!!!

We thoroughly enjoyed this dish! I added chopped onions with the mushrooms, and used a sweet red wine instead of marsala, which I didn't happen to have.  I love marsala, so I will try it again sometime with that.  I think you could reduce the amount of butter used without compromising the dish at all.  There was excess butter than separated out of the sauce on the bottom of the pan.

This was very good. I didn't flour my breasts because I was being lazy but it was still very good. I like to keep my dinners in the ten dollar range so this was a little expensive with the sun dried tomatoes and the portobellas but for a special meal it was lovely. I served this with garlic mashed potatoes as suggested and they went perfectly with it.

FANTASTIC.  Going in my file of recipes that I always fall back on!  I was skeptical because of the few naysayers among the reviewers, but I'm so glad I made this.  I reminds me in flavor of Chicken Madiera from Cheesecake Factory.

My alterations: used margarine instead of butter and only used 1/2 a stick.  Added five gloves of minced garlic and 1.5c chicken broth to the sauce.  Increased marsala to 2c.  Used one entire jar of sundried tomatoes, drained and chopped.  Added 3c fresh spinach when I was ready to serve and covered for 1-2 minutes to wilt.  Served with cream cheese mashed potatoes and had enough sauce to use as a gravy for them.  YUM!

Those who say this mean is brown are definitely cooking everything too long.  This was bright green and red colorful on my plate.  And scrumptious besides!

this was a great, easy to make  recipe. i didn't have fresh spinach, so i used a box of frozen chopped spinach, sauteed it seperatly with garlic and butter.  i put the spinach on the plate first and topped it with the chicken and then the mushroom mixture. my husband loved it.  it's going to be a new 'company's coming recipe'. thanks for all the tips!

Yum - this was amazing. I took half the marsala and cooked the chicken in it and used the other half for the spinach/mushrooms etc. It made the chicken tastier. I used a cup of marsala for 6 servings and used 1/4 c. butter - less than the recipe called for. I used sun dried tomatoes packed in oil which was why I didn't use much butter. I used an entire bag of spinach (9oz. dry). I served it over garlic mashers. It was a big hit!

awesome! this is an amayzing recipe. i modified it slightly to taste. i almost doubled the amount of everything. exept the marsalla. ading a half cup more marsalla and some chicken stock. because i used extra every thing, i baked it in the oven for an extra 10 minutes or so. this dish seams to go especialy well with a nice glas cheep cabernet savignon :] definatly add some chicken stock like a cup or two!

This was an excellent dish. We enjoyed it so much.I left the breasts in the sauce while it reduced down somewhat.Spooned the spinach onto the plates and served the breasts on top of the spinach with a little added sauce. Great flavor! Thanks Shannon.

This dish ranks at the top of presentation and taste ratings !  Since I had no portobello mushrooms, I used 1 1/2 cups of button mushrooms; also 1 cup of fresh spinach.  To 1 cup of boiling water I reconstituted the sun-dried tomotoes and 1/2 cup shiitakes and even added the soaking water to the recipe.  We used good quality Marsala, but 3/4 cup.  Serve with mashed potatoes (no garlic needed).

This is really quite good, but like others who made the suggestions, I doubled the amount of mushrooms (1 lb sliced), added 2 small cloves of minced garlic, doubled the amount of spinach, halved the amount of Marsala, and added about 1/4 cup chicken stock. I also used boneless chicken thighs instead of breasts. I would consider this an "entertaining guests" kind of meal because the presentation can be elegant yet not very complicated. It's a robust recipe that can survive a lot of tweaking. This one will stay on our go-to recipes.

I was really expecting a 5 star recipe but no one cared for the sauce at all.. My kids and hubby liked the chicken but the sauce was just bland. I always make the recipe the way it states the 1st time then if I don't like it I make changes but I just don't care for this one. The tomatoes I don't usually use so I did have to make a trip for them but I wont make this again. sorry.

This is definitely a repeat for us!  First of all I was halving the recipe.  I salted and peppered the chicken, then sprinkled with a little oregano – not nearly the amount specified.  You can also cut back on the flour.  I used about 1 T. and it was plenty for my two chicken breast halves.  I cooked the chicken and placed it in a warm oven while I proceeded to the sauce.  I cut way back on the butter and only used 2 T. I also really bumped up the amount of spinach, probably quadrupling it.  I found that once the mushrooms, tomatoes and marsala are added, there is no need to cook over medium heat for 10 minutes.  In fact, in doing so, all of the liquid evaporated, leaving no sauce at all. Next time I will turn the heat way down and gently simmer for maybe 5 minutes max.  I may even cover it while simmering.  Then I’ll add a little cornstarch slurry to give the sauce some body, but just a little.  Then I’ll stir in the spinach.  This had excellent flavor and it is certainly worth doing again – we both loved it.  But I’ll keep the changes I made this time and cut way back on the simmering next time.  This gets 5 stars for fabulous potential!

Delicious!! I would definitely make it again.  I did add a lot more spinach and used less butter.  I will also use an egg to coat the chicken next time.

I agree with another reviewer - More mushrooms and spinach, less butter and Marsala (1/2 cup each) That's what I did the second time, and with those adjustments it's 5+stars! I had never made chicken Marsala so I can't compair it to other recipes, but this is on my list of "Foods I can make that taste like groumet restaurant fare"

This is very peculiar.  I believe there is great potential with all of my favourite ingredients.  Somehow it was missing something and I will have to figure it out. I cut back on a lot of the ingredients for two reasons.  I was only making it for two and I just felt that some things, like the butter, were just too much.  I did add extra baby spinach and could even have probably added more.  My tomatoes were oil packed, I reduced to 1/2 cup. I added the Marsala to the tomatoes to measure 1 cup.  Felt it was plent.  Next time will reduce the tomatoes even more.  I agree with another review in that it wasn't colourful but that was not a distraction; the baby spinach made up for it.  I was short on the mushrooms, my fault.  Will check my ingredients more carefully next time.  All in all good, but needs tweaking.

I love marsalas and I love to do new things with them, so this was right up my alley. I used a dry marsala and my homemade sundried tomatoes, so this dish was slightly acidic (the result of my ingredients) - I fixed this by adding half a teaspoon of brown sugar. I also love the sauce so much I made about 1/2 more, by adding chicken stock and another splash of marsala - this gave me enough sauce to drench the rice! If you are using dry sun-dried tomatoes don't forget to soak them for 15 minutes in hot water, and if you are using oil packed sun-dried tomatoes don't forget to drain them. In the future I would likely add a clove of garlic and some thinly sliced onion to the veggies.

My husband loved this recipe, although I did make a few modifications. I added garlic and red onion to the mushroom and tomato mix. To lighten it up, I fried the chicken in olive oil flavored spray and reduced the butter from 3/4 cup to 2 Tbsp. It still tasted great!

this was one of the best chicken dishes i have ever made. i used 3/4 cup of marsala and also added 3/4 cup of low fat milk mixed with 1 tablespoon of flour which made sauce creamier.  also added more spinach than recipe calls for.  kept it warm in oven until serving. chicken was very moist.

This recipe was awesome! Took advice on cutting the butter almost in half.  Made this for a party of 50 guests!  Everybody raved about it!  Highly recommend this recipe for a big or small party or get together!  Can't wait to try other recipes from this website.  I also added some button mushrooms with the portabello's.  Can't wait to make it again for my family!  It's definitly a keeper.

I made this for my boyfriend recently and he loved it. The only thing I would change next time is the amount of sun-dried tomamtoes, I would use about half of what the recipe called for. They seemed to over power the flavor of the marsala a bit. Other than that this was a success!!

Made this the other night, and it was just okay.  The chicken was good, but did not care for the marsala sauce on it.  Maybe it was the marsala wine I used, but it just left a bad taste in my mouth all night.  I may make this again with a different wine sauce, but loved the portobello mushrooms and spinach - left out the sundried tomatoes.

Really like the extra veggies, only difference I sliced the chicken breast in half lengthwise and then pounded them thinner. I served it with pasta, but next time I'll try the mashed potatoes.

This was a delicious, rich and beautiful dish! My husband loved it too. I would serve this for company. Just for kicks, I might try adding a clove or two of garlic next time, since I'm a garlic fiend.

The chicken was fantastic. The sauce was pretty good. The recipe needs several cloves of minced garlic, sauteed with the mushrooms before adding the other ingredients for the sauce. About 1/2 c. chicken broth so that there is some sauce left after the marsala wine reduces. Also, i would cut back in the sun-dried tomatoes ALOT. And i would dice them. They have a strong flavor (i used oil packed) and they were too much and too big. I might even add a good slurry of cream or half and half next time to mellow out some of the bright acidic flavor. Finally, don't bother making this if you don't have a decent bottle of marsala. Don't get the "cooking wine"...go to the wine department of your grocery store and get the real thing (it doesn't necessarily have to be expensive though - $7-10 is still fine).

I had to use white wine, I used a good chardonay which I had available, let me tell you it was great.  I made this for a baby shower and had people looking for me through out the day to get the receipe.  One guest compared it to a 5 star restaurant she eats at, said mine had more flavor.  Love it.

Great recipe! I add 1 small sliced onion and saute in 3 tbsp butter, then I add 3-4 cloves minced garlic after onions have softened. Then I add the mushrooms and marsala sauce. After it has become softened I add the sundried tomatoes and readd the chicken to help thicken up the mixture. Once it has cooked for appx 5 minutes I add the spinach (appx 5 cups raw) and cook for another 5 minutes. I serve with garlic mashed potatoes!!!!

I was a little skeptical to make this after reading some of the reviews, but I am so glad that I made it anyways.  This is absolutely delicious.  The only change I made was to double the veggies, and therefore I doubled the sauce.  I also decreased the amount  of butter to about 3 tablespoons, because 3/4 cup is scary for something that is not a dessert. This is definite a recipe to make if you want to impress someone.  It is quick, easy and absolutely delicious.  I will definitely be making this again.

This was an excellent idea.  I love the sundried tomatoes and spinach.  For the chicken, I just sliced the breasts very thin and then sauteed them in some olive oil - no butter.  Will definitely make this again!

I love this recipe and make it at least once a month! A few changes...I use 1/2 cup butter,2/3 cup sun-dried tomatoes, 3/4 cup spinach, and garlic. So much better than plain chicken marsala!!

This was so yummy...but I did make some alterations.  The recipe calls for enough butter to clog the arteries of 5 grown men!  1 stick (1/2 cup) was more than enough to saute the mushrooms and make the sauce nice and rich.  I did add a couple cloves of garlic to the dish as well as about a cup of chicken stock to make more sauce without all that butter.  I recommend you pile on the veggies as well.  They are the best part of the dish. Mangia!

This was sooo good! The only thing I did different was use sherry instead of marsala wine because I didn't have any. Also, next time I might use less butter because the recipe calls for so much.
Thanks! It was great.

I was so excited to make this dish - it sounded so wonderful!  I was kinda disappointed.  Too much butter in the sauce...and as much as I adore wine sauces, this one had just too much bite (I used a nice pinot noir) and I added some chicken stock to cut it down.  I'm not sure if I'd make this again.  Alot of work for an only ok dish.

Yum, yum, yum. I'm a huge fan of chicken marsala, but had never thought to add sun-dried tomatoes and spinach. What a great idea! I didn't have fresh spinach, just frozen, so added half a box of chopped frozen spinach...squeezing out all of the excess liquid. I also just had chicken thighs, so I used them (skinless)...no need to pound as they're more tender than chicken breasts. Also had it over garlic mashed potatoes...another first, as I usually have this with pasta. I really loved it. Thanks, Shannon!

This was wonderful. The only changes I made were : adding more spinach, adding garlic and leaving out all the butter. I replaced some of the liquid that would have come from the butter with vegetable stock. Since I added a lot more spinach, next time I think I'll double up the wine and stock for the sauce, I served this over whole wheat couscous

I followed the recipe exactly and all I tasted in the end was pure butter.  I had to throw it away.  I couldn't eat it.  I think this recipe could work but I think the butter needs to be taken down to at least 1/4 cup (I'd actually make it 1/8 but that's my preference).  Add chicken broth and just a little bit of heavy cream for the spinach, tomato, mushroom portion.

This was alright, but the sun dried tomatoes overpowered the dish and adding the butter before deglazing the pan left a greasy rather than blended sauce.  I was hoping for a rich mushroom flavor with bright pops of tomato acid. If I try it again (which I may not), I think I'd cut the tomatoes down to 1/4c or cut them out entirely.  Or, I'd go the opposite route and push the tuscan side  by adding olives and capers. I also (skeptically) followed the recipe's call for melting the butter before deglazing with wine and I think that was  a mistake. A more traditional approach of whisking the butter bit by bit after the marsala has reduced right before removing from the heat should give a more emulsified (less butter grease) end product. As others have said, addd garlic is a must. I've also gotten in the habit of brining my chicken before cooking which keeps it juicy (hubby loved the chicken, sans sauce).  With a few tweaks this might be a keeper, but as it is I will not make it again.

The Marsala was a little overpowering, so I would cut back on it.  I also used less butter--there already was some olive oil in the pan, so that helped.  The flour from the chicken thickened up the sauce, so I might use the liquid from the tomatoes or some broth next time, to lighten up the Marsala. I served it over rigatoni, and it was very good.

This was sooo good and sooo easy! I took your advice and made garlic mashed potatoes with it and served sliced cucumbers with it also. It was amazing! The only thing I changed was to leave out the sun dried tomatoes and I used regular white mushrooms instead of Portobello.

This dish could have been really delicious, but 3/4 cup of sun-dried tomatoes? OMG, it was sooo oily and overwhelming. I think that fresh tomatoes would have been a better choice.  Sorry, it just didn't work for us.

This recipe was so easy and tasty. I made some mod's based on the reviews and adjusted to our taste. Sauted 3 cloves garlic and about 3tbs chopped yellow onion prior to adding the chicken (which I cut into pieces). Added 3/4 cup marsala w/ 1/4 cup sherry with mushrooms & 1/4 cup butter since my tomatoes were in oil. Added back the chicken along with some diced green onion the sundried tomatoes & 2 cups of spinach.  Served over garlic mashed potatoes. Presentation and taste were spot on.  Thanks Shanou.

This was FANTASTIC!  I used the dried tomatoes in the pouch -- no oil.  Also reduced the quantity of them as my husband hates them.  However, I used real Marsala wine from the liquor section & not the bottled in the grocery aisle.  Also, reduced the butter substantially & substituted with chicken broth.  Tasted like a goumet meal for company.  Yum, yum!

This was delicious! I've been making chicken marsala for years, and it's nice to have a new twist on it. 1/2 cup butter was plenty. Used 3/4 cup spinach, and a little less tomatoes. Served over angel hair pasta. Definitely recommend this one for a weeknight dinner, as it was pretty quick and easy to put together.

This is a delicious recipe.  I used less butter and more spinach and mushrooms.  I also grilled the chicken; put it in a casserole dish and then layered the mixture on top of it and layered it again with cheese; put in the oven for about 20 minutes until cheese turns golden.  It was absolutely delicious.  I served it with some french bread which was great for mopping up the juices!  We will make this again and again.

My family loved this, after reading the other reviews I did tweak it a bit, I seared the chicken only for a few minutes on each side then I put it in a after I cooked up the sauce I put it ontop of the chicken then added the spinach (frozen out of a bag) then baked it in a coverd dish for 20 minutes on 375, I also added a garlic clove to the sauce and I used regular mushrooms as well as only 2 table spoons of butter. The dish had beautiful color and great taste, it's a keeper in my family! Thank YOU!!

A really good recipe. I did not have the sun-dried tomatoes on hand so I skipped them. And I used "regular" mushrooms as well since I had them handy. I followed the recommendations from others to cut the butter and wine a bit too :) Finally,, I also followed another recommendation and used a bit of flour & cream to thicken the sauce before adding the spinach. Having said all that - it is an excellent recipe I'll definitely make it again and try some other variations!

We loved this & only made a couple of changes. We used a LOT LESS butter, & a LOT MORE spinach. We also didn't have any Marsala, so used California Madeira instead, & it was great. We served it over potatoes mashed with skin-on, with a little sour cream & green onion. Yummy

This is an excellent recipe!  I added a bit more spinach and a few more mushrooms, as we tend to like lots of veggies.  It came out wonderfully--and it does go well with garlic mashed potatoes.

We loved the combination but I switched it around a little. I bought chicken breast tenders. the fillet of chicken. i cooked it ahead of time. coated chicken in spelt flour and seasoned with pepper, minced garlic and kelp granules. browned them in olive oil & half the butter. removed chicken and used 1/2 cup of sundried tom. with oil, canned portabella mushrooms - 15 oz. for just a few minutes in marsala 1/2 cup it is strong. then i added alot more fresh spinach then suggested and will use even more next time. placed in an oblong glass dish and covered til dinner time and heated at 325 for a 1/2 hour after it sat on counter for 1 hour, enjoy :)

this recipe was alright, way to much butter! besides the butter taste this recipe is good.next time i will use only 1/4 of the amount of butter. i added a little flour to cut some of the strong marsala flavor. i also used half portobellos and half sliced mushrooms so it was not all mushrooms.

I had this for dinner tonight and thought it was ok. I used Marsala cooking wine and found it a little bit vinegar-y. The sundried tomatoes I used were oil packed which I believe made it a little greasy. I had to cook the mixture longer than 10 mins so it could reduce to a consistency I liked. My daughter liked it, so I may prepare again with a few adjustments.

I skipped the frying part and  threw all the ingredients , (added 2 Tbsp chopped garlic & 1 small scallion)together in the crock pot on low for 6 hours. When I came home, I thickened slightly with a cornstarch, milk mixture  and served over al-dente pasta; Incredibly easy and tasty. As an added note, parmesan cheese before serving is wonderful also.

very easy, and I increased the mushrooms, spinach, and sun-dried tomatoes. I used a little less butter and Marsala, and it turned out great.

Loved it! We followed comment suggestions. Regular mushrooms. Less butter, more spinach, and less Marsala. We didn’t have sun dried tomatoes so used fresh. Added garlic as we love it. Sauce lessened during cooking. Will double sauce recipe next time. Maybe add some chicken broth and flour roux mixture to thicken. Put chicken in sauce at end to reheat chicken and mix flavor. Added Parmesan cheese as topper.

This was my first time making Marsala, although I often get veal or chicken Marsala at Italian restaurants.  I was pleasantly surprised how good it was.  I followed the recipe except for  putting the browned chicken pieces in a baking dish, covered the chicken with the sauce, and baked covered for about 25 min. at 300.  This finished cooking the chicken and infused it with the delicious sauce.

i made this with similar ingredients but i also try to keep kosher so i actually made this with no butter and just used olive oil to brown the chicken and bought precut chicken scaloppini and a kosher marsala wine.  It came out perfect. I also cooked the musbrooms in the same pan once the chicken was already cooked.  Doesn't even matter if the ingredients are not measured perfectly, comes out great every time and probably less calories sans butter.  Also if i don't have the tomatoes, no problem, even better as some of my folks not fans of tomato

I made this recipe and followed the directions exactly.It turned out sooo delicious. My family raved over it.  I served it over Linguini noodles mixed with butter, pesto and italian style diced tomatoes. I was going to add some fresh Basil to the pasta, but I forgot. Just the same it complimented the chicken nicely.

As for the Marsala wine, I had to look around a bit for it, but I finally found it for $10  at a supermarket with a larger wine selection. Trader Joes has Marsala but it's a little more there. I have enough Marsala left to make this dish a couple more times... and I will make it. It's quick and easy and really good.

Made exactly as directed. No substitutions. WOW!. Had this for dinner, woke up at 4:00 am thinking and still salivating over this recipe. Trying to beat my husband home from work today so I can have the leftovers all to myself. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

This was great!  I took a reviewer's suggestion and seared the chicken, sautéed the spinach in olive oil, and made the Marsala sauce with the mushrooms and sun-dried tomatoes, then transferred to a baking dish - chicken, then spinach, then mushroom-tomato-Marsala sauce and baked for 40 min at 300 degrees.  I also chopped the mushrooms and thinly sliced the sun-dried tomatoes.  Served over fresh linguine.  Perfect! Will definitely make again.

Ok, I eliminated the flour since I've gone paleo and my friend that was over for dinner is gluten intolerant. Also I replaced sun dried tomatoes with sun dried tomato pesto, and Cabernet for Marsala wine. I also added 2 cloves of garlic to the sauce and used brown rice as a side instead if pasta.

I followed the recipe except for using 1/4 cup butter vs. 3/4, cup, adding another handful of spinach  and adding a clove a garlic.  When it was cooking, I thought that we would not be able to eat it.  However, after tasting it, both my husband and I really liked it.  I served with a side of buttered spaghetti, and it worked beautifully.

Easy, quick and fantastic! I added 2 cloves of chopped garlic and 3/4 cup chicken broth with the marsala. Right before it was done, I added a splash of Trader Joe's fat free half and half, heated it through and it was delicious!

This was fantastic!!   I changed two things.  I used chicken broth instead of wine, and put in canned diced tomatos instead of sundried.  It was delicious!

This recipe is FANTASTIC. My husband and I both loved it, it was a gourmet meal. I'm going to use a little less Marsala next time though, as I felt the flavor overpowered the chicken, mushrooms and tomatoes.
But I am definitely making this again and again!

I decided to make this for dinner before noticing how much butter was in the recipe!  So, I reduced the amount of butter to 1.5 tablespoons for flavor and added about a cup of chicken broth to make the sauce.  Also added about 3 cups of baby spinach after reading other reviews.  Cut the chicken into smaller pieces after pounding and then added them back to the sauce to simmer a couple of minutes to add flavor to the sauce before serving.  Delicious to my taste and very healthy!  Love the combination of marsala, sundried tomatoes, mushrooms and spinach.  Thank you!

Yum! this is really spectacular, and it is beautiful when plated.  I didn't exactly measure much of anything, including the flour and seasonings.  I added more seasonings to the flour/oregano mix, using a McCormick garlic and onion blend just to help the flavor since some reviews stated the chicken itself was bland.  I left out the butter completely; I just added more olive oil if I needed more grease in the pan.  Used canned button mushrooms because that's about all hubs likes, and I'm not a mushroom fan.  Served with rice and it was a lovely, filling meal.  Thanks for the recipe!

My husband made this recipe for dinner while I was at work. When I walked in the house the kitchen smelled wonderful with the scent of wine. (And I'm not a wine lover.) All the ingredients complimented each other. The meal was beautiful to look at and a delight for the palate. It was fabulous! 

Hubby made a couple of changes to the recipe, one due to family dairy sensitivity. He substituted Earth Balance Vegan Buttery Sticks for the butter, and only half the amount stated. He also added about 1/2 cup of chicken broth. 

I'll look forward to having this dish again.

Amazingly easy and amazingly delicious!  I read through a couple reviews before making this dish myself.  So here's what I tweeked:  I used about 2 tsp. of minced garlic when frying the chix, I used the 3/4 cup butter called for in this recipe, but added the left over flour and oregano/S & P mixture to make a roux (maybe a Tsp. of left over flour?). I chopped the mushrooms into bite sized pieces and sliced the sun-dried tomatoes. Then I added the mushrooms and tomatoes to the butter and sauted until the mushrooms looked soft. Only then did I add the Marsala wine (Florio Dry Marsala wine, purchased at our local liquor store). I returned the chix breasts to the liquid, covered and simmered for about 20 minutes more to get the meat nice and tender.  I served it with garlic mashed potatoes and fresh steamed green beans. Everyone LOVED this dish and I can't wait to make it again.

This was delicious!  I served over pasta and the family loved it.  The only modifications I made were that I only used about a 1/4 cup of butter and used half a cup of marsala and it turned out great.

The flavors in this were great! I changed it up a bit and used all the ingredients in a pasta dish.  Instead of using chicken breasts I used frozen chicken tenders and cut them up into pieces and added them to the sauce at the end.  I also added onions, garlic and chicken stock to make it a little more saucy. I also added more spinach and tossed all the ingredients with whole wheat pasta...will make again!

Whole family LOVED this...  Lightly dust with flour or it will get sloppy.  Added garlic and green onions and 3-4 cups of spinach at the very end so it looks fresh.  Really, other than sun-dried tomatoes, doubled + almost everything except butter.  Served this over wheat spaghetti and a bit of extra spinach for more color.  Everyone wanted seconds.  Delicious- Thank you for a great base recipe.  This will be made many more times!

Very quick, fresh and flavorful dish. I did opt out the butter and used only a small amount of the oil still remaining on the pan from frying the chicken. I cut the chicken breasts into quarters and place them in a deep dish. I used more sundried tomatoes, mushrooms, and spinach than the recipe calls for. Once the sauce was done, I put on top of the chicken, this made it easier for people to pick out how much of the veggies and sauce they wanted with their dish. Everyone at my dinner party raved about it!

This is pretty good. I cut down on the amounts of almost everything as I only cooked 1 chicken halfed. I also added some garlic and 1/2 cup chicken stock. Thickend the sauce with a bit of cornstarch.

It was good, but the sun dried tomatoes canceled out the Marsala wine. Sun dried tomatoes have a very powerful flavor. Chicken broth could be used in place of the Marsala and it would taste the same. Next time I will save my money and use chicken broth instead.

This was fabulous exactly as the recipe reads. I doubled it and used an extra large fry pan.  It turned out fantastic. This will go into my special "keeper box". Has to be one of my all time favorite allrecipes.com finds. I served with garlic mashed potatoes and Parmesan asparagus along with Petite Syrah, which was perfect. I plan to try over fettuccine next time.

Delicious with a couple modifications. I felt the butter was way too much. Only used 2 tablespoons. I also sauteed the mushrooms with a couple sliced garlic cloves before adding wine. I cut back on the sun-dried tomatoes to about 1/3 cup sliced and upped the spinach to about 2 cups. We loved it!!

This is a wonderful recipe but I did alter it a bit.  I added some sauteed onions and garlic to the mushroom mixture as well as about 1t. of crushed red pepper.  I found the marsala wine made the sauce a bit too sweet so I added a few splashes of balsamic vinegar and red wine vinegar to give it some edge.  I served it with angel hair pasta and everyone loved it!

Tasted great..I did change it. I boiled half a box of whole wheat penne, cooked it, drained, and drizzled olive oil and parmesean cheese. I used this as a serving base to the dish, with the chicken and sauce poured on top. Excellent. Also..I placed the chicken back into the sauce mixture and cooked it all together for 5 minutes at the end. This made the chicken taste fabulous. I used frozen chicken tenderloin strips and did not defrost or pound them. Just coated in flour and proceeded as usual with the recipe. I used half the butter and it still turned out great.

This was very good.  I thought the Marsala taste was kind of weak, but it might have just been the brand I was using.  I added red pepper flakes and a lot of garlic.  I also added onions and used more spinach than the recipe called for.  I love how healthy this recipe is.

This was SOOOOOO good! We used 3/4 cup Marsala and 1/4 cup sherry. Also used more sun dried tomatoes, baby bellas, and 1/2 bag of spinach. Will probably saute some diced onions with this the next time. Served over garlic mashed potatoes. Even yummier the next day for leftovers since the sauce soaked into the potatoes.

This was a very delicious dish, but I used this recipe more as a guideline. Like others, I also used less butter, about 3-4 tablespoons. I used more spinach than called for and I added a yellow bell pepper I needed to use up, which added some more color. I cooked the vegetables in a separate pan from the chicken so everything would be ready at the same time, and I think this helped to avoid the brown color others complained about. I also added some wine (I didn't have Marsala, so I just used a white cooking wine with lemon flavor) to the chicken and used a homemade garlic olive oil. This was a huge hit and I would definitely make it again.

Tastes exactly like something I would get at a restaurant and I am by no means an expert chef. This recipe is a keeper. I followed the suggestions of some of the reviews and used 1/2 marsala wine and 1/2 chicken stock. I also added some onions and garlic cloves. Had over angel hair pasta. Yummy!

Really good.  To save time, I butterflied the chicken breasts instead of pounding them.  Instead of 3/4 c butter I used two tablespoons with two tablespoons olive oil to saute the mushrooms, sundried tomatoes, and spinach. I sauteed a couple of chopped garlic cloves in the butter/oil before I added the rest of the ingredients.  I thought that 1 cup of marsala wine would have been overwhelming so I used 1/2 cup with 1/2 cup chicken broth.  We really enjoyed this!  I served over spaghetti aglia olio.

Excellent twist on an old favorite!! I made this as the recipe was written and it was great! I will try again. I served this with angel hair pasta that I cooked with the remainder of the sun dried tomato, poured in some olive oil tossed with garlic for a complete meal!!! Thx

This was an easy, absolutely delicious recipe - I was looking for a veal recipe but I found this and substituted veal for the chicken.  Served it with whole wheat pasta and asparagus.  Will definitely make it again - pretty and tasty enough for company.

I chopped the chicken into pieces before cooking, left out the spinach, used 3/4 marsala, and 1 cup of chicken broth, only used 1 tbsp of butter. I added flour/water mixture until it thickened and added pine nuts at end. It was a nice pasta dish.

I just tried this recipe last night and it was simply scrumptious. Based on other reviews, I doubled the amount of spinach and portabella. Since some reviews mentioned the recipe was a lil on the bland side, I added a dash of paprika and extra oregano and black pepper, served over a bed of white rice and it was simply delish!

If this is the first time you are using sun-dried tomatoes I would suggest either thoroughly washing the oil off of the tomatoes or using unprocessed sun-dried tomatoes.  This dish was way too oily for consumption.  I also substituted the 1 cup marsala with 1/4 cup marsala, 1/4 pinot grigio and 1/2 cup of chicken broth.  If I try this recipe again, I might even substitute chopped romas for the sun-dried.

The sundried tomatos I used were overwhelming, masking even 2 cups of spinach I used.  I would make it again with 1/2 the sd tomatos.  I used boneless pork chops instead of chicken.  They were tasty solo.

I just prepared this recipe last night and honestly I should have read more of the reviews. I felt like the marsala wine was just way to overpowering i added heavy cream to mute it but no luck.

I love making this recipe.  I have made it several times and have taken the advice of several reviews on here.  I lowered the butter to 1/2 cup.  I also thin the chicken breasts and season them with the salt, pepper and oregano and put them in the fridge the morning I am planning on cooking them.  One other variation I have made on this excellent recipe, sometimes I use half marsala and half cooking sherry.  Adds a slightly different twist to things.

Delicious with the suggested modifications: 1/2 cup Marsala, more spinach and mushrooms. It was so good, I was surprised I actually made it. Good job!

Fantastic! Thanks so much for this recipe! Very flavorful. Made this for a "best dish" competition with some friends and they were blown away, needless to say, this dish won. Boyfriend likes this one a lot, too. Very easy, makes the kitchen smell wonderful. Thanks for making me look like a domestic goddess!

Wow!  This is rich!!  An excellent idea, but I have to admit that I had to make a lot of changes as I was preparing this on the fly and didn't have a couple of the ingredients readily at hand.  You've inspired me, though -- thanks for sharing!!

I made this last night and it was great.  I only used 1/2 cup of marsala wine and 1/2 cup of chicken broth.  I was afraid the taste would be too strong.  It worked out well.

This is THE BEST chicken marsala I have ever had, including at restaurants!  I made it this past weekend for my husband for our anniversary.  I used a  sweet marsala (which I loved, though it might be too sweet for some tastes) and halved the recipe. I substituted crimini mushrooms for the portobellos and reduced the number of sun-dried tomatoes (my husband doesn't care for them).  We were also out of fresh spinach so I used organic baby lettuce leaves instead, which looked just like spinach when they cooked up.  The end result was a delicious, colorful dish which looked super-fancy when I served it up next to garlic mashed potatoes, an organic green salad and toasted onion-basil foccacia bread.  This is a recipe I will save and make over and over.  Thanks Shannon, for the excellent recipe!

This is a fabulous recipe.  It's quick and easy and tastes great.  I will definitely make this one again!  Yes, the sauce is rich, but it is marsala.  This was by far the easiest "gourmet style" recipe I have ever prepared!  Try it, you'll love it.

First the positives: Fairly easy to prepare, chicken was moist and tender; beautiful to look at (great for a Christmas dinner with the red and green colors). Negatives: I added more marsala because I couldn't taste it; the addition of the sun dried tomatoes made the sauce sweet and it just didn't taste like a regular chicken marsala. That said, we still liked it but if you are looking for that familar chicken marsala taste, you may be disappointed. I think I would probably make this again and serve it to company because it is different. I just used regular sliced button mushrooms and served with garlic mashed potatoes. I thought the flavors went well with Campus Oaks Zinfindel but my husband thought the wine overpowered the meal. I thought it was perfect.

I'm on a diet, so I omitted the butter completely, and I also didn't have any sun dried tomatoes available.  I cut the recipe in half for my husband and myself, and he really liked it.  It still turned out great!  Its staying on our menu!

First meal I made from this website and first meal I made for my new boyfriend-who is an excellent cook.  And he Loved it!  I used a lot more spinach than suggested and will use even more next time.  I will also try cutting back on the butter and adding flour also since I had to 'reduce' this by boiling some of the sauce to make it thicker.  Excellent meal overall and a Beautiful presentation!  Look forward to more recipes from this site!

This is a fabulous dish. My family loved it and want it to join the "regular rotation". It is also very visually appealing with the red and green veggies. Preparation was pretty easy.  I made it on a busy weeknight.  Next time will try a litte more spinach.

While I can see why other people love this, I don't think I'll repeat it. It just wasn't as fabulous as I'd hoped, but okay. I might try doubling the sauce to serve as a side, maybe with white wine instead...

My family really enjoyed this recipe, especially my daughter and her husband.  The only thing I changed was using olive oil cooking spray in place of the olive oil.  I would also add more spinach....it definitely is a keeper..I can't wait to make for our friends this summer at our lake vacation.

Wow! So easy to prepare, such a great result. Delicious, and so tasty. I did the way it says in the recipe, but I used a little bit  of fresh garlic for the tangy taste. It was just perfect, the marsala sauce with mushrooms was incredible.
A perfect meal for a weeknight or for a friends dinner!

Made this last night...it was very easy, very quick and very beautiful. However the Marsala flavor was quite strong, I would probably make some changes if I make it again.  I thought the garlic mashed potatoes overpowered the flavor of this dish and would probably try serving it over spinach like a previous reviewer.  Also the sauce was too thin, I would thicken it up a bit.

This has a delicious combination of flavors.  My changes: 1) added garlic when sauteing the chicken, 2) added 1 sm diced onion to the mushrooms, 3) used white mushrooms, 4) cut way back on the sun-dried tomatoes and added fresh tomatoes, 5) reduced the butter a bit and balanced it with the marsala for taste.  A definite keeper!

We really liked this recipe!  The only thing I would change however is the sundried tomatoes...Next time I think I'll leave them out, they made the dish a bit oily and thier 'vinagary' flavour over powered the dish a little...
Otherwise, it was great!

Great recipe! I did follow other reviews and removed the chicken from the pan once it was cooked. I sautéed the veggies and made the sauce while the pasta cooked and did save some pasta water to add to the sauce. For those wondering about the sun dried tomatoes they really added a lot to the dish. I topped it with some fresh parmesan cheese. I will absolutely make this again! 

I will absolutely make this again!

Made exactly as written (except used home canned Chantrelle mushrooms because that's what I had) and served over penne. Delicious and quite easy!  I'll definitely make this again.

Overall it wasn’t a bad dish. I do think there was a little too much butter in the recipe. Next time I might change it. I added a little more spinach and mushrooms than what the recipe recommends. My husband loved it and my kids ate it, basically a win for dinner. A must try if you’re looking for something different for dinner.

Very delicious and flavorful!  I added 1 scallion and used chicken breast tenders instead if chicken breast filets.  My only suggestion is to simmer the chicken a little longer to have the chicken consume more of the marsala flavor..

This is a great simple recipe that tastes delicious. I followed some of the reviews and tweaked the recipe a little by adding a little chicken broth and some cream. I have made this recipe several times over the past few weeks. I have paired it with garlic mash potatoes and at times angel hair pasta. It is a real keeper and I have shared it with other family members

Great recipe, made it for my wife for her birthday today and got rave reviews.

Used sliced baby bellas, 2 pkgs, and 2 pkgs of sun-dried tomatoes, a bit more than a cup, plus some extra spinach. Left the marsala wine and butter the same.

Found the tomatoes became sweeter the longer you cook them, went about 20 minutes for that and reduction of the mushrooms, so to keep the meal from drying out in the  pan I added just about 1/2 cup chicken broth. Also added the chicken back as soon as the spinach reduced by half.

All in all, a fantastic meal and a new addition to my go-to list for any occasion.

I added the potatoes to the sauce after I cooked them. My chicken didn’t stay breaded very well but I used chicken tenderloins instead. It was pretty good.

Made the dish pretty much to the recipe, but tweaked alittle to my taste. In the flour dredge, i added alittle paprika for alittle kick, doubled the spinach, and added 1/2 cup cream for a thicker  sauce. I also added the chicken to the sauce to cook for 5 minutes at the end. So very very good!!

This recipe is very good. I served it over spaghetti. I also reduced the recipe for 2 people and prepared the recipe as is with a slight change in the procedure of adding wine. With those modifications mentioned here is how I prepared this recipe: First, with a pairing knife, I sliced horizontally slice each breast to make 4 pieces. I thinned out each piece with the kitchen hammer just a bit as the pre slicing gets half the hammering job done. Second, I proceeded to make the recipe as if for 2 people, so I kept the proportions for a 2 people recipe. Third, after frying the breasts, I added half the amount of wine (4 TBSP) and proceeded to scrape the bits from the pan and let the wine evaporate a bit. Then, added the mushrooms and tomatoes. In this step, I added 1/4 cup of butter (4 TBSP) and as soon as it started melting, I added the remaining amount of wine.  I also added the chicken juices and proceeded to put the chicken on top and covered for barely 3 minutes. Last, I added the spinach and covered again until the vapor wilted the spinach a bit, without letting it get dull in color while the juices thickened a bit. With those "changes" which mainly are techniques applied to the basic recipe, I made it.  Honestly, this was delicious and still yielded leftovers. I could imagine this over a classic risotto Parmesan, and it would just be great too!

The only changes I made was recommended by others:
- 1/2 C butter and added additional olive oil for sauce.  
- Added 1T chopped garlic and salt to taste.  
- Used lots of mushrooms (28 oz.)

The family really loved it.  Will make again

This was absolutely DELICIOUS! I did not change the recipe at all except I wilted more spinach. I served the chicken and spinach on top of a bed of mashed sweet potatoes. The sweet potatoes complemented the spinach, chicken, and sun dried tomatoes perfectly. I will definitely make this again!

Love this recipe and my husband is still talking about it. I made a couple of changes. I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs only because we like them better.  I also added a little garlic, again because we like garlic.  Served over angel hair pasta.  Will definitely make this again!  Yum!

This is a nice change from regular Chicken Marsala recipe that I have. I didn't have the portobello mushrooms so had to use regular. Portobello would give it a little more flavor cause they have a nutty flavor. Will make again because it is really very easy & not time consuming. I did use the sun-dried tomatoes & will unless I run out & then would try using the grape tomatoes, but don't think they'd be as tasty.

Very tasty! Loved the flavour! More Marsala so there is more juice for the spaghetti.

This dish was easy & quick to prepare but oh so delicious! I will definitely remember this one for company—it tastes so yummy but is also so pretty with the colors of the sun dried tomatoes k spinach.  I followed the recipe exactly & added garlic

I upped the spinach a bit since it reduces so much. A little more Marsala for the pan and the chef  doesn't go astray ;-) Would maybe add a little lemon zest and a touch of garlic next time.

After reading the other reviews I just seasoned the chicken with oregano, added a bit of chicken stock because I like more sauce & added garlic while the mushrooms were cooking. So so good!! I will probably add more veggies next time.

I made a quadruple batch of this for a large crowd. I used boneless chicken tenders to make portioning easier. I also used julienned sundried tomatoes in oil with spices, which added flavor, and more mushrooms and spinach proportionally. I used about 20% less marsala wine proportionally also, and it still had the marsala flavor. I made it about 3 hours before everyone came, and it held beautifully. The chicken stayed moist and all the flavors really melded together well. I froze some leftovers and it was just as good when defrosted. This is a keeper for me.

This is a good recipe, but our family all agreed it had too much sun dried tomato. I love sun dried tomatoes, but  I will decrease the amount  to 1/4-1/2 cup next time as sun dried tomatoes have such a strong, tangy flavor and it overwhelmed this dish. I also added minced garlic and more spinach. Otherwise enjoyed this dish.

Made this recipe 3 times and it is a favorite. We love the mushrooms, so I add more. Used more sundried tomatoes to use up the jar, but next time will stick to the recipe. Make a day ahead--better when it sits in the fridge for 23-48 hours. I reheat slowly in the oven.

Absolutely amazing!! There was a moment of uncertainty regarding the sauce, I wasn't sure if it was suppose to cook down or remain liquid - but everything turned out perfectly!! It was a big hit. I didn't have Marsala wine so I used Zinfedale instead. Made roasted red potatoes instead of spaghetti.

I made this for the first time for company, which is always risky trying new recipes with company, but it turned out fantastic.  Absolutely delicious.  The only problem was my guests went home in distress because they couldn't stop eating it!  I dislike it when people write reviews on a recipe and then mention they changed the recipe a bit.  Well, I'm going to be one of those people.  I only made two slight changes that I don't think made a big difference in the final results.  I added 6 THIN slices of proscuitto (cut up) when sauteing the mushrooms, and I thickened the sauce with a little cornstarch and water.  Definitely restaurant quality.  P.S. I used sweet Marsala, not dry.

This dish is far, far less greasy if you omit most of the butter indicated to cook the tomatoes and mushrooms in as I did the second time I made it. 'Dry' (Communion Style) Masala wine is more pleasing then replacing it with dry Vermouth. The 'dry' fortified Masala imparts just the right amount of sweetness IMHO.

I really loved this recipe.  The chicken turned out great and the spinach and mushrooms were awesome together.  This is not your typical Chicken Marsala recipe, but a keeper none the less.

This dish turned out fantastic.  I substituted cherry tomatoes for the sun dried tomatoes and served over a bed of fettuccine pasta.  I stuck to the recipe as given and I wouldn't make any changes.  Very easy to make in a very short time.  This is definitely a keeper.

We love Chicken Marsala so I gave this a try. I wasn't sure if the sundried tomatoes were packed in oil or just dehydrated, so I used some of each. I used 2 pounds of chicken tenders in place of the chicken breast and only 1 Tbsp butter. Increased Marsala to 1-1/2 cups and used 1 pound spinach. This made enough for 8 people. Could have used some garlic, but other wise very good. My family really enjoyed it. Reheats well in microwave.
Based on the reviews, and my love of Classic Chicken

This was an amazing recipe. One of the best I've ever obtained from Allrecipes. One thing of note, I was working with one extremely large chicken breast and when pounded to 1/4" it broke in several places, but the main breast and the remnants filled a very large skillet. So, I still made the full amount of sauce. It was the perfect amount for two. Like others, I seasoned the breasts, reduced the butter (~3/4 stick), Marsala (2/3 cup), added some fresh garlic, and increased the spinach (1/2 of a fresh bunch, de-stemmed). This was phenomenal with mashed potatoes. What a winner!!!!!!

This was an easy recipe, and very tasty. I braised my chicken with a splash of Marsala for added flavor, as well as adding  onion and garlic. My family really enjoyed this and have requested I make it again.

I like to follow recipes to the letter but I could only get sundried tomatoes in jars with oil. I used the oil from two 210ml jars instead of the oil and butter in recipe. Also I picked up frozen spinach not thinking so I used it. The rest of the recipe I followed. I served it on a bed of corn, rice quinoa noodles. It was a very tasty meal, easy to prepare.

This was wonderful!!  I made as written with the only change mixing 1/2 marsala and 1/2 white wine as I find the flavor of marsala a little strong for me.  I thought it was really good and will absolutely make it again.

Doubled the recipe because my wife and I like having leftovers on standby.  More than doubled the recommended amt of fresh spinach and was glad I did.  The marsala wine I used was not the most flavorful, but this isn't a traditional chicken marsala dish anyway.   Used a combo of portobello and crimini shrooms and a full jar of sundried tomatoes in oil, leaving some of the oil left in the jar.  Like others, I did not use as much butter.   However I did add a splash of heavy cream to the pan near the end to thicken the mix.  The only other addition was a teaspoon of crushed red peppers  when putting the mushrooms and sundried tomatoes in the pan.  Placed over my favorite gluten free pasta.  Loved the result!  Not difficult at all.  Highly recommend.

This is a relatively simple recipe, good for a weeknight.
Several minor suggestions:
- use 1/3 of the butter,
- minimize pounding the breasts by slicing them horizontally once each, then minimal pounding,
- as others have mentioned, use 4 times the spinach and mushrooms,
- lastly, feel free to try using a dry white wine or a dry white wine with a  tablespoon of brandy. Enjoy....

This is a great recipe. I did add a splay of cream as another suggested. I often order shrimp Florentine at a local Italian restaurant and I added add’l items like I’ve had; slivered garlic, 1/4 cup fresh chopped basil and topped it with Parmesan cheese. I also reduced butter to only 1/4 C and used sun dried tomatoes in oil.

This was a great recipe. Yes, I did make some adjustments to suit my liking. I used boneless skinless thighs instead of breast. I only browned the chicken on both sides and then took it out of the pan. I then sauteed the mushrooms to have them cook down a bit before putting in the Marsala wine and the sun-dried tomatoes. I then put the chicken back in the pan to allow it to cook all the way through. I cut down on the butter to 1/2 cup and will probably use less next time as well. I also used the whole 3 cup back of baby spinach instead of 1/2 cup for more veggies. It was great the way I made it and I'm sure the original way too.

It was my turn to cook so I tried this excellent recipe that was easy to make.  Because I have a dairy allergy, I had to remove the butter and make some adjustments.  Olive oil is an obvious substitute, but also added in sundried tomato pesto (contains very little dairy) and minced garlic (1 tbsp.) to the sauce to replace the lost butter flavor.  With the meal, capers were provided for individual taste preferences.  My wife loves dairy, but absolutely LOVED this dinner without the butter.  Definitely a keeper.

Delicious!  The only thing I changed was to reduce the butter to 1/2 cup, and there still seemed to be plenty.  Oh, and I also doubled the amount of spinach.

Chicken Marsala is one of my favorite foods and I love this recipe. I have celiac disease, so I made it gluten and dairy free by using corn spaghetti, rice flour, and vegan butter/margarine.  I had 3 chicken breasts, so I ended up with 6 good sized servings. I had to buy an entire bunch of spinach and it cooks down to almost nothing, so I chopped the entire bunch and cooked it down separately with olive oil, another 1/2 cup marsala, salt and pepper, and it was just the right amount when combined with the rest of the dish.

Loved the extra flavor of the sundried tomatoes.
I added some scallions for enhanced flavor and presentation.
I just warmed up for lunch and it seems even better!

Delcious chicken dish we loved it.  Followed the recipe, the only change I  would make next time is adding more  Marsala wine to make more sauce. 
The sin-dried tomatoes added a very nice flavour, served it with mashed potatoes.
Will make again for sure...

The flavors were good but my hubby is not a fan of Angel Hair Pasta.  Next I will make this with penne which is more to his liking.   I used the oil from the sundried tomatoes which had a great flavor and mixed it with the EVOO so the spices in the tomatoes wouldn't burn.  Loved the addition of the fresh spinach.  It helped me think this was a "good for me" dinner.  Come on, spinach makes anything good for us.

I gave it 4 stars because it was super easy to make and my family enjoyed it. The flavor was good but I probably would not make it again as I thought it was too sweet. I used a dry Marsala.

Delicious! I'm too lazy to flour the chicken, so I just throw it in the pan and thicken the sauce with corn starch later. I didn't have sun dried tomatoes, so I just put in regular tomatoes with a couple scoops of minced garlic for the last few minutes of the marsala simmer, then threw in handfuls of frozen spinach. Sooooo good!

This was fast and delicious. The only change I made was put of necessity - I had less Marsala in the pantry than I'd thought, so mine wound up being about half Marsala and half Sauvignon Blanc.

I Absolutely  Love this Recipe!! I have made it so many times that I've lost count.
It may sound like a lot of oregano, trust me, follow the recipe, lots of flavor. Another way to thin the chicken if you don't want to pound it, take a sharp knife and cut them in half the long way.
I made a couple of additions to it. You can cut back on the butter and use some EVOO with it as well. I love Garlic, so I saute it in the pan after I take out the chicken. Like some of the other readers, I add extra Spinach, mushrooms and sun dried tomatoes.  I also add chicken broth with the Marsala, only because I find the Marsala is a bit potent on its own. And that way I end up with more sauce.                                 Make extra, the leftovers taste even better!
Thank you for the Recipe Shanou!!

This is my new go to recipe for Chicken Marsala!!  Very easy and love the combination of spinach and sundried tomatoes.  I add way more spinach to the recipe since it cooks down so much and we like the extra veggies.  It's such a hit, I have already shared the recipe many times!  Great flavors!!!

This was really good and simple.  I used 3 TBSP. of butter and way more spinach.  I also added 1/4 cup of chicken broth with the Marsala.  I thickened the sauce at the end too.

Very tasty dish, but I will slash the amount of butter next time.  Beautiful presentation.

Very tasty and hubbs loved it too! I did make a few changes after reading some of the other reviews.  I added minced garlic and thickened the sauce a bit before serving over linguine pasta.  Recipe is definitely a keeper!  Thank you.

Easy and great tasting recipe. It also is a very nice looking meal....really colorful with the green and red. The only negative thing (and it may just be a matter of personal taste) was the sun dried tomatoes.  My husband and I didn't really care for them. I would still use them next time for added flavor and appearance (may just pick them out). I did put more spinach in than what it called for and when I make this again I will put even more in.   Great recipe!!

This was exceptional!  My family absolutely loved it.  The only change that was made was I used chicken tenders instead of chicken breasts, that was what I had. Everything else was the same. This is my new go to Marsala recipe. Thank you for sharing!

I'm giving it a 3 star because without adding more sundried tomatoes and mushrooms this dish lacks a lot of flavor. In addition to that I added in two cloves of minced garlic, 1/4 of sliced sweet yellow onion, and of course more spinach about 2 cups. With these additions it's yummy and my husband and I ate it all with no problems! After cooking the chicken I cut it up in bits and left in foil to keep warm but added it back to sauce once the spinach was wilted and served it with pasta. I used just a tad of butter since my sundried tomatoes are in oil. Next time I might add some chicken broth to make more sauce.

Restaurant worthy.  So good and gourmet presentation. I did cut the butter back by about a third as others suggested just for the sake of calories.

This was delicious!  I stuck pretty close to the original recipe.Here's what I changed: I reduced the butter to 1/2 cup and sprinkled a little garlic powder on the sauce when I added the wine, etc. . I also used baby portobello mushrooms instead of the big ones.  This is definitely a "keeper."

I really liked this recipe. The only change I made was to reduce the amount of butter to only 1 tablespoon (instead of 1-1/2 sticks!) and was very pleased with the results. Delicious.

Recipe was perfect for two chicken breasts and a lot of sauce for pasta. Added some of the flour mixture to the sauce to thicken it a bit. Would probably lessen the sun dried tomatoes or used sliced ones. Tasted perfect!

I substituted butter with olive oil - used 2 Tb olive oil for 3/4 c of butter.  Also I increased the spinach significantly since it wilts easily.

Otherwise great recipe!!!!!

Followed the recipe except for the mushrooms and it was still really good. ( I have never liked mushrooms) I paired it with a basil pasta and it was delish! Simple and easy to make.

The sundried tomatoes and spinach make it so much enter than a typical marsala. Everyone here loved it. 

I had to improvise on the marsala wine. I used white and red mixed. I used about 50% more than the recipe called for and reduced it more. Came out great.

This is one of my favorite recipes.  I add more mushrooms and a ton of spinach because the 1 cup called for steams down to not much.  That way it ends up being main dish and side all in one!

This was amazing!  I used boneless chicken breasts, which made it was a little on the oily side, so next time I'll reduce the olive oil, but that's the only change I would make.  The flavor is fantastic!!

Great flavors in this dish. The only problem I had was that it ended up being a little greasy. I used sun dried tomatoes that were packed in oil, so I cut the butter back to 1/2 cup (1 stick), and drained the sun-dried tomatoes before adding them, and it was still a bit too greasy - delicious, but greasy. Next time I will cut the butter back a bit more, maybe to 5 tablespoons. We served this over angel hair pasta. Will make this again.

This recipe was GREAT! I modified it to reduce the calories and cholesterol and my family loved it! I cut the butter to 1/4 which was plenty to give the dish great flavor and mouth feel. I used 4 cups of sliced portobellos and a 6 oz bag of spinach. Remember to season the veggies after reducing the Marsala wine mix. I served it over fettuccine for the rest of my family. Will definitely be making it again. It would be a good recipe for company as it could be made in advance, combined, and then reheated in the oven.

This was absolutely delicious.. I did a gluten dairy free version. I used dry Marsala wine by Florio and Earth Balance butter and Garbanzo & Fava flour. Restaurant quality.. Can't wait to make it for a dinner party..

Even though I had no mushrooms or marsala I used this recipe as a general guide.  I sauteed onions with the sun dried tomatoes and added some sherry.  We all loved it and I will come back to this recipe and do it right.  Very flexible.

Awesome - loved by all - even the 8yr old daughter.  Easy to manipulate: had no sun dried toms so we didn't use.  Used an open Cabernet instead of Marsala.  Just guessed at amounts. No need to serve over pasta or rice - just as is is great!  DELIC!

I did not think I was going to like this at all.  The sun-dried tomatoes (I used them in oil) didn't seem to go with the marsala or the spinach.  Wow, was I wrong.  I always follow recipes exactly, but since I was missing an ingredient for another recipe, I searched my go-to site and found this.

I used chicken tenderloins, didn't pound them much and had to cook them quite a long time to make sure they were cooked through.  After that, I transferred them to a serving dish and cooked the few mushrooms I had, added the marsala and drained slightly the sun-dried tomatoes and added them to the saute pan.  Because I was using tomatoes in oil, I only used about 4 T of butter which was a good thing.  After cooking the sauce for 8 minutes, I put the chicken in the pan to heat through and transferred this to a serving dish.  Then I sauteed the spinach for a few minutes.  We added this to the dish at the table.  My very picky son loved it and I loved it even more.  I am going to make this for company it is so good.  What a find!

Very tasty. I think sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil would have been better than the vac-pack ones I bought (cheaper). They seemed a bit dry and tough, although I did keep them in the simmering Marsala wine for the required ten minutes. Sautéing the mushrooms in the same pan with some of the chicken bits stuck to the bottom was so delicious, and they cooked like three times as fast.
I think next time in order to really bring out all the flavors, I will add the pasta and chicken to the vegetables and wine three minutes before serving. The pasta seemed a bit bland to me. Also, I think I'll add 1 and 1/2 C Marsala. We can't get enough of it!
Great recipe---thanks.

Followed the recipe-did not make any changes. The marsala was overpowering.

Family loved it! I added some minced garlic while sautéing, added some cream to it too, and simmered the chicken in with the other ingredients. I make chicken marsala often, and one of my sons is not a fan, but he actually cleaned his plate tonight with this version! Will definitely be repeating this!

LOVED IT. I did not use the Holland House brand Marsala though. I used a quality brand and I also added sherry and capers. So Marsala it wasn't but whatever you want to call it doesn't matter. Yum. The second time I made it I didn't have roasted peppers and I truly believe that step is significant. So with just a little tweaking this is a fantastic meal.

Really good recipe. I added garlic as suggested in some of the other reviews. The flavor was exactly what I was expecting!  My dinner guests enjoyed this one. I will definitely be making it again.

Very good, but only gave 4 stars because I did add quite a few things per other reviewer recs. Did only 2 tsp oregano, cut back butter to a little less than 1/2 C (had about 1 Tb butter left from the stick), did use the whole 1 Cup wine as called for (tried cutting back and it wasn't as flavorful), added 1/2-3/4 C chicken stock, 1 tsp garlic minced, and let the chicken simmer with the mixture. Added half and half at the end, about 1/3 Cup, when I added the spinach. 
Served with penne pasta and topped with freshly grated Parm cheese. Husband loved it!

This is one of the best that I have tried. I cut the recipe to three servings, but only used two chicken breasts (dinner for two), and it turned out perfect. Other than that I wouldn't change a thing. Served with steamed veggies and garlic mashed potatos. I will make this again, and often. Thanks Shannon, this was great!!

This is a wonderful and simple dish that I now make quite often.  My husband isn't really even a fan of spinach but requests this dish frequently.  I typically serve this dish with a side of buttered noodles.  Very tasty.  Highly recommended!

This recipe was okay, but I won't be making it again. I may have used the wrong kind of wine, which probably didn't help, but the flavor of the sauce was heavier than I like. My husband ate it, but my daughter and I picked at it. Sorry :(

I thought this tasted fine but my family wasn't happy with the appearance.  It wasn't "gorgeous" as described.  My husband recently returned from Italy with a great bottle of Marsala wine, which made the flavor of the dish wonderful.  However, my family doesn't want to see this on the dinner menu again.

I just made this for my family last night.  They loved the chicken but were mild about the sauce.  I don't believe this was the recipes fault.  It's a very good chicken marsala florentine. My husband dislikes cooked spinach, my children dislike sundried tomatoes.  I foud the sauce a bit to sweet.  Between the marsala and the sundried tomatoes the sauce was  very sweet.  Next time I would try to cut the sweetness by adding capers.

This was absolutely excellent, I made a little more sauce (adding a bit more wine, butter & flour) and another 1/2 cup of fresh spinach.  It was spectacular w/gar. mash, perfect combo.

This was a simple and tastey recipe.  I felt like we were eating gourmet tonight.  My husband complimented me on the flavorful dish.  I will definitely make this recipe again.  (I cut the butter to a half cup also).
