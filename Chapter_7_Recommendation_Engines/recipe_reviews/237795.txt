I use one sheet of aluminum foil and roll up the edges to just contain the steaks, rather than making four separate pans.  This also works with just using a salmon fillet.  Directions should say....Melt butter in a saucepan; stir in onion, Worcestershire sauce, and paprika into the melted butter and saute until onions are tansluscent.

I just used one sheet of tin foil, turned out great! The middle pieces of salmon did seem a bit dry though. Very good recipe!
