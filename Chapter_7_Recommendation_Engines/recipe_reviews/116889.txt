Wow! This was great! I was so surprised when I first bit into it, because I thought it would taste like a typical mexican dish. But somehow this combination of flavors ends up tasting much more complex, almost gourmet.  I think it's one of the best things I've ever made.  

I did make a few substitutions, due to lack of ingredients on hand, but I don't think these substitutions  drastically changed the basic flavors.  I used a couple of Costco whole wheat rollups instead of the pizza crust, which I brushed with olive oil.  I used Chipotle Tobasco for the hot sauce.  And I used parmeggiano reggiano instead of monterey jack. I added a little leftover rotisserie chicken for my meat-loving husband.  Also, FYI, I used good quality Vermont sharp white cheddar cheese. 

I used the food processor to pulse the black bean mixture, added the onion to that and about half the salsa to smooth it into a paste.  Again, I know these were changes to the original recipe, but I just thought the food processor was easier than the mashing and chopping by hand.

Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.

I put the beans, onion, spinach, spices, cilantro and hot sauce into my food processor and made a chunky paste to spread on the crust and then topped with the salsa and cheese.  It was a GREAT success.  Thanks for the idea!

this pizza was fantastic!  we loved it!   we did make a few changes but only due to what we had in our kitchen... instead of the salsa, we used diced tomatoes; instead of onion, we used green onion; and instead of frozen spinach, we used fresh spinach.  we also used fresh mushrooms and sauteed the mushroom, spinach and garlic before putting it on the pizza.  the taste was really really great and i know that we will make this again!  thanks for the recipe!

This is a very different pizza! I used a thin crust premade pizza crust. I changed it up a bit by cooking onion and extra garlic in a skillet before adding it to the black beans. Definately do not skip the chili powder and cumin. I cooked a couple of hot Italian sausages and put small slices of it on the pizza over the beans (sorry to the vegetarians). Because we don't like the all the sodium in salsas I left that out but kind of made my own from fresh tomatoes, onion, garlic, and cilantro and added seasoning to that as well (same as the beans). So I put my "salsa" on top of the beans and sausage libarally and then topped w/ 1/2 cup of 2% chedder blend Kraft crumbles (w/ all the other flavors going on, you don't want to cover it all up w/ cheese). Then I added some sliced garlic on top. This was so good and so pretty! Sorry I left out the spinach, but it had a lot going on already! Thanks for the base of a pizza I will definately make again!

Surprisingly amazing! Really loved this dish the night we had them, even my roommate who doesn't like black beans liked them. They were even good a few days later! This will be added to our family dinners! Thanks!

I added mushrooms, and sautee the onion, garlic, spinach and mushrooms before adding them to the black beans. MMMM!

oh my, this was most definitely a HUGE surprise! What an amazing bunch of flavours that when you first think of it, you can't possibly think it will turn out so good! instead of pizza dough I used a Whole Wheat Low-Fat Tortilla (saving calories) and in place of regular onion, I had some fresh chives to use up, I also used ground chipotle chili pepper instead of regular and omitted the hot sauce after tasting the bean mixture, my tastebuds thought it was hot enough! :) Baked it in the oven about 12 minutes and O-M-G...is this stuff ever good!!!!! I will have to make it for my vegetarian daughter...she will go crazy over it! Thanks for the recipe! it is a definite winner in my book! :) **Brain wave!!! If you combined the bean mixture, spinach and salsa - it would make a FAN-FREAKEN-TASTIC enchilada/burrito filling!!!! top with more salsa and cheese and ooooooooo!!!! YUM! that will be next.... :)

Y-U-M! This comes out perfect on a Pampered Chef stone. I am a mushroom queen, so I couldn't leave those out. :) I sauteed the mushrooms with the garlic and onion before adding to the pizza and it was FANTASTIC. Everything else I did just as the recipe called for and I must say, I am very happy with it. We'll definitely make this again. Thanks!

Really good and different kind of pizza option.  I made the Quick and Easy Pizza crust from this website for the dough and it was super easy.  I also took the advice of another reviewer and buzzed 1/2 can of black beans, the onion, dried spices, cilantro and spinach together in the food processor.  I didn't have any salsa but had leftover bottled roasted red pepper and threw that in the food processor as well.  Salt to taste. Ooo-la-la, a new topping is created.  I added the rest of the black beans to the mixture, adding them unmashed for a little texture.  I did brush my crust with olive oil prior to a prebake for about 5 minutes, as suggested by another reviewer.  Added the black bean topping, the mix of cheeses.  I have a hot oven so at 20 minutes the pizza was ready, but the bottom was still kind of pale.  Only after I had made a bit of mess in the oven did I find out from another reviewer that if you bake the pizza on the lower third of your oven will your crust bake and brown before your toppings burn.  I can't wait to make this pizza again and try baking it on the lower third of the oven! Thanks for a great recipe idea!

I really liked the recipe, I changed it a bit by omitting the salsa (I used diced tomatoes instead) and adding mushrooms instead of spinach. I also didn't bother to mash the beans, and sauteed the onions and garlic, then added the diced tomatoes and spices and heated gently for 5 min. Turned out great!

I loved this.  Made a big pizza, added some chicken brats to it, used fresh spinach, otherwise like the recipe.  Great the second day too.  Used a mostly ww homemade crust.

Oh wow, "gourmet" is right! I didn't think that these flavors would come together, but I was very pleasantly surprised.  I used the ingredients in the amounts stated in the recipe, and the only thing I did differently in making it was add the salsa to the black bean mixture, which made it easier to spread over the crust.  Thank you so much for the recipe, it will be nice to have a change from the usual pizza :)

Excellent pizza.  My monterey jack cheese had jalepeno peppers added, but I don't think that changed the taste much.  My husband suggested adding a bit more salsa next time, but my sister said not to change a thing.  We didn't think it was too much onion at all, but then we love onion.  I might add mushrooms next time, per other reviewers' suggestions, but I won't bother sauteing them first.

Black Bean Spinach Pizza Haiku: "Beyond delicious! This meal met with moans of 'mmm.' Fiesta pizza!" For ease of spreadability, I stirred the salsa into the mashed beans. (As a random note, if you make a smaller pizza and have some of the bean/spice/salsa mix leftover, heat it in a saucepan with some cheese and serve as a delicious dip w/ tortilla chips!) I made homemade crust and used fresh spinach, Mexi-cheese blend, and topped w/ some leftover grilled chicken pieces. The only thing that I'd do differently next time would be to lightly-saute the garlic and onion in some EVOO and mash the beans w/ them. Seriously, this pizza TRANSFORMED our family-pizza-Friday-fun-night into a Mexican-Italiano feast of fantastic proportions and I cannot wait to make it again!

This was pretty good. It wasn't anything special, but it was very easy to prepare. I recommend this for when you are strapped for time. My toddler thought it was too spicy. My husband loved it and raved about it. I followed the recipe exactly, but I use the Pillsbury pizza crust instead of a pre-baked.

Excellent! Omitted the cilantro (not a fan), but kept everything else just as written. My hubby loved it. Will definitely add this to the rotation!

I figured I would like this from the reviews, but my family was surprised at how good this was.  I toned down the heat a bit, just dropping small amounts of salsa verde around the pizza - nowhere near 1/2 c.  I also omitted the hot pepper sauce.  It was just a bit spicy, but it was delicious anyway!  Thanks for sharing!

I was pleasantly surprised how good this actually was.  I made one pizza on a pre-baked pizza crust, and another on on a whole wheat, thin, round sandwich roll.  They both were good, but the whole wheat sandwich roll pizza was incredible!  It is too hot to turn on the oven so I just grilled them, (indirect heat).  It only took about 5 minutes.  I used fresh spinach, (about two cups), sauteeing it with the garlic.  I just added a couple shakes of garlic powder to the bean mixture, since the garlic was supposed to be in there originally.  I will be making this again.

After reading all the reviews, I was really looking forward to this dish, but I thought it was just okay.  I would definitely eat it again if someone made it for me, but it wasn't exciting enough for me to make again.

This was good...pretty flavorful. I made it as described, except that I did sautee the onions and garlic and I only put salsa on half of the pizza (but I do recommend using it...much more flavor with the salsa). I did not use hot sauce because my young son was eating it. I thought this was a very healthy meal(I used whole wheat crust) and I will probably use the recipe again. Thanks!

Kevin loved it! I thought it could use a little work, but not much. We used a chipotle salsa and next time I would add a little more. And I could add more veggies if I wanted.

Very good and easy to make healthy for a low-fat/cal diet. I made mine on a whole wheat tortilla and it turned out awesome. I put some lime juice in the black beans and mashed them with a fork, added some Franks Red Hot Sauce. I used fresh spinach breifly sauteed with the onion, garlic and a tablespoon of olive oil. A light sprinkling of reduced fat cheddar and a dollop of low fat sour cream... all for only 300 calories. So good.

This is a wonderful pizza!  I use Newmans Own Chunky Hot Salsa, but omit cilantro (not a fan of the flavor), and  the garlic because I forgot it the first time and didn't miss it, so one less this to chop.  Mine takes 15-20min to bake, but all in all a five star pizza!

nice flavor ... dont skip the cilantro or hot sauce .. they really make it ... the favor of the toppings though deserves a homemade crust .. also recommend a sprinkle of cornmeal to add to the south of the border flavor (can add it right into a homemade crust)

Easy, healthy, delicious. DH used the words "wow" and "gourmet." I used blanched beet greens from the garden in place of frozen spinach. Made a simple no-yeast crust and didn't have any cilantro but it was still excellent. I found the onions came out a bit crunchy (oven may have been a bit low) so next time I'll saute the onions and garlic a bit first. Will also add a bit of garlic powder to crust. Can't wait to try this on some vegetarian friends!!

I really liked it a lot, but I had to add some water to the black beans to make them spreadable.  Next time I will pre-bake the crust a little too, because the bottom crust was a tad bit undercooked even when the top was brown. Thanks for the recipe!

This was great.  I made the pizza vegan by using vegan cheese, and also added mushrooms and black olives.  Will definately make again!

I love black beans, and I love pizza and all of the other ingredients, but this was really blah.  Maybe I mashed the beans too smooth, or drained too much liquid?  I will not make again without changing the recipe.

Great pizza!!  I used a regular homemade pizza crust and just rolled it out and sprinkled it with some Italian seasoning and S&P.  Also used fresh spinach and it cooked down really well during the baking process.  Also I realized I didn't have the salsa too late, and just chopped up some tomatoes and threw them on there.  So good!

This is delicious - even after we totally ruined it. 

My husband made the pizza dough. We used the Jamie Oliver pizza dough recipe (so delicious).

We already had raw black beans on hand so I soaked them overnight instead of purchasing a new can. Generally, I have no problem but for some reason these beans would not fully soften. I ended up blending the semi-cooked black beans, onion, and spices in the food processor. The black beans had the consistency of water chestnuts (a little crunch which actually worked amazingly well with the pizza).

We also forgot to add the spinach despite having a bowl of spinach set aside with all of the other ingredients.

The type of salsa you use will be important. We used store brand (Great Value) salsa with corn in it. Delicious!

We also added chicken because my husband has to have meat in his food.

Despite these changes, the flavors mixed together with perfection. It did taste very "gourmet" and wasn't difficult to make.

This was surprisingly great!  I didn't have spinach, but I did have some leftover spicy collard greens which substituted perfectly.  Sprinkled the whole pizza with cumin before baking - oh so good!

This recipe is absolutely great!!!  I didn't have any frozen spinach on hand (plus I thought hubby wouldn't approve anyways), so used a can of mushrooms instead.  Still perfect!  Our dinner guests couldn't stop saying how good the flavor was.  Both hubby and daughter thought this was superb.

Used quick and easy pizza crust from this website. Very filling and hearty. If you like bean burritos, you'll probably enjoy the flavour and texture of this pizza. I noticed some reviewers pureed the black beans. I mashed them, as the recipe called for, and the slight chunkiness was excellent.

This is DELICIOUS! I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great. I'm not a big fan of spicy foods but next time I make this (and I will many times) I am going to add more hot sauce than called for because I could barely taste it. HIGHLY recommend! Thank you for sharing this recipe!!

This pizza is delicious!  We are big fans of the combined flavors and textures you get on this pizza. I don't like spicy so we leave off the hot sauce but my husbands adds it to his afterwards. Will make over and over again!

Amazing! I like it without the cilantro, and I cut the cheese in half to really taste the beans. I also use traditional pizza dough, precooking it for crispness.

This was surprisingly delicious. I used a Pillsbury crust and baked it for five minutes before putting any toppings on. I mashed the beans in a food processor. Sauteed the onions, garlic and fresh spinach and mixed that with the mashed beans. Used pineapple salsa. Subbed mozzarella for Monterey Jack and shredded some fresh Parmesan on top.

I would either use WAY less onion, or sautee them before putting them on the pizza next time I make it. The flavors are surprisingly good together, it's just way too oniony!

As written 4 stars only because at CPK I've had a slightly better black bean pizza so I made it similar to theirs which makes it a 5 star. I had a black bean pizza w/o spinach (so I left that off) Added some crushed tortilla chips to the top the last 5 mins of baking. after it was baked I added chilled, shredded lettuce mixed with some cilantro & drizzled with a little ranch dressing.

I really did not enjoy this as much as I had hoped, especially based on other reviews. Be careful with the cilantro, in an otherwise bland dish, it seemed over powering at times. I LOVE mexican dishes, and this sounded like a filling vegetarian alternative, which I'm always on the lookout for, but it just didn't hit the spot. I even used a homemade pizza crust. In my opinion this was just not worth making for dinner.

This was Ok.  I had no MJ cheese or cilantro on hand, and we dont like hot sauce.  I really really wanted to love this, but it was rather bland.  I think I'll have to try again with the MJ cheese and cilantro and edit my rating afterward.   It's a great veggie pizza, I'm thinking it would be good with some bacon or pepperoni on top.

Basically, this is meatless taco pizza kicked up nutritionally with a sprinkling of spinach.  It's good (and very good cold) as written, but it's better made with white beans.

Made this for Easter and used vegan substitutes. It rocked--despite the fact that soy cheese doesn't melt. I made one version with chicken strips for the non-vegans at the table, and everyone's reaction was surprisingly good, we loved it!

Spicy! It could have been the homemade chili powder I concoted or the liberal dose of hot pepper sauce, but this pizza was anything but bland. What really suprised me is that my husband actually really liked this dish a lot (he usually just tolerates my meatless meal attempts). I added fresh baby bella mushrooms as advised by other reviewers, but I couldn't really tell they were there. Also used fresh spinach as opposed to frozen. Although I have not tried the frozen, I can't imagine that it would turn out as well as the fresh did. I used homemade pizza dough as the base. I prebaked it right before adding the black bean mixture. I think the heat from the crust really helped with spreading the beans. Overall a great, healthy recipe which I will make again (using a lighter hand with the hot pepper sauce)!

I didn't like it as much as my wife did...but it was good to see her enjoy it as much as she did, as she tends to be picky.

What I do like about it is it's a healthier choice for pizza.  I'm just not a huge fan of the thawed spinach. Might try it with fresh spinach if I do this one again.

Wow!  This was really good.  I cooked the onions first and added some shredded chicken breast.  Other than that followed directions exactly.  Delicious!

It was my first meal that I made for my fiance when he returned home from work. It was very simple and amazing! I never cook, but this is a meal that I will repeat very frequently!

This was ok.  No one loved it.  It lacked a little bit in the flavor department.  I don't know.  We'll see how leftovers are.  I topped with pepperjack/monterey cheeses and served with some sour cream and sliced avocado.

Very good.  I processed most of the toppings except the cheese bc I have difficulty spreading toppings on top of toppings like that. I also almost forgot the cheese completely and had to add an extra few minutes to the baking time after I added the cheese (I realized this, of course, after it had been in the oven for most of the bake time), but it still turned out well.  I'd add more cilantro next time--didn't have quite enough for my liking.  Overall, though, this was quite good and very easy.  I used the Pizza Dough I recipe on here for the dough.  Thanks for the recipe!

I have made this pizza several times now and my fiance thinks it is the best pizza he has ever had. The only thing I do differently is cook it for about 15 minutes to make sure that it is hot all the way through.  Thanks for the great recipe

This was a pleasant surprise. Even my two year old ate it! I mashed my beans with onion and garlic powder as well as the cumin and chile powder. I omitted the hot sauce and cilantro since I didn't have any on hand. I also used fresh spinach. Very delicious, and quick to put together. Can't wait to have it again.

Good recipe!! Even my 16 year old liked it! Used french bread, fresh spinach, and some mushrooms. Will fix this again.

This was delicious. I couldn't get cilantro so I did without but I know it would taste even better with it. The Spinach was a great addition to the Mexican ingredients.

This recipe sounded so good...but after getting started I realized I didn't have the cumin OR the spinach. (Note to self...check ingredients FIRST!)  I was too far into the preparations to give up so left out the cumin and substituted canned spinach that I drained well.  I used a refrigerated pizza crust and followed the suggestion of putting the beans, onions, cilantro, garlic, hot sauce and chili powder into the food processor.  I prebaked the crust for about 5 minutes, then drizzled the crust with a touch of olive oil before spreading the bean mixture on top. I used a medium salsa, the spinach and then topped the pizza with shredded sharp cheddar.   Even without the missing ingredients I thought the pizza was excellent. I plan to to make it again soon...after a trip to the grocery store!

Hubby and I both enjoyed this pizza!  I followed the recipe exactly and the flavors were great.  The leftovers were also good the next day.  We will definitely have this again!

Easy, quick, and tasty.  I didn't use black beans this time because I had just the right amount of leftover seasoned refried beans.  They were good on this pizza, but I think the black beans would have been better. The other thing I changed was to saute the onion with the spinach (fresh).  Don't intend to give up tomato-sauced Italian Pizza but for a change this was excellent.

I found the spinach on top to not catch any of the flavor underneath, since neither of us wanted hot pepper sauce! Next time I will sprinkle half of the seasonings on top of the spinach.
