These were very good. It's hard to go wrong with pumpkin. I made them just as directed except that I used 1 cup of butter instead of 1/2 butter, 1/2 shortening.
I also added a cream cheese frosting by mixing 8 oz of cream cheese with 1/4 cup butter, 1 pound of powdered sugar, & 2 tsp. of vanilla extract.
A good old fashioned butter cream would taste great with these cupcakes too.
-Chopped pecans would be fantastic in these, or even sprinkled on top with the frosting!
 - Also, if you don't have cake flour, don't fret. You can make it yourself.
Use two cups all-purpose flour and remove 4 Tbsp of flour and replace it with 4 Tbsp of cornstarch. Sift this together very well, then use in the recipe in place of cake flour.
-Lastly, you can definitely "healthify" this recipe by using applesauce in place of the vegetable oil, skim or 1% milk in place of whole milk, and swap out 3/4 cup of the sugar for Splenda.

I loveee pumpkin, and this was excellent! So fluffy! I'd like to try it with ginger next. 

Changes: applesauce instead of veggie oil, 2 cups of brown sugar and no white sugar, almond milk. I would put in less sugar next time because it is too sweet for this asian gal and her family!

1 31 15 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/219676/fluffy-pumpkin-spiced-cupcakes/ ... 'Halved the recipe.  I'm not new to this baking thing ... reduced the sugar to 1c - less than half the amount listed.  'Used my pumpkin pie spice blend, 1/2t cinnamon, 1/4t ginger, 1/8t nutmeg.  These are fluffy, as the recipe states.  'Not like light cake though.  Fine, just mentioning.  Since reducing the sugar, I'm renaming these muffins.  I sprinkled a couple pinches panko & a pinch of brown sugar on each.  Without a topping or frosting, they'd probably looked over.  'Bet they'd be fabulous with whipped cream filling!  These baked not flat, but close.  A little more batter & they would've probably spilled onto the pan. E likes them.  Few days later: even better, still moist, panko stayed crispy.  Thumbs up. 9 26 17 Suspiciously similar to ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/215375/harvest-pumpkin-cupcakes/ ... & doesn't call for buttermilk powder.  Also differences were changes/improvements in Fluffy.  Huh.  :D 11 17 Full recipe, 1t cinnamon, 1/2t ginger, 1/4t nutmeg & allspice, 1/8t cloves. Also good. Try less shortening, kinda a greasy film after eating.

My daughter found this recipe last year.  We've made them several times and she requested them for her birthday this year.  Amazing.  I never have butter flavored shortenning so I just use butter.  I don't have the buttermilk powder either but you can get that buttermilk tang by adding a tsp of lemon juice to the wet ingredients.  (If not you may not need the baking soda.)  These are moist and silky.  We LOVE them.
