My world has changed! This cake is awesome! I have made very complex cakes in the past that don't touch this rich and deep chocolate flavor! I topped it with a little powdered sugar, but it doesn't need it! I will make this again!!

I made this cake for a friend and her family. They loved it and asked for the recipe! I used canola oil ( it is vegan) instead of the buttery spread. I will definitely make this again.

Great cake although I made some changes.
I ground oats in the blender to make oat flour since I was at my Mom's and I could not find regular flour in the cabinet.   I also added one egg.   It was great but I will try it as originally defined the next time.

I made a powdered sugar glaze  and sprinkled shredded organic coconut on top. Took to a party and it was a success!

I doubled the ingredients to make a layer cake. It came out really light and fluffy. I used Almond milk to avoid a Soy allergy. I topped it off with the Vegan Peanut Butter frosting recipe from this site. We loved it!
