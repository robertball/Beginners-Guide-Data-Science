This was good. I didn't have wild rice so I used the regular domesticated kind. The cooking time seemed low for the squash. I cooked at 375F for 40 minutes, and the meat was yielding but not tender. Maybe my fork furrows weren't deep enough. Otherwise, the mix of flavors was quite good. One squash and the leftover stuffing was enough for a meal for two empty nesters.

I made some changes due to taste and what I had on hand.  I used Johnsonville Italian Sausages in place of the breakfast sausage, different spices and white rice.  I also added a trinity (red onion, red bell pepper and celery).  This was YUMMY, either way.

I thought brown sugar with onion and garlic would be wierd, but this was very yummy. I wanted to add pecans, but I did not have any so I added some homemade whole cranberry sauce to the stuffing. This was a nice meatless meal.

Very good and easy!   I made the recipe as written. The kitchen smelled wonderful! It is very fall like. Don't skip the maple.....it adds something delicious to this dish!   A little food psychology.....my family doubted that this was the whole dinner and not just the vegetable!  I told them it was a casserole baked in a vegetable instead of a dish. I plated it with my lettuce salad on the plate to make the plate look full. Everyone was happy! The second time I made it , I substituted brown rice for the wild rice and used dried cherries for the craisins. Less fall like but we thought this rated 5 stars too.

This was good.  At first, after tasting the filling, I thought the dish would be OK but I wasn't anticipating making it again.   After putting it completely together, I loved it.  The nuttiness of the squash offset the saltiness of the filling.  I added more cranberries.  I also think it would benefit from a little extra cinnamon added to the filling as well as being sprinkled on the squash.  I will make this again.

Very good. Used white instead of wild rice. Also used regular sausage and added maple syrup as suggested.  Did have to cook longer than suggested. Will make again.

My family liked this fall dinner! I used regular bulk sausage and didn't add any maple syrup. I used about a cup of cooked brown rice. Instead of using chicken broth, I added a can of cream of mushroom soup. No other changes..

This recipe was good and very easy. I followed the recipe except that I used quinoa instead of rice, added walnuts and melted a little cheese on top.  The combination of ingredients was tasty but the flavor was just a little flat to me, maybe it was the sausage I used?  Next time I'll experiment with added spices, but otherwise a nice fall dish.

Love this recipe!  Wonderful assortment of textures and flavors.  

I substituted the bread crumbs for wild rice.  Will make it again and again!

I made this with the maple sausage but tonight I am just using the mild pork sausage.  Delicious.  I just cut back on the sugar.

Very good, but it was a little too sweet in my opinion. I'm drawn to more savory main dishes, and this was not as much. The only change I made was to swap wild rice for brown rice. Husband enjoyed!

Good, needs a bit of salt, but the cranberries give it a great zing!
