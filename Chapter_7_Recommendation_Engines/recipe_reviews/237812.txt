A produce manager taught me a similar version; with less soggy results. Remove the stem and scrape out the "gills"; grill steam side down on hot grill (or pre-heated cast iron grill pan for 2-3 min in 475-500 degree oven. Turn stem side up, drizzle very small amount of EVOO, add bleu cheese; and drizzle with balsamic glaze. Grill for 4-6 minutes depending on heat. Letit rest for a minute, then sprinkle with small amount of chopped parsley and serve. 
I cook mine on a cast iron pan or grill pan, on the second rack from the broiler. (2 minutes, then 3 minutes.)

I hope it is OK that I used crimini mushrooms, since they are baby portobellas!  I fished out blue cheese chunks from my own salad dressing to fill these, and they turned out great!  I was looking for something to go with my dinner tonight, and this just fit the bill totally!  Blue cheese?  Mushrooms?  What's not to like about these?!  Thanks for the great idea, Anastasia!

Loved this.  I am sure I used a lot more Blue Cheese, but they were great.  Baked in oven at 400 degrees for 20 minutes.  They were perfect.  Can't wait to have again.  Now I have to try a readers suggest from a similar recipe serve on a toasted bun, with a slice of tomato and a slice of red onion.

This was delicious!  I drizzled my mushroom caps with oil and grilled them gill side down for a couple of minutes, then turned them over and filled them with the blue cheese and grilled until tender and the cheese was melted and bubbly.  Be sure and use a blue cheese that you would enjoy eating on its own (I used Maytag).

I grilled these on high direct heat with the New York strip steaks. Everything finished at the same time and the meal was delicious.

I use an indoor grill, and the 'shrooms were pretty soggy.
