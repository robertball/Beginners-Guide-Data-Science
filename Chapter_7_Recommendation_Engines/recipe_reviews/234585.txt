I decided to do everything in this recipe except the hamburger meat since I was serving them today with hamburgers.  I went to the cupboard to pull everything out and didn't have a can of pork and beans.  I guess I should have known . . .I don't always keep those on hand.  I forged ahead anyway and used more bacon than called for but added maple syrup and a sweet peach salsa instead of the white sugar to the mix to add more liquid.  I also added garlic to this and put everything on high for about 4 hours.  This worked out really well and my company loved it; next time I'll try with actual pork and beans. I love that this goes in the slow cooker; makes it super easy.  Thanks for the recipe!

Instead of hamburger, I added ground smoked brisket and served at a family reunion.  Everyone said it was the best they have ever had.  I have shared this recipe many times since.  Definitely the all time favorite!

I got the job of bringing baked beans to a pitch-in while camping so wanted to find a crockpot recipe to make it easier. I cooked up the beef & onion & bacon earlier in the week & froze it in a gallon freezer.  I also added the wet ingredients (minus the canned beans) in another baggie & tossed in the cooler. We tossed the frozen meat in the cooler at the beginning of our trip and allowed it to thaw. On the morning of preparation I used a crockpot liner and stirred in all the ingredients. The recipe got rave reviews from everyone at the party! I think I used a slightly different combination of beans based on what I had on hand but mostly followed the recipe.

I made these for an impromptu barbecue on Memorial Day.  Easy as pie.  I left out the bacon because I didn't want to mess with cooking any, but that would have added flavor and yumminess to already very tasty recipe.   Guests loved it!

I have now made this several times as directed. It is a big hit with everyone at our parties! My husband loves to smoke meat and what side is better than beans! It is easy to prep the night before and then place in the crock pot in the morning! I'm all about easy and good!
