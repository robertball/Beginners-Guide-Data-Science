This cake is delicious. I made some replacements though. I was going to put whipped coconut cream on top, so instead of soy milk I put coconut milk (the watery part of the coconut can). Instead of canola oil, I put coconut oil, and instead of white sugar, I put coconut sugar. As flour, I used half whole wheat, half amaranth flour. I skipped almond extract. I definitely recommend this recipe. Thanks!

I made this for my vegan friend's b-day. Everyone, including non-vegans loved it. I used 2, aluminum round cake pans to make a layer cake. I dropped the temp by 5 degrees, and the cake was done 8 minutes less than the time in the recipe. This paired nicely with a vegan, vanilla buttercream and fresh berries. 

I frosted it the night before and promptly refrigerated it. No issues with the cake or frosting. I may try adding vegan cocoa powder next time for a chocolate cake.

I made this cake for my vegan niece's birthday. Frosted it with a quick vegan chocolate frosting topped with fruit. It was a big hit!

Fast, easy, delicious, moist & dense enough to feel rich, spongy enough to feel like 'cake'.  I substituted half the 'milk' for applesauce (and left out the 1/4 c water) - increases moistness and provides an element of binding in egg-free baking.  I frosted the cake with orange butter creme and it was richer than an all chocolate cake would have been :)  It's so easy to make that I'll stop and make a cake for one of the kids in a quick 10 minutes of kitchen time.

I made this cake but substituted melted Earth Balance in place of the Canola oil since Canola might contain GMO's...plus I overlooked the 1/4 c of water and the cake turned out AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS!  After I poured the cake into the pan and licked the bowl (not literally but you know what I mean-using a spoon ate what stuck to the bowl) & it was SO SO SO good..my rats loved it too! I tore up a paper plate and put small amounts of the batter on the two plates and both rats when after I put it up to their lips-when I went to put it down grabbed onto it!..for Frosting I used a recipe from 'Vegan Cupcakes take over the world' made by mixing 1/2c Earth balance, 1/2c Spectrum, 3.5 cups of organic confectioners sugar, 1 and a half teaspoon of vanilla extract and 1/4th cup of soy milk-all blended well together.

This cake was really good and moist!  We are not vegan (or vegetarian) but this was the only vanilla cake I could find on this site with really good reviews so my 9 year old and I made it.  It was a more dense cake but moist.  I used almond milk instead of soy and light olive oil instead of canola because that is what we had.  Everything else was the same.  We used chocolate frosting on top.  This will be my new go to vanilla cake!

This was my first vegan cake...delicious!  The almond flavoring added just the right touch. I served it with powdered sugar sprinkled on top.

I plan on using this recipe for my daughter's smashcake.  I replaced the sugar with agave nectar and the oil with pure applesauce.  Makes for a yummy and healthier version.  A little more suitable for my one year old!!

Non-vegan and vegan alike appreciated this cake.  In fact some went back for seconds.  Because I didn't have regular white sugar or soy milk, I used (one for one) coconut palm sugar and coconut milk instead.  Cake was a golden brown because of it, but very tasty and super moist.  And looked like a nicely moist cake.   I frosted it with 2-ingredient chocolate fudge frosting I found on Oh She Glows and it was fantastic!

This cake is awesome!  I have made it several times.  I used almond milk instead of soy & cut the sugar in half.  I have also made this with coconut sugar & it still tastes great.  Thanks!

I made this cake for my vegan friend's birthday party and decorated it with a cookies and cream-style icing and decorations. (I uploaded a photo.) The flavour of the cake was very good, but the comment I got from a lot of people is that it was extremely moist and heavy--perhaps too much so. I would have also preferred a cake that wasn't so dense, especially as a lot of guests left some of their cake so there was quite a bit of waste. 

The cake also comes out very short! I didn't expect the layers to be so short so I ended up making an extra batch so that I could add a third layer so it didn't look silly. (I used a 9"x13" pan and the finished cake is less than 1 inch high with a single recipe baked in a 9x13 pan.)

Overall, it was a tasty cake, but I found it kind of unpredictable texture- and size-wise for a recipe that I followed to the T. Would maybe not recommend for company and/or special occasions for that reason!

This woman selling Asian pears at the farmer's market said that the best cake she makes is an Asian pear upside down cake.  Just mix cubed pears with brown sugar and butter and then put a cake on top.  I think I added some caramel flavoring to them as well.  I used four Asian pears and an entire package of that Miyako vegan butter plus really good India Tree muscovado dark brown sugar, which makes you look like the best baker every time you use it.  I lined a rectangle pan with parchment paper (cutting on the diagonal at the corners and then folding one piece behind the other).  It turned over perfectly. I put the Asian pears on the bottom with the butter and sugar and then poured a double recipe of this on top.  I had to cover the cake because it started to brown.  It looked so beautiful that my son and my husband started surreptitiously cutting away from the edge.  My daughter helped me save it, suggesting we take those metal rings and turn them into mini cakes.  Now we have a bunch of ends left over and really pretty mini-cakes.  It's too addictive.

I created an account here just so I could write a review and say how amazing this recipe is. I will make this cake for any occasion in any way possible. It’s very simple, super moist and tastes like a “normal” cake. I can’t say enough about it. You can combine with your favorite icing recipe. I used for my daughters first birthday. As a cake and cupcakes. Both were amazing for vegan and non vegans.

This cake is amazing!!! It is loved by vegans and non-vegans. I used some of the substitutions other reviewers noted: I doubled the recipe, but kept sugar the same amount, vinegar the same amount, and subbed in fresh applesauce for half the soy milk. I used 8 inch rounds to make a two layer cake. I used lemon frosting twice, and chocolate frosting (all vegan, just used vegan butter). It is my go to cake from now on.

This is by far the best vanilla cake I've ever made or had. Ever. My family loves vanilla and pound cakes, and this was better than the recipe that's been passed down in our family for generations. It's moist and spongy, rises appropriately, holds up well when frosted, and bakes relatively flat. It's unbelievably simple and requires ingredients I always have on hand. I omitted the lemon juice and almond extract, changed the recipe to make 10 servings instead of the pre-set 8, and baked in two 8.5 inch circular pans. They only took 20 minutes on the dot to bake. I'm planning on making this my new base, and adding orange juice, coffee and coconut liqueurs to make different cakes.

THIS WAS ASTOUNDING. 
Quite a few Adjustments though: 
almond milk instead of soy
no vinegar 
no lemon juice
no almond extract
no baking powder... 1/2 the amount of soda.
Tasted like a donut cake!!! Very thick. Everyone loved it. So easy and simple.

I made this for my mother-in-law's 81st birthday. I used almond milk because that is what I had. I doubled the recipe and made it in two round pans to make a two-layer cake. I made chocolate frosting. It was a big hit. It was very moist and tasty.

Wow! It's nice to find a simple vegan cake recipe that actually turns out fluffy and moist! I added cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger because I was feeling spicy.

The first time I made it I accidentally swapped the water and oil measurements and when I was about to flip the pan, my dad bumped into me and half the cake fell on the floor. The dogs loved it! We all ended up standing around the counter, eating the other half with our hands like cave people. This recipe is DELICIOUS! I did sub the soy milk for soy creamer since that's all I had. Kudos to you!

It worked. I needed an egg-free white cake and so I tried this, the only substitute I made was using cow's milk cuz I didn't have soy. My daughter, my husband, and I all thought it tasted like corn muffins. I'm not quite sure why, it doesn't have any corn in it at all. Fortunately (most of) the kids at the birthday party ate them anyway. I probably won't make it again though.

Great recipe.  Made this cake for my son's birthday, doubled recipe to make two cute cars.  I did eliminate oil, almond extract, lemon, used only 3/4 of the sugar, and substituted soy for coconut milk.  Turned out great!

I followed the instructions perfectly but my cake was like dough in the middle. I kept it in for 35 mins, then another 10 and then another 15.   I am not sure what happened.

Great base recipe that turned out dense and moist (maybe just a little too moist). I doubled the recipe to make a 9X13 cake. I  made a lot of changes based on other recommendations and because I was out of liquid vanilla and low on sugar. I frosted it with the vegan mocha frosting I found on the site. My substitutions:
*Used 1/2 the water (it probably doesn't need any)
*Subbed rum for vanilla (I was out)
*Used 1-1/4 C. organic sugar and 3/4 C  Trader Joe's brown sugar - I think the mix of sugar is what made the cake taste especially good
*Instead of canola, used 1/2 avocado oil and 1/2 cinnamon applesauce 
*Used 3 T vanilla powder (Sprouts)
*Used cashew milk instead of soy (probably irrelevant)

It was okay. It wasn't a big hit at my sons birthday party. To be honest I felt like it tasted like sweet corn bread. I made a homemade vegan chocolate icing recipe i found to go on top of it and i felt like if it weren't for the icing the cake would of been terrible. Next time I think I will try again and omit the almond extract. I do recommend trying because you might like it. My husband said it was good and so did my mother in law. My mom (who's actually vegan and the reason i made  a vegan cake ) hated it. I guess it's all on preference. Like i said though I may try making it again and try adding a few things to it to make it more to my liking.

As I was putting the ingredients together I realized I didn't have canola oil. I was a little nervous to use extra virgin olive oil but I just used it since it was all I had at the moment. Also, I over poured the almond extract by almost 3/4 of a teaspoon. Oopsy? Maybe not. I swore it was ruined and wasn't confident it would even taste ok. But my mistake and replacement didn't  ruin it. It came out  freaking delicious. This will be my go-to vanilla  cake, and I will continue to make it with EVOO, and extra almond extract.

Honestly, I make this cake all the time. It's my go-to recipe. We don't do soy or almonds, so I use coconut milk and omit the almond flavoring. As written it's also a bit overly sweet, so I reduce the sugar to 3/4 cup. Also, greasing the pan isn't really necessary and can make the cake too oily, so spraying with cooking spray works great. I frequently double it and bake it as a 9x13 sheet cake. It also makes a great layer cake (again double the recipe, bake in two round pans). Overall it's super-moist and has great flavor.

Sometimes you trust the reviews ... I had to find a great vegan cake recipe for a party, hosting mostly non-vegan guests. We are a non-dairy/egg household, and very familiar with mixes and vegan bakeries nearby, and nothing I knew of would be satisfactory for our guests. I read the reviews here (thanks guys - especially non-vegan view!) and put faith into what seems like a "how can that be?" Recipe. It was awesome!! I made it as directed, but used Almond Creamer. 

We are making another today, just for us.

This recipe worked perfectly. I substituted a few things - used canned coconut milk instead of soy milk and I decreased the amount of oil (used earth balance instead of canola). I also used a gluten free flour blend instead of wheat flour. Will definitely use this recipe again!

Ok, I've made this 3 times now and it comes out perfect each time. My cake tonight looks like a magazine cover - I'm currently doing a happy dance.

I made a few changes. I use almond milk instead of soy. I used 3/4 cup of whole wheat flour and 3/4 cup of white flour. I left out the oil and used 1/2 cup of apple sauce. I didn't have any vanilla or almond flavoring so I substituted coconut & rum flavoring. I served the cake with Birds Custard (made with almond milk). Thank you for the recipe. This is my first vegan cake.  :)

Loved it! Rave reviews from vegans, and non vegans. Just made my third one since discovering this recipe. I added some cinnamon mainly cause I'll add cinnamon to any baked good! Added a simple vanilla icing on top and super delish!! Thanks!

I'm not vegan but I needed to make a vegan cake for my friend's wedding and this was the recipe that had the best reviews. It was great!! Great flavour, great texture and it was so simple to make! It even fooled my husband who thought he was sampling the real wedding cake. The vegan wedding guest loved it. I'll definitely be making this again.

Yikes.  Made this and it came out undercooked in the middle.  It was in the oven forever as well.  It was gummy and dense.  Not sure of all the great reviews.  Plus I was not crazy about the taste.

I was looking for a vegan cake with simple ingredients for my daughter's birthday. This was it. I used plain white distilled vinegar instead of acv, I used coconut oil melted for the oil, i used vanilla soymilk (unsweetened), and all-purpose flour. It came out great! I'm definitely keeping this recipe for the vault!!

Made this for my nephew’s first birthday. Pleasantly surprised. Cake was moist and full of flavor. Subbed vegetable oil for canola oil because I didn’t have any canola oil at home. This is a keeper.

I made this for my daughter's 20th birthday.  She's a vegan and wanted a vanilla layer cake.  It was absolutely amazing--moist, dense and delicious.  I doubled the recipe, but otherwise made it exactly as written.  I'm no baker, but this turned out perfectly.

This cake was very dense...it was spongey like the original poster said, but not in the sponge-cake type of way that I was thinking it would be; it was a wet, dense spongey-ness that made it seem like the cake was underbaked. I will keep looking for a vegan cake recipe that is more like a typical cake texture. However, with that said, I used this for strawberry shortcake and once the strawberries are poured over it, you don't really notice the denseness of that cake so it worked very well for strawberry shortcake, so I'd use it again for that! I didn't care for the soymilk flavor in the cake though; I think next time I'd try water.

The cake itself was good but it didn't cook in the middle... Maybe it was because I poured too much but if I had cooked the cake any longer the ends would have burned. Delicious otherwise, though!

It turned out really excellent! I used half baking Splenda and half sugar. I also used apple sauce for oil. Frosted it with a butterscotch buttercream frosting that I made.

Has a somewhat light texture, sort of like a donut, and both tastes and looks pretty great.

I've made a couple vegan cakes before, but this recipe was by far the best. You'd be hard-pressed to tell the difference between this and a cake made with eggs. The only change I made was to use sweetened vanilla almond milk in place of the soy milk.

Delicious! This cake rises a lot when you bake it so don't worry about the amount of batter you put into your pan before baking! I used 2 tablespoons of Lemon juice to make up for my lack of almond extract and still delicious!

Followed recipe exactly, a double batch made 24 cupcakes- baked them for fifteen minutes. Such an easy recipe- I didn't even have to use the Kitchenaid. Only slight variation: I used cake flour as I had some that needed to be used up.

I made this last night with minor modifications because of what I had in the pantry - avocado oil  vs canola,  almond milk vs soy, lime juice vs lemon, all of which I'm sure had no noticeable effect.  This was easy to assemble and after 35 mins in the oven it was an absolute knockout.  I sprinkled a little powdered sugar on and next time I will add a blueberry preserve topping with fresh blue berries just like the slice I had in a famous natural food chain that inspired me to find this recipe.  I can't see how anyone who is not vegan/veg would even know that it is vegan cause they will be so distracted  by the knockout flavor. My only warning is to be careful cause it's so light and delicious that you might be tempted to polish it off all by yourself!

I made this for my husband's mom who is vegan.  I didn't have high hopes for this cake because the batter was really thin.  I was pleasantly surprised by the end result.  The cake is moist, dense and flavorful.  I substituted the soy milk for unsweetened almond milk and it was delicious!

This is the best vegan cake. My entire omnivore family loves it and nearly all of my family members request it for their birthdays. Goes well with almost any type of frosting or filling and it's super easy to make!

I only replaced the soy milk with almond cashew milk and added in a little extra vanilla. 

The cake was lovely and very easy to make.

The only things that i did not follow was the milk part but I did use 2% milk.  I did not have the almond extract but next time I make it I will.  This being a vegan cake I do understand that it is a milk substitution but I did not have it so I compromised.  I do like it very much though and do plan on making more vegan recipes.  Thank you for posting it.

Made into cupcakes using large muffin tin, baked approximately 27 min. Omitted almond extract with no substitution and still turned out yummy!

Did  I make any changes?

So many I don't even know if I can say if is the same recipe. However I did get inspire by this recipe. 


1. I use coconut milk, a little bit less than a cup.
2.No oil. I use a homemade apple sauce, almost  cup.
3. I made my own gluten free flour: 1 cup of brown rice and  1/2 cup of oatmeal.
4. 1 cup of chinese brown sugar (  i am not sure is brown sugar, in Colombia is called panela molida) 
5. I  was so worry about the flour ( try to use oatmeal before and was a disaster, and rice too moisty)
6. I use 2 tablespoon of Apple vinegar and 2teaspoon of baking soda
7.  Skip the 1/4 cup of water, instead I use around 2 tablespoons of apple infusion. 

the rest I did follow.  It turn out EXCELLENT, for me anyways.

good results, great flavour.  i'm always so happy when i bake a cake and it doesn't fall, though i realize that this is rarely the fault of the recipe.  

i used plain white vinegar in direct exchange with the apple cider.  i do this regularly and don't notice a bit of difference in the results.  the cake was not acid at all and had very little lemon flavour.  next time, i will use more lemon juice.

i dropped the sugar content to ¾ cup.  i like cake, but i don't have a heavy sweet tooth.  next time, i will drop this to ? cup.

i used ¼ cup of oil instead of ? cup.  worked just as well.

baked this in a 9" springform and it finished in the recommended 35 minutes.

i'm sure my sugar and oil reductions made for a slightly denser cake than the recipe might otherwise make, but i thought it was quite perfect.  spongy without chewiness and full of flavour.  we ate half the cake this evening dusted with icing sugar and tomorrow i will make a raspberry sauce to pour over the leftovers.  we all agreed that the cake demanded a fruity accompaniment.

I Kinda went different than a birthday cake and did it in a Bundt Cake pan. I glazed it with a recipe i found on google (that was too thick for my taste) But it turned out AWESOME. Even my mom (who is not a vegan) was surprised from how good it was...if was soft fluffy and YUM... I did add food dye (that faded out as it cooked *sigh*)I am going to make more of this cake BC ITS PREFECT AND SIMPLE. I am making one for Thanksgiving too for the whole family.

thought the recipe amount isn't alot for my huge pan it was prefect. I dont have a picture right now but trust me its worth a try. 

And it has to be simple to do if a 13 year old girl with not idea what she's doing can do it with no help :3 thanks for reading my reveiw

Fantastic !! I omitted the lemon, almond, and vanilla extract and replaced them with fresh juiced lemon ~ I juiced the entire lemon so it was very lemony with lemony bits and very healthy !! I also used peanut oil instead of canola ~ I made vegan icing with very vanilla soy milk, powdered sugar, more juiced lemons, and vegetable shortening & then topped it with sliced strawberries and blackberries ~  It was SUPER delicious and my non-vegan family LOVED it =)

These rose decently, and were quick to put together, but without frosting, these cupcakes had a strange, kind of sour aftertaste here and there. I believe it's from the lemon cause it was a lemon sort of pucker (I used fresh-squeezed). I've used vinegar to make vegan cakes before, but I've never had a sour bite to them. I had to omit the almond extract (nut allergies) but I don't think it would have disguised the sourness. I think the acidity needs tweaking. Maybe 3/4 the amount of lemon specified.

this was great!!!! we substituted the white sugar and used raw cane sugar still delicious they are a little bit moist and spongy but still fabulous :-} PS I would recommend the raw cane sugar instead of the White sugar its healthier too!!!
We made this recipe into cupcakes instead of a cake which we think is better

it was okay. i personally did not like it but my mom said she liked it. ( she is not saying that because she is my mom, she is  a very honest person. once she threw away something i made because she said it was gross, she was right though) i was not satisfied with this cake.

Dry - maybe will use applesauce as half of the oil next time
