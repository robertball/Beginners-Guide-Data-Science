Use fat free vanilla pudding instead of yougurt and it will be hit with alot more people since yogurt doesn't appeal to many men. I layer the pudding cool whip cake and fruit to get a balanced taste.

Incredibly easy to make and very tasty. I added bananas and served it topped with Cool Whip Lite. Nice summer recipe.

I have never been a big yogurt fan, but this recipe is amazing.  I subbed pound cake for the angel food and topped it with cool whip.  Delish!  I will bring this to every family pinic this summer.

I made this for an end-of-the-school-year faculty party. I used organic vanilla yogurt from Wegmans. It added a lot of flavor to it. This went fast and the presentation was so lovely.

Everyone loved this-men, women and children. I made it with more and varied fruits. I didn't have a full container of yogurt so I added about 1/2 cup Lite Cool Whip. Light summer dessert and healthy too. Really, really good. I'm making it again this weekend.

Very yummy, although I did alter it a bit.  I made it with half yogurt and half Cool Whip, added a tsp. almond extract and added kiwi and some pineapple because I had it on hand.

My first attempt at making a Trifle. It was my contribution for a potluck. Simple to make, pretty to look at, tasty,and at least somewhat healthy. I will make again, although will experiment with different fruits.

I made this for a Memorial Day bar-b-que potluck, and it was a hit! I am not very good with desserts, so the easier and simpler the better. I made this pretty much along the lines of the recipe, but I used about 1/2 cup blueberries and kiwi, each. I used about 2 cups of strawberries. I also used angel food cake and French vanilla yogurt. I was hesitant with the yogurt - not everyone likes this. However, combined with the angel food cake, which can be super sweet, the yogurt tasted more like pudding. Minimal ingredients, easy, refreshing, tasty - a perfect summer dessert!

Made this for a potluck lunch at work.  used all fresh blackerries because that was the theme; and topped with whipped cream.  Delicious.  Thank you for sharing.
