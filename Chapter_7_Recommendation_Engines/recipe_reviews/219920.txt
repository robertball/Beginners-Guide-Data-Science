I cut the flour back to 2 1/2 cups and added an additional 1/2 cup of cocoa powder to make up the difference. I also increased the baking powder to a full teaspoon and used pecans instead of walnuts. I made muffins out of this recipe, I was able to get 18 muffins. I did bake them at 350 for just about 22 minutes. This recipe turned out moist and delicious--I'm really glad I thought to increase the cocoa powder. My kids both thought it needs more chocolate chips. I think I could get away with cutting back the sugar by half next time and increasing the chocolate chips, maybe use mini-chocolate chips.

Enjoyed this very much, substituted 1/2 cup of Oil and 1/2 cup of Applesauce to cut down on the oil and greasy consistency as mentioned in the other review...Made one loaf for home and one for my girlfriend to take to work...everyone's loved it.  One thing I've noticed is the Chocolate chips and nuts take on the flavor of the Zucchini more so than the actual bread does.  It's almost like eating Coco Puffs...but it's pretty epic...I'll be making this again when fresh pumpkin is out of season :D

this bread is more like a cake..it is very moist i think the amount of oil should be reduced to 1/2 cup it almost is a little greasy  so much so it most definitly has a tendancy to stick to the pan bottom even using a quality no stick pan  otherwise enjoy my family did

Wonderful recipe!  My kids and hubby loved it.  I substituted apple sauce for the one cup of vegetable oil and it was very moist and just the right sweetness.

Great recipe. I made it VEGAN by replacing eggs with 3/4c applesauce and 11/2t baking powder. Also I made the batter into muffins.

This was the best bread I've made. My family loved it. I did use a cup extra of zucchini only because I didn't want to throw it away. It was so moist. I'm waiting for more zucchini to grow so I can make it again.

I replaced 1/2 cup of the oil for 1/2 applesauce to cut down on the fat. Very moist and nice zucchini bread.....but I think it is more like a cake. Thanks for sharing.

This is SO chewy, like a brownie. My daughter's college team loved this recipe! The recipe yields 2 loaves and is now a 'must bring' when I visit.

I cut the flour to 2 1/2 cups, increased cocoa to 1/2 cup, used 1/3 cup oil & added 2- single serving containers of applesauce. It is absolutely delicious & moist, will definitely make it this way again!!

I loved this bread! I made a couple of changes though: I decreased the flour to 2 1/2  cups and increased the cocoa to a 1/2 cup (as suggested by another reviewer), used a 1/2 cup of oil and a 1/2 cup of applesauce, only used 1 cup of sugar, and increased the chocolate chips (I used mini ones) to 1 cup. Due to only using half the suggested sugar, the bread tasted perfectly like quickbread, not cake as mentioned in other reviews, but the chocolate chips gave it enough sweetness that even my pickiest eater kid loved it. Great way to hide veggies! Can't wait to make it again

I made the recipe as written.   Everyone enjoyed it!    As with all zucchini recipes, you need to estimate the moisture content in the zucchini you are using.   Mine are very moist this year.   I would add 1 T water  if the zucchini was dry.

Tried the recipes as it calls out, except added a few more chocolate chips. True chocoholic. My family loved it as did others, it was very moist and lots of flavor.  I did have to bake a bit longer but that may be due to oven temperature variances so be sure to test if it is done before removeing from oven.

I baked this recipe just as printed. It was so dry, worst zucchini bread ever made. Will never make again. Very disappointed. Alot of wasted ingredients.

This recipe was delicious. I like more chocolate chips so I increased it to 1 cup. Other than that I stuck to the original recipe and wouldn't change it. My bread came out moist and everyone loved it. I've already shared the recipe with all that ate it.

I doubt it made much difference but I only had canola oil.  I also decided to make them muffins instead of bread, and they made 24 good size muffins.  Baking time was only 30 minutes too.  They're quite good.  Next time I might use more choc. chips.

This was a simple recipe that family, friends and extended family all really liked. People called after eating this asking for the recipe. My husband has eaten practically one of the loaves in 3 days. I mostly made it as it was written, although i added more chocolate chips and more walnuts since what was called for appeared like too little for my taste. Would definately make this next time I need to get rid of a few zucchinis.

I am making it right now. Not out of the oven yet. I do not use white sugar, so substituted honey. Will let you know how this came out, I also used applesauce instead of oil. We shall see... If it holds together, and taste wonderful. Will let you know!

I followed the recipe, and only  changed the oil to half  the amount with added applesauce. I brought this to my sister's cookout and many people loved this bread. My brother in law couldn't believe that there was zuchinni  in this recipe. I will definitely make this again with all the zuchinni from my garden.

Just made this today, thought it was quite delicious. I was concerned reading reviews that complained that it tasted oily. I use refined coconut oil instead of canola and added 2tsp of expresso powder to enhance the chocolate flavor. My bread turned out very moist with just the right amount of sweetness and no oily taste. I will most definitely be making this again!!!

Used 1/2 cocoa powder and 1cup of chocolate chips,  and increased baking powder to 1 teaspoon.   Very moist and a rich chocolate taste.  Will make again.

Very much enjoyed, I did as others suggested and used half oil/applesauce, used  1 and 1/2 C sugar, and extra cocoa powder.  thanks for sharing, this kicks it up a notch when you get tired of plain zucchini bread.  :)

This was a great recipe! I only had 2 cups worth of zucchini so I used an apple for the 3rd cup. I added in some flax seed meal as well. Family loved this. Thanks!

It was the driest and most disappointing zucchini bread ever, and I've made at least 20 dozen.  I wanted to try a chocolate version.  Also, there wasn't enough cocoa powder at all.  Keep searching or add more oil, less flour.  I made 4 of them.  What a waste.
