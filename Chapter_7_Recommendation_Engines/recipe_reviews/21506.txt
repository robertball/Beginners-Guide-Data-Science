This was great! The only change I made was to omit the celery - just don't like it. I doubled the apples instead.  It was a hit at Thanksgiving!

I thought this was a very good salad.  It was pretty and had a lot of crunch,  It wasn't too sweet.  I served it with Roast Turkey, mashed potatoes, bread dressing, green beans and dessert.  I definately will make this again!

This was enjoyed by all. I left out the celery. It didn't look very appetizing right out of the fridge so I gently stirred it and that helped some. A dollop of whipped cream in the center and a sprinkling of chopped walnuts and a few thin apple slices help presentation, too.

Delicious!  I love gelatin salads with a lot of different flavors and textures, and this fits the bill perfectly!  Love the crunchy apples, celery and nuts, as well as the creaminess of the gelatin.  Yummy!

This is a really good salad..however, it is way too sweet!  I only put 1/2 the sugar in it because it seemed like so much.  It was still extremely sweet.  Next time I won't add any sugar at all as all the other ingredients make it sweet enough.

I had this at a party and thought it was so good.  I had some marscapone cheese leftover from making a tiramisu so I substituted the cream cheese for it and it turned out great.

I loved this recipe!! At first I thought the ingredients were so weird, but wow did they make a great dish! I left out the celery (don't care for it) and for the nuts I used chopped walnuts.  I served it with pork tenderloin and it was marvelous! I scaled the recipe down to 4 servings.  My kids wouldn't touch it (very picky eaters), but my husband and I practically licked the bowl clean. I'll be making this for a dinner party in a few weeks.  Definitely a keeper!! Thanks louc4!

This was a really great recipe to make. It would be great to make for a side dish at a party, or even for Thanksgiving. I left out the celery because I'm not a big fan and replaced it with double the apples. Also, the 1 cup chopped nuts seemed to be too much. I would suggest using 1/2-3/4 cup nuts. I used walnuts and they were great. Overall, it was really good.

I took a chance on this salad and am glad I did.  It didn't look too great in the bowl, but the ingredients worked well together.  And it was very simple to make ahead and chill overnight.  If I make it again, I may reduce the amount of sugar slightly because it was quite sweet.

I'm sure glad I didn't read the other reviews or I might not have made this ever-so yummy salad.  Served it to two other couples who raved about it and I made copies of the recipe for them.

This turned out to be a delicious salad.  When first making it, I thought it tasted a little too strongly lemon flavored, but after chilling, it was just great.  It is a robust salad with the celery, nuts, apples, and pineapple--lots of good nutrition.  Good for any time of year--not just Autumn!  Very luscious salad.

Tried this last weekend with pork chops and dressing.  Salad went very well with it and was yummy!  Didn't add quite as much sugar as others had suggested and did add a little more cool whip.  Will add this once to my "book"

This was a very good salad, I reduced the sugar to a 1/4 cup and it was sweet enough. We had two couples for dinner and both wanted the recipe. It was a great side dish with stuffed pork chops.

I made per the instructions and I thought it was good.  I like the crispy balance of apples, nuts, and celery with the softer jello with cream cheese and whipped topping.

For those of us that gave up eating MEAT, this salad is not for the vegetarian. It has gelatin in the dish. Gelatin is made from COW.
Otherwise I'm sure the meat-eaters of the world will find this to be very good.

I first found this recipe in a Taste of Home magazine in 2004. I have been making it ever since then. It is very easy to make and tastes delicious. I make it for potlucks  and many holidays. Everyone always loves it. The only changes I have made is to use sugar substitute and sugar free jello. And I have some in my fridge now that I will enjoy for dinner tonight. Outstanding!

I just found this to be awful. Maybe it was the cream cheese.

What a great discovery with this recipe.  It has been in my recipe box for over 2 years, and it has been faceless since November 2001.  Only having sugar-free orange gelatin on hand, that is what I used.  I also decreased the sugar to 1/3 cup because my pineapple was in heavy syrup, which has additional sugar.  My family thought this salad was very good and that I should make it again.  I poured half in a 11x7 pan without the nuts for my son and added toasted almonds to the rest of the salad for my husband and I.  I liked the 11x7 pan because it gave me the thickness I wanted in the salad.  It set up well and cut/served nicely.  I cannot wait to make this again using a sugar-free lemon gelatin.  Thanks louc4 for sharing.

We put this together last minute for a pre-Thanksgiving get together.  YUM!!!  Now it was still juicy because we hadn't realized it should refrigerate for four hours.  The reception was fantastic!

Delicious!  Really easy to make and very tasty.  I used more apples and less celery, that was the only change.  I will make this again.

Excellent jello salad. We made it with lime jello and skipped the nuts (I like them but the kids aren't thrilled with them). Turned out great beside the turkey at Thanksgiving.
