Five stars - WITH some small, but certainly not minor, modifications. To rate this any lower might risk turning people off to trying it, and this roast was too good to risk that.  I started with a not quite three pound roast, which I had my meat cutter butterfly for me.  Because of its size, I basically reduced the stuffing ingredients by half. Using fresh mushrooms, shallots and garlic I made a duxelles - finely mince the ingredients, saute in butter for several minutes until it sort of resembles a paste, then deglaze with a splash of white wine. To that I added the artichokes and parsley, a cup of chicken broth (remember, I'm making about half a recipe of stuffing) and only enough Herb Seasoned Stuffing to absorb the broth. Added salt and pepper to taste.  Rather than plopping the stuffing all in the center of the roast  I spread it over the entire roast (which I salt and peppered as well), to within a half inch of the edges, creating a pinwheel effect. After tieing the roast with kitchen twine as directed in the recipe, I roasted it at 450 degrees for 10 minutes, then lowered the temperature to 350 and roasted it for another hour, until an instant read thermometer read 155 degrees. The meat was moist and tender, and the stuffing phenomenal, possibly the best I've ever had. This was just for me and Hubs but it was so beautiful and elegant it would be a great company entree to impress. This involves more than the usual preparation, but it was worth the extra effort.

As written, 4 stars.  If you brine your pork loin, you have potential!  I don't care for mushrooms or artichoke hearts in my stuffing, so I added some dried cranberries and like others, garlic.    To brine a pork loin of 3-6 lbs, mix 1/4 cup each of table salt and sugar in 2 quarts of water.  Soak the pork in this brine for 1.5-2 hrs.  This will make your meat so much more flavorful and juicy!

My sister-in-law had us over for dinner and served this dish. Let me just ask if you've seen the scene from When Harry Met Sally where Harry and Sally are in the restaurant??  Well, that would explain how delicious this dish is!  For those of you who haven't seen this movie let's just say it's better than, ummm, well I think you get the picture.  Truly my favorite dish EVER!  As long as donuts aren't considered a dish. =)

Im not to into semi homemade! Making your own stuffing instead oif using a mnix is just as easyand you can adjust flavors to your liking. The one thing that is a MUST for me when youre making a stuffed loin is you HAVE to sear the outside before you bake! After its tied just place into a skillet of med-hot oil and turn until a nice browned sear on all sides. Then pop into your pan and into oven!This not only makes the meat ALOT more moist after baking, but keeps the seasoning on the meat instead of having it washed away during cooking, it looks a lot nicer to!

Just a suggestion for all of you who seem to have dry meat issues- get a meat thermometer and you will never have dried out meat again!

Very original recipe. I happened to have a pork loin I needed a recipe for, this fit the bill perfectly. Very easy to make, flavorful stuffing. Only suggestions would be some sort of glaze or gravy for the meat because that was a little lacking in flavor.

I made my own homemade stuffing.  I also rubbed the pork with some olive oil and added italian seasoning (about 1 tbls) before baking.  Very similar to a pork tenderloin with stuffing recipe on this sight (which is probably cheaper to make!).  Came out very yummy, although I always overcook my pork because my husband does not like to see any pink....but that is my problem!  This is really a recipe for stuffing when you think about it, so I don't know how helpful my review is!

Very good roast.  The stuffing was superb.  I did cut the stuffing in half and still had some to cook on the side.  Next time I'll season the meat a little more, but I do recommend this recipe.  It was excellent and very easy.

I'm sorry. The stuffing calls for way tooooo much butter and broth.  It came out like soup.  The stuffing oozed out of the roast while cooking(even though I tied it like crazy), and the meat lacked any kind of special flavor.  Once the meat was cooked, the stuffing itself became dried out.  I was extremely disappointed.

Superb!  The only change I made was to rub the loin in olive oil and a little garlic powder, and then coat with Italian bread crumbs.  Everyone raved over this one, and it is such a beautiful presentation.  I wish I could give it 10 stars!

I followed other reviewer’s suggestions and brined the meat (1/4 cup each salt & sugar dissolved in water/soak for 1.5-2 hours) then seared it.  Also, I waited & added broth gradually to the stuffing until it was the consistency I wanted so I wouldn't have trouble with it leaking out.  I didn't have kitchen twine so I had to substitute long skewers to hold it together -- not as easy as twine, but it worked.  I used a large pork loin, so I had trouble getting the stuffing up to the correct temperature without overcooking the meat.  Next time I won't put as much stuffing in the center if I have such a large loin.  It was my fault since I probably used more than the 3 cups recommended.  Everyone loved it!  My 10 year old said to tell you it was "super good"!

I made this for 10 people on New Years Eve and everyone raved. The only change was to leave out the mushrooms, as I'm allergic, and to put a cup of white wine in the pan before baking. The presentation was wonderful and we liked having the extra stuffing baked in a casserole. I will make this again.

The stuffing mixture in this recipe will be our go-to stuffing for holidays.  I used more bread crumbs that called for because the mixture seemed too wet, and I'm glad I did.  YUMM!!!

Will not make again. Very wet stuffing, and very blah tasting.  If you are determined to make this though, I would suggest that you brine it as suggested by one of the reviewers, as that was the one thing that did help the roast be moist and not dried. I don't recall ever giving any recipe this bad of a review on ALL RECIPES! Sorry guys and gals but that is the way I call this one.

Very good...even hubby that does not like artichokes liked it. My daughter liked it except for the mushrooms...would like to have it again minus the shrooms. Only complaint wax that the outside was a bit dry....next time would oil and sear/brown it first. Used half since I used a smaller piece of pork.

Wow! Good enough for company and/or holidays! This looked and tasted like it was very hard to make. I followed the recipe as closely as I could with the ingredients I had on hand. Close enough to say I followed the recipe. I don't normally use much salt and this tasted pretty salty.  Next time I will try to alter the salty ingredients, but that's just my personal preference. I will be making this again and again!

5 stars for the stuffing but the pork roasting directions didn't work in our house. 45 minutes at 400º way - way over done. Thank goodness the stuffing was a big hit. I do have a thermometer but the pork is so thin after butterflying that I can't imagine it would be accurate. I would do 350-375 for 30 minutes and see how that looks. We like pork a little pink. Also, I made have the stuffing for 7 of us and we cleaned out the bowl. After stuffing there was enough to put in a 1 quart baking dish.
