To save on dishes and extra steps, I made this delicious recipe using only one soup pot, one soup bowl, and the blender. You will appreciate this if you have no dishwasher :)  Caramelize the onion with a little butter and brown sugar in a large soup pot. Add in crushed garlic when the onion is almost fully cooked. Remove cooked onions from pot and set aside to cool in a soup bowl. Boil the chicken stock in the same large pot, reduce heat and cook the squash until it is tender. Remove from heat. Use a masher to mash squash while it is still in the pot. Add orange juice curry and any other seasoning. Let all the ingredients cool off a bit. Combine the caramelized onion with the squash broth in blender and blend. Return to the large pot. Heat to a boil, add rice, reduce heat,  and adjust seasoning. Once the rice is cooked the soup is complete.  Tip: the more pale the squash is at the grocery store, the less ripe it is, so choose one with more color.

I sort of made my own version of this soup, and it was if I might say, freaking awesome.  Even my husband loved it and he's not a soup fan.  Orange juice just didn't even sound good, so I left it out entirely.  But the recipe still needs some acid, so I pureed 3 or 4 yellow tomatoes and a green apple in my blender and added that at the beginning.  I also carmelized 2 red onions in butter and brown sugar and added those.  The box of wild rice I just threw in, no need to cook it separately.  I used six cups of chicken broth, an entire large squash which I steamed first and then pureed before adding to the soup, and a whole tablespoon of curry powder.  It was just amazing--the flavor had so much depth, and oddly you couldn't taste curry--it just sort of blended in as if it belonged there.  IMO you can't go wrong with curry, butternut, and wild rice!Thanks for this recipe!!

Since I am making this soup in October here in Michigan, I substituted apple cider from the cider mill for the orange juice.  I added a peeled apple to the onion and garlic (OK, I used two cloves of garlic).  Rather than boiling the squash, I chose to cook it covered on low heat w/ the onion/garlic/apple until it was soft (about 45 minutes).  I like soup w/ texture, so I reserved a portion of the veggies before pureeing the rest.  I cooked the rice in the broth then added to the pot.  The first time I made the soup, I tried cooking the rice in w/ the puree, and found that the rice remained too firm even after boiling for an hour, so cooking it in the broth is the way to go.
I made this soup for some vegetarian friends using a vegetable stock for the chicken, and it was awesome.
I really like this soup w/ cucumber slices - the cool crunch is a nice contrast.
Thank you for this delicious recipe!

This soup is amazing! I microwaved the squash because I was too lazy to peel it. Added a bit of cinnamon, which plays with the curry quite nicely.

The soup was very good. Boiling the squash in the chicken broth saves a big step and preserves a lot more vitamins and flavor. Also the amount of orange juice was possibly a bit much? It added a little too much. I used more curry but curries vary a lot. It's a good recipe to "play" with.

Delicious! Makes great leftovers too. I followed the ingedient list, but cooked it the easy way - just threw everything in the slow cooker. Taking a cue from some slow cooker recipes with similar ingredients I put it on low for 8 hours and it came out great! The four is because I thought it needed some more flavor and so I mixed in more curry powder when it was done. Thanks for sharing!

Really enjoyed this unique soup.  Added some fresh Ginger and apples in place of orange juice.  Put diced onion right in with the squash since you puree it anyway.

I really liked this recipe.  I made a few adjustments based on what I had, and I think it turned out great!  I used 2 cloves of garlic instead of 1, because I love it; my husband went and drank all the orange juice right before I went to make it, so I ended up using apple juice instead and I think it worked really well.  I also didn't have wild rice, so I just used brown rice and I think it's pretty good.  This is definitely a recipe I'll come back to and play around with.  Thanks!

This recipe was excellent.  It tasted great and was not too complicated to make.
My only substitution was that I did not have wild rice, so I used white rice instead.  It was fine, but I suspect wild rice would have added even more flavor.
As a time saving device, and a "dirty fewer dishes" device, I cooked the rice in one pot, and I simmered everything else in another pot, rather than boiling the squash, draining water, then adding everything else.  It turned out really well- I just simmered everything together for about 45 minutes.

Great taste and texture. I did cut the orange juice in half because it felt like it was too much, and I'm glad I did. ALSO, I cut the rice in half too, and I'm so glad I did. With just half the wild rice, it was a dense, thick soup -- with twice as much I think it would be more like sloppy rice than soup! I have made the recipe once without the rice at all, and it makes for a nice, regular squash soup.

I used a little more garlic and onion, and added about 1/4c half and half that I wanted to use up.  This tastes good, and I really like the curry flavor with the wild rice texture.  I might try apple juice instead of orange juice next time, just to see, but I dont' think the orange juice is bad.  Reheats well.

Great consistency and I think this could be delicious however, I agree with another reviewer's comments on the orange juice - it just does not work in this dish.  I would try it again by eliminating the orange juice and substitute tomatoes instead.

Delicious! We wanted more curry flavor so added some red curry paste to taste. This was a great way to use up some leftover squash and brown rice!

Delicious.  I omitted orange juice (didn't have any) and used apple instead.  Make enough for left-overs.  My kids even liked it.

This was a very pleasant recipe.  I wasn't sure how much squash I had so I just added the broth and rice to the consistency that I wanted.  I used only 1 tsp. curry just because I had scaled back the rest of the ingredients.  I added 1/2 c. heavy cream just because I like my squash soup creamy.  That was just enough.  There was something missing, though.  Couldn't put my finger on it.  I will make this one again.  Thanks.

I just made a slightly altered version of this to suit some ingredients I wanted to use up. I added a can of navy beans, a few handfuls of fresh spinach, and a chopped jalapeno, and I substituted the chicken stock with Knorr veggie bouillon. I also used short-grain brown rice because I didn't have wild rice. This is a very tasty recipe.

This was pretty good, but the orange juice was way too apparent. I would use less if we make it again.

This dish is amazing.  The flavor is a delicious mix of fall flavor and a hint of sweetness.    I added some sauteed veggies to it after I blended the squash, juice, onions and garlic together.  I think the extra chunks made the soup more hearty and last longer.    We have a ton of squash left over from the harvest, so we'll be making this often.  Thanks for sharing!

My friends and family love this soup. I make it with vegetable broth so my vegetarian friends can enjoy it as well. I also added an extra cup of broth since it gets a bit thick when chilled. Even though I make a double batch, it doesn't seem to last very long!

This soup was different, but very good. I found the orange juice to add a nice flavor and didn't seem to think it overpowering at all. It's definitely thicker than I would have thought. For convenience I used a rice cooker for the wild rice and an immersion blender to puree.

This is pretty good. I used a buttercup squash and simmered the chunks in the chix broth/o.j. I sauteed the garlic (and some fresh ginger) separately and cooked the wild rice separately, so I still ended up using three pans, but that's okay. It pureed up nicely. I think my version might be a good Halloween soup, because I ended up using some purplish-black wild rise that I got at the Asian foods store awhile back. So I've got an orange soup with black rice floating in it. :) I also added a splash of sherry.

A wonderful soup...the only changes I made was to puree only half of squash and onions to add texture. I also added a can of chickpeas to add a little protein. I thought the orange juice would give it a funny taste, but it gave it the perfect amount of an acidity needed to balance the flavors.

This soup was sooo yummy and healthy!  My whole family enjoyed it.  I roasted the squash instead of boining it.  I also ommited the orange juice.  This is a keeper!

This was a unique variation for the average American cuisine. It's definitely different than other butternut squash recipes but in a good way. It reminded my husband of Peking Duck. I added 1/2 teaspoon of powder ginger to complete what I thought was teh missing ingredient. Also, I omitted black pepper and only used 1 teaspoon salt sicne we always cook with a little less salt.

YUMMO!!!!  I had inadvertently over-cooked a spaghetti squash, so I went looking for what to with it.  I adapted the recipe for what I have in the house: (smoked turkey broth from Christmas), dried onion and dried garlic, apple cider and ginger (per another reviewer).  Then, in my infinite wisdom, over pureed it in the blender.  It is currently looking a bit more like squash chowder, but DANG YO! it's AWESOME!!!  I'm going to NOT add any rice, but make some quinoa on the side to serve the "chowder" on top of.  I'm so psyched by my messed up spaghetti squash soup, that I might actually try to mess it up more often. =)

This recipe was ok, but a little more bland than I would expect

Sorry, but not liking this. The orange juice took an already sweet squash to an even more, unpalatable sweet taste.
Soup had little flavor other than sweet mush.
Won't be making this again

Yum!  I have never made a squash soup before and this was great.  Our OJ was expired so we put in more broth instead and it was fine.  We also used a Cinderella pumpkin instead of butternut squash because that is what we had, and it was still great.  We had some sour cream in the fridge and put a dollop on top which was tasty- not necessary, but good.   *warning- be careful if you use a food processor because it filled ours so high it was leaking out the bottom and we had put it back in the pot and use one of those immersion blenders that you can put right in the soup pot.

Had white rice and frozen squash, but no orange juice on hand. Substituted a splash of lemon juice. Also doubled the curry powder, used fresh chives instead of onions (we're all out), and added a shake of ginger, and a pinch of cinnamon & cayenne pepper. I had some heavy cream in the fridge & added about 1/3 cup. Creamy and delicious! I'll definitely play around with this to vary the flavor in the future.

really did not like the orange aftertaste, the entire recipe seemed to be missing something, and as delish as the curry smelled, it did't really make the soup.  This is one in the "no" column for me.

This soup is really tasty!  I was skeptical about the orange juice, so I waited until the end and added it to a small bowl as a test.  I was amazed by the tangy complexity it added.  It may sound like a weird ingredient to put in soup, but it's definitely a good addition.  I only had one, smallish, butternut squash, but I didn't adjust any of the other amounts in the recipe and it still turned out great.  ****In later attempts I've waited too long to use the squash and it had gotten sweet.  Beware sweet squash, the sweetness really didn't work well with the other flavors in this soup.

Wonderful tastey , healthy soup.
I cut the orange juice to a  dash. I added 2 jalapeno's, finely chopped to the onion/garlic mixture.
I added a 1/8 of a cup of dry cooking sherry. I cut the salt down to a 1/2 teaspoon. Also added a handful of finely cut frsh parley to the onion/garlic mixture.
It came out great. I will make this soup again.Beth

I have made a ton of this already and absolutely love it.  Very filling, works as a meal on it's own.  I add extra hot curry powder to give it a bit more zing.

I did a few things different- I used a box of frozen squash, and I did not put it in a blender or food processor.  I used only 1/4 c. of oj too.  This was very good, even my 4 year old daughter had seconds!  If you want it heartier, I bet chicken would be great in here.

My wife loved this soup!  I got one bowl out of a double recipe?!?  Very good and simple.  Will definately make it again, but only four out of five because it didn't blow my mind.  Just really good.

I bought 2-lbs pre-cut butternut squash seasoned with cinnamon and found this recipe while in the middle of roasting.

Had all of these ingredients left over from the holidays and made the soup 'as is' in the directions!  Delicious.  Boiled my long grain wild rice in chicken broth.  Added just a tiny bit more garlic. My family loves garlic. Will add this to my soup rotation.

I LOVED this soup!  I don't usually cook with curry, because even though I like it, it scares me a little - just haven't worked with it enough.  Thank you for such a nutritious soup!  I did go ahead and add chopped red pepper, shredded carrot and chopped chicken.  This is going into my rotation!

My family loved this! I was in the mood for a dish to serve over basmati rice, so I steamed the squash in some vegetable broth adding just enough liquid, then mashing it. I added cubed firm tofu and jalpeno to the onion mixture. I put it all together with coconut milk. Yummy!

The flavor of the orange juice overpowered the soup.  Next time, I will omit the orange juice to see how it tastes.
