I've made this appetizer many time over the last  10 years and everyone - I mean EVERYone - loves it, even people who think they don't like dates!   One good thing: they don't have to be hot to be good, as room temp works fine - so something that doesn't have to be last minute.   Also good as a center, instead of the nuts:  marscapone cheese with a bit of seasoning of your choice.  Some fillings I've used:  finely grated lemon peel and a bit of honey, orange peel (or juice) and a touch of cardamom, and vanilla with cinnamon.   Try these - it's hard to imagine that your guests won't love them.

Amazing! Rave reviews! Made it for my gluten free family & it was a big hit! Cooking time was more like 35 minutes.

Really good and easy... but I found that I like mine with more bacon, especially when my dates are bigger. Would recommend using a whole slice of bacon rather than a half since they shrink in the oven.

Love this appetizer - simple and delicious and always a favorite of guests.  I also, very lightly, sprinkle a little cayenne pepper on them before popping in the oven

Use parchment paper instead of aluminum. Easier clean up. .
The smoke dpr almonds, the apple bacon gave the  dish a nice subtle touch. People seemed to like it.

I made these last year for the holidays and everyone loved them so much that I’m bringing them again this year! I love that there are only 3 ingredients and the recipe is simple. I would suggest pitted dates if you can find them, just to save some time and messiness.

perfect as written,  Also fine without  smoked almonds or just using regular almonds. Can be made ahead and ree-warmed up when guests arrive or served at room temperature.  People love these

Everyone loved these. We cooked on the bbq, which was a bit hard to control butI don’t like to smell in the house for a party.

These were a big hit with my family and at a party I threw this weekend.  I didn't use the almonds.  I am happy with how it turned out.  Because of the hot weather, I didn't want to turn the oven on the day of the party, so I made them late the night before.  I did have to bake them a few minutes longer than the recipe called for to get the bacon nice and crisp, but keep a close eye on them, looking for them to darken and start to caramelize around the fatty edges.  They kept fine in a baking dish in the fridge overnight, and I served them at room temperature at the party around lunchtime the next day with a drizzle of honey. People seemed to enjoy them, and I made a few extra for the family, which we've served heated, so either way, they're very tasty.  I will certainly make it again.

My sister in law from Sweden turned me on to this recipe. I used Trader Joes dates, took the pit out, put an almond in the middle (nice crunch cause its a bit of a squishy texture without it) precooked applewood bacon half way earlier in the afternoon in the microwave and stored it in tin foil in the fridge, wrapped them with the bacon  (btw it really shrinks so only precook in the micro for 2-3 minutes) and secured with toothpick, then put them in the oven. After they cooked I kept them in my toaster oven on warm for my party. They were a huge success! Ok here is the creepy but funny part...remember "Silence of the Lambs" when they took that moth out of that victims mouth? We kept laughing about how the dates reminded us of those moths....kinda creepy! This would make a great Halloween party treat I think!

These things are addictive! The sweetness of the dates and the salty/smokey flavor from the bacon and smoked almonds just tie this up in neat litte bite of yumminess!  Seriously, what's not to love?  It's 3 ingredients and baked on Reynolds aluminium foil, which makes cleanup a breeze afterwards!
This recipe gets you out of the kitchen and in with your guests fast.  
***These are delicious at room temperature too! ***

I made these exactly as written...AMAZING!  I couldn't taste the almond or get any real crunch from it given how little fit inside so I would omit next time.
