Just made this for supper and my finicky hubby polished off his portion and more, in record time, with glowing compliments! The only changes I made were: to use 2 large chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized pieces; and to reduce salt to a pinch, as soya sauce and vinegar did the trick for our taste. Really enjoyed these crispy , flavourful morsels.  Will use this dredging method,  with tempura batter mix and different flavourings again with chicken and think it would be great with fish or shrimp as well!!
Soooo, I tried this recipe with fish [Banga Mary/Guyanese 'sea trout'] and prawns last weekend. WOW!!! Both batches were polished off before I could take photos to post on this site. Needless to say, rave reviews all round as well.

Excellent recipe.  I don't use the five-spice, but add fish sauce instead.  My family loves it dipped in sweet chili sauce.
