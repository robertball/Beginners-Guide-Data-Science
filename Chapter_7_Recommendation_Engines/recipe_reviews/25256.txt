I ended up sprinkling a little sugar in with the pears to get them to caramelize while sauteing them.  I also added 2tsp sugar and some cinnamon, ground allspice, and a little ground ginger to the batter.  This made the fritters into a sweet, fried treat.  Turned out great!

My first problem was that the pears did not carmelize during the saute.  Perhaps they were too ripe or I used the wrong type of pan-I used a nonstick skillet, but they just got mushy and a lot of juice was released.  I had to strain the juice out there was so much.  Anyway, I was thinking this would be like apple fritters, then noticed there is no sugar listed in the recipe, so I added some and some cinnamon.  When they came out of the fryer, I drained them on paper towels then sprinkled them with sugar.  They were really kinda boring.  I thought the kids would love them, since I don't normally fry stuff for them, but they each ate one and that was that.  I had many left over-not a good sign in my house for a repeat.  We won't try this one again.

Fantastic!!!  I had some borderline overripe pears and needed a way to use them.  I found this recipe and gave it a try.  I'm SO glad I did!!!  I'll for sure be making these again!

I had some pears laying around and I didn't want them to go to waste. So I bumped into this recipe and read the reviews. I decided to change it up just as people suggested what to try. I added sugar and cinnamon when I sauteed them and also to the batter. Lastly I powdered them.
These were great my sister loved them.
Will make them again.

These were really good!  Easy recipe but don't overcook.  They only take a couple of minutes on each side.

The fritters were difficult to make. I had issues with the batter being thin. Plus I wanted more sweetness in the batter. I'm not sure how to fix that, but I would add seasonings in the batter. Also, I did not carmelize the pears. This may have been the issue, but I find it hard to believe that it would have improved the batter issues that much.

First, I could not get the pears to carmelize. So the inside was super gooey. I did it all by the recipe. Kind of bland and could only have just one. Tasted like oil and flour wrapped goo. Bummer, because they look like yummy doughnuts.
