Fabulous!!  I made it sugar free, gluten free and lower in fat.  I heated 1/2 c coconut oil and mixed it with 1.5 c. of z sweet (found at Sprouts/WF), 1 c egg whites, 1 c. unsweetened applesauce (for the pineapple), 3 c. gluten free flour, and 1/4 c. ground flax.  Awesome.

This cake is very similar-tasting to a moist carrot cake.  I pureed my beets instead of shredding, I don't know how much difference it made, but it was less messy to prepare that way.  I also frosted it with a cream cheese frosting with cut-up maraschino cherries mixed in- then everyone else thought the little bits of beet they DID find were cherries instead! 
The top of this cake still is pink, although inside is beige.  
Anything you like with carrot cake would be good with this- chopped nuts, coconut on top of cream cheese frosting, a little orange mixed in the frosting, etc.

Delicious! I made this cake into two 8 inch rounds; one to take to a potluck and one for home, they were a big hit with both crowds! The only thing I changed was to glaze one of the cakes with a warm brown sugar pecan glaze (brown sugar mixed with chopped pecans, milk, and powdered sugar)and I also left out the allspice because I didn't have any. Both cakes were eaten up, and I left the party with an empty plate! If you are worried about an earthy beet taste or picky eaters try using the glaze; pureeing the beets rather than grating them might help too.

I tried this recipe the other evening. I thought it was very good. To me it had a slight banana flavor to it even though there is no banana in it. It tasted even better the next day. I did frost it with a Lemon Cream Cheese frosting. I also used fresh pineapple because it was all I had. My mother did not care for it because it had beets into it and to her beets are not for dessert. LOL

This cake was unbelievably delicious! My friends husband took some home for his wife (my friend) to try (she hates beets)and let her eat it before he told her beets were in it. She argued with him that there was no way beets were in this cake....LOL. So it is that good! Taste like spice cake. I used Butter Cream Frosting 1 from Allrecipes. Everything was very, very good!

I used uncooked beets, grated in a food processor. I'm not sure if this recipe calls for cooked or uncooked beets, but uncooked worked for us. The texture of the cake was very nice, and there were red-spots all over. You can taste the beets this way, but fortunately my husband likes beets, and I (who usually don't care for them) got used to the taste after a while. I would be willing to make this again when I have an excess of beets, adding or subtracting ingredients (like raisins, choc-chips, maybe other fruits). I might try to cook the beets first, although I liked the idea of skipping the long boiling process. Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe! I've begun making this cake several times a year when beets start piling up. It is excellent with walnuts/pecans and cream cheese frosting, though next time I will try a brown sugar pecan glaze as one reviewer suggested.  Living at higher altitude (5000 ft) I found these adjustments to work well: reduce b. soda and b. powder by 25%; raise oven temp to 365. Baking time will be less so keep an eye on it after 30 min.

Family LOVED this recipe. It was a big hit topped with cream cheese icing and chopped cherries.   Changes: I only had canned beets so I put them into my chopper and let them pure√©.  To get 2 cups I used 2-15oz cans and drained them first.  I used splenda to replace the sugar and next time I make this I think I will replace the oil with applesauce.    I made the sheet cake in a 9X13 but I will try the cupcakes for lunchboxes!!  What a great use of pineapple and beets!!

This was a great way to use up extra beets and the my daughter loved the pinkish color.  I used extra beets and it didn't alter the texture at all.  I'll definitely make it again.  I also grated the beets skin and all.

Good cake but has an earthy taste to it. For a healthier version, I used whole wheat flour, half the sugar and a can of 14 oz of pineapple (instead of 8oz, to compensate for whole wheat). I also added 1 cup of sliced almonds. 60 min baking time in a Bundt pan.

WOW!  This cake is delicious and my husband, who hates beets, was stumped by the secret ingredient!  He couldn't wait to go back for another piece!  I successfully substituted applesauce for the oil and added raisins as one reviewer suggested.   I will definitely make this again and again.  YUM!!!

Excellent sweet/spicy flavor mix!  I got a bunch of beets from a farmers market and decided to give this cake a try.  I combined white and brown sugar, 1/2 cup each, but kept the recipe as is otherwise.  Great as is, though I might try adding some raisins or dried cranberries next time...

I really like this cake, but I really like beets too. I boiled & peeled the beets & threw em in the blender instead of grating so I didnt have to wait for them to cool. (What beet I couldn't scoop out, I used for a smoothie with what was left of a 20 oz can of crushed pineapple after I used a cup in the cake, plus some other fruits.) I also used half applesauce-half oil, added coarse chopped almonds, and frosted with lime cream cheese frosting. On the second day, the beet color soaked through the frosting so it was a pretty marbled pink color. Nice!

Good recipe, made "cupcakes" instead of cake. Consistency was more of a muffin than cake. I ground .25cup of flax seeds and added it to the dry ingredients before mixing all the ingredients together. May add double the amount of flax seeds next time.

I had an abundance of beets in my garden so decided to make this cake. My family liked it almost as much as our family favorite carrot zuchinni cake I make with cream cheese frosting. I grated it with the large holes on my grater so instead of it being beige color it came out looking like cherry chip cake, so pretty! I will definately be using this recipe again.

Yum! I was worried about beety taste but I couldn't detect it in the finished cake! I frosted it with cream cheese frosting. It was very similar to carrot cake. I will add raisins and nuts next time:)

I was given a bag of beets and I hate beets!  I haven't eaten them since I was a kid but I couldn't let them go to waste so I looked for a recipe here on Allrecipes and I didn't follow it exactly I didn't have allspice so I used some pumpkin pie spice and  cardomom along with the cinnamon and it came out so delicious! I didn't tell anyone what was in it until they ate some first and everyone was shocked because no one likes beets!  Lol 
I'm making another cake today for a birthday party that we have been invited to tomorrow but this time I'm going to make a cheesecake frosting with some orange zest and of course I'm not telling what the key ingredient is!

I have used this recipe for years with these changes:  In addition to the vanilla I also add 1 teaspoon of almond extract.  I make a cream cheese frosting.  It has one half teaspoon of vanilla and one half teaspoon almond extract.  Instead of a 9X13 I put it in a jelly roll size pan and bake for 30 minutes.  I am known as 'that lady who brings the Beet Bars'.

This was okay.  I probably wouldn't make it again, but it wasn't bad by any stretch of the word.  I topped it with a brown sugar/powdered sugar/milk/nut (cashews) glaze, and it was much tastier after that.  It also tastes better hot.

This cake is SOOO Good. I had a can of beets that I didn't know what to do with. I went to allrecipes.com (my favorite website) and found this recipe. I was so amazed at how moist this cake is. Its also PINK. I e-mailed it  to friends soon after. If you're a fan of carrot cake you should definitely give this one a try. Its a keeper!

Like a spice cake. We used a cream cheese icing mixed w/ cinnamon sugar. Next time I'll try using egg substitute & applesauce for a little healthier option.

This cake was EXCELLENT!!  The other reviews were right - it turns out like carrot cake and a beige color.  I drizzled some left over white frosting that I had and it was soooo good!!  Make this cake!

Good cake but not overly great in my opinion. I par-boiled the beats before grating - not sure if this was expected since there were no instructions about this, but grated raw beets didn't seem appropriate. Made with a cream cheese frosting and this seemed to improve flavors overall.

I brought this cake to my family reunion and it was very popular.  I followed the directions exactly and topped it with a cream cheese dressing.  The cake was very moist and the few pieces I had left were delicious days later.

The only way to eat beets! My teenage children and husband (who hates beets!) loved the recipe.
