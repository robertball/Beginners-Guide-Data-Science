When I make these, I use softened cream cheese that I've added a little homemade dry ranch seasoning to instead of bottled ranch dressing. It helps keep the fillings on the crescent roll dough a little better and it isn't as wet when you go to cut it. Double or triple this recipe--these go fast!

Very tasty pretty little treats. The first batch came out dry (2 tbl spoons wasn't enough. The 2nd bath was great I left out the ranch dressing and used cream cheese. Wonderful!

These sound good, so I've bought all the ingredients (cream cheese makes more sense than ranch) & getting ready to try them. Freezing them prior to cutting makes total sense. But I'm wondering if anyone knows if you could actually freeze them OVERNIGHT so that you could prep a day ahead & then cook them right before a party or if that would destroy the "rising" factor of the dough??  Or if I should just make them right away, refrigerate them, and then warm them up in the microwave (or oven) just before the party?!?!?  Thanks

These are delicious!  For ease in cutting, I put them in the freezer for 10-15 minutes first.  I made 1/2 of the recipe as written with bacon, and used deli ham, finely chopped in the other half.  We couldn't decide which we liked better ..... they were both good.  For the reviewer who questioned cutting the short (4" side), that is correct.  You cut them in 1/2" slices, which means 4" equals 8 appetizers.

Surprisingly these turned out well, even on the first try.  My husband ate way more than I expected and I know he will love it when I make them again. They are a little messy to make with the croissants. After I rolled and cut them, they didn't look like they would stay together. They cooked really well and even. I added more onion than required, but that is my preference. I really like the onion in it, without it, they seemed like it would be boring. I highly recommend this recipe and can be taken even further now that I know how simple they were to make.

**Second attempt turned out even better.  This time I put Pam on the baking sheet. The first time they stuck really badly, but I was able to pry them off. I also bake the bacon first which is much easier than frying and very easy clean up. This time, I prepared early, so I put them in the fridge before cutting them.  I think this made it a little easier to cut and you definitely want to use a serrated knife to cut them. They were still a bit messy and you don't think they are going to stay together, but it all melts together and is so delicious.  I highly recommend this recipe to everyone.  It is one of the simplest, great tasting recipes that we have had in a while.

This receipe was very good! I did use a whole package of ranch dressing mix and mixed it with the entire 8 ounce package of Philadelphia cream cheese. I used a half package of Philadelphia cream cheese for each package of crescent rolls. It turned out very good and very moist. My family loved it! Will make it again.

Went with a mixture of cream cheese and ranch dressing.
Cooled the rolled up pastry and mixture in freezer & fridge prior to cutting.

Recipe is simple. I made these last year for a wrestlemania party and everyone loved them. I used pre-cooked bacon which made it so much easier. I chopped up red onions instead of green onions for a sweeter flavor.

These are fantastic!  I used "three cheese" bottled ranch dressing for them.  They are great prepared exactly as shown, but to make them even better: 1. Make sure you chop/grate the ingredients really fine. It makes them easier to cut, so you don't have to freeze them.  2. Use a very, very thin layer of ranch dressing inside the rolls (just enough to make them slightly wet), and then use ranch dressing as a dipping sauce.  This means everyone can get exactly as much of the ranch taste as they like.  Also - I haven't tried them yet, but perhaps fry sauce or melted butter would make great sauces too.

This is such a good recipe for getting together with friends! I've made it countless times for football games and holiday parties. I just substitute the onions for a nice green pepper. I think it gives it a fresher taste! Enjoy!!!

I didn't have any cream cheese on hand and I opted to use Reese's Bernaise sauce (comes in a jar). I agreed that the ranch dressing might be a tad runny. The Bernaise worked very well. I had a bit of difficulty cutting into 16 pieces. I only got 10!! I will put in freezer before cutting the next time. Next time I will use a cooking spray on the cookie sheet as they were difficult to lift from the tray after baking. The good news is that they were DELICIOUS!!

These are wonderful & so easy to make. Some said directions were hard to follow but I think they were right on. I also made them with cream cheese/Ranch dressing mixed together. I grated onion very fine so it wouldn't hamper cutting. Also added finely minced garlic. Very tasty. I will be making these again and again. Thanks for this wonderful recipe.

Great recipe.  I went along with other suggestions and used 1/2 package dry ranch dressing  to the cream cheese.  These were a great hit.

I will make these again as my company liked them. I used  soft dill cream cheese instead of ranch dressing.  I used cheddar cheese and bacon.  Mine were a bit boring so next time I will add a few more ingredients - a little garlic, perhaps sundries tomatoes & some spices to heat them up a bit.

This was just okay.  If there is a next time, I would add some jalapeños for a little more kick, but just not very tasty.

My family loves them! Good fresh or reheated. Easy to make. I did bring them to a party. Weren't the first to go, but the dish was empty by the end of the night. I was sad there were no leftovers!

This recipe wasn't bad, but nothing extraordinary.  I as well had problems dechipering the directions on how to roll them, but think I figured it out.  Did have with cream cheese and half with ranch.  The cream cheese ones were a bit better and less dry.

I just made these and really liked them.  I did not have bacon so I chopped and fried a little jalapeno bologna, (I know, but we use what we have).  They were very tasty little bites.  I also smeared some butter on the dough before the ranch since some said they were dry.  I will make this often and with bacon the next time.  I know they will only be better using bacon, what's not?  Try this recipe, you won't be disappointed.

I did what many others suggested and used cream cheese.  I mixed dry hidden valley ranch dressing into it.  I found it difficult to cut the rolls into 8 pieces.  They ended up very thin and falling apart but  I ultimately got them to hold together on the baking sheet.

Everyone loves cheese and bacon, so you really can't go wrong.  I'd say these were good and my guests liked them, but they were not anything really special, so I'm rating them a 3.

These are great little appetizers the take to any get-together, and any time I've brought them, I've always gotten compliments. I make them just like the recipe when I have green onion on hand, and when I don't, I just use finely chopped yellow onion. I would also suggest spraying your baking sheet with cooking spray, because they really stick, especially if you add a little extra cheese, as I usually do.

Made this for a club party my husband went to asking for appetizers only.  I used the cream cheese too and along with the ranch dressing added grated garlic.  They were a hit.  The only thing though is they took a lot longer to bake than described in the recipe.  Good thing I put them in early as he got there on time with a great appetizer.  They look very pretty on a platter for a great presentation.  Thanks for the recipe.

Pretty good recipe. Didn't have as much flavor as I had hoped. Will try the cream cheese and ranch mix next time.

Very easy to make ahead, put in the fridge, and make at the last minute. These disappear from every party!
