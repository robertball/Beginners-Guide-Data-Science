Taste was great with some changes.  The original poster must have used the smallest apples on earth to fill this galette.  I used 3 normal sized Granny Smith and it was overflowing with fruit.  I skipped the coarse sugar sprinkle as all I had was Turbinado....and it wouldn't stick to the dough.  Baked for 20 minutes at 450, then reduced the heat to 375 and baked another 20.  The top was a bit darker than I would have liked...you could probably have reduced the 450 cooking time to 15 minutes.  Tasty though!

I love to use this recipe as a starting point, with some small alterations. Must add appx. 1/2-3/4 more flour than stated. I've made it using pears and apples, but each time used just one big apple or pear. Instead of making one tart, I made 3 to 5, depending on how much dough and filling I wound up with. These little desserts are much easier to roll out and fold up and cook quicker. I put the oven to 400 and began monitoring them at 20 minutes. Delicious!

I would definitely give this a 5 for taste! I used 4 very small apples and it was still too much for the amount of crust.  And the high heat for that length of time seemed off. I baked at 450 for 15 mins and then at 400 for 25 mins. Overall this is good and I made it work but the recipe isn't quite right.

A few apples fell from my tree, looked good so I looked for a quick galette to use them.  This fit the bill.  I had a little of my pie pastry leftover so I used that instead.  The filling was perfect and a great hit with the family.

So much easier than making a traditional pie, tasted just as good if not better.  Less time in the kitchen preparing too.  Tastes fantastic!  Loved it.

This is very good.  I didn't peel the apples....it gave it a bit of color.  The crust is excellent.  Next time I think I'll use the food processor to make the crust...I always use it or pie crusts and think it will work well to fully and smoothly incorporate the butter.

Seems like the quicker you throw the crust together, the better this comes out!  Rustic looking, and taste great!

Glad I read the reviews and decreased the time at 450F to 15 mins- then 20 mins on 375F. It was perfectly done.  Added egg wash on crust with Truvia instead ofI added ground ginger and corriander for a more complex flavor. For an extra touch,  topped the fruit with chopped toasted pecans. I gave a rating of 4 because the ingredients would be better listed in order of use.

I followed the recipe and really enjoyed the simplicity of this dessert.  You could add more juiciness to it but I like to try different foods and skills and I wouldnâ€™t have changed a thing.

Fail!! The crust was delicious but too sticky even before I added water. I rolled it out on parchment, couldn't fold it because it was stuck, so I peeled and plopped pieces on the apple pile and baked the mess. It's a tasty filling, but disastrous crust.
