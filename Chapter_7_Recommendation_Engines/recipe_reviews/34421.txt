Excellent - we really loved this recipe!! My husband and I made it as a meal, and served it on top of some lettuce. It was so tasty with the mix of bacon, tuna and avocado. I definitely recommend this dish!

Not bad but after tasting it found it a little bland so I added extra pepper and a little onion powder. No one really liked the dish except me  so there's a lot leftover...as mentioned by another reviewer...I will add tomato and onion on a bed of romaine to the leftovers and see how that goes!

Wow! I was pleasantly surprised with the flavor of this. My first thought was maybe it needed some kind of dressing but the avocado came through with the perfect amount of creaminess. When the bulgar wheat was finished cooking it looked like a bit too much so I added just enough for a good balance with the tuna. Served on a bed of baby spinach for a perfect summertime treat.

I found that there was much too much bulgar wheat in this recipe so next time I will cut back.  It helped to serve with sliced tomatoes and onions.  I served it over a bed of romaine to help balance out the bulgar.
