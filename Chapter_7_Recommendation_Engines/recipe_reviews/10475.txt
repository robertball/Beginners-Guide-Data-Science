I have been looking for the recipe for these cookies. My Mom used to make them and so did my aunts. They were always served at a shower. We called them "Wandi".  Thank you so much for the recipe

This is an Italian fried Bowtie cookie traditionally made in Sicily. I used to have these all the time growing up. It was our version of snackfood.The only difference from our recipe is we do not use brandy or anise seed and use vanilla or almond extract instead. Much better taste.Dad used to make these in his bakerey and always sold out faster than he could make them.

This is almost identical to the recipe that my father got from his great grandmother who brought it from Hungary.  We call the cookies Churtagers.  Dad never knew if that was a real name or just one his "Gram" used.  Thanks!!

This is very good!  It was flaky and sweet.  I did not use brandy or anise seeds, but used 2-3 teaspoons of vanilla extract.  The powdered sugar on it was a perfect touch, and maybe next time I'll try a bit of cinnamon as well.

My Norwegian grandmother made these every Christmas, but used cardamon rather than anise or brandy.  Our favorite treat!!
