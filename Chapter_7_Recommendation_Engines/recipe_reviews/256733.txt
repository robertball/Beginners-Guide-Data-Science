My daughter loved it, I booked hers in spring water and used the water to blend until really thin... Let it cool an d cut pouches out of foodsaver  bags sealed the sides out how much I give her in a serving and made individual serving sizes and vacuum sealed it to make sure I can get the best out of freezing them, to avoid freezer burn and lost/change of flavor!!!

So it says, water to cover..which is NOT enough!! Especially for that time. My water evaporated, and they started to burn, so mine has a slight burnt taste, I'll see if shell eat it. But i through most of it away. Will definitely add more water next time.
