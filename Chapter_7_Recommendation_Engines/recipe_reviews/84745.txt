I only rated this four stars because of the changes i made. First off i seasoned the mixture with garlic powder and johnny's seasoning salt, and insted of using a whole can of cream of mushroom soup i only used half and threw in  about half a cup of sour cream. Also used a bag of mixed veggies. (didnt have any green beans.)It was very good after that. My boyfriend really liked it, its also a great way to use up leftover mashed potatoes!

I didn't use cream of mushroom soup, and used ground turkey rather than beef. Also used onion powder (along with garlic and pepper) to season the meat. I flavored my mashed potatoes with hot curry powder-- YUM, that added a wonderful taste (and smell!) To moisten the mashed potatoes, I made them with the appropriate amount of water and milk, then added about 1/2 C chicken broth. This counteracts the need for any creamed-soup (+ makes it dairy free and cuts the calories.)

I've never made shepard's pie - so I was surprised when my husband came home and knew exactly what it was.  I couldn't stop nibbling at it.  I did a few different things.. not major... but I cooked the onion and added garlic with the ground beef.  I added a little bit of seasoning...salt, pepper, a bit of this and that.  In my mashed potatoes I mixed half of the cheese in them and added sour cream.  I had almost 4 cups of mashed potatoes after the fact, so I threw it all on top of the complete meat mixture .... My husband had his working partner with him when he came home and asked him if he wanted "Shepard's pie."  They finished almost half of the whole dinner.  My 2 year old loved it... but my 3 1/2 yr old...who has gotten soo picky... didn't even try it because he didn't like the way it looked.  Oh well...his loss... This seemed to be great comfort food from childhood for my husband.  Thank you.

This was a great recipe, easy to make and easy to prepare.  It was surprisingly tasty although a bit on the bland side which is part of the reason I rated it a 4.  You may want to spice it up a bit.  The other is the 'mashed potatoes is a bit vague; there are many possibilities for mashed potatoes.  In my case I sued boiled three mid sized russet potatoes in a large saucepan with 1/2 tsp salt for 20 minutes (until tender), then blended with 4 tbsp half and half and 2 tbsp butter.  I will definitely make this again.

Easy Easy Easy!  This was an excellent recipe.   I made it just as written; however, I did put a little garlic powder in the potatos.  The next time I make it I will make about 3 to 4 cups of potatoes.

I make a variation of this using low sodium soup and half a packet of onion soup mix. I use whatever veggies I have on hand. Sometime I add cheese, sometime not. As is, the recipe needs a little seasoning, but it's a good base for a hearty meal/

I never had shepherds pie with green beans before, always mixed veggies or peas and carrots, but I really liked this. The only thing I did different was saute the onions with the beef, and add extra cheddar to the potatoes. My husband did ask if I'd be insulted if he reached for the hot sauce, but I wasn't because he puts hot sauce on everything anyway! I'll definately make this again, for the simplicity of it.

I had no problems with this meal! Quick and easy-AND delicious. My Dad used to use tomato soup instead of mushroom, next time, I will substitute and see if it turns out as good as his. Thanks for sharing!

I wasn't sure if I'd like this but it turned out great and was very easy/inexpensive to make. I used 2 packages of Idahoan instant potatoes in lieu of real ones. Also, the leftovers heated up in the microwave the next day still tasted good. My boyfriend has asked me to definitely make this one again.

A savory "pie" of this sort can be made with many added ingredients, more sliced mushrooms, diced carrots, peas or whatever one fancies. The potatoes are finally given a basket weave pattern using the back of a fork. The little ridges created by the fork will brown nicely in the oven and add to the eye-appeal of the dish. Thanks Steff for your variation on a family favorite.

I made this last night for dinner. I did not use canned green beans, I used frozen. I sauteed the onion with some fresh chopped baby bella mushrooms before adding in the green beans, soup, some fresh ground pepper and about a half cup of milk to thin out the soup just a bit. The mashed potatoes were homemade. My youngest did not like this but both my oldest and I did. Next time, I might try this with fresh vegetables, a homemade mushroom soup base and a cauliflower mash, just to make it a little healthier. I think this would be good with a brown gravy, too (think salisbury steak-ish). GREAT base recipe.

I made this tonight, true to the recipe as I always do the first time and it was wonderful.  Very easy, and well liked by the entire family, even the picky ones. The meat cooked up nicely and all of the flavors compliment each other well. Creamy and flavorful, a great comfort food in cooler weather.
I think this is a great recipe for a quick meal when you don't really feel like cooking but you want something hearty for your family.  We served with a simple salad and bread/breadsticks.

In the midwest we still call it that and we use hamburger. Not to many people I know buy lamb. My mom made it all the time growing up, love it.

I freeze and use left over roast gravy instead of soup. Sometimes add water to make gravy more liquidy. I fry onion with beef, add parboiled carrots and add peas along with a good splash of worcestershire sauce. I mash the potatoes as normal with butter and a bit of milk and mash an egg into the potatoes so that they are not runny. Need a good two cups of mashed potatoes. Sprinkle cheddar cheeese on top and bake for half an hour at 350.

I can't believe I've never made a sheherd's pie until last night. This recipe made what I always thought would be a time consuming dish, very quick and very easy. I used frozen green beans instead of canned and I added a bit of worcestershire sauce to the mix as well. Everyone loved it and it is now going on the list of monthly dinners. Thanks!

Steff never claimed that this was a traditional Sheperd's Pie.

I did cook the ground beef with diced onion and seasoned the beef with salt, pepper and a little garlic powder. My kids don't like green beans so I used a cup of corn. I layered half the ground beef then pototos and repeated. I used about 1/4 of the cheese just to top. Some of the family even topped it off with gravy.

Inexpensive and hearty meal. Thanks Steff for sharing with us.

I'm English, as is my husband, so we tried this out of curiosity since it sounded nothing like real shepherds pie.  Despite the fact that it's not shepherd's pie  simply because it's made with beef -- it's actually Cottage Pie and Shepherd's Pie is made with lamb -- it was a nice flavor.  Cottage pie and shepherd's pie are typically made with Worcestershire Sauce as a base so adding something like oxtail soup or a hearty veggie/beef soup would make more sense to me.  Having said that, semantics aside, it was tasty and easy.

I season the meat and saute the onion.  I use peas and/or peas and carrots only after meat is cooked.  Half the soup is all you need and I add cheese to the top of the meat layer before the potatoes and put sour cream and cheese into the potatoes with a pat of butter to give more flavor.   After its done, I sometimes broil the top of the potatoes so they look more inviting.  I also cook up a package of brown gravy to put over the top if people l ike it.

I couldn't stop eating this dish - such a wonderful comfort food on a cold Fall evening.  I cooked the onion with the meat, added garlic powder, white pepper, and a dash of coriander along with the soup. Also found 1/3 jar of beef gravy in the fridge and added that to the mix.  We'll definitely be having this again soon.  Thanks Steff - this dish made my family happy

Loved this! Satisfying, budget-friendly, very tastey. SUGGESTIONS: be generous with the amount of diced onion you use. Add 1/2 bag frozen mixed (diced) veggies. Add rosemary, thyme, oregano, garlic powder & pepper (all to taste) to the beef mix. Stir in or top mashed potatoes with some garlic powder. Can go with or without cheese! (A little extra seasoning & veg makes this go from good to great & only takes an extra 90 seconds of prep!)

I read several of the reviews, and have to say, it's a great starter recipe. "True" Shepards Pie is made with Ground Lamb, Veggies, and Left Over Mashed Potatoes. When we were growing up in post war England, thats what you had!!  In today's world ground beef is perfect for the recipe, the whole point is to make a meal from the leftovers, tasty, filling and affordable. It is comfort food, fill me up, make me feel at home. However you spice up the basic recipe - it should be what your family enjoys.  Tiny point, if you pull the pie out of the oven  5  minutes before you expect to serve and paint the potatoes with butter, return to the oven, they will brown and crisp the high spots and give you the look that earned the "pie" name.

It is a very tasty dish. I've been making this dish for 30-some years now and it's a great stand by. In MY version, I salt and pepper the ground beef, add a splash of Worcestershire sauce, the mushroom soup, 1 8oz can of green beans, 1 8oz can of corn, and 1 small can of fried of fried onions. Then just mix it all up together. I add a layer of cheese on top of meat mixture, but that's optional, and a layer of cheese on top of the mashed potatos. And since everything is already cooked, I heat mine through in the microwave for 3-5 minutes (depending on your microwave). Until cheese has melted and is hot all through.

I love sheperd's pie it has always been one of my favorite meals.    I cooked 1/2 an onion and a clove of garlic in the frying pan before adding the beef and used some salt, pepper, and oregano with the meat.  It came out spectacular!!  Thanks for the recipe.

This is an easy, tasty "base" recipe. But I can rarely resist "tweeking", so here's what I did: As per others; I cooked the (1 chopped vs 1/2) onion with the beef with a few light shakes of salt, pepper & garlic powder. I also often feel free to use "Cream of Anything" soup (what I have handy that seems like it'll taste good). Veggies: Same thing, whatever's handy (I prefer frozen vs. canned). The potatoes: I use those new "Idahoan" brand pouchs. They're quick, use no milk (which I rarely have on hand) and come in a variety of flavors, which is fun. I've increased the potatoes (using 2 pouches), so that I can spread a layer on the bottom first (1 cup & 1/2 more). It's sort of makes a crust & I like it. But not too thick. *Coat bake dish w/ non-stick spray first!!  Depending on how deep it is, I've occationally increased the cooking time by 10-15 minutes. Keep an eye on that. (Personally, I am a gravy addict, so I always whip up some brown/onion/homestyle or beef-type gravy to go with.)  Looking at other reviews, however, I'm tempted to try using ground turkey in the future: more "tweeking" opportunities! :)  Thanks for this recipe- I've had fun with it- making it & eating it!!

I think this is excellent as is and the beauty of it is you can put whatever vegetables you want in it. It's beyond me WHY someone would start out a review "I gave this four stars because I changed some ingredients" Really? Rate your changes four stars this is fine the way it is!!! Will make again and again! thank you for the great recipe!

Great recipe!  I made a couple modifications to suit our dietary needs.  First, I like low-carb so instead of mashed potatoes, I used mock-mashed potatoes made from cauliflower.  I found the recipe at About.com  http://homecooking.about.com/od/vegetablerecipes/r/blv316.htm   Next, my wife was recently diagnosed with allergies to both gluten and soy.  I couldn't find any gravies, canned, jarred, powdered or otherwise that didn't have gluten, soy or both.  So, I tried sloppy joe mix. It turned out great!

Easy and delicious recipe! I had leftover mashed potatoes and it took me only a few minutes to put everything together and put it in the oven. Yummy hot from the oven and the leftovers were equally good! I added the onions while cooking the beef and added some spices (thyme, salt, pepper, parsley) to the meat, but no other changes.

After I browned the beef I added 1 package of taco seasoning mix and 1/2 cup of water and let it cook a few more minutes.  Then I added the cream of mushroom.  Instead of green beans I added fresh orange and yellow pepper.  These changes gave this a southwest twist.  Mmmmm

This was good.  The reason for 3 stars is I think it actually needed just a little bit of seasoning.  I followed the recipe exactly as given.  Next time, I think I will cut down on the onion, add in some ground pepper and a little garlic salt, plus a little more cheese.  And on a side note, this is really a cottage pie since it uses ground beef instead of ground lamb.  I recommend the recipe, it's really good ... thank you for sharing with us.

This was a yummy choice of the many shepherd pie options out there.  The addition of the cream of mushroom soup made me think of green bean casserole.  Once I made that connection, I think the addition of the french fried onions would make this an even more standout of a recipe.  Try this version and you will not be disappointed!

This dish is pretty standard and ingredients can be changed or adjusted to suit ones preferance. I finely grate rutabagaa, carrots and chop onions to saute with the beef. For information when the dish is made with beef it is Cottage Pie! Shepherds Pie is made with ground Lamb. The latter I prefer.

Shockingly good for the effort. Of course, it's better if you season your beef with the usual stuff (garlic, onion, etc.).

This recipe was great. I did modify it just a little.. I added beef bouillon, garlic, curry powder and steak spice to the ground beef and used canned corn instead of green beans. It was perfect and my husband loved it! Thanks very much for sharing this recipe :)

Another keeper! This recipe was pretty quick and easy. We added carrotts and peas along with the meat and onions and it turned out great. We used grain feed beef that we picked up from our local farmers markets, and it was delish. There's only two of us, so we were able to get 2 meals out of it.

Good recipe! My husband was very excited to have Shepard's Pie for dinner. This was very good. Might tweak a few things next time - like seasoning the beef a little. Definitely recommend.

My family loved this recipe. So did I because it was simple to make. I followed it exactly as written. It had tons of flavor! To address other reviews stating this recipe is bland, all five of us disagree. Between the soup, cheese, and potatoes it had plenty of salt and flavor. Thanks for a great recipe and a yummy variation on a good old classic that is quick and easy. This one is going in the recipe box.

Good! I added some seasoned salt to the ground beef because other reviews said it was bland and I used canned peas instead of green beans. I didn't have enough cheddar cheese on hand so I shredded some smoked Gouda. YUMMMY!!! I think this is a perfect recipe that can be changed up or left alone. Either way, it's good for a busy night when you don't have a lot of time to cook.

Used a whole onion and a few garlic cloves, which I sautéed, then added the cooked meat (used ground turkey). I put a layer of mashed potatoes on the bottom and on top (at least 4 c.) Yum!

This is a great Recipe. We like the red potatoes and when we cook them we simply cut them up and boil them skin and all then when I cream them I add about four Tablespoons of  sour cream to the potatoes before I added the cream cheese. I also use a can of Cream of Mushroom soup, two beef boulion cubes disolved in a cup of boiling water. Mixed them together with the meat.  This dish is  delicious.

I was pushed for time, so I used Idahoan Instant Mashed Potatoes, and sauteed frozen chopped onion with the ground beef, instead of waiting to add the fresh onion. I also seasoned the ground beef mixture heavily with garlic salt and black pepper. After I baked it at 350, I kicked the broiler on, topped with lots of grated Parmesean cheese , and ran it in for 7 minutes to brown, and form a "crust" over the top...delish! This is a keeper!

I thought it was okay, agree with most other reviewers meat needed to be seasoned.  I think it was the cream of mushroom soup that left me feeling so so, I guess I prefer the tomato soup version I am used to.  We ate it all up anyway.

Not such a fan of the beans. Being British and a traditionalist Shepherds pie should be made with ground or chopped lamb. If you make it with Beef it is Cottage pie.

Delicious!  This one's a keeper because it's also quick and easy.  I used frozen peas and corn and I added garlic and doubled the mashed potatoes.  I also added garlic to the beef.  My husband and daughter both loved it as did I!

I think Shepard's Pie recipes vary by locale. In the upper mid west we use corn instead of green beans and tomato soup instead of Cream of Mushroom. The outcome is the same. Wonderful, filling, comfort food!

Not to my taste at all and quite bland. Being married to an englishman, he was personally appalled, so won't be making this again and will go back to his recipe :-)

My entire family loved this, there were no leftovers, the only change I made was I added a bag of mixed veggies instead of the green beans. This was so easy, and so delicious!

Very good recipe. Very quick and easy. I really can't think of anything that I would change other then cooking the onions with the ground beef for preference reasons. Other then that the family enjoyed it. Just good ole' fashion comfort food on a night when there's a chill in the air.

this is a great receipe.  I did sautee some fresh garlic in with the ground beef.  Normally, in this part of the country it is made with English Peas instead of Green Beans!  I did it the way the author intended it to be to try it!  I placed then in individual casserole dishes, and, topped them with Leftover Yukon Gold Mashed Potatoes.  (after placing the cheese on top of the beef mixture)  I used a Mexican Blend with a touch of Philadelphia.  Then, after twenty minutes I took them out of the oven, place a sprinling of cheese on top and returned them to  Low Broil just until browned!  Then topped them with snipped fresh chives!

The family and I loved it.  I used instant mashed potatoes on top and sprinkled with cheese.  I also didn't have an onion so I used minced onion.  Yummy!

This is the first time I have made a shepherd's pie and I had a good result.  Easy, satisfing comfort food!  I did add the onion with the beef so it cooked up before adding the other ingredients.  I added a can of green beans and a can of corn, which makes a good combo.  I also added a bit of garlic, which I think enhanced the flavor.  I agree, it could use a larger portion of mashed potatoes.  I cooked up my potatoes fresh, and ended up with about 3 1/2-4 cups of mashed potatoes...just right, in my book.  I know this will grace our dining table again and again!  Thanks for the recipe!

Good comfort food…and a good way to use up left over mashed potatoes! The only thing I did differently was cook the onions with the ground beef and add corn with the green beans. I think doubling up on the cheese would be a good idea. I didn’t even notice the  one cup of cheese. I don’t think I would make this if I didn’t have the mashed potatoes already made, but it was a simple and good meal.

I used 1.25 lb ground turkey instead of the beef.  Also, I sauteed my onion with the meat, which I seasoned with lots of garlic and Ms Dash.  I used 6 servings of instant potatoes that I made with fat free 1/2 & 1/2 (yum!) that I spiced up.  Also, had a huge can of cream of mushroom that I used part of it in the meat with about a cup of sour cream.  the last bit (did not use the whole can) I used on top of my french style green bean & veg-all layer. And lastly, I used an 8 oz block of colby shredded on top.  I know it seems like a lot of changes, but I feel like the recipe is very adaptable.

Super and easy to make. Nice variation of Shepherds Pie. My kids loved it.  I sauteed the onions with the beef and added garlic as well. Otherwise followed the recipe as provided. Tabasco on my serving was nice.

This was awesome! The only things I did different was (1) I seasoned the potatoes with raw garlic while they boiled (2) I seasnoned the meat with steak salt. (3) I also sauteed the onions in butter instead of adding them in raw. I'll try it next time with a little red wine in with the meat. This is an easy favorite for taste and easy to prepare!

Very good recipe.  I did make a few changes just because I couldn't find the recipes I wanted.  I will share what I did but I am sure the recipe is great as is.  Put carrots in with the potatoes and mashed them together.  Sauteed a whole onion in with hamburger meat after I drained the grease.  Added two beef bouillon cubes and a can of corn (drained) with the meat mixture.  Instead of putting cheese in the pie, I sprinkled a layer of cheese on top the last 10 minutes of baking.

Very good basic recipe, but definitely needs some changes to up it to 5 star. I used a can of mixed vegetables rather than just beans, added 2 cloves of minced garlic, some seasoning salt, and cheese on top of the potatoes. I think a half can of diced tomatoes would be a nice addition as well. Oh, and best of all, I made this in an oven safe skillet, so it was a one-dish meal!!!

We enjoyed this meal, thank you for the recipe. I made it as listed except I didn't have any onion so I substituted a package of Lipton Onion Soup mix instead, just mixed it in while cooking the meat mixture. I added about a half cup of milk to the meat mixture too as it seemed too thick, this extra moisture made the finished product nice too. We especially liked the layer of cheese underneath the potato. I added a half of a brick of cream cheese to the mashed potatoes while preparing them for extra delicious flavor  too, and a sprinkle of garlic powder. I spread the homemade mashed potatoes on top and then tufted them with a fork to get a nice appealing look on top as it baked, I broiled it for 2 minutes to brown the potato tufts topping and it looked great!

Tried this per my hubby's request and the entire family loved it! Even my one year old kept asking for more! We can only eat swiss cheese though because of an allergy so I'm guessing that it tastes even better with a tastier cheese like stated in the recipe!

This was very good! A nice, filling comfort food on a cold January night! I substituted cream of onion soup for the cream of mushroom due to personal preference. Also substituted a half bag of frozen mixed veggies (probably could've used more) for the can of green beans. I will make this again with the same substitutions. I did not think this lacked flavor at all. Maybe the cream of onion soup helped to add some flavor??

This is a great basic recipe. I did make a few adjustments. First I used beef bullion instead of the cream of mushroom. I also made sliced mushroom and onion to cook with the meat. For the veggies I used green beans and corn. It was an excellent meal

My family LOVED this. I added some extra veggies to the green bean mix but that's the only change I made. Very family friendly.

Nice, easy recipe, but I did make a few changes.  Instead of onion, I used a clove of fresh, minced garlic in the browning meat.  I omitted the soup and added 1 can of petite diced tomatoes.  After simmering for 10 min, I spread this mixture in a dish, smothered it in shredded cheese and then covered the whole thing in 2 packages instant garlic mashed potatoes.  My 4 kids ate everything on their plate...what more could you want as a mom?

Tasty and fast prep with the canned soup and veg, use fresh greens and sourcream if you can, less salt. All around fast and tasty for most.

Yummy - but I too made a couple of changes.  I used a pillsbury pie-crust and layed it out on the bottom of the baking dish so it actually had a crust (like a pie).  I don't care for green beans so I substituted with a can of drained corn.  I also cheated and used a tub of already made mashed potatoes.  Quick, easy, and yummy.

I only rated this review a 4 due to seasoning missing.  I add dill and pepper to the meat after browing.  And I put a light coating of egg on the potatoes to give it a slight crust and golden color.  I have also put pats of butter ont he potatoes before baking.  This is one of my favorite family dishes.

This is my go to shepherd's pie recipe.  So easy and so flavorful and the whole family loves it.  I do add a lot of seasonings to the meat and onion as it browns - salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder as well as worcestershire and soy sauce to taste.  Also usually sub cream of potato for the mushroom soup.  Usually use instant potatoes for ease and it's great every time!  Oh, and I use frozen mixed veggies too.

I just made this for my son to take back to college with him to cook in his on campus apartment.  I made it all the way to the point it needed to bake in the oven.  I left out the onions because he does not eat them.  I used instant mashd potatoes..made 6 servings of them according to package directions.  I also topped the potatoes with a little bit more of shredded cheese for decoration.  I think he is going to love this.  Was very easy to make and pack to send off with him.  He loves shepherd's pie and this has all his favorites in it without the onions.

I loved this recipe and so did my husband.  We used a can of mixed veggies, 1/2 can of mushroom soup, and 1/2 'can' of light sour cream.  We did mix half the cheese into the meat mixture and the other half into the potatoes.  I topped it off with smoked paprika before baking and it was perfect.  My husband now plans to make lots of extra mashed potatoes on the nights he cooks.  Thanks for the great 'comfort food' recipe.

This is such a quick and easy recipe, and a great way to use leftover potatoes.  The cream of mushroom soup gives it great consistency - I used peas and carrots instead of green bears, and i season with garlic powder, plus salt & pepper.  Delicious!

It turned out better than I thought. I added the onion to the ground beef while I was still cooking it. I also added a pinch  of garlic powder and about 1/4 tsp of ground pepper. I used 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup and a can of whole kernel corn as well. My family loves dairy so we used 1 cup of cheddar and 1 cup of Colby jack cheese. It was delish!!!!!!!!!!!

I served this to 100 people at a church supper.  I was asked for the recipe by 10 or 12 people.  I did cook the onion with the beef, and I added a can of garden (green) peas.  It is extremely good!!!

My husband and I really enjoyed this. (would have given 5 stars if the kiddo's ate it)  I followed the recipe other than seasoning and cooking the onions witht he beef.  Very good flavor and a hearty meal. That being said my oldest would not touch it and the toddler tried it but did not like it, so maybe not for all kids, but the grown-ups liked it.

Great recipe for a start and then added to eat to make this a family favorite.  Browned the ground beef with onion and minced garlic.  Used 1/2 cream of mushroom soup and 1/2 golden mushroom soup.  Also added more variety of frozen veggies.  Topped with homemade garlic-buttermilk mashed potatoes, no cheese.  Was very delicious.

Made the first time as is and gave it four stars due to lack of seasoning and too much onion. The second time I preapared this dish, I seasoned the groud beef with garlic salt and onion powder, and I added a can of corn. I also used a quarter of a large onion. Half of a small onion would suffice, but half of a large onion is too much. Very good the second time around.

I saute the onions with the beef to soften them up a little more.  I add a can of corn to the mixture. I love cheese so 1 cup is just not enough for me.

I like this recipe a lot. Changes I made were cooking the onion with the meat (and a little garlic), a dash of garlic powder in the potatoes, and I even substituted corn (cause I can't get my crew to eat green beans). I think it is a good base recipe. Thanks!

I made this last night, and my husband and son really enjoyed it.  I didn't have the exact ingredients so I used what I had...instead of green beans I grated up a bunch of carrot, chopped up two small turnips and a red pepper.  Instead of cream of mushroom, I had tomato bisque or cheddar cheese.  I doubled the recipe and used both.  What I like most about it is the versatility - you can use any veggies you want, and your teenage son will never know!  A great way to use up leftovers!

This is a delicious meal!!  One of my absolute favorites, and a treat for my fiance.  He begs me to make it.  I've made it many times, with a couple changes.  1.  I use corn rather than green beans 2.  I season the ground beef to my liking with garlic, beef seasoning, etc.  Other than that, it's perfect just the way it is.  The cream of mushroom soup really sets this recipe apart from the rest.  Anytime I've made this for geusts, they always want the recipe.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe Steff!!

We made this with the recommendations that some of the reviewers made.  We did the 1/2 can of mushroom soup with 1/2 cup of sour cream.  We also added garlic powder and season salt for seasoning.  We did frozen mixed veggies. We also used instant mashed potatoes.  It was delicious! Even my 15 year old daughter came back for seconds. :)  Thank you for sharing.  We will definitely make it again!

We really enjoyed this. I would have rated 5 stars, but I read thru the reviews and did add all the additional spices. Without adding these I think this may have been bland. I added onion, green pepper, garlic & pepper to ground beef when browning. I used cream of celery soup, peas & corn for veggies. Will make again

I used this recipe as a starting point for dinner.  I added onion & garlic to hamburger which was mixed with ground buffalo meat.  I added slightly steamed fresh carrots and green beans instead of canned green beans.  To the soup I added salt, pepper, rosemary and 3/4 c sour cream.  To the mashed potatoes I added velveeta cheese.  I made instant potatoes since that's all I had, I made 6 servings but will make 8 next time.  Not sure my family would have liked it as is but it's a great beginning recipe.

I make this simple recipe but with a can of low sodium tomato soup instead of mushroom soup adding preferred seasoning but fine with just black pepper. I also put the cheddar on top of the potatoes and put under the broiler. Handed down from Mom for a quick dinner

score!! I made a few changes but over all this was a hit with my hubby. we have totally different tastes so finding something we both like is rare. I made mine with a 4 cheese blend of instant potatoes, a can of cheddar cheese soup instead of the cream of mushroom (he hates them), I used frozen mixed veggies and dried onion flakes, and I used leftover Mexican blend cheese from taco night. This was my first time making a Shepherds Pie so this recipe was awesome as a base guide. :)

Pretty good. I added salt, pepper, fresh garlic, and Trader Joe's 21 Spice Salute to the meat. I cooked the meat and onions together in a skillet. I used the can of green beans, and added a can of corn and a small can of sliced mushrooms. I used about 3 cups of mashed potatoes, and I think I could have even used another cup. I served this with crescent rolls. I used ground turkey and low fat cheese to cut some calories. I still think this could use a little extra flavor... I may use more seasoning next time. I also think carrots would be a good addition.

I give all stars because fra nkly I just love sheps pie no matter what! Lol. I did use corn instead of green beans thats how my mom always did it growing up. Also she never mixed the corn with the beef but I did because I always mix my corn into my mashed potatos. I used a can of mushrooms that I accidently opened a dif night that I didn't need to use, I used a large onion and some garlic powder only because I didn't think about it in time to crush some fresh. I used half instant potatos and half fresh because I didn't have enough fresh and added some cheese into the potatos sour cream and butter with salt and pepper (its my fattening fall meal of the week with hearty left overs lol). I also used two dif cheeses that I hand one cheddar and one some asiago mix that i sliced up.

If you are a meat and potatoes family like we are, this is perfect.  With all due respect to seasoned cooks who have a knack for "improving" a recipe, sometimes it's not necessary.  This one works as is.  I do like my onions cooked with the meat to take out the crunch though.  Other than that, maybe a little house seasoning (4 part salts 1 part pepper, 1 part garlic powder) to the meat and onion.  The potatoes need to be "serve ready", meaning seasoned to your liking.  I found the prepackaged REAL mashed potatoes from the refrigerated section work great.  Warm them up first.  I did try frozen green beans once, but the family didn't like that at all.  This dish just doesn't need an elegant touch.  Fast, SUPER easy, and very tasty.  That's a 5 for me!

It's delicious! But you absolutely must put some herbs and/or spices in the meat or it will be very bland.

Ok I know people say you cant rate when you change ingreds etc but when I rate it I do change but I go by the orginal recipe for rating.Like I added spices to the meat and a little bit of the potato to it.Then I put potato on bottom of dish,then the meat and then the last bit of potato.Then I add more cheese on top and French Fried Onions.But since it was good that would mean to me the the original would be good as well.That is how I rate recipes and I like reading other reviews for ideas to add to recipe.Nothing is wrong with rating the recipe and adding whatever else you want to put in it.This is a keeper and I love having the mushroom soup and the green beans added to the meat.so yummy.plus having the cheese and fried onions for topping makes it more tasty.Will be making this again...

We thought this recipe was decent, as-is.  I should've read the reviews before I made it - it could definitely use some more flavor.  I would use mixed veggies next time, and add some more seasoning as well - maybe some garlic powder, seasoned salt, etc.

5 stars for ease and speed of preparation, but 4 stars for the flavor.  Didn't have green beans, so substituted chopped frozen broccoli.  Also added some garlic powder, oregano, and parsley for a bit of seasoning, and sauteed the onions as well.  My wife and I were pleased with the result.  Satisfying fare for every day dinners, but not necessarily a dish I would whip up if I were trying to impress anybody.

This recipe is tasty and fairly easy to make. I find that it is even better if put in a pie crust. Although the potatoes are supposed to form some sort of crust, I noticed that the potatoes were not getting crispy enough and that it was easier to just put it inside an actual crust. Also, I used corn instead of greenbeans. I added some minced garlic (one to two cloves) in with the onion and sauteed in olive oil before adding to the mixture. This added a good flavor. Also added some sour cream and garlic powder as others suggested and this also added more flavor.

This was a very easy and quick recipe.  There wasn't alot of seasoning in it so the next time I make this I will be adding some herbs to kick it up a notch and maybe some worcestershire sauce or something.  Just so it's not so bland.  But all in all this is a very good recipe

I cook a meal for a children's home each month for 12 and this is one dish I fix that is easy to prepare and loved by the children (ages 6-12)  I double the recipe and season the meat and minced onions while they are browning and drain off the fat, but otherwise I follow the recipe instructions.  Like other reviewers, I sometimes will use cooked frozen peas or corn instead green beans and it's always a winner.    Gravy on the side is another option if you want to not use less cheese.

One of my son's favorites.  I have made this using frozen garlic potatoes and potatoes from scratch.  It was good either way.  My children preferred it made with corn rather than peas..but I think that is just a "kid preference".

i havent made this yet but want to. The only problem is that i don't like cream of mushroom soup. Is there something else i can use that doesn't involve mushrooms?

I loved this recipe and so did my little picky eaters! I didn't have cream of mushroom soup, but made it anyways. It still turned out excellent. Thanks you for the recipe!

I'm tired of people rating a recipe when clearly they didn't make the one listed, you changed it by adding differant ingredients, so how could you rate the recipe listed? If you change the recipie, put it up as your own and let people rate it, otherwise don't rate it when you're not actually making the listed recipie....I think all but 2 reviews i read did this...Oh and i gave it a 4 because it did need a little flavoring, otherwise it was very good and easy to make....and i followed it exactly as written.....

Not shepherds pie as I know it. More like a green bean casserole. But very interesting.  Thank you for sharing the recipe!

Just ok - I'd make it again if I had some meat I needed to use up (like I did last night), but not otherwise.  I added garlic, onion powder and salt to the meat, but not even that could make this dish very flavorful.  I would definitely make some kind of bread to accompany it.

This was a Big Hit at our dinner table - though I used a full package of mixed frozen veggies instead of green beans.  -  I will definitely make this dish again.

The mushroom soup makes a nice gravy.  Add a small amount of kitchen bouquet to the mushroom soup; it gives it a great color and flavor :)

Yummy with a few tweaks. Sauted onions with ground beef and added 2 cloves of garlic, some salt and pepper.  Used fresh steamed green beans instead of canned. Leftovers were awesome too!

My whole family LOVES LOVES this. it is YUMMO.  I make it with green beans and I make it with peas and I make it with Peas and carrots.  I put the mashed potatoes around the edge and leave a "hole" to pour the drained vegetables in and bake until it's heated thru.  I can't quit eating it!

Love Shepherd Pie. This is a great way to pack up those Thanksgiving leftovers as you clear the table and everyone has a pie to take home for later.  Turkey instead of ground beef, whatever veggie you served - you get the idea.  We even include the sweet potatos in the mix before covering with mashed potatoes.

This was pretty good but I felt it needed a bit more seasoning.  4 stars as is, 4 1/2 with some garlic, worstestcher sauce and good, buttery mashed potatoes.  Obviously, more than 2 cups of mashed potatoes is needed for 6 servings, that just doesn't seem right.  I'll make this again when I don't have ANYTHING else to make with my 1 lb of hamburger :)

The dish was good but it's not a shepherd's pie. Shepherd's pie is made with lamb; this is a 'cottage pie' As I said it was good, but a bit bland. If I make it again, I'll use more seasoning and probably a different veg.

I'm excited to have a new winter recipe for ground beef. The only substitutions I made were due to my family's taste preferences... So instead of green beans & cream of mushroom, I used a can of mixed veggies & cream of celery. I also used instant garlic mashed potatoes. It was amazing! Everyone in my fam liked it, from the picky 3 year old to the picky 30 year old. Also, I used a 9x9 glass dish. I can see using leftover ground beef to make this dish come together even quicker. Thanks for recipe!

Pretty good.  I cooked the beef with 2 cloves of garlic and the onions to add flavor.  I also added a can of mushrooms and a can of carrots into the bottom mixture because I like extra veggies.  It doesn't really need any cheese, as it doesn't add much flavor to the overall product.  This is very versatile and tasty.

Awesome recipe! I prefer the french cut green beans and added corn! Also added some garlic! More cheese on top of the mashed potatoes and then topped it off with french friend onions! Gave it that perfect crunch! SO GOOD!

So easy and so good. Very mild flavor, great for those with picky eaters! I did saute the onions with the meat so they would more tender and I split the cheese, some under the potato and some on top. The cheese under the potato melts into the meat mixture and helps it stick together a bit, i think.

4.5 Stars: I have had this all my life, but never with the cream of mushroom.  The soup made the mixture much more moist and I intend to use this in the future. I left out the green beans.  I used onion powder (teenager) and I added some garlic salt as well.  We also put the cheese on top of the mashed potatoes.

SCORE!!! The kids loved it! I used ground turkey, can corn, dried minced onion, cream of celery soup, and instant mashed potatoes instead because those are the items I had on-hand. It turned out great! I also put cheese on top of the mashed potatoes too.

As recommend by a previous reviewer I added Lipton Onion Soup mix.  I also added poultry seasoning, frozen corn and cream.  This was YUMMY and right on time!

I have made this twice now, both with peas and carrots instead of green beans (personal preference) and I browned the onions with the meat and added garlic or garlic powder. The first time I made it, I used cream of tomato soup and it was a bit too watery. I also had about 2 cups of mashed potatoes and did not think that was enough. The second time, I used cream of mushroom and about 3-4 cups of mashed potatoes. That worked out very well.

Easy to fix - I used left over pot roast instead of ground beef but followed the rest of the recipe - the whole family liked it.  Thank you for the recipe.

I made this on St. Patrick's day. . .looking for something festive. This was super easy. I used instant potatoes & a bag of frozen mixed vegetables. My 15 month old son ate a ton of it & I was really pleased to see him get all the veggies. The potatoes and cheese were enough of an enticement to get him to give it a try. Again, super easy and a crowd pleaser.

Made this tonight using brown gravy in place of the soup, also added a can of corn, used American Cheese and Cheddar. Also added garlic powder to the meat. In my house of picky eaters, this will be made again. My son started with a tiny portion, then went back two more times for more. Very Tasty!

I always make a recipe following the directions the first go around.  Which lead me to having a bland meal this time.  Next time we make this dish we will deffinatley be adding seasoning.  I think that some other vegetable should be added along with the green beans, maybe some corn or maybe mixed veggies.  Saute the onions in some butter and add some garlic as well.  I would also add salt and pepper to the meat, and then maybe let the onion and garlic cook along with the meat for a bit to mix flavors.  I understand this may be a bit much on the garlic, but garlic mashed potatos to top it off would be good as well.  All I am really saying is play with it, add seasoning to taste, and it will turn out amazing.  Follow the directions if you don't want a lot of flavor.

My husband would eat this every night if he could!  I layer the green beans on top of the meat instead of mixing with the meat but that is my only change.

I used leftover pork roast in stead of hamburger and I thought it was really good.  I do think that next time I will saute the onions first since my husband is not a fan of onions but I hate to just give up on having wonderful onions in my food.

I substituted ground beef with a 12oz bag of Morning Star Meal starters (Grillers Recipe Crumbles) added about a tablespoon of olive oil. It was super yummy!

This was delish!  :)  I also cooked the onions with the meat and added garlic powder, salt, and pepper.  My husband loved it and had 3 servings!  He said it was the best shepherd's pie he had ever had!  Highly recommended!

Great recipe!  Like others said, it was lacking flavor, so I added seasoning salt, garlic powder, Greek seasoning, and a little cayenne pepper.

Absolutely delicious! The only thing I did different was season the meat with garlic powder, a little garlic salt and some seasoned salt.... and I also added just a little bit of cheese on top of the potatoes, along with some french fried onions for the last 5 minutes of baking.  Came out wonderful! Will definitely make again.

Delicious!  I sauteed the onion with the meat (we used ground turkey instead of ground beef), and I added salt, pepper, garlic powder, and dried parsley.  Very rich and moist.  I'll definitely make this again.

We had this for dinner and although I skipped the cream of mushroom soup (family not casserole fans with soup added), didn't add the green beans.  I added 2 cans of rotelle tomatoes with green chillies as I had about 2lbs beef.  Added garlic to the beef cooking and then again in the dish as well as onion.  Placed the meat in 9x11 dish and added cheese to the meat then topped with freshly made (4 potatoes) mashed potatoes and then covered in cheese.  Only cooked for 20 mins as all items were already cooked and just needed a little heating to melt the cheese.  This was just delicious.  We had our green beans on the side.  Thanks for the recipe.

I used ground turkey and cream of potato soup, I actually thought this dish was better as a leftover than when it came out of the oven.  Next time I think I will use ground beef or chuck and corn.

Fantastic! I never made sheperd's pie before, this recipe tastes great with the traditional gound lamb as well. My only change was spicing the meat as it browns as per other reviews. For beef, I add a lot of chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder and pepper. For lamb, I switch the chili powder to dried sage, and rosemary (but still add the pepper, garlic and onion powders).

I rate this only four stars, because I usually season it quite a bit more than the recipe entails.  But my husband and daughter just go crazy when I make it, and I always use this recipe as a starting point.

I really liked this.  Because, we are being careful about what we eat, I used a hybrid potato/cauliflower version of mashed potatoes and made a couple of substitutions - replaced the green beans w/ canned mixed veggies. I also used a little less cheese.  Otherwise, followed the recipe and my husband loved it.

My family of three Absolutely LOVED this shepher'ds pie.  Well actually I tweaked it to fit our pantry/freezer stash.  I used ground turkey, frozen corn and mozzerella cheese because it's what we had!  But between the 3 of us & two meals, the entire 9x13 pan was gone in 24 hours.

Super quick and easy!  Prepared this in about 20 mins, then baked for 30... ready in less than an hour.  It's filling and yummy in the tummy!    ~ I seasoned the meat with pepper, salt, garlic powder and onion powder, and also sprinkled some garlic powder on top of the mashers.     This is not gourmet - but it's a quick dish for folks who don't get home until 5:30 during the week and want to have dinner finished by 7:00pm.

I think this recipe is fool proof! Half way through, I realized I was doing 1/2 of everything except the can of soup. But it still turned out delicious. To the meat I added chopped onions and garlic and seasoned salt. To the mixture I added frozen peas and lots of black pepper. To the mashed potatoes I added cayenne pepper, salt, butter, milk, garlic powder and lots of onion powder. It went so well with Pillsbury biscuits!

Awesome, easy recipe, and I love shepards pie, i always add a can of peas and carrots and to get the gravy consistancy i always used the juice from the peas and carrots and mixed it with cornstarch, well this is so much better and tastier. I lways like to try the recipe just the way it is written and then make changes the next time if I want, but this is really good just the way it is.

I made a few changes, just based on what I had in the house.  I used Golden Mushroom soup, and frozen mixed veggies.  I also sauteed the onion with the hamburger, and threw in a little minced garlic and worstershire sauce.  I always make my mashed potatoes with butter, milk and a little cream cheese.  This was fabulous!  I was pleasantly surprised at how tasty it was. Especially because it was much simpler than other Shepherd's Pie recipes I've tried!  My husband and his boss gave it 2 thumbs up, and both said it was a definite re-do.  Thank you so much for a recipe I will use often!

This is very similar to what I have been making since I got married. I use frozen mixed vegetables and cook the onion in with the ground beef. I like veggies to have  crunch to them so the frozen makes that possible. My family absolutly loves sheperds pie.

I needed a quick easy meal and this worked out great.  I used ground turkey and added 3 cloves garlic.  I did soften the onion and garlic with the turkey as it browned.  Used cheddar and monterey jack and added more cheese on top of the potatoes for the last 10 min. of baking time.  Pretty tasty stuff....Thanks!

This was really easy to make and delicious with a little tweak to the recipe. I used minced lamb instead of beef. I seasoned the minced lamb with garlic powder and rosemary, and used only half a can of mushroom soup. The herbs added extra flavour, which made a world of difference! I also added a genenerous dollop of butter to the mashed potatoes and topped it with grated red cheddar. (I only rated it a 4-star because without the herbs, the lamb would definitely have been a tad bland!) Simply yummy........everyone loved it! Will definitely make it again!

Great basic recipe. I was making a roast in the crock pot and wasn't happy with how the meat was coming out (a little stringier than I prefer for sliced roast). So I decided to look up recipes for Shepherd's pie and found this and it worked great. I added about 1T Worcestershire sauce and the roast was seasoned with salt, pepper & garlic and cooked for several hours on low heat. I didn't add onions but did add some fresh mushrooms. Otherwise I stuck to the recipe because it sounded good, and it really was! Hubby will be taking it along to work for many days, lol.

This meets all my criteria: Simple, quick, ingredients are already in the kitchen, and-oh, yes... it tastes good. I used the instant envelope mashed potatoes, Baby Reds, and I substituted Cream of Celery instead of Mushroom (just a personal matter of taste. This will be a regular for us.

I made this tonight for dinner and it was a big hit with my hubby. He said it is now one of his favorite dishes. I used ground turkey and added about 3/4 of a packet of dry onion soup mix to the meat as it was cooking and also added mixed veggies instead of just green beans.  I did not have cream of mushroom soup so used cream of chicken instead and used instant garlic flavored mashed potatoes.  It turned out grrreat!  Thanks for this easy, delicious recipe. Will definately be making this again soon.

5 stars for just plain ease.  I did not have any green beans so I didn't add these but everything else was great.  So simple that chances are you have everything on hand to make this in no time also a great way of using up leftover mashed potatos and the kids will gobble it up.

I have made this several times but this time was the best with a few changes. I sautéed the onion with minced garlic, then browned the beef and added cavenders seasoning to taste. Added a can of corn (drained) for more veggie and variety. Used Idahoan instant mashed potatoes home style butter flavor and added Lowry garlic salt with parley. For some reason I alway put the cheese on top of the potatoes instead of in the middle. It doesn’t change anything and we love it!!

I made it. A suggestion is to use a large cast iron skillet. Then it becomes pretty much a one pot meal. I would probably use frozen beans the next time. Very easy to put together. I also used very lean ground beef so no need to drain.

This is essentially the recipe my mom has always used.  Recently,  I made it with cream of celery soup instead.  I also added diced jalapeno with seeds to the beef.  I know that's not usual shepherd's pie at all, but it was delicious! I won't make it any other way now. I also recommend seasoning the beef with garlic salt. It's pretty bland without.

Husband and 4 year old daughter went back for seconds!  Big hit.  Will definitely make it again.
I used frozen veggie medley (corn, peas, carrots), frozen green beans, and frozen mushrooms.  

On top I sprinkled some black pepper pecorino cheese instead of the cheddar since I didn't have any cheddar.  It was delicious!

Tasted great and my family loved it. I used a can of corn instead of green beans because that's all I had on hand; and I was able to use up mashed potatoes that we had leftover from Thanksgiving. I did put a few pats of butter on top about 1/2 way through baking.  It was quick, easy, and tasty comfort food!

The family loved it.  The cheese was a nice twist.  We used sweet peas instead of green beans and next time we'll make more mashed potatoes and use more meat to fit our 3 qt pan. We may season the meat a little more next time, but for those who say it's bland, shepherd's pie usually isn't all that savory to begin with.

Was good. Like others I did make a few changes. I used Alfredo sauce in place of the cream of mushroom soup and added a can of sliced mushroom.  I also added garlic powder.

The 2nd time I used chopped green bell peppers and onions in stead of the green & wax beans.  Really delicious!

After reading all the reviews, I decided to add a half packet of onion soup mix to the ground beef. And instead of plain mashed potatoes, I used a packet of instant roasted garlic and cheddar flavored mashed potatoes. It was delicious! I know my family will be asking for this dish again!

The original recipe is very plain, but easy to make adjustments. Here are some variations I have done with this recipe:
-Use Cream of Celary or Cream of Broccoli instead of mushroom
-Add various flavors to the mashed potatoes (I boil garlic with them and even have added gravy to them. The gravy was DELICIOUS!!)
-Use various veggies, not just green beans.  Frozen mixed veggies were my favorite.
-Cook things in with the meat. Saute onions and mushrooms with it. Seasoning salt is good too. Or even just salt and pepper.
My next experiment will be to use cream cheese in the meat mix.  Hopefully it turns out just as tasty.

I love Sheperds Pie, I increased the amount of mashed potatoes, by about 10 cups, and added frozen mixed vegetables, instead of just green beans, I also added a can of milk with the can of mushroom soup so it's not so dry, delish.

as others suggested, I added half the cream of mushroom  soup and a 3 dallops of sour cream.  instead of the green beans, I used a package of frozen mixed veggies.   as I browned the beef, I added half a chopped onion and a teaspoon of garlic from the jar.  but-- the best part-- is I used KFC mashed potatoes across the top.  baked to a golden crisp. my family RAVED how delicious it was.  absolutely loved it. thanks for such a great and easy base recipe.  we loved it.

I made this recipe for my family and it was amazing, I changed a couple things like, I didn't use the mushroom soup and I spiced up the meat. I also didn't put the shepards pie in the oven, I just put it in the slow cooker on medium for the day.

I gave it a 4 only because its a great starter recipe for anyone to try. You must figure out your own seasonings you would like. I added sour cream to the meat with the cream of mushroom. I also made my mashed potatoes with red skin, buttermilk, butter,sour cream, milk,parsley and salt and pepper to taste (if needed). It was a winner here!

This was simple to make and very tasty. I used green beans and corn, as they are our favorite vegetables, and added some garlic and fresh basil to the meat. Other than that, the recipe was followed. I definitely would make it again, since it is such a great comfort food!

The only addition I made was to add a 1/2 packet of Lipton onion soup mix to the hamburger once prepared, instead of chopped onion. The seasonings make this anything but bland. And I layer the hamburger, then green beans, adding cheese and topping with Mashed potatoes.   I cannot stop eating this and everyone loves  this recipe.

It is a great recipe to use as a base, but you will need to season according to your personal tastes. I added garlic powder, Worcestershire sauce, chopped up a little fresh basil, changed green beans to mixed veggies, fresh ground pepper, and a packet of onion soup mix.  That definitely kicked it up to the next level and the whole family loved it.

Thank you for the recipe, I always wanted to try 'Shepard's Pie'.

I have been making this for a long time in one version or another. The only thing different is that I season the meat with salt, pepper and onions. I have not done the cheese but I will next time.

i used this for directions. Subbed: 16 oz diced tomatoes instead of cream of mushroom, 1 c mixed veggies, seasoned with 1/2 bay leaf, 1 tbsp steak sauce, garlic, minced onion, and pepper. recommend extra lean beef because 1)much better for you (the extra fat soaks into the meat that you eat when you cook it, 2) don't have to drain alot (less waste), 3) much much better flavor.

Rated 5 stars if made with these changes - add some garlic powder, onion powder, and seasoning salt to the beef. I used the whole can of cream of mushroom soup but also added 2 dollops of sour cream. I also included a can of corn. For the potatoes I used Sour Cream and Onion instant potatoes - these made the difference! Everyone loved this, next time I will have to double the recipe as we did not have enough!

We loved this but I gave it 4 because we changed quite a bit of it and the mashed potatoes didn't have directions.  We made our mashed potatoes with a little butter, cheese, garlic, onion powder, pepper, and chicken stock and doubled it.  We used lamb instead of beef, and added corn to the lamb mixture.  It was great.  Everyone loved it.

Long time family favorite BUT it is much better when you substitute tomato soup and add a little garlic.  Very good!

This is a great basic recipe...all I did to make it not so bland was add a pinch of salt, 2 tablespoons of Italian Seasoning and 2 tablespoons of Minced Onions (dried). Didn't bother with the regular onion. Made it a lot better.

Super easy and delicious! I make this frequently! I usually add the cruchy fried onions on the top for a little extra crunch. It's kinda like green bean casserole but with potatoes on top. YUM!

In my version of Shepard pie i use a bag of frozen corn and 2 bags of the frozen steam and mash potatoes. What i do is first ground the hamburger and add the seasoning and put it in the bottom of the pan, i then add the frozen corn and 12 ounces of finely shredded fiesta blend cheese, then i top it with the mash potatoes and bake for about 30 mins on 350. Seems like i never have enough, and its real simple to make. My family loves shepherds pie.

Okay...first off I did not cook this recipe as is. I used it more as a guide to go by because I have a tendency to tweak almost everything that I cook. I cooked the ground beef per the directions but instead of chopped onion I just used onion powder (either one works-depends on preference) as well as salt and pepper to taste. Once I drained the ground beef I added one can of french styled green beans, one can of corn, one can of cream of celery soup, one can of cream of mushroom soup, and one (small-approx. 4 oz. jar) of sliced mushrooms. I heated it through and placed it in casserole dish (9x12). I used instant potatoes and mixed those per the box directions. Be warned, make plenty of potatoes (8+ servings worth for the 9x12 casserole dish). I layered the ground beef then the potatoes into the casserole dish and cooked at 350 degrees for 30 minutes. I omitted the cheese entirely. It turned out awesome! My fiance said it reminded him of the KFC bowl but was even better :)

Great and easy! My husband hated shepherd s pie and I didn't make it for several years. I saw this and decided to give it a go. When he heard what was for supper he was disappointed but when he ate it he even commented it was so good! He even asked for the leftovers the next day. Thanks for sharing!  I did use fresh mushrooms mixed in with the beef and mushrooms and frozen corn in place of the green beans. The cheese was a nice touch.

Making this for the second time tonight. Very simple and it tastes great. I seasoned my beef and made the mashed potatoes "garlic" with garlic powder. Such an easy dish when you need to throw dinner together in a hurry. Everything this dish needs are things I always keep on hand.

Yummy. I used frozen corn and instead of ground beef I used Johnsonville® Italian Mild Sausage Links. It was a great addition and added a little more flavor to the dish.

The basic recipe is a good base to make a few changes. As ratings indicated that it needed more spice.  I added spices including garlic to the meat, as well as the potatoes.  I also fried up some sliced mushrooms with beef bouillon and added that to the mixture.  I only used half can of mushroom soup and it was moist enough.  All around it was a success and my family loved it.

Tried this last night for dinner and everyone thought it was a keeper. My only change was adding a teaspoon of oregano to the meat mixture and added a 1/4 cup of cheese to the mashed potatoes. This is a good recipe as is and could be used as a base for a variety of flavors. My sister thought it would be good to use bbq sauce instead of the soup, instead of green beans use corn but layer it on top of meat mixture then layer cheese and potatoes.

This is a good basic recipe. However, the meat needs a little seasoning. I personally recommend the seasoning blend from Papadooka's homeade beef sausage (It's on this site). It's perfect with this if you  omit the brown sugar and salt, I even used vegan beef substitute and my family loves the stuff. I also changed out the green beans for corn instead. The texture was much better.

Like most cooks, I tweaked the recipe a little here and there to suit my tastes, but the recipe is well portioned and easy to follow.  My very fussy children even asked for seconds!  I made it ahead and then used the program feature on my oven to heat it thru while we were at ice skating practice--coming home to this piping hot is wonderful!

Very easy recipe.I rated it a 4 because I too made changes. I used what I had in my house. That included ground turkey, a can of mixed veggies, I didn't have cream of mushroom so I used cream of celery. It seemed to give it more flavor. Also, I used fresh garlic, onions, adobe seasoning and Colby chesse. It was a hit in my household.

I did this the easy way, using pre-seasoned ground beef, canned green beans, shredded carrots, fresh peas and mushrooms. I also used cream of garlic mushroom soup and packaged mashed potatoes. Topped it with chopped fresh chives and cheddar cheese(last 5 minutes. Because I took some shortcuts, it only needed to cook 20 minutes rather then 30 as mentioned in this version, and still delicious!

This was great!  I used homemade mashed potatoes made with cream cheese and a little garlic.  I accidentally forgot to add the onion, so I sprinkled some french-fried onions on top during the last 5 minutes of cooking and it turned out wonderful.  The whole family loved it & I will definitely make again.

First time making or eating this and my whole family loved it! The only change I made was I added Garlic powder to the meat while it was browning.

Loved this. I used corn as my kids don't really care for beans. I also added a clove of garlic to the water for the potatoes and mashed it right in. The mushroom soup in the meat mixture added lots of flavour. Have added this recipe to my offical family recipe book for quick meals.

Only things I suggest are seasoning the meat (original recipe was bland without seasoning), and add some more veggies. 

I added peas, carrots and mushrooms.

Otherwise very easy and tastes great.

I followed the recipe exactly and it tasted pretty good but 2 cups of mashed potatoes wasn't enough. I'm making it again, but with 4 cups this time.

This was just O.K. I added noodles and substituted the green beans (picky eaters dislike) for creamed corn. It lacked flavor for me, but it was an easy enough mid-week meal.

I didn't really care for the taste. I think it was the cream of mushroom. If I would have omitted that and added a can of diced ital tomatoes...I think it would have been much better. But I think that is more a personal taste sort of thing.

This was easy and my family loved it and they are picky eaters.  They ate the whole thing!  The only thing I did differently was add a little garlic and onion salt, and a dash of pepper.  I also forgot to put the cheese layer on so the cheese was mixed in and on top of the potatoes.

Great recipe, I made this with fresh green beans that I precooked. I also added some salt,pepper & Garlic.  I was surprised there was no seasoning.  I also used turkey burger since I didn't have beef, turned out great, invited neighbors and they wanted the recipe

I was hoping this recipe lived up to the 4 1/2 stars that it had received.  I should have known that it was going to be a bit bland.  I wasn't expecting it to be amazing considering the ingredients but for the ease of preparation, I thought it would be worth a try.  I followed the recipe with the exception of using ground turkey instead of beef because it was what I had on hand.  It was very easy to prepare but was a very boring recipe that was really lacking in flavor.  I will not make this again.

I gave this 4 stars bc i just love shepherds pie. This one isnt top on my list though. I prefer it made with gravy instead of the cream of mushroom soup.  Cook ground beef and onion, drain. Put in pan. I use 2 cans of veggies, mixed and green beans.  Pour gravy on top of veggies. Top with 4-6 cups of mashed potatos and then bake.  Yum..

This recipe is PERFECT and works well with many customizations and adaptations.  I've always kept the potato, veggie, and meat sections separate, but no real changes.  I've used beef, turkey, chicken, lamb...mashed potatoes, but also sliced/fried pots, and any veggie available, usually I choose a leftover...asparagus/green beans/Brussels sprouts/corn/peas.  Saute some mushrooms in a half butter/half olive oil mix and toss them in and WOW!  Easy weeknight dinner!!

Instead of beans and cream of mushroom soup, I add peas, 1 can of mushrooms, one envelope of taco seasoning and half the water called for on the envelope. Top with mashed potatoes and put cheese on top of the dish. Bake as directed 350 for 30 minutes

As a Cottage Pie, this probably deserves a 4-star for simplicity. But, this is not a review because I haven't made this particular recipe. Just want to point out that shepherds are people that look after sheep, therefore a Shepherds' Pie would normally be made from the meat of sheep, i.e., mutton or lamb. 
When made with beef it's a Cottage Pie.

This is exactly how I make my Shepherd's Pie, except I use lower sodium tomato soup in place of the mushroom soup. I think I may try it with the mushroom soup next time. Love it! And it makes a lovely presentation.

My mom has been making this as long as I can remember.  I make it now.  I brown the beef (and now I substitute ground turkey- I like it better).  Rinse and put back on.  Add any where between 1/2 and whole cup of cream of mush soup, onion, garlic, salt and pepper to taste.  Can of drained cut green beans.  Any other style will be yucky.  Put mashed taters on top, sprinkle with cheese, stick in oven until cheese is melted (about 10 mins).  That will make it a 5

This dish is similar to one I have made for years.  Instead of using cream of mushroom I use tomato soup with a lilttle teriaky or steak sauce along with several spices.  I also mound the potatoes in a ring form and leave an opening in the center, then sprinkle the cheese over the top which melts down into the beef mixture.  Very good...

Wonderful! And so very easy! My husband loved it! The only changes I made was I used a can of mixed veggies instead of only green beans and I left out the onion (because I didn't have one). I will be making this again tonight. Thanks for sharing!

Included a can of corn and left out the cheese, still turned out great and will be good as leftovers. Next time I would add veggies like onion & carrots-yum

I've had many variations of Shepard Pie and can't decide which one is best. I've had it with ground beef, lamb, with and without cheese, mixed vegetables or with peas and carrots, regular mashed potatoes or mashed sweet potato's as topping. I decided to go with the ground beef in this recipe and substituted the green beans with 8oz. bag of frozen diced carrots and petite peas, thawed. I left out the cheese, but will include it the next time. I browned the onion with the ground beef and fixed according to the recipe, including the mashed potatoes as topping. I also liked the idea of using garlic seasoning into the ground beef mixture. I'll give that a try next time. It makes a good stick to the ribs type casserole and worth every step.

I used this basic recipe and added a few ingredients of my own.  I used cut broccoli instead of green beans, my own homemade powdered soup mix instead of cream of mushroom soup,  and Kraft Sweet & Sour Chipotle BBQ sauce.  My family LOVED it!

Awesome and easy recipe!  I have tried many different recipes, but this is the only one that the WHOLE family loved!  Only thing I changed was that I added some garlic to the beef while frying with the onions.  Thank you for making the whole family happy!

I followed the recipe but doubled it, and did one can corn and one can green beans.  LOVED IT!  Tasted great and I had absolutely no issues getting the kids to eat it either! Will be making this again for sure.

add salt, pepper, ceyenne pepper, garlic powder and steak seasoning to the hamburger.  Saute the onions with some mushrooms otherwise it is extremely bland.

great recipe!  I had to omit a few important ingredients though due to having a very fussy 6 year old...I left out the onion, but added 1/2 a package of onion soup mix, left out the green beans, but added frozen corn.  Instead of the mushroom soup, I added a cup of beef broth and some worchesire sauce.  My son loved it with the cheesy mashed potatoes melted on top!, to me it was quite bland but that was o.k. I just added some salt to my dish and a little bit of Kechup!  Usually I would add little cubes of cut up carrot, I will add them next time....nice, easy home cooked meal, and very filling.

This was a very easy recipe for sheperd's pie, and it came out great.

I changed a lil things based on what i had in my house,  so i used 1/2 lb ground sausage, and 1/2 ground beef, i used frozen mixed veggies, and half of a fresh onion. I also had the garlic roasted cream of mushroom by cambells, I definitely like the idea of using cream of mushroom soup. This was a very tasty dish, temp and cooking times are perfect!

This recipe is yummy and easy to make but of course I made it my own way! I made gravy with the drippings from the ground beef instead of using mushroom soup. I put provolone cheese on top of the pie crust i laid out on the bottom of the pan. I used lots of seasonings like cayenne pepper, minced garlic, garlic powder and garlic salt. I used Peas and carrots and lots of cheddar cheese. Plus I used red potatoes because they have lots of flavor.

This is an awesome 'basic' recipe for Shepherd Pie. After seeing I had no sauce for Spaghetti, I needed something to use up the ingrediants I'd already prepared. My BF loves lots of spice so I added quite a bit to this recipe. I'd already sauteed mushrooms with garlic and onion so I threw that in there as well. I always use ground turkey in place of beef because I feel it holds flavors much better. Reached for Cream of Mushroom and saw I only had Cream of Chicken so I used that and mixed in about a tablespoon of regular old brown gravy mix I had in the cabinent. Used prepared mashed 'taters and threw it in the oven. My BF couldn't stop raving. I kind of completely changed the recipe but it was a terrific base to give me a jumping off point! Thank you!

this was pretty good.  i haven't made shepherd pie in a very long time.  i did however make my own changes, i sauteed the onion with the ground beef along with garlic and added salt and pepper.  i also made homemade sour cream mashed potatoes with cheddar and jalapenos for a little kick and spread those on top.  thanks for reminding me how good shepherds pie is.

I gorged myself on this!  Didn't measure the cheese, so there was probably extra.  I added some to the meat mixture as well as on top.  Also, had no fresh onion so I used dried onions.  YUM!  Will be using this every time we have leftover potatoes!

This is my first time making Shepherd's Pie and it turned out great. My husband loved it. This recipe gets 5 star for using a simple list of ingredients and really quick to put together. After seeing some of the recommendations made in the reviews, I did seasoned the beef for a couple of hours for taste using whatever I have suitable for beef (garlic powder, onion powder, steak spice, small bit of worchestershire sauce, chicken bouillion, sugar, white pepper, paprika), whatever you find suitable for your taste. I also didn't have peas so I put in broccoli florets pieces and used 5 med potatoes for mashed potatoes. Again, great recipe, thanks for posting this. I will definitely try making it again.

OK I do not normally review any recipes except for my own personal references but I have to say this is Delicious. The only thing I did differently was mix about 1/4 cup of cheddar cheese into the potatoes as well otherwise I followed directions exactly!!! These were the bomb! They are now a weekly meal if not biweekly meal in my house. The only one who didn't like them was my One year old and it is the ground beef texture thing. He wont eat any ground beef in any form so not the recipes fault!  I am positive one day he will grow to love them too. I actually have made this a few times already and have been planning to take the time to review it. It is just as good with steamed frozen green beans or canned. It doesn't matter!

This was delicious. I gave it 4 because I used some suggestions from other reviewers. I like corn and peas so added those and used 1.5 cups cheese. I browned the beef with the onions and 1 T minced garlic then drained the fat and added, 1 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp pepper and 1 tsp garlic powder, the soup and veggies and put it all in a greased 9x13 pan, added the cheese then topped with the mashed potatoes. Really easy. It is a keeper.

This was great.  Instead of a can of green beans, I did ~ 14 oz of a combination of frozen peas and corn.  I increased the cheese to 1.5 cups.  For the mashed potatoes I did instant for 6-7 people (2 2/3 cup of potato spuds).  It made more than 2 cups, but it works great.

I chose to make this recipe for Shepard Pie because there was not much time needed for preparation. It was OKAY. If you have a little extra time to spare try the recipe for Sheperd's Pie VI listed in ==on this site. It is much better. Even my husband noticed a big difference in the flavor and knew I hadn't made the same one. He practically ate the whole thing.

This dish is fabulous! I read the reviews & the only change I made was to add the onion after the ground beef started cooking & seasoned it with Lowry's Season Salt, Pepper, & garlic powder. I also made homemade mashed potatoes. It wasn't the least bit bland & my husband LOVED it! I think next time I may add some green pepper too. So easy & tasty.

ive never had shepards pie and never made it- but it was my husbands request so i did. it was alright- i added extra spices to the ground beef and made the gravy using beef broth. i also added beef onion seasoning packet to my mashed potatos and topped with cheese. it was good- but i dont think im much of a shepards pie fan.

I've made this a few times now, and it's amazing. I added some cumin and minced garlic to the ground beef mix the last time, and I thought it turned out pretty well. It's easily customizable to fit an individual's taste.

The cheese makes this SO good! I am not sure I like the mushroom taste with this so next time I might try another condensed soup variety. Thank you for sharing this! I will make it again!

OMG! So delicious! I made the BBQ version and I can't wait to have it again. I used mixed veggies instead of green beans. This is a great way to get my 20 mos old (who's on a veggie strike) to eat her vegetables. My rating is 5 stars. My toddlers rating... "YUM!"

Good base for recipe but as mushroom soup is ok to use, try a nice hearty beef gravy ixed ith veggies and ground beef instead....season nicely and generously and good amount of mashed potatoes but not too much to overpower rest of flavours.....nice winter meal....plenty of cheese layered over meat mixture and under potatoes....nice...

We love this easy recipe!  The only thing I change is adding a half T garlic salt and cheese on the meat mixture as well as a light layer on top to look a little nicer.  We double it for our family to fit in a 9x13 pan and with us and 4 young kids under 10 we almost finish it in one shot!  Thanks for sharing Steff!

It is a very easy meal, although not much different than the tater tot hotdish i make.   Just mashed potatoes intead of tater tots.  Either way, it got eaten up, kids loved it.  I added cream cheese to mashed potatos, and ate it with sour cream. Just to change it up from my tater tot hotdish.

I made this but substituted a can of mixed vegies for the green beans. I also added 1/2 cup of sour cream to the soup mixture and seasoned the meat with fresh garlic and season salt. This was easy and good.

Great recipe, instead of ground beef I used left over ham and cream of celery instead of mushroom soup.   We had it for dinner, family loved it. I like this recipe's versatility.

This recipe is definitely a keeper.  I would definitely use home made mashed potatoes.  That is what really made it great for me.  I just used butter, salt, pepper, milk, and sour cream for my mashed potatoes.

Good recipe! Changes I made: Add corn and sliced carrots, used Bob Evans microwavable mashed taters, neglected the cream of mushroom soup, and broiled for 10 minutes vice baked 30 min.  Came out delicious!

I've made Shepherd's Pie before (without a recipe - just trying to replicate someone else), but this was the best. I realized after I'd decided to make it that I didn't have cream of mushroom so I used cream of chicken. And I also realized I was out of green beans, so I used corn. I also added a few diced peppers to the hamburger meat while browning it. I diced the peppers and onions very tiny so that my kids wouldn't see them. I will definitely make it again, and I will try it with the green beans next time. Awesome family-friendly recipe.

We love this recipe!  I did change the soup I used to Tomato (I am allergic to mushrooms - and it seemed more like I remember anyway).  Everyone loves this dish - it is such a comfort food.

The answer to every recipe on here seems to be cream of mushroom soup.. my husband and I think it's gross so I substituted a can of veggie soup.  That covered the vegetable portion of the recipe as well. Add some more spices to your meat and you are good to go!

There's nothing like comfort food.  What a great recipe.  Even my four year old loved it and asked for seconds!  Cooked the meat with onion and added fresh garlic along with pepper, bay leaf, paprika and a bit of ground thyme and a pinch of ground red pepper.  the spices gave the meat a nice flavor.  This recipe has instantly become a family favorite.  Thanks for sharing.

Good & easy recipe. Thanks for sharing!  I didn't have any onions, so I used onion soup mix (half a package)...and it was really good. I threw some canned green beans & corn in....stirred a little cheese into the potatoes. Good stuff.

This was a hit! I did make changes... I used a packet of dried onion soup mix, 2 cans of cream of celery instead of the mushroom.  Used 1/2 can of green beans (not a fan) and a full can of sweet corn.  Loved it!! will probably play around with it a tad more next time I make it.

I followed the directions and this was really very good! My husband and I really enjoyed it. It's great comfort food. My daughter does not like onions, so she picked them out. I think the onions were necessary to give it some zing.

My husband and I had been watching a television show featuring shepherd's pie and we had never tried it. We figured we could give a try and saw this recipe. To my surprise this turned out really well. The surprise was based on my general dislike of cream of mushroom, but this turned out really well. I added garlic to the potatoes and the sauteed the meat with garlic as well. I also added carrots. Very good recipe. My husband and I both had it again for lunch today. Mmmm!

Yes, good recipe, but I gave it a 4 because I too made some changes.  I used blanched fresh green beans, and sauteed the onions and fresh mushrooms with the ground beef.  I added some cheddar cheese to the mashed potatoes.  I also put some garlic powder in the meat mixture, next time I'll use fresh.  Two of us ate the whole thing ! Thank you !

My whole family liked this recipe.  In order for the kids to get more veggies I added another can of green beans & another cup of mashed potatoes.  Definitely thought adding salt & pepper to the ground beef gave it a little more taste.  Next time I may try adding tomato soup instead of mushroom just for a change.  Yummy as leftovers too.

Very good!  I added a container of sliced mushrooms to the meat mixture and used dried onion flakes instead of fresh (I was tired).  I also used 2C. of cheddar and pre-made mashers from the grocery.  Such good food, such little effort!

I make this dish often, the soup was a new spin to me I use 1 to 1 1/2 lbs ground beef 1/2 can of drained  sweet corn and 1/2 can of rotel gives it a nice kick I accidently opened golden mushroom soup went with it, turned out very good however I only used 1/2 a can also add lots of garlic and carmalize the onion. Added a splash of buttermilk and 2 dollops of sourcream to the potatoes. Sprinkled maybe a 1/4 cup of cheddar on top trying to kinda watch the colesterol kids and hubby loved it thanks for the insperation.

YUMMY! My husband and I both really likes this. I accidentally bought a cream of mushroom and chicken soup instead of just the cream of mushroom, but it still was delicious! I'm not a huge fan of canned vegetables, so next time I think I'll use fresh.

Very good, easy recipe that even I can make haha.  I did make some changes though.  Instead of ground beef I used ground turkey, instead of cheddar cheese I used 2% american cheese, and I also used red potatoes for the mash and mixed veggies.  It still came out great and I would make this again definitely.

Pretty good!!! I substituted the reg potatoes for red potatoes and left the skin on when i mashed them. I added a tablespoon of butter, 1/4 cup of milk and 2 teaspoons of veggie broth to give them a flavor. I also substituted the beans for a can of corn. I cooked the meat with some onion and garlic. It was absolutely AWESOME. Will make this again for sure!!

Good, simple to prepare (if you have leftover mashed potatoes) and pretty kid-friendly.  I cooked the onions with the ground beef so they wouldn't be crunchy, and added salt and pepper.  The dish turned out okay, just a bit bland.

I rated this recipe as it is almost exactly how I have always made shepherd's pie, except I used tomato soup and usually mixed vegetables but you can use any vegetable.  I mix the onion with the ground beef and now since I can't eat tomato soup and don't like cream of mushroom soup.  I just make a gravy with the ground beef and onion instead of soup.  It is every bit as delicious.  You can spice it up if you like and even add some mushrooms.

This was fantastic for how easy it was to make.  I used fake mashed potatoes and added some asiago cheese.  The cheddar also had some taco seasoning in it, because it was a bagged taco cheddar blend.  It is sooo yummy, though.

Really, really good!  I added diced carrots and a can of corn to the mix.  I will definitely make this again!  We had leftovers two nights - so makes a good amount.
