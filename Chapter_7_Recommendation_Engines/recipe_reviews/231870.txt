Delicious...used regular fettuccini, and fresh spinach, and cheese on hand.....but it turned out very good, and rich. Had leftovers, which were also very good.

Just made and ate this recipe - amazing and super easy. The only alterations I made:

1. I added sea salt with herbs de provence to the sauce
2. My grocery store does not sell spinach fettucini so I used tri-color rotini

I will definitely make this recipe again and might use fresh spinach instead of frozen. Empty plates all around!

This recipe, made exactly like directions, is way too bland for me.  I added some Panko bread crumbs on top, but I think the previous reviewer's idea of sea salt with Italian seasonings would do the trick. Definitely needs some zip.  It is somewhat time consuming to make and I also gained a pound each night I ate it.  Will probably make a simpler flounder recipe next time.

My husband and I liked this but I had to make changes based on the ingredients I had on hand. I didn't have spinach fettuccine,so I used thin spaghetti. I also had to substitute using curry powder as I had no nutmeg,and I used a shredded Swiss and Gruyere blend of cheese. I will make again! It was tasty! :)

Came out great. Usually make Florentines by just putting fish or chicken on top of frozen spinach and topping with bread crumbs and cheese. Then you have to make a side. Loved making the sauce and pasta all together. Used 4 cheese Italian blend and rotini bc that's what I had on hand. Also a little more butter a little less milk. Because mmmm butter. Came out so yummy!
