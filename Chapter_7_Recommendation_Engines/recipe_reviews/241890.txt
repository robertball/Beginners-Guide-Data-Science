Grilled Chicken Marinade Haiku: "I LOVE grilled chicken, will try any marinade. And this one was yum!" Even though I sample as many different recipes for marinating chicken, I usually end up falling back on AR's "Pretty Chicken Marinade", but I liked this one almost as much. For not having to chop anything, and for typically having these ingredients on hand, it was easy and the end result chicken was flavorful w/o screaming "herbs!" or "soy sauce!"

Excellent!  I had one chicken breast left over from our previous dinner, so I grilled this one as written with the exception that I didn't slice the chicken.  I'd think that had I thinly sliced the chicken and cooked it for that long on each side that it'd have been way overcooked.  As it was, this was wonderful!  This time I cut the recipe to 1 serving, but I almost wish I had a little more marinade that I could save off before adding the chicken so that I could drizzle it over some of the side dishes.  I'll do that next time.  You don't need to change a thing in the proportions of this recipe!  Thanks, Jennifer!

This was delicious. I didn't have red wine vinegar so I used cider vinegar instead.  I eyeballed the spices vice measuring them.  This recipe seems like a very forgiving marinade.  I used it on chicken and marinaded for approx 7 hrs.  The chicken was tender and moist.I highly recommend this recipe.

This is so delicious!! This is my first time cooking with red wine vinegar and I’m not gonna lie, I was nervous about using it after smelling it. But after mixing all of the ingredients together, I could tell this was going to be good. I cut the recipe in half and marinated two thin sliced chicken breasts in a zip loc bag in the fridge for about 15 hours, then I baked them at 400° F for about 20 minutes. The chicken is so soft and flavorful! I can’t wait to try this on a steak too. Thank you so much for sharing! I’ll definitely be using this a lot.

Completely exceeded my expectations. I usually feel like marinades just burn off during cooking and you end up with bland chicken. Not this one! Great flavor after grilling and very juicy! I let it marinate for about 4.5 hours. Also, I didn't have low sodium soy sauce, so I used slightly less than called for of the regular stuff (just added a teensy bit more vinegar instead) and it wasn't too salty at all. Don't be put off by the soy sauce taste if you try the marinade when you first mix it up, the finished product tastes wonderful!

I was looking for the recipe that was used at a resturant I used to work at.  The chicken salad was delicious, and sometimes us employees would put it with cheese between two tortillas!  It was heaven!!  The resturant recipe did also have paprika, which was wonderful for the appeal of the appearance.  And they also used some cayenne pepper and lemon pepper.  I don't dare to say the amounts, as then we were doing a 20 lb batch at a time.    and obviously you have to be careful with the ratio of those last two ingredients.    We would put a large steamer pan upside down over a mound of marinated chicken when cooking to seal in the flavor and the moisture!  turned often and not overcooked.

Doubled this recipe for 12 bone in thighs. Easy to measure into a jar then shake well to blend. I saved a small bit to drizzle over grill baskets of vegetables. Thank you Jennifer for a wonderful recipe!

Wow what a great recipe.  Made exactly as written.  Allowed the chicken to marinate for about 6 hours before doing in the oven.  LOL did over cook the breasts but I did find the centre was moist and full of flavour.  Will be doing again.  Thank you Jennifer for such a wonderful recipe.

This was ok but I’m astonished at the five star reviews.  I found it bland.  At least the leftovers will be easy to use since the flavor isn’t very strong. I did change it a bit, mostly to add a little more flavor after I tasted the marinade. I doubled the garlic and added a touch of onion powder.  I didn’t have parsley, but I’m not that fond of it, so I did increase the basil and oregano slightly.  I guess if you had strong tasting sides it would be a good mild addition.

I hate when people give 5 s then tell how they change it. However, I am going to do just that. There is a video on AR about grilling chicken I have used for years. That recipe calls to add Apple Cider vinegar and honey. It also tells you to boil the marinade for at least 2 min and use it to baste the chicken while grilling. So with that being said, use this recipe, add apple cider vinegar, and honey, then boil marinade and use to baste. I have actually started using the boiling trick for most all of my grilled meats. Thanks for the recipe and the tips AR!!

This is my new go-to marinade and not just for chicken, it also works well on pork.

I used tamari instead of soy sauce. On my second attempt, I was out of both white and red wine vinegar so I  used apple cider vinegar. The results were every bit as good.

Thank you for this recipe

I will now never grill chicken without marinating it with this recipe! I was shocked just how good it is. I used red wine in place of red wine vinegar but followed the recipe otherwise and I can best explain the taste by this, you know when you get out of your car at your favorite steakhouse and that glorious smell that makes you even hungrier that’s how the chicken tastes honestly the best marinade I’ve ever used and now the only way to grill chicken at this house!

Loved reading many of the reviews here - they sold me on giving this a try. Oh my, we were not disappointed! So quick and easy to prepare, and it makes lots - save some for another meal like I did! I marinated more chicken the very next day again, to satisfy our cravings for more of this delicious flavor! Wow, try it exactly as the recipe states - you won't be disappointed!! :)

This is a great marinade! Made it just as the recipe is written, except I doubled it for a bigger batch of chicken. Marinaded for about 6 hours then it all went on the grill. Chicken was beautiful and moist with a great flavor! Didn't even want to use any BBQ sauce or anything else. Will definitely use again.

This is an easy recipe to make and the outcome is super flavorful! It really makes the chicken moist and yummy! No preservatives and all items you would have in your cupboards! I will use it again and again. I think they say 4 hours to marinate but that seems way too long. We did 30 minutes one time and 2 hours the next time. Turned out so tasty and everyone loved the flavor.

I didn't have red wine vinegar so I used half  balsamic vinegar  and  half apple cider vinegar instead. My very critical MIL had nothing bad to say and my super picky 2 yr old ate it up! Husband and the other kids loved it too.  We had none leftover. Will definitely make this again.

Great because it was tasty and super simple!
The second time around, I added seasoned salt , a touch more pepper, and a little green tabasco for a little extra  - still fabulous! I also used boneless, skinless thighs, as I don't care much for the breasts.

I saved a bit of this marinade in a separate container before I marinated the chicken and after 4 hours marination I wrapped the chicken in foil, adding in a good coating of fresh marinade before sealing the wrapping.

I then baked the humongous chicken breast in the oven at 350 for 25 to 30 minutes.

Top it with some fresh avocado, diced tomatoes and just a few thin slices of philidelphia cream cheese... Oh my wow.

Talk about rich, tangy and GOOD!

Utilized this recipe today using chicken tenders. One of the best marinades I have ever found for chicken. Whole family enjoyed them. Simple to use.

I actually soaked the chicken in the marinade for over 24 hours and then grilled it. Turned out great. Flavor had soaked into the meat and it was very juicy.

This was very good.  Sometimes the marinade is too strong and overpowering, but this wasn't.  I was only able to marinade it for 30 minutes and it was fine.

I did this X4 for a large party with drumsticks and boneless chicken thighs. It marinaded for about 90 minutes before grilling. Chicken was wonderful and flavorful.  I had to sub about half of the red wine vinegar with white wine vinegar because I ran out of the red. It was still delicious. The only change I'd make for next time is to get the full 4 hour marinade time in!

This was so delicious! I didn't notice that the marinade time was supposed to be 4 hours until after I made it and put in the chicken. I marinated it for about an hour and a half and it was still really tasty. I imagine it would be so much better if I planned better! I think it would be good with steak too!

I have made this marinade many times for different cuts of chicken. Let me tell you, it is fantastic on leg quarters on the grill. I go to this marinade often and have changed up the amounts of red wine vinegar and herbs. It’s a great base recipe for a chicken marinade. Thanks for a great recipe!

The best chicken marinade out there.  There are a lot of ingredients but they are fairly common ones.  I make it up in fairly large batches to use in 2 or 3 dinners.  Don’t skimp on the marinading time - makes the chicken juicy.

I made this last Sunday evening for us, my daughter, son-in-law and my almost two-year old grandson. IMO, it is quite a  good mariande. I used a robust first-pressed olive oil, high-quality red wine vinegar,  dried herbs, and let marinate for about six hours. I also used boneless and skinless chicken thighs and a few breasts. The thighs came out great, the breasts were a little less flavorful.  I will make it again, but next time I will add some smoked parika for a tad more bite.

I used skinless bone in thighs for this and increased the oregano and garlic powder just a bit. I will use this marinade again. It had a good flavor.

This was an amazing marinade for a nice summer BBQ. I loved the different tones of the spices and the  the sweetness from the brown sugar. I’ll definitely be using this again.

I was generous with the garlic but I didn't really make any other changes.  We pounded chicken breast fillets and took the marinated breasts to a family function where they were grilled.  Four minutes per side.  Wow!  They were tender, flavorful, not too too anything.  We'll make this again and again!

I loved this marinade because it gave the chicken a lot of flavor without overpowering the other ingredients in the recipe I was following.  I grilled the marinated chicken and then cut into cubes for a salad that also contained apples, pecans, red pepper, celery and green onions.  The marinade worked very well  for this recipe.  The chicken was also delicious by itself.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks, Jennifer!

I've done this twice on chicken thighs with a side of kale salad and it's been a huge hit! I love how quickly I can whip it up. It makes a lovely dish with minimal work. A total win for a busy mom!

I didn't have the red wine vinegar or parsley flakes. I also substituted the low sodium soy sauce for soy aminos. It was a little salty but I liked the flavor! This is one I will definitely be making again!

Really easy and really simple.  Good marinade for a basic recipe. Not sure how well it would do on an outdoor grill, but on an indoor grill, it was very good.

Marinated for about 6 hours. I think it's the soy sauce that causes the chicken to come out mushy. Same kind of thing happens when marinating with citrus for too long.  I guess I don't like soy that much. Still trying to find that "go to" seasoning for grilled chicken tenders as a salad topper. So far just oil, salt and pepper seems about the best.

Great flavor and super simple! Chicken will not stick to grill; due to very strict sodium restriction, replaced the soy sauce with coconut aminos, cuts sodium by more than half of low sodium soy.

Yum!  Loved this, and so did some picky eaters at the dinner table.   Flavourful, but does not confine the meal to a specific flavour profile.   I decreased soy sauce slightly to suit my personal preference.   White wine vinegar would work as well.

Good recipe.  I modified a bit, used a combination of cider vinegar and balsamic instead of just red wine.  Also, I used  thighs and drumsticks.   Boneless breast, really?   If you like dry white meat, by all means go right ahead.  All in all, good flavor and I would make this again.  One word of caution, for some reason, not sure if was the chicken or the marrinaid but the grill smoked like an sob when I put the chickwn on the grates.

Made per recipe with boneless, skinless chicken thighs and used  apple cider vinegar since that's what I had on hand.  Turned out so moist and so flavorful.  Family loved it. My 7 year old boy ate 3 chicken thighs!  I marinated overnight.

10.24.16  I got sidetracked for dinner over the weekend, and this actually ended up marinating in the fridge for well over a day.  Not to worry because it still grilled up beautifully and tasted great!  Not quite sure why the ingredient listing says to thinly slice the chicken breast before grilling (??), but I grilled and served mine whole.  Have enough of one breast left over for a tasty luncheon salad today.  Excellent marinade with ingredients I always have on hand, and so simple to mix together.  This one’s a keeper.

Very yummy! I try to marinade for at least a half an hour and it turns out tasty. I have made it twice now and the only substitutions I made were using Apple Cider Vinegar.

Even the severely picky 13yr old boy ate it and then some. He normally can't eat anything that looks like it has 'seasoning' in it. We all enjoyed it.

This was a very flavorful and great smelling marinade. Th three of us all loved it and my husband said to remember this marinade and make it in the future. I didn't change anything, it marinaded for 10 hours and then he grilled it. Perfect, tender, juicy. Thank you for the recipe.

This was really good. I was only able to marinade the chicken for 2 hours and I WAY  over-cooked it (my fault, not the recipe), and the chicken still turned out wonderful.

Even before the chicken came off the grill, the smell was wonderful. And it tasted even better! I made the marinade exactly as written. I left it overnight, pulling it out to come close to room temp before putting it on the grill. Next time, I'm going to add bbq sauce or hot sauce for a kick. This is definitely my new go-to marinade!

This marinade was absolutely delicious & I was only able to marinate the chicken for 2 hours so I can only imagine if it marinated longer..I copied the recipe to a tee and the chicken came out super juicy & perfect in every way!

I'm never grilling naked chicken breasts again!  LOVE this.

I didn't have any parsley so I skipped it.  I also made a big batch to keep in the fridge for future meals.  DELISH!

I have used this recipe as a base several times now, but have tweaked for my own needs.  This is the first time I have made my own marinade and was a very tasty meal.  I prefer to make my own things so I can have a little control over what I eat.  Great recipe!

I've never felt compelled to write a review on anything until this marinade. It was phenomenal. The only things I did differently were to increase the garlic powder to 1/2 tsp, add 1/4 tsp onion powder and a dash of rosemary and paprika. I marinated 3 good size chicken breasts and then cooked them on my cast iron grill pan 6 minutes each side and transferred it to my oven at 375° for 20 minutes. The flavor was perfect and the house smelled amazing while it cooked. I wish I had followed the recipes suggestion to cut the breasts in half because the thinner parts of my whole cooked chicken breasts had a lot more flavor than the thicker portions. Next time I will definitely cut them in half. I plan to double the recipe and bring some marinated chicken for our next camping trip. Two thumbs up!

Very tasty - only had time to marinate for 2 hours but chicken had lots of flavor.  May try Italian seasoning instead of parsley next time.  Thanks for a great recipe with all ingredients on hand.

Great marinade. I added 1/2 tbsp of Ancho chili powder for more kick.

This was so easy and exactly what I was looking for. I used it with a package of chicken tender strips and it was so easy and flavorful!

Simple and delicious. Probably would've been even better if I had cut my chicken up before marinating (my chicken breasts were very thick). Turned the chicken into grilled chicken skewers with yellow onion, green pepper, and fresh garlic cloves. Served with white rice. They were gone in less than ten minutes.

Outstanding marinade!  I've made this several times, my family and friends love it.  This is my sister's favorite and she raves about it.  I'm going to make it for her this week.  I think I'll serve it with roasted veggies and baked sweet potatoes.  Thank you for sharing this, Jennifer!

Mmmmm so good. I used Italian seasoning instead of parsley, since I didn't have any, turned out amazing!

this came out really good.. i used the marinade on one extra large chicken breast (1 lb 2 oz) that i cut up into four steak size pieces.. i had to sub apple cider vinegar for the red wine vinegar b/c i'm out.. also used maybe a fourth of the oil.. marinated for 3 hours and it was very flavorful.. ty for a good simple recipe. ~~UPDATE: i use this recipe often bc of how quick and easy it is.. when i have time i swap out the dried parsley for fresh cilantro and use fresh garlic for the powder.. i now use regular soy sauce instead of the low sodium.. but that's just a personal preference.. i'm sure this would go great on pork.. ty again!
