Wonderful , flavorful, goodness. I used mahatma "spicy" yellow rice, so I left out the jalapeno.  I over did the thyme a bit,( my fault I got over zealous with the spices, I used fresh thyme and rosemary) but  it was still phenomenal. I cooked the whole dinner in one big skillet. Cooked the pork chops (didn't use  chicken) in the skillet , put them aside , cooked the veggies til soft then threw in the herb/spices for a few minutes then added the rice with the seasoning packet and the water , covered for ten minutes added pork chops  and peas then covered for another 15 minutes.....perfection in a pan!! Don't omit the cloves in fact all the spices work together for a wonderful combo and don't omit the squeeze of lemon at the end it adds a freshness and flavor thats delish. If your'e not used to using these herbs give this a try , it will make a believer out of you.

I made a more mild version of this, but it was still wonderful.

This is pretty good but I think a different sauce is needed.  Chili sauce is ok but my husband thought that maybe a green sauce would actually be better.  Will probably try again with changes.

This was easy to fix and tasted really good. I loved that I was able to fix it all in just 1 skillet. I didn't have the pork so I tossed in some bacon (it's just cured pork) for the flavor. I used dried onion and herbs instead of fresh and we skipped the jalapeno and chile at end. I used boneless chicken and sprinkled it with some Season All before cooking it. I only used a pinch of clove since DH doesn't like it and I forgot to squeeze the lemon over. Thanks, I'll fix this again.

Oh my, my!  My family gave this a rating of 10 stars!  I made this with just the chops. I didn't use cloves (didn't have any) and I used dried rosemary & thyme.  I also used Trader Joe's Melange a Tois julienned frozen bell peppers and frozen peas.  For the rice I used Zatarain's Yellow Rice.  I omitted the jalapenos & chili sauce and forgot to squeeze lemon over the dish!  It didn't matter - this dish was so flavorful I cannot wait to make it again!  Thank you!
