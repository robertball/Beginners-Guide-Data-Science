FANTASTIC!  Granted, I made several modifications, but this was an easy dinner recipe that looks like it takes far longer to prepare.  I used Nasoya extra firm tofu cubes, which I drained in a towel inside a colander for about 2 hours to make sure that the tofu was dry before frying.  I had some shallots that I substituted for the onion and used extra garlic.  Then I added the curry powder (3 tsp.) and 1 1/2 heaping tsp. of green curry paste and let it cook for about a minute on the stove before adding the coconut milk and stirring before adding the tofu, one head of cauliflower cut into florets, and a package of cut butternut squash from the produce section.  Lastly, I added 2 pieces of lemongrass that I bruised first and then cut into about 4 inch sections.  I put the cover on it and let it cook until the squash and cauliflower were cooked, but not mushy and then added the cilantro -- an entire bunch of cilantro chopped.  Served over white rice and my house smelled super fantastic.  Definitely a keeper and I will make it again.

I made this dish for the second time tonight and it turned out great. The first time I made it I followed the recipe without modifications, and it turned out salty and bland. This time I fried the tofu with garlic and ginger. I also added one chopped jalopeno, extra garlic, some red crushed pepper, ginger, portobello mushrooms, carrots, and green beans. It was wonderful.

Delicious! This was perfect. I followed the recipe as it was printed (except my can of milk was 13.5oz.) and both my husband and I loved it. This was simple and ingredients are usually on hand in this house. I will make it again. 

Attn readers: This is not a spicy dish, if your in a spicy mood, try a red curry. This is very creamy and smooth and mild and delicious!

This was my first successful meal with tofu.  I pressed it by putting a plate with two cans on top for about 15 minutes, and then fried it with LOTS of oil.  The rest of the dish was pretty easy, but too mild by itself.  I added half of a habanero pepper, broccoli, cauliflower, green peppers, halved grape tomatoes, and some cayenne pepper and chili powder.  A 14-oz can of coconut milk provides enough sauce for the extra veggies.

Without the seasoned salt and with some vegetables, I'd rate this a 5. I left out the seasoned salt per other readers' advice and added frozen broccoli toward the end. I served over basmati rice and it was delicious. I think I also used vegetable oils only. (Side note: If you don't think you'd like tofu, buy Melissa's - I get it at Walmart Neighborhood Market - it's awesome!)

Very easy and simple to make! After the step of the onions/garlic I added in snow peas, carrots, red peppers, broccoli and mushrooms and sauteed them till they were tender but crisp. I then followed the rest of the steps, I added in half a spoon of paprika and more salt n' pep to taste, I also added in a spoon of thai chili sauce. It was nice and flavorful but my ultimate verdict is that it was a little too creamy for my taste, I'm not too big on creamy flavor, maybe I will add in water next time I make it. The rest of my family enjoyed it.

This was very good! We added more curry to taste and more cilantro. Sea salt to taste. Served over jasmine rice, tasted like we ordered it from a restaurant!

Made this for dinner tonight and it was GREAT. Everyone was really impressed with it.

My additions were:
Extra Curry Powder
Extra Salt
Extra Cilantro
Added brocccoli, cauliflower & baby carrots, could've used ever MORE veggies.
Served over oriental noodles
Sprinkled with Sri Racha Rooster Sauce.  

Totally awesome. I think 5 is only for PERFECT recipes which is why I give it a 3 - needed some modification.  Next time I will add some crushed red pepper I think.

I'm rating this based on a modified version. I added fresh carrots, broccoli and cauliflower towards the end of the simmer time. Other than this, I followed the recipe as directed. This was my first time frying tofu and it stuck to the pan, even with non-stick spray. Once everything was simmering, it looked and smelled wonderful. However, that's where it ended. Although I love curry, this dish was lacking in flavor and while I ate it, it received unfavorable opinions from my family. I won't make it again, sorry.

delicious sauce, goes well with the tofu. i will definitely make this again, but will add something to mix up the texture: almonds or cashews maybe, or bean sprouts.

Like the other reviewers I made many changes to the existing recipe, hence the 3 stars.  With my changes I thought it was quite fantastic however.  I fried the tofu, poured off any excess vegetable oil and then added 4 chopped cloves of garlic, half an onion, mushrooms, broccoli, red pepper flakes and 2 tablespoons chopped ginger.  After sauteing that until it was about half cooked I added 2 tablespoons of lemon pepper and the curry as well as salt and and 1 tsp of basil. I mixed that all together until the spices were fragrant (1-2 minutes) and then added the coconut milk and cooked for a few more minutes until the broccoli was tender. The cilantro I added just before removing the dish from the heat.  The lemon pepper I think did the trick, as it was excellent.

Great recipe! Very simple and easy to make. Perfect for a curry beginner. The only modifications I made was doubling the curry powder, reducing the tofu by half and adding mushrooms and eggplant. Yum.

I LOOOOOOVE this recipe! Absolutely Fantastic. I like to add a little kick of cayenne pepper, because the curry I have on hand is not very spicy. 
Just make sure you drain and dry the tofu very well, or else it will may be too watery, and you will have to let it simmer for way more than 15 minutes!

I appreciate the attempt at an international entry to allrecipes since I've noticed a lack of recipes from certain regions. That being said, like several reviewers noted, I found this recipe to be a bit bland. This might be good for an entry level into thai food and for those who can't handle spice, but if you are used to thai, it's going to underwhelm with the flavoring. 
I highly recommend doing as others suggested and adding vegetables of your choosing, I personally added diced red peppers, green peas, and dried red pepper.

This was very good. However, next time I will use less cilantro as it was a bit overpowering for me.  Also, I added 1/4 tsp. of red pepper flakes and 2 cups of stir fry veggies then served over rice.

I omit the seasoned salt and black pepper, preferring 1/2 Tablespoon Thai Chili Paste for a bit of spice.  I always use the full can of coconut milk (the smallest can they have where I shop is 14oz.), increase the cilantro, and throw in a head of cauliflower to bulk up the meal.

I like tofu and I like curry but I was not sure how they would taste together.  Very good, even my teenagers liked it.  The cilantro added a great flavor that suprised me as well.

Very easy to make and it tastes great! I noticed that there was a surprisingly high amount of fat in this recipe and it's source being the coconut milk. I experimented and used half the required amount and it still came out great. I added the tofu to rice for a more filling meal. Highly recommend!!

Excellent!

However, not having seasoned salt in the house, and only using it on salads anyway when I do, and not in cooking, I used 1.5 teaspoons 5 spice.

Portions are small ones, even when served on noodles or rice (I did noodles). But I guess we are better off that way...

This was fantastic.  The only thing I substituted was the salt.  I don't keep salt in the house, so instead I used Mrs. Dash on the tofu.  Other than that, I stuck to the recipe and it's one of the best meals I've made in awhile!  (And super easy/fast!!)

This was the first time I made tofu and curry, and it was sooo good and simple. Could have used some more kick to it, next time I will try using red curry powder or some jalapenos. My whole house smelled like delicious curry, and it was really good served over jasmine rice.

This would probably be good for a beginner cook or college student who isn't too familiar with the more exotic spices and flavors. It lacked depth. Maybe with some ginger, basil, lime, coriander...Probably won't make this again though.

Very simple to make! A few small changes: I didn't added salt when frying tofu. I added some water to make the sauce less thick. I also added pineapple and tomato for red curry taste.

This was amazing! I tweaked this a bit after reading some reviews. I added snow peas and mushrooms, omitted the cilantro, and only did 1 teaspoon of curry. I also fried the tofu in olive oil. I can't wait to try this again! I'm thinking I'll add water chestnuts and bamboo shoots.

My family and I love this recipe. I am giving it a 5-star rating, but I do make some changes. I use a little more coconut milk, and I substitute the tofu for chicken. Red pepper flakes are a perfect topping. This is a solid recipe, and very versatile.

i thought this was terribly bland.  i added in extra curry powder and fresh lemongrass, salt and even soy sauce out of desperation.  nothing would make this good!!!!!!!!!  i wouldn't have given it one star, but to rate a recipe i was required to.  tossing the rest in the trash.

I was reading a lot of the comments about this recipe, and after making it myself I came to the conclusion that the coconut milk overpowers the rest of the spices, hence why it comes out bland. I'll also note to future tofu cookers; Tofu is a very picky substance. It sticks very easily, but it also absorbs flavors easily as well. So when cooking it for the first time, use oil (Olive oil I find tastes best in the end) or cooking spray and cook on low heat  and turn regularly. Also factor in the type of range you're cooking on and the type of cookware you have (cheap, copper bottom, aluminum). The better quality your cookware (or the better it sustains even heat) the lower your cooking temp should be.

I made this and found it very salty.  I used curry paste in place of curry powder and added a little brown sugar to go with it.  I also served it over rice noodles.  the tofu fried itself in seasoning salt was tasty as just a snack or appetizer. Next time I will use less seasoning salt and add vegetables.

This is a delicious dish for those who enjoy curry. The creamy texture coupled with the mild curry flavor compliment one another beautifully. I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and added cauliflower, peas, and carrots. The snap of the peas was a nice addition to the creaminess, and the sweetness of the carrots blended well with the curry flavor. The cauliflower added some "bulk". Honestly, this recipe would not be as good without the "veg", in my humble opinion. I also added chili flakes while preparing the tofu, and doing so added some heat and kick to the tofu. All in all, if you like curry and tofu, this is great dish.

Very, very salty!!!  If I made this again, which I don't think I will, I would reduce the seasoned salt by at least half and not add the second amount of salt.  I tasted this near the end of cooking and added some chili powder and crushed red pepper flakes to try and counteract the saltiness, but to no avail.  Couldn't eat it.

This recipe was totally fantastic!  The only change I made was to increase the curry to two tablespoons.  This will become a recurring dinner for us.  I will also use this same recipe for chicken, shrimp and lamb.

This recipe is GREAT! I did a couple of things differently, but just minor. I lightly steamed some parsnips and fried those with the tofu along with some thinly sliced Serrano pepper.  I added the spices to the onion and garlic for a few minutes before adding the liquid. Also did about 50/50 coconut milk and veg broth. Last, I also added some fresh pineapple chunks with the liquids. My wife and kids thought the dish was divine, as did I! Smoky, silky, deliciousness!

For the recipe as it is I would probably give it 2/5 stars but making it with modifications I would give it 4.5/5. I added a jalapeño, doubled the garlic, added more curry powder, and broccoli.

Fabulous. I sauteed some snap peas, red pepper and green onions to make a more substantial dish. 1 TBS salt seemed too much to me, so I put 1 tsp and that was fine.

This recipe was a good base, but too bland for my liking as is.  I did use light coconut milk and it was a 13.5 oz. can.  I fried my tofu in peanut oil (be sure to press out the water first!) and, instead of seasoned salt, splashed several shakes of fish sauce and then a few shakes of each of the following: onion powder, garlic powder, paprika, celery seeds, coriander, fresh ground black pepper and cayenne.  Start light on the fish sauce and add to taste - I added a few more shakes later on to the sauce as it was simmering, but fish sauce is quite salty so go easy at first. After I added the coconut milk to the garlic and onion, I added two chopped, dried Thai chilies along with the cilantro and tofu. The chilies add a lot of spice and give a good amount of kick, but are probably too spicy for those who aren't into spicy food. Then I added 1 green and 1 red bell pepper and a mix of mushrooms.  I tossed in a couple handfuls of roasted, unsalted cashews a minute or two before serving.  Served over rice noodles and my husband and I loved it!

Great family recipe. Two of the three kids ate it!  Next time I'll hold back a bit on the seasoned salt.  My husband and I like a little more zing to a curry so we added red pepper flakes at the table. A keeper!

This is beyond yummy. Husband and I have been trying to cut out meat so this creamy tofu dish hit the spot. Will definitely make again. BTW I did not add the cilantro because I did not have any on hand and it still turned out great.

This recipe, just as many others have said, is bland when you first make it... but it is AMAZING the next day, and the day after that, and the day after that. I have made this a couple times and I think that as the tofu slowly absorbs the curry, the flavors become much more complex and delicious.

My tweaks: I used EVOO instead of the canola oil and the butter/margarine. I added a bag of prewashed broccoli and cauliflower, a teaspoon of garlic chili sauce and a teaspoon of red chili flakes. Since there wasn't enough curry to cover the added veggies, I used 2 cans of light coconut milk and 4 teaspoons of curry powder. I also sprinkled a bit of curry powder on the tofu before frying it. Yum!

I thought this recipe was tasty! I always tweak recipes so I added some raisins for a bit of sweet, freshly grated ginger and a pinch of 5 spice. I omitted the seasoned salt and used  a lesser amount of sea salt. After it simmered 15 mins, I added uncooked thin Asian rice noodles to the curry and few splashes of chicken broth to give the noodles extra liquid to absorb. Amazingly rich, complex and deee-lish!

It was pretty good, but I think it might be a good idea to soak the tofu in the sauce beforehand. That way the tofu gets more of the sauce's flavor.

I love this recipe! I don't change or do anything to the basic recipe except add some steamed jasmine rice with vegetables. It's mostly because my can size is 13 ounces, so I always end up with a soupy curry, which may or may not be how this is suppose to turn out to be. In any case, the soupyness always adds an extra punch to the rice, and I tend to extend the lifetime of the recipe with the increase in portions. Either way, I love it!

I love this recipe.  I made it for a dinner party and everyone agreed that it was the best tofu they had ever had.  I did press it first - but it was the season salt that made it so yummy.

Good, but wanted veg's, so added frozen bag of vegetables.

Also used 14 oz light coconut milk, 16 oz (i think, whatever reg size is) of tofu, and dry parsley instead of fresh cilantro (use about 1/3 recc'd amount if you do this). Also increased everything else by about a 1/4 to cover the veg's, and it was good, good

Great flavour! My family loved this dish (my picky 2 yr old included!). Simple & quick to make - I was able to use what I already had in the house. Changes I made were adding a large handful of chopped baby spinach just before adding the coconut milk, reducing sodium content by using 1/4 tsp sea salt instead of 1/2 tsp regular table salt, and substituted 1 Tbsp dried parsley flakes for the fresh cilantro because I didn't have it. Next time I'd like to try this with the fresh cilantro and reduce the high fat & calorie content by using 1-1/2 tsp Extra Virgin Olive oil instead of butter and Light Coconut Milk.
I served this over a Kashmiri rice inspired side dish made of what I had in the house (leftover trail mix of nuts, dried fruit and coconut shavings; 1 vegetable bouillon cube; 1 Tbsp dried chives; and 1 tsp olive oil - all added to boiling water when adding the brown rice). Make sure to use a low sodium bouillon cube and unsalted trail mix, or omit the salt from the Thai Curry Tofu recipe. I didn't do either and the combination of the 2 dishes was too salty.

I really enjoyed this recipe, though it did need a little extra zing.  It's pretty mild, so if you like things spicy you'll need to jazz it up a bit. It was nice and saucy and great served over rice.

This is very tasty and easy. I used a lot more than recommended amount of curry (went by taste) and I did not use any butter. I also used 1/2 cup more cilantro than recommended. This recipe was a hit with my family and my fiance loves it! I have done it many times (also a few times with chicken instead of tofu -- it was wonderful). I cooked it with fresh Hot Peppers (put it in the coconut milk and let it cook a bit longer.... Which gave it a really good kick).

I'm sure that some of the problem was my fault, but this was just horrible.  It was very bitter and bland and totally unedible. I think it was way too much coconut milk, and maybe it was supposed to be sweetened.  I used the plain, and it was just yucky. :(

A great, easy way to use leftover tofu!  I fried some yesterday, so the recipe was cut by 15 minutes.  I served it over brown basmati rice (take note - at least 30 minutes of cooking time) cooked some green pepers with the milk, and added a bit of cayenne pepper to add some flavor.  I loved the creaminess of the cocunut milk!

I'll try it again with a different type of curry, but the way it turned out for me today was really bad. It had no real flavor except for being a bit hot. Really not appetizing at all. But I'll buy a different kind of curry and remake it.

WAY too much seasoned salt.  I'd at least half it.  I ended up putting the whole 1 tablespoon and needed to add a potato and frozen green peppers to make it less salty.  I did use another reviews suggestion to dice up a jalapeno and throw it in and I also added an extra teaspoon of curry powder.  The recipe really needs to call for less salt, but other than that, it's a tasty dish.

So Yummy! Don't be scarred of all the changes people made. The changes I made were only minnor. I took others advice and watched my spices. Added a little less salt and added red pepper flakes. I had some snap peas I need to use so I throw those in. I served it with brown rice. YUM YUM!

I thought this was really bland. Even after adding extra veggies and several spices it was just okay. A good base recipe but definitely needs some sprucing up.

Not your typical Thai dish (as for spicyness) however I overcame that by using some spicy tofu and a little bit of hot pepper.  As suggested by others I added some veggies to bulk it up.  As a finishing touch added a little bit of dried lemon grass.  Not too shabby.

Having only been cooking tofu for about a year, I was having a hard time figuring out how to prepare a tofu dish in which you didn't taste the somewhat nutty, bland flavor of tofu (I'm not a big fan).  Well, this is it!  I made slight modifications: I added a green pepper (cubed), used about 10 green onions rather than one small regular onion, omitted the cilantro, used about 3 tsp red curry paste rather than powder, and added about 1 1/2 tbsp of soy sauce.  (Also used reduced fat coconut milk, and then added a little corn starch/water to thicken it up a bit.)  Served over jasmine rice, and I believe I may never have tofu any other way again!

This is relatively quick and very easy and cheap, a huge plus for a student like me! I dusted the tofu in a mixture of flour and curry powder before frying it which gave it a nice crisp outer texture. I added mushrooms, sweet potatoes and lemongrass which added a bit more substance and a hint of sweetness. I also added a few red chilies because I like spicy curries. I let the whole thing simmer for 20 minutes with the tofu and served it over brown rice. Absolutely delicious!

This was a very goo recipe.    I added some onions and green bell peppers though.  Also, I like my tofu a bit crispy on the outside so for step  1, before frying the tofu cubes, I dipped them into a bowl of beaten eggs, and then into corn starch making sure they are well coated with corn starch. I then fried them till the outside was very crispy.   Step 2 I followed the recipe as is (with the exception of adding onions and green peppers).

I've had this recipe in my recipe box for months but my roommate (who never cooks) actually tried it first. It made the whole house smell delicious but she said that hers came out a bit too salty and otherwise bland. After reading reviews, I made a bunch of modifications in hopes of creating a tastier dish. I pressed and drained the tofu, then fried it with ginger and garlic. After cooking the onion I added a ton of extra veggies. I used light coconut milk in order to reduce the fat content, but added extra spices (more curry powder, some cumin, cayenne pepper, and crushed red pepper flakes, ground pepper and dried cilantro), then some soy sauce instead of salt. It sure smelled spicy, but after eating it over rice I was pretty disappointed at how bland it still was. I saved the leftovers for lunch tomorrow and am hoping I'll get some more excitement then.

The curry was a little too sweet for me so I added cheyenne pepper, fixed it right up!  However the tofu was just too much I recomend cutting it into very small pieces maybe 1/2 inch dice.

Scared by reading the reviews, I held the "seasoned salt" in reserve until I had everything mixed.  (I did add a cup of mixed veggies).  Then I added Lowry's Seasoned Salt, in portions, to taste.  The flavor was nice, certainly NOT strong... but the kids did eat it (no seconds.)

This was ok.  I added some peas and carrots for a one pot meal.  My daughter and husband went back for seconds. I didn't have any cilantro and I wonder if I would have enjoyed it more with that?  I probably wont make again, but thanks for sharing.  This continues our one meatless meal a week program.

This had a good flavor, but I couldn't get the tofu cooked properly. Frying it didn't work for me...part of it flaked off & burnt on the bottom.  I will definately make the sauce again...maybe with veggies or chicken.

We thought this recipe was wonderful!!  We added a reviewers suggestion to add squash and cauliflower.  Next time I will add the squash just before the recipe is finished.  I also added a little cayanne pepper as I had no thai seasoning to give it a little punch.  Came out very good.  I can't wait to try this recipe with shrimp and tofu.

Delicious!  The first time I made this, I was unable to find coconut milk at the store, and I think what I ended up getting was cream of coconut, which is what you use in pina coladas.  It was very sweet, but delicious.  I added some cumin and a bit of chili powder to add to the spiciness and to balance out the sweetness, and it ended up quite good.  Afterwards, when I tried to make it with coconut milk, I wasn't as happy with it, so I've stuck with cream of coconut since then.

Very good with other vegetables.  I usually add green peppers in the mix.

Not one of my favourites but our dinner guest who loves curry thought it was fabulous(he gave it a 4)  altho we did come up with some things we would change next time...This time I added Cauliflower, carrots, and grape tomoatoes and served with Jeera fried rice also on this site...Next time i think I'll try it as a sauce over noodles.

Really good and super easy!  I used a Madras curry and didn't need to bulk up the seasoning to flavor up the tofu.  I garnished with some pickled ginger and boy was that tasty! (Wish I could award it 4.5 stars)

All in all this was pretty delish, but beware of the tablespoon of seasoned salt - it made the tofu super salty.  I added peas and raw cashews for some added texture.  Enjoy.

this is a fabulous recipe! i tried it today and it tasted a little bland but luckily i had pineapple and that really helped! it tasted like it needed something sweet, so i put in about 10 oz. of crushed pineapple and it tastes amazing! oh, i also put a few dashes of red pepper flakes too to spice it up. this is a great recipe!

This was a good recipe, but I didn't use as much seasoning salt/salt. I just sprinkled the tofu lightly with seasoning salt and added a few dashes of salt to the coconut milk mixture. 

I used 3 tsp of curry powder and left out the cilantro (didn't have any). Also used medium firm tofu because that's all I had. Really like coconut taste + curry! Thanks!

Also I added chicken and cooked it with the onion/garlic

Even with the modifications suggested by the other reviewers, I still found this a bit bland.  The kids refused to eat it.  I thought it was simply "okay".  I didn't throw out the leftovers, I'll still have it for lunch tomorrow.  I don't believe I will try this one again.

I recommend to add some curry paste, cury powder is good but does not provide anough flovour on its own. Don't use light coconut milk. I used light because I thought it would taste the same and I think it made it taste a little bland. Added some chopped carrot and a tiny can of bamboo shoots, available in the ethnic food section of any grocery store.

I used red curry powder, omitted the cilantro and added carrots. It was very spicy. The sauce was a little thin, but I used lite coconut milk which may have made the difference. Overall, I didn't really like it too much, but maybe I would have liked it better with chicken.

BLAND BLAND BLAND.  Even after I used more garlic, a hint of garlic salt, seasoned salt and pepper to taste.  It was a weird flavor. My 4 yr old (who eats everything), didn't like it.  He pushed his plate away and asked for pancakes for dinner instead.  Sorry will not be making this again.  It's a cheap meal though for those on a budget.

I think this dish is very good with the following changes:  much less of both salts (to taste), less cilantro, add one third of a lemon's juice, add hot pepper flakes (to taste), add a little more curry, top with chopped green onions.  

Thanks for the yummy recipe and thanks everyone else for the good alteration suggestions!

Too salty for me.  Next time I will decrease the salt and maybe try adding some sugar like other reviewers suggested. I think it would also be good with pineapple.

Loved this recipe!!  Great comfort food.  I did not have enough tofu on hand so I mixed in some chicken.  I used the whole 13.5 oz can of coconut milk added 2 teaspoons of sugar omitted the tablespoon of salt.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was very good.  I used firm tofu instead of extra firm and had some issues frying it, next time I will try to buy the right kind.  Also I didn't have fresh cilantro so I used 2tsp dried.  And I took the advice about using less salt, I did not add any of the seasoned salt.

This was really good, altho I did omit the cilantro.  I did make it once with the cilantro and it was fine, but I preferred it without it.  I also added potatoes to make it thicker and to add some flavor.

I omitted the seasoning salt and only put a dash of regular salt. I also added about 1/8 t. of garam masala. I didn't have any cilantro so I just used dried. I served the tofu over basmati rice and added peanuts, coconut and raisins. VERY YUMMY!!

I thought this was good, but I think there was a problem with the salt measurements.  I wasn't using tofu, just making the sauce, and did so without the cilantro.  I started by adding 1 tsp of Lawry's seasoned salt, and it made the sauce WAY too salty.  Had to add an extra can of coconut milk, then a bit more curry, etc.  Also added a little corn starch in water to slightly thicken it.  Overall, with these changes, will use this recipe again.

I absolutely love this recipe, it was pretty easy and thankfully i had all ingredients at home. I changed it slightly, after sautéing onions and garlic i also added mushrooms and spinach! and  i followed another reviewer instruction and added butternut squash. 
Great recipe!

This was ok. I couldn't figure out why you would want to eat tofu with just onions and garlic for company,  so I added sugar snap peas,  shredded carrots, baby corn,  mushrooms and red bell pepper.  All the fresh veggies were good but the recipe in general lacked a depth of seasoning for me.  I probably won't make this again.

Absolutely amazing recipe.  Added steamed asparagus and cauliflour after the final simmer and served over basmati.  Wife went back for seconds then licked the utensils clean.  Spectacular !!

Very good recipe. Was only my second time cooking with tofu. I would only advise to maybe double up on the sauce. I like a lot of sauce! Other than that it a good basic recipe. Will add some broccoli  next time.

Really good. Kids liked it too. I added steak mushrooms, pineapple, snow peas, green peppers. I thickened a little with corn starch and served over rice.   Definite keeper!

This recipe is fantastic! I have made it several times, and had trouble getting a flavorful meal for a while. The key I have found is to use a GOOD CURRY. I buy mine bulk from the local natural foods store, but when I was using a generic brand curry I simply could not get a full flavorful dish. With the good curry I finally found, I use about 2 tbsp of it and I add a little spice to the dish as well, usually sriracha. I also add in frozen veggies like broccoli and peas when I add the coconut milk and spices, and that typically allows time for them to thaw and cook while it is simmering. I always use extra firm tofu and 'press' my tofu before cubing and cooking. This involves placing on a cuting board or other surface and stacking books or other heavy items on top. I additionally always cook my tofu on medium-high heat for a while to get nice crispy edges. All in all, this recipe will turn out great if you use a good curry spice!

Followed the advice of others and cut down on the seasoned salt/regular salt, but upped the curry and added a bit of cumin and cayenne. Also threw in matchstick carrots and snow peas, and I used low-fat coconut milk. Results were very tasty. Next time I'll add less onion, though, if any.

Loved it. I didnt have coconut milk so I used soy milk and added some extra chilli powder, as well as a small can of mixed vegetables (carrots and green peas), and it was yum! Will totally make it again.

I made this as directed with  minor changes. I omitted the onion, chopped up a chili pepper and threw it in with the garlic, and used the whole bunch of cilantro. Served it over rice. It was delicious! Thanks for a great recipe!

I'm a big fan of tofu, but to me, this curry as too creamy.  I've never had a curry that was creamy before.  I think I could've had this dish without the coconut milk, and it would've tasted better.

This was yummy! I took others suggestions and added my own veggies...onions, green peppers, and mushrooms. I can see why some thought it was bland without veggies, I added curry paste as well along with cayenne pepper and salt, and served it over long grain brown rice...yum!

I loved this recipe, I followed the suggestions of others and added onion and extra garlic.  Sauteing them first in olive oil, then taking them out and browning the tofu.  Even though my kids were not big fans I thought it tasted great.  Enjoy!

This recipe came out very salty and bland. I highly recommend halving the amount of seasoned salt used on the tofu, and adding salt to taste for the sauce. Also, another tsp of curry powder helped a lot. And like other reviewers have said, the tofu fried with some ginger and garlic is very delicious as a snack : ).

Excellent recipe!  Pleased even the pickiest eater!  If you have some in the family that likes it spicy and some with milder tastes I recommend using yellow curry and then having Tabasco at the table so some can make it into more of a red curry spicy tast!  Great over rice!

I made this with sugat snap peas, which I added when I put the tofu back in the pan.  It looks nice when done, but I agree with others that it is lacking something.  The curry alone didn't do it for me.  It's not bad though, and I'll probably make it again with some modifications.  There was enough sauce to mix with the rice I served it with.  Both my preschooler and baby were able to eat it since it was mild enough.

This recipe was really delicious! The flavor combinations were perfect. The only change I would make would be to cook the tofu in a few spices - like curry, salt and pepper, the first go round. Will definitely make again!

This was EXCELLENT the day after! I mixed the rice(I had made yellow rice), and the Thai Curry tofu together, in the fridge over night...The next night I added seasoned salt and 2 tsps. Cumin and about one half cup of chopped fresh Cilantro......Yummy!

Very good basic recipe.  You will need to add the vegetables suggested by others, and the rest of the can of coconut milk.  Be careful adding red pepper flakes for some "heat," it seems they are augmented by the curry and the dish gets too spicy very quickly.

I cut the tofu into 1/2" cubes and used a 1/4 teaspoon cayenne red pepper, served it with white rice and it came out delicious!

This dish was about a 3 as it's listed, but I give it about 4.5 stars after making some modifications. I added more salt & cilantro and replaced the onions with scallions. I also added thin red & yellow pepper strips, red pepper flakes, cashews, and brown sugar. YUM! These additions made a significant difference. If there were anything else I would've done, it would've been to add lemongrass and fresh lime.

Excellent recipe! I prepared this a bit differently and it came out great. Will definitely make this again.

I sauteed onion and garlic in olive oil, added drained tofu and squirted some Braggs Amino Acids on top instead of salt. Sauteed some more while I chopped some broccoli and butternut squash. Added veggies, coco milk, curry powder, cilantro, salt and pepper and simmered for 15 min. Served over rice. Delish!

Didn't have any curry paste or seasoned salt and didn't miss em.

First time I made it I did so exactly as the recipe said. As others have stated it was too salty and bland. Second time I made the following adjustments:

- No salt while frying tofu. Used ginger, seaseme, and garlic instead. 
- Added frozen veggie medley after sauteeing onions and garlic. 
- Added wasabi & sugar to curry while cooking. 

The outcome was better, but still lacked flavor! Note that both times I used extra curry and garlic. My conclusion is that you need to really k ow how to cook Thai food to pull this off.

This recipe was wonderful! My sister who doesn't enjoy tofu AT ALL really liked it, as well. We didn't add as much onion, simply because I don't like it very much. Great, great recipe! My family definitely wants me to make it again!

Very tasty dishI used curry paste instead of the powder.  This way you can up the heat as you like it!  I also serve it over Basmati rice.

This is a good basic curry recipe to start with... like some of the other cooks, I added more to it.  More curry powder, more garlic, some curry paste and the vegetables you prefer.  I used broccoli and zucchini.  Yum!

I loved this creamy coconut curry recipe. I used coconut oil to deeply fry the tofu cubes because my guest doesn't Canola. We served it over quinoa laced with walnuts, scallions, and coconut flakes. The cilantro really adds a lot of greenery and flavor. It was delicious!

Very filling and very good.  Use larger size can of coconut milk and doubled the tofu.  Had enough for leftovers.  A bit salty.

I was sure I was going to love this while I was cooking it because it smelled so wonderful. I added extra salt and garlic because I like stronger flavors, however, it was still really bland for me. Something is missing. It has potential but I'm not a good enough cook to figure out what it's missing!

I loved it! I followed the recipe to the letter with the exception of substituting peanut oil in place of the canola oil, dried cilantro in place of fresh, Emeril's Essence in place of the season salt. It was off the hook!   P.S. This recipe works good with chicken as well. Two chicken breast halves is the perfect amount.

Very tasty!  I followed the recipe to a T except I definitely think it needed more salt by the time it was done (but then again-I like my salt a bit too much haha).  Very mild, flavorful dish.

Very tasty and mild, a good "beginner" curry. I added in a head of cauliflower florets (blanched for 5 minutes) when adding the tofu to the sauce. Good flavor and not too complicated.

Excellent recipe, and easy, too! I made one major change in the recipe by using coconut CREAM instead of coconut milk, as well as a few minor changes. While cooking the garlic and onions I threw in strips of red and yellow bell pepper until tender. Then I put in the curry. I added about half a cup of water since coconut cream isn't as watery as coconut milk. I used a little less than half a can (14 oz) of the coconut cream. It gave the curry a stronger scent and taste of coconut, as well as making it sweeter. Next time I'll try adding in softened carrots.

The only modification I made when I cooked it was that I used Hot madras curry powder which turned out awesome in the sauce. This was pretty good, the sauce was great, but I didn't like the tofu in this recipe.  I think it was too mushy even using extra firm and freezing for the texture.  I would love to try this with chicken for my husband or with portobello mushroom strips for a firmer, meatier texture.

This was good, but too sweet for my own taste. Next time I will not use so much coconut milk.

My family loved this dish. I added some red pepper flakes and served with Asian noodles. I'm not a big fan of tofu but this very flavorful sauce really made the difference.

Had really high hopes for this but it came out tasting really flat. Not sure if that's because of the curry powder I used or what.. Added the juice of about a third of a lemon and it grew on us after that.  Also added a minced fresh jalapeno for a little heat.

Kind of boring.  My boyfriend really liked it--but he doesn't like a lot of seasoning in general.  So if that's you, maybe you'll like this more than I did.  Definitely not bad, super easy to make and easy to modify.  However, I'll probably keep looking for a reliable standard.

Good recipe, overall.  I added peanuts, raisins, & coconut and it really added to the flavor...not sure how much I would have liked it without all that.  I also added cornstarch but would not do so again cuz it made the sauce a little too thick.  I burned the jasmine rice, but fortunately there was enough leftover to try again.  Hubby doesn't like tofu but said he like this a lot.

This is a great recipe! If you plan on reducing the coconut milk so the sauce is a thicker, don't put in as much salt as the recipe says - it gets very salty. I also added some sauteed mushrooms - but I'm sure just about any vegetable will taste good in here.

When I made this recipe, I used another's suggestion and added a half a jalapeno diced and sauted it with the onion and garlic, as well as adding broccoli while it was simmering.  Also, I could not find fresh cilantro locally and so had to use dried.  With these changes, I still felt that this recipe was not quite right.  I believe this has potential, and so the next time I try to make this I will double the sauce and add a whole jalapeno, as well as add some fresh sliced mushrooms and sliced red pepper while it is simmering, omiting the broccoli.  I think I may increase the ratio of curry to the coconut milk as well as use fresh cilantro.  Also, will serve over either jasmine or basmati rice instead of whole grain brown rice.

This was great! I really enjoyed it, but more importantly my boyfriend liked it. I've been trying    to make something he thinks is more than ok for a long time. I did add about half a jalapeno. Thanks so much

I thought this dish was boring. It didnt have enough spice for my taste.  I added hot pepper sauce and Ginger to my dish and i still thought it was boring.  The up side to the dish is that it is easy to make and fast, but i have had better curry dishes.

I somehow completely forgot to add the seasoned salt.  That would have helped it abit though it wouldn't have made it spicier, which is what I think this needs. More spice.  I'll add more curry next time or something.  My husband enjoyed this also.

The type of curry you use is important.  I also added carrots and 1/2 tsp of sugar.

I garnished with chopped peanuts and scallions.

This is GREAT! I did have some trouble keeping the tofu cubed but that was probably because all I could find was "Firm" instead of "Extra Firm." I used onion and garlic powder instead of the actual onion and garlic, and I left out the seasoned salt. Now that I know how good it is I might try some broccoli or chilli powder next time. Again, Delicious!

Delicious and not bad at all for my first efforts with tofu (other than the pre-seasoned, heat and serve kind).  I took the advice from other reviews suggesting less salt and i added chopped brocolli while simmering.  Yum!  Next time my plan is to double the recipe and add a bag of frozen veggies.

Excellent with cabbage, cauliflower, carrots and green peppers!  I added some cajun spice to make it hot.

This dish is great! I've made this twice once with tofu and once with chicken. Both times I cut the salt and seasoned salt and used a little garlic salt and both times it was great.  Whole family loved it!

I carefully followed this recipe except when it came for the salt.  I read the other reviews before making it and I omitted the 1/2 tsp. salt and didn't add the full 1 Tbs. seasoned salt.  It turned out SO salty, I could barely eat it.  Also, by frying the tofu it made the dish too oily (even after thoroughly draining and blotting it with paper towels).  I won't make this again.

I prefer to steam the tofu rather than fry it before mixing it with the other ingredients.  Broccoli makes a nice addition.  This recipe is fantastic and will remain in my frequent selection.

wanted a recipe for curry sauce for stir fry so I tried this and it was yummy. Tastes good with tofu alone, over pasta, or with stir fry.
