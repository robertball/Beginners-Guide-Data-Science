MMMMMMM!!!!!!!  So good.  I only made a few changes, based on reviews, and based on what I had on hand.  Will DEFINITELY make this again!  I used three sweet sausages and two hot sausages, cut off the casings and browned it all together.  I had fresh basil, so I chopped it up and used about 1/8cup.  I used more garlic than it calls for, but I ALWAYS do - we LOVE garlic!  Also, I intended to buy zucchini, but upon closer inspection, it was an italian squash...not the same thing, but it was still tasty.  I will buy a zucchini next time though.  I chopped all of the veggies up very small, hoping my daughter would eat them (no dice!).  My husband commented on how small they were, and that he preferred them that way - I do, too...you get more flavors in one bite if they're smaller.  I used a 15oz can of tomato sauce because another reviewer said it needed more sauce.  SUPER yummy!  Thanks so much!!  :)

My husband and I liked this sauce, but I did make some adjustments, instead of crumbling the sausage I cooked it first then cut it into pieces.  Also I needed more sauce, so I added a bit from a jar.  All in all a good recipe.

This dish was amazing - and even better the next day! I followed one reviewer's advice and diced the veggies up really small so each bite was full of veggies. It really made it wonderful!! I was planning to use two cans of diced tomatoes (b/c so many people said it needed more sauce) but realized I only had one so I improvised and threw in 3/4 of a can of creamy tomato soup (the kind you microwave and drink) and it came out wonderful!! I froze some for a future dinner and can only imagine how flavorful it will be when I eat it!! I used Jimmy Dean's sage flavored sausage and added some crushed red pepper to give it a kick. Will probably use spicy sausage next time. Thank you Heather for a terrific & easy to make recipe!!

Excellent.  I would have followed it to a T, if I had all the ingredients. But whoa did my version turn out delicious. The only changes I made were these...I simmered is for an hour after added the 28oz (not 14 oz) can of petite diced tomatos, along with 1 T of white sugar. Also, I put small dollops of creamy ricotta cheese on top of each serving, and just sprinkles of parmesan, if wnated. The ricotta was the perfect addition to this very mellow yet rich tomato-ey sauce. Ooooooh, this one is a keeper!

Very  good, very easy weeknight dinner. I just increased some of the spices and left off thyme.  Did not think thyme went with pasta sauce. I also used the 28oz canned of diced tomatoes and one small can of tomato paste in place of the tomatoe sauce.

Very tasty and even better the next day !  Took the advise from some of the reviewers:  Used Italian sweet sausage, cut into chucks not crumbled,  added an extra can of tomatoes (stewed), left out the mushrooms because we don't care for them.  Topped it with grated Parmesan and grated Mozzarella cheeses when serving.   We all loved this ! Thanks for sharing, Heather W.

We absolutely loved this dish.  The fresh veggies make this so attractive and delicious.  I made exactly as written with a few small exceptions.  I added some red pepper flakes, used a 14 oz can of tomato sauce, and only about 8 oz pasta.  I really wanted more veggie than pasta, and this worked perfectly.  I used tri-color vegetable rotini.  What a pretty dish.  Delectable!  Thanks for this nice submission, Heather.

A great last-minute dinner decision.  I used 1/2 pound of bulk fresh pork sausage, one medium shredded zucchini, canned mushrooms, and 1 entire undrained can of fire-roasted garlic diced tomatoes.  I did add more of the spices since I wasn't using Italian sausage and a few drops of hot pepper sauce.  A different and delicious pasta - good with crusty garlic bread.

This is a super easy meal if you use already sliced frozen vegetables like I did. I used a bag of peppers and onions, and a bag of zucchini and squash.  I had hot Italian sausage, so used that.  I only wish I had remembered to salt the water I cooked the pasta in, I think it would have improved the overall taste of this recipe.  I will make this again.

A good, filling, easy meal.  Makes plenty and is a great way to use some of that fresh summer garden produce.

This is excellent stuff.  Very easy, too, and not too time consuming.  I used a frozen vegetable blend that had squash, zucchini, and mushrooms but not peppers.  That's okay though--we didn't miss the peppers at all.  I did add another can of diced tomatoes and I'm glad I did.  Next time, however, I'd drain one of the cans of tomatoes--it ended up a bit watery.  Still, this has great flavor and is a wonderful one dish meal.  I flavored the sausage by using the Italian Style Sausage recipe from AR and then I used cheese tortellini, not rotini pasta.  It turned out wonderfully.  I got a little carried away with using up items from my freezer and ended up with half the sauce not needed to cover the pasta.  However, no big deal.  We'll definitely eat more of this this week!  I'm not a leftover fan, but I'd eat this again right away.  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent recipe.  Easy to make, flavorful, and a great aroma that filled the house. I made this with mild italian sausage, added a few red pepper flakes and a can of crushed tomatoes with a little water added. Otherwise followed the recipe.  Very colorful presentation too. It's a keeper at our house!

A hit with the whole family. I omitted the mushrooms and sauted diced sweet potato in the sausage drippings till golden brown. Otherwise I made this as directed. Very good recipe. Thank you Heather.

This was Excellent. But, I gave it 4 stars because I, of course, made some revisions. My husband likes a "pink" sauce, so I added 2 oz. Nafchatel Cheese (lighter version of Cream Cheese). Other revisions made were: used Italian style diced tomatoes in place of plain, used Fresh basil, Omitted thyme, while cooking italian sausage I left it in larger chunks. This is a KEEPER!

I did this a little different as our house is half vegetarian half meat eaters. I added more garlic because if there aren't at least 4 cloves in what I'm cooking I'm not happy. I also made the sauce as directed except I used 2 TB of olive oil to start it instead of the sausage fat and obviously didn't put the sausage back in after the onions and garlic cooked. The meat eaters prefer their sausage whole so I pan fried them and served them as a whole sausage next to the pasta. Everyone was happy with this and I will be making it again. Thanks!

What a great meal! Wish I had made this one sooner as it sat in my recipe box. Very flavorful and hearty. I used hot Italian sausage and whole grain rotini pasta. Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly. My family loved it. I was happy because it was chock full of veggies and the kids just ate it up. Will definately make again. Thanks!

This recipe was great.  My 17 month old son gobbled it up.  He even ate all of the vegetables.  Normally I can't get him to eat zuchini, squash or mushrooms.  Based on other reviews saying there wasn't enough sauce instead of one cup of tomato sauce I added an entire 28 oz can.  I also added more mushroom because I like them and had to use up the ones I had on hand.

I tried to half this recipe, but still made a lot.  Nice flavor.  Used 2 links of Italian Sausage.  Used all the veggies stated in the recipe, and I think it was a nice combo.  I did end up using a bit more tomato sauce then called for (and my daughter still said, "where is the sauce").  I thought there was enough for my tastes after adding the extra sauce.

This was VERY YUMMY!  Even my bf who isn't a big veggie fan loved it!  We put it over tortellini instead of the rotini pasta and the cheese filling added a great layer of flavor.  I think if I ever make it with regular pasta, I'll put some mozzarella cheese on top along with the parmesan.

We enjoyed this recipe.  I made it with all fresh vegetables from the garden.  I left out the mushrooms since we don't like those much, and added an entire 15 oz can of tomato sauce, and I still think it could have used maybe another cup of sauce.  It was very fresh and healthy-tasting.  My kids wouldn't eat the vegetables though, even though I cut them into small pieces.  I think this recipe is too chunky for kids.  I will make this again, but puree the veggies into the tomato sauce so they won't know they're there!  It's great for adults as is, though.

Wasn't Bad.  I followed the recipe as written and found it needed more sauce.  It was a bit bland.

This was such a delicious recipe! I stuck to the recipe pretty much, but like other reviewers, I just chopped the sausage up. I also added a fresh hot pepper from the garden to the pepper/zucchini mix and added a lot of fresh herbs. Served over multi-colored fusilli. Awesome way to use  a bunch of fresh veggies from the garden! Thanks!

This dish was delicious! I took the advice of other reviewers and added 15oz of tomato sauce. It definitely needed that. The veggies were great and instead of using ground sausage I cooked the links of a thin sausage and cut them into bite sized pieces to add in as that is how my daughter likes it. I'll definitely make this again.

The only thing I did different was leave out the mushrooms. It was delicious and I hope it freezes well, because it makes a big pot!

This was pretty good, and i would make again, although it was not a "wow" recipe.  I used some frozen mix of onion, green and red peppers that we had left, and had to drain some grease off after cooking the sausage (which I cut into coins), but otherwise did as directed.

I have made this SEVERAL times and love it! I always omit the mushrooms (my husband is not a fan) and I have not always had all the fresh ingredients on hand. I make it with whatever ingredients I have and it is a keeper!  I prefer 1/2 tsp. salt and 1/4 tsp. pepper. It reminds me of my mom's Zucchini Bake I had often as a child, but it's better! My picky child actually tried it and liked it!

After the dish is prepared, add about a cup of chopped fresh spinach, squeeze about a tablespoon or less of lemon or lime juice over the spinach and stir into the dish. It will quickly wilt and is a nice balance to the heat in the sausage. My family loved it.

Absolutely delicious!  I've already made this a few times.  The only changes I made were leaving out the mushrooms (hubby doesn't like them) and used mozzarella cheese in place of Parmesan (no one likes Parmesan in my family).  My husband wants this every week now and gets very excited when I make it.  It's even good without the pasta as a stew.  Yum. Yum. Yum.

Really a 5 with a few modifications based on others' suggestions: I doubled the garlic to 4 cloves, substituted 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes in tomato puree for the diced tomatoes & tomato sauce, used sweet Italian sausage sliced instead of crumbled, chopped the vegetables small, and added a handful of mozzarella at the end.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers and used a large can of tomato sauce that already had italian flavors. This contributed very well to the flavor, thoguh I still added the seasoning the recipe called for including some italian seasoning. Adding some sugar also helps to bring out some of the flavor in the sauce. I also used turkey sausage instead of italian, and the flavor was still excellent. I served it with rotini and tortellini. Will definitely make again!

Tasty and easy.  I didn't follow it exactly- no major changes except I  used about 1 1/2 tsp Italian seasoning instead of spices listed. I will probably use less pasta next time as I prefer more veggies.  Kids liked it.  It made a lot!  Fed five of us with a bunch of left overs.

I knew by looking at the list of ingredients it would be a hit at my house and I was right!  I used fresh herbs from my garden instead of dried but otherwise made as written.  My only complaint is the sauce to noodle ratio is a little off.  I had to add another cup of tomato sauce and a little of the starchy pasta water to cover all the noodles.  Thanks for sharing!
