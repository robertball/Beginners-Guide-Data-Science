I really enjoyed this. I didn't have any herbes de Provence, but I looked it up and saw that it's mostly thyme, basil and rosemary, so I shook some of each in a big ziplock bag with the salt, pepper and olive oil, then put in the asparagus and turned the bag over several times to coat. Quick, easy and tasty.

Perfect as written, right down to the roasting time, which was just right at  12 minutes. Herbes de Provence is something I never would have thought of for asparagus and it worked nicely.  This was a great side dish for our "spring meal" of blackened tilapia, garlic dill new potatoes, and chickpea salad.

Excellent and easy way to prepare fresh asparagus! Instead of messing up a bowl to toss the olive oil and herbs with the vegetable, I just brushed on the oil and shook on some herbs de provence. I will make this recipe again!

This was a great way to fix asparagus!  I didn't have Herbes de Provence, so I used 1 t thyme, 1 t sage, and 1 t rosemary.  Everyone loved it!  It works great with Teriyaki Pork Tenderloin from this website.

Beautiful, crisp~tender asparagus. Lavender is a prominent flavor in my  Herbes de Provence, so I've learned from past experience to use it sparingly. I halved the Herbes amount; though strong with lavender, the overall taste was pleasant ~ elegantly different from the many other usual asparagus preparations. I encourage everyone to try this at least once.

I just munched my way through half a bunch of roasted asparagus. It was delicious, and so easy! My favorite kind of recipe. Thanks.
P.S. I agree that the bowl wasn't necessary; I just placed the asparagus, drizzled and sprinkled and stuck it in the oven.

For a second time asparagus eater, and first shot at cooking it this was such a great recipe for me and my family. I used the herbes de Provence with this and also minced up fresh garlic and tossed with olive oil, using tin foil is the best way in the oven on a tray all spread out separately so each piece gets attention. Loved it! Thanks so much

This was good and the cook time dead on accurate, however 1 full tablespoon of herbs de Provence was a bit much for me.  Perhaps I had a smaller bunch of asparagus than normal...I think I'll reduce the seasoning by half the next time I use this!  Thanks!

I tried this last night and thought it was quite good. I noticed that several posters didn't have Herb de Provence. It can be difficult to find but it's not hard to make your own. I just mix equal portions of dried thyme, savory, marjoram, oregano, and fennel seed. Then I add a half a portion of dried rosemary (I have whole rosemary so I crush it a little in a pestle and mortar), and mix it up. The fennel seed has a slight licorice taste and works well with the asparagus. Bon appetite.

If fixing with roasted potatoes, can be added for the last 12 minutes at 425.  Prepare as recipe directs.

So simple and so good.  This is how we make our asparagus now every time.  We typically wrap it in tin foil and toss on the grill with steaks.  Excellent.  Herbes de Provence can be pricey but it's worth it.  Enjoy!

Wonderful change from steamed asparagus. Made as directed except cut back a bit on the olive oil as I used a well seasoned baking stone to roast. Is also great the next day as a cold side dish.

This recipe is PERFECT. The asparagus was perfectly roasted (think 'al dente') and tasted amazing. That said, I have to recommend you make you're own blend of herbes de provence. This makes a difference I think. If you make this yourself, you can leave out the extra pepper the recipe calls for and just add salt to taste. Definite keeper!

OH....MY....GOD.... This is way too amazingly good to be so simple to prepare!  Tried it for the first time with fresh asparagus from my Dad's garden.  Could not be more perfect.  Our new favorite way to prepare asparagus.  Thanks for a stellar recipe!  Absolutely no changes necessary.

I've made this several times and get rave reviews every time.  It is simple to make and tastes great.  I put everything in a ziplock bag and toss it.  It is also something that you can make in advance and then cook it at the last minute.  I plan on trying it with different herbs, such as rosemary, tarragon and Italian seasoning.  Versatile and easy recipe.

This was on the edge of bitter. I had no "herbes de provence" but used a small amount of each of the ones normally found in that blend - it was a different way of fixing asparagus, though.

Roasted is my favorite kind of asparagus! I roasted these with cut-up potatoes. (It takes about 30 minutes to roast cubed potatoes; my asparagus withered a little, but I don't mind. The asparagus was done in the time indicated in the recipe.) I made my own Herbes de Provence & decided we quite like that combination of flavors! Thanks for the recipe & for the idea!

Loved it.. used to just steam asparagus in a microwave bag and this way is amazing. I couldn't stop eating it. Was really easy by shaking them in a gallon ziplock bag with the olive oil and seasonings.

Perfect as written! I'll admit that I didn't roast mine the full 12 minutes because I still like some crunch but I left hubby's in there for the full 12 and it was perfect for him.

Just happened to stumble upon this recipe, and what a find.  I absolutely love the different aromas of herbes de provence, and was amazed at how well it went with the sometimes monotonous flavor of asparagus.  This was a breeze to prepare...I definitely foresee it in my Thanksgiving future.  I've also been diligently searching for a vegetarian replacement for the lamb in my 'White bean and lamb soup' (also on this site).  If cut into smaller portions and added right before serving, I think this will be a delicious alternative for my non-carnivorous guests!  Thanks Jessica.

I served this delicious asparagus with Christmas dinner and it disappeared quickly...everyone absolutely LOVED it!  I did as a couple of reviewers suggested and drizzled the olive oil over the asparagus on the baking sheet, then sprinkled with the spices so I didn't dirty up any extra dishes.  Cooking time of 12 minutes was perfect!  They came out crispy and yummy!.  Even the kids loved them!  I will definitely be making this again!

Having tried this once I know that this will become a regular way for me to prepare asparagus. Simple and excellent.

A wonderful and easy way to make asparagus.  This cooking method turns out perfect every time. I've made this with the herbes de provence (which is very good), or sometimes I leave that off and then sprinkle the asparagus with either balasamic vinegar or lemon juice just after it comes out of the oven.

I did reduce the amount of herbs somewhat,  but this recipe is delicious!  I made 2 bunches yesterday and munched on them all day, even after they cooled off.  I love herbes de provence and this is a great use of it!  UPDATE...  Amount of oil can surely be reduced, and I often will just use olive oil cooking spray.

I have done my own version of this recipe for many years now.  I don't like Herbs de Provence, so I just use the juice of one freshly squeezed lemon and I add the zest of the lemon as well, salt & pepper.  Try grilling them--it's even better! Such a fresh, crisp, and refreshing way to welcome spring!

Amazing. Loved the texture and taste. I used regular salt. Definitely will use sea salt next time or double up on regular salt as it lacked it in flavor.

My husband and I did not really enjoy this recipe, my in-laws seemed to like it but I prefer just salt and pepper to season my asparagus.  The cooking method itself is right on, I just wasn't a fan of the flavor.

This was pretty good. It wasn't anything to go insane about, but good. I had to use regular asparagus because the grocery store was out of baby asparagus, but I think it would have tasted better with baby asparagus.

I made this last night and I had some herbes de provence in my cupboard.  The only thing I reccomend is to grind up the spices before adding otherwise you have some chunky rosemary to try and chew.

I grilled some ribeyes for my daughter and I wanted something speical to go with them.  This came out perfect!  I added about a pound of halved mushrooms to the asparagus and it was OMG GOOD!  Be careful to stay to 12 minutes or under in the oven.

The Herbes de Provence really compliment the asparagus.  This was so fast and easy.  I will definitely do this again.  Ditto the other reviewer who mentioned brushing the olive oil.  And Penzey's is a great source for the Herbes de Provence if you're having trouble finding it.  Try this - it's a winner!

This was delicious and super easy.  Thae hardest part was finding the Herbes de Provence.  I served this for Easter dinner last year, and the asparagus eayers thought it was great. Will definitely make again.

Excellent with the herbs de province. I substituted a little cajun spice for the sea salt and OMG!!!  I believe I died and went to culinary heaven!  Remember that asparagus continues to cook once removed from the heat source, so staying on time is critical to success for this recipe.   Thanks for the new favorite.

Delicious!!!  I had to use table salt instead of sea salt.  Other than that I followed the directions provided.  I will definitely make this again.  Wonderful complement to salmon and saffron rice.

Delicious! Coated asparagus with olive oil right on baking sheet, then sprinkled with herbs, salt and pepper. I also added a minced clove of garlic cause I love garlic! My family loved it!

I love asparagus and I love herbs de Provence. The combination of both made a delicious side dish.  For best result, you need to pick asparagus that are neither too thin or too thick, to avoid over cooked or tough and stringy asparagus.

I actually had herbes de provence on hand so thought I’d give this try. I measured out 1 tablespoon but as I was sprinkling it on, it seemed like a lot so cut it back by probably 1 1/2 teaspoons which seemed to be more than enough. It’s a pretty fragrant herb mix. My asparagus was thick so I roasted it the full 12 minutes which was perfect. I will make this again so I can use up that jar of herbes de provence that bought for some other recipe about a year ago.

Perfect way to cook Asparagus, the flavors compliment each other and the taste was amazing. I served this as a side dish to baked fish, but it will definitely be added as a side dish to other meals

Will never cook Asparagus any other way!  Okay may add a little butter to the olive oil but hey...there's always room for a little butter!  Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

Super easy and yummy way to make asparagus.  I did not use the Herbes de Provence because I made Hollandaise sauce to put on top.

Nice way to cook asparagus, but didn't care much for the herbes.  I prefer the recipe that uses Cajun spices.

Awesome!  Made this for my family when my parents were over for dinner and didn't have enough!  Then, my mom made it for my older brother who doesn't care for asparagus and he loved it too!  They didn't have Herbes de Provence so they used Italian Seasoning.  I've tried both ways and like the Herbs better.  Thank you for the new hit recipe!

I love this--I made it by accident one night when the herbs fell out of the cupboard and landed-open-on the asparagus I had just rolled in olive oil for roasting!  It's now our favorite way to eat asparagus.  We also prepare it on the grill in good weather.

Hmmmm. Well, be sure you like herbes de Provence before using them first of all. I like them, most of my family did not. I cooked these in a lidded pan with butter NOT oil. While I did like these, next time I will also add a bit of garlic. I like this the way it's written but with butter instead of oil.

One word - DELISH!  Made this side dish last night and how tasty it was.  Reading other reviews, I only used 1 teaspoon  dried Herbes de Provence and I felt that was plenty.  Will definitely make again.

Great simple recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly (not much to follow its so easy)  the asparagus came out perfectly crispy.  The only change I'd make next time is to add less olive oil and herbs.  Maybe I had a smaller bunch to work with but it seemed like a little too much.  Overall great though, its definitely going to be on rotation.

Not bad.  Ended up roasting it on 350 for 15 min bc I had a casserole in the oven at that temp.  A little too much herbs de provence, but otherwise nice flavor.  Thanks.
