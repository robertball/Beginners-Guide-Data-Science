From time to time I come across a recipe and think, why didn't I think of that. I love every ingredient in this recipe. One I made as is and one I used raspberry chipotle sauce in place of the cranberry sauce. Both are equally good! Thank you Gevans for sharing this with us.

Since it's March, I used little turkey cutlets and jellied cranberry sauce. It still turned out delicious. It's simple and requires only a little bit of prep. This is a recipe I'm going to come back to, for sure.

Great "day after" lunch remedy when you don't feel like cooking. I took advice from another reviewer and used cranberry chipotle sauce. I used Fontina cheese and also made some with corn tortillas. Not one person complained about eating leftover turkey. Just pile these on a plate and leave them out, and watch them disappear.  What a great idea. Thank you for the recipe.

This is an excellent recipe that is easily modified as needed for each individual taste. For example, I added a lot more jalapeno to mine and some chunks of crispy bacon to the base recipe and everything came out great.

These were very tasty! I just used regular peppers and onions and they were just fine! Will make again!
