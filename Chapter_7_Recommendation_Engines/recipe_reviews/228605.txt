I absolutely love this recipe! It is so delicious. My family and I really enjoy it, especially since I am on a strict diet. I do add a tbsp more of the molasses though. I love the flavor.

Very yummy. I thought it was salty too, so I ended up adding in 1/2 cup water; I used 4 T brown sugar instead of molasses. If you heat it up and add corn starch (mix equal parts corn starch & cold water, then add), it makes a tasty glaze.

Use low sodium if you are going to make this. It was way too salty!

Tasty and not too salty for a teriyaki.  Kept pork sirloin chops so tender. I doubled recipe for 2 large packages (12).

It's OK if you can't get to a grocery store. I should have added honey like other reviewers.

I like my teriyaki sauce a bit sweet, so followed the advice of some of the other reviewers and added honey. I used low-sodium soy sauce and it was salty enough. Very simple, yummy sauce! I would make it again.

04-19-16 ~ A marinade we really enjoyed with grilled chicken and veggies. I marinated blsl chicken all day and used some of the unused marinade with grilled veggies. We really enjoyed the molasses and ginger in this recipe. It is a recipe that I will be using again.

I thought that this was very simple and a great marinade. I did find it to be salty, but I would fix that by just using low sodium soy sauce. Overall, we did love it and will use it again!

We loved the recipe. We had Teriyaki chicken with rice. Yummy. It was a little on the salty side. But, hey I like salt. Is there a way to make this recipe without the heavy salt taste? This is a keeper. I wanted it a little thick so added a teaspoon of corn starch and heated all until it thickened a bit.
