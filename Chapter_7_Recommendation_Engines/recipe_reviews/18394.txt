I really didn't like this recipe.  It tasted like glorified vanilla frosting to me and you really couldn't taste the dried cranberries.  For how expensive these are to make, they are definitely not worth it.

This was a big hit on my holiday tray.   Some even thought that this was divinity!  I will be making this one again.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was a disaster.  I was embarassed to serve it over the holidays.  I'll stick to cooked fudge from now on.  This no-cook stuff was just a sticky mess.

This was the best fudge I have tasted in a long time. We omited the nuts due to allergies. It reminded me a lot of nougat and had such a creamy texture.

I didn't care for the recipe.  There were a lot of ingredients, you have to watch the white chocolate carefully, and it does taste strongly like frosting.  However, the people I gave it to liked it.  Maybe you just can't know what's in it.
