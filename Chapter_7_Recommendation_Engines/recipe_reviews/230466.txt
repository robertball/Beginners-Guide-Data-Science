I'm so flattered to see this at the top of AR's recent e-mail.  I had modified the recipe even more this past weekend and it was a hit at a party.  I had adjusted the ingredintes by reducing the pumpkin puree to one cup, used only one can of garbanzo beans and one tablespoon of EVOO, with the rest of the seasonings and ingredients the same as posted.  It turned out FANTASTIC!

I make hummus frequently but this may be my new fav recipe.  Modified to one can of beans , one cup pumpkin, and 1/4 t of cayenne because I don't like too much heat.  All else the same.  Even my teenager who says she doesn't like pumpkin commented that it is really good

Nice flavor.. easy... threw it all in the food processor. Needed salt and pepper and more heat for my tastes. Will be using leftovers on chicken wraps for work lunches for the week

Made this to take to Thanksgiving, followed the recipe with the adjustments RedHedd had posted in a review/comment.   It was a big hit. The pumpkin taste is not at all overpowering, and the seasoning was flavorful without being too spicy.  My husband and daughter are big hummus fans, and definitely gave thumbs up to this recipe.  It was our first time making our own hummus, and it came out perfectly. We will definitely make this again.

Just made it (halfed the receipe).  I too am having to let the flavors mingle for the 2 hours indicated in the receipe before I cast my final vote.  I also used my vitamix.  I had to add liquid to get the blades moving.  Next time I won't drain the chickpeas.

Wonderful!  I made it for our (Canadian) Thanksgiving dinner and served with crudites.  I followed the creator RedHedd's suggested modifications.  Definitely has a bite with 1/2 tsp of cayenne.  One idea is if you make your own tahini (I did) in the food processor, then you can make the hummus right after without washing out the food processor - two birds with one stone.

I am not a fan of hummus but I received an assignment to provide refreshments for an upcoming Christmas event and this recipe caught my eye.  I followed RedHedd's updated suggestion and used 1 cup of pumpkin and 1 can of Garbanzo beans, increased the oil to 2 Tbsp. and kept everything else the same.  Wow this was awesome I made pita chips also from this site and served them to my family for their opinion....All said 5 star even my kids.  I am confident when I make this for 300 people next month it will be a HIT....Thanks RedHedd for sharing:)

I added 2 teaspoons extra olive oil and instead of blending the pumpkin seeds into the hummus, I toasted them and placed them on top with chopped dried cranberries.  Soooo gooood!!!!!!

Taste is interesting...not hummus and not pumpkin. Followed the recipe to the letter and my Vitamix could barely move because it was so thick.  Ended up adding 2 tablespoons extra olive oil and tahini, another cup of pumpkin and whatever extra lemon juice I could squeeze out of the lemon.  Finally, stirred in 1 cup of toasted pumpkin seeds.  Am reserving judgement until it has chilled and flavors melded.  Am taking it to a party and will post reactions.
Sorry folks....this was barely touched.  People were curious about pumpkin hummus but after they tasted it, they didn't go back.  Had to toss most of it.

This is the first recipe I've reviewed, out of dozens tried, because I love it SO MUCH! I followed RedHedd's revisions in the Dec 19, 2012 review to use one can of chickpeas and half a can of pureed pumpkin, and it's phenominal - though I don't like heat, so no cayenne pepper. It's not an overpowering pumpkin flavor, but the pumpkin makes it just a touch sweeter than other hummus varieties I've tried (zucchini, beet, cucumber...). I was torn between a sweeter version of pumpkin hummus on AllRecipes with pumpkin spice, etc. instead of cumin, etc., but this is a perfect combination of flavors for a hummus that works wonderfully as a veggie dip, sandwich spread, or just straight out of the container ;)

At first thought it was a bit unusual, but decided to give it a try and was pleasantly surprised with the results. Everyone of my guests absolutely loved it. I would love to modify it so it would eliminate the nut factor in the recipe so my other friends that have nut allergies can enjoy it as well.

I made this according to Georgia's updated instructions; using one can of garbanzo beans and one cup of pumpkin pur√©e. I used about an eighth teaspoon of cayenne pepper and was compelled to use more than the two teaspoons of olive oil the recipe called for because the mixture was so thick. This turned out seriously delicious and I can foresee that I will be sharing this with others. Thank you Georgia for the great recipe!

This is a great recipe and yes, a bit hit. My family recipe for hummus calls for 1 cup (1/2 of one can of Joyva) tahini and I would recommend keeping that amount in this recipe as well. It was a little dry with only 2 Tblsp. Otherwise, flavorful recipe!

I absolutely love this recipe! I made it exactly as written and found it perfect! I made it for a group of friends and everyone wanted the recipe.  I am picky when it comes to "good" hummus and this recipe is a keeper.

The original recipe is definitely lacking in flavor and punch. But making these changes turned it to gold! I used half the amount of beans and pumpkin, then doubled the garlic. I also increased the amount of cumin and cayenne, but that‚Äôs more to your individual taste.

I was skeptical, wondering how pumpkin in hummus could possibly be any better than my standard homemade hummus. It is fantastic! The addition of pumpkin, paprika and cayenne turned out to be surprisingly delicious. I made the recipe as written minus the pumpkin seeds and thought it was perfect, even after reading the chef‚Äôs recommended modifications. It a great recipe where you can start with it as written then increase the seasonings to taste. I didn‚Äôt have the pumpkin seeds around, but will try them next time!

I made this for 5 people but I was the only one who liked it and that required doubling the lemon and tahini. We couldn't taste the pumpkin and one hummus-lover didn't like the consistency of this. I think if you want it to taste like pumpkin, use only one can of garbanzo beans. Or add pumpkin pie spice.

I don‚Äôt own a food processor. When I tried to make it in my blender it was very difficult because of the volume. Now I put all the basic ingredients in a pot and use my immersion blender which makes it very easy. Everyone loves it.

I followed this recipe except for the tahini  (family member is allergic). It turned out great, and I will make it again.

I have made a lot of hummus, and the addition of the pumpkin definitely improved the texture compared to my previous recipes.  My Cuisinart had no trouble pureeing the ingredients. With the 2:1 bean to pumpkin ratio, the pumpkin flavor is very subtle. The raw garlic is strong, though, and roasting the garlic or using less may improve the flavor. I may also add rosemary in the future, which was an ingredient in other pumpkin hummus recipes I found on my search.  This hummus is a good way to get beans into my kids.

I liked this recipe, the pumpkin flavor was not overwhelming and it was very easy to make.  This is a great variation for a hummus fan that does not want to get stuck in a rut or if you are looking for something unique during the fall season.

Two cans of chickpeas made the hummus too thick but, and didn't help the pumpkin flavor. I added cumin and a bit more liquid.

I could eat this by the spoonful.  Made it per the recipe, and the only issue I had was that things weren't blending properly. I added in some extra olive oil and it helped, although next time I'll probably reserve some of the bean liquid.

Also, this recipe makes a lot, so be mindful of this if you are not making this for a party.

All in all everyone loved! Can't wait to try this with different toppings like roasted almonds and pomegranate seeds.

I skipped the lemon, I roasted my garlic, I used smoked paprika, and toasted raw sesame seeds that I ground into fresh tahini, and I cooked my garbanzo beans until tender.  I pulsed everything together and upped all the seasonings to my liking.  It came out great and everyone loved it.  I am glad to find a new way to fix the pumpkins I grew in the garden.

I LOVED this hummus, and I have made hummus 100 times!   I used  cashew butter instead of tahini (a first for me - I didn't have tahini, which I normally use, so I substituted the cashew butter, added a 1/8 tsp of sesame oil, and it was perfection).  Also, I used about 4 TBS of lemon juice and another 4 TBS of ice water, for the lemony flavor I love as well as to  thin down the thickness of the cashew butter.  I left out the cumin (I'm just not a fan) and used smoked paprika.   Pefection, in my personal hummus book!!

What kind of crackers, veggies, or other types of things to dip in work best? I usually use homemade pita chips with hummus. I am wondering if I made some with sugar-cinnamon if that would work? Please let me  know what you all have served this with.

This was really good.  I served it as an appetizer on Thanksgiving this year.  I wasn't happy with the seasoning. To me, it was a little bland with the recipe (however, I like things with a zing).  So, I would recommend you make the recipe as stated.  Taste it and add what you like.  I added 2 more garlic cloves, cayenne pepper and a little more lemon juice and it fit my tastebuds, but this was excellent, healthy, and full of fiber.  This is something you can make throughout the year.

I used 1 can garbanzo & 1 can pumpkin.  Once everything was blended, I added cayenne to my liking.  Great recipe!!! Simply, yummy, healthy.

Oh my goodness!!! I always buy hummus. This is the first timeI have made it. This stuff is awesome! I put less Cayenne in it because my husband doesn't like it too spicy. We only waited 20 minutes to eat some. It looked too good to wait 2 long hours for it.
