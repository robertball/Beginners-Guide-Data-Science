Quite delicious! We did not do the mayonnaise portion to reduce fat content. Just the boullion + butter over the fish kept the fish flavorful and moist. We had these on corn tortillas with lettuce, tomatoes and a sour cream/red hot/chili pepper sauce on top. Will for sure make these again!

This was a quick, tasty and healthy dinner!  I added cilantro and red taco sauce for a little extra flavor.

Big hit at our home!  The sauce was excellent, much tastier than the simple yogurt/mayo sauce without the spices.  We used fish sticks for our fish since that's what we had and they were great!  We just baked them according to the package directions and served them up with corn tortillas and cabbage.  Excellent!

These were absolutely delicious and so easy! I used corn tortillas heated in foil in the oven and used low fat mayo and sour cream for the coleslaw. I also added cilantro and avocado to the tacos. We had black beans and fresh mango as side dishes and the flavors went very well together.

i am NOT a fish eater, but this has become my all-time favorite meal. my parents loved it too. i eat these so often that i keep the butter mixture in my fridge. i've used tilapia, crappie and basa fishes. they all turn out wonderfully. however, i do prefer corn tortillas heated up in a little oil instead of flour ones. a little dollop of garlic-lime salsa on top is a must for me. so SO good.

My husband was pleasantly surprised but he would not touch the mayo coleslaw mixture. Just put lettuce, tomatos, and avocados and said he liked them! That's a big thing here.

Wonderful!  I added more lime juice and garlic to the fish before cooking, and more lime juice to the slaw mix for more kick.  We also prefer corn tortillas to flour, makes it more like the fish tacos you get at restaurants.  My family asks for this at least once a week now, even my two year old loves it!

It was okay.  Nothing great.  It might have been because of the kind of fish that I used.

This fish had very good flavor!  Next time I will throw the fish in a frying pan after it cooks in the oven to brown it some or maybe I'll just fry it instead of baking it.  For the dressing I added some taco seasoning and cilantro.  I will definitely make this again!

Excellent--easy to make and delicious.  I only used half the butter and half the mayo mixture and it was perfect.  Also used corn tortillas instead of flour.  This is going in the regular rotation.

I don't even like fish, but this is delicious - the mixture of spices with the bouillon is terrific.  My family eats it plain (no taco, like a hot fish salad) and it's a favorite.

These went together SO quickly!  The fish stays moist, and the sauce you brush on them adds a lot of flavor.  We particularly liked the contrast between the soft, flaky fish and the crunchiness of the coleslaw mix.  My husband put cheese and sour cream on his (he puts cheese on everything!).  I tried to keep mine a bit healthier by using an extra squirt of fresh lime and mild green taco sauce which paired extremely well with all the other flavors.

This was a very easy and tasty recipe. I topped the tacos off with a pineapple mango salsa and it added an extra zing to the tacos. I will definintly make them again.

GREAT!  Easy and quick recipe.  I used red snapper since it was in my freezer.  I also added about 2 T. of cilantro for flavor...YMMMMMMMMMMM.
