I followed this recipe exactly (decided to add the optional vanilla) and did not have any problems. It has to be carefully watched and constantly stirred during and after the addition of the milk sugar and cornstarch mixture because it looks like warm milk for a while and then within seconds it is the consistency of pudding. I ended up pouring the resulting pudding-like goo into two ungreased glass bowls after I took out the lemon peel and cinnamon sticks. I then immediately put the bowls into the fridge uncovered and left them there overnight. We had it for dessert after dinner which means it spent almost 24 hours in the fridge and it ended up acting very much like jello. It even did the jiggle movement when unmolded. I was able to flip the bowl and have it drop on a plate as a perfectly smooth dome which I garnished with some dark chocolate curls. The flavor was light and cool and reminded me a little bit of a mild rice pudding but the texture was entirely smooth. It came out great and I think next time I will experiment with other flavors.

Yummy yummy yummy! This reminds me of panna cotta and I love panna cotta! I love the cinnamon and lemon flavors. And I think just about any type of sauce would be good with it - chocolate caramel lemon berry etc.... Thanks for the great recipe! I will definitely make it again!

I substituted orange for lemon peel and cloves for cinnamon sticks. I also added fresh vanilla bean (1/2 bean chopped) ground cinnamon and ground nutmeg (a dash). Not sure if the consistency before refrigeration is the same as after just yet...hoping it will thicken up a slight bit. The taste even prior to refrigeration is fantastic though!

This was pretty great... I grated the lemon peel and kept it in and added some grated orange peel as well. The overall consistency was like a thin pudding so if you're expecting a more custard-like consistency you might be disappointed. I served it with fresh sliced strawberries and melted hot chocolate on top and it was fantastic but I'm not sure how amazingly it would stand on its own.

I made the recipe exactly as stated with the exception of cooking it longer than the 20 seconds mentioned in the recipe to get the consistency I wanted. I also added the teaspoon of vanilla. This dessert is lighter than a usual pudding and the flavor profile is mild but interesting and enjoyable. This was wonderful plain but would be fabulous dressed with chocolate or fresh fruit.

Followed recipe carefully and really liked the finished pudding. I used whole milk and added the vanilla which slightly took away the pure white color. I used the pudding layered in a red white and blue trifle dessert using angel food cake cubes pudding sliced strawberries more cake cubes whipped cream and blueberries sprinkled on top. It was delicious. I topped with whole strawberries that had an American flag toothpick through each hull. Very pretty and festive. Pudding had a rich but light flavor by heating milk with the lemon peel and cinnamon sticks. After pouring hot pudding in bowl I covered top of pudding with wax paper to avoid developing skin while it cooled overnight in the refrigerator. Pdding added a great flavor to total dessert taste.

I left out the lemon and cinammon as I wanted a plain vanilla blancmange to serve with other accoutrements. This recipe contains way too much sugar it's far too sweet. Secondly it didn't set even after 24 hours in the fridge. Blancmange should set to a jelly-like consistency and turn out with a wobble - this was too thin and turned out like a barely set custard. I made a point of cooking out the flour to reach the desired consistency so this should not have happened. Here's some background for those confused and/or messing around with this recipe: it's supposed to be 'bland' - it's nursery food. Blancmange is traditionally served plain or with a flavouring alcohol in the mix or with fruit and/or a coulis. To serve think pannacotta: the milky pudding itself is a simple base it's the accoutrements that zhush it up.

I thought it was very tasty. The only reason that I give it four stars instead of five is because I feel like it could use something extra.
