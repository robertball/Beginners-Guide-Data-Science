good...it was a bit too buttery, though. next time i would use at the most 3/4 c. also, i baked it for about 20 min at 350 after i cooked it on the stovetop to make it a bit crispier.

I made this stuffing as I had a ton of breadcrumbs & no idea what to do with them! We eat a loaf produced by Warburtons which contains lots of poppy, sunflower & sesame seeds & also millet, which made my personal version of this stuffing very tasty indeed.  I also substituted a quarter of the butter with virgin olive oil which gave a Meditteranean twist.

This was the first time I've ever made my own stuffing & was a simple, easy recipe to start with.  It went very well with the roast chicken we ate, but my other half says he prefers the shop-bought stuff :( No pleasing some people!

I reduced the butter to 1/2 cup and  added sage. I then baked it in the oven and the kids enjoyed it.  I make this for the vegetarians.

Nice flavor and nice to have the veggies in the stuffing. My boys love stuffing so when I can get an extra veggie in I'm a happy mama.

This got 50/50 reviews from a family of 15 when I made it.  Several people were raving about it, and several people thought it was just "okay"...I thought it was aweful, not because of the taste, but because the amount of fat used in it was unnecessary.  I would use MAYBE 1/2 c. butter or margarine next time.  Also, I spread the stuffing into a baking dish and baked at 350 until it was firmed up and lightly browned.  I will probably not make this again.

This was really yummy!  It was a great way to sneak in veggies too!  My only problem was that it stuck to the pan (bad).  But my hubby can't have dairy,so I had to cook w/ margarine, and I think that may have been the problem.  Next time, I will prepare it all and then bake it...that way I can get the crispies on the top that we all love so much.  Thanks Blathana!
