This salad has good flavor. I especially liked the touch of thyme. I used reduced sodium broth but with feta, capers and kalamata olives it was a bit salty. Next time I would omit the broth and cook the orzo in unsalted water. With all the other great flavors I don't think the broth would be missed. I would also omit the butter and just rinse the pasta to eliminate any sticking. I used fresh basil and thyme and added grape tomatoes to cut the salt taste, it was a nice addition. Did a dry toasting on the nuts and drizzled the oil in the salad. Diced chicken would go very well in this salad. Thank you for the post.

Yummy!!! This was delicious, and so easy to make. I was just cooking for me, so I halved it, it still made plenty. I skipped the capers and olives because I can't stand them, but next time I make this (and I will be making this a lot!) I will add them. Shared this at lunch with coworkers and they liked it too, thanks for an easy and delicious recipe!

This is really tasty. I also skipped the chicken broth, used fresh herbs, and plain feta. I did add xtra lemon and olive oil, as mine turned out a little bit dry... Can't wait to try it tomorrow! Thanks prell2k4!!

Oh, wow. This is SO GOOD! Excellent combination of flavors and textures. The only changes I made were to use veg broth and fresh herbs (I added the basil with the spinach rather than sauteing it), and olive oil instead of butter. I'll dry-toast the nuts next time--they seemed a little soggy from toasting in the oil, and my garlic started to burn. Still, absolutely delicious--a new favorite!

This was delicious! A welcomed change from the regular ol' pasta salad. I used fresh basil and thyme and added them in with the spinach for fresher flavor. Another reviewer suggested dry roasting the pine nuts...next time I'll do that as well...to brown them up a little better and prevent my garlic from browning. I didn't have kalamata olives so I used black olives and I did add chopped artichoke hearts and grape tomatoes for color. BUT this recipe on it's own deserves 5 stars. Thank you for the recipe:)

Loved this recipe! I had almost all the ingredients, but not the right AMOUNTS, but it still worked out delicous. My package of Feta was only 6 oz., and my pine nut pkg. was only 2.5 oz. AND I was out of olives, so omitted them. That being said... you can make this recipe a little cheaper and still be a 5 star! Light enough for summer heat eating and hearty enough for an entree AND nice enough for company! Thanks Prell2k for a wonderful recipe and Tizzylizz for suggesting!

I needed to use up a lot of fresh cilantro, and this recipe was a great template!  Omitted the Italian-style spices in this recipe, and used cilantro, EVOO and lemon juice in place.  Great summer meal with some grilled chicken!

So delicious! And a nice change as a cool side dish to go with our grilled pork tenderloin.  Added some minced red onion and finely chopped cucumber.  Made a lot so I get to enjoy it for lunch too.  I really think the key is cooking it in the chicken broth.

Turned out excellent! I added an additional teaspoon of chopped garlic, substituted goat cheese instead of the feta, and added halved cherry tomatoes for color and sweetness.

This salad is delicious!  I left out the capers due to personal preference and thought I had a bag of spinach leaves but it was romaine lettuce so the spinach was out.  Aside from that this dish rocked!  I loved the crunch of the pine nuts, and the flavor combo with the flavored feta cheese.  I've got the leftovers here at work for lunch.  I will be making this dish again!

I cooked this orzo dish exactly as instructed and it was delicious! The flavors all mingle together for a fantastic forkful everytime--the red pepper flakes make a nice (but not overwhelming) POP! It's delicious both hot and cold. Also, looks really pretty when served in a nice pasta bowl.

My husband enjoyed this more than I did. I followed the directions except using veggie stock. I do not enjoy olives so I put them separate so my husband could add them to his own dish. This was the first time I tried capers and unfortunately I did not like them. I recommend to all others trying them for the first time to try before you add the liquid to the dish. I substituted walnuts for pine nuts to reduce the cost. The spices added much flavor to the pasta.

Delish!, tho as usual, I has to scale it down for two for my small family according to the ingredients on hand as best I could. I used regular black olives cause I had a partial can open, and a bit less of the amount than called for of fresh spinach. I used everything else per recipe specs (using a scale, as my hubs is dieting and being strict about tracking his calories). I did find the end result to be VERY dry, perhaps because of not using the entire jar of capers and liquid, so I had to toss in a tablespoon or so of EVOO to make it loose enough to even eat.  All in all, tho, it's a salad. It's absolutely scrumptious and will give the diner much delish nutrition, but it is NOT "diet" friendly, unless one plans it to be the entree. I personally didn't care all that much; this salad was yummy enough to warrant a few extra miles on the bike, and I was looking for a recipe to use up the fresh spinach I had in the fridge. Thanks for posting, as I don't know I'd have thought of either cooking the orzo in chicken broth, or of mixing the spinach with pasta. YUM! Delish result!!

This was a HUGE hit at our annual Fourth of July Party.  I added cherry tomatoes for some color and pared down the amount of spinach.  People keep asking me for the recipe, and today I am making it for my niece's birthday party.

First - it makes WAY more than 8 servings. (especially if you are brining to a bbq as a dish to pass)  I just made this salad and wanted to taste it before i brought it to the bbq.  OMG - i do not want to share it - - it is THAT good.  It has all my favorite things in it.  However, next time i will cook the orzo pasta with at least 5 cups of chicken broth - I can not wait to make again.

This was fabulous.  I followed the directions except we cut the feta in half.  We had it cold at a summer pond party and I received rave reviews!! Healthy, tasty, and the kids liked it too.  Was very good hot off the stove also.  This is a winner!

Absolutely LOVED THIS!  I did not cook my orzo in chicken broth nor did I add the butter to it after, just rinsed.  I only had regular (light) feta so used that & decided not to use the juice from the capers but did add more fresh lemon juice to compensate.  Made this to go along with Feta Cheese Turkey Burgers/Spicy Turkey Burgers from this site for our youngest son's 2nd birthday with our families.  SO GOOD...will certainly make this one again, hubby proclaimed as his new fave orzo salad!

Don't change a thing! Unless you add some cherry tomatoes. Made this with a lemon marinated lamb chop and roasted beets. Very filling, I cut the recipe in half and it made enough for 6 servings!

Really good. Followed the recipe as-is except I just used a bit of olive oil to stop the cooked orzo from sticking.  I also used less pine nuts and just put them on at the end, on top, as garnish. Smelled heavenly, tasted very good chilled.  We're in a heat wave now where I live, so this was refreshing to have cold for supper.

I absolutely love this salad and have made it a number of times.  I have followed the recipe at times and changed it up other  times depending what I have in the house.  The only constant change is I always add sliced grape tomatoes.  It is delicious and my family loves when I make it for parties.  Tastes great hot or cold and the flavor only gets better the next day.

We loved this recipe! Luckily we had everything but the feta on hand. I left out the olives and used vegetable broth in place of chicken broth. This turned out excellent! I'm not sure if I like it warm or cold, it is delicious both ways.

Delicious flavors. I used penne and served it hot - fantastic! Everyone loved it. I only used 1/2 the feta, which I thought was plenty. I cooked down the spinach too.

I kind of followed the recipe but used what I had in the house. I added left-over corn, grape tomatoes sliced in half, spanish olives, slivered almonds and an entire jar of salsa. 

The salsa changed the flavor and it turned out fantastic!

As a side dish, this does serve way more than 8 as others have said.

I skipped the kalamata olives (substituted regular black olives) and skipped the capers entirely. The salad was still salty and tangy without these additions.

Delicious recipe as otherwise posted. Tasty leftovers as well. Next time, I might add a bit more lemon juice.

Proportion of spinach is way too high.  Throws recipe off balance.  About a handful is right.  This recipe is a bit bland.

Really delish!  I added yellow bell peppers for some texture/crunch and cherry tomatoes for color.  Caution that capers made pretty salty but still really good dish. Makes quiet a bit, brought to small dinner party & host asked if she could keep my leftovers.

I've made this twice in the last month and given the recipes out to my friends who also loved it!  Only thing I suggest is cutting the amount of Feta in half.  I love feta but the amount called for in this recipe overpowers the other ingredients.

I just prepared this salad for our dinner tonight. It is delicious! Not sure if it will actually make it to the table. :) I cut the recipe in 1/2 as there are only 3 of us and it still made a alot. Only change I made was in cutting down the spinach, otherwise I followed the recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

This was an excellent, refreshing side dish!  Made this salad to go with salmon and a tossed green salad.  Skipped the pine nuts and the olives, since I didn't have them and don't care for them.  I used the juice of one whole lemon and used only 6 oz. of feta (12 oz.  seemed a bit much).  Also, I used 3 oz. of capers.

Delicious!  I'm not a huge fan of feta and added only 6 oz. instead of 12 and it was perfect.  I didn't change a thing.  After 3 days, I swear, it is getting better and better.

Okay, made this this afternoon, made myself not eat it for lunch, and had it with sanzoe's Caramelized Garlic Chicken....very good together! :) I followed the recipe exactly, but for guessing a bit on the capers(cus I only have a huge jar ;), and I didn't have basil feta, so I used plain, I didn't chop my spinach and I used fresh herbs, cus I had them.  None of the changes were significant enough to change the taste or texture of the dish, so I still feel fair in rating it high. :) Those herbs cooking with the pine nuts, garlic, pepper and oil smelled SOO good! :) So, this is a very original recipe, and I'm so glad to have tried it! :)

Made it for our garden club lunch.  It was well loved by everyone, recipe requested quite a few times.  I followed the recipe, but didn't cook orzo in chicken broth.  I just used salted water.  I did add some fresh basil and halved grape tomatoes.  I toast my pine nuts by rinsing in cold water very briefly in colander, then add 1/2 tsp. salt, put in paper bag and put in microwave on high for 1 - 2 minutes.  Quick and easy.  I also put the spinach in bottom of colander before I poured the orzo and cooking water over- instantly wilted.  I will definitely make this again.  In fact I'm making it this weekend for a picnic.

My family enjoyed this salad.  It makes A LOT, so use a big bowl.  Because of the volume I did not use all of the spinach the recipe called for, but it still turned out really good.

Instead of using butter to keep the orzo from sticking I used about 1 cup of premade pesto. That also added a really nice light green color to the salad. I would only use a 1/8 cup of olive oil to sauté the garlic basil thyme and red pepper flakes.Try sautéing these herbs on medium low as medium was a bit too high and browned the seasonings more than I like. Also, I doubled all of those seasonings since I like more spices in my dishes. I think it’s salty enough so I’m glad I didn’t add the juice from the capers. To add more color, I added one cup of quartered grape tomatoes. The taste of this salad is amazing! Serving it cold at a baby shower tomorrow, can’t wait to see what everybody thinks!

Excellent recipe. A little too salty as written. I used only one tablespoon of capers which worked well.

Save money by not using chicken stock. Use fresh herbs, oregano and rosemary, and regular feta cheese to turn this into a Greek salad.

I only had 6 oz of feta but 12 oz (two packages) would be better.  I only used about 6-8 oz of spinach and it was just right.  Great with some grilled chicken on top.  Would be delicious with some grape tomatoes.  Don't skip toasting the pine nuts- it adds so much.

It was pretty good. I initially made half the recipe since it was just for my husband and I. Ultimately, I ended up adding more red pepper flakes and basil. The Feta cheese was too salty for my taste, as I had never used it before. So i used very little cheese. Will definitely make it again.

My mom makes this several times over the summer. My father and son love it. My Mom is asked to make it for potlucks. She puts in diced tomatoes(1 contioner of grape tomatoes), and goat cheese instead of feta cheese.

I used vegetable broth and sliced almonds and added some fresh herbs.  Very nice side dish. With a salmon it was a complete meal.  Husband loves it!

Very tasty.  Could use a little more dressing. Will make again. My only problem was cooking the Orzo.  Recipes calls for 4 cups broth however the box of orzo states 4-6 quarts. Not really sure if the broth is necessary.

I have been making this salad for a long time - I usually throw in whatever I have on hand like artichokes or roasted red peppers. I don't always measure the ingredients but everyone who has it loves it. Thanks for a great recipe!

I have made this recipe at least a dozen times.  I always make it with fresh herbs and plain feta. I have made it with just the ingredients listed, but sometimes I add things like artichoke hearts, sun dried tomatoes, or lemon zest.  It tastes best If you make in the day before, although the fresh basil does get dark.  I usually halve it for just my husband and myself.  Fantastic recipe!

Absolutely amazing. My husband said that this is his favorite meal that I've ever made...and I cook quite a bit. My meal had a few changes...substituted quinoa for the orzo. Instead of spinach, I used romaine lettuce and also added cubed turkey at the end. Made enough for leftovers and can't wait to eat some today!

Great salad! I added half a cup of wild rice (cooked). No butter, no capers, no extra olive oil (except for a tiny bit to sauté the garlic). Added sun dried tomatoes, A LOT of spinach, roasted the pine nuts in the oven, kalamati olives, lemon and Girard's Greek salad dressing. Cooked the Orzo in chicken broth as recommended and it was fine.  Not too salty. Added the pepper flakes.  Waited to add Feta until salad was completely cooled.  Really excellent!

Meh. Used half the capers, no juice to keep it less salty, also cooked the orzo in 1/2 water, 1/2 broth. Nice universal base for orzo salad, but needs something extra, maybe sundried tomatoes to dress it up. Probably won't make again.

First let me say that this is a great side salad. Had it with pork loins tonight and it was well received. Now for the problems...4 cups of broth is not enough liquid for a whole box of orzo. I eyeballed it and ended up with 3/4 of a 16 oz box stirred into boiling broth. Pop the lid on and in 10 minutes or so we had no liquid left. Stirred it well several times while cooling down as well as throwing in the chopped baby spinach to let it wilt. Toasted the pine nuts dry and set them aside. Used the butter to help with sticking and added garlic flavored olive oil as well...just a drizzle. Let this cool down stirring every ten minutes or so. When cool add diced shallot, feta, olives and pine nuts. I also added some chopped grape tomatoes. This seemed dry after a few hours though not sticky. I did add a very small amount of Greek salad dressing and stirred it in. It added great flavor but kept the nongreasy texture. Makes a lot but will make good lunch.   Mikomine

This salad is a knock out - i've made it twice and it always disappears.   Good without pine nuts too.  Fresh spinach is better - but i have made it with frozen spinach.

This recipe was delicious.  I added sundried tomatoes and the presentation was lovely.  I will half this recipe in the future for family dinners with leftovers.  This recipe would be ideal to take to a potluck and will serve an army!  Thank you for this recipe.

This recipe is easily "dumbed down".  I decided to make it for an elementary school potluck picnic.  I took out the olives, capers & pinenuts.  It was still quite tasty and more "user friendly" for an unpredictable crowd.

I absolutely loved this recipe. I added 3 oz of capers and only 1/2 cup of olives as I am not a huge olive fan. I also substituted arugula for spinach as I had it on hand. I only used 8 oz of the feta, and it started as a block of cheese so I crumbled it as finely as possible. I would definitely make this again.

Woah, skip the chicken broth idea.  First of all, 4 cups of liquid is no where near enough to cook 1lb of orzo, and 2nd with all the other salty stuff, it's salt overload.  Maybe dilute the broth with 4qts of water.  Other than that, though, this is a tasty light healthy thing to eat, and I recommend it.  I bet its even better with the capers and pine nuts, which my grocery store didn't have.

This dish is always a hit wherever I bring it.  Even though I love kalamata olives, they tend to take over.  I like all of the subtle flavors so I usually don't put the olives in.  Sometimes I put the olives on the side.  My whole family loves this pasta salad.

What a refreshing salad!I too omitted the capers (personal preference) and used plain feta.  I didn't toss the orzo with butter after I cooked it and had no problems with it sticking.  Per other reviewers suggestions, I dry toasted the pine nuts.  Be careful when preparing the garlic.  Mine burned the first time, good thing I had extra!  I prepared mine early in the morning and served it later in the day.  I did have to add a very small amount of additional olive oil (about a tbs) because the pasta seemed to have soaked it up (maybe because I omitted the butter?) The flavors and texture were absolutely delicious! I might try fresh herbs next time.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe.  I will definitely be making this again.

Very good, but I didn't have enough feta, unfortunately. I did use some parmesan to fill in the gaps, but I think feta would have been best. I also didn't put in the spinach because my pan wouldn't fit it. Finally, I added roasted red peppers and it looked (and tasted) great! Enjoy.

I omitted the capers and pine nuts and used only 6 ounces feta. I found that 4 cups of broth was not enough and the orzo was drying out before it was done so i added a little water and it was fine. (i may have been cooking it too hot) Served with greek chicken from this site. This orzo is very flavorful and quite yummy. Will make again for sure.

My husband said to retire the old pasta salad recipe.  This had lots of flavor, as I followed the suggestion to let it sit for a day before eating.  I added caramelized onions and I swapped pine nuts for pumpkin seeds.
