This is good but I changed a few things. We don't use cumin because of food allergies with some family members and my family doesn't like black beans so I used pinto beans instead and I use 3 T. dehydrated cilantro, 2 tsp. minced garlic(1 for meatballs-1 for tomatoes sauce) plus 2 tsp. shallots divided the same way. I used chopped green chile tomatoes that I ran through the blender for a sauce to put them in after I cooked them and then place in the crock pot to keep it warm. My family and friends most have liked them because none were left that evening.

The meatballs were moist and tasty.  After 20 minutes there was 3/8 inch of water in the pan.  I drained the water and put them back in the oven for 10 minutes to brown up a bit.

I didn't use the sauce as the color was not what I want to eat!  Just half the ingredients: yogurt and salsa

Flavor was great but it fell apart like crazy and stuck to the pan terribly.
