I have a question for the submitter:

Would this by chance be from the Northwestern Steakhouse in Mason City, IA?

If it is, you are my new best friend.  :)

A winner! Hubby loved this one and he's my toughest critic when it comes to what goes on his meat besides S&P. This was really good. I was going to have my husband charcoal this but he didn't have enough so I cooked this on the stove top in my favorite cast iron skillet. This would have been better had I used a better cut of meat than just an inexpensive round steak. I'm looking forward to having this on the grill next time. Thanks!!!  3-29-09 UPDATE: Hubby grilled some NY Strips and these were the BEST EVER! Steak house quality for sure. I was informed this is OUR new steak and everything else seasoning for evermore so don't lose the recipe. I agreed with my husband, this is FABULOUS!!! CAUTION: These will flare up when you place them on the grill. Apparently impressively enough for hubby to excitedly come in and ask me what I put in the "exploding steak" marinade?

Wow, fantastic!  I used Emeril's Steak Rub since I was out of Greek seasoning, and it was great (I'm sure any seasoning combo you like would work just fine).  The BUTTER is the key ingredient here.  I would never have thought of trying it this way.  I pour this over steaks in a ziploc a day or two ahead and then set on the counter about 20 mins prior to grilling.  I use a gas grill and let it heat on hi about 10 mins, then reduce to medium and add the steaks.  It will flare like crazy, so keep an eye on things (but, unless it's obviously badly burning, don't pull the steak off the fire since that gives it great flavor).  After a couple mins, I turn the steaks 90 degrees to get the nice grill marks.  After a couple more minutes I flip and repeat on the second side.  Be aware that whatever temp you use, the steaks will cook more quickly due to the flaring.  FWIW, medium thickness steaks take about 8 mins total on medium setting on my grill to reach medium doneness.  Once removed to plates, we top each steak with a very thin pat of butter, tiny sprinkle of kosher salt and fresh cracked black pepper, then cover with foil and let rest about 5 mins to let the juices reabsorb.  I can't speak to other cuts, but for ribeyes (we look for ones with nice marbling, which always helps) -- absolute perfection!  Thanks so much for sharing, Jetta! :)

Love it!  I was wondering if anybody had any tips as far as when you pour the mixture/roll the steaks in it.  The butter hardens almost immediately after touching the steaks as well as when you pull the steaks out to BBQ.  I ended up breaking a bunch of the marinade up and sprinkling it onto the steaks.  Still turned out great, but looking for tips!

The restaurant from which this recipe originated is known for their AMAZING meals in North Iowa.  I've had this recipe for years but have honestly never 'marinaded' with it.  Usually, I mix this up & pop in immediately into the oven.  I use it mostly with chicken breast & pork chops & it never fails to produce unbelievable meals.  We seldom buy steaks, but got some real good petite sirlions at a great price & decided to make the "real thing."   I did allow to marinade for about 5 hrs prior to grilling (again, I usually just bake my chops for about 45 mins @ 350) Ooolaalaa, Yummynummy!   I took a large sheet of foil & folded the sides up to create a pan-like area, flipped the meat onto the the foil (marinaded in a 9x13(had enough meat I had to double the recipe) & solidified into a perfect rectangle that I flipped onto foil & then placed foil on grill) The meat 'cooked' in it's juices as well as marinade, flavor explodes. At the restaurant, they also use this warmed sauce over spaghetti noodles.  I love it also stirred into my mashed potatoes that I serve with the meal or bread dipped into it.  Oh, the uses are endless & alway delicious.  Anyway you make any kind of meat with this recipe, marinaded or not, it always turns out so tender, juicy & out of this world!

This is really good. My greek seasoning had both salt and garlic in it, so I skipped those 'pinches' of this and that. I used it on flat iron steaks and sea scallops. I hit them with a little lemon at the end, which woke everything up a bit - so that might be worth a try for you, as well. Thanks for the recipe - we'll use it again. ;)

Wonderful! A keeper! Like someone else stated, the butter hardens on cold meat. Rachael Ray says let meat 'rest' 20 minutes before cooking it to allow the muscle structure to relax to lessen toughness; so that may help, I'll try that next time. We just melted the extra butter marinade as Hubby turned the steaks on the grill. They did cause flare up, but no burning, so don't get too worried. Taste is just like the high-end steak houses, cause they use BUTTER!!!  Yummy!

Really good!  I softened the butter (rather than melting) and mixed in the rest so I could rub it into the steaks.  I let them set at room temp for about 20-30 minutes before cooking them in a grill pan.  I did use montreal steak seasoning in place of the greek seasoning (I was out), but will try it the way it is posted soon. I used this on thin cut  six New York strips to make sandwiches.  Simple and delicious.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!!

This was wonderful! My whole family loved it. I couldn't find Greek seasoning at the store so I made my own using one on AR. I used nonstick foil on the grill and turned the edges up so I wouldn't have flare ups. The steaks were perfect; a little crispy on the edges and juicy in the middle. I grilled them on medium for about 5-7 min on each side. I also saved about a third of the marinade to brush on the steaks while I grilled them. Definitely will make again.

I thought this was pretty good, but my wife especially loved it. We will definitely use this recipe again. The butter is a steak twist I had not used until today. Do note that these steaks are particularly susceptible to flare up when grilling, because of the butter. Be prepared.

Best steak marinade I have tried. So juicy and moist! I broiled it in the oven  (it's too cold to grill) and I haven't invested in a cast iron pan yet...I can only imagine what this tastes like grilled. My fiance said it was better than Ruth Chris! I used a New York Strip. THANK YOU for this recipe!

This is an excellent marinade.  I didn't have any greek spice so I used a mixture of oregano, theme, marjoram, basil and onion powder - everything else was as written.  It was terrific.  I served the steaks with Devil's Steak Sauce (a recipe also on the allrecipes.com site)

Wow! This marinade is restaurant quality taste! I've used this recipe over 10 times now.  I only use round bottom steak, slice it up to about 1" - 1.5" thick, marinade for 3-4 hrs then sear each sides before putting into a slow cooker on high for 20-30mins. Meat comes out tender and juices to top of meat and mashed potatoes! Thank you JETTABLONDE72 for the recipe!

Okay but not a marinade. The flavor was bold and delicious when I made it but I "marinated" my steak for four hours and it added no extra flavor. As a matter of fact, the second you place the melted butter on the cold steak, the butter becomes hard. The flavor does not seem to permeate at all. When I put the steaks on the grill, the butter melted, dripped off with my delicious herbs :(!

A totally awesome marinade!  Quick and easy. Our steaks were pierced with a fork to absorb the flavors.  As stated by other reviewers the butter does tend to solidify again.  To remedy this, we placed the marinating pan on a slightly warm stove element or you could possible place in a warm oven. Will definitely be making this recipe again with no changes to the ingredients other than trying other types of seasonings.

I stumbled across this searching for a steak marinade that didn't include worchestershire sauce, as we are out.  WITHOUT prompting, Mr. LTH said, "This is the best steak marinade we've had yet.  Make it again.  Please."  That's high praise and makes this a keeper, for sure.  Mr. LTH grilled our NY Strips to perfection and we ate them w/some grilled onions and peppers and baked potatoes for a fantastic meal.  Thanks for the recipe, JETTABLONDE72!

Delicious! Ive made this a few times now and have found it is much easier to soften the butter rather than melt it since it does turn into a jelly once the hot butter hits the cool meat

All I can say is "WOW."  This marinade is absolutely superb.  I made this marinade with the "Greek Seasoning" recipe from All recipes and this was the BEST STEAK I have had in a LONG LONG time.  Literally, every bite is memorable and wonderful.  I used a skirt steak, which made the steak more tender.  I marinated the skirt steak (about 1 lb) 6-7 hours.  I took the steak out of the refridgerator to warm for about 20 minutes at room temperature.  After 20 minutes, I crushed some fresh pepper onto the steak and put the steak in the broiler for 3 minutes on one side and 4 minutes on the other side.  This is AMAZING.  I will repeat this recipe and I am so glad that someone thought this recipe up!!!!  W-O-W.  I only wish I bought more steak meat!

To add a wow factor, you have to use crushed garlic.  One of my chronic complaints (if you read my reviews) is that the amount of seasonings are too skimpy!  Hubs thought the steaks were bland in taste.  I had a feeling, though I enjoyed mine as I found the butter to be savory.  So I'm rating it as written with the exception of the crushed garlic I used instead of garlic powder (which is never in my repertoire).  I liked the concept, especially with the butter.  Oh, be sure to watch the grill for flare ups.

Very good! I halved the butter b/c I was only making 2 steaks, but kept all of the other ingredients the same, maybe using a bit more than a 'pinch' of seasoned salt and garlic powder. Oh, and I didn't have greek seasoning, so I used Montreal Steak Seasoning instead. I was cooking my steaks in a pan on the stovetop, so I mixed the marinade ingredients together, and poured some into the hot pan. Then I added the steaks and poured the rest of the marinade over them. They were very flavorful and something I would definitely make again! Thanks for sharing. :)

These were delicious! My grill had no gas so I pan fried instead then tranfered it on a plate and covered w/ foil for 8-10 minutes. My daughter thought it was teensy bit salty so maybe cut it down a bit. I had no problems with it.

I didn't have greek seasoning, I used Adobo and garlic powder and pepper a pinch of each. I used liquid chicken broth with the butter. Marinated for 20 min. Put on grill as told. Heated up remainder of marinade and added it on grill. I used what I had and it worked really good. I'll make sure to get the other stuff and try it again.

Solid!!! This is really so good!!!  I have tried it twice and liked it best with a little more than a pinch of garlic powder.  It really tastes like a steak house steak!!!  Very tender results. Thank You for sharing!
**Update:  I tried it on a pork chop and it tasted like I was eating a steak**

Marinated thin-cut rib eye steaks for about 8 hours and pan grilled them. This recipe is a home run. Great flavor.  I used the Greek Seasoning recipe on AR as suggested by another reviewer.  Cannot wait to try it on a roast.

We really enjoy this marinade.  I used it on a London Broil and it added great flavor.  When it was time to prepare it  - my husband heated a cast iron skillet on the grill and when it was very hot I put the steak and the solidified marinade on the skillet.  Using this method, all of the marinade stayed with the steak rather than going all over the grill.  There was enough in the skillet that he basted the steak as it cooked.  A great tasting and flavorful recipe that I would definitely use again.  Served this with grilled Romaine and a cast iron skillet of grilled potatoes, peppers and onion.

Followed the recipe to a "T".  It was ok but it didn't knock our socks off. We used this on two Delmonico steaks and sliced mushrooms on the grill. The flavor was barely noticeable IMHO. We also had a couple grocery store marinated satay beef kabobs and those blew this stuff away. Oh well. To each her own. Maybe we can change up the seasonings next time if we try it again.

I thought this was a pretty good steak marinade.  I'm not sure if it knocked my socks off enough to justify the calories, but for a rare occasion, I would consider it.  The steak came out tender and mildly, but pleasantly seasoned.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, JETTABLONDE72!

This was good, but didn't WOW us.  I used it on a 1.5 lb. flat iron steak.  I cut the butter back to 4 T. and still thought it was excessive.  I softened my butter, rather than melting it so it would adhere to the meat, which it did nicely.  Be sure to pat your meat dry so the butter is easier to spread.  All in all, this was tasty, but nothing exceptional.

We had my family and my husband's family drive up from Florida for my daughter's 1st birthday and I wanted to make something special for everyone and this did the trick and then some. I marinaded kabob beef overnight in this recipe. Followed it to the T...well I don't like to use measurement so I guesstimated the amounts but it turned out AMAZING anyway. My husband I loved it so much we're actually marinading steaks right now to grill tonight for dinner. I can't give this recipe enough stars!!

Followed the recipe just as described and the family just gobbled up the steaks. I let mine marinate for 4 -5 hours, grilled each side for three minutes and finished off in the oven. Great recipe and easy to use.

I had 2 very thin cut t-bones and I smeared the softened butter mixture over (using only 1 tbls of butter for 2 steaks).  The flavor was delicious.  I cooked on a cast iron grill pan for about 2 1/2 minutest per side, perfectly cooked and great flavor.  Thanks for this recipe and next I'd like to try it on chicken.

This was great.  I used the greek seasoning recipe from AR, and the flavor was really good.  I needed a soy-free marinade recipe, and while it doesn't tenderize as much, I think it would be excellent on a nice cut of steak, and it was still good on the ranch steaks we had.  My husband thought we made way too much, but my boys gobbled up every last bite and wanted more.  Thanks for the recipe!

Used this marinade on butterfly chops and then cooked them on the grill and they were great.

The flavor was fantastic. Ribeyes were a little tough so I would maybe use meat tenderizer next time. Tasted just like the ones at my favorite steakhouse.

Very good marinade. I tried to sear the meat before baking it, but I used a nonstick pan so it didnt work too well.  But the steak was still tasty.

What the reviewers say is true...what a delightful (and easy) marinade.  This is a wonderful way to make a steak extremely flavorful in seconds.  Throw away the A1 - you'll never need it again.  Thank you for such a great recipe!

This was great!  I wasn't sure what to think about it at first because steak marinades I've used in the past put more flavor in the steak.  This one allows your cut of beef to shine through.  I used it on 2 ribeyes.  I was serving "Herbed Greek Roasted Potatoes with Feta Cheese" (also on allrecipes.com and also very good) as a side and crumbled some of the leftover feta on top of the steaks as well.

Very easy & Delicious. My hubby loved it and so did the kids. I had some mediocre cuts that was given to us. I really wasn't looking foward to even wasting my time cooking them. But this marinade made it all worthwhile. No leftovers. Also poured remaining marinade over some pre made burgers I had to cook up. Made them 100 x better than just the plain burger.

Why not marinate steaks in butter?! Ha!  These steaks were great - we grilled them for out first cookout of the year!  Did not disappoint!
