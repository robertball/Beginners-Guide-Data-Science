this was a great dessert! The presentation was lovely and the flavors elegent! I recomend using more wine and less water for the sake of saving time when reducing. I used ground spices in a tea bag and just eyeballed the measurments but reduced the amount of cardomom asked for by half and it was delish! If you dont have time to let the pears cool, the freezer works great!! Lastly, rolling the chocolate covered pears in almonds didnt turn out. Sprinkle the almonds on and then carefully press them in.  This recipe is great!! Will do again!!

I really don't know what to say about this recipe. I couldn't even find some of these ingredients in the local grocery stores, so I left a lot of it out. I haven't tasted it yet, but my friend said it came out great. I suppose, we shall see. 3 stars for the recipe's potential.

While this recipe tasted good, it was a lot of work and didn't turn out as well as I would have liked (& that could have been my fault).  The chocolate did not adhere to the poached pear very well & then trying to roll them in the almonds resulted in chocolate coming off & almonds not adhering.
