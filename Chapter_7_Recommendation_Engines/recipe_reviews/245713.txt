I love this! I wanted a bit of veggies in it so I added a bit of red pepper and onion to it. They added to the delicious flavour. Nice change of pace from straight old  eggs and bacon.

Fast, easy and very straight forward.  If you fold the tortilla into fourths it made a nice pocket for breakfast on the go.

Good variation on breakfast for dinner. We are not fans of American cheese, so we substituted cheddar instead. We also made fresh pico de gallo for this.

Corn tortillas for tacos and flour tortillas for burritos.  I make this often for breakfast.  I especially like a bacon and egg burrito with rice added.  Sprinkle the rice with a little vinegar for a bright surprise.  It really brings out the flavors.

Made this as a treat for my boyfriend since it was so simple. He's been begging me every day this week to make it again for him so this  recipe will be a keeper.

This is a whole lot easier than making breakfast burritos. I love how it turned out. It's super delicious.

Nothing special.  Could have made it without a recipe.
