This was incredibly simple, yet moist and delicious.  I made the recipe exactly as directed, but also added a good smearing (perhaps 1/4 cup) of seedless raspberry preserves between the layers.  I topped it with strawberries and raspberries, and it disappeared in no time.  I will definitely make this again!

This was very good. I served it for a church function at my house and I decorated it with cool whip and strawberries, kiwis, and mandarin oranges. Everyone was really impressed at how pretty it was. I definitely recommend this, but not by itself. The flavor's a little lacking unless you add to it with the presentationg. Other than that, we enjoyed this!

A very pretty torte and it tastes good too.  I used strawberries on top...might consider using them on the middle layer also.

Easy to make, and looks great with fresh berries on top. I used raspberries and the cake looked great! My cake turned out a tad dry, but likely my oven probably required less time than the 22 minutes recommended here. Would definitely make it again!

This cake disappeared from the fridge instantaneously. Everyone loved it! Although, I only used one cup of whipped topping because I thought two is too much, but I was wrong. The thicker the whipped topping in the middle, the better. I'm definitely going to make this again. :)

This torte was great plain!  I used white whole wheat flour and all purpose flour and 1/2 c splenda and 1/2 c sugar...no fruit, just a great plain chocolate cake!
