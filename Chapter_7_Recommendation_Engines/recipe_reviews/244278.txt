My eldest daughter said the submitter of this recipe is a genius-the rest of the family agrees! This is a delicious and fresh mix of flavours. I made bbq ranch for the kids and made Sriracha ranch for the adults then invited some jalape√±os to the party. Thank you tcasa for this recipe

Easy to make 5 star recipe whether you use it as a meal or an appetizer. I used all buffalo ranch, a mixture of Sriracha and Ranch dressing. Use a pizza cutter to make slices.
