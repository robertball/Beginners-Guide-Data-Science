I found the banana a bit overpowering.  If I make this again I will use only half a frozen banana to balance out the blueberry flavoring.

I used unfrozen bananas so added some ice to make it colder. Also, milk instead of water. A little sea salt, vanilla, and honey.

This was delicious!  I had fresh blueberries, so I used those instead of frozen. I will make this again!

The Smoothie Queen did it again by creating yet another delicious, vitamin filled, and dairy free smoothie with a perfect balance of flavors. I used a mix of frozen berries instead of just blueberries. Thank you, Alli, for the recipe!

I will make it again but add more coconut. I used frozen cherries instead of blueberries, and it turned out very good!

7.26.18  Used cherries instead of blueberries and used  coconut chips instead of flaked coconut.  This was very good, but I think that next time I’ll use cashew butter (just a personal taste preference).  Just returned from a trip to the Pacific Northwest where cherries are in season.  I ate my share while there, but I’m planning to take advantage of those scrumptious cherries for as long as I can find them here.
