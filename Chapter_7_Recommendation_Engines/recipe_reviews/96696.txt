I used to make this all the time, minus the sugar and honey.  Just 3 or 4 slices of ginger in a little bit of boiling water (for a single serving) for a few minutes and it's ready.  Don't fret over measurements,  you can make this as strong or as light as you want.  This "tea" is the bomb!

This was recommended to me several months back when I was really ill and needed something other than tea to feel better. This is great for almost any illness, even morning sickness. The ginger settles any upset stomach and the honey coats the throat. This is great stuff. Sometimes, I'll add sliced lemons to the hot "tea".

I'm not crazy about this one.  I love ginger, brown sugar, and honey, however, a whole cup of brown sugar was way too much.  You couldn't even taste the ginger anymore.  My suggestion would be to cut the brown sugar down by half.

This doesn't need so much sugar.  It is great for opening up the sinuses.  Boil it even longer to spice it up.

MMMMMMMMMM! Warm, soothing and good! My only advice is to adjust the brown sugar and honey to your tastes, otherwise it's a bit on the sweet side. Thank you CC for making my sore throat feel better!

This is delicious and sooo healthy!  I add a little bit of half and half to give it a little creamy flavor.  I also grate my ginger, it comes out a little stronger and you wont have to use as much.

I make this just because I like it, although I am sure it is soothing for throats and stomachs.  I do not add any sweetener because I am diabetic.  One point: ginger is good for regulating blood sugar levels.  As far as sweetness goes, I guess it's like tea - we Southerners tend to like it sweeter, but this is really good unsweetened, too.  
Be sure to try this tea iced, too.  In the summer I keep a pitcher of water with ginger slices in the fridge.  It's very refreshing!

This is my go to illness cure. I only use 1/2 cup of brown sugar and add some lemon at the end. Perfect!

This tea was really good and easy to make. The second time I made it I did this though because it was to sweet and tasted  funny: 
1. Put 3 or 4 slices of Ginger in a cup.
2. Put white sugar in to your taste.
3. Pour boiling water over it.
4. Stir and remove the Ginger.
It was very good!  : )

much too sweet. Not sure if I'm digging the brown sugar/honey flavor with the ginger, either. I think I'll try again and just add a dollop of honey straight into my cup after brewing the water and ginger. no sugar needed!  (Lemon brightens it, too!)

going to have to try this.  Ginger is great for upset stomachs.  Or for fighting off morning sickness!

5 stars without the sugar- I made it with only 2 tbs honey and it was still sweet. 1 c seems like an insane amount of sugar.

I scooped a couple tablespoons of Orange Juice concentrate into an oversized mug and then stirred in 1 1/2 cups of the Ginger drink (made with 1/2 the brown sugar)

I had an upset tummy and since ginger is good for that, I tried this for the first time today.  I used only half the amount of sugar called for, and next time will cut it even more -- but it was delicious, warming, and just what my tummy needed.   It's so simple, I wonder why I didn't think of it myself.  It's a definite keeper.

I hate ginger however, this was very tasty.  My husband needed something because he was "cold" he also really enjoyed this. The brown sugar was cut by a 1/2 cup.

I'm sorry, but I thought this was terrible, and I love ginger! I recommend sticking with tea. I have a terrible sore throat today, and I couldn't finish the mug I poured myself.
