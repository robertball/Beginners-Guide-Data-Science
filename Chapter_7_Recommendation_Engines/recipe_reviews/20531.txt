Nice pickles, thanks!  I canned them, which is why I'm just now reviewing them.  We still have tons of pickles from last summer's canning sessions!  I enjoy these, and they aren't too difficult, but I have to say that our house prefers Bread and Butter Pickles II on this site to these.   I think it may be the addition of peppers to the others as well as the different spices that makes it for us, but we still enjoy these a lot.  Very sweet, good pickles for sandwiches or burgers.  The onions in these are pretty good too.  Thanks for the recipe!

Wish I had processed these so that I could enjoy them longer. I really prefer that vinegar bite. Thought this recipe was a prefect balance between sweet and tart. Will definitely make these again.

This tasted great, even after one a couple of days in the jar. I'm sure it would have been better after a couple of weeks. I did use garlic powder because it turned out my garlic was spoiled.  Next time I would use less onion because the ratio of onion to cucumbers was not like I liked. I also used powdered cloves because my whole cloves were not to be found. I sliced celery instead of celery seed because the store was out.  My 5-year old granddaughter loved it so much I sent a couple of jars home with her. Changes or not it was excellent. I made another batch with fewer onions and plan on making more this summer.

Well I just canned these it was an easy recipe however I changed it just a bit.  Couldn't find some of the spices it called for so I used pickling spice and then followed the recipe. Then I used the larger mason jars (1liter) so when filling only 1/2 the jar with vinegar mixture then topping off with hot water.... And I will wait an additional 2 wk or so before tasting

The recipe was very easy.  However, they were not sweet enough for me.  I am going to make these again, but will add more sugar this time.  Too vinegary for Bread and Butter pickles how my mom made them.  :)

It was too salty, I would cut the salt at least by half if I made again.

I really liked the tangy flavor. The only thing I changed was the amount of salt.The first batch was way to salty for my family. I cut the salt in half and it was great. We really liked the flavor the tumeric added.

I was looking for a recipe close to one my Mamma use to make, and this one hit the pickle!  Mamma's pickles always got the blue ribbon at the county fair, and once I finally let theses set up they sure were close to her blue ribbon.  Thank you for bringing back such a great memory.  I did add a little sprig of fresh dill into each jar, just like Mamma did. ??
