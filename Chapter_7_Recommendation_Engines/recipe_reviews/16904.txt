Perfect combination of spices and herbs! I replaced pasta with 2 medium size patatos though.

I wasn't a fan of split pea soup until I found this recipe - this soup is delicious!  The chipotle chili powder adds a nice kick.  I cook this on the stovetop since I don't have a pressure cooker.  I usually puree half the soup once it's finished cooking so it's smooth but still has a little bit of texture.  Also, I leave out the orzo because I think the soup is perfect without it.

TRY THIS on the stovetop w/out pressure cooker and without soaking!  It's easy and tastes better than anything in a can!  Skipped the pasta, too.  Great.

This soup tasted pretty good, but I would leave the pasta out next time.  It was really thick.  I pureed most of it and I might puree less of it next time.

This soup was good, though a bit spicier than I anticipated since I'd never used the dried chipotle chile pepper (which I found in the spice aisle).  I would cut way back on the chipotle if I made it again since my kids wouldn't eat it due to the spicy nature.  My husband and I thought it was tasty though.

I made this with yellow split peas instead of green since that's what I had.  We don't have a pressure cooker so I did it on the stove-top -- the peas cook quickly anyway -- it was ready in about an hour.  The changes I made:  I sauted the veggies in 2 tblsps of olive oil on med heat until they were a bit soft then added the dried herbs for 2 more minutes.  I also used 1/2 chipotle in adobe rather than the dried.  It was excellent; definitely a keeper!

Very good recipe, I love the chipotle flavoring! I did this a crock pot for about 9 hours, half on high, half on low temp and it turned out great. I stil fryed the vegetables for 5 minutes first and I cooked the orzo seperately and then added it.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  We agree with a previous reviewer that this is the best split pea soup we've ever tasted.  It is shockingly delicious for so few ingredients.  It was very simple to make.  

I used ground ancho chile pepper because that is what I had, and it worked well.  I would like to try the chipotle at some point.  I like the orzo in there, but it is not necessary.

Majority of reviewers did not use a pressure cooker. Please don't review a pressure cooker recipe, if you are not using a pressure cooker and following the recipe as it is written.  It kind of defeats the purpose of reviews.  If you changed the recipe, then submit your own recipe.

Followed recipe but tasted it and it was too bland.  So started adding spices...onion power, garlic salt and powder, cumin, curry...I didn't even measure...just added and tasted until tasted good. Also did not add the pasta.

This was an easy recipe I opted to use my slow cooker for this recipe.  I presoaked the split peas for about one hour before to help them along, I followed the instructions as they were, and cooked the veggies, after that step I put all the remaining ingredients into my preheated slow cooker.  I added an additional cup of vegetable broth and 2 boullion cubes.  I liked the heat of the chipotle, but not the smokiness, in the future I would omit that ingredient and add cayenne instead.  I cooked the soup for about 6 hours on a high setting.

It's not bad. I kinda like the spicy indian version of this recipe. Check out http://aamircooks.blogspot.com/2009/12/spicy-split-pea-soup.html. No pressure cooker required!

This was good, but I felt the pasta took away from the flavor.  Next time, I'll skip the pasta and increase the split pea.  I also let it simmer in a dutch oven for about 4 hours so it was nice and creamy.

Awesome recipe. Very easy and great for a busy mom. I skipped the pasta and substituted with potatoes. I also skipped celery and the broth since I didn't have any on hand. Instead, I put water and some all-purpose seasoning (may be a tbsp). My 10 mths old had this too so I skipped the chile pepper as well. It was still yummy and SO easy to make! Definitely a keeper in our family. Thank you!

I don't have a pressure cooker, so I left it in my crock pot for a couple hours on low and that worked well, just had to add more liquid.  We had it for last night's dinner and I couldn't wait to have leftovers for lunch today!

mmm. i really love this recipe! i did not use the pasta and subbed two potatoes.  I also added a poblano pepper just because I happened to have one. make this one the stove top and the slow simmer will make your mouth water all day as it cooks. I pureed 3/4 of it so it was more creamy with some chunks.  Eat with a hunk of rustic bread and a beer. Yum!

Very good recipe.  This is the first time I've ever made split pea soup and will most likely use this recipe again.  Like other users, I substituted two medium potatoes for the orzo and I used a slow cooker.  Instead of the dried chipotle chile pepper, I used 2 tablespoons of jarred mixed hot peppers, which worked perfectly fine.  

I cooked mine down too much (overnight, even on "Low," is way too long to leave this in a slow cooker) so I just added some extra broth.  It had a stew-like texture when it was all said and done so we served it with a dollup of sour cream, which I'd HIGHLY recommend.

Easy recipe to make.  Did not have the Chipolte chili seasoning so substituted Chili Powder.  It was mild and easy to eat.  I will try it again when I get the Chipolte seasoning.  I like it.

I have never liked split pea soup but my husband does so decided to try and doctor it up for me.  I used smoked turkey leg for seasoning.  Pulled the meat off, added smoked paprika, more garlic, and added a cup of half and half and 3 Tbs. flour for thickening.  It was delicious and we both loved it!

This was a great split pea soup.  Like a few other reviewers, I left out the orzo, and added a couple of diced potatoes, because we are big potato fans at our house.  Otherwise, I made the recipe almost exactly as written (on the stovetop, though).  I didn't have the chipotle chili powder on hand, so I subbed 1 teaspoon of smoked paprika for the smokiness, and 1 teaspoon of sriracha hot sauce for the heat (any hot sauce would have worked, I think).  I think this gave a pretty good approximation of the chipotle chili peppers, which only added to what I thought was a perfect balance of peas, liquid, and vegetables that was indicated by the recipe writer.  Delicious!

I misread the instructions and added the orzo to the soup before cooking in the pressure cooker so it came out as solid mush...and we still ate it all! That’s how great the flavor is. Can’t wait to make it again, the correct way.

Every recipe a person is nice enough to share with others is, to me, a base for each cook's creativity. That's what makes it fun. So...my changes to this recipe...ditalini pasta instead of orzo;  1/4 pound of chopped mushrooms sauteed with other vegetable; 1/4 tsp of Penzey's Florida Pepper seasoning added a little zing. To the vegetable broth, I added a "not chicken" chicken bouillon. Oh, and I only had yellow split peas. Very Good!!

I left out the pasta. The chipotle peppers smoky/ spicey flavour made the recipe.

Everything came out great except for the taste!
If you looking for something extremely spicy this is your soup otherwise leave the chipotle pepper out. As far as I'm concerned it completely ruins the split pea soup and creates a flavor a split pea soup should never have.
It ruins the split pea soup!

Absolutely wonderful. I picked this recipe to try out my new pressure cooker and I loved it. My husband raved about it and thought it was the orzo that made the difference

I did not have pasta and live to far from a store.  I used Rice instead and it was perfect.  Hubby liked it and that is all that matters.  Will definitely make again. Thank you!

This sup was delicious. I couldn't find the orzo, s used farfallini instead, and cooked it on the stove top instead of in a pressure cooker. This soup is hearty and healthy, and I will make it again. Thanks!

GREAT soup! You can't mess it up, I know, I tried. I didn't have a pressure cooker so I put it in the CROCK POT on low, which was a mistake. After 1 hour I put it on HIGH, for 1 hour or something like that. I also skipped the orzo, and substituted cauliflower for celery. Thanks!

Great recipe. Because of the kids I omitted the pepper, added 2 bay leaves instead. Sautéed the veggies staight in the pressure cooker, no need to use a separate pan.  Everyone loved it.

Great stuff! I cut the recipe in half the first time...it's just amazing and it's a keeper! It comes out of the pressure cooker with just the right thickness, no need to puree at all. Thank you for sharing it!
