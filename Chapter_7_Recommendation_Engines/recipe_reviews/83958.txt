Took this recipe to a mexican potluck and it was received well.  I kept the meat sauce aside until just before serving.

Actually, the hubby made this one for us. Sorry Lawry's, but we used homemade Taco Seasoning I from this site. We browned the meat with a chopped onion. We used the bagged shredded lettuce. He placed this in formed taco shells for us. We then could build our taco salad as we wanted with the ingredients listed. Also, we used Fat Free Shredded Cheese and had Fat Free Sour Cream. Yum!!
