OMG this is one awesome salad! I love tomato bread salads, but grilling it is genious and gives everything a smoky flavor that's "to die for". I mixed my olive oil with a bit of garlic, salt, and Italian seasoning. I brushed that over the red onion and plum tomatoes. My bread was already stale (which I highly recommend vs. using fresh). Instead of cubing it and skewering it I cut it in half lengthwise and brushed it with the olive oil mixture and placed it directly on the grill. Not only does it work with the salad, but it makes one heck of a delicious garlic bread! I left out the cucumber as I didn't feel it really belong. To assemble the salad I didn't really chop anything I just layered the ingredients and whisked the red wine vinegar with the olive oil and drizzled that over top.  Then sprinkled the finished product with chopped fresh basil and some shredded Parmesan cheese.  Next time I think I'll add some fresh mozzarella cheese to take this over the top! This makes a fabulous appetizer or side dish. I could have made a meal out of this all by itself - perfect with a glass of wine! Thanks for a great recipe!

Pretty good salad! This is the first time we eat tomato bread salad and we liked it! I scaled the recipe down to 4 servings,for the bread I only had 2 stale French sandwich rolls and it workd out pretty good! so I assume you can use any bread you have available, I also added about 4 oz. of cubed mozzarella Mmmmmm! Thanks lstevenson! Elvira Silva.

This is one of my favorite summer salads!  If you don't have fresh bread on hand try using frozen garlic bread.

When I make this I don't grill the tomatoes. Instead I chop them and save the juice, add to a bowl with chopped cucumber and salt and pepper them. I then grill the bread (thick slices instead of skewered is easier), some bell peppers, and some onions. I also use balsamic vinegar.

yummy!  i didn't have fresh basil, so i added dried basil to the seasonings and olive oil for the bread.  i just tossed the bread in the pan i use for grilling vegetables, didn't bother with skewers, and it worked great. i would recommend waiting to toss in the dressing until you are nearly ready to serve, the bread got a little soggy as it sat.

I broiled instead of grilled, and it turned out well.

After watching The Grill Masters competition on "Chopped" today, I was inspired to try something new and adventurous. I used produce from our co-op and sourdough bread from the day-old rack. I loved this!
