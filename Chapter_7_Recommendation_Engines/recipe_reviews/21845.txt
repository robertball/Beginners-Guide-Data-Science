Super simple to make & such a huge hit with everyone who tried it. I did modify it a tad. I used 6 eggs instead of just 4. I also thought that adding meat was a great idea so I cooked up some ground turkey with taco seasoning mix. Delicious! This one is definitely a keeper.

This was a great quick n' easy recipe. My husband loves jalapenos and it was hard to find something that I could make quickly. He and his friends inhaled this souffle. I did end up using only 7 ounces of jalapenos and added 1/2 pound of sausage. I tried to make it less spicy so I could enjoy it as well but even with the less jalapenos it was still four-alarm!! Great...will definitely make this again!

Not bad but it definitely needs salt and pepper. I also whisk a splash of milk into the eggs to make them a little lighter and fluffier. To make it more of a meal I add some browned and drained chorizo sausage. Good stuff. Thanks Bryan!

I'm very happy with this - it's flexible and makes a tasty easy brunch for me - actually I'm eating it for dinner right now! Wanted something light but spicy. I love jalapenos and cheese so gave this a shot. This is actually not a souffle but more of a quiche. I like this better because the quiche allows me to freeze or reheat leftovers to bring for breakfast at work. I used a greased 2 qt souffle mold 4 jumbo sz eggs cheddar cheese and only 7 oz can of jalapenos. That was enough to put plenty of jalapeno in every bite. Suggest adding eggs and/or adjust jalapeno amounts to suit personal tastes.

Good but mine came out too skinny. I'll add more eggs next time. I chopped the jalapenos & mixed everything together. Good easy breakfast.

a little bland but im sure it wouldnt be hard to flavor this up. its a good starting point. a few drops of franks helped.
