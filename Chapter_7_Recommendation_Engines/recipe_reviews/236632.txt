I was looking for a yummy casserole using a center cut ham. Found this and me & my girls LOVE it! The combination of alfredo, garlic & Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese is just fabulous. I agree the 30 min cooking time isn't enough for this dish, however everything else was perfect. Thanks for sharing this awesome dish.

This has great potential but the baking time & amount of sauce is way off.  These needed at least 1 hour at 400.   The top was brown and they looked done at 30 minutes but the potatoes were not cooked through.  I returned them to the oven, tented with foil to prevent further browning for another 30 minutes.  3 cups of Alfredo sauce was too much for the amount of potatoes.  The bottom of the dish was swimming in sauce.  The flavor was really good and with a few changes these would be great.

I made this with 4 cheese Alfred sauce from a jar. It was very tasty, but although I sliced my potatoes in a food processor about 1/4 â€œ thick it took 1hr before the potatoes were done and they were stuck to the pre greased pan.  Next time I will slice and then parboil before assembling.

This was tasty.  I found it  necessary to use only one jar of the Alfredo sauce.  Otherwise I made it as the recipe dictated.

Excellent dish.  The fancy cheese, fancy alfredo made it amazing.  Word of caution,  the time/temp may be oven dependent, using the instructions in my oven made crunchy taters which you dont want.  The next day 25 min at 350 made them awesome.

Turned out well and was easy to do. I had Ham left-overs and really like Scalloped Potatoes. The Alfredo sauce was the key item I wanted to add. Noted the increased cook time and it was good advice from another review. I'll try this again next occasion I have extra baked Ham.
