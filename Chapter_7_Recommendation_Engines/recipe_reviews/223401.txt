Just made this last night - it was super easy & super delicious!!! Will definitely make it again, everyone loved it! 

Also, there seemed to be a lot of extra chocolate graham cracker crust - so I sprinkled it on top of each of the layers and on the top of the cheesecake and added the chocolate chips which made it look fancy :)

This dessert was pretty good..I halved the recipe and used 6 pre made mini Graham crackers crusts.
I did use little less sweetened condensed milk, as I didn't want the dessert to be overly sweet. I am not sure the combination of lemon juice and coffee is ideal for this ! I might use some vanilla or almond extract and some cream or milk instead of lemon juice next time.
