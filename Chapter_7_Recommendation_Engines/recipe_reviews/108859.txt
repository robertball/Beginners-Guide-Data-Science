I thought this marinade was flavorful and made the meat tender.  I used canola oil instead of grapeseed, yellow mustard instead of ground mustard (because I didn't have any) and no bay leaves.  I loved the marinade but I think next time, I'll cut the oil in half...it just seemed to be too much.  Great recipe- no steak sauce needed on the side!

Absolutely Delicious! I used about 5 lbs chuck steak that comes 3 to a pack. Because I never think a day ahead, I grilled one of the steaks after about 6 hrs. The aroma was wonderful! We could only imagine how the other 2 would be after marinating overnight! We grilled them for brunch, and OMG! The steak was tender,juicy and so flavorful! I thin the liquid smoke helps, so don't leave it out! I varied a tad from the recipe, because I didn't have grape seed oil, I used olive oil. I also ran low on Worcestershire sauce so only had little over 1/4c and lastly I used a whole lime, otherwise would have had to find another recipe to use up the rest of it. I am adding this to my recipe box and will use it over and over! Thanks!

Awesome!  I substituted canola oil for the grapeseed and left out the bay leaves ('cuz I didn't have any).  The batch made just the right amount for 5 pounds of London Broil.  My kids LOVED it and so did I!

I made this recipe exactly as stated because I had everything called for in the house.  We marinated 2 pretty decent steaks for 2 hours before grilling.  This marinade is really great.  It's a big recipe, though, so I will cut it in half next time we make it.  My husband says that will be next week!  Thanks for the great recipe.

I followed this recipe exactly, but made only half as much. I was planning to marinate overnight, but ended up marinating about 36 hours (love those really long baseball games). My flank steak was tender and delicious. Thanks for a great recipe!

Awesome marinade. Best one I've tried! The amount was perfect for 6 large steaks.

I did replace the grapeseend oil with canola oil, but this is one of the best marinades I've ever had.

Needed more salt, but other than that was perfect.

Delicious, tender steak!  Used this marinade for on London broil for our 4th of July BBQ.  Many compliments and requests for the recipe.  I follow it as written except that I didn't have dry mustard so I used a packet mustard. Marinaded over night. Then grilled. Came  out great

Super easy & I had all the ingredients! I used it for cubed roast in the crockpot. I cooked it in the marinade on low for 4 hours. Everyone loved it! The meat just fell apart. It was great with rice, quinoa, and in tacos!

I have made this many times since first finding the recipe last winter. People always, always ask for more and they ask for the recipe as well. I also replaced the grapeseed oil with canola.

Delicious marinade! I made this for a 2 pound flank steak and it was wonderful. I didn't have any grape seed oil so I used canola oil instead.
