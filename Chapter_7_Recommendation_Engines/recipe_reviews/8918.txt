This is a great, easy and quick recipe, i would say definitely use olive oil with garlic to coat with the breadcrumbs, it's much easier and adds it own unique taste. One tip i would give is - Sear the meat in a heavy based pan to seal the breadcrumbs and then transfer the pan to the oven. Cook with butter in the pan and you get the best of both worlds.  Also, add some mixed herbs to the Parmesan cheese to sprinkle over chicken, before you put it in the oven and it will form a beautiful crust. You can use this formula for any light meats, i've used turkey, pork and lamb all turned out great.

I had a package of boneless chicken breasts & a husband and 5 kids to feed. I had run out of ideas. I chose this recipe because it sounded easy & required only four ingredients. What a pleaser! The whole family loved it and I've placed it in my Recipe Box. Thanks K grecco, for a terrific, easy dinner dish. The only thing I did different was to set the oven higher, 450F and then I turned it down 5 mins into the cooking time. This is a keeper.

My husband liked this a lot and is already looking forward to having it again.  I thought it was good but not outstanding.  If you like chicken with a crispy breaded coating, this recipe is for you.  We thought there was a nice but not overpowering garlic flavor.  I only needed 1 cup of bread crumbs.  I added about 1/8 cup of Parmesan cheese to the bread crumbs, but it could have used even more.  I melted the butter with the chopped garlic in a small skillet, then turned it down to low and dipped the chicken directly into the butter then into the bread crumbs.  I baked 4 rather large boneless skinless breasts for 45 minutes, which was plenty.  40 minutes would have probably been enough.

My daughter is allergic to butter, so I replaced with olive oil. No fresh garlic, so I used bottled minced garlic (3 tsps). I also added an Italian spice blend to my plain bread crumbs. Excellent!

Wonderful - I took others suggestions and added parmesian cheese to the butter mixture and doubled the garlic... 
WOW - This came out GREAT! Hubby really liked it; this recipe is going into my personal cookbook.

Absolutely delicious.  We are garlic lovers and this is an amazing recipe.  I do brown the chicken in a pan first before putting it into the oven (to reduce the cooking time a bit).  Thanks for the post.

I have a similar recipe using olive oil that I have previously used.  I wanted to see if the butter would inhance the flavor.  I like the regular Garlic Chicken also off this site better.  Infusing the oil with the garlic gives it more flavor.  I didn't find this had much flavor at all.  I tried flipping the chicken as other suggested, but found I then simply had chicken that was soggy on both sides.  I won't make this again.

Very good recipe.  I only had minced garlic but it still turned out excellent. I had no seasoned bread crumbs, so after it was ready to go into oven, I sprinkled paprika, salt, pepper, parsley and a little italian seasoning on the top.  Everyone loved them.  Thanks.

The chicken turned out really tasty, but crushing the garlic left big pieces of it on the chicken that I didn't want to eat.  I think that finely mincing the garlic would make the recipie even better.

This is fabulous.  I love garlic butter.  Another version I make is to brush dijon mustard onto the chicken pieces, then roll in seasoned panko crumbs and parm cheese.  Then drizzle some garlic butter over them and bake...yummy!

This was wonderfully easy! We have used the same recipe in the past but we used olive oil instead of butter. We would prep the garlic and olive oil early in the day to enhance the garlic flavor.  However, the olive oil gets very smoky in the oven while cooking and the butter obviously does not.  I will be using butter from now on.  Next time I will prep the butter and garlic ahead of time to get more garlic flavor and mix parmesan with the bread crumbs.  Thanks for posting!

I have been doing this for years with parmesan, BUT I have to question the cooking time. Twenty five to thirty minutes at 425' is fine. 45 - 60 minutes must really dry out the chicken.

This is an even better recipe if you use 1 cup parmasean cheese and 1 cup seasoned bread crumbs.  This is my daughter's favorite meal and makes it for friends when she sleeps over.

I used panko bread crumbs with some parmesan cheese.  Instead of crushed garlic I used garlic powder mixed with the butter and some garlic salt mixed in with the bread crumbs.  It was yummy!

One of the best recipes I have tried so far! I used a combination of both seasoned and panko bread crumbs, and parmesian cheese(grated)and pre-seasoned the chicken with salt, cayenne pepper, Spanish smoked hot paprika, dipped the pieces in the garlic butter mixture, covered with bread crumbs and baked for 1 hr. Came out great! Will put this in heavy rotation.

I like to mix some cheese in with the bread crumbs. I also like using Panko style bread crumbs instead of regular bread crumbs. A little parsley is delicious as well.

Incredible meal!  As always, I look at the reviews and tweak recipes.  Here's what I did.  I used half seasoned bread crumbs and half panko crumbs (2 cups was way too much I found out).  I seasoned them a little more with some Italian Seasoning, some fresh shredded parmesan cheese, a little red pepper flakes and a some salt/pepper.
For the dipping mixture, I used half oil and half butter with about 9 garlic cloves.  I seasoned each breast with a little salt/pepper before dipping in the oil/butter mixture. After dipping in the bread crumb mixture, I placed them in a lightly greased baking dish and scraped the leftover oil/garlic mixture on top of the chicken.  I then placed in refrigerator until later that evening.  I think sitting in the oil/bread crumb mixture for awhile to marinate enhanced the flavor.  Later, I lightly browned in a little oil/butter.  Then put back in the baking dish to bake at 375 covered for about 20 minutes.  I removed cover and placed freshly grated parmesan cheese mixed with some Italian seasonings on top.  Put back in the oven for a little while longer until done.  
It was incredible served with stir fry veggies and wild rice.  Will definitely be making this again.  I recommend to you, however, you must love garlic to be a fan of this recipe.  Enjoy!

This recipe made my husband realize that he LOVES garlic and I always recommend it to anyone who's whining about what they're going to make for dinner. It's my go to suggestion for "super easy dinner". Usually, I only make two chicken breasts and they're cooked through perfectly in about 30-35 minutes.

I took everyone's ideas and the Chicken  was really great.  My family loved it.  I pounded 3  chicken breasts 1/4 in. thick, took 1/4 cup olive oil, 3 tsp bottled minced garlic and dipped the chicken in that.  I used 3/4 cup Italian bread crumbs, 1/2 cup parmesan and coated the chicken.  Baked in a 375 degree oven for 35 mins.  The chicken was really moist.

I have made a rendition of this for years. I like spaghetti with marinara as an accompaniment.I use half bread crumbs and half parmesan. I also melt the butter in a small skillet and add the minced garlic then dip the chicken in the butter and then crumbs. If I have any leftover butter and breading, I mix them and sprinkle over the chicken breast. Next time I will try another reviewer's suggestion to quickly pan fry and then finish in the oven for a crunchier texture. Great recipe.

Delicious! I used chicken tenderloins instead of whole breast pieces, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  My family absolutely loved it and requested I make it on a regular basis.

I followed the recipe and instructions as they were given - and overall I would have to say that this dish was pretty disappointing.  It smelled so good with that garlic - but then I tasted it...it was flavorless... every now and then I would get a hint of garlic taste.  Also, there were WAY too many bread crumbs.  I used 2 cups like the recipe asked and half of it was wasted.  Yes it was easy, but it wasn't worth it.  I'm never using this recipe again.

3.5 stars - Great flavor - I did 8 cloves and it was very garlicky.  Wasnt crazy about the bread crumb/baking texture of the crust - May be unhealthier but pan frying crispy would be extra yummy

Not bad and was easy.  I don't think I used all the butter nor the bread crumbs called for.  I didn't need the fat in the butter and didn't want to waste bread crumbs not used.  I added seasoning to taste on my bread crumbs and added a small amount of corn meal as I'm trying to use it up.  The corn meal added a nice texture.  Chicken was moist and very flavorful.  I'll make it again, I never rate things a full five star, same as I never make EXACTLY as stated.  There is always room for someone to improvise or make improvements.  Good recipe and worth trying adding your own twists.

Although it is highly rated, and reviewers have mentioned it has a  'subtle' taste. It really is EXTREMELY subtle!! Almost non-existent!  I won't be making it again!! Unless you add a lot more seasoning!  Although I followed others suggestions about  adding 7 crushed large garlic cloves !

I added Italian seasoning and onion powder to the chicken, used Italian style bread crumbs and added grated parm and also added more seasoning to bread crumbs. The last five minutes I topped the chicken with shredded parm. I used cutlets and they were done in about 25 min. Very tender. I served with pasta.

This was the juciest chicken! I didn't have any fresh garlic so I used about a half a teaspoon of garlic powder instead. I think I will use more next time because I am a garlic freak. 45 minutes in the oven was right on... it was delicious!

This is an average recipe. The chicken was very juicy (but I also used boneless thighs versus breasts). I may try this with olive oil and garlic in the future so it may be a little healthier.

I made this for my family tonight. My husband thought it was good. However, I found it to be a little too buttery and not enough flavor.  I think maybe next time I will try to season the chicken more first.

This was great, I used half a cup of butter, and drizzled the butter/garlic mixture over the chicken after breading, then turned the oven up to 400 during the last 10 mins of baking to achieve crispy chicken. Very nice flavor, and only 4 ingredients. A keeper for sure

I sautéd fresh garlic in olive oil, then marinated the chicken for about 2 hours. On top of the bread crumbs I drizzled some more olive oil. It was ok.... it just seemed a little dry.

This was easy and delicious.  And what smells better than butter and garlic together?  ;-)  I grated the garlic to maximize the flavor but used 4 cloves instead of 6.  Will definitely make this again and share with others.

I've just started cooking and have tried a few recipes (and have been happy with them) and this is the first time I have wanted to write a review.  This was outstanding.  I followed the recipe but added A LOT of minced garlic and added Parmesan cheese to the mix along with some crushed red pepper.  I agree there were too many cups of bread crumbs so I'm going to cut it down (I've kept the extra to use next week when I cook this again!).  I had three breasts and cooked them for 35 minutes and it came out perfect.  Thanks K. Grecco for posting this.

I am a HUGE garlic lover and my husband is not, so when I told him I was making a garlic chicken recipe for dinner, he was less than enthused. And then it started baking...smelled so good he was dying to taste it...and when he did, he loved it - said it was "insanely delicious!"

A few minor modifications I made in the ingredients:
-1/8C olive oil, 1/8C butter
-approx. 4 tbsp. minced garlic
-1 C italian-seasoned bread crumbs (mixed in a couple dashes each of garlic salt, onion powder, dried parsley & chili powder to taste)

Followed the cooking directions exactly, except that I only baked it for about 40 minutes in the preheated oven - that seemed to be just enough for it to be fully cooked, yet still moist. Definitely recommend!

Super EZ and mega delicious! The chicken needs to be baked on a baking rack so it does NOT get soggy. This is a VERY salty recipe. So I use half seasoned and half plain bread crumbs. Or I use plain bread crumbs and salt & pepper each piece individually before dipping in butter. Add 1/4 cup Parmesan to butter. Watch the salt....there is salt in the bread crumbs, salt in butter & in the Parmesan.

This recipe was delicious. My family loved it. Definitely will make again.  I added more garlic than called for and a little pepper.  Fantastic !!!!!   I wanted it a little more crispy so i baked it for an hour so it was crispy on top and then turned chicken over and broiled it on low for a few minutes just to crisp the other side. Perfect !!! So tender!

These were wonderful! I doubled the minced garlic and used half olive oil and half butter. Also used italian breadcrumbs and sprinkled with parmesan cheese prior to baking. The baking time is quite long though; I would check at 30 minutes (or maybe 35 if your breasts are quite thick). Next time I make them I will use some parm in the breading as well as sprinkling on top. So easy and so good; my husband loved it as well! Thanks for the recipe K Grecco!

I make this when I need a quick dinner. The way I make it is similar. I double the garlic and butter half it.  Dredge the Chicken in it. Coat with italian bread crumbs. Put chicken in a baking dish, Pour the remaining butter mixture on top. Halfway through cooking flip the chicken and put shaved parmesan cheese on the top. Yummy and Garlicky.

Rear good, real easy! I decided to mix a little of the breadcrumbs into the butter and garlic sauce, which makes it easier to coat the chicken. Supurb, especially if you like garlic!

I used this recipe for one of my first attempts at real cooking and it turned out great. I doubled the garlic because I saw someone suggest that and I'm a huge garlic fanatic, and even AFTER doubling the garlic the garlic flavor STILL could have been stronger, but either way it was delicious and the breading turned out perfect. Spooning the leftover sauce over the chicken added some great extra flavor as well.

Just made this for dinner.  Very tasty and moist .  I always use thin sliced chicken breasts so the cooking time is 1/2 hour tops.  I used garlic and herb bread crumbs,  very nice garlic flavor though it may be a little too intensely garlic for some

Easy and very good.  We often pound our chicken before cooking just so it cooks evenly and quickly.  My chicken for this recipe was done in 35 minutes and was very good.

Wonderful!  I felt like I was eating at a restaurant they were so GOOD!!!  Even the microwaved leftovers were to die for.  I changed the recipe a little, added some of my own spices and used half butter and half olive oil.  The olive oil REALLY makes this recipe I think.  THANK U!  My husband is in love with it :)

Super Easy, Lots of flavor, even the kids eat it all up.  What more can you say!!  Parmesan cheese was added to the bread crumbs and 2 cloves of garlic were pressed to dole out a bit more garlic flavor.  We did these as chicken fingers and they were a huge hit.

I've been making making this butter before finding it on Allrecipes. MY DH loves it. I use a butter/ olive oil mix, tons of garlic, a handful of chopped cilantro or parsley and a dash or two of salt. It's always made in bulk so that I can toss it in the fridge for later use. It can be chucked in the microwave for a few seconds to melt for the garlic chicken. We use it on bread products before toasting to make a yummy garlic bread as well.

For the sake of cooking time I used chicken tenders. I reduced the cooking time by 20 minutes. I also used Panko bread crumbs for a crunchier chicken. This recipe was very quick and easy. Three out of 4 members in my house like the recipe.

We Loved this chicken, though I'm not sure it needs to be cooked for so long. I think 30-35 minutes would be plenty of time. I added some parmesan cheese to the bread crumbs. Will definitely make again.

Very good! My picky toddler ate it up like there was no tomorrow :) However I would recommend turning the chicken during the baking process as mine got gooey on the bottom. But it still tasted great!

My house will probably reek of garlic for a week.  My husband said the smell was so strong that it gave him a headache and didn't even try it.  I did.  The chicken was moist but I wasn't impressed.

It was good as I made it exactly as stated in recipe.  However, when making it again, I will put the garlic in olive oil, dip the chicken in the oil and bread crumbs with parmesan cheese added. Heat the butter in a heavy pan, sear the chicken, then put in the oven for 30 minutes at 450*.

Lovley, I'm just starting to get my confidence with cooking and it was really easy and straight forward to make, took Michelle Mac's advice and seared the chicken with the breadcrumbs before putting in the oven and turned out very nice.

Was disappointed with this recipe as I am  a garlic fan. Made as called for but added extra garlic and tho my house smelt heavenly the taste did not live up to the smell. Both my husband and I found it quite bland.

Tried this recipe today and I love how easy it was to prepare. I did some things a bit different, though. Added about a teaspoon of dried basil leaves and then about half a teaspoon of ground black pepper in the butter coat mixture. And, I baked using a turbo broiler (because there's no one to put down our electric oven from storage). Maybe because I'm not using an oven, I found the need to increase the temperature from 375 to 450, and cooked 55 minutes total. I think I need to add more garlic next time, though, to make the garlic taste more prominent. :)

OMGosh, I made this tonight for supper and it was absolutely delicious.  My husband and I loved it.  I had ready made garlic butter from the deli so I melted that and dipped the chicken in, then rolled in Italian breadcrumbs with some grated parmesan cheese mixed in.  Flavor was yummy garlicky and the chicken was so moist.  I served with rice, noodles and honey glazed green beans.  Thanks so much for posting this recipe.  It's definitely one of our favorites now :)

This was very good, moist chicken.  The only thing I added was a little grated romano cheese to the bread crumbs.  I used fresh garlic and grated it and added to the butter.  The garlic was carmelized and delicious after baking!

Followed this recipe exactly. My husband and I both thought this recipe was pretty bland. The coating never became at all crispy which we thought was strange. Overall, a very simple dish to prepare but you could definitely tell it required very little effort.

This was quick, easy, and fast. I did not have seasoned bread crumbs so I used a mix of panko bread crumbs, salt, pepper, paprika, and asian fried onions. This will be my go to as my partner loves shaken-bake.

This could be a 5 star recipe with a couple very simple modifications that don't totally change the original recipe that much. Bread crumb mixture is mushy and not crispy so I recommend cooking stove top.  I sprinkled parsley, garlic salt, a cheese on top which added flavor to a semi  bland sounding tasting recipe. I would try again.

We really liked this...didn't need as much bread crumbs as the recipe calls for...Not great for leftovers because the topping became soggy, but that came as no surprise.

Yummy, easy recipe!  I used panko bread crumbs mixed with italian herbs & parmesan after dipping the chicken in a mixture of oil, butter and garlic.  I baked the chicken on racks.  The chicken was moist and delicious.  I'll definitely make this again.

I made this the other night for my family and it was the best the only thing different that I did was add Parmesan cheese to the bread crumbs. Yum. I am definitely making this one again.

Very easy & very good. I did add more garlic and some parsley and used split chicken breast with bone-in. Baked in 375 degree oven for 1 hour. It was done perfectly, lightly browned & cooked through.

This recipe is a keeper.  It is quick and easy, but tastes great.  Everyone loves it.  You can vary the amount of garlic if you like an intense garlic flavor, too.

This is the easiest and one of the tastiest chicken breast recipes I have used.   I added some olive oil to the butter, cut the chicken breasts into  thirds and double dipped the pieces in the bread crumbs since my family loves breading.  I baked it only the time suggested and it was so juicy and tender you could cut it with a fork.  Thank you for this too easy to be true recipe.

5 stars for easy and delish. I usually pound out chicken breasts so they are a little thinner and all uniform thickness. I only baked mine for 20 minutes and they were perfect!

This was a simple, tasty recipe.  I used Smart Balance instead of butter (my kids are allergic to dairy), and some EVOO in a saucepan, with 6 whole cloves of garlic that I crushed with the side of my knife.  I let that infuse for a while, and then pounded 3 chicken breasts.  I dipped them in the warm olive oil/Smart Balance/garlic mixture, and then dipped them into a mixture of Italian bread crumbs and Panko bread crumbs (with a little kosher salt & cracked pepper mixed in).  I mixed the balance of the oil mixture with the breadcrumbs and put them on top of the chicken, as the recipe called for.  Then I baked them in a 375 degree oven for 20 minutes on the first side and 10 on the flip side.  That was more than enough.  They were delicious!  Rave reviews from my picky teenage boys.  The dog was going crazy too :

Excellent!  This recipe is about the same as  "Swinging Wings" from the 1980's, except that the Swinging recipe has half breadcrumbs and half Parmesan cheese, so I added the Parm.  It was heavenly served with Calico Mashed Potatoes.

This was so good!  My family loved it, even my picky Father who usually has a "it's good but...." type of opinion!   As a side note, I used the "Yellow Squash Casserole" recipe by ROSECART on this site as a side dish, that was also fantastic! Easy to make, I will make this again, thanks for sharing this recipe!

Wow, this is so delicious! All my chicken breasts were already cut in nugget sized pieces and pre-marinated in other herbs so I used those for this recipe and cut down the cooking time to suit. I also didn't read the recipe properly, so I did not add the extra breadcrumbs with the remaining butter/garlic dip, but instead just drizzled the extra dip over the top of the breaded nuggets in the pan. These came out so moist and flavourful, with the perfect amount of breading IMO. I had this with Pasta and Alfredo Sauce (which also used fresh garlic.) What a wonderful combination it made! This one is going in my keeper file. Thanks for sharing!

The flavor of this chicken was yummy, but a bit too much of the bread crumbs for my family so I'm giving it a "3".  They loved it once they scraped the excess off!  If you like the extra bread crumbs, you will love this!

I will definitely make this again, but will probably cut the bread crumbs in half and won't spoon any extra over the chicken in the pan before baking.  Thanks for sharing.

Pretty Decent Recipe, I first saw it on one those morning shows. I chose to tweak it a little, instead of regular bread crumbs i used the Panko bread crumbs, it eliminated the gritty texture that the regular bread crumbs can sometimes cause. Also after fully coating the chicken with the butter and crumbs you should refrigerate it for about 15 min for everything to stick. Otherwise the coating will come off in the pan. Real Tasty recipe over all.

This was fantastic!  I used Chicken Tenderloin and it was cooked perfectly after 40 minutes.  Any longer and the topping would have started to burn.  The chicken was nice and moist, fork-tender.  The topping was a wee bit dry, though delicious, so I whipped up some chicken gravy to pour over the top and it's now perfect.  I also made Uncle Ben's Garlic & Butter rice - garlic all the way, baby!  This recipe is a new keeper for me, it's so easy to make and cleanup is a snap.  I think I will make this my new go-to recipe when I need something in a pinch.  Thanks so much for a delicious and budget-friendly recipe!

This was ok.  I thought it would have been a lot more flavorful.  It was kind of bland.  The garlic didn't really flavor the chicken.

This was great.  Tender and flavorful!  My husband and I loved it.  I added a little parm cheese to the bread crumbs.  Served with lighter version of fettucine alfredo which was a great combo.

Delicious and Easy!!! Added more garlic and added the Parmesan cheese to the bread crumbs.
To ensure moist chicken I covered the dish for the 1st 15 minutes and cooked a total of 40 minutes. Kids loved it!

I thought this was very tasty, so did my daughter and fiance. The bread crumbs made it very moist. The only thing I did a little differently is put in minced garlic, since I get the tubs of it from SAMS Club. I added 2 tablespoons to the butter mixture. I did not add the left over bread crumbs, but I did pour the excess butter overtop of the chicken. 

5 stars, delicious!

This dish is SOOO easy, and to make it even easier, I used the leftover garlic butters from PAPA JOHN's, it took about one per brest, but they were large pieces!  My family begs for this dish all the time now!

This makes a great twist on chicken parm. Follow tihs recipe, but add tomato sauce and shredded mozzerella 10 minutes before done. The garlic tastes great!

Very good, a little too buttery to my taste. Next time I'll substitute all that butter with olive oil, or perhaps margarine.Not too garlicky, because I used chopped garlic from the jar - not fresh one. Might benefit from a bit of crushed red pepper added to the breadcrumbs.
Overall easy to make and tasy.

Easy is an understatement for this recipe.  Needed a recipe to feed the masses and this fit the bill.  Very easy to increase servings.  Everyone wanted the recipe.

This is perfect for a weeknight dinner, very quick & easy!  I didn't add as much garlic, due to the other posts saying it was overpowering, but I will add more next time. The chicken came out moist and very flavorful!  I will defintiely be making this again.

I actually used a package of Shake and Bake, in addition to seasoning the chicken pieces prior to using this recipie!!  It gave the chicken a nice seasoning and taste.  I had 12 pieces of chicken to coat, so I "eyeballed" the quantities of measurements--and I went to Culinary School, and I KNOW Chef would have a FIT about this!!  I approximated about a cup and a half of breadcrumbs, plus the envelope of Shake and Bake,   I also used the plastic bag for coating as opposed to having another dish/bowl to wash.  I lined a cookie sheet with foil, again for less clean up, oiled a rack to fit in the pan, laid the chicken on top, and cooked it for an hour at 400.  (I used dark meat, so it took a bit longer).  Chicken came out very tasty and moist.  I did season the meat the night before, and that's because I had nothing to do and there wasn't anything good on TV!!  I usually season my meats with "house seasoning"--salt,  pepper, garlic and onion powders, and keep it in a container in the kitchen.  I really didn't modify this too much, aside from the pre-seasoning and adding an envelope of Shake and Bake.  I would use this again!!  Tim K.--Cleveland, OH

Everyone in my family loves this recipe. I have even skipped the breadcrumbs and just basted the chicken with the butter and garlic mixture. I have added salt, pepper and paprika. Cover with foil for 20 minutes, then take foil off, pour the remainder of the butter mixture on each piece, then cook the rest of the way. Eat with veggies and everyone is licking their fingers, wanting more.

This is a back-to-basics, easy, quick recipe that is very kid and husband friendly.  No frills... just juicy, garlicky, crisp chicken.  I usually make this when I'm short on time - so I just melt the butter and garlic in the microwave for 20 seconds or until butter is melted and let it sit in there for a minute... then dip, bread and go!
  Yum.

Super simple-Never Fails!  This is one of my favorite work night dinners.  The prep is super easy and then all I have to do is bake.  My picky boys love this too!  For a twist I have used boneless skinless chicken thighs.  If you want something a bit more zingy add a little Cajun seasoning.  Amazing easy recipe for a homemade main dish!

It was wonderful.  The chicken was nice and juicy and the garlic flavor was just right. I used only two chicken breasts pounded flat and baked it for 30 minutes.  I also followed some other reviewer's suggestions and reduced the breadcrumbs to 1/2 cup and mixed it with 1/2 cup parmesean cheese.

Very good and moist.  Changes it just a little.  I used olive oil and garlic from a jar, added parm. cheese to the bread crumbs and sprinkled parm. cheese on top before baking.

We LOVED this recipe. My husband said it was in his top favorites. My kids gobbled it up too! I'll definitely be making this again. I might try putting Parmesan cheese in with the breadcrumbs next time just to switch it up.

This is a great fast garlic chicken.  I injected mine about an hour earlier with tampico hot sauce.  My husband and I love spicy.  Next time I am going to try a garlic lemon sauce and inject with some lemon juice with a little sugar dissolved in the juice.

Excellent! I used Olive Olive instead of the butter and sauteed the garlic for a few minutes. The bread crumb mixture I used was Italian bread crumbs, salt, pepper and Parmesan cheese. Delicious!

Great recipe.  I added Parmesan cheese and white pepper to the breadcrumbs, and I used my garlic press to finely mince the garlic.  I also microwaved the butter and garlic together, to melt the butter, and it infused the garlic flavor with the butter.  Yum - thanks!

I gave this four stars but would have given four and a half if that were an option. This is a good, easy go-to recipe. I have a lot of breaded-type chicken recipes that I use but this is one of the better ones I have tried. Will be making again!

Very moist and delicious!  I added some italian seasoning and onion powder to the bread crumbs and also to the butter/garlic mixture.  It was easy and fantastic.  Will definitely make again.

We added salt, pepper, onion powder, and other spices to the chicken before we coated it.  I used panko instead of breadcrumbs, and the kids thought it was fried chicken!

Next time I would sprinkle the chicken with salt before dredging in the crumbs.  I used Panko breadcrumbs to make it more crunchy.

Super easy. Light tasty meal. I made dinner for 2, just two breasts and cut them into thirds. Came out tender, not very crispy though. The breading could be scraped off easily with a touch of the fork.

This is one of our favorite ways to prepare chicken.  My picky 11 year old loves it and says, are we having my favorite chicken?"  I don't use any butter just EVOO. Simply delish!

My very picky daughters loved this! I did not have fresh bread crumbs. I used crushed garlic butter croutons instead. I also simply added garlic powder to the melted butter. The breast were juicy yet crispy I think it is because I used frozen breast. Thank you for this very easy quick recipie! Will use again!

This is has great taste and is super simple to make. Like everyone else I made it my own. I used Panko in place of bread crumbs and cut the chicken in to strips (for the kids) then sprinkled parmesan and "Chef Paul Prudhomme's Poultry Magic" over the whole thing before bakeing. All three of my boys and my wife loved it.

I couldnt believe how simple this was, yet how tasty it was. I didnt have breadcrumbs so I used crushed cornflaked with italian seasoning and a little bit of flour, and put it in a ziploc bag. Then I just rolled the chicken in the sauce and then put it in the bag. It came out GREAT

This was wonderful! I did heed the advice from previous reviews and I only used 1 c bread crumbs. The crumbs I had were plain so I added some garlic salt as well as some garlic and herb seasoning. I increased the butter to 1/2 c and the garlic to 8-9 cloves (using up one head of garlic and starting another so the size of each clove varied quite a bit) as the chicken breasts I was using were pretty big. Baked 45 min at 375 and they were moist and delicious. Served with a green salad and bowtie pasta tossed w/garlic infused EVOO, parmesan, diced roma tomatoes, and parsley. A new favorite!

This was a really good "I've got nothing in the house to eat", thrown together entree. We're snowed in here and don't really want to venture out. I added some cayenne pepper and paprika to the bread crumbs to give a little more ZING.

Very good recipe.  I took the advice of other reviewers and added grated parmesan.  I made a big mistake, though and only used regular breadcrumbs, not seasoned, so it was kinda bland.  I will definitely make this recipe again, though.  Thanks for sharing!

Easy recipe and good chicken.  I added some grated parmesan cheese like the others recommended and it came out really good.

Just as tasty if you use extra virgin olive oil instead of butter!Have this at least once a week and it never fails to rate a 10/10.I cook it in a preheated oven (220C) for about 12-13 mins.Tender as!For a little extra tast add some finely grated parmesan.

Followed the recipe as given and found it to be lacking in flavor.It was moist and not dry but the garlic flavor just did not penetrate the chicken. If I were to try this again I would probably marinate the chicken for an hour or so in some type of garlic/Italian herb mixture.

This couldn't have been easier and it was very good. The chicken was ready to bake before the oven was even preheated. I only used 3 chicken breasts, but I kept the butter and bread crumbs the same. I cut the garlic back to 3 cloves and added a little parmesan cheese to the breading. The chicken had great flavor and was perfectly cooked after 40 minutes. Served with mashed potatoes and green beans for a simple, tasty meal.

It does not get any easier than this. I love this recipe-you just can't go wrong with it! I cut my chicken breast into good size strips. I usually serve it with steamed broccoli and rice.

Delicious!  We're on a low carb diet, so I substituted grated parm, only on the top, in place of the bread crumbs.  Also used another reviewer's idea to add some crushed red pepper flakes (very little)also parsley flakes and a smidge of Italian seasoning.  Fantastic flavor! :)

My whole family loves this, even the kids!!!  I found that if you wrap the chicken with foil before baking it's really tender.  If you like your meat a little more brown remove the foil about halfway through.  This recipe also works with porkchops.

I was looking for a different way to make chicken for my husband and me and found this recipe.  We absolutely love garlic and a lot of our dishes include garlic.  So in short, I made it for a "date night" dinner last night and we absolutely loved it.  I will definitely make this again and show off to company!  We love quick and easy, and this recipe couldn't have been more simple!

I liked this recipe for it's simplicity and ease.  Usually when I want to cook a quick dinner, I just lightly season some chicken breasts and throw it on the *generic indoor contact grill*.  When I found this recipe, I was pleased that it contained ingredients that I always have on hand.  I had plain bread crumbs, which I seasoned with garlic salt, parsley and cracked black pepper.  I used about 3/4 of a stick of butter (6 tablespoons) and probably 9 medium sized cloves of garlic.  

While sautéing the garlic, I placed the chicken breast in the butter and let it sit there for a good 15 seconds before flipping, then dredging in the crumbs.  After that I put it on the contact grill and it crisped up nicely.  It was a good change of pace!

SO EASY...AND TENDER! The only thing I did differently was 1 cup of bread crumbs (kept the butter amount the same).  I had 4 chicken breasts and 1 cup a bread crumbs was enough.

I don't usually cook with chicken breasts because they are too dry for my taste. I live in Egypt and during Ramadan, Egyptians break their day-long fast with an Iftar at sunset.  I made this for Iftar for 60 people - out of 100 breasts, there were 8 left!  This was the easiest and moistest chicken I've ever had.  And to cook such a large amount was no problem at all.  This definitely goes in my recipe box!!!

Right up our alley. Easy, fast and with ingredients I have on hand. I added more garlic and used some stuffing mix I had on hand. The next time I will use half canola oil, half butter and see how that goes. I can think of many variations.

My family and friends like this recipe but the only thing I wish I could change is the slight aftertaste from the pudding mix.But it isnt that bad but you can taste a hinch.

I didn’t use panko, rather I substituted almond flour for the crumbs, added some grated Parmesan and smoked paprika, it was absolutely delicious! I also used both breasts and legs.

I rolled in crushed Zesty Italian croutons instead of the breadcrumbs. Flavor was wonderful..I served cheese tortellini with sauce as a side, added sauce on top of the chicken. Definitely making again.

Omg this was so good!!! I made it as stated, except I used jarred minced garlic and used about 4 teaspoons. I had huge chicken breasts and cut them in half and cooked at 375° for 45 minutes and they came out perfectly. I will definitely be making this again!!

I liked this recipe as it was super easy for a super novice cook such as myself. We added a bit extra to the end process, such as spaghetti sauce and mozzarella cheese to it. 
What I and my aunt my do next time with this is trying to fry it as opposed to baking it. We both agreed that it sounds like a great thing to try!

It was super easy. I cut my chicken breasts in small pieces and used this recipe to make nuggets. Directly on a plaque, no oil, no grease, no nothing on the plaque. It was crispy and delicious. My 3 yo and my bf loved it. 
Next time, I will use a bit less garlic and season my bread crumbs.

I agree with some of the other reviewers- the recipe was good, but not outstanding. It tasted pretty garlicky and I think it needed some other flavor to balance it out. I think the next time I make it, I'll try the Parmesan cheese recommended in other reviews, and maybe some other herb/seasoning to expand the flavors a little.

it was so amazing my husband loved it.
- I had 3 chicken breast, cut them in half. rubbed a lil some salt and pepper on them.
- got a lil sauce pan melted 1/4 cup of butter and 3 things of garlic (going to use just 1 next time), then put the burner on its lowest.
-got a square container for seasoned bread crumbs,garlic powder,and parmesan cheese (just eye balled and estamated).
-while the burner still on its lowest I dipped each chicken, tried to scrap off the garlic a lil, then dipped it in the bread crumbs.
-i placed them in a spray buttered dish 
- put it in the over at 425° for 35mins 
DONE!

Not any real changes made,  did use the hint on the aluminum foil base in the dish and also covered with the foil.   Chicken was done in the recipe stated time and very moist and delicious...

I'll make it again soon.

I made this dish to impress my parents. When I was making it, I realized I was 2 cups short of bread crumbs! I only ended up using 1 cup of bread crumbs. I also duh duh duh ran out of sauce! I had to double the sauce to make enough! I recommend this dish served over pasta with some extra cheese!

Delicious!  The only thing I added was a drizzle of olive oil on each side of the chicken breasts before I put the pan in the oven.   I also used gluten free bread crumbs.  My family loved the fried chicken taste.

We LOVE this recipe, but instead of bread crumbs, I use Pepperidge Farm stuffing (crushed a little finer before dredging). The flavor is amazing!!!

I used Ritz crackers to make the coating, and just used garlic powder for the butter, worked great and was sooo good

I used minced garlic that I had on hand but otherwise followed the recipe. It was super simple and came out delicious! I thought it had good flavor as is, but next time I will try adding Parmesan cheese and using olive oil instead of butter.

I will make this all the time.  My favorite way to deal with what I call bald chicken. It tastes like Chicken Kiev. I do add green onion or chives. I made Chicken Kiev once....never again what a pain.  This is better. Love it.

My wife and I have made this about 15 times now.  Excellent and simple recipe!  We use Italian seasoned panko instead of bread crumbs and makes for a delicious and crispy finish.

I salted and peppered the chicken. Also, I added shredded Parmesan to the breadcrumbs for extra flavor.

It is a very easy recipe. However, this did not turn out so well for me. Bottom was soggy.  Flavor was just okay. The chicken was very moist.

I only had plain panko bread crumbs so I added 1/4c parmesan cheese and 1T of Lawry's seasoning salt. Turned out a bit too salty for me, but my husband and kids loved it! Next time I'd go with a bit less Lawry's. I also didn't need nearly that much for bread crumbs.

So I deviated a bit....didn't dip chicken in butter (used an egg) and used Panko instead BUT certainly used lots of garlic and they were GREAT. My only fault was not serving the same day. Served next day and reheated in oven...bad choice my moist chicken dried out. Won't do that again. Will make these from now on over buying manufactured nuggets.

This was delicious! The adults in our family loved it. It bakes up soft, so my MIL found it easy to chew. The kids didn't like the texture, saying it was "mushy". But I found it to be a great, low fat alternative to fried chicken.  We squeezed lemon juice on the slices to add "zing".

As suggested by other reviews, I used olive oil instead of butter. Plus, I made my own bread crumbs (I highly recommend this).  The seasonings I used for my bread crumbs were as follows: basil, oregano, paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, salt, and parmesan. Depending on how many slices of bread you use, will determine how much seasoning to use.  For six slices of bread (finely diced in the food processor), I used approximately 1/2 tspn of each seasoning.  I did add slightly more parmesan to the seasoning mix (approximately 1/4 tspn more).

My family loves this recipe but I use crushed Ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs. I have sometimes skipped a step by using garlic Ritz crackers. My boys like it best in nugget form.

I made this exact to the recipe, and it was both easy and delicious. 

Only [slight] differences was I grated the garlic instead of crushed it... & I wasn't feeling to take out a saucepan etc so i microwaved the butter and garlic instead, which doesn't make a difference to the taste anyway, it's just easier.

We decided to use chicken thighs for this recipe and it came out fantastic.  The chicken comes out tender and perfectly seasoned.  I served this with roasted green beans and a salad.  

This is definitely a "do again" recipe.

This chicken was delicious!! I did not have any chicken breast on hand, but I did have chicken cutlets, I used these and it cut down the bake time to just 30 minutes.  The leftovers will be awesome over a simple chef salad.  I will definitely be adding this to my dinner menu again (very soon).

Very yummy chicken! I used herb garlic croutons and baguette crackers for the bread crumbs. Next time I should add some Parmesan cheese as others have suggested . Had yam fries and Greek salad and of course a nice bottle of wine :)

Really good but next time, I will use a thicker piece of chicken. Mine was a little thin from Whole Foods. But simple and good to make on if you want something to eat that is not time consuming.

For ease and taste this is a great way to cook chicken breast.  We had butter noodles and fresh green beans - it was delicious and great leftovers.

This is such a simple recipe and tastes oh so yummy! The chicken breast was so moist it melted in my mouth. I don't eat a lot of breast meat because I think it's way too dry, but this was fantastic! I didn't change anything, made it as-is.

I wasn't too crazy about this but my fiance loved it so I gave it a 4.  I much prefer the garlic chicken recipe on this site that uses olive oil and parmesan.  I didn't want to waste any breadcrumbs so I started out with one cup and it turned out to be more than enough.  For those who say their chicken was dry, over the years I've learned if it comes out dry it's due to being over cooked for the most part!  I took this out after about 35 minutes and it was very moist....had I left it longer it probably would've been dry so the cooking time on this  seems too long!

Very good, quick baked chicken recipe.  Not overpowering in the least in the garlic department.  I didn't have seasoned breadcrumbs and I suppose I didn't add adequate amounts of seasoning on my own, so it was a tad bland, but everyone liked it and that's the main thing.  I'll make it again for sure!

Easy and good. As with most breaded and baked chicken recipes, I find this is good with a thinner piece of breast meat. It allows you to have garlicky breading with every bite!

This recipe called for waayy too many breadcrumbs. I cut it in half and was still left with too much. I used the called for, 1/4 cup, butter and there was very little left after the dipping. I thought it was a dressed up shake n bake and I wouldn't go through the trouble again.

I followed this recipe exactly as stated.  It was a wonderful and different way to serve chicken.  Not to mention easy and super fast.  My family really enjoyed it.  The next time I make this I want to find a way to make the outside a little crispier.  My boyfriend thought it was a little too soggy/soft.

I decided to try this since my husband and I are big garlic lovers.  However, we were thoroughly disappointed.  The chicken didn't get crispy and the pile of extra bread crumbs on top was too much.  I like garlic, but this chicken needed something else going on.

Made exactly to recipe and the only reason I give a 4 star instead of 5 is that I felt like the chicken needed to be mildly salted.  Both husband and I greatly enjoyed this recipe and I am not a chicken breast person at all.

This was good - but dry. I cut the cooking time to 40 minutes, but it was still dry - if I do it again, I will only bake for 30-35 minutes. Mixing together the extra dipping ingredients and putting it over the chicken added nothing to the dish.  As some others did, I also changed the butter to olive oil.  The taste of this dish is very good, but some modifications are definitely needed.

I love garlic and this was a great recipe for a super garlicy chicken but I was a little disappointed that the crust wasn't as crisp as I like it.  I would suggest turning the breasts mid way through baking to keep the crust drier.

Very good!  I would not add the extra bread crumbs and left over butter next time.  Made it taste to dry.

Simple and easy recipe, but a little bland for me. Next time I'm gonna kick it up with some extra spices in the bread crumbs and substitute panko for crispiness.

this recipe was really good, next time I will try marinating the chicken before hand to keep it jucier. It was a little dry for my taste.

So tasty!!! I used parmesan bread crumbs cuz the store I went to was all out of seasoned bread crumbs.  Other than that one little substitution it was wonderful.  I will be making this again.

This recipes was so simple for me to put together and cook.  My husband and myself really like garlic, so I did add 6 cloves (just as you stated in the recipe),  I thank you very much for this one.

Delicious!! I doubled the garlic, used half butter and half olive oil, and added quarater cup of parmesan cheese.  I shook the chicken in a baggie of seasoned bread crumbs and seared the chicken to seal the bread crumbs.  it was a huge hit, and will become a regular at our house. Thanks so much!

I received this in my e-mail and accidently read cornflake crumbs.  I loved it, but my habby insists there was an "aftertaste". I really liked the slight Garlic flavor and the kids ate it too.  I used jarred minced garlic, and prob. won't use as much next time.  I plan onmaking this again, only using less garlic than I did, and using breadcrumbs.  The cornflake crumbs didn't crisp at all.

Thank you soooo much for sharing K.Grecco. This was truly everything it said it would be. The chicken breasts were very tender. I did not have seasoned bread crumbs. However, I seasoned my "plain" bread crumbs with 2 tbsp of italian seasoning, 2tsps. of cajun seasoning, 1tsp. of cayenne pepper, 1 tsp. of crushed black pepper,and salt to taste. I blended all of these ingredients until thoroughly blended. My husband REALLY liked these. Thanks again for sharing. It seems as though I get better recipes from this website instead of the food network.com This will DEFINITELY go into my cooking rotation.

My husband and I aren't picky eaters at all but we both found this chicken very bland.  The coating was a little too buttery but not too bad, but no flavor reached the chicken at all.  I'd recommend maybe marinading the chicken overnight with something, and then coat it as per the recipe.  I don't think I'll be trying this one again though.

Well it only gets a 5 the way I made it... I used olive oil instead of butter. I used plainbeadcrumbs but seasoned with salt & italian seasoning. Awesome I also satueed fresh mushrooms in fat free butterspray with Marsala. Made great leftovers for the Panini machine using Swiss cheese & soft oatmeal bread. Definitely a keeper.

It's very tasty. I followed the recipe step by step. I found in the end that there's too much butter involved, and hence it's clearly an unhealthy dish. On the other hand, its very easy to do and moreover it only requires everyday ingredients. I'll definitely make it again.

This recipe was really, really good.  My hubby even liked (which says a lot)  He said that it tasted like KFC chicken.  LOL  I didn't have boneless/skinless on hand today but I had a whole chicken that was cut up in pieces and used that.  Still came out very good!!!  Will definitely make this again!!!

This is my 2nd time making this & it is sooo good. Surprizingly moist. I used both chicken breast & thighs(boneless). Next time I will add a little more garlic(just because I really like garlic). Great easy recipe!

This was a really good, quick weekday meal idea. Next time I will add more seasoning, and possibly some salt.

The name says it all...it was certainly easy!  It took exactly 1 hour to baked and had a good taste, although next time I might use more garlic.

I have to admit that looking at the ingredients I thought this chicken would be bland, but it turned out very tasty and moist!  A quick recipe using ingredients that everyone always has in their pantry.  Will definately make again!

This is probably my alltime favorite easy recipe.  The amount of garlic is sublime and it takes only a short amount of time to make.  I use either crushed cornflakes or bread crumbs as the breading and it turns out great every time. I usually just grate my garlic on a shredder and that way I get all the flavor. Great and tasty recipe.

Disappointing recipe.  I used half bread crumbs half romano cheese.  Sprinkled the chicken with herb chicken seasoning and salt and pepper prior to dipping in the butter.  The chicken was very bland despite my efforts to add extra flavor.  It was edible just not great.  I will not make it again.

Very easy, good, but a little bland. I used half the amount of bread crumbs, as a few people suggested before me, and that was plenty. Next time I'll try adding in some parmesan or ranch seasoning with the bread crumbs.

Eveyone seemed to like this. It was fairly easy to make. I thought it was kind of bland. I used chicken tenderloins and baked them on a cookie sheet. A quick and easy dish, but nothing over the top for me. I did as others suggested about adding parmesan to the crumbs.  If I were to use this again I would add alot more spices to give it some zing.

This was a very tasty chicken recipe and very quick.  I thought the garlic would be overwhelming but it wasn't.  The bread crumbs made a tasty coating and it kept the moisture in.  I did not add the leftover breadcrumbs though, that would have been too much.

Although this wasn't bad, it wasn't as good as we had hoped.  I did use olive oil instead of butter, but I still did not feel it was very flavorful.  Someone had mentioned that the breading overpowered the garlic flavor and I found the same was true of my version.  The crumbs were also gooey and not crisp in places (These were the crumbs on top).  If I make this again, I will stick strictly to the recipe and use fewer crumbs.

I have to say I was disapointed by this recipe.  It was just o.k...nothing special.  If I made it again, I would totally omit the bread crumbs and just crust the chicken with garlic and cook it in a mixture of olive oil and butter.  All you can taste is the bread crumbs in this recipe!

We loved this. I used Italian bread crumbs and just couldn't resist also adding garlic powder, pepper and italian seasonings to the butter/garlic sauce. Very easy and very delicious! By the way, used crushed garlic out of the jar, did I tell you how easy this was?? :-)

This was a wonderfully simple and tasty recipe.  I made it as described with great results, the breading turned out a very nice consistency.  The only thing I will change next time is to add fresh herbs.  I tried dried dill and garlic herb for a little kick, and while the flavor was good it would be excellent if a bit stronger.  I will make this again.

This is one of my favorite meals.  I was looking for a way of having chicken fingers without frying them and this turned out to be a great substitute!  I use a bit more garlic than called for (I love garlic), but otherwise follow the recipe exactly.  They always turn out flavorful and tender.  I serve with baked french fries.  Very delicious!  This meal has become a family favorite.

My family thought this chicken was great.  We are garlic lovers so I used garlic bread crumbs in addition to the garlic butter.  Near the end of the baking time, the crumbs on top started getting very brown.  I think I'll use part butter part oil next time to see if it makes a difference.  The flavor was great for such a simple recipe...I'll definitely make again.

Very flavorful, very crisp and juicy, but way to much garlic.  I am a garlic lover, but this is over the line.  I will try mincing (NOTE: not crushing) just 2/3 of the amount of garlic next time.
This tasted like crisp garlic toast breading on chicken.  My husband and I will be eating this again!

Mmmmmm good! Very easy to make and all my kids loved it! I used left over garlic bread from spaghetti night. Nothing goes to waste!
