This recipe is amazing, just amazing! Simple, easy, quick, yet beautiful and delicious. If you can refrigerate longer than an hour it's better. Any changes are strictly preference. Personally, I added a little less sugar and included carrots with the cucumbers and red onions. I doubled the recipe, plus added about 4 medium carrots, and tripled the vinegar mixture. There was 10 of us and I had only a small amount left; seriously, it was the easiest thing I made for my dinner party and the most popular!

Delicious but the picture shows tomatoes, which I included.  Either way I am sure it's a great refresher.

This is just like the cucumber salad at my favorite sushi restaurant I only modified the measurement of water 1/2 c hot , 1/2 c sugar and half cup rice vinegar .   I also added 1/2 T of crushed red pepper flakes just because I noticed it in the restaurants salad.   I could eat the whole bowl great on a hot summer day,

Simple, refreshing and super easy. (I left the peel on the cucumber, so even easier than the recipe.) I made some changes based on previous reviews and my own tastes. First, I started with 1/2 cup of rice vinegar instead of 1/4 cup of white vinegar. We like our dressings extra tangy, so I ended up with yet another splash of vinegar at the end. I also cut back on the onion just a bit, added slivered red pepper sprinkled in some fresh dill. With those changes, it earns all five stars for me (and my husband, too).

This tasted just like the salad served in my favorite Thai restaurant! I loved it! I added some thinly sliced red bell pepper to mine and it made it not only colorful, but added some depth of flavor too.

First batch I too thought it was a little sweet. I made a second batch and followed recipe exactly but added a pinch of cayenne pepper. This took away some of the sweetness and gave it a little kick (not too much tho)

This was a nice, easy and refreshing salad. I thought it was too sweet for my taste, so I will reduce the sugar next time. Also next time, I will experiment with adding herbs. I think dill will go with this quite well. A keeper!

I thought this was pretty good, but I used 3 medium sized cukes to 1 medium sized red onion and then doubled the rest of the ingredients.  I felt, as written, the ratio with 1 cucumber and 1 red onion, would have been too onion-y for my preferences.  Anyway, with the changes I made, I thought this was a good salad.  Thanks for sharing, PRACTICINGJOY!

Outstanding!
We moved from Los Angeles to the "the woods" in Oregon. The only thing we miss, outside of family and friends, is good food. Simply does not exist where were are. So now it's all about home cooking. We've been craving Thai and this little gem that always came with our delivery order of Chicken Satay.
Because I tend to like a tad more tang than sweet, I used equal parts of water, rice vinegar and sugar. I didn't have an onion in the house, so tossed in some slivered carrots and BAM! just like that, craving cured. 
Increditbly easy and super tasty. This one is a keeper, for sure!

Side note: Tried to add a finger tip as well, but decided against it. FYI, the blade on the mandolin is REALLY SHARP!
Next time, I'll go with the food processor for slicing and dicing. Ouch.

My family loves this salad! It tastes so fresh! I usually triple it and I had a sprinkle of crushed red pepper flakes to the vinegar mix just to give it a little heat. Delicious!

Yum!!
Very simple recipe, especially with a food processor! I used the recipe as a base with just a couple of changes: 
I used only 1/3 c. of sugar, and added carrots. Next time I'll use a larger slot for slicing the veggies as they were almost too thinly sliced! Will make again!

Amazing- but I left out the red onions. It was very refreshing to have on a warm day. Great side dish to have with a burger! Will definitely make again during the warmer months!!

I make this all the time when having Asian-inspired foods! Sooo delicious and a great cool/sweet complement to the warm/savory flavors of the main course! Absolutely a favorite.

Excellent!  I looked at the reviews and made the following 
adjustments:, 2 cucumber to 1 medium red onion. I used equal parts sugar, water and RICE vinegar--  3/4 cup.  Doubled salt and  added 2 teaspoons crushed red pepper flakes.  I cut fresh dill from the garden estimating a teaspoon.  I will definately make this again!

Very good and simple recipe. I used a little less sugar than called for, but that's just personal preference for less sweet dressing. Family loved it!

Very tasty salad!  Easy to modify to your tastes, personally I use not quite a 1/2 cup sugar.  If serving to kids, I use cider vinegar or rice wine vinegar for a more mild flavor.  Delicious when paired with a very simple grilled white fish or with sandwiches instead of potato salad.
