Quick, easy & tasty.  I put it on green beans, and my DH loved it on his pork chops.

This sauce seems to have good flavor, but its a very mild flavor not very strong so its hard to use it as a dipping sauce or glaze on otherwise tasty meat. You can really taste the flavors if you taste the sauce by itself, but other flavors will easily overpower this sauce.

**update** I have changed my rating from a 2 to a 3 after letting the sauce sit in the fridge a few days. This sauce improves dramatically if you give it time to sit. It was still a little too sweet in my opinion but the oil was not an issue anymore. I hate to do this. I really hate to do this but this recipe was no good. I made as written and I am not understanding the reason for the addition of oil. It seemed to incorporate in the sauce but once poured into the serving dish the oil just sat on the top. This was extremely loose, extremely oily, and extremely (and I mean extremely) sweet. I saved it in my fridge in hopes that it will get better in time but for now all I can say is that I did not care for this at all. I'm sorry.
