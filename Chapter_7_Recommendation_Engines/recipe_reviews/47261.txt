This salsa is great, it is very simple to make!!Restaurant quality, the taste is so fresh, the combination of the mango, beans,cilantro and corn are superb, my daughter is 4 and she eats it up, she will not touch anything with onions in it, and this recipe has onions in it she cannot tell.Great presentation for parties you have to try this one!!

Delicious!  I made this salsa a day ahead...glad I did, that really gave the flavors a chance to combine.  I substituted 2 teaspoons of Goya Adobo Seasoning for the one teaspoon of garlic salt.  I served the leftovers on top of grilled fish...soooo good!

This is FANTASTIC!  I made this for my son's 3rd b-day party, and it was gone in minutes, mostly due to my son eating great amounts of it!
A perfect BBQ side dish as well, and, it makes a yummy relish for grilled chicken & fish.
Updated: I now also add 1 tsp Red Wine Vinegar, double the cumin, a generous squeeze of lime,  and a tsp of sea salt.

This is a fantastic alternative to regular salsa.  It tastes best with salted tortilla chips (or with the chips with a touch of lime).  I added a can of diced hot jalapenos to give it a little more kick and I used red onions.  Letting it refrigerate over night makes it better.

It doesn't get better than this recipe!  Not only is this fabulous with baked chips for a healthy snack, but it is wonderful topped on grilled chicken or fish.  (I'm sure it would go well with pork as well)

The only thing I've had to substitute was the garlic salt.  I just combine granulated garlic and kosher salt.  The other thing I add is a finely diced chili pepper.

This is a summer staple in our household.

This "dip" is fantastic! We eat it as a side dish with quesadillas though and its a complete, refreshing summer meal. We also add more spices and a jalapeno.

This is REALLY delish!  Definitely will make it for my summer barbeque.  Try it, you won't regret it.  I added a finely diced fresh jalapeno pepper, a little more lime juice and a little bit more cumin and garlic salt...just because I like strong flavors.  I served it with baked pita crisps and could not stop eating it all weekend.  It is really light and refreshing!

This was so wonderful! Even my husband, who doesn't usually eat beans, loved it! I took it to a Cinco de Mayo party this spring, and served it with the tortillas with lime.

This is by far my new favorite summer dish! It's simple, easy to prepare, and really bursting with flavour.  I really enjoy this salsa served over corn cakes - it makes for a wonderful vegitarian dish that I can make in minutes!

This is an awesome salsa recipe...the mango gives it a slightly sweet taste.  I add 2 or 3 finely chopped jalapenos to give it some kick!  Even better the 2nd day!

this is a 5 stars...for sure!  i made it for some friends and they LOVED it. Everyone wanted the recipe it was gone in no time!  The sweetness from the corn and mango's..with the salty is yummy.  

I made a few changes (based on some other comments).  It needs 2 mangos!  there was not enough with just one.  I also added 1/2 a fresh jalapeno, finely diced (could maybe use a little more). And 2 small avacados. I also added a 4 oz can of green chilies - and a little salt and pepper!! yum!

I served it with some chips - but also as a "side" with a Tejas Chicken recipe!  mmmm...

This recipe is FABULOUS. My husband was skeptical about the mango but changed his mind and now makes it himself for every get together. He once made it and ate so much he had to make another batch. He adds a finely minced fresh jalepeno to give it a little added zing. We love it with Tostitos scoops so we can pile it on. I also made it for a ladies luncheon putting it over fresh salad greens and topping with grilled chicken, cheese and fried tortilla strips to garnish and got rave reviews.

Love this recipe...  It has a different but terrific (and addictive) taste, and the presentation is great!  I made it strickly as the recipe stated the first time, but have varied it a little since- all have been delicious!  My standard variation now is to use red onion, use regular can corn and 1/2 to 3/4 of one jalapeno pepper (instead of the mexicorn), and add a comination of minced fresh garlic, a little garlic powder, and some salt.  I also have found a little extra lime juice is nice too.  I was worried that it wouldn't be as good the last time I made it, because I couldn't get a fresh mango in December and had to use a jar of sliced mangos.  But it turned out to be as delicious as always!

This was a great recipe!  But do I agree with most of the other comments made for ways to improve it, 1. add something to spice it up (I used habaneros), and 2. let it sit in the refrigerator over night.  All around a definite addition to my list party favorites.  It is different and gives the impression that it was a lot harder to make than it really is.

This recipe is an excellent alternative to the usual tomato salsa.  I was looking for a way to use up a mango before it got too ripe, and this is the way to go!  I did not have any Mexicorn so I substituted regular canned corn and canned jalapenos.  I agree with previous reviewers who said to increase the amount of seasoning, and I also think this improves a great deal if allowed to sit in the refrigerator overnight so the flavors can meld.

Great recipe! I used regular corn but added fresh jalapenos. Also, I was out of black beans, so I used some fresh avocado instead. It was delicious even without the black beans, and I'll definitely make it again.

I have been using this website for some time, and have been very negligent in giving reviews.  However, I have made this recipe so many times, and the bowl is always empty at the end of any function to which I take it.  Low Fat, healthy, easy to make, what more can you ask?

This colorful salsa was a BIG hit at a recent dinner!  Everyone raved about it and wanted the recipe.  The night before I was to attend the dinner, I made the salsa to try it out--my husband ate the whole bowl!  I added 1 fresh diced jalepeno for a little extra spice and grated the peel of one lime for a little fresh kick.  I will make this again and again.

Excellent with tortilla chips but I also good served over snchiladas.  I like each of these flavors individually and they are great together.  Sweet (mango) and spicy (I used half a fresh jalapeno).

Easy and really good.  The mango gives it a nice fresh taste. I used red onion, a lot of mango, regular corn, a few spoonfuls of canned jalapenos and fresh garlic and sea salt in place of garlic salt (never buy the stuff).  I made this about 12 hours in advance, the texture and color stayed nice.  Just before serving I stirred in a small amount of olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  Initially the cumin tasted nasty to me, but it mellowed after 12 hrs. in the fridge.

I've been making a variation of this for years. I use Rose's Lime juice rather than fresh and cayenne rather than cumin and prefer that combination (I love spicy/sweet).

It is excellent over lime/cumin marinated and grilled chicken breasts OR dust the chicken breasts in corn meal/flour and saute in a little butter.

A staple in my house.

What could be easier to make? Takes all of ten minutes to make, and only because of the chopping. I served this to a militant vegan who adored it. It tastes absolutely amazing. However, it is a little odd looking, so don't try to serve it at your average neighborhood picnic or this gem will be passed over.

This is great.  The only change I made was that I doubled the cilantro (but then again, I LOVE fresh cilantro).

Easy to make and delicious. The final product is somewhat 'heavy' so be sure and serve with firm chips.

VERY good! I made this a day ahead and took it to a mexican-themed pot luck, it was really tasty served with lime flavoured tortilla chips! I did add a couple of diced jalapeno peppers, which I think added a lot of flavour. I ate the leftovers the next day, and it was even better!

This was good but not great.  It needs some kicking up with seasonings, etc.  It was easy, though.

Colorful and delicious as is.  But I have started adding chopped tomatoes and minced jalapeños from the garden.  I also don't use the canned corn with red peppers because it is too expensive.  I use plain canned corn and add my own red peppers (or not).  This is great with chips or as a side dish/accompaniment to fish or other dishes.

I made this recipe yesterday and the guest loved the sweet and salty favor of this salsa.  I did modified it to add 2 mangos and one jalapeno pepper and one can of chilies.  It's so simple and yummy!

So easy to make and so delicious. I love it with blue corn chips. I also sometimes add diced tomatoes ("Mexican Fiesta" from Red Gold tastes great) for a little more variety.

Tasty!  It is simple and healthy.  I enjoyed it rolled in a store-bought tortilla (soft), and also spread on a tortilla with some cheese sprinkled on top.  That way you do not get the fat from chips (of course you can make a point of buying or making healthy chips, though).  Used 2 small mangoes, no cilantro, a few shakes of garlic powder instead of garlic salt (are they different?), and no peppers in the corn.

Wow! I served this at a get-together, and the first comment was "this is interesting." After a few bites, everybody was raving. It's a sweet alternative to regular tomato salsa. Next time I make this I will substitute regular table salt and fresh minced garlic for the garlic salt. Try this salsa on a burrito or vegetable tortilla wrap.

The local grocery store had this as a sample and also gave out the recipe. I loved it the way the recipe was originally when I tasted it at the store, then the next day when I made it at home I doubled the corn and mango, and added 2 chopped jalapenos. It was fabulous that way, too.

FANTASTIC. I take this to many many summer outings and after coaxing a few the "picky" to at least taste it, I win everyone over. Have not had one person not like it and there are never any left overs. Occasionally my mangos aren't ripe enough and somewhat bitter so I sprinkle with sugar and toss in the microwave to soften. YUM YUM YUM

Made this with "Chile Pork," also from allrecipes, and it is an amazing compliment of flavors for a low-carb, low-fat meal.  We are planning to make this at an upcoming dinner party with "Chicken Tortilla Soup V" also from this site.

YUM! YUM! YUM! This is fast, easy and great tasting and don't you just love the name? A must for any Latin themed dinner. I have passed this recipe on to everyone I have served it to. I prefer using thawed out frozen corn in place of the canned corn. Anyhow you must try this one, you won't be sorry.

I was a little disappointment with this.  The cilantro was a bit overpowering and I felt like it was missing something.  Maybe some jalapeno would spice it up.

I totally loved this. I have to admit I was completely skeptical of fruit salsa, but I thought it was amazing.  I loved how fresh it tasted, and it was a really welcome change from regular salsa.  I made a spicy (added fresh hot peppers) and a non spicy and they both went pretty quick.

I made this for a backyard tiki garden party and it was perfect. I doubled the recipe, but it made ALOT.  Next time I will double the mango, but not the beans, or corn if I want to make a large batch, because doubling everything made an insane amount of salsa.

I Loved this! It was light and healthy-no oil, just lime juice. The mango and bean combo is terrific. Thanks.

Just made this for a party.  Everyone liked it and couldn't stop eating it.  Next time I think I'll try a little bit more mango.  Thanks for the recipe.

Yum!  The perfect mix of sweet and spicy.  I used regular canned corn and added mira sol green chilis for extra heat.  I love adding this salsa to burritos, tacos or tostatadas with spanish rice, sour cream, beef and beans.

It's almost a five-star recipe. Needs a bit more kick. I added extra jalapenos and a serrano pepper for more fire. Also chopped in a red bell pepper. Served it as an out-of-the-ordinary side dish alongside a Southwest Pepper Jack Chicken main course and my friends loved it! Will definitely make this one again.

Really good!! I did not have canned corn so put in some thawed frozen corn. Is great as is however the next time I think I will throw in some peppers. Used over baked fish and as a dip with some chips.

This is a very versatile recipe, and especially delicious if made the day before. I've served it exactly as written, and also added chunky salsa. Rave reviews both ways. This is my most often-requested recipe.

I didn't like this much -  I ended up adding about a cup of Salsa and 1/2 cup sour cream just to give it some flavor and then it was good. The recipe itself though was a bit of a let down.

For more of a soupy salsa, add about a 1/2 cup of your favorite salsa to the mixture.  This is a great combo!

I used what I thought was a medium mango, but I think it needed just a little more. Overall, it's a wonderful salsa.

Fabulous salsa. Not spicy enough for my family but that is easy enough to fix. Was just as good after spending the night in the fridge. I will definitely be sharing this recipe!

I made this recipe exactly as listed and loved it!  The only reason I'm giving it four stars instead of five is that many other people tried it and liked it, but it wasn't a "must have" recipe for them.  However, I will continue to make this, especially for cookouts since I think it will hold up well without refrigeration.

SUPER!  Everyone at my party enjoyed it.  I liked it even better after a night in the fridge.  I followed the recipe, but did not realize that I was out of cumin (and I know that would have made the salsa!) so instead, I added more galic and salt.  Next time I will use the cumin.

Not a huge fan.  I made it way ahead of time for a party but still didn't feel that the flavors blended well.  I also added jalapenos, but just wasn't crazy about it.  I bet it would be good over chicken or fish, though.
