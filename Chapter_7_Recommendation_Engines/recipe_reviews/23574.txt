My mom has this recipe in her recipe box. She told me that she has made it before and enjoyed it. So, everyone who is writing these reviews: If you have not tried a recipe, why even bother to review it? You don't need to be rude about it either. Remember the old saying: "If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all?"

This recipe is great!  Of course it's sanitary!  It's run at very high temperatures.  If you wrap the salmon in a several layers very tightly you can even run dirty dishes with it!

I first saw this done on TV on a show called "The Surreal Gourmet". It was just one part of a very surreal dinner, and it looked so good that I had to try it, and it works great.

And no, it's not a waste of water. Wrap it in heavy foil, make very sure it's airtight, and wash your dishes with it. He even mentioned on the show that you can do that. If anything, by making the dishload dual-purpose you are saving on electricity.

But what this recipe is really all about is the looks on your guests faces as you pull their entree out of the dishwasher. Absolutely priceless!

Pretty tasty fish :)  Although as per an earlier comment on the sanitary nature of the recipe.. I don't think you're supposed to put dirty dishes in there with the fish.  I wrapped it tightly and 'washed' it all by itself, and it was fine :)

Excellent! I used butter and lemon generously on the salmon before sealing it in the aluminum foil. There were rave reviews by our company going when this was served. It was very moist, and our company was in agreement that never had they had more tasty salmon served, even in a fine dining restaurant. This is something that will be served often in my home, and it will be dishwasher cooked forevermore!   Judy

Although my review probably won't be read, since so many others have reviewed this recipe...  It was the best salmon I have ever had!!!!  Hands down.  This idea is geneous.  I used all the recipe ingredients then added garlic powder and onion powder.  It couldn't have turned out better.  I used salmon steaks.  I was a little worried about not having a backup plan, but it turned out to be the most juicy, moist, and flavorful salmon I have ever had!!!!!!!!!!
Thanks again for this recipe.  I don't know if I will ever cook salmon in the oven ever again.

Awesome!!Turned out very good and my husband was very impressed. Very light and nicely steamed, will definately make again! I feel sorry for those individuals who can make negative comments about something they havn't even tried, they are going to give up some of the best experiences in life just because they won't try something new. I put it in the dishwasher with dishes I rinsed well and didn't add soap. I put it on normal cycle and heat dry-  turned out perfect!(and clean dishes!)

Far Out & it was absolutely the best!! Upon reading the recipe I had to giggle, this must be a joke, the dishwasher! Tried it for fun & since it was obviously cooked I tried it,and I giggled again as it was delicious! Put it quickly back in the dishwasher, so I could ask my husband for his help in getting our food on the table. Next time I'll have my daughter take out the meal! Besides it's too good to ever cook it any other way. Negative people who review without even trying could write a book about all the fantastic stuff they miss out on!!

Cooked perfectly - and obviously worth it for the look on people's faces when you say "Oh, be a dear, get your dinner out of the dishwasher would you?"

I have had more fun with this recipe, so I just had to submit another review.  This method is the only way we cook our salmon now as it comes out much better than it ever did when I would cook it on the stove or in the oven.  The conventional method I always struggled with over cooking, or saturating the salmon in too much oil to try and keep it moist while making sure it is done.  No matter what favorite seasonings you use, if its not cooked right its not an enjoyable dinner.  With the dishwasher you can do a variety of different seasonings for a change in flavor, wrap it up, and then forget about it as it does its own perfect cooking in the dishwasher.  It is fun telling this method of cooking to the people who work in the meat department at my favorite grocery stores.  They always think I am pulling their leg and laugh at me.  I just laugh back and tell them to go to allrecipes.com and put salmon cooked in the dishwasher to get the recipe.  This recipe is truly a must try for anyone who enjoys a perfectly cooked salmon with whatever seasonings you like. If you are having company and want some fun, don't forget to ask someone to help you dish up the food.  Give someone the job of putting the salmon on a platter.  They will see its not on the stove, so they open the oven door.  When their puzzled face turns to you, just calmly reply, oh, its in the dishwasher.

I would honestly give the recipe a four, because the fish wasn't hot enough after just the five minutes from dishwasher to dinner table. But I can't give it less than a perfect score after the look on my wife's face when she found out!

This is insanity.  It is also serendipity.  Would suggest using a zip-
lock type bag (not the press and seal type as these can open) if you actually
wash dishes while cooking the salmon.
Also get as much air as possible out of
bag to avoid expansion popping seal. No
other suggestions.  Can't improve on perfection.

Yes, yes.  I thought this was a joke, too but I decided to give it a try.  I used two one-half copper river salmon filets for it.  I had to change the spices a little because I didn't have those listed at home.  Threw the fillets in and set the dishwasher and off it went.  When the wash cycle was done, I decided to check on them.  To my surprise, they were done perfectly.  So freakin' moist and flakey...  Bravo to whomever discovered this way of cooking.

Great recipe. Simple to make. I cooked the foil packet in the oven for 20-25 minutes at 350 instead of the dishwasher.

I loved this recipe!  My cousins from Alaska gave me one of their King Salmon they'd caught and thought to try this one out!  Turned out to be the best I've ever had.  I tried a couple of pieces with different ingredients...Soy sauce, sesame oil, scallions, or just adding oregano to the original recipe was great.  I shared this with my cousins and they only wished they had a dishwasher after I raved about how moist this Salmon was.  Only had one problem, a little water got into the foil.  Next time I'll enclose the salmon in a zip lock for extra protection.  I'm going to try this one with other types of fish, I'll bet it'll work just as well!  What a hoot to cook in the dishwasher!  And man...no pots, pans, it's great!

I wasn't sure how to rate this recipe since I combined it with the Asian Salmon recipe I found on this site, but I wanted to try to counter the negative ratings this recipe got.  This was WONDERFUL!  What an easy way to cook dinner, and the salmon came out moist and delicious.  I will never cook salmon any other way, regardless of the recipe that I use.

Thanks for a great (if a little strange!) idea!

I thought this was a JOKE or something! I really thought it was rather ridiculous until I started reading the reviews.. Then I thought, what the heck, i'll try it. OMG! This is the BEST fish I have ever made!! And I am a very good cook, and have I dined at a lot of extravagant resturaunts. I didn't use the suggested spices. I used my own blend: olive oil, a bit of sherry, lemon pepper, garlic salt, fresh tarragon, oregano, & parsley, and two slices of fresh lemon on top. The herbs made it so pretty. I would have used the dill weed, but I didn't have any. Delicious!! As for the dishwasher, I just wrapped everything in the foil, stuck the packets in ziploc freezer bags, and ran it in my dishwasher with a full load of dishes, soap & all! It was unbelievably tender and juicy, and so evenly cooked. Just perfect. Amazing. My husband just stared when I told him how I made it, like "are you serious"? and NOTHING ever shocks him. He loved it! I am SO going to do this with my mother in law sometime. Just imagine the look on her face! It's funny just thinking about it. I am sold. I am never going back to my oven for salmon!
Wow.

My 10 yr old looked at me with distrust and demanded to know what my backup plan was "in case this doesn't work out..." Well, he gave it two thumbs up and asked me to make it in the dishwasher again. The extra piece I cooked and warmed up at work the next day was just as delicious. I wrapped the fillets in two separate layers of heavy duty foil and ran a full load of dishes with soap. My son and I can't wait to have company over for a fish dinner!

I can't believe this turned out so well! Perfectly cooked, super tasty, and fun to do.  I ran it through on the heavy wash cycle with detergent with no problems. The best part was the whole house didn't smell fishy when cooking!  How unfair for people to rate low without giving it a shot.

Unbelieveable!  This really worked great!  I seasoned mine a little differently and it was perfectly cooked, no mess!!!!!  I had made a salad, put it in the fridge, ran the dishwasher, put the kids to bed, came downstairs, pulled the foil out (perfectly dry/not drippy/messy), cut the foil, pulled out the fish, plopped it on the lettuce, and had an excellent meal.  GREAT CONCEPT!  Many thanks, I will try this again and again!

Oh this was so much fun!  I double wrapped it in foil, then I put the fish in a small sandwich size container and seal the lid.  Ran with dirty dishes and soap.  Had to check a couple of times because the lid popped up, but just re-seal it.  The fish was done exactly how I like it.  
Perfectly lovely idea.

Wow!  Very moist and delicious.  I will have to try this again.  My husband thinks I'm crazy, but he also said it was the best salmon I have ever made.  It gets 4 stars because I thought it was a little bland, but the cooking method was right on!

It was an interesting concept and fun to try - unfortunately my dishwasher didn't provide the restaurant-quality cooking that nearly everyone else seemed to get!  This was just OK - no better than salmon I've baked in the oven in terms of moistness.  I didn't care for the mix of seasonings in the recipe.  Maybe I'll try again someday with a different dishwasher and different seasonings!

I used the idea of the dishwasher, with different seasonings.  I used mayo with dill and sea salt.  It came out of the dishwasher not cooked well enough, so I stuck it in the oven for 15 minutes at 350.  It was a nice idea, but it didn't work for me!

This was great! I told my husband what I was doing and he looked at me really funny. I have never cooked salmon before and I hate fish but figured I needed to eat better and I am glad I chose this recipe to start out with. It didn't have the fishy taste I don't like and it was really tender.

When I came across this recipe and read all the reviews, I had to try it.  I used my own seasonings, a mixture of oregano, basil, thyme, garlic salt and rosemary, and it was wonderful!  My 6 year old daughter turned up her nose at it when she saw me take it out of the dishwasher, but when she tasted it, she asked if I would make this one again!  Very good and super convenient, as I washed a full load of dirty dishes with my salmon.

Yummy recipe!!!! Only downside is the length of cooking time.  Cause if you cheat at all, its not quite done.  More seasonings and lemon juice wouldn't hurt either, but if you have the time, def. a great way to cook your salmon!!

I like the idea of cookie supper and cleaning up at the same time.  It'll save some electricity and is interesting none the less.  I plan on letting my kids try this one as an example of creative thinking, encouraging them to think outside of the box, or oven, that is!

This did not turn out for me. I had to finish it off in the oven. It was a fun idea, but it just didn't pan out.

We tried this recipe out of curiosity. We did have dishes in the washer, but we did not use any soap. The salmon wasn't very warm when the cycle was finished, so we put it in the microwave for a few seconds. Tasted good though.
