EUREKA!  I've found it!  The PERFECT cookie.  It doesn't get better than this.  I tweaked it a bit by using traditional old-fashioned oats instead of quick oats (all I had on hand).  I added one extra cup of oats (3 c. total), a dash of cinnamon, and a 1/2 bag of white chocolate chips (they were in the pantry!) to the printed recipe.  This is truly the BEST cookie I have ever had.  Perfect texture, sweetness, and flavor.  My kids are loving them and they usually don't like oatmeal cookies.  We will make this one again and again.  Thanks for sharing!

Yummy!  this could use some pecans/walnuts in it too though.  also, I recommend mixing the 
(c)raisins with the flour mix before adding it to the wet mix to make it easier on mixing

This is wonderful! I make these all the time and everyone loves them!! They always end up asking for the recipe to make for themselves. There is a different texture to them, depending if you use margerine or butter. With margerine I find them to be more thick. But using butter is definately my choice. I find that it gives them a better flavor. Personally, I don't add the raisins but just add more craisins to it. Even fussy kids who don't like raisins love them! If you're looking for a great cookie recipe, definately choose this one!!

This is a very good recipe- quick, easy and tasty. I used 1C reg flour and 1C wheat flour, ommitted the raisens and added choco chips & nuts to the cranberries. I like the fact that this recipe is versatile-- I highly recommend this recipe to anyone who's interested in giving a new twist to oatmeal cookies.

These were so great!  They were gone in 3 hours after they were baked, and I took them to some of my college friends and they loved them, and asked me to bake more.  I did add a few extra Craisins instead of raisins, ( I dont like raisins much) and it was still a hit!  :) you cant go wrong with these!  I did decrease the cooking time a bit, and they were softer and made them more chewy.  :)

I made these cookies and added 1 t. cinnamon. I really like the consistency of the dough, every other recipe for oatmeal cookies that I've made have been real crumbly and tried to fall apart on me, but these really held together, and my whole family liked them!

This was really good because I used ingredients I already had on hand. I added the extra cup of oats and a little cinnamon. This is my new oatmeal cookie. I like it because it is not full of spices that leave a strong aftertaste. Thanks!

I followed the recipe exactly except I used margarine instead of butter and my cookies melted while they were baking! They ended up as blobs of messy,sticky raisins and cranberries in sugar and oats.

SO YUMMY!! I've made these twice this month... 1st time I omitted the raisins and added 1c chopped pecans, 1tsp cinnamon, dash of nutmeg... delicious. 2nd time kept raisins and added the same extras + 1/2c sliced almonds... equally delicious!! Results in perfect oatmeal cookies no matter how you mix it up.

I took the advice to add 1c oats, 2 tsp cinnamon, & to use 2c craisins rather than a mix with raisins.  These are delicious!  Very flavorful, great texture.

Great recipe! I made several changes based on what I had on hand. I used 5 ounces of dried cherries, 1 cup of chopped pecans, 1/2 cup of white chocolate, the instant oats were whole grain, I substituted 1/2 cup of wheat flour for the all purpose. I baked a few with using the spoon method and a few using the "make into a ball and flatten a bit" method. I prefer to make them into balls (1 - 1.5inch) and flatten a bit. They cook evenly. HOWEVER if you prefer a bit raw in the middle and crispy edges, definitely just spoon onto cookie pan. Either way, these cookies were scrumptious!!

Best oatmeal cookie recipe ever!  These were delicious.  I made them without the raisins and added a little cinnamon.  Then for a Valentine's Day treat after the cookies cooled I cut them into heart shapes with a cookie cutter then melted some white chocolate and dipped half the hearts.

The cookies taste okay to me but I think the recipe calls for too much sugar. They taste too sugary. 1 cup of brown sugar may be enough instead of also adding another cup of white sugar? They were a bit more soft in the centre than I would have liked them to be (possibly because I used margarine instead of butter?)

I've been making these for several years from a similar recipe...they are so good...I omit raisins bc we don't like them but I might try them with golden raisins...I like to reconstitute the dried fruit for a bit in warm wate so they plump up a bit and are delicious!

This recipe is fabulous!  Not too sweet, not dry, not too hard or too soft.  I changed the steps a bit.  I creamed the butter and the sugars for about 5-7 minutes before adding the eggs and vanilla.  I also added a teaspoon of cinnamon and a dash of pumpkin pie spice.  Then I mixed in all the dry ingredients by hand. I made them with two cups of oatmeal, because that's all I had, but next time, I'm going to add another cup of oatmeal.  I left out the raisins, added bittersweet chocolate chips (1 cup), about 3/4 cup chopped pecans, and 1 1/4 cup craisins.  The 1 cup of chocolate chips is perfect, but next time, I'm going to add two cups of craisins and a full cup of pecans.  These cookies don't melt per se, but they do spread so space them out.  I like my cookies chewy but not soft, so I rolled balls of dough and pressed them down.  They still ended up baking for 10-12 minutes.  These cookies got rave reviews.  This recipe is so versatile.  Next time, I'm going to try it with dried cherries and almonds.

Loved this recipe! I had an extra bag of Craisins hanging around so I set out to find a good way to use them. I was so thrilled to find an amazing cookie to put them in to. My husband doesnt like raisins so I doubled the craisins. Other then that I followed the recipe exact. Came out perfect! I will be making these again for sure. Easy, Yummy...can one ask for any thing more?

I increased brown sugar to 1 and 1/2 cups and decreased white sugar to 1/2. Subbed almond extract for vanilla and also added 1 cup chocolate chips. Cookies were crisp and chewy and had a festive look with chips and cranberries for Christmas. Also made cookies a bit larger and decreased cook temp to 325 and extended time a few minutes. Excellent flavor and texture.

Added extra oats and a dash of cinnamon.  Left out the raisins but added more craisins.  Also, used splenda brown sugar 1/2 cup and only 3/4 cup sugar.  My son is diabetic so I like to reduce sugar when I can.  They tasted plenty sweet, now if I could just only eat 2 instead of 4 at one sitting!

With recommendations from other reviewers, it's a 5-star recipe.  I added the third cup of oats and doubled the craisins, omitting the raisins.  However, I did a few things of my own: Soaked craisins in 1.5 tbl brandy and the juice of 1 orange, mixed with zest of same orange (orange and cranberry were made for each other!).  Added 1 cup chopped walnuts.  This yielded delicious, fragrant cookies that have already started disappearing!

For 2 years we would go to a gas station in Whittenburg, WI. and buy homemade cookies from an Indian woman called "Oatmeal Cranberrie Walnut" cookies.  Well they got to expensive so I went on a search and found these.  Ohhhh My!!!!  The best cookie I have ever tasted.  Only problem was I have arthritis and had to buy a stand mixer but it was worth it. My husband has to have a cookie everyday or he gets very crabby.

I was going through the cabinet to find the craisins and came across a bag of honey roasted pecan pieces. I added those and a bag of butterscotch chips.  YUMMY!!! I will absolutely make these again!!

After making the same cookies year after year, I was looking for something a little different.  I found it here!  They were great, and I followed the recipe without any changes.

These are the BEST! Nice and chewy.Not too sweet either. The men of the house devoured them. Made them exactly as recipe EXCEPT rolled the dough in bowl with sugar and nutmeg before baking for extra spice. Great Cookie & keeps well (if you hide them).

Excellent...baked exactly per recipe.  No chocolate, no nuts, no cinnamon...just honest to goodness taste-the-oats-raisins-craisin chewy perfection.  Calls to mind the simple perfection of Grandma Ople's apple pie.  Made 8 doz. with my small scoop.

Wow these are good, so good.  I did cut back on the sugar a bit but otherwise followed the recipe. The one thing I will say is the serving size is way off.  I ended up with 4 dozen cookies.  Not too bad though because now I have plenty for the freezer.

So far these are the best oatmeal raisin cookies i've made. The first time I followed the recipe exactly and they came out great but I found that I had to reduce the cooking time by at least 2 minutes or else they would come out hard. The second time I baked these cookies I used half butter and half butter flavored shortening and they were just as tasty. I would recommend reducing the cooking time by 2 minutes if you want a softer cookie. They might look like they're not quite done but that's fine. When they cool down they will be perfect.

The base alone for these cookies is fantastic, so adding in the craisins and white chocolate chips (in the place of raisins) made for a delicious final product. Also, I added in 2/3 cup of both add-ins because 1 cup seemed excessive

Totally awesome! I was able to use a lot of odds and ends from my pantry to make these. The only thing I tweaked was I put white chocolate chips in to use up a bag I had. Delicious!

This recipe is amazing.  Seriously.  I've been making some mean chocolate chip cookies for years...and this comes close to overtaking them in taste.  I used a stick of butter and 1/2 cup of canola oil, old-fashioned oats instead of instant, and a bag of blueberry infused Craisins (no raisins on hand) and the cookies are amazing.  My oven tends to run hot but baking for 13 minutes was perfect.

These cookies were great. I didn;t have any raisins in the house, so I subbed in chopped dates and also added some chopped pecans. Delicious. Definitely will use this recipe many times!!!

So I think I've found a way to incorporate more cranberries into my diet ;)  This cookie is AMAZING! I mixed and matched some previous suggestions - omitted the raisins and added an additional cup of Craisins, added an additional 1/2c of oatmeal, and I added about 1c. of finely chopped walnuts. I wound up with 31 cookies total and can't wait to distribute them to friends and family (saving some for myself too, of course)

These cookies were very good. I asked my husband if he wanted oatmeal cookies. He stated "they are ok" I surprised him and brought him some to work. He said those were GREAT. I said that's good he said no they were REALLY GOOD. I don't even care that much for oatmeal cookies. I doubled the craisins since we don't like raisins. I used 1 cup white flour and 1 cup whole wheat flour. I used others advice and used 3 cups of oats. I was not able to spoon the dough on the cookie sheet. I had to roll them into balls. I would have liked them a little flatter like regular cookies. They came out almost like balls. Maybe when I make them next time I will add not as much oats like 2 and 1/2cups or 2 and 3/4cups. I will also add white chocolate or chocolate chips next time. This recipe is definitely a keeper! My husband said these were probably some of his favorite cookies that I have ever made.

Excellent cookies! They are crispy and chewy and disappear fast.  I took a spoonful of dough and dipped it in cinnamon sugar mix then dropped on cookie sheet.  This really made a big difference.  I also only used craisins and no raisins.

These cookies are so yummy!  I could eat the whole batch!  I was a little heavy on the oats and used craisins and golden raisins.  The cookies kept a nice shape - not too thick but not too thin.  Even clean-up was relatively easy since all of the ingredients are in increments of 1 cup or 1 tsp - only two measuring utensils to wash.  I'll definitely make this recipe again!

This recipe may be my new favorite oatmeal cookie recipe.  These cookies are fabulous.  Not too sweet, perfect amount of oats to the ratio of dried fruits.  I made the recipe exactly as written with the exception of halving the amount of salt, contemplating adding chopped walnuts or pecans however decided against it.  Adding chopped nuts would have worked but I think the recipe is perfect as written.  Other than reducing the salt amount, I wouldn’t make any additional changes.  Thanks for sharing such a wonderful oatmeal cookie recipe!

These were absolutely amazing! This was my first attempt at oatmeal cookies and they turned out great. I followed the recipe except I did add white chocolate chips. They would have been amazing even without the chocolate chips. Great recipe! Definitely adding this to my cookie recipe rotation. :)

OK, so I've baked oatmeal raisin cookies before (about a hundred times) and honestly, after using this recipe I don't think I'll use another.  I did what the previous person did...added one more cup of oats, added white chips for extra sweetness (about 3/4 cup), and also added a dash or two of cinnamon (only b/c it goes well in an oatmeal cookie) and this recipe was fantastic.  the cookies were nice and moist....but most of all they had a terrific taste.  Thanks for the great recipe!!!!!

Good flavor, nice texture...the delightful crunch when you bite into it, then a nice chewiness that lasts til the end... yum. Just a tad on the flat side for my liking, otherwise good.

Great recipe!  I didn't have any raisins so I doubled the craisins and "plumped" them by beating the eggs, vanilla (which I doubled) and some cinnmon in a bowl and letting the craisins sit in the mixture for about an hour.    I will make this again.

This recipe was a definite hit. I made these cookies and took them to a family party last weekend; they loved them!  My aunt and cousin (who are both amazing cooks) asked for the recipe! The only thing I did differently from the recipe was that I added chocolate chips in the mix and didn't use raisins at all.  It was tasty!

I really like this recipe, and so does everyone that tries the cookies.  I don't use any raisins, though.  I just add 1/2 cup more craisins and 1/4 - 1/2 cup chopped walnuts.

These were SOOOOOOO good!  The were perfectly moist and chewy.  Next time I will put the batter in the freezer for about 10 minutes before I ball it onto the cookie sheet because the cookies spread out a little too much.  But otherwise, I will be making this recipe again and again!

Inconsistent! Half the cookies spread in baking and half bake perfect! All the reviews claim either over-mixing or under-mixing is why. I'll just use a different recipe next time! Its an oatmeal cookie recipe, it shouldn't be so temperamental.

Great recipe!! Cookies turned out perfectly crunchy and chewy at the same time. I followed the recipe exactly, only added a tsp of ground cinnamon and used old fashioned oats since that was what I had at home and also left out the craisins because I didn't have any. Made no difference, they're simply delicious!

This recipe is amazing. I've been looking for a different oatmeal cookie recipie than I usually use and this won me over.  The  only changes I made was doubling the vanilla , also used 2 cups craisins, and my baking time was 10 minutes as I like my cookies soft and chewy.  The best and favorite cookie recipe I've made yet!

I was really worried about the amount of dry ingredients. I used my hands to mix in the cranberries and make sure the dry ingredients were mixed well. I used all cranberries and added a 1/4 tsp fresh ground nutmeg.  They baked up wonderfully! I only gave it 4 stars because they were very sweet.

I swapped the tsp vanilla for 1/2 tps lemon extract (trust me it works sooo well with the craisins!) and added 1c chopped walnuts. I used half butter half margarine to get good flavor AND good texture.  Next time Im going to throw in some chia sead for nutrition.

These are great!  I little tricky to mix because the dough is so thick, but they make such excellent cookies that it is worth a little extra work.  I think next time I might make these with just dried cranberries.

I gave these a shot today, and YUM! I followed the recipe amounts exactly, only changing 1/2 raisins to all craisins (hubby and I don't like raisins). Everything else was identical to the recipe - I wanted to be able to review the recipe on it's own merit, not altered. The cookies came out tasty and perfect! A little crispy on the edges, a little chewy around the craisins. While still warm, they remind me of the 'crisp' on top of apple crisp. I will be making these again, for sure!

Superb cookies for those with a sweet tooth; I might reduce the sugar by 1/2 cup next time. The only change made this time was increasing the oats to 3 cups. This is basically the same recipe as the Oatmeal Raisin Cookies VII, but without the cinnamon (which I see many reviewers adding anyway).

These cookies were amazing!!!!!! I was told they were the best cookies people had ever tasted. My son and I made them with a slight change. We omitted the raisins and used dried cranberries and the Nestle white chocolate holiday swirl chips. A very delicious combo and very festive looking. I'm actually going to be making them for an upcoming cookie exchange!

These are REALLY good with a couple of changes. I HATE raisins so I used all craisins. I also reduced the white sugar to 1/2 a cup. They were plenty sweet and delicious. Thanks for the awesome cookie recipe!!

We loved these! We used real butter, and left out the raisins - doubling the amount of Craisins (the cherry flavored ones) to make up for the lost volume. We also added a cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips. YUUUUUUUM!

I added that extra cup of oats and the consistency was perfect.  I used the cherry-flavored Craisins (1 c.) and chocolate chips (1 c.) for a fun Valentine treat, they were amazing!!!  Even without the extras they make great cookies.

It was just right with one more cup of oatmeal (3 c total).  I also used regular oats.  Only put 1/2 c white sugar and a little less butter...everything else was the same.  Will be making these again and again--thanks!

These turned out pretty darn good.  I love craisins and I figured I needed to start cookin with them instead of just eating them handfuls at a time.  The cookies are pretty sweet and crispy.  They were good, but I prefer a softer cookie so I will try them with a little more oatmeal and make some other changes next time.  When I work it out, I will post the recipe!

Wonderful! I substituted 1 cup dried cherries and 1 cup white chocolate chips for the raisins and cranberries. I also substituted orange extract for the vanilla. My local bakery makes a cookie that I love with dried cherries. These were as good or better!

I followed the recipe to a T. Cookies spread out too much. WAY too much baking soda. They stuck to a greased cookie sheet and are inedible because they fall right apart.

 Don't try to make this.

Amazing cookies. Like a lot of reviewers I opted to use all butter and omit the shortening. I also used all craisons.  I added a teaspoon of allspice but will likely double it the next time. These cookies came out chewy and delicious.  I ended up with 39 cookies at about 3 in diameter.  I am definitely making these again.

Excellent cookie recipe. My husband has no will power when it comes to these cookies. I had no trouble with any of the ingredients. I used unsalted butter and added a little more salt to compensate. I will be making these again and again.

Crisp and chewy texture. I made these exactly as the recipe was written, no changes (what a concept, right?)  This is midway between a straight-up flour cookie dough and a full-on, heavy oatmeal cookie. Thank you Liane!

This was my first attempt at making these, but will not be the last!  I didn't have any raisins so I just used 2 cups of craisins that I had in the freezer.  Delicious!  Thanks for the recipe!

Great cookies! Recipe is a keeper! 
Butter kept the cookies moist and chewy. I used regular oats, because that is what I had on hand. Omitted the raisins doubled the Craisins and added 1 cup of pecans. Will add these to my recipe file.

Excellent! I used unsalted butter, old fashioned oats, added half a teaspoon of cinnamon and used 1.5 cups of craisins and 1cup of white choc chips. They baked perfectly in fourteen minutes, have a great texture and are uniform. And they made exactly four dozen cookies. Thanks original poster for a wonderful recipe! Next time I may add some nuts...

Great cookies!  I added a few sprinkles of cinnamon but otherwise followed the recipe.  I ended up having to put some of the dough in the fridge for a few days to bake later and they still came out very good.

This is a great recipe. I did add some of my own flair though. I added about a tablespoon of cinnamon (my husband LOVES cinnamon) and 4 teaspoons of coffee extract. It punched it up nicely!

My husband loves oatmeal cookies and these did not disappoint. I used all crasins because I did not have  raisins in the house, and added a bag of white chocolate chips.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  YUM!

I wanted to bake the cookies as is but once I got started I realized that my son, who now lives on his own, decided to do his grocery shopping in my cupboard.

For oatmeal I had to substitute 100% wholewheat bran, for raisins and cranberries I chopped up dried apricots and smashed almonds until I had the required amount.

It yielded the four dozen and baked at the temperature listed for the 20 minutes.

As I type this my professional taster has inhaled about a dozen (hubby).  I will save this receipe and make as is once I replenish my baking stock.  

Good recipe Liane.  Thank You

This is the best cookie recipe by far.  I have made these cookies over four times.  I did make a few changes - I used hazelnut flavoring, added another 1/2 cup of craisins.  Everyone loves these cookies

OMG these cookies are such a hit everywhere I take them.  Everyone always wants to recipe.  I can't seem to bake enough of them!  Like others I used all craisins and added a 3rd cup of oatmeal.  Delicious! I baked 3 dozen yesterday, but they are all gone, so I think I will bake some more tonight. :)

I followed reviewer suggestions and added extra cup of oatmeal, cup of nuts and tsp of cinnamon.  Used a cup of craisins, but next time will add the bag.  The resulting cookie spread flat, but crispy at the edges and chewy towards the center.   Excellent oatmeal flavor punctuated by the sweet craisins.  Will use this again.

The batter was way too dry; I had to add an extra egg. And I feel these cookies were under-seasoned. Where's the cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg? In the future I will just use my standard Joy of Cookie oatmeal raisin cookie recipe and replace with some raisins with craisins.

Everybody loves this cookie!! I add 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, omit the raisins and add 1 cup each of white chocolate chips and walnuts. This is a perfect base recipe for oatmeal cookies, just add whatever mix-ins you like!

I thought this recipe was delicious.  I took some ideas from others and added cinnamon and 1/2 cup of white chocolate chips.  I loved the cookies, but I think I will add 1 more cup of oats next time.  I like the cookies more "oaty".

By far the best cookie my family and I have ever eaten! I followed other recommendations and added another cup of oats (total of 3 cups), 3/4 cup of chopped nuts and soaked the craisins in orange juice. (I used only craisins.) that's what I love about Allrecipes, that recipes have been "tested" by others home cooks and I can consider their experiences when I make something new. I hope the next baker will do the same.

Delicious!  I used all craisins instead of adding raisins and threw in a cup or so of white chocolate chips.  Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful!  Mine seemed a little too crispy at 12 minutes, so I took them out just a wee bit sooner.  Also, I came up with about 6 1/2 dozen cookies altogether, each cookie about 2 1/2 - 3 inches after baking, so I got way more cookies than the four dozen that the recipe states.

These were really good cookies! I did a couple things different: Instead of raisins, I used only Craisins and a little more than a cup. I also added a package of white chocolate chips. Super good cookie!

These were really yummy and I only altered it slightly... I added a couple of healthy shakes of cinnamon and I ditched the raisins for chocolate chips (kept the crasins).  I made several sizes to try to figure out what worked best in our high altitude.  I found that silver-dollar sized balls for 9 minutes worked best, the perfect blend of soft and chewy.  Yum yum yum.  Thanks!

The texture was great and so was the body of the cookie. It was too sweet for my taste even with the craisins being tangy. Will decrease the sugar next time. Thank you for the recipe.

These are the best cookies ever! I added a teaspoon of cinnamon, white chocolate chips and I used cherry flavored craisins (the whole 6oz bag). These cookies blew me away! Way better than any oatmeal cookie I've ever had before!

This is a great oatmeal cookie!  I personally like an oatmeal cookie that is more oatmeal and less cookie and this recipe really produces a cookie that is less oatmeal and more cookie.  I used 1 cup golden raisin/dried cranberry/dried blueberry mix from Trader Joes, a half cup unsweetened coconut flakes, and a half cup chopped pecans.  My husband suggested more raisins next time.  This is a real crowd pleaser, they disappeared!!

I made these cookies with a slight alteration. I used orange flavoring instead of vanilla, reduced each of the sugars to a little less than 3/4 cup each and  substituted the craisins and raisins with 2 cups orange cranberry craisins. The end result was delicious. Not too sweet and a refreshing taste. These are worth a try.

This is one of my favorite recipes! Delicious and allows flexibility with add-ins! 
I grind the quick oats  in a spice grinder to make the batter a little easier to mix.

I put raisins and walnuts in half and choc chips and walnuts in the other half.  Used 1/2 C butter and 1/2 C margarine instead of all butter.  All turned out excellent.

These are first class cookies! I had crainsins this time & they were even better. I did add 1/2 tsp cinnamon because I like the taste in cookies. With the crainsins they were a bit dry. But still great!!

Awesome oatmeal cookie. I added 1tsp cinnamon and an extra cup of oatmeal. Only bake 12 minutes, crispy on the outside soft and chewy on the inside.

I made these today, as the recipe was written except used 2 cups of craisins (no raisins).  My husband raved about them and liked how chewy they were. They took a full 14 minutes to bake.  Excellent recipe.

Love the flavor and texture of these cookies. Just a little too sweet.    Next time, I'll reduce the sugar by 1/4 - 1/2 cup. May add some dark chocolate chips....

These were awesome!  I had to figure out my log in info just so I could rate them.  I used 1 cup of Craisins and 1 cup of walnuts because I didn't have any raisins on hand but I think you could use 2 cups of whatever you want in these.  They are nice and chewy in the middle and the perfect amount of sweetness.  I used a level 1 3/4" cookie scoop and  I baked them on parchment paper, and let them cool on the cookie sheet for a couple of minutes before moving them to a wire rack to cool completely.   I'm want to try walnuts and chocolate chips next time.....but I'm afraid they might be too good!

Delicious and easy to make. The only thing I would do differently is make only half the recipe because it made about three cookie sheets full. Too many cookies for the two of us. Maybe I will give some away...lol.

Wonderful recipe! Soft and delicious. I added about a teaspoon of cinnamon to the dry ingredients (just shook the cinnamon and mixed until it had a slight brown color and you could lightly smell the cinnamon) and added an extra half teaspoon of vanilla. I mixed the wet and dry ingredients with my hands. This is my new go to oatmeal cookies base!

I'll never make this recipe again because I could not stop eating these cookies!  I did use organic whole grain flour and used only raisins (2 cups).  Fantastic recipe!  Oh, my oatmeal was not the quick cooking type (wasn't sure if it made a differences).

As a Grammy, I've made cookies for my grandchildren for almost 30 years. I must say these are the tastiest oatmeal cookies I've ever made. I did a couple of things differently, based on previous reviews: I reduced white sugar to 1/2 cup, added chopped walnuts and chocolate chips. I included craisins but omitted raisins. Delicious!!

This is a great recipe.  I only did a couple of things different.  I added 1/4 cup shortening to the butter, I added an extra 1/2 cup oats (I like old fashioned oats for the texture) I added 2 tsps. of cinnamon for flavor as well as 1 tsp of Princess cake and cookie emulsion flavoring.  Last, but not least, I added 2 tablespoons of cornstarch to the flour.  If you've ever wondered what that indescribable flavor is in the cookies you get from the bakery, it's princess cake and cookie emulsion.  Give it a try sometime and give your baked goods that extra special flavor.  As for the cornstarch addition, it just helps to keep the cookies soft and yummy.

I mixed butter n sugar then found out I was out of oats. So I put cereal instead. It was so good. 
After I made about a dozen medium sized cookies, the leftover batter, I added some milk, orange zest and the juice of half orange and turned it into an awesome cake. The cake was so fluffy with great taste and smell really good too! It just made my day!

These are my husbands favorite oatmeal cookies!  I followed others suggestion and added 1 cup oats, ditched the raisins in favor of two cups craisins, and added 1 cup white chocolate chips. These cookies are so quick easy, and delish!  I have to scoop and freeze half the dough or they'd all be eaten within a day.

This is a great recipe, especially for using quick oats. The only thing I changed was what some other people also did, which was bump up the oats to 3 cups. I did one cup dried cranberries and one cup chocolate chips. Recipe seems like a nice base to change up every now and then. Very yummy!

Good.  I liked them better after they had time to set and the flavors meld.  I added cinnamon as another reviewer recommended.

Excellent cookies, though my husband made me promise never to put craisins in a cookie again. Next time I will use chocolate chips. The base cookie recipe is fantastic. Thanks.

I made these gluten free, I just substituted the all-purpose flour for a gf all-purpose flour and only had dried cranberries. It was so delicious, this is  a wonderful recipe.

Best. Cookie. Ever.  So easy and SOOOO good! The first time I made them, I used 2 cups of crasins instead of 1c. raisins and 1 c. cranberries because that's all I had.  I've been making them this way for over a year now and haven't even tried it with the rasins because the crasins are so good by themselves!  They have become the stuff of legend at work!

These cookies were outstanding! Made them because my boyfriend love craisins. I read some of the other reviews and I agree with adding an extra cup of quick outs (3 cups total) and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon. I also chopped the craisins into smaller pieces which mixed better with the batter. Added the sweetness of white chocolate chips too. Between my roommates and boyfriend the cookies were gone by the next morning!

Yummy! We used half whole wheat flour, added 1/2 cup rolled oats, some cinammon, and some pecans.  A nice chance from chocolate chip cookies- and we didn't miss the chocolate!

the best cookie ever.  delightfully chewy. Just a little crispy on the outside.  I get requests to bring them to children's events and seniors events.  One friend thought she already had the receipe but found out it didn't compare at all.   It is now my go-to cookie receipe

One of my most favorite cookies ever. I'll usually use all cranberries, subtract a half cup of them and add a half cup of pecans. Everyone always asks for the recipe.

This is a yummy and easy recipe.  I like to add almond slivers and chopped pecans to the recipe.  Cinnamon also enhances the flavor.  I occasionally substitute chocolate covered craisins for the craisins.  The recipe is also just as good without the raisins (double the craisins though).

I added this cookie to my extensive Christmas Cookie tray and the results were outstanding! This is THE best new cookie I've tried in a very long time. Only changes I made were to add 1 cup of white chocolate chips and 1 cup of chopped walnuts!  I gave these to fellow teachers the last day of school and before I even left that day I had 2 requests for the recipe. This is a keeper for sure! Thanks for sharing!

I've been looking for a really good oatmeal cookie since my sis sent me some bakery gourmet ones last Christmas.  With a little tweaking this is it.  I swapped out the raisins for walnuts and added a teaspoon of ground mulling spices, also used old fashioned oats instead of quick.  Yummo.  My Christmas baked good gift this year.

Very good. I made the mistake of adding the cranberries into the dry mixture so they would be easier to stir, as one reviewer suggested, but that just meant that the dry mixture stuck to the cranberries and didn't mix with the wet stuff as well. (I should have known better.) Probably as a result of that, the cookies seemed to "flatten out" more than I expect in a good cookie, but everyone else that ate them LOVED them.

This is my new oatmeal craisin cookie recipe!  We have long ago decided that oatmeal cookies are best with the extra zing of craisins instead of regular raisins so I just left out the raisins and doubled the craisins (which I plumped) and added a couple handfuls of chopped pecans and a dash of extra vanilla.  Such a great cookie.  Moist, chewy and delicious!  I doubled the recipe and other than my minor changes, I followed it exactly and the cookies turned out perfectly.  They're almost gone already!

This recipe was excellent! I took the whole batch to a small party and they were gone in literally 17 minutes. The changes I made: I didn't use raisins, I just added more craisins. I chopped up a handful of walnuts and threw those in. A previous reviewer suggested adding a little cinnamon, and I added a little over half a teaspoon.

Great recipe :) Chewy and soft. I added ~1/2c. walnuts, and 1tsp. cinnamon powder. Made all the difference! Using white chocolate chips would be perfect too. The only recipe tweak I would make is to use 3/4c. white sugar instead of 1c. I thought the cookies were a little on the sweet side, but overall, very yummy.

I followed the recipie and was very happy with the outcome. The cookies are chewy, tasty, very easy to make and I actually had all of the ingredients. I used the convection oven but noticed the cookies baked on the pampered chef brick were flatter than the cookies baked on the airbake cookie sheets. I liked the airbake cookies appearance better. Thanks for the recipie!

I am NOT a baker and not a big fan of sweets, but this was good.  I added 1 bag of white chocolate chips and some chopped pecans, soaked my crasins in OJ first and omitted the raisins. Pretty darn good!

Took only 11 minutes to bake, 12-14 minutes resulted in extremely crispy cookies. Overall, these are fine if you like crispy, thin cookies, not the right recipe if you like me seek big, chewy oatmeal cookies.

Good recipe, really pleased with the result. I read a couple of other reveiws, so added a bit of cinnamon, and a few extra oats (20g). I also used a few more cranberries and few less raisins. I reduced the sugar, in fact I only used half the white sugar, and they were still sweet to me, just right in fact! I also got loads more cookies than 24, but then maybe I make them small!! Thanks for the recipe, I will make them again, really good texture!

These cookies are SO GOOD... They are gone in no time unless I hide them. I skip adding in the raisins and just add more craisins and chopped walnuts. I use regular oatmeal for an extra chewy cookie. Cook longer for a crisper cookie. I baked 12 doz. of these for our grown kids at Christmas and they beg me to make them every year!! This recipe is a real keeper!!!

At first I was given a hard time for making them instead of something more traditional at my friends' cookie bake get-together.  They ended up being the favorite of all the cookies!  What a wonderful recipe.

I added white chocolate chips and it was amazing. They do spread a little so make sure you space them out. Otherwise they are amazing. My roommates ate them all in one day.

I love this recipe!  I usually don't like oatmeal cookies of any kind, but I tried this one for my friends who don't like chocolate.  Some reviewers mentioned it being too sweet so I left out the white chocolate chips and raisins (I just added more craisins).  The butter definitely has way more taste than margarine - I wouldn't try this recipe unless you have butter.  The texture (baking at 12 minutes) is crispy and chewy.  This is THE oatmeal cookie recipe!

This is a great oatmeal cookie, not too sweet.  I didn't have raisins on hand so I doubled up on the cranberries.  The cookies turned out very good.

Thank You, Liane for posting this recipe.
Everyone in the family liked these cookies.  They were crisp, and yet very chewy.  Used all raisins instead of mixing them with craisins because I wasn't sure the grandchildren would like the mix.  I did keep the dough in the refrigerator covered with a wet paper towel ( to prevent drying out) inbetween baking the batches.  Because they don't spread while baking, I flattened them slightly with a fork.  These cookies are a keeper and will bake these again.

These were really nice.  I followed other recommendations about reducing the sugars and increasing the oats and they turned out very well.  Next time I might try them with different dried fruits just for a change.

This recipe is great as it is.  It also is a great basic base recipe to use for different kind of cookies - chocolate chip, white chocolate chip, raisins, other dried fruits.  I really liked the amount of oatmeal used - thought it was perfect.  I added some walnuts.  Mine had crispy edges and soft centers.  My 15-month-old daughter LOVED them.

I used less sugar than the recipe called for (3/4 c. white sugar, 3/4 c. brown sugar) and I found them to be sweet enough.  I might think about making them with Crisco next time so they don't flatten out as much.

This is it--the oatmeal raisin cookie recipe I've been looking for for 35 yrs! Perfect taste, texture, and appearance.  So delicious you'll groan! I added 1 tsp. cinnamon and 6 oz. cut-up white chocolate...dreamy!  Thank you, Liane, and thank you reviewers for leading me here!

If you are looking for a great recipe using craisins, I suggest the one on the back of the Oceanspray Craisin package. It's an oatmeal craisin cookie with with chocolate chunks. Every time I make it, people rave about it! Rather than use white chocolate chips, I buy a ghiardelli white chocolate bar and break it into chunks. I also sometimes add macadamia nuts.

I liked them a lot! They disappeared in 3 days. I actually changed the raisins to craisins because I love craisins.  I found that I had to bake them a bit longer too.

Delicious cookie! I only had 1/2 cup of brown sugar on hand, so I used a total of 1.5 cups of granulated sugar. I also only used cranberries and my family could not stop eating them! Will be making again soon.

Oh my! This is my favorite recipe. Thank you for posting. It’s better than sex. I thought my husband was gonna die when he bit into one. He said it tasted like Otis Spunkmyer, but better.  Actually I spilled the butter and had to guess how much to add. But again thank you! Love this recipe and the cookies. My pants may not, but my taste buds...yum!!!! Good thing it’s Christmas! Merry Christmas to all!!!

All craisins plus white chocolate chips.  It's heavy on the butter in the recipe, and evident in the taste of the end product.  Really love this recipe!!!

Great Recipe. Made these Gluten free using cup for cup flower and Bobs Redmill GF oats.I took other reviewers suggestions and added an additional cup of oats, 1.5 tsp cinnamon, used 2 cups craisins and no raisins. I used an icecream scoop  as we like large cookies, recipe yields 24 cookies. Bake for 15-17 mins. I freeze most of the uncooked cookies on a cookie tray and then put into freezer bag so we can have fresh cookies any time.

Delicious recipe! I made the following changes: based on other reviews I added 1 cup oats (used thick cut rolled oats rather than quick oats) and 1 teaspoon cinnamon. It was a little dry with the extra oats, so I also added appox 1/4 cup avocado oil. In addition, I substituted half the white flour for whole wheat and reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup each (in the future I would reduce it further). I also omitted the raisins and added 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips. The kids and their friends loved them! This recipe made almost 6 dozen cookies!

Yum! It's been over 10 years since I baked cookies from scratch. This recipe was easy to follow. I did modify the recipe by using rolled oat (not quick), 1 cup of white and 1 cup of wheat flour, no raisins but 2 cups of craisins. I think it would have been even more delicious with white chocolate chips if I had some in my kitchen. Great recipe!

I can’t say enough good things about this cookie recipe. I’ll bake 3 dozen & they’re gone in 2-3 days. I hate when people leave great reviews but then basically note how they changed just about everything in the recipe. I used craisins & white chocolate chips, because it what I had in my panty. This cookie recipe is so yummy, you could use just about anything you’d like. I also added a little more oatmeal and a little less flour the 2nd time I made them because I was running low on flour & they came out a littler chewier which we loved!

These were excellent. I didn't have raisins, so used two cups of craisins  and I didn't have quick oats so used old fashioned oats. They turned out great!

This is one of the best oatmeal cookies I’ve ever made! I tweaked the recipe a little bit though! I added 2 teaspoons of cinnamon. I also used old fashion oats instead of what the recipe called for. I’ve noticed that the old fashion oats don’t soak up as much of the moisture. I also only added cranberries Instead of raisins.And a cup of chocolate chips. They are so soft and honestly the perfect cookie!

Very good, not too sweet and I used all craisins. I love sweet stuff but these were just right, I could eat a couple and it wasn't too much. Baked up very nicely, a little brown on the edges and they were perfect.

Absolutely delicious! I used golden raisins instead of the regular raisins. Almost skipped the five mins of mixing, glad I followed recipe the mixing created a delicate chewy texture.

Simple to make, results are excellent. I am not much of a baker. This was my first foray into cookie making.

The first time I made 5 dozen or so cookies, if memory serves. I froze half or more of them, and they were just as good defrosted.

Making this for the second time today. Both times doubling the recipe. The first time, I reduced the white sugar by almost half, this time even less, about 3/4 Cup white to 2 cups dark brown for the doubled recipe.

Amazing Cookies. I followed some of the suggestions - using 3 cups oats (1/2 regular & 1/2 quick cooking), 1 tsp. cinnamon and substituting the raisins for white chocolate chips. Made 5 dozen fantastic cookies.  I will be making these often.

Baked two trays at same time heavy aluminum with parchment, this required additional cooking time of 8-10 minutes in 2 minute increments. One smaller tray cooked alone took the recipe time and was a nice golden brown, also those cookies puffed higher.  the slower cooking ones were a bit flatter.

Delicious! I used half butter and half Crisco. These are great as is, and I think next time I may add some nuts and dark chocolate chunks to make them even more indulgent. My only tip would be to use the insulated cookie sheets and remove them from the oven just a little bit before they look done. This results in a nice chewy cookie that isn’t too crispy.

Not a raisin fan so I substituted chopped dates for the raisins and still turned out great. Family loved them!

Last time I made oatmeal cookies they spread all over the cookie sheet...this recipe didn't and they turned out yummy and chewy with no changes except I used regular raisins instead of dried cranberries. I will make these again!

My families favorite.  They ask for them every year after I first made them.  I left the raisins out the second time (did not have any) and just did half again as many craisins and they were just as good.  My husband prefers them that way.  I use the 50% reduced sugar craisins.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.   I see some people adding more oats and I am curious how they are that way, but have not yet dared try it because we love them so much with the recipe proportions.

This has become my best oatmeal cookie recipe. I did use only a few raisins and more craisins - probably less than 1 1/3 cup total since I added 1 cup chopped pecans.. I did use parchment paper rather than greasing the pan. This is my "go to" recipe now. Moist and chewy, good flavor.

These turned out fantastic! They turned into more of  a kitchen sink cookie since I added 1 cup each of chocolate chips, walnuts and craisins as well as 1tsp pumpkin pie spice.    I would certainly make them again!

These cookies were so good! But I reduced the sugar so they weren't too sweet. Tip: the cookies came out a little dry, so you might want to bake it for 10 or 11 min. instead.

Used suggestions to increase oatmeal by 1 cup (only had instant steel cut oats, which add a nutty feel), add 2 teaspoons of cinnamon and cut out raisins, just used 2 cups craisins.  So good!

This is the perfect oatmeal  cookie, I just did the raisins I didn't have  cranberries, but this recipe is easy and so good. I had to make a second batch because the first one didn't make it throughout the day.  You could either use both raisins and cranberries  or  one or the other , either way this is the best oatmeal cookie I ever had.

Delicious and chewy, not over sweet, but a bit tart. Yes, use the two sugars and mix for 5 minutes or so. Don’t use margarine, DO soak your raisins and cranberries in warm water for 15 minutes (they plump like magic!).  I added 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp of ginger. These cookies disappeared too fast!

Really perfect as far as texture goes, crisp on the edges and chewy in the middle.  I needed to clean out  my baking cupboard so I used 3/4c dried cranberries, 1/4 c dried cherries with 1/2 cup each dark chocolate and white chocolate chips and left out the raisins.

Awesome recipe! Someone mentioned that she added a cup of oatmeal and cinnamon- I did that and it’s simply the best oatmeal cookies ever. However, I would bake it at 375 for 12 mins.

This is just the most delish cookie ever!  I followed the recipe exactly. I added 1cup pecan halves, coarsely chopped along with the cranberries. The key to success, in my opinion, is that I creamed the butter and sugars for over five minutes before adding other ingredients!  Yummers!!

Yummy! Next time I will cut the recipe in half because they made so many cookies, and it was hard to resist them! Also I think I'll follow others advice next time and add some cinnamon, it would give them a nice flavour.

My family begs for these cookies again and again.  The only thing I changed was 2 cups of cranberries.  Also if you use a convection oven reduce the baking time to 8 or 9 minutes.

The best cookies I have ever had! I know that some people don't like it when you change a recipe and then comment on it, but that is what I am doing. Because the bones of this cookie recipe is what is so unique and delicious. It is light and crispy, which I LOVE in a cookie. Adding and subtracting a few ingredients is what is so great. You could make the recipe just like it is and it would be wonderful, I am sure. However, I added some white chocolate chips and some pecans.  I did  not use any raisins, just more cranberries. I can not keep these in the house......they are way too tempting.

I used Crisco instead of butter and it turned out just fine. Cookies were moist and soft. I would give it five stars but it didn't taste very sweet.

Best oatmeal cookies I've made to date!  I added mixed dried fruit instead of just raisins and craisins.

Stop searching ! Make this cookie. It looks like you can follow the recipe exactly or make a few changes and it still comes out tasty. I only had old fashioned oats. I added chocolate chips and a few shakes from the all spice. I did not have exactly a cup of raisins or cranberrys so I made up for it in chocolate. I can't stop eating them.

Didn’t change a thing, made this twice and my family loves it, making us again today. Give it a try, easy and yummy. Mixed all dry ingredients together before adding to the butter sugar mixture. The 2nd time I made this I added semi sweet chocolate chips and it was fantastic. Gonna make half batch with chopped walnuts today . This is so versatile. Try it , you won’t regret.  Thanks for sharing this recipe

The mix was so dry I couldn't mix it. So I put in a splash of milk. It may have been an error! I put 12 gobs on the cookie tray, and when the heat hit it, I had ONE cookie. LOL  totally flattened.
   Tasted good though.

I followed this recipe step by step, but unfortunately, I was not able to make exactly as the recipe. I was out of raisins. In place of the raisins, I added 1 cup of shredded coconut, and 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips. 

The cookies baked up nice and thick. I used a small ice cream scoop to scoop out equal size portions, and formed balls. Due to altitude, my baking time is a bit longer at 15 minutes. 

As with most cookie recipes I bake, I chilled the dough for an hour after mixing, and I used parchment paper on the cookie sheets. 

I look forward to making this recipe over and over again, actually using raisins, and trying with varying additions such as; walnuts, roasted pecans, etc.

If you are going to use substitutions to this recipe, such as margarine instead of butter, or not even try to follow the recipe, please do not post a negative review. 

My son loved this batch.

This is my family’s favorite cookie recipe! They get gobbled up at lightning speed! I make a few minor adjustments for my own preference. I used 3 cups of oats instead of 2. I add some cinnamon to the dry ingredients and double the vanilla. We like more of the craisins than the raisins in our cookies!!! I often double the recipe and freeze them! This recipe is definitely a keeper!!!

They turned out good and tasty. I added cinnamon like others recommended. I also doubled the craisin and didn't add raisins plus I added chocolate chips and pecans just because I had them on hand.

Yummy!!  I used shortening instead of butter; 3 cups of oats; and 2 tbs of milk.  They turned out nice and soft - my husband loved them because he could eat them without his dentures in even with the raisins and craisins :-)  I will definitely make them again and I will try them with butter next time.

Made a little mistake, mixed it all together and thought  I was done and realized that I forget the flour, so I added it last.
They turned out alright, maybe would of turned out better if I did the mixing in the proper order.

I made these for a 95 year old gentleman my husband visits weekly for an afternoon of errands and conversation.  He absolutely loves oatmeal cookies with any kind of fruit because the fruit makes them softer and chewier and gives them a sweetness he likes......he gave these an A-one rating!

Loved them!  A neighbor came over just as the last batch came out of the oven and a whole lot disappeared just like that.  I did substitute whole oats for the instant and the cookies turned out just fine.

Too tasty!  I love oatmeal raisin cookies and when you add craisins... they are even better... plus I put the jumbo organic raisins in mine!  So cheery and deliscious!  Make sure your jaw is working for a chewing pleasure

Pretty easy to make and everyone I gave some to loved it. I would make them again. Didn't make any changes as I always like to make things according to recipe and then if I have any ideas I would do them next time.
The only possible changes I would make would be a little less cooking time but that would depend on the size of the cookie. I like them chewy but either way tastes delicious

I made these cookies using all Craisins, and a little more vanilla.  They came out great.  I have a few in the freezer to see how they come out.

These are outstanding. I always bake my cookies longer than indicated by the recipe for extra doneness and crunch. 
Next time I will add chocolate chips and nuts.

We love these cookies, but I did make a couple of changes. I used Crisco instead of butter, used a cup of lower sugar Craisins, 3/4 cup of chopped pecans and no raisins. 
I live at 9,000 feet so I also adjusted for altitude. I only used 3/4 cup of white sugar and brown sugar. I used 2 1/4 cups of flour and oatmeal and added 2 T. of water. I also had to cook them a little longer, at least 16 minutes. They turned out perfectly, nice and thick and chewy!

Awesome cookies. Coworkers pretend they hate me for bringing them to work but it's not my fault if they eat too many. Try cinnamon and nutmeg for a nice change. As others have stated, I use old fashion oats and cookies come out great

I made these as directed, and batter was way to thin, so I added an additional cup of oats, then refrigerated the dough for an hour to help the oats absorb the liquid.  Using a small scoop (tablespoon size) I put them on the air bake cookie sheet and cooked 12 min.  The came out chewy/crispy.  They were ok, but didn't have the flavor I was looking for. I cooked one batch and have frozen the rest until I think of what to do to give them more flavor.

I made these with some of the suggested additions from another review and they turned out great. I used one stick of salted and one stick of unsalted butter. Three cups of oats instead of two (about half/half quick and old fashioned) a dash of cinnamon and approximately half a bag of white chocolate chips. I baked them on parchment covered baking sheets and with these additions the recipe yielded almost 6.5 dozen cookies.

I have made it twice WITHOUT the cup of white sugar. With the natural sugar in craisins and raisins, 1 cup of brown sugar was more than enough for this quick and yummy recipe. Using less sugar doesn't sacrifice taste at all, and the lower calorie count means less guilt!

My new go-to oatmeal cookie recipe.  I followed earlier reviews and added about 1 c. extra oats.  The only other thing I did was soak the raisins and craisins in 2 c. boiling water for about 5 minutes.  Drained well and added to the batter.  I also added 1 t. cinnamon to my dry ingredients.  Absolutely perfect.  I changed the recipe a little but it still gets 5 stars because it is great as is, just better with plumped up fruit and a little cinnamon!

Absolutely delicious!!! These cookies are flat and chewy and a little crispy on the edges like a real cookie should be. I only used one cup of brown sugar, substituted half cup of honey for the white sugar, baked for 15 minutes and.... Presto!!! Worlds best cookie!!! For a another delicious variation, swap white chocolate chips for the raisins and craisins and add one cup of walnuts.... slap your grammaw good!!!

Oh my, these are fabulous!  I replaced the raisins with white chocolate chips since that's what I had in the pantry, and I added 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice since it's cold here right now and in the winter I like spice.  14 Min was a perfect bake, crispy on the edges, chewy in the middle.
Will certainly make these again.

I don't succeed at cookie making often. These are Skookumchuck. This is a versatile recipe. Only had 1 c. craisins, used orange-zest soaked raisins to fill the gap. Nummy nummy. My "lab rat" neighbors are going to enjoy these.

Great recipe. I used 2 cups old fashion oates  because I didn't have quick oats.  Cookies turned out chewy inside and lightly crispy outside. PERFECT!!!!

These cookies are absolutely amazing! They are chewy on the inside and crunchy on the outside. They did end up taking about 20 minuets to cook, but besides that the recipe is perfect.

Excellent! I  made a half batch and swapped 1/4 cup maple syrup for 1/4 cup brown sugar and used half kaput flour and half AP flour. Otherwise follow the recipe and enjoy.

I used this recipe to make raisin-oatmeal cookies, so I just subbed out the cranberries with raisins. Didn't have nuts, but I'm sure they would have been great. 

The mis was very soft and sticky,named I was slightly worried it wouldn't come out right, but it was great. Mine cooked for 15 mins first batch and then 15 the next, but the second batch overlooked, so I will cut the time for second batch next time! 

Fantastic, big, flat, chewy, crispy-at-the-edges cookies!

Perfect recipe for oatmeal cookies!  Great texture and the recipe is easily modified to include nuts, chocolate chips, cinnamon or whatever you want.  I used my large cookie scoop (without packing it too tightly) and the recipe made 5 dozen.

You must have this easy recipe in your repertoire. It is excellent as written with butter. Even better with coconut oil in lieu of butter.  Or try half butter and half coconut oil. Avoid margarine if possible. Cream the sugars, fats, and eggs very well, at least 3-4 minutes. Be careful to not over bake, check at 10 mins and remove when outside edges turn brown.

These cookies are excellent.  I followed the recipe to a T the first time, and they were great.  A friend suggested that it would be even better with coconut and pecans.  So, the next batch got 1 cup each of coconut and chopped pecans, and I decreased the flour by 1/4 cup.  These were so great that the 4 dozen disappeared in 3 days.  Give it a try...you might just love it!

These cookies are perfection! They have just the right amount of crispness  while being  moist and hardy. Delicious. 
I am at a slightly higher altitude  so I put an extra 1/4 cup flour in.  This will be my go to cookie recipe! Love , love, love!

This recipe is DELICIOUS!!! It was extremely easy to make. All I added was an extra cup of oats and some cinnamon and they turned out great. My sister can't stop eating them and keeps asking me to make some more and my neighbor said she LOVED them! I will definitely be making these again!

Perfect cookies! I had to reduce sugar because my husband is a diabetic. Used 1/2 c sugar and 1/2 c of stevia, and only 1/2 c brown sugar. They were delicious.

I've made these a couple times and they turn out great.  I've changed the recipe a little.  I use wheat flour instead of white,  add cinnamon, a cup of walnuts and use only one cup of craisins.  They are gone in a day!

Noni, instead of dried fruit I used caramel chips.  They are very good and I think it made them a little thinner and some were the size of a saucer!  Oh, well size doesn't matter ??

I made one little change. Instead of raisins, I used 1 cup of chopped pecans. These cookies are fabulous!  They have a hint of tartness, a little sweet,  and nutty. Quite possibly the best cookies!

Yummy. I followed the recipe except for adding the raisins ( we didn't have any). They turned out really well. I like that they don't spread out really thin. I'll be using this recipe again.

This is a thinner cookie than some others I've tried, but they hold their shape well, not crumbly or too crunchy.  Good flavor but too sweet for my taste,  even though I cut the sugar by a couple tablespoons.   I added pecans instead of the raisins and used traditional oats but otherwise the same.   I think they have a small over salted taste due to the amount of baking powder and baking soda in the recipe- I will cut the soda in half next time,  it seems that may be the salty culprit since there isn't any acid for it to react with and mellow out.   I will cut a bit more sugar out, too.  The tang of the cranberries along with the nuts made it a delicious cookie, though, and I will make it again with a tweak to my taste.  Thanks!
Update- i think my over salted feeling was because i used salted butter, which put the salt over a bit,  next time I will use unsalted.  These hold their shape and don't get crumbly, or too hard - it took a few days for these to disappear but they all had a good texture and moisture and chew to the end.  I made them again with less sugar and they were great again!   I added pecans instead of the cup of raisins.   perfect.

Best oatmeal cookie recipe ever! I added walnuts instead of  raisins. They only had to bake for eight minutes at 375 to give a nice soft center and retain a delicately crispy edge. These cookies are gold!

Easy. Makes lots of cookies. ABSOLUTELY delicious! I actually added 2 tsp of cinnamon because I like it in my oatmeal raisin cookies. I also substituted the craisins for regular raisins because I didn't have any craisins. they still turned out PERFECT!

I used a forgotten, open box of muesli cereal (~2 cups), 1 packet of maple instant oatmeal, 1 packet of regular instant oatmeal, 1 cup of very old raisins, (no craisins available),  and a cup of white chocolate chips for good, sweet measure. 

This recipe is a perfect basic for the leftover-franken-cookies I made, which turned out surprisingly delicious.
The recipe produces crunchy, buttery, sweet, golden cookies.

I substituted white chocolate chips for the raisins, but followed the rest of the recipe with no changes. The craisin / white chocolate combo was great, and my husband LOVED them!  I will defiantly make these again.  The only thing I will do differently is cut the baking time down to 10-11 minutes so the cookies are crispy on the edges and chewy in the center.  12-13 minutes baked the cookie crispy....not burnt at all,  just crispier then what I wanted.  AWESOME  &  DELISH !!

I normally don't leave a review if I've made several changes but these were so good that I will anyway. I was short 1/2 cup of oats so I added the equivalent amount of flour. I was also short 1/2 cup of cranberries so I added 1/2 cup pecans.  I also added a splash more vanilla, accidentally.  Your recipe is simply amazing. So crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, just the way a good cookie should be. Thanks so much for sharing.

Being diabetic I used trivia baking blend and splenda brown sugar blend.  I soaked the craisins in apple cider.  This came out perfect.

Great cookies!! I made these last year. I left out raisins and used only craisins. The kicker is this, I add the zest of one medium orange to each batch.  Delicious!! Co workers and family could not get enough

These were easy and tasted great, but I made so many changes that I can't claim to have followed the recipe. Most cookies are too sweet for me, so I used the amount of brown sugar indicated but skipped white sugar entirely. Since my eggs were large, I used half the amount of baking soda and baking powder so the cookies wouldn't rise too much and go all cake-like and poufy. Finally, regular oats (not quick-cooking), whole wheat flour, and chopped walnuts along with the cranberries and raisins. I've had trouble with poor distribution of nuts and dried fruit in thick dough, so I add them between the first and second parts of dry ingredients. My version of the cookies didn't spread at all, so I squashed them with a spatula halfway through baking. My oven runs hot and doesn't adjust below 180º C, but nonetheless they needed almost 20 minutes' baking time. Nice and crisp on the outside, perfectly chewy inside.

They turned out great.  I like a little bit of cinnamon and nutmeg in my oatmeal cookies so I added a teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg.  Next time I will add a bit more of each.  I love the crunchy texture of the cookies!  I will use this as my base recipe in the future and just vary the "add-ins" like nuts, white chocolate morsels, etc.

This is the perfect recipe for oatmeal craisin cookies! We needed gluten free cookies, so I just substituted gluten free flour, and instead of a cup of raisins and a cup of craisins, I just used two cups of craisins. Turned out great! Thanks!

Easy, yummy, love them! I used 1/2 c shortening and 1/2 c butter, and added 1/2 c chopped walnuts. These are a great alternative to cinnamon-flavored oatmeal raisin cookies.

Wonderful recipe! Perfect texture, chewy and crispy! I only used Craisins and added a cup of white chocolate chips. Recipe yields 24 cookies but it actually made 40 good sized cookies. Planning to add nuts next time.

The mix was a little dry for my taste so I added half a can (approx. 15 oz) of pumpkin puree, changed white sugar to 3/4 cup instead of 1 cup, added 1/2tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of ground cloves. They turned out SO yummy that the kiddos begged me to make more! This is definitely one of our favorite cookie recipes.

Perfect oatmeal cookie recipe. :) It's chewy in the middle and crispy in the outside, and without out shortening. I think the secret is in proper creaming. I subbed the craisins for chocolate chips, and it's a hit in my home. Thank you!

Great recipe. We're trying to control cholesterol in our diet so substituted 3/4 cup canola oil for the butter. Cookies tastes great and disappeared just as quickly as previous made with butter!

Love them!  I didn't have dried cranberries so exchanged the raisins and cranberries for 1 cup of craisins, 1 cup of almonds and then threw in some white chocolate chips.  Baked for 13 minutes and they were awesome!!!!

I have made these 5 times now in the last 8 months. I also put walnuts in them along with apple pie spice and cinnamon. A wonderful breakfast cookie when on the run!

I love the recipe, however I think it was a tad bit too sweet. Next time I try it I will have to cut down on the sugar (Also did not use white sugar) and see how I like it better. I left it in the oven for about 17 minutes because I don't care for the chewy cookie. This was great, because I really enjoy making my own sweet snacks from scratch rather than being store bought. Great recipe :-)

This is the best cookie recipe I have found anywhere.  I made them exactly by the recipe directions and they are fantastic.  I baked them at 350 for 14 minutes and cooled them 3 minutes before removing to cooling rack.  They hold together very well, are moist and chewy with just a little edge of crisp.  Thanks so much for contributing this recipe!

These were phenomenal. I followed suggestions to add 1 cup of oats and 1 tsp of cinnamon. I used old fashioned oats. Otherwise, I followed instructions exactly. They came out super great. I'll definitely be making them again.

Very good and chewy; I added a handful of chopped walnuts I had on hand... per other suggestions I cut back on the sugar a half cup; still plenty sweet.  I'll cut out another half cup next time I make them... definitely making them again...

I didn't put any craisins in, an I added 1 1/2 tsp of Cinnamon, and they were fantastic. Everyone enjoyed them. I took a double batch to church, and not even one came home. Delicious!

Just tried this recipe for the first time tonite,, and might I say AWESOME !! They turned out perfect. Just a light crispy texture outside and light n tender inside,, just absolutely wonderful. My hubby just came home from work as he walked in the door and could smell them,, then proceeded to hunt for them,, and was absolutely in love with them,, so packing some up in his lunch tomorrow. :)
Now with that said, I will fill u in on what I did. I must also thank some who commented about adding another cup of oatmeal, which I did. I sub the butter with applesauce, reduced white sugar to 3/4 c. just because. And that is all I did that was different than the recipe asked. I followed directions as listed. I added 1 cup raisins, and 1 cup semi sweet chocolate chips, because we like them. The batter turned out perfect for a drop-type cookies. I made large cookies, and baked for 15 minutes. Although mine do not look like the pic on here, they were much larger and little darker, but that would be a personal preference. Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe, and a keeper at that !!

I've read the reviews and added a little bit and that from the comments; cinnamon, pumpkin spice and almonds.  Cookies turned out great, except maybe cut some salt out just a tab being I normally don't eat salt with my meals so it seemed a tad salty to me.  And if I could find a way to cut some of that sugar out...but that's my preference(s).  My kids loved them even with some of the healthy stuff in them!  Great cookies for any occasion (mine happens to be icy cold winter day).

Holy cow, there's nothing like this recipe, not even close!! Sooooo yummy.  Added the changes with 3 cups oats (regular).  Also used 1/2c each craisins and raisins, put in separate glass bowl and soaked with the beaten egg and vanilla mixture, let 'plump' for an hour before mixing in.

Complete masterpiece, thank you!

Loved it!!!  They tasted amazing.  I didn't have Quick cooking oats, so I used regular Oats.  And I also didn't have raisins so I added a cup of chocolate chips instead.  Everything else I did the same.  Delicious!!

These are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever made. The only drawback is my inability to eating stop them. The Grandkids loved them. 
I kept the baking time to 12 mins. to keep them softer.

So I tried this for the first time. I didn't have enough raisins so I added dried mixed berries. My four year old son said "D-delicious!" So this was a hit with the family. I will be making this for church functions!!!! Awesome!!!!

I made this with all craisins as I have a Costco bag that I want to use up. I did make another change to the recipe, which was using only about half the sugar called for. I ended up with less than a cup of brown sugar and added a little more white sugar to total maybe 1 1/4 total of sugars. The cookies were still plenty sweet! I did feel like maybe the baking soda could have been reduced as well as there was a very mild, barely noticeable aftertaste. Altogether I will use this recipe again with the above mentioned alterations and try less baking soda next time.

Have made this recipe numerous times, and it comes out wonderfully every time. We vary it depending on what we want...margarine makes a flatter, chewier, moister cookie...slightly more crumbly, but seems tastier to us. Butter makes a fluffier cookie, but seems a bit flat in the taste department. This is an ideal recipe to build on, however. We've substituted the raisins and craisins with butterscotch chips and pecans, and it's still wonderful. This is a dream recipe for adaptations. My husband loves it because it refrigerates well. We bake a dozen at a time, which gives a nice treat, plus nibbles for him the next day or two, and lets us have access to fresh cookies when we want them. (Also keeps *someone* from snacking his way through a whole batch lol).

These are fabulously amazing cookies! I made a few changes. i only used white sugar and didn't put as much in as it called for. and used walnuts and chocolate chips and used crisco in place of butter only because I was out of butter.

I've never been much of a cookie baker; cakes yes, not cookies. But I tried this recipe, and now I'M FAMOUS! These cookies are the bomb! I used Ghiardelli chocolate chips and everything else just like the recipe, and they turned out perfect!  Thanks, Liane! This is a terrific cookie!

OMG ---good!!!!  Different twist on regular oatmeal.  Used dried orange cranberries and yummmmmmm - the little tang of orange - made these a real gourmet treat!  This recipe will be a regular!  So easy to make too!   Used a product made by NutraFruit - called Orange Cranberry Sweetened and Dried!

Delicious! I used regular oats. As a personal preference, no raisins but added white and chocolate chips and pecans, along with the Craisins.

This recipe is amazing! I followed the recipe except added 1/4 tsp cinnamon and subbed a few tbsp of flour for whole wheat flour, added some poppy seeds and pumpkin seeds to add more color. Rolled them into balls and flattened them ever so slightly on an ungreased no-stick cookie sheet and they came out at 14 minutes soft, hardening as they cooled off. I only made minor changes so the recipe itself is quite wonderful but it's also one you can play around with. The batch is still warm and half of the cookies are already gone. Will definitely make these again.

Loved this recipe! I suck at making cookies. But I had a huge bag of craisins so I figured I'd try again!  And success. The recipe was easy to follow! 
Like some of the other reviewers, I ommited raisins, and tossed in a cup of chopped pecans. Cookies were soft and delectable :) perfect for the Christmas season !! thanks.

We aren't big fans of cake like cookies and these were perfectly crunchy. I used 1/2 marg. and 1/2 butter. also I was out of baking soda, so I tripled the baking powder and was very generous with the salt measurement. I used butter flavored pam and they are light and flavorful.  Note must be removed from pan immediately, and placed on rake to cool. We will use this recipe every year. ps, I used old fashioned oats, not quick cooking.

As good and as easy as it gets. I'm a freak when making oatmeal raisin cookies and have to add choco-chips or butterscotch...I always when baking cookies turn oven off 5 mins before timer yells at me and leave cookies in oven till cool...yeah right I've never waited for anything to cool...grab your moo juice and enjoy....a keeper thank you... 5 giant stars.

We were wanting something sweet, so I looked around to see what ingredients I had on hand and whipped up these cookies. I had a few craisins and then added some (chopped) trail mix that i had on hand it was a mix of cashews, almonds, cranberries, yogurt chips and blueberries. they turned out great, the nuts were a nice touch. This is a great recipe to tweak to whatever fruit/nuts you prefer.

They just don't get better than this. I threw in a handful of chocolate chips too. The first time I made them, I undercooked by a minute and they were a bit soft. Next time I baked them until they were brown on top and they were just wonderful.

This recipe is awesome I always made cookies from the box and it was my first time making from scratch. Cookies turned out great! I add 1 t cinnamon like other reviewers and also substituted raisins with butterscotch. I will probably reduce sugar next time as butterscotch is already sweet. But I still love the cookies!

These cookies came out perfectly. They are soft and chewy but have a little crunch on the outside. The only sub I did was I added chocolate chips and pecans instead of cranberries and raisins. I also cooked them about 16 min-18 min.

Made these cookies today, turned out great! I read many of the reviews before I made them and followed many of the tips. I started by cutting the recipe in half (2 dozen), I used butter instead of margarine, although all I had was salted butter. So I didn't add extra salt as recipe directed to do. I added an extra 1/2c of rolled oats (not instant). Also added a dash of cinnamon. I used the full cup of brown sugar (Splenda) but only used 1/2c of white sugar. They were still sweet enough. I used 1 1/2 c of plain raisins, my husband wanted Oatmeal Raisin Cookies. He loved them!! Thank you for all the reviews everyone, made for a great first batch for me! BTW, I got 40 cookies out of this recipe even after cutting the original one in half!

Tasty!!! I did not add the raisins.  Instead added 1 teaspoon of lemon juice and some lemon zest.

These were good. I used old fashioned oatmeal, omitted the raisins, and added a cup of coconut and a few handfuls of walnuts. I can't rate how they keep, as they were gone almost as fast as they came out of the oven.

I was looking for a recipe for oatmeal raisin cookies and came across this one. I loved the different taste of the cranberries. I omitted the raisins b/c I didn't have any and I don't missed them at all! They spread out quite a bit so I have oatmeal craisin bars but that's okay. Next time I'll use a smaller spoon.

A new family favorite!!!  (because I cook with sea salt, I cut it to 1/2 t as sea salt as a stronger saltiness to it...I also did 1 1/2 cups of Craisins instead of 2, didn't use any raisins and they are still wonderful!!!!

I am rating this recipe with five stars..  I didn't change a thing .  I would  never rate a recipe that I had modified or changed dramatically. It's  not fair to the cook/baker .  
Great chewy texture and the craisins add a slightly tart flavor. 
Thanks Liane.

Great recipe! As suggested by others, I added an extra cup of oatmeal and only added craisins (2 cups total). Oh! And don't forget a bit of cinnamon... My 5 yr old son loved it for an after school treat.

These are amazing and easy to change up to your taste when using the basic ingredients. I switched some of the items to things I already had in my house such as increasing the cranberries, removing the raisins, and adding almond slices. I also used Costco's coach oats instead of cooking oats. I loved them and even my husband that does not like almonds or cranberries very much loved them!

Great recipe....I was looking for a recipe where I could clean out some stuff in the pantry and found this one.  I only use real butter in cookie recipes, so this one appealed to me.  I used dried cranberries, white chips, macadamia nuts, and mini choc. chips instead of crasins and raisins and I also used old fashioned oats instead of quick ones because that is what I had on hand, and it turned out fabulous!  Will make again using what I have on hand.  Very versatile.

Super easy to make.  I used dried strawberries in place of the raisins.  Changed the flavor profile a little bit, but kept everything else the same.  I will make these again.  Thanks for sharing.

Extremely good cookies  I added a bit of extra raisins and this time had doubled the recipe as it was for my husband's work.  I opted to do the 'bar' version as I didn't want to spend all day up and down taking cookies in and out of the oven.  They weren't 'beautiful' when I cut the bars up but were nice and chewy, the way I like them.  They all disappeared from work!

My family adores these cookies! Every time I make them they go crazy!! I usually make them with chocolate morsels, though, as opposed to Cranberry and Crasins. I have also found that using chocolate morsels is better than using chocolate chips.
Overall, I love this recipe, and I'm going to start adding a few little things here and there to make it my own ^_^

These cookies are awesome! I didn't have raisins, so I doubled up on the cranberries and added a bit of cinnamon. Also, I prefer chewier cookies so I took them out of the oven at the 12 minute mark and they were perfect. Will definitely make them again, what a treat!

Wow. These are super addicting. Really good. I halved the recipe and added 1 tsp of cinnamon. A tad bit on the sweet side though... I would probably cut down to 3/4 cup sugar (or 1 1/2 cups) next time.

These cookies are delicious.  I was not sure what to expect, but was very pleasantly surprised.  My husband loves them as well.  I did not have any oats, so I used packages of instant oats (brown sugar flavored).   I will definitely make these often and make sure I have them around the house.

This was great! I increased the amount of cranberries and reduced the raisins and they were a hit! Hats off to the baker who came up with this recipe!

Tasty as "sugar free" w/splenda blend.  Good texture and flavor balance. Add 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice and walnuts (for me).

These are good!  Maybe a little dry, but tasty.  I don't like raisins, so I added walnuts and some chocolate chips instead.  Turned out well and I would make them again.

Delicious! Don't like raisins, so subbed fresh cranberries. Soaked Craisins in 1/2 C OJ for like an hour before hand. Went to 3 C oats like many suggested, and subbed 1 C white for whole wheat flour. They are sweet, but not overbearingly so and because of the fresh cranberries in the mix it was a nice contrast. Definitely recommend them.

Yum! Omited the raisins and added a handful of chocolate chips. Baked for exactly 12 minutes - thought they were underdone at first - but crisped up perfectly upon cooling. Kids loved them!

"I think these are one of the best cookies I've ever had." Coming from my father, who's eat A LOT of cookies, that's pretty good. I added chocolate chips to the recipe. Everyone in my family loves these.  The first sheet of cookies turned out really thin (but good and chewy) so I added half a cup of oatmeal to the second half and they became much more granola-ey.  I may add half oatmeal, half flour for the next batch. Definately a keeper.

Good recipe.  I replace the raisins with white chocolate chips.  I also zest a couple oranges/clementines and add the juice (or OJ)- gives it a nice fresh flavor!

These cookies were fantastic.  We also ditched the raisins and just put in craisins - although we only put in 1.5 cups of craisins and it seemed to be plenty.  Next time I'll experiment with nuts too!

These cookies are fantastic. Nice and chewy. I used 2 cups of dried cranberries instead of adding raisins and somed chopped pecans, but other than that followed the recipe. This is the best recipe for oatmeal cookies I've tried to date.

I really liked these! I had a craving for Oatmeal raisin cookies, so I omitted the cranberries. I started making it and realized I only had one egg, so went on anyways, it turned out fine. The only change is its a bit too sweet. I will decrease the sugar next time I make these and add a few more oats.

Excellent, finally an oatmeal cookie with enough oats!  (admittedly, I increased a bit). Great with white or dark chocolate chips and subbing dried cherries.   I greased the pans (using nonstick spray) per the recipe, but the cookies spread out too much and got very dark on the bottom.  Without the nonstick, the cookie shape was much better and they didn't get too dark on the bottom.

I had to substitute vanilla because I didn't have any with cognac.  And I also had to substitute the raisins with more craisins.  Other than that, the recipe is fantastic.  I could see why white chocolate chips would work.

For those of you watching your salt, 1 teaspoon is a bit too salty. I will cut it back to 3/4 teaspoon next time. I pre-soaked a rounding 1 cup of craisins in orange juice for 5 to 10 minutes then drained the juice before adding to the batter and it gave a wonderful flavor to the cookie. I didn't add any additional raisins. This made a very delicate, delicious cookie that I will certainly make over and over!

I used all Craisins and added white chocolate chips. They were so good.
They went very quickly at our church bake sale.

Yum yum! These were perfect! Exactly what I was looking for - a yummy, fruit-filled, not too sweet oatmeal cookie! 
I didn't have any plain (all-purpose) flour to hand, so I used wholewheat flour instead, which worked just fine!  Take them out when they are still quite gooey and leave to cool completely on the baking trays - they will be gorgeously soft!

I made these for part of my Christmas gift to my friends, but made WAY too many of these.  Fortunately, they were my personal favorite of the three!  Very tasty!

I love these cookies!  I have played around  with the recipe but I have found that the original recipe works best.  I add though to the mix, a cup of ghirardelli chocolat with 60% cacoa & a cup of chopped walnuts.

These cookies are so yummy!  I have decided to make them for our annual Christmas Cookie Bake day with my extended family.  I also left out the raisins and added white chips.  Another yummy option (that I haven't personally tried yet) would be to add 1 Tbsp. of grated orange zest to the cookie dough.  

I also used fresh cranberries because I didn't have any craisins on hand.  I simply washed and chopped them and added them to the dough.  I added about twice the amount of cranberries to the recipe.

The cookies were excellent. I made half the quantity and followed the recipe except I added 1/2 cup oatmeal (total 1 1/2)...they were sweet to my taste but next day they were really really good and not as sweet...they were like the good store cookies....I will not make them again simply because I ate the whole thing and my son only managed to have two.....

These are delicious! I added walnuts and used golden raisins. For perfect baked goods every time the secret is to always use Land O' Lakes sweet cream butter - no substitutes!  You won't be disappointed!

I used a little less sugar and added a tsp cinnamon. This recipe was easy enough that I was able to let my toddlers help. Now I can't get them to stop eating them! These were really good. Thanks for the recipe!

They're flat and crunchy and just slightly too sweet. Either way, my husband enjoyed them.
