My husband is a New Orleans native and constantly complains about people attempting to make "their cuisine". This one passed the test with flying colors! We had this two weeks ago and he is begging me to make it again!

Excellent!! Just used olive oil, kielbasa, no file powder, and added some shrimp during the last 7 minutes. Since I added the shrimp, I used a full 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes. Also seasoned with some thyme and fresh basil. Cooked rice separately, so skipped on the broth.

Excellent! All I had on hand was Italian sausage and it was wonderful. I did need to add another can of tomatoes as there wasn't enough liquid for the rice to cook. Family loved it!

I followed this recipe to a T and it came out perfect. For those of you who are saying your rice didn't get done completely. Make sure you cover the pot and don't stir it once it's covered. As long as the heat isn't turned up too high you won't burn anything, just let it simmer with the lid on the pot for 20-25 minutes and the rice will be perfect. 

Also you are doing this dish a great injustice if you cook the rice separately. The whole purpose of putting it in with the rest of the ingredients is to flavor the rice, and you will not be able to do that if you cook it separately.

Also if you can't find File powder you can always use Okra as a substitute, but you will need to cook this dish a lot longer to achieve the right consistency. I would say you would need to cook the Okra for at least 30 minutes with the rest of the ingredients before you add the rice. Hope that helps.

This was very similar to my usual recipe I use for jambalaya. I have never used file powder and every batch turns out great. File is a thickening agent. Made a lot. Used Emeril's Kicked Up Smoked Sausage, which is pretty spicy. Also, I like cooking my rice separately and then incorporating into the jambalaya. You can do it either way -- I just like the texture of the rice better when cooking separately.

This is an excellent Jambalaya recipe. I followed it to a tee,  except a I added more spice than I should have.  I like spicy foods, but I am a bit nervous to serve it tomorrow to my guests.  The previous poster left great advice to go easy on the spices. File powder can be found in the baking aisle and is pronounced fee-lay (according to my grocer) Enjoy!!!!!!!!!!!

My rice never fuller cooked, I kept adding broth but the rice is still crunchy.  The flavor was great, but I think this recipe needs adjustment, I should have gone with my gut and cooked the rice on its own.

Mmmm, mmmm! Very filling and delicious!! I made this for a French-themed banquet at my high school and it was a hit! The peanut oil was unneccessary because the sausages released plenty of fat. I eliminated the file powder (did not have) and hot sauce, and it was plenty spicy! Try adding thyme, basil and oregano. Thanks for a great recipe.

My husband & I really enjoyed this dish.  I used olive oil instead of peanut oil.  Added prawns & ham and omitted the sausage as I couldn't get Andouille sausage in Australia. I added more cajun spice than specified and didn't have file powder.  Will definatley be making again.

This was incredible and made six extremely generous servings. I substituted canned pureed tomatoes for the crushed tomatoes since my husband prefers no tomato chunks. Another reviewer mentioned substituting tomato sauce, but several said the dish was on the thin side, so thought the puree would do the trick. Also used quinoa instead of rice since I am all into quinoa right now. 

When reheating it the next day it had thickened considerably in the 'fridge, and was really too thick to reheat easily on the stove top. I mixed in a can of tomato sauce ... perfection. It was even better the next day. 

This will definitely make it into the regular rotation.

I made this for a summer party last year and the one guitarist from the band we had called himself a "Jambalaya Junkie" and he gets it everywhere he goes. After trying some he proclaimed it the BEST he ever had!! He asked for the recipe and said I could pay him in Jambalaya!! He wasn't the only one!! I made a quadruple batch for the party and it ended up being one of the most brutally hot days in Reading Pa.'s history, and there was NONE of this left!! needless to say when I announced the date of this years party I was inundated with requests to make this again..just ALOT more of it!! The only thing I didn't do was add File powder since I was unable to find it. I made it a 2nd time and cooked the rice seperate like people said to do...family liked it better with the rice cooked in the sauce, had a more incorporated taste, not like it was just stirred in. Would recommend following the directions, tastes the best that way!!!!

Very good and very spicy! I wanted to make Jambalaya for my husband who is originally from Louisiana, we both loved it but he says there are no tomatoes in the jambalaya he grew up eating. I say who cares, it was yummy.

This was AH-MAZING! Even though I had to use Italian sausage (all I had!) it was still great. I added extra spices, Tabasco, etc cause we love spicy. Oh and I used Rotel instead of Italian tomatoes. Love that you just stir in uncooked rice--so easy. I ate this for lunch for two days after I made it! Can't wait to make again, maybe with shrimp. Thanks!

SALTY! If you make this, make sure you go easy on the salt. Especially if there is salt added in your cajun seasoning! Andouille sausage is also pretty salty. Do not salt your chicken while cooking it.

This made a very good and satisfying dinner. We prefer Chef John's Sausage & Shrimp Jambalaya to this one, and don’t think the flavor advantage is caused by the chicken in this recipe versus the shrimp in the other one but will have to test that out. Could not find file powder at grocer so it was omitted. We used 1, 12 oz. pack (4 sausages) Aidells Cajun Style Andouille sausage. Added two fresh jalapenos, thinly sliced, and combined w/ onion & celery. For Cajun seasoning, we used 2 tablespoons Creole Seasoning Blend by Joslyn from this site to season the sausage and chicken. We subbed brown rice for white, and increased cooking time in step 3 to about 35 minutes.

This recipe is amazing! Perfect spiciness and the rice was not undercooked as in other reviews. I used only 1 cup of rice and kept the 2 1/2 cups broth. I also used the entire 28oz can of crushed tomatoes (by accident) but it worked out for the better!

Wonderful!!!  I have made this dish 3 times now and even the picky eater of the house loves it.  I just some Polish Sausage since Andouille is a little hard to find around here.  I skip the file powder and use olive oil since I always have it on hand.  Instead of the white rice I use a Jambalaya mixture like the family size Zantarains family size mix.  Two of the cans of tomatoes.  Of course serve with some yummy cornbread!  This dish also reheats very well and I think eve taste better then next day!  Thanks so much for sharing this will be a favorite of ours forever!

Huge hit with my dinner guests! Omitted bell pepper & hot pepper sauce (one cause I'm allergic & 2 b/c my guests don't like super spicy). Used only andouille sausage (to save time, skipping step on cooking chicken) olive oil instead of peanut. I cooked brown rice separately due to the fact that I'm gluten sensitive; and only used 1/2 of what the recipe called for in chicken broth which I added as the dish was simmering. If your guests want it spicier, they can add their own choice of hot sauce. Served with my "Killer Cornbread" recipe with soy & dairy free unpasteurized (organic & locally grown) honey butter - HUGE hit!!Will be submitting cornbread recipe soon.

We love this recipe! but I wanted a more nutritional recipe (less cook time for veggies, no oil, and red rice): I used chicken broth to saute meat and veggies instead of oil. I cooked the veggies only 3 minutes before adding sausage and chicken back in pot with cooked red rice for 10 minutes to blend tastes. I also added uncooked shrimp and cooked for additional 7 minutes. Delicious! It tastes even better as leftovers!

This was really flavorful.  I've already served this for dinner for my friends on several occasions, and each time, someone asks for the recipe (and then I steer them to this site).  I cooked the rice separately to make sure it cooked all the way.  Will definitely keep making in the future.

This is a good, classic Jambalaya recipe. Just the right amount of heat for me. You can always add more spice, if you like. I made a few adjustments, though. We prefer ours more meaty, so I only used 2c stock and 1c rice. Exchanged half of the chicken for shrimp, added a couple of slices of bacon, a spoonful of chicken demi glace and omitted the file. A very satisfying meal!

This was the absolute best i've ever had.  I was raised in south central Louisiana, so i've had my share of jambalaya.   this one will definitely be in my rotation.

The flavor is great, but as given, the heat is a bit much. I'll definitely be making it again, and either eliminate the hot sauce or the red pepper flakes. With the Cajun seasoning (I use Slap Yo Mama), both those add more heat than is necessary.

Pretty good recipe. If cooked the way the creator suggests though, I needed a lot more broth (2 1/2 cans) and a whole can (28oz) of italian tomatoes than asked for to get my rice to the right consistency

Boneless, skinless thighs would be much moister than breasts. The  andouille I get is  already very spicy, so seasoning it is really unnecessary. As far as hot pepper sauce goes, I find that leaving it up to the individual works better than adding it to the pot, especially as, depending on the sauce, a lot of the flavor can get cooked away. This recipe makes a lot more than I thought it would.

If the rice is coming out crunchy, make sure you're using white rice, and that once you have brought the concoction to a boil, reduced the heat and covered, that you do not uncover until the dish is done, 20 to 25 minutes after covering.

This was great! I used chicken sausage instead of chicken and andouille sausage, and also added shrimp.  Omitted salt, and instead of file powder I used about 1 c. of cut okra to thicken the stew.  I also used brown rice.  This was a flavorful recipe, and ,ade a very good jumbalaya.  It's easy to play around from here (like with your own spices, okra vs. no okra, etc), and I liked being able to customize my proteins and rice -- if you use brown rice, go for short grain, and make sure to account for the longer cooking time!

Fantastic. I might go with a little less celery next time. I used one hot serrano pepper in place of the hot sauce, and got a nice slow burn through the entire dish. Nice work, Terri.

Very Authentic, I loved it without having to make any substitutions.    I'm a pressure cooker fanatic so did prepare it in my pressure cooker.

Made this for dinner last night and followed the recipe to a T except for leaving out the red pepper flakes and hot sauce due to children eating it. Flavor was excellent without the extra heat and everyone loved it. Besides, if you like it hotter you can always add hot sauce to your own serving. I did cook the rice separately in my rice cooker and served the dish over it, so I can't comment on what some reviewers say was too much liquid. I just adjusted the chicken broth amount down untill I had what I felt was a good consistency. I also added some okra and shrimp to the blend for a little healthier dish. This is definitely a keeper and will be made again.

I have made this twice with slightly different ingredients and love this! We live in the south and this is very authentic. I double the recipe so I can use 2lbs of different meat. Can use chicken,  shrimp, crawfish... whatever you have. I also like to cook my rice on the side with a rice cooker and just spoon it over. Leave out the chicken broth and just let simmer.

We made this as a low salt version due to personal preferences and it came out fantastic.  So much flavor.  The heat was steady and didn't become overpowering.  Will definitely make again.

Delicious, but very spicy especially if you use spicy andouille.  My husband loved this dish, and once I added lots of plain rice to my portion to cut the heat, I loved this jambalaya too!

Whooooooo-weeeeeeee!  This was hot and I loved it!  Couldn't find file powder and cooked the rice separately b/c I didn't want the leftovers to be mushy rice jambalaya casserole.  Other than that, followed it to a T.  Wouldn't change a thing....

This was very easy and very delicious!! One thing to note is that the written recipe does not say to cover it after adding the rice (however, the video does).  Covering it will eliminate any problems with getting the rice to cook! It came out perfect.

I don't use peanut oil, I use olive oil. Cooking at medium does not require a high smoke point oil. I use hot Italian sausage and lots more than the recipe calls for. I also use a larger can of crushed tomatoes and more chicken broth. Even if I could find file powder I would not use it. I throw in a small can of tomato paste if it needs thickening and just simmer it longer. Having said all that, it is a very good base recipe.

this took me forever today and thats because I waited till I had 2 chicken carcasses to make the stock. I was a jerk and used this as the frame work and LOVE how it turned out. If it wasnt for this recipe I wouldnt have this dinner tonight. Thank you

Will definitely make this again.  However, my first attempt came out WAY to salty.  I would recommend cutting back or eliminating the salt until you've tasted your final result - then add to taste.  The brand of Cajun you use makes a big difference.

Yummy! This was great! It was somewhat spicier than we were expecting, so if you have kids or have someone in your family who can't take heat, I would say cut back on the pepper. Otherwise I wouldn't change a thing! Delish!

First time we made Jambalaya. We really enjoyed it. It is spicey though - you may want to cut back on some of the spices if you're not a fan of hot food.

My first homemade Jambalaya and it was excellent!! I used Kielbasa because I didn't have andouille sausage and I added some shrimp when there was about 7 minutes of cooking time left.  Also I didn't use file powder - don't know what it is and I didn't miss it. :)

Perfect blend flavors.  Like many others, I used olive oil instead of peanut oil.  I couldn't find a 16 oz can of crushed Italian tomatoes, so I used diced.  I was too lazy to find file powder, so I left that out.  Turned out perfect.

Absolutely delicious! My sister recommended this recipe to me, and she was right on. My husband and I used turkey andouille sausage to cut down on the fat content and added some extra veggies (red bell pepper, zucchini, and yellow squash--all diced) to make it a more complete meal, and it was fantastic. We upped the spices to compensate for the extra ingredients, and it had just the right amount of heat. This is definitely one we'll be making again and again.

This was my first time making Jambalaya and it was a huge success! Everyone loved it!! Even the picky eater. The only thing I changed was in the last 10 minutes I added a minced sauteed jalapeno for more spice.

This was really a good recipe.  I did change a few things.  Used chicken hips seasoned with Cajun Seasoning (salt, oregano, paprika, cayenne, black pepper) and baked.  Then deboned. Did not have andouille at our town market so used spicy Italian sausage.  cooked veggies as in recipe.  after adding all ingredients back in (skipped chicken broth) and heated up.  Added a pound of shrimp and turned off heat and covered til shrimp was just cooked.  Served over rice white rice.  Nice slow burn with the seasonings. oh yeah, skipped the file powder, did not hurt it

Be really careful with the cayenne pepper - it's SUPER hot and can be overwhelming. Great recipe, specially if made with pre-cooked rice. I used chorizo sausage and added prawns. Easy and fast. I will definitely make it again.

5 stars for this one.  Made very few changes.  I did cook the rice separately.  Used 2 cans of diced tomatoes, had to make my own creole seasoning (from this website) and it was just the right amount of spice for our tastes. I used 1 large chicken breast, 8 oz of skinless kielbasa, and 1/2 pound of raw shrimp.  I sauteed the shrimp with some of the oil (I used regular vegetable oil) and seasoning and added it with the sausage for the last 10 minutes of cooking.  Very good and will definitely make again.  May add more garlic next time because we love the flavor so much.

The recipe was very good after i made a few modifications.    first modification I made was buying whole Italian tomatoes and blending them myself for a few seconds. after that was added it didnt seem enough sauce, so i added a can of crushed diced tomotoes to the mixture.    I didnt use File so i substituted with a combination of  cajun seasoning,thyme,italian seasoning,seasoned salt,garlic powder,salt, and pepper.    The last modification was i cooked my rice separately in a mixture of chicken broth and seasoned salt and added it at the tomatoe sauce at the very end. it Ended up tasting very good.Will make again. Thanks for the recipe!!!

This was an awesome recipe!  I'm starting to broaden my horizons in the cooking are and I have to admit, I have an affliction for spicy food.  I used spicy italian sausage instead because I didn't have the time to run to the gourmet market, but I did find some file powder.  I think this is a keeper!

I think I may have stumbled on the reason why some reviews say the rice didn't get cooked, while others say it did.  I doubled this recipe & cooked half in a Dutch oven & the other half in a skillet with a lid.  Both had the exact same ingredients & liquid.  Both were cooked the same amount of time, both pots had lids & I resisted the urge to check on it until the full amount of time had passed.  The Dutch oven one came out perfectly.  But in the skillet one, the rice did not get cooked enough.  I had to add extra broth & cook longer.  It just never seemed to cook the rice enough.  So finally I transferred it to the Dutch oven & only then did the rice cook.  I think it must be something about how the Dutch oven conducts the heat as opposed to the skillet.  Other than that one hitch, this is a delicious recipe.  I would make it again.

Simple Simon.....great stuff! Nothing too exotic; reminiscent of mom's old Spanish rice recipe...but with the "exotic" meat instead of just hamburger. Oh, speaking of which, feel free to sub shrimp for the chicken. Just as good, if not better! (Remember to go easy on the garlic if you have a doctor's appointment in the morning....which I DO!)

Very good.  It's quite spicy but not enough to make it inedible, just a slow burn...lol
I added some small shrimp to it which made it even meatier.  I cooked frozen small raw peeled deveined & tail-off shrimp with a little Cajun seasoning, just like the sausage & chicken & set it aside with the other meat.  I only used 6oz but I could have used 12oz easily.
The celery really needs a few extra min of cooking time by itself first, if possible.  Even after finishing cooking for the entire time, the celery was still not quite tender.  I would give the celery 5-10 min by itself before adding the onions & peppers, then add the garlic after that since garlic burns fast.
Couldn't find 16oz cans of crushed tomatoes so I used 14.5oz diced Italian tomatoes & it was fine.  I used just a tad over 1 1/4 cup of rice to empty my package so I added another 1/2 cup of broth & even with the smaller amount of tomatoes there was still plenty of liquid for the rice.  If you follow the directions & bring it to a boil & then simmer for 25 min, it's perfect.
Also had to leave out the file powder since I couldn't find it.  It thickened fine on it's own.  And just my preference, I reduced the red chili flakes & hot sauce to 1/4 tsp each.  There was still plenty of spice!  Oh, I just used regular vegetable oil for the meat & veggies instead of peanut oil...no problems

All in all this is a good variation.  I.stead od tomatoes, i recommend using Rotel tomatos and diced chili.  I use nothing else.  And save the file powder for the gumbo.  It does not belong in jambalaya.

What a great recipe. 
As per another review I used Joslyns Creole seasoning for the Cajun seasoning.
After reading up on file powder I substituted 1tsp of cornstarch added to enough COLD water to cover and mixed until dissolved.  I added this for the thickening.
I have made this several time and have enjoyed it enough there were no left overs.
I did substitute beef broth for the chicken once and it tasted equally as good.
I do struggle with my rice sticking to my pan even on the lowest heat setting, but regular stirring helps, although it has a tendency to mush the rice a little.
Thanks for sharing!

Really good, but quite watery initially (making rice a little soggy). (The recipe calls for as much water as you would use to cook rice normally, but the jambalaya sans rice/water added is already pretty liquidy.) If you're planning to make this in advance and freezing for dinner throughout the week this isn't a problem as it reheats REALLY well. Otherwise, I'd add the rice and start by adding half the water at first & increase from there. One other note,some people complained the rice wasn't cooked...once you add the rice, DO NOT uncover the pot. For those that want to keep looking at it, get a pot with a glass lid. :)

This was very good! Very spicy, so beware. I did not use the file powder, and added some salad shrimp. I could only find chicken andouille sausage, but it was fabulous. I also cooked the rice separately, in 1/2 water 1/2 chicken stock for flavor.

I had not made jambalaya in years, so I decided to try this recipe. It is simply fantastic! This is just as good as one made without tomato. Reading reviews, I did do as advised, adding rotel ~ also browning center cut boneless pork to add to the meat ingredients. File' is important in the Deep South and it adds a deep richness to the dish. No added salt needed. I cook with red pepper, using black pepper only occasionally. Long grain rice was my grandmother's choice, but covering the pot while rice cooks is a must. I use short grain, which doesn't give quite the texture needed for authentic jambalaya , but does not change the flavor.  The only other addition was green onions, about 15 mimutes before fully cooked. Any good sausage will do, in place of the andouille.  The dish I grew up with was cooked with smoked sausage.  Truly good!

Just finished making it.....OUTSTANDING!  I can't have spice but I still like Jambalaya.  I substituted smoked chicken sausage.  I used petite diced tomatoes and they broke down during the simmer.  Next time I will use shrimp

This was outstanding! Easy to make and pretty fast.  Left out the file powder, added kidney beans instead of chicken, used leftover chicken sausage. Also used half veggie broth half water instead. I did need to add more water/broth to have enough liquid for the rice to cook.  Yum!!! Will be making this again!

I love this recipe! It tastes great. I sometimes add crawfish or shrimp with it too. I also use more cajun seasoning than it calls for just because it adds good flavor.

This was delicious! Except my rice never fully cooked. I followed the directions to a T. I will definitely make this again, except after I add the rice and chicken broth I will cover the pot so the rice can steam and fully cook.

I had to alter the recipe based on what I had in the pantry. What I ended up with was great. I cut the recipe in half and cut out all seasonings except for the Cajun seasoning. I used one can of Tomatoes with green chilies vs listed one. I also substituted all of the remaining ingredients and the rice for one bag of Spanish rice. I found that the dish was dry so I added the entire can of tomatoes with green chilies (would have called for 1/2 since the recipe was halved) to compensate. Nice recipe, I think I will make again just the way I did tonight.

I have been a Cajun cook for years... this is the most accurate depiction of how to do this Jambalaya I have seen.  Simple and to the point, the flavors speak for themselves.

I also fried up some smoked bacon once... and that was an added bonus.  Not very traditional, but effective.

Absolutely awesome! I added shrimp with the same spices. Then added in a tsp of thyme, tsp of cayenne pepper and a half tbs of dried chives. Also reduced the broth by half a cup. We like it hot! So if you're cooking for kids resuce the heat on it. Love love loved it! Will be making this again.

Delicious!  Can't get italian seasoned crushed tomatoes where I am so I used diced instead - I liked the texture of the diced better anyways.  The taste would change a lot depending on the hot sauce used.

Fantastic stuff.  I've never had jambalaya before but I've made it several times using this recipe.  Followed prettt closely, but found that cooking the rice separately worked better for me.  Never used file powder, and have tweaked the spices a little to my own taste (I have some cajun seasoning with cayenne it in that I like).  Have used smoke sausage as well as andouille with success either way.

I'm trying to cut out some carbs so I tried this recipe with the "cauliflower instead of rice" trick and it was phenomenal!! Didn't change a thing other than reducing the chicken broth to 1.5 cups to compensate for the lack of rice. We'll be making this a lot!

Added shrimp and some extra tomato, rice still came out crunchy... Delicious though.
2016 Edit: 
This has become a family standard with a few adjustments: 20 ounces of crushed tomato, 2 tsp of Tabasco, 2 1/2 cups chicken broth (always use more than less in this recipe), and do NOT go without the file powder. Order it on Amazon. Worth it. We don't do the shrimp anymore, my daughter (she's 3) won't eat it with the shrimp.

Great recipe! My husband came home and asked, "did you make this from scratch?" We usually eat the instant stuff to make dirty rice, jambalaya, etc. The taste was very good. What's great is you can cut back the spice to your taste. We loved it spicy! I followed some suggestions and prepared the rice seperate omitting the chix broth entirely. Over some hot jasmine rice...YUM!

Good, but next time I would make the rice separately and add it in just before serving. Also pretty spicy, maybe I will cut back on the spice in the cooking process and add more when serving so that everyone can enjoy it.

Great, Mine was a little soupy, only because i added more chicken broth. But Jambalaya is supposed to be thick and not soupy, my mistake but still turned out great

Good recipe. The only change is I didn't use celery because we don't care for it & the file powder... not sure what that is & couldn't find it. Next time I'll add shrimp too.

This was excellent! I omitted file powder and the celery. I went easy on the green peppers. Even my kids ate it! I will definitely make this again.

iv'e made this recipe countless times, as given and with modifications and this is my favorite, noted i like it a bit on the spicy side...do not use olive oil, a couple hot, 1 sweet hungarians with a anaheim in lieu of bell peppers, a extra stalk or 2 of celery, coat your chicken and sausage up good (1tspn apiece)w/cajun seasoning, for the sausage use whatever size it comes in, mine is usually a 16oz package, for a treat (i live in mich) order "real" andouille sausage, (jacobs in louisianna makes top of the line and has a web site), add a extra can of petite diced tomatoes, 1 tspn hellfire sauce, add a 1 lb of shrimp the last 6-8 minutes, add 1tsp cayenne pepper, use only long grain converted rice (prevents any clumping) and it has taken me ~35 minutes for rice to finish, do not forget the file powder, if you can not get it locally, order on-line as if you make this your probably going to make gumbos down the line and will need it...i have made this w/additions of smoked ham, crayfish tails, and scallops, it all comes out very good...

This dish is spicy and so good!  I let it simmer for nearly 20 minutes because I like the rice a little wet.  Loved it!

I've made this recipe a number of times over the past several years and I stay fairly faithful to the recipe.  I have had no problems finding any of the ingredients in my local grocery stores.  It's easy to make, delicious, and the leftovers reheat in the microwave perfectly.

Update 9/28/14 - I do precook the rice, I use a 29oz can of crushed tomatoes (because I like tomatoes) and I reduce the stock to a cup and a half since I don't need it to cook the rice. Comes out perfectly and tastes delicious.

Loved it!!! I added 1 lb. of frozen shrimp, an extra 1/2 cup of rice, and a large handful of julienned carrots. I halved the amount of chicken and used my leftover boiled chicken. The andouille sausage is great, but I'm sure it would turn out with other sausages if you can't find the andouille. I didn't have any file powder, but it didn't need thickened anyway.  Overall, it was a great dinner, and I was able to get my husband to eat all kinds of veggies!!!

Mighty tasty!!  Great recipe!  I used a little extra cajun seasoning and hot sauce, and used Uncle Ben's converted rice.  I also used thighs vs. breasts.  I will make this again as soon as I get more fresh andouille from the local sausage shop.  Can't wait to share this in the work lunch room. Made it again and the eaters raved about it. They all want the recipe. This is my favorite!

This was sooo good. don't be afraid to experiment - I didn't have all of the ingredients on hand, so I used olive oil rather than peanut, onion flakes and jarred garlic rather than real; I also left out the andouille, celery, pepper, worcestershire and file.  I ended up adding italian seasoning and more red peppers and cajun seasoning to kick up the flavor.

I wish I could give this a 6!! This was delicious. The only time I've ever had jambalaya that compared to this was in a restaurant--and I think this is better. I did need a little more liquid than it called for. I added some pre-cooked shrimp a few minutes before serving and it was fabulous. This one's a keeper!

Followed the recipe pretty much to the letter with the exception of adding a little more spices and I used a full 28oz can of  crushed tomatoes (I didn't want to waste it). As recommended by another reviewer I reduced to a very low temp (1 on my GE gas range) and covered to cook for 25 mins, without stirring. There was still a little liquid so I cooked an additional 10 mins, then stirred and let sit off the heat for 20 mins... and the rice is perfect!

I made a few changes in mine. For the meat I used Silva Naturals Serrano Chili & Mango smoked sausage, leftover Christmas shrimp cocktail and leftover Christmas ham. 

I used 2 14.5 Oz cans of chicken broth to get enough fluid for the rice. 

I did not use file powder and it thickened up nicely on its own. 

I added 1 bunch of green onions

I  added 1 red bell pepper to the green one. 

It is super yummy!  I will make this again, probably regularly.

I made this for some family when I was in Virginia. The recipe is easy to follow and it was good. However, being a South Louisiana native, I have a bone to pick with you about the tomatoes. That is a North Louisiana concoction. A true South Louisiana jambalaya doesn't have those dreadful things. Other than that, it's a good recipe. Just be sure you know what part of the state you're cooking from.

Mixing italian tomatoes, worchestershire sauce, and hot pepper cauce in a jambalaya recipe was a disaster. The salt proportion was way too much, and cooking rice in an already finished dish is just nuts. Salvaged it with some extra saltless cajun seasoning to some degree but do yourself a favor and avoid this one!

First time making Jambalaya and it was great.  After reading many reviews I was careful with the spices since too hot isn't what we like.   I used fresh locally made Andouille sausage which added plenty of it's own spices, pre-cooked chicken and 1/2 to 3/4 lb. large peeled shrimp, double the amount of tomatoes, red pepper (green are so boring), a couple bay leaves, and a TBL or 2 of tomato paste.  No celery, used some celery seed, and Cajun seasoning.   Be careful with the salt!   I cooked the rice separately, based on reviews, in chicken broth.   I simmered it very slowly, then refrigerated for about 4 hrs so the flavors would come together.   Reheated and served with the white rice.  Delicious and will definitely make this again.  Thanks for the recipe, and all the previous reviews!

Loved this recipe - though I didn't make it as traditional jambalaya. I used hot italian sausage, and also threw in a couple of spare mushrooms that I had on hand. I also added a bit of the celery leaves, and some fresh parsley. I skipped the file powder as I did not have it on hand. It was excellent.

This was delish and all 3 of my kids ate it!  I did change up a few things.  I used regular hot sausage and leftover rice that was already cooked.  I condensed the chicken broth because it didn't need to absorb into the rice.  I didn't have an onion on hand (rare), but used onion flakes.  This was so yummy, and was great with cornbread!  FAT TUESDAY YUM!

Left out the spicy parts (tabasco, red pepper flakes, black pepper, and swapped creole for cajun seasoning), also used one of the review suggestions and added shrimp at the end and increased the tomatoes to 28oz. Lastly, I used brown rice because we were out of white rice and I enjoyed the enhanced texture with the brown rice although it added to the overall cooking time by another 25 minutes.  Deeeelicious!!!

This was a wonderful recipe. I did not follow the recipe because it didn't seem necessary. By this I mean is that I added the chicken and sausage together and let them cook through with the Cajun seasoning. I then added the vegetables and garlic listed and cooked for another 5 minutes. After that I added the tomatoes, Worchester sauce, hot sauce and other seasonings. I let that cook for 10 minutes. I added the rice and broth as instructed and put a lid on it for 20 minutes. It came out great and the rice wasn't underdone. Thanks for the wonderful recipe. I will be making it often. BTW-I didn't have any file powder and I don't think it exists up here in PA.

Very tasty!! The only differences i made was: I did not use file powder, and I cooked yellow rice in the chicken broth prior to adding it to the rest of the ingredients - delicious! Has the perfect amount of spice to it! I will make this again for sure!

Very easy to make. I added shrimp the last 6 min of cooking time. I did not use file powder and used celery salt instead of chopped celery. Yummy!

So delicious! Made it with vegan sausage and leftover tofu. For those having issues with crunchy rice, turn down the heat and cover your pot. I made this in a lidded dutch oven cooking on low heat, turned out moist and fluffy.

I have never had Jambalaya prior to trying a few recipes. We made a huge pot of this, some to freeze for later. We added shrimp. 
word of caution, portion control is impossible for me and this recipe. It is so addictive to my taste buds. The taste, texture, spice all work together. Nice to come home, reheat and eat :)
Ps, favorite recipe I have found- period.

I used olive oil instead of peanut oil and just started the chicken cooking and added my precooked chicken andouille to it when it was mostly done and then removed both when done cooking and continued the recipe.  For the Cajun seasoning, I used the recipe from here.  And because of others input used 1/3 of a green pepper...and omitted the file because I couldn't find it in the store (I since have and will try it next time just to see). Other than that I followed the recipe.  This was SO GOOD!  We all loved it!!!

My go to recipe.  Did I make changes?  Sure!  I believe recipes are like a AAA trip tic, it tells you how to get there, but not all the stops.  Main change was 28 oz tomatoes. That's all I had.  Simmered abut longer.

Very good! The amount of water is right - I thought it seemed high, the juices from all the other stuff might make it too soggy but instead the rice that ended up on top was a bit undercooked - MY fault. Follow the recipe. I used about half the tomato stuff too which also could have been the reason for that. I also put the lid on the giant pan/wok thing I was using during the simmer phase.

I absolutely love this recipe.  I've made it several times now.  As with most recipes, I use it as a base, and modify it according to what I have on hand, and our tastes.  I have never seen file powder, and haven't needed it as a thickening agent at all.  I use whatever sausage I have on hand (usually a spiced chicken sausage), and don't always add another meat (chicken or shrimp).  I also don't use any salt or pepper.  The Club House Cajun seasoning I have on hand spices it up sufficiently.  I also use that seasoning liberally, I don't measure...I also use a quinoa, sprouted and wild rice blend to up the healthy factor.  I know I change a lot, but my recipe wouldn't be as good, without this one to give me guidance.  So, thank you so much!! (I also pop in some mushrooms and use diced tomatoes)

Great recipe, not hard to make at all. Alot of flavor and my family loved it. The only small changes that I made was I simmered seasoned chicken drumsticks with onion and celery until the meat was coming off the bone and the liquid was reduced into a rich chicken stock. I then took the meat of the bones (leave it in chunks, don't shred it) and used the chicken stock for the recipe. Also I omitted the Worchestersire altogether and used a little more seasoning and hot pepper sauce then the recipe called for because I like mine spicy. Overall very good, authentic recipe and I will make this time and time again!

The crunchy rice problem is because the pot has to be covered while cooking the rice.  The first time, I found this recipe to have too much of a tomato flavor.  I substituted 8 oz of chicken broth for 8 oz of the crushed tomatoes, and it was perfect the second time.

I served this to my husband and he raved about it so much at work one of his co-workers begged him to bring a sample, which he did. We ended up having a dinner date 3 nights later and I made this again. I ended up making this twice in 2 weeks that's how much my husband loved it! I always change ingredients to my family's tastes and this was no exception. I found a cajun seasoning recipe on this site and used that and omitted all the extra seasoning (red pepper flakes, salt, pepper) b/c it was already in the cajun mix. Recipes always turn out better for me if I taste as I go and adjust! This is one of our family favorites!

Delicious! I make this regularly and one of my boyfriend's favories. I went with some of the other reviewer's suggestions and use a 28 ounce can of crushed tomatoes and throw in some basil, thyme and oregano as well. I haven't been able to find the file powder but it doesn't seem to affect the recipe with it not being added. Definitely a yummy, filling meal that is just as good the second day as the first!

I "kinda sorta" followed the recipe. I used all ingredients per quantities but did it a bit easier. I sauteed the vegetables, then added the sausage & chicken (with the Cajun seasoning). When chicken was cooked, I added the remaining ingredients, brought it to a boil, then reduced heat, covered & simmered until rice was done & liquid was absorbed. It was delicious and so much easier than following the directions as written. Also, at the end, I stirred in 1/2-lb cooked shrimp & heated through. Definitely a keeper.

Loved this recipe!  I added an extra bell pepper, extra 1/2 onion, 1 extra clove of garlic, and I used 2 14.5 ounce cans of tomatoes.  I also doubled the red pepper flakes and put in several extra dashes of pepper sauce because we like a little extra heat.  This turned out great!

Delish! I did not have worcestershire or file powder on hand, so I left those out and it was still great. I am not a big fan of the casing on sausage, so I removed it. The meat was so tender and the flavors really melded nicely.  I cooked the brown rice separately and added to the bowl when serving. Keeps it from getting mushy, especially if you are going to have leftovers. Perfect hotness and flavor!

This was a fabulous meal!  My father raved it was the best meal he's had in a long time even tho my mother is a terrific cook.  Several in my family cannot eat garlic or too much hot spice so I made the following alterations:  No Cajun or file spice - instead I used Smoked Paprika & Basil.  Smoked kielbasa instead of Andouille.  I also added a can of cream of chicken soup which gave it all a very yummy creamy smoked flavor.  I served the rice on the side.  It was even better the second day.

This recipe has gotten a permanent place in our rotation - it is soooo good.  I add more celery and onion and about half again as much of the andouille and its perfect every time.  I think the file powder adds an authentic flavor that is worth adding if you can find it at your grocer.

Delicious! To suit our tastes, we use chicken and ham and shrimp, no sausage. We halve all the "spicy" spices, and double the crushed tomatoes. We cook the rice in a rice cooker on the side. Thanks for all the helpful reviews!

Very good. I backed off on the hot sauce a bit, since I am more of a "medium" heat kind of a girl. Used canned turkey instead of raw chicken, since that is what I had. Threw in some small shrimp with there were just a couple of minutes left. Yum!

This is close to the reciepe ive used for years.  Its a very hearty reciepe. I didn't go easy on the spices and it was a rich vibrant dish. I added another can of tomatoes and reduced it for 2 hours. No File spice on hand but it reduced well.  I used spicy Italian sausage. Rather than rice I like serving on a fucili pasta. 
Yummy!

Great dish! No variations really, just omitted the red pepper flakes and used a bit more creole seasoning.

Excellent, this is one recipe I truly CRAVE when it's been too long.  This is SPICY, go easy on the hot peppers--you can always add more later if it's not spicy enough for you!  I also added thyme and oregano.  Oh and I know adding sour cream isn't proper cajun, but adding some at the table will tone down the spiciness if needed.

I really like this recipe.  My family doesn't enjoy peppers & onions so I usually make this for myself when they go out of town and I eat on it for a week!  I add a red bell pepper because I like the added color.  I prefer to serve the jambalaya on a bed of rice rather than put the rice in the jambalaya, so I omit the chicken broth altogether and use a 24 oz. can of crushed tomatoes and an additional 12 oz. can of diced tomatoes with green chilis.  Without the broth, the heat is a little more intense so if you modify like this and don't like too much heat, you should reduce the amount of spice.   All in all, great recipe.

I used brown rice and cooked it separately then combined it with the vegetables and meats to which I had added about 1 1/2 cups of chicken broth. Delicious!!!

I follow this recipe as it is written, only I use brown rice instead of white. It takes longer to simmer (about an hour), but it healthier. I also use less oil in the beginning, because the sausage provides plenty of fat. 
Finally, I do not take the sausage or chicken out of the pot, just add the veggies in and it works out perfectly.

A family favorite! All three kids (4-12 years old) love jambalaya nigh - as do the adults. This makes great leftovers for lunches during the week at work. The spices are a great mix in this recipe. We cut down on them a touch for two of our kids, but the third likes it spicy! He actually adds more tabasco! We play around with adding more veggies and switching out the meats based on what we have on hand. Currently using Jenny'O turkey kielbasa with/without chicken and/or shrimp. We always use brown rice - that's all we buy - and it still tastes great. Excellent recipe - has the honor of being in our regular rotation!

Good flavor. Followed the recipe exact except for the file powder. Coudn't find it at the local market. So I substituted with a teaspoon of corn starch. Family thought it was good as well, however, the kids thought it had a little to much heat. Next time I'll back of the heat some for the kids sake. :) I will be making this dish again... Very tasty.....

I am from Louisiana and this is AWESOME!  Skipped the file powder because I've never eaten jambalaya with it.  Added a large can of crushed tomatoes as someone said it needed it for rice, but wound up having to add extra rice because it was too soupy.  No big deal, had some in the fridge.  Easy and delicious!

Great recipe - we loved it and made no changes (except for no file powder, not sure it's really necessary?). Also, used Minute Rice and made separate, so could add as much/little rice as desired. This was a hit!

This is my new favorite Jambalaya recipe. My husband was asking when I could make this again. The only changes I made was add a little more chicken broth to make sure the rice was cooked, omitted the celery, instead added frozen okra the last 7 minutes of cooking. Next time may try with shrimp. YUM

I used about 1 lb of deer sausage and 1/2 lb of chicken.  Threw in a couple diced jalepenos and doubled the hot sauce since I like things spicy.  Couldn't find any file powder.  Turned out delicious and just as good reheated for lunch the next day.

This was delicious.  I used smoked turkey sausage and toned down the hot spices so that my 4 1/2 year old could also eat it.  One suggestion.  If you choose to use brown rice like I did, you will need to use already cooked rice or it takes forever to get tender.  Also you need more liquid for brown rice.  No fault of the recipe though.  Will make it again.

I have to say that I totally changed this recipe due to my tastes and on what I had on hand.  I used olive oil instead of the peanut oil. I used a Kroger (Smith's) ground country sausage instead of the andouille sausage.  I used two (1/2 inch) slices of a turkey ham instead of the chicken breasts. I added more of the vegetables, and used garlic grandules instead of real garlic.  I used some fire roasted tomatoes with garlic instead of the crushed Italian style.  I used a wild rice and brown rice mixture that I cooked ahead of time to make sure that it was cooked.  I then let this simmer for about 30 minutes to let the flavors blend together.  It turned out so good that my husband can hardly wait for me to make it again.  Thanks for the great recipe starter, and I think I will try it again and maybe I will use all fish items.  Who knows!

Too spicy of course, but quite good. I needed to add an extra quarter to half cup of broth to get the rice fully cooked (took 25 min covered).

While this is quite a good dish, these just aren't the flavors I like best. Spicy and savory aren't as good as sweet and delicate.

Wonderful. I used kielbasa as the only meat, since it was all I had, but otherwise followed the recipe. I normally end up adding a little extra spice to recipes from this site, but the amounts given here were perfect for me. If you're unsure, probably best start with less red pepper and add more to taste.

Just made this for my husband and he has declared it his all time favorite - and has requested it for future birthday meals. I used half the rice (and half the water) and did not use the file powder. He also prefers chicken thighs so I used 6 thighs.

Since I am vegetarian, my version used 2 pounds baby portabellas in place of the meat, red wine vinegar in place of the Worcestershire Sauce and veggie broth.

I haven't had jambalaya in years, and this was certainly worth the wait.  Thanks for the great recipe!

An excellent dish! We made it vegetarian by using tofu instead of meat, using more vegetables like red pepper, and using vegetable stock instead of chicken broth. It was fantastic!

Delicious!!  After the Jambalaya was cooked, we threw raw shrimp into the pot and put the lid back on for 10 minutes (we stirred the shrimp into the jambalaya mixture).  It all came out soo good!  The kids ate it all and had seconds because the flavors were mild.  The adults sprinkled Frank's Hot Sauce on top of ours to spice it up a little bit more.

This recipe turned out great and you can't beat a one-pot meal. I used smoked polish sausage instead of andouille and couldn't find file. No matter my guests raved and this one is going in the recipe box.

I used the Cajun Spice recipe on this site by Bobbie Jean.  I added Cumin to it and omitted the pepper flakes so it wasn't too spicy.  I also used red sweet peppers because our family does not like green.  This is a great, easy recipe.  I did not have chicken so I used shrimp instead. It didn't need the file powder, just let it reduce a little longer.  It was delicious! Thanks Terri!

Fantastic recipe.  Whole family loved it.  Used 3 cans of chicken broth and instant rice.  Added white pepper, red pepper, and Mrs Dash due to some of the reviews stating it needed salt.  The Mrs Dash really added flavor at the end.  Also used hot and medium Italian sausage due to the family not liking andouille sausage.  It was perfect.  Not too spicy and fantastic flavor.

I used kielbasa instead of andouille because that's what I had, but everything else as written. My family really enjoyed this.

This was a wonderful recipe!  It is very hard to find a descent jambalaya around here.  Even the local cajun restaurant can't seem to get it right.....all heat and no flavor!  This recipe made a very flavorful, tasty dish.  Next time I make it, I'm going to through in some seafood too!  Yum!

This was fantastic!    Very easy to prepare.   I added shrimp at the very end.  I added a bit more rice too and ended up with a large pot.  It was so good we barely had any leftovers - even my young boys loved it, and they never like anything I cook.  Thanks for sharing.

FAN-TASTIC!   Used olive oil instead of peanut oil and sauteed the andouille with the veggies since it was precooked. Added some frozen shredded chicken. Used some frozen homegrown tomatoes and added some (very) spicy salsa since I didn't have enough tomatoes or any hot pepper sauce. Didn't have file powder and it turned out great anyway. Used long-grain brown rice cooked for 20 mins separately, and then I added to jambalaya and simmered for another 20 since it was the long cook kind of rice.  My husband said it was some of the best jambalaya he's had in a very long time.

Very good! I did not have the file, so I added okra, as many other recipes said to "substitute". Really there is not a substitute for file, but to thicken it, it did the job! Definantly will make again!

I was looking for a recipe to use brats from a bbq the night before. I also had bell peppers, onions, and tomatoes left over. It was amazingly good.  I did double the recipe since he had so many veggies and meat left. But the taste was spicy without being overpowering and I hate very hot spicy food. This one is a keeper for sure.

I made this and used olive oil for peanut oil and subbed cornstarch for file powder and it turned out great. It has just enough heat, any more and it would be too hot for my family.

I agree with another reviewer that this is a great base recipe as you can alter it depending on what you have on hand.  I had some italian sausages I needed to use up and thought I would try to make jambalaya for the first time.  This recipe was plenty spicy for me.  Great flavors.  I used olive oil, and tomatoes with green chiles (didn't have green pepper)  Will definitely make this again...next time with chicken and shrimp!

Overall this recipe turned out very delicious. The last time I had jambalaya, it was made by a real cajun, but it didn't have as much tomato taste to it.  I increased this recipe because I could only find a 16 oz package of sausage, a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes, and my chicken was a pound and a half package of chicken tenderloins.  So I increased the other ingredients similarly.  I ended up using 3 cups of Jasmine rice with 4 1/2 cups of chicken broth. The real test is yet to be taken... How will my husband like it?

I made this recipe when I was just learning how to go out of my comfort zone with cooking.  My husband loved it and he is a tough critic.  This is a great recipe to follow to the T or add a little of your own style to it.  I love it and cook it often now. Thank you!

Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.  I did a few things different though.  I added shrimp, 3 bay leaves, half of a yellow bell pepper (for color) and doubled the crushed red pepper flakes (I like my food hotter than most).  I also found that I could not get the rice to cook with the recipe as is, so I made the dish without, and then added 3 boil-in-bags of rice during the last 20 minutes of cooking.  But overall very, very tasty.

I wish I could be as excited about this one as everyone else.  It had a great list of ingredients, but was just okay.  Probably won't try this one again. Rice was too wet and the spices were overwhelming. (I like spicy food)

This recipe was a great base...I changed it up a bit which is why I gave it 4 stars as is.  I really like to see lots of color in a Jambalaya.  I put in yellow, green and red bell pepper (1 of each) as well as 2 jalapenos and some fresh Italian parsley.  I was a little worried that maybe I may have too many peppers since it only called for one but it was actually perfect.  The only thing extra I had to put in to compensate was a little more tomato sauce.  It came out awesome!!  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent recipe!!  DH says the spices absolutely "exploded" in his mouth.  He just kept saying over and over how good this was.  The flavors meld together perfectly.  I think it will be even better tomorrow after it sets over night.  Super simple and quick to come together.  Had everything on hand.  Will probably add oysters and shrimp next time, as this is DH's favorite combination.  Thank you for sharing!!

Very easy to make, do not worry about not having the File Powder.  Be careful with the spice as it can get hot fast.  Easy to add, hard to remove.

Really enjoyed this recipe.  I didn't have the file powder and it tasted just fine.  My 3 and 7 year old children loved it, even had two helpings!!

Tasty! Used kielbasa & heaping measurments on the spices (except file powder, didn't have that). Will definately make this again.

This was a GREAT jambalaya.  I used brown rice instead of white, and you couldn't even tell ;)  Also, I didn't have any file powder, honestly, I didn't even know what it was!  I think I will definitely look to pick some up.  FYI Whole Foods sells a wonderful low fat andouille sausage.  Try this dish, you won't be disappointed.

We had a request from our dinner guests who are from Louisiana for some jambalaya and corn bread. They have been away from their family and home for over six months so I did my best to make something authentic tasting. I was shocked at how easy this was to make and my Southern guests ate so much of it that I was in shock! It tasted pretty good to me too but it was a little too spicy for my 6 year old and my 7 year old. I stuck to the recipe exactly except that I couldn't find the file powder and I had to double it. I made 12 servings for 4 adults and 4 children and there was none left!

This was really good and not too spicy. I didn't have the file powder and it didn't matter. I did add cooked shrimp at the end. Quick and easy.  My daughter ate it and said it was really good and my husband had 3 servings.

This recipe is excellent.  The seasoning itself is a little bland.  I probably tripled the amoung of cajun seasoning used and it was perfect!

This is a fantastic, idiot-proof recipe!  I'm sometimes a disaster in the kitchen, and this jambalaya turned out perfectly.  I added shrimp, but other than that, followed the recipe exactly.  Thanks, Terri, for the fantastic recipe!!

Try a converted (par-boiled) long grain rice.
Short or medium grain rice just will not work in jambalaya, it'll make it too gummy.

As for file', I use that only in gumbo that does not have okra in it.

Excellant recipe.  Couple of minor changes to try.  Used hot italian sausage & added a fresh red pepper.  Also did not cook rice in sauce, did not use file powder & added a tablespoon of powdered chicken broth to the sauce instead of the prepared chicken broth.

Took forever for all the liquid to absorb into the rice, so it ended up a little mushy. Next time I think I'll cook the rice separately. Either way, it tasted just GREAT, mushy or not! A keeper for sure!

It's important to specify that this is Creole jambalaya, not Cajun. Cajun cooking does not use tomatoes. Pretty good though.

Added shrimp for last 5 minutes of cooking. I usually increase the servings by 1.5 or 2 times. A real crowd pleaser.

Hubby decided he liked this one more than the "one in the box".  We did not add the hot sauce (that would have been too much for him).  I will decrease the salt next time (and there will be a next time)….personal preference.

I made this last night for myself and the wife. She said it was her new favorite...I've been stuffed up with a cold for over a week but I'll trust her! The only change I made was upon the suggestion of a friend who said corn starch can replace the file powder.

As expected, we'll both get lunch out of it too.

My secret was using Bomba rice (used in Paella) because it doesn't stick or have a creamy texture and it expands sideways instead of elongating. I mixed half water/chicken stock so it's lower sodium. Do not open the pot once the rice is cooking or you will have undercooked rice.

I didn't have creole seasoning or file powder so I mixed 1/3 paprika, 1/3 oregano/basil/pepper and 1/3 garlic/onion/thyme/cayenne pepper.

This was great! Not 100% New Orleans style but darn close and much easier than a complicated recipe . Omitted chicken and added shrimp in the last 7 minutes. It was very spicy, which I love, but some people may need to be aware of. Served with French bread and it really pulled everything together. Really really easy.

Delicious as is.  Added some frozen corn and XO sauce to the leftovers.  The XO sauce gives it a Smokey seafood flavor.

Loved it!  I made it as is, but simmered it longer as I do with most everything if I have the time.

I used cayenne instead of file powder, and kielbasa for the sausage. I also cooked the chicken and kielbasa in a separate pan with the vegetables sauteing at the same time in the Dutch oven. This worked really well for me. I also doubled the recipe. Family loved it, and I'm getting ready to make it again for a potluck!

I made it as follows with the exceptions of the file’ and worcherster sauce. I added shrimp as well and cooked the R.I. e separately in the chicken stock. Oh yes I used stock over broth.

Made this ... it was very good and surprisingly low in calories!! However ... that being said, it was a tad spicy/hot. When I make it again, I will make adjustments to bring down the heat.

It's hard for me to give anything 5 stars. This was definately something I'll make again. I will say that I doubled the recipe because of my family size. I also added shrimp to this as well. My rice cooked well and with no problems. I would like to say that while this was good that same day, the next day it was even better! This is a keeper for sure.

I have made this 3 times now and it has been consistently excellent each time.  I served it to guests and they all wanted the recipe.  I used andouille sausage for a more authentic flavor as suggested by the submitter.

What a treat!  Made two minor additions. First, doubled the tomatoes. Still used an Italian seasoned type. Second, after the rice was cooked, added a pound of fresh raw scrimp.  Cooked for about 5 more minutes. My wife is heat sensitive, so I didn’t kick it up. Lot of flavor as written, I’d say a 3 on a heat scale, with 10 being flames of ...  Great recipe. Just licked up the last of the leftovers and will be making it again soon.

Absolutely amazing! First time making jambalaya and even trying it, and it was super yummy! I couldn’t find file powder anywhere so I just went without and it was still super delicious! I didn’t get a picture because it was gone just as soon as it was ready!

this was too spicy for my tastes and many others, the andouille sausage itself is very spicy. Next time I will cut way back on the additional spices and let the sausage do the fire ( I always provide hot sauce to add for those who like it fiery!) the other flavors were divine! The other thing I will do different next time is make the rice separately. It made it so thick I had to add another quart of broth.  A real hit.

I had no issues with the rice cooking, but it was way too spicy. I used half the recommended red pepper flakes.  My wife who can handle spicier foods than I said it was way too spicy.  It may have been the Emeril's cajun seasoning I used.  I want to try again with shrimp and leave out the pepper sauce and red pepper flakes.

The BF loved this! I cut it to three servings because it was just for him. I had to change a little for what I had in the house and for taste preferences. So garlic sausage for the Andouille, shrimp for the chicken, red bell for the green, Fire Roasted tomatoes with garlic for Italian, finely minced fresh red jalapeno for the red pepper flakes. I did add T smoked paprika, 1/4 t cayenne, 1 1/2 t cumin and a couple of bay leaves because I figured I was missing something by substituting the sausage. I had to add okra ( for color because BF isn't a fan of green bell ) at the last and a bit more file. So spicy and good!!! Jalapeno corn bread to top it off! YUMMY!!!

This was very good! My first try at a jambalaya with a few adjustments. I lightly dusted the meat with Cajun spice, and just added the veggies to the meat after browning instead of doing them separately, and only browned in a bit of olive oil since it's what I had on hand. I sprinkled garlic powder on the veggies, let it cook together for a bit then added one can of tomato sauce, one can Rotel, basil, black pepper, salt, small dusting of pepper flakes, and another sprinkle of garlic powder while omitting the hot sauce. Used a mix of white and brown rice. And it turned out good! Next time I will add shrimp since this batch I am going to give to my brother as well who is allergic. Very tasty, definitely recommend!

Delicious!!  I used 12 oz Andouille sausage, 4 boneless, skinless chicken thighs, 28 oz can of San Marzano petite diced tomatoes, and added 2 lbs of shrimp in the last 7-10 minutes of cooking.  I stuck to the rest of the recipe except for going rather heavy on all of the herbs and spices, as we like spicy at my house.  It was so, so, good!!

This is amazing and the family loved it. I even made it for guest and other family members and received great reviews. 


A few things I do differently:

1. I cook the rice separate (not because it won’t cook correctly) as I like my jambalaya with a little more liquid.   

2. I increase the seasoning because I like it spicy. 

3.  I simmer this for hours to allow those flavors to blend. 

4. I leave in the refrigerator overnight then serve it the next day. This is another reason to not cook the rice with it. 

I found the extra flavor comes from the broth and really elevates this meal. It also makes it easier to reheat.

Super good! I live in AZ and wasn’t able to find filè powder so I just used a bit extra creole seasoning. I also used chicken thighs that I boiled in the chicken broth, then used the extra-rich broth in the recipe. It turned out amazing!

This was delicious!  I came close to making it the way the recipe said but only used sausage. Also, I don't like bell peppers but happened to have anaheims so substituted that. This was easy and truly delicious. Will definitely make again!

I make this recipe for Fat Tuesday and at least a couple other times a year. It’s relatively easy to make and tastes delicious. I add a few shrimp at the end when there’s about 5-10 minutes left of cooking time.

I subbed center cut pork chops for the chicken. I was out of celery so I added additional bell peppers and onions. My wife cans tomatoes in the summer so I used hers.  Better the second day.....

This does taste excellent and pretty authentic, unlike the store bough boxes.  I definitely put this in my recipe box.    Rice is tricky though.  If you are not familiar how to cook it, you may end up with overcooked or raw rice.  Remember to use a pot with thick gauge and a lid with a  good seal.  Also steam is what cooks rice so don't keep trying to man handle it and lifting the lid.  Stirring too much while cooking will also make it clumpy.    I would suggest if you are not familiar with rice start off with plain white rice with a little salt and olive oil so you don't loose a lot of ingredients while learning.

This is fab! I didnt have file powder so used a little flour and added a bit of "Slap Yo Momma" seasoning. I'll make this again and again! If I find file powder I will try that too.

I added a jalapeño, shrimp, and bay leaves.  It turned out amazing and with the perfect heat for me.  I do like this more on the spicy side.

Excellent recipe, however I would cook the rice separately and just add it in step three as the recipe states. If you're afraid of the rice being bland, don't be afraid to add seasoning to the rice while it cooks.

Very good and easy. Couple of changes based on what I had. No file because didn’t have so I used ground bay leaf. I used a can of diced tomatoes. I made with chicken and kielbasa no shrimp although next time will add shrimp and get andouille. Already had kielbasa in fridge. Used uncle bens rice! The best rice and all I will use as a southerner. My ratio was 1.5 cups rice and 3 cups broth. The jambalaya came together perfectly rice was spot on. Used a cast iron Dutch oven. I did add 1/4 tsp of cayenne and it was extremely spicy. Next time will leave it out. Thanks for the recipe

Everyone loves this dish, but I had to make a few changes. (1) I couldn't find file powder, so I left it out. (2) I added 1/2 lb of cleaned shrimp at the last few minutes. (3) I used 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes since that's what I had. (4) I used 4 cups of chicken stock to make it a bit looser in texture. Otherwise, it's perfect.

This is my go-to jambalaya recipe now.  I did substitute banana peppers for the green pepper (I know it's messing with tradition, but we like it better).  And I have found that using converted rice helps keep it from getting gummy.

A great tip if you are going to be serving this to guests:  Make everything ahead all the way up to stirring in the chicken broth and rice.  You can do this in the morning or a day or two ahead. Refrigerate right in your dutch oven or stock pot until just before the party.  This way you can clean up all the mess in your kitchen.  At supper time, just heat the prepared jambalaya, add the rice, and simmer.  Mix up a nice tossed salad and serve with a crusty French loaf. Happy guests, relaxed host/hostess. Win-win!

Best Jambalaya I have ever made myself. It rates up there with the best Jambalaya I have had in the past. Every review I read that says to cook the rice separately is cringe worthy and some what angering.  DON'T DO IT. You are ruining it. The rice is meant to boil with the sauce and absorb all the flavors. The recipe is very vague on how to simmer. They forgot to mention to simmer it covered and don't stir it much. I think that is the key is covering it and don't stir it a lot. I stirred the rice in and then one more time during the simmer process and it turned out perfectly. And where on earth do you get file powder? Does not exist in northern states. Can probably get some on Amazon. Mine seemed fine without it. Actually it was amazing. Next time I'm going to go with dark meat chicken instead of white meat. Chicken breast meat is dry and tends to dry the dish out more than I like. Oh and I'm going to go on my soap box again. Use only andouille. Don't use whatever you have cuz it's in the fridge. Make a point to go and get andouille. You wont be disappointed trust me. Italian sausage? YUCK! Maybe kielbasa but nope.

So the rice turned out kind of crunchy and we tried to add more broth to help it cook but it ended up not working. Didn’t add filé because we couldn’t find it. We added shrimp and a jalapeño which was nice. Pretty good recipe, thank you

Add-1/8 extra cup of rice.
Add 1 can of condensed cream of celery.
Add one can of French onion soup. 
Make the onion and pepper large.
Add 2 tablespoons of Cajun powder.
Follow the instruction provided with this in addition to that of above.  Keep in mind this is a much hotter recipe with II tablespoon of cajun spice.  If you like just a little extra bite.  If  not taken it away.

delicious!  We used leftover ham from thanksgiving in addition to the chicken, and used brown rice (needed an extra cup of broth and had to simmer for about an hour).  Even my 11 year old had seconds!

I don’t know what I did wrong. I followed directions to the T but I could not get the rice to cook all the way. I cooked it for over an hour and I still could not get the rice to fully cook. What did I do wrong?! But the flavors were amazing if only I could get the rice to fully cook.

I’ve made this with andouille and with locally sourced (hot) smoked sausage. I’ve also subbed boneless thighs. Comes out great every time even for family members who (supposedly) don’t like spicy food. Very versatile recipe.

Really good! We didn't have any of the file powder so didn't use it, and only needed about half the recommended amount of oil. Other than that I made this exactly as the recipe called for.  I will definitely make this again.

Added a small amount of seafood also seasoned with Cajun Spice Mix (the Allrecipes.com version by Diamond Lil) so mine is a tiny bit spicier, but otherwise followed recipe exactly. Great outcome! great heat, great flavor.

My new go to jambalaya! Spicy enough to clear your sinuses but not so much that it’s unbearable. I used Slap Your Mama Cajun (you can buy it on amazon) 1/2 hot and 1/2 normal. Hot sauce I used Franks and I did 1tsp. Everything else I kept the same.

This was so so delicious! We omitted the bell pepper since we just aren't bell pepper fans, as well as the hot sauce since my husband is the only one in our family who isn't a wimp:). Used canola oil instead of peanut oil since that's what we had, but otherwise stuck to the recipe. It's safe to say that even if you prefer to make it milder than the recipe as written, you'll still end up with a delicious, flavorful jambalaya. Definitely will make this again! Thank you for the recipe Terri!

I felt like it needs some dried thyme and bay leaf. I’ll try to make it again and add those. I guess I didn’t know not to open the lid and stir the rice cause my rice never fully cooked even though I did extra time. I did use a 28oz can of crushed tomatoes instead of the recipe like people suggested.

I've made this several times and it's ALWAYS a huge hit. The only modifications I made are to use heaping tbsp and tsp of the seasonings, and I use Italian stewed tomatoes finely chopped. I've run this as a special at work, and 20 lbs of it sells out. Even Louisiana natives tell me it's as close to home as they've ever had. Bravo on the recipe.

This was delicious, great flavors. I will definitely make it again, it was a hit in my house. If you have kids that don’t like spicy, I would do less of the pepper flakes.

Made exactly as written(as everyone should do the first time if they plan on writing s review). Absolutely no reason to make any changes. This was wonderful. Will put into the rotation. Just make sure you like spicy which luckily my entire family does:-)

The only change I made was to cover the pot after adding the rice.   You can make your own file powder by taking leaves from a sassafrass tree, baking at lowest temp for one hour, then crushing the leaves.     Wonderful recipe!

I used boil in bag rice and measured it out, due to the fact a lot said the rice didn't get done. I also used a lid for the rice for 20 minutes, then fried it for five without the lid to get rid of any extra water.  It is pretty hot. Next time I'm going to back off, not eliminate on some of the heat...meaning spicy heat.

I really like most of this recipe but found I needed a few small tweaks. Instead of using file powder I went with okra instead. I also adjusted the spices and added more than the recipe calls for because I was tasting it, it seemed to lack enough bite for me taste. I also used roasted tomatoes that I roasted myself and threw in some baby spinach as well. Overall pretty good but with a few tweaks I think the recipe becomes a 5. I also took a longer time to cook it so the flavours had more time to develop.

Made this last night and it turned out awesome.  This was my first time ever making Jambalaya and I received full approval.  Even my 12 year old son loved it.  I was concerned about it being too hot for him so I omitted the hot sauce. It was still spicy but didn't stop anyone from seconds. I made a couple changes:
 I didn't have File powder. 
I used olive oil since that was all I had.  
I omitted the chicken (tired of chicken)
I added 1lb of shrimp. After the rice was completely cooked, I mixed in the shrimp and let it sit for about 5 minutes before serving and the shrimp turned out amazing!!!  
I try to keep meals simple on weeknights due to work, kids, school, sports etc. but I found that this was pretty easy.  So happy I tried it, I will definitely be making this often!  Thanks so much for the wonderful recipe!!!

This was an excellent base to start from. I used a can of fire roasted tomatoes instead of italian style, cooked the veggies in an impromptu cajun spice mix (1 tsp each of onion powder, garlic power, cayenne powder, seasoning salt, dried oregano, dried parsley), and subbed shrimp for chicken (added before the stock and rice.

Followed the recipe & it was quite good. I do have one caveat...This feeds 6 people only if we're talking about NFL linemen, otherwise it's good for 8-10 servings.

AWESOME!  Second time making.  However, first time the rice was a little crunchy, so second time I made with 28 oz of crushed tomatoes and 4 cups of stock and 1 lb of uncooked shrimp.  Very good!

This is an excellent recipe. My wife is allergic to green bell pepper so I substitute poblano pepper which works great. I also often put raw shrimp in for the last 10 mins of cooking rather than use chicken.

I am literally making it as we speak, waiting for the rice to fully cook. I did a taste test and it is delicious! I can’t help but pat myself on the back lol! I used butter since I don’t have peanut oil and added shrimp but everything else I followed as written. Fantastic! Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe. It’s definitely a keeper!

This was amazing! Please do not cook the rice separately, if you just let it sit and do not keep stirring it like another user said it will absolutely absorb the liquid and not be crunchy. Also - I added about a pound of peeled uncooked shrimp after the mixture simmered for 20 minutes and let it cook for another 10, absolutely perfect! I did not use file powder but instead through in a few bay leaves. I will definitely be making this again!!

I’ve made this recipe twice now because I love the varied ingredients and it has just the right amount of spice. I didn’t have the andouille sausage so I substituted with Toulouse instead and did without the filé powder because I couldn’t find it in the grocery store. It was excellent even with the slight modifications. I will definitely be making this again!

My family loved this recipe and I will make it again. It was very easy to make. However, I did cook the rice separately because it does not freeze well with the rice mixed in. I put cooked rice in bowls and added in the Jambalaya on top.

This was a relatively simple recipe, which I like because I don't cook very often. I cooked the rice separately instead of with all of the other stuff, which I would personally recommend.

Would give this many more stars if I could.  Made it exactly as the recipe stated.  It was especially delicious and flavorful.  Everyone loved it and couldn't get enough.   Can't give it enough raves.

This was delicious, it had such a great flavor- I will definitely make again.  I made it for dinner for my husband and I,  I am a vegetarian so I added the meats last after I took my portion. Very yummy even without meat.  My question is what is the serving size for nutritional info?

I made this for my dispatch partners and my police officers. They all loved it! Many had never had jambalaya before. I followed the recipe except for the very end. I made rice in a rice cooker and added it towards the end then let it simmer for 15 minutes. I also cooked some shrimp the same way as the sausage and chicken then added it when the jambalaya was ready to be served. Also for anyone not near NOLA, I ordered a container of file powder from amazon for about $8. Since I’m in the eastern US I can make my own come summer. Sassafras is very abundant here.

Absolutely loved this recipe!  I did change a few things.  I added 1-1/2 cups brown rice and 32 oz of chicken stock instead of water.  It was incredibly filling and healthy!

This Jambalaya is scrumptious.  Photo # 12 looked like our dish. All broth type recipes are usually tweaked to ones taste.  Directions are easy to follow.  Buy all ingredients, chop a bit, follow recipe and you will enjoy.

I have made this recipe twice. I used a 14 oz package of Hillshire Farm's polska keilbasa, and 3 single servings of costco's individually wrapped chicken breast (cut to 1 inch pieces),   the rice didn't cook within the 25 minutes and I had to add at least another cup of chicken stock.  The flavor was perfect and the family loved it!  It fed a family of 4 with a small amount left over.
Great recipe! I have added this recipe to my cookbook and will definitely make again but will increase chicken stock.

This is a good one. I followed the recipe exactly but needed more stock for the rice to complete. Definitely making again and it's perfect as a leftover.

Fantastic recipe! I've made this a few dozen times now. Fun and easy to make. Everyone else who has had it has also raved about it. The only thing I usually do different is add shrimp, throwing it in the last five minutes or so since it cooks fast.

this was very good.  i had no trouble with the rice cooking as i added a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes as another reviewer suggested.  No file powder, and i used a package of bbq shrimp seasoning that i purchased in NOLA.  came out perfect.   i also added shrimp at the end.  makes a ton so it will serve a crowd if needed.  thanks for the recipe Terri!

Delicious and great consistency (not too watery). The rice continues to cook in residual heat even after you stop simmering. I suggest turning heat off when rice is still slightly firm so it does get too mushy.

Fantastic recipe. I made this for my daughter's birthday. She requested. It isn't something I've made before so I looked up the recipe on-line. I work full time so I had my other daughter start on instruction #1 to save time. The only difference in our version was that by accident she made the rice ahead of time in a separate pot. I took over when I got home, put everything together and just added the cooked rice. It was some kind of wonderful! It now takes it's rightful place in my top 10 recipes.

I found this recipe when I was trying make supper with what I had on hand. Used to use Zattarans but not any more. This recipe is just as easy and even better than the boxed stuff. It is very spicy to me but I can't quit eating it!  So good!

I have a jambalaya recipe that I thought was the best until I tried this! It was easy to make and the spices tasted great. We don't like things too hot so I did not add the hot sauce, and I used sweet Italian sausage because that is what I had. I did not have file powder so I left it out and also threw in a pound of sliced okra. It is delicious, and is my new favorite recipe. After adding the rice and bringing the mixture to a boil, it is best to turn the heat down to low so the rice can cook slowly. This will prevent burning on the bottom. I also stirred the dish twice to redistribute the rice during the cooking time.

I honestly am not that big a fan of this dish from what I had tried before at other get-togethers. But I needed something to serve at a small gathering of friends  and I knew they loved  Cajun food. Did not make it exactly as instructed. I used boned chicken thighs and added shrimp at the end. I had no Cajun seasoning so I made up my own. No celery so I used lovage . No file powder so I added a pinch of sage instead. 
Otherwise, I followed the instructions and it came out surprisingly good ( as I said I was not a fan but this I liked). Everyone loved it and said it was great Jambalaya.  Thanks so much for the recipe and procedure. Very good directions and I did not mess up at all.

Great recipe.  I didn't change much to it but I did add some dried shrimp instead of file because I think it adds a good Cajun flavor to it. Additionally, used canola oil instead of peanut oil.  I also got a 1/2 pound of jumbo shrimp and cut them up into small pieces and added them at the very end.  I also cooked the rice separately in a rice cooker.  

The family loved it.   Caught the wife sneaking a bowl of it at 2:00 in the morning.  LOL.

This was really tasty! The rice does not cook fully in the time they state on the recipe, but if you just cook it for an additional 15 min then the rice comes out perfect!

Sooooo good. I am pretty disabled when it comes to the kitchen so I follow recipes precisely. This came out amazing! So delicious. It pretty spicy, but it should be seeing it's Jambalaya.

Easy recipe, fantastic flavor! I used brown rice instead of white rice, so the cooking time was off a little, but I knew that going in.

I will make this again!

I was worried about how the rice would turn out, but it cooked fine together. The people who are having trouble with the rice not cooking may just need to buy different rice.

Easy to make.  Prep took a little longer than estimated.  Suggest using boneless, skinless thighs instead of breasts as the breasts were a little dry.  Will do again. Good luck finding file powder!

My family and I really liked this.  I did cut back on the hot spices because none of us care for heat.  This had plenty of flavor anyway. Also I used homemade andouille sausage. I am going to make it again this week.  Didn't have the file powder.

As someone who lived in Louisiana for many years, this recipe is the closest I've come to 'authentic' jambalaya, in that it's nice and thick.  The one caveat here is that you want to keep stirring it at low heat for longer than the 20-25 minutes, as it'll generally take longer than that to cook the rice.   Stir periodically during that 20-25 minute period to keep it from sticking or burning, then add a splash of chicken stock as needed to keep it from getting dry and to help the rice cook more consistently.  Another 15-20 minutes with some additional chicken stock and consistent stirring will do the job.

Very good! I only give it four stars because the seasonings are a bit over powering. Actually, they are a lot over powering and I love heavily seasoned foods. Go light on the seasonings and you might have something worth bragging about.

I've made this twice,  the first time with chicken and andouille sausage; the second with sausage and langoustine tails. I use my own homemade creole seasoning,  and usually a bit more than the recipe calls for.  Also,  my rice has taken more like 45 minutes to absorb all the liquid on both occasions.  Delicious dinner both times! Will definitely make again.

This was delicious and very easy!  I used polish sausage (because I had that) and threw in 1 pound of shrimp at the end. I didn't put in hot sauce or much red pepper as my Cajun seasoning is a bit spicy already.  I will make it again!,

Great dish! As others have mentioned, I too had to add a lot more (almost double) of the crushed tomatoes and chicken broth in order for the rice to fully cook. Will definitely be making this again.

Made this twice now. I cook the rice separate and add 1 cup of chix stock to this. Got to watch what Cajun seasoning you use and the heat, I use "Slap yo Mama" , just 1 teaspoon, sets your world on fire. I also added a nice pinch of dried oregano that helps deepen the flavor. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Used smoked turkey sausage instead of andouille because that's what I had on hand. Did not add file since I didn't have it. Stirred in @ a dozen raw shrimp right at the end of cooking.

Great!! Substituted and Used olive oil. Did hot links and chicken. Didn't have celery or bell peppers. Didn't do hot sauce or file powder. Will make again and do shrimp and sausage!  Great amount of heat! Rice didn't cook all the way after 25 minutes but we cooked it 10 min longer. Will cover with a lid when I simmer next time. Great way to use up sausages in the freezer !

This is a great recipe! I've made it a few times with a few adjustments. In my family we love spicy food so I use spicy Italian sausage and 2 table spoons of Cajun seasoning. I also add 1Tbs of hot sauce. The family absolutly loves it! My husband is constantly asking for it!

I have  made this several times. I add one pound of raw shrimp during the last ten minutes of cooking  and leave out the rice and chicken broth. I usually serve this with Jamaican red beans and rice instead and it is delicious!

Because we're in Louisiana and all the sausage around here adds plenty of its own spice, I didn't put in the black pepper or red pepper flakes. There was still plenty pf kick from the creole seasoning, and I always use Emeril's Essence recipe that I mix myself.

This turned out great. I used shrimp instead of chicken and okra to thicken it up. Additionally, I did not use the filé.

I made this for our worship team at church (30 servings) 
It was a hit!!  Only 2 teaspoons left in the crockpots if you scraped the sides!  One of the musicians asked if I was from LA as he was from there.  I said no, but I am a fan of Allrecipes.com  :-)  He said it tasted like back home.
Thank you for the great recipe!

This was very tasty. I couldn't find andouille sausage so used chicken smoked sausage. Didn't have any file powder. Omitted the celery as we don't care for it. Will definitely make again.

My husband is also a New Orleans native. If he doesn't douse it in hot sauce and wants seconds I have done a good job. Thanks for the recipe!

Good recipe. I actually added 1/2 teaspoon of the File powder and let simmer for 25 minutes then added 1 more teaspoon of File powder and the hot sauce just before serving. Turned out very well. I also added 1 pound of 18-20 count shrimp.

I'm sure this was awesome as is but I would highly recommend adding  shrimp which gives another level of complex flavor (which I sautéed in a little bacon fat I just happened to have). Added it at the end of cooking time with about a cup of peas for color and a little crunch.  Wow! I also used smoked sausage cuz I don't like the other, too spicy for me.

My Boyfriend and I loved this dish it was very easy to make and had just the right amount of spice. The only thing I did different was use minute rice and it came out perfect. I will definitely make this again.

This was an expensive dish to make not to turn out. Extremely mushy.  Way too much rice  that quickly absorbed all the liquid. The spiciness is totally dependent on what brand of Cajun seasoning you use. Not all blends are created equally.  I prefer recipes that call for individual spices instead of blends. I should have known from the recipe photo that this was going to be a bland dish. The photo is not very appetizing. Oh well, you can't win them all.

I made this EXACTLY as shown with the exception of leaving out the file powder (couldn't find it at any local grocery stores).  I have to agree with the reviewer that stated that if your rice wasn't cooking all the way, it was user error.  I'm not sure how anyone could think that there isn't enough liquid here to cook rice as it clearly shows a 1:2 ratio of rice to water, which is the standard for cooking rice. Just let it simmer for 25 minutes and don't mess with it! I had no issues at all with having crunchy rice.  The end result was very delicious and I will definitely be making again! Can't wait for my husband to get home from work to try it!!

I wasn't very impressed with the overall taste and flavor. It got a lot of good reviews so I thought I would give it a shot. If I do make it again I will cook the rice separate so it doesn't soak all the flavor.

Excellent recipe.  I have tried another Jambalaya recipe on All Recipes and this one was far better.  Loved the flavours.  Just the right amount of spice.  Omitted the file powder and added some shrimp near the end.  Delicious!

I used premixed Cajun spice because we don't have all the others. I  used  1/2 tsp of liquid smoke in lieu of Worcestershire sauce and no celery. It was awesome and the family ate it up, even those who normally won't eat spicy food.

I made this Jambalaya for our friend's anniversary bonfire party. Followed the instructions except for three things. I added a red bell pepper. I used vegetable oil, and no file powder. I also doubled the recipe. I filled an 8 quart dutch oven. Everyone loved it. I came home with an empty pot!

I made this as stated in the recipe, and it is delicious. The flavor is amazing. However, not being a Cajun, I will definitely ease up on the spice next time. Cutting everything hot by half will probably work.

So good! My only suggestion is to leave out the extra salt. Cajun seasoning is basically all salt, so I woke up at 3 a.m. dying for a glass of water. Other than that, no complaints :) I also substituted coconut oil for peanut oil and left out the File powder..

Changes made: safflower oil instead of peanut oil. Chicken thigh instead of breast, and Louisiana hot links instead of Andouile. 
Other than the slight changes I stuck to the recipe and it turned out awesome. Fantastic flavor, the hot links were just a touch too spicy IMO. Generally speaking I prefer to make things on the milder side and let my guests add heat as they see fit. Next time I think I'll add shrimp towards the end, use chicken stock, and see if I can order some proper andouile. Buttered bread was the perfect accompaniment.

added shrimp, less salt than what was called for and couldn't find file powder for the life of me. so i used creole powder instead, also used a zataran  brown rice(Louisiana style) along side of the white rice as well. friend of mine who has been down south and has had the "real deal" said i nailed it and to never change the recipe from what I've done to it

This is one of my favorite things to make.  I use 3 stalks of celery instead of 2 and a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes instead of the smaller can.  When cooking the sausage I use a full tbsp of Louisiana brand Cajun seasoning and another full tbsp when I cook the chicken.  Serve it with a green salad and some crusty warm French bread (unless you are watching carbs like me, then skip the bread).  Makes a big pot.  Freezes well if you have leftovers.  Bon appetit!

Really good!  Used shrimp instead of sausage, omitted the celery (we're not fans of celery). Followed the rest of the recipe as written.  Very good spicy heat. Will surely make this again!

This is my go-to recipe when making Jambalaya (which is quite frequently).  Sometimes I follow the recipe to the letter, and sometimes I improvise - it always turns out superb regardless.  Two things I have done that give it a different (yet good) flavor are using bacon+drippings along with the chicken  and sausage, or using lard instead of oil (that is my favorite).  One can also add a little fresh thyme and/or bay leaf to liven it up a bit.  Either way, thanks for this recipe - I have made it at least 20 times in the past couple of years and it has never failed to impress all who have tried it.  For those reviewers who complain about mushy rice:  it is really not appropriate to give a low rating to a recipe because your rice cooking skills are lacking.  Do yourself a favor and practice on some simple rice dishes before giving this one a go.  When you give a low rating for a recipe because of what amounts to poor technique or lack of skill, you are possibly tainting other peoples’ view of a recipe because of something that simply has nothing to do with the recipe itself, but rather the cook.  In other words, keep your screw-ups to yourself.

Loved this recipe and so did my hubby!
I made a few changes to the recipe because we're not big on spice:
I used grapeseed oil instead of peanut (only because we didn't have peanut oil), I only put the Cajun seasoning on the chicken and not the sausages, I used a 28 oz can of crushed Italian tomatoes instead of 16 oz, I left out the red pepper flakes and the hot pepper sauce, and used 2 cups of rice and 3 cups of broth. 
I'll definitely be making it again. Great flavor without being too spicy.

Terrific recipe, my family loved it and my wife and kids all had seconds. I didn't have file powder so I simply used cornstarch to thicken. Used McCormicks Cajun spice but didn't use red pepper flakes. Also used 1 tsp of Frank's Hot Sauce. It provided just the right amount of kick. I put the basmati rice in with the rest as the recipe called for, and it all came out great.
Will make this again for sure!!

I am not a jambalaya expert but I really liked this recipe. The only thing I did different was using chicken thighs because I think they have more substance for recipes like this, cooking the rice separate, and letting it simmer for about an hour(only because I went for a walk). It was fantastic!

I love it.  It's a little on the spicy side for my wife, so keep that in mind.  I did it as written except used a little more sausage and a little less chicken.

I didn't have peanut oil, so I used olive oil.  That was the only change.  I fixed it for company and they loved it.  I will fix it again.

Made no changes, other than a little more of the spicy seasonings.   Please try.....it's wonderful.  Even better, taking leftovers to work the next day.  Co-workers came over to see what that fantastic aroma was.  Served with cornbread muffins & honey.....so delicious!  Thank you Terri.

My 7-year-old insisted on having a Fais do do when he saw one on television so I made this Jambalaya recipe and everyone loved it! I didn't add the red pepper flakes and only half of the hot pepper sauce since my children would be eating it. My husband, our children and our friends went wild over this recipe. I'll be making it regularly.

I substituted the chicken with cubed pork steak  and used mixed smoked sausage. I also dialed the heat back with 1/2 the red and black pepper.  'Red Ball' hot sauce and Tex Joy steak shake instead of Tabasco and Tony Chachere's. I followed the rest of the recipe to a "T". I cook for an older crowd and they all loved it. Now I can put it in the rotation.

Used turkey sausage, no file powder. Cooked the rice separate and added 1lb shrimp towards the end. Also added a 1tsp of chilli powder, 1/2tsp parsley, 1/2tsp thyme, I didn't use crushed Italian tomatoes but I added a bit of Italian spice as a cheat. And I also didn't use peanut oil I used olive oil. SOOOO good! Made this for my brother who was coming to visit because he loves jambalaya, success!

I followed the recipe exactly and loved the smell wafting throughout my kitchen.  My only issue is, as others have said, it was too spicy.  I could handle it, but my husband was not happy.  I loved the flavor, the texture of the rice was perfect and I will make it again, but perhaps without the red pepper flakes.

I've been using this site for awhile now and never once have I ever left a written review. But I love this recipe and have lost track of how many times I've made it. I felt like it deserved a positive review from me finally. 

The only changes I make to this, is I use an entire 28oz. can of crushed tomatoes, reduce the amount of rice to just 1 cup and let it simmer for 45 minutes. Twenty minutes just is enough to get all the veggies as tender as I like. I also add shrimp to it during the last five minutes of cooking.

It was a BIG HIT!!!   Only change I made was no file powder, because I couldn't find it in my local supermarket.  My kids said it was just as good as what they had in New Orleans.

I have made this 3 times already and it is on the menu for tomorrow too..... Only changes I've made is omitting the file powder (we don't have it here in PA- and it's fine without it) and I cook the rice in a rice cooker in the broth and add it at the end. I also use chicken andouille sausage from Costco. Delicious!

This is my absolute go to recipe if my parents are coming over. My husband and son LOVE this dish. Portions are perfect,  spice level is perfect,  seasoning is perfect. I don't change a thing. It is also easy enough to make of you're not a big cooker. I make it about once a month. That's how much we love it!  Only thing is I cook the rice separate. It always seems to be crunchy if I cook it in the jambalaya.

I used this recipe as an intro to jambalaya and so far it has done well. I got an idea of what ingredients I will usually have and what I would need to make a more authentic jambalaya. Of course feel free to make changes.  Shredded beef tacos, fish tacos with cabbage, or chicken soft tacos are still called tacos right? So I made some Panamanian Jambalaya. No sausage, just chicken. No Cajun seasoning so I used cumin instead. My mom says cumin IS Panamanian food. No crushed tomatoes. small can of tomato paste instead. After browning and removing the chicken and before adding all the vegetables I add tomato paste and olive oil (not peanut). You kind of fry the paste in oil and start to brown it. It really changes the flavor. Then proceed with the vegetable and follow the rest of the recipe. I think the cook time should be longer because the rice wasn't done after 25 minutes. This or my burner was just too hot even at low.

Wife loved it! Didn't have access to the sausage or the file powder. Ended up usin extra Cajun spice, jalapeño sausage and a little extra hot sauce instead. Used a larger can of diced tomatoes and it turned out perfect.

This is a great recipe for Jambalaya! The first time I made it I followed recipe spot on. I found the chicken to be a bit dry in it so now I omit it, and double the shrimp. It is also very good leftover.

I have made this dish many times. It is very easy to make. I use Muir Glen brand crushed fire roasted tomatoes instead of Italian tomatoes. They do give it a bit of a different taste, but the fire roasting adds an interesting flavor to the dish. Like one other reviewer, I add a pound of shrimp in the last 7 minutes of cooking.

Once I made a very close variation of this recipe for a group of Hurricane Katrina refugees who were staying at my church. in Austin, TX. We took it to a Saturday evening meal along with fresh cornbread. My two sons and I made enough of this to feed about 30 people. I was a bit nervous that it wouldn't be like they were used to in New Orleans. We came home with an empty stock pot. They loved it!

I absolutely loved this recipe! Loved IT! This was my first time trying this recipe so I followed it exactly. It came out perfectly. It reminded me of New Orleans. I even loved the smells while it was cooking. Don't pre-cook the rice. Seriously, you loose that authentic aspect. Also, I couldn't find File! I ended up buying it on-line. I am so glad that I did. There is just a depth of inter-mingled flavors that tickle and arouse the taste-buds. Seriously Killer!

I used ham chunks, because I don't like andouille sausage. I made the chicken stock from smoked chicken carcass. Added shrimp. It was a huge hit!

Great recipe! I didn't use File powder because I didn't have it, but I don't think it made too big of a difference. Also I added bacon and extra andouille to give it more of the salty meats. I would definitely recommend this! Just be aware that it does take a long time to prepare (over an hour for me).

I've made this twice and each time the liquid absorbs before the rice cooks so I wind up adding another cup of broth and lengthening the simmer time. Otherwise this recipe is fabulous..I add okra and shrimp to mine but that's just preference.

As another poster said, if you're making the rice separately, you're not making jambalaya but instead you're making chicken and sausage creole.  

This recipe is classic jambalaya which means the rice is cooked with the other ingredients in order to absorb the flavors. Always a hit in my house.

Best jambalaya ever and super easy. One thing the instructions don't tell you to do is that when you add the rice and broth you need to bring it to boil, then PUT A LID ON THE POT and reduce to simmer. This way your rice will cook.

when the rice is cooking keep the lid on -this will help cook the rice - I did have to cook it 15 minutes longer than the recipe suggested to cook the rice but everyone's stove is different. Good flavor  but very tomato-y. I used the real deal Italian crushed tomatoes from Italy - probably why :)

Loved this but I added another can of tomatoes, and another 1/2 cup of broth then cooked it with the rice for 35 minutes to get the rice soft. Didn't have file powder so used corn starch instead. Used smoked sausage and it added great smoky flavor. Added 1 lb of cooked shrimp bc I like shrimp. Very spicy and great consistency. It made a huge amount. Could serve 12-16 people.

I used this recipe as my first try at Jambalaya, and even though it's a bit labor-intensive, it's so worth it! I never knew what file powder was so I didn't use it and I also had to use more tomatoes. Just throw the whole 28oz can in there. We are veg heads so I also like to throw in carrots, red peppers, or any other veggie I have around to bulk the health value up a bit too!

I'm not sure what happened . I used my le creuset Dutch oven and followed the directions to a T. The rice was either mushy OR hard. It also lacked the depth in flavor I was expecting. I will not make this again.

Followed recipe exactly except I used smoked sausage because I couldn't find andouille.  I got one half of a serving and the rest disappeared when i answered natures call.  Now i'm making more, with the help of a bunch of friends. this time I'm putting in some ham and shrimp.

I have made this Jambalaya for my friends at Deer Camp for the last four years. They all love it and keep asking me to bring it back. I plan to make it again this year. 

The only changes I made was to add some more sausage  so I had the same amounts for the chicken and sausage, and added some additional tomatoes.

Great recipe!

I accidentally posted the recipe before I was done. I used kielbasa, skipped the file powder since I couldn't find any at my grocery store, used parboiled rice (it prevented the mushy rice problem) and added shrimp during the last 5 minutes of cooking. I didn't add any salt, since the Cajun spice (made using Emeril Lagasse's recipe) already had salt. Excellent recipe!

Made it for the first time last weekend at my daughters house and I plan on making it again very soon. Was the best I'v ever had. I doubled the recipe to be able to feed everyone and so they would have left overs. I also added shrimp. Everyone just loved it and there wasn't much leftovers. The only thing I would do differently is if you have young children, cut back on the hot spices.

I didn't add the file powder or the celery, and it was amazing. The flavor was nice and spicy and my husband just loved this.

Replaced the seasoning with chilli powder and smoked paprika. I used a can of spicy red pepper tomatoes. Gave it the perfect zip.

I will make it again. I left out an ingredient but it was still pretty good. Next time I will be making a few changes. But had to try it straight up as I could the initial time.

This is an extremely easy and good recipe. I love spice, but was afraid of the quantities listed so I cut it in half. Don't. It needs the full amount listed. I used a local homemade sausage (two kinds, jappy and chili), and it was wonderful. I also used a 28-oz can of crushed tomatoes, and it was perfect. I tend to like dishes like these heavy on the tomato. And of course, I added shrimp at the end. This is a wonderful dish.

I think cooking the rice separately, maybe in chicken broth, would be better for anyone who is a novice like me. Really good though!

It was clean out the fridge day at my house tonight, and this fit the bill perfectly!  I used two chicken breasts, a pack of raw fennel and pancetta sausage, onion, garlic, sweet peppers, a can of whole tomatoes, a can of kidney beans, a couple splashes of soy sauce, vegetable broth and just under a tablespoon of cajun seasoning.  That's it!  I am  sure it wasn't authentic but it was delicious! This is a great recipe that is forgiving and very easy to adapt to what you have on hand!

I tried this recipe last year.  My family begs me for it all the time.  I add more hot sauce than what it calls for and occasionally add Slap Ya Mama seasoning when we want it extra spicy.  They LOVE it!  Also, I use the rice that you boil in the bag and cook it first then add it at as I get ready to serve it.  Turns out amazing every time!!!  :)

I make this after we get a rotisserie chicken.  We eat all the white meat separately and then I pull all the dark meat off the chicken, remove the skin, chop it up and freeze it for later.  I use Adelle's Andoullie. Brown rice doesn't get cooked.  Maybe in the future, I'll cook the brown rice separate and add it, but I like white basmati rice and push the broth up to 3 full cups. Cajun cuisine is the best.

Great recipe as written. The second time I doubled the tomatoes just as a personal preference.  For those "purists" who say no tomatoes in jambalaya, that is a basic difference between Cajun and Creole style cooking; Creole uses tomatoes, Cajun not so.  And finally, for those who complain about crunchy rice, switch to parboiled whenever you are cooking rice in a dish rather than separately.  It makes all the difference in the world.

Fabulous! Didn't have file on hand, so after removing the meats and before adding the vegetables, I took a few minutes to add flour to the oil in the pot and cook up a quick roux, then proceeded with the recipe as written, except for adding a handful of raw shrimp with the rice. I did have to add extra liquid and cook it longer so the rice would cook all the way through. In the end, it was delicious and the right consistency. Cleared out my sinuses too, so the spice level was right on!

Didn't have andouille so used shrimp - didn't have celery on hand so left that out. Used 2 cans diced tomato instead of crushed. Didn't have gumbo seasoning but used tony chachere seasoning instead which made it spicy. Overall- took longer to reduce. Spicy but yummy!

This was the first time I've cooked this recipe and it was amazing!! I would definately cook it again, but maybe add shrimp.  My 3 year old son gave a helping hand by assisting with the stirring duties.  He then helped with a taste test, it wasn't super spicy, which was great!  Thanks for this recipe!!!!

I made a vegan version using Tofurky's andouille sausage.  I also added roasted corn on the cob (4) cut into about two-inch long wheels to replace the chicken.  Vegetable broth instead of chicken broth. Okra was not to be found this week so subbed fresh green beans.  It was SO delicious!  The seasoning of this recipe was perfect.  Just spicy enough without overshadowing all the yummy flavors.  I used Korean garlic sriracha-style chili sauce for the hot pepper sauce and it worked well. Also subbed corn starch for file powder since I didn't have any on hand.  I will definitely be making this again!

Threw in shrimp and used some chipotle Tabasco and 1/4 teaspoon of paprika for an extra kick and it turned out amazing. Great dish to bring for a potluck.

Mmmmmm, this was really good! I didn't have file powder, I'm not sure it would be readily available way up here in Canada. I was out of celery and I used chorizo, chicken, ham and shrimp with a 28 ounce can if diced tomatoes. I cooked the rice separately also due to texture preference. I didn't add the red pepper flakes because it smelled spicy while it was cooking and I was worried it would be too spicy for the kids. I tasted it before adding shrimp at the end and it was rich and delicious. Spooning the jambalaya over the rice mellowed the flavour so perhaps it wouldn't have been too spicy with the red pepper flakes after all but it was still so delicious. I will most definitely be making this again!

Like others, we added some shrimp, skipped the file and added a bit more tomato. Because we like the hotter, the better, my son chopped up 2 scotch bonnet peppers with the bell pepper. This was one of my favorite dishes he has made for me yet!

Great recipe!  I get a little nervous when I see crushed red pepper and hot sauce.  This recipe has just the right amount of kick but still has several other flavors bursting out.  I make it with diced tomatoes instead of crushed but I make no other changes.  Okay, one other change, jasmine rice because thats all I keep on hand.  Next time, I will try some shrimp.

We love Jambalaya and this was pretty good. I added extra heat by adding sambal olek and we always have hot sauce on the table for those who like it even spicier! The great thing a about this recipe is that if you like more veg you can add it! Will definitely make this again!

Jambalaya Haiku: "Dis is smokin' great. I only made two changes, very slight, all good!" No file powder (have always been told that it's something you sprinkle on at serving; otherwise, it can just settle in a hot pot and become stringy), and I cooked the rice separately so that we didn't have to worry about possible smooshy, or crunchy, rice, and we just spooned into our jambalaya how much we wanted. Really amazing and can't wait to fix again!

Fantastic! This was by far the best Jambalaya recipe. Followed this recipe exactly as it states with the exception of the file powder, didn't have any on hand and I used olive oil in place of the peanut oil. When added the rice I cooked it low and slow and added more chicken broth as needed. Delish!!

I've made this multiple times without the file powder and Worcestershire sauce and it comes out great! I also add some jalapeños and get the crushed tomatoes with green chilies added.

Super yummy, but the rice did not cook all the way. I left the lid on the entire time. Next time I will cook the rice separately in chicken stock and incorporate it when it's finished.

I made this for the first time ever also adding a 28oz can of crushe'd tomatoes but followed everything else to a tee. The whole family enjoyed this and wanted more. This makes a lot for generous portions. Yum I will be making this again.

I added shrimp and used diced tomatoes with garlic instead of crushed tomatoes. It was very spicy so I served it with a side of sweet cornbread.

This is great for serving a crowd. You can adjust the menu for as many as you like.  If you are like me and cook for a large group it is great. The wonderful thing about this website is the ability to adjust the number of servings. Its worth a million to me.

This is a great recipe. I didn't buy the sausage I had bratwurst already so I just use them. I couldn't find file powder so I didn't use any. It came out really good but I was expecting more flavor. I found file powder on amazon so I'm going to make this recipe again but to the "T".

oh my...this is wonderful. I tried to do 'as is' and did except I didn't have enough celery. I was doubling the recipe for company and only had 2 stalks (needed 4). So I used celery flakes for the rest of the celery. (1 tbsp celery flakes = 1 stalk celery, so says the 'net). I also kept the broth and rice separate because we never eat it all. I figure I can freeze the leftover sauce, making fresh rice for it at another meal. I served this to 7 guests today. I had few leftovers even after the doubling of the recipe. Great recipe!

I made this recipe and it was the bomb! I used brown rice instead to make it bit more healthy and I did not see that onions were in the recipe and put them in anyway but looking at it now I see that an onion was definitely required also used red and green bell peppers. My only issue which was my fault is that I used ;s what I had on hand had everything except white rice.  Had Uncle Ben's instant brown rice which made the rice too soft.  I just bought regular brown rice so that I can make it again.  My friend and her two sons came by and ate plates full and my husband took leftovers to work my trainer said he liked it as well and if i thought there was a problem to please bring him my next batch that was supposed to be better than the one that I cooked the first time. Oh I must add that I used Knorrs chicken bouillon to make my chicken broth which made my flavor for my sauce even better because I make the broth to my taste that is really good.

Great recipe! I mixed this recipe with one I saw on foodwishes.com. The only difference that I made was I added 2 green onions, mushrooms, green beens and okra. Instead of the peanut oil I used olive oil and it was great! Loved this Jambalaya recipe.

Very easy to make and very good! The prep is what takes the most time.  Excellent for an easy dinner, with a small salad and some French bread.  I followed the recipe exactly and the amount of "heat" was perfect.  The only thing I didn't have (and couldn't find in my local store) was the file powder.  Will have to search for this online but my husband and I liked it just fine. Even some for leftovers, which he really enjoyed!

Very good!  Easy to make and a big hit with my family.  I used saved bacon grease to sauté veggies, garlic, and smoked sausage.  For convenience I used some deboned rotisserie chicken instead of cooking my own.  Didn't use file or pepper sauce (didn't have either).  At the suggestion of others' comments I did add basil, oregano, and thyme to taste. Kept adding extra broth so the dish would have a  stew like consistency and the rice could cook completely.  Keep watching the last 10 minutes of the rice cooking and stir occasionally to keep from sticking and drying into a sticky blob.  A thickener such as cornstarch or file isn't necessary if you cook the rice in the dish and not separately.  I served this with hot buttermilk cornbread.  I will definitely make again.

I didn't have file powder and didn't add the red pepper flakes and hot sauce... because I have small children and it was still plenty spicy but I did add extra celery and a pound of shrimp. Made sure I had a nice tight fitting lid and cooked on lowest burner setting and no problem with crunchy rice. Super Yum! Will def make again!!!

One of the top 2 recipes I have gotten from this site!  I made it exactly as written with the exception of using smoked sausage for the andouille (personal preference) and used no file powder.  Make it TODAY!!  Awesome jambalaya!

It was great! I had to use a red onion instead but it tasted fine and I left out the celery because not a big fan of it but it was great. It makes a lot though so for a small family I'm gonna have leftovers for a while but that's fine. Very filling and very good.

I make this all the time. The family LOVES it. I do add shrimp, but only because the kids get very upset if I don't. It really is perfect without it. I use rotisserie chicken in place of the chicken breast because it's easier on weeknights. Also, for special occasions I substitute alligator sausage for the andouille. YUM!

This was really good. I didn't get a chance to take a picture of it because we ate it so fast. I didn't have andouille sausage so I used turkey, and also , I pureed all the veggies with a cup of broth (may family does not like veggies)...and I also used mild rotel tomatoes instead of adding salt, pepper, hot sauce, or red pepper flakes. Came out very tasty. I picked out all the jalepenos before pureeing, but it was still too spicy for my littlest one. next time I will not add any heat at all and have hot sauce on the table for personal preference.

Very good! I was looking for away to use up some stuff in the freezer so I used smoked sausage, a mix of chicken thighs and breasts and shrimp.  Left out the hot sauce because of the kids :(. But it was still very good :). We will be having this again

I tried this last night and my husband and I LOVED it! We are huge on spicy food and let me tell you, this was SPICY! I omitted the file powder because I did not have any, but it really didn't need it. The liquid will thicken on it's own after 20-25 minutes with the rice. I also added shrimp for the last 5-10 minutes, and it was perfect! Will definitely make this again!

Amazing! My family is STILL raving about it. Even my little sister, who is picky, thinks this jambalaya is amazing. I added shrimp since that's my favorite part of other jambalayas I've had in the past. After sauteing the chicken and andouille sausage I sauteed the shrimp in the olive oil and Cajun seasoning as well and set it aside, adding it back in 5 minutes before the jambalaya was done. I was worried about rice being fully cooked because of previous reviews so I used Minute brown rice and let it simmer until done, which took maybe 12-15 minutes (I added a little extra rice to sop up some of the extra liquid since I did not have file powder to use as a thickening agent). Absolutely amazing recipe and definitely going into our regular rotation.

I made this recipe for the second time, I omitted the file powder and cooked 1 cup of white rice and added it after the canned tomatoes. The texture seemed to come out better and I added 1 tbs of butter to the rice to give it a nice buttery flavor.

I'll make this again, just a little differently :)

Excellent jambalaya. I couldn't find the file powder but since I have no idea what it is, it wasn't missed at all.

Wow!  This was soooooo yummy and easy to prepare.  I made it the first time for a small dinner party and it was a hit.  The little bit of leftovers the next day heated up nicely and tasted terrific.  You cannot not go wrong with this recipe!

This was super delicious! Even my super picky boyfriend liked it!  I did not use the file powder, but just cooked it a little longer and it was not runny. I also used the whole can of crushed tomatoes.  I will make this again. Wonderful!

I've always been a Zataran's fan (boxed meals, shameful, I know, but that's what you eat when you're in college) but I really wanted to try making this on my own. This is a great recipe! I've made it a few times, now, and haven't even thought of the boxed stuff since (sorry, Zataran's. We had our time. And it was a good time. But I've moved on.)! Definitely COOK THE RICE SEPARATELY (I use the chicken broth in the rice). For one, it keeps the sausage from getting rubbery (I use kielbasa). Secondly, it keeps it all from getting too mushy. Also, I've never used file powder, but it still turns out delicious!

I had to double this for my large family, which was easy to do. I couldn't find file powder, so that is the only ingredient missing. I did add shrimp in the last 10 minutes of cooking. Turned out great. Every one loved it!!!  Will definitely make it again.

This was simple amazing .  No I do  not come from Louisana.  I am not an expert.  I came across a really good andouille a while back pulled a link from the freezer.  There was some file in the pantry and I made the Cajun spice from about.com from the other spices in my pantry (Penzy's is like a candy store to me).   This had a real depth of flavor, some heat ... Just enough.  I did add some chopped shrimps at the end.   I also cut the recipe for two and found I needed to add some water a couple of times which extended the cooking time.   Not a fault of the recipe.. I can cook a great pot of fluffy rice in 20 minutes or a smooth creamy rissoto in 35.   I have never mastered the  art of cooking rice with other ingredients like this recipe.  Someday I will.  But this was really really yummy.

I do love this recipe -- I serve the rice separate.  But none of the recipes I read have okra as an ingredient.  To me, you HAVE to add okra -- that is the only change I made!  Thanks for a great recipe!

The first time I made this recipe the rice was too mushy, after adjusting the liquid to rice ratio (basically the same ratio I use for all my Puertorican rice dishes) it was 100 percent better. Didn't use the file powder, instead I used 50/50 (whole tomato and tomato puree), to keep the salt content low, and added shrimp at the last 5 minutes of cooking (to prevent the shrimp from being rubbery). I had great reviews from people except from the wife (she doesn't care for shellfish). The second time I made it, without the shrimp, the wife loved it. I say be creative and add a little fish sauce for those who don't like shrimp or seafood. (The third time I made this dish poured a little fish sauce and the wife didn't notice the difference) This is an awesome dish and well worth the time making it!

this is great.  I added some cayene pepper for some extra heat and sub'ed the salt for celery salt.  I cooked the rice seperate with tomatoes and black beans.  I added shrimp at the last few minutes of cooking the meat and veggie mix.  I also didn't bother with the file powder.  This is a keeper for sure!!!

My boyfriend loves cajun cooking. I surprised him with this recipe one day and he said it was the best jambalaya he's ever had. I did tweak the recipe a bit. I only used the andouille to lighten it up a bit. I also used canned tomato sauce instead of crushed tomatoes because I don't like chunk of tomatoes. Also, I had great results sautéing the sausage in a bit of hot sauce.

I made this for my daughter's 2nd birthday today and everyone loved it. Just enough spice to keep the southerners happy and not completely burn out the rest. Great creole flavor and didn't take as long as expected. It was a bit jucier than what I'm used to, but I found some ways to getting around that. Thanks for the submission.

Thanks Terri for a great recipe.  Very tasty and just the right amount of spice.  You can always add some hot sauce at the table.  Used canola oil instead of peanut oil, but that didn't change anything.  Thanks again.

Easy & Delicious! My first attempt was a success. I even found a recipe for making cajun spice by another contributor, so I didn't have to go to the store. I substituted pulled pork for the chicken and added it when you add the cooked chicken. It was fantastic and smelled so good. 
Nice to have had everything already on hand (including spices)... Thank you Terri for sharing!

This recipe was great!  I am from Lousisiana but live in Oregon and it was very authentic.  I had friends over for dinner and everyone was oohing and ahhing over it!  I couldn't find peanut oil so I used pure sesame oil and also I couldn't find the file powder.  I followed everything else and it was absolutely amazing!  Loved it and definately will be making it again!  Thanks!

My husband and I love this recipe!  I didn't use the file powder but it was thick enough without it.  Also, I've used both olive oil and peanut oil and both worked.  Great recipe! Thanks!

This was fantastic! I didn't bother with the file, and next time I'll use a little bit less chicken broth (rice was a little mushy for my taste), but the flavors were spot on.

Cooked, using basmati rice (just what I happened to have on-hand. Didn't have bell pepper available, but overall, very good.  It was a hit among my guests.

good basic recipe to follow...just add or substitue what have you.  I used half a pound of shrimp and3 andouille sausages and about a half cup of l/o chikn..da said it was authentic new orleans flavor.  I used the herbs in a cajun mix and the andouille made it work.  could've been a litlle juicier

Made this for the first time tonight and it turned out pretty good.  When I was buying the ingredients, the grocer who is experienced with Cajun cuisine showed me where to find the file powder, but it intended to be use with dishes like gumbo, so he recommended I skip it. He also recommended that I use plain crushed tomato and build up the flavor with the seasonings.  I did as requested and am happy with the end result.  I chose this dish to make as my final project for cooking class.  I didn't have to time to make it class, but that is okay because I made it for my hubby.  YUM!!

Great recipe. Simple enough to follow. I added more spices because I like the kick. Made it for guests and they enjoyed it. I used shrimp and sausage in mine instead of the chicken breast. I could not find file powder so I brought Cajun seasoning and used that instead.

I really liked this recipe but found it just a bit too salty.  I'll probably cut back next time, and maybe swap a little chicken for some shrimp.

I tried this recipe, but of course altered it to my ingredients. I put it all in a crock pot for a few hours after frying most of the ingredients. I used the seasonings suggested, or dry powders, and a few that were suggested by previous users... This turned out Sooo Yummy! I will be making this again! And again.  ( I only rated at 4 stars due to my own inability to follow the recipe to a T. I have no doubt it truley deserves 5 stars!)

I lived in LA for five years and ate the "real thing" made by real Cajuns plenty while I was there.  I have made Jambalaya from several different recipes, and this is probably the closest to what I tasted out in LA. I think that aside from the flavor of the andouille sausage,  the four ingredients that contribute the most to the authentic taste of this recipe are the Worcestershire, the hot pepper sauce, the file powder, and REAL garlic- fresh through a press.   We enjoyed this a lot.

Probably the best left-over food ever. I made it the other day, and have been taking it to work for lunch; it's excellent for that.  When making it: I didn't use a dutch oven, just a regular pan; I think that was fine, it didn't change much. In an attempt to make it peanut-allergy friendly, I just used olive oil; not the oil I would have chosen, but it was around, and the spices are so strong it barely matters. Didn't use cajun seasoning because my audience dislikes it; without it, the balance of flavors still worked really nicely. Vegetable/meat/rice balance was excellent (I typically have that complaint with food like this; proportions were good). I used a 1/4 cup more rice because there was a lot of liquid; turned out fine.   Overall, I'll definitely be making this again. I really like it.

it's not my grandmother's but it is great.  For those who like drier rice I find that with dish where you cook the rice in the broth and vegetables you should add a cup of rice for every cup of broth or other liquid you add.  Plus, you must add an additional cup to absorb the liquid from the meat and vegetables and stir the rice in thoroughly.  After doing this my dish came out perfectly.

This is delicious. I made this with beef Kielbasa, used Old Bay seasoning instead of creole and did not use file because I didn't have any. I also added shrimp at the end and kept it warm in the crockpot after it was done. A keeper for sure!!!!

Great base for a recipe.  I say that, because there were a lot of things I substituted.  I used vegetable oil instead of peanut oil.  I used 1.25lbs of Spicy Turkey Sausage as my meat.  No celery.  Two 15oz. cans of diced tomatoes (drained half the juice) instead of Italian Crushed.  I did not use hot pepper sauce or file powder.  I did, however, add a 1/4 tsp. Cayenne and a bay leaf.  Came out awesome with just the right spice (some of which I attribute to the sausage).

My first attempt at making jambalaya and it was delicious! Simple, straight forward recipe that can be adjusted to your family's taste and what you have on hand. I didn't use the file powder, cooked my rice separately, used kielbasa instead of andouille, added shrimp the last 10 minutes and put a bottle of hot sauce on the table for those who wanted the extra heat.  Thanks for a great recipe! Will certainly be making again.

My husband said "in 50 years, that is the best Jambalaya I've ever had." I just laughed, because other reviews have said the same thing. I made it exactly like the recipe. VERY spicy, and we like spicy. It was a little too spicy for me but clearly not for my hubby. Great recipe.

Oh, how my family loves this one!  I have used several different kinds of sausage (chicken andouille is great and less greasy than pork; even regular smoked sausage makes a tasty dish)  I use a combination of 1-1/2 tsp Creole seasoning and 1-1/2 tsp Old Bay seasoning and have never used file powder.  I usually go a little lighter on the red pepper flakes and hot pepper sauce since my husband isn't a big fan of too much spice -- I let the kids add extra Tabasco to their own servings.

Like others I changed this around to suit what I had on hand so I did not use the file powder or hot pepper sauce. I also increased the garlic and used poblano and cayenne peppers instead of bell peppers.  All that being said we liked it , even the first time when I forgot the tomatoes it was still very tasty. The second time I made it I also added a small bag of frozen salad shrimp (and the tomatoes) and it was just as good. I'd say this is a keeper.

Since there are only two of us, I make the rice separate and add the shrimp a little at a time.  I use more tomatoes and season the rice water with a couple tbs. of the sauce.  This is a great recipe and I often cook enough to give some to my grown kids who are properly appreciative, lol.

I made this for my husband and my sister-in-law the other day and it was a HIT!  I think we ate the WHOLE pot just the 3 of us and it was alot of FOOD. I justed dark meat chicken instead of white meat b/c it wa a bit more tender, and it came out YUMMY. THANKS

I really enjoyed this recipe but did make a couple of modifications based on my pantry ingredients.  I used jasmine rice instead because jasmine rice is more flavorful than ordinary white rice.  I also substituted a spicy beef sausage since I can't find andouille sausage.  But the results still came out great.

I made this recipe for a mardi gras party I threw and got nothing but rave reviews from my guests!  I added shrimp to the recipe and reduced the spices slightly.  I have made it before for my family with the full arsenal of spices, but I thought it might be a bit too spicy for those who like their food a bit tamer!

I made this in celebration of Fat Tuesday, and it didn't disappoint! I made the following adjustments: used Italian diced tomatoes (14.5 oz can) instead of crushed, omitted the file powder (didn't feel like buying it), added 2 small cans of baby shrimp, used brown rice instead of white, and added more red pepper (I love heat). Everyone who ate this raved about it, so I'll definitely be making it again. Best of all, I had a lot of the ingredients on hand, so it was both cheap AND delicious - can't beat that combination!

I have made this several times and it is quite tasty. Crushed Italian Tomatos are the hardest ingedient to find. Don't forget the file powder. If you do is does not thicken up.

I made this last night and used olive oil in place of the peanut oil. Also, I used boneless chicken thighs in place of boneless chicken breast. Lastly, I added a can of red beans (drained). My significant other thought it was good, but a bit too spicy. Next time, I will use only 1/4 tsp.of the red pepper flakes and hot pepper sauce. I will definitely make this again-it goes great with garlicky greens!!

This recipe is amazing!!! We love cajun food since our trip to New Orleans this summer and this is a fantastic Jambalaya recipe. I seasoned the chicken with cayenne pepper for extra spice and used 3 stalks of celery and half a red pepper and added okra as well. We had it over brown rice and it was exceptional! Thanks for a great recipe!

I had to search for Andouille sausage but it was worth the effort (I really believe the flavor is better for this dish than other sausages). My family really loves spicy food, and I found it could use alittle more kick,so I added another tsp of both red pepper flakes and hot pepper sauce at the end. My husband and my father went nuts over it, and my husband looked forward to the leftovers. I did find File powder in the gourmet section of the store. Will be making this many times over so it's worth having all ingredients on hand!

Now this is what I'm talkin' about!!  I printed out this recipe about 3 years ago, but never made it.  Then a few months ago I made the mistake of trying a different Jambalaya recipe on here (Man Pleasin' Jambalaya).  That was a complete let down.  It was basically chicken and rice.  This is the good stuff!  If you like flavor, spice, and the real deal, try this recipe!
The only thing I did differently was that I used venison sausage, and at the end I had to add a little bit more chicken broth and let it simmer a little longer so that the rice wasn't crunchy.  The rest of the recipe I followed completely.  Both my husband and my 5 year old ate it up.  This will go in my favorites!!

This is a wonderful recipe. I did however find it a bit spicy for my taste and I am cajun. I will cook this again for sure, but not add as much pepper seasoning. Thank you for the recipe! Very Tasty!

This recipe was very tasty!  We do love our food extra spicy so we added some additional spice.  We used olive oil and didnt bother with the file powder and it was still VERY GOOD!!!  We also added some ketchup for some extra sweetness and it actually added that extra kick!  VERY GOOD!!!  A family favorite forsure!

I had some sausage, chicken and peppers that I needed to use up, so I did an ingredient search and found this.  I'm happy I did because this jambalaya is fantastic!  I followed the recipe exactly (minus the file powder) and the flavors blended perfectly.  I think the only chance I will make next time is follow the advice of several people and make the rice seperate and maybe add some shrimp.

Thought this was a great recipe.  I did however make a few changes. I added 1 tsp sugar, 1/2 tsp thyme, 1/2 pound cubed ham, 1 can French Onion soup,a 28 oz. can of tomatoes instead of the 16 oz. can, and right before the end put in 10 oz. shrimp.  I also garnished it before I served it with fresh parsley and chopped green onions.

I made this vegetarian by subbing veggie stock for chicken and using boca products for the meat, and it was soooooo good!  What a nice change in pace.  This will definately make it in the rotation!

It was okay, no one thought it was excellent. The dish was fair. Not alot of flavor. Didnt real taste or look like real Jambalaya to us.

We ate this as the main course of a Mardi Gras murder mystery party and it was awesome - so authentic and exotic for us. I also omitted the file powder, and hot sauce and just added a little extra cajun seasoning.  I also had to cover the rice to get it done, and thus cooked it longer.  Excellent with garlic bread and blackened chicken salad!

My son gave this 5 stars as I made this upon request, scaling the recipe down to one serving (which really made enough for 2).  I had everything on hand except the andouille, but I had hot Italian sausage in the freezer, so I used that instead.  Also omitted the file powder as it was thick enough after the addition of the rice.  The spice was right on for my son, but could easily be increased for those who need an extra kick.  Thanks for an easy weeknight meal!

Although I modified this recipe quite a bit it was still successful, easy, and best of all delicious!  I steamed and shredded the chicken the day before and just added it in with the sausage in step 2.  I was out of Cajun seasoning and used the same amount of Creole seasoning instead and all the other reviewers that said the file powder wasn't necessary were right.  I didn't use it and didn't need it...the consistency was perfect.  A definate keeper!

Very good!  This was my first time eating the andouille sausage...wasn't impressed with its flavor, but the dish itself was awesome!

It was great.  We didn't have file powder so I just added more cajun seasonings.  I also added shrimp and it was yummy with the chicken and sausage.

this was really good but i would cook the rice separately next time, as it took more time to cook & the rice ended up a little mushy cuz i had to keep adding more chicken broth. i also added cooked shrimp toward the end. i would add more hot stuff too.

We loved it!  So easy.  I took the advice of the others & cooked the rice seperately...worked out well.  We like spicy food, so I added about 3 times the amount of red pepper as the recipe called for.

This is really good.  I added smoked sasauge which gave it a nice flavor.  It was really thick so I served the rice on the side instead of cooking it all together.  Add as much spice as you need, I made it really spicy.

I substituted some Turkey Kielbasa for the Andouille sausage, used vegetable oil, and didn't have the file powder. A pretty standard Jambalaya.  A little spicy, but quite good.

Pretty good jambalaya. I've tried this recipe a couple of times and it has turned out well. Be careful not to overcook the sausage or chicken in step 1. I tried to freeze some for lunches, but the rice became mushy on re-heating (maybe that's common with rice?) Might be good with shrimp as well.
