Fist I'd like to ask how can someone rate this recipe and then say "I haven't tried this recipe yet"??? Is it just me or does this person have it all wrong?Very easy and very good delicious recipe. I did add some things like chopped onion, minced garlic, chopped green bell peppers, fresh ground pepper. mushrooms would be good too but I didn't because of child issues. I also put in extra sauce and served over linguini pasta. I also simmered longer than the 10 minutes requested. I just wanted to make sure the chicken was cooked well. And simmering it like this of course it is very tender no matter how long you cook it.I used chicken thighes instead of breasts because that's all I had on hand! Because I served over pasta I added the mozzarella after it was put over the pasta. Don't forget the garlic or cheese bread and salad. Enjoy! I know we did. Can't wait for feftovers for lunch today.

easy and turned out great.  I used italian bread crumbs on the outside instead of plain chicken and that worked well.  I also used more sauce than called for and served the chicken over spaghetti noodles.

Great for a quick and easy meal.  I baked my chicken breasts instead of frying them to cut back on the fat.

This was a pretty carefree dish to make... which is just my style when I have realized that I haven't planned dinner and we are pressed for time! Ooops!  I pounded the chicken breasts to tenderize and make cooking quicker, then sprinkled Italian seasoning and granulated garlic on either side and let that sit while I heated the pan.  I also decided to use a touch of olive oil to brown the chicken rather than cooking spray... I used the jar of sauce I had on hand... and then of course the cheeses.  It was very tasty and I will make it again when pressed for time, but not quite like the breaded parm we are accustomed to. Great for a busy night...when you don't want to deal with all the regular steps in standard chicken parm.  Good recipe!

I have issues with reviewers on this site-it's no secret. Yes you cannot review a recipe before making it. Rate it as written and either suggest changes or write a different recipe! This recipe is basic and just OK as written but thats what we should rate and review. My family likes this recipe, if I add all kinds of different ingredients they might not.

I am giving this four stars mainly because it was simple and easy to make.  There are better chicken parmesan recipes out there, but this one is pretty good for how few ingredients it has.

I took others' suggestions and 1) increased the sauce to about 21 oz.  2) added oregano, garlic, and italian seasoning to the sauce about 12 hours before cooking the dish.
I will make this again just because it is so simple.

Excellent - everyone loved this recipe!!!  I sauteed with garlic like many suggested, added just the right bit of spice.  The only thing I would suggest is to make sure you put some of the sauce on the noodles.

I had Kroger brand traditional spagetti sauce on hand and used that for the sauce. I flattened four chicken breast and then dipped them in egg/milk mixture. Then layered them with Italian style bread crumbs. After that they went into some olive oil to fry. I put all four once cooked through in two cups of the sauce and put mozz cheese on top with a little parmesian/ covered and let cook for about ten minutes. The additional sauce was used with cooked spagetti noodles and then served up with the chicken parmesan on top. Delicious!!!

This turned out pretty well!  My boyfriend is a cheese fanatic, so I put quite a bit of extra cheese in it and then I added some large elbow macaroni noodles to it as well. (:  It was excellent!

I came across this today and gave it a try.  It was a last minute, "man what do I do with that chicken I have for dinner tonight?"  I used the sauce I had in the fridge, and only had Cheddar cheese, and used it over linguini noodles - but it still worked out very well in a pinch.  My two year old ate it up nicely which is all that matters to me these days.  I am adding this one to my list of dinners I can do real quick.

A super easy take on a classic. I cut each breast in half and pounded it slightly for more tender pieces.  If you do this the browning takes less time.  I also added a few tbsp of olive oil when I browned and found there really wasn't anything to drain.  I do trim the breasts of any fat first so that helps. I placed the cooked breasts and sauce in a covered glass dish so all I had to do was put the cheese on top, cover it and let it sit for five minutes and the cheese melted very nicely.  I will definitely make this again.

Chicken Parmesan was okay. I added granulated and garlic salt (just  because I love garlic) to chicken while cooking so it can a little bit of flavor. Other than that it was quick and easy.

This recipe is great! I personally recommend switching the mozzarella with provolone, though.
I also breaded my chicken using just normal bread crumbs. It was a great recipe and my family loved it.

I am only giving this recipe 1 star becuase 0 is not an option. I did not like this recipe at all. The chicken and the tomato from the sauce did not go together well. The chicken was underdone to my taste, VERY juicy. I will not make this recipe again.

I did a slight variation of this recipe.  I dredged the chicken cutlets in flour seasoned with salt, pepper, and garlic powder prior to cooking.  And I didn't stir the parmesan into the sauce but sprinkled it over the top towards the end of cooking.  A quick, easy, but still pretty tasty dinner.

I'm giving this four stars for the convience and ease of prep. It was kind of lacking in flavor, but I'm sure that can easily be fixed by taking the time to add some more herbs and spices. Overall though it was good. The chicken stayed very juicy too.

I needed a quick recipe, so used this one, but was skeptical because it looked bland. So I sauteed minced garlic in the olive oil and then browned the chicken in that. I didn't have Italian sauce, so I used the meat Prego sauce I had, and put in double the amount since I have a large, sauce-loving family. Also misread the directions and thought it said to put in a half cup of Parmesan cheese. So glad I did! It was delicious with the extra cheese.  The entire meal was a hit. It's the first meal in a long time where the dinner table, with all six of my kids, was quiet--because everyone was busy eating. Will definitely make this again with my modifications.

This was the first time I'd ever tried to make chicken parmesan, and I loved this recipe. Simple, and it turned out really well! Took me more like 45 minutes than 25 though; the chicken simply took longer to cook, but that may have been the size of the chicken breasts I used. I also made my own sauce rather than using Prego (basic canned tomato sauce plus Italian seasoning, minced garlic and a little onion powder and let it simmer for a while before starting the chicken). I served it over penne for lunch and it was so good I am now craving the leftovers! :)

My family really liked this recipe. It was quite easy to fix. I did doctor up the spaghetti sauce with Italian seasoning and garlic powder because I was worried about the sauce not having enough flavor. Also I  poured the sauce over the noodles and it was enough but I just prefer my noodles to be a little "saucier" so I would add more sauce next time but my husband said that he liked it just the way it was. Overall it passed the test of being easy and flavorful and I will fix this again.

Easy recipe, minimal mess.  I cut the chicken in to small pieces and breaded it before browning and to cook it faster.  I'm sure it adds calories, but also is crunchier and soaks up the sauce- yum.  Not a fancy dish, but quick recipe with minimal ingredients- will probably make this fairly often (serving over spaghetti of course).

fantastic one pan dish. gotta use whole chicken breasts, cutlets do not do this dish justice. i use half a jar of sauce with the chicken parm and the other half to complement half a box of pasta as a side dish. i really enjoyed this dish, great for a quick meal. oh, and you don't have to make 6 breasts, i made only 3 last night, cut the largest one in half across and it came out so good. some Cabernet accompanies nicely.

This recipe was really easy and tasted great!  My husband and I loved it. Neither of us really like fried food so this was perfect.  He asked me if I would make it again and since I'm just learning how to cook that was awesome. I would recommend this recipe to people just looking how to cook as it was easy to make & tasted great.
