This is a wonderful recipe for those who like candy making but not with all the fuss. I've made it for 20 years-tried snipped, dried cherries, toffee bits or crushed candy canes for the nuts...tried orange, peppermint or coffee extract instead of vanilla... You really can't go wrong!

I really like these condensed milk recipes because EVERYONE gets a container of cookies and candy from me during the holidays.  I want to share what I have done with these fudges.  I add 1/2 of a 7 ounce container of marshmallow creme.  If you try it, you will never use the original recipe again.

I've been making a virtually identical fudge for several years now, with fat-free condensed milk instead of full strength.  My guinea pigs- ahem, friends and family- actually like the reduced fat version better, since it's not so rich as to prevent you eating a second piece!  I like to use Ghirardelli chocolate chips for extra yummy chocolate flavor.  Also, I pour the fudge into a loaf pan; this makes the fudge block a bit easier to handle and takes up less fridge space.  Be warned, once you make this fudge for Christmas, everyone and their cousin is going to want a batch!

I've been making this fudge with my mom since I can remember!  We microwave the chocolate though, it makes it even faster.  (Medium heat, 60-70% for about 3.5 minutes)

This is the best tasting and easiest recipe for fudge that I have ever made. I have altered the recipe for mint fudge and amaretto fudge and it turned out wonderfully. My friends can't wait for the Christmas fudge I make for them.

Excellent recipe.  I used 2 cups of semi-sweet chocolate chips, and one cup of milk chocolate chips and it turned out excellent. Rich, creamy and sweet.

So easy to make and very tasty.  My family loved it.  We had some other fudge from friends and family given to us for Christmas.  The other fudges didn't even compare.  This recipe is not too rich, where I have tasted others that taste like you are eating a bag of sugar.

Very easy and very good dark tasting fudge.  I made two batches, one following recipe and one following a reviewer who added marshmallow creme.  Both we good but I preferred the original.  It was creamier and more dense.  The marshmallow creme gives you a fluffier, less traditional fudge.

This fudge is good for how quick it is. The consistency is good and the addition options limited only to your creativity. The next time I make it, and I will make it again, I think I will spray the pan as well as the inside of the wax paper. I had a very difficult time getting the fudge out and had to tear the paper off the fudge.

This fudge is so easy and it only takes about 10 minutes, start to finish. It is very rich, so one batch cut into very small squares is plenty for the holiday season.

Great, yummy, delicious!!!!  This was so easy to make and everyone raved about the creamy texture and perfect taste (not too sweet).  I split the chips: 1/2 semisweet and 1/2 milk chocolate.  I did not add nuts.  I will make again and again!

Definitely easy, but a little too dense and rich for my taste. Like condensed frosting. My husband loved it though and preferred it to other "fluffier" types of fudge.

Everyone who tasted this fudge over Christmas raved about it. It's softer than fudge I'm used to (it's best kept refrigerated), but it was wonderful. As a bonus, it was super easy to make. I used milk chocolate chips. Yum!

This was not only a quick and easy fudge recipe to make, it tasted great!  A chocolate-lovers dream!  I used 2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips and 1 cup milk chocolate which I thought was a good combination (not to rich or too sweet).  I omitted the nuts.  I also melted the chips in the microwave (2 min on high, stir, 1 addt'l min).  I will definitely make this again next year!

Sorry, I didn't like this at all.  It was too bitter, and not very creamy like good fudge should be.  It was easy enough, and maybe if you make it with at least 1/2 milk chocolate, but I found the taste terrible. There has got to be better recipes out there.

This fudge had a good taste and a great texture. It was not quite as good as a 
traditional cooked fudge, however, the ease in which it took to prepare, made
it so worth it. The only thing I can say bad about the texture, is after a couple of days (even being in a covered container) it started to dry out pretty fast. Only prepare what you are going to eat in a short period of time. Other than
that, this was a great treat, and it made
great gifts with the other candies we (my oldest Daughter Bonnie and her friend Jonie) made for the Christmas Holidays.

I took the advice posted and used half a jar of "Fluff" and milk chocolate chips with the semi-sweet. It turned out great! I didn't have wax paper so I used cling-wrap in my pan. Lifted right out with no sticking to the wrap. Fudge was thick and creamy.

I agree with some of the other reviews that this fudge isn't creamy enough and is a little bitter.  It did get pretty hard after refrigerating for a short time and remained that way even when I took it out.  I'm going to keep looking for a better recipe.

I had to make substitutions because of what I had on hand and personal preference. We used 1 1/2 cups of chocolate chips, 1/4 cup of cocoa and 3/4 cup of creamy peanut butter.  It had a perfect texture (not grainy at all) and was so very easy to make.  I have already made it twice this year, and this will be part of our holiday favorites for years to come!

Without a doubt, the best, most delicious, easy fudge recipe in the world!  Rich, creamy and decadent!  I've been having so much fun experimenting with all different flavors of chocolate chips.  Our latest favorite is butterscotch chips.  If you're a butterscotch junkie like me you'll love this!  Have fun throwing mini marshmallows and chopped nuts in as well.  Outstanding recipe!!!!

Good base recipe.  I had several partial bags of morsels that I combined to make the 3 cups (semi sweet, milk choc & peanut butter), UMMM UMMMM Good.

I made the marshmellow version.  I only had one bag of semisweet chocolate chips, which is not quite two cups.  So instead of using part of a can of eagle brand I added 4 heaping teaspoon fulls of cocoa.  I found it to be plenty sweet enough without the extra cup and a bit of chocolate chips but I still got all of the chocolate flavour by using cocoa.
It did firm up nicely even though I used cocoa.  
I still prefer real fudge made the hard way, but this definately a good quick version of the real thing that I can keep handy for those days when I need a chocolate fix fast!

This recipe was alright for a quick chocolate fix, it can be in the fridge in under 5 minutes.  I added mini marshmallows instead of nuts and when it was sliced it looks very pretty with the colorful marshmallows showing thru but I thought that snacking on the chocolate chips as I was making it tasted better than the finished product, a bit to sickly sweet, and I love chocolate!

This recipe is the best. Tastes most like traditional, homemade fudge---not too sweet. Can't fail. I coooked mine in the microwave, stirring often. Stop microwave before chips are totally melted and the final stirring will melt everything. You do not want it to come to a boil. Add the other ingredients after reomoving from heat. I used walnuts.

WOW!  So easy & tastes great.  This is the first time I have successfully made fudge, so I guess this recipe is a keeper!  I used 2c milk choc & 1c semi-sweet choc chips.  YUM!!

The easiest, fool-proof fudge I know.
My family loves this fudge with it's  creamy texture and rich flavor and I love it because it's so incredibly easy.
Make sure to cut small pieces though as it is very rich and filling.

I have not made good fudge in years. This is GREAT and the easiest ever.  My family loved it and had no idea how easy it was.  I gave this out packaged nicely for gifts this year...everyone like it.  EASY and DELICIOUS!

I have tried the fudge recipes with the candy therometer and it always turned out a rock - I call this recipe the fool proof fudge.  It turns out perfect everytime.  I tried it with white chips last year and it didn't get firm - I'll have to work with it some more.

I've never made fudge before, and this is super easy. I used a mix of Ghiradelli milk chocolate and semi-sweet chips, and I added chopped pecans and Heath bar (toffee) chips.  My husband said it tasted like fudge you'd get at a candy store.  It made a huge batch, too; I used a two quart dish, which I think was a good call.  It would have been too thick in a 9 inch pan.   I'm going to make this again for Christmas gifts and the peppermint and butterscotch variations for gifts.

Never made fudge before and it came out great!  I made the optional marshmallow kind, but I used some green/pink holiday marshmallows and tore them in half. Gave it some color :-)

I made this on Thanksgiving for my family and Christmas for my husband's. Huge hit both times. Probably the easiest fudge recipe out there. It's not quite boardwalk quality, but close enough.

Followed this recipe exactly with great results and many compliments! Making this recipe in an 8x8 pan makes for some THICK fudge; my 2 quart casserole dish was reasonable though. GREAT recipe!

Awesome. Love it!
So easy.
I didn't have enough chocolate chips on hand, so I halved the recipe. 
Then I used my cookie scoop and scooped it into cupcake liners for individual bites! 
I had whole pecans that I didn't feel like chopping, so instead of mixing them in, I put one on top of each li'l scoopful. :)

Way to easy! The Fudge set up so nicely and will make a great addition to any holiday cookie tray! I plan to serve this at an upcoming dinner we're hosting for my husband's work team.  P.S. I used dark chocolate chips with the walnuts and it is divine!

4 stars because it was very easy to make but I was not amazed by the taste! Left much to be desired. I will stick to my JetPuffed Marshmallow Cream recipe on the back of the jar. Yes, it takes more time but sooooo worth the taste!!

This fudge tastes great for how easy it is to make.  It literally took me 5 min to make this fudge!  It definitely is denser  than marshmallow creme fudge and is very rich.  I made a batch using store brand choc chips and a batch using Nestle chips.
The Nestle batch tasted much better.

I've been making this recipe for years, and everyone who has had it loved it!  It's very rich and creamy - moreso in my opinion than the boil-on-the-stove recipes I've tried (not to mention so much easier!).  I usually just keep it simple with chopped, toasted pecans, but tonight I stirred in chopped Heath bars along with the nuts - fabulous!  Saving some of the crushed candy to sprinkle on top made it really pretty.  Love the ease of prep, the versatility, and the fantastic results of this recipe.

I agree this is a great recipe - I also used the marshmellow creme and it made it very good(half a 7 oz. jar).  I used the press and seal film as a liner of the 9" square pan, sprayed it with Pam and it worked wonderfully!!  No sticking!!
