I took the advice from the first review and cooked the veggies a bit longer until they were the crispness I like. Then I substituted honey for the corn syrup and added 2 cloves of crushed garlic and 1 tsp of red pepper flakes to the sauce. Amazingly good! The cashews add that extra-special touch. Served it over brown rice with whole steamed broccoli on the side. I'd make this dish for company.

The dish was bland, too orangey and sweet, 3 minutes of stir frying wasnt enough, yes very easy to make but at the end I felt sorry for all the ingredients I wasted on this dish, it was gross.

My husband and I both agreed that this was a 4 star recipe. We both enjoyed it and I thought it turned out great and it was really easy. I haven't tried a lot of stir fry's so this one was an easy one to start with. I did make a few changes. I used chicken instead of pork and extra virgin olive oil. I also cut out the corn syrup and used honey. I also used peanuts instead of cashews simply because I didn't have cashews. cashews would have been better but the peanuts worked great. I like my vegetables crunchy so I did the 3 min. on them. Overall I'll make this recipe again and I'll even make it for the in-laws when they come.
