I made this with a few changes. I did everything in one pot. A Dutch oven with lid by La Creuset. I cooked the meat in oil in it then added the wine and chicken broth. Used golden potatoes regular sized and cut in quarters. Put potatoes over the meat. Put the lid on and cooked in oven. Meantime made the sauce. I also made peas on the side. When done took meat and potatoes and put on platter. Then I took the  sauce and added it to the pot with all the meat juices. Cooked til done and poured that over the meat and potatoes!  Family loved it.

Very good recipe.  Didn't change anything other than using more of the oregano and garlic powder as prescribed amount was not enough to season even 8 thighs.

This is a bit of work... but worth it.

This was amazing and so easy to make after a long day at work. We were in the mood for potatoes so I used a cup or Arborio rice and increased the chicken stock and wine. 1/2 cup of each with the chicken and bake for the same time. Rice comes out super creamy.

The combination of flavors is perfect. I used half and half in place of whipping cream and the flavor was still delicious.

This recipe was amazing! I prefer mostly white meat so I used a whole chicken cut up. I just made sure to cook the breasts a bit longer in the pan. Then to keep the wings from burning I covered them partially with the potatoes!  Turned out great! The meat was juicy and very tender, and every bite was full of flavor!

I think this recipe is more dependent on using fresh, high quality ingredients. Next time I’ll use fresh peas and real lemon.

This is a super good recipe that was not that labor intensive.  I made a few changes, some out of necessity, using ingredients I had on hand.  I used white cooking wine and vegetable stock instead of chicken.  I used quartered russet potatoes instead of baby spuds.  I chopped a small onion and added it to the garlic; and forgot to make a roux before adding the wine and cream with the butter in the last sauce.  So I made a separate roux using bread flour and bacon grease, then added it to the saucepan.    I would not have changed anything if I'd had the right ingredients and had not forgotten a step in the sauce.  This is a truly versatile recipe that does not break the bank and it's a one pan plan.  Meat, potatoes and veggies all in the same recipe.  Hard to beat.

I used chicken thigh/leg quarters, used crushed red pepper in place of the black pepper, increased the baking time to 2 hours, halved two peruvian sweet onion and placed them on top of the potatoes at the 4 sides. I would change to either omit the lemon juice or make it the star of the sauce...as written, it just tastes "off". Otherwise, a tasty dish, and fairly easy to make.

I served this at a dinner party along with a porcini mushroom risotto, so I did not make this with potatoes in the pan.  Because of that there was a bit too much fat in the pan, but that just meant I had oil for a future batch of roasted potatoes.  The guests loved it.  I lived in Chicago for quite a while, and I had the original at Vesuvio.  This did not taste as good as the original, but it sure is good, perhaps better than my memory!

Whole family adored it. Made as directed except I squeezed the lemon over the chicken when I added the peas at the end of cooking time. Peas and squeeze! Will be on our frequent rotation. This dish made me look like a pro chef. Giggity!

we aren't fans of creamy sauce, so skipped the last part. Very nice recipe otherwise.

Awesome recipe didn't change anything, food was perfectly cooked and flavourful.  In the future I would add more peas just because there is enough sauce to handle it.

Delicious!  I tripled the oregano, garlic, salt, and pepper mixture.  I was afraid the oregano would be too strong in the dish, but it was so so good!  The potatoes were wonderfully creamy and the chicken cooked just right.

I used boneless skinless breast AND added some whole clove garlic. I adjusted my cook times accordingly. This cane out of the oven looking and smelling absolutely wonderful. It tasted as good as it looked. I did use my cast iron skillet, so I didn't have to dirty another pan + easy clean up. Took me probably 45 minutes feom start to oven. Then, because of the boneless/ skinless, about another 35 minutes to the table.

I had never even heard of this before and decided to try it. I followed directions exactly and my husband and I both enjoyed it. I honestly think it was delicious just with the sauce in the roasting pan. I will make it again.

This was a great technique to making this dish flavorful.  I made it as written but next time I will cut back just a bit on the wine as I thought it was a little overpowering. Although I did reduce the servings which changed amounts.  I will be making it again soon. Thank you.
