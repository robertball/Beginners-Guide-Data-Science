I made this for Christmas and my family loved it.  I used the baking instructions from the "Perfect Prime Rib" article found on this website.  I chose to sear the meat then do cook the meat at the low temperature for a long time.  It turned out great.  Here is the information:  

Time and Temperature
There are two ways you can roast it: 

At a low temperature for a long time, or
At a high temperature for a shorter time. 

Your roast will shrink less if you cook it low and slow, but you won't get the same flavorful, well-browned exterior that a high roasting temperature gives you. 

It's possible to combine the two methods by starting the roast at a high temperature to sear the outside of it, then turning down the oven after 30 to 45 minutes to finish the roasting. If roasting at 325 degrees F (165 degrees C), the meat will take about 17 to 20 minutes per pound. If you start the roast at 450 degrees F (235 degrees C) for the first 30 minutes and then reduce the temperature to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C), allow about 13 to 15 minutes per pound. 

The meat was tender and delicious.  Thanks!

I've never been so sure that a recipe deserved five stars.  This is the absolute perfect prime rib.  I followed the directions exactly, only adjusting the time spent baking at 325 for my 7 1/2 pound prime rib.  Because of the relatively low cooking temperature in the end, I waited until the roast temped at 135 before I pulled it out.  After resting 20 minutes it was a perfect 145.  I'm still reeling from how good this turned out... better than ANY restaurant I've had it at!  

P.S. I was worried that cooking at 500 was burning that yummy crust created by the garlic and thyme, but I kept faith and stuck with it and it turned out nice and crispy, not burned at all.

Wonderful! Even though I cooked a 4.5 lb roast, I made the amount of garlic mixture called for in the recipe, which covered the fat very generously and produced a delicious crust. One reviewer mentioned their garlic was bitter. I imagine that the high initial temperature of 500 degrees scorched the garlic. I seared my roast at 460 for 12 minutes, and then since the fat seemed like it was on the verge of smoking, I turned the oven down to 400 for the last 8 minutes. I then roasted at 350 degrees rather than the 325 in the recipe, until my meat thermometer read 130 degrees. It was juicy with beautiful pink color in the center. Thanks Chen!

who knew making prime rib could be so simple!  I have to say that this is the best piece of beef I have ever prepared.  The au jus was eloquent!  Just the right proportion of ingredients.  The combination of the thyme and garlic gives a lovely flavor to the meat.  Had a 4# piece, so halved the recipe for the marinade and it was spot on.  Used kosher salt and ground the paste with my mortar and pestal.  Scored the fat and placed the marinade on top pressing down on the marinade to soak into the cuts.  Marinated this morning and placed in fridge, took out 1 hour before making.  Thanks for the recommendations of turning down oven; did at 450 for the 20minutes then proceeded. I did add some beef broth to the bits at the bottom of the pan and it made a lovely thick, rich, dark au jus.  I would love to use this on other cuts of beef using the same method.  thanks so much!

My first prime rib, but not my last, I can't believe how easy this was, and so good. I made this for 8 adults and it got rave reviews, my husband said it was the best he ever had. I was so nervous, I've been known to overcook many a roast, but not this one, it melted in your mouth. The only changes I made were like some of the other reviewers stated and I browned it at 460 for 12 min. and then another 8 at 400, reduced it to 325 and cooked for 20 min per pound. I took it out when the temp registered 125 (was getting nervous), and let it sit out for 20 min. It was definatly a perfect rare in the center and med-rare on the ends. Terrific! The only change for me would be maybe take it out when temp reached 130, because I like more med-rare to med. But trust me no one complained, it was high 5's all around.

Very good!!  I personally think that an instant read digital thermometer is key to making a perfect prime rib.  I cooked a 5 pound prime rib and used the same amount of mixture ingredients as a 10 pound roast calls for.  I followed other reviews and cooked at 460 for 12 minutes, 400 for 8 minutes & 325 for the remainder.  I cooked it for 20-25 minutes a pound and took out of the oven when the internal temperature hit 125.  I covered it in aluminum foil and let sit for about 10-20 minutes, until the internal temperature was about 135.  It was a perfect medium rare.

I tried this recipe and it is awesome! I used a smaller cut of meat and adjusted the seasonings. Use an instant read thermometer and you cannot go wrong. I'm planning on using it again for our Christmas dinner. Thanks!

Excellent flavor and easy to do. (Though I'm always a wee bit nerveous when making Prime Rib.) I followed the other Reviewers suggestions and dropped the searing temp. to 460 degrees and increased the roasting time & temp: 15 minutes & 350, respectivly. **I cut the thyme to 1 teaspoon and added 1 teaspoon of dried rosemary. Use a meat thermometer and you really can't go wrong.  Came out fabulous! I'd do this again in a minute!

This was the absolute best Father's Day meal I have ever fixed my husband of 15 years.  After the smoke cleared out of the house (I gotta clean that oven!), it smelled like heaven in here!  The crust was perfection!  I was afraid the garlic and salt would make the drippings too strong to make a good gravy, but I was so, so, so wrong!  After using some of the goodies from the pan to make the Yorkshire pudding, I only had about 1/3 cup left.  I poured some cold canned beef broth into it, which was great because the change in temp made some of the fat coagulate so I could skim it off the top).  I then thickened it with some cornstarch and served the BEST beef gravy I have ever made.  Next time, I'll take the beef out at 130 so it is truly medium rare after the carryover cooking stops.  I'll also get a bigger roast as my first-grader declared it his favorite meat and has been gazing longingly at the leftovers that will be tonight's dinner.  Then again...maybe we'll have the beef for lunch and make Dad stop for a pizza on the way home.  Hmmm!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

Fairly standard roasting directions. Marinade nothing special. I'm curious as to what makes other reviewers believe this average "recipe" is 5-star caliber.

I had a 5 lb. rib roast and made half of the rub.  I put the roast in at 450 for 20 minutes then reduced to 325 for the remainder. (I thought 500 degrees might burn the garlic like some other reviewers mentioned and didn't want to take the chance.) I took the meat out at 135 degrees, it rested for exactly 15 minutes, and it was a perfect light shade of pink.  While the roast rested I made the following au jus:  I removed the fat from the pan and added 1 cup of beef stock and a 1/2 cup of cabernet sauvignon to the drippings, and gave a light sprinkle of dried thyme, dried rosemary, salt and pepper and reduced until it thickened up a bit.  Then I added 1 T of unsalted butter off the heat.  The roast was tender, juicy and just perfect.  Thanks, Chen!

I've done this with both a boneless and bone-in prime rib but both needed more cooking time than stated making dinner a little late but definitely worth waiting for.  I made the full amount of marinade mixture for my 5.25 lb. roast.  I cooked at 450 for 15 minutes to sear the outside, then lowered the temp to 325 for about 2 hrs. and 20 min. till it reached an internal temp of 140. I removed from the oven, covered it in foil and let sit for about 10 minutes. The slices on the outer edges were slightly pink and the slices towards the center were slightly more rare.  Other reviewers mentioned taking the roast out at 125 or 130 which I think is too early.  Cook time probably has to do with how cold the piece of meat is when it goes in the oven.  I had mine on the counter for 1 hour but it was still quite chilly.  I vow to get this in the oven earlier next time!  I made a very simple au jus to serve with the meat by pouring off all but about 1-2 Tbsp. of fat from the roasting pan and placing over heat.  I whisked in 3 cups beef broth and 1/4 cup red wine.  You may need to strain through a colander to remove the blackened pieces of garlic.  I also make a creamy horseradish by mixing sour cream with horseradish.  We made prime rib french dip sandwiches with the leftovers.  Spread the horseradish on the buns and serve with au jus.  So good!

These are fairly standard seasonings for a rib roast, unfortunately though, roasting this piece of meat at such a high temperature (500 degrees) will make the garlic bitter and ruin a very expensive cut.  Practice tells one to reduce the heat to 450 - 460 before putting the roast in.  Pull the roast at 125 degrees and tent with foil for 10 + minutes which will allow the roast to continue to cook and the juices to absorb.  It should settle at 135 degrees for a perfect medium rare!!!  Good with changes....

AMAZING!!! AMAZING!!

Prime rib has always been my favorite cut of meat and my grandmother would make it for me on special occasions. And although I couldn't contact my grandmother for her recipe and cooking tips, I decided to rely on this recipe and hope for the best. 

The results were OMG! I followed everyone's advice of 12 mins at 460 and 8 mins at 400 and then 15 mins per pound at 325 and then took it out and covered for 15 minutes. Each piece of roast was the perfect shade of pink on the inside and a bit less pink on the outsides. Even the end pieces were juicy and perfect. The roast melted in our mouths. It was a 4.5lb roast for 2 people (I wanted leftovers!) and we ate about 1lb per person cuz it was too good!! 

This is definitely a 5 star recipe!!! THANK YOU Chef Mike!

This was very good, but I did use different tempatures than recommended.  I cross-referenced this recipe with the one in the America's Test Kitchen (ATK) cookbook.  I mixed everything for the garlic topping as shown here, and it was delicious.  Change nothing about it.  I also then salted and peppered the rest of the prime rib. For the the temps, I did sear it in the oven at the beginning at 475 degrees, but then I turned it way down to 250 degrees. ATK recommended this to keep it juicy, and boy was it ever juicy. It will take longer to cook this way, but the slow cooking resulted in the juiciest beef. It took me about 1.5 hours to cook a 3.5 lb. roast to rare. Also the final temp of the beef I think is a little high here.  ATK recommended taking it out at 125 degrees for rare, and that temp was perfect. The most important step is to take it out of the oven at the end, and tent foil over the top.  Let it stand for 20-30 minutes before carving to retain all of the juices.  All of your hard work will be for nothing if you don't do this most important step! Finally, I served it with a basic horseradish sauce - 1 c. sour cream, 4 tsp. prepared horseradish, 1/8 tsp. salt, 1/8 tsp. pepper.  Perfect for our Christmas dinner!

This prime rib was wonderful.  I made it for Christmas dinner and it was the most tender prime rib I've ever had.  I followed the directions exactly and couldn't have been happier with the taste.  My prime rib was 8.5 pounds and unfortunately did take a little over an hour longer to cook than the stated cook time of 1:30 for medium rare.  I took the roast out when the meat thermometer read 145° and that was at 2 hours and 40 minutes.  I am only mentioning this for the future makers of this recipe so they can have a meat thermometer handy so they can judge when they should start to prepare their side dishes so everything will be done at once.  All in all, an amazing recipe and the taste and tenderness more than made up for the late dinner :o)  I highly recommend this recipe!  Thank you for posting it!

This is the best roast recipe ever, look no further!!!  I use a 2.5 - 3 lb. prime rib roast and half the ingredients.  It has been suggested to use half thyme and half rosemary, but I always use both in equal amounts.  I usually let the roast sit out for the full hour with the mixture on, I find the flavour to be more full that way.  I also find the cooking time to be off (good idea to use a meat thermometer), for a 2.5 lb med-rare roast I bake at 500 for 20 mins, turn oven down to 325 and roast for an additional 50 mins, then tent the roast for 15.  Enjoy!

After searching the web, I stumbled across this recipe and saw soooo many good reviews of this recipe so I decided to make it.  Boy am I glad I did.  The taste was great, but I overcooked my prime rib roast.  Lesson learned.  The details are below.

The only modifications I made were:
-I put 6 slits on top of roast and stuffed 3 cloves of garlic (cut in half) in it.
-I used kosher salt.
-I used 10 cloves of garlic instead of recommended number.
-I used the seasoning all over the roast.

Meat:
-4.5 pound prime rib roast from Costco

Thermometer:
-Pyrex Pro Digital Thermometer from Bed Bath and Beyond ($20)

Prepared seasonings the night before and rubbed it all over roast and put in fridge overnight for a total of 16 hrs before taking out for room temperature.

Left out side to come to room temperature for 2 hours.  (I live in the Bay Area and my house is colder than most houses)

Put in 500 degree oven for 20 minutes.  (The first 10 minutes made my kitchen smell sooo good of garlic.  There was no burning smell or smoke.)  I then put in the thermometer (because of warning from thermometer) and put in 3 large brown potatos and 1 large sweet potato on the sides of the drip pan (not inside the drip pan).  Lowered temperature to 325 degrees and cooked until internal temp hit 135 degrees.  I took it out of oven and tented with foil until 145 degrees.  I cut open the roast and served dinner.  The meat came out perfect medium (my guests and I prefer medium rare, but it was still very

When you pay that much for a good cut of meat these days ($6.99/lb) its hard to risk trying a new recipe, but after reading all of the reviews on this one, I felt I couldn't go wrong.  Boy, was I right! I had a roast of just over 4.5 lbs but as others recommended, I used the same amount of ingredients and rubbed it over the entire roast.  I let the roast sit at room temp for about 45 mins. and then seared it in the oven for about 18 minutes at 425 degrees. I turned the oven down to 325 and it took another 2 hours or so to reach a temp of 140 on the meat thermometer.  I took it out of the oven and let it sit, and it reached 145 on its own.  Part of the roast was on the medium side while the rest was a perfect medium rare.  Will definitely do this again.

Update:  Tried this with a 4lb New York Roast, (hubby bought it on sale saying it was half the price of a rib eye and just as good... yeah right)...  The flavor was just as great (due to the marinade, of course) and the meat was very tender, but the general quality of the meat just does not compare to rib eye. Sorry honey! Don't skimp on the cut. It is well worth the price.

This was my first attempt at prime rib, and it turned out wonderfully!  I had a 4 pound roast, so I lowered the initial cooking temp  to 450, for fifteen minutes.  I lowered the temp again to 325 for about 1 hr and ten minutes and used a foil tent.  I agree with other reviewers in that the key is watching the thermometer!  The roast was taken out at 130 degrees, and in fifteen minutes it was juicy, pink, and delicious. Can't go wrong with this recipe!  Thanks!

First prime rib was a major success. To die for! Chose the 460 for 12, 400 for 8, 325 for 20 mins per pound. Sat 35 mins. Perfect med rare.  Garlic did burn in spots but the crust was soooo delicious just the same.

Delicious! I used a 5lb prime rib. Cooked in a 460 degree oven for 12 minutes, turned down to 400 for 8 minutes after that I then turned the oven down once more to 350 and cooked it 20 minutes per pound and then an additional 15 minutes because we like OUR prime rib cooked to medium... light pink in color! It was perfect and I made an AU JUS for dipping...I added 1 cup of beef broth to the pan and and put it over heat till all the brown bitscame loose from the pan. I then strained it. PEFECT! =)

I consider myself an expert when it comes to EATING prime rib. It's one of my favorites. So I figured it was high time for me to learn how to make this for myself. I went to the grocery store and ask the butcher for a really good cut of prime rib roast. He suggested a five pounder that was $12.00 a pound!! Now I know why it's so expensive at the resturants! So I take my little treasure home and mix up the stuff to season it with exactly per the recipe.  Then I covered the entire roast with the mixture instead of just the fat part.  After reading about smoking up the house at 500 degrees, I put the roast on the BBQ. I checked the temperature after two hours and it was 150 degrees.  I had dinner ready for my wife when she got home complete with mixed veggies, squished taters, champagne and flowers on the table! We both thought it was one of the best tasting and juiciest prime ribs ever. The next day I made sandwiches on french bread and that too was excellent. Our BBQ has three burners and I set the front and back one to medium heat and the center one off and put the roast in the center of the BBQ and didn't open the door for two hours and it was medium with a little pink in the center. I think one and one half hours would be right for it to be rare.  Absolutely, positively delecious!!!!

Everyone kept saying it was the best prime rib they ever had! And I agree! I made two 5 pound roasts and timed the cooking as a 5 lb cut. I used fresh thyme. As others suggested, I did 12 min at 460, 8 at 400, and 1 hr and 40 min at 325. Came out perfect at 125 degrees. I can't get over how good this was!

oh yeah!  this was the first time i've used the "high heat" first method.  i have to tell you that it was the best prime rib to ever grace my oven.  the garlic and thyme were spot on!  i did use a probe/thermometer which helped with the timing. it was pink and oh so juicy and flavourful and the gravy made with the pan juices were dynomite!!!!  thanks so much Chef Mike!

I have never cooked prime rib until I tried this recipe.  I cooked it for my husband's office Christmas party.  Everyone loved it!  I cooked a 12 lb. roast and just adjusted the cooking time.  I will definitely use this recipe again.  I have no fear of cooking a rib roast now!

This is my absolute favorite recipe on this site!  I can't give it enough stars.  I make this for Christmas and my husband's birthday and he tells everyone how delicious it is.  Of course the cut of meat is very expensive, so this meal is for special occasions in our house.  I've also used a standing rib roast with great success.  I altered the temp and timing a little: 450 for 12 minutes, 400 for 8 minutes, and 325 for 23 minutes per pound.  EXCELLENT!  Don't be intimidated by the cost of the meat - if you follow the instructions you will be rewarded!  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!  Did I mention that it's my favorite?! :-)

Yeah, baby.  This one is a keeper.  We cooked a six pound prime rib and though our oven usually cooks quicker than that called for by most recipes, with this one, it took significantly longer--fifteen to twenty minutes more with less meat.  Strange.  Anyway, without a meat thermometer, it would have been a disaster, but in the end, things worked out fine.  The rub which turns into a beautiful crust is the best I've ever had.  500 degrees at twenty minutes seems like a lot of temperature, especially when the rib starts smoking, but we kept the faith and it turned out great.  Merry Christmas!

ADDENDUM:  We have twice used this rub for roast pork with the most amazing results.  Try it.  This best poet could not find words to describe how good it is.

Fantastic!  And so easy.  Recipe is wonderful for company because you can cook and forget it until it's time to take it out.  The cooking time is really off on the recipe.  It calls for a 10 pound roast with a cooking time of 90 minutes total.  That's 9 minutes per pound.  We just did a 11.5 pound roast for a Christmas party and it cooked for more like 20 minutes a pound.  We overcooked it for my taste. We took it out as other reviewers have suggested at 125 and tenting it.  It's unbelievable how much after cooking takes place.  It came out medium well.  We like it medium rare.

I am the greatest cook ever! I can't say what hasn't already been said. this was really easy and knocked the socks off my husband and in-laws. 
I bought a 3.75lb standing rib roast ($37-yikes) and stuffed it with three whole garlic cloves. used 6 minced cloves with the same amount of salt, pepper, thyme and olive oil. I spread it on the fatty layer and on either side. Cooked at 500 for 20 minutes and then 325 for 1 hour. came out a beautiful medium-rare. I am just so impressed with my self. GREAT GREAT recipe!

Wonderful!  I have never made prime rib before, and it turned out great.  I used the recipe- amount of seasoning, with a 5.5 lb. rib roast.  Cooked at 450 for 20 minutes, then 325 for about 1.5 hours.  Perfect, perfect, perfect.

I hosted a large dinner party this past weekend and used two 10lb boneless roasts for this. Took maybe 30 minutes longer than mentioned in recipe to cook both in the same oven...and I neglected to make sure I had two roasting pans big enough. I cut off about 3" from each chunk and froze it. Then I kept close surveillance with my instant-read thermometer...took one out at 130degrees, and the 2nd one out at 140ish degrees. Following a 15-20 minute rest, this gave me a medium rare and a well/medium well. There were 25 people and everyone had plenty of what they wanted.

This is an awsome recipe for Prime Rib, the marinade was effortless.  I used a 6.46 lbs Prime Rib.  I let it sear for the full 20 minutes and reduced the actual cooking time by 30 minutes.  This was resteraunt quality, and will be added to my catering menu.  Easy even for beginners.  Easy even for weekday dinner!!!

OMG, best recipe I've ever tried.  I cut shallow slices in the fat and meat before I put the rub on.  I kept in the fridge all morning until an hr prior to cooking.  I cooked at 450 as well for the full 30 min.  I also put a small amount of beef stock in the bottom of the pan.  The roast had taken a extra 30 min to cook, I would differently recommend using a meat theom.  I cooked it to 135 degrees and let rest for the last 15 min, the temp.  raised to 145.  I added more beef stock to the juices and tiny bit of red wine.  I did thicken it a little bit and served it with yorkshire puddings on the prime rib.  It was perfect, I will be making this recipe again. The flavor of the garlic went completely through the roast.  Yum

Like most of the other reviews this was my first time to attempt prime rib.  I don't have a great track record with meat, but this recipe was so easy.  I even impressed myself.  My husband said it was the best prime rib he has ever had and he always gets prime rib at restaurants.  It's just the two of us, so we used a 3 pound roast, but we didn't change the seasoning amounts.  We love garlic and thyme!  This will be our holiday dish from now until forever!  No more boring ham for our family!

WOW!! Very good and I even messed up and used ground thyme and more then it called for and was still great.  The cooking time was a little off for me and I even made only 6 pounder but I kept a close eye on it and it turned out just fine and medium rare  and so very tender!! I did use the advice of a couple people and took out at about 135 and wrapped in tinfoil and let set for about 10 minutes or so, i dont know if that is what made it so tender, but I will always make my prime rib this way and we also did use the juices with some beef broth for aujus (spelling is probably wrong) and it was great. used for french dips on steak buns the next day too. Thank you for great recipe!!!

This was the best prime rib we've ever had! I made it the lazy way by spraying the roast with extra virgin olive oil cooking spray, then sprinkled on the salt, pepper, thyme and rubbed in ready minced garlic. Even though it was only a 3 pound roast, the cooking time was the same, although I decreased the 500 degree cooking to 12-15 minutes. It came out perfect.

Great, easy recipe. The only reason this didn't get 5 stars is I found the marinade too salty. Other than that -fantastic!
I had a 3lb prime rib and it came to 135F after 20min at 500F and 25min at 325F. Glad I checked it early as I was expecting it to be in there for almost an hour.

I used this recipe for our Thanksgiving prime rib and boy was it tasty!  To boost the flavor, I marinated the rib roast in the garlic, olive oil, salt, pepper, and thyme over night.   I followed the instructions and the roast came out perfect, not to mention leaving the house smelling delicious!  We like our meat on the medium side so we left the roast in for another 5 minutes until the internal temperature read 157 degrees.    This recipe is definitely a KEEPER!

I had a 6.5lb roast and used the same instructions as if using a 10lb roast.  I thought my meat thermometer was broken because it did not even register anything. Nope, it wasn't! After cooking it for the reccommended time it was still VERY, VERY Rare inside; so my dinner was delayed for another hour while we put in back in the oven. It then registered 145 degrees. I only give this a 3* because of the 500 degrees for 20 minutes make the outside really crispy and tasty. But definetly use a thermometer and add an hour for a 6.5lb roast using the 325 degrees.

The flavor of the marinade was good, but be aware that 500 degrees is very hot and could cause the garlic to burn and create a dense cloud of smoke in your home (as happened to a friend I sent this recipe to).  For myself, since I was forewarned, as soon as it seemed to be getting pretty smokey I dropped the temp to 400 for the initial high temp browning.
  We also both found that the cooking times were low, even for rarer meat.

This was the first time I ever made Prime Rib and it was wonderful.  Very easy! My boyfriend is a Prime Rib fanatic and he just loved it! It was definetely a Valentines Day hit! I just used a digital probe thermometer and took the roast out at 150 degrees and it was just the way we like it. right between med rare and med!

Made this last Christmas and it was awesome! I've never made prime rib before but it turned out perfect. The only change I made is that I cooked at 460 degrees for the 12 minutes, then 400 degrees for 8 minutes. Then baked at 325 for an hour and a half (took these suggestions based on another review and worked great).

My husband has an annual gathering of friends for which I create a home-cooked, five-course meal. This year, he requested Prime Rib. I knew immediately to run to AllRecipes.com, since I'd never attempted this dish before, and I was really afraid it would turn out awful (my husband has often bemoaned the overcooked state of "prime" rib at restaurants, so I knew he wanted it just right!). When I saw all the five-star reviews and read how simple this recipe was, I figured I'd found my match! Sure enough, this was a crowd-pleaser and a roaring success! I got so many compliments on the flavor and texture of the meat (that delicious outer crust really makes a difference). Now I'm using this recipe again for Christmas dinner with the family!

I have made this recipe a few times now and it has always been delicious. I usually follow the recipe exactly and it turns out perfectly, but last night for a dinner party, I changed it a bit with really good results. I used 1/4 cup of olive oil and added fresh oregano, thyme and rosemary, along with the garlic, salt and pepper. I also added a tablespoon of vinegar. I threw these into my food processor and processed them to make a pesto-like marinade. I then marinaded the prime rib for about 4 hours before cooking. I used a 6 lb prime rib and cooked it exactly as directed to get to the perfect doneness. It was delicious!

This is the best Prime Rib I have ever eaten and believe me, and being retired military I have eaten it all over the world.  Since I found this receipt a couple of years ago on Allrecipes.com, we cook this for Christmas Diner.  Everyone loves it and always ask, "are you cooking it again next year."

I made this for a holiday progressive dinner the other night, and it was wonderful! Everyone gave it excellent reviews!! It was so easy to make.  I think next time I will make a bit more of the rub since it could have been a little bit thicker on the fatty side of the meat.( I did have a 10 1/2 lb. piece of meat)  I did take it out at 125 and then it did come up to 134 after about 30 mins. A meat thermometer is a very good thing to have on hand. 
Thanks again for a fantastic recipe!!

I have to say that this recipe is awesome. I used a 4-5 lb. roast and kept the spices the same as advised by many other ratings. if you like garlic, this recipe is perfect. The thyme made me nervous but it ended up adding an excellent flavor to the roast. Everyone raved over it.

still love the recipe, even used it for tri tip roast and bbqed it up, very very very good!!!!!!!!!!

I have tried this many times and it is great!!
There are two changes that I have made:
1.  I do not cook at 500 degrees, only at 325.
2.  I add a little spicy mustard to the mixture.

It turns out perfect every time.

Made this for our Christmas Dinner...(12/23/11 a couple of days early...long story...nothing to do with the roast, lol) It was, in a word, wonderful.  I cooked it exactly as recipe indicated, with the one exception that with the thyme I used a small amount of this amazing spice from Trader Joes called 21 Seasoning Salute. (It's amazing...and only $1.99 for regular size spice bottle..it has the perfect blend of, you guessed it, 21 spices) and I used Sea Salt and Fresh Ground Pepper. We like our meat a bit more well done so I had to cook it a bit longer.  Bottom line the perfect blend of the heart smart olive oil and garlic was so nice...and easier than you would think.  With the pricey piece of meat (8lbs, $46) it's all in the cooking once you bring it home...and this was worth it!

Absolutely the bomb!!  I've used this recipe before however I never used as much garlic and what a difference. I did add some fresh minced onions on top and I also used a 1/2 cup of olive oil instead of only 2 tbsp. pouring it over the top and sides. We love our olive oil. My family kept raving at dinner.  Thanks for such a simple recipe.

Very good recipe. I cooked a 6.5 lb boneless prime rib in a roasting pan (on rack).  I didn't have an issue with smoke so seared it for 20 mins at 475 then dropped it to 325 for an additional hour & forty minutes.  When I took it out it read 135 deg and after resting for 30 mins went up to about 142 - next time I will take it out around 130 but there was a nice variation in med rare to more well done towards the ends.  Also, I used the full marinade for my smaller roast & it was wonderful.  In order to reach 'room temp' my roast sat out about 2 hours before I put it in the oven.  Great recipe - thanks!

this is a wonderful recipe.  i took the advice of others and stuffed whole cloves of garlic into the meat through small slits i made in the meat.  everyone loved the flavor, and the real garlic lovers could not get enough of the cloves!  i added 1 1/2 garlic bulbs into my 13 lb prime rib.  awesome!  taking the meat out of the fridge and letting come to room temperature before roasting is imperative (1-2 hours).    using a meat thermometer while it roasts is the key to easily monitor when the roast has reached the doneness you desire.  we like 130 for med rare, tented it with foil and it came up to 140 in the center after 20-30 min.  with a 13 lb roast the cooking time was 20 min at 500, then 2 1/4 hours at 325. enjoy!

Thank you for this recipe.  My husband and I just forced ourselves away from the table, blissfully full. The rib was sooo flavorful. He complimented that the prime rib was better than any he's ever paid an arm and a leg for at a restaurant.  I had a 5 pound boneless prime rib and used the marinade recipe in full and it was just fine.  I did not have dried thyme, but another savory spice blend that included thyme but also rosemary and some others and it was great.  I scored the top of the roast before coating with the marinade as suggested by others.  I did find that the cook time was longer than the recipe stated, even for my 5 lb. roast.  It's possible my roast wasnt' completely thawed.  Just rely on your meat thermometer, and you'll be fine. 145-155 degrees a perfect medium rare.

Yummy!  This was my first prime rib, and it was a great success.  I used a 5 pound roast, but used the full marinade ingredients - plus doubled the salt (I was using kosher salt).  Cooked to 120 degrees and then pulled it out and let it sit, perfect!  Husband and daughters (11 & 7) loved it.

I am giving this 5 stars because I can already taste it and I haven't even made it yet. I know it will be good, but I just have one question before I do. With the very high heat at the beginning of roasting, does it cause a lot of smoking in the kitchen. I have a very sensitive alarm system! I do hope this doesn't sound too silly!!! Thank you for any comments. Meggy

I don't even have to make this Prime Rib to know it is the best I have ever tasted! I worked at a little mom and pap restaurant and this is exactly how we cooked our PR (except the olive oil). It is literally the best way to eat it. i have ate PR else where and while my friends say it is great I tell them they don't know what great is until you have Keiffer's PRIME RIB! Delicious flavor. The salty garlic taste compliments the rosemary so well. You don't even need to make A jus as the drippings from the pan and maybe a little butter do the trick! ABSOLUTELY DEVINE! I'VE NEVER TASTED ANY OTHER PRIME RIB AS GOOD AS THIS!

This was the absolute best recipe.  I did make a change, though, and it was because I had spoken with a chef prior to baking.  He advised to cook at a super super low temp for a longer time, then searing afterward.  So, I baked it for 6 hours at 200 degrees.  I was using bison meat as well, so I did not want to overcook it.  I could have baked it for five hours, since it was not so pink inside, BUT the flavor was FABULOUS!  I did sear it after baking and let it set for a bit.  My picky husband said it was excellent!  I will use this recipe again

Used fresh ground black pepper and freshly groung sea salt. Made a great rub. Only problem, was the cooking time - total time was around 2 1/2 to 2 3/4 hours - not the 1 1/2 hours mentioned in the recipe - mine times the prime rib came out perfectly medium rare. 

Received a large number of compliments from our guests, and everyone wanted to take some home with them.  There was a line for the ribs from the prime rib.

You really can't go wrong with this recipe! I thought for sure I was going to ruin this beautiful piece of meat when the fire alarm went off due to the 500 degree oven burning the oil.  I had to take out the meat and cool the oven.  So I cut down the beginning roasting time by about half and just finished the slow cooking like the recipes says.  Still turned out perfect despite the debacle.  I was a little embarrassed trying to impress my boyfriend but he still absolutely loved it!

Amazing recipe and SO darn smple!  The only thing I would say is to count on at least double the time if you're cooking an extremely large amount - we served 20 pounds for 30 people at Christmas and it took well over 4 hours to get it to medium rare.

I used this recipe for the first time last Christmas. I had never attempted Prime Rib. Sounded expensive and scary. Saw this recipe and thought, I can do that. It was easy and turned out perfect! It has become a new Christmas dinner tradition. We had a lovely, stress free dinner that was something to  remember. Prime rib is expensive, but by the time you buy the ingredients for a turkey or ham dinner with all the trimmings, the Prime Rib may come out cheaper. It was no more expensive for sure. I wish Norman Rockwell was still around. It would make a lovely traditional family portrait starring the Prime Rib. It was a beautiful thing! Thank You Chef Mike!

This was a great recipe!! 5 stars in my book!!! I made this for my hubby on Father's Day. The roast was a big hit!!!! Thank you, Chef Mike, for sharing it with everyone. I had a 5lb roast, so made half of the rub, adding some fresh rosemary to it. Smelled wonderful!  The two things I changed in the recipe was to heat up the oven to only 450 degrees F instead of the 500 degrees F, and took roast out of oven at an internal temp of 133 degrees F. By the time we ate, it was up to about 136 degrees F and was very tasty and tender.  I think the next time we have a special roast like this, I will insert some garlic into the actual meat part.  Thanks to Chef Mike and all those who gave reviews. I so appreciate the honest reviews of the actual recipe, instead of changing it to where what was made is really not the recipe on Allrecipes. Hope that made sense.  I just love Allrecipes!!!!

This was superb! I would have liked more of the crust however so next time I will double the recipe.It was finger licken' good, literally. I also think that 145 is a little overkill for medium rare. I like mine with a wee bit of red (not bloody) just a hint of red. 145 is definitely pink but not red. Next time I'll pull it out at 115 or 120. It was fantastic nonetheless. Also don't go by the time. Use a thermometer. My 4 1/2 lb roast took 2 hours (total) with a final temp of 142.  This is a half hour longer than the 10 lb piece of meat called for in the recipe. Try the recipe though, it's fantastic. Thanks for the contribution!

This was the first time I ever made any kind of meat dish. I've always been intimidated. But I gotta say this was simple and tasty. Better than most prime rib entrees I've had at restaurants. I followed the recipe pretty much to the T except for using a smaller cut (2.25 lbs) and splitting the rub in half. Next time I would just use the same amount and rub it all over. It's just tastier and the crispy garlic was so yummy on top. I'd prefer it all over next time. I even took some reviewers advice for the au jus sauce. 20 min into it, i poured 1 can of low sodium beef broth (get regular - needs salt), 1/4 cup of red wine and added some pepper and salt. let that bake w/ the meat. it wont harm it. the sauce came out nice. In the end, i learned a big lesson. the meat will continue to cook even after you take it out so when you read the temperature on the thermometer, it'll actually go up about 5 degrees. I'd take it out and let it cool down when it reaches 135-140 degrees fairly quickly AND make sure the meat is room temp. Do NOT cook it frozen b/c the meat will not be tender. Even tho my meat came out about medium, it was still juicy and tender. I used prime rib meat w/ the bone. It wasn't cheap but still cheaper than  a restaurant. =)

Made for Christmas Eve - was a bit hit!  We needed it more medium-well since I'm pregnant, so cooked it as follows:
460 for 12 minutes, 400 for 8 minutes, 325 for 20 minutes/lb. We took it out of the oven when the temp reached 135-140 and served it after about 20 minutes when it hit 150.  Also added 1.5c beef broth and .5c. red wine to make a lovely au jus.

This was the most amazing prime rib roast I ever made! My roasts have always been good according to my family BUT this one was outstanding. My husband and I had a friend of his over for dinner and he could not stop commenting on how good the roast was. To me, it tasted like the prime rib that I have ordeed in some pretty fancy restaurants. This will be my recipe from now on! Thanks sooooo much!

I served this recipe for our guests at Christmas.  It was the most flavorful Prime Ribs we've had, everyone loved it.  It was even great when we reheated the leftovers a few days later.  I cooked it a little longer than the recipe calls for because we like it a little less pink.  I gave the recipe to my Boss who's an excellent cook and his family loved it too.

I cooked mine for 5 minutes per lb at 500 degrees to sear then shut the oven off and left it for 2 hrs (from the perfect prime rib video). Turned out...perfect!

I have used SO many recipes from this website, and only reviewed 2 or 3. This one deserves me taking a few minutes out of my day. I used this recipe again this Christmas for about the 5th year in a row. EVERY YEAR my Prime Rib is absolutely perfect and delicious. The first year I made it, I was a nervous wreck cooking a $70 piece of meat, and for my fussy father-in-law at that. Followed directions to a T, and it was perfect. Have repeated every year since! Panicked one year when my meat thermometer stopped working but followed the 20 min per pound rule and it was perfect. I like to get the internal temp up to about 135, then take it out and let it rest and go up to 140-145 for perfect med rare. Always tempted to try to 'jazz up' the recipe but I never do 'cause it's so perfect the way it is. Garlic, S & P, and the thyme is really all you need. Cut some slits in the fat and rub the mixture right in there. I've done this with boneless and bone-in roasts - both delicious, but I think the bone-in is a tiny bit better. Thanks Chef Mike!

Cooking time was way off for me, but since we were using a meat thermometer to monitor by temp not time we still had a perfect med-rare result. Just much later than planned. Even with that this recipe is fabulous. Amazing flavor. Beautiful pink color. Amazingly easy to make prime rib.

This is such delicious roast beef!  It's delicious when you eat it straight out of the oven; it's delicious on a sandwich the next day; it's just plain delicious!  So simple but so flavorful.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

Wonderful recipe.  I ususally use more fresh garlic and a little more of the herbs, simply because I like to see them and it makes my kitchen smell wonderful!  I use whatever fresh herbs I have on hand (basil thyme, orgeno).  Yum!

I actually had a 14lb prime rib and had set the timer to check it at 75 minutes(after the temp reduced), and had told someone else to shut the timer off, but not the stove.  They shut the whole thing off, but left it in and an hour later I came back, and it was a perfect med on edges and med-rare in center.  Tasted unbelievable!  And it was my first time cooking a prime rib.  I had lots of compliments.  I told my friend it was because of her it was so good!  It may have overcooked otherwise!

Perfect every time. I have my butcher separate the bones from meat & tie them on (French it) , which serves as a rack. There is enough fat on the meat that the string is no problem. The key to your success is a meat thermometer.

I made this for my FIL's birthday yesterday and it was amazing!!  Such great flavor!  I used a boneless rib roast.  I was scared of scorching the garlic so I put it at 450 for about 20 mins and then down to 325 for the rest.  I also let the garlic/oil/thyme mixture marinate for about 5 hours.  Delicious!

Awesome !!  This is the perfect Prime Rib.  As good as you'll find in any restaurant.  I would advise not changing a thing, especially the first time.  If you want to make adjustments after that, it's totally up to you.  But I sure wouldn't.  This is perfect as is.  Thank you.

Very yummy. I obtained a Prime cut, boneless, 15lb roast.I researched this because, like most others I was nervous about ruining it. This is my advice when using this recipe. #1 Stick with the garlic marinade (I did mine overnight). Searing it at 500 degrees for 20 minutes really gives a great flavor. #2 Use a good digital therometer. #3 if you have a convection oven use it, it helps to cook evenly. Do not worry if you don't, I didn't have one and it still came out great.#4 Do not over cook. Every "expert" I have talked with says that you should remove your roast around 120 degrees for Medium Rare!!! I doubted this advice, took out at 130, it cooked up to 135 and it was positively a medium. So I am not understanding everyone elses recomendations on temps. I lowered my second phase cooking temp to 250 degrees because it was such a large piece of meat. From beginning to end it took 4 hours. Google "how to cook prime rib" and you will come across good advice.

This was my first attempt at Prime Rib, and it turned out to be the best I've ever tasted. I did put the roast in at 500 for 20 minutes, however my oven smoked and it resulted in my smoke alarms going off (fortunately this happened before my guests arrived). I followed the recipe exactly - any suggestions on how to avoid this in the future?

Thanks for the awesome prime rib recipe!!  Like others have mentioned, I too was a little scared cooking my very first prime rib, being such an expensive cut of meat. I worried myself too much the night before, for no reason! I followed the directions as written, and it came out perfect! I was so very proud of my very first impressive prime rib! I actually used this marinade recipe for cooking other cuts of meat, such as a regular pot roast, and it turned out tasty. Excellent recipe Chen! KUDOS to you!

I'm glad so many other people liked this recipe, but my husband and I found it bland and tasteless. The meat was overdone and tough.

I tried to cook a 7lb prime rib and the internal temp after all this time was not even above room temp. I did not open the oven door the entire time. I do NOT recommend this recipe. Did not cook and all my sides were then cold by the time another hour went by too cook the roast.

This was excellent.  Only problem was all my garlic was blackened because I guess it was to close to the burners in the oven.  But even that really didn't change the taste at all, I just scrapped it off.  I don't make this cut or size very often but if I did I would defintely make it again.  It made the kitchen smell wonderful.  It is a very simple and easy recipe.  You really don't need to do much with this type of meat.

I was SO nervous to make this because it's NOT cheap and I've never cooked a roast like this before. But this was sooo easy, it would be difficult to not get it right. This came out very moist and tender, be sure to get some of that delicious garlicky crust on your steak. I was going to take the roast out when the meat thermometer said 130 degrees, but I checked it too late and it was already at 145.. But whaddya know? It was perfect!! Pinkish on the inside and so tender. Oh, Chef Mike.. Thank you. You helped me impress my boyfriends family and make my first big feast for Easter Dinner.

I first made this for my 10 lb prime rib Christmas dinner.  It was fabulous!!  I now use it scaled down for all my beef roasts.  I do rub it all over the meat  and cook the first 20 minutes at 460 instead of 500 degrees.  Thanks so much for this recipe!

Not sure what happened but I followed the directions to a T -- my dinner planned for 6:30 did not happen until 8:30 due to the amount of time it took to cook this -- then it was overdone -- and I used a thermometer -- $75 lost on this piece of meat -- will never make again.

This is, by far, the best recipe I have found for prime rib!  I love the flavor it gives the meat! And measuring the garlic, olive oil and thyme isn't really necessary. I never measure and it comes out great - very forgiving recipe.

The key here is to let it marinate for the hour.  If you don't, the taste doesn't work its way into the meat!  Wonderful!

Fabulous!  This was my first prime rib but won't be my last.  My hubby already said he's requesting it for his birthday present!  I didn't use quite as much thyme and next time I would put foil over it just while it's at 500!  It was fabulous as is though!

This was perfect!  I cooked at 450 instead of 500 (to keep from smoking). I had a 4 lb without bone so I continued to cook for 1 hour.  The best prime rib ever!  Thanks!

This has great taste and it is so simple to make. Since prime rib is a pretty expensive piece of meat, you don't really want to screw it up! I cooked it to 145 degrees, but as it sits, the temp still rose a bit to 150 which made it more like medium-medium well on the outside. My bad! I iwll know next time!

I used this receipe for Easter this year and everyone raved about it..One of my guest lived in Tampa and said it was like eating at Burns Steak House without the huge check...The only changes I made were...scored and poured worchestershire sause on prior to other ingredients...also added more garlic.For the au jus I used: 1tp "Better Than Bouillion" beef base added to 1 cup boiling water, 1 cup red wine and added to juices in bottom of pan when done...

I have a family recipe that is tried and true.  I decided to experiment with this recipe and was disappointed.  Even though the meat was pink, it was much drier than I am used to. Next time I will use the marinade, but use my own roasting method.

Hmmm..I'm quite surprised by all the enthusiastic comments I must say.  First of all, I think I've learnt never to add any time of liquid (i.e oil) to prime rib now.  You sacrifice the beautiful au jus.  It was a big disappointment.  I think the recipe would be fine if you rubbed the other ingredients over the prime rib but left out the oil.  Sorry.

I was a first-time prime rib cooker.  Many recipe variantions to try, but I chose this one because I love garlic, olive oil and thyme.  This recipe ROCKS!  Although I had to take the battery out of my smoke alarm because of the first step, and listen to my family moan about the smokey house ... they thought it was SO worth it when they tasted this!  I did have to turn up my oven to 350 to finish the roast to reach 145 internal temp, but that was OK.  Honestly, it turned out perfect.  My fam has already requested another one ... SOON!  Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent recipe.  I did find that I had to turn my oven to 350 degrees for the last 1/2 hour of cooking time and extended the cooking time by 15 mins.  End result was a rare to med rare piece of delicious, flavorful meat.  This is a keeper!!

Absolutely fantastic. A huge hit  that everyone loved.  Made a 5.2lb bone-in prine rib. Generously served 4 people.  Only changes I did: 1 teaspoon o fresh thyme and 1 teaspoon of dried.  Also made a jus with the fond and bits in the roasting pan while meat was resting.  Jus was made with 1 teaspoon of flour and 1 cup of red wine, brought to simmer and reduced.  Served with Yorkshire pudding, barbecued asparagus and salad. Delish! 
Extra notes: initial searing stage crucial to getting a nice crispy- ish exterior.  Equation for initial bake at 500: 5 mins per pound exactly. This worked out perfectly. Also, covered meat in aluminium while resting so as not to allow to cool.   This recipe is an absolute keeper and i will be making it again for sure!

The best prime rib ever. I make this recipe once or twice year, and this is the only recipe I use. The only thing I do different is this, I add extra garlic powder and onion powder to step one. Great recipe.

The recipe looked great, but there is a typo in step three of the directions "145 degrees F (53 degrees C)"... those two temperatures do not equate!  I am a cooking newb so I overcooked my prime rib as a result.  53 deg C is more like 127 deg F!

Made this for Easter Dinner, EVERYONE even my oh so picky brother in law and super picky daughter loved it, comments were" this is the best prime rib"
My only problem was while in at 500 the garlic was burning so next time I guess chopping it finer might help?

Although I used a relatively small roast, about 2 1/2 pounds, I scaled the ingredients accordingly and watched the internal temperature carefully.  The roast turned out perfectly.  It was the first time I was brave enough to try cooking a prime rib and it was incredibly good.  This is definitely a keeper.

I made a 4.5lb roast. It was fantastic. Next time the only thing i will change is; I will follow the advice of other reviewers who made a smaller roast and did not half the marinade. This is hands down my favorite prime rib recipe!

This recipe was EXCELLENT!!!! I had an engagement for family and friends.  My fiancee and I decided to have prime rib.  I had never cooked a prime rib before and we were going to have 12 guests.  I talked to my butcher and I decided to get a 12.5 lb roast.  For the price I did not want to mess this up.  I got a thermometer for the oven and a meat thermometer inserted into the meat with a wire lead to a monitor outside of the oven.  This was the absolute best investment because I could easily monitor the meat temperature.  I did double the recipe and made sure to cover the roast.  I set the temperature at 500 degrees let the prime rib cook for 15 minutes and dropped the tempetrature to 450 degrees just before the roast started to smoke from the high temperature.  I then dropped the temperature to 325 degrees until the internal temperature reached 135 degrees for medium rare as other reviews have stated.  I calculated that it would take anywhere from 15 to 20 minutes per pound to get to desired doness.  The meat thermometer went off at 135 degrees.  The roast looked and smelled incredible.  I took the prime rib out of the oven and tented the roast.  The temperature dropped to 130 degrees and then rose back to 135 degrees.  The prime rib was ready on time after letting it rest.  Our guests raved all evening about the prime rib and how good it tasted.  Some of the guests could not get enough.  We plan on making this again for our friends.

This was my first time making Prime Rib and it was excellent! I had a 10 lb piece of meat and it took one hour 45 minutes to reach 145 degrees after I dropped it to 325. 145 was perfect medium rare. Will be making this again for sure.

This is an easy recipe and it is so good! We tried it last night for a dinner party, which can always be nerve-wracking, but just stick to the instructions and watch your meat thermometer. Take the meat out when it is 10 degress LESS than what you ideally want  and it will be perfect!! Also, bought the prime rib from Costco, which I think also helped! Good luck!

Made this for Christmas dinner and it was DELICIOUS! Blew away my in-laws! 
I started at 475 instead of 500 and went 5 min. per pound. Then I took it out at 135 to have rare in the middle. You can also use butter instead of olive oil as some other recipes suggest but it's great either way.

Great Taste - - however, cook time is really understated. I checked at 70 min mark and roast was not even 100 degrees...allow 150-180 minutes for medium rare/medium - about 150 degress.  Planned on finishing roast at 5 and was 7 before I was carving.  Also - will only serve about 10, that was about 10-12 oz each.

That was so delicious. I also added about 1 1/2 T of balsamic vinegar. It made the roast taste like it came from a high class restuarant.  I make great gravy but omg that was the best gravy ever! I just added about a cup of beef stock and thickened it a tad. Everyone could not stop eating it. Leaving the roast out to come up to room temp is the key along with giving the roast it's 1o minutes of resting time.

This was great.  My husband said it was just as good as any restaurant prime rib.  I also added a bit of rosemary and extra garlic.  For au jus, I strained the pan drippings in a pan, added a bit of dijon mustard, about a 1/4 cup cold water with about 1 Tablespoon and a half of cornstarch, blended with a wisk and slowly added a can of Campbells Beef Consumme.   I will definitely prepare prime rib this way often.

This is really yummy as-is, but after making a few primes rib roasts, I've learned some things. I left out the salt because it draws moisture out of the meat and I seared the roast on my BBQ grill. Also, I basted my roast with some beef broth made with Better Than Bouillon Beef Flavor. I added 1-2 tablespoons of soy sauce, 2 cups of water and 2 teaspoons of Better Than Bouillon Beef Flavor to my pan drippings to make my au jus. After cooking using this recipes instructions, My roasts always came out Medium-Well (too done for me!). This last time, I took my roast out when it said 120 degrees, covered it with foil, and let it rest for 25-30 minutes. I took the temperature again and the roast was 140 degrees, perfect for me! It was oh so yummy, too!

Yummy! Super easy. The thyme is an awesome addition I never would have thought of. JENNLOREN's tips help a great deal. Plan for extra cooking time. It seems mine always takes a little longer than expected. This is pretty fool proof and an awesome way to wow carnivores at your next dinner party!! Thanks Chef Mike!!!

Making this was my first attempt at Prime Rib and I have to confess....I was very intimidated by attempting cooking such a pricey piece of meat but, it was awesome!  It was a hit with everyone and I will definately make it again!  I followed the directions to the letter and would not change a thing.  Thanks Chef Mike, you made me look good!!

This was FABULOUS!!! My first try at prime rib was New Year's Eve - a 4.5lb. roast. Followed marinade to the letter, roasted at 450 for 30 minutes, then lowered it to 325 until thermometer read 130 (for rare). Can't wait to make it again. Thanks!

Excellent recipe.  I placed the roast on a baking rack inside the roasting pan to avoid the roast "sticking to the bottom".  I roasted an 8 lb prime rib roast and it took 1 1/2 hours to reach the 135 degrees that I desired not counting the 20 minutes @ 500 degrees.  As the other review mentioned, a meat thermometer is imperative for getting the roast to the desired temperture.  Thanks for a great recipe.  This recipe is a keeper!

Drooool....this is the first roast I ever made, and this recipe made me seem like a gourmet chef. Wow - so easy and so good. I used a much smaller cut of meat (about 2 lbs) and cooked for an hour on 350 degrees. The juices made a terrific gravy too!

This was excellent.  I have never made prime rib before and this was so easy and GOOD.  I cooked it 30 minutes per pound and it came out pink in the middle.  I made au jus with the drippings, 3 C. water, 3 bullion cubes, salt, pepper and Maggi seasoning to taste.  Everything was excellent!

I made a 6lb boneless prime rib roast. Took the advise of others reviews the made temperature change. I cooked it at 450 degrees for the first 20 minutes and then reduced to 325 degrees for 15 minutes per lb and it came out a perfect medium rare with a nice crust. Thank you

This recipe was awesome.  I made it for Christmas dinner and everyone raved about it.  I followed the ingredients to a T, it was spot on.  I followed other reviewers advice by cooking it for 12 minutes at 460 degrees, then 8 minutes at 400 degrees, and finally 325 for about 17 minutes per pound.  Pulled it out when the meat thermometer registered 135 and let it sit for about 20-25 minutes.  It was a perfect medium throughout the entire roast.

I did a 4lb rib roast same amounts of garlic and salt, 1 1/4 tsp of pepper, and 1 heaping tsp of thyme.  Added 1 cup of beef broth to the bottom of my cast iron braiser after I lowered the temp to 325 for moisture.  I followed the other recommendations with cooking temps and did: 12 min at 460 and 8 min at 425, then 65 min at 325 degrees.  Inside temp. was 137 and came out beautifully!  My husband's only critique was for me to use less thyme next time.  We will definitely do this again!!

Double, or even triple the garlic crusting, it's fantastic.

We made this for our family for Easter.  So easy and VERY GOOD!  Love it.  We will make it again. The only alteration I made was a 6 pound prime rib toast and 6 garlic cloves because there were only 6 of us. It was wonderful!

AWESOME!!  It was my first time making any rib roast and I made it for Christmas Eve dinner.  I only had 4.5 lbs (for 2 people), so like the suggestion of another reviewer, I seared it at 460 degrees for the first 12 minutes, and then turned the oven down to 325 degrees, for 25 mins. per lb.  It came out medium -medium rare--just how I like it!!  

Thanks, Chef Mike-- I'm definitely going to make this again!!

Very good and very easy to make.  Everybody loved my prime rib and it was the first time I ever made prime rib.  The only thing I would suggest is when you start cooking your prime rib at 500 degrees for the first 20 minutes, just keep an eye on it...mine started to cook really fast and and almost started burning the top of the meat.  I just turned it down and put foil over the top of the meat and let it cook.  It had a perfect crispy top.

Cooked for Christmas Day lunch and everyone was impressed. They could smell the garlic goodness from down the street. After I marinated, I placed Kosher Salt on the bottom of the roasting pan and packed a lot of salt around the edges. It took a bit longer to cook than I anticipated, but my digital thermometer was extremely useful in helping me determine temp/time to have it ready. I would love to serve again!

I had a NY Holiday roast and used this recipe. It was delicious! I baked at 500 for about 12 minutes and worried about what others mentioned about burning I turned the oven down to 450 for the last 8 minutes and then to 325 for the rest. Recommend and can't wait to use again! Thanks!

I had never made prime rib before so when my husband said he wanted to cook prime rib for new years eve I first cringed and then went straight to all recipes.  So very easy and the flavor is suburb!!  We will absolutely make this again.  Just a note, I saw a lot of reviews that brought down the beginning temp to 460 degrees and then to 400.  So very unneccesary.  At 500 degrees the roast and the rub are fine and it accually took us just over the 75 minutes to get a rare-med. rare roast.  Perfect for leftovers to be reheated and not get over done.
Thank you Chef Mike, we will be looking for other recipes you have submitted. :)

Christmas dinner - Very easy but took A LOT longer then the timer said and it was still more rare then we wanted.  We were hoping for a medium with some of the ends more well.  There was only one small piece that was well.

I wish I could give it more stars!  I made a 6lb roast. I made the rub exactly as stated in the recipe. I made slits in my roast and rubbed it all over.  I like to cook my meat at room temp, so I took it out of the fridge very early and rubbed it about 4 hours before cooking. I then cooked it just as stated in the recipe at 500 degrees for 20 mins. It didn't smoke or burn the rub - it was great. I then turned it down to 325 like the recipe states and cooked for 70 mins. It was at 125 degrees when I took it out of the oven. I let it rest for 20 mins and it was perfect!  It was cooked to mid-rare just like we like it.  My daughter who does not eat a lot of meat gobbled this up! The rub is divine - love the Thyme so much better than rosemary!  This was my first time making a standing rib roast, and I was so nervous, but it came out perfect! Thanks so much for such an easy and wonderful recipe!  For those that had trouble with the roast reaching temperature in the time suggested - I suggest you let your roast get to room temp first. I like to let it sit out for 4-6 hours before cooking. This allows for even cooking throughout and reduces the time in the oven as well.

Absolutly the best way to make prime rib. Try lightly criss cross slicing the meat on the fatty side and the non fatty side. rub whole roast with wosterchire sauce, applyolive oil/thyme mixture and sprinkle with kosher salt. DON'T over cook. Try removing from oven @ 125 degrees. Meat will continue to cook. Enjoy and Happy Holidays!

This recipe turned out very good. I let the paste sit on the roast over night in the fridge and followed the suggestions for the cooking at 450 for 20 then 325 for 2 hours or until an internal temp of 135. Cooked perfect that way!

A great tasting roast!  I bought a digital thermometer to use with this, and let me tell you... that's the way to go!  If you don't have one, get one... I was using an older meat thermometer and had never had a roast turn out.  The flavor in this was amazing, I didn't have any thyme so I added a little cilantro to the mix.  Great flavor!  Mine ended up cooking about 2 hours and 20 minutes (5.63# roast) using the suggestions of 460/400 like other reviewers before turning it down to 325 (I hardly ever follow recipes) and it was great.  I think you could have done it at 500 and it would have been fine, but I figured I would try something "by the book" for once LOL  Thanks for the recipe!

First time making prime rib, followed instructions exactly, except it took about 1.5 hours to cook but it was a very thick prime rib, so I had anticipated this.  The taste and texture were phenomenal.  I did pull it out of oven at 130F, covered with tin foil, and let it sit for 20 minutes.  It ultimately reached 142F.  Definitely recommend this recipe!

This was disappointing, especially after all of the reviews.  The garlic mixture was great and made the house smell wonderful.  But the flavor didn't penetrate to the roast.  And since the rest of the roast was basically unseasoned, it didn't have any really great flavor.  Perhaps if the entire roast had been rubbed with the garlic mixture, it would have made a difference.  And I think the garlic mixture would be great on chicken breasts or a pork tenderloin.

Fantastic!   Unbelievably easy to make plus I made roasted sliced red potatoes and onions, asparagus and salad.   This was a huge hit at my dinner party with folks saying it was just as good, if not better than Lawry's!  Great with creamy horseradish though not enough drippings for au jus.   Definitely will be made again!!

I made this exactly as directed and it came out absolutely perfect.  I made an 8 1/2 pound roast and it took about half an hour longer to cook, probably just my oven.  Best prime rib I've had in my life!  My 6 year old declared, "Mommy, you have to give this five stars online because all five of us LOVE this!"  
Thanks Chef Mike!!

Wouldn't do a prime rib any other way after making this.  Fantastic.  My standard for either Christmas Day or New Year's Day.  Everyone loves it!

I'm not a big fan of prime rib, but my husband wanted to try this for Christmas.  We marinaded a 7 lb roast for about 24 hours, following the recipe exactly, but baking 1 hour longer than the instructions called for.  I have to say, this was excellent!  I think it would also be fantastic on rib eye steaks!  This recipe definitely took the fear out of preparing prime rib!  Thank you for sharing this awesome recipe!

This was very easy, and did make a great Prime Rib. I put the rub on the meat, wrapped it tight in Seran Wrap and refrigerated overnight for extra flavor. Then let it sit to reach room temperature 1 hour before cooking. The cooking time was a little off for mine, but I used a digital thermometer and it turned out perfect in the end.

The ingredients in this recipe are spot on. It was incredible prime rib and the family thoroughly enjoyed it! The ONLY thing I could pass along was the fact that it took about 2 hours of cooking time for my 9 lb. roast once I lowered the temperature to 325, in order to reach 135-140 degrees. This was after pulling the roast out of the fridge and allowing it to stand for an hour. Just thought I would share this for those who are trying to plan accordingly! :-)

I have to agree with all the great reviews for this recipe. I am not a big cook, but if I could find more recipes like this I might become one!  I made a very small (under 3 lb) cross rib roast, and adjusted the time and temp per some of the suggestions here, and it was one of the best roasts I've ever tasted. It was tender, had WONDERFUL flavor, and was nicely pink with a delicious, crusty exterior. Me, my boyfriend, my teen daughter, and her boyfriend all loved it and wanted more.  I plan to make another (larger) roast for Thanksgiving - this is my new go-to beef recipe. (And my mom wants to make it for our family Christmas dinner, too!)  Thanks for sharing this amazing, simple recipe!

I have forgotten to rate this recipe for over a year. I have made this exactly as directed more than 10 times now. I have used the rub on everything from a 5lb bone in to a 15lb for a large party. Just excellent. I host a ton of dinner parties and everyone is always hoping for my "Prime Rib". I have made this with Choice as well when Prime was just way too high priced... Did I already say excellnt? Thanks for positng. MAke sure to use Kosher Salt in your rub not table salt.

Just ok. I used a 5 lb. roast and it still was only at 100 degrees after 2 hrs. of cooking. We finally decided to eat it rare because we were so hungry. It also did not yield any juice at all. It smoked while I cooked it at only 450 for 20 min. and the garlic burnt. It gets a 3 because it didn't actually taste bad, but for the price I paid for the meat I was very disappointed.

The best prime rib I have ever had. Nothing has ever come close. I had a 10lb roast. Took it out of the fridge to get to room temp for an hour.  Rubbed the entire roast with about a handful of kosher salt mixed with cracked pepper. Then I rubbed 10 cloves of minced garlic on the fatty portion and sides. I'm not a big fan of thyme so I placed a handful of fresh rosemary sprigs on top and drizzled the roast with olive oil. Let it sit for another 30 min. Seared at 460 for 12 min., then 8 minutes at 400. Turned the temp down to 325 and about 2 hours later I took it out when it reached a temp of 135. Let it sit on my counter for about 20 minutes to finish "cooking" and, covered it with foil and put it back in the oven on warm for another 2 hours (I made it way ahead of time). It was melt in your mouth goodness and a perfect medium rare. So, so, so good.

Great recipe for prime rib. I would watch where you place the temp probe, you can over cook it if it is stuck in the center and the edges cook too long. Just be aware.

My cooking time took about 1 hour longer than this recipe called for (and I only used 9 lbs.) but the marinade is scrumptious! I plan on using this marinade in the future as well.

Just like almost everyone that has reviewed this recipe, I had never cooked a prime rib before and was so nervous.  Especially when one of our guests said, "You are just now putting that in the oven.  You know those take like 5 hours!".  I explained the recipe that I was following and said we will see.  This is just incredible, incredible, incredible!  I followed the recipe exactly with mouth watering results.  Use this recipe when you want to "wow" someone with your mad cooking skills.

wow, great.  Did as others suggested, 450 for 20 minutes then about an hour and a half at 325 for perfect pink meat.  Used the amount of rub listed for a 5.0 lb roast, all over is best,...wow great recipe.  Thank you

Excellent. So so good. Tried it with a 4lb prime rib roast. I think the MOST important part is to let the roast reach room temperature. That said I left it on the counter for almost 2 hours, and it still was only 10degrees C when I checked it. Ended up cooking it for 20 mins at 500, and then 70mins at 340. Also used frozen garlic cubes and omitted the salt. Added some of the veggie water to the drippings and added a little gravy thickener, plus a splash of red wine. I can't wait to make this again.

I used a 16 lb. roast so I doubled the rub ingredients.  I also rubbed between the meat and bones before tying on the bones.  Next time, I'll remove the meat at 140 degrees F. and let rest for 30 minutes before slicing.  Very tasty.

If ever a recipe deserved five stars this is it. This is easy, elegant and most importantly delicious! 
I throw in several cloves of garlic and scatter them around the base of the roast. After the roast is done cooking, not only does the garlic aroma linger in the meat but now I have roasted garlic for bread. 
I do double of the marinade and lather it up good. The end result is a perfect crust and moist meat. 
The leftovers make incredible sandwiches. This is a favorite of everyone in my family!

This was the first time I had made a prime rib.  I was always afraid to make it because it is such an expensive piece of meat.  Let me tell you, this was THE best prime rib I've every had!!!!  I made it for Christmas (12 dinner guests...)and everyone loved it!  I have made it once a month since then.  Thank you sooo very much for the post!!!!!! :)

We enjoyed this. I used more garlic and coated the entire roast. Next time I'll double the coating and will place slivers of garlic on the sides of the roast as well. I followed other suggestions and started out at 450 instead of 500.  It did make a mess of my oven though.  Be sure to use a meat thermometer and let rest for about 30 minutes. It was very tender.  I served with twice baked potatoes and pan fried asparagus (my recipe from this site).  My guests loved it. Thanks Chen

Absolutely Perfect. I inserted cloves of garlic and then covered the whole roast with the rub. It tasted phenomenal. I took it out of the oven before the themometer said 140. It hit 140 during the resting period. It could not have been better. I used Montreal steak spice instead of plain black pepper and used sea salt. A meat themometer is a must for this to work. Yum!

You can not go wrong with this recipe.  I used a smaller roast as well...like other reviewers, but did not diminish any of the ingredient amounts.  Rub the entire cut of meat...that is my only advice.  Great recipe, thanks for the post.

This was my 1st prime rib and it was great.  I cut the ingredients in 1/2 because it was just for my husband and I and our cut of beef was 1/2 the size.  I will use this recipe again.

Outstanding! Great centerpiece to our Easter meal.  The butcher cut the bone away and twined almost 5 pounds up.  I let it sit overnight in a zip loc bag with the spice mixture just to make cooking easier before heading out to church.  Followed the cooking instructions exactly.  Delicious! Everyone loved it.  My husband only regretted that I did not make the creamy Restaraunt horseradish sauce.

You do not want to mess around with a cut of meat this expensive.  This is the only recipe to ever trust, and the one to stick with for the rest of your life! 
I  have made this for every Christmas day dinner since 2007.  This meal is part of my gift to my extended family, and they now look forward to the prime rib as part of our tradition.   I serve it with the roasted Brussels sprouts and whipped horseradish sauce from this site, along with a loaded baked potato.  My daughter takes the potato orders, which adds to the fun of this meal.
Add a carton of beef broth to the bottom of the pan and crank the oven up to 425 for au jus to serve with the meat.
The first step of cooking the roast at 500 for 20 minutes will smoke out your kitchen,  be prepared to open doors and windows even if it's the dead of winter.   Our smoke alarm goes off every time, I liken this to pavlov's dog, as the loud alarm makes everyone's mouth water because they know the prime rib meal is coming.
Thank you Chef Mike!

Unlike others who have added or changed this recipe even slightly, I followed it exactly.  I used a 5lb chef style bone in rib roast and halved the rub recipe.  I must say it was ny first rib roast ever and it was AMAZING.!!!!  It is hard when you buy an expensive piece of meat and don't want to mess it up.  I highly recommend this recipe to anyone who wants to do it right the first time.  The cooking times were spot on, and there was no smoke whatsoever searing it at 500F.  If was perfect for moi as I must have been a vampire in a past life, but for my blood wary family thd next time I will cook of longer at 325 to at least medium so I don't have to hear about the red yummy goodness.  As is, the recipe produced delicious, tender, and restaurant quality at home.  I will def make this again.  Perfect to entertain and impress.  A++++.!!!!!

I have tried this recipe 2 times in the past year.  Each time the roast turned out very well done,  which is not the way to serve good prime rib.  And if you wait for the internal temperature to reach 135,  it keeps on cooking itself and gets way over done.

I made this for my husband two weeks ago for our anniversary. I followed the directions exactaly and it was incredibly delicious. Two weeks later its his birthday and he asks specifically for this. Did I mention my husband is not much of a beef fan, so this recipe is absolutely to die for. I served it with horseradish sauce, baked potatoes, and garlic steamed broccoli!

I used this on a chuck roast about a month ago and it turned out really well. When my boyfriend came over he said the house smelled great. I will be making this for him Sunday to see how he likes it.

Followed the recipe and it was perfect.  My boyfriend loves prime rib and thought that this recipe was going to be a bust because of the cooking time and temps boy was he wrong.  He said it was the best prime rib.  We made our own au jus sauce to put on top.  So Good!!

Great taste but beware! This roast is not ready in 1hr 40min! I am not a novice cook and should have known that an 11 pound roast would need more time... needless to say it was not ready in time for Christmas dinner!

I started this at 450 for 20 mins then lowered the temperature to 350 (so it could cook at the same temperature as the potatoes) & allowed 15 mins per pound. It was still way too rare (looked freshly butchered) at 15 mins per lb at 350. I would recommend 20 mins per lb at 350.

This was our first time making prime rib and it turned out delicious!  It did cook much faster than we anticipated.  I will def. use this recipe whenever I make prime rib.  A meat thermometer is key here.

This was Fabulous! I made my first prime rib roast with this recipe and it turned out wonderful! It took a bit longer than expected to cook, but I had almost a 10lb roast, so I guess I should've expected that. I also made a marinade to inject inside of the roast. It was so flavorful and moist...would definately recommend!

I have made prime rib many times, with many different rubs.  This will be my "go-to" recipe going forward. A whole new level of deliciousness.  For maximum flavor, make sure you are getting a "prime" grade of meat (usually only available at a butcher shop).  We also use the small end of the rib roast, which has a thicker layer of fat, which we carve off before serving. Indulgent, but hey - we only do this for special occasions.

Great recipe for prime rib, BUT the cooking time shown was almost 2 hours too quick so 4 pm dinner became 6 pm dinner.  Use the 25-30 minutes per pound cooking time as a guide.

Yes, the 11 pound prime rib was at room temperature before cooking and yes, my oven was at 325 exactly.  We took it out at an internal temperature of 130-135 F, and after standing it was spot on medium rare because it will keep cooking while standing.

UFF-DA!! Hands down the best prime rib I have had anywhere. I am not an original cook, but I used every trick other people mentioned in their ratings for this.  I used a 3.85 lb cut. I mixed up the full amount of marinate/rub called for on the 10lb size. I used 1tsp each of thyme & rosemary instead of just thyme. I used a little less minced garlic because I also cut holes on the top and put garlic pieces into the meat.  i scored the top before I rubbed the marinate slurry into the meat.  I let the meat rest on the counter for 5 hrs to warm up. The kitchen smelled delicious after an hour and I hadnt even turned on the oven yet! I preheated the oven to 460 degrees and popped it in the oven in just a regular pyrex 9x13 pan--uncovered, bone down. I let it cook for 13 minutes, then i turned it down to 400 for another 8 minutes. I did break the carnal rule when I opened the oven to stick the thermometer probe in the meat while it was cooking. Then I turned the oven down the last time to 325 degrees. I did have a display attached to the probe sitting outside the oven then. I planned just to cook it 14 mins/lb and hope for the best (I like mine med rare). I am glad I bought the fancy meat thermometer at the last minute because it ended up cooking 15-20 mins longer to reach 130 degrees. I pulled it out and kept the probe in, covered it with foil. The temp of the meat seemed rise fairly quickly after 115 degrees in the oven.  The meat was perfect & so so flavorful.

This was wonderful! We cooked it a little too long, as we like it more rare than medium, but quite a hit. This was made for a special late lunch when my fiancee' and I announced our engagement to the kids during our weekly family day

WOW! I roasted a  #10 prime rib last night for an 80th surprise birthday party and I was the hit of the partty! It had just enough flavor that it didn't overpower the meat. It came out moist and very tender. It did make a mess of my oven, but what the heck, that's what we have self cleanings for, right? 
I didn't change the recipe at all. It was perfect just like it is. Highly recommend!

I cooked it at 500 degrees for 20 minutes as the recipe calls for, and then 425 for about an hour. The center was still very pink/red even though the thermometer read 160/170 degrees.

Very good! This was an easy prime rib recipe. I will suggest to make sure you have a baking rack and a oven proof thermometer. I didn't an ours was a bit over done but did not hurt the flavor what so ever. Had a 15 lb roast so I just bumped everything up TBLS or so and popped that baby into the oven.....wam-o! HAPPY NEW YEAR!

BEST prime rib I've ever had!!!! I decided to invite the whole family over for a nice prime rib, New Year's Day dinner.  I have always bought the pre cooked prime ribs and this was my first attempt starting from square one.  I used the recipe as posted on a 5 lb roast then followed a few others suggestions and cut slits and garlic slices in the top.  I cooked it at 460 for 12 min, 400 for 8 min and then reduced it to 325.  I've read differing time/lb at 325 so I just used a meat thermometer and cooked it to an internal temp. of 125 and let it rest until I had everything else ready (approx 30 min). I think my thermometer may have been off a bit because it came out Medium, but was still absolutely delicious!!!! Incredibly juicy, tender and mouth watering flavor.  I went back for seconds but it was all gone.  Everyone complimented me even those that aren't typically fans of prime rib. Will being using this recipe again for many years to come.

I would have given it 5 stars but no way can you cook a rib roast to 145 and expect medium rare. You need to pull it at 135. 145 degrees will end up almost medium well by the time you let it rest, it'll be over 150. Great recipe though.

Delicious marinade!  I added additional pinches of salt, maybe about one and a half teaspoons to the marinade for a 5 lb roast.  I seasoned the roast on all sides and let it marinate over the night before following the posted directions.  I also seared it at 460 for 12 minutes and 400 for 8 minutes, before cooking it for an additional hour at 325.  Some parts were better cooked (to my liking) than others, but all were delicious.

The receipt was easy to follow...calculated the ingredients and cooking time for a 15 lb boneless rib, which was excellent. This is a killer receipt which I'll use again and again, especially during the winter holidays.    Thank you from Keaukaha, Hilo, Hawaii.

I wish there were more stars to give. I've made this 2x so far for my parents anniversary and my father, who is probably the pickiest eater around, said it was the best he's ever had. That is saying so much. It came out perfect, exactly as written. I used a 3.5 pound roast and it cooked for the 20 minutes at 500 then for an hour perfectly. Thank you so much for sharing this.

This is now the only way I'll make a prime rib--it's that perfect. The only differences I make is I use fresh rosemary rather than dried thyme (though I suppose using both would be doubly good!) and I also rub a little extra of the mix over the sides of the roast after I've smeared the bulk of it on the fatty part . Every time I make it it's perfect and it's now expected of me to make this for special occasions. I've also used the same recipe for a leg of lamb and a pork roast and it's just as good. It's pretty much become my go-to recipe for roasts in general. :)

I made this for my carnivore husband and he tells me that it was the best prime rib he has ever eaten. I did scale down the ingredients to accomodate a smaller roast.

This was excellent. I made this for my entire family at a get together. I was nervous because I had never made Prime Rib before and it is expensive. So the last thing I wanted to do was mess it up......  BUT I followed the recipe exactly as written and EVERYONE loved it!

Awesome and idiot proof! Unlike many on this site, I'm not a cook;however, I had a dinner party and found this recipe. My prime rib was a little bigger (13.5 lbs) so I adjusted the recipe accordingly using my best guess and the prime rib I served made my guests think I was a master chef! I can't believe it was so easy and tasted so delicious. My success with this has made me eager to explore this site and start cooking more often. Thanks so much Chef Mike and all the commentors on this site -- my dinner party wouldn't have been a success without you and this fab recipe. Highly recommend.

INCREDIBLE recipe. This was my first time cooking prime rib, and I started off small with only a 2.5lb piece. I used the same amount of seasoning and slathered it all over the roast. I took it out when the internal temp came to about 125 and it came out perfectly medium rare. Next time i will use less salt and also substitute rosemary for the thyme.

This recipe was easy to follow and has a very satisfying taste. The ingredients was very simple but it gave this great juicy taste to the roast. I followed the directions exactly, except for one alteration, I followed another reviewers suggestion on added a little bit of all-purpose flour around the roast so it can seal in the taste. It was so good that my family wanted it again. So I made it twice this month already. Thanks for the recipe. This one is a keeper!!

This was SO easy and SO worth spending the money on this cut of meat.  I made a 6lb roast, combined all ingredients as listed for a 10lb roast.  I put the mixture all over the roast and covered in plastic wrap and let sit in fridge for 24 hours.  Followed the cooking time, had no problem with smoking @ 500 degrees for 20 minutes.  My family loved this and I can' only describe it as "a near orgasmic experience"  Thank you Chef Mike, I plan on making this again and agian and again.

I've used this recipe about 10 times now and it's turned out absolutely amazing every single time.  Everyone loves it and it couldn't be easier. !!!  The only additional thing that I do is slice holes in the roast all over and slide slivers of garlic into them.  mmmmm delicious !

Made this for company last night.  Used a 6 lb roast, so I halved the recipe.  Cooked 20 minutes at 500, then almost 2 hours at 325.  Used a remote meat thermometer from Williams Sononma - best invention.  oooked until 135, tented with foil for 15 minutes.  Would probably next time only cook until 130, would like it a little more pink.  Excellent recipe.

Magnificent! Instead of only brushing the garlic marinade over the fatty side, we made a little more than it called for and brushed it all over the prime rib.  Definitely will be making this again.  I've been spoiled!  :)

Perfection!  The flavors of the garlic and thyme went all through the meat.  Can't do any better than this!

Hands down the easiest and best prime rib ever. It's a prime rib lovers delight.  No exotic spices or flavors And it's fool proof. You won't be sorry you tried it.  We will be enjoying this for our Holiday dinner again.  Thanks so much for a  marvelous recipe.  L.

I just made this recipe for  Christmas dinner I held for a few of my close friends. Everyone liked it. Great recipe, I would actually spread the seasoning mixture over all sides besides the bottom. Also, during the 20 minutes when you are roasting at 500 degrees be sure to put your fan on because it did get quite smoky in the house because of the high temp.

I used this recipe for my first time cooking Prime Rib, and I admit I was skeptical, but it turned out awesome and was SOOO EASY! I browned the roast(5 lbs)before cooking it for and cooked for 1-1/2 hours at 325. It came out perfectly! I doubt I will ever go back to turkey for Christmas!

Made a 5 pound boneless rib roast to serve 8 and they totally loved it. Didn't change a thing. I will definitely cook this again and again. Except next time I will request the bone cut out and tied into the roast for even more flavor. Thanks for sharing it.

This was my first time cooking prime rib and it turned out fantastic.  The prime rib roast that I was using was only about 3 lbs so I cooked it for 10 minutes at 450 and then an additional 60 minutes at 325 ... other than that I followed the recipe as written.  I will definitely make it again.

Absolutely fabulous. My husband and his friend couldn't get over how good it was.

It took almost 2 hours at 325 to get my 7 1/2# prime rib to 145 degrees, but it was well worth the wait.  After an hour, it was 68 degrees.  

Next time I will test the temp of the middle before cooking to make sure it is truly at room temp, and let it sit out marinating longer if it needs it.

We used a smaller cut of prime rib, 3 and a 1/2 pounds, my husband made this and he suggests to take your time with this.  Cooking time, reduce accordingly.  This was absolutely DIVINE!  We reduced the cooking time to 15 minutes for medium rare, the only way to have prime rib.  This is a definite keeper!  We served with the Blue Cheese Potatoes Delmonico and the spices, herbs of both dishes complimented each other very well. YUM!

I cooked the Garlic Prime Rib for the guys at the fire house and they loved it.  I stuck to the 120 degree suggestion and ended up leaving the meat in an opened oven because we got an emergency call just about the time we were going to eat.  I anticipated a call so I turned down the temperature a bit and guaged the internal temp as the time went on.  When it got to 120 degrees we were ready to go.  When we returned from the call the internal temperature was 124 so I felt we were safe.  The guys loved the roast and some said it was the best they ever had.  They must have been very hungry.  Anyway it turned out great.  Thanks!

Trust this recipe!  You can basically refurbish some of the "ways" to cook this, but you can't go wrong. I've tried it with more garlic, less, marinating for 2 days or 1/2 day... it always comes out tasting wonderful and everyone raves.

Better than in the restaurants and so very easy to assemble . I had a 5 lb roast so I used 6 cloves of garlic but for my own taste would've used 10.

I made this last night for Sunday dinner and it was fantastic. I thought the flavour of the garlic would be too overpowering but it was phenomenal and the added thyme was the key! I served this dish with yorkshire pudding, a little au jus and sweet potato frites. I will definitely be keeping this recipe for future use. Thanks!

Delicious. My roast was only 3.5 pounds and I ended up rubbing the mixture over the whole roast instead of just on the fatty part. This was my first time making prime rib and it was a huge success. Even the kids enjoyed it. Served with garlic wasabi mashed potatoes and aparagus.

Being an iron chef lover such as myself, I had to give this recipe a try. Now I have cooked prime rib for 10 years and have always made it my way, but this year I wanted to try something new. I could not have picked a better recipe. The flavor was just unimaginable the way the thyme and garlic fuse together and make a wonderful and quick marinade. I would suspect that it would smoke up the house so I seared mine in a cast iron pan on the stove top. That way it would not smoke up the whole house. I did find the cooking time right to the letter, but I do have a convection oven and anyone that has a conventional oven would have a longer cooking time. Everyone in the family LOVED the rib, and wanted to know wear I got it from. I now have two prime rib recipes to alternate with for the holidays. Thanks Chen for the recipe.

I was kind of disappointed with this recipe..considering everyone elses opinions..i had my expectations set for an excellent meal..This was my first attempt at a prime rib roast which i followed the recipe excact..although the flavour was good it was very tough. I may attempt it one more time giving into consideration that maybe it was the roast itself that was tough and not the recipe..

Yum!! I also used a 5 pound roast, but used the full marinade. I wouldn't change a thing about it, except to double it if I was using a 10 pound roast! Very flavorful! I only had to adjust the cooking time for the roast, but that was my fault because it wasn't all the way unthawed in the middle when I put it in the oven. This will be the only prime rib recipe that I will ever use again!

Nice rub but removing from oven at 135* and covering to continue cooking is NOT going to result "rare" or med-rare!!! It is definitely medium+. Best to remove at 120*, cover with foil until it reaches 130*. Perfect rare (not blue rare)center with medium/rare edge.

Absolutely fool proof.  After ordering prime rib at restaurants for years, I finally tried to make one at home.  It was excellent.  Definitely a keeper.

This was my first time I made a prime rib and got it on sale too.  I seasoning the meat and used butter and chopped plenty of garlic to get it ready for the oven. While it was cooking in the oven, my husband was working in the attic and could smell it and he was ready to eat. :) I explained to him in a couple of hours, we'll be eating. I was a little skeptical just like some others, but it turned out was scrumptious.  Thank you for sharing your recipe.

This rub is amazing! I used it on a bone in pork rib roast. I honestly don't know what cut it was, since I pulled it out of the freezer thinking it was beef (sad but true). Since it was a smaller roast than the recipe called for, I cut the oil and seasoning in half, but kept the garlic at 10 cloves (I LOVE garlic). I followed the recommended cooking temps, pulled it out at 150 and it was cooked PERFECTLY. (Idiots luck?). I look forward to trying it with actual prime rib!

I followed the directions, with slight mod.  Browned in pan on top of stove, then put in crock pot on high for 3 hours to internal temp of about 140.  perfect.  Guests ate 3 servings.  That's as good as it gets! 
Now I'll go clean last weeks chicken wing mess out of the oven and try again the regular way! :)

Wonderful! Took it out of the refrigerator 2-hours before roasting. Seared it at 450-degrees for 20-minutes, then 325-degrees. It took longer than 15-minutes per pound for medium rare. I had a 7.8 lb roast and it took 2-hours 30-minutes.

I made this for Christmas Eve dinner. I had to modify it a little bit, as I used only a 3 pound, boneless roast. I kept the same measurements of the ingredients, despite the smaller size and it still turned out very well.  It probably served 6-8 adults (we had 4 adults, with leftovers for Christmas).  

One thing that I did differently was to allow the roast to sit uncovered overnight in the refrigerator to dry the meat. This helps keep the juices inside during cooking. Some people sear the roast, but air drying does the same thing and with better results in my opinion.

Every New Years day I make a Prime Rib dinner with all the trimmings for my wife and myself, roasted asparagus, yorkshire pudding, and duchess potatoes,horseradish cream and Aujus. I must say this recipe rates up there with the best of them. Tha simpler the recipe the better, because all the various flavours added to it takes away from the natural flavours of the beef. 
 I have cooked Prime Rib in restaurant por the past 25 years, and have not had a bad one yet. Enjoy!! And Happy New Year to all.

I have made this over and over again, it is just the best. I personally do not like prime rib but I use this same marinade and apply it to tenderloin. I always receive rave reviews when I serve this. So looking forward to Christmas as it is our standard Christmas Dinner.

Great, easy to follow recipe. I didn't follow everything to a T adding extra garlic and pepper, my thyme was also the ground dried kind as that's all I had on hand but it was delicious nevertheless- juicy and flavorful. I mixed sour cream with some horseradish for additional sauce and served with garlic roasted brussel sprouts and Boursin cheese mashed potatoes for Christmas dinner. Not a complaint to be heard!

Great flavor, but a bit salty.  Next time I'd cut the salt in 1/2.  Cooked 20 mins at 475 then reduced to 350.  Cooked to internal temp of 145 but still very rare.  Needs to cook a bit longer.

Easy and perfect. A lot of garlic and did overwhelm the house with garlic smell at first, but the end result was delicious and perfectly medium rare. Made with the Cheese Cream Spinach (found here) that had a lot of garlic too, but both were wonderful

I decided to change my Rib Roast recipe this Christmas & settled on this one. It was a BIG hit with the family. I added onion powder to the spice mixture & rub on the rib roast the day before cooking. I cooked as directed with one exception, I had to run out for church service while the roast cooked so I reduced the oven temp to 225 until I returned.  (I know, I should never leave my oven on unattended). But I had the neighbors on standby. I definitely will make this again.

Excellent Recipe.. Only thing different is I coated the meat with Montreal Steak Seasoning. I also Cooked the meat in my Roaster over at 450* for 40 minutes and then turned it down to 250* and cooked until it was 130* internally.. Great Recipe!!

This is an easy and delicious recipe for prime rib.  The thyme and garlic really gives it so mcuh flavor.  We stared using these ingredients togeher on other foods such as chicken and it works well on that but really great recipe.

This was good, but I would definitely rub the garlic mixture over the entire prime rib.

Must agree with the other reviewers, very easy, very flavorful. I had a 7+ lb. roast, and I would probably take it out when it's at 125, 135 was a little more done than we would have liked. I had 2 teaspoons of rosemary as well!

So good! I used a slightly smaller roast, about 6 pounds, and followed the other reviewers' tips and cooked it on 460 for 12 minutes and 420 for 8 minutes, then finished roasting it at 325, taking it out of the oven at 145 degrees internal temperature and tented it with tin foil for about 20 minutes, and it ended at a nice medium. It smelled and tasted so good my boyfriend kept having me cut slivers off it while it was roasting because he couldn't get enough! 2 days later we have been eating nothing but reheated prime rib and prime rib sandwiches- we can't get enough! I poured the drippings in a saucepan and whisked in some flour and salt for gravy, and it was amazing! Ate leftovers for lunch and will be having them again for dinner :)

OMG!!!!! What a wonderful recipe.  I purchased the boneless Prime Rib at Costco and it was the best Prime Rib I have ever had.  (Better than any high dollar restaurant)  The flavor was out of this world.  Even, my kids loved it and kept going back for more.  I cooked it at 460 for 12 mins, then lower to 400 for 8 mins.  Then reduced to 325 until the internal temperature of 135, which was PERFECT med rare.  I let it rest for 20 mins.  This is a keeper and will make over and over again.  Thanks Mike.

Lovely, I made this for Christmas Eve dinner and everyone raved.  I pulled the roast out at 145 and let it rest for 30 min and it was cooked perfectly.  I was very nervous too since it was a $90.00 prime rib!   Happy Christmas!

I lost my regular recipe for prime rib and found this on allrecipes.  i have never written a review, but this recipe I just had to!  It was AWESOME!  This is not too much garlic.  After I slathered on the marinade, I got course sea salt and pressed it over this mixture.  I put it in the oven for 15 min at 500 degrees and then lowered to 325.  I cooked a 12 pound roast at 15 min per pound, and let it sit for 15 minutes when I took it out.  If you like a salty crust, I recommend patting sea salt over this.  Totally, awesome!

Great. Takes longer than you think to cook. Plan plenty of time. One hour for a 4 lb roast wasn't enough time.

I used this recipe to cook my first ever prime rib - 7.5lbs, and it came out perfectly with a few small adjustments. The rub was perfect and added amazing flavor, but we found we had to cook the roast for about 3 hours to get the medium rare doneness that we wanted. Besides that, this was the best prime rib we have ever had. THANKS!

I have made this recipe more than a couple of times, in the oven or on the BBQ, and it is hands down the best Prime Rib you will make.  It is absolutely restaurant quality and will have your dinner guests raving about it.  If you are cooking it in the house be prepared to open your windows as the 20 minutes at 500 degrees can cause the meat to smoke.  The good news is the smoke makes your house smell amazing!  This only thing I changed about this recipe is that I usually double it.

The only reason I gave this one a four instead of a five was based on the fact that I feel we should have used some injections.  The flavor was great almost all the way through.  The center however was practically flavorless.  The crust though, OMG, out of this world!

Super easy, and very good. My first prime rib..the directions didn't say to put in oven covered or uncovered (my first time remember), so I guessed and left it uncovered. cooked @ 450 for first 30 minutes, then 19min a lb @ 325...perfect. Used half the salt because my M-I-L has to watch her salt, and you would never had known.

This was exceptional!  I did a 7 pound bone-in prime rib roast.  Made the marinade for the 10 pound roast (adding a sprig of fresh rosemary from our garden).  Placed the roast on a cooling rack for cookies placed on top of a 15X10" glass lasagna pan to which I had added 2 cans of beef broth to catch the drippings.  Followed reviews of others, starting at 460 for 12 minutes, 400 for 8 minutes and 325 for the rest of the roasting time.  Took approx 2 1/2 hours to get the roast to 125 when I took it out of the oven.  Covered it in aluminum foil and residual cooking took it to around 138.  It turned out SO juicy, moist, tender, and the flavor was fabulous!  It was a perfect medium rare!  I made this for my husband's birthday and he and the family declared this one a winner!!

My Christmas Eve dinner was a grand slam because of this recipe. I served it with the Caramelized onion horseradish potatoes and my son and son-in-law both said it was the best prime rib they had ever had...Thank you for such a fabulous recipe.

Absolutely loved this.  It does take much longer to cook that I would have expected.  I was checking it every 10 minutes so I didn't overcook it, and it seemed to take forever.  4.5 lbs took well over an hour after the temp was turned down to 325.  Was excellent and worth the wait though.

I made this last Christmas...it was a different recipe than the rib roast I normally make, but had such a high rating that I had to try it. So glad I did-the roast was simply incredible. I was asked to make it again this year, so had to come to the site today and make sure to mark the recipe. Thanks so much for posting it!

this is really good!i tried the suggested oven temp by other members, and it's the way we liked it. although i don't have thyme, it's still a simple yet awesome recipe. and there's a perfect balance b/w the salt and pepper and the olive oil. the garlic is marvelous, the house smelled so good! next time, i will make this again and make sure that it's room temp. before i put in the oven.

I found this recipe about 6 months ago (at Christmas time) and have made it 10 times since. This is such a great recipe. I usually only make a 5 to 6 lb. roast so I only use 5 garlic cloves crushed through a garlic press. I also use 2 tablespoons of pepper and 1 1/2 tablespoons of salt (my hubby loves pepper) and omit the thyme.  When I take the prime rib out of the fridge, I try to bring it to room temp. or at least long enough to take the chill off since it can take a long time to cook if the meat is cold. I start cooking at 475 for about 12 to 15 min. then drop the temp to 225 for about 3 or 4 hours or until the probe reads between 147 to 149 (We like ours medium well). You just can't beat the slow roasting method. Thanks for the recipe Mike!

This is my new prime rib recipe. I had a 6 pound roast for Christmas dinner, so I halved the amount of seasoning. Roasted at 450 for 30 minutes, then reduced the heat to 325 for 15 minutes per pound. Checked it with a thermometer at the end of the cooking time and it was an absolutely perfect 140 degrees. Rave reviews from my family. Wouldn't change a thing.

Excellent recipe! This was my first time attempting prime rib at home. It came out perfectly. I had a 4.75lb standing rib roast, so I halved the recipe. I followed some of the other suggestions and did the first 20 minutes at 450 degrees (and still had a little smoke) and then turned the oven down to 325, inserted the probe for my digital thermometer, and set it for 140 (rare) so it would reach medium rare after resting. It took about 40 minutes to get to 140. I threw some baking potatoes into the oven with the roast and roasted some thin asparagus in the oven while the roast rested. With some creamy horseradish, this was an amzaing Christmas meal!

Awesome, awesome, awesome!  I made this for Christmas dinner and my family loved it!  We had a 7 1/2 lb. rib roast but I used the recipe measurements in addition to 2 teaspoons each of oregano and basil, 2 extra tablespoons of olive oil, an extra teaspoon of salt and an extra teaspoon of pepper.  Also, I marinated overnight instead of an hour before and I rubbed the marinade all over the roast instead of just on the fatty layer (I did, however, put most the marinade on the fatty layer).  As noted by others, the cook time definitely took a lot longer than 1 1/2 hours to reach 145 degrees so make sure you have a thermometer when cooking this and, for meal planning purposes, allow yourself at least two hours (or three hours if you're cooking to 155/160 for medium well).  We're not rare or medium rare red meat eaters so I let it cook until the temperature reached just under 160 degrees (F) for medium well, let it stand for 20 minutes before cutting and it was still perfectly tender and juicy.

I made this for Easter, it was fantastic.  I baked at 500 for 1hr and then shut off the oven and left in for 90 minutes.  I did NOT open the oven door.  It was Perfect!  The dried thyme was great.

I would love to rate this as a 5 star recipe, but the cooking time was WAY off! I understand that all ovens cook differently and I used a meat thermometer that you put in the meat as it's cooking. After the initial 20 min. at 500 degrees, I followed the instructions for the 10 lb. roast given in this recipe and adjusted it to my 7 pounder. The 60-70 min. at 325 was absolutely not enough time. I had to leave it in the oven for an additional hour. I did enjoy the roast, but it really could have been cooked better. Maybe the suggestion from another review that bakes 6 min. per pound at 500 degrees and turns off the oven and lets the meat continue baking with the door closed for 2 hours. I will say in favor of this recipe that the garlic spread was excellent and I will use that again on other roasts. Sorry I couldn't have enjoyed this recipe more:(

We loved it! We used about a 4 lb prime rib with bone on. And the cooking time for the 7 lb was about right for med rare. Leftovers made a great steak and eggs breakfast!

Rave reviews all around the table!  I did a 4.25lb cut so I cut the rub amount in half but did let it sit at room temp (cool house) for two and a half hours with the rub.  The crust made by the hot oven was amazing!  After 15 min at 475 degrees, I cooked it for another 35 minutes at 325, took it out and let it sit for another 15 minutes.  Perfect medium rare! I'll never use another recipe again.

Absolutely wonderful.  I loved the method - made for a very tender, juicy meat.  I bought too big a roast, though, so I had a lot left over.  I bought a crispy loaf of bread, hollowed it out and filled it with thinly sliced beef and provolone.  Wrapped it in aluminum foil and baked until hot.  Used the leftover au jus to dip it in.  Incredible.  The butcher had sliced off the bone and then tied it back together, so I used the ribs in a slow cooker chili.  Got my money's worth on that too!  Three delicious meals from one piece of (expensive) meat.  I've also used this rub on a pork roast with great results.  I subbed rosemary for the thyme, let it marinate for a few hours, then roasted in the Showtime a couple hours.  This rub will be our family favorite.  Thanks for sharing!

OMG....so amazing!!! The only thing I changed was using fresh (not dried)herbs. So I pureed garlic, fresh tyme, tarragon, and rosemary with kosher salt, pepper and olive oil in a mini food processor. I spread the paste all over the roast, brought it to room temp and then roasted. My family was speachless!!!

I followed this recipe exactly, using it to serve for a Christmas dinner party.  Had a $96 prime grade roast, bone in. Used Polder digital thermometer.  While this smelled great cooking, I was slightly disappointed that my expensive roast was somewhat tough. The timing given was faulty, also, as this took 45 min. to an hour longer than expected--not a good thing when you are having a sit-down Holiday dinner! I think next time I'll try the method where you turn off the oven entirely after the first high-heat cooking then cook again 45 min before serving.

I too followed this recipe.  I increased it a little to rub all over the 3 open sides.  Prior to the rub, I injected it with Braswell's Merlot Wine Sauce found in supermarket and a few garlic cloves.  Trust me this did not taste garlicy.  Everyone loved the meal!  My dad said it was the meal of the century.  When he thought about that statement logically - he chuckled.  Needless to say, this easy recipe made it so easy.  And the Merlot Sauce gave it such a nice flavor that no one really needed the Au Jus I made - although that was a store packet.  We all felt the meat was too good on its own.  Thanks for sharing the recipe and the comments.

Yummy!!  I just fixed this for dinner...I used a New York cut roast, 3 and 1/2 pounds.  I seared the top in 6 places, cut up 1 garlic clove and placed a piece in each cut.  I also poured some worcestire on the meat, then put thyme and pepper on it.  I tried to make au jus, but didn't have any beef broth...but I did have some ramen, so I took a beef packet out and used it.  I added with water and put in the bottom of the pan. It worked!  I also put 6 medium red potatoes in the pan and they turned out great.  This is a keeper, thanks!

Delicious! Make sure that you take the meat out while the middle is still bright pink because it will continue cooking once you take it out and let it sit. It needs to be served rare to keep the flavor!

This recipe is awesome.  The one thing I did different - after baking at 500° for 20 minutes, I add two cans of beef broth to make "au jus" for dipping.  I've also used a ribeye roast (same meat, just no bones).  It turns out just as well.

I never made prime rib before & was nervous, after reading all the reviews here I had some confidence- On 12/25 I had two 8.5 roasts.After careful thawing, The roasts were still registering 40* in the center, I was nervous but had to start. I followed the recipe, but rather than chop the garlic, I inserted a dozen whole cloves in each roast. I put both roasts in at 460* for 30 min.Promptly opened all windows in the kitchen. Two roasts searing I was expecting some smoke, there was a little, nothing awful, or alarm worthy. After 30 min. turned the roasts down to 325* and shut the windows. Not wanting rare meat, I cooked them for 2.5 hrs, removing when the temp was 150*. Covered and let rest for 20 min. Only the center slices were slightly pink. Even cooked that long the roasts were tender and juicy. I thought that since the meat was not at room temp when I started it would be a problem but it wasn't! IMO this reicpe is foolproof! For juice I loosened the pan drippings with a can of beef broth and a little red wine. Served the juice on the side. It was not even needed, the meat was so tender, flavorful and juicy. Everyone raved about the meat, it was a huge success and a new Christmas tradition for our family. Thanks CHEN for the great recipe and to everyone who reviewed it and gave tips. I could not have made the rib without reading all of the comments! (BTW-everyone was eating and raving about the whole cloves of garlic that cooked in the meat, next year all add even more!)

Wonderful prime rib recipe!! I have tried several different recipes for prime rib and like this one the best. I have used this recipe over 10 times and tried some of the different suggestions from other reviewers, the only one I would suggest is to cover the roast after baking (with foil and perhaps also a few dish towels) until it reaches a temp of 145 (this usually takes 10 minutes or so.) Never had  a"bitter" taste and always follow this recipe's cooking temps. 
Some of these reviewers  tips are ridiculous, by the way. The recipe is perfect, as is.

Excellent!!! Did mine on the grill. High heat then indirect cooking for remainder.  I used kosher salt.  Must start with the best meat your butcher can cut for you.

Best prime rib we have ever had. I served it at Christmas and was a big hit. I kept an eye on it as we do not like overcooked meat and took it out of the oven at about 135 degrees and let it rest for 20 minutes covered. It was perfect. Thank you Chen!!!

I used this recipe as a guide for oven temps and cook times.  We like to mix up a paste of olive oil, fresh thyme, dijon mustard, salt & pepper, and lots of fresh, chopped garlic.  It's always a crowd pleaser.  I got the base recipe years ago from a chef at black angus.

This was our second attempt at cooking prime rib at home.  This recipe wins hands down over the first one we tried.  I used the full recipe of spices (but less oil) for my not-quite-4 lb. roast and covered the entire roast with it instead of just the fatty layer. The cooking times were accurate for my smaller roast and we removed it from the oven at 135 degrees.  It came out perfect, wonderful flavor, beautiful appearance.  Everyone raved over it.  Thanks for sharing this recipe - we will use it on our next prime rib.

I bought a full rib roast, cut it in half and cooked the smaller half (about 6-7 lbs.) in my new 13 quart Le Creuset. I made the marinade just as described and smothered the top and the side ends. I cooked as prescribed but had to add about half an hour to get the roast to temp. Took the roast out of the oven to rest and placed the lid on the pot. Actually let it rest/cool for about an hour. The roast was a perfect medium. Everyone loved the crust and flavor of the meat.

Not as flavorful and tender as I had hoped.  I'm a little nervous to try it again.

So easy and tasty!  We were looking for a quick Prime Rib recipe and ran across this one.  Everyone was delighted!  We waited until the temp was 146 and then set on the counter where it continued to cook a bit causing it all to be med. well....perhaps may have taken it out a bit earlier for those who like a rarer roast.

Absolutely incredible!  So easy and just like eating prime rib in a 5 star restaurant!  It did take 20 additional minutes @ 350 to get 145 degree core temp.

I made this for Christmas dinner and it was really good!  However, I did the browning part at the tail end of the cooking time.

Very good prime rib - but be careful of the cooking time given. We had an 8 pound roast with bones in, and it took at least 45 minutes longer than the recipe states to get to 138 degrees (it rose to 142 after 10 minutes' rest). This was on a Chicago Christmas, so maybe sitting out for an hour in warmer climes would make it do what it's supposed to. But be sure to use a good instant read meat thermometer and have appetizers ready if it isn't done in time. Also, discard the fatty skin with the garlic - it tastes bitter if you eat it, but it gives a nice flavor to the meat. This roast is not a good candidate for gravy-making. We had cheesy-onion hash brown potato casserole with it, and it went well.

I make a lot of things off this site but this one desires a review. I made a 5.5 lb prime rib.  I did not cut back on the seasoning. I also cut slits in the fatty part and rubbed the marinade in it as another had suggested.  I used the suggestions of others and seared at 460 for 12 minutes , 400 for 8 minutes then 325 for the remainder. I used a digital Bluetooth connected Thermometer probes  for the temperature and set it to my cell phone  at 130. Once it beeped I took it out and wrapped the prime rib till it read 135.  Super easy It was perfect. I have gone to many a 5 star establishment and this is by far the best, tender and juiciest  prime rib I have ever had. My fiance said it's the best he ever had .  I made aujus  sauce on the side. Accompanied with mashpotatoes and corn on the cob.  If you have a digital probe (usually use for grilling), this was the best because I never had to open the oven not once (iGrill2 is the name of the ones I have) . I used the temp suggestions others have suggested and it comes out medium rare. PERFECTION

Like all the other reviewers have stated, this is the BEST prime rib you will ever have the pleasure of eating. I followed some others suggestions and did 460 @ 12 min then 400 @ 8 min and 325 @ 1 hour and 40 min and took it out when my thermometer read 125 and let it sit for 20 minutes. Came out a perfect medium rare. I used a 5.34 pound prime rib and did not adjust the ingredients because I love garlic, but also used fresh Rosemary along with fresh Thyme. The meat literally melts in your mouth, the flavors were OUTSTANDING. Can't wait to make this again. Thank you thank you Chef Mike for sharing one of the best recipes on this site.

This recipe needs to be checked for time. I cooked many roast and couldn't believe the time. I tried it, and I needed to cook it for an extra 1 1/2 hours!
So much for quick and easy. The roast did come out great after the additional time. I used a roast that was 1/2 lb. heavier. Please review the cooking time.
P.S. yes I checked my oven for temperature and it was calibrated.

I made this receipt today it is awesome very tasty, but please don't do what I did my Prime Rib was 20 1/2 lbs I cooked it for 5 hours at 325 degrees that was too long! I should have only cooked it for 4 hours at 325 but over all my family love it and the meat melt in your mouth. Best of all this is really simple. I notice all of All recipes are very very good and easy to prepare.

Really enjoyed this recipe! My very first time making a prime rib roast and it was delish!! I pulled it out to rest at 135* and 10 minutes later It came out to a perfect 145* medium rare. Yet  I would have preferred it closer to medium.  Next time I will cook a little longer for my taste!

First time to make this and it received rave reviews from my family.  Didn't have a meat thermometer for my 4# roast but followed other recommendations and cooked it at 450 for 20 minutes, then 250 for 2 1/2 hours.  It turned out perfectly from medium to medium rare.

Made this for Christmas dinner and it was 10 stars plus. Not certain ever had a piece of meat turn out this good. A  meat thermometer is a must. Might cut the searing temperature back as suggested by others (the kitchen was a smokey mess and the oven is really a mess)... but the results were phenominal. Thank You Chef Mike

Wonderful! Although I prefer my meat a little rare so next time I'll take it out around 110 I think.  It was a light pink in the middle and grey around the edges at 125, so a bit medium for my preference, but still so juice and delicious.   By the way, I cooked it at 460 for 12 minutes as suggested by many others, and then it took about 2 hours at 325 before it got to 125 degrees.  I had a 4 pound rib roast, so I really expected it to be faster.
Did this again and taking it out at 110 was perfect.  It was a perfect med rare.  That's my happy place.

I made this for Christmas 2012. It was divine. We didn't even bother eating all of the sides I had prepared to go with it. I followed the recipe to a "T" on an 8 lb roast. I did the 20 min at 500 (I warned the family it was going to get smoky but it really didn't) then I lowered the temp to 325 degrees. I doubled the marinade/rub so that I could pour some between where the bones were tied to the meat. Oh my Gawd, it was delicious! My son said, "This is the best meal you've made all year!" LOL, at least I got it in under the wire. For the last 30 min I put two cans of beef broth in because the pan was essentially dry as the roast was holding all the juices (which is what you want!). I used a cheap-o meat thermometer and pulled it at 138 degrees so it was rare/med rare in the center. I tented it for 15-20 min while my Yorkshire pudding was baking. The end pieces were medium and for those who wanted it cooked more, I just put slices down in the juices for a few minutes. Finger-licking good! Today I am using the bones to make beef barley soup, yum!

Yummy!  I only used 5 pound roast, but kept all other measurements the same.  As per other reviewers, "seared" the roast at 460 for 12 minutes, then 8 minutes at 400, then 350 for 100 minutes (20 minutes x 5 pounds).  I could have taken it out a bit sooner since I like my steaks rare... next time will only have it on 350 for 80 minutes.  :)

Great taste!  I used this with a 5lb. eye of round.  We did it in the electric oven and I had to hit broil in order to sear the top.  I used the timing direction as described in other reviews and it did not take long to cook.  Started at 3 and had eaten and cleaned up by 5pm!  Because of the cut of meat I used, we had to slice it thin as it was a little tough.

The gravy it made was really good.  I added beef broth from a can but would not have needed it.

I used too much garlic for some in the family as they had tummy aches the next day.  But the rest of us loved it and I think it was just me over estimating as I used chopped garlic.


Loved it!
I would use a bigger roast

Second time I made it and I get rave reviews.  Only did a 5lb rib as it was for 4 adults and that was plenty.  Took about an hour at the recommended cooking temps.  Cooked until it reached internal temp of 130-132 with Oven probe then lightly tented with foil and let it sit until we were ready to eat.  Only wish was to get more flavor inside.  But definitely produced restaurant quality prime rib. Will make again.

This recipe turn out so well I just had to express my thanks to the chef.  I used my new gas convection oven with the built in meat probe to cook and couldn't be happier with the results.  More importantly my guests love the results also, the proof was in the lack of left overs.  Thanks again.
Mike

It was my first time cooking prime rib and since I did not want to blow my budget on it, I only bought 5 pounds.  I cut the recipe in half, cooked it at 500 degrees for 20 minutes and an hour and a half at 325 degrees.  Boy, did it come out PERFECT!!!!   It was so moist and flavorful...there were no leftovers!  This recipe will become a regular on my list!

Delicious!  We had a 5 lb. prime rib, but as mentioned in other reviews, we went ahead and made the full amount for a 10 lb.  I'm glad we did since the recipe didn't seem to make that much.  Since we could spread it on thickly, it ended up with a nice crust.  We did the 12 minutes at 460 degrees, 8 minutes at 400 and 1.5 hours on 325.  Our roast seemed to cook a bit faster than 20 minutes per pound - we tested the temperature a little earlier, and we were glad we did.  Parts of it were already cooked through a bit more than medium rare.

Great recipe, simple and tasty. I added a few more spice per our taste and cooked it at 500 degrees for the 20 minutes and at 250 for 20-25 minutes per pound. I used a thermometer and took it out @ just under 140 degrees and let it sit in the oven (off) for about 20 minutes and this made for a perfectly medium-rare prime rib.

Excellent!  This was my first attempt at Prime Rib.  Very easy!  I followed the recipe with two  exceptions:  I started at 450 for 15 minutes rather than 500, and I lined the pan with 8 celery stalks before putting the meat on top.  It was a big hit and I will make it again.

WOW this is great!!  No need for a rack, just put it directly in the pan, using the bones as the rack.  I followed the directions closely with very little alterations.  I let the roast sit for one hour, after having covered it with the garlic mixture.  I roasted for 30 minutes at 450 degrees, at the recommendation of the butcher.  Also, I had a four bone, 12 pound prime rib; the butcher removed the bones and then tied them back onto the roast in order to gain the flavor without the aggravation of having to cut the bones in front of guests.  Thank goodness for the thermometer that I left in the meat.  I removed the roast at 140 degrees and let it sit for 25 minutes.  We wound up with plenty of rare meat at the center and more cooked through (med-rare) meat on the sides.  My guests and I loved this recipe and we will make it a part of our Christmas Eve tradition for years to come.  Big Thanks :)

This recipe is truly awesome.  I used a 5 lb bone-in prime rib roast, but I forgot to decrease the ingredients by half.  I was worried that the roast would turn out too salty and garlicky, but it turned out perfectly.   It did take a little longer than I expected: 20 min at 500, then 2 1/2 hours at 325 to reach 150.  Will have to set aside more time next time I make this.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

So as mentioned, it was a lot of garlic. I love garlic, so it's not a problem to me, but it might be a little overpowering for others.  I added butter to the garlic/herb mixture. My butter sauce ended up going in everything. It was that awesome. I added the butter because the coating didn't seem like enough; it didn't look like it would cover my entire roast. It didn't quite look like it would stay on the meat either; kind of looked like everything would drip right off.  There must have been something wrong with my over/thermometer. I got the internal temp to the suggested temp and my meat still ended up very rare. The skin (or, the outside layer with the sauce) tasted amazing. The inside didn't have any flavor. Again, I don't mind since I believe beef should be enjoyed with its natural tastes, but it was, again, a problem for others. Regardless, this was darn good.

This was juicy, and absolutely delicious!  I have a family of 5, and they are all very picky in their own ways.  One of my kids, that doesn't usually like meat, said she liked this recipe.  Truly amazing!  It melts in your mouth.  I wouldn't change a single thing about this recipe.  I am going to recommend this to all my friends and family.  Thanks for sharing it.

Wonderful recipe!  My 10-lb roast took more like 2 hours to be rare in the center.  I ended up cutting slices off after one hour and the resting time and put the rest of the roast back in for a while when we were eating and then sliced it and it was ready when everyone wanted seconds.  This was a HUGE hit at our house and everyone raved about it!  Thanks for posting!

This was great!  I had never made prime rib before because that cut of meat is so expensive and I didn't want to waste it.  I didn't change anything in the marinade/recipe.  I made it for my parents 40th anniversary surprise dinner.  Everyone ate and loved it, even the kids!

Great recipe! My oven tends to cook at a high heat-fast, so I needed to check on it more often. I cut the time in half and it was great! Added some beef broth and had some au jou sauce!

Awesome is the only way to describe my first experience with Prime Rib. I have to say that I was very nervous to work with a $40.00 chunk of meat but I went for it. Thyme and Garlic are the perfect flavors for this cut of meat. I will definitely be making this again!

Amazing. Did exactly what recipe said. Made a 10lb, and will pull out at 130 degrees next time and let it finish cooking while it sits. I like a medium rare.

Very Good served at two dinner parties and both times were a hit.  The Guests kept picking at the very few leftovers all night long.

This recipe was absolutely amazing. I don't think I've ever had a better prime rib. My family absolutely loved it as well. Only one note i must add as i had my butcher cut the meat off the bone and tie it rib back on, its going to take a bit longer as mine was about an hour or so longer than what the recipe called for.

I used this recipe for our Christmas Eve dinner.  It IS incredible.  My only change was to cut little pockets into the fat and insert garlic cloves, instead of adding it to the marinade.  My roast was 6 1/2lbs and was not done in the amount of time called for here.  Another half an hour turned up to 375 at the end had it done perfectly medium rare.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Simple and FANTASTIC!  With a cut of meat this expensive I would strongly recommend a good meat thermometer so you can pull it out of the oven early and let the ribs "Cruise" to the proper temp while standing.  It's important to let the internal temp come up as close to room temp before cooking as possible.  Also, I added the rub, wrapped the ribs in plastic wrap and let the goodness soak in over night.  It came out GREAT!

My first attempt at prime rib and although it took alot longer than it should have (possibly an oven problem), it came out sooooo good! Everyone at Christmas dinner loved it and I think I'll be making this instead of the usual ham for Christmas. Thanks!

I have no idea how a 10 pound prime rib cooked in this amount of time.  At the end of this time, my thermometer was not even registering on the numbers yet.  It took 2 extra hours for the center to get to medium rare.  The marinade was delicious, however.  Lesson learned:  it's much better to use two 5-pound roasts than one 10-pound roast.

5 stars for flavor and 4 stars for cooking time - I'm glad I read reviews first on cooking time.  I baked it at the 20 min/lb scale w/ a 9.5 bone in rib eye.  It came out medium, so I think I'll scale that back a little and double the marinade to put all over the roast.  This will be my new holiday specialty, thanks!

This roast turned out great, but I did scorch the garlic. Not sure if my oven is too hot or what. Guests loved it. My roast was 13 lb so I needed to cook it longer and used my thermometer alot to check when it was ready. Masde a second time this year, used garlic powder and a 10lb roast and all was well. :) Changed from a 4 to a 5.

Perfect small roast for Christmas dinner with the following changes: Used a 1-kg (2.2 lb) prime rib roast, all the garlic but only 50% of all other marinade ingredients, roasted 460 degrees x 7 min, then lower oven temperature to 325 x 1 hour.

Delicious!  Took some other posters advice and doubled the amounts of oil, salt and pepper, garlic, and thyme.  We were not disappointed and I can’t wait to make this on Christmas Eve for our family.  Thanks for this fantastic recipe!

My first time ever cooking such an expensive cut of beef. It turned out wonderful! Before I followed the recipe's directions, I cut slits in the sides and pushed garlic slivers and basil. It was a hit! I think I've created another Thanksgiving tradition for my family...although for Thanksgiving we also had turkey and ham...but with 28 people you have to :)

Wow, this is wonderful! Used a smaller 3 lb roast, cooked 10 min at 460 degrees, then 10 min at 400 degrees, then about 20 min/lb until roast was 130 because my husband likes it rare in the center. If I make it for company, I might take it out at 135 so the center isn't as rare. Thanks for the recipe. I plan for this to be our next Christmas dinner.

This recipe did not dissapoint. My son is a Marine and he and some of his fellow Marines wanted prime rib at home before they were deployed in October.  I bought a $120 prime, so I was counting on this recipe! I am not an experienced prime rib cook to say the least! Thanks, your recipe and instructions saved me (and the rib) and helped to make three Marines very happy!

Absolutely melt-in-your-mouth-fabulous!  I was really nervous about cooking this, because of the price of meat, but it turned out fantastic!  We put extra salt on the back of the bones and used a thermometer with an alarm so we never had to open the oven! A real treat for Christmas dinner.  My family is still raving--Thanks!

I made this for my Christmas Eve feast and it was DELICIOUS and so very easy to prepare. This was my attempt at making Prime Rib and I couldn't have picked a better recipe...IT WAS A SUCCESS! It made for great left-over sandwiches and salads as well! I will definitely make this recipe again and won't change a thing.

Much, much more than 5 stars!!!  It was so delicious and tender.  I can't wait until next Christmas to make it again.  I did have a little problem.  I bought a 6 lb rib roast.  I cooked it for 15 minutes at 450 and then I turned it down to 325.  I can't remember exactly how long it took but I think it was at least 1 1/2 hours.  My dinner ended up being about 2 hours late.  It was done to perfection and everyone raved about how good it was so I won't complain too much about eating at 8 on Christmas nigt!

I have been making this for 2 years. I follow the recipe to a tee everytime. My prime rib is between 8 - 14 pounds and comes out perfect everytime. The only comment I would like to add is make sure you take the prime rib out of the fridge 1 1/2 hours before you cook it. Also, when cooking at 500 for 20 min. do not open the oven door at all. Just reduce the temperature to 325 without opening the door. This is what causes the prime rib to take much longer to cook. Just leave the door closed without peeking in.
After the 1 1/2 hours then check the temperature. Awesome and simple recipe.

Absolutely perfect! I only had a 3 lb. roast and used the same cooking instructions except for roasting it for only 45 minutes at 325 degrees. It came out well done, but fortunately still moist. Next time with the smaller roast I might roast it at 500 degrees for 10 minutes then roast at 325 for 30 minutes. I look for trying it out at a medium well doneness!!

I made this last year and it was fabulous.  Pretty sure I made it as directed.  Trying again this year and will be using more of the garlic combo for the outside.  As I recall the cooking times are off but use the thermometer and you should be good to go!  We went to someone else's house and took this with us in a glass dish, wrapped in tin foil, covered in towels to retain heat.  It  had been out of the oven well over 1 hour before we served it and it was still perfect.  Everyone loved it.   Making it again this year (will be a tradition on Christmas) and can't wait to see how it is when served right out of my own oven instead of traveling around town first!

I left my 4.5 roast stand out for over 2 hrs. to get it to room temp. Cooked at 500 deg. for 20 min then 325 till the temp. reached 120 which took little over an hour. Next time I will take it out when the temp hits 125-130 since it was a little under done for med. but other then that it was perfect.

Good but I was disappointed after seeing 5 stars and reading all the wonderful review's. Not much flavor thoughout. Also the cooking time is way off.  It takes much longer.

Thanks for great recipe. I made this last Thanksgiving. I make both a 15 lb Turkey and 10-12lb prime rib. The Prime rib is never left over with this recipe. 
I got a very fresh roast at my local Butcher-they do not cut it off the bone until pick up (they tie it back to the bone so that it falls away nicely when cooked. It marinated well and cooked great. Will be using recipe every year. My family loves Garlic so it is a hit.
Great recipe but if you have and can splurge for local/freshest cut meat at Butcher it is quite a holiday treat.

WOW, WOW, WOW is all I can say.  No changes needed this was the best prime rib, better than anything I have every tasted at a restaurant.  No other recipe needed for prime rib.  The seasonings would probably turn any steak or chicken into a work of art.

Definately the best prime rib I've had. (The guests had the same sentiments). The recipe did take an hour extra and was still very rare. I followed directions precisely and left out at room temp. Maybe a difference in house temps or humidity? Still the best ever, tho.

I had guests over and this was the best!  I have a thermometer that you can leave in the roast and shut the oven door, I took it out at 130 degrees and by the time I cut it, it was perfect and the crust was really good with the 500 degrees for 20 minutes, yummy!  It was quite impresive for my first time guests!

This is honestly the best prime rib I've ever had, and my husband (a meat and potatoes expert)agreed!  I had an 8# prime rib, and it actually took about 2.5 hours to get to 140 degrees, so make sure your sit-down time is flexible.  I'll definately use this recipe again. Thanks!

This is an excellent recipe. I love the crust that the marinate makes. It took a little longer to cook than I thought it would. I cooked a 5 1/2 lb roast for about 75 mins.

It was very VERY good!!  I cooked a 5 1/2 pound prime rib. I followed other reviews and cooked at 460 for 12 minutes, 400 for 8 minutes and 325 for the remainder until the internal temperature hit 130 and set until the internal temperature was about 135.  It was perfect!  I also add a can of beef stock and corn starch to the pan to make gravy.

I tried this on my Prime Rib this year for something different.  I am not new to cooking a good Prime Rib, I just wanted to try a different mixture.  I saw the ratings on this one so thought I would give it a try.
First, as others have mentioned the cook time is off.  I adjusted to my normal, as the real key to Prime Rib is when you take it out.  I like mine Rare in the middle, and then you have variations from Rare to Medium.  
Second, I didn't feel that it had a whole lot of flavor compared to what I was used to so, needless to say I think I will go back to my original recipe for Prime Rib.    I will post it shortly...
Really didn't live up to the ratings for me...

This is the first time I've made prime rib, and it was perfect except for the fact that the garlic on top was a little burnt; I think my new oven runs a little high or I should have used real garlic instead of jarred chopped garlic.  Otherwise, FANTASTIC!  Thank you.

I did not deviate from this recipe at all... and it was perfect!!! I got an entire rib (then had it de-boned & trimmed) so it had no fat on it and it was still delicious! Mine was 11 lbs and I pulled it at 41 degrees.  All my guests commented that it was better than 5 star! This recipe will be used over again and again at my house! Thank you!

This is hassle free and delicious. Meat remains moist. Meat is best sliced very thin. Best to use a slicer.

I chose to make this recipe for a family get together based on the reviews I had read.  Hands down this is the best meal I have ever cooked.  This was also my first time cooking prime rib and I was very nervous, but now this will be something made in my home regularly.  I cut the top and poured Worcestershire sauce then followed the rest of the recipe.  My guests said this was the best steak ever!!!

I made this for a Thanksgiving dinner and it was the first time I've ever made a prime rib and it was absolutely fantastic. I got so many compliments I was blushing!! Seriously speaking though it was a very easy and delicious recipe.

I have never cooked prime rib before and after alot of searching I came upon this website for a recipe. I followed the details to the letter. I bought a temp probe from Bed Bath and Beyond as suggested by a reader, I even needed a roasting pan, but $130.00 bucks later (this included the meat and garlic)I had made a great dinner for my family. My wife now wants me to cook Christmas dinner. Thank you to everyone that has commented on this site as it really helped me make an informed decision. 

I will be making this on a regular basis.

Made this yesterday for our Sunday meal and it is probably the best prime rib I've eaten.  It was just my husband and I, so we used a 4 pound roast and cut the merinade in half.  Otherwise followed the recipe to the letter and it was perfect.  I thought maybe the outside of the roast would be burnt and tough, but it wasn't.  This is a keeper and will be made in my house again and again!!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

A delicious recipe! Be sure to let the roast sit out and reach room temperature, instead of cooking straight from the refrigerator, it will cook more evenly instead of coming out too well done outside and too rare in the middle. Don't try to cook by time, use a meat thermometer, a cheap guarantee of peace of mind about the doneness. The time estimate will help plan when dinner will be ready, but the meat thermometer will tell you when your roast is perfect!

I made this for the "men" for our annual Daytona 500 party. They loved it. It was just scrumptious. I did have to cook it quite a bit longer than instructed, but I just watched my meat thermometer.

This was a major hit.  I had a 4 1/2 lb roast, so used the suggestion of using six cloves of garlic but keep the other ingredients at the full amount.  I also used the suggestions of scoring the meat with X's and drizzling a little worcestershire sauce on it.  It was no where near room temperature in an hour and took much longer to cook than expected.  I cooked it until the meat thermometer said 135, took it out and let it sit for 15 minutes.  It was cooked perfectly.  Very tasty and easy to make.

I can't believe I forgot to rate this recipe!  This is the BEST prime rib I've tasted and my in-laws loved it! I always prepare Prime Rib for Christmas using my tried and true recipe.  This year I decided to try something different and am I glad I did.  The meat was moist, flavorful and cooked to perfection.  I definitely recommend using a meat thermometer to ensure that the meat is cooked to your liking.  Don't forget to let the roast rest for about 20 minutes before you serve so that you don't lose all the juices on your cutting board.  What else can I say, this recipe is perfect as is!  Definitely a KEEPER ~ Thanks Chen!

I always score "X's" in my roast and generously pour Worshestersire over it and makes for really tender meat.  The high temp in the beginning is also key for tender meat with a nice crust on it.I also use kosher salt which has a nice flavor as well. And always check the temp with a meat thermometer to assure the desired doneness you like.

I was a prime rib virgin until trying this recipe. Have made this three times now and each time people moan after taking the first bite!  I cook this to an internal temp between 130/135 and tent it with foil to raise the temp to 145 degrees for perfect medium rare.  This is absolute perfection and has become a holiday tradition.

So good, although this was my first time having prime rib, so I have no basis for comparison!! Too bad  the meat is soo $$ or I would make it more often! I used 5.5 lbs and kept the other ingredients the same. Cooked at 480* for 20 min, then at 325* for about 75 min. Took out when temp. reached 135*, then covered with foil and a couple of kitchen towels for 10 min, when at that point, it reached 145*

Soooo good and soooo easy.  I will make this twice a year at least.  This recipe will definitely go in my "permanent" collection. 

2 Tips: once I took roast out of the oven, the temp on my meat thermometer continued to climb after it sat out for a minute or two.  Recommend taking out of oven at 135 degrees.
I made a wonderful gravy by adding water, one beef boullion cube and some cornstarch to the roasing pan, over  med heat on stove.

I am giving this 5 stars because the seasoning & roasting @ 500 are the core of what makes this so good & different. However... I am completely confused by the room-temperature estimate (an hour was not long enough), and the cooking time (mine took 45 mins longer than recipe called for). Mind you: I like really rare Prime Rib! I have a cook's thermometer inside my range, so I know the oven temp was correct throughout. My roast was only 6 3/4 pounds, so the resting & cooking times should have been more than ample! Regardless, it turned out wonderful and was worth the confusion.

My husband and I served this beauty for Christmas dinner. We had never cooked a rib roast and were extremely nervous because we had to uphold the standards of my parents who have been preparing rib roasts for years. This recipe did not disappoint! More rave reviews in fact my Dad will be preparing the roast "our way" in the near future. My husband especially loved the garlic morsels that toasted on top of the roast. I used 12 cloves of garlic (the entire bulb) added a tablespoon of crushed garlic from the jar and sprinkled a generous amount of granulated garlic(4 tablespoons) on top of the entire roast. Is there such a thing as too much garlic? If you want the inside of the roast to be pink, I would not suggest setting it out for more than 30 minutes before cooking. This is what my parents had done and their roasts had little or no pink in the center. Our 16 lb roast (which included the ribs) took approximately 3.5 hours to cook. We removed the roast when the thermometer reached 135 degrees. We cut very generous portions of about 3/4 inch and still had leftovers for every one of our 6 guests to take home. We served the meal with fresh baked crescent rolls, King Crab Sweet Corn Chowder from Costco and 2 other recipes from this site, the excellent smothered green beans and roasted garlic mashed potatoes. This was truly a WOW meal!

After I made this for my boyfriend's birthday, he said it was so good he would like to marry me. I cooked my 3.5 lb roast at 325 for about an hour and a half until the meat thermomator read 120. After it sat for 10 minutes with foil on top the internal temp raised to 135 and it was perfect.

Love this marinade, Chen.  I used fillet steak and was in a rush, so I only marinated for 15 minutes maximum.  I used some fresh thyme and this worked well.  For medium rare, 45 minutes at 200C worked well for us.  I added button mushrooms in the last 10 minutes of cooking and they soaked up the flavours.

I served this with the Broccoli With Lemon Almond Butter recipe from this website as well as snap peas in a honey, garlic and butter sauce.  Perfect for a quickish meal but also for guests.

I am a vegetarian, but my husband's favorite food is prime rib and he LOVED this! Says it's the best he has ever had and he plans to have me make it when we have guests so he can share the goodness with his friends. This is the first I've ever made, but he has tried many in different restaurants.TIPS:1. A meat thermometer is essential. 2. I did a 3.5 lb. roast. Baked for the recommended hour. Took it out of the oven at 130 degrees. It took 30 minutes to rise to recommended 140 degrees, which hubby said was perfectly medium rare. Thanks, Chen!

I made this last weekend for guests, and I have to say that this was hands down, THE BEST prime rib I have ever eaten.  I made a mistake and rubbed the garlic all over the roast, not just on the fatty part, but it was a happy accident.  This roast is out of this world.  We all fought over the bones, and not a scrap was left.  Thank you Chen, you are my new best friend!

Like many others, this was my first attempt at making prime rib. The roast turned out beautifully, tender, juicy and delicious. The recipe was easy to follow, but like others I found the cooking time to be much longer than stated in the recipe. Be sure to allow for this if you are preparing the recipe for entertaining or when timing is important. Cost was another factor that was a concern to me. My local grocery did not have prime rib, so I went to a butcher. I paid $12.99 per pound -- that is about $130 for a roast the size called for in this recipe. That is one special meal! Certainly this is a special occasion recipe, but I wonder if it is worth that much? The flavors were wonderful and I think the cooking technique may work beautifully on a less expensive cut of meat. We also had trouble slicing the meat to picture-perfect perfection and our presentation was therefore lacking. In addition, prime rib is meant to be served rare. If preparing this meal for a crowd, you may have some guests who simply cannot stomach the idea of rare meat. That's a concern when cooking for a crowd - some guests may only eat meat when nearly well done, others may prefer very rare meat. Because of cost of the meat and the difficulty in meeting the various preferences of your guests, I give this recipe just four stars. Ease of preparation and taste merit five stars, hands down! I'm looking forward to trying the garlic marinade and the cooking method on a less expensive roast.

STOP THE INSANITY!...LOL   ALWAYS CLEAN THY OVEN BEFORE THOU ROASTS A PRIME RIB!  It’s not the roast smoking...it’s the stuff burning OFF the inside the oven that’s smoking. P~U! This is the voice of experience speaking!  I’ve used this recipe multiple times with perfect success each time. 

PRIOR TO ROASTING- I scored the fatty top of the roast and rub the marinade on the meat (and into the scores).  I make the marinade according to directions.  For the larger 10# Prime Rib double the marinade.  

#1. VERY FIRST STEP – A MUST FOR NEWBIE COOKS!  Place an OVEN SAFE meat thermometer in the roast center (but not touching any bones).  Don’t be opening and closing the oven door peeking (it causes too much heat fluctuation). Place the thermometer so that you can easily see it from the oven door.  Start the roast at 450° for 20 min.  Reduce the heat to 325° for approx 20 min per pound.  HOWEVER, you MUST rely on the meat thermometer!  I remove the roast when the thermometer reaches 135° - immediately (and tightly) cover the roast with aluminum foil – and let it rest for about 15-20 min.  The juices settle back in the roast, and the internal cooking temp will rise about 8-10°.  It will be perfectly done.  Very rare on the inside, and just done on the outside.  Everyone gets a slice that suits their tastes.

??? ~Done to PERFECTION every time! and Deeeeeeeeelish!

WOW!  I was nervous about this because my last attempt at a prime rib was only ok...but this made me look like the cooking goddess everyone thinks I am (thanks to allrecipes).  I seared the roast for 20 min @ 460 as other reviewers suggested and my cook time was about double the stated time...but I had a 16lb roast, so it was expected.  I would never hesitate to use this recipe again.  THANK YOU!

I usually don't like to review a recipe unless I can give it 5 stars, but I felt it might benefit somebody else if I did. 
 I have had Prime Rib for Christmas dinner ever since I can remember, I have to say that the flavor of the roast was excellent. However, the time it took for my roast to cook was almost 2 1/2 hours longer than the recipe recommended. Having guests over this was a little embarrasing because I did not know when exactly the meat would be done. So just beware that cooking time may vary by a lot.

I have used this many times with good results. The last few times i tried some dry rubs-- both from a company called Big Bubbas Rubba. I used their Chipotle rub and their Cajun rub. 
if you use the rubs then leave out the salt and pepper!!

I used a 5lb roast, but kept the rest the same. This turned out very good except that the thyme was a little too strong.  Next time I will make it with 1tsp instead of two. Thanks!

Absolutely awesome!  We've tried four other prime rib recipes from this site and TV, but this is definitely the best!  We only had a 3.5 lb roast,  but we used about 3/4 of the marinade and it turned out spectacular! Thanks for the great recipe!

When you have a good cut of beef, I would suggest Angus prime..this is the perfect compliment.  For those of you that try to skimp on the cut....good luck...a good butcher is a must here.  I cooked to 137 Farenheight and it rose 7 degrees while resting.  I had a 9 pound roast and I had one cut of rare--two of medium rare 3 of medium  and 2 of well done.  Great easy recipe--I followed others by covering the entire roast with the garlic as well as I s=added a few tablespoons of dry mustard---Praise from all!

THE BEST PRIME RIB ROAST EVER!!!!!!!!!!!! Unbelievably tender and juicy.  The cost of the roast pales in comparison to the taste you get from the meat.  If I could afford it, I would make this roast twice a week.  Thank you Chen for this awesome recipe.

Absolutely delicious. I've never been confident making prime rib but this recipe is sooo easy! I took everyone's advice about using a 460 degree oven instead of 500 for the first 20 minutes. I made 2 pieces (6+ and 4+ lbs.). It took a total of 3 1/2 hours to get med-medium rare (took the roast out when internal temp was 145 degrees and let it rest for 30 minutes before carving). YUM!

I have tried this recipe twice and it is just the best tasting. My family loved it. Everyone should try it just once and I'm sure you'll be hooked and just keep using it cause it's so easy and gives so much flavor to the roast.

We tried this recipe for Thanksgiving.  My husband and I love to grill so we did it over indirect heat on a gas grill and it was fantastic.  We started with a 4 1/2 lb. prime rib and it took a little over an hour with side burners on medium-high.  The center was quite rare and the edges were deliciously crusty.  This is the best way I've found to do a prime rib - and no mess in the oven.

This was our first attempt at cooking prime rib and we thought this recipe was just okay.  Although we love garlic and use it a lot, we found the flavour of garlic to be quite overpowering in this dish and would definitely cut it in half next time.  We also only added 1 tbsp of olive oil as we did not want a greasy au jus when serving.  I would try this dish again, only next time with less garlic.

Came out very good and tastes great!!! I don't want to smoke up my house so my oven is set to 425F for 30 minutes. The only thing is by the time I took out the prim rib, the bottom part was very badly burnt!!! Otherwise, very good and tasty!!! Even better than the restaurants! Will definitely make again!

I made this for Easter Dinner and have been told by several guests that it was better than any prime rib they had ever had.  I followed the temperature suggestions and the roast came out perfectly.

Unbelieveable how much flavor such a simple recipe can generate! I made this for a last minute dinner party and plates were scraped clean- it was PERFECT and SO easy. 

I used a roast half the size but kept the recipe the same, and rubbed the whole cut of meat not just the top.

sheer heaven- thank you SO much!!!

The ABSOLUTE BEST prime rib roast I have EVER had ANYWHERE HANDS DOWN!!! I have written this recipe into my recipe book to keep and pass on to family members for years to come. I may even make this for our Christmas dinner this year. A few compromises were made while making this recipe although nothing too extreme. I allowed my roast to sit out at room temperature for 4 hours prior to seasoning as I was intending to use a different recipe which called for a roast at room temperature for four hours. After seasoning I immediately placed it in the oven in a 9x13 glass baking dish lined with foil. I also placed foil over the top of the roast for 20 minutes at 500 degrees Fahrenheit, reduced the temperature to 325 degrees Fahrenheit and continued to roast for 1hr then removed foil and continued to roast for another 15 to 20 minutes. Although difficult, I did allow it to stand for 10 to 15 minutes before slicing to allow it to retain the juices. Extremely delicious and juicy!

I cooked a seven pound prime rib, used same amount of spices as the recipe calls for (actually will double it next time it was so delicious), and it was delicious! After the 500 degree searing for thirty minutes, I turned the oven down to 325 degrees and cooked an additional 13 minutes per pound. My meat temp came out at 125 and after a ten minute rest, it was a perfect temp (as in medium rare) of 130. This is so fantastic. For best taste definitely get the prime rib with the bone in it.

It was the most amazing Prime Rib I have ever had!!! I did what a lot of people in the comments suggested  baking it for 12 min oh 460 then down to 400 for 8 min and then at 325 until its to your liking and it has come out amazing every time I make it. All my family agreed it's the best! I've used the same amount of ingredients (10lb) for a 3.7lb, and 5.4lb roast and its amazing each time. I don't think you need to adjust the seasoning of yu have anything smaller than a 10lb. roast, but then again I loooove a ton of garlic so maybe it's just me. Either way this is the best recipe I've ever gotten.

Thank you Chef Mike for making the great chef this Christmas dinner although I rarely cook and never made the prime beef before. I followed your direction exactly and it turned out perfectly.  I cant ask for a better prime rib. I ate at so many restaurants, some are very high end, and my Christmas Garlic Prime Rib - with your direction - was much better.  It's the best Prime Rib ever!  Thank you so much again Chef Mike.

This is a very easy and super delicious I tweaked the recipe and added 1/4 cup of horseradish and paprika to it here's a good tip I let my roast sit out for 1 to 2 hours before the crust it makes loosens up the tendons and relaxes the meat besure to turn your fans on because the garlic and horseradish will make your eyes water but it's worth it,enjoy

This is my all time favorite prime rib roast recipe. The only thing i do differently is add some powdered Colman's mustard to the rub for the crust.

This recipe is the BOMB!  Simple and delicious!  The bark is absolutely SCRUMPTIOUS. Made "as is" even though we only used a 5 lb roast (made the crust that much yummier).  I like medium rare but hubby prefers medium so 135 was a little too rare overall (used a meat thermometer) so will probably take it out at 137 or 138 next time but otherwise, wouldn't change a thing.  Thanks Chef!

I made this last year for our New Years Eve dinner for my husband and my son!  I made it exactly as it was written here, and oh my gosh.  It was the most heavenly flavor.  The three of us like garlic and the flavors mixed so well, my teenager went on about the taste for days! I served it with lobster tails, baked potatoes, cesear salad.  We had cheese cake available for dessert, but no one could touch that after this meal!  Today is New Years Eve and I'm here online looking at this recipe again.  Making it tomorrow as outlined.  Going to serve with garlic shrimp this year.  Best reciped for prime rib I've ever tasted.  Awesome!

I prepared this recipe today, December 26, 2013 (it was suppose to be Christmas Dinner, but we were still full from our family brunch) and it was amazingly good! Although my roast prime rib was only 5 lbs. I still prepared the marinade as written, but inserted slivers of garlic throughout the meat, wrapped it,  and let it sit overnight in the frig. Prior to cooking I let the meat come to room temp and cooked it at 450 for 20min and then 325 for 3 hours - I don't care for rare meat so I cooked it longer than the recommended time. The Prime Rib was tender, flavorful, and moist! My daughter says it was almost as good as my sister's roast but I say it was 10xs better - lol! I served it with garlic mashed potatoes, glazed carrots, and rolls.  Thanks for sharing!

This was my first experience cooking a prime rib roast.  I have an internal thermometer in my oven and learned in never gets above 430 degrees, so I preheated my oven and put in in for 30 mins rather than 20 before decreasing the temperature.  I also left a digital thermometer in the roast so I would be sure not to over cook it.  This was absolutely delicious, a huge hit and so easy to do!!  I would recommend this recipe, especially to newbies and less experienced cooks like myself.  This is how I will always cook my roast- it was so tender, moist and perfectly med-rare.

This is the way to do it!  My 4 lb roast was spot on. 460 for 12, 425 for 8 and 325 for 60. It left a little juice for the gravy and perfect resting time for the Yorkshire Pudding.  Who could ask for anything more?  Hands down the best I've done.

Absolutely, hands down, the best prime rib I've had in my home or at a restaurant. I inserted about 15 fresh garlic slices in the meat, them added the marinade and let it sit in the fridge overnight. They'd the only alteration to the recipe as written. I served Sandra Lee's au jus as a side. My family were extremely complimentary about the meal which made my heart fill  with happiness !!

Another reviewer wondered why this got so many good reviews because it is so standard.  It is standard, and that's a good thing if you want to have a delicious prime rib.  I use this recipe every Christmas, and whether I use the whole amount of marinade, or any lesser amount, it's always good.  It may be standard, but in my book, it's the standard for making delicious prime rib.  By the way, it's also good with rosemary rather than thyme.

While a small strip of this was tender and well seasoned, the rest was tasteless and tough.  I realize that prime rib is tricky to make well this recipe won't accomplish it.  About the only thing that worked was that it was indeed medium well.

I've made prime rib roasts for about 10 years and have finally found the perfect recipe- it is this one. Best prime rib ever!! And, I will even admit, that I cooked a roast that had been in the freezer for 3 months- (don't judge!) still it was amazingly perfect. Excellent recipe.

very good rub
as long as you start with a good rib you will be ok
i had my butcher cut the meat off the bone and then tie it back on so i can cook it on the bone
this makes it very easy to serve when done you just cut the string and the meat falls away from the bone

I read every review on this and a million other prime rib recipes.  I have my Kitchen bouquet seasoning but for the life of me was having the hardest time deciding which cooking method to use.  I'm glad I chose this one.  I let my roast sit out until it achieved room temp.  It took approximately 2 1/2 hours to get between 60-70 degrees.  When I took it out of the fridge I immediately spiced it with basted kitchen bouquet, fresh cracked pepper, a little bit of sea salt and garlic powder.  I put this in the oven (if your oven isn't 100% clean, turn on the exhaust fan)at 500 degrees for about 7 minutes per pound-uncovered, by the way.  I turned on the oven light to watch it and make sure it was crusting nicely without opening my oven door.  I turned off the oven and locked the oven door (to keep my nosy children out and prevent burns) and let sit in the oven for 90 minutes.  I took it out and put the foil over it for approximately 30 minutes while I made the veggies and roasted red potatoes.  The temperature was a perfect medium rare, just the way we like in my home.  I used the leftovers today for French Dip sandwiches with fresh baked bread and french onion soup and it was incredible!  I can't wait to make this again. Everyone loved it and we have a new Christmas dinner tradition.

amazing!  I used extra garlic and was out of thyme, so I used Italian seasoning.  I paid close attention to pulling the roast out at 138 so it was cooked perfectly.  yum!

My very first prime rib roast - and it turned out wonderfully! I got a 3.6 lb roast (boneless) and cooked at 460 for 12 m, reduced to 400 for 8 minutes, and continued at 325 for 85 minutes, with the ending internal temp at 150 degrees. yum!

Rubbed a 5lb roast using only 3 cloves garlic and replaced the thyme with steak spice.  Followed instructions for cooking to 150 F. then removed it from oven to let rest. Absolutely perfect.

I cooked a 5# prime rib for our Christmast dinner last night using this recipe, it was superb! We also had the usual fare...slow roasted turkey, macaroni and cheese, oven rosted potatoes, and a mixture of greens.  I saved this recipe for prime rib in addition to the salt encrusted version, but in the end I opted to work with this recipe. Thanks for sharing this simple yet delicious recipe; Happy Holidays to all.

Last year, a freak ice storm kept us from traveling, so we quickly threw together a Christmas dinner and this recipe was the centerpiece. It was such a hit, the family members who couldn't attend last year were asking me if I was making my special prime rib again this year and if they were invited. This is quite a compliment when you consider my wife does all the cooking and this is the first time I had ever tried anything like this.  7.5 lb roast. I used the same amt of ingrediants as listed in the recipe and everyone raved over the flavor. Like everyone else, the cooking time was closer to 2 hrs after the initial 20 minutes on high heat.  So easy. So good. I've already been asked to take care of next Christmas's dinner.

I made Christmas Dinner for the first time and decided to make Prime rib as opposed to the traditional turkey and ham. Saw this SIMPLE recipe and dinner was phenominal! My parents and everyone else loved, loved, loved the crust. The recipe is super easy and the final result is just as good if not better then what I've had at any restaraunt. I cannot express how happy I am to have found this recipe!

First time making prime rib and was very nervous seeing the roast was very expensive that I bought from a local butcher shop ($$$$$).  Followed recipe's marinade and plastic wrapped the roast overnight in the fridge.  Let the roast sit ut at room temperature for 45 minutes.  Preheated oven for 450 degrees. Cooked it for 12 min at 450 degrees, then 8 min at 400 degrees, then 100 minutes at 325 degrees. Used a meat thermometer and pulled roast out of the oven when it read 150 degrees (thermometer said 160 for medium).  Allowed roast to sit and cook via residual heat for 15 minutes for slicing.  It was medium rare but regardless it was very moist. For those who wanted it cooked more, they were able to give it some heat to reach desired liking.  Next time, I'll wait until thermometer reads 160+ before removing roast from the oven. Overally, amazing recipe, and everyone loved it. Will definitely make this again!!!

I have made prime rib a few times and it was OK.  I followed this recipe, and it was one of the best meals I've ever had.  Unbelievable is all I can say.  The only thing that I did differently is that I took it out of the oven when my digital thermometer reached 140 degrees.  For me, it was perfect.  I might take it out just a touch earlier the next time, but don't sweat it.  You can't get it much better.  Best prime rib I've EVER had, including fine restaurants.  I would give it more stars if I could.  8 lb roast with bones, left the ingrediants the same.

Fabulous!  Turned a Select grade prime rib into something out of this world.  I did add a bit more salt, rubbed the sides, and did the sear for 12 min at 460 and 8 min at 400 ... this is going to be the go-to recipe for roasts from now on!!!

Delicious rib rub.  Make sure to use fresh garlic (not processed minced garlic) for the most authentic garlic flavor.  If you're high altitude like we are, you can expect to add more time to the recipe.  We gave our little 5.9 lb roast the full 75 minutes after the initial high temp roast... and an additional 20 minutes to a blood rare state when we gave up and started eating.  Truly the perfect meal.  We will treasure this recipe

The garlic is overpowering in this version of a traditional prime rib.  I'd suggest at least halving the amount of garlic.

After enduring a family members rock-hard overdone prime rib year after year, I made it this year.  It was just as good as I've had at any steak place.  The outer garlic crust was perfect.  I did follow previous posters directions to start it at 460 degrees (I did it for 15 min), and then turned it down to 425 for the last 5, and then to 325.  It was a hit.

I had never made a prime rib before and it was DELICIOUS!  The smell in the kitchen while it was cooking was to die for.  I made just as the directions called for.

So easy!  An expensive cut of meat, but if it's always this good, I'll be sure to make it again!  The only change: I took it out of the oven at 120 degrees on an instant read thermometer and let it rest for 10 or 15 minutes.  The residual heat cooked it to a perfect medium rare to medium.  Leaving it in until 130 degrees would make it much too well done for my tastes.  I also dropped the temp after 15 minutes to prevent the garlic from charring.  Delicious!  I will definitely make this again.

Thank You! I was assigned to cook two prime ribs for a big family dinner and decided to go with this recipe based on the reviews. It was a first time for me with prime rib. I followed it exactly except for adding a bit of fresh rosemary. I did one in the oven and one on the Weber. both were excellent.

Made this last night and loved it! I used a smaller cut of meat, more like 3 lbs and adjusted the ingredients and time. It came out perfect.

I have been using this recipe for years for our annual Chrismas prime rib.  We have loved it every time.  I don't think that you can screw this up.  Just make sure to take it out of the oven at 115 or so.  I like it pretty red inside.  I also add rosemary to the list of spices.  The drippings go into the yorkshire pudding, which is then also transformed to awesomeness.

Very flavorful recipe, I did find though that mine turned out a little dry. Because I cooked it as stated in the recipe (which took MUCH longer than stated and mine was only 8lbs) by the time it had sat out for a few minutes with the temperature still rising it was overcooked. I would recommend taking it out at a slightly lower temp.

Awesome recipe...thanks so much for sharing!!! Had looked for days for a good prime rib recipe to use for Christmas Dinner, and came across this one. We had never made a prime rib before and were a little nervous, but it came put perfect!!! The only thing that I did differently is that I rubbed the seasonings on in the morning and let it sit all day in the fridge wrapped up in saran wrap. Be sure to let it set out for at least an hour to get to room temp before baking. Will definately make this again for special occasions!

The rub is outstanding!!  Adjusted qty. to suit my 4.5 lb roast (only 2 of us eating).  Next time, I will apply the rub, wrap tightly in saran wrap and let it sit at least a day, maybe 2.  We are fighting over the end pieces as the flavors did not penetrate well enough into the center.  A longer marinade time before baking should cure that!  Oh - mine started smoking EARLY ON in only a 450 degree oven, so unless you want to hear your smoke detectors sing out, I'd adjust the temp on step one to only 425-450.  Still came out with a beautiful crust.  Trust your meat thermometer rather than the stated time.  We pulled ours when it was just at 130 and let it rest.  Perfect Med Rare and OMG good!!

I was sooo pleased with the way this turned out!  I used a 4 1/2 pound roast, so I cut down the marinade accordingly.  Other than that I followed the instructions exactly.  It turned out absolutely wonderful.  I served it for Christmas dinner to my son and his family who hadn't been able to be home for years.  I couldn't have asked for it to be better!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I am really not good with nice cuts of beef. However I really wanted to make prime rib for Christmas dinner so I took the plunge! I bought an eight pound boneless. I prepared as suggested. Mentally prepared myself to adher to the thermometer...no overcooking no matter what! I told my husband to support me in this no matter what I saw coming from the roast after taking it from the oven. Well, the roast was perfect! I cooked it until the temperature reached an internal temp. of 145 degrees. I set it to rest as instructed. Even though the juices looked red I refrained from popping it back in the oven, which is my usual act. Cutting into the roast was fantastic! There were cuts that were cooked to everyones taste! I was very satisfied with the results!

I am going to give this a 5 star rating for flavor alone. I modified for a 7.90 lb rib-roast. Other reviews said to lower the initial heat to 450 (I did) then lowered the heat again 325  and roast-per pound, etc. After resting 20 min, it turned out  med/med-well. (I do have an old O'keefe stove that is smaller interior) I will make this again and take it out 30 min early. Tip: mix all spices, slather on top--then pack-on with rock salt so the garlic doesn't burn!!!  The salt will crack off later and not bee over-salty. (brainstorm) I don't like it bloody but do like it med-rare. Don't be afraid to try this..when in doubt, back off 30 min on the cook time!  This recipe makes incredibly, tender prime rib! All I heard from the men were high praises. Enjoy!

I really liked the results of starting at a high temp for a crispy brown crust, then lowering to 325 degrees for a moist, juicy roast.  I made a couple small changes:  substituted 1/4 c. dijon mustard for the oil, and cut the meat off the bone before cooking.  I smeared the garlic/mustard/spices all over the meat, and set it back on the bones to bake.  My 6 pound roast required the 20 minutes at 500 degrees, plus 12 minutes per pound at 325 degrees.  The flavor was fabulous!  I served it with 1 cup stiffly whipped cream plus 1/3 c. horseradish sauce.  The leftover bones and drippings are going into the crockpot for a beef barley soup.

Absolutely wonderful and didn't change a thing.  Have no idea why it took much longer to cook as I have a new oven and know the temperature is correct.  Took 2 hrs for a 5 pound roast, 3 ribs, to reach temperature of 120.  It was very rare and very yummy!

In addition to the thyme mixture, also sliced up 2 cloves of garlic and inserted them into the meat. Took the roast out at 117 and let rest until 133, that took about a 1\2 hr. A perfect rare to med rare.

I give this three stars because the flavor was good.  However, the cooking directions were way off.  The original directions are for a 10-pound prime rib.  My prime rib was 8 pounds, so I felt confident it would be cooked properly with the given time.  After 20 minutes at 500 and 60 minutes at 325, the meat thermometer registered only 80 degrees.  I ended up turning up the oven to 375 and cooking the meat an extra 90 minutes.  I was disappointed that my dinner was served so late.

I found this recipe and the reviews were great so i decided to give it a try.  It was fabulous.  The inside was medium rare and the outside was welldone so there was a mix of meats for all the picky people.  I used a meat thermometer as I was only cooking a 5 lb prime rib.  It was so easy.

This was excellent.  The meat was so tasty and tender.  I used this recipe on a small rump roast that I had and it was great.  I only reduced the quantities due to the size of my roast.

I wanted this to turn out as amazing as other reviewers had said but unfortunately I wasn't too impressed. Considering that I had dropped about 42 bucks on a 4.5 lb roast, I really did my homework to make sure I was doing everything perfectly. The garlic flavor didn't really soak into the meat. My boyfriend liked it so I'll give it three stars but had it just been me, it would have had about 2. Good luck, hope you like this one more than I did!

I used a smaller cut (4lbs), left the marinade the same and adjusted the cooking time. 450 for 20 minutes and 325 for 50 minutes. When the meat temperature was 120 I took it out and let it sit for 10 minutes. It was a perfect rare/med rare and fabulous. I will need to get a digital meat thermometer though.

I have never made prime rib and was nervous it would not turn out right. I followed the original recipe but omitted thyme. Husband doesn't like thyme. The kitchen smelled amazing with all the garlic. It was so delicious and our 8 other guests agreed as well. I would definitely make again.

This Christmas I decided to make prime rib for the first time. My whole family was just delighted in how delicious this recipe was. The directions were simple enough for a first time user. After trying this recipe, I don't think I need to try any others. It was perfect!

I used a 5.88 pound prime rib and followed another user's suggestions on cooking 460 degrees for 12 minutes, 425 for 8 minutes and 70 minutes at 325 degrees.  Mine came out medium and perfect at 145 degrees, not too much pink.  I used extra garlic (the premade stuff in the jar) fresh thyme and rosemary (for the 10 pound recipe) but I only found it got in the way, when people were taking bites they had to pull it out of their teeth.  Such rave reviews!  If I have an extra $50 bucks lying around I will definetely make this again!

I followed the suggestions about cook time especially since I had a smaller cut about 3 lbs.  I still had to cook it about 20-25 min longer on the lower setting before it was to a medium.  Most of my family thought that the medium rare was way too rare and I needed to go up temperature of 150 at least.

Very good!  I cut slits in my prime rib and stuffed the garlic into the slits. Then I rubbed the olive oil and salt and pepper all over.  I did not use the thyme.  Served for Christmas Day with a horseradish cream sauce.

My very first prime rib roast...it was wonderful and very easy.  I found that the cooking time in the recipe was off and took many of the other reviewer's suggestions to bump the heat down to 460 to sear it for 20 minutes and then cook at 350 for 20-25 minutes per pound.  I only rubbed the garlic mix over the fatty portion (as stated in the recipe), but in the future will double that mix and rub it over the entire surface of the roast for more of that garlic-y deliciousness in every bite! Definitely a keeper though!

Followed to the letter except my meat was still a little frozen in the center so I kept it in a little longer at the 450 degree level.  Turned out to be the perfect Christmas Day treat!!

FABULOUS!!!!!!  I made this for New Years day (along with Lobster Tails) and my family raved over it.  It was better than any prime rib we have had in a restaurant.  I made a few slight modifications....I grow herbs to I made a paste with fresh garlic, rosemary, tyme, butter, olive oil, salt and pepper.  I made slits in the meat and stuffed with thick garlic slices into the slits and then I rubbed the paste all over the meat.  The roast was over $50.00 for I bought a digital meat thermometer to be certain that it was cooked to perfection.  It worked perfectly and yielded the perfect doneness of the meat!  I'm an advanced cook, but this recipe is simple enough for even a beginner!

I had a 7lb. prime rib cut and it took longer than 60-75 minutes for it to come to 125 degrees, which is what you should take it out at for medium/medium rare.  I cooked it for 20 minutes at 500 as this recipe suggests, and then cooked for about an hour and 45 minutes for it to read 125.  I then took it out and let it rest for about 15 minutes.  The roast was a perfect medium rare in the center.  The garlic rub was okay.  Some liked it and others thought it was a bit much.  I served with a creamy horseradish sauce.

Great rub on the exterior and the prime turned out perfectly!  An 11 pound cut took nearly 4 hours to cook to medium rare however, so either my oven or the time stated are off a bit. Be sure to have a trustworthy meat thermometer for perfect results.  Excellent recipe!

I made this for Christmas Eve dinner and it was a big hit. It took longer then the recipe stated though. More like 3 hours for our 11 lb. roast. Loving the leftovers on sandwiches. We be making this again.

I made this for Christmas dinner and it was awesome! My whole family raved about it. Instead of the thyme, we put a rustic tuscan spice mix on it the night before.

Great recipe.  We make prime rib every Christmas Eve.  Two suggestions worth their weight in gold...get bone-in meat and invest $20 in an electronic thermometer at Target. The thermometer goes into the meat and the reader actually cords outside of the oven.  You can set the timer to go off when your meat hits a certain temperature.  We bought ours    this year for the Thanksgiving turkey (came out perfect) and then used on the prime rib. The prime  rib came out exactly the way we wanted and we  never had to open the oven door to check on the  temperature.  It is the way to go. 7 pound bone in great for 6 adults and 2 kids. Cook until hits 137*, take out and let stand 10 minutes before carving.  Perfect pink with slight pool of blood.

This is the best prime rib ever!  My whole family is addicted to it.  The flavor of the meat is unbelieveable and the temperature of the meat is perfect.  I usually use extra garlic just because I love it so much and it is still not overpowering.  I also add beef broth once I remove the prime rib from the pan and make an aujois gravy.  My family and I will enjoy this for many years to come.

Very good. Our roast was only 3.5 lbs, so I halved the recipe. It was still a little on the rare side after the recipe's allotted cooking time, but I cut the roast in half, let it rest and then put it in the oven for about 5-10 more minutes. It was perfect for us. (Med-rare/Med)

This was my first time making prime rib and I was very impressed.  I used a 4.5 lb. roast and followed a previous reviewer's instructions for a roast that size.  I was impressed, but next time would keep the 500 for at least 15 minutes, possibly 20, instead of changing to 475. Then 325 for 40-45 minutes.  I was very intimidated by the initial high heat as this created a lot of smelly smoke from the burning olive oil drippings at the bottom of the pan. I had to disable the fire alarm, but now I know...  Thanks for a wonderful recipe, I will absolutely be making this again!

Perfect tasting rub but dont go by the time in this recipe. Use a meat thermometer so you dont over cook it and make sure you take it out 5 degrees under desired temp as it will still cook out of the oven. YUM YUM!!!

This was a very nice recipe and the Prime Rib was cooked perfectly.  My only concern was the light smoke that lingered in my house during cooking.  I think it was the oil.....does any know how to prevent this?

Loved the simplicity of this recipe!  We had a bit of smoke from the oven but it was definitely worth it.  I cooked a 10# roast as described in the recipe. Took the advice of the head chef at Five Crowns Restaurant and cooked till internal temp was 130 degrees for medium rare.  Total cook time was 1 hour 50 minutes for our perfect prime rib! Our gourmet cooking daughter and son-in-law are now going to use this recipe for their New Year's Eve guests....now that's success!

Used an almost 6 pound prime rib (2 ribs, fat trimmed back and tied) and I seasoned my prime rib over nite.  I cooked mine until the internal temp was about 155 (we like our meat well done) Everyone loved it but I think that the next time I would season it even MORE.

I liked the seasoning very much (and the au jus the drippings produced) but I didn't like the way that the roast wasn't cooked uniformily. It was overcooked outside with varying degrees of doneness as you went towards the center. I would recommend searing it at 500F as the recipe says but then turning down the oven to 200-250F and cooking it until the meat thermometer reads 130F. This gives a beautifully even medium-rare throughout the entire roast. If you prefer medium, cook to 140F.

I usually make the kosher salt encrusted p.r., but didn't have the oven time this year.  BOY AM I GLAD I TRIED THIS!  Absolutely WONDERFUL!  One thing, though...I took the roast out at 125 and it got to about 130-132 before I served it.  THIS was medium rare to me, and absolutely perfect!  Thanks for a great Christmas dinner!

I had a 4.5# roast and used the whole time. I seasoned the meat the night before (used sea salt) and followed directions. I checked it 15 min in to see if it was burning and the smoke alarm went off. I turned down to 325 after 20 min and then checked it an hour later and it was only at 130 degrees. Another 20 min at 325 and it temped at 140 at which point I took it out and tented it for about 25 min(Note: My oven thermometer read higher for quite some time) 
The flavor was excellent. It was juicy and tender. I can't imagine how a 10# roast could be cooked in the same amount of time though.

I made this for 3 of us for Christmas Dinner - I had a 4 pound prime rib but made the rub according to the directions for the larger, 10# roast.  I rubbed it all over and let it sit in the refrigerator about 2 hours then at room temp another hour.  I roasted 20 min at 500 (some smoke but not much) and then turned the temp to 325.  It took longer than I expected but it was still awesome.  No need to look for any other recipe - this one's a keeper.  We loved the flavor the rub added.

This recipe is incredible!!! I like my meat a little more cooked so I was hesitant to make this. I used a boneless prime rib roast that weighed about 3.5 lbs. After the first 20 minutes at 500, I turned the oven down to 225 and let the roast slow cook for about three hours. It was about 145-150 degrees when it came out, but it was delicious! Oh, I also used fresh ground salt and pepper. Yum!

I prepared the roast by adding rosemary to the recipe and then rubbing the marinade all over the meat, wrapped it in plastic wrap, and let it sit overnight in the refrigerator.  The next day I took it out of the frig and let it sit on the counter for about 30 - 40 minutes prior to cooking it in our rottiserrie grill until the temperature hit 140 degrees.  It was incredible!!!  Great recipe.

this was so good and so easy.  I had a really small piece of meat (1 1/2lb) just the two of us.  I cut the recipe in half, and only needed to cook the meat 45 min. I was really impressed at the meat when I sliced it up- perfect pink.

I was so scared because my Christmas Prime Rib (another recipe) turned out like a dry pot roast.

Certainly not the case this time.  I prepared the roast for a family member and the rave reviews that came back to me were fantastic, a real stroke for my ego.  I was so proud.  I took pictures and everything.  

I did cook a little longer because my oven is tempermental, a meat thermomitor is a must.

Fantastic and EASY recipe, I am no longer afraid and the holidays will taste much better this year.  

Thank you!

This was my first time doing prime rib and I was nervous!  I had just a 4 pound one so I scaled it down.  I put it in at 500 degrees for about 10 minutes and then turned it down.  It took about an hour and 10 minutes to reach 150 degrees and it was just perfect inside!  Wow!

Excellent recipe. I got rave reviews when I made it for guests this holiday season.  However, since I had never made prime rib before, I didn't realize how expensive this cut of meat is (Over $100 at Whole Foods).  In addition, the recipe did not give the right amount of time the prime rib needs to roast--it took about three hours to reach medium which was about 150 degrees F (I did not want it rare!) Amid these two problems, I will definitely make this recipe again for a special occasion.

I made this recipe for christmas, and it was a big hit! I used a 7 lb roast, but kept the ingedients the same. I made it in the slow cooker the night before, let it cook for 10 hrs, and it came out perfect! some of the bigger meat eaters in the family told me this was the best they've had. there where so many leftovers for christmas, but this wasn't one of them! thanks for the awesome recipe, no wonder you couldn't keep this one to yourself!

This was my first attempt at prime rib, and I also was nervous. But it turned out amazing, my husband said, better than his favourite resturant.  We will make this again.

Like many others, I had never made prime rib before, and was quite nervous!  However, all that is behind me, as this was THE BEST Prime Rib ever!!!!!  I made a 7 lb. boneless roast, and used all of the marinade.  I followed the advice of others, and cooked it at 460* for 12 minutes, etc.  Since no one in my family likes rare meat, I intended to cook it to a nice medium well.  I thought I was watching the thermoter closesly, but I ended up taking it out at 160*.  I was scared I had overdone it big-time, but it was fantastic!  So juicy and tender, you could cut it with a dull butter knife.  For others who don't care much for rare meat either, don't be afraid to go to a higher temperature, it was delicious, and not tough at all.  I didn't make any au jus, just poured what was in the pan into a bowl, and no one even used any, it was juicy all by itself.  My husband and I are not huge Prime Rib fans, but I will definetely be making this often!

Delicious!  I didnt have thyme on hand so subbed with Rosemary.  Also, used a 5 lb roast and took much longer then time specified.  I cooked at 460 for 20 minutes then reduced to the 325 but had to keep putting back in since it was raw.  Very tasty!

I made this last year for a New Year's Eve Party for 6 (adjusting the size of the roast not the seasonings)- first time ever trying Prime Rib. (I simply have a hard time cooking red meat to the preferred tenderness.) So I used a new electric meat thermometer and couldn't have been happier! I adjusted the temps as directed but didn't worry too much - just focused on watching the meat thermometer. My husband swears it is the best prime rib and the external seasonings are just enough, not too strong or too mild. I did use packet au jus... by the time it is ready I didn't care about making au jus from drippings, or lack of drippings. Just ready to eat!

Excellent!  I had a boneless 6.5lb choice cut of prime rib used with this recipe.  I had a digital meat thermometer - a absolute must!  The only change to the recipe I did was cooked it at 500 degrees for about 10 mins. instead of 20 mins. and then lowered temp to 325 as directed.  I didn't bother with directions stating it takes an hour at 325 degrees; I just let the meat thermometer be my guide.  Took the prime rib out when it said 135 degrees (1.5 hours later) and tented it w/ alum. foil.  It took 12 mins. to then increase to 145 degrees which is what I served it at.  Yummy.

This was the best Christmas roast ever!  Mine needed to cook longer at the lower temperature before it reached the 145 degrees internal.  This is the way I will season a standing rib roast forever!

This made for a perfect Christmas Eve dinner!  I followed the receipe exactly, allowing for the 11.3 pound, bone-in rib roast that I bought.  Everyone's mouth was watering as it cooked, and raved about the meal it produced.  My husband and I fought over the bones the next day!

All I can say is yum, yum yum! This was an awesome recipe. I usually use the salt method when making Prime Rib but now I have been converted. The only thing I did differently was let the garlic marinade over the beef overnight in the fridge. Very good recipe this one!

I was hesitant to pay so much for a Prime Rib Roast when I had never cooked one, but this recipe made me look like this was my "speciality".  We now always have a prime rib roast on hand and we love this recipe best.

Cooked this for Easter dinner tonight, it was great!  MAKE SURE you alter the cooking time, I was a little prepared for it to take longer as I took the time to read some other reviews.  The meat was very tender and flavourful!

Wonderful! Definately add to your cooking time. I did bake it @ 500* for 20 minutes and then let it roast for an hour, checked it and put it in for another hour checking it after 30 minutes. I should have taken it out after the first 30 minute check (1 1/2 hour cooking time at 325*) because it would have been at a medium rare - medium. At 2 hours it was definitely a medium - medium well. It still had some pink in the middle but not enough for my taste. Definitely a keeper.

All I can say is...wow! This was my first time making rib roast. It couldn't have turned out better. I do think it's extremely important to get the best meat possible from a butcher. I had the butcher cut off the bones and then tie them back with string. This made carving the meat a cinch. Not sure if you can find prime quality meat at a grocery store. Beware...I did find the cooking time to be quite underestimated. Other than that, this recipe is fabulous!

I made this for Christmas dinner, and it was absolutely delicious and super easy! I followed the recipe exactly and it came out beautifully browned and juicy. I took it out of the oven when meat reached 135 degrees, and it was perfectly cooked. Smelled wonderful too.  I served this with garlic mashed gold potatoes, steamed asparagus, rolls and sweet potato casserole recipe from this site. I can't wait to make this again. Thank you so much for this recipe!

This was the absolute best prime rib I have ever had.  I followed the marinade exactly as written and it turned out beautifully.  My husband and I like our meat med. rare so we took the roast out of the oven at 135 degrees and let it sit for 10 minutes...perfect!!  Thank you Chen.

As a lot of other reviewers, this was my very first attempt at making prime rib.  I served it for a New Years Eve dinner party and it was delicious!!!  I am lucky to have farmer’s market close by, because I got the nicest piece of meat from the local butcher.  I made an 8.5-pound roast and I didn’t alter the rub marinade at all, and it covered the entire roast nicely.  The secret to this recipe truly is using a meat thermometer… you can’t go wrong.  My total cook time was approximately 2 hours and 45 minutes, I took it out of the oven at 130º and as it rested the temperature rose to the desired 140º…it was done perfectly!

I'm a fireman in a large east coast fire department, and I made this as the main course of our Christmas Eve Dinner. Even though we were busy and didnt eat until 10.45 pm everyone on my shift said this was THE best prime rib they have ever had. (Myself included). I brought in my digital insta-read meat thermometer and just checked the temperature regularly. I took out the meat when the internal temp was 125 degrees and it worked out very well. Will definatly make this again.

Just like the resturant.  Everyone loved it and requested medium meat.  Cooked to 135 and let stand 30 min.  Light pink througout the middle of the meat and ah so juicy.  Used USDA Choice meat.

Another wonderful prime rib recipe. It was very easy and turned out a tender roast. The house smelled of garlic and the roast tasted wonderful. I did decrease the thyme and salt to 1 tsp. each.

I made this prime rib recipe for Christmas Eve, and it turned out great - everyone loved it.  It took a total of 3 hours to cook though, including the 20 minute searing time.  Just a warning to anyone planning to cook this for a dinner party - I had my guests waiting for almost 2 extra hours while it finished cooking!  I cooked an 8lb boneless rib roast.  I will make this again, I'll just adjust my cooking time accordingly.  Definitely take the roast out at 130-135 and let it rest, otherwise it will become more on the medium side, than medium-rare.

SO GOOD!!!  We made this for a new year's eve fest and we were blown away!  So easy!  We had to cook it a little longer than the cook time, but it's still the BEST prime rib we've ever had!!! Thank you soooooooooo much Chen.

I'm updating this to 5 stars because the rub flavor is SO good!  Yum!  I kept the measurements the same for a 4.8 lb roast but would reduce accordingly next time.  There was a lot of oil in the pan when it was done.  I cooked for 30 minutes at 450, then reduced to 325.  The garlic did burn at the 450 heat but not enough where it affected the flavor.  The crunchy bits of garlic were fabulous after cooking!  Great flavor but no au jus.

This was my first attempt at Prime Rib and it turned out great.  I used a 6.5 lb. roast, but used the full mixture amount.  The flavor was wonderful

Good flavor for sure and everyone loved the crust. Used rub/seasoning just as described for the 10Lb although changed roasting time for a 6Lb Prime rib cut as follows: 450F-Convection for 30min and lowered for roast at 350F-Convection for 45min...It was well done about 2 inches layer on the outside and perfectly medium rare in the middle.  Will change for the next time  and acquire less well done area in the outer layer.  I liked dipping my steak in a sauce when eating...so I used the juices from the tray, added 1/4 cup of westershire sauce bring  boiling for 5 min, serve on the side with the steak.

This recipe is a family favorite. My husband loves it so much we now have prime rib once a month! The only change I make is I start it in a 450 degree convection oven for 30 min. Then I drop it to 325 for 13-15 min per pound or use a meat thermometer until 135. Rest the roast for 15 min.... PERFECTION!!

This is incredibly easy, love the smell that wafts throughout the house. i have made this several times and it ALWAYS comes out perfect . I don't change much, unless I have to substitute or I am out of a certain herb. However, with a new oven I dont sear for as long, and follow others advise to do 12 minutes at 460° and 8 @400°. My family loves it and it is so easy to follow and do.

This is my go-to recipe for prime rib.  Only adjustment I made was temperature since I only had 4 lb roast: 460 deg for 15 mins and 325 deg till thermometer reached internal temp of 140 deg for medium well (about 2 hours).  The meat is melt in your mouth tender and delicious!

I made this for my family's Christmas dinner this year.  Everyone said it was the best prime rib they ever had. My only problem was to figure out how long to cook it. The roast i purchased wasn't as big as the one in this recipe and there wasn't alternate cooking times given.

500 degrees for 20 min. to start was definitely too high- I should have read the reviews. Garlic burned and got bitter. Of course every oven is different- mine's a new Samsung gas (which I love.) Agree that 325 deg. at 20 min. a lb was just right for med rare. Otherwise, this is a great recipe (the 3 stars is because Allrecipes should change the recipe after all this feedback- but I know that's not realistic.) Please watch in the first 20 min. to see if it's burning.

We cooked an 11 lb prime rib on the Webber grill with charcoal.  The only change I made to the recipie was add soft butter all over, then smear the rub. The grill took about 4 to 41/2 hours to cook. Then we cut it down. I rib per person. To die for! This is my favorite rib rub. Don't skimp on the butter. It makes a big difference.

This was my first time making prime rib, and using this recipe made it so delicious! My family loved it. I didn't exactly follow the recipe though. Like some other reviewers said, I only cooked it at 450 degrees for twenty minutes. Then I changed it to 400 degrees for eight minutes and after that I put it to 325 degrees for an hour and twenty minutes. I also recommend marinating the prime rib for two days!

Rub was fine but the timing was totally off.  It took about twice as long as the recipe indicated... dinner was super late.  Will look for a different recipe next time.

I followed this recipe to a “T” and it will not get done in the time frame mentioned.  I just made a 10 lb roast with ribs and it took about 90 minutes longer than this recipe.   I even increased the temperature to 375 degrees for the last 45 minutes and could barely get the thermometer to read 140 F and the meat was rare/medium.  Even the end pieces were not done.  Frankly, this recipe ruined my Christmas Eve dinner, I don’t know how the chef can say a 10 lb roast can be done in an hour and a half.

This was so easy and it came out perfect, I roasted it at 500 degrees for 20 min then turned the temp down to 350 and cooked it 15-20 per pound until 135 on the meat thermometer. So juicy and delicious.

I have cooked prime rib using this recipe about 10 times now.  The first time I followed the directions exactly and the roast was too rare - as in raw.  I had to cook it more and it messed up the timing of all of the accompanying dishes.  The second time I increased the cooking time to 20 minutes at 500 and 2 1/2 hours at 325 and overcooked it a little as it came out medium - that was also disappointing.  I've got it right now.

I cook the roast at 500 degrees for the first 20 minutes as indicated.  Turn the oven down to 325 and cook for 2 more hours.  Take the roast out of the oven and cover it with aluminum foil for about 15 minutes.  It will be a perfect medium rare and slightly more done on the ends as would be expected.  The temperature of the center will be in the low 120's when you take it out.  If you wait until the internal temperature is 135 to take it out of the oven, it will be overdone.

I overcooked it a bit, but because of the searing, and the rub, it was still moist and very tender and flavourful inside. I actually used a sirloin tip roast and was surprised at how nice it turned out. Next time I'll cook it a little less and it will be perfect!

This was absolutely a very delicious prime rib! I served it for Christmas Eve party and my guests loved it! I used half the amount of pepper and it turned out well. I doubled the amount of garlic and marinated for just an hour. I also placed it on a bed of celery, carrots, and onions for infused flavor with Hawaiian salt sprinkled in roasting pan around the prime rib. Definitely a must try!

I followed recipe exactly and I should have known better than to cook a ten pound roast in less than 2  hours! Came out raw and needed another hour and a half to finish. By that time guests were drunk and would eat anything.

I made this for Christmas and it was so amazing! I followed the recipe exactly though I was very tempted to follow suggestions from the comments to cook at different temperatures. I followed every step exactly and the prime rib came out fantastic. I used a 7 lb roast. The meat was very tender and juicy and was cooked to the perfect medium rare. I'll definitely be using the recipe in the future!

I made 6lbs instead of the 10lbs. Followed to the full 75mins plus the 20 broiling and it was raw in the center. Probably would've had to have cooked it for 4 hours to even reach the medium rare inside.

This is the absolute BEST prime rib I have ever had. Restaurant Quality!!
 I made this for Easter, and our friends that ate with us couldn't believe that I actually made it. I made the recipe EXACTLY as written (which I believe is the only way to truly rate someone's recipe) and it is perfect! I don't recommend changing anything about this recipe. Make it exactly as shown and you will be shocked at how wonderful the flavor tastes. Truly blown away. I make a ton of recipes from this website but this is the only one I've ever felt obligated to open an account to write a review on. 5 star recipe all the way! Yum!

Absolutely delicious. Best prime rib ever! Usually cook prime rib on my old charcoal kettle Weber  but tried this recipe when we were having guests over and the weather wasn't cooperative.  (I break it out for special occasions.....I just can't give it up!)Still prefer the Weber for the smoky , charcoal flavor. This recipe got such raving reviews I will certainly use it again when I choose to take the easy way out.

Excellent aroma wafting through the house at first when it was cooking at 500°. My son was outside in the yard playing basketball and the smells of toasting garlic were too much for him to handle. He just had to stop and see what was cooking. The scent then changed slightly after it had been roasting a while at 325° to a more beef braising aroma which stirred the hunger in all of us. the rib turned out great and the crispy garlicky morsels which had fallen into the drippings made the au jus even more flavorful and delicious. My apologies for not having taken a picture of it while it was resting, but the anticipation of eating that beautifully encrusted slab of deliciousness was too much for me and the opportunity passed me by with nary a notice. This is a GREAT recipe! I will absolutely be making this one again. Thanks

I did not change one thing.  I cooked at 500 for 20 minutes then adjusted to 325 until internal thermometer said 130 (husband likes rare).  then pulled out of oven and let it sit for 10 minutes then carved.  While eating no one talked the entire time.  They just kept shoveling it in :)  everyone loved this and it turned out to be a fantastic birthday dinner for my husband.  I also made the au jus recipe by chef John on the allrecipes site to go with this.

I always use this recipe for prime rib and have used it for other roasts too.It always turns out good and it gets a huge amount of compliments! The only thing I have found is that it takes  more time than is specified.
     Also, do not be afraid to use the high heat as directed; it always turns out good!!!

The first time I used this recipe I craved Prime Rib, for months afterwards. This was so delicious, and again, so simple. Who knew? I do follow some of the other recommendations and I take it out of the oven at about 125 degrees and let it sit. The results are a wonderfully med. rare piece of meat that melts in your mouth.

Amazing!!  5 stars for the thyme / garlic rub, although I based the exact oven time & temp on other's reviews (formula below).  We've made this twice.  For Science.

I used the thyme / garlic rub in this recipe without adjusting the serving size for a 3lb standing rib roast because I wanted a thick, strongly flavored crust. 

Based on studying other's reviews, this is the oven formula that worked well for us both times:  460F for 12 minutes, 400F for 8 minutes, then 325F for 20 minutes per pound.  

I did use a digital leave-in meat thermometer because I wanted to remove the roast from the oven when the internal temperature hit 130F, but the estimated time based on the formula was very close (within 8 minutes) and would have resulted in more of the roast being medium rare.

From the very first time I used this recipe, it is NOW and always will be my go to recipe for not only Prime Rib, but for just about any beef roast!!  The flavour is undoubtedly is second to none, the smell in the house while it's cooking is like music to the senses!!  I would have to say this recipe is 99% fool proof, I would say 100%, I'm sure there is someone out there that could mess it up, but it would be pretty hard to!!!  Thanks to Chef John for yet another amazing addition to allrecipes.com!!!

best prime rib I've ever made.  I cooked a 4.5 lb roast and pulled it out at an internal temp of 145.  Perfect medium done.  4 in diameter of rare in the center without being bloody.  The cooking time did vary significantly from the directions but that's to be expected.  Never cook a roast without a thermometer.

Phenomenal! Had this at Christmas with all the family. Added more garlic, Changed 500 to 450. Came out fairly rare, but everyone loved it. Cut it up and put a few pieces back in the oven with it off while everyone sat down. Perfectly medium rare after sitting for 20 min in tin foil, and medium well/well done for others who prefer it this way. Was amazing will make again!

Fantastic!  I used a 3 lb prime rib roast for the two of us. Because I threw a couple potatoes and carrots in the bottom of the dish (last 60 mins), I used the exact measurements for the original recipe for a 9-10 lb roast. Also added 1/2 tsp each of rosemary and sage.  It was perfect.

I've made this twice now. It turned out fantastic both times. It was a much smaller roast (around 3-4 lbs) but I didn't cut down on anything. It had a nice thick and flavorful crust. The roast smokes at first, but the garlic doesn't get that burnt bitter taste.

I made my first (2) prime ribs just yesterday for Christmas dinner. This recipe is fantastic! I made an 8lb bone-in and a 5lb boneless rib roast and they both turned out delicious. My father commented that it was the best prime rib he has ever eaten.
I do wish that I would have read more of the reviews in regards to the temp for the searing portion because my kitchen became seriously smokey. I was afraid the marinade was burning but it turned out crispy and delicious.
I used a probe thermometer and took each roast out at 145. After resting for 10 minutes, the outer meat was medium and the center was medium-rare. Delicious. Even though next time I will take them out at 135 so that everyone who likes more rare meat can have a good amount of it.
Great recipe!

I was nervous making this as it was my first attempt at making prime rib but this recipe was perfect. I made a few changes...I omitted the thyme just because I don't care for it, I did 1/4 c olive oil, 6 tsp minced garlic and used sea salt instead of regular salt. I followed the cooking instructions  exactly and the meat came out perfect!

Yum yum yum!  This was so stinking good!  The only critique is that the outside was almost well done while a perfect med rare to rare in the center; think I need to monky with the temp times.  But absolutely delicious.

I followed recipe exactly. The cooking was amazing it was tender and juicy. However, wish I wouldn't have followed the garlic. It was too much and I love garlic. Should've reduced it by a clove to a clove in a half. It was good though.

This recipe yields EXCELLENT flavor. We prepared a very small piece to feed only 4. It was a little well done with the timing used. Will try again with larger cut.

We had this for New Years Day. Used a 8 lb rib roast and followed other suggestions of starting out at 460 degrees for 12 min then 400 degrees for 8 min and then 325 degrees. I did 12 min per pound but it was a little too rare for us so will try 15 min per pound next time.

I tried this recipe with an 8 lb prime rib for Christmas dinner!  It was a hit for everyone!   People are still talking about how good it was!  Although my oven cooks more on the hot side so next time i'll watch it when the temperature gets close!  It was fantastic and a no brainer recipe!

Excellent instructions and thanks for sharing! Only tweeks I made are 1. Use 2 teaspoon of rosemary in oil rub, 2. Place roast on a bed of sliced carrots, celery, & onions to roast in the oven. This allows for the roast to be lifted from the pan, and the arromatics infuse a delightful flavor as well. 3. I remove the roast at 125°-130° to rest for 15-20 minutes which brings it to temperature for serving rare and medium rare. Again, great recipe. Thank you!

The best way to make prime rib. I have tried other methods for years and I finally made the perfect roast. I had my butcher season and oil my roasst and I did not insert cloves. But the method was perfection. This will be the way I cook my Prime Rib from now on.

EXCELLENT! I made this for Easter and it was a huge success. I browned it at 460 for 12 minutes, at 400 for 8 minutes, and then did 325 for 20 minutes a pound and it came out nice and rare in the center and med-rare on the outside. This will be a new Easter tradition for us! Next time I will make more rub to put all over and not just on the fatty side - it is awesome!

This is the best method for cooking Prime Rib, and it works even better than the "fool proof" recipe. If you spend that kind of money on great cut of beef, then you want the best results! My family prefers this rib roast to ANY other meat I have prepared for special occasions. There is enough rare, medium and well done bits for everyones taste. Thanks for the great recipe!!! Its a keeper!

I've always had trouble with roasts as I tend to always overcook them.  Used this recipe twice with sirloin tip roast and it turned out perfectly as medium rare both times.  Prime rib is a better cut so I know recipe will be even more delicious next time when I use prime rib roast.  This method of cooking roast is the best that I have used.

Thank you this was great! We like ours a bit more done so I did just that. The marinade, however, was amazing. I wouldn't have thought to put thyme on it but it was perfect.

Super good and super easy! We tried this last night for Christmas dinner, and it was a hit! My husband likes his well done, so I finished his slice(s) off with a quick sear in truffle butter over the stove. So good!!! I recommend the cream-braised brussels sprouts (sprouts in a lemon cream sauce) found on this site as an excellent side.

Really good recipe, however we ended up having to cook ours longer than the instructions with an 8lb prime rib. From what i've gathered on the internet, after reducing the temperature to 325 the prime rib should stay in the oven for an extra 13-15min per lb. Since the prime rib that we cooked was 8lbs, we would need 104-120 minutes which is about 45 minutes longer than this recipe calls for (which has a 10lb prime rib in the recipe).

Made this as written.  Delicious flavor, and this recipe will now be my go-to for prime rib.  Did take about 45 more minutes to cook than directed to get to medium rare.  My oven is fairly new and historically reliable, so I don't think oven temp control is the issue.   Moral of the story: don't rush perfection, and invest in a reliable meet thermometer.

I like garlic but in its place.  This is a horrible recipe if you like the taste of meat.  The garlic ruins an expensive cut of meat.  You might as well eat hot dogs or cheap hamburger but the garlic would probably ruin that too.

I have never eaten or prepared PR before. I made this using a 2lb PR (PR is costly) and used butter instead of oil. Other than overcooking it, it tasted delish! The outside was crisp and tasteful, inside the meat was tender. It does dry out very quickly (over cooked). I didnt think to adjust the cooking time based on my PR's size. I will attemp it again for dinner and plan to make it for X-MAS.

I prepared a "Whole Pay Check Foods" 7 pound ribeye roast with the bones partially separated and tied on.  I deviated from the recipe in three ways.  First, I did not let the roast sit at room temperature due to lack of time.  Second, I substituted Lawry's seasoning for the salt.  Finally, as I was using a convection oven, the two temperatures that used were 475 degrees and 300 degrees.  My roast took a little over three hours to cook.  I gave this roast to close friends as a present.  The result was said to be "perfect" and a "masterpiece".

Perfect method of cooking prime rib. I used a 7.5lb boneless roast. Total I had to leave it in the oven for 2 hours to get to an internal temp of 130 which is when I took it out. It was perfectly medium rare.

easy. Followed exactly and it really creates a nice crust on the top of the ham. They charge you $1 more per pound for this if you buy it already seasoned at the store. Do it yourself. Lots of compliments on this.

This was spectacular. But 500 degree oven with olive oil and garlic in the rub set off every smoke alarm in my house before I knew what was happening. Next time I'll try it with 400 degrees. I recommend this heartily, but watch the oven if you go with 500 degrees.

The flavor was good, but the smell of burning garlic was a little disturbing, but if you can get past that, this was tasty.  Took longer to cook than what was anticipated though.

We  made this for a Christmas Eve dinner with 25 people.  Every one kept trying to give either of us compliments, but it was so easy we didn't feel we could accept them.  Really, the oven does all the work.  I was really worried about ruining $60 worth of meat, but it came out beautifully.  I made fajitas with the leftovers and they were so tender and delicious.  By the way, we did the high heat at the end of cooking.  I think you can do it either way.  Wonderful recipe and it makes the house smell great!

My first ever rib roast, I used granulated garlic, olive oil, and a dry rub the butcher gave me to try. I skipped the thyme and black pepper, and just salted the roast. Followed the directions for the 500 degree cooking, using my digital thermometer, lowered to 325 degrees and cooked until temperature was 153 degrees.  This was the most wonderful roast ever.  My family couldn't stop raving about the flavor and how great it tasted, and the smell was just awesome.  I highly erge anyone to invest in a digital thermometer, it really makes a difference.

The crust burned, smoke filled the house, smoke detectors went off.  500 degrees was too high for my oven.  I turned the oven off at 135 degrees, and pulled the roast at 140 degrees.  There was some pink in the middle, but it was not medium-rare.  That being said, the roast was flavorful and enjoyed by all.

I halved this recipe for my 4 lb roast since it is just my son and I.  It was fantastic.  The only suggestion I can give is take roast out a little earlier since it continues to cook during the resting period.  I took mine out when temp read 145 and I did cut to make sure it was at medium rare - but after the resting period, it was more of a medium.  But other than that - A+

Although mine took a lot longer than the recipe said, it was absolutely delicious.  The pan juices were amazing.  Next year I will use this recipe again, but I think I'll keep it out at room temperature for longer before cooking.  My probe thermometer registered 42° after sitting at room temperature for an hour and a half.

I had butcher cut the bones off and tie back on with string.  After cooking just cut the string off and easy to cut.  This recipe was fantastic!  Only change is I rubbed with Dijon Mustard then added the spices as called for.  Christmas dinner was a hit. Thanks Chef Mike.

The only improvement I need to make for our family is to have some way to keep this warm after slicing. I have a stickler in our family that likes his food hot and he's the slowest eater around!

I made this for Christmas dinner. It was so good!  I can't wait to eat the left overs! I had to roast it longer than instructed because I used a deep roaster. Next time (and there will be a next time)  I'll use a shallower one so we can eat earlier.

I had never cooked prime rib before and was a little nervous, but this recipe made it easy and fool-proof! My fiance (who is a butcher and very critical of any meat I cook) was very impressed with this recipe.  I followed the directions exactly and cooked until internal temp of 140, it came out very tender, perfectly medium rare and the garlic flavor went all through the meat.  This easy garlic rub would also be great for any other type of roast.

Made for Christmas dinner today and we loved it!  Really easy.  We had a smaller roast so we adjusted the cooking time because we like it pretty rare, but I used the same proportions for the rub ingredients.  We believe you can't over garlic anything, so I probably used twice the amount of garlic.  Thanks alot for this one.  We will be using again!

My first attempt but not my last!  This may beat out the honey baked ham as my new Christmas eve tradition.  Whole family loved it!  I did have to make a few adjustments to the cooking time, but otherwise, first rate.

Awesome! 8 pounds (3 ribs) This turned out a little more to medium on the outside but still lots of pink in the middle (gas convection viking pro series) so next time I'll sear for 20 mins at 450F and cook at 325F until it reaches 125 degress. Tent and rest for at least 1/2 hour. Different stoves for different folks!

Stop cooking at 137 degrees internal temperature. It rises very quickly and continues to cook after tenting.

I was worried when my BF asked me to make prime rib for his birthday, but this was one of easiest recipes I have ever found. He went for thirds! It turned out great! I have enough  left over to make french dips and some other meals.

I served this tonight.  My family loved it.  My husband is usually very picky when it comes to beef and doesn't like any tough meat.  This was fork tender and full of flavor.  I always thought you had to slow roast to get that kind of result. This was just delicious!

This was delicious.  The only thing different I added was 1 teaspoon of dry mustard to the rub.  I've done my Prime Ribs similar to this for years and it's always a crowd pleaser ... pass the horseradish please!

Great recipe! I've made this 3 times for my entire extended family. Everyone loves it. I do add the garlic rub the day before and usually takes a little longer to cook than the recipe states. Thanks!

Can't rave enough about this recipe.  Everyone loved it, the first and second time I made it.  And super easy-not at all what I imagined cooking prime rib to be. Thanks for the great recipe!

Had a 6lb rib, let it sit out for about an 1 hr, followed the recipe for the 10 lb rib.  Took about 3 hrs for my therm to reach 160 for medium done.  The meat was soft but some spots were still red.  Next time may try and cook a little longer because I do not like to see any red in my meat.  Tasted good where I seasoned it but some middle areas did not have any flavor.  Everyone else didn't have any comments except that it was good.

An absolutely beef-tastic recipe!  I never cooked a roast of any kind before and I could not believe how wonderful it turned out.  I liked that the ingredients were simple and the roast took no effort to prepare.  I will make this again!

We love garlic but this was just too much for us. The garlic seems to be a little bitter after roasting. We cooked to 140 and it was still raw. Next time I will cook to recommended temp.

YUM!YUM!
Very simple for a first timer!! 
Simple seasonings needed for such a great meat; no need to put so much effort like some of the other recipes.
This one is a big hit for XMAS from now on.

If I could give this more stars I would!  It was simple and absolutely mouth watering delicious!  This was my first attempt at Prime Rib and now I'm wondering what took me so long.  It was just as delicious as what I have at my favorite prime rib place.

After looking at several posts and different recipes on this site, decided this one was the easiest to follow. I do not have double ovens, so this recipe also allowed me to cook other items at the same time. I did set meat out for about 2 hours to warm; this did allow for through cooking. I used a 4.5 pound prime rib. I followed directions almost to a "t". I had no garlic so used an organic seasoning pack (onion and garlic). Turned out great - the topping did blacken, but did not deter from flavor. Also, when I removed the roast from the oven, I wrapped up with foil while it "sat" for about 20 minutes (and finished cooking my twice baked potatoes. I was so nervous about the 20 minutes of high temperature; but am glad I tried this out, and will use again.

Wonderful! We had a 4.5 lb roast and cooked as suggested by some of the reviews. A digital thermometer is a must in cooking this to perfection. Can't wait to cook this again.

I made prime rib for the first time for Christmas dinner.  I scoured many different recpies, and combined different tips to try to make the perfect Christmas dinner.  Using this recipe as the base, I made the best prime rib I have ever eaten.  Everyone raved about how flavorful, tender, and juicy it was.  I will definintely make it again!

Some slightly different things I did:
(1) I made tiny slits all over the meat, and then stuffed the garlic pieces inside the slits of meat.  I also didn't really measure the salt, pepper, and thyme, but just kind of sprinkled everything all over the meat.  I then used an extra dash of sea salt over the meat.
(2) I had a lot of other stuff in the oven at the same time, and it took 1.5 hours more than the recipe suggested.  Luckily, I had a great meat thermometer.  You really can't go wrong with prime rib if you have a trustworthy meat thermometer.  I waited until the internal temp hit 135, pulled it out, waited 10 minutes, and it was a perfect medium rare prime rib! 
3.  To make the au jus, I cut up some celery, carrots, and onion and put it in the baking pan under the prime rib to catch the drippings.  I was planning on making the au jus while my meat rested, but b/c the meat was taking so long and my other sides were done, I just poured beef broth in the pan in with the drippings and carrots toward the last 20 minutes and the au jus turned out great!  This is one of the best recipes I have ever found!

Have used this rub at least 5 times and every time is perfect  I grill it by putting the roast in a disposable aluminum pan and searing top and bottom about 10 min a side on a very hot grill. Then turn roast fat side up and turn heat down to med low and cook til middle registers 130 deg. (cover is always used on the grill)  Tent meat about 20 min with foil then slice and enjoy.
Thanks for a great recipe!!

This rub has a great flavor and was a hit for Christmas dinner. My family raved that this was one of the best meals ever. Only thing I changed was that I doubled the recipe and made sure that there was ALOT of rub on the meat to make sure the flavors were tasted throughout. Everyone was pleased - will definitely use again.

It was delicious.  I followed others advice and used 450 rather than 500.  I did have to cook it about 20 min longer than I anticipated but think it was because the meat wasn't truly room temp when I put it in the oven (although it was out of fridge an hour) If you have a Whole Foods nearby, I would highly recommend getting some of their truffle butter. I served the meat with a little pat on top and it was unbelievably good combined with the garlicky meat. I literally bought $2. worth and it was more than enough.

My first prime rib and it was SO easy!  (I only wish I had known about cutting meat off the bone and then typing back together, would have made things easier, but next time for sure!)
Lots of flavor, followed recipe exactly.

This was wonderful, better than 5 stars. The flavor was so good and the roast came out perfect. I used a 6 lb bone in roast in my stone roaster. I cooked it at 450 for 20 min. Then reduced to 325 for remaining time (approx.1hr 45min) until thermometer read 120 then let stand for 15 min. It came out med-rare on the out sides and rare on the inside which is what I wanted, so when we re-heat the left overs they will be a perfect med-rare. Next time I think I will try putting some of the seasoning inside the roast. Thanks Chef Mike.

More than 5 stars!!! Made this for X-Mas dinner & it was great, better than any restaurant!!! Made 2 6lb roasts & added more garlic, oil & some rosemary. Although could have been a disaster, I left the temp @ 450 for 60 min. by mistake. Had put in another dish & forgot to turn oven down!!! Finished cooking @ 325 for 60 min. What saved the day was had put rub on then popped in freezer for about 20 min to chill center (9/10 like it rare - med. rare) This worked wonderful, perfect, consistant pink thoughout. Couldn't ask for it to be better.  Due not everyone showed up & had  made a Turkey also, have one whole left, froze it, but will post pic when thaw later.
Can't say enough how easy & great this was.

I made this for my family for Christmas yesterday. I followed the recipe exactly as I had a 10 lb prime rib. It was fantastic, after the 20 minutes at 500 it took 1 hr 45 min for perfect medium rare. Thanks for such a simple and yummy new addition to my recipe box.

Amazing results every time! Best piece of beef I've ever eaten. This is my go-to recipe for holiday meals. Since I usually cook a smaller roast, I use a meat thermometer to ensure perfect results.

This came out perfect.  It was my first time hosting a family get together and this by far beat all the prime rib we had in the past.  Everyone loved it!  Didn't change a thing on the recipe.  
Thanks for sharing!

I used this recipe on a smaller roast (5lb sirloin), followed the recipe to a T.  The only fault was I had the rack too high in the oven and when I was searing the beef, the crust burnt.  Lesson learned.  Otherwise, it was awesome.  Can't wait to try again.
Christmas Eve 2009 gave me the opportunity to try this again, this time on a 3.6kg Prime Rib.  It was amazing, followed the recipe exactly (maybe used a tad more garlic) and it could not have turned out better.  My guests loved it!  Thanks again for the fabulous recipe!

I scaled this down for 4 people and the only thing I added was a little extra garlic and 2 tablespoons of really good red wine! It was delicious. I served it with roasted rosemary potatoes, green beans and some sauteed portobella mushrooms....it was fantastic!!!!

I used all ingredients except the thyme.  Mine was a 7.5 pounder.  I did 20 minutes at (preheated) 460 degrees (set off the smoke detector... twice), and then about another hour at 325 degrees.  I don't have a meat thermometer so I just had to cut into it when I thought there was the slightest chance it might be done, erring too much on the rare side (we are a rare meat family and my convection oven tends to cook things faster than recipes call for... and nothing more depressing than overcooking a prime rib.)  It was probably a little too rare for the rest of my guests but they still loved it, and it was perfect for me :0)  But next time, with a 7.5 pounder I'd probably do 20 minutes at 460, and then an hour and 20 minutes at 325.  I'll be sure to have a meat thermometer next time.

It is rare for me to give a recipe 5 stars (since I never do for recipes that need adjustments).  However, this recipe is AMAZING. The only thing I did differently was double the marinade so I could spread it on both sides of the rib roast. Thank you for the great recipe!!!

Awesome! So easy and so good. The oven really started smoking after 10 minutes at 500 degrees but I waited it out! I put a thermometer in the meat and cooked it at 325 until it hit 140. It took a little longer then 75 minutes.

This recipe seemed so simple but it had such high ratings I had to try it.  Oh my gosh, it was awesome.  I used a 4.25 lb roast and followed the directions that were posted by a previous reviewer for that size roast.  I have never had such tender and moist beef.  Better than filet, better than anything.  I also didn't have any better than buillion to make au jus like another reviewer suggested, so I just added a can of beef gravy and about 1/2 cup of red wine to the dripping and another wonderful combination!  Thanks s much!

We used a 11.5 pound boneless roast and it took about 2 hours 20 minutes (20 minutes @ 500, 1 hour @ 325 for 1 hour and another hour @ 350), but everything else we followed to a tee.  It was delicious and my husbands grandmother couldn't believe how little juices came out of it.  They were all still inside!! YUMMY!  This is going in our collection for sure!  Thank you!

This was fantastic.  I was a bit leary about having the oven at 500 degrees (worried about the smoke and the smell) but it was fine.  The meat was tender and juicy - a MUST HAVE for bigger dinner parties.

I have used this recipe for three consecutive Christmases and I can't rave enough about it.  Even made it last year with a two month old baby demanding a fair share of my time!  Everyone thinks I'm some kind of wiz with prime rib but this recipe makes you look good!  You can never have too much of the rub it is excellent double or triple the recipe!

I've tried this recipe three times and it was a hit with my family.  I made it for Christmas dinner for my extended family (aunties & uncles, etc. )and it was gone no left overs what so ever.  I love garlic and the aroma in your house while its cooking will make your mouth water.  Thanks Chen. OMG Yummy!!

I made for our Christmas Eve dinner - my husband said it was better than any Prime Rib he had ever had. I used a much smaller cut of meat and used a digital thermometer to make sure I didn't over-cook. It came out perfect. Thanks for this recipe - it helped make our holiday dinner even more special!

Okay, so I gave it a 4 because I cooked it ribs up.  I have never cooked primerib, so I did not know it was ribs down and the patee goes on the actual meat. (silly me) SOOO...the pate sounded yummy, and the meat was cooked perfectly, but I did not get to taste the pate because it was on the bones.  I will make again.

Goodness, this was so yum terrific. We had sort of a battle with my MIL about how to follow this vs. logic and I totally think that following this to a T is the best way. I will so make this for Christmas again. Kudos to the chef!

I decided to make this for our New Year's Eve dinner, and what a way to bring in the new year!  I took it out at 138 degrees and let is rest for 20 minutes.  Gave the perfect amount of red and more cooked meat for those with different preferences.  Served it with crockpot mashed potatoes so I wouldn't stress over having sides done before the roast and it worked out perfectly!

The crust was fantastic.  I would absolutely want the crust over the whole prime rib if it wouldn't just drip away!!  Had this for Christmas Eve dinner and the whole family of 12 was ECSTATIC!!!  Boy, what a great piece of meat!

This recipe was the best.  Prime rib doesn't need much since this is such a good cut by itself.  The garlic rosemeary and salt and pepper did the trick.  I recommend cooking the prime rib with the bone.  Our butcher cut the bone off from the meat and then tied it back so I could cook with the bone in.

It was the best.

This recipe is outstanding. We had to adjust all of the measurements and times for a smaller roast but it turned out perfect! I also had to add a little more olive oil to the flavoring to get it to be smooth and easily spreadible.I highly recommend this meal!

We had this for new years 2006 and for Christmas 2007. Last night we enjoyed a 14lb prime rib for 10 people and everyone RAVED about this recipe! There were 2nds and 3rds going all around. This is a TOP of the LINE recipe that will certainly be used again and again!!!

This prime rib receipe was PERFECT!  I had never prepared one before and with the cost of this piece of meat, I was very nervous.  I used the seasonings suggested, however I did marinate it in Au Ju sauce for about 6 hours before I put the seasoning rub on.  I used additional pepper because we are a "pepper loving" family.  I used a 8lb bone-in roast.  It did require an additional 35-40 minutes to reach 145 degrees. I tried to take it out at 135 degrees but the temp actually driopped so I put it back in.  It still turned out perfect for us (a little more done on the ends and pink in the middle)so everyone got a piece done to their tastes! Thank you!!!

I was hesitant too but after reading all the reviews, I decided to give it a try anyways. I made this last night for Christmas dinner and it came out PERFECT. Used the same amount of rub for a 7 1/2 pound rib eye roast with the bone in. Followed the recipe but needed an additional 40 minutes for the internal temp to reach 135. Pulled it out and let it rest for 30 minutes. It was the perfect medium rare. Absolutely wonderful!

Instead of garlic blubs I used bottle pureed garlic I had purchased from Williams Sonoma. This is a very good recipe! I had a 4 lb roast & used my convection oven, 425 degrees for 20 min. then 325 for 1-1/4 hr for med rare.

Oh boy oh boy!!!  This is a keeper!  As others have stated, you have to keep the faith during the initial 20 mins at 500 degrees as your oven does a bit of smoking and you're starting to wonder if you read the recipe wrong... hang in there!!!  This is the BEST prime rib my family has ever eaten.  So tender and so much flavor.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe, it has become a family staple.

I used this recipe for our Christmas dinner.  It was so tasty and tender.  I would definitely recommend it.  My only tip - do not do use this recipe if you don't have a range hood fan because it does create a significant amount of smoke.

I used a 10 lb. semi-boneless rib roast to make this recipe.  It was so easy!  The meat tasted great, smelled divine while it cooked and was a bit hit with my family on Christmas Day.  I served it with steamed green beans and Yorkshire pudding and gravy and the meal was delicious.

Delicious! I got a 7.5 lb boneless rib but I used the full marinade amount. The only complaint that I had was that it took ALOT longer to cook than the original recipe stated. I ended up having to put the prime rib back into the oven twice because it was too rare (for hubby anyway--I LOVE extra rare meat). Prime rib is incredibly expensive but this amazing recipe makes it worth every penny. I found a new Christmas tradition!

Just finished serving this up for Christmas dinner and I had to take a moment to write a review.  This is the best prime rib I ever made.  I made it in a Nesco roaster and had the roaster out in my garage (freed up a lot of counter space and kept the heat down in the house).  I halved some red potatoes and seasoned them with salt, pepper, garlic and paprika.  About 30 minutes before the roast was done, I added the potatoes to the roaster.  Everything was great --- prime rib was cooked to perfection and the potatoes picked up the great taste of the beef.  

Recipe worth more than 5 stars!!

WOW! This was sooo good.  Everybody raved and there was not one single slice for leftovers.  Next time I will double the marinade and rub all over.  After the first 20 minutes at 500 I added a cup of beef broth, worchestershire sauce and a 1/4 cup of red wind for an au jus.  Delicious!!!

Wow, this prime rib came out perfect. The flavor was awesome, I did use a few sprinkles of kosher salt instead of table salt and I cooked it a little longer because the kids don't like it too rare.

I loved the finished product...but I had to serve dinner two hours late!  I left the meat out for 45 minutes, after which it wasn't anywhere near room temperature.  It was a 10 lb. cut.  So, I had no choice but to put it in the oven to start cooking, or else I'd risk bacteria in the meat and also risk being late getting done.  Anyway, I had a total time in the oven of 4 hours, not 1.  Be warned.  It's a great recipe, but plan on a LOT longer to cook than you may expect, especially if you've got a 10 lb piece of meat.  Luckily, my guests were mostly patient and didn't have anywhere else to go!

Outstanding!  I also made this for Easter tonight and it was delicious. Best prime rib I have ever made. I also had to cook it much longer since I was preparing a very large prime rib. It was worth the wait!

UPDATE: It has now been 8 YEARS since I first found this recipe on AllRecipes.com (yes, I have been following AR all these years) and I have made this EVERY year for Christmas since, and often for Thanksgiving too. I have it memorized by now, but it is so simple anyway. My Dad still requests it every year, and my family EXPECTS it every year-it is that great. It fills the house with the yummiest savory aroma. For those who do not get great flavor from this simple recipe, I would suggest to make sure you have enough salt for your size roast, and make enough marinade to really cover the whole roast. I always make extra marinade now so that I can really get a good crust. Remember that the roast is so thick that you are more likely to under season than over season it. 
This was my second time making prime rib for Christmas. The first time I followed a more complicated recipe and it turned out ok. This recipe was so VERY simple, but was much more superior in flavor and aroma. I started the roast at 480F for 20 minutes, which gave it a beautiful crust, then lowered to 325 for the rest. I'd advise to use the 20 minute/pound rule only as a guide and regularly check the roast with a meat thermometer when the time is within an hour of finishing, once the roast is overcooked you can't reverse it! I took mine out at 140F because I missed the 130F mark and it ended up more done than I wanted, but still tasted great. This is the recipe I'll be keeping for prime rib, thanks Chen!

Made for both Christmas and a New Year's Eve party.  Fantastic.  Used full amount of garlic with a 6 pound rib roast.  House smells wonderful while cooking.

It was a good recipe, very easy. I did have a problem with the cook time.  It took 3 hours to roast for an internal temp of 145 at the center. According to the recipe it should have been done in 95 minutes at most. Needless to say my dinner was greatly delayed!

This is my new favorite recipe for Prime Rib.  A little something more than just salt and pepper but certainly doesn't steal the show.  With Prime Rib, simplicity with the spices is best as this cut of meat can speak for itself.  I love the taste of garlic with beef and this is just enough to enhance the wonderful flavor of the meat.

I was pretty happy with this recipe.  It took a little longer to cook then the recipe called for, but came out great.  I have 15 foster kids, all teenaged boys, and most of them have never had prime rib before & they all loved it.

Quite simply, the best I've ever fixed! The roast was over 10 lbs serving 6 people - no leftovers.  Even my daughter who seldom eat beef had 2 serving. I will make this again as soon as I can afford another prime rib roast.

I just wanted to say thanks Chen for a great recipe. My family and neighbors agree that this is the best tasting prime they ever had. I followed the recipe to the T and the meat turned out awsome. I will definitely make this again.

The only difference I had with my 6 lb. roast was having to cook it longer than the recipe stated to get it medium rare. However, everyone raved about it! Thank you.

This was my very first roast and since the piece of meat cost me $75 I was PARANOID about ruining it. I threw in some rosemary and WAY more garlic than suggested (I love garlic) and the smell of it cooking was absolutly divine! I served it with horseradish sauce and popovers and the meal was an absolute hit. I was nervous during the first stage of cooking, as I was sure my roast was going to catch fire or burn to a crisp, but it came out beautifully.

I was dissapointed in this recipe, I am not expert at prime rib by any means but this took way longer to cook than directed, we got impatient and took it out before done.  Too rare, but was our fault.  The seasoning wasn't the best I have had but I am glad so many people are enjoying this recipe, wish it would have turned out better for us.

This was really great, but WORD OF ADVICE: do not be tempted to use more salt to 'cover' the entire meat.  I added more kosher salt and made a garlic salt-pepper crust with olive oil to top the entire piece of meat, it came up too salty.  I even brushed the salt crust off...however, the AU JUS is perfect to balance out the saltiness.  I used a ready mix au jus mix by Mccormick.  Baked at 325 for 3 hours as we like our meat well done...it was still VERY tender and delicious. Overall, excellent!

I made this for Christmas Eve and it was a hit! I am not much of a salt eater, and it was slightly salty, but not too bad. May want to cut the salt just a little if you are not one of salt eater. Plus I dug a few garlic gloves into the rib so garlic flavors are deep inside.

I made a 6.5 lb ribeye roast, adjusted the temperature for the weight based on recommendations by previous reviewers and it turned out perfectly medium rare.  I finished slices under the broiler for guests who wanted their slices less rare.  I also prepared a horseradish sauce (1:4 ratio of ground horseradish mixed with mayo) and au jus (pan drippings, beef broth & seasonings) to accompany the roast. Now the only thing I'm sad about is that I never tried to cook this before!  Don't forget to get nice rolls and provolone cheese to make french dip sandwiches for the next day...  beyond delicious and super tender.

I had never attempted to make a prime rib before but this was SO easy.  When I served it for Christmas Eve dinner, my husband dictated that it is the new Christmas tradition and he will now request I make it for the family every year. He said it was the best prime rib he had ever had - hands down.  It was spectacular!  I didn't alter anything in the recipe except that we like our meat rare and I had a roast that was less than 10 lbs so I reduced the time a bit.  

One more thing - I read on this site that it is difficult to find a "prime" cut of meat and instead most non-restaurant cooks use "choice" cuts.  I actually found a "prime" cut at my local Super Target.  (I live in Thornton, CO)  Good luck and enjoy!

This is the first prime rib I have made.  I made it for a crowd for Christmas and they loved it.  My roast was 16 pound and I tripled the marinade.  I also reduced the heat on the first twenty minutes like some suggested.  I did add some rosemary.  I made the Au Jus with some a little help (pre powdered package) mixed with the drippings, water and some Merlot.  It was fantastic.  Thanks.

I prepared this for Christmas dinner and it was my first attempt at prime rib.  I don't cook much red meat, so I wasn't sure how well it would turn out.  Read all the reviews first, so I knew I could trust the recipe.  It was incredibly easy and turned out great!  Rave reviews from my herd of men.  The ONLY thing I would change would be more drippings for au jus.

It was the first time for me also, cooking a prime rib. So I went on-line & came across this easy recipe which was so simple to make. It came out awsome, better than a restaraunt for sure. I was so proud of myself being a beginner at cooking, I was nervous, but I read these reviews & It came out great! I am so glad I can go on-line to get good recipes that are easy yet, so delicious. I am making this again, for sure. It was the best x-mas dinner I ever had!

I'm a beginner cook and have always been scared to attempt cooking prime rib. However, this recipe made it so easy. The big secret is removing it and tenting it in foil 10 minutes prior to reaching the desired temperature. I made sure to made au jus to accompany it in case it was too dry, but it wasn't necessary. Highly recommended!

If I could give this 100 stars, I would! I am just now getting around to reviewing this recipe that we tried out before Christmas.  And once we tried it, once was not enough!  We had it 6 weekends in a row!  This is wonderful, the flavor, mmm!  The cooking time was just perfect for my husband and myself, medium rare!  Thank you so much Chen!

I made this for Christmas for about 12 people.  I had never made prime ribe before, and worried because it was so expensive.  It was great!! Everyone gave it rave reviews.  Since Christmas, my husband has requested it several times.  I don't mind spending the money on it now, because I know with this recipe it will be perfect every time.  THANKS FOR SHARING!!

Edit: I'm so disappointed in myself for forgetting to mention something very important.  This takes an hour+ longer than specified in this recipe.  I have a 6.5 lb rib roast that took an hour extra than the 75 mins at 325.   I actually cooked it at 350 after I realized it was only about 90 degrees after 60 mins.   I didn't look at other reviews this year and now dinner is much later than anticipated.  Everything else is finished and getting cold.  :(    Original: I am a huge fan of garlic so this recipe was right up my alley.  I used a 5 lb roast but used the same amount of marinade.  Everyone loved it.  If you're worried about the price of prime rib, this recipe is still worth it.  However, around here, prime rib is always on sale around Christmas time.

I had never made a prime rib before, and certainly didn't want to ruin an expensive piece of meat.  Well, this was fantastic, and I am not longer afraid to cook a prime rib. It was better than many prime ribs I have had in restaurants!  I will definately use this again!

Very easy, very delicious!  I made an 8 pound roast, but tripled the marinade.  The flavor was nice, but not strong enough.  Will consider an overnight marinade next time.  The roasting time was extended, but may be partially due to my oven.  My guests didn't mind the wait though!

This is definitly restaurant quality prime rib! The meat came out perfect! Medium rare & medium to well at the end. I made this for Christmas dinner & everyone raved about it then and still are now. I used fresh thyme instead of dried but I'm sure it would be great either way. I will try this rub on other meats as well. Thanks for an unbelievably awesome recipe!

This was excellent. We had it for New Years Eve & everyone loved it.It was my first attempt at fixing Prime Rib & I could not have chosen a better recipe.
I have been cooking for over 40 years.
Thanks Chen. Will make it again.

Everyone at my dinner party RAVED about the flavor of the meat.  I only had one problem:  My prime rib was never frozen, I let it stand for one hour at room temp but it was still very cold.  I ended up having to cook it for an hour longer than the recipe called for.  I used a digital thermometer to watch the temp and with an extra hour it was perfectly medium rare.  Dinner was quite late but still great.

This was my first prime rib...delicious! My husband raved about it, even the leftovers. We used a 5 lb. roast, but it still cooked longer than recipe said. I checked the meat temp. often, and took it out at 130. This will definitely be a holiday favorite! Thank you!

Seasonings were great!  Everyone loved the roast.  I followed suggestion of earlier reviews that suggested starting with a 425 oven.  I didn't want the smoke alarms going off.  My meat thermometer wasn't working properly, and I cooked it longer than suggested, but meat was still pink, juicy and delectable.  Thanks!

Great flavor and super easy.  I went the extra step and inserted slivered garlic inside slits that I made in the meat...I don't think it added anything, so next time I won't bother. This recipe makes you look like an expert!

On a roast it was good, but not great.  Used a thinner cut of meat and this really worked for it.  (Flank)  I make it all the time.

This recipe was fabulous, it smelled and tasted wonderful!!!! I pressed my garlic and next time will take it out around the 130-135 degree mark. I took mine out at 140 and it was 145 within minutes and that made most of the cuts more medium - it would have been nice to have a few more medium rare cuts! Everyone loved the meat, it was so tasty and so very easy to do!!!

This was my first try at Prime Rib. I don't eat beef but apparently this was the best that my family has ever had. I cooked it 'til it was well done and it still was extremely tender and juicy while cutting it.  Wish I knew what it tasted like but I'll trust my family's "particular" appetite. This is a keeper!  Oh yeah.. PLEASE use a meat thermometer!

I made this for Christmas dinner and it was a huge success.  I used a little smaller roast but used the other ingredients in the same amount (you can never have too much garlic).

I'm re-reviewing this recipe.  This is my second year in a row cooking my prime rib this way and it was just as amazing as the first year.  This year I poked holes throughout the roast and inserted nice size chunks of garlic.  The holes also allowed the olive oil and spices to seep into the roast.  Once again, I lowered the searing temp to 460 and lowered the temp to 350 after 20 minutes.  Everyone RAVED about the prime rib.  My brother-in-law had seconds and just couldn't stop complimenting.  I served with corn, mushroom sautee, shrimp scampi bake, twice baked potatoes, and garlic/parmesean french bread.  Just an absolutely amazing meal.  Thank you so much for an out of this world recipe!

This was my very first prime rib roast and was afraid I was going to screw it up.  I'm glad I read to use a meat thermometer, it came out exactly how everyone wanted...medium well and the center was slightly pink.  It was SOOOO tender.  I got rave reviews and everyone said it was the best.  I increased the recipe 1 1/2 times because the roast was 13#, but next time will double it.  Loved the combination of herbs!! Just wanted more of it.

Yum!  Made this for Christmas dinner.  I followed the directions for the seasonings- then I encrusted the roast with kosher salt & baked it at 225 for 5 hours.  It melted in our mouths & it was incredible!

This recipe was excellent.  We had prime rib several times this weekend and this recipe was by far the best.  I let it marinate overnight and took the prime rib out of the oven at 130 degrees and let it come up to 140 degrees before we sliced it.  It was incredible juicy, much better than the slow cook recipes. I can't wait to make it again!

First time making prime rib and this was delicious and simple.  I took out of the oven temp at 127.  Middle was medium rare but outside were medius.  I'll probably take out at 115 next time.  Definitely a keeper.  Thanks for sharing!

This was excellent, although I changed to 30 minutes/450 F for the searing and then just cooked until the internal temperature was 130 F.  This was perfect, and everyone loved it!

I'm glad Chen can't keep a secret because this was awesome!  It was my first prime rib, and it turned out perfect. Two points to make...1) Don't be intimidated by a $50 piece of meat.You and your meat thermometer are in control!... 2) Your house WILL smell like garlic.  We love garlic so much we wish they had garlic scented candles...okay, maybe not, but I can't wait to make this again!

This is an excellent recipe! I made it when we had my brother in law and his family over for dinner. They raved about it. In fact, my brother in law said it was the best prime rib he's every had, and he loves prime rib! I will definitely make this again for Christmas.

While cooking this for Christmas dinner, I was praying the whole time I wasn't ruining a $40 rib roast.  I needn't have worried though as it turned out superb.  My husband wants to have it on his birthday and he's one picky guy when it comes to prime rib.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Amazing.  Followed the recipe exactly, adjusting cook time to suit my 4 lb. roast, while keeping the garlic topping as written for the big roast (we love garlic!).  Added a generous splash of Cabernet and beef broth to the pan, along with a couple of roasted garlic cloves from another recipe, and the jus was fantastic.  We will definitely make this again!

1.  My 10# roast took an extra 90 minutes with these cooking directions.  I used regular and digital thermometers and check every 15 minutes.  I was not going to ruin a $150 cut of meat.   

2.  I also used 15 large garlic cloves.  

3. Rested the meat about 25 minutes

"Spread the mixture over the fatty layer of the roast, and let the roast sit out until it is at room temperature, no longer than 1 hour."

This was supposed to be our New Years Day dinner. Thank goodness it wasn't for company I would have been total embarrassed.

Following the instruction as written "Let the roast sit out until room temperature , no LONGER THAN 1 HOUR. Well, we planned on a 6:30 dinner the roast was not cooked until 8:30 because 1 hour at room temperature was not enough to bring it to room temperature.

We had salami sandwiches for dinner.  Our beautiful Prime Rib will not be eaten until Friday.

Amazing prime rib!! This is my husbands favorite meal and he said it was the best ever!! I read the reviews and also started with the oven heat at 450 degrees for 30 minutes and then 325 degrees for 13-15 lbs per lbs and then at end took out of oven and tented the roast with aluminum foil and let it sit until the thermometer reached 135 degrees for medium rare roast.

Absolutely delicious!! I was scared to make because expensive cut of meat to buy and just ruin BUT OMG it was soo good!!!! I didn't have thyme either so I thought it'd be missing some flavor and omg no!! I did buy a smaller one at 4.5 lb so I followed another recipe where they adjusted the temp to the smaller cut and it came out PERFECT!!!

This recipe is way off on the timing. It took way longer than the allotted time and I ended up serving dinner later than expected. And yes, I had it out of the fridge for a couple of hours before cooking it. However, the flavor was really good.

I have always been afraid to try my hand at Prime Rib- until it was on sale! I had a 4.5lb roast and as I read the comments I adjusted the times accordingly but left the measurements for the crust alone-this was amazingly easy and so yummy! I’m looking forward to making it again and sharing with friends/family!

Super easy but so impressive to serve. Used a 14 lb boneless prime rib and it was cooked to perfection with medium pieces at either end blending to medium rare to rare in the middle. Zero leftovers. Served with popovers and roasted winter root veggies. Incredible holiday meal!

Best prime rib I've ever made. So good in fact I went back to the store to buy another one while they are still on sale. Now making the 2nd one in a week's time.  PS the leftovers made incredible French dip sandwiches

The directions were spot on. I suggest a very good oven thermometer and a probe style stick thermometer for the meat. It pays to be sure of the temps,  and to check after each hour.  I used two 6.5 lb roasts with the bone in and roasted it bone side down, covered with foil.

We really liked the topping for the rib.  I followed the directions and at 500 for 20 minutes then lowered to 325.  Two and a half hours later it still was not done.  We ended up just taking out of oven and microwaving for those who wanted a rib that was not rare.

I think I undercooked this a little -- my meat thermometer lost its battery. Nothing a few seconds in the microwave couldn't fix. One of my guests loved the rareness so I let him have those. This was so tender and flavorful, and I didn't even use a prime cut, I had a select cut. The crispy rub was absolutely to die for. I was a little nervous about making this, as I've never cooked this cut of meat before, but it was amazing. Bought a 5.5 lb and not much was left over.

Chef John vs Chef Mike- last year I did chef John's method of turning oven off it was great! This year I Did chef Mike's version and it was REALLY GREAT! Idk why? I did get more of a crust by keeping the oven on? Delicious! I do have 15 + year old oven? So that could be why leaving the oven on made it better? Way more flavor keeping oven on.  No photo I ate it ALL

Though I stress out every year over making prime rib for Christmas dinner, the roast turns out perfect every year.  On occasion I have suggested doing something else for Christmas, but the family and extended family loudly disagree.  Great recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly except that I only used 5 lbs of meat. It DID NOT take and additional 70 minutes to cook. It took me another 3.5 hours to get a temperature of 135. Once done, I waited 15 minutes before carving. Aside from the outside of the meat, the inside was absolutely tasteless. No taste of garlic, salt, thyme, blackpepper.

Cooked a 6 pounder for the hour and a half. Was pretty pink inside which I know is the norm for this. I may cook it longer next time. I put a few slices in a skillet after baking for those of us who like out meat well done. Delicious. Loved the garlic mix topping. Used the same mixture to coat my asparagus!

To improve this recipe; when rib cage is open spread, 1 small bottle of garlic paste all over the insides before you tie it up.
About 1/2 cup of material or more!

Nothing infuses the garlic flavor like doing this method from Inside the roast. Very important

Perfection. No deviation from recipe is needed. Just follow the steps to enter meat nirvana! (Oh and then skip over to Chef John’s Beef Au Jus recipe for a match made in heaven.)

Absolutely the most delicious prime rib I have ever had!  It tasted even better than it looked - flavorful, while staying moist and a beautiful texture.  My entire family went crazy for this one - definitely a keeper!  Anything less than 5 stars, then you didn't do it right!

I cooked a 4.25 pound prime rib and used the same amount of mixture ingredients as a 10 pound roast calls for. I followed other reviews and cooked at 460 for 12 minutes, 400 for 8 minutes & 325 for the remainder. I cooked it for 20-25 minutes a pound. I covered it in aluminum foil and let sit for about 10-15 minutes. It was a perfect medium rare.

Would have been nice if the recipe mentioned all the smoke that was about to overtake my oven.  I know... "500 degrees" should have been a clue - but a side note would have been helpful.  Suggestion: do the 500 degree part in your BBQ grill and then finish it in the kitchen.

This was my first time to make prime rib, and it was amazing. I cooked the first 20 mins at 500 on the top rack which was moved up to the highest setting inside the oven, then when I turned down to 325 I moved the middle rack down to mid-low in the oven. The result was a delicious crusted outside, but I feel like I would have preferred a little more of the pink center to be closer to the edges. It was tender and great, but next time I’ll cook closer to 60 mins after I turn down the temp rather than 70-75. Super simple - and I made prime rib sliders for Christmas and the family loved it !

The garlic paste was excellent and easy to prepare. It was very tasty. The only knock I would give it is the cooking time. I know ovens vary but I had a roast half the size and it took quite a bit longer to cook to medium rare. I would definitely make it again.

Made it for New Years day.
I love the initial sear it gives a beautiful crust and seals all the juices.  We let it rest for 15 minutes and when I sliced it the juice ran from the meat. It was the most moist tender prime rib we have ever eaten.  Melted in your mouth!!! It was nothing special, just a bone in roast from the grocery store.  I believe it is the sear at 450-475 that made it soooooo tender!!! This is a definite recipe for keeps.

Third time making Prime Rib using this recipe. Each and every time, absolute perfection! I get asked what special or exotic seasonings did I use. I laugh, tell them the simple ingredients, instructions, and direct them here to Allrecipes.com! Forgot to take a picture AGAIN! So, I am finally submitting my rating and review, without any pics. Follow the directions, step by step, and you can’t go wrong! A+++

I like garlic, so I incorporated part of another recipe. I made slits and put some sliced garlic in them.   I added some beef broth to the drippings for  au jus.

Amazing! Used lots of fresh thyme. Rubbed extra oil on the rib. Threw in with a ham finishing up at 425 for 12 min then increased to 450 for 25 min then followed with about  13 min per pound. Came out perfect!

Used a 6lb roast.  Followed the directions exactly as written, except for the spices...used my own mixture of Montreal Steak Seasonings mixed with an egg white and a bit of olive oil.  The searing was perfect, however, some of my guests would have preferred a bit less rare on the end pieces.  However, it did come out extremely tender.  Next time, I will roast at a low temp for the 2 hours to get a bit more cooked through.

I had never attempted a prime rib before. For whatever reason I thought it would be difficult or wouldn’t turn out as hoped. This was the perfect recipe to try out. So easy and turned out amazing! I will certainly use this again. 
Ps. My thermometer was reading 120 and didn’t seem to be climbing. I was concerned about the amount of time it had been in the oven so I pulled it out, wrapped it in foil and let it sit for about 15 min. Perfect medium rare at 135

We made this for Christmas dinner and it came out very well. Tender, flavorful, juicy. I used to pan-sear prime rib before cooking in oven, but the 15 minutes at 500F with this recipe does a nice job of holding in juices. I did cover it with aluminum foil while it cooked.

I have been looking for a good Prime Rib recipe and this is it! It was GREAT,! This was our Christmas dinner, a 26 lb Prime Rib..I applied the marinade the day before and wrapped it in plastic wrap in the fridge till Christmas morn. I pulled it out around 9 a.m. and let it warm to room temp before putting it in the oven at 3 p.m.  I cut it into 1/3's as it was a 26 l.b. piece of meat, doing this allowed me to make 3 pieces the same.  Home run!  Thank you so much for sharing this..

Used Italian seasoning as we didn't have thyme.  Didn't know what to buy the men for CHRISTmas, so bought them prime rib for CHRISTmas dinner and this recipe was a hit!

Made a 15 lb bone in prime rib for Christmas.  Everyone raved about this recipe. Salted and peppered the entire roast and doubled the recipe.  I used minced garlic from a jar.  Preheated oven to 500 but cooked at 475 for 25, then turned down to 325.  Took out when the temp probe was at 122, tented with al foil, and it still rose to 139 in 25 minutes.  Meat ranged from well on the end to medium in the center.  But was very juicy and tasted incredible. Yes the garlic was black, and some may call it burnt, but it tasted amazing.  People were picking the "burnt" garlic pieces that came off during carving out of the platter to eat with the meat.  We had au jus and horseradish sauce, but the meat was incredible without any sauce.  We generally prefer med-rare, so next time I do a bone in this big I'll pull at less than 120, but the meat was so juicy and delicious it didn't matter as even the people who prefer rare still raved about this.  Quit looking at recipes and go get some garlic!

Very tasty.  Cook times were close.  I cooked a 3 bone, 7lb prime rib at 500 degrees (convection roast) for 25 minutes, then turned oven down to 325.  It took a little over two hours to get it to 140 Internal temp.  I took it out and rested it for 15 minutes.  Internal temp. raised to 150 during rest.  Center was med rare, everything else was medium.  I would recommend that rare/med rare lovers take out prime rib at 130/135 degrees for more med. rare. meat.  All in all very tasty.

I never made a Prime Rib before....ever. This was fantastic and it came out so perfect. I was really proud and I got an applause from my family at Christmas Dinner. I read some of the reviews and took their recommendations since my roast was only 7 lbs. I cooked it at 450 for 30 min  then 325 at 15 min per lb. My husband said it was like eating at Smith & Wollensky. I also paired it with the Garlic Asparagus Mushroom. Was a nice change from Ham or Turkey,  it was a very special treat.

Fantastic easy recipe, I used an ample amount of all the ingredients for a smaller roast (~4lbs), coated all sides of the roast, then let marinate in fridge for at least a day, then followed all the instructions, including keeping it covered with foil the entire time. Pulled it out of the oven when the meat temperature read 130F.  Let it sit for at least 15minutes, sliced it up and it was absolutely delicious! Juicy, full of flavor and tender. The juice from the pan was almost super flavorful and great to dip crusty bread into. Definitely will use this recipe again, everyone in our family thoroughly enjoyed this roast.

I made this for our Christmas Eve gathering. One critical adjustment is the noted cooking time. Being the 3rd time I've made this - the roast was always under cooked for the allotted time mentioned. The time I needed to cook my 7.3 lb. bone-in roast (for a temp reading of medium rare 130-140 degrees)  was at 480 degrees for the first 20 minutes then lower the temp to 325 and cook for 2.5 hours.  Take out and rest for 15 minutes before carving. Trust the thermometer - place in center of roast being careful not to touch bone or bottom of pan.  My issue was only with the cooking time - not the marinade recipe which was excellent

This eventually turned out delicious but it took about an hour longer than the recipe states to cook a 9.5 lb roast to 145 degrees.

I did on lower rack for the time at 500 and watched to make sure garlic did not burn too much. Sometimes I turn it down early. Still working on the time per pound...

This was the best prime rib I ever made!  Something unexpected came up and it spent 2 days in the fridge with the seasoning on it before I cooked it.  Will try as written next time.

Very soft and tender! Although it was a little too soft and tender towards the bottom, and it needed some more baking at a higher temperature to become less raw. But honestly, it had tons of flavor and was very juicy. This'll keep an army fed!

I am an avid Prime Rib maker. I was disappointed in the flavor, and the cooking duration was off by over 60 minutes. Yep.  Thank GOD I decided to use a temperature probe, else I would have had a RAW prime rib.  My Prime Rib was out of the refrigerator for 3 hours. Followed the directions to the "T". At 60 minutes my internal temp was 84.  100 at 90 minutes, 118 at 120 minutes,  At 60 minutes I turned the oven to 375, at 90 minutes I turned it up to 400.  At 2 hours it was an acceptable Medium Rare.  Goofed up the dinner schedule.  Further, the rub added little to no value in flavor.  Disappointing.  I'll go b ack to 450 degree & 8 minutes per pound, turn the oven off, never open the door, remove at 2 hours from off time.  Perfect restaurant look, feel, texture, and med rare perfect.  Toss this recipe in my opinion.

I’ve used this recipe several times now, the garlic is the best, but the cooking time is WAY off. Even with the 20 minutes at 500, this roast still takes 2-3 hours to cook. Typical I’ll check it at the hour mark after the broil and then at 30 minutes and then 15 and so on until I hit 140, last time I pulled it out at 135 it was still raw in spots.

I used to be afraid at the thought of even cooking such an expensive cut of meat at home. Terrified that it would come out terrible and no one would want to eat it. After finding this easy recipe I jumped into the deep end, so to speak, and cooked Prime Rib in my own oven. I have used this recipe three times now....Christmas, my son's birthday (January) and Easter.  EVERY time it has come out AWESOME!! My son  says it's better than any restaurant we've been to, including a popular local steak house from "down under".  I do need to mention that I did purchase a meat thermometer to make sure I didn't over cook the meat. But I think it's also the seasoning that makes this taste so GREAT!

I followed the modifications others made and preheated the oven to 450 - turned out beautifully.  I have a newer stove that uses the broiler unit for heating, which burned the garlic - will adjust for that next time!

20 minutes at 460 and 325 to 125 degrees. I wish we would have pulled it out at 120. We tented with aluminum foil and let it rest about 15 minutes. I have always wanted to cook a prime rib but I was afraid of ruining an expensive piece of meat. We had a great meal. Thanks.

Perfect!!! I had to make some adjustments since I had only a 5 lb  prime rib but like I said it was perfect. I’m amazed that such an easy recipe for prime rib could be so amazing.

Instead of the using the salt, black pepper, and thyme, I used one of my favorite seasoning rubs (California Rancher Oaky Smoky). I used 3 tablespoons of seasoning to flavor the roast. The prime rib came out delicious!

I made this for Christmas dinner and because my husband did not get any I made it again New Years Eve.  The second time came out even better than the first because I took it out once the internal temp hit 125 degrees.  It was perfectly medium rare.  I had a smaller roast so I made some proportional changes to the ingredients.  The high temp in the beginning really locks in the juices.  This is my go to recipe for prime rib.

The rub is good, fairly standard, but the cook time was completely off for me. I had an 8 pound piece of meat, yet it took twice as long as the recipe called for. I’m not sure what the issue was.

Good, but may need a little more flavor. I left it in a hair longer because some of my family won’t eat it medium rare, and prefer it at least medium. Very good recipe though, will make again...

The marinade makes a nice garlicky crust. Somehow I managed this without a meat thermometer and had a perfect medium rare roast. Also, did the 460 at 20min instead of 500. 5.25lb 2 bone roast.

I made this for Christmas dinner. I'd never done it before and was very nervous. It came out AMAZING. Mine was a 14lb roast. The recipe doesn't talk about this BUT get bone in if you can. However, ask your butcher to trim the bones off and then tie it. I didn't know to do that and it made it a little challenging to cut at the end. I can't say how easy and great this recipe turned out. I only did 15 minutes  at 460 and then down to 325 for 3 hrs. I let it rest for a half hour and it was a perfect medium in the center (usually I like mr but my guests prefer a little more done )...you can do this recipe and people will love it!

The seasonings in the marinade gave it great flavor and it was quite tender, but I should have cooked it longer because it was more towards rare than medium rare even though the meat thermometer read 142 when I took it out of the oven. I was hoping for a little more medium at least on the edges for some of my guests.  I popped a few slices back in the oven for a few minutes and they were perfect.    I will definitely make it again!

This was a really good recipe. I have only one issue with Prime Rib cooking times.  Either my oven cooks very low or the cooking time is totally off on every site!  There is no way a 10 pound prime rib can cook in the time allotted for this recipe.  I made a 6 pound prime rib and it took an hour longer then the 10 pound recipe recommendations. I knew it would be longer because I just made another Prime Rib Recipe a month ago.  It too look longer.  No, I am not over cooking it.  Just saying know your oven people because the times can be very different!!! If you are having a party it could really become a problem if you have not cooked a Prime Rib before.  I only have two under my belt and am still trying to figure it out.  Excellent recipe.  Didn't change anything for ingredients.

Tried this for our Christmas roast and it came out perfectly!  Enjoyed the crust and the meat was tender.  Note:  I halved the recipe for our 6 lb roast and adjusted the cooking time (3.5 hrs) because my family prefers meat cooked to a medium doneness.

I just made this roast and it was awesome!!  My mother in law would not stop raving about how great it was and no one could stop eating it!  I made a smaller roast 3.5lbs and just halved the recipe.  Kept the temperature and the timings the same but my oven must not seal or hold heat well enough as we noticed that the temperature stalled at about 125 with 40mins left so we turned the oven back on at 300 and was able to reach our desired temperature of 135 in exactly two hours.  We let it rest for 10 mins. Perfect medium rare!  Will definitely make again as it is a new family favorite.

The cooking directions were terrible. While the rub recipe was great the key is how long to cook it in the oven. I would have cooked it for 25-30 min @ 500 and much longer afterwards. ... 200 min at 350 degrees.

I dont like that is says the meat cooks at 325 for 60 to 75 minutes.......... that simply is not true.  Once I put it down to 325 - it was about 14 minutes per pound from that point

This prime rib was amazing!!!! I was a little worried about the high cooking temperature, so I read the reviews and decreased it.  Other than that I kept everything the same.  I had a 6.5 pound roast but I kept the marinade seasoning as written.  The roast was perfectly seasoned and so tender.  Thank you for the recipe, this will be my go to recipe for prime rib.

This roast didn’t even get to 120 degrees after following the directions. And it’s the second time I’ve tried making it following the exact directions. I ended up turning the oven back on to 325 to for another hour. Disappointed for the second time around.

Made this for years and it is Fabulous!  My wife likes it medium-well done so she gets the 'end' slices.  Top of the line 'Beef Lovers' cut, no doubt.

Like the seasoning. It needs to be slow cook with low heat. The meat wasn't tender at all.

Excellent flavoring added & the meat came out extremely tender. I had to add an extra 20 minutes to the cooking to get my 3-bone prime rib to approx 135 degrees though.

I ALWAYS use this recipe and ever since I found it, I have made about 15 prime ribs because my family goes NUTS for it!! I use this recipe with a 5lb prime rib and A LOT more garlic and it turns out fantastic every time. Thank you!

This came out delicious! I accidentally didn't thaw the prime rib all the way so I left it in the oven at 200 degrees for about an extra hour and a half. Luckily it turned out perfectly!! Seasoning was delicious!

Slightly overcooked by following recommended baking time for rib roast weight. Cooked to a medium rather than medium rare consistency, which is to our liking. Moist and flavorful for the most part. I'd definitely give it another shot and just trim the suggested baking time in our oven.

Sooo good. This is my first time cooking a prime rib and I was terrified I'd overcook such an expensive piece of meat. But this is divine!!! I'm in food coma heaven. The center was a little more rare than we are used to, but after cutting I just put those pieces back in the oven for a few more seconds.

I agree keeping in simple is the right think to do because no prime rib or beef roast is complete without a good Beef Au Jus sauce and horseradish sauce.

This is our traditional Christmas main course for seasoning, but I do use chef John’s perfect prime rib cooking method. Combining the two has been the perfect combo for us.

Was really nervous about not ruining this rather expensive piece of meat. The video helped bolster my confidence and the outcome was truly sublime. My roast wasn't as big so I went with 15-minutes per pound at the 325°F temperature.

My guests were impressed.

I did not add as much salt- can always add more, no need for any extra sauces after cooking- also, I did not cook it at 500, rather 460- worked well.  Excellent recipe!!

I used this recipe (and the timing) for a 4 lb standing prime rib roast and it was fabulous. When doing this recipe a second time with a 10 lb standing prime rib roast (as cited in the recipe) I learned that an additional 1-1/2 hours is needed at the 325-degrees oven temperature. That is based on how long my dinner guests had to wait for the meat to get to 135-degrees internal temperature so they could have their dinner.  Great marinade - but need to adjust the timing.

Excellent rub for Prime Rib.  I would prefer to cook until the internal temp is about 5 degrees higher.  That way the ends would be more medium to well done and the center would be rare to medium rare.  This is only because with multiple people eating, not everybody likes their meat rare to medium rare.

Flavorful and well rec'd by all.  Getting the internal temp right took some in and out of the oven a few times and took longer than I expected, but in the end, was great.

This was my first time making prime rib. This recipe is awesome. So simple, but so delicious. The prime rib was absolutely perfect. It was better than anything I've been served in a restaurant.

Luckily I roasted this USDA CHOICE ribeye roast in my new NuWave oven.  I moved the unit out onto the porch to ventilate the thick-as-fog garlic stinch.  The roast turned out to be tough & dry, but this wasn't the fault of the recipe.  The retailer where I bought the meat matter-of-factly refunded $70 onto my VISA card ($9.99 X 7#'s).  It's a big warehouse company who's ordinarily known for their good beef.

This was a super simple, delicious meal.  We followed a few of the other reviews.  We used a smaller prime rib since there are only 2 of us.  We let it come to room temperature on the counter for about an hour.  We cooked at 450 for 20 min and 325 until it hit 125 degrees.  We removed from the oven and tented the meat and let it come to temp (135 degrees).  We can't wait to break out this stunner at our next party!

Amazingly simple recipe.  I only made a few adjustments:  I used double the amount of minced garlic and utilized fresh thyme with a few sprinkles of dry rosemary for the aroma.  Lowered the initial temp. down to 450° (per other recommendations when the crust was starting to darken too quickly) and set the cooking temp down to 300°, (roasting at 20 mins/# of meat).  Easy and tasty.

Great  flavoring!  It took a little longer than the recipe called for to be done enough at medium.   my prime rib was 5 to 6 pounds and it took about 30 minutes longer than the recipe called for for a 10 pound prime rib. I used a meat thermometer to check the doneness.  Overall it turned out great

It was very good.  I think though that it would be too rare if I followed the instructions exactly.  I went over 5 min at 500C and cooked with oven off for 15 min longer and it was quite rare.  very tasty though!

This is the first time I've made prime rib and it turned out fabulous!  Followed the recipe as written but adjusted the cooking time for a 5 pound roast.  Now that I've overcome my "prime rib'o'phobia," I'll definitely make it again!

With the exception of using a smaller roast, and making the necessary cooking adjustment,  I followed the recipe. Our roast was a bit tough. We also thought it was bland. If I try this again I would score the meat so the spices could get into it & maybe have some au jus on the side.

This was delicious! The rust was very tasty, but not over powering. I followed the directions of some reviews and cooked at 460 for 20 minutes and then turned the temperature down to 325 for the rest of the cooking time. I took it out of oven when the temperature reached 130 and let it rest for 15 minutes beforecarving.

This recipe turned out amazingly delicous! I only had a 4 1/2 lb roast and was worried that it might burn at 500 degrees. Reduced the temp slightly to 450 and followed the rest of the directions to the letter. By calculating the 13 -15 minutes per lb rule I had the perfect medium rare roast at completion. I purchased a meat thermometer just for this recipe and will not go without one again. The roast was well complimented with a thin gravy made from the drippings and my first attempt at Yorkshire pudding was a great success as well.

When my husband made this, you could cut the meat with a fork.  I will certainly put this recipe on our "company" list.  I served it with herbed roasted potatoes from All Recipes and it was a wonderful combination.

I made this prime rib for NewYrears Day dinner for my husband, daughter and I and we thought it was the best. I could have cooked it a little longer as some parts were really ware. We just served the medium rare parts and it was plenty and we will have left overs and I'm sure they will be just right for that. Will definitely make again. I made no chan gets in the recipe.

I made this dish for my son, his wife, and our grandson (5 years old), my wife.  It was absolutely delicious.  The one problem I had was in timing the cooking.  We had a 6 pound, two ribbed roast.  We followed the recipe and after the 500 degree blast (20 minutes) I cooked it for 325 degrees for 30 minutes.  I reduced the heat because I was worried about the difference between 10 pounds (your recipe) and my 6 pounds.  At 20 minutes at 500 degrees plus 1 hour  320 degrees it was no ware close to 130 degrees (medium rare allowing for cooking while resting).  We raised the temperature to 340 for another 20 minutes. We had some readings at temperature and some much lower ( 125 degrees and 110 degrees).

The roast was well received (we like rare to medium rare) but I wasn't happy. 

I am going to calibrate my oven, but I need advice on temperatures and times for a roast like this.

Turned out great! This was my first time making prime rib so I was really nervous. My roast was approx. 5lbs but I kept the same amount of seasoning as the full recipe and used the extra to spread all over the roast.  Other than that I followed the recipe although I was afraid that it was going to burn during the first 20-mins. at 500 degrees but I was pleasantly surprised. Everything turned out great and was very flavorful. I'll definitely use this recipe again.

I basted it with the drippings about 20 minutes before it was done. That seemed to keep the garlic moist. It was so yummy!!

Great!  As this was the second time I used this recipe, I added rosemary to see how it would taste, and it was even better than the first time!  This was easy and perfect - I wouldn't hesitate to serve this recipe to even the choosiest of eaters.

This was so easy and perfect!  I scored the meat then smothered the entire thing with the garlic mix.  I did follow the temperature suggestions but really kept it at the higher temperature until there was a nice sear on the top of the meat (my preference).  I lowered the temperature and had to run an errand. When I came back, the thermometer read 135. After taking it out and letting it sit, I served.  It was cooked through and not pink.  It turned out so tender and the taste was incredible.  My husband and son couldn't get enough!  
I made au jus with the pan drippings by cooking it with some canned beef broth and some red wine.  Also served with horseradish sauce.  A family hit!

I made this for the first time for Christmas dinner and it came out perfectly. I reduced it though to a 4lb Pime rib but did not reduce the other ingredients.  Can't wait to make this again. 
Perfectly medium rare. Yum!

I will absolutely make it again. Not sure if I got the garlic deep enough into the meat. Felt like the meat needed more flavor within. The crust created by the rub was excellent.

Did this for Christmas day dinner and was delicious!
Followed the directions with one exception as the meat was already tied and just seasoned the outside .
Last year we did cut small slices with a knife and inserted garlic cloves....this was as good but not better.

My family raved about this prime rib.  I made it exactly as written.  I used the temperature probe in my oven and set it for 135 degrees.  We like medium rare, and ours was more medium.  I will reduce the probe temp to 130 degrees next time.  We also got a nice gravy from the drippings.

I made it exactly  as directed, however with my  8# roast it took about  2 1/2hrs to come to an internal temp of 135'f.  This was pretty frustrating since I had company waiting to serve. However, it tasted magnificent and everyone was happy in the end to have waited.

AMAZING!!!
 I added a tablespoon of gray Poupon Dijon to the marinate which added a spice to it   I cooked it at 460 for 12 and then 8 400 then 50 @ 300 for 3 lb cut. The center registered at 135 which ended up medium rare in middle medium on the ends- perfect!!  Also added container of gluten free no salt addrd beef stock and it made awesome au jous!!  Definitely will make again!!

I will definitely make this again.  I followed the recommended times by some others & made only minor changes:   The night before, I used all the spice amounts for a 5# roast and covered sides and the bottom, placed in refrigerator.  Next day, rested on counter 1.5 hours.  Oven 500 degrees,  put roast in and immediately reduced to 460  for 12 minutes, then reduced to 400 for 8 minutes and then set oven at 325 degrees for 15 minutes per pound, removed roast at 125 degrees and tented it while I made gravy. Turned out perfect pink throughout and outside browned and tasty!  Thank you all!!

This is so high on the extraordinary taste to ease of prep ratio that I will make this again at any special opportunity. Made it for Christmas dinner and everyone ate until they couldn't choke down another bite.. Had some left and there has been no grumbling about having to eat leftovers. Very highly recommend.

The taste was really good. I will definitely use that again. The cooking time on the other hand was way off ! I had a smaller roast than the 10 pound described in the recipe and it took me two hours more to get this roast done. We like it medium rare and the temperature probe was at 135 when I took it out.

So good!   Had a 5-lb. boneless rib roast, made rub exactly as written and used all of it.  Cooked as written to a temp of 130F, tented with foil, and let rest for 30 minutes -- perfection!

I followed the marinade recipe exactly but for a  smaller 4lb roast but followed the recommendation of others for the cook times. Like others I roasted for 460 for 12 min, 400 for 8 min and roasted at 325 for about an hour and let rest about 10 minutes  or so and came out with the perfect medium rare. This recipe is definitely a keeper thank you for sharing!

Great tasting roast which got me a ton of compliments this Christmas.  I will definitely use this recipe again.  No need to look for another.  The only extra step I took was to sear the roast before tossing it into the oven.

The beef was really good. The only thing the directions do not tell you is: DO NOT COVER IT in the roaster. I read that I should tent the meat. I thought, heck, I have a roaster, I'll just put the lid on it. Well, apparently the lid will cook stuff a lot faster.  I checked the meat after 60 minutes exactly, and it was already past medium rare and approaching well done. I was really upset at myself since I paid thirty bucks for those five pounds that turned out waaay overdone. I may have given this 5 stars except I'm not sure what the garlic really did since it all just sat on top of the overcooked roast. Smelled good though. Next time I will NOT put the lid on!

Very good but it took longer than the recipe stated. My roast was 5.8 pounds and it took 2 hours. 500 degrees for 20 minutes, then 1 hour and 40 minutes at 325. I used an instant read thermometer. Took it out at 135 degrees it was 145 degrees after 20 minuted rest. Perfectly done for me but a little too rare for most of the rest of the family. Maybe next time leave it in till 138 degrees. I reduced the amount of garlic and thyme since my roast was smaller.

First time ever cooking prime rib and the recipe was simple,  easy, and delicious.  Needed to adjust lower heat cooking time since I cooked a smaller roast.  I had a slightly lower core temperature reading too since I like mine a little more rare than med rare as suggested.

This was delicious - the seasonings were just right, creating a crispy coating of flavor.  It didn't detract from the flavor of the roast, but was very complimentary.  The family loved it.  I'm sure we'll do this one over & over again!

We made it for Christmas dinner. It was absolutely delicious! We had so much to cook that we cooked  the rib roast as directed except we removed the roast to a a sterno pan. We then placed another aluminum  pan on top of it   We let it steam in the stereo pan for several hours. Worked great & it allowed us to use our oven for other foods. Allrecipes are terrific!

So delicious! the crust was amazing. I followed another reviewers recommendation and pierced the fat to get the flavor of the rub into the meat. It was my first prime rib that I have ever made and while we like medium rare we found that 165 degrees was too rare. I had the thermometer in the center of the 9 pound  prime rib and the outside cuts were perfect but not the center.

One of the best prime rib recipes . I cooked a 9 lb roast and  made this for Christmas.  My family loved it. Instead of minced garlic, I used roasted garlic and seared the meat before roasting. I placed rosemary and thyme between the bones and roast and used carrots, celery, onions, fresh rosemary, freshthyme, fat trimmings and beef stock as a baking rack. Cooked in a roasting pan with cover at 450 degrees for 30 minutes and 350 degrees for 1.25 hrs. Only opening  the roasting pan once after 1.75 hrs to check for doness. Cooked uncovered, last 5 minutes at 450 to develop a crust. Bon appetite! Will definitely make this again.  Made a delicious gravy, using the seared drippings, melted butter, mushrooms, white wine and dripping from roast.

I followed the recipe with just minor changes. I rubbed the seasoned oil ALL over the prime rib and cooked it a bit longer to reach 145 degrees since my family are medium to medium well carnivores. My husband said this was the best I've made thus far and I have to admit it was the easiest I've made as well! Great recipe!

This was the first time my husband and I have made this roast. We served it for Christmas dinner. Everyone loved it! It was cooked perfectly and the flavor was outstanding. I would recommend this easy and flavor filled roast to novice cooks and chefs alike. All in all it took about 2 hours from start to finish for a 5 lb. piece of meat (1 1/2 hours in the oven). Yummy good!

Didn't have thyme. Used rosemary. It turned out perfect. Never cooked it so perfectly done before. I like it rare so I did it for about 8 minutes a pound with the idea of throwing it on the BBQ for anyone wanting it more well done. It was great for everyone!

Great seasoning!  I was impressed 
with the bark on the fat cap, &  enjoyed adding a bit to each bite. 
I  followed Chef John's 30 minutes @500 degrees then turned off the oven and kept the door closed for 2 hours.  The roast came out a perfect medium rare!  The only problem was the roast was warm,  not hot.  I'd love to correct this to have a hotter finish.

Basically the same cooking instructions that came with the prime rib, however I added more seasoning as usual. This turned out amazing! Outside was done well enough for those who like well done and the inside was done medium, enough for others!  5 pounds devoured in no time. Looks like 10 pounds is in order for next Christmas!

We did this for our Christmas dinner as a departure from turkey. I read the reviews and cooked it at 460 for 12 minutes, 400 for 8 minutes and then down to 325 for the rest of the roasting time. It took about half an hour longer than I expected it would to reach 135 degrees but once it got there, I popped it under a cozy tent of tinfoil and let it rest for 20 minutes. The gravy from the drippings was out of this world! The roast was by far the best I have EVER had. Thank you for a knock your socks off recipe. I am looking forward to having an opportunity (searching my calendar for any excuse!!) to making another roast. Delicious. Epic. Best recipe on this site!!!

I used a 4lb roast. I used fresh thyme and rosemary and did put some whole garlic cloves cut in half, in to some slits I cut in to the roast. I did also follow the others advice on changing temps and time. I didn't have a meat thermometer but still cane out great! It was my first time ever making prime rib.

Made this today for dinner, was no where near 135 degrees after 75  minutes.  We seared it first as well.  I would recommend keeping thermometer in the meat and checking regularly, start cooking early to avoid a late dinner!

This was supreme!  We just finished off the entire 5 lb prime rib.  I combined the seasoning with Chef John's recipe and used Coconut Oil instead of butter or olive oil.  The garlic is the key here, so don't skimp on it. I also used Herbs de Provence. My family likes Medium so I cooked it on 500 for 20 minutes, 450 for 20 minutes and dropped it to 325 for 60 minutes. I took it out and put it in a large pot covered so it kept cooking until the temp reached 140 and it was perfection so good. Perfect Christmas Prime Rib.

Made this for Christmas Dinner.  Followed the direction however the roasting time was much longer than listed.  Started with roast on the counter for 90 minutes.  Started at 500 for 20 minutes.  Turned oven down to 325 and checked the internal temp at 1 hour. It was only. 90 degrees.  It took almost 2 hours to reach 130.

I prepared my prime rib just as the recipe specified, and it was terrific!  I was really worried about putting so much garlic on such an expensive piece of meat, but it was really fantastic.  My roast was just a tad larger than the recipe called for.  The only thing was that it took about 25 minutes longer than the stated cook time, so next time I will either allow the extra time, or perhaps let the roast sit out of refrigeration longer before I put it in the oven.  This is the new gold standard.

Followed the directions exactly.  My roast was 21 lbs so was unsure how long to cook it.  I roasted at 500 degrees for 25 min then turned the oven down to 325.  41/2 hours in total roast was done to medium rare.  I had 16 guests and everyone agreed was the best roast.

I have made this several times, and will not even think about making it any other way.  It tastes fabulous, and the aroma it throws off while cooking make you want to rip into it.  The only change is that I always have to cook it longer than it says.  For example, this year my roast was 5.75 lbs, and it took a little over 2.5 hours to get the temp to 132.   There's nothing wrong with my oven.  No biggee, I've learned to plan for it.  It's well worth it.

The marinate came out great and the flavor was awesome, however, the cooking time is way off IMO.  I cooked a 10lb exactly as directed (20min at 500, then 325 after that) and after 2 hours it was still very very rare in the middle - recipe says 60-75 min.  I was using a digital read thermometer the entire time.  I had to put the pieces on a skillet to cook them a bit more (it was already late so I had to serve).  I even let it sit out for an hour at room temp before cooking.  Any suggestions?  I used a roasting pan... could that have anything to do with it?

Loved this but you must let the roast come to room temperature before cooking . I didn't and had to cook it longer than the recipe but the results were fantastic . Will make this again .

I love your seasoning recipe, but a better way to insure a perfectly medium rare prime rib is to roast it at 200 degrees for several hours, until the thermometer reads 130.  (If you are ready to eat and it is not done, you can turn it up for a few minutes at the end)   This gets the roast perfectly pink all the way through.  You can even use this method for a cheaper cut of beef , such as a round or sirloin roast, and the meat will come out amazingly  - almost as good as prime rib.

Another way that works great everytime is put  the room-temp meat in a 350 oven for ONE HOUR in the morning.  Leave the oven  door CLOSED and ONE HOUR before ready to serve, turn the oven back on at 375.  Works perfectly every time.  The size of the roast does not matter for either of these two methods, as long as it is at least 3-4 pounds.

I do it differently - my son - the chef - told me cut slits in meat all over - insert slivers of garlic- slather beef with good grade olive oil, then sprinkle w/kosher salt and pepper - be generous. next use either a mix of fresh crushed rosemary and sage or just rosemary - your choice. again be generous with the herbs - same with a lovely leg of lamb
fantastic! WE SERVE WITH YORKSHIRE PUDDING- a typical traditional English Christmas dinner. bon appetite!

Perfect Recipe, however if you put a little tabasco in your rub it gives it a nice heat.  Also after the initial heat blast I throw it in my Masterbuilt Electric Smoker and bring it to 135 degrees and then rest.

This really isn't anything special.  The thyme  too overpowering.  Sticking to salt pepper and fresh garlic cloves is plenty of seasoning for this wonderful cut of meat.  Let's not over power it.  Also if your meat thermometer reads at 135 you will end up with a well done roast.  If you want the classic deep pink get it out of that oven at around 112.  It will continue cooking out of the oven.

Sorry, I wasn't a fan of this. I'm certain it was much due to error on my part, but I sincerely tried to follow the recipe and I cook fairly frequently. I found this to be difficult to make and time consuming, and the end result was not worth it. Part we're bland and boring. Also the garlic didn't adhere and ultimately didn't do much besides severely stink up the house.

Absolutely delicious!  I've made it too many times to count, with prime ribs as well as eye of round, and it's out-of-this-world every time.  The only change I've made, is I add 2 tsp. gravy browning to the rub, for a luscious, dark, crust on the roast.  Thanks Chef Mike, for a total winner!

Try using Italian Seasoning instead of Thyme, and instead of Salt use Goya Total Adobo (GREEN CAP). It will add alot more flavor to the marinade. Let sit in fridge 36 to 48 hrs. It will make your mouth HAPPY!!!! Cheers.

I wasn't sure that I should leave a review since I didn't follow the recipe but I'll will in the hopes of helping someone out in a pinch. So... it was Easter Sunday and I had a Prime Rib and a ham to cook for company. I know, I should have realized earlier that I couldn't cook the ham, low and slow, and the roast in the same oven. In panic mode I decided to use my toaster oven to cook the roast. My roast was five pounds and wouldn't fit in the oven with the fat side up and the bone side down so I laid it on it's side on a bed of onions. I made half the amount of the seasoning to cover the roast. Oh no, the highest temp on the oven was 450º. I preheated the oven and hoped for the best. Ten minutes in it was smoking badly so I adjusted the temp to 350º and cooked it until the internal temp. reached 120º. At this point my stove oven was empty so I broiled if for a few minutes to crisp up the exterior.  There wasn't enough drippings to make gravy so I reduce a half cup, each, of aged balsamic and red wine along with the few tablespoons of drippings. This was hands down the best roast beef that I've ever made. Everyone raved about the flavour and texture. Great recipe, thanks for sharing.

Was a little nervous because it was my first time making Prime Rib and it was Chrismas to boot!  
This came out AMAZING!!!!!!   All my guests smelled the roast from the front yard before they even stepped foot in the house.

I gave it a 4 out of 5 because if you are going to make a garlic prime rib than this would be great to follow.

However, garlic prime rib isn't for everyone and although I enjoyed most of my guests were turned off. 

Again, follow the instructions and you will have a great prime rib but the garlic portion was WAY too much for this meat.  

Thanks 

Dave

Excellent would make again.

Modifications:
1. Added to bottom and sides, sprinkled, salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder before garlic topping.

2. True convection oven - 500 degrees for same time.  315 degrees for 60 minutes.  Roasted on a roasting rack elevated above the pan.

3.   After 20 minutes (and temperature was lowered), I opened the oven to add whole baked potatoes (extra large) (forked with holes in their tops).

4. When roast came out, covered immediately with heavy duty aluminum foil. (used a thermometer to check inside). 

Perfect!

This came out perfect! I was nervous to make this for Christmas dinner since I don't usually cook red meat, but this recipe was fool proof. Everyone raved about the dish and already started asked me to make it again next year. Looks like our traditional Christmas Turkey has been replaced!

I got a 5.5 lb. bone-in prime rib roast and had the butcher cut the bones off and tie them back to the roast (bones add flavor).  The recipe says to let the roast sit out for an hour to come to room temperature, but mine was nowhere near room temperature after an hour.  Next time I’ll take it out sooner.  I used fresh thyme, decreased the salt, and cooked the roast to around 120°.  It rose another ten to fifteen degrees after coming out of the oven and setting for a bit.  Great recipe – will be my Christmas main course from here on out.

Wow. I mean, WOW!! This was my first prime rib roast I've made and I'm so glad I chose this recipe! My roast was just shy of 5 lbs, so I halved the recipe for the rub, but my roast also took about 65 minutes at 325 to reach medium rare perfection. This smelled so good during the high heat phase, I nearly fainted! I served this with salt-crusted baked potatoes, bacon Parmesan green beans, and Yorkshire Pudding (by Mort Tribble also here on allrecipes). TO DIE FOR!!

I made the marinade following the recipe. I let the roast and marinade sit overnight in the fridge. Cooked @ 450 degrees for 30 minutes and then at 325 degrees for 20 min per pound (we prefer at medium). So moist, so tender and the flavor was outstanding!!

The flavor of this prime rib is phenomenal!!  As some suggested, I omitted the oil but used everything else.  I kept the ratios the same even though my rib roast was half the size and I rubbed the seasoning over the entire roast.  My only complaint was the same as others in that the cooking time was off.  My roast was only 5 lbs.  I did as others suggested and seared the meat at 460 for 20 min, 425 for 8 min and then turned it down the 350 and let it cook.  After almost 2 hours it was 125 deg.  My family likes med and I knew it wasn't ready yet but we were hungry.  I let it rest for 30 min and sure enough when it was time to slice, the inside was rare and the ends were med rare.  It was so good, though, they really didn't care.  Next time I will know to allow much longer for the cooking time (prob 30 extra min for me).  This was my first time ever making prime rib and I am so glad  I found this recipe.  I will definitely make this again.

Cooked a 14.5 pounder 30mins at 500 lowered to 325 for an hour, the center was at 95 degrees so I kept checking temp in 15 min intervals until at 120.Pulled out and put on top of range for 30 mins. PERFECT RED FROM CENTER TO EDGE!!!

I used butter instead of olive oil and liberal amounts of kosher salt on the surface.   Five minutes per pound at 500 then turned off the oven for two hours.   Reheated it briefly to get it to 135. Excellent.

I don't cook, bake, saute or sous vide.  Made this yesterday for Christmas dinner and it was awesome.  Definitely recommend PRIME rib roast and not Choice.  It was kind of scary making this for the first time due to the cost of the roast, but definitely will make this again!  My roast was 10.7 lbs and I modified the cooking to 20 @ 460, 8 @ 400, and 20 min/lb @ 325.  Temp hit 125 with about 15 minutes left and I removed it from the oven and tented it for 30 minutes.  Wow!  Fork tender.

Made it as stated and it was fabulous! Only thing I would do differently is cook to 132 degrees. I went to 135 and the middle was definitely more medium, and we like medium rare-medium. Digital thermometer a must!

It was great and smelled delicious while cooking.  Although I should have taken it out earlier since it was medium, not medium rare for me.  I will definitely make this again next year for the HOlidays.

I used a 4lb beast. I roasted the unpeeled garlic cloves ahead of time, at 350 for 35 minutes. Once cool, I combined the salt, pepper, roasty garlic and 1/2 stick butter (room temp) and tarragon in place of thyme in my food processor.   It makes an easy paste to smear on the fat side up. 30 mins at 500, then down to 325 1.5 hrs and it was just as perfectly rare-mid-rare as can be. I did not have it sit out as described before cooking.

WOW! These seasoning and recipe are AMAZING. This was THE BEST prime rib ever. I let it sit out to get to room temp for a couple hours. I then put the seasonings on, but skipped the black pepper. It was a three lb prime rib, but took about the time quoted here to be medium rare in te middle believe it or not. 

I used the fat from the drippings for a brown gravy base.  I used 1/4 cup drippings with 1/4 cup flour, table spoon of butter. That made the roux base, then slowly added while whisking half tsp thyme, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, parsley, and 2 cups water. The whole thing was amazing. We served it with asparagus and sweet potatoes.

This is a winner. Made this at Thanksgiving and the flavor was awesome. I changed some of the cooking time and temperature due to cooking a prime that was just a little more than three pounds but pretty much stayed with all the directions. My husband requested it again for today, Christmas. Getting ready to see how I do a second time. I don't cook very often and when something comes out tasting like this I'm giving it a 5+ rating. Made me look good.

Amazing recipe and a huge hit. I make according to the recipe, but in addition use a knife to cut 12-15 small slits and stuff with whole garlic cloves.

This is my "go to" recipe for all cuts of roast beef and wouldn't change any of the ingredients.  
For prime rib I only roast it differently.

I think if I made it again I coat the entire roast in the garlic, thyme mixture. The crusted garlic was very good with this prime rib.

I have been using this recipe for a few years now and it's something I have shared with friends who also love it.  I make this and put it in the fridge and use it during the week on chicken, pork and steaks as a marinade and then throw them on the grill.  You can also smear a small amount on a slice of french bread and toast it under the  broiler.  One more thing, why do people have to so critical?  This recipe has been made 1,000 times and has a  5 star rating.  It may be the cook and not the recipe....just sayin.

Amazing just the way it is. People always ask me for the recipe for my prime rib as it's my "go-to" for having a dinner party. You will not be disappointed with this recipe. Prime rib cut is expensive. This recipe makes the cut takes like it's been cooked in a steakhouse.

This was terrific. I had a 12 pound roast that I brought with me to my grandmother's for Easter dinner with the extended family, i rubbed a bit of kosher salt into the roast the night before (having read Serious Eats / Kenji's prime rib tip that he salts up to four days ahead to allow the salt to penetrate deep into the meat) and the morning of i made the marinade, out it in a jar, put everything in the car for a three hour trip (which helped get to room temperature) and as soon as I got there I just pulled out the roast, opened the jar and slathered the top of the roast. Cooking time I did 15 min at 450, 8 min at 400, 75 min at 325 then turned off the oven and left it in for 45 min, i then took it out and let it rest another 20 min before slicing it into half inch slices. Delicious! And terrifying as I had no meat thermometer I could trust. For a hunk of meat that cost over $150 from a reputable butcher that dry ages his meat from local farmers, Its safe to say that I was a bit worried about it being overdone (worst case) or bloody as hell, turned out  perfect.

I have made this recipe almost a dozen times, typically around the holidays and it always turns out great. I use rosemary instead of thyme just as a personal preference.

Pros - Easy to make.  Excellent overall taste.
Cons - None
Notes:  Use fresh thyme instead of dried thyme.  I also found that doubling the amount of salt, pepper, and thyme make the recipe even better.

Great recipe. Today is the second time I've made it. The problem with it though is that the time on here is too short or the temp is to low.  After trying this a second time, I had to bump the temp to 180 C and keep it in there for an extra hour and a half.  It turned out great.

I used this recipe last Christmas Eve.  I had never made a prime rib in my life, so I was a bit nervous.  It came out amazing!  We did have to cook it a bit longer but we used the meat thermometer and it turned out great!  Served with "make ahead mashed potatoes".

I had to review this. I used this technique, for the first time, at Christmas. Said a little prayer as I cut into the rib. It was FABULOUS!!!  Every piece was perfect. So, the other day, my friend asked me if I'd cook another rib for her sons' 21st birthday dinner. I said yes, hoping that the Christmas results weren't a fluke. They most assuredly were not. Another perfectly cooked rib. Thank you so much, Chef John, for this awesome recipe/technique. No more fussing with thermometers and hoping the internal temps will rise with tenting. Perfect. Thank you thank you!!  Only tweaks I made were to use butter instead of oil for the rub. And I did tent for about 30 min after I took it out, as we were awaiting the rest of the guests and the sides to finish. Have I mentioned....perfect!?!

Wonderful for my fist attempt at prime rib.  Used a smaller roast so shortened the times a little but mostly relied on an instant read digital thermometer.  YUM.

Used this recipe for my first attempt at prime rib for Christmas dinner.  My family went crazy for it!  I deviated from a recipe used for several years and am so glad I did!  The aroma filled the house and was amazing!  So easy and right on w cooking instructions.  I did extend the cooking time to 85 minutes to get more of a medium cooked meat (also my rib was 10 1/4 lbs) covered in foil and let it sit for 20 min, it was just right was feeding 10 adults and 6 kids, w plenty of leftovers.  Served with a horseradish sauce from a different recipe.  I can't say enough!

This was perfect! I made this for Christmas Eve and left my family speechless...because their mouths were full of rib roast! I followed the directions exactly and had a nice crust that was perfectly seasoned. I pulled the roast at 130, covered until it was 140 and served immediately. It was exactly medium rare. I might do this a little sooner next time because there are a few of us that are diehard rare meat eaters.

I served this for Christmas dinner and my family loved it.  I must say i was surprised to see how easy it was to make a prime rib that was so tasty. I chose a smaller roast, but made the marinade according to the receipe. The best!

First time to make a Garlic Prime Rib Roast was this Christmas.  It was very slightly pink and I sliced it all thinly on a platter and poured the Jus over and it looked as fantastic as it tasted.  I was so impressed with myself.

Awesome flavor.  This was so good.  I used Chef John's Perfect Prime Rib cooking times because we were out of the house for church and the times on his recipe were easier to work around but this recipe's seasonings seemed like a winner and they were.  Best flavor ever!

This prime rib was outstanding. I sautéed some mushrooms and onions to top it. No more trips to outback for me.

THANK YOU CHEF MIKE.  THIS WAS THE MOST INCREDIBLE RECIPE.  WE MADE IT FOR CHRISTMAS EVE AS PER DIRECTIONS.  IT'S EASY, DELICIOUS AND WELL WORTH THE LITTLE EFFORT IT TAKES TO HAVE A PERFECT PRIME RIB ROAST.

This recipe was fantastic, but the cooking the roast at 500 degrees did make quite a bit of smoke in my mother in law's kitchen!  Other than that, simple and delicious!

I made this recipe for Christmas Dinner & it was amazing! It was the 1st time I have ever made this kind of roast.  I made this with a 6 lb boneless rib roast & followed the advice other reviews to start out at 460 degrees for 12 mins, 400 for 8, then 325 for the rest of the time.  A meat thermometer is crucial to get the perfect degree of doneness. I also used cotton twine purchased at a hardware store to tie the roast up. All in all awesome recipe indeed.

This was my first prime rib, I was so intimidated by the 14 pound prime rib..but after reading all of the reviews I was confident it would turn out good. I did do the first 10 minutes at 500 because it was starting to smoke. I then reduced it to 425 for the next 10 minutes and then 325 for the rest of the time. I started around 12 in the afternoon and it was ready by 4:00pm. It came out very flavorful. I did the au jus sauce using Bobby Flay recipe. I added 2 cups of red wine and beef broth to the pan drippings/juice. All of my friends were very pleased with dinner. I will def. do this again. I bought a digital meat thermameter which is the key to taking out the meat at the right temperature.

This is the 3rd. year I have made this for Christmas,It is absolutley the best! Everyone loved it. I used a 5lb. roast & used the recipe for the rub as is, we love the garlic flavor.I just turn the oven up to 350 @ the end because it was taking to long to reach the right temp. Best prime rib ever, better then any restaurant I ate at!

I made it last night for a Christmas Dinner for my family. I prepared it exactly as it says in the recipe and it was absolutely amazing. Better than anything I've ever had at a restaurant. And yes, it was a perfect Medium Rare!!! I think I've started a new Christmas day tradition for my family :-)

Turned out perfect for our 11 Christmas guests!  Followed the directions exactly.  Used a temp probe sensor plugged into the oven to take the guess work out.  Guests said-Oh I can't eat that much when my husband served them-but....they did.  When we spent that much on the prime rib it was very helpful to have a reliable recipe so we didn't ruin it.

Christmas Dinner, 2012: This recipe is perfect in every way; wouldn't change a thing, and will definitely make it again. Plusses: simple to make, not too many ingredients, spices/herbs are ones I always have on hand, and cooking instructions are easy to follow. But learn from my mistake: make sure your roast is at room temperature when you put it in the oven. I removed the roast from the freezer on Saturday night with a plan to put it in the oven on Monday night, Christmas Eve. So it was in frig 2 days and on countertop another 2 hours. But still, when I put the probe into the center of the meat, I felt some resistance, because it was still slightly frozen. This messed up the cooking time, my dinner was late, and the outside cooked a little longer than it should have (7-lb roast) because it took so long for probe to register 135. One final thing: the majority of the center of the roast was pink, but it wasn't the true, butter-like medium rare I'm accustomed to in fine restaurants. Next time I'll set the probe to 125. This one is a keeper.

Great recipe!  My first time cooking prime rib and i was NERVOUS!!!  I looked at about a million reviews and decided on this one.  

I was a little nervous about the thyme in this recipe, since it is not my favorite spice and can sometimes be overpowering.  But I thought i would go with the original recipe given all the great reviews.  i did use 2tbsp of fresh thyme instead of dried.  The thyme flavor was not overwhelming at all.. honestly didn't even notice it.  It just tasted really delicious with the salty, garlicky crust.

I had a 6.3 lb roast.  I used the portions from the original recipe.  I planned to do the whole 460 x12 in and then 400 x 8, but the garlic started to burn (or i got nervous about it).  So I did 460 x 8min, and 400 x 12 min , and then 325.  My oven only took 1h10m to cook the rest, but it cooks everything fast.  I took it out at internal temp of 130 degrees even though i intended to take it out at 125.  It was a good medium to medium-rare, but next time will take out at 125 as planned (hopefully) to get medium rare to rare.  I let it rest for about 1 hour before serving because was busy finishing everything else.  

Got rave reviews, even from my picky parents!  This was so easy and so delicious.  I am so excited about my first prime rib!!!  Don't be nervous, this really is so easy and so awesome.  I think the meat thermometer really is key, plus the delicious rub.  Tasty!

Every Christmas I make this recipe. My family loves it! I bought a 9.65 pound rib bone in and took it out an hour to rest in room temperature.  My changes were as follows: I used 2tbsps of Hawaiian salt and added 1tbsp of dried rosemary. I roasted at 450 for 30 minutes and then lowered it to 325 for 2.5 hours. I took it out at 130 and rested it for 10 minutes and it was perfect! Medium rare inside just the way my family likes it. Thank you for this recipe!!!

This turned out fantastic with some alterations!  I made small cuts into the meat and inserted slivers of garlic for better penetration of flavor, cooked it on Convection for a crispier crust, and took the meet out at 125deg for med. rare. 135 is too high in my opinion.

I love this recipe! I had a 9lb Prime rib. I mixed all of the seasonings plus a teaspoon of dried sage in a food chopper until it had a paste-like consistency. I rubbed it all over the meat, covered it tightly with a Saran Wrap and placed it in the fridge for 24 hours. I then took it out of the fridge, place a meat thermometer in it, and let it come to room temperature for 6hours. I seared the roast at 450 degrees for 15mins then I turned it down to 325 degrees. I set my timer out to 2 hours. I checked the roast after an hour and 45 mins and it was at 135. So I took it out, tented it for about 30mins and it rose up to 140. (My house was at 72 degrees) It was a perfect medium rare in the center. It tasted great and it was so tender!

Scored the fat and placed the marinade on top pressing down on the marinade to soak into the cuts.  Make extra mixture  and add a little beef broth to the bottom of the pan.  Don't forget to make au jus and Yorkshire pudding with the drippings.

this was the best prime rib I ever made. Did as others suggested and started out at 460 degrees for 12 min and then 400 for 8 min then 325 for 1 hour. took it out of the oven when the meat reached 135 degrees and let it sit for 10 min. perfect

Followed this recipe as written and it was a real hit at dinner.  Prime Rib is our Christmas Dinner and I will use this recipe everytime. Highly recommend . Made adjustments for 7lb. roast. I did refer to the article for cooking times as was suggested by others. Wonderful

Amazing!  Simple but impressive.  I used the same amount on a 5 lb prime rib, as suggested and had a wonderful crust.  Thank you!

My family raved about the Rib Roast I made for Christmas dinner.  Everyone said it was better than any restaurant Prime Rib they had ever had.  It was the first time I had ever made a roast and I followed the directions...easy.  Thanks so much for making our Christmas dinner the best ever.

this recipe is AWESOME!!!!! i did do it differently. i got a 3.5 puond & used 15 cloves of garlic & crushed it. then added 2/3 cup of olive oil. i used same amount of salt & tyme even if it said for 10 pounds. i covered the whole rib eye & baged it. 15 hours later, baked it & served. OMG it was sooo good. a nice garlic flavor to it. thank you soo much. it satisfied my cravings.

This was the best recipe ever for prime rib. I've made this three times now and did it exactly how it is written and my family loves it! They said it's better than the nearby restaurant that is noted for prime rib. Thanks Chef Mike for a great recipe!

This may be 5 stars with a larger piece of met. I used a 3.5 lb piece of prime rib, which ended up being not cooked nearly enough by the time I thought it should be ready. I will try this again when prome rib is on sale and we have a large group for dinner.

This turned out so amazing!!! I didn't change a thing, made about 10lbs feeding 10 people and still had leftovers. I was nervous because I have always heard people making prime rib with rock salt but this was definately top notch.  Highly recommended.

Absolutely incredible.  I followed the recipe as described.  I took the prime rib out of the oven at 125, and tented it with alumnium foil until the temperature reached 145.  The meat was a perfect medium rare.  This recipe was so good that I made it twice this weekend!

This is a good seasoning recipe for prime rib.  I do have to say that I think your cook time is off.  I only used a 5 lb prime rib and it took an hour longer than your recipe stated. I will make this again but give more time for cooking.

Amazing! Best Prime we have ever had. We were nibbling the crumbs from the pan before the roast got to the table. Leftovers made terrific sandwiches! I followed the advice to cook at 450 instead of 500 to avoid smoke, and used a full recipe for a 6lb roast, rubbing the entire roast.  No need to go out for prime rib again.

I usually sear the meat in a skillet before putting it in the oven but decided to try this recipe. I started out at 500 degrees but after 10-15 minutes it started to smoke so I turned it down to 400 degrees for another 15 minutes. Then cooked at 325 degrees. The roast was flavorful and juicy. I received rave reviews from my family.

Perfect roast, had to adjust cooking time as meat was very red.  Followed recipe as stated and I added some Excaliber brand steak and roast rub to the marinade and it turned out juicy and full of flavor.

This was my first time cooking for 40+ people by myself. I was scared but I followed the recipe and it was the most amazing Prime Rib I have ever had just about. Every body, no exceptions, was raving about this Prime Rib Roast. I bought a 17lb piece at Costco and I followed the instructions. It was the easisiest cooking I have ever had to do. So simple and yet so delicious that I can't say enouph about it. I had a little left over that my son and I eate two days later and it still tasted as good as the first day! I will never forget this recipe and will always make it on large croud parties because of the peace of mind that it gives me. It is a guaranteed success and I did not even have a thermometer! The meat was cooked evenly all over, no raw spots, no overcooked spots either. The guy that sliced the meat was an experienced cood and he was shocked at how evenly the meat had cooked! That gave me the most satisfaction! I made 40+ people very happy on New Years Day and I was happier than them because it gives one the biggest pleasure when you know that all of your efforts paid off! 
TRY THIS RECIPE! YOU WILL LOVE IT.
One note, I made a gravy recipe that I lookep up on the web but it took almost two hours and then I found out I could have bought a better gravy already  made from Costco. Next time! 

Good luck,
Ioanna.

Very easy!! Wonderful flavor! Use a meat thermometer as I had to roast this almost 30min. longer to get it to 140. It was perfectly medium rare when we carved it.

Yummy! Very delicious. It took a little longer than expected.  We used an electric therm. to get the right reading.  Took it out at 135 degrees, covered with double duty foil, and waited until thermo. hit 145 degrees. We'll be using this again. Thanks!

Good recipe to make with what's always on hand. I used the same amount of marinade in the recipe for a 4 lb. roast and definitely needed all of it. Nice flavor.

I tried this recipe for our Christmas dinner.  It was wonderful!  The only issue I had was that the garlic burnt when I had it at 500.  I might next time not turn it on so high or put tin foil over the top.  The smoke detectors went off!

My first attempt at prime rib and it was easy and excellent!  I had an almost 8 lb. roast, used the full recipe for the garlic.  I also used the 460/400/325 method.

This is the second year in a row that I have used this recipe to prepare my prime rib for Christmas. I would always get so nervous preparing prime rib (becuase it is so costly) BEFORE this recipe.  It really is fool proof.  I added to the garlic flavor by stabbing the meat with a knife and tucking in full cloves of garlic.  It was amazing!

I love this recipe. I'm using it again this year on a smaller 3.75 roast. This time I pureed the garlic, rosemary, thyme and olive oil and added 1/4 of an onion. I coated the rib roast with this and let it marinate for 5 hrs then sat it at room temp for 1hr. Followed the directions and then served it up.. This was De-Licious!!!

Excellent recipe but cooking time is a little off for 10 lb standing roast.  Be sure to use thermometer for perfect prime rib - I enjoyed using this recipe for my first prime rib.  It tasted WONDERFUL!

Oh my GOSH!  EXCELLENT!  I was almost scared to try this due to the price of the prime rib at my butcher's.  However, it came out perfect!  If you don't like garlic--don't try it!  I put garlic in almost everything!  My mom loves prime rib and didn't like this due to the garlic.  I made exactly as the recipe called and stuck my meat thermometer in to time--it was perfect as listed.  Medium 130 degrees on timer after it sets for a momemt it will finish cooking to 140.

This recipe is wonderful and foolproof. My (rib eye) roast was only 5 lbs but I still used the same amount of rub and it was seasoned perfectly. Followed cooking directions exactly. Took roast out when the meat thermometer reached 140. After resting for 15 minutes, meat was cooked to a perfect medium rare. Made au jus by deglazing pan with 1 cup cab sauv, reduced, then added 2 cups beef stock, reduced. Thanks for the great recipe!!

Excellent!  I use this with various steaks and roasts all the time. Some find the outside cut of the roast to be too strong, but I love the extra kick.

This was my first time cooking prime rib and it was definately restaurant quality!  Even though I had a smaller roast than what the recipe called for, I used the same amount of rub/sauce.

I made this for New Years and it was outstanding.  I had to use regular Wesson oil, didn't have any olive oil but it was great regardless. I cooked an 8 lb roast. I cooked it in a 500 degree oven uncovered for 25 minutes, then turned the oven down to 200 for the remainder of the roasting time. It was the best prime rib I've every made!

This was so good! We enjoyed the flavor tremendously. Prime rib roast is a favortite of ours. We have tried 2 or 3 different methods of cooking it. We are giving this FIVE STARS. The roast  was just that yummy!

I made this for our Boxing Day dinner and it was a hit!  My roast was just over 10 lbs and 6 adults and 2 children pretty much demolished it!  As I needed my oven to make Yorkshire pudding, also from this site, I took the roast out at 140F, tented it with tinfoil to rest for 30 minutes.  Done perfectly.  Many thanks.

This steak...simply put...is amazing. To more clear, the marinade or whatever you call it, is amazing. 

I changed the amount of garlic from 10 cloves to 8 because, although I do love garlic, looking at the pile I made after mincing it seemed so much already at 8.

I experimented with this tonight using really cheap chuck roast just to see...next time, I'll definitely be using it on the real thing.

That's how I do things. If it can make a cheap piece of meat like chuck roast taste good, it must be a  good recipe.

This is superb. Thank you.

I followed this recipe for the cooking instructions not the marinade..... My prime rib roast was a 10 lb roast so I don't understand why it took MUCH long to cook. I did the 500 degrees for 20 mins and then it took another 2 1/2 hrs at 325 (we even increased the temp to 350 the last 45 mins) to reach the 140 internal temp. The roast was finaly done to a nice med-rare in the middle. Sorry but I wasn't happy that Christmas even dinner was delay so long...

This was excellent.  I used a 7 1/2 lb prime rib and it took about an hour extra to cook.  everyone raved about it.  Didnt need to use any sauce with it.  the flavor went all through the meat.

I tried this and while the flavor was great I prefer my traditional method of cooking which is 6 min per pound at 500', then turn oven off and do not open for 2 hours. I was disapointed that it was too over cooked and my regular way of cooking it gives you some rare, med rare, and well done to choose from.

I made this for Christmas and it was awesome.  The seasoning was great although I may cut back a little on the pepper to suit my taste.  The thyme works very well with the garlic.  I pulled the 7 lb roast out at 135-138 (can't tell as the lowest reading on my thermometer goes to 140) and it did continue to cook and jump to 142 F.  I would remove the roast sooner in the future for a little closer to rare.

This came out perfect! I too was nervous about cooking at 500 degrees for a full 20 mins, but I stuck to it and it came out great. Only thing I added was horseradish to the marinade-which was wonderful. I took it out of the oven when it reached 125 degrees and let it sit. It reached about 135 when I carved it. This made my Christmas eve! I will definitely make this again.

So delicious, easy, and really impressive! I have always followed the instructions to the letter, and have always had to cook the meat an extra 40+ minutes at 325 to get it to 145 degrees internally (no matter the oven I've used). Plan accordingly and this recipe is a huge hit! Serve it with a choice of plain horseradish and horseradish mixed with whipped cream.

Like many others this was my first time with a prime rib and I am so glad I tried this one, it was delicious and juicy, I did have to cook it longer for a 6.5 # prime rib but the family loved it and will become our new x-mas tradition thanks !

A special treat for Christmas Day that my family devoured! The only thing I would do differently next time is to take the roast out at 135 degrees as it wasn't as pink as they prefer it to be. Otherwise, fantastic Chen and thank you!

This recipe is amazing, better than imagined.  I had never cooked a prime rib before and most of my family are not even meat-lovers, but they loved this recipe.  

Followed recipe as directed using a 4.5 lbs roast.  The cooking time was a bit longer than recipe stated.

I've used this receipe a few times and it is the best.  I only made a couple of changes to it, I bake for only 12 minutes at 500 degrees instead of 20 minutes.  I also needed to add about 40 minutes to the cooking time and took the roast out at 135 degrees for medium rare.

I made this Prime Rib for my parents and brother for Christmas Eve and it was absolutely amazing!  I think this is my new Christmas Eve tradition!!  I chose to keep it simple and served the Prime Rib with homemade mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli.  The best part of the meal was soaking up all the juices from everything with a nice piece of fresh bread... yummy!

Made this tonight for Easter dinner. It was FABULOUS!!  My first time cooking prime rib, and it was delicious!  My guests loved it too. However, as others have found, it took way longer than planned.  I had an 8 lb. roast, so I figured on at least an hour and 20 min. but it took much longer.  Still, an excellent recipe.  SO easy, and it was just perfect.

Absolutely phenomenal. I highly recommend this recipe for anyone who wants to impress, but is short on time. I followed some of the other reviewers suggestions and they worked like a charm!

I don't think this recipe is that great. It is average. I added slightly more garlic but the meat came out a little too blend for my taste. Maybe I am just not a great RED MEAT eater.

This was my first time attempting to make prime rib. Dont be afraid of the salt,just make sure you get it all off the meat before serving. I did put a little garlic on top of the meat. Very good flavor and my inlaws were impressed!

I wanted to try something new so made this recipe.  Didn't much care for the garlic flavor.  Personally, I prefer cooking a prime rib on the rotisserie with a little season salt and pepper.

This was my first time preparing prime rib. We had family coming in from out of town and, with expectations high and a busy 9 month old at home, I needed an easy recipe. This one was perfect. I halved the recipe, as I had a 5lb roast and it turned out fabulously. Not an ounce was left over and it got rave reviews from everyone. I am not sure how long it cooked for, as I used a digital meat thermometer to ensure the roast was cooked to our liking. I will definitely make this again. Delicious!

I used this recipe for a 7lb filet mignon, it was delicious. I had to rely on a cooking themometer and I cooked it until the internal temp. was 155 F. I cooked it 20 min at 500 and about 1 1/2 hrs at 325. I used about double the olive oil. The smell coming from the oven while it was cooking was heavenly! Everyone loved it, a perfect Christmas dinner, thank you for posting!

Used the techique listed here...but rubbed with a mixture of dijon mustard and minced garlic.  I started the oven at 485 for 20 minutes.  Then I lowered it to 325 while my sides cooked in there as well.  I used my counter top meat thiermometer to gauge when it was done so I'm not sure of the time.

Amazing flavor!!! Definitely a keeper!!!

This was my first attempt at making a prime rib roast.  It was outstanding!  I took the advice of other reviewers and cut the thyme in half and added rosemary.  I also used kosher salt.  Be sure you have a good meat thermometer (mine was cheap and off by about 20 degrees!) and do take it out when it reaches 135 on the thermometer.  My family has requested this again for any day of the week!
