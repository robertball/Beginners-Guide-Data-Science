I don't give out 5 star ratings as often as I used to but we really enjoyed this salad and it is a definite keeper. I made a few small changes: chopped green leaf lettuce instead of romaine, roasted pecans instead of cashews, at least twice as much apple and pear and about 2 TBS less sugar. I wanted to have everything ready about an hour before it was time to toss everything together so I tossed the sliced apples and pears with some of the dressing. Besides staying nice and white they absorbed some of the wonderful dressing flavor. We enjoyed the Swiss cheese, but I want to try this with blue cheese next time. I think the sweetness of the dressing and the saltiness of the blue cheese would be perfect. 12/2004
Update 9/2007: I finally made this using blue cheese and I love it! My husband and I both liked it much better than the swiss cheese and this is the only way I will make it from now on.

Another tip: if you want to cut the apple and pear ahead of time, just toss it w/ a little of the dressing to prevent browning. Keep it in a separate container and add at the last minute.

This was very popular at our family dinner. The combination was different and tasty, but next time I will cut down on the sugar for the dressing. It was a little too sweet.
*UPDATE* I have tried this recipe with swiss, cheddar, and parmesan...and I think it is best without any cheese at all. To save time, I will often use bottled lemon poppyseed dressing and prewashed organic greens. I also use what ever nuts I have on hand but I like slivered (not sliced) almonds the best. This salad is ALWAYS eaten all up at church potlucks.

Made it for my office holiday party. It was a hit! Got lots of raves and a few people asked for the recipe. My modifications: (a) I doubled the recipe but instead of using 2 heads of romaine lettuce I used one head of romaine and 1 bag of spinach. (b)Omitted the Swiss cheese. (c) Instead of cashews I added toasted pecans (toasted myself). Nuts such as pecans and walnuts seem to match the fruit and season better. (d) I added some dried cherries along with the dried cranberries. (d)Despite having doubled the salad I only needed half as much dressing because the dressing was on the side.

Having the dressing on the side worked great. I used less, the salad didn't get soggy and the leftovers kept better. The leftovers were actually minimal. I made a huge bowl. Since the original recipes makes 12 - 1 cup servings, I made roughly 24 cups. At the end of the evening the rest fit tightly in a 3-cup Ziplock plastic storage container.

FANTASTIC!  The lemon poppyseed dressing is absolutely delicious.  Be sure to use freshly squeezed lemons and not the stuff out of the yellow plastic containers - - it does make a difference. I used butter lettuce instead of romaine, but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  The pears, apples, cheese, and cashews combined perfectly with the lemon dressing.  One word of caution - - this fed three hungry adults (two helpings for the men).  So don't be fooled by the "serves 12".  Your family and guests will go back for seconds, trust me!

This recipe is very yummy! 
I gave this a three star rating because I changed it a bit as follows:

1/4 cup sugar
1 tablespoon dijon
1/3 cup veg. oil

Everything else I kept the same. I felt that there was way to much sugar, and oil. With fiddling with the amounts I found it can increase the actual taste over sweetness. 
Increasing the Dijon mustard, and decreasing the sugar brings out the lemon, and Dijon tangy-ness that creates a more subtle taste.

Made this for Christmas dinner and loads of times since.  Its been a big hit.
I use a red onion which turns the dressing pink - its very pretty and I usually server it on the side.  Also I add all the ingredients into the processor together and I still get the same results (I didn't read the recipe right the first time !).
After the first time, I omit the chesse as I don't think it adds anything to the overall result.
As others have said there is way too much dressing for one salad but I always manage to use up the leftovers.

This is one of the best salads I have ever made!  I used about 2 cups of monteray jack cheese, 2 apples and probably another 1/2 cup of cashews.  It was perfect and the dressing is to die for!  It actually makes quite a bit of dressing, so you could easily add more lettuce and still have plenty of dressing.

I served this 2x in the same week! LOVED it! I made my dressing the day before so all the flavors would blend. Great! I used feta cheese (no swiss)and used Red Onion. I also cut up the fruit a few hours before and drizzled on some of the dresing, NO brown spots at all because of the lemon juice. I used a fresh lemons...the Best! Yeah it makes too much dressing for this serving...but it keeps well to throw on more salads, or it would make a great chicken marinade ... don't ya think?!!

I made this salad for a party and 9 people requested the recipe!  That let me know it's a winner.  It is now a favorite of my husband and me.  If I use a standard bag of pre cut/washed romaine lettuce then I halve the dressing recipe.  I often use 2 pears instead of the 1 apple, 1 pear.  Also, often add a few more cranberries since they are so pretty.  Even my kids love this salad.  An inspired combination.

This salad is outstanding!! I chose to omit the cashews and replaced them
with slivered almonds instead.  If I make this for lunch I include the swiss cheese
but if I'm making it to serve to company with a meal I omit the cheese.  This
recipe is a keeper and people I've made it for absolutely went wild over it!!!

Wow - what a fabulous, yet elegant salad to serve at a holiday get togther or anytime for that matter! It's got a wonderful combination of flavors, colors and textures. The dressing is absolutely delicious and the proportions are spot-on, if I had to change anything I would use just a little less sugar. But other than that is was perfect. I just threw everything into a mini-food processor and gave it a whirl then poured it into a container and added the poppy seeds last and just shook it up. I used butter lettuce vs. romaine and toasted walnuts vs. cashews. I soaked my apples and pears in lemon water so they wouldn't brown. The Swiss cheese was very good and next time I might try a blue cheese or even a feta. Great recipe that's very easy and something you'll want to make again!

Easily one of my favorite salads. My modifications: 1) I minced the onion very fine since I don't have a food processor. 2) I also used walnuts instead of cashews and it goes so well with cranberries. 3) I cube the apples in advance and dump them into a container with the dressing, This way when I'm preparing lunch for work in the morning I just scoop out the apples onto a bed of lettuce, toss in some nuts and berries, and I have a fantastic salad!

I would actually give it 3 1/2 if I could.  It was good, but seemed like it was missing something.  I used Havarti instead of Swiss.  Still, if you are looking for a fruity salad, this doesn't even come close to the Spring Strawberry Spinach Salad found on this site.

Unique and delicious! Served this to a large women's group and it vanished in a heartbeat. Saw ladies going back for seconds...but it was all gone by then! 
Terrific salad, one that I will make often. 
Does make alot of dressing, I didn't use quite all of it. May have been a smaller head of romaine lettuce that I used. 
Very good recipe, thanks for sharing!

I have been making this salad for several years, and each time have to go back to find the specifics for the dressing. Although this is not where I found the original recipe, it is the same. I read reviews of people changing things- please don't! Keep the swiss! Keep the cashews!! Keep the dressing- don't buy it!! Don't double the fruit!! If you don't like swiss, or cashews, poppy seed or craisens- make something else! Just sayin...

I made one change, which was to use toasted pecans (on hand) in place of the cashews. This salad is the perfect mixture of sweet, mellow, and tart - "fierce," as one friend described it. I took a 12-serving batch to a dinner party for 6 people, and we polished it off!  10/4/2017: This recipe makes more dressing than I need. I either leave the dressing ingredients alone and double the size of the salad, or make the salad as-is and cut the dressing in half.

Good but very sweet and I love sweet things. I would make again but cut the sugar at least in half...I never thought I would say that!

This has become one of my "go to" salads for important dinner parties, and for everyday meals when I want a treat. Everyone loves it. The flavors and textures are wonderful together. As other reviewers have said, I cut down on the sugar, probably by about a half. I have also sometimes substituted goat cheese crumbles for the swiss, which I actually prefer, but that's probably a matter of personal taste.

Wowzer! This salad is straight into my top favourites on here. I made this salad on Christmas eve and everyone kept saying how delicious it was. I did make one small change. I didn't have cashew nuts so I used pecans instead and I toasted them in a dry frying pan before adding to the salad. If the salad is going to last more than one day, I would recommend not only adding the dressing individually once on peoples' plates but also slicing and adding the pear individually as the pear slices can get a little mushy if added to the main body of the salad itself and kept until the next day.

I have made this numerous times and this always gets RAVE reviews.  You can definately vary the lettuce and fruits.  Big tip is I use splenda as a sub for the sugar and you can not tell one bit.

Delicious salad.  Perfect balance of flavors and textures.  Highly recommend to serve the dressing separately and let guests choose desired amount.  Use fresh lemons - it is worth it. Will definitely make again.

I made this at the last moment with ingredients I had on hand, but it was awesome! The lemon dressing I had made the night before was awful and I had company coming so I had to improvise. I found this recipe and made a few changes. I didn't have an onion but the dressing needed something so I substitued minced ginger-wow! This was amazing! I also kept my greens, crunchies, fruit and dressing separate so my guests could add what they wanted. Six people finished the whole salad.  I used 1/3 cup walnuts, 1/3 cup almonds and 2 T flax seed-toasted-for my crunchies. The fruit I had on hand was 2 clementines, 2 granny smiths and 1/4 cup dried cranberries. My salad greens included 5 oz. of baby lettuces and half a package of spinach. Can't wait to make this again-thanks!

The salad dressing was AMAZING!!  From now on this will be my salad dressing of choice.  It is that good! 

The salad was pretty good.  I made minor modifications...I used blue cheese instead of swiss cheese and that seemed to work well.  I also used pecans since I didn't have cashews at home.  I would make this salad again with those modifications.  Next time I'm gonna try adding dried cherries or apricots along with the cranberries.

This salad was quite delicious. I couldn't find everything perfectly, so I made small substitutions: plain walnuts instead of the candied pecans. This salad was very very sweet, and in the future I might add less sugar and/or a bit of vinegar.

I've been making this recipe for about 4 or 5 years now for Thanksgiving & Christmas.  It is always a hit.  I cut up the apples & pears & put it right in the dressing.  This keeps the fruit from turning.  I just toss it up before serving.  It is the perfect winter/holiday salad.  I always say I'm going to try it with walnuts or almonds, but always stick the cashews.

An amazing salad!!!!  I did not change anything (except that I did not peel the pear and apple) and it was outstanding.  I will be making this salad all the time from now on!! **Update** I had to write again about this salad.  I have made it non-stop since the first time I reviewed this.  I make this salad almost every day either for lunch or a side with dinner.  My husband is crazy about it too, which is great since it's not always easy to get him to eat veggies! I double the salad dressing and keep it in a tupperware container in the refrigerator and just treat it as a normal bottle of salad dressing and drizzle on however much I want.  Thank you so much for this recipe, it is one of my favorites on this website!!! :)

This salad received rave reviews tonight at the dinner table. Made with spinach instead of romaine and applewood cheddar instead of Swiss. Added some sliced green grapes (because I found them in the fridge) Very versatile salad recipe. Will defiantly make this or some variation of this again!

Yummy and so refreshing.  Huge hit with my family.  I used thinly sliced swiss instead of shredded and added grilled chicken breast to it to serve as a dinner. I also mixed the dressing by hand and didn't have any problem getting the ingredients incorporated.    Delicious !!!!  You can easily set aside some of the dressing to use at a later date, and I would definitely recommend dipping the sliced fruit in the dressing prior to assembling the salad.  It prevented the fruit from browning.  One caution...this salad definitely gets soggy as it sits so not as good as leftovers.

Terrific; great combination of flavors and textures.  I generally don't toss my salads with dressing, rather let people dress according to their preference.  Everyone at my table enjoyed it.
I roasted the cashews with melted butter... yummy!

This was fantastic! 
I used what I had on hand, since most of it was already in the house, and what wasn't was easily substituted...so spring greens rather than romaine, chopped pecans rather than cashews, and goat cheense crumbles rather than the swiss. 
I think the texture and flavor of the goat cheese probably compimented this better than the swiss would, anyway, especially reading some of the other reviews.
I didn't measure the dressing ingredients too carefully either...just did it by taste since I was only making enough for the 2 of us, but I think I probably used a bit less sugar, and a bit more mustard and onion, proportionally.  I can't wait to make it for company!

awesome! A very nice pick-me-up for our wet winters and gray skies, like sunshine in a bowl.
Thank you for sharing. I used red onion and it tinted the dressing pink. So pretty.

Made this salad for a pot-luck Holiday Dinner and it was the hit of the evening!  Great combination of flavors that complimented each other.  I've made several times since, the best results when I use freshly sqeezed lemon juice in the dressing.  A winner!

This is a delicious salad!  I used only about half of the sugar and lightly toasted/sugared walnuts rather than the cashews.  I even love to soak up the little bit of dressing left in my bowl with the French bread crust!  Yum!

I made this for my family and everyone raved about how good it was.  While the quality of your ingredients are always important, I believe it is fundamental to this recipe.  I used Gala apple, and red pear.  The pear was so sweet.  I took 6 slices of deli cheese and cut them into matchsticks rather than grated.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  I did not dress the salad, but kept the dressing in a container.  Refrigerating the leftover dressing is a BONUS that you can use on other salads.  THIS recipe is going to make its way to some of my holiday menus.  ABSOLUTELY wonderful, easy, & sure to be in my regular rotation. Thanks for a great dish!

Made this as a Christmas salad and have made it about a dozen times since!  This is such a light, crunchy, flavorful salad; even my children look forward to having this.  I've now added chicken breast to make it a meal in itself.

The salad components were great, but the dressing was disappointing. Maybe vinegar over lemon juice would be better.

This was not as special as I was hoping.  The dressing was okay, the cheese rather unnecessary, so overall not a special holiday salad.  Makes way too much dressing for the amount of salad too.

Very good salad; great textures and flavors from the fruit.  I used baking sugar which is a little more fine than regular sugar - I halved the sugar and it was still pretty sweet.  Next time I'll use even less sugar.

I made this for my Super Bowl dinner party.  When I described to my family what was in it, I had a lot of funny faces and negative comments.  Well, were they all shocked how much they loved it.  It had such a great taste and it was so easy!!  If you're not too sure if you'll like it, I suggest you try it because you might shock yourself.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

I gave it 4 stars because it is too sweet as is. I halved the sugar like other reviewers and it was perfect. I brought it to a church group and got several compliments. Thank you Nora

I made this salad for dinner tonight.  I mixed in some red leaf lettuce with the romaine. After reading the reviews, I used 1/3 cup of sugar.  I am allergic to them so I left out the onion.  I used fresh lemon juice and feta cheese.  I also used almonds instead of cashews only because I did not have any.   That all being said, this salad was delicious.  I left the dressing on the side and poured over the salad at the table.  The dressing is tangy  and sweet.  I have enough dressing to have on more salad tomorrow.  So glad I tried this and will be making this salad again.

This is an excellent salad, as written! Will try blue cheese next time, although swiss was good. Why would someone change the recipe then rate it 3 stars??? This is 5 star for my fam. of 4!

My children and husband said it was the best salad they had ever had!!  I followed some of the reviews and substituted toasted pecans for the cashews and dried cherries instead of cranberries. I also feel the Swiss cheese did not add anything but calories. The dressing is divine!  I'm addicted!!

Delicious! I made it just as it's written, and it was great! I also like salads with other types of cheeses and nuts, but the swiss and cashews make fantastic flavor combinations in this salad and in your mouth! Next time I will decrease the amount of sugar I use - it was a little too sweet for me, but still soooo delicious. Yumm!!!

I served this salad with our uncle's 96th birthday dinner, and everyone loved it!  It reminded me more of spring than of winter--the fresh tart/sweet flavors of the lemon juice/sugar mixture on the crisp greens woke my taste buds up and put them in a happy mood for the rest of the dinner! If you don't have a pear, just put in extra apple; and instead of just the dried cranberries, I used a dried berry mix consisting of cranberries, cherries and blueberries, which were great. I will definitely be using this as one of my main salad recipes, and I would imagine this will taste awesome on a hot summer day on our screened porch in August.

This was delicious.  I made the dressing exactly as the recipe indicated.  It was phenomenal and it kept well in the fridge.

I made 2 slight changes.  I used blue cheese instead of swiss and used toasted walnuts instead of cashews.  This was excellent

Every single time I make this salad people demand the recipe.  It's SO good and very versatile.  We like to add more of the fruit/nuts/cheese than the recipe calls for because that's how we like salads; but the flavor blend is awesome.   I would highly recommend making the salad dressing as it appears in the recipe - I have yet to find a bottled dressing that complements this salad so well.

Great recipe.  I have made this several times.  It's always a hit.  Beware the lettuce does start to wilt quickly once the dressing is on so wait until the last minute to do that!  I wouldn't change a thing!

The only rule for Thanksgiving dinner this year was that no one could bring anything they have every brought to the dinner before. We serve this recipe in our catering department where I work and it's a big hit, so I tried it. My family loved it! It's a keeper! Bet the rules change for next years dinner!

I really love this salad! I got this recipe off of this site a while ago and I can't tell you how many times I have made this. Every time we have a family gathering I make this and it gets devoured (and most of these people are salad eaters). The key is the wonderful dressing! If I don't have pears, I will just use apples, and most of the time I use raisins. Thanks for this yummy recipe!

Like everyone says - this is delicious just as written!  For variety, I was looking to replicate the Costco spinach salad with poppy seed dressing and this dressing was amazing!  Try this dressing over fresh spinach, tomatoes, boiled eggs, red onion, bacon, shredded mozzarella cheese, craisins, and walnuts.  Trust me, you won't be disappointed.

I have made this no less than 15 times over the years. I use Brianna Poppyseed dressing. I do not peel the fruit and use a corer/slicer for the fruit and then just chop into chunks. I have used many types of lettuce and they all work. The has never been a party w/o it. Can't go wrong. (I liked someone's idea of using pecans in lieu of cashews.) Will try it.

It doesn't get any better than this salad - it's AMAZING.  Just be ***SURE*** you use fresh squeezed lemon juice.  Makes all the difference in the world.  Also, even better than cashews are "Almond Accents" - the toffee-butter flavor if you can find it or honey roasted.

I love salads.  This one is no exception.  Delicious.  I made this just as the recipe is written.  I wouldn't change a thing.

Awesome combination!  I used toasted almonds instead of the cashews to change it a bit, but it
was a hit with my family and my guests.

I made this for a family party, and everyone loved it! It was nice to have something a little more interesting than the typical tossed salad. The lemon poppyseed dressing was delicious. As the maker of the salad, I got the leftovers, which were great for lunch the next day. The only change I made was to use cheese curds, because I love them, and I'm not so crazy about Swiss cheese. Thank you for sharing a delightful recipe!

This recipe is so good that I wish that I had doubled it for my party!  All the women were asking for more.  I could have had one recipe of the dressing and doubled everything else and it would have worked fine.  This is definitely a keeper!!!

I made this salad and dressing exactly as written, and it was a hit at the party I took it to. However, the great thing about this recipe is its tweak-ability ( yes it is a word- look it up!!) Reading a lot of reviews has given me so many ideas for the next time. Thanks for a keeper!

I make this often, and have just resorted to the bottled poppy seed dressing. When I take it somewhere I always mix it up there - the crisper the better!

I made this for our Christmas Eve buffet table and got rave reviews from everyone!  I doubled the recipe, but followed it completely. The ingredients really go well together and it was the first salad to be completely eaten up (we also had an antipasto and caesar salad).  Thank you.

I followed the recipe as written except I used 2 heads of romaine and it was a big hit at Christmas dinner. There was plenty of dressing for two heads of lettuce. It made enough for 14-16 people.

Very good salad, though I made enough modifications that I'm not sure I can rate it fairly.  Substituted Annie's papaya poppyseed dressing for homemade, pecans for cashews, and boucheron goat cheese for swiss.  It was delicious--one of the first dishes to be wiped clean at a potluck party last night!

I love this salad! My mom has been making this for a few years and it's just the perfect paring with a nice autumn dinner. It's easy to make, and has a wonderful sweetness to the dressing, along with the accompinment of the sweet fruits.  I am actually pairing it tonight with a pumpkin ravioli w/ gorgonzola cheese sauce.

Great salad dressing. I didn't have poppy seeds but the dressing was fabulous any way.  Also had to adjust the salad ingredients based on what we had since we're in the middle of a blizzard. Really!!  Will make is again very soon.

Very good salad.  I served this with our Christmas dinner, and everyone loved it.  The dressing is wonderful.  I used a combination of Romaine lettuce and baby spinach, and changed the nuts to walnuts.  I know I'll make the dressing a lot.  It would be good on any salad mixture.

This was awesome. I made the dressing 4 days ahead of time and it was great. I accidentally left off the apple and pear and it was great without it. Next time will not use them so I don't have to worry about brown spots.

Made this last night for a holiday dinner party, and it was excellent! I doubled the recipe for a party of 8, and we had about two cups leftover. Our guests unanimously raved about this, and all wanted the recipe. I used Honey Crisp apples and Bosc pears. Subbed walnut pieces for the cashews and used about half of the listed amount of shredded Swiss. Also, per the suggestion of another reviewer, I used red onion to give the dressing a little pink color. I cut up the pears and apples in advance and tossed them in a several TBS of dressing, and I later tossed this with the rest of the ingredients with one more TBS of dressing, and that was more than enough. I had tons of dressing leftover, as many other people have noted, so unless you like having it leftover, you can cut those amounts in half and still have plenty. Great recipe - this salad will be made very regularly. Thanks!

I scaled this in half to serve just 4 of us and wow, it is really good.  The dressing is fantastic.  You can blend it up ahead of time and keep in the fridge till you are ready to throw the salad together.  The flavors in the salad go so well together and you could really sub anything you like.  Next time I will use spinach and maybe sub gorgonzola for the swiss.  Thanks for this one!  I will make often.

This was so refreshing!  Thank you!  As others suggested I substituted with Feta cheese, pecans and two apples, eliminating the pear.  I also think using fresh lemons (4 large for serving 16) gives a very light flavor.  Since I was taking it to a church potluck, I cut up my apples the night before, putting them in a canning jar with water and 
Fruit Fresh.  Had lovely white apple pieces to mix up at last minute.
Addition:  made this again with Jonathon
apples and they turned to much overnight.  Use a firm, crisp apple!  Believe I used Gala or Fuji first time.

Made this salad for Thanksgiving and it got raves from everyone that tried it. The dressing definitely makes the salad special. I did make a few changes to what I put in the salad - used feta instead of swiss and toasted slivered almonds (was all I had), but other than that I followed the recipe. I recommend the feta with this salad combination. It worked very well. I made the dressing per the recipe except I didn't have dijon mustard so use regular yellow mustard. The dressing makes ALOT. My advice - put the dressing on the side and let your family/guests put it on themselves. Not eveyone ate the salad and what was left over had to be thrown away because I had put the dressing on the salad prior to serving and it wilted. Excellent recipe though. If you are a salad lover, I definitely recommend it.

We love this salad!  The tip to chop the fruits in advance and put them in a bit of the dressing to keep from browning really works! I had put aside a bit of the fruit (ok, I HID it so I could have a salad later!) - and just mixed it in with some lefover turkey, celery, onion, mixed a little of the poppyseed dressing w/mayo - and just ate the best turkey salad sandwich ever!  Dressing is deeeelicious!

i've given out this recipe twice already since making it the first time, and i made it again tonight.  confession: i used brianna's poppy dressing instead of making fresh because its just that good.  tonight i didnt have pear so i used broken mandarin orange pieces, and it was just as good if not better.   pretty to look at and even better to eat.  merci!

I made this for a dinner with my boyfriend's parents, and it was a big hit. Even though my boyfriend usually rebels when fruit is involved, he really enjoyed this salad and has asked me to make it again soon. All of the ingredients are very complementary.

This salad is great!  Everytime I make it there are several requests for the recipe.  I usually add more lettuce, fruit, & cashews.  The dressing goes a long way.

This is our favorite salad recipe now--I take it to all potlucks and serve it to guests at home. It is unique with the cheese, nuts and fruits. The dressing makes enough for 2 large salads. I always cut back on the amount of oil in the dressing to about 1/3 cup.

This is an amazing salad!!! I've made it many times for Sunday and holiday dinners. The only change I made was to cut down on the sugar just a bit, but it was still fantastic!  Before adding the poppy seeds to the dressing, I reserve a little of it and add it to the cut-up bits of apple and pear - this keeps them from turning brown. The other thing I love about this salad is that all the add-ons,i.e., cheese, cashews, etc. can be prepared ahead of time.  And all you have to do is to toss it altogether right before serving!

I used butter lettuce, left out onion and poppy seed and it was a big hit with the family. Will be making it again, per my Mother's request for her birthday.

I have made this salad numerous times over the years and it's great!  As with some of the other reviewers, I back off on the sugar a bit and it's still great.  I too prefer to leave the skin on the fruit for color.  I also make this in summer and substitute red grapes for dried cranberries.

After tweeking a bit, I loved this. Original was too sweet for me. Thus only 4 stars. I wish it was possible to give 4 1/2 though.

The combination of fruit, cranberries, nuts and cheese with the dressing make this a sweet salad with just a little tanginess.  Excellent flavor and fast/easy to put together.

Excellent salad, light but filling.  Have prepared it twice now with great raves.  The second time I made it I didn't have swiss cheese so I had to substitute Feta - it was just as good

OMG...this is an amazing salad year round.  The Swiss cheese married with the fruits & nuts is wonderful.  I did not have poppy seeds (thought I did) so left them out.  I had trouble not eating the fruit, cheese & nuts before even adding the Romaine & delightful dressing!  This is a winner!  Thank you for sharing the best salad ever!  My guests gobbled it up & asked for recipe.

Glad I read the other reviews first. I doubled the dressing recipe, using only 1/2 cup of sugar and it was perfect. Vegetable oil is not something I use, so I substituted 1/3 cup olive oil and 1/3 cup canola oil. I used the leftover dressing on plain spinach and lettuce the next day and it was great. The cheese and nuts are nice in a salad but I do not like swiss or cashews. I used sliced almonds and blue cheese. The cranberries and fruit were nice. This recipe will be added to my favorites.

I didn't have pears so I used strawberries.  Also used dried cherries instead of cranberries as it was out of stock.  My family loves it even my son who isn't keen on salad!  I will make it again!

How do you say winner!  A friend made this and put some fresh sliced strawberries in it.  Any kind of nuts works:  pecans, walnuts or toasted sliced almonds. (I know strawberries aren't a winter fruit)!

i served this at a Volunteer potluck after the holidays everyone loved it! (I did cut back sugar in dressing to 1/3 cup as some reviewers recommended--might even go a bit less next time).  Got voted the number one dish that day!

This was so DELICIOUS!!! My husband laughed and said I was making too much salad, but between the two of us and my two teenagers, my huge salad didn't stand a chance. Served with pan seared swordfish and garlic bread, and it was perfect. This may actually be on the Thanksgiving table this year. Thank you for sharing!

This is one of the best salads ever!! Didn't change a thing and it was a hit!! Even the ones who do not really like fruit in their salads, love it and went for more. The dressing is out of this world. I love salads and make them all the time. This is a must! You will love it.

The dressing is very easy to make and has a great taste! I used Honey Dijon-mustard because that was all I had on hand and it was great.

This was such a great salad!  I loved the combination of fruits.  I did make one change.  I used walnuts instead of the cashews.  I just like walnuts better.  Will definitely make again!

Always a hit!!  I make the dressing exactly as called for but use blue cheese, candied pecans, Bosch pears, honeycrisp apples, and blueberries.

Perfect, I used walnuts instead of the cashews, added a cup of dried cranberries, and used 4 pears to enhance the flavor.

The dressing is absolutely delicious! This is the very first dressing I ever attempted and my fiance loves it. I would cut back on the sugar the next time but everything else is divine.

The best salad EVER!  I followed the recipe exactly. I'm not a fan of swiss cheese, but used it anyway.  It was amazing!  Even my father in-law loved it and he hates trying new things.

LOVED IT!!! Made this for Thanksgiving and it was so good. Everyone loved it. My only suggestion is to serve the dressing separate so it does not make the salad soggy if it sits out for a little bit.

Delicious!  I wouldn't change a thing!  It was a hit at our family Thanksgiving celebration, and I had several requests for the recipe.  I'll make this again and again.  The dressing is superb.

This is delicious! I read other reviews that suggested cutting the sugar to 1/4 c. from 1/2 c.- I did and it was terrific still. I used  Fugi Apple and a Bartlett Pear- Oh, and I used fresh grated Parmesan instead of Swiss, just because I didn't have any Swiss.

This salad was wonderful!  It was elegant and worthy of a nice occasion.  The only change I made was to substitute almonds for the cashews (due to an allergy) and it was still every bit as good.  Thank you for sharing- I will definitely be making this again.

I made the dressing first and almost stopped to review this recipe as soon as it was done becasue the dressing alone makes this a 5-star recipe!  This was SO good!  My new favorite salad recipe.  I used toasted pecans and left the peel on the apple for prettiness.  I also used a spring greens salad mix and threw in some leftover spinach I had on hand. I also served the dressing on the side so I could keep the leftovers. You will end up with WAY more dressing than you need, so you might as well just double the salad ingredients - it's so good you'll want more anyway!

Warning - you must bring a copy of this recipe with you whenever you bring it to a potluck, since you will surely be asked for it by someone.  When bringing it, I chop the apples and pears and put them in the dressing so they won't brown.  Then I add that to the rest of the salad just before serving.

I've made this recipe several times, making alterations after the 1st time. The dressing is perfect as is (make sure to use fresh lemon juice). However we have found that blue cheese and walnuts taste better to us. I give the walnuts a quick "roast" in the microwave (2 minutes)for the best flavor.    I make the dressing several hours in advance and coat the fruit with some of it to also set during that time.    We like a spring mix instead of romaine, but if that is all I have I've found it works better if you chop it rather finely instead of using Caesar salad sized pieces.

Another great recipe from this site. My husband and I loved the dressing which I served on the side. I used shreds of parmesean cheese as I do not care for Swiss. This is as good as Jamies Spinach Strawberry Salad. Will try a spring mix blend of lettuces next time.

Another great recipe from this site. My husband and I loved the dressing which I served on the side. I used shreds of parmesean cheese as I do not care for Swiss. This is as good as Jamies Spinach Strawberry Salad. Will try a spring mix blend of lettuces next time.

I only made the dressing, not the salad.  It was fantastic!  So tasty, and not too heavy.

The dressing is quite tasty!
I used a handful of shallots because they were on hand, rather than onions.  They gave it a nice, complimentary sharp flavor.

I added candied walnuts and beemer cheese instead, very tasty!

This salad and dressing are amazing!  I got many requests for the recipe when I brought it (sans cheese) to a party.  I usually am not big on salad dressing, but I would definitely make this one often.  I didn't try this with shredded swiss because I was skeptical about the visual appeal and taste.  But crumbled gorgonzola is divine!  The buttery and salty taste of gorgonzola perfectly compliments the sweetness of the fruits.

Made this for a holiday dinner party - a festive and delicious addition to the table. I added some slices of fuyu persimmons and kiwi - the colors of both were really pretty and they tasted great along with the other parts of the salad (and they are winter fruits).  Used toasted pecans rather than cashews and did not use the cheese (too much for this dinner).  Tossed the greens with about a third of the dressing, plated that, and then put a scoop of fruit and a few nuts on top of each plate - easy, attractive and everyone loved it!

I felt really badly, because I took this to Thanksgiving dinner at my in-laws, and no one could stop talking about it!!  It stole the attention!  I would give this 10 stars if I could.  Don't skip out on making the dressing...it's worth the extra 5 minutes it takes to make it.  The bottled dressing is not the same.  I did cut back on the sugar a tad in the dressing, and I used fresh lemons.  But I followed everything else as written.  I will be making this salad over and over again!

This has been the only salad I'm allowed to bring to family gatherings for several years.  I certainly don't mind-it's easy to make and healthy. I don't pour all of the dressing on the salad...the extra dressing left I use to marinate pork tenderloins later in the week for dinner.

This was very good.  I made this without the cashews due to allergies in my family.  I served this with a spicy dish and it was good as the salad was cooling on the pallet.

Really good.  Brought to dinner over the holidays and was asked to bring it again for a party.  The dressing is very tasty, but you definitely don't need it all.  Romaine hearts and ripe pears make this special.

WOW! THIS SALAD IS DELICIOUS! I LOVE IT AND SO DOES MY HUSBAND! HE NEVER LIKES SALADS! I LEFT OUT THE POPPYSEEDS FROM HIS PORTION OF THE DRESSING SINCE HE CAN'T HAVE THEM AND IT WAS STILL YUMMY! ALSO, I RECOMMEND DOUBLING THE APPLE/PEAR PORTION IF YOU LIKE FRUIT! TO MAKE IT EVEN EASIER, I USED A BAG OF ROMAINE LETTUCE RATHER THAN PURCHASING A HEAD! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ONE! THIS IS A KEEPER! THANKS!

Not a salad eater buy my sister in law made this and my husband and I were hooked.  I then went on a salad rampage and made this the day after.  I had more company during the week and made this again-we couldn't get enough.  I did as one reviewer said and saved time and ingredients by using Brianna's Poppy Dressing.  This ones a keeper.

I discovered this recipe on this site years ago and made it for my father's birthday. Two brother-in-laws who don't "eat' salad discovered it and made eating it a life-changer! Since then I always make it for special occasions, and if I try to skip, my son-in-law phones to check if I was planning to make it - hint! hint! Sometimes I use shredded cheddar, sometimes pecans, sometimes regular mustard. Fresh lemon juice makes it wonderful. This salad is a crowd pleaser.

I thought this would go over better at Thanksgiving. I used feta cheese, that was the only substitution. Maybe I'll try this again and see if it goes over better.

Very good salad and great dressing.  I followed the advice of others and cut the sugar back a bit, while also increasing the Dijon mustard slightly.  Will be adding this to my permanent recipe files.

Nice salad during off-seaon when the full variety of veggies are not available.  Made half the quantity of dressing, which was perfect for us. Cut back the sugar to one quarter cup. Did a rough chop of the whole cashews and a fine grate of the swiss.  Kids 14, 12 and 8 enjoyed.

Made this for Christmas dinner at a friend's house and it was a big hit.  I used good blue cheese but had to pass it separately because one person was allergic.  The dressing is excellent.

Fantastic.  I did make one small change and used almonds (toasted) instead of cashews because I love them.  Very very good.  We couldn't stop eating it.

I've made this the past 3 Christmases to go with our ham dinner.  Can't believe I've not reviewed this!  Everyone raves about it.  Even some picky family members have been convinced to try it and end up loving it--especially the dressing which is amazing.  I follow the recipe to a "T", with the exception of using slivered almonds instead of the cashews.

Great salad! Wouldn't hurt to leave the skin on the fruit, IMO.  I only needed half the dressing. Next time I'll serve dressing on the side.

As written, I give 3 stars. It's too sweet for my taste. If interested, I made a couple changes on the 2nd go with this recipe. I omitted the sugar completely, and used the juice from the can of mandarin oranges.I also used the oranges. They are VERY tasty in salads with the sweet /savory appeal. I cut the Swiss cheese and used a nice,pungent Gorgonzola in it's stead.Cashews are so pricey,I only eat them alone so I can savor them. In their stead, I added some chopped pecans. YUM! Overall, a nice base recipe. Even better with minor tweaking.

Although I haven't made the salad, I've made the dressing.  It is the best dressing I have ever made.  I've bought bottled poppyseed dressing and nothing compares to this dressing.  I don't have a food processor, so I used a wisk to mix the ingredients and it worked just fine.

I've used this recipe for our holiday gathering for several years now.  We provide the meal for about 60!  It is easy to chop and prepare ahead of time and toss before serving.  It is very festive.  I sometimes cheat and buy the already cut-up romaine lettuce. It's a good idea to toss the apples and pears with a bit of the dressing. Pecans work great for the nuts also.

I have been making this same salad for years with my own poppy seed dressing (vinegar instead of lemon juice and dry mustard instead of Dijon) and love it!  Sometimes I just make up the fruit minus the romaine for a yummy fruit salad.

This was a great recipe, but I did make a few changes and OMGosh was it good!  Just left out the mustard (mostly because I didn't have any and stores were already closed for xmas..lol) changed the veg. oil to olive and changed the nuts to toasted walnuts. wow was it ever good.  Very light and took the prime rib and ultimate twice baked potatoes and croissants to the next level.  This will definitely be a keeper, even with the small changes.

Absolutely delicious and refreshing salad! I made a few changes because I did not have all of the ingredients! Instead of cranberries, I used fresh blue berries which tasted great! I also used Mozzarella instead of Swiss cheese. Finally, I used mixed nuts instead of cashews! The salad was so refreshing, I will definitely make it again!

Love the sweetness of the fruit with the cheese and lettuce. I did substitute an herb goat cheese for the swiss cheese.

I gave it 5/5 stars because it just a great salad as it or with some tweaks.  I did forget to put the mustard in this time, and I used walnuts only because thats what I had on hand.  I cut the sugar in half, and didn't add cheese. I also added about 2 Tbsp of red wine vinegar.  Turned out great friends and family loved it.  A few wanted the recipe so I sent a link to them from here.  Next time I think I'll add seedless grapes, kiwi, and/or other fruit with an assortment of nuts.  The review using half spinach and half lettuce sounds great as well.

Very good! I made the salad dressing by omitting the poppy seeds and the mustard. Only used lemon juice and two tablespoons of sugar. Also I used carmelised pecans instead of cashews...perfect.

More popular than I even expected with all the guests at the Christmas gathering.  They had lots of food to choose from at the buffet style dinner, and the sald went over really well.

Haven't tried this recipe yet, but it is almost identical to one I've used from a Gooseberry Patch Christmas cookbook.  My family loves it!

My kids didn't like it. My husband wouldn't even try it. I thought the taste of the dressing was too much for this and would've liked a sweeter sauce.

This is a great recipe, the dressing is delicious, it's very tart and sweet tasting.  I made it a day in advance.  I did use Spring Mix instead of romaine, which I think is a more appropriate base.  Skipped the cheese, and subbed toasted pecans for the cashews.

Made according to recipe. Used mixed organic greens. Loved the cashews and glad I used them instead of other nuts. Delicious!

So good!  I made this exactly as written and it got rave reviews.  There was too much dressing for us, however.  Next time, I will make half of that...  This will definitely be made again and again in my house.

It was an amazing salad.  I didn't use as much lemon juice as it called for (about half) and didn't use the pears.

My son made this salad for our family on Christmas Eve this year. This was one of the best salads that I have ever eaten. The recipe was shared with quite a few of us that night. I am adding this salad to my favorites.

I received rave reviews after bringing this to thanksgiving dinner.  The only change I made was to buy poppy seed dressing instead of making it.  The Paul Newman brand was amazing.

I absolutely loved the salad. I don't make a lot of salad but decided to go with this one based on the remarkable high ratings.  I made few modifications, instead of vegetable oil; I used Extra Virgin Olive Oil and also used grated Parmesan cheese instead of Swiss.  The salad was a HIT on Thanksgiving dinner. Most of friends asked for the recipe.  Thanks for the awesome recipe!! This recipe is definitely a keeper!!  :)

wonderful salad...made everything exactly except cut sugar down to 1/4 cup per other suggestions...I cut the apple and pear up right before serving...the next day they were still fresh looking and had not turned brown... I kept dressing on the side so each person could add the amount they wanted..delish!

I had to improvise a bit with this one, but still came up with a lovely salad, worthy of 5 stars, as I’m sure the original is.  I didn’t have a pear, so I just included more apple instead.  And I didn’t have cashews, so I used toasted almond slivers.  What put this over the top for me was the Swiss cheese – a wonderful addition.  The dressing is exceptionally good and I’ll be trying it on other salads as well.

I make this salad for Thanksgiving dinner and everyone loves it.  I pair the lemon poppyseed dressing and romain lettuce with strawberries and goat cheese for Easter dinner.  Equally delicious.

This was absolutely wonderful! I usually don't change recipes before rating but I did decrease the sugar to 1/4 cup on this. I also used slivered almonds and feta cheese because that is what I had on hand. Everyone raved about this salad, even my hisband who is very picky about salad dressings. I am sure  that I will make this many times in the future!

Yum!  This is so good!  I used half the sugar and it was great.  I also substituted extra sharp cheddar for the Swiss delicious.  Brought it for Easter dinner and everyone loved it.

I love this salad! It is different from an everyday vegetable salad, easy to make and impresses the teenager in the house. I like it with scallions for a boost of dark green color. It's just as delicious if you peel the fruit, but I like the look of the peel in the salad.

This salad and dressing are PERFECT!!!!!!! DEFINITELY THE BEST EVER!!! I have never done a review before, but had to for this recipe!  I often cook for groups at church and don't serve anything that is less than the very very best.  This salad will certainly uphold my reputation of being a great cook!

This is such a good salad.  Very light and refreshing flavor.  I love it with the cashews.  Not a big fan of swiss, so I used shredded mozzarella instead and it was really good.

Tasty and easy dressing! I halved the amount of sugar and used feta instead of Swiss cheese. I can't imagine how sweet it would have been with the full amount!

Excellent! The dressing is on the sweet side, but tastes great and goes perfectly with the fruit, cheese and nuts (my cashews were salted, which was also nice). I left the apples and pears unpeeled by preference. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for 130 women at a church dinner. It was a hit! To stretch it, I added spinach leaves and threw in some tropical mix instead of the separate nuts/cranberries.  The dressing is fantastic!

EXCELLENT!!! I had rave reviews at a BBQ over Labor Day. What I did: -Used toasted pecans ( I had them already) -Left out the cheese -Halfed the oil in the dressing -Used fresh squeezed lemon -Used ALL of the sugar it called for!!!  What an incredible salad.  I will make this salad regularly.

Made this dressing and salad the other night....outstanding. Whole family loved it. 16 year old son said, "Apples in salad???" and proceeded to demolish his portion and another. Trying it tonight for guests with a crumbled Stilson cheese with apples and pears I picked up at Costco.  Followed directions exactly as stated...a big hit. Thanks

I had this at a party last weekend and for some reason, it really hit all the right notes with me, so I made it at home last night.  It's a really great combination; my only quibbles are that the swiss cheese seems a bit pointless, since the mild flavor of swiss gets lost under the tangy dressing, and that the dressing might be a bit too sweet.  I think next time I might cut the sugar down a bit, as some other reviewers have suggested, and either skip the cheese or use something with a slightly stronger taste, like sharp cheddar.

Lovely recipe!! My work has a WONDERFUL spinach strawberry salad in which the poppyseed dressing is used. It is spinach leaves, strawberries, mandarin oranges, onions, and sunflower seeds - but I dislike the oranges and onions on there. Perhaps some of you would like to try this dressing on something similar!! :)

This is an excellent salad.  Unfortunately, I foolishly bought the apple and pear at a store with low-quality produce, so they weren't good in the salad, but I think they would be good if their quality had been higher.  I used slivered, toasted almonds instead of cashews and feta cheese instead of swiss.  There was lots of extra dressing, but fortunately I had extras of the other ingredients, too, so I got to have more salad the next day.

I used slivered, toasted almonds instead of cashews and feta cheese instead of swiss.  There was lots of extra dressing, but fortunately I had extras of the other ingredients, too, so I got to have more salad the next day.

Made this last night.  It was delicious.  I might adjust the dressing with a little less sugar and more lemon for more tang and less sweet.

This salad was a huge hit at a dinner party I had this past weekend.  Thanks for sharing it.  I am going to make this again tomorrow for a potluck.  This time I will not add all of the dressing.  Although very tasty ... I felt like all of it was too much.  Loved the salad.

I've made this several times, and have loved it each time.  Any time I take it somewhere, people ask for the recipe.  I make it just the way it is outlined, except I usually add more cashews and dried cranberris, becasue they are so good.

Brought this to a potluck. I ommitted the cheese and replaced the cashews with almonds and reduced the sugar by half. It was still very sweet. Anyhow it was a huge hit and a coworker who does not eat vegetables asked for the recipe. I am making this again this week and trying with the swiss cheese.

Great!  I've hade a lemon poppyseed dressing that was creamy so I was happy to see that although sweet, it is not creamy (i.e. less fattening!).  I don't have a food processor, so I just mixed quickly.  Don't know if having a foor processor would alleviate problem with separation, if only a bit, but still good.  The dressing is too much for the amount of lettuce I have.  I don't think you'll need that much unless you want it smothered.  Didn't add the onion, used dried cherries rather than dried cranberries, blue cheese rather than Swiss (although as another reviewer suggested, may not include cheese at all next time), used olice oil used slivered almonds rather than cashews.

This is an excellent salad.  I always put in mangos and fresh strawberries, -instead of the two fruits she adds.  It gets raves all the time!  You could add some sugar baked pecans instead of the cashews.  I'll have to try it that way!  Aw, heck, it's good the way it is!

Have said it before, as has everyone else!  Try this salad!!  Make is "as is" the first time, but serve dressing on the side.  Then tweak it as you like.  Very versatile.  Great with Splenda or sugar.  I have made with several different nuts and cheeses, as well as dried mixed fruits, cherries, etc.  Never disappointing.  Catered my office Christmas party and this was the salad.  I had none left!!  Don't be afraid of the combo...just close your eyes and step into heaven.....

I have uses feta cheese which is amazing with the salad, it addes to the flavor rather than take away. I noticed alot of people didnt like the cheese so i would suggest trying feta. as for the apples getting brown if you soak them in lemon water first you wont have that problem.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a huge success.  There were a few who did not try it initially, but quickly helped themselves after they heard all the raves from those who did try it.  The dressing is so light and goes perfectly with the ingredients in the salad ... although you don't need to double the dressing because there's more than enough even when you double the salad ingredients.  I went with 2 bags of Romaine and doubled everything else to comfortably feed 14 people.  After cutting the fruit, I tossed it into a little bit of the dressing to keep the fruit from turning brown.  Not until I was ready to serve the salad did I toss a little more dressing into the salad.  Again, I had lots of dressing left over.  The swiss cheese and cashews may sound strange, but they are absolutely delicious in the salad.  This salad perfectly complements a heavy Thanksgiving/Christmas meal.

This is a clever, yet simple, recipe that we absolutely love! Not being a fan of cashews or Swiss cheese, I've always omitted both in favor of pecans and sliced almonds, and bleu or feta cheese. Other things that take this salad from "good" to "WOW!" are the additions of fresh raspberries and dried apricots. I've also recently found a Blueberry Pomegranate bottled dressing (Maple Grove Farms brand(?)), with just the right kick of black pepper for this salad. Thanks so much for a great recipe!

Love this salad, especially the dressing, whicn I prepared on the side for the picky eaters.  I added cherry tomatoes, omitted the nuts because of allergies and used shredded gruyere instead of traditional swiss.  I also squeezed some lemon over the apples and pears to keep them from browning.  It was awesome and a nice alternative for Thanksgiving rather than the traditional mixed green salad.

This was wonderful!  I brought it to a party and everyone commented on it!  I did not add cheese and for the nuts I used almond slices I toasted in the oven.    The amount of dressing it calls for is way too much.  Next time I will probably make half of what the recipe calls for.  I also only used 1/4 cup of sugar in the dressing and it was plenty sweet enough for me!

FANTASTIC.  I have made this recipe 3 times in the past month and everyone I have served it to loves it. The only change I made was to add some mandarin oranges.   It adds a little more color and they taste good with the dressing.

This is a delicious versatile salad recipe.  The dressing is delicious, but not overwhelming, and very complementary of the other flavors.  It was a great addition to our holiday menu.

This is a fantastic recipe! I used SweetnLow in place of sugar (husband is Diabetic) and everyone who has tried it has asked for the recipe!

This came out wonderful!!  I took another member's advice and sprinkled lemon juice over the fresh fruit to avoid browning.  
Thanks for such a great recipe!

Wonderful flavors. I substituted pomegranate seeds for dried cranberries and it was equally festive.

Every family meal I go to, people ask me to bring this salad.  It's delicious - sweet and refreshing.  Beware of the onion (better to put too little than too much, it can be overpowering).

Yummy! Don't skip the dressing in favor of store bought to save time it is the best part, incredible. I used real lemons to squeeze the juice and I would recommend that. It took 2 lemons well squeezed.

Love this salad, and friends request it all the time!  Just be really careful about measuring the diced onions you put in the dressing.  They can really overtake the yummy flavor if you accidently put too many in there!!

This has become one of our holiday standards. It's a great addition to the usually heavy Thanksgiving or Christmas dinners, and the flavours are wonderful. I've experimented with a bunch of mild cheeses, and find that Havarti is my favourite in this recipe.

This salad is the BEST I have had in a very long time.  Easy to make and ALWAYS gets great comments at parties.  Make sure that your lettuce is WELL drained before making would be my only comment.  Try this and you'll be pleasantly pleased.

Made this salad for family Christmas Eve dinner everyone loved it.  It's very colorful and the homemade dressing makes this salad great.  Be sure to peel apple and pear at the last minute due to browning.  I will make this salad again!

This recipe is from Taste of Home magazine, and I just made this delicious  salad several days ago! I did not have cashews on hand, but it still turned out really great. Next time though I will use less sugar.

I made this salad as the third course of a seven course meal which included filet mignon as the main course and everyone raved about this salad and the dressing.  It is FANTASTIC!  I , too, used 2 TBLS less sugar than the recipe called for.  I also toasted the cashews.  There was plenty of dressing leftover so I also tried it with blue cheese and it  was also fantastic!

Somehow Swiss cheese in such a salad skipped my imagination. Thanks for the great idea! ****QUICK TIP*****: if you have a hand blender (stick version), place all dressing ingredients in a jar and blend it in that. Slowly lift the blender wand up towards the mouth of the jar. With this method, the oil does not have to be drizzled in that way (same with mayo). Have a tall cup with sudsy water (or maybe another jar). The blender wand cleans up in no time at all. Simple. Less clean up.  Store leftover dressing right in the jar you mixed it in!  Have another salad with greens, fruit, nuts, and possibly cheese of choice later in the week.... and the dressing will be all ready!

Somehow Swiss cheese in such a salad skipped my imagination. Thanks for the great idea! ****QUICK TIP*****: if you have a hand blender (stick version), place all dressing ingredients in a jar and blend it in that. Slowly lift the blender wand up towards the mouth of the jar. With this method, the oil does not have to be drizzled in that way (same with mayo). Have a tall cup with sudsy water (or maybe another jar). The blender wand cleans up in no time at all. Simple. Less clean up.  Store leftover dressing right in the jar you mixed it in!  Have another salad with greens, fruit, nuts, and possibly cheese of choice later in the week.... and the dressing will be all ready!

LOVE THIS SALAD!  I made it with a creamy poppyseed dressing and used blue cheese instead of swiss and it was amazing!

I've made this dressing a LOT and it has never disappointed.  I didn't have a yellow onion once and used a red one.  It made a nice pink dressing and the flavor was still fabulous!  I always have people ask for the recipe.  Definitely a keeper!

I made this for dinner and used Olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and used dried cherries soaked in water and drained, instead of cranberries.and it was so good.

I have an almost identical recipe from another site & have been making this salad for many years.  It is outstanding and always gets many recipe requests.  I prefer to leave the skins on the fruit & always use Honeycrisp apples and red pears. I also think that using finely grated swiss cheese is really important as it is a strong tasting cheese & when shredded finely, balances nicely with the lemony dressing and fruits.  Be sure to give this one a try!

This is a nice salad with really good ingredients. We like fruit in our salads and having 3 kinds in the salad was very good. The dressing is light and adds a nice sweetness to the salad. I served this with 'White Chili VI' from AR and my version of the soup 'Spicy Chicken and Bean Soup'.

I've made this several times.  I used to save it for large gatherings, but I decided that's just silly.  I make the dressing, and put it in a container to use as needed.  When out of Dijon mustard I've used grainy (German-style) mustard.  I had to taste and play with the amount, but it still turned out fine.  I prefer toasted sliced almonds or sunflower seeds to cashews.  And we like a strong tasting cheese, like Gorgonzola.  You can play with the fruits, too.  

Thanks for this recipe, Nora LaCroix.  It's a keeper!

I thought this salad was incredible!  The dressing was AMAZING and the salad was delicious.  I am embarrassed to say I didn't follow it to the letter, which I like to do when I  make a recipe for the first time.  I had no Swiss cheese but I did have goat cheese so I substituted that ~ still terrific!  

Try this - it's easy and so tasty!

This has become a Christmas tradition at our house. It’s easy to make ahead and just add the apple and pear before serving, or toss with lemon-lime soda or lemon juice to keep from browning. I’ve substituted pecans and English walnuts for the cashews. It’s very light and tasty. Thank you for a great recipe!!

I made this salad exactly as given and it was great! (I think it is more interesting if used with a lettuce blend.) Also, if you want to make the salad a couple hours ahead of time, put the diced fruit on the bottom of the bowl, drizzle a little of the dressing on the fruit, stir,(so the fruit doesn't turn brown) and then put the lettuce, then everything else on top.  Pour the dressing on and toss when ready to serve.

I think this salad would be great too as a big salad for lunch or dinner if you add chicken.  Could even add left over turkey after the holidays.

Used Blue Cheese instead of Swiss. Toasted walnuts instead of cashews and reduced sugar to 1/4 c. and added 4 Tbsp. Stevia (to cut the calories a bit) . Wonderful, thank you for the recipe. 
Have a Great Thanksgiving and a Very Merry Christmas to All.

I have made this recipe according to the directions for the last 4-5 years and I ALWAYS get asked for the recipe...I would not change a thing except that I do cut up the pears and apples in advance and mix a little of the dressing with them...and then I can just toss the rest of the ingredients...the important part about any CRISP salad is washing and DRYING your greens thoroughly...this is great for company and is so fresh tasting!

I absolutely love this salad.  I have been making it a regular part of special meals for over a year.  It's well liked by all in my family as well as guests.  I wouldn't change a thing about it!  I often get asked by my Mom to take it home and the dressing too!  It's a great salad!

Very good.  Maybe because I used a sugar substitute, it came out a little too sweet; next time I'll use less of it.

Really delicious salad!  I only used 1/3 cup sugar and I thought it was perfect!  I can't wait to make this again!

Pretty good.... While not one of the best salads I've ever had, this was quite yummy nonetheless. Having said this, I am not a huge fan of pears OR cashews but I enjoyed the combination of both in this! It's the gritty texture of pears that I don't particularly care for, but I found that Comice pears are just what I like - extra sweet with a soft / silky flesh and creamy bite (perfect!). I LOVED this variety of pear in this salad and found that it perfectly complemented the crisp, sweet-tart Honeycrisp apple I paired it with! Although I probably won't serve this salad often (again, this was good but not WOW good...), I will almost definitely add the dressing recipe to my "keeper" file. It was absolutely delicious, can be used on a variety of items (I'm trying coleslaw next!) and it kept my fruit fresh and bright until I was ready to toss it with everything else (as LINDABTX did, I also added a bit of dressing to my pre-cut fruit beforehand). For these reasons alone, I'm glad I stumbled upon your recipe! Thanks for sharing, Nora! :-)

Great salad for the winter, and good for you. I did use a sweet and sour poppy dressing (Martins Grocery), and added Dijon mustard. Worked perfect. I also used Montery Jack cheese. I believe any cheese will do. However I used Walnuts I had on hand, I will use different nuts next time.

Made this salad many times now. My family loves it. Very refreshing. Makes way more dressing than needed. You can also substitute different nuts and cheeses. I used walnuts the last time and it was just as delicious.

I thought it was fresh and light. I used pecans instead of cashews, and sliced some grapes in addition to the pear and apples. The second time I made it, it turned out much better, because I sliced the apple and pear much thiner, and was more liberal with the swizz, nuts, and dressing (though not soaking, just a healthy amount); it made it much more flavourful, and everything came together wonderfully well. We served it with hambugers; a good pair.

This was excellent.  I cut down on the oil just a bit....because I was running out.  Other than that, I didn't change anything.  It was delicious, pretty, and unusual.  The lemon gave it a lighter, fresher taste and feel.  Great recipes.  I'll be serving it on Christmas.

This salad dressing is fabulous.  My husband grilled chicken, Key West Chicken, a recipe from this site, and the salad complemented the chicken wonderfully.

The flavors of this salad work together so well! It holds well too (if you keep the dressing on the side), that is even if you have leftovers!

Oh my god I loved this salad, with a few changes from suggestions here. Made it for Christmas Eve dinner. Used a bit less sugar, canola oil, one head of boston and one head of red leaf lettuce, definitely skip the cheese, and use pecans!  Roasted pecans made the dish.

Quick, easy salad that everyone loved.  Since I had a lot of new recipes going at once I opted to buy pre-prepared poppyseed dressing, which worked fine. i will try the dressing portion of the recipe in the future.

I used a reduced fat dressing that was Onion and Poppy Seed. As for the actual salad it is a great combination of flavors.  Sometimes blue cheese but definitely not Swiss. Swiss did not sound good at all. Pistachios are also good but can be a little costly.

This salad dressing espcially was a HUGE favorite! The only change I made was I added about 2 tsp of honey to the dressing. It was so requested I bottled it up for co-workers as christmas gifts - thanks for this 5 star recipe!

We had a dinner guest who doesn't care for most salad but described a spinach salad with "some kind of fruit/sweet dressing" that he'd really enjoyed.  Hoping to recreate a good experience, I tried this one.  I can't say how delicious this is. I used it to dress a spinach salad with very thinly sliced onion and it was a huge hit.  I'm sure this is equally delicious on the salad listed.  I would say a good dressing for any salad with fruit added.

Great recipe and a real crowd pleaser!  Can vary if you want to get creative.  I have left out cranberries and used pear and apple slivers.  Also used mandarin oranges.  Cashews are good - so are toasted pine nuts. Can't go wrong!

We liked this a lot. I didn't have a pear, so we just used the apple. (I sized this down to 4 servings.) I didn't enjoy the Swiss in it. I think I'd have preferred almost any other flavor of cheese, and will probably try it with Cheddar at some point. The dressing is very good and we particularly enjoyed the flavor of the dressing on the raw apples--in fact I can see eating a bowl of apples with this dressing on it as a side dish sometime! By the way, this exact same recipe by the same author is on here twice...don't forget to go rate that one too!

The combination of ingredients in this salad is so yummy.  I just use Brianna's Poppyseed dressing though instead of making my own.  And I like to add grilled chicken that I've marinated in Soy Vay's Very Very Teriyaki overnight.

I made this salad as a side dish for my son's birthday party this weekend and it was a big hit.  I substituted bleu cheese for the swiss cheese and served it on the side.  It was so good I barely got any and had to tell my brother to step away from the salad so I could try some! (He had fixed himself a GIANT plate of it) Definitely a winner!

This is such a delicious salad.  I replaced the swiss cheese with feta because that's what I had and it was a hit!  I also used Splenda in the dressing, with half the oil and it turned out great.  Definitely a keeper.

I made this salad twice over the holidays.  The first time I made it I used two heads of romaine lettuce and made the dressing as directed.  The salad was swimming in the dressing!  The second time I also used two heads of romaine and cut the dressing in half and it was perfect.  I also decided to use craisins instead of regular dried cranberries and liked it very well.  A great tip I read from another reviewer was to store the chopped apple and pear in the dressing when transporting the salad so they don't turn brown - great idea!

Although I just use the salad dressing and use different salad ideas it is a great dressing... I usually add less sugar to the recipe just to my taste but other than that it is wonderful!

I have made this recipe several times for both church and family events and received rave reviews.  I usually exclude the nuts but that is just personal preference.  My favorite is using pear versus apple.

Great Salad - all the ladies at my luncheon asked for the recipe.  I did use butter lettuce along with the romaine and used craisins rather than the cranberries.  I peeled and diced my pears and apples the night before so just kept them in a seperate container with some of the dressing covering them they stayed nice and white.  I did not feel like getting the food processor out so just used my electric mixer and the dressing was delicious. I had considered doubling the dressing ingredients but I'm glad that I didn't as there was plenty of dressing.

The dressing was fabulous - the actual salad was just OK. I made 1/2 the amount of the dressing (and used about only half of that). I also only added aout 3 tbsp. of olive oil instead of what was called for. I added some fresh minced garlic and 2 tsp. finely chopped basil to the dressing. i refrigerated that for a couple of hours to all for the flavors to blend. I love the sweet and tangy taste of the dressing and prefer lemon juice to vinegar in dressings. As for the salad itself - I did not peel the fruit - as I wanted the peel to add color to the salad. I thinly sliced the fruit and let them sit in 2 tsp. lemon juice to make sure it would not brown/oxidize until I was ready to put the salad together. I left out the swiss cheese, but added a sliced red onion. I guess I did not like the pears and apples in my salad - I prefer vegetables in my salad. if I make it again - I will substitute red, and yellow peppers for the pears and apples. I would keep the craisins and toss in a can of drained manderine oranges - as I do not mind those in salads.

I tried this for the first time for a family gathering and got rave reviews. The only modification to the original recipe was to not peel the fruit and I mixed butter lettuce and romaine (the super easy already washed and in the bag kind). I didn't think there was way to much to much dressing unlike other reviewers but calories are a concern for us if it is a special occasion. There was 15 people and only half or a little over half was eaten but there was a lot of other side dishes. I'm sending on the recipe to a number of people that asked for it :)

We loved the salad itself, but we weren't thrilled with the salad dressing.  I did use splenda (half the amount called for) for the sugar and olive oil instead of veg. oil (yuk), but my husband described the taste as vinegary even though there wasn't a drop of vinegar in it.  I thought it was overly sweet mixed with all the wonderful fruit.  I will make again, but skip the dressing or tweak it to suit our tastes.  Thank you for sharing.

This was an absolutely delicious salad!! I didn't have cashews so I used toasted pecans and also used a good soft feta instead of the swiss.

This was delicious. I had walnuts so I roasted them and intended to use them with feta cheese...when I got the salad onto the table I completely forgot the feta! It was good but I can imagine the feta would have made it even better! The dressing was delish too...I think that my poppy seeds might have been on the old side:( (that explains my 4 star review) Will get some fresh ones and try again. Good for a change from the same old salads.

A reviewer said the dressing reminded them of lemon juice and they were right! After reading reviews I cut the sugar down to 1/3 cup and substituted blue cheese for swiss. My book club loved it.

Huge hit!  I used feta and toasted walnuts instead of swiss and cashews.  I'm curious about the flavors of swiss and cashews in salad, though, so will try them next time.

I made this salad for Christmas dinner and it was a huge hit with all of my guests...even the picky ones. I made it exactly as the recipe reads for the first time. Next time I may change the kind of cheese, or eliminate it all together. I used about half of the dressing and used the rest the next night when we made it again. Thanks.

I was nervous about serving this because there were so many flavors, but it was delicious! I got a lot of praise for the dish. I used mozzarella and almond slivers. Next time I might reduce the amount of sugar... it was a little sweet (but I will definitely make it again!

Very yummy!
I am currently trying to get my hubby to eat better, and slowly trying to introduce salads and such.  I tried this on him (minus the cranberries, he hates dried fruit) and he said it had enough stuff in it that it didn't feel like eating a salad.  He said he felt like he ate something of substance.

This got rave reviews from my Christmas dinner guests and several went home with the recipe. I used crumbled blue cheese instead of swiss to give it a bigger flavor punch. It reminded me of a salad they make at Panera Bread called "Orchard Harvest Salad."

This one is a winner! Prepared exactly according to the recipe, with one small exception. Used a bag of salad mix for speed. (Iceberg lettuce with carrots and red cabbage). The combination of sweet, salty, tangy from the meldiing of all the ingredients was wonderful! My husband said he didn't think he was going to like it, but now he can't wait for me to make it again. Thanks for sharing this wonderful combination!

I put in a fresh mango or two.  Also, I use whatever fresh fruit is available, strawberries, raspberries, or whatever.  Mozarella cheese works great, too.  The dressing really makes this salad; lemon is better than vinegar.

I made this exactly as listed with the exception of doubling for 25 people and subbing pecans for cashews (I hate cashews), and it was huge hit at my meeting.  In the interest of full discolure, I did have extra dressing, so I might ease off on that next time.  I gave it only four stars because it's not one that keeps well as leftovers and I hate to waste.

We loved this salad.  I served it with white cheese chicken lasagna from allrecipes some warm bread.  The dressing seemed like a lot, so I halved it and it was perfect for 6 people.  Next time I make this salad I am going to substitute the swiss cheese for feta cheese and mix in some spinach leaves with the romaine.  I can hardly wait to try this again.

I heard angels serenading me as I enjoyed this salad; definitely the best I've ever eaten.  I used a Honeycrisp apple and Seckel pears, dried cherries instead of cranberries and pecans rather than cashews.  Next time (and oh, will there be many next times) I will substitue bleu cheese for the Swiss.  I did make the mistake of tossing all of my salad with dressing, so the leftovers will be soggy and inedible by the time I want to enjoy them; lesson learned.  Thank you for sharing this incredible recipe!!

Awesome!  After reading some reviews, I decided to make this salad exactly as called for.  There are so many feta/apple salads out there...I love the concept of cashews and swiss cheese.  The dressing is refreshing (a bit like lemonade).  Thanks for a keeper!

Thank you for this delicious recipe!  I LOVE the dressing.  We can't eat dairy, eggs, or soy, so it's hard to find dressings we can eat.  I am thrilled to have this recipe.  What a great salad! Left off the cheese, absolutely didn't need it.  I'm trying to keep from eating the leftovers but I'm losing the battle...

This is a very tasty salad and it impressed everyone at Thanksgiving dinner.  I will definitely make this again.  Next time I will use much less cheese, if any at all.  I found the cheese kind of diminished the fresh and light texture of the rest of the salad.  Perhaps serving the cheese on the side is a better choice.

I loved this salad, perfect for holiday parties. I did use baby spinach instead of romaine, I think it made it a little fancier.

This salad is fabulous! I followed the recipe, only ommitting the cheese, and adding some fresh spinach and pecans instead of cashews. Everything else was the same and soooo good! I also used fresh lemons for the juice (3) and the dressing came out great. Very different from anything else I've ever made, everyone loved this!

This was the "highlight of the table" at our friend's Reformation party.  The only thing I did differently was to use walnuts and almonds instead of cashews as that was what I had on hand( I doubled the recipe and used walnuts on one salad and almonds on the other.)  I made the dressing as stated, usinig the bottled lemon juice since I had a lot on hand.  Will be making this again!

This salad is DELICIOUS - I actually really dislike swiss, so I almost decided not to make this salad, but it was so perfect with the pears. And the cashews really make this salad! LOVE IT!

The whole family really liked this salad.  I halved the recipe and followed the directions and it was perfect.  The combination of the cashews, swiss cheese, fruit and the dressing was delicious.  I did however only use half of the dressing so I'll be making this salad again this week to use the rest.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this to take to a dinner party, and it was a big hit.  I made exactly per directions, except substituted walnuts for the cashews.  I was a little scared about the dressing - I couldn't get it to thicken as much as I thought it should, but tasted great.

Made this for my dad's 50-something birthday with the whole family up to celebrate and it was a hit!  The salad dressing is unlike store brand poppyseed dressing with a lighter taste. We also used a spring greens mix instead. The combination of swiss, dried cranberries, cashews, apple and pear were delightful for these winter months.  Thanks for another great recipe!

This salad was excellent.  I took it to my in-laws for Christmas Eve.  We had about 14 people so I doubled the recipe (I'd rather have too much than not enough), regardless, it was completely gone by the end of dinner.  Will definitely be making this one again.

It was wonderful!!!  I used baby spinach mixed with romaine lettuce, because I love spinach with the sweeter dressings, and pomegranates instead of dried cranberries to make it extra fancy for Christmas, and it was great.  I added more apples and pear, and sugared almonds instead of cashews.  One of the best salads I have ever tried.  Thanks!

This was wonderful!  I did change a couple of things.  I used honey mustard dressing instead of the Dijon mustard, since that's what I had.  I also substituted pecans for the cashews and used cheddar cheese instead of swiss.  Also added a little extra onion, which helped to cut down on the sweetness.  But I'm sure it would be fabulous made as is.

Good solid salad that received compliments from others during Thanksgiving!  It was just a little sweet for my taste so I would add less splenda next time.  Even got enjoyed as leftovers for several days afterwards and was eaten up!

Great salad.  We eat salads every night and I am always looking for different variations.  The only changes I made were spicy brown mustard for dijon(not a fan) and I used Oraganic White Cheddar Cheese(thats what I had on hand). This will definately be in my rotation.

Excellent blend of sweet & savory and good crunch factor.  I have made several times and now like this best  with manchego cheese (small cubes) and chopped or slivered almonds.

The dressing for this salad was very similar to an older recipe that I had and lost. I took this salad to a church potluck, Made some changes I had no lemons, but used 3 Tbsp cider vinegar & used Splenda instead of sugar.  As recommended by many others I used a different kind ofr cheese (Edam, small cube) also drained mandarin oranges, left out the nuts, many with nut allergies.  This recipe made a lot of dressing, but it will not be wasted...will keep to liven up quick daily salads, Thanks for the great recipe*****Lots of

The dressing for this salad was very similar to an older recipe that I had and lost. I took this salad to a church potluck, Made some changes I had no lemons, but used 3 Tbsp cider vinegar & used Splenda instead of sugar.  As recommended by many others I used a different kind ofr cheese (Edam, small cube) also drained mandarin oranges, left out the nuts, many with nut allergies.  This recipe made a lot of dressing, but it will not be wasted...will keep to liven up quick daily salads, Thanks for the great recipe*****Lots of

This was such a beautiful and yummy holiday salad. Very festive looking and very very good. I, too, used the store bought dressing because I was too lazy to make my own. The flavors of the fruits, dried cranberries, cashews, etc blend in perfectly with the dressing. Thanks!

EDIT: I have made this salad many times over the years, and used the dressing from the recipe. The dressing is wonderful (I use about half as much sugar)!

I liked the salad.  The cashews blended nicely with the pear and apple taste.  I didn't care for the dressing though.  I think that store bought poppyseed dressing is a lot better.

I recently made this by substituting Splenda for the sugar and replaced the fruit with grilled chicken-- (lower carb meal). I also used roasted almonds instead of cashews. It tasted great.  I look forward to following the recipe exactly for the next picnic or potluck.

I am on my fourth time of making this since thanksgiving!!!!! Not to mention I have been asked for this recipe a dozen times over. Three new members to recipe.com because of this recipe. It was easy and fast to make ( minding that you make the dressing the day before). Truely a five gold star winner.

DEEEEEEELICIOUS!!!!!  This is the BEST salad that I've ever had.  It was easy to make and all the ingredients work so well together - from the dried fruit to the apples & pears along with the cheese & the nuts - there's just a little bit of everything and just the right amount of sweetness and flavor.  It's also such a beautiful dish to put out.  Everyone had seconds and all wanted the recipe.  

P.S.  I don't know what others were talking about when they said that the dressing didn't have much flavor.  It has lots of flavor and you can definitely taste the onion, lemon and mustard along with the sugar.

This was a huge hit at a family dinner. Even the salad dressing was getting rave reviews! Have extra copies of the recipe on hand because everyone will be asking for it. You must try this at least once and you will see how good it is!

Delicious.  The next time however, I will try to use less sugar.  I just started to limit sugar in my every diet and therefore, thought that it was a little too sweet.

This is one of the best salads I've ever made. I took it to dinner club and it was delicious. I don't want to lose track of this recipe. The dressing is what makes this good but it's a  perfect combination of all the ingredients.

I’ve never written a review before on any of the many dishes that I have made using this app but this is awesome. I didn’t have any Swiss cheese but my wife added mozzarella to hers and I took the advice of another review and added blue cheese. Both worked really well. Even the kids loved this! This is my new favorite salad.

It is always a requested salad with my family. I make the dressing ahead and put the apples and pears in the dressing to keep them from browning. When I put them on the salad I remove the apples and pears with a spoon that will drain the dressing. Then I pour the dressing on the salad. There is usually extra dressing. I could almost double the salad and do the single amount of dressing.

Very good, I did as some of the other reviews recommended and reduced sugar to 2Tbl.  Anxious to try salad with pecans.

Very refreshing and delicious.  I had dried sour cherries on hand, so used those instead of dried cranberries.  I also changed up the dressing a bit, using a couple of TBSP of honey instead of sugar, half lemon juice and half flavoured balsamic vinegar and omitting the mustard and onion.

Delicious! We served this with beef bourguignon and crusty bread for a casual Christmas night dinner with family. I followed LindaBTX's suggestions on reducing sugar and tossing the fruit in dressing ahead of time. Think I'll try candied pecans and blue cheese next time!

This is a great salad!  Love the crunchy texture of the romaine, apple and pear.  I left the peel on for colour.  The poppyseed dressing is delicious and could certainly be used with the fruity salads (e.g. spinach with berries).  I am making this salad for the second time today to take to a dinner party.  I'll have all the ingredients cut etc.and will put it together just before serving.  I'm sure it will be a big hit.

My favorite part of this was the cashews.  I used roasted and salted ones.  We threw in grilled chicken sliced super thin and made a meal out of this.  It was a hit at my house!

Really good!  I used equal parts fresh lemon juice, sugar and oil. I made half the recipe but used a whole honeycrisp and a whole red d’anjou. It was perfect. I used Gorgonzola crumbles for the cheese and think it adds a lot of flavor.

I made the recipe as printed, made the dressing the day before ,combined lettuce, cheese and cranberries.  Soaked the fruit in lemon water and kept the cashews out until ready to combine the ingredients the next day.  It turned out great!  Wonderful salad, crunchy, sweet and tangy all at once.  Will serve it again.

This is a wonderful salad. I have made it many times, with some changes. Today I used Havarti instead of Swiss cheese (I am not a fan of Swiss, husband is not a fan of Bleu cheese). The Havarti was wonderful! Also used cashews. Very yummy. I have to confess, I used Panera Poppyseed dressing instead of making my own. Still wonderful. Also, thank you to the person that suggested putting the cut up fruit in the dressing ahead of time! Not sure why I didn’t think of that before,  it it saved a lot of last minute hopping for me, and the fruit stayed nice and white, plus it added more flavor. Great tip

I used 1/2 the sugar, 1/2 cup lemon oil and 1 teaspoon lemon zest and diced sweet onion over a blend of butter , romaine and spring mix lettuce, D’Anjou pear and Honeycrisp apple.
Plenty for 6 generous servings.

I never submit reviews, but this salad is awesome!  I hate fruit salad, but this is on a whole new level of fruit salad.  I did switch out pecans for the almonds like some reviewers suggested, and had to switch to butter lettuce because romaine was taken off of the shelf due to people getting sick.  But other than that, I would not make ANY changes.  AWESOME FRUIT SALAD.  You will not be disappointed.

so delicious.  I used a granny smith apple but i have used a macintosh in the past and both are great in this salad.  Usually I keep the salad dressing the same as the recipe, which is delicious, but this time I switched maple syrup 1:1 for the sugar and added a cup of strawberries to blend in the blender for the dressing and it was splendid. Great salad as is, great with a few twists too!

Very good salad. My husband loved the dressing. Made if for thanksgiving this year. Only changes were to use iceberg because of the re-call on Romaine and walnuts because I forgot to buy the cashews.

I made this exactly as given. It was so good. I took it to a luncheon of my friends and they all loved it too. The really good thing about it was the dressing. I will always make it with fresh lemons because that makes it.

We did NOT change a single element in this delicious recipe.  Was a hit all around with layers of flavors that blended into a palate pleasing experience.  We always try the recipe “as is” first and we are so glad we did, would not change a single ingredient.  Great addition to any meal, lovely enough for a holiday side, perfect as an entree salad.

This turned out really well— I’m not a fan of pears, but in this salad, it works really well. INext time I won’t add so many craisins (the hubby felt they overwhelmed the dish, although I disagree), but otherwise

I really love all the components of this salad and they complemented each other nicely in the salad.   I did think that there was a lot of sweetness in the salad with the pear, apple, cranberries, and sweet lemon dressing.  I will make again, but, probably use feta or blue cheese instead of swiss and maybe almonds instead of cashews to offset the sweetness.

The recipe was a little different in the All Recipes magazine (which is what i followed) and it turned out great! 
I added blueberries and it was delicious.

This salad was delicious! I used a little less sugar than 1/2 cup and I used 1 1/2 Romaine hearts (and could have added more as there was plenty of dressing). I also substituted a second apple instead of the pear and used Craisins instead of cranberries because I didn't have the original ingredients. For my own salad, I add some steak and that was really delicious too!

This was so easy and yummy.  I prepped  a baggie of the cranberries and nuts. I subbed pecan pieces since I had them on hand.  Then, the next morning, I made the dressing and kept in a shaker.  A few hours before eating, I peeled and cored the apples (used two, since pears were not ripe enough) and dressed the salad. The apples really help up under the lemony dressing.  I also omitted the cheese to keep this lighter. I also required more than one head of romaine for the amount of dressing.I would make all types of versions of this salad again. It was a hit. Was even able to use leftover apple/nut/berry dressing parts with fresh romaine for lunches the next day.

The dressing especially turned out delicious! I used Snapdragon apples and Concorde pears for the fruit, and they complemented the salad wonderfully.

The only thing I did different was using an organic mix of greens and I bought lemon poppyseed dressing. It was really good and got rave reviews from my women's group. My husband loved the leftovers too!

I LOVE this recipe. I've been making it for years, it's always requested when I participate in a potluck. Sweet and a little tangy, it's a good dish for those who aren't huge salad fans, since this is a sweeter salad. I sub in Splenda or Stevia for the sugar to make it a bit healthier, no one ever notices :)

Made this salad for a birthday lunch today and I agree with other posters 1/2 cup sugar is too much.   I subbed almonds for cashews and still delicious.   Next time will def cut sugar by at least half.

A family pot-luck favorite.  Cut the fruit early and add the dried berries and fruit to the dressing to marinate for an hour or two prior to serving.  Also delicious with pecans and feta instead of cashews and swiss.

I made this as part of our Christmas dinner and was a huge hit!  I do have to admit to speed things up in my hectic cooking schedule I used pre-made poppy seed dressing and bagged already chopped romaine!  Used all the other ingredients though!  Thank you!

I cut the recipe in half, used a bag of romaine, 1 apple, 1 pear, 1/2 tsp of poppy seed (can't imagine it with the amount stated) and everything else as stated for half recipe - worked great for 4 people.

I made this salad as a part of the Christmas Day dinner we shared with my husband's father and brother. We loved it! 
The salad is very festive in appearance and tastes even better than it looks! I will definitely serve this again - it is a keeper!

Great salad.  I cut back on the sugar. Used only a 1/4 cup and the oil, just used 1/2 cup. The dressing was still tasty. Have made this salad a few times over the holiday season.

Substituted slivered almonds for cashew. Delicious and everyone loved.  Does not keep more than a day. Next time I will add dressing to individual servings instead of on entire bowl.

One of the best salads I've ever had or made. Nothing needs to be changed in this recipe. Great dressing. I couldn't find my dried cranberries, so I substituted some red grapes, which seemed just as good. Will definitely make this again.

I made this for Christmas dinner and it was a great hit and a nice change from the usual. I did reduce the sugar to a 1/4 cup and used spring mix greens and feta for the cheese. Other than that I followed the recipe. Delicious!

A simple, elegant salad that make a perfect complement to a range of both traditional and non-traditional holiday dinners.  The flavors of these seasonal fruits -- pears, apples, cranberries and citrus  --  with poppy seeds and lettuce not only play beautifully together, but make a festive presentation at Christmastime. I also like the idea of having the fruit and greens in together in one dish, making this salad equally useful as a companion side and a stand-alone side (to go with, say, lasagna or some other one-dish entree).  I have made this several times and will be making it again this year. I make the recipe as-is, usually minus the cheese, although it is excellent with Gorgonzola, which I think is an improvement over Swiss.

I made this for dinner tonight cause I had the pear and apple to use, and thought it came out very tasty. My husband doesn't care terribly much for sweeter dressings, so I had cut back on the sugar when I made the dressing, and he liked it okay, but still found it sweet. I also used chopped pecans I had on hand, and some diced cheddar cheese curd, cause we don't care for Swiss. It's a great recipe, but I'll probably only make it once or twice a year, or maybe when we have company, just cause my hubs is finicky.

Made several times. If you cut pear and apple ahead, coat with small at of dressing to prevent browning.   Also soaking dried berries in dressing helps distribute flavor.  I cut back sugar and oil as others indicated and serve dressing on side.  Dressing will keep in fridge.

I made this exactly as written.  I made the dressing one day in advance.  It was very easy to make and delicious!

I have had a recipe similar to this for years.  When I bring it to a party or make it for company, people always rave about it and ask for the recipe.  The only difference is in the dressing.  It has less lemon juice and uses red wine vinegar: 
½ c sugar
1/3c red wine vinegar
2 T lemon juice
2 T finely chopped onion
½ t salt
2/3 c vegetable oil
2-3 t poppy seed

Delicious and festive.  I made this for a holiday luncheon and there was not a bite left.  I followed the recipe with the exception of omitting the Swiss cheese.  I used a red onion and like the festive pink color that it gives the dressing.

I did not need to use all the dressing.  I made it for a potluck and there were no leftovers.  I like enough to make it on a regular basis for my work lunches.  The leftover dressing I have in a jar and am using it for my basic salads.

This is an exceptional recipe exactly the way its written.  I've made this several times already for holidays and dinner parties and have gotten rave reviews each time.  The chewy cranberries, crunchy apples and cashews, fresh taste of the pears all lend to the great taste.   And I love the Swiss cheese in this salad.  It's a good idea to keep the salad and the dressing separate since it will last much longer if you won't finish it the first time it's served.

I was assigned salad at our family Christmas gathering.  Everyone loved it. I cut the fruit, added the toppings and dresseed just prior to serving.  My mouth still waters thinking of this salad.

This is a great salad!  Have made it several times just as it is; but it is also very good with leaf lettuce as well as romaine, or have also made with a mix of greens.  Also use pecans or slivered almonds if no cashews on hand.  The dressing is so good and keeps well in the fridge.  Definitely a keeper!

Tasty salad. I didn't find the lemon flavor of the dressing as appealing as others, probably just personal preference. I may try it again with regular poppyseed dressing.

I only made the salad dressing and it was pretty good.  The only change I made was to reduce the oil to 1/4 cup (when I cut the recipe in half).  I also slightly reduced the amount of poppyseeds.

Fabulous and easy! I followed the recipe exactly, using fresh lemons and toasted pecans, as suggested in other reviews. I made the dressing a day in advance which helps bring out the full flavor. Definitely a success.

This  salad was wonderful!  I took a chance and made it for Christmas to go with lasagna.  I was hesitant to use Swiss cheese, but I bought a block and shredded it myself.  I used everything exactly as the recipe is written!  Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe.  I will definitely make this again!

I needed to make the salad for my culinary class and this recipe was perfect for the job; we were doing a mystery ingredients thing like on chopped or master chief. I didn't have all the ingredients so I had to substitute some things but in the in it came out great. 1) instead of poppy seeds I use roasted sunflower seeds, cashews into cornflakes(one of the mystery items we has to use), the berries into blackberries(same as the cornflakes), I needed to make the salad for my culinary class and this recipe was perfect for the job; we were doing a mystery ingredients thing like on chopped or master chief.

I added blackberries as a topping. It came out looking delicious, too bad I forgot to take a pic. 

I would definitely make this again, in fact I am, I'm making at home this weekend this time cause my mom wanted to try it.

1/2 cup of sugar is WAY too much- almost sickeningly sweet.  I remade the dressing with only 1 tablespoon of sugar, and thought it was much better!
I also use candied pecans instead of cashews, spring mix instead of romaine, and I leave the peel on the apple and pear.  It's delicious with or without cheese.
With those adjustments it is one of my family's favorite salads!  We make it every Christmas.
Next time I am going to try olive oil instead of vegetable oil.

Five stars for the vinaigrette alone. Big hit with my family. I poured several tablespoons over bagged salad with strawberries and cucumbers. No leftovers. Thanks for this recipe!

I loved this dressing.  I made it with slivered almonds and without the cheese.  Next time I will use pecans and add feta cheese.  Will make it again soon since I have so much dressing left over.

This was a big hit with my family at dinner tonight. I forgot to put the poppy seeds in the dressing but it wasn't missed. I will be making this again. I did as another person suggest  and put the apples and pears in the dressing to soak until dinner was ready. I then took tongs and put the apples and pears on the lettuce and served the dressing on the side. I also omitted the nuts because I didn't have any.  I will be making this again.

Love this recipe.  I used it at a church Christmas dinner in 2014, serving 250.  I had such a positive response that I used it at my son's wedding (150 served) summer 2015.  Made the dressing a couple of days ahead filling 5 mason jars. Only change was using almonds for the nut portion.

Despite putting all the ingredients together, instead of adding the oil gradually at the end (as suggested), this dressing was delicious using fresh ingredients! I'm looking forward to making the salad based on the positive reviews!! Two thumbs up :)

The recipe had lots of great suggestions. I used what I had, following the basic outline of greens,cheese, fruit, dried fruit, and nuts. I had green onion, avocado and a tomato that needed to be used so i tossed them in as well. Hard to go wrong really. The dressing makes it, I used half the sugar and it was still great.

I have made this recipe for at least the last 10 years for every special family dinner or BBQ. My male dominated family were strictly 'meat and potato' men until I introduced them to this salad. They never leave left-overs! I often change the type of cheese or nuts - they still love it.

We prefer pecans in keeping with the winter theme. Otherwise, this recipe is perfect as it is. A big hit for the Thanksgiving and Christmas tables.

Lots of compliments!  Quick and easy to make.  I used my favorite poppy seed dressing (store bought) and tossed the pear and apple in lemon juice.  It was perfect.  Will make again!

This was delicious and it would be easy to substitute fruits or cheeses in a pinch. (ie almonds vs cashews)  I did decrease the sugar as recommended- it was wonderful and I'm going serve at Christmas dinner!

RUN, don't walk, to the nearest grocery store and buy the ingredients for this salad....it is FABulous!!!  I made it exactly as written and served it to my bridge group  yesterday.....everyone asked me for the recipe.  Truly delicious.  I will definitely make this again!  I may try reducing the sugar slightly and adding more cranberries next time, but that's just personal preference.  Great recipe...thanks so much for sharing it!

I made this for Thanksgiving to take to a family dinner.  It was great.  I decreased the sugar by 2 Tbsp. like one person said.  Omitted the onion, poppy seeds and Swiss cheese.  Left the skins on the apple and pear and everyone loved it.  I will definitely make it again.

I made this salad with three changes.  First, I substituted carmalized pecans, coarsest chopped, for the cashews,  Second,  my apple of choice was Honey Crisp, unpeeled and  the pear variety was Bosc, unpeeled.  By leaving the skins on,the salad appeared more vibrant and hence more pleasing to the eye,  Third, in addition to the Romaine, I added green leaf lettuce because I wanted more variety to the lettuce base. Red leaf lettuce would have added more color, but lacks the crispy texture of the leafy green lettuce.

Absolutely delicious. The only change I made was to use feta cheese as I did not have the swiss cheese. Thanks for the yummy recipe.

Wow!  First of all the dressing is fabulous.  I used 1/2 olive oil and 1/2 canola oil.  I didn't have any cranberries so I substituted dried tart cherries.  I also topped it with some croutons and crumbled bacon. I also used canned pears.  This is definitely a keeper.  Thanks.

Very good!  Made this several times and it was a big hit.  Added some mixed baby greens to the romane lettuce. Agree with some others if you cut the apples and pears before, except if you use asian pears, toss with some of the dressing so they will not turn.  Definately will make again!  Thank you for the recipe.

I've been making this recipe for years perfect for Thanksgiving because dressing and fruit can be prepared early in morning and doesn't take frig space; only difference in my recipe and this one I use two pears and two granny smith apples with skin on. Make dressing first. Then cut fruit and place in large salad bowl. I just pour all the dressing over fruit in morning and place Press & Seal over fruit to stop it from browning. Wash & Dry Romaine crisp in Frig. Measure out 1/2 cup whole cashews and 1/2 cup cranraisins seal in baggies. When ready to serve. I tear up lettuce into bite sized pieces toss with fruit/dressing mixture. Sprinkle cashews & cranraisins toss. Then top with finely shredded swiss cheese (much like Parmesan a Caesar Salad)

The salad was delicious.  I followed some of the suggestions below by cutting the sugar and oil in half for the dressing and subbed Bibb and red leaf lettuce for the romaine.  Also used a red and yellow apple instead of a pear.  Finally, I made it without any cheese or nuts for a lighter salad before Thanksgiving dinner.  Everyone loved it.

I made this salad a couple of nights ago when we had company and it was excellent.  Everyone loved the dressing and the combination of fruits and the cashews was a good mix.  I will definitely make this salad again.  Loved it!!!

I actually just cut the bottoms off of two hearts of romaine and split them over two plates, then drizzled the dressing over both and topped with the fruit, cheese, and cashews.  The result was a fantastic, light, healthy meal!

We substituted the Cashews for Sunflower seeds, i'd suggest if you do that to put in a little less. My husband was IN LOVE with this salad. The portions for the Apple and pear were perfect, I thought it wouldn't be enough but it turned out great!

Fabulous! I almost added a second apple, but I didn't because the one was plenty and two would have been way too much. The dressing is wonderful - a pleasing combination of sweet and tart.

Great Salad! My husband loved it.  I followed the recipe except I only used enough of the dressing to coat everything, also I only had cheddar cheese on hand so I used that instead of swiss.

Outstanding, though I cut back on the sugar for the dressing. Nice salt of cashews and swiss cut the sweetness.

This was yummo!  I did add 2 heads or romaine lettuce and there was still a lot of dressing left.  Great combo of sweet and tangy!

I love this recipe. The only thing that I do different is using less oil. I use only half of the recommended amount. Otherwise is perfect.

My husband and I just scarfed it down, it was THAT good!  I halved the recipe to make 2 salads. I omitted the cheese and  substituted almonds on one salad and pecan halves on the other instead of cashews.  The dressing is so good that I was tempted to lick my plate after I was finished.

This was really delicious.  I gave 4 star because although it was very good nothing compares to the strawberry spinach salad on this site.  Had I tasted this one first I probably would give 5 stars.  But I will probably make again someday.  thanks

I have made this salad a number of times but never got around to reviewing it.  I have served this at large gatherings (over 100 people) and at holiday dinners with my family and it is always delicious and everyone loves it and wants the recipe.  The salad dressing is the best poppyseed dressing ever and can be used on lots of different types of salads.

This salad is delicious!  I followed the directions for the dressing, but changed a couple things in the salad itself.  I left out the cheese and used walnuts instead of cashews (that's what I had on hand).  Everyone I've made it for loves it!

This is a great summer salad too!  The dressing is so refreshing!  I used granny smith apples and omitted the pears (didn't have pears on hand). We served it with BBQ pork chops and baked potatoes. Perfect!

This rating is for the dressing - superb.  I used it in a chicken salad with strawberries, honeydew, and pecans.  My husband said it was the best he ever had.

I did enjoy this recipe but I did make a few changes such as I used strawberries and mandarin oranges although I think you can just use whatever fruit is in season and it would be great!  I also used feta cheese shredded as I could not find swiss shredded but next time I may try swiss.  I also used mixed baby greens and the mistake I made was mixing up the salad minus the dressing and drove it to a BBQ about 1/2 hr away and then it sat for another 1/2 hr before we ate and it had wilted a lot.  I did dress it then but only half of the dressing as it makes sooo much!  I am not sure if I like the lemony flavour or not I used bottled lemon juice so I may cut back next time.  I also may use romaine next time as well but Caesar salad was also being served so I wanted to be different.  Overall the mixture of flavours and textures was very yummy therefor 4 1/2 stars!

This salad is delicious and the flavors of the fruit, cheese, and nuts combine beautifully.  I added shredded chicken to make it a main dish rather than just a side dish.  This salad looks very elegant as well and this is something I would serve for a dinner gathering or to bring to a summer picnic.  However, I would add the cheese just before serving, as I think it would get too soggy if it sat in the salad for too long.

Loved it!! I FELT I NEEDED TO UPDATE THIS REVIEW.  I MAKE THIS DRESSING EVERY TWO WEEKS - EACH TIME I MAKE 4X'S THE RECIPE - THATS HOW MUCH WE LOVE IT!! FYI - INSTEAD OF POURING THE OIL IN SO SLOWLY HOPING IT WILL THICKEN ENOUGH TO NOT HAVE TO STIR UP THE POPPY SEEDS EACH TIME - ONCE YOU HAVE BLENDED IT - BLEND IT FOR 5 MINUTES WITHOUT THE POPPY SEEDS. IT STAYS BLENDED AND YOU HARDLY HAVE TO STIR IT.....ALSO - DO NOT USE "RED ONIONS" OR YOU WILL HAVE "PINK" DRESSING,,  :(

We really liked this.  Not my favorite, but I'll probably make it again.  I pretty much followed the recipe, but I left out the minced onion (preference) and didn't use the whole dressing amount.

Super yummy and enough dressing for double the salad.  I also cut the sugar in half and used pecans instead.  Oh, I think the salad would taste better without the swiss cheese or use parmesan cheese instead.  But dressing is very good!

Super yummy and enough dressing for double the salad.  I also cut the sugar in half and used pecans instead.  Oh, I think the salad would taste better without the swiss cheese or use parmesan cheese instead.  But dressing is very good!

This is an excellent salad and dressing.  It has been a hit with everyone I've prepared it for.  A friend served it for my husband and me and I had to have the recipe.  She turned my on to allrecipes.com and I'm never at a loss for something to cook.

The use of lemon (overall alkalizing)rather than vinegar is a nice change with the same results, balancing the acid of the sugar just so. We like it enough that I have a carafe of dressing on hand, a bowl of chopped fruits tossed with a bit of dressing to prevent oxidation, and greens with other ingredients in separate bowl. It can last up to 2 days without noticeable deterioration. Thank you for sharing.

I followed the recipe exactly as written and it was very good, but I think it could be made better with the addition of some tangy red or green onion. The dressing made much more than we needed, so I'm making the salad again tonight!

Pretty to look at, and easy to prepare. The dressing is too sweet for our tastes, though. I will try it again with less sugar. Thanks for the recipe!

This salad was just OK - I didn't like the way the dressing tasted at all - much too sweet.  I used a poppyseed dressing from Trader Joe's that was great.  Also didn't think the Swiss cheese added much flavor.

What a great salad! I chopped up chicken to serve it as a main dish. Really tasty. I might try feta cheese next time instead of swiss. You can't really taste the swiss cheese.

This is one of the best salads I have ever had.  Made it for Christams and again for New Years Eve.  Doubled the dressing to have more for second salad.

This was a hit at my photography clubs Christmas potluck.  Since this was my first attempt, I didn't make any changes to the recipe.  I prepared the dressing the night before and was a little concerned that the dressing would be too sweet; however the flavors blended beautifully overnight.  I will make this again!

Every time I make this salad, everyone loves it!  The first few times I made it as directed, but the last few times I have candied the cashews with brown sugar and just used apples because I had no pears.  Just a note:  The dressing is enough for several salads, so save what's left in a jar because, believe me, you will want to make this again!

OMG!  This is the BEST salad!  The only thing I did different was to add some walnuts and dried cranberries.  The dressing is extremely refreshing and delicious!  You can't go wrong with this recipe!

Delicious!  I too used less sugar and substituted the swiss for feta.  Next time I will cut the cashews to a heaping half cup instead of a full cup.

I made this salad over the holidays, and everyone loved it.  The dressing is wonderful, though it took me a couple tries to get it right.

This recipe is a "find". Simple, yet fun and delicious. The dressing is perfect; we now use it for everyday. I served it for the first time at a party, and not only did people comment on it, they ate it!

Very good salad that is colourful and tasty. I'm not sure the cranberries add a lot to it, so I may leave them out next time and try it with shredded sharp cheddar instead of the Swiss cheese. Thanks for the recipe.

So delicious!  Everyone at our New Year's Eve dinner loved this salad -- especially the dressing.
I made the following changes:
-only apples, no pears
-dried cherries instead of cranberries
-pecans instead of cashews
-feta instead of Swiss
We'll definitely enjoy this at many meals to come!

I made this for Christmas Dinner and it was a huge hit!  I was skeptical and feeling crazy for serving it the first time making it to a crowd of people-----but it turned out great and everyone raved about how good it was.  Even my very picky salad hater husband liked it.  I accidentally left out the cheese and used pecans instead of cashews.  My favortie find on All Recipes!!!!!

This recipe is awesome, I loved it :) I have made it twice, the first time I used real lemons in the dressing and the second I time I was out of lemons and had to use concentrated juice from the plastic lemon. Real lemons make a big difference along with leaving the dressing in the fridge to thicken for a couple hours before serving.

I made this salad for a Sunday School Christmas party.  Very tasty!  I used bottled Poppyseed dressing, and just added whatever amount of ingredients I thought my head of lettuce needed...no measuring!  I also used pecans instead of cashews because that's what I had on hand.

I had a hard time deciding how to rate this recipe. My kids did not care for it. But then kids are kids and to tell you the truth, I LOVED it.  I will only make again for a large group.  I did make a small change.  I did not pour all the dressing over the salad just enough to taste and keep the apples from turning brown, I put the rest of the dressing on the side to add if desired.

Excellent excellent recipe!  Whole family loved it and even when they were already full, they couldn't stop picking at it!  Even the bf who hates vegetables ate a big plateful of it, saying, "it doesn't taste like salad so I like it!".  Great balance of sugar and lemon juice.  Definitely a keeper, definitely will be serving again.  I would probably add another 1/2 cup of cashews and toast them as well to make the taste a little more robust.  I would also up the number of pears to 2 and the cheese isn't needed.  In fact, I think the addition of the cheese really takes away from its "refreshing" character.

I was looking for a good recipe for Thanksgiving.  Well, I found this recipe and everyone loved it.  They asked me to bring it to a family dinner this next week. 
The only change I made was to omit the almonds.  It was still delicious.
  I wonder if I could make the dressing w/ Splenda?

Yummy and perfect for the holidays.  The recipes made a lot of dressing is the only thing I could say - but I saved it for another day.

Excellent salad.  Tastes like my favorite resturant salad! Husband asked for seconds!  I did make a change. I used some blue cheese crumbles instead of swiss.  We just like the blue cheese in fruited salads.  The dressing is awesome!  Thanks for the great salad!

I made this for a dinner party and it was a hit. It even impressed a chef! The dressing was so flavorful and simple to make. The only thing i did differently was add a clove of garlic since I love garlic.

Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for Thanksgiving too and everyone loved it !
After reading all the good reviews I doubled my recipe. Thank goodness I did because we used all of it. 
The dressing is very light in flavor so it also goes well on top of fresh cut up fruit salad. YUM !
I'd probably use a bit more onion next time for a more flavoraful salad.
By the way, I used sliced thin Gouda cheese instead of shredded swiss cheese to dress it up and added scallions to my salad.
FANTASTIC !

Great dressing!  And I love the idea of mixing crunchy fruit into a lettuce salad.  Next time I make this I think I will add Asiago or Parmesan cheese to the mix instead of Swiss as I would have liked a stronger flavor of cheese.

This is so yummy & easy...everyone was asking me for the recipe for the dressing.  I changed up the salad a little to accomodate what was on hand.  Used the suggestion of raisins soaked in orange juice since I didn't have any pears (very good).  Also used candied pecans instead of cashews.  Will definately make again!  Thanks.

I was just looking for a way to use some fresh pears and stumbled on this recipe.  My whole family was licking the bowl!!!  Absolutely divine dressing paired with sweet, crunchy, tart, and salty.  I could find no fault with this recipe except that it runs out too soon!!!

Love these flavors together!  I would never have thought to add swiss cheese, but it blends in nicely.  I used a store-bought organge poppyseed dressing to save time and cleanup, but I'm sure it would be just as good with the homemade dressing.  This will definitely go in the fall salad rotation.

By far one of my all time favorite recipes, I've never heard one bad word about this salad & I've srved it many times, even those who generally don't care for fruit in their salads fell in love.

I can't say enough great things about this salad!

Delicious and unique salad.  Freshly squeezed lemon juice made the dressing wonderful, but I only pured about 2/3 of it on the salad and it was plenty.  Served this with Christmas dinner and everyone loved it!

This was excellent and (served on Christmas) was really eaten instead of left behind in favor of all the other goodies on the table. I decided to make this because last week I was at a very fancy and expensive restaurant that used dried cranberries in their salad. I had never had that before and it's delicious! I used fresh lemons for the dressing. For an every-day occasion, I may use bottled poppy-seed dressing to speed things up.

This was excellent and (served on Christmas) was really eaten instead of left behind in favor of all the other goodies on the table. I decided to make this because last week I was at a very fancy and expensive restaurant that used dried cranberries in their salad. I had never had that before and it's delicious! I used fresh lemons for the dressing. For an every-day occasion, I may use bottled poppy-seed dressing to speed things up.

I made this as a "trial run" before Christmas.  It was delicious!  I didn't have to use all the dressing, so maybe I'll cut it in half for the big day.  Too much would be overpowering.  This is a very nice and diiferent side to a holiday dinner.

I made this for Thanksgiving this year and my family asked me to make it again for Christmas!  Beautiful AND tasty.  I substituted 1T dried minced onion in a pinch and dressing still turned out great!

Great salad. I only use about 1/4 of the dressing on the salad, and save the rest for another time.  Also, I only use 1/3 cup oil, rather than 2/3 cup.  I used fresh lemon, just a shake of salt, and dried onion flakes.

Absolutely fantastic.  I made this for a dinner party and it was pretty much wiped clean.  I only used 75% of the oil the dressing called for.

I made this salad for Christmas dinner and recieved rave reviews from everyone and many requests for the recipe.  I used royal riveria pear and granny smith apple, which I dipped into a lemon water solution to keep from browning.  I also used a blend of shredded Italian cheeses rather than all swiss.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This recipe was a hit at Thanksgiving.. I was looking for something "less traditional" and everyone loved it.  The dressing perfectly complemented the ingredients...

This salad is wonderful.  I have made it numberous times -- always a big hit.  I've used fresh grated parmesan cheese instead of Swiss.  Only because I had it on hand the first time -- and it was so good I've continued to use it.  I've made this salad without apples and pears and it was still great.

This salad is AMAZING!  I prepared the dressing earlier in the day and stored it in a glass jar in the fridge.  I poured it on just before serving.  Also, I used more dried cranberries than called for (more like a cup) because they add such a nice color and great taste.  I served it yesterday with Easter dinner.  It's a keeper!!

Great twist on the ordinary salad. The dressing is the key -- I have been using it all week and experimenting. It works well on stronger flavored greens such as arugula and was also delicious over a salad topped with grapes and grilled chicken.

I made this for our pot-luck Christmas dinner. Everyone raved about it. I'll definitely make it again. I substituted mozzarella for Swiss, and omitted the nuts - I don't like nuts in a salad.

Very good - didn't use all of the dressing.  Used only pears (didn't have any apples at the time) & I substituted mozzarella for swiss.  I will make this again.

I have traditionally made a broccoli coleslaw recipe with ramen noodles for thanksgiving each year with rave reviews. Although it was requested again this year I was tired of it and decided to make this one instead - but still use the broccoli slaw instead of the lettuce. When I asked if they liked it better than the other stuff they told me not to bother with the old recipe anymore - this one was a hundred times better! I haven't tried it with lettuce yet, but the broccoli slaw allowed everything to mix together really consistently and the blending of flavors was great!

I have been eyeing this recipe for a long time and finally made it to take to Mother in Laws house on Thanksgiving. It got passed over, but I'm not sure if it's because it wasn't liked or because my family is into "traditional" salads and were NOT branching out on that day! It's a colorful easy salad to make and has a pretty presentation. The dressing was also very easy and I felt it had a honey mustard flavor to it, I really couldn't taste the lemon. Not a bad salad, just not a show stopper.

This was okay, but I can't say I was particularly impressed.  I brought this to a family Thanksgiving meal, and everyone who tried it said they liked it.  The cranberries are a nice touch, but I thought the dressing seemed a bit heavy even though I only used half the amount.  If I make this again I will probably cut back on the amount of oil.

This salad is YUMMY !  The dressing is the best part.  It is super easy to make.  You don't have to put ALL of the dressing on.......it's a little too much.  I bought a romaine lettuce in a bag which made it even easier.  I highly recommend this recipe!

I made this for Thanksgiving along with 5 other highly rated recipes.  This not only was the BEST out of the 6, but it deserves a 10 STAR rating!!!  Personally, I'm not much of a salad person, but when I tried this I was very surprised!  It was fabulous!!!  Thanks so much!!!

Excellent salad!  I was skeptical about the swiss cheese, but it ended up being perfect.  Dressing definitely goes a long way...could probably cut in half.  I plan on making this salad to take to my mother-in-laws for Thanksgiving.  Will try toasting the cashews next time, otherwise perfect the way it is.

While I did enjoy the salad, the part that shined in this recipe was the salad dressing.  I keep getting asked for the dressing recipe!  It was super yummy, and while I might try the salad part of the recipe again, the dressing has become a staple in my home.  Yum scrum!

This is trully the best salad I've ever made.  It is constantly the center of conversation whenever I make it, and I have since been asked to prepare it for a 200-person celebration.  It is a recipe I've given out more frequently than any other.  Thank you Nora LaCroix for giving us this incredible salad!

This was EXCELLENT!  What a wonderful combination of flavors!  I first served this with our Christmas dinner and it was much prefered to the traditional garden salad by everyone.  It may be called Winter Fruit Salad but I can easily live on this all year! The only change I may make is to use a bottled dressing, but just to save time. Thanks Nora!

I almost found the reviews too good to be true but I tried the recipe anyway.  Everyone was right.  I served this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it and had to have the recipe.  Thanks very much for a light and refreshingly different salad.
