Great! The one thing I would change next time is the bell pepper. You have the orangish broth, red tomatoes, and yellow corn. It needs green. Next time I'd sub a green bell or even a jalapeno for the yellow bell. Overall great recipe though and no need to get hung up on the color of the bell. Use which one you like or have in the fridge.
