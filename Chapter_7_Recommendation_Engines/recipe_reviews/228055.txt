Very good. The fish was moist and tender and cooking the ginger mellowed it out nicely.

My mother in law is from the Philippines and loved this. Took it to a game of Mahjong and friends loved it. Requested it again for the next game. The pic is from the second batch. Used whole cut pieces of fish. Otherwise didnt change a thing.

Quite a tasty dish!
We toned down the ginger for our North American palates, so used only about 1/3 of what they ask. My wife lived in Cambodia for a few years and could take lots of ginger then, but she was happy to tone it down too, since she isn't used to so much any more.
I found that I ate a lot more rice with it than I would with other fish dishes, as the dish is quite potent. My wife said that is also typical of how Cambodians eat, very small portions of (extremely flavourful) meat and a LOT of rice with it.

This was a great recipe, restaurant quality my wife and I thought. I was a little nervous with the fish and oyster sauce as I am not familiar with the use of these, but the flavor blended nicely with the large amount of garlic. I didnâ€™t have red bell pepper so I add a small amount of canned diced tomatoes, mostly for color, but I thought it worked well with the recipe. This is a top of the list recipe for us now.

Love the taste. It came out perfect. I reduced amount of fresh ginger as one of the reviewers suggested. Definitely will make it again.

I really liked it, but my kids did not like it at all. Didn't have oyster sauce so used an extra tablespoon of soy sauce. Didn't make much sauce but enough.

I added maybe 3 teaspoons sugar, a teaspoon of liquid smoke and less ginger but alot of ginger powder with a dash of red chili pepper and it came out superb. Great dish!

I just made this recipe. It turned out very well, loved it. however I don't care for yellow onions so I simply added a few extra green onions.
