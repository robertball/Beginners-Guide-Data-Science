Wow wow wow! So flavorful!  Made it tonight and it is a new favorite.  Only difference for me was that I did not have a dutch oven, so I used my crockpot.  After I finished the step of caramelizing the onions and adding the peppers, I poured that into the bottom of the crockpot, placed the browned chicken thighs on that, and then added the stock, artichoke, olives and sausage stuffed peppers.  Took about 2 and a half hours on high; would probably take at least 5 on low.  Thanks again Chef John!

My 1st Mediterranean dish and I loved it. I think this dish is so versatile that you can use maybe cabbage instead of artichokes,  fresh green or red peppers chopped,  and 1/2 pound of Italian sausage rolled into small meatballs. I will make again and again. TY

I just asked my husband what I should write as the review for this recipe.  He said, "Uhhh... YUM!  The end." hahahaha!  It was delicious.  We followed the directions exactly as written, used the ingredients exactly as written, and it was fantastic.  We will definitely make this again!

Whee doggies!  The chef wasn't kidding when he said this was an intense food experience and wasn't for bland palates. I LOVED it! My eyeballs are still sweating, but as my husband, Mr. Meat and Potatoes, put it, "There is a whole lot going on here and I'm getting tingly in the back of my head."  We are trying to eat healthier, so did not have a huge hunk of Italian bread to sop up all the wonderful broth, but we made do with straight up slurping it out of the bowl.

Just wanted to say this was really a gratifying meal.  I also want to say that I appreciate Chef John, greatly. He's one of the most understandable, easy to follow, cooking instructors I've watched. I always get a laugh out of his little musings while he cooks. Great job.

All I can say is WOW! Lots of flavor, full of body and substance. While the dish was cooking, my kids gathered in the kitchen to see where the amazing smell was coming from. I did not use any additional heat other than the cherry peppers and substituted with turkey sausage and fat free broth. Everyone at the table had seconds and thirds. Absolutely a keeper!

This was an interesting dish. A caveat to start with:  the label on my cherry peppers indicated there were approximately 21 peppers in the jar, but there were only 14.  That worked out for me b/c my bag of chicken only had 5 thighs.  I am not a huge fan of sausage in general, but this recipe was so intriguing, I had to make it anyway!  The chicken was not dry at all.  The flavors were great at injecting some variety into the normal routine. My SO love love loved it, so I will be making it again!

I am trying to eat healthier without sacrificing flavor and taste. THIS was the way to go! Spicy, flavorful, delicious. Next time I will trim the fat from the thighs a bit and only quarter the artichokes, I cut them way too small. Same with the olives, I used sliced when I should have used whole (I just wasn't paying attention). I seemed to end up with a lot of (yummy) juice and didn't plan for a side dish to soak it up or maybe some nice Artisan bread. Incredible dish, I will be making again and often. Chicken fell off the bone! Thank you, Chef John!

We loved this. A lot of flavor, perhaps too much for some days.  I scaled this down for two, used hot sausage, and kept in the whole can of artichokes since I wasn't making anything else with this. The only change I made was to use boneless/skinless chicken breast and Italian seasoning since I didn't have the herbs de provence. Unfortunately, I also forgot to use the fresh herbs that I had gathered. One pot, start to finish, was a definite bonus. The chicken was very tender and moist and the peppers would make a great appetizer on their own.

Followed the recipe to the tee. It was outstanding. I made long grain brown rice as a side dish for the juice. It was proved excellent as well.

This dish is fabulous, impressive and even won over my mom that says she doesn't like the thigh.  I used sweet Italian sausage and skipped the Marjoram (didn't have it, didn't miss it).  A wonderful and impressive dish.

This is just so very tasty!  Delicious!  This is definitely a keeper.  The only thing that I did different (sorry, those of you who want a totally perfect representation) was to use an Al Fresco sausage to stuff in the peppers.  I also couldn't find fresh oregano or margoram--just basil.  Thanks for another winner, Chef!

The only thing I changed was that I used red roasted peppers (yes, they were huge) because I could not find cherry peppers. It was still very delicious, and like other reviewers said, the flavor popped. I also agree that rice or something to soak up the extra sauce would be good.

This is quite possibly the best new recipe I have tried in over a year.  It takes some time to prepare so I would definitely put this on a weekend menu.  I followed the recipe exactly. I did not substitute anything. The only thing I could not find at the store was herbs de provence. A quick Google search left me with (marjoram, oregano, fennel, rosemary, thyme, and basil mix). So, I bought all of these herbs fresh (except fennel) and chopped even amounts until I got about 1/3 cup. My husband and two kids absolutely loved this. As I frequently torture them with new recipes, some hits, some misses, they proudly proclaimed this one a supreme winner!

"Big Boom in my mouth.  Very good!" - This is a direct quote from my Dad.  He even ate the leftovers the next day.  Two thumbs up from the entire family.  Only changes I made was to use italian flavored chicken sausage and only 1/4 of the pepperoncini liquid (may increase to 1/3 next time).  I only had marinated artichokes so I rinsed them well before adding them.  Even the ones who say they don't care for olives or spicy foods raved about this dish.  Thanks Chef John!

Oops missed the addition of the stock but this really turned out great anyway. Not sure if I'll add the stock in the future. Well this is spicy! But we loved it! Looks beautiful and tastes scrumptious. Could not find Peppadews so used another pickled hot pepper. They were larger and I didn't have as many as the recipe called for but it worked.

Wow!  I did make a few changes only because I wanted to use up what I had on hand. I used jumbo green olives quartered instead of black - I think they actually were better - and I used Italian blend spices instead of herbs de Provence.  I had a jar of the large pickled red peppers so I just put the sausage on them and laid on top. My husband said it was so good I should have taken a picture to remind me to make it again.  If I had to go out and buy all the ingredients it would be costly for one dish, but still worth it.  It's that good - I would give it 10 stars!

I thought this was FANTASTIC!!  I followed the directions pretty close except using less olives and pepperoncini (I'm the only one who likes them) and this was spot on on flavor, no salt needed, perfect!  Also I used boneless, skinless thighs and it worked out just fine.  For anyone who does not like kalamata olives, the flavor really does get more subtle with the cooking.  I didn't find them as overpowering as they usually can be.  Yummy dish!

I work on a riverboat and made this for a crew of 9 men(all from various areas and with different likes and dislikes when it comes to food).  This was a big hit !  I added 2 extra thighs and there was NONE left.  I served it with risotto, and green salad with a chunky tzatziki dressing . Delicious, we will be having this dish again. Thanks Chef John.

My kids and husband liked this very much. Because I didn't have a lot of prep time t substituted the the bone in chicken for boneless and cooked EVERYTHING in the skillet and served it over rice pilaf. Once the chicken was cooked I pulled the chicken apart with a fork so it was more shredded.  Cooked the sausage in another pan first and drained the fat and added that to the chicken with the rest of the ingredients.  With the leftovers I am thinking of putting it in a wrap and even adding some feta cheese.  I think that would make a good lunch.

Wow! This was pretty amazing. I didn't have the cherry peppers so just out the ground sausage crumbled on top. Also no herbes de Provence so substituted main herbs. Looks like a time intensive dish but it's really not. Flavor is amazing. As others have said, lots going on. I will serve this for guests! Awesome!

This recipe is wonderful!  I used pheasant instead of chicken thighs and everyone raved about it.  I added some sauteed kale and carrots as we like lots of veggies and added an extra cup of stock.  The prep time is more than 35 minutes, but it's definitely worth it. It's great for entertaining as you can double or triple the recipe. All you'll have to do when your guests arrive is slice the bread and enjoy the good food and company!

Love this dish!  I dialed down the spice with a little less black pepper, half the red pepper flakes, and mild Italian sausage due to some sensitivities of family members.  Still and loads of flavor and looks so pleasing long before the first bite.  It worked well with a quinoa and brown rice base and a simple cucumber salad.

This was amazing!  Unfortunately my guests had issues with spicy food, but my husband and I loved it.  A few days later I calmed the spice down by adding multigrain rice and topped it with plain yogurt.  It was a hit!  I would definitely make this again by adding the rice and yogurt.

Oh my. I didn't expect this dish to be as good as it was. Perfect amount of spice, great flavor, and tender chicken. I had to get creative since I didn't have a dutch oven, but was easily solved for.

That was absolutely delicious! Thank you. My only complaint is that my Dutch oven isn't twice as big! I would have otherwise doubled the recipe. It went fast.

Loved this recipe! I used chicken breast, boneless and skinless,  and Italian chicken sausage to make it healthier. Everything else was the same. I will be making it again.

Amazing flavors!
Very good!. I browned smoked sausage links cut up with the chicken and then added the cherry peppers when I added the Italian peppers and used 1 tsp black pepper instead of a tablespoon.  Everything else was as the recipe said. I made red potatoes to put it on top of. Delicious! Will definitely be making this again. Thank you Chef John!

Wow.  Who wouldn't like this.  Made it per the recipe.  The jar of cherry pepper that I used only had 13 peppers in it.  Thought the would be close enough.  Next time I will use two jars.  The one jar took no where near the six  ounces of  sausage to stuff.  Served this with some rice cooked in chicken stock for a family celebration.  It  fit the bill.  This will be our special meal for the foreseeable future.

This was the BEST chicken that I ever ate! I don't ever dream about food but I dreamt about this and I'm salivating thinking about leftovers! I would add an additional can of artichoke heats and be sure not to chop into very small pieces.

The flavors in this dish are phenomenal - My house has never smelled so good!

My only critique (which is not much of one) is that for some people, the juice might be too salty. I'd recommend use salt free or low sodium chicken stock (i'll be doing this next time) and it'll be perfect. 

Great dish - this is one recipe you'll want to hold on to!

Great recipe! This is one of our favorite recipes. The only things I do differently is we use spicy Italian sausage and fresh cherry peppers. To us is tastes better with fresh peppers. I have used boneless skinless chicken breasts when I did not have thighs and it was just as good.

i forgot to add chicken broth to the list, so i used white wine, i couldn't find the right peppers so i used a hot pepper, other than that i followed chef john perfectly.  it was heavenly.  lovely.  O i knew the sauce would be plentiful so i removed the thighs, added tapioca flour to it to thicken & poured it over the thighs.  naturally, we have left over sauce but it will be delicious with pasta & salad for a quick lunch tomorrow.  thank you chef.

Chef John never disappoints. This is an intensely flavorful dish. The stew tenderizes the chicken so well that you might conceivably substitute breast for thighs, though I had some thighs lying around in my freezer which was how I found the recipe. The only problem is that the peperoncini gives a very spicy, vinegary taste to the meal (which I personally like), so maybe cut it down to 1/2 cup or find a different ingredient at your discretion. Also, call me a philistine, but I don't know if there's any real benefit to adding both marjoram AND oregano as a garnish, since they taste so similarly.

I'm not sure if this is fair, right, but, I love this recipe, so does my hubby.  I have never made it with the stuffed peppers! Just 
Seemed like to much, but everything else just the same, I make it a couple of times a month and we love it.

I made the recipe exactly as written and was over the top happy with how great it turned out! My husband could not stop talking about how much he loved it. The layer upon layer upon layer flavors excite your palate over and over again. Cannot express enough how great this recipe is. Now, I just need to figure out how to do it in huge batches for my son's graduation party (wasn't planning to cook the main entree myself, but I feel the need to share this wonderful dish with the masses). Yum! ??

I tried really hard to understand the stellar ratings on this recipe and just failed.  I love all the ingredients.  I really do!  That's why I gave this a try.  Together they don't do it for me.  I did give it three stars because it was easy to make and one pot.  But, I won't make it again.

Wow... Made exactly as written and I can't imagine it being any better. This dish is VERY flavorful, so don't try it if you aren't into bold flavor. The chicken was incredibly tender and those little stuffed peppers are heavenly nuggets of sunshine. I will double those next time (2 16 oz jars). Thanks for the great addition to my meal rotation!

WOW! This recipe sounds good, but in reality was amazing.  The stuffed cherry peppers were our favorite part so the last time I made this I used 2 jars stuffed with 2 turkey sausage links and I subbed banana peppers for pepperoncini (just taste preference).  I serve this in large bowls  with a pile of quinoa in the middle for all the broth.

The first time I made it as closely as possible to Chef John's recipie - ps your videos are very well done...   We like a lot of heat in our dishes and this one has become a staple.
it's easy to scale back on the heat if you like.   

We've made it several times and when in a pinch for time I added cut sausage to the chicken step and sliced sweet and green pepers to the onion step.   Some spinach along with the olives and artichoke hearts isn't bad either - just saying.

It's excellent over angel hair or spaghetti squash with some crusty bread ! Kudo's Chef John.

This is a very good recipe, I loved the blend of all the flavors with a little spiciness to it. It was a lot prep (for me LOL) because I usually do simple stuff but this was actually fun to make and again I really enjoyed it. I will be making this again.

This is AMAZING!!!  My husband loved it so much...I've made it 3 times in a month....one of his favorites.  The chicken was so tender you could cut it with a fork.  The sweet peppers were delicious with the sausage.  I am greek and love kalamata olives so i added extra.  Doubled the red pepper as we both enjoy spicy food.  This dish has so much flavor.  Served it over rice and had a complete meal.  Lots of leftovers as i doubled the chicken.  This will be a new favorite in our home.

This was over the top good.  It takes a bit a time to put together but the results are outstanding.  I followed the recipe exactly except I increased the recipe to 8 and used my Le Crueset Caribbean Blue Large dutch over which really made a great presentation.  I highly recommend the Peppadew cherry peppers if you can find them and I used spicy Italian sausage cause my friends love the heat.  Great recipe Chef John!  Your Coq au Vin is next on my list.

Combination of flavors was remarkable. Made as written but with boneless thighs (which I think made it much easier to eat and retrieve from pot) minus fresh herbs, added some dry before roasting. Unfortunately way too spicy for me. Served with yellow rice and that cut the heat a little but not enough. I will try again and leave out crushed red pepper and the pepperoncini liquid. I really want to get this right so my teens will eat it. I think button mushrooms would be really good also.

Used chicken breasts sliced lengthwise then halved so to reduce fat. Leek instead of onion and found two cups of broth to be too much. Use just enough broth to mostly cover, which I found was just over one cup. Served with basmati rice. Excellent

The sausage stuffed peppers were awesome and the chicken was very tender, but the rest of the dish was a little vinegary and sweet for our taste.  Made it as shown with all the suggested ingredients.  The take away for us was that there were a lot of steps or ingredients that would be tasty in a different recipe.  For example, the stuffed peppers would make a delicious appetizer, or be great added to a simpler casserole.  The chicken technique was also good, just didn't care for the flavor combo.

This was really yummy. I didn't have chicken stock so I used some white wine instead. I also sprinkled some crumbled feta cheese on top before I served it. This dish has a lot of heat and is very flavorful. I forgot to add the crushed red pepper and I am glad I did because the heat from the cherry peppers was plenty.

Made this the other night and it was delicious. I wondered what my picky DH would say when he saw green stuff on his plate but he loved it and asked for more!  Only difference I used fresh jalapenos and black olive.

I made this recipe last night, it was fabulous!  It was easy to prepare using only one pot. I used chicken sausage and fresh as well as jarred hot peppers.  My family loved this dish, my father said I should open a restaurant!  This is one for the recipe box, I'll make it again and again.

Fantastic flavors meld together perfectly. Well-written recipe has just the right amount of zing and rich heat. I stuffed pickled cherry peppers with mild chicken sausage and served this flavor-infused deliciousness over brown rice. Big hit. No, HOME RUN.

I loved this!! Will definitely make this again! Gave the recipe to a couple of friends already! My wife loved it too! Not hard to make at all and I didn't think it was overpowering hot/spicy as you might think it will be. It must cook off somewhat during the process. I even used loose hot Italian sausage to stuff the cherry peppers with!
Thanks for sharing the recipe Chef John!

Spicy Wonderful!  CJ you have done it again.  This beats Lambage rolls which used to be at the top of my list.  For leftovers we served it over some rice.  How would you do something like this with Goat or lamb?

I don't usually rate recipes, but I had to with this one.  Usually I come here to get recipe ideas and then I tweak them.  I decided to follow this one to the letter because it is different then my normal cooking.  On the advice of my father in law, I did not substitute anything for the herbs de provence because it has lavender in it.  This recipe is absolutely delish exactly the way it is.  I would not change a thing about it..worth getting all the ingredients and even worth purchasing a large dutch oven.  I served it with rice and it was perfect.  I have never heard my dinner table so quiet. The chicken fell right off the bone.  The peppers were oh so good!  I may add more next time.

First let me say that I made this pretty much following the directions and it was great. But preparation did take time, so I will not be making it frequently, maybe just for special occasions. I used a combination of Peppadew peppers I had on hand and sweet cherry peppers. The Peppadews were small and fragile, making them difficult to stuff. But the sweet cherry peppers came whole and I had to remove the caps and seed before stuffing.

If you want to make a really special dinner to impress your guests, this is the recipe.

Wow, this delivered a flavor and spice bomb, as promised.  Although a big fan of hot food, I think I'll scale back the 1T of black pepper to 2t or maybe 1.5t.  The black pepper flavor was sort of overwhelming.  The sausage stuffed cherries were a treat for sure!  Thanks for the great meal.

Made this tonight and felt inclined to immediately review. This dish was amazing. Followed directions exactly except I used only 1/2 cup pepperoncini since other reviews said dish was super spicy. It still was very hot, but my husband and two teens loved it. Served with baguette to soak up delicious broth. It looked beautiful and smelled great. A real masterpiece!

Turned out just as it said.  Great! Chicken fell right off the bone, was undecided whether to serve with rice or noodles?  A lot of flavor easy to Make.
