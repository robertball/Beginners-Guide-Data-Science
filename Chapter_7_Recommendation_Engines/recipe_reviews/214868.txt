I followed the recipe exactly and even the kiddos liked it!  My husband is eager to try it with fresh pike or halibut.  Next time we'll omit the Creole and just salt and pepper generously.  By far...the caramalized corn flavor was what made this recipe a keeper!

The flavor of the batter was very good, but I would personally not recommend using Grouper.  I used it and it had a stronger "fishy" taste than I anticipated.  Next time I will use tilapia or try the red snapper.

I improvised a little.  Seasoned fish w black pepper & soul seasoning. Mixed flour with corn meal. Used corn meal in place of corn starch. It was fabulous! My family loved it!  I will definitely use this recipe again! Very easy and very delicious!

Followed the recipe except the bell pepper,wife can't eat them. We all loved it, including the mother in law. Will definitely be on our dinner table again.
