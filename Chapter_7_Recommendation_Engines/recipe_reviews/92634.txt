Upped the amounts significantly because my roast was more than 11 pounds. Also added thyme. Incredible taste. The sauce was average and probably wouldn't fool with it again but the beef was delicious and so tender.

Looks fancy and tastes extremely expensive but is fairly easy to put on the table.  I cut slits into my roast, put a sliver of garlic and a few leaves of rosemary into the slit instead of simply rubbing the outside of the roast.  The flavor is much stronger than simply rubbing the top.  I didn't mess with the mushroom sauce at all until the very end.

I really wanted to impress my husband with a wonderful romantic dinner in our new home and this recipe did the trick.  Two hints that really helped me, let the meat come up to room temp before you roast it just like the recipe says, and invest in thermometer, also let it rest for 15-30 minutes after you take it out of the oven, it will continue to cook...you really can't go wrong then.  The ajus was out of this world!

Oh my, am I happy. I had an approx. 2 lb single bone rib roast. Still made the entire sauce amount without scaling since I wanted sauce for not only the meat but mashed potatoes and Yorkshire Pudding. Oh MAN was this good. I did not understand the point of making the sauce after browning and then saving it for later, I just made the sauce after the meat was done and resting. Worked great and saves steps and items to cleanup. Also added some fresh thyme in addition to the rosemary. This is the way I want to cook this cut from now on, the entire roast was very uniformly cooked. PLUS that sauce is freaking delicious. Oh I used beef stock instead of chicken and cabernet sauvignon for the wine. Sensational thank you.

Followed recipe to the letter. Family complained that the meat was to cold even though i roasted it for the 21/2 hours. The flavor though was great!!! The sauce I didnt care for but everyone else really liked! I will make this again but I will cook it at a higher temp then the 250*.

I have made this roast twice. Once to practice for Christmas dinner and once for the real thing and now am in the process of making for the third time. The first time I made it I use the garlic and rosemary and the roast turned out delicious. For Christmas, we forgot the fresh rosemary when we went to the grocery store, so I just used salt, pepper and olive oil.  I think the real winning tip here is to remember to leave the meat out to get to room temperature and also to brown it before roasting. I have only been "on meat" for about a year, since I am a former vegetarian of 15 years, and not super experienced in cooking meat, yet. Both of my brother in laws said that the roast was cooked perfectly (which apparently is hard to do?). I also thought the roast was very tender and tasty. A couple more things. I thought the perfect doneness was achieved around 145 degrees and I added more corn starch to my mushroom sauce, because I prefer my sauces a little thicker. If you want something to make for a special occasion, or maybe you picked some prime rib up because it was on sale, this recipe is a real treat!

This was one of the best recipes I've tried in the past year.  The meat was tender and cooked to perfection.  My only suggestion is to adjust your cooking times a little bit. This was a great changed from the tradition turkey dinner for Christmas.

This looked and smelled wonderful.  I wish I had checked the markings on my meat thermometer first as it has Rare=140 and Medium=160 degrees.  I had followed the recipe instructions to cook to 140 degrees for Medium, but my meat was Rare!  After it is sliced, it can't really be reassembled and cooked more, so we had to microwave some for those that prefer Medium meat.  The seasonings are really only noticeable on the outer edge, so the sauce is a nice addition.

I made this for Christmas Eve Dinner with all the family there.  I had never made Prime Rib before and it turned out better than I could have hoped for.  Fantastic flavor, and it was easy.  I used dried Rosemary from my garden because I didn't have fresh, and that worked just fine.  I made the mushrooms to go along with the rib and they turned out very good also, but took away from the great taste of the meat.  I ate the mushrooms on the side and they were a good side dish.  I will make this one again for sure.

Not sure what the problem was, but the meat was not exceptionally tender. However, we did cook it in a countertop convection oven so that reduced the cook time and may have been part of the problem. Also, the mushroom sauce was not great either. And I followed the recipe exactly.

I used a five pound bone-in Angus prime rib, and it was spectacular!  The beef was amazingly tender and perfectly flavored.  I served it with a mushroom gravy or horseradish sauce, boursin mashed potatoes and roasted asparagus.  What a hit!

My husband and I loved this recipe. I added a lot more rosemary and garlic. I also added quite a bit more salt as we like salt. I always come back to this recipe when I am looking for something simple and great. I am looking forward to serving it at Christmas this year.

We have made it 4 times over the last few years and it is always great.  The searing holds in the juices and the seasoning is simple, yet very, very good.  

It took a little over 3 hours to cook our 5 pound prime rib, so give yourself a few extra minutes.

I was really disappointed with this.  The sauce I made exactly as it said, DH hated it and I thought it was so-so.  

The meat was ok, a little too rare for me (cooking time was off).  I did get it to 140 which is rare (time contraints were an issue).  Flavor was just ok for me.  Meat was tender though.

This is the first 4.5 star recipe I've rated under.  I will not make this again.

This was the first time I ever prepared a prime rib. It without a doubt riveled most restaurant prime ribs I have had. I also used beef broth instead of chicken, and used additional dried herbs in the rub. Simply outstanding!

Thought this was great and the whole family loved it for Christmas.  Added some thyme and Dijon to the rub and used fresh, organic herbs rather than dried.  Also used beef broth rather than chicken for the sauce.  It was wonderful and received raves from everyone.  This one is indeed a keeper!!

I needed to change the recipe to eliminate the mushrooms (some of our guests did not care for mushrooms) and it did not work out for me.  Also, the sauce turned out salty.  The roast did cook perfectly and the instructions overall were great.  I will try the recipe as originally advised the next time but I do have concerns about how to eliminate mushrooms and still get good results.  Thanks!

I've never taken the time to write a review, but this one is WORTH it!! A+ recipe.  The flavor was amazing and the sauce got 2 thumbs up from a real Frenchwoman.  My kids thought it was better than Thanksgiving...we have a new favorite. The only thing I did differently was us a bone in roast.

Outstanding recipe!  The roast came out absolutely perfect and aside from doubling the sauce recipe was followed to the letter.  Everyone was impressed and several called it "the best prime rib I have ever tasted."

The meat/seasoning was delicious, but I would recommend cooking it to a slightly higher temperature if you only have one oven. I think it would still please those who like med-rare, but give some more time to raise the oven temperature to complete side dishes.

Incredibly good!  Followed the recipe to a tee and the gravy was fantastic!!  My family raved about this dish and there were virtually no leftovers!  Will absolutely make this again.  I was worried that the boneless cut would not be as tasty as the bone-in roast but this recipe proved that idea wrong!

This was the best Prime Rib ever!  My boyfriend and I made this for New Years and were very impressed.  We had a little 2.5 pound Prime Rib, which was perfect for us.  We used less of the Salt and Pepper on it since it was small, but ended up using all the Garlic and Rosemary on it (in every nook and cranny) The sauce wasn't extraordinary, but it accompanied the meat very well.  We did love the mushrooms with it however.  Would definitely make this again!!  It made our New Years one to remember!

The sauce is very good. The roast was seasoned nicely but I had to adjust the cooking temp & time, 250 was too low.  After 3 hours at 250 I had to bump up my temp to 375 for 30 min  or so just to get my meat at 130 degrees and I was only cooking a 3 1/2 lb boneless rib roast!

Meat & sauce was good although the mushrooms seemed to absorb the mustard flavor. Maybe try without mustard next time.

Wow! Absolutely delicious and easy to do! This was my first attempt at cooking a roast like this, and it was super yummy! I do recommend using a themometer to monitor the temperature of the roast, but I did cook mine for exactly 2.5 hours for an internal temp of 140. I also tented the roast after cooking letting it rest for a while before cutting. It was a picture perfect roast!

I tried this and my friend that doesn't like prime rib said it was the best steak she has ever had! It was a huge hit with the in laws and all the friends we had over. I will make this again for all special occasions.
I did marinade it over night before cooking and put it on the smoker instead of in the oven.

My husband picked out this recipe and I'm glad he did! It was amazing!! Even my young kids wanted more. Be warned, the house might get smokey during the frying step. And I think next time I might try a different wine for the sauce. The meat was so tasty-PERFECT!

I also had to up the recipe to fit the size of the roast I had. I needed to factor the time and temp. for the roast while also having to make some beef bullion because I couldn't get as much as I needed. Add some seasoning to the sauce as well for I thought it was a tad bit too tangy for how salty and tender the meat was. . .

I took a chance attempting this meal for Christmas dinner and it was a HUGE hit!! Everyone STILL talks about "The Best Prime Rib I ever Had!" The only thing I did differently was I cut down on the garlic a bit.  I didn't get alot of dripping from the meat and I was a little concerned, but the sauce was still very tasty. I will be making this again and again.

I made this for Christmas dinner and everyone loved it! We did have to cook it a little longer, but that could be because it was partially frozen in the middle. I cooked it so that it was medium to medium rare. Otherwise it was wonderful.

I cooked a 7 lb standing rib roast and took it out when internal temp was 120 degrees. I let roast rest for 20 minutes before serving.  It was medium rare and delicious.

This method and timing makes the perfect boneless rib eye roast! Medium-rare and a hit with everyone I've ever made this for. 
Keep the browning timing as it suggests. If you brown it too long, the oven timing needs to be shortened.
Low oven temperature helps keep the oven clean too!
I leave the meat out to get to room temperature for several hours before cooking - this is key!
I tried the sauce once. Not crazy about it.

OMG! Better than the prime rib dinner I paid megabucks for at the local high end steak house! Took it out at 145 for a perfect medium. The red wine mushroom sauce was to die for.

Really good! Nice and tender, very savory. Took closer to 3.5-4 hours to achieve 135 degrees (medium rare), but it was well worth the wait.

Rubbed with Montreal steak seasoning and the other stuff per the recipe. My boyfriend had never had super homemade prime rib and was skeptical but he absolutely loved it. It was so moist and juicy and cut with a fork. Thank you for making me look like a wonderful cook

I do NOT cook.  I decided to take a chance and try it for my entire Christmas dinner.  IT WAS FANTASTIC!!  Followed directions EXACTLY as is (like I said, I don't cook)  THANK YOU THANK YOU!!  My family loved it and was thoroughly impressed.

It was very heavy on the garlic for my tastes, but other than that, it was very tasty!  Prime Rib is such a good cut of meat, you almost can't go wrong.  A few helpful suggestions:  instead of salt, I used sea salt, and for cooking, I used the pure convection setting on my oven.  If you have that option, cook at 425 for 20 minutes, and then 200 for 1.5 hours.  If the roast was at room temperature when you started, that should be plenty of time to cook it to somewhere between medium rare and medium.

Even with misreading some directions and leaving out the mushroom, this was still a moist and delicious roast recipe for my first try. Excited to try again, with more care.

I made it for a Thanksgiving Dinner for two. My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The recipe was easy to follow even though I used a 6lb bone-in Prime Rib instead of the prescribed 5lb bone-out.

I used this recipe for a couple of boneless ribeye steaks. They were AMAZING. I followed the instructions in proportion to the 2, 1lb steaks I purchased. The flavor and tenderness were incredible and this was probably the best steak I’d ever made. The mushrooms made it even better and rounded out the flavor quite nicely.

I only made the wine sauce to cook mushroom in.  Excellent sauce!  I will definitely make the sauce again, and plan on trying the whole prime rib recipe as well.

Easy recipe.  I didnt change any of the ingredients just the cooking time.  I cooked mine for about 3 1/2 hours.  It tasted great and was very tender.

This was delicious.  I had a 3.5 lb roast and tried to time my dinner based on the times given less 1.5 lbs.  So glad I have a great meat thermometer and didn't solely rely on my calculations.  Roast took 2.5 hours and that was after adjusting the temp to 325 after realizing it may be midnight before dinner is served.  Still - cooked to a perfect med-rare.  Lots of great flavor and had just enough drippings for a wonderful yorkshire pudding!

I had a 7 pound roast. Night before, I made a paste out of rosemary, garlic, salt and pepper and used a sharp knife to peel back the fat layer on the top of the roast. covered the underlying meat with the paste, and replaced the fat layer. Then, I used cooking twine to tie the roast together. Let it marinate overnight - then proceeded with the rest of the recipe as written. DELICIOUS!!!

Excellent! Recipe is spot on. The meat was like butter, perfectly cooked. I prefer an Au ju to the thicker gravy but it was rich & tasty.

7 pounder worked perfectly. Needed an extra half hour,  just went by a meat thermometer.

the first time I made the sauce, I thought it was too similar in taste.  The next time I used beef broth instead of chicken broth, omitted the mustard, and added 2 Tbsp red plum jam.  The salty/sweet was a nice contrast.

Absolutely delicious!  This prime rib made a great Christmas dinner for 5 people, with a little leftover.  Easy-to-follow recipe, didn't change anything.  The expensive cut of meat was worth it!  This is a keeper for my holiday meals.

Roasted USDA Choice 7 lb strip loin in convection oven @ 300 & pulled it @ 143.  It was dry, tough, medium (rather than medium rare), & over-powered by the taste of garlic & rosemary.
