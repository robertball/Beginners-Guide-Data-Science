I'm not a fan of mayo, so typical potato salads don't appeal to me.  This new recipe caught my eye w/the use of sour cream in place of mayo.  I halved the recipe and chose to use cheater bacon bits rather than fry bacon.  This. Is. So. Good!!  It truly tastes like a baked potato.  You could personalize this with any of your favorite baked potato toppings.  I also chose to leave the skins on all my potatoes and chopped BEFORE boiling (seemed easier to me).  THANKS for the recipe; this one's a keeper!

I thought this was good, but for whatever reason, the batch I made turned out a little bit dry.  I doubled the recipe, but otherwise followed it as directed.  It received good reviews from everyone at my Easter table.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, littlepeepsbrude!

I had a baked potato salad at a German meat market, and I've been trying to duplicate it for months...THIS is what I wanted. Served chilled or room temp, it's still fresh and flavorful. My favorite picnic accompaniment, and goes well with a nice roast, too. Thanks for this one!
