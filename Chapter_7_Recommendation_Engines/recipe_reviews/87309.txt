I can't say enough about how fantastic these are!  Brilliant! I used my Kitchenaid meat grinder to grind all of the shrimp, which made it very painless.  I used a bit more cilantro than called for, and added a little light mayonnaise to the slaw rather than oil to make it "creamier".  I served it with fresh pita bread from a recipe on this site - so easy. I was worried about the burger falling apart so I added some extra breadcrumbs, but it actually stayed together really well, and the whole concoction just tasted so fresh and wonderful.  We re-heated two of them to eat the next day, and it tasted just as good as the day before. I can't wait to make these again!

I have made these 3 times in the last 2 weeks!! I think they are fabulous and so did everyone I served. Mine held together perfectly and have a wonderful "burger" texture~ and a wonderful subtle flavor. I added a bit more jalapeno for more "bite". I also made a thai satay sause to serve with the burgers. I served cous-cous made with canned lite coconut juice and pine nuts as well as the slaw. Pickles, onions,etc. I shall keep this reciped FOREVER.

May I suggest also trying Salmon Burgers. FANTASTIC!!

This was very good. Made small patties like you would for falafel and cooked it on my GF type grill. I did not have problems with it falling apart. I used seasoned bread crumbs and added some asian chili garlic sauce. Did not split the pitas but used the pocket. Added a peanut dressing to the slaw and tossed in a few peanuts as well. The shrimp paste is a bit sticky but this was easy to make.

Great and simple recipe. I just threw everything in the processor and had them ready in about a minute. They are delicate, so I cooked them on the stovetop rather than the grill. They work without the bread as well - served like a crabcake.

Flavors were great, but the burgers didn't hold together at all, so for a wrap filler it's OK.

these are AMAZING.  1) I used my kitchenaid food grinder for all of the shrimp and it worked beautifully 2) I didn't use as much cilantro, because... i really hate cilantro.  3) I used half a jalapeno because the peanut sauce I use is so spicy.  4) I also served them inside the pita, with the slaw stuffed in with them.  5) I cooked them in a frying pan on the stove. If you do this, be careful! They burn really easily. I learned that if you cook them on medium heat it takes a little longer but they won't burn so quickly.   All in all, excellent!

Wow, are these good! I rarely make repeats, but I've been making these almost weekly since I found the recipe. There is a lot of chopping and prep work, which I try to do in advance; however, the burgers are easy to make, and they taste so clean, fresh and healthy! I haven't fired up the grill for them but have been baking them in my toaster oven instead. I've also morphed these into meatballs and served them over shredded sauteed cabbage and called it Asian Spaghetti.

They weren't terrible but they weren't great to me either.  The flavors are really great together but I didn't like the texture of the burger very well.  I think it would taste better to just cook the shrimp in the seasonings rather than ground up the shrimp into a burger like that.  Maybe I will try this recipe again sometime but with ground turkey instead.

OK, here it is. First I used cooked shrimp, since that is what I had on hand. Second, if you grill these do it on a piece of foil. They stick crazy bad and you can not flip them.  Now with that said... After I managed to salavge some parts of each burger (half remained stuck to grill) and finish grilling on foil.  They actually tasted pretty good. So maybe my grilling problem had to do with using cooked shrimp, however they still had good flavor. Oh, yea.. make the slaw it is wonderful! I used the Rainbow salad slaw mix for extra color and crunch. About 1/2 of my guests thought that this was a side dish on its own and ate it without the burger. yum!

I made this recipe and it was fantastic.  When I was preparing it, my boyfriend thought it looked unappetizing, and was going to make something else.  He was glad I made him try it.  I used broccoli slaw and it turned out great.  If it is packed well, it stays together well.

I was really scared as I was making this because it looks really strange, but it tastes great. I added in a bit more seasoned bread crumbs and omitted the jalaps, but I think they need them (I was just worried it would be too spicy w/ them). My nine year old daughter ate this as well. We cooked these on a gas grill. The marks on it were beautiful and they held together perfectly. I didn't have any cabbage, so I just served them w/ lettuce and spicy mustard and bbq sauce. Next time I will add more peanut sauce to the mixture because I could hardly taste it...then I will use the slaw mixture as well. Thanks for the recipe.

These were quick to make and tasty. They had some trouble remaining in tact as a burger, but that is probably due to the fact we didn't refridgerate as directed. We put them on 100% wheat Greek Pita Flatbread which was delicious! A little more veggies like some fresh spinach and slices of onion and maybe tomato would've improved it a bit.

I loved them, however I forgot to buy the peanut sauce so this is what I did...  This makes 6 good size burgers, I bought 2 1kg bags of frozen shrimp( thawed peeled and chopped) added garlic 3-4 cloves, chopped ginger 2-3tbs, 2 jalapeño peppers, 1 Tbl chili pepper flakes, 3 Tbl of chopped cilantro, 1/2 cup of bread crumbs, juice of 1 lime, and 1 egg beaten.  When you make the patties dip your hands in flour and lightly coat the edge of patties, keeps the patties from sticking to everything.  I cooked them on a gas grill on a well seasoned cookie sheet, added a small amount of butter on the top of each patty while cooking on high heat for about 3-5 mins a side ( depends how thick they are) works awesome!  Huge hit at our house, everyone loved them!

Sounds like a great recipe, I can’t wait to try it!  I make Shrimp Burgers with a similar recipe which include some lime zest.  I pan fried them in a little garlic butter and served them on a toasted bun with lettuce, tomato and avocado…..what a hit!!

The good news-bad news is that you have to prepare and eat them in short order.  They are good cold and sort of OK when nuked. Best when hot and sizzling. 

While cruising the net, I came across  Chef Big Shake’s Original Shrimp Burgers from www.TheQuickShipWarehouse.com . They come frozen and have a year shelf life. Pretty easy to prepare and quite good which makes it nice when the spirit moves you. 

After cooking, we squeeze a little fresh lime on them and add the avocado.  Voilà!

Amazing flavor!  The first time I made it they fell apart a bit. This may be because I used cooked shrimp. Second time I added an egg used raw shrimp and they came out just right. I put them on a buttered toasted brioche bun, topped with some slaw, sliced avocado and sriracha mayo. Really really good!

My only complaint is how the directions are written.  I frequently change the serving size so didn't pay attention in the directions about how much peanut sauce to add in the beginning only to be surprised later in the directions when it said add remaining sauce...oops.  I will take partial responsibility as I should have read through first but even if I did it is difficult to change serving size if there amount is written in the directions.  Otherwise it was delicious!!
