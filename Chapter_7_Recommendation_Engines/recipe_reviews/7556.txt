The general idea of the recipe is great, but it's way too much sugar.  I prepared the frosting with 1 1/2 cups of sugar, and even then it was a bit on the sweet side, so I added more lemon juice.  But with these adjustments, it was great.

I almost didn't make this because another review complained about it being too thin and more like a glaze than a frosting. Glad I tried it anyway! Don't know what that other reviewer did wrong but this is great frosting. I did have to add 2 more teaspoons of lemon juice to get the spreading consistency I needed, but that's not a problem. This great tasting frosting not only spread beautifully but it also pipes well and holds its shape. I'd happily recommend this to anyone looking for a lemon cake frosting.

Great frosting!!  I did make a few adjustments though.  Used 3 Tablespoons of lemon juice instead of two, and only used 4 cups of powdered sugar.  The result was sweet, tangy, and delectable.  Kind of reminded me of lemon meringue pie.

it's supposed to be 5 OUNCES of sugar, not 5 cups! 5 oz is about 1-1/4 cups, spooned and leveled - which makes a really lovely frosting. This recipe has WAY too much sugar.

This is a pretty basic recipe for cream cheese frosting. If you're looking for an especially sweet and tangy frosting, I would recommend omitting the vanilla extract and replacing it with another tbsp or so of lemon juice. 

More powdered sugar is what helps you achieve an excellent thick frosting for topping cupcakes with if you use a pastry bag and tip, or if you're in an especially crafty mood, piping out shells or roses and the like. It's what helps the icing hold its shape. If you prefer a thinner frosting you can use to spread over a cake, then, yes, you will want to use less powdered sugar. I personally find four cups to be enough, but that is just me.

Rather than taking other reviews' word for this being "too thick" or "too thin," try adding the powdered sugar in 1/2 cup increments to achieve the frosting consistency you want. If it ends up a little thicker than you'd like, add a tbsp or so of milk at a time and mix it in well. 

Hope this helps, and happy frosting! ;)

I used a box butter cake mix recipe with lemon curd as the middle layer icing and the lemon cream cheese frosting for the outer layer. It was fantastic!

Decent enough as is, but with so much powdered sugar a good deal of cream cheese flavor and its distinctive tang was unfortunately lost.  This might be much better with 1-2 cups less sugar for a real cream cheesey taste.  Very lemony - glad I chose to use it on a basic white cake.

This was a great recipe!
Made it for my lemon cake that I used to only glaze. That will never happen again, this frosting will always be on our lemon cake from now on. Baked it for my dad and took it to his resturant, the next day he called wanting the recipe for 2 people.
Thanks Carol

Very Very Good! didnt' add as much sugar because I didnt' want it to take aways from the cream cheese flavor. I made a white cake with lemon curd filling and the cream cheese frosting on top. Very good. Thank you!

I was looking for a 'different' icing for a hot milk cake- this was excellent.....rich, creamy. I added a few drops of yellow food coloring to make it 'look' more lemony...will definitely use this one again !

I actually had to add more sugar in order to keep the frosting stable on the ginger cupcakes I made.  I took them to work and everybody raved, and I personally didn't find it too sweet either.  I'll use this recipe again!

Made as written, didn't make any changes. Might be good to leave the frosting in the fridge for a few minutes before frosting the cake, it was a little runny.

This is fabulous. I think 5 cups of sugar would be a little too sweet for most people, but it does need a fair amount to be thick enough to pipe. I added all the confectioner's sugar I had which was about 2.5 cups I think, and it was fine on sweetness but not quite the thickness I wanted. It wasn't runny, so if you wanted a spreadable frosting it would be ok, but I wanted to pipe. It would have needed at least 3-4 cups of sugar to hold its shape properly but in terms of taste you can't really go wrong, add to your liking. All that to say, very delicious! I used it on vanilla cupcakes with a raspberry whipped cream filling.

Don't know what these people who are complaining it is too sweet are doing. This is the exact recipe I use for my cream cheese frosting on my carrot cake. Definately NOT too sweet. If they only use 1 1/2 cups of powdered sugar they will end up with a glaze and not a frosting.

LOVED this flavor.  The basics are there...I simply adjusted to my palate.  I added 1 Tbs. more of lemon juice and 1/2 tsp. of more zest.  Took the powdered sugar down by 11/2 cups and it was perfect for not only cake (even a lemon cake at that) but also Christmas sugar cookies that I felt needed a zip! :)  It's a frosting I will use over and over again to add a zing to all my cake and cookie flavors.

Only used 1 cup sugar and consistency still turned out fine.  Not too sweet and you get more of the lemon flavor.  There is enough to frost 12 cupcakes.  Will be my go-to lemon flavored frosting from now on.

Delicious! Tangy and sweet. Needs to be refrigerated before piping, otherwise spreads on well.

This recipe is fantastic, and my husband wants me to make two more cakes, NOW...used this frosting on the "Lemon Gold Cake" recipe on this site, and the pairing is just awesome for lemon lovers.  I zested a large lemon and then used the juice, added powdered sugar til it was just right for my taste buds, and WOW!  This is what I love about this site, we get to try any recipe we want, make it our own and still give credit to those who originally put it out there for us to taste.  And when my husband keeps wanting "repeats", I know it is a keeper.  Thank you so much!

Good basic recipe, but I cut the sugar in half, increased the cream cheese and butter, and upped the lemon juice and zest.  Would have been nauseatingly sweet otherwise.  I used the recipe here as a starting point but then ended up changing it a lot to get a nice, tart, cream cheese frosting.

This was good but not enough lemon flavour for me.  I swapped the vanilla extract for lemon and it was perfect!  I also think that amount of icing sugar is off...I used 4 cups and might even reduce it to 3 1/2 next time.

The frosting was excellent.  I used 3 T lemon juice and 4 cups confection sugar and i forgot the vanilla and it had rave reviews.  Put it on a Lemon Cake mix with Lemon curd in the middle of the 2 cakes.. Superb!

The BEST! This frosting was amazing. Make sure the lemon zest is in very small pieces not strips. If you are planning to decorate and the frosting needs to hold its shape you must use all of the sugar the recipe calls for. Great balance of all the flavors.

Really tasty frosting.  I added 2 tbsp of Pineapple juice and took out the vanilla.  The lemon and juice compliment each other and this was very delicious on my pineapple cream cupcakes. :)

Thank you for the recipe! I went by some of the suggestions - reduced the sugar to four cups, left out the vanilla, put the icing in the fridge to chill for a few hours (though I should have taken it out for a few minutes before icing my cake as it was a bit stiff). It was just enough to ice a two layer cake with a small amount in between the layers.  I baked the Luscious Lemon Cake recipe from the Robin Hood Flour recipe (which I tweaked by using lemon yogurt instead of plain and adding about a teaspoon of lemon juice), sprinkled the top of the cake with coconut and everyone loved the results!  It made a lovely dessert for a Mother's Day dinner.

I enjoy the flavor of this frosting although I added more lemon zest and cut the sugar by a cup. The extra sugar would make the frosting stiffer, but I wanted a less sweet frosting. I tried it on lemon cupcakes, next time I am going to try a full cake.

Wonderful frosting!  I used it to frost a spice cake and it was a perfect compliment.  If you have one, be sure to use a micro-plane zester.

This is the best cream cheese frosting I've ever had!  It's perfect and thick for cakes or cupcakes.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  If you omit the lemon zest and juice, you have an excellent regular cream cheese icing.  I added coconut extract for some coconut cupcakes I made and it was to die for!

Excellent icing.  Consistancy is great.  You can change the flavoring of the extract and change the taste completely.  Very versatile recipe.

Simply delicious. I followed the directions to a "t" and it turned good. It wasn't to sweet to me. The frosting turned out just fine despite what other viewers had to say. It was thick enough for my cream cheese pound cake. Thanks for sharing.

This was a great recipe and easy too.  The flavor is just to die for.  However, I did not care too much for the daffodil cake.

Way too sweet and almost no lemon flavor. I threw most of it away. However, omit the lemon zest and it would probably be good for piping designs.

Absolutely delicious! The lemon zest adds a beautiful, pale-yellow tint to the frosting and the addition of fresh lemon juice is amazing. We didn't even rinse off the beaters because we had licked them clean. We topped it with a fresh strawberry glaze for a lemony twist on traditional strawberry shortcake. Absolutely perfect frosting. Thanks!

This icing is great for Lemon/Orange Peel cookies.  When i use it for orange I just substitute the lemon for oranges! Awesome all the way around!

This frosting was wonderful.  I used 4 C of confectioners sugar and the just added lemon juice until I had a nice spreading consistency.  It tasted wonderul and I used it to ice some lemon cookies I also found from this site.  Delish!

I thought this was a fantastic, light tasting icing.  I made angel food cupcakes like a previous reviewed suggested.  My husband loved them.  I disagree phil's review--I used 2 cups confectioners suger and the icing had a perfect consistency--not a gaze, but more like a frosting.  If you want to cut the sugar, I recommend this.

I love the frosting. It turned out rich and creamy and for once it didn't curdle the butter or cheese. I did use less sugar than it called for about 2.5 cups to be exact, and it is much thicker than a glaze, its just right!

This recipe was great for my lemon cake ... I used somewhere between 4 and 5 cups of powdered sugar. and of course it did need more lemon juice .. used a small bit of heavy cream for extra liquid .. I think everyone would make some sort of adjustments for the spreading consistency ... whipped it up on high speed and was light and fluffy.

Fantastic frosting!!! This is a great recipe to make "to taste". Start out with a little less sugar and then just keep adding until you are amazed! Do the same with the lemon juice too. Try going a little heavier on the cream cheese and you have a great fruit dip!

Taste was excellent, but mine was runny.  Not firm to hold up on a cupcake.  Recipe needs meringue powder to help with structure.

I tried to scale it back to frost just a few cupcakes and it did turn out like a thick glaze, but that was o.k. I also added a bit of pink lemonade powder to it to give it a boost of lemon flavor and a pretty pink color - that worked out great!

very nice. made minor changes to taste (but that is to be expected for any recipe).  used 4 tbsp fresh lemon juice, only a little zest for color and used about 4 1/3 cups sugar. Added a little more sugar as for children. beautiful. frosting didn't need to be chilled before icing cupcakes; great consistency. kids at church will love it!

Didnt have the right sugar so just used regular sugar and blended into a powder, I blended 1 Cup and 1/3 of sugar and ended up using half of that only because it was too sweet allready, cant imagine it at 5 cups!

I was looking for a lemon frosting to use on a lemon curd filled cake I was making for my aunts 88th birthday party .... saw this, read the reviews and decided to give it a try.  My husband tasted it before it was even on the cake and fell in love with it!  The cake was a huge hit at the party and my aunt who is a huge fan of lemon cake thought it was delicious.  My teenaged son has requested I bake another cake this time using a key lime curd filling and converting this recipe into a key line frosting.  Pretty basic recipe here so I don't think it will be a problem to substitute the lemon juice & zest with lime.  
I agree with a few of the other reviews about cutting back on the powdered sugar a bit since it can get a bit sweet but I tasted as I went along and when it seemed a bit to sweet I just added a little more lemon juice & zest.  I won't highly recommend this recipe infact I've already passed it along to friends!  Thanks!!!!!!

This frosting was great, although mine was more like a glaze.  Still it was really good and got rave reviews from all my family and friends.  Next time I will use less sugar.  After I put in 3 cups, I tasted it and the lemon came through perfectly. I then added the other 2 cups of sugar to make the 5 cups, and had to readd more lemon zest and juice to get the lemon flavor back.  It still turned out great.

I followed the directions exactly and it came out perfect. One person commented that it should be 5 oz of sugar, not 5 cups, that is incorrect. Also, if the frosting comes out too thin, put it in the fridge and remix when ready to frost. This is a simple, delightful recipe.

This was so good I would give it a 5 star but I think it needs more lemon juice. But that's my opinion since I like things a bit more acidic.

This is delicious as long as you reduce the sugar, as many others have noted.  I used 3 cups.  Also, it is plenty lemony without the zest, I did not use it.

This frosting recipe is PHENOMENAL!  It's easy to use and absolutely delicious.  The only thing I'd adapt is adding twice the amount of lemon zest and a bit more lemon juice to extend the powerful burst of citrus flavor.  Please use this one over the rest! :)

After I adjusted the amount of sugar from 5 cups to 1&1/4 cup thanks to another review and had finished the recipe, I found that it was not enough to frost a 2 layer cake. I wish I had known because I am out of ingredients and short on frosting. Taste is fine. Thanks for sharing.

Pretty good. Smooth and creamy. Was great on vanilla cupcakes. I reduced the sugar amount by half suggested. Worth making it again, but will be looking for another cream cheese frosting recipe.

This recipe is perfect as is.  The person who said it should be 5 ounces of powdered sugar instead of 5 cups is wrong.  As written it ends up being perfectly creamy, lemony, and just right for sweetness.  I don't normally like cake much, but we had this on a lemon box cake and I kept eating it just for the frosting.  When I made it, the cream cheese and butter were cool but workable, and with the 5 cups of powdered sugar it was just right to spread easily.

Nice lemon 'zing' with a cream cheese base - and the only thing I did wrong was listen to the reviewers who said to cut back on the sugar.  The texture wasn't quite firm enough with only 4 cups of sugar - I thought it was when I first took it off the mixer, but then quickly realized it needed more sugar to stiffen up a bit more.  Will definitely try it again, next time with the 5 full cups of sugar.

Delicious!  The perfect compliment to my lemon cupcakes.  This will definitely be a recipe I will use over and over.  My kids loved this frosting, too.  I took a couple over to our retired neighbors next door and she called later to tell me how much her husband loved them since he really enjoys lemon.  I didn't measure the lemon juice precisely as I used fresh lemons and just squeezed them in and went by consistency.  I also only used a dash of lemon zest as it is a turn-off for my kids.  The reviewer who gave this one star and claims that the sugar amount is off obviously never makes homemade frosting!

I can definitely see how people got a glaze consistency when making this frosting, because that's what happened when I made it! Some reviewers mentioned that they had to use an extra tablespoon of lemon juice, and a cup or two less of sugar because it wasn't thin enough, but that was not the case at all for me. Maybe I should have tightly packed the sugar when I was measuring it? I don't know! It is super yummy, though -- a perfect combination of sweet and tart -- it's just a little too runny for my cupcakes. I'm hoping that some time in the refrigerator will stiffen it up!

Loved this recipe - only adjustment was a little less sugar (I found 4 cups to be enough) and threw it in the fridge for a few minutes to firm it up before frosting.... But a GREAT light but sweet summer treat!

Delicious frosting! I didn't use all the sugar like some other reviewers and it worked out perfectly. I just added and tasted till it was how I wanted it. Put it on lemon cupcakes with a lemon curd and yum! So good! Definitely a keeper.

Fabulous recipe.  Pretty much did as recipe
said, used about 3 tsp of zest though.  Came
out perfect.  Will use this one often.  I put it
on a moist lemon cake but it would also
be great on a white cake.

This frosting was okay.  I used it on top of the "Lemon Cream Cupcakes," and I thought it was just too sweet.  The recipe calls for 5 cups of confectioners' sugar.  I used 2 cups, and even that was too much.  I might try making this recipe again, but I'll definitely be cutting back even more on the amount of sugar!

This was exellent frosting - nicely lemony, nicely sweet, nicely cream cheesy.  I actually had to add about an extra half cup of pwd. sugar to get the consistency I wanted.  I don't think the sugar took away from the cream cheese flavor at all - it is actually a standard amount of sugar for a frosting recipe.  I put it on a gingerbread, which is a wonderful complement.

Good icing. I used it as both the filling and the icing on a two layer cake. Like the lemon flavor as it was not overpowering. Needs to firm up in the refrigerator though to prevent the layers from sliding when icing the rest of the cake. Kids licked the bowl, spoon, and beater.

I am now addicted to this frosting!  I don't like a strong cream cheese flavor, so I was glad that this recipe mellows out the taste of the cream cheese.  It has a good strong lemon flavor.

I thought this tasted like plain lemon frosting, there was too much sugar and it cancelled out the cream cheese flavor.  Next time I will use 2 cups of sugar, which is what my regular cream cheese frosting recipe has, and simply add the lemon zest and juice.

I did not have lemon zest so I added a bit more lemon juice also I only added 3 cups of sugar rather than 5. I think 5 cups of sugar would have been way too much. Overall this is an ok frosting. I would make it again with different mesurements.

Very nice and lemony.  5 cups or so of sugar is good (I guess it depends how tightly you pack it into your measuring cup).

Here's what NOT to do: Use low-fat/fatfree cream cheese or low-fat butter. Probably a good recipe with too much sugar, but the low fat cream/butter will not thicken and you'll be left with a runny, sweet mess.

We loved this! I halved the recipe and it used it to top sugar cookies with strawberries, blueberries, and pineapple for individual fruit pizzas. It was very good and I can't wait to try this on a cake recipe. I will make this again!

This was excellent, but I made a few modifications.  My lemon zester wasn't working so I skipped the zest and added an extra tablespoon of lemon juice.  Also, I only used between 2 1/2 and 3 cups of powdered sugar - I think 5 would have been way too much.  After beating it for a while with the stand mixer, it came out light and fluffy.  I used it with the lemon chiffon cake recipe from this site.

This recipe was so easy to make, and coming from someone who barely enters the kitchen that's a huge compliment, and it was absolutely delicious. I made minor changes, substituted lemon ingredients with lime ones and used only 3 teaspoons of confectioner's sugar. It was for my mom's, who is a caterer, birthday and she practically moaned upon her first bite! Thanks so much carol, great recipe!

Used this to frost a boxed lemon cake.  I think I like the frosting better than the cake!  I realized, after frosting the cake, that I had left out the vanilla.  I wouldn't have known the difference and I really can't imagine adding that warm woodsy flavor to all these cool tangy flavors.  I would think the vanilla would take away too much of the tang.  I didn't measure the sugar... just kept adding until it was as thick as I wanted it.  I added a full two pound bag and I was happy with it at that point.    I don't find it "too" sweet, but my sweet tooth and I have an excellent relationship.  And, really, how can a mixture of fat and sugar be "too" sweet??  That's it's purpose!

Soooo good!  I used this frosting to ice the roll-out cookies from this site, and everyone loved them.  I used 3 c. powdered sugar, which made the frosting a perfect consistency and taste -- not too sweet, not too tart.  Definitely a keeper!

i only used 1 cup of sugar and it was perfect for my taste--i wanted something more tangy than sweet, so you could taste the lemon and cream cheese (which was the point of making this frosting!) i can't even fathom it with 5 cups of sugar!

I intended to use this icing for some frseh-baked cookies I made. The cookies only turned out so-so but this frosting was/is fantastic! I love the lemony- cheese cake like flavor given by the cream cheese in this recipe. I can't wait to try it on a freshly baked lemon cake!

YUMMMMM!! I thought I could get away with 4c of powdered sugar but it was too thin. So I added a 5th cup and it was perfect. I also added a few drops of yellow food color. It's beautiful and delicious.

Great recipe, taste as you add the P. Sugar so you can get it to your liking, it's pretty sweet and I love sweet frosting! If you run out of powdered sugar like me, just throw a cup of sugar/1 t of cornstarch in a blender and mix for a minute or two until it's powdery.

I used it on the Lemon Bundt Cake submitted by Phyllis on this website and it became an instant family hit. Sprinkle it with slivered almonds if you like; it will add a nice bit of crunch and interest.  I did this for a party months ago, and I STILL have people calling for the recipe!

I used this on Happy Birthday Cake (also submitted by Carol)-- a winning combination!  Refreshing lemon taste, creamy texture and easy to make.  Another plus- the little bits of lemon zest disguised the cake crumbs that brushed off when I frosted the cake.

I halved the recipe and used only 3/4 cup of icing sugar instead, and it turned out a smat buttery and tangy. Next time I would cut the butter even more. I used the lemon cake recipe from this site and it turned out to be the best combinations! My family (old and young) loved the tangy frosting and moist cake. Would definitely make this again!

Love this recipe. I did make some changes....used  a vegetable base cream cheese substitute since my wife is lactose intolerant. I too figured that the sugar content had to be a mistake, so I used 1 14 cups of powdered sugar, added an additional 1/4 cup of butter to make the texture more silky. This turned out great for me.

I added another splash (and it was a pretty big splash) of lemon juice and it was perfect. I paired it with a Betty Crocker lemon cake mix and it was delicious. My little brother loved and said it was the perfect mix of sour and sweet and yummy!

I 1/2 the recipe and it was way too runny. Had to keep adding more cream cheese, butter and sugar. It was still too runny and we had twice as much as we needed. We used it, but I won’t make it again

Just made this frosting to cover my lemon bundt cake, turned out delicious and fluffy. I took suggestions of other reviewers, used 3 tbsp  of lemon juice and about 2 cups of sugar. Perfect tang, a lot of lemon flavor, delicious.

My only  substitution was using lemon extract  (1 Teas.) instead of lemon juice.  Excellent recipe. How can I make it thicker without adding more sugar? I used it on a layer cake and it kept oozing down the side??

So MAKE SURE YOU USE 5 OUNCES of confectioners'  sugar. I put 2 cups in and had to add much more lemon juice. I was doing a half recipe. I made this for a cake for my grandmother for looking after my 4-year-old brother. I think she liked it.

Delish!  I used just a bit extra of the fresh lemon juice and almost the full 5 cups of confectionary sugar for a perfect cake frosting.  I guess it depends on what consistency you're looking for that determines how much sugar to use.  I frosted a lemon cake that had a thin layer of raspberry jam in the middle as well as the frosting. I will use this recipe every time I need a lemon frosting.

I laugh when I read the comments about it being too sweet.  It's frosting!!

I only made half of this recipe because I needed only a little frosting for what i was making. I think it turned out wonderfully. I did not measure the powdered sugar, i just mixed the first few ingredients together and added powdered sugar until I was happy with the consistency. It tasted great! I love all things cream cheese and loved this recipe, it's definitely a keeper.

Easy and delicious. I used a couple True Lemon packets instead of a fresh lemon to save money and it turned out lucious! I just added the powdered sugar until it was the consistency I wanted. Most bakers control that themselves anyway, so the typo is nothing really.

Delicious! Delicious! Delicious! I have made this frosting numerous times and continue to get requests for cakes using it again and again! I use it on a regular white cake and it is to die for based on the feedback! I use McCormick Gourmet California Lemon Peel and it gives it just a bit of twang with a whole lot of deliciousness combined!! Making some adjustments on the amount of confectioners sugar is a taste preference but it should not make it any less delicious....did I mention this icing is delicious ??? Thank you for sharing it!!!

I switched recipe to make orange frosting, using the same amounts except 1 tsp of orange extract and added dried orange peel. Also used neufchâtel cheese for less fat. Turned out fine. Could probably do the same for any other flavor desired.

Good flavor but way to much sugar. Cut the sugar to 2 cups, leaving the frosting a bit loose. As this was being piped across the top of a lemon berry bundt cake I was not concerned about drips. In the future I would add another block of cream cheese.

If you cut the sugar down to 5 oz, this is a perfect Meyer lemon cream cheese frosting.  I served at a baby shower & the guests loved it.

Made as directed, although I added the confectioners sugar a half cup at a time and stopped at one cup.  My daughter and I thought it was too sweet with just a cup of sugar and added another third cup of cream cheese with an additional tablespoon of lemon juice to balance to our taste buds.

Just what I was craving!  I ended up using 4 cups of powdered sugar and replaced the vanilla with lemon juice.  Perfect!
Made this a 2nd time:  just used 2 cups of sugar.  was just fine - more cream cheese flavor.

Super easy to make - the recipe directions were clear and straightforward.  The frosting came out deliciously smooth and creamy - not too sweet - just the right amount of lemon.  I think the recipe is perfect as is.  Will definitely make this again.

Delicious recipe. But I certainly did not use 5 cups of confectioners sugar. I used only 1 cup! There was enough frosting to frost a 9x12 cake.

I started out making this recipe and tasted it after I added each 1/2 cup of sugar. After three cups all you could taste was sugar, so I added another couple ounces of cream cheese and another tablespoon or so of fresh squeezed meyer lemon juice and it turned out delicious. But it only held its shape for a few minutes at room temp.  I'm sure the extra  sugar would have helped with the looks, but I'd rather have the flavor. I suggest tasting as you go :-)

This frosting is delicious! I did make a few small changes. I omitted the zest, added an additional tablespoon of lemon juice and only used 2 cups of powdered sugar instead of 5. The lemon flavor is subtle and delicious on strawberry cupcakes!

I made this frosting for lemon cupcakes filled with a fresh raspberry crème filling. Everyone at work just raved over the cupcakes saying that they were the best cupcakes they ever tasted! The frosting got rave reviews and many many compliments. Made the frosting almost exactly as recipe directed.

I made it exactly like the recipe called for except I cut the  sugar back to about 1-1/4 cups like another reviewer suggested and I sprinkled more lemon zest on top of frosted cake for color. I used this frosting on lemon cakes and everyone is always asking me to make this. They are perfect together.

This was a  perfect frosting for a summer cake. I made a vanilla cake with a raspberry filling. The lemon frosting made the flavors pop. I did use a tad bit more sugar, then it called for in the recipe. It spread perfectly. This was a total hit for a birthday partyI threw.  Tammy

The flavor of this frosting was great (although I did use less sugar than the recipe called for) but I had trouble with the consistency.  It was too thin. The frosting between the layers slowly squished out the sides...and applying to the sides was tricky, at best.  Perhaps it was thin because I only used 2 cups of confectioners sugar instead of 5 as the recipe called for.  My fault then!  I felt that 5 cups would have been way to sweet for our family.

I didn't make any changes. It was delicious on a lemon cake I made.  I added the icing sugar to make the consistency for frosting a two layer 8" cake.  Then I sprinkled yellow sugar on top. Nothing fancy, but everyone enjoyed the flavor combination.

I went with a reviewers suggestions, which was that the recipes should have had 5 ounces of frosting, but that only resulted in two cups of frosting--not enough to frost a cake with two eight inch layers.  I ended up adding more butter (since I was out of cream cheese) and more sugar, and by the time I had enough frosting, I could hardly taste the cream cheese. Disappointing.

The taste is absolutely amazing but I had a problem with trying to get it thick enough to hold its place. It did slide around a bit, but the taste sooo made up for that! And just as everyone else said; adding a bit of lemon juice might help.

People are all over the map with the amount of sugar; and I must say for our preference it is way too much. We really like a strong cream cheese flavour, and I like this recipe because it calls for lemon which really seals the deal!  I wonder if people who are having issues with consistency are using light or spreadable cream cheese?  I used 2 blocks of regular cream cheese, softened on a low setting in the mic, then eyeballed and tasted as I added the sugar, but likely used about 2 cups. Consistency was great, could have piped but just spread on with a knife.  On carrot cake (Uncle Sam's from this website, also very versatile in terms of ingredients).  Absolutely delish!!

this was delicious! i think the key is to taste test it as you go, I added a bit less icing sugar and more cream cheese & lemon and zest than called for, and only a couple drops of vanilla, and really it was AMAZING! i cut the recipe in half and it was perfect to ice the top of a decent sized (lemon) birthday cake - my fam loved it! :-)

I rated it a 4 but would have rated it a 5 if it called for less sugar. I only used 1 cup of powdered sugar as someone else suggested. I made this with the 5 ounces (about 1 cup) and it was perfect. I loved the bright flavor. I used this on a lemon poppy seed cake and it was perfect! Thanks for the recipe!

The consistency probably would've been perfect if I had used the 5 cups, perhaps 4.5.  I ran out of powdered sugar and iced my bottom layer and had to go out for more because 3.5 cups was not enough to make it thick enough.  Delicious tasting.  I used the yellow cake recipe from an old Betty Crocker cookbook and added lemon zest and juice per their directions.  My cake cooked too long and I ended up using a simple syrup with raspberry jam over my leveled off sides to moisten it.  One of my better cakes I believe and everyone liked it.

It may have been my mistake but I added 1/2 cup butter instead of 1/4 in error.  I also forgot the vanilla and used only 1 Tab lemon juice.  I loved the taste it was wonderful BUT I totally could not pipe it - it seemed more like a thick glaze.  I put it in the refrigerator for a while thinking that would make it get stiffer but it didn't.  I saved the rest to use as a glaze for a lemon Bundt cake but for a frosting I pass.

What a great, flavorful frosting.  Made it as is but used all the juice and zest from the lemon.  I used 5 cups of confectioner's sugar, it became a tad stiff so I added some whipping cream to make it more speadable.  Just a delectable lemon flavor.

It was really a good frosting, great lemon flavor but it was more like a glaze than a frosting. At first I thought that maybe my kitchen was too hot, but the frosting was still thin and I ran out of powdered sugar. I gave it three stars because the flavor was there. Next time, I will add more sugar.

I doubled the recipe and only used 1.5 cups sugar - and even that was too sweet. It could be just fine with 1 cup. I did add a bit more lemon juice to balance out the sugar and it came out pretty good.

5 cups of sugar is just too much, I made this exactly following the recipe and it didn´t work out so well. At the third cup of sugar it seemed fine but when added the other two it got all stiff and pretty much impossible to work on a cake or cup cake.

Good recipe.  I used TWO 8oz bars of cream cheese instead of one, and I also added a little extra butter (didn't have unsalted so I used margarine instead and it turned out fine...a little thinner than butter, but just barely).  I barely made it to 5 cups of sugar (was more like 4.5) and it was very sweet...even after doubling the cream cheese and butter.  I could've added some whipped cream to tone down the sweetness but I got lazy.  This was more than enough to frost a double layer cake with a layer in between.

Made it pretty close to written, only used 4.5 cups sugar. Most frosting recipes I use have at least 3 to 3.5 cups of powdered sugar anyway. And you have to remember that 1 cup of powdered sugar is equal to about 1/2 cup of granulated, so the difference is not as significant. The extra sugar in this recipe makes it a bit sturdier so I felt that was the point of it anyway.

I took the advise of others and reduced the sugar. I ended up using a little over 2 cups. I say start out with 1.5 cups and go from there until you get the right amount to your liking. I found a little over 2 cups to be perfect for my tastes. The texture was perfect. I'll definitely be saving this for future usage.

A little to thick to pipe, I added a tiny bit of water as  to the texture I needed. I also added a little bit of lemon extract. Everyone liked it at the church. I also added one toothpick of hello to dye frosting a very light yellow.

This is a great recipe; however, I used only about 2 1/2 cups of sugar, and it turned out very good. The frosting was very spreadable. I also added some lemon extract to up the lemon flavor.

This turned out really nice and fluffy. I used two cups of sugar of it was enough and added a little more lemon juice and rind. The key is the use myer lemons which gives it a nice fragrance which helps to decrease the amount of acidity. I used it on a carrot cake recipe.

This is excellent frosting!!! The people who  say use 1 1/2 cups of sugar are obviously doing something wrong. (try beating the icing longer than 1 or 2 minutes, that will do wonders).   I will be making this frosting a lot..  this will be great on chocolate cupcakes.

Wonderful!  I made this exactly as it was written, and it was perfect.  The frosting is really, really gorgeous with tiny bright flecks of zest and a beautiful almost-lemony color.  I didn't think five cups was too much sugar.  I might actually have added a bit more myself as I fine-tuned the consistency.  I used this to frost a layer cake -- I made the Easy White Cake recipe from this site (adding some lemon zest), baked two layers, and spread both this frosting and a thin layer of jarred lemon curd between the two layers.  Frosted the sides and tops of the cake generously.  A perfect birthday cake for a lemon-lover.

I'll start out by saying that this frosting has a wonderful flavor- but- it is entirely too runny to work with if you're trying to pipe with it or even use a pastry tube to decorate cupcakes. I had to use so much sugar to get to even an acceptable consistency. I would recommend this frosting if you just want a simple (non-decorative) frosting, otherwise- look for something thicker.

Very sweet and tangy! I used a bit under 2 cups of powdered sugar. You don't need any more than that. The frosting looked watery, but was actually perfect spreading consistency. Make sure you use fresh lemon juice!

I made this frosting for some lemon vanilla cupcakes and I honestly think they were the best cupcakes I've ever made.   I don't think I used quite 5 cups of sugar, but I didn't measure, just kept adding more until it was the creamy thickness I wanted. It was excellent though. Thank you!!

Beyond good.  We were eating this right from the bowl.  This would be good on so many things.  I used them on the Golden Cakes that I made yesterday.  I had planned on only making 1/2 batch, but ended up making the entire thing and I am so glad that I did.  Now I just have to find some more recipes to use this to top.  Will definitely be a well used recipe in this house.  Thanks!

This is the ONLY lemon frosting I will ever make again.  So simple, so easy, so absolutely perfect.  Even if you have to add more sugar on those hot and humid summer days, this frosting is superb!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This frosting was incredible!  However, I only used 2 cups of powdered sugar instead of 5 suggested because I liked the taste at 2 cups.  Still had a nice lemon flavor and wasn't too sweet/sugary.  It was still spreadable and very smooth and creamy.  Definitely will use this recipe again.

Great flavor with the right amount of tang!  I added 2 more tsp. of lemon zest and it was great.  I did not use as much sugar, just as much until in was creamy. Definitely will use again!

this was the first frosting i've ever made and i thought it turned out great and was so much easier than i had imagined. i read the comments about only using a fourth of the sugar- i probably used about 3 cups, but only had half the cream cheese on hand. i think the increased sugar just helps to cut all the buttery taste and doesn't necessarily make it super sweet- so i would definitely lean towards more than less.

Excellent. I used two cups of powered sugar and whipped it with my Kitchen Aid - very light and fluffy. I used it to frost a chocolate cake from this site and it brought a little tang but not too too much lemon taste.

Loved this! Just finished icing some basic butter recipe cupcakes and it really made the cupcakes. Once the butter, cream cheese, zest, and extract were blended, I played with the lemon juice and powdered sugar. I think I ended up putting in three tablespoons. I eyeballed the powdered sugar to get the consistency I wanted... and the end result was delicious. I couldn't stop licking the spoon :)

I needed another frosting recipe besides buttercream and fondant and this one caught my eye as an easy to make, tasty finish to a white cake with lemon filling I was asked to make for a friend. WOW! the sample cake I made for my family was a hit and this frosting was the perfect fit for the cake. I did hold back a little on the sugar as I didn't want it too sweet. Thanks.

Fabulous! I had to add more lemon juice (I like a stronger lemon flavor - 4 TBSP lemon juice, 2 1/2 tsp zest, no vanilla) and it was absolutely wonderful - the tartness of the lemon is a great compliment to the cream cheese, and cream cheese icing is always preferred over any other type.

Oh. My. Gosh.  This frosting recipe is TOO GOOD!  I only used 4 cups of confectioners sugar, which made the frosting perfectly sweet.  I added more fresh lemon juice (about 2 tbsp more) as I like extra-lemon-y frosting.  The extra juice made the frosting a tad thinner than what the pictures looked like, which is probably why I ended up with so much frosting left over!  I made 15 cupcakes to frost, and still had at least half of the frosting left over!  This frosting is absolutely wonderful and I will never give up this recipe!!!

This is an outstanding and relatively easy recipe.  I sifted the sugar to create a smoother consistency.  I also added orange zest, which was a nice addition.

I go with 1/2 cup butter with one 8 oz package of cream cheese - both softened and then beaten together before adding other ingredients.  Also can use orange zest and orange juice or concentrate instead of lemon - orange flavor is GREAT on pumpkin muffins (makes them like cupcakes) or pumpkin cookies.  My son's birthday is right before Halloween and the kids at school loved the orange colored treat (I added a bit of orange food coloring).

This frosting was so yummy. I added another tsp of lemon juice, and I followed others advice and used only 3 cups of powdered sugar. I refrigerated it while the cake finished cooling and it was perfect, not at all runny. This with definitely become a favorite.

Too thin. Too sweet. I should have stopped when I was at 2 cups of icing sugar and a few drops of lemon and orange essential oils. That was perfect. The consistency was ok until I added about 1 tsp of lemon juice. Then it all got disappointing. But the only reason I did use the lemon juice is because it was too sweet.

This has way too much sugar as written. I only used 2 cups and it was plenty. Apart from the excess sugar the icing was very nice. It went well with the banana cake I made.

I was a little disappointed in this recipe- the texture was a little too runny. I expected it to be more fluffy for frosting a cake.  I frosted a birthday cake and much of it ran down the sides to the bottom of the cake plate.I had to quickly refrigerate it to try to set it.  I couldn't add any more powdered sugar to thicken it  as I had already added the 5 cups and it was overly sweet.   The flavor was  good, although a little too much on the sweet side. My mother's birthday cake was not the best it could have been!

Amazing frosting!  Just great on the lemon cream cupcakes (also on this site)...however, I did follow prior advise and used only 4 cups of sugar instead of the 5 & the frosting was just perfect.

I really enjoyed this frosting on my lemon cake. I didn't have lemon zest, for the frosting so I substituted with lemon extract. It was pretty good. Next time I will definitely do it with the zest.

Spring time always makes me want something lemon! This was very good on our boxed lemon cake mix! I did not add that much sugar. My boy friend's kids love to help me cook and they enjoyed making this and eating it too! We dyed coconut pink and sprinkled it on top for a special touch! Nice idea for Easter cake.

I get rave reviews every time I make this icing, it's simple yet oh so tasty.  I love the fact that it's not too sweet or heavy.  It actually refreshes the palate.

I didn't like it.  I was sure I would, since it got such wonderful reviews and since I love lemon desserts and also cream cheese frosting.  But I didn't like the taste.  It was easy, and the consistency was fine.

Delicious recipe.  I coupled this tangy frosting with the Lemon Cake Filling and it was a perfect almost spring treat!  The only thing I did differently was to add less sugar-- I think it ended up being only 3 cups.  Great!  Thanks.

I loved the flavor but I would not call this frosting; is is more of a glaze. I could not get this to set no matter how long I left it in the fridge or how much powdered sugar I added. Since I was trying to frost a two-layer cake I was less than pleased. I don't know how some reviewers got away with more lemon juice and less sugar.
