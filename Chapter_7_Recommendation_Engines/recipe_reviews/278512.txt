What a back saver!  I used veggie broth and it turned out GREAT.   More risotto, no more standing and stirring.

Great base recipe!  It is great as is,  with lots of room for personal additions such as seasonal vegetables, mushrooms or whatever comes to mind.  I do however use chicken broth instead of the bouillon and water as I always have broth in the freezer or pantry.  Thank you!
