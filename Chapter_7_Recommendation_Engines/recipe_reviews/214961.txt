Simply delicious! I love grilled peaches and this recipe was the perfect ending to great BBQ meal. Don't let the ease of prep and simplicity fool you, this is one elegant little dessert! My husband devoured his and when he asked what was in it as did my neighbors, he looked up and said with big eyes "Did I hear you say goat"? You just gotta love him! Thanks again FTFF for another great recipe! (and a good laugh)

This was wonderful!  Don't let the simplicity of the recipe fool you.  It is elegant and unique.  I made it as an alternative dessert for people with food allergies.  Everyone wanted this instead of the more traditional choice of cake.  I wish I'd made more.

Very easy to make and delicious. I would possibly suggest having extra mint because it adds a really great flavor. I will make this again!

This was AWSOME!!! Didn't have any mint leaves, but because I knew it was supposed to have it, I really missed not having them. It would have totaly completed it. The goat cheese that I used was soft enough to not need to add milk. Yummy Yummy Yummy!

I used a honey liqueur, so did not add the milk since it was more liquidy already. Yum!

Be sure to buy freestone peaches. I had clingstone and was unable to cleanly remove the pit.. So I chopped the peaches, skipped the grilling step, added berries and used this recipe as a delicious topping for my fruit bowl.

Words can not desribe how incredible this tastes. Upon first bite I wept that I've been on this planet lo these many years and hadn't had this dish. I also wept with relief that I was able to taste it before the end of my days. Oh, and you can knock off the skim milk and the mint leaves. Peaches. Goat Cheese. Honey. I swear I hear angels right now . . .

Yum!! I prefer feta over chevre so that is what I used and it was wonderful!! Next time I make these will use half honey with half Jack Daniels Tennessee Honey to ratchet up the flavor ;-)

I will definitely make these again. They were quite simple but so delicious and creamy. Next time, I might use donut peaches and stuff the hole with cheese

This was a pretty good recipe. I liked the grilled peaches, coupled with the taste of the goat cheese & honey. My family, however, preferred whipped cream instead, lol. Thanks for sharing! I'll make this again for sure :)
