Loved the idea of the plums and bananas as I had both! I did make several changes though: 2 cups flour, 3/4 cup whole wheat flower 2 tsp vanilla Brown sugar instead of white 3/4tsp salt nutmeg and cinammon handful of blueberries (toatally unnecessary just had them) It was really really delicious andlasted only a couple of hours in my house. You could add more sugar if you like sweeter things but we loved it this way!

Tastes great! Perfectly moist and very yummy! We were just given about 10lbs of plums and I had to find something to do with them :) I doubled the recipe and we've had it for breakfast and snacks for 3 days and some is in the freezer! The kids loved it and so did my husband, and he doesnt usually like fruit breads. I followed the recipe exactly. The only thing I may do next time is add some nuts if i have them on hand, but the recipe is perfect without them.

this should really be called banana plum cake since its in a cake pan. anyway. i took the advice of another reviewer and substituted brown for white sugar, 1/2 cup wheat for part of the white flour, and it was good. my husband liked it much better than i did but i used my plums and that was my objective. i cant quite put my finger on what id do differently next time but ill keep it in the recipe box!

Needs SALT! I used 1/2 tsp, also, as suggested by others, substituted brown sugar for white sugar and added nutmeg, cinnamon, and vanilla. I also included the juice from the fresh plums. Bread is not overly sweet, and turned out moist (in a good way). thumbs up from co-workers.

This is absolutely delicious! I have followed the recipe to the dot, well almost :) I added little cinamon and little vanilla sugar just to give the plums little twist since they react well with both. And it was a treat! It went down so well, my fiance left me only two slices! I will have to bake it again

My husband liked it, but I was a little disappointed.  It was pretty dense and a little dry, especially compared to the banana bars I make.  Next time I need to use up plums, I may just add them to my own recipe.

My family really liked this bread with a tad bit of tartness.  After reading the reviews, and respecting mis7up, as a fellow buzzer, I took her advice and added a little extra sugar.  I added an additional 1/4 cup, making my total 3/4 cup.  Butter (all I use) was used in place of margarine.  I decided to bake in 5 mini (6x3 1/2) loaf pans rather than a 13x9 pan. They rose beautifully and were done at the 35 minute mark.  I served this bread with 'Christmas Morning Egg Casserole' from AR.  As with all quick breads, my family enjoys them as bread, but our favorite way to eat them is toasted.  It seems to really make the flavors pop, and it did so with this recipe.  I would definitely make this recipe again.

Love it!
Some additions were made: increased brown sugar by 1 more cup, 1/2 tsp salt and added one more cup of plums.  Everybody raved about it, this is my 2nd time baking it, very simple, fast and the dish comes out clean in no time. :D

The bread to seem turned out well. It was slightly thick but not sweet at all. Could go up on the sugar just a tad. My fruit was very sweet and before I baked the batch of bread, however tasted a tad tart with the overall banana bread. I think The fruit needed to be minced a bit smaller or even pureed. Hubby and son weren't much of a fan but 2 of my children were. Totally needs some tweaking. If plum/pluot fruit left out, is a good banana bread on it's own, however needs to be sweeter.

I followed it as closely as possible.  (I don't have measuring devices and have to eyeball everything.  I also used "all" of my plums which I figure probably came out closer to 2 cups.)  I found it to be a bit tart and needed extra time to bake, but that was probably because of the extra plum.  I added some extra sugar to the second half of the batter. (I only have a toaster oven.)  I'll probably try this again later on.  Tart isn't necessarily bad, just not what I was going for.
