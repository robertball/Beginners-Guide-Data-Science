After intending to follow the recipe exactly, I had to make some changes. First, after seeing the other cook's review, I tried making the bars in a jelly roll pan instead of a cake pan. I baked the crust for about six minutes, and the whole thing for about seven minutes. The topping gets big bubbles on top, which is the way its supposed to cook. They turned out flat, but the top was chewy and and bottom flaky.  Be sure to use *real butter* or they won't turn out right. I didn't use coffee as they are for my husband, who doesn't like coffee. I also forgot vanilla and didn't put the nuts on til after the bars cooked. Be sure to use sea salt as it doesn't dissolve on the hot bars. I will definitely make them again and try the cake pan just to see if that makes a difference. Oh, and the crust is not supposed to be done after the first baking. It finishes baking with the topping, which also helps the topping absorb somewhat and become chewy.

I was so excited to try this recipe, but I'm afraid it was a complete disaster. The cookie crust was too thick--I baked it nearly twice as long as the recipe directed and it was still not done in the center. And then the toffee topping was just a bunch of drippy goo.

It didn't taste too bad, but the consistency of both layers made it inedible.

I followed the instructions exactly, but I must have done something wrong.

The turnout on these bars was fabulous!  I used kosher salt (less of it) instead of sea salt and it still tasted great.  The only thing I had to adjust was the cooking time after the topping was put on.  I had to cook it for about 25 minutes or so, to get the caramel colour from the condensed milk.  I adjusted the oven temperature to 325 after 12 minutes so the bottom crust didn't get too brown and everything turned out beautifully!  Very easy and very yummy square!!!!

These were fantastic!  However, the recipe calls for way too much salt.  Just sprinkle a wee bit over the top, if any at all.  Also, I put the nuts on top for a better presentation.
