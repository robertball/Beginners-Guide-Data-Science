Wonderful shake - easy to make and perfect for a sweet treat! I used vanilla yogurt and like others, I froze my banana so there was no need to add any ice. This was really refreshing and tasted great!

I would have to agree with CC that I prefer to use all fresh fruit in my shakes and smoothies (and I would actually call this one a smoothie), but my kids wanted a strawberry smoothie and we didn't have any strawberries.  This recipe is great just for that reason, and my kids loved it.

I tripled this recipe but only used a half cup of jam. I used my own freezer jam and frozen bananas which eliminated the need for ice cubes.
This was good, but I think I like it better with frozen or fresh berries. It was good in the way that we're broke and have to use on hand ingredients for our smoothie fix.

Normally, I would not pick a recipe that uses jam over fresh berries, but it just so happened that I had some less than stellar tasting strawberries to use up, so this recipe was perfect. I just used less jam than called for and tossed in the berries. I also used a frozen banana instead of ice cubes as ice waters a smoothie down. The only thing this needs is vanilla yogurt instead of plain, for best flavor.

It's good. Next time I will add frozen strawberries with the preserves. I tasted more banana than the strawberries.

This is really good, I had no ice cubes but is was no problem because my banana was frozen to make my drink both cool and thick. Yum.

I love how versatile this recipe is when it comes to fresh strawberries or preserves and fresh or frozen bananas.  Makes a very delicious treat.

This recipe was not to my liking. I could tell by the ingredients that this was not a "shake" but a smoothie. Although, I wanted something healthier so I decided to try it. However, this strangely had no taste except maybe melted plain yogurt. Although, it has nothing to do with my rating, the calorie count is also way off. There was also easily 2 servings. The only change I made was subbing strawberry sauce for strawberry jam. That should have mainly affected the thickness only. I might try to dr. this up tommorrow, somehow to give it some much needed flavor besides yogurt, with some additional frozen fruit, honey, or another sweetener.

Absolutely wonderful and very easy!  My little girls love it as well.  I think it's great that the preserves sweeten and flavor it.  You could really use other kinds of preserves with this.  I also like that it makes one at a time.

We thought this tasted more like a smoothie than a shake.
