What a find!  I'm glad to be the first reviewer of this recipe so that I can bring this now formally initiated recipe to your attention with my 5-star review! I don't generally like teeny cookies but these are SERIOUSLY adorable.  The dough is easy to work with and the cookies come out of the oven perfectly round with those cute little cracks we love in gingersnaps.  I prepared the recipe as is, save for adding a quarter teaspoon of salt to heighten flavor, and I'm not even so sure that made a noticeable difference. I also used the more traditional method of creaming the sugar and shortening, adding the egg and molasses, then adding ALL of the combined dry ingredients.  All brown sugar all but guarantees these will be as soft as their name says they will be, and the spice is just right.  They're not just good, they're "D" good. No wonder the submitter's friends ask her for this recipe!

When I made these cookies, I beat together the shortening and the sugar together until fluffy, then beat in the eggs and molasses and added the dry ingredients. I did add a half teaspoon of salt when I added the dry ingredients. I LOVED that this dough was ready to go, it did not need to be chilled at all, probably due to the recipe using shortening. My cookies were done at just over nine minutes. I pulled them off the sheet to cool on the countertop and they turned out absolutely perfect.....like bakery spice cookies!

I think these may now be my favorite cookies...they are sooo good!!  They came out lightly crispy on the ousite, soft and chewy on the inside. They had such a good flavor and easy to make. I used real butter instead of shortening, which I softened first, and added 1/4 tsp. of salt along with an extra pinch or two of cinnamon, cloves, and ginger. Delicious!!

This recipe is really delicious! I would suggest adding 1/4 tsp of salt to bring out the flavours a little bit more, and make sure you flatten the cookies well before baking as they keep their ball shape otherwise. Definitely a keeper!

I am the original submitter of this recipe. I just noticed that the ingredient list only says 3/4 cup shortening. It should say 3/4 shortening or cooking oil. I always use oil when making this recipe, so you may want to try that if you have problems with them being too dry.

These have a great flavor, and they spread out from balls perfectly (I don't know why the other reviewer's would have stayed as balls). The only issue I had, which really isn't an issue, is that they weren't soft. They came out nice and pillowy from the oven, but they flattened out as they cooled. By the time they were room temperature, they weren't *hard* but they were still far from soft. But, like I said, they had a good flavor, and I would make these again.

The cookies turned out soft, but way too sweet! Next time I'll put in half as much sugar as indicated.

The only thing I changed was to use 1/2 cup butter and 1/4 cup shortening, but I left the rest of the recipe the same.  These cookies are wonderful!!  I baked them for 8 minutes and they came out perfect.  Just barely crunchy on the edges and soft on the inside.  The spice ratio was dead on too.  I used my cookie scoop and droped the balls into the sugar to coat then put them on parchment paper.  They flattened out just enough.  I got exactly 3 dozen cookies.

Brilliant!  I took these to my work's Christmas party and got rave reviews.  I didn't have ground cloves, so I used nutmeg instead.  I've made this recipe twice now and it's definitely a keeper!

I just took a batch out of the oven and they are great. I did make two changes. I raised the ginger to 1 tablespoon and added 3 heaping tablespoons of baking cocoa. They are almost perfectly round, soft all the way through and nice and cracked on top. Perfect.

This is the soft gingersnap recipe you’ve been looking for all these years. The only thing I did different was I swapped out half the shortening for butter.

I used vegetable oil instead of shortening and rolled them in sugar before baking. They came out flavorful and soft in the middle. Yum!!

These are great. The ones in the picture are darker than mine but they are fantastic anyways. I put ginger chunks in mine to add even more flavour.

I've made another version on here of gingerbread cookies and they were good, but not THIS good. 
I didn't have shortening so I used 3/4 cup of softened butter instead. I also added 2 tbs of granulated  sugar along with a little less than a forth of cake flour on top of the 2 cups of all purpose. THe dough was super runny but I just decided to put it in the oven anyway and hope for the best.  They came out perfectly ! Soft and chewy with a little crust around the edges too. I put them in for about 16 minutes as well. SO good and I will definitely make again. Boyfriend said they great and he ate 5. His friends liked them as well.  I'm super picky about my ginger bread and this was just too good. Thanks!!

Made this w/adjustments of honey instead of sugar (half amount sugar called for), little extra molasses, and powdered eggs. Worked wonderfully. 

Also made with nutmeg replacing ginger, as I ran out of ginger. Wonderful tasting Christmas cookies! Great w/eggnog.

Loved this easy recipe! I didn't have shortening on hand, so I used 1:1 butter. I also used semi-heaping scoops of spices (and additional 1/4tsp of nutmeg - it's the Italian secret spice for everything!) for a more flavorful cookie. After an hour chilling in the fridge and 12 minutes exactly at 350F, these little goodies turned out incredible. 

This is a bit obvious with using butter versus shortening, but the cookies spread slightly rather than the pillowly bites pictures. The result was still incredibly tasty!

Helpful Note to Self: Combine wet ingredients as usual before adding dry ingredients. The creamed butter/sugar mixture  first makes for a better cookie. The original avenue required an extra egg to get the usual end product.

Hubby loved them.  I did bake them for 12 minutes, give the outside a bit of a crunch and still soft in the middle.  Two thumbs up from the husbands.  :)

The key to making these cookies come out the way they look in the picture and not flat discs is to use less butter (I use butter, not shortening).  I used two tablespoons less than the recipe calls for and they came out perfectly.  These are delicious!

I just made these and OMGosh!!  They are amazing!  Soft, wonderfully flavorful, delicious!!  I followed some of the other reviews and creamed my shortening and sugar, then added the molasses and egg followed by all the dry ingredients.  Didn't change any of the measurements and they came out perfect!  This recipe is a keeper!!!

Love, Love, these cookies.  Super easy and they turned out perfectly.  I made six batches of these for Christmas.  The only thing I did different was add a pinch of salt to enhance the flavor.

I don't write reviews as a rule because it's really so subjective but  Ginger cookies are my husbands favorite and I decided to try this recipe because my tried and true one involves melting butter, mixing with molasses and getting it to room temp. Lot of work and I didn't have the time.  These were wonderful!  my only changes were bumping the ginger to 1 1/2 teas, just a pinch of clove, and  a dash of salt as others have said.  They were perfect and made the kitchen smell real old school and cozy.  If your oven temp is true, you bake at the low end of the range (8 mins), use parchment paper, and measure correctly, it should not be crumbly dough or be crispy throughout after baking. I'd check things out, measure exactly and try again.  I believe they are worth it!

They are not soft, the dough is like graham cracker crumbs so you can't even form balls to bake. Not impressed and neither is my 3 year old who had the patience to make them with me.

My husband loved them.  I also added a pinch of salt after reading a lot of reviews.  I used butter not shortening.  If you have health issues like myself, I would never use shortening in anything.  Beat the butter (or shortening) with the sugar's until fluffy, then beat in the eggs and molasses.  I cook and bake often and the thing that did get me a little confused is how they separated the flour and why?  I will make these again.  Wish I knew how to post a picture, but they look just like the recipe picture shows.  Soft and yummy cookies.  Just an additional comment here--I see they want to know if you tweaked the recipe at all and want you to pay a membership to tell them what you did.  Hmmmm,  seems to me if a person tweak's it to make it better why would a person want to pay to share it.

Best. Cookie. Ever. I made the recipe as written except left out the cloves. The cookies stayed soft and chewy, and spread out just fine without flattening the balls at all. I did chill the dough for 30 minutes to make it easier to handle. I will make these over and over and over again.

These were wonderful! I made them exactly as instructed and they came out really well. The only recommendation I would make is to make sure the molasses is well mixed into the other ingredients. I had a few where the molasses had clumped a little and spilled out of the cookie, which then burned to the cookie sheet. But it only happened to two out of the 3 dozen...not bad. I used my electric mixer, which made this a super easy recipe. The dough was really easy to work with, and the final result was deliciously spiced for a Christmas cookie!

I made these cookies last night and they didn't spread out and they were very dry.  So disappointed.

my family loved these cookies!  I did add 1/4 tsp salt. I also used butter flavored Crisco shortening.  I've already shared the recipe with my sister!

I was skeptical about this recipe. It's not my usual go to (no butter). I was worried that they would be dry as the mix was very crumbly. But they turned out delicious. I did keep them in for the full 10 minutes as I made them a bit bigger by mistake. After 8 minutes they hadn't flattened and I thought I'd be throwing them away, but the 2extra. Invites did the job. Spices/ sweetness combination is perfect.

Excellent! I will use this as my go to for ginger snaps. I found they were crispy on the outer edges but soft in the middle. Everyone what tried them loved them.

I substituted butter/margarine for shortening. They were delicious and soft. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

These cookies are amazing. I did add a little salt and vanilla. To me every cookie recipe should have vanilla. It just enhances the flavor. It's a lot easier if you cream the butter than add the sugar, egg, molasses than the dry ingredients than the way the recipe says to do it. These cookies are so soft. Just delicious. I'm giving it 5 stars.

Delicious cookies! I've made these for a Christmas party and my grandchildren and they were a big hit. I mixed together the ingredients a little differently however. I creamed together the brown sugar and shortening first, then added the molasses and egg. Finally, I mixed the dry ingredients in another bowl and then added them to the wet mixture and blended together. The dough is easy to handle, not sticky! The only problem is you'll want to eat too many!

It made perfect ginger snaps! I'm terrible at making cookies properly the first try and I managed to make these. 

I made some minor adjustments for my family`s taste by not using cloves and using all spice and I used an additional tsp of cinnamon. If you like soft gingerbread men like my little ones do, you can roll the dough and cut it with ease.  

I made 36 ginger snaps and 12 small gingerbread men with this. The serving size is a bit off, just the ginger snaps at the recommended rolling size would have easily made 48+.
