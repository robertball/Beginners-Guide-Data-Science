Made this recipe right after Christmas and it was amazing! The champagne heavy cream sauce is to die for. Followed the recipe exactly and was very easy to make. Will be making for my sweetheart on Valentine's Day this weekend.

Oh my God, this 100% goes on my list of the best things I've ever eaten.  We added 2 cloves of garlic. I have no words. You could put that sauce on a SHOE and it would taste delicious.

I made this for the first time on Christmas Eve for something entirely different.  I purchased a few pounds of lobster tails (7-8), 6-8 oz size which were about $5.99 a piece.  I cooked with with an inexpensive brut champagne that I love.  It was a big hit and extremely easy.  The cook time for the tails was accurate as I left the meat in the shell as they cooked.  I used half and half which makes a sauce which isn't as thick.  I served them with crab cakes, steamed broccoli and a salad.

I made a “test lobster” because I’ve never made lobster before. It was delicious!! I can’t wait to serve it to my guests on New Year’s Eve. I cooked it in the shell. It is hard to make pretty once cooked. If I cook it after I butterfly it, will I have to adjust anything?

The champagne sauce brought the lobster to another level!   I was nervous that we wouldn’t like it so I had lemon and butter on the table just in case.   The champagne sauce was gobbled up even being used to dip out steaks in!!!  Definitely will be making this again!

This was delicious!! I made it last week for my husband's birthday and he loved it!  Paired it with two filet mignon steaks, made a little more sauce to also top the steaks and it was perfect.  The only thing is that I find there was not enough liquid originally with the lobsters...that could have been my fault using the wrong size pan. I added a little more to compensate.
