Loved the filling, but thought the phyllo dough was unauthentic.  So I got this recipe from an Indian friend...
2 cups of plain flour
¼ tsp salt
4 tbsp of oil/ghee
4 tbsp of water
 
Method for base
1. Mix all the ingredients for the base together with your fingers until it forms a dough.
   Add tiny bit more water if needed.
2. Knead the dough for about 10 minutes or until it is smooth. 
3. Put it in a plastic bag and set aside for 30 minutes or longer, in the refrigerator if possible.

Then I think you take a walnut-sized portion of dough, and then roll it out to about 4 inches across.  Put a couple of TB of filling in, fold dough over to make a semicircle, press seams together, roll edges over, and fry 'til golden.  Sorry for the long post, but hope it helps. =)

These are great, but I have two suggestions and a tip.

1) Use a green chile paste instead of fresh chiles.  You can find it at Indian/Pakistani markets.  Also known as green chile chutney.
2) Use samosa wrappers instead of filo dough if filo is too crumbly.  These are easier to work with and do not flake so easily when cooked.  Also found at Indian/Pakistani markets.

Tip) I used southern style hashbrowns instead of whole potatoes.  They are already boiled and cut up, so the boiling time is much less.  Basically you are just heating up the potatoes and the peas.  Then mash together like recommended.  (Southern Style is the one that is cubed, not shreaded.)

Excellent & yummy recipe, easy to make too!  I lived in India during part of my childhood and Indian food is my fave ... and this recipe meets full approval and tastes so authentic!  However, like almost all cooks in this website, I modified a few things.  I diced the potatoes into little pieces and boiled them with the peas - I did not mash them. I used more cumin seeds (love the flavour of cooked cumin seeds in Indian dishes), and added 2 - 3 tablespoons of lemon juice at the end of the cooking of the filling (after the potatoes and peas were added in) - this gives it a bit of tangy flavour (a lot of vegeterian samosa recipes call for lemon juice).  I did not use phyllo dough but ready-made thin flaky pie dough - it has a very nice puff when fried and it's a very tasty combination with the filling.  Egg-roll wrappers are not for samosas and do not do samosas justice for the taste, so pls don't use them !  If ever, it's better to make your own dough, though this can be more time consuming. 
Bravo and thanks again for this great recipe !

I love this recipe. The ground beef is what makes the samosa so delicious. Don’t let the long list of ingredients daunt you from making this; the meat mixture is pretty easy to make once you get everything together (helps if you measure out all the spices at least a day in advance). I like to put the beef in warmed tortillas and top it with a small sprinkling of grated cheese. Yum. As for the samosa, when I first made this, I baked the samosa in the oven at 400 degrees until the dough was golden (suggested by other reviewers). I also spread the dough with melted butter before popping the samosa into the oven. And I used spring roll wrappers. Since I try not to eat too many carbohydrates, I usually omit the potatoes when making the meat mixture. It tastes just as good, in my opinion.

I made these with ground chicken, a handful of raisins and without the cilantro and green chiles. They were absolutely wonderful! For a more healthy version, bake the pastries in the oven on 400 degrees until brown and crisp. I brushed the outsides with melted butter so that they would crisp nicely. I suspect that ground turkey would be just a nice to use as well. My friends and I had fun making then and eating them :) If you are out of garlic, a tablespoon of garlic powder works well too. Also, put in a teaspoon of garam masala for wonderful flavor and a nice aroma. The phyllo dough doesn't make them like genuine samosa, though. I suggest using wonton or eggroll wrappers to mimick the doughy and thick goodness of authentic samosas. My friends and I doubled the recipe and ate them as a meal until we were stuffed. They are quite good :) Also, if you have already browned meat, just cook the onions seperately and mix them all together. I think these would be awesome with left over turkey too!

Looking for something a lil' different for your next gathering...you have found it!! I LOVED THIS RECIPE, although I made a few minor adjustments.  Phyllo dough is a bit difficult to work with, so I bought the pre-made phyllo shells, they look like miniature puff pastry cups.  I filled each with the Samosa mixture, and instead of frying, I put them on a cookie sheet and baked them just until the tops got browned.

Now I won't have to go to an Indian restaurant just to eat one of my favorite appetizers.  These turned out really tasty.  I added some crushed, dried chile peppers in the filling for some more spice.  For the dough I used the recipe AuntWebbie posted (thanks!).  It was the perfect consistency and I was able to make the wrappers with no hassles.  The samosas taste better for me when the dough is thin, and there is a lot of filling.  Great recipe!

PS - Only one thing I had problems with.  From the recipe, it sounds like you're supposed to smash the peas with the potatoes, but I didn't smash the peas.  I think it tastes better this way.

I used vegetarian ground beef and wonton wrappers (which were just the right size). They came out great.

We loved this! I didn't have any phyllo nor any other wrappers, and I didn't feel like going to the store to buy some, but I had some tortillas in the fridge. It was great! I topped it with Cheddar and Mozzarella cheese and grilled it in the oven for 5 minutes to melt the cheese. After we each had one, we made 2 more, but topped each with some medium salsa. The combination of samosa filling with the salsa topping just made it a perfect meal. It was given a Yes, please make this again, so I will :)

Mmmmm...Mmmmmm...MMMMmm!  This recipe was so good I was eating out of the pot before I even wrapped the mixture in the phyllo!!  It's an exact replication of the samosas I ate at the Sunfest cultural festival in London, Ontario!  This will be a well-used recipe at my house.  Now, excuse me while I go feast!!!

I have made these many times .. been fiddeling with this recipe for over a year.. each time I was disappointed with not the way they tasted, but the way to wrap them ... I have tried phyllo dough, eggroll wrappers, and a few variations of dough. I have pan-fried them, baked them, and deep-fried them ... the best results came from using a dough (something like a pie crust dough, or a pierogie dough)(DO NOT USE PHYLLO. it does not work and is too flaky for this kind of thing . I have tried many times!! the samosa becomes LIMP as it's too heavy of a mixture.. 'real' samosa is like a dough/puffed thing anyways) ... and to DEEP-FRY them (don't pan fry or bake .. the results are mediocre) ... I follow the directions exact for the filling, but I don't mash the peas, and I also add 3 tbsp's lemon juice, and 1/2 tbsp green chili chutney... I make the filling a day or two ahead, just keep it in the fridge until I make the dough/wrap them ... I wrap about 15-20 of them, and freeze the other half of the filling for another time... 'paste' the edges of the dough well, with a flour/water mixture, lay on a floured baking tray to keep the bottoms from sticking, which causes holes in the dough, then they ooze apart when cooking. deep-fry at 180 degrees celcius for 6 minutes.

Very tasty. I skipped the beef and the samosas were still wonderful. I used the recipe for the filling from allrecipes and then used the moosewood cookbook recipe for the wrappers and dipping sauce. I also doubled the cumin. Wrappers: 2.5 cups of flour, 1 cup of yoghurt/buttermilk, 1/2 tsp salt. Roll pingpong ball size double balls into 5 inch circles and fill with mixture. Brush tops with oil and bake for 30 min in a 400 degree oven. Dipping sauce: 1/2 cup cider vinegar, 1/2 cup water, 1/2 tsp salt, 3 tbs brown sugar, 1 clove garlic (minced). Mix it in a saucepan and simmer for 10 minutes (volume will reduce). This was delicious. Thank you!

Very flavorful....was a big hit at a party I brought them to.  Its worth the assembly time.

Modifications:  Substituted potatoes with steamed cauliflower puree, filled wonton wrappers instead of using phyllo dough, and lightly brushed with butter and baked until brown (325 - 350).

ed!  In an effort to keep this low-carb, I substituted mashed cauliflower for the potatoes.  There was no noticeable flavor difference.  Also, instead of using phyllo dough I filled wonton wrappers, brushed them with a minimal amount of butter and baked at about 350 until browned.

Excellent recipe!  I have made this 3 times in as many weeks.  I did, however, change some things.  I used ground pork or turkey instead of beef. I added an extra potato and I used won ton wrappers instead of phyllo and I baked them at 425 for 25 minutes instead of deep frying them.  I was able to use all the wrappers by adding the extra potato.  They were perfect served with chutney or sweet & sour sauce.

This is by far the best samosa recipe I have found on line.  If someone gives it a bad rating it is only because they do not like Indian style spicy food. If you like spicy food you will love these. All my Pakistani friends rave when I make these.

Due to dietary constraints, I don't eat beef.  I substituted the beef for minced turkey and it worked really well.  I also doubled the amount of onions in this recipe and added a little chicken stock when I sauteed the turkey mince.  It did add more flavour to the samosa filling.   I am not particularly fond of shallow/deep frying food, so I placed the samosa filling onto puff pastry (making little triangular pouches with the pastry) and baked them.  It turned out really nice - light and flaky on the outside, moist and spicy on the inside.  I think the recipe posted here really works because of the perfect combination and proportion of spices used - so if you are going to use this recipe, try to stick to the combination/proportions listed.  Apart from that, I think you can modify it a little by using any type of minced meat/vegetable you desire. I wonder if this recipe would work with soy mince?

Like everyone else, I loved the taste of this recipe.  I have four teenagers, so I made a few changes...I mixed up the filling mixture except I used finely diced potatoes instead of mashed and I placed it all in a 9x13 pan and I placed cresent rolls on the top as a crust.  Kids said it was yummy!!!

Thanks for the tip on baking them instead of frying.  They are excellent!  I bought a mint chutney from an Indian store and mixed it with a little yoghurt and used it as a sauce.  It was an absolute hit at the party.  I gave this site address to oh so many people that night!

4 stars as written - 5 stars with my changes. 1.5 times the spices - as written I thought it was too bland. Instead of cumin seeds I just used ground cumin cause I didn't have the seeds. I halved this recipe and it still made a ton. I skipped out on the cilantro and green chile peppers because I didn't have them. I also didn't use phyllo dough but used a recipe for samosa dough and it turned out great!

I made the Samosas, and they're freakin' delicious! I used frozen hashbrowns to speed things up and then baked em in the oven at 400 for 15 min. Good with plum sauce, chili garlic sauce, or straight up.

THis was really good with the changes we made.  I used AuntWebbies dough recipe (but found I needed to double it to make enough for all the filling) and added a little lime juice after everything was added.  I also used instant mashed potatoes to save time.  My son was craving these and since we don't have anyplace that serves these within 200 miles,  this hits the spot

A LOT of work, but worth it for sure. It wound up making far more than I expected, and even with freezing some still found their way to the compost. If you're doing it for the first time, I suggest cutting the recipe in half.

What a jewel in my recipe box!  These brought the house down.  We love to try new recipes and were very happy with this exotic sensation for the taste buds!  I did make a dipping sauce out of light mayo/reduced sodium soy sauce/chili powder and a bit of Hungarian paprika.  I will make these again and again, and have had  requests for the recipe.  Thanks Donna!

These are very, very good.  I did not have tumeric, and used garam masala for the other spices.  I used wonton wrappers to fill, but I'm not too happy with that.  I think I will try to make the dough next time. I will make these again.  The filling was very easy to make, and if you're used to making pierogies, making these shouldn't bother you at all.  Thanks Donna!

Great recipe! The picky hubby loved it. Followed the recipe pretty closely except I used garam masala in place of the cinnamon, cardamom and turmeric (garam masala contains cinnamon, cardamom, coriander, cumin, etc).  Used only 1 onion instead of 2.  Made this recipe twice already.  With one batch I made for some vegetarians, I omitted the beef, again only used 1 onion, used 1 C frozen peas and carrots, and added yellow curry powder (~1-2 tsp?).  Was a little dry so I added a little water.  The veggie samosas were excellent as well!

Absolutely fantastic. My family's addicted to these so much so that they have become a "It's Friday" staple. I used egg-roll wrappers as well and they seem closer to the real thing that I've tasted from India and Kenya. The finishing touch....squeeze a lime over them while still hot. Serve with gin and tonics....DELICIOUS!

This beef mixture is SO good! I made a big batch for a luau and served it with mini-pita pockets. I have made this before with the phyllo sheets, but it took so long (for me) to put them together. But very delicious fried in the phyllo as well.

I thought the filling was good, even my kids ate it. The wrapping in the phyllo took most of the time. I think most of the other reviewer's were right to wrap the filling in something else.

I used spring roll wrapper, instead of phyllo sheets because it's easier to wrap and also to deep fry. Love the texture n it's also less oily than phyllo sheets! The filling is really authentic - no changes! Love these Samosas better than commercial ones which are way too salty !

I made changes suggested from reviewers as follows:
I made the dough that was suggested... much better than phyllo I think!
The recipe was 2c AP flour, 4 Tbsp oil, 4 Tbsp water.   The filling needed double this dough recipe, however the dough was great
I also used lentils instead of peas, and garam masala instead of cardamom (didn't have any)
The samosas seemed very authentic this way.... I might try baking some of them next time.    I served these with tziziki sauce

Vegetarian variation
This recipe has great flavor to build on!  I eliminated the beef and added additional potatoes (2-4 more based on size)and added another 1/2 c of frozen peas so they'd be vegetarian. Wonton wrappers instead of Phyllo pastry were a great and more authentic substitute.

These were excellent!!! I followed the recipe exactly EXCEPT I used egg roll wrappers instead of phyllo dough because I don't care for phyllo dough.  I just put 2 tbsp of the filling into each egg roll wrapper and wrapped it up like a regular egg roll and fried them about 3-4 minutes flipping half way through. I ended up using about 1 and a half packages of wrappers (made around 30 total samosas).  To save time I made the filling the night before while making a quick dinner, refrigerated it and added the cilantro and chilies the next day, wrapped and fried them.  We tried a variety of dipping sauces that we had in the fridge and found that dipping them in light sour cream tasted really great.  I think it was well worth the time and effort.  Will make again.

Years ago I worked in a natural foods store that received a weekly delivery of freshly made samosas from a local Indian woman. They were so delicious but I never considered attempting to make my own. Recently I got to thinking about them, and now that I don't have access to that natural foods store, my only option to was to make them myself. This recipe had all the ingredients and flavors I remember about those samosas. I followed the recipe exactly but before stuffing the dough, I tasted the mixture and found it to be bland. So I doubled all the spices. I didn't care for the mashed potatoes and probably should have followed my instincts to leave them in small pieces like the original ones I had enjoyed. I also should have used an authentic dough recipe. The phyllo detracted from this because it isn't anything like samosa dough. Overall, these were ok but  very time consuming. I served them with the Tomato Chutney II recipe from this website.

If I could give this recipe 5 million stars, I would!  I did change just a few things in the filling: diced the potatoes before boiling, omitted the cumin seeds and green chiles, only used 1 onion, gently mashed the potatoes and peas into the meat mixutre. For the skins, I used spring roll skins - each one cut into three strips.  I then placed a small amount of filling on one end, folden the skin over forming a triangle, and kept rolling up until I made a little football shaped samosa!  To seal the edges, I made a paste out of cornstarch and water - just moistened the edge with it.  I then deep fried as the recipe calls for.

These are really tasty! I changed up the recipe a little to make them vegetarian, by omitting the meat, and using chickpeas instead. I also used refrigerated pie dough instead of the phyllo dough, and baked in the oven as one reader suggested. I did not mash the potatoes, but kept them in a small dice. They were a big hit at the party I took them to. I might try making them with the phyllo next time, but the pie dough was good too. Thanks for a yummy recipe!

The filling was absolutely, undoubtably authentic and completely wonderful! My husband and I loved it. The phyllo was not authentic, but we enjoyed it anyway. I brushed it with butter and baked it in a 425 oven for 25 minutes, turning once.

this was awesome. i too dislike phyllo dough for samosa, but making my own is a pain in the tail, lol. so i use tortillas. alot of my indian relatives and friend do it this way. just get regular flour tortillas, and cut them in half (half circle) and then make a paste with flour and water, and form a cone. fill with mixture, and fold over on top and seal with paste. fry as normal. this is a much thicker medium to work with, and frys up big and fluffy. hope this is helpful!

Yes!!!! Finally a great recipe for Samosas. Thank you. I also used eggroll wraps, cut in half so it wasn't too doughy and we can really taste the perfect combination of spices. I made a sauce of 1 cup plain yogurt, 1/2 cup fresh celantro & 1 green chili pepper. Just throw it all in the blender and puree.

Thank You....sassyangelkiwi

My husband enjoyed these more than I did.  I made my dough from scratch rather than using phyllo dough and they came out a little dry.  I didn't have any ground coriander or peas and I baked them for 30 minutes at 400 rather than frying them.  There not as good as the ones I get at the restaurants around here, but they do hold their own.

This is the only Samosa recipe I've ever tried, and I wouldn't hesitate to use it again.  One worthy note is that I used ground chicken, instead of beef, and no one noticed the difference.  I also used egg roll wrappers (right next to the philo dough at the grocery store) to wrap the samosas, and then baked them at 350-ish until they were browned and crispy.  They take a good while to make, but not very long to eat... they're really, really good!

These are delicious as is. However, I make the filling and spread it between two flour tortillas, then brown on both sides. Viola!!!.....Somosadillas.  A quick shortcut and tastes better than nasty prefab pie crust.

Like most of the reviews have already stated the fillings is great but using the phyllo dough and the frying it in all the oil is yuck! the dough did not bother me. I used the method of melted butter and layering the dough, then cut it into lil squares...filling them and folding them over. At the very end I took a few sheets of the dough, without using the melted butter and rolled the filling up in that and fried it real quick, and that turned out much better. A lot less oil. So next time that is how I will do it.

This is an excellent recipe that is full of flavor.  I used eggroll wrappers that I found in the produce section of my grocery store.  I cut the wrappers in half and folded them over three times into a triangle.  I dipped them in sour cream and salsa.  You can also dip them in mint chutney.  I will make these again!

Flavor-licious! The spices in the filling are divine. We pretty much followed the recipe for the filling but used a few suggestions from other reviewers. We diced then boiled our potatoes and did not mash them. In addition to the peas, we added boiled diced carrots just cause they were around. And not having fresh green chiles, we used a red chile paste instead. It all came together great, especially when you add the lemon juice that was also suggested. For the dough, we opted for AUNTWEBBIE's tip. The dough is so forgiving to use and quite light after they are fried. We can't get enough of this dish, so much so that we have made it twice already. And if you got leftover filling (which we made sure of), it's great with a bowl of rice. Thanks to all for the recipe and tips.

Very good.  I did not use wonton wrappers but instead made the samosas from a dough.  The filling was delicious and was made as directed.  Will definitely make these again.

Good, but a LOT of work.  To make it a little easier I've also done this with instant potatoes, curry powder instead of all the individual spices, and baked inside biscuts from the tube instead of fried in phyllo.

These were good, but not out of this world, I can stop ordering take out from the local curry house good.  Maybe because I used ground lamb instead of ground beef?  I doubt it.  I think it just lacked enough of each of the spices to keep it interesting.  Next time I would increase the amount of cumin, and maybe add in some cayenne pepper?  Even so, overall they were still tasty; I fried them up in eggroll wrappers and my husband raved.

Terrific recipe! My family couldn't get enough of them. My spice conscious sibblings loved them! I didn't have any potatoes so I used instant potatoes and just mixed them in! Was great! As for the dough, I used about 2 1/2 cups flour mixed with 1/2 tsp. ground cumin. Then added just enough water to make a really stiff dough. Then brushed it with oil and put it in the refrigerator for about half an hour. Rolled it out into a 8 inch circle cut it in half, then folded and pressed closed. I deep fried them. Truly wonderful! Thanks so much for the recipe Donna-Maree

This was good, but not very spicy like the samosas I have eaten in the past.  I think that doubling the spices would help quite a lot.  It seemed like the turmeric was the dominant taste, and that the other spices got lost.  Next time I will also substitute a spicier chile pepper (like jalapeno).  I also used wonton wrappers, and I thought they were excellent because they were so easy to work with.

I love samosas, and I no longer have to go to the Indian restaurant to get them!  If only I had a deep-fryer... nevertheless, they were simply divine even just baked in the oven.  Be careful not to make the same mistake I did - thaw the phyllo (filo?) dough way in advance or it will crumble to pieces on you!

Yummy! These are delicious! The meat mixture is easy to put together and while it is time consuming assembling the samosas, it is well worth the effort. I used phyllo dough for the 1st time with this recipe and after a bit of frustration (and help from my husband) we got the process down pat. I will definatly make these again. Thank you!

5 stars for flavor, not ease!!  the samosas
took a bit of time to make.  I didn't find all 
ingredients at my local grocery.  The phyllo dough
was a bit tough to work with and I ended up 
folding the samosa into squares.  My family loved
the flavor and asked that we have them again
soon!

I love this recipe!! The only thing I did differently was add more spices and salt. I also chopped the potatoes after I boiled it into small cubes instead of mash it.

Update: I just used the filling again, I tried to use pillsbury pie dough, it wasn't bad (a step up from my dough attempt) but I'm still not satisfied and will keep trying.  I had too much filling leftover so I froze and ended up using it with some shredded pot roast on the stove, served with indian butter sauce and naan.  It was good, in case anyone needs a leftover idea.

OMG!!! I made these today and they were absolutely fantabulous 

Only thing I would change: the phyllo dough was very flaky and messy. The next time,  i will try making my own pastry shell.

 Also, for a slight healthier version, i used ground turkey meat instead of beef.  it picked up the flavors of India 

I would certainly make these again

Wonderful! The only thing I would change is leave out the cilantro. We did not add the beef, made vegetarian samosas instead. Also we did not cool down filling, just spooned into dough, it wasn't a problem.

I made beef samosas using this recipe. It came delicious. The only change that I made is that I didn't use potatos. Also I use National brand Garam Masala instead of loose ingredient which is easier. If you are new don't be scared just try this receipe. It is the best !!!!

YUM, YUM, YUM!!  We love samosas and I have wanted to try making them myself for quite some time now.  Used the dough recipe posted by AUNTWEBBIE as phyllo is not authentic for samosas.  Anyway, I did not have the green chiles or paste so added some red pepper flakes and we also do not like cilantro so didn't add that.  I opted to bake mine instead of frying (I know, crazy!!) to keep them out of all of that oil, although I realize that's not typical for samosas either!  Regardless, thanks so much for this recipe, I will certainly make again as these were fantastic!  So glad there are leftovers!

The filling is really flavorful and seems authentic.  I used egg roll wrappers which worked fine - you could easily taste the filling and weren't overpowered by dough.  Collecting the ingredients took more time than filling the wrappers.  I fried them as the recipe directed - make sure your oil isn't too hot or else the wrapper will have bubbles.

This is a fantastic recipe.
Make sure to make the homemade dough as AUNTWEBBIE above has suggested.
I deep fried these with the homemade dough and they turned out perfectly, not at all greasy like you would think. A big hit.
I tried the phyllo dough that was changed by someone in the recipe, yuck, that gets very greasy and does not go with this filling at all.
Make it like the original poster intended it to be made, you won’t be disappointed.

I just love these! I omitted the chile peppers but I think it would be great with them. I swapped won-ton wrappers for the phyllo and tried them baked and fried. Frying was definitely better! These freeze well, too. I froze the filling and the wrappers seperately before I cooked them. I ate the remainder of my second batch last week... and they had been frozen for over a month. YUM. Thanks for this great recipe!

Every Christmas an anesthesiologist's wife would make these for the entire OR.  ( they are from India ). I HAD to figure out how to make them for myself, and these are almost EXACTLY the same.  A little hard to assemble, but well worth the effort!

WOW!!!  That was my first time trying to make samosas, I've had them many many times before, and loved them, this recipe captures the essence of what samosas are supposed to taste like, a couple of things, I didn't have ginger, so I didn't add any but added all the other called for spices.  To cut down on the cost of spices, I went to a bulk food store and purchased a little bit of everything i needed.  Also, do NOt use phyllo pastries, that's not what a real samosa is made of, there's special samosa frozen pastry that you can purchase, it's also rectangular in shape, can be purchased at any Indian or Middle Eastern grocer.  I made lots of the filling and froze in a tupperware so that it's handy whenever i get the craving.  Enjoy!

Fantastic filling for samosas! I followed the recipe exactly except I left out the green pepper chiles (didn't have any), and I used Won Ton wrappers brushed with butter and baked in the oven at 400 degrees. I wasn't satisfied with the Won Ton wrappers in the oven, and I look forward to taking a stab and making my own dough next time- the filling was just that excellent! I also read somewhere that you can take leftover filling and make small patties to fry just as you would leftover mashed potatoes. Be sure to have a nice spicy chutney on the side to dip the samosas in. By the way,they taste yummy cold too!

since i'm a vegetarian, i made these for my son and husband, both very picky. i didn't add peas, since the hubby hates them, and forgot i was out of cardamon so i added a bit of garam masala. the grocery store closest to us never had puff pastry or phyllo, so i used wonton wrappers, which i had on hand anyway. all things considered, they smelled so good when cooking i was very tempted to try a bite! my son wouldn't touch them, but he's 3, so i forgive him. my husband loved them -- so a huge success! thanks for the recipe, i'm sure i'll make them again!

I didn't have any green chilis (I used extra extra hot chili powder instead), cumin seeds, or ginger. I bought all of my spices at the Indian market they were each about a $1 each versus the grocery store which was charging $12 for cardamom alone. I also used spring roll wrappers instead of the phyllo dough as that is what the owners of the Indian market told me to use. These came out pretty good. I ended rolling them up as spring rolls but no one minded.

The flaky texture of the phyllo dough used in this recipe is unlike traditional samosas and seemed to hold alot of the oil after frying them.  I was looking for something with a more of an authentic taste and this recipe had too much beef compared to potatoes (for me).  Something to add an extra kick though: dip the samosas in mango chutney (mmmmm-mmmm-mmmm)

Tasty! I was dubious about the inclusion of cinnamon in an Indian recipe, but everything came out nicely. The flavoring was a bit mild (although good), and we probably could have used more of the spices - especially cumin - without mucking up the recipe. We "cheated" and used a package of small round wonton wrappers, which worked nicely. I also committed a minor blunder and forgot to throw the cumin seeds and bay leaf into the oil, so I just added the seeds with the rest of spices and omitted the bay leaf, which didn't seem to impact the flavor much at all. A diced jalapeno added just the right amount of spicy kick to these.

This is an incredible recipe. There are only a couple of foods my husband requests by name an on a regular basis. This is one of them. He told me the other day that it makes his mouth water just thinking of it. 
A couple of times, I had to modify it a little for lack of ingredients, but it always turns out delicious. I use the pastry recipe given by someone in an earlier review. I've tried it with wontons, but I thought the best was the Indian pastry.
Excellent recipe...a definite keeper and one for the books! Thanks so much.

I made this recipe for a party and people liked it a lot.  I substituted chicken for the beef, and used Pepperidge Farm puff pastry sheets instead of phyllo. They were pretty easy to roll out and came out good.  I baked these at 400 for 15 minutes, checked them, they weren't done.  I increased the temperature to 425 and baked for another 10 mins.

I've never made these before. They were a mess and difficult to make, and the ingredients were EXPENSIVE. They were really, really good, but I don't think I'll ever be able to make them again. It was too spicy for my parents, but they can't stomache anything over really mild anyway.

I wasn't very skilled with the phyllo dough. Had a hard time making triagle shapes, so I made egg roll shapes instead. Forgot how important it was to keep the dough moist. Anyway these came out tasting like the real thing.If you like restauraunt beef samosas then you wont be dissapointed.

these are fabulous!!! Don't cut the spices, they are not that hot! I also add ground meat or sausage to my filling. Thanks so much to the poster with the dough recipe (my forever pastry for samosa's, hand held meat pies, and pizza pops) love that you can bake instead of deep fry! I bake at 400 to 410 F till lightly golden. My guy requests these all the time now, so I make a big batch and freeze them (vacuum sealed) so we can just nuke one anytime we want. Thanks again for a great recipe

Wow, yum!  Made almost exactly as recipe directs, only I didn't have fresh cilantro or green chilies. I'm sure they would be delicious. Oh, also left the peas whole and added them with the mashed potatoes during the last portion of cooking. Used the dough recipe from AuntWebbie, was perfect.  Thanks for a great recipe!!!

Really good!  I live in a rural community so I had to omit or substitute some spices I couldn't find but they are delicious. I will make them again and try a different wrap. Maybe spring roll wrappers as others suggested.

Spectacular!  I made it vegetarian by leaving out the beef & they were still amazing.  I'd recommend: 
1) not frying in olive oil - it leaves a weird smell
2) increasing the spices, especially the salt and garlic
3) "frying" in just the tiniest bit of oil -- really more like a sautee than a fry -- they're oily enough no matter what!

Very labor intensive but worth it if you have a few hours; I made the dough as listed by AuntWebbie. It was a little crumbly though so I had to add water as I was rolling/filling the samosas, to hold them together. I ended up baking them in the oven because I've never deep fried and was intimidated by that. They came out delicious and authentic, I was assured.

A lot of work. Best for 3-4 people. Needs array of sauces including one in comments. Used phyllo as a burrito. Annoying but good. Maybe try flaky pie crusts? Also used southern hash browns.

The filling is very good, with strong, bold and aromatic flavors. It's better when made ahead and it has time for the flavors to really set in.

I didn't use phyllo as most are made with hydrogenated oils, so I made my own with flour, salt, oil and water.  I also baked them instead of frying, as I wanted to see if they tasted similar.  They were good, but I would probably fry them as they're a little chewier. I'd recommend making your own dough or buying the uncooked flour tortillas from Costco.

I used goat meat, and pie crusts, then baked it. The spices are key. I will def makes this again, but prefer goat to beef for samosas.

I found wrapping in phyllo was easier than using samosa wrappers, and still tasty.  This made about 60 samosas w/ 1Tb filling each. The filling lacked flavour, despite all the spices.  Perhaps more hot chiles during the cooking stage?  Also agree with another reviewer - mash potato first and then add peas.  On the plus side - my picky 5 year old really liked them!

They tasted even better than the ones we order at Indian restaurants! I used a litle less onion and instead of phyllo I used springroll wrappers (all I had on hand) and it came out great.

superb! I had a lot of trouble wrapping them in triangles but I did make spring rolls.  didnt have green chilli, so I used a jalepeno! Found that it needed alot of salt if you are rolling spring rolls because of all the pastry.. works both as spring rolls and samosa deliciously! will be pulling the frozen ones out tonight for iftarr! yummy

I made this recipe exaclty (minus the cumin seeds because I couldnt find any at my grocery store) but I felt like they weren't quite spicy enough. I tasted the "stuffing" before making them and knew this but was terrified to add too much of something and ruin them... My boyfriend and mother in law raved though, they were so good. I used an authetic samosa dough recipe though... just wonderfull.

great filling flavour, but to reduce the pressure on stomach bloating i removed the potato.   i like to use home made bread dough risen and punched down and rolled out, then baked before rising again.  be sure to make a hole in the top so there are no air pockets.  thanks!

I made the filling as written and tried the dough recipe from AUNTWEBBIE.  The filling tasted amazing but I wasn't able to get the dough to kneed together.  I put it in the fridge hoping it would help, but it didn't.  So I'm going to go to the store tomorrow to buy phyllo dough or samosa wrappers and try again.

perfect, but not with the phyllo dough, the real samosa sheets are much better , if U can`t make ur own samosa pastry U can find it in most of middle eastern or indian grocery stores.

The filling is amazing!  However I proved to be an idiot when trying to stick the phyllo together, it kept on coming apart.  I tried frying a few but found that they came undone and became really oily.  I tried baking a different batch in the oven at 400 like others suggested - it's the way to go.

These were a wonderful distraction from ho-hum dinners.  I got one out of three teenage girls to agree. Tasty, but a lot of work would be the drawback to this. I will make again when I have more time. These were still wonderful going back and reheating the next day, for lunch at work too.

Great recipe.  Lots of work but worth it!  My husband (who is Indian) loved them!  I thought they were good but didn't love them as much as he did so that's why the 4 stars.  Will not make this often only because it's very time consuming and rather fattening drenched in oil but it will be an occasional treat that my husband will enjoy. Thanks!

Phyllo dough is out - definitely use either wonton skins or the pastry recipe from another review in this recipe. But the filling is amazing, and with the proper skin, they are the perfect beer snack. I made these and took them to one of my local haunts, everyone was in awe!

Made a few minor adjustments: finely chopped and boiled the potatoes instead of mashing and used the dough recipe posted on the review for this recipe.  I couldn't stop eating them, will make again.

Delicious!  These are time consuming, but worth it!  They freeze really well after deep frying, so you can make a big batch and freeze them.  The only thing we changed was using Wonton wrappers instead of phyllo, only because we're not crazy about phyllo dough - too crispy and papery.  We eat them with plum sauce, very tasty.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Once you get the hang of how to fold these its not as hard to do as you think. I made these for superbowl and every one loved them. I modified the recipe to use garam masala instead of all the other spices,(except indian chilli powder) it was a lot less expensive that way, and tasted very good. I added too much chilli powder and had to stretch out the filling so it wouldn't be too hot, (I added an extra pound of ground beef).I also forgot to add the chopped green chiles and cilantro, we didn't even notice they were gone. I don't think I would add the fresh chiles but I would add the cilantro next time. Because of the extra beef my batch made twice as much filling and I used 2 boxes of fillo dough.

These samosas are fabulous!  The only change I made was to use puff pastry.  I rolled each half package into a rectangle and cut out 12 squares (24 total).  I used an egg wash to seal the edges and brushed the egg wash on top of the samosas before baking on parchment paper for 20 minutes at 400 degrees F, until they were puffy and golden brown.  Having done this and tasted the end product, however, deep frying would have been more authentic LOL.  The flavour is wonderful nonetheless.

This recipe makes a LOT of filling.  I made 24 samosas and still had 4 cups of filling left over, which I will freeze for next time.

Made these for a card party at my house. I was very, very surprised how good they are. I hate peas, but you can't even taste them.  Takes a little work, but it was worth it.  Will probably do again.

These were great..I took them to a potluck and they were the first thing gone.. my friend says I can make them again..I used spring roll wrappers, because that was what I had on hand.  They turned out great.  Thank you for the recipe Donna-Maree. I will definately make this again.

I LOVE this recipe, and so did the guests who I made these for.  I turned this into an appetizer by piping the filling into pre-made phyllo cups.  It was a hit!  I'm making these again for my next dinner party.

Tasted great, and I baked rather than fried the samosas. My issue is, and maybe I did something wrong, but I only used MAYBE 1/3 of the filling. Going to throw the rest in a premade pie shell and have samosa pie!

I messed up my filling (used too much potato and the peas were frozen) and that is probably why it needed a bit more salt but these were still complete food crack. People complaining about the dough, the dough varies by region. I used premade frozen puff pastry sheets (I'm from the USA) and they worked perfectly.

I made this and it was delicious.  The Samosas we had in Vancouver BC were made with a mixture of Lamb,Pork and Chicken I believe. So I used 1/2lb each beef and pork. It was very good.  We dipped them in a sweet chili sauce and will look at a few other sauces to dip them in next time.  I will say this recipe start to finish was 2 hours. A bit different than the 40 listed.  Next time I’ll use a food processor to speed up the prep. Thank You - Amazing

I made this filling but instead of dough and trying I put it in tortillas and pan fried them like a quesadilla. Healthier and quicker!

This was really good. I’m not a big fan usually of these spices but I really enjoyed this. I made the dough and baked them instead. I made them each about the size of your hand. I made a dipping sauce of soy and ginger paste. Husband asked for seconds. Good stuff. Thank you for the recipe. It will now be in our six week meal rotation!

Instead of ginger root, I used ginger powder and instead of frying them, I cut pastry puffs into triangles and basted them with egg before baking on 400 until golden brown.  Served with a chutney dipping sauce.  Outstanding!

These were tasty and light!  They are even better tasting cold the next day but the pastry is no longer crispy.  I did however reduce the salt to 1 tsp (good thing!), omitted the green chilies and reduced the chili powder and black pepper  (we like foods mild-moderately spicy).  I also tried making the dough wrap from scratch (recipe from one of the reviewers here) which made larger samosas that were hardier.  I would make these more often if I had a deep fryer.  Otherwise, I'll make them on special occasions for appies (using the phyllo) or as an entree (using the dough from scratch).

Great recipe except for the phyllo dough, it was difficult to find and it was flaky instead of how the traditional samosa are. Next time I will use a different dough but keep he recipe for the filling. Very tasty filling! The potatoes and peas along side the meat was a hit!

I normally prefer chicken or vegi samosas to beef, but these were better than any samosa I've had before. Will definitely be making these again.

I made it with lamb. The flavor profile was right but the meat was too rich and I've never worked with phyllo dough before. This was difficult to work with but I would make it again.

I tried this recipe but totally mixed it up by using yves veggie ground round  no added oil and just having it in tortillas wraps...my mum who will rarely eat my vegetarian cooking because she loves her meat was obsessed with it and has been begging me to make more...I know I didn't do it exactly the same but regardless I thought it was amazing. Thanks so much xx

It's ok. Nothing to talk about and definitely not something I would make again. Dry and bland once the potato was added (had to double after cooking it all and tasting it). I am going to see if I can make it into a gravy to try and salvage the rest of what is in the pan. I did try some as a stuffing with cheese in a biscuit, again nothing to talk about.

I made this recipe exactly as it called and the mix tasted great but I had some issues cooking it properly. I wrapped it in the rice paper as others have done but it didn't cook through. It just stayed soft on the inside and started to burn on the outside. When i tried to pick it up with tongs it ripped the paper and fell apart. I found this recipe a lot of work and didn't get the results I was hoping for. I guess I'll be ordering out for samosas from now on. Thanks for sharing

The filling for these samosas is AMAZING, but the phyllo dough doesn't taste right and I found it really hard to work with. My suggestion...make this filling and then google for a samosa dough recipe. I found the dough easy to make and totally worth the extra effort. With that dough these freeze very well and are SO yummy!

This recipe was excellent. It is time consuming to prepare but well worth the effort. I made it with the dough from Aunt Webbie for a large family gathering and my family loved it and still takes about how fantastic these were asking when I will make them again.

This is a wonderful recipe. For a more healthy snack try it with chicken and spanich.  i don't care for spanich but with this it is soo good.  Add a little motzarella cheese and even the kids will love it.

These were fantastic.  I was lacking some ingredients (mainly the chili) so it didn't quite taste as it was supposed to but I can just imagine how fantastic this recipe would have been had I followed it to a T. (Note: I don't deep fry and I'm never going to deep fry, so I used a simple dough recipe instead and baked them in the oven.  Not quite like samosas but it's the filling that counts!)

I didnt use beef as we are veg*n. I followed the filling directions other than the beef. I made my own dough which i recommend to get a true samosa flavor. This was quite yummy and everyone wanted more. Thanks!

Too much work for the end result. I made the dough as listed by one reviewer. When I fried them , the edges opened up.  I also did the phyllo in the oven as there is alot of filling -  and it was OK. Filling was tasty, but too fussy putting it all together.

Made them for a family gathering, and I received a ton of compliments for it. I didn't even realize how delicious samosas  are until I made these. I didn't add the cilantro and chili peppers.

Delicious!  I'm a beginner, so I was so excited when I made these and they turned out great!  Almost exactly like the samosas I buy at restaurants!  I wanted vegetarian samosas, so I cut out the beef.  I also can't handle spicy food, so I didn't add the peppers.  I had no cilantro and used parsley instead.  Instead of phyllo, I used pastry puff sheets.  Next time I'll try making my own  dough to get a more authentic samosa.  

Thank you so much for sharing this!! :-)

The samosas are very flavorful.
I did use 2 sheets of phyllo around each samosa and put them in the oven.  I was very pleased with the results.
The only thing I did not like is that I had to use too many pots/pans to make this dish and it is time consuming.

Omitted the potatoes (for me) and the peas (for my husband and kids) and everyone LOVED this dish! We ate it as an entree with saffron rice and a cucumber and tomato salad. I can't wait to try this at our next dinner party. A nice change of pace for us! Thank you!

LOVED the flavours, but made a couple of blunders - was excited to try but didn't have time so tripled (wanted lots - samosa is my favourite lunch lately) and threw in slow cooker.  Flavours/smell was lovely but got mushy. :(  Also was looking for more traditional samosa but tried suggestiong to use won ton wrappers to cut time - absolutely HATED the result.  However, will try again according to directions and use traditional dough recipe provided later by original submitter. Also think the spice mix will be incredible for a meat marinade or any curry.  Loved the fact it was delightfully FULL of flavour and heat could be controlled.  Some curries are all heat, no flavour (BORRRING!).  Can't wait to try again!

Absolutely delicious!  Very authentic and the cilantro adds the finishing touch.  Does anyone know how to make those sweet sauces for dipping samosas?  We dipped ours in a vinagrette from our salads.  I followed the recipe, couldn't find the onion flakes, and it was perfect!

I am only 10 and when I made these samosas, they were such a big hit for me and my family! Yummy! I have made them 5 times, and we usually have it with Dhal.

These were good, but i was at a loss as to what kind of peas to use.  I decided on chick peas.  I used wonton wrappers.
