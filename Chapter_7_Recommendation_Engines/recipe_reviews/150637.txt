Very simple and easy to prepare! I used Bush's Baked Beans as my base and swapped out the pancake syrup for some molasses. This is a great "semi-homemade" recipe and a great way to perk up a regular 'ol can of baked beans in essence making them "Better Baked Beans"!

Aside from the brand of baked beans I used being much too liquidy, these were pretty good! Nice flavor.  I've made similar recipes and enjoyed them, but this is the first I've seen using pancake syrup - and I liked it. Next time I make this I'd be curious to swap it out for real maple syrup. I prepared this a little differently and was very happy with the results - I diced the bacon and sauteed it, then added the onions and cooked them until tender - didn't want to risk ending up with raw onion.

Very good baked bean recipe.  This is similar to how I make them, but with the addition of the  pancake syrup.  We really liked the flavor.

I've been making this same recipe for years. I believe it is in the original Angels and Friends Recipe book. When I bring it to my family's Fourth of July picnic I have to triple the recipe. Everyone loves it!

Good recipe to work from.
Followed the recipe, sorta, except for the slight additions.
Used bourbon barrel maple syrup (from a real tree, verse corn) from Costco, and 1 Tbsp of 100 proof Evan Williams bourbon to enhance the flavors already in this one.
No bacon.

I made these baked beans to go with fried whiting and sweet cornbread. ( yes I’m a southern girl!) I put a little of my own flair to it. The above recipe gave me ideas. So thank you! Used hickory bbq sauce with the ketchup, used Dijon mustard, a little cinnamon and I sautéed the onions in the grease with the bacon after I cooked it and mixed it all in with the bake beans.  I also added buttered white rice.  Turned out really delicious.  Next time I’m mixing it with some ground beef and adding green peppers. Thanks. Really good!!!

I added mixed green peppers (green, yellow, orange, and red) that were slightly sautéed in extra virgin Olive Oil.  I think I added to taste, ginger and Turmeric! The recipe  was actually tripled to accommodate a large number persons. It was great and flavorful!

I needed to make vegetarian baked beans so I used Bush's vegetarian baked beans and followed this recipe, omitting the bacon and adding a dash of liquid smoke, smoked paprika, and a clove of garlic. I also drained the sauce from the cans so it wouldn't be too soupy. They came out great!

Made it as is, no changes. I did drain a bit of sauce out of my beans as I thought they were a bit runny, but that was just the brand I used. Served it as a side dish to four teenage boys in the house. They wolfed it down and asked for more!

I used this as a basis, used a heirloom tomatoe from my garden, red onion, hot sauce, and peppers again for my garden added garlic and pepper.

I think o ended up using twice the syrup and ketchup since I didn't have brown sugar and I added three strips of bacon to the beans and three on top

While I liked the flavor of this I think it maybe needed more time or a higher temperature. At 350 degrees and 40 minutes the bacon was still very undone. The beans were cooked but still a bit firm. Next time I’ll cook it longer and maybe add some garlic.

I followed the recipe completely with one exception.  Instead of pancake syrup I used molasses instead.  It takes it to another level and taste.

Easily the best baked beans I have ever made. I doubled recipe added 1 and a half beef Kelibasa, a shot of Jim Beam Bourbon,  1 diced green pepper,  and turkey bacon for the top. Absolute perfection! :-)

This recipe is probably wonderful as written, but I don't eat pork, so I did alter it a bit.  I used vegetarian beans and omitted the bacon.  Also used pure maple syrup instead of pancake syrup because that's what I had on hand.  Tossed in a few chopped, fresh serrano peppers as we like things a bit spicy.  The beans were a hit even with the carnivores!  Nothing leftover.  Will definitely make agin.

Great recipe. I added a little chopped bell pepper and cut the bacon into smaller pieces before putting on top.  Cooked about 5 minutes longer.

The flavor is right, but you can't expect bacon to brown that way...I broiled it at the end to try and get it cooked through more.

Great and made easier by using real bacon bits and instant minced onions.
