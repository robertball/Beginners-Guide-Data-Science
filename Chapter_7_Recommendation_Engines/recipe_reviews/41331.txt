Very yummy! I used olive oil instead of butter because--how lazy is this--I didn't want to take the time to melt the butter. The next day, I poured some balsamic vinegar on it, and it was great cold at lunch, too!

The addition of the toasted almonds is key to making this an interesting and tasty green bean dish. I will add a little less rosemary next time - the taste of the dried version can be a little strong for the mild flavor of the beans.

This looked great for a small dinner party I had, served along with "Kyle's Cheesy Chicken" and some wild rice.  Taste wise it was good but not amazing.  (I left out the mushrooms.)  The almonds made the dish, without them it would've been kinda bland.  Extremely quick & easy, I will keep this one.

We served this with "A Good Easy Garlic Chicken" and mashed potatoes & gravy.  It made a hearty, complete meal in less than a half hour!  The rosemary was a little overpowering in the green beans though;  it would be fun to start with the beans, mushrooms and almonds, then experiment with your own favorite herbs.

These were very good.  Could have used a little salt - but it wasn't a problem to let people add their own salt.  Great dish especially for feeding a crowd.

Was absolutely delicious.  I used fresh green beans and fresh baby bella mushrooms.  I steamed the greens beans first to make them soft.  Then I sauted the green beans and mushrooms with 1T of olive oil.  I then followed step #2. My dinner guests devoured this side dish.

These were excellent and very easy!  Sauted a can of mushroom slices in a bit of butter with a sprinkling of onion salt.  Also added a little bit of sage (by mistake - but came out excellent!)

Not bad. I made this for my family. I normally don't like green beans, but I liked this recipe. Another reviewer was right, though, the almonds really make the dish. I used natural slivered almonds from the bulk food section to reduce sodium.

I scaled recipe to make 40 servings.  I only used about half the butter that it called for and that was plenty.  I also only used half the mushrooms as well.  I ended up using about 1/2 lb of sliced almonds.  I also used canned cut green beans instead.  I thought that this tasted great! and it was nice and easy too!

Nice updated recipe. Usually serve green beans just with toasted almonds and butter but the basil and rosemary added a nice twist. Will serve again. Kids even ate this but added additional butter.

What a great way to add some interest to frozen green beans! these were great and I will use this often. I didn't have as much slivered almonds as I thought, so I toasted some sesame seeds as well and added those. Very tasty!

I really liked this recipe -- easy, tasty, and a nice variation on green beans.  I omitted the mushrooms, however, because my husband can't stand them.
