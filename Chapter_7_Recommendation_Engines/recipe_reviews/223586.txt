This is the best quinoa I've made to date - absolutely flavorful. I made a few modifications though. I excluded the avocado and corn altogether and replaced the mango with pineapple. Additionally, I added fresh, chopped tomatoes and scallions. I cooked the pineapple with the quinoa to provide some sweetness to balance the spice. I added the tomatoes, scallions, cilantro, and lime juice at the end after the quinoa was done cooking but still hot in the skillet. The last modification involved replacing the fresh jalapeno with an extremely spicy sauce called Sun in a Bottle - I'm not sure if you can find it in the States.

This recipe was amazing.  I did it without the avocado, and it was still unbelievably delicious.  I'm going for round two today and adding a second jalapeno because I love spicy food.  The first time round you could barely notice it.

This is a great dish - full of flavor and perfect for the summer grilling season.  Didn't make it with corn, and didn't miss it at all.  Love to eat as a side dish or as a small meal

This is NOW my favorite quinoa recipe!  In addition to the lime juice, I grated the zest of the lime and used it also.  Gives it an extra "limey" flavor, which I really like.
I also toasted some pine nuts and added them which added another dimension on flavor and texture.
If I had any criticism for this recipe, I think it should be doubled.  So easy to eat this!

Interesting combo of flavors, but it works well.  I used the whole onion, left out the corn, and put more cilantro than called for.  I also used a 50/50 mixture of regular and red quinoa, which made it more visually interesting.  I couldn't really taste the jalapeno, and I even used the seeds.

This is the best quinoa dish!  I made it completely by the directions.  It was amazing.  The sweet, salty, and spicy was so good.  In the future I am going to try it with habanero peppers and peaches for a bigger bite.

This is my family's favorite quinoa recipe, they ask for it at leas once a week. My tweaked version has 2 jalepenos, I've never added the corn or mango. I usually add in a bell pepper, whatever color I have in the fridge at the time. I make it in my pressure cooker: saute the onion, garlic, peppers, then add the quinoa and broth. 3 min on high pressure, 7 minutes natural release, and it's turned out perfect every time. YUMMY!

Absolutely fantastic. Rich with flavor, unlike any other quinoa recipe I've tried. I added diced up pieces of tempeh to up the protein/make it more of a main dish. I *did* leave in the jalapeno seeds, so this dish had a lot of kick. The boy and I both loved it and will be adding this to our weekly rotation!

I wasn’t able to find a decent avocado, but I’m sure that if you added some quacamole to it, it would be fine. Overall, the recipe was a nice surprise. I love cilantro lime rice and this was spot on! Add in the heat of the jalapeño, the sweetness of the mango and the tartness of the lime and it was outstanding! Thank you for a great recipe!

I had to use vegetable broth, because I couldn't find my chicken broth and without corn. This was a very good recipe. Yes, it is light in flavor, but you could change that if you wanted. I loved being able to taste the fresh mango and fresh avocado without seasonings over powering them. I served them with some chicken and for me, I had it as my main course. I would make it again!

As long as you use a delicious stock - I used homemade chicken - this is delicious. It makes a great filling for burritos.

Really good.  I put in pineapple and mango because it had them both.  I  didn't have any avocado and I think that would have made it even better.

I followed the directions exactly, but it turned out mushy and not very tasty at all.  I saw the photo and had expectations that it would look like that, but later realized the onions/cilantro in the photo were raw but those in the recipe were cooked!  I left the cover over the saucepan slightly ajar, since the directions did not say either way to cover or leave uncovered.  I had to bake it in the oven for 30 minutes after just to get it to be not so mushy.  I tasted it beforehand though, and was not impressed.  I think the mangoes and avocadoes add to the mushiness, and might not have been the best choice for this recipe.  I'm thinking about making my own quinoa dishes from now on!

My husband and I love this recipe. To be honest, it smells like taco bell. I add a can of drained, rinsed, black beans and I substitute peaches for mangoes. It's so good. This is the fourth time I've made it. YUM!!!

This was an interesting combination of flavors. I will definitely try it again, but will change a few things when I do. First off I will add more chicken broth, as the recipe did not call for enough to allow the quinoa to fully absorb as much as it could. I will also be adding more jalapeno, one was not enough to add any kick.

This was really a great way to use quinoa. I didn't have mango and didn't think I wanted that flavor anyway. I used red pepper instead.  I put the red pepper and corn in for the last few minutes just to warm up. I put the cilantro and avocado in at the very end with the lime juice.  I used 2 just-crushed (bought whole dried hot peppers) peppers instead of jalapeno pepper. It adds a super kick.  I absolutely love this.

This was my first quinoa recipe and I love it. I substituted chalets for the red onion, used two jalapeños, I didn't add any mango but did throw in some diced tomatoes at the end.  Thinking about adding some strips of chicken next time.

We LOVE this recipe and it's become a regular in our household. We don't add the mango or corn though, and we find that the quinoa needs more liquid than is mentioned in the recipe. It still gets 5 stars!

I made this to go with Green Chile Enchilada Casserole!! I changed a couple of things to it. I used coconut oil instead of olive oil. I used colored bell peppers instead of mangos, and added some cumin and a pinch of chilli pepper. I took the corn out. Yummy yummy!! I love cooking with quinoa, the options are endless!! Thanks for sharing!

The only change I made was to use 2 tbls of lime juice.  This is a wonderful recipe! i will try it again with cooked chicken as a main dish.

I tried and loved it. The only thing I changed was I substituted asparagus for corn because I had some to use.

Made this for a party and everyone loved it! Most people used it as a dip. I added a little more jalapeno because I like more spice, also added some pineapple chunks. Very yummy!

I did not love it at all..... Neither did any of my family. Some of the flavors seemed to be a bit conflicting. It was weird. I am not going to make it again, kind if a waste of grocery money at my house!

Absolutely delicious! Easy, refreshing and very popular with my whole family. It also lends itself to many variations. I added marinated chicken to stretch the recipe. I also may try marinated grilled shrimp next time around.

Followed recipe exactly. Very good and I think next time I'll add some black beans and more jalapeno. Looking forward to the leftovers for lunch tomorrow!

I thought I had quinoa in my pantry until I went to make this.  Woops.  So I subbed bulgar wheat for the quinoa and it was REALLY good.  I'm not even sure I'll try it with Quinoa since my family loved it the way I made it. I thought this was good warm, but it was even better cold.

Great recipe! I've made this twice now and it's delicious and easy to make. I add a little tumeric to add some color.

Delicious! I made this exactly as written with the exception of omitting the onion and using 2 jalapeno peppers. Served it chilled. This is a great recipe for the summer! Thank you!

This was our families first experience with Quinoa. We LOVED it! Beautiful dish and delicious! I swapped Pineapple for Mango. Forgot to add corn (but really didn't miss it). Probably added a total of 2 tbsp fresh lime juice than recipe called for. Will try next time with mango and consider adding the corn. Added this side dish to our menu rotation for sure!!

This recipe is a great starting place. I added 2 more jalapenos, omitted the mango, another avocado, red bell pepper, another clove of garlic and 1/2 tsp of cumin. I cooked and chilled the quinoa, then added everything else raw for more flavor. Additional lime juice to taste is also advisable. Enjoy!
