This was really good, a make-again. I used 1 lb ground beef, 1 whole onion, whole pepper, and 2 stalks celery. I drained the meat because, yuck. I added 1 TBSP jarred minced garlic and 1 TSP smoked paprika, because that's authentic to Czech versions of cabbage rolls, and I wanted a similar flavor profile. I would make 2 additional changes next time: I would slice the cabbage into long strands, because wedges took too long to cook (more than 15-20), and I'll add crushed red pepper because we love it. I served this over my own recipe for lemon-butter brown rice (198 calories per serving). With my changes, this recipe yielded 6 generous servings at 231 calories per serving, which was deliciously filling! Thank you for submitting it!

We made this recipe the other night and it was great!  This recipe reminds me of stuffed cabbage....unstuffed. I would recommend doubling the sauce though.

We loved this. I only used a pinch of salt and reduced the beef to 1 pound, but otherwise made as written. Makes great leftovers, too.

Excellent!  I used 2# beef and a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes, rather than the sauce.  I also increased the onions, celery and peppers to adjust to the increased beef (I didn't bother to "re-size the recipe on my computer)  My husband loved it and ate 2/3 of it!!!!

I belong to a farm share delivery service and this week, I was given a head of cabbage. I have never cooked with cabbage before and went hunting for recipes.

It turned out great! I cooked the cabbage for maybe ten extra minutes than suggested in the recipe, but other than that, didn't make any modifications.

Delicious and will make again!

Yum! This was sooooo good!!! My hubs said he'd prefer this without the cabbage (he's not a fan), but that's what "makes" this dish. :) Not only is this an economical and hearty meal, it's SUPER easy to throw together! At first glance, I was worried that there wasn't going to be enough sauce, but I was pleasantly surprised. I would NOT suggest doubling it (it would be a waste of ingredients, IMHO). Additionally, I thought about draining my meat, but wanted to follow the recipe as closely as possible so I compromised and only *partially* drained it (I used ground round, btw...). It took the full 20 minutes for my cabbage (which I cut into thin strips) to cook thru. I can't imagine wedges cooking in this amount of time.... My only suggestion to anyone giving this a try is to allow everything to set up for about 5-10 minutes FIRST. If you eat this right away, it will be a bit soupy, but it thickens nicely if you can wait that long! Fried potatoes was the perfect complement to our meal (thanks for suggesting this idea mommyluvs2cook!). All I can say is YUM-O! Thanks for sharing your simple recipe, digb. This is a PERFECT substitute for traditional (but labor-intensive) cabbage rolls! :-)

Yummy! Used lemon juice vs vinegar, 1/4 C brown sugar, 1/2 C raisins, 1can tomato sauce plus 14.5 oz diced Italian seasoned tomatoes.  Left out the green pepper. Served with mashed potatoes.  Delish.

This is filling and good, although a bit bland. I used ground chicken rather than meat to keep it healthier, and shredded cabbage for ease. To up the flavor I sauteed a few cloves of garlic with the onion, and used seasoned salt, Montreal steak seasoning, and smoked paprika to spice it. It works well over rice.

Excellent flavor and so easy to make!  Served with Grandma's Polish Perogi recipe from this site, went great together.  Can stand to have a little less sugar, would still be great.

Anyone who says this is bland and boring is so very wrong and nuts! Or the did not make it correctly. I was a bit skeptical but I was wrong.  This was soooooooooo good!!  Only things I did different was to use a pint of our canned tomatoes instead of tomato sauce.  Our canned tomatoes are cooked down to almost a puree. And I used sweet red pepper instead of green.  I sliced the cabbage in strips, too. This is a definite 5 star winner for us.

This dish makes for a nice hearty meal.  I used ground venison instead of the ground beef, because that is what I had on hand.  My cabbage was coarsely shredded and not in a wedge, and I would make it that way again.  I mixed up the tomato sauce, vinegar, brown sugar and pepper up in the morning so the flavors had time to meld before using.  My hubby and I really enjoyed this dish and it is one that was even better the second day, reheated. Thanks digb for sharing.

I'm making this for the third time, and have found that the secret to taking it from good to fantastic is refrigerating it, then reheating. Makes it thicker and just brings it all together. Yummy and Weight Watcher friendly. :)

Delicious! Used ground turkey instead of beef so I doubled the spices since turkey is more bland. Also doubled the sauce and used maple syrup instead of sugar.

LOVE this recipe!  The only thing I changed was using 1 lb of ground chuck and 1lb of Italian pork sausage.    With more meat, I also upped the veggie amounts and an extra 8 ounces of  tomato sauce.  I served it over rice.  It is even better as a leftover,  THANK YOU for this keeper!

A great surprise! This dish comes together quickly and easily. I only changed two things. First, I used only 1 pound of ground beef.  Second, I used a white pineapple balsamic vinegar instead of apple cider vinegar. Delicious dinner. We used the bread to stop up the sauce.

I followed this recipe outside of playing with more ingredients, and it turned out really good. I made the meat mixture, but layered that on top of partially baked, sliced potatoes. In between the cabbage layer, I threw in a layer of shredded carrots. On the top layer, I added about 10 sliced Compari tomatoes with the sauce. The cabbage took forever to soften and I eventually abandoned playing with it; shredding it would have been better, but the crunch left was actually pretty complementary to the rest of the soft ingredients. I will make this again!

I thought it was very good and I didn't change anything (except for fresh garlic) until it was cooking for a while and then I noticed how bland it was and that was even after I used some of my homemade tomato sauce which is a little more spicy then canned. I ended up dumping in some homemade salsa I had in fridge and also added a jalapeno pepper. I also thought there was too much cabbage so I will definitely cut down on that next time. There's not enough "sauce" so I had to put in another can of tomato sauce which added to more vinegar and more brown sugar. So yeah I did end up doing more tweaking then I thought but I will make it again,

Forgot the oats, and used leftover chopped cabbage/carrots (coleslaw type, without the sauce)    Then I stuck it in one dish, spread mashed manioc(or mashed potatoes would have the same effect) on top, shepperd's pie style.  Quick. Tasty. Definitely a keeper to use up cabbage

Very tasty recipe. I ground up fresh tomatoes for the sauce, but otherwise made as recommended. Kind of like a "deconstructed" cabbage roll.

My family liked this.  I made some changes because we are trying to be healthier.  Basically I used less meat, more vegetables, and more garlic and black pepper and left out the oatmeal entirely.  I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes with basil, oregano and garlic instead of the tomato sauce.   I'm sure the recipe as written is better than mine, but ours was more in line with our diet.  I will make this again.

I added some fresh pineapple, which enhanced the sweet and sour flavour.  If I make it again, I will shred the cabbage because it took much longer to cook than stated and I had to add extra sauce.

This was really, really , good!!!  We added 1/2 lb of  extra thick sliced  applewood smoked bacon fried crisp to the meat mixture, and a can of diced tomatoes in sauce to the tomato sauce.  Added extra vinegar and brown sugar to taste because we wanted the sauce to be nice and tangy. Also added a pinch of cayenne.  We layered the meat, cabbage, and sauce in an ovenproof dish, and baked at 350 degrees x  75 minutes to let the flavored blend.  We covered with tinfoil for the first hours then removed. Served with white rice and sour cream.  Mmmmmmm.

Did it with ground beef and was great. Added fresh garlic to it. Also did it with ground brat meat and was fantastic.

We had lots of cabbage in the garden so I was looking for a new recipe to use it up.  We ran out of cabbage making this recipe over and over.   My husband and I love it so I shared it with my  sister  and her family  loved it also.  The only thing I change was I used my home canned spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce.

We thought this was fabulous. I had just over 1 pound of ground beef, and followed Jarrie's suggestions about the vegetables, as I always use whole veggies whenever possible. She didn't include celery, but I added 2 small sticks, including the leaves.  I sliced my chunks of cabbage using the thick slicing blade in the food processor - this worked well for me and allowed even cooking. I added about 1/2 T. smoked pepper, which gave a nice bite. I think my changes were useful, but were true to the spirit of the recipe. Will serve this often during the cold months!

This was really tasty.  I followed the recipe to the "T"....changed nothing.  It was almost like spaghetti made with cabbage instead of pasta.  We call it "Sloppy Cabbage Rolls".  Next time instead of oats I might add more sauce and some white rice to make it more like cabbage rolls but it was very good as is

Given the reviews I wasn't sure if I should double the sauce or not. I ended up making 1 1/2 times what the recipe calls for. I don't think it was necessary after all. I also followed the recommendation and sliced the cabbage into strands rather than use wedges and think that likely works the best. Savoy cabbage wouldn't have been my first choice but it's what I had from my farm share. Next time I will use green cabbage. This had an interesting flavour that I was expecting to taste like sauerbraten but it really didn't. (that works for me) It was also simple to prepare. I served with fried sunchokes. Thanks digb!

This was delicious!!  I made a few changes so it was clean-eating friendly.  Used ground turkey instead of beef and brown rice syrup instead of brown sugar.  My family ate it up!

I served this dish with rice. It was pretty good. I put a good bit of soy sauce, extra garlic powder, a tablespoon or more of extra oats,and a pinch of red pepper flakes in it and I found it very flavorful and satisfying. It makes a good bit, and every member of my family enjoyed it. Thanks for the recipe. Good use of very inexpensive cabbage.

My family LOVED this meal!  It was surprisingly simple to make for my big bunch, and even my children went back for seconds.  I was woorried that the ACV would make the meal bitter, but the sauce was surprisingly mild with just the right amount of tang.  Because there are so many of us, I increased the ground beef to two pounds.  (I left all the other ingredient measurements the same.)  I served it over arborio rice.
