I have been making chicken parmesan like this for years. Great for those busy nights when you need to get dinner on the table in hurry!

My husband and I both really liked this recipe. I made this recipe as is except I used thinly sliced chicken breast (you could also pound your chicken breast). I reduced the cooking time to accommodate. I browned for 2 1/2 minutes on each side, then reduced the simmer time to about 8 minutes. I think using a thinner chicken breast really sealed the deal with this recipe.

Unfortunately, the recipe accompanying the video does not match...the video is for a baked dish, the recipe is including steps to fry the chicken first...rated recipe OK til I try the video method...

I made this for my boyfriend, and he loved it! I also made it at his house, which means a general lack of kitchen supplies.

If I had known it was that easy to flatten chicken literally by hand, I would have done it more. I used a plastic baggie between my hands and chicken and actually pounded it down. That was fun. lol

It took 2 eggs, and I didn't measure out the bread crumbs.

I can see myself making this again.

I have been making this for years. The only thing I changed is I have been using chicken tenders so the cooking time is less. My son also makes this. It is so easy, quick and soooo good.

Delightfully delicious and presentable enough for company !  I had a pack of thin sliced chicken breast so used it.  The meal was easy and fast, will make it again.

Made last night. Changes I made were to add chopped basil and after browning, added cheeses and baked in oven for about 12 minutes. Chicken was very tender and juicy. Will make again.(served over spaghetti noodles )
