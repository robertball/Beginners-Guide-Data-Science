I cut the recipe in half, using only whole wheat flour, but keeping the egg whole.  I must have made mine smaller than yours (my yield with half a recipe was 3 dozen!), because they were done in the 375 oven in 8 minutes! I love the taste, texture and smell of these wonderful cookies!!!

Just made this recipe and added 1 tbsp. of honey.  They are yummy and a great way to introduce amaranth into my diet.
