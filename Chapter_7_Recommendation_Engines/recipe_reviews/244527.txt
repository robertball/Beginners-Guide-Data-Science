Upon reading the other reviews first, I increased both the pesto and sour cream to a cup and added Italian seasoning.  It turned out great.

I substituted boursin garlic & fine herbs for the sour cream and used basil pesto and it was delicious!! Just a little fresh ground pepper and dinner was ready in about ten minutes.

Very good!  I added 1 cup of sour cream and one 8 oz. jar of pesto to add more flavor.  Also added Italian seasoning, chopped onion and garlic.  A quick,  easy meal and very tasty.

I upped the pesto and sour cream to 1 cup and that was definitely a good idea.  Also added a can of fire-roasted diced tomatoes - very good recipe.  Thanks!

this was super easy to make, and fast too. the only thing is that it was really bland, and I had to add alot of seasoning to this. but with the seasoning it came out great!

Based on other reviews, I doubled the pesto and sour cream. Used whole grain rotini instead of macaroni. Also added Parmesan Cheese at the table. My family liked it.

After reading reviews I used one cup of pesto and one cup of sour cream.  Meal was still very bland. My four year old only tried one bite. Easy and quick but probably wouldn’t make again..

Best part of substitution was 1 lb. quality Italian ground sausage meat, rather than beef. Very flavorful. Topped to taste with Parmesan or Pecorino Romano cheese. I used Italian gnocchi (which I had at home).

I was very satisfied with the results. It was a quick and easy. My only recommendation would be to add some shredded cheese. I opted for cheddar

So I took the advise of other reviewers and used a cup of sour cream. I bought 2 jars of pesto, but as is my luck, I ended up (somehow) with one red and one basil - so I used them both!! I also cooked the beef with a little diced onion and added garlic, Italian seasoning and of course salt & pepper.  It came out quite well!  I’ll likely make it again, but use only tomato pesto!

Made this with the adjustment of  more pesto and sour cream ( per other suggestions) Used my homemade pesto sauce, which is very strong in flavoring so when mixed with pasta or other ingredients, it's not lacking seasoning or bland. It was extremely easy and good. Warmed up leftovers were even better. Maybe I'll add a little sausage next time also

I'm a newby to cooking so i basically made it as is. I did add sweet onions finely chopped and italian seasoning.
Well i have never cook with pesto so i didnt know what to expect. Turned out good but really not to my taste. I'll keep on trying new recipes.

We really liked this but was dry even though I halved the macaroni and almost doubled the sour cream and pesto. I used a full 8oz jar of tomato pesto. Next time I’ll add a little milk, maybe 1/4 cup.

Meh. Definitely needed more of a sauce. And I used garlic pesto. I would make this again with fusilli or penne instead.

This was easy to make but the taste was just “okay” for me. Will add some salt and pepper. Not sure if I’ll make it again but it’s definitely good for dinner in a pinch.

Increased the sour cream and pesto to 1 cup each. I used basil pesto. This was good and very fast to make. Next time I'll try it with the red pesto.

This was delicious.  A few changes.  Used whole container of pesto, added 1/2 yellow onion, one can Rotel tomatoes and sprinkled some roasted pine nuts over top before serving.  Super easy!  Thanks for recipe.

Really great and super simple. I made it with ground turkey instead of beef and it was still great. I portioned it out for lunches and it reheated nicely.

This was great. After reading reviews,  I used a cup of pesto and about 12 ounces of French onion dip in a pinch (My sour cream had frozen in the fridge). I seasoned the meat to taste with garlic salt and sprinkled mozzarella cheese on top. Great recipe to adjust to your tastes and I'll be making this again.

Quick, easy and delicious! I used ground turkey which can tend to be bland but the pesto perked it up. Moist too!

Very good basic recipe, but I added my own twist :)  I added sofrito (about 2 Tbsp),  jalapeno, tumeric, onion, and garlic. Yummy.  My BF was skeptical of the pesto sauce, but he loves this recipe.

Made it as written. Was a little dry for my taste. my husband seemed to like it, so did my 10-year old. Next time I might try a green pesto, and more of it!
