I made this one and all enjoyed it.  I used regular tomato soup and it still was great.  I also served it over rice.

I used organic Amy's southwestern soup instead of the campbells.  To make it healthier I used wide spelt noodles.  This was very tastey.

I couldnt eat a bite.  My husband tried to pull out just the noodles but could barely get those down.
