The beauty of this dish is not only in it's simplicity, but also for the fact that it's delicious and is a beautiful and colorful addition to your dinner plate. This is one of those recipes that needs no tweaking, no changes. Whether it's 25  minutes or 50 minutes as other reviewers stated, bake the squash for as long as your oven requires. Other than that this is just a simply perfect recipe, perfect dish as written... subtle, mellow and sublime. Oh...hubby the squash hater not only tolerated it, but liked it. And our picky dinner guest went back to the kitchen for seconds! Go figure--must be the recipe!

THIS is the only way my friend and frequent dinner guest wants me to cook butternut squash from now on. I make a killer butternut bisque (previous butternut squash fave dish), but this was fabulous! I increased the garlic (doubled it), I used dried parsley, and I cubed the squash on the small-ish side. Mine took about 35 minutes to cook. I added the Parmesan cheese after 25 minutes in the oven. I usually like to add freshly grated cheese to these kinds of recipes, but I didn't have any so I used the Parmesano/Romano grated blend. I lined the baking dish with non-stick aluminum foil for easier clean-up. This recipe rocks! Mine looked very pretty with the green parsley contrasting the orange/yellowish squash so I'd say you can make this as a side for guests and serve it on a pretty serving plate.

WONDERFUL! After reading other comments I decided to experiment tonight-- I set a timer at 15 minute intervals, stirred, tasted, and continued...  30 min's results in a very good dish, but not the full nutty flavor of roast garlic you will get with longer time.  At 45 minutes, the squash was too soft to stir without mashing, and a bit watery; I watched it carefully during the last 15 and removed it before it burned.  The texture firmed up nicely, the flavor just wonderful.  My wife came home a few minutes after I finished, the house filled with the pleasant aroma, and *had* to taste-- her response: "Please make that one again".

This smelled wonderful while it was roasting!  I used delicata squash, added the cheese about half way through and stirred the squash several times, letting it go for 50 minutes total.  Next time I'll line the pan with non-stick foil so that I don't lose any of the crusty brown bits (and cleanup is easier).

This was pretty good. It cooked must faster than listed, about 30 minutes. I think maybe 400 degrees is just too hot, it tastes a little like burnt garlic, and the edges of the pieces of squash burned. I'll probably make it again but on a lower heat.

Super tasty!  I poked holes in the squash and nuked for 8 mins, turning over half way through.  Then I used a potato peeler to peel the skin off.  This made it a lot softer for removing the seeds and cubing the squash.  I thought the oven temp. was too hot so cooked at 375 for about 1 hr 10 mins, stirring the squash regularly throughout the cooking time.  I added the cheese AFTER I pulled it out and mixed in, as well as a TBSP. of butter and some more salt.  It was really good!

I LOVED this!  I replaced the parsley with rosemary to accompany the chicken I was baking... I reduced the olive oil to 1 TBLS to cut back on the fat.  I don't care for sweetened squash and this was savory and delicious.  I will definitely be making this again.  And I'm emailing the recipe to my mom just as soon as I'm done typing!  She'll love it too!

Really tasty!  You just need to drizzle oil on the squash until it's covered.  Too much will make it greasy.  I also roasted some red peppers in the broiler and added close to the end of cooking.  I cooked on 400 degrees and it took close to an hour, I like it soft.  I used 3 BIG cloves of garlic and sprinkled parmesean at the end just before serving.  Put it in the oven on warm with the lid and it kept nicely until I was done bathing the baby!!  Will do again!

This was really good! I micro'd the squash for 5 minutes, and it made peeling and dicing a breeze. The only thing I added, by accident, was 1 tbsp. dry green chile rub. I live in New Mexico, so it's easy to come by. It turned out fantastic! Mine cooked in about 35 minutes.

This recipe was a hit at my house! I was afraid there might be too much garlic but it really tasted just right. And like the previous reviewer, mine cooked much faster- about 35 minutes. That is a good thing!

Mixed this up, spread out on a sheet pan, and baked for 25 minutes.  Then added the parmesan and baked another five minutes.  The squash caramelized during the roasting, and was so tender and sweet.  A really spectacular side dish that I would serve to company.  In addition to tasting great, it also looked great on the plate!

I cut back on the salt a bit--other than that, I made no other substution. This is absolutely wonderful. Not only did I swoon over this squash, my two boys loved it, too!

Squash is such an inexpensive meal for families that I was thrilled to find this new twist on an old standby for fall.  Any winter squash could be baked in place of the recommended butternut in this recipe.  Last night I doubled this recipe and made it with a large hubbard squash (grey-green type).  My family of 6 kids w/ varying tastes in food, and also my hubby who does not particularly like squash all loved it!

For those who have not cooked with winter-type squash before the following information might be of use:

Sometimes the squash may be intimidating to "open up".  Try using a large kitchen knife if you don't have a cleaver, and tapping lightly on it with a rubber mallet.  Personally I find cleavers a little scary unless they are being used on meat that's a little lower to the cutting board.  After cutting in half and scooping out the seeds you can usually cut the rest of the squash with the large knife and without the aid of the mallet.  Next, cut the squash into manageable slices, like a melon, and slice off the rind or skin with a knife or even a peeler.  Cube and continue with the recipe!

I added twice the amount of recommended garlic and kept everything else the same in this recipe.  Except I did wait and add the cheese after the casserole was out of the oven.  It was very moist and flavorful.  If there is lots of moisture left in your baking pan, you probably haven't cooked them long enough (as one reviewer already mentioned).  Enjoy!

I've been preparing this recipe for awhile now and it always gets rave reviews.  But we recently turned it from a side dish to a main vegetarian dish with the addition of a can of drained chickpeas.  This adds a little bit of nuttiness to the flavour and we can now add it to our Meatless Monday line up!!

This was really good! Only change was I added some fresh garlic.  Will definitely make again!  Would like to add some diced onions next time. I did find some already peeled and cut squash at the market which made things easier!

Delicious!  I mixed everything up in a ziploc bag and then added the squash and shook it until the squash was evenly coated.  Tasted great reheated the next day.  Will definately make again.

Wonderful! I'v never made butternut squash before. I will be making this again and again. I used my cast iron skillet. Heated the oil on the stove top, than put everything in the skillet and into a 375 oven. Cooked about 30 mins, bottom was nice and crusty. Also did as others and microwaved squash for 4-5 mins before peeling and cutting. Yummy!!

I cooked this tonight and it was amazing! It was so simple to make, I didn't mix everything in a bowl I just put it in the baking dish and mixed it all there.I added pinenuts and some dried cherries and it really added another depth of flavor. I didn't put the parm on because I forgot but I'm not a huge fan of it anyway. I used a dark metal pan so I reduced the heat to 325 and only cooked it 35 minutes. This prevented the "mushy" texture some people wrote about not liking. I also stirred it about every 15 minutes during cooking to prevent burning.

Maybe it was the variety of garlic I used, but the amount called for in the recipe was overwhelming.  You couldn't taste anything but garlic.

Butternut Squash is a 5 star in any recipe! It's really the only squash that doesn't taste like squash. More like a sweet potato.  Butternut squash and feta cheese compliment each other very well, so I altered the recipe and added 1/2 feta and 1/2 parm.  I also omitted parsley and used basil instead. I used dry, but fresh would be good tossed after baking.  Butternut is also very good roasted on a cookie sheet in the oven with onions, peppers and garlic.  Peel the squash with a potato peeler, cut in half and remove seeds.  Easy peezy!

Before tonight, I had never made butternut squash before. Thanks to this recipe, it will become a weekly staple in my house! My boyfriend and his family raved over it, and usually they HATE vegetables. I did make a couple of changes. First, I only used 1 tbsp of oil. Also, to coordinate it with another dish I was preparing, I cooked it at 350 degrees for 35 minutes. Then I added the parmesan cheese on top and baked at 400 for another 20 minutes. It came out PERFECT!! I used freshly shredded parmesan cheese and it created a tasty crisp on top of the squash. The pieces were nice and crunchy on the outside, but moist, sweet, and succulent on the inside. Everyone went back for seconds (and even thirds)! Thank you for sharing a simple recipe that makes a big impression!

This was really good, and so easy! I served it with a fish dish from this site and had dinner in the oven in less than 15 minutes! My squash took about 30-45 minutes to cook instead of the hour listed in the recipe.

I give this recipe 10 out of 5 stars! Delicious flavor, easy to make, and it's pretty on the platter as well. I tripled the garlic and doubled the parsley, and it was perfect (I love garlic, and I love parsley).

The adults liked, the teens did not. The garlic flavor was not overpowering and the color of the dish was gorgeous. I really like how the squash cooks up firm and is not the least bit mushy.

Was a really nice different way to jazz up squash.  Not too hard to fix or too much extra trouble.  If you microwave the squash before peeling about 15 minutes, it's much easier to get the meat of the squash out.  The fresh garlic added a great flavor. Baking it in the oven was easy and allowed for finishing up other dinner dishes.  Really liked this recipe.  Thanks.

Ask yourself these questions:   1. Do you like squash?   2. Are you looking for a quick, easy recipe?   3. Does your main dish need a delicious side?  Answering yes to these 3 questions should put you over the top to add this recipe to your collection and put it on the dinner table soon. This truly is a delicious, easy recipe. Best with roasted pork or poultry IMHO.

OH YUMMY!!!  I used extra garlic because I LOVE garlic.  I tried the suggestion of baking it at a lower temp (I did 375), but still kept it in for an hour, stirring every 15 minutes.  It turned out perfect.  I added the parmesan cheese the last 25 minutes or so of baking.  This was so good.  We will definitely make this one again and again.  I also tried this with potatoes instead of squash and it was very tasty.

Can I give it more stars?  I made this recipe exactly as it read.  (However it did not say when to add the cheese so I added it at the end)  We LOVED it!  I felt guilt free enjoying it.  My children really liked it (they are not picky eaters, love veggies).  I can not wait to serve this dish for the rest of my fall dinner guests.  Please Please Please give this one a try....do not change a thing....except maybe double the recipe!!!!  I think that this just may be my favorite find on Allrecipes yet!!!  Thanks so much Anita!

I cooked in the microwave (sliced in half and put in a pan with 3/4 inch of water-cook about 8 minutes) to shorten the amount of time in the oven.  Then I peeled/sliced and cooked according to the directions for about 15 minutes.  Good taste and super easy!

I can't get over how amazing this recipe turned out. It was bursting with flavor and was just the right texture. I doubled the garlic and the parsley, and added a drop more olive oil to the mixture. I also grated Romano cheese over it before baking, and kept it in for a full 55 minutes. I will make this over and over again and not change a thing... well, I may just have to try it with different vegetables from the squash family... I'm thinking pumpkin next. This recipe is DEFINITELY a keeper, and a must for my Thanksgiving meal this year.

My family loved this.  I had problems peeling the squash but it was worth it as it tasted wonderful.  The only thing I had to do different was to use dried parsley.

Delicious. First time I tried to make butternut squash this way. Tastes like sweet potato to me, but butternut squash is healthier! I cooked mine at 350 for 50 minutes. Next time I'll reduce the time, because the end product was a bit too mushy for me.

With all the rave reviews, I threw caution to the wind & made this for a part of the turkey day dinner... Ugh, 2 people liked it enough to finish what was on their plate, but that was it.  It wasn't hardly touched in a room full of root vegetable lovers.  Made the recipe as states. It wasn't a bad flavor, it just wasn't appealing. Most of us love garlic too, so I can't really explain why it was such a miss.

These are great.  I made them without the cheese since I'm on a no dairy kick, and they turned out delicious.  This recipe was especially effortless since I bought the butternut squash pre-cubed.  A healthy and tasty side dish.

This is a fairly good dish.  I'm trying to watch what I eat, as well as get more veggies/fruits into my diet, so this was dinner tonight.  I only used 1 tbs of dried parsley as opposed to 2 tbs fresh & added an extra clove of garlic (which is standard when I cook, lol).  Wasn't sure when to add the parmesan, so just added a few dashes right after I took the squash out of the oven.  Thanks for sharing!

naples 34102 wrote that this needed no tweaking ... and they were right.  I followed their advice and the recipe (to a T) and its delicious.  The prep is easy yet time consuming (peeling was difficult and cubing into 1" chunks was a little ambitious and I had to go smaller) but it was worth it.  DH really liked so this is a keeper (especially when this stuff goes on sale in the fall for $0.69/lb).

I baked the squash first - cut in half and baked (cut sides down) at 350 for 1 hour.  Then scooped it out and layered it with the oil/garlic mixture.  I probably quadrupled the garlic - me and the husband loved it!  Went great with pork!

Never cooked squash before, but I found this recipe looking for some creative ways to cook healthier.  It turned out great!  I made it with butternut squash grown in the garden.  I didn't bother to peel it but I couldn't even taste the skin.  One thing I would change is instead of tossing in the parsley & cheese before you bake it, sprinkle it on top with 10 minutes left to cook.  They got a little too crispy by the time they were done.  Other than that, great recipe!

This was very good! This was the first time I have ever cooked a butternut squash. It was pretty time consuming with peeling and cutting the squash, but well worth it. It only took 40 minutes to cook until it was nice and tender, I also added the Parmesan about halfway through cooking. Definitely will make again.

I followed the recipe to a T. Although, I couldn't figure out when to add the Parmesan, I added it during the "toss". Before 1/2 the time, I added h2o (bout a 1/3 cup)& after the finished product was done, It was well tasty, but there was no Pizazz. I added 1/8 tsp of red pepper. More (way) salt and more pepper and a little bout a tsp of brown sugar. (But the smell in the house was so wonderful!!!) *before adding anything*

This was heaven!  The second time I made it I added more parsley for extra crunch, and a bit more garlic.  Served it several time to various friends, even those who don't like butternut squash, and they all left with the recipe!

This is the first review I have written on this site and i am taking the plunge because this squash was phenomenal. I didnt change anything but had forgotten to add the parmesan so, I added it late. This didn't disrupt anything and I could barely save some for the rest of my family.

We made is exactly as the recipe states (I hate when people rate a recipe based on THEIR changes!) and this was wonderful!  It will be making more appearances at my dinner table and would be a great potluck dish!

Not my favourite, but still good.  It takes away from the naturally delicious flavour of the squash

This was pretty good.  I followed the directions exactly.  I mixed this up early in the day and covered tightly.  When ready to bake I put it in my casserole dish and baked as directed.  Next time I will use less garlic.  I used 2 nice size cloves and it overpowered the nice taste of the butternut squash but overall the taste of this was good.

Great tasting - one way of making me eat squash! Let my Mom try it and she really liked it too. There was only one question - when do I add the parmesan cheese (before or after cooking)? I did both ways.

This is a great recipe.  The ingredients are simple and add a lot of flavor to the squash.  About halfway through cooking I stirred the squash to make sure it cooked evenly.  I also held back a little of the parmesan for the last few minute of cooking.  This is a great side dish that goes well with just about any main course.

I had two large butternut squashes sitting on the counter, so I thought I'd try this recipe.  It was absolutely delicious!  I like how the savory seasonings complement the sweetness of the squash.  The recipe doesn't say what to do with the Parmesan, so I just sprinkled it over the top during the last 5 minutes of baking.  Perfect.  I will experiment with other spices as well.  BTW, don't use more than 2 Tbsp oil, because the squash doesn't absorb it and it will end up sitting in the bottom of the pan looking greasy.

This was the most delicious recipe I've tried in a while! Really simple to put together, and since it was my first time using Butternut squash I was blown away by the wonderful flavours from roasting the garlic and parmesan...a must try!!

This was really good. I couldn't stop eating it, the family agreed.  I'm wondering if maybe the negative reviews are because of the recipe calling for pounds of squash instead of cups. I had a huge squash and used roughly half of it to fill a 9x13 pan and guesstimated it being about the right amount. From the taste of the final product, I hit the nail on the head! The only change I made was to use 2 tsp dried parsley as I didn't have fresh available.

This is SO good!  I love this recipe. I have made it half a dozen times since, and squash is now a weekly component of our grovery list.   The first time I made this, I followed the recipe exactly, and we loved it.  After that, I started playing around. We added some diced leftover potatoes, a tomato and pumpkin (peeled and cubed). I also added some onion and about 2 tablespoons of ready-made basil pesto.  If you are not using pre-cooked potatoes, you will want to parboil them so that everything cooks at the same rate.   My husband loves this and asks me to make it all the time. When I take leftovers to work in lunches, my co-workers are constantly asking me what smells so good.  Thank you so much for a fantastic recipe that has inspired me to make bigger, better and tastier things!

Made this almost exactly as written except didn't use fresh garlic, used it from a jar and used about 1 tsp chopped.  Added the parm cheese about half way through cooking also as suggested, and reduced temp to 375. It was so delicious that my family ate the whole thing and my guest couldn't stop raving, although he had no idea what veg it was!  Will add it to my recipe box as a keeper.  I started with a whole squash and pricked skin, microwaved for 3 minutes before peeling and cutting up but I would always use the cut up kind if I could find it for ease of prep.

Fabulous!  I modified the recipe by adding a crumb topping prior to baking.  I melted a tablespoon of butter in a frying pan, added 1/3 cup seasoned breadcrumbs and then toasted them until golden brown.  Sprinkled on top before baking.  It was to die for!

This is my new favorite vegetable side dish. It was SO easy and incredibly delicious. I only baked it for about 35 minutes, and it was done. I turned off the oven, threw the cheese on top, and closed the oven again for about 2 minutes until the cheese was melted. 

I am tempted to go into the kitchen and eat the rest right out of the baking dish!

Just made this on the fly this evening, because I had the ingredients! Except I used a bag of frozen cubed butternut squash. Everyone was skeptical looking at it, including two 5 year old's. It was a hit and everyone loved the flavor! The kids both raved about how much they liked it! Will definitely make again!

Wow - this was absolutely DELICIOUS!!!  I have never eaten butternut squash before, let alone cooked with it - but this was simply divine!  The natural sweetness of the buttersquash together with the strong taste of the garlic was a wonderful combination.  My only complaint ... I didn't make enough!!!!!  Thanks soo much for sharing!! :)

This was a really great recipe.  For a fun holiday treat try mixing this squash recipe with the "sweet and spicy green beans"  recipe from this site and some roasted potatoes. I made them all one night and just decided to mix them all together in a bowl and serve them as one side dish....what a hit!! everyone loved it! You won't be disappointed and everyone will think it's so gormet.

This is definitely the best preparation of butternut squash I have ever experienced.  The squash came through with such a delicate sweet flavor that paired nicely with the garlic and parsley.  I left out the parmesan as one of my guests can't have dairy and it was delicious.  Next time I will try it with the parm.

I made this for Christmas Eve dinner and there were no leftovers!  I prepared everything the day before and put it all into two gallon size zip lock bags in the fridge.  I turned the bags over periodically to sort of marinate everything.  The only change I made was to add cut up leeks which are also wonderful when roasted.  This dish was a big hit!

Simple, tasty, pure. naples34102's review is spot on. I'm vegan so didn't add cheese. This dish didn't really need it. I believe that ingredient could be listed as (optional) It's not even mentioned in the directions.

Loved this!!  Served it for a crowd and all liked it.  I left out the Parmesan and it tasted fine, and saved on calories.

For butternut squash, I thought this was a really good.  The recipe fails to mention using the parmesan.  I grated some over the top before cooking the last 15 minutes and then grated more after it came out.  I didn't use parsley, otherwise, I cooked as stated (though might have been light on the amount of squash - it covered the bottom of a 2 qt. dish).  Will definitely make again, as the family ate it up.

Yummy!  The next day was even better... I fried up some bacon pieces until crisp, and then reheated the squash in the pan with it for a kind of hash, and had it with eggs.  The sweet squash with the smokey bacon was just amazing!  I'll have to make this again just to have the leftovers.

Love it! I even forgot the Parmesan last time I made it, but it was still delicious. Mine usually takes 35 minutes in a 400 oven. Great as a leftover, too.

I am rating this 5 stars b/c of the taste, however, the recipe doesn't state WHEN to add the parmesan cheese, and so I added it w/ the rest of the ingredients at the beginning...this caused the cheese to get "sticky" (that is the best I can describe it) but I think the parm cheese should have been added maybe the last 15 minutes or so.  It was still very good, just a little messy.  Next time I make this, I will add the cheese towards the end.  **EDIT**  I made these again WITHOUT the parm cheese, and I actually think they were better that way!  I couldn't get enough of them!  YUMMO!

I was expecting a big cheesy, garlicky punch, but the squash was kind of bland.  The squash sort of collapsed on itself --  didn't look at all like the picture.

I know I must have done something to screw this up because it came out rather dry and bland.  I can't really blame the recipe but it doesn't give a size for the squash or tell you when to put the parmesan cheese on.  I put the cheese on before baking like another reviewer recommended.  I also followed another reviewer's advice and baked it at 425 for 25 to 35 minutes.  I had a pretty large squash so I maybe should have doubled the mixture to toss it in.  I would like to try this again but even my hubby thought it was bland.

I make this about once every two weeks in the fall and winter now.  We LOVE it.  I never use the parsley however - not that I'm anti parsley, just don't have it on hand.  Also, I do 425 for about 25 minutes.

Ahhh so good...exactly what I was looking for. I did omit the parsely other than that...this was amazing. The squash got all nice and browned and the cheese a little crispy in spots. Just delicious and very easy. Thanks!

This was great.  It's 76 degrees and sunny with a cool breeze and I'm eating my first "fall" dish of the year.  I'm going to have to try hard not to eat this all by myself.  I'll definitely make this again (and again).

I make this recipe all the time. The only change I make is that I use Jarlsberg Swiss Cheese instead of Parmesan. It melts nicely and forms and crunchy crust along the edges of the pan that we all enjoy!

Wow, believe it or not, I have never had butternut squash until tonight.  Despite it being a time consuming chore to peel the squash, this recipe made it worth the time and effort!  Somebody gave me the squash out of their garden and I had no clue how to prepare it.. this was wonderful tasting and so simple!

Delicious and very easy to throw together!! I needed a veggie dish and this was the perfect complement. The recipe doesn't state when to add the parmesan (do you mix in, sprinkle on top before baking or garnish?) so I decided to sprinkle it on top before baking. It turned out WONDERFULLY! I will definitely be making this again!

I don't cook squash much so I didn't have much to compare it to.  However my husband loved it.  Will definitely do again.

I'll be making this again. I used frozen squash that I steamed (such a timesaver being chopped already) then went on with baking it with the below ingredients. Definitely add all the garlic. I baked mine with some added brown sugar on tip along with some cream cheese chunks. It was fabulous!!

I bought a butternut squash on sale - had never made it before.  My husband took a small token portion prepared to hate it- but made all kinds of yummy sounds while he ate it.  Very, very good. This doesn't tell you how to deal with the parmesan, so I added it halfway through the baking time.

This was pretty good.  Parm didn't really do anything for it in my opinion (I tried it before and after the cheese).  I would only cook it 30-40 minutes next time.

My first time working with butternut squash and it was delicious! I nuked it in the microwave (for too long because it was too hot to handle) but it made for easy peeling and cutting. Used four cloves of garlic and lined the baking pan with foil. Mine cooked for probably over an hour - after the first 30 minutes, I kept going in 7-8 minute increments, checking for a good texture. Got lots of compliments and will definitely make this again!

This was really good. It reminded me of hash browns.  It was great straight from the oven, but when it sat and got soft it wasn't as good.  Next time, I'll reheat in the oven w/o covering it.

This was such a delicious and easy casserole to appear. I actually had it easier as my grocery store carries frozen, cut and peeled squash. I didn't change a thing. But I did have leftovers as my husband had to work late and didn't make it home for supper. So I took the leftovers and pureed them adding chicken broth til it was a texture for soup. It was fantastic!!! So easy!! I'm making it this week for friends for dinner as a soup. Yum!

OH MY GOODNESS! This was so yummy! An awaking to the taste buds. No need to change a single thing as I don't think it can get any better then this. I love butternut squash and was looking fro a new way to cook it and just my luck to find a great recipe and even better with how simple and quick it is to put together. This is a keeper!!!!

The squash, garlic, and cheese is a strange combination.  I wanted to try this out because it was different than the usual way to prepare squash and I wanted something on my Thanksgiving table that wasn't either sweet or bland like the other dishes.  But this tastes as "unusual" as it sounds.  Sorry, it's not for me.

I made this for Thanksgiving using 2 pounds of cubed, fresh butternut squash from the market.  Since I only had about half the squash the recipe called for I only used 1T of olive oil, but kept everything else the same.  Everyone loved it and it was super easy to prepare.  I think it would be good with a little onion added and will try that next time.  I would also add a little more cheese - but it could definitely be made without it.

Just made this tonite and it was fantastic! I am on a no carb diet and this was better than potatoes. I have never really had much squash before except when sweetened with brown sugar so this was a great change.  Can't convince husband to like squash though but that's ok. He can have his plane old potatoes! I am going to bring this to our family Christmas gathering & hope not to many people like it - more for me!

This tasted great and was so very easy to make. I didn't have any parsley, so I skipped that ingredient and added a few extra cloves of garlic. Since not specified, I included the parmesan with the other ingredients when tossing / coating the squash. I had a sirloin roast roasting in the oven so I just popped it in with that. It ended up in the oven for about an hour and 20 minutes at 350F. Maybe a little longer than it needed, as some of the edges were turning a little darker brown, but it was none the worse for wear and tasted great! I will definitely do it again.

This was absolutely fabulous.  I have avoided squash in the past but no longer!  Not too greasy, just a hint of sweetness, and packed with flavor.  Thank you for this recipe- no changes required.

I made this recipe for dinner last night. It was absolutely delicious! Like other reviewers, I increased the garlic to 3 cloves and added the parmesan cheese about 30 minutes later. I have decided to add this as a side dish for my Thanksgiving dinner.

What a great combination of savory and sweet!  My husband is a huge fan of butternut; I'm a recent convert (due to dozens in our garden).  We both loved this version!  I started it at a lower temperature, only because I was roasting a chicken.  Turned it up to 400 after the chicken was done, added the parmesan at that point and cooked about 15 minutes more.  Otherwise, I didn't change a thing. He said it's a keeper (and he's real picky)!

Excellent! I love squash and have been looking for a recipe that isn't sweet.  I also love garlic, so this was perfect!! Thanks for the great recipe! I agree with the reviewer who recommended putting it under the broiler for a minute or so.

WOW!!!  This is GREAT.  The only hard part is cutting and pealing the squash but it is well worth it.  I did double the garlic as another suggested and I baked a bit longer - - to get the top crispy.  Next time I will put under the broiler for a min or two.   This was so good - i could have eaten this as the entire meal.  thanks for the recipe.

Made this for a fall-themed dinner with friends and it was enjoyed by all. I added an extra clove of garlic and a little garlic salt before baking, and added most of the parm about half way through (saving some for fresh out of the oven). Very easy and delicious!

This was pretty good, but not good enough to go through the work of peeling the squash, that was a horrible process and I will not make again.

This is my absolute FAVORITE way to make butternut squash ever since I found this recipe. It is delicious and ridiculously quick & simple. Gotta love that! I usually double the garlic, but that's just how I am. :) We love the combination of flavors in this dish. There is never a morsel left in the pan whenever I serve this up. Thank you SO much for this recipe!  :)

We loved this, really easy and simple but looks and tastes great.  I used thyme instead of parsley (I'm allergic). I baked for 45 minutes and it came out wonderful.  Thanks for a quick and easy dish.

OUTSTANDING RECIPE. Served this with grilled boneless pork chops and grilled apples. What a great combination and flavors. This is a healthy recipe which I used Sugar Twin brown sugar replacement and it turned out great. I also had roasted garlic on hand so I used that. This was a fabulous addition to our meal and a recipe I will use many times. I am going to make a big batch of this and put it in small containers in the freezer so it is available to compliment our meals and be a healthy choice.

This was fantastic! I also doubled the amount of garlic and added half of a chopped onion. I also added the Parmesan at the beginning and sprinkled more on top when it came out of the oven. I will make this all the time!

Love this, I used spaghetti squash and cut it in wedges, added a touch more garlic and olive oil, covered tight and cooked for 1 hour.  Cooked perfect!  This is easy and tasty so I'll cook squash more often.  Served this with Chicken Cacciatore everyone loved it.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner and it was good, but needed a bit more seasoning, also the recipe didn't really say when to add the cheese so I mixed it in with the other ingredients and doubled the amount.

Every thanksgiving I make this but with a twist. I add feta cheese 5 minutes prior to taking it out of the oven. Let me tell you, this is a great alternative to your typical  sweet yam/potato recipes.

Very good flavor.  Would definitely recommend microwaving squash first, as suggested by others, to ease the peeling and chopping process.  Goes very well with blander side dishes.  I've even served it over rice, as its flavor goes a long way.

I loved the combination of flavors.  This was my first time using Butternut Squash, and I really liked it.
Warning: Butternut Squash is kind of hard to peel and chop.  Slightly labor intensive...but worth it.

Great way to use up squash. And while I love the brown sugar/butter recipes too, this one was nice and different. I brought this lovely side dish to my friend's place. It went well with the chicken and rice dinner she made. I imagine it would go with almost anything.  Thanks!

I made it exactly as the recipe states.  My husband did not like his squash prepared this way.  He prefers baked squash with brown sugar & butter.  I liked it - especially the garlicky flavor. It is definitely a different way to cook squash and unfortunately will not make it again since only 1/2 of the people who ate it said they would eat it again.

I really liked this!  I have never had winter squash before, but I bought one and looked on allrecipes to find a dish.  We love garlic, so I thought we would like this, and we did!  Followed the suggestion to pierce and microwave the squash (8 min) for easy peeling, and it was still a little difficult to peel and the SMELL almost made me throw it away.  ICK.  But, I went through with it anyway, and it turned out great.  I added the parm 1/2 way through, and when the parm gets a little crispy, those were the BEST bites.  Yum.  THANKS!!

This was very good and very easy....it makes a lot too.  I really like the fact that there was no butter, cream, sugar, etc. involved and no getting out the mixer.  The garlic flavor was wonderful but I am still trying to figure out if the Parmesan cheese flavor worked well or not.....?  Next time I make it I may leave that out.  I served this with a green salad and Lloyd Rushing's BBQ rib recipe from this site-yum!

Absolutely excellent! Like other users mentioned, it does seem to cook faster than the 55 minutes so check it closely. And it smells amazing. A word of caution - when I tasted it, it seemed to need extra flavoring so I added some extra salt. Then I realized I hadn't added the parmesan yet (I used shredded and sprinkled it on when it was done). Don't be fooled if it seems a little bland on a initial taste test - more garlic and the parmesan take care of that.

I modified the original a little bit and it came out fantastic! I too, only baked it for 30 minutes. I also added finely chopped candied pecans and almonds and about a teaspoon of brown sugar. The sweetness mixed with the garlicky flavor turned out very nicely! Made an even better leftover with a bit of butter!

I'm giving this 4 stars because I really liked it but Grumpy didn't care for it at all.  I think probably because he's not used to savory seasonings with butternut squash. I would eat it again though and it smelled wonderfully garlicky!

It was a good recipe. The squash cooked in about 40 mins. The only change I made was to use powdered parmesan because I didn't have any fresh and I think it gave the squash a funny texture so next time I would definitely use fresh.

My husband said this was the best way I've cooked squash, ever.  I was worried at first because it smelled like salad dressing, but it was really good.  Next time I would toss the parmesan with the cubed squash instead of (or maybe in addition to!) topping with it. 

I started by piercing the squash and microwaving 8 minutes, before peeling.  This made it easier but a lot messier.  I mixed the other ingredients except the cheese in a little bowl and then poured it over the cubed squash in a big bowl.  I tossed it with my fingers then spread it in a shallow casserole and topped with the cheese.  I baked it for 30 minutes, then stirred it and baked another 15 minutes.

OMIGOSH!  I love this stuff!  My kids even love it.  It is growing on my husband.  I followed the recipe pretty much.  I peeled and cut the squash, put the pieces in a plastic bag with olive oil, garlic, and added a little sage and nutmeg and shook it up.  Then I poured it onto a foil lined baking sheet and salted and peppered it.  I baked it at 400 with no problems.  Every 10-15 minutes I took it out and picked up the ends of the foil to help me "stir" it without tearing the foil.  It only took about 35 minutes though.  I forgot to add the parmesan but I'm not sure it would be better with it.  This is awesome with Brussel Sprouts Lardons.  It is so nice to have another yellow/orange veggie to serve.  You gotta try it.

This is a great alternative to the sweet preparations of winter squash.  I left out the parmesan and it was still good.  I also used dried rosemary for the herb as I had no fresh herbs on hand.  I think you could definitely cut down on the oil and still have a tasty squash dish.

Very good. I made a few changes to this recipe. I boiled the squash for about 15 minutes first, for ease of peeling and cutting. I don't like parmesan cheese, so I substitued 1/3 cup mozzarella. After baking, I ended up mashing the squash, just because I like the texture better that way. 
  I will definately make this again.

I love this recipe, but prefer to saute the sqush rather than bake. Sage is wonderful with butternut squash and I highly recommended adding some for great variation.  Serve over seasoned penne pasta for a very filling meal.

This recipe is fantastic!  It was my first time baking butternut squash...and eating it also...so I did not know what to expect.  My husband and mother loved it too.  Did not have fresh parsley so I used dried parsley and I added more olive oil.  Baked at 375 for about 50 minutes.  Great tasting recipe :)

I love garlic and I love butternut squash, but I had never thought to combine the two.  This was really good.  I just halved the squash, scraped out the seeds/strings and drizzled with maybe a tablespoon of oil.  I was a little worried that the garlic would burn, so I covered the baking dish with foil and everything just steamed to perfection!  Oh, I also seasoned with dried thyme, salt & pepper as I had no fresh parsley.

My husband and I loved this dish!  I added extra garlic and omitted the cheese and cooked it for a wee bit longer.  The sweetness of the butternut squash was wonderfully highlighted in this dish.  Definitely a keeper!  Update:  I've now made this dish at least a dozen times for my family, friends, and co-workers, all of whom love it and ask for the recipe.  It's the best!!!  :-)  :-)

Oh Yum! I was skeptical so I only fixed half of the squash using this recipe. My husband and I both loved it. Slightly sweet, slightly salty, and a little zingy from the garlic and pepper. I mashed and candied the other half and gave my kids the option of sweet or salty squash. No brainer- they chose sweet, so I can't comment on how kid friendly this recipe is. But I'll defintely fix it again. To ease the prep, next time I'll pierce and cook the whole squash in the microwave for about 5 minutes. After cooling a bit it will be lots easier to cut and peel. *added note: tried again using microwave to prep and left skin on, turned out great, kids ate it though my husband preferred it peeled. Also as an experiment I just made this recipe using a jack-o-lantern. Not as sweet as the butternut but still yummy!

I used one large butternut in a 2 1/2 quart dish and made the recipe as stated.  It was wonderful.  My only problem was that the recipe didn't state when to add the parmesan, so I tossed it in with everything in the beginning.  I also stirred the squash twice during the baking.  Excellent!

This had a wonderful flavor to it, even reheated; ant this was my first experience cooking (and eating) butternut squash. I followed other reviewers' advice and adjusted the temp down and cooked for 35 min., but mine was still not tender enough, so I ended up cranking it up to 400 and leaving it in longer.

Good, easy way to prepare butternut squash. I didn't have fresh parsley so I used a couple of teaspoons of dried as well as some pinches of dried sage. I stirred the squash every 10 minutes or so which kept it from becoming burnt.

Nice savory flavor.  I marinated the squash first; covered it during baking.  Very moist and tender and as the title says, 'garlicky'.

This is a highly anticipated dish every Thanksgiving. Living out west, everyone is used to lots of spicy food. I use garlic powder in addition to minced garlic to coat the squash. Also, I don't measure out ingredients, I just go by what looks right. The only fail is not enough seasoning or parmesan. Overcooking is far better than undercooking time wise, but be sure not to burn extensively.

I'm always looking for vegetarian recipes for my husband.  Most squash recipes call for sugars, but this recipe is savory and has a wonderful texture.  This is my husbands favorite when we have squash around.  I rated this recipe a 5 because its easy to fix (MY FAVORITE) and for flavor.

Very good, much better then steamed or boiled.  I will either omit the parsley (my husband doesn't like it) and cook it as the recipe states, or substitute it with fresh sage, especially if cooking with chicken/turkey.

This is my new favorite way to eat butternut squash!  Used dried parsley instead of fresh but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  So good!

First time making butternut squash... This recipe is fantastic! Simple and easy (other than dicing up the squash... any easy way to do this?). It will be a regular rotation now. I didn't add the cheese and still loved it. I'll try with the cheese one of these days too.  Thanks!!

I thought this recipe was a mushy, bland disaster, until I salvaged it by tossing the squash with whole wheat spaghetti (and two tblspns butter, which benefits squash immensely).  I had already doubled the garlic, but after tasting the partially cooked squash (very bland and too sweet) I sprinkled it with shichimi (a complex Japanese pepper) and finished the bake.  I smashed a few of the softest pieces of squash to mix in with the spaghetti and the oil from the baking dish, tossed in fresh parsley and more Parmesan, topped the plated spaghetti with chunks of squash. It was delicious.  However, served by itself and baked according to directions, I would not find this dish edible.

I microwaved  a 20 oz package in a covered dish for 10 min.  Very tasty and easy to fix.  Next time I'll try it with some baby spinach mixed in and maybe some craisins.

Fantastic! Loved it! I've never had butternut squash before and didn't know what to expect. This is delicious! The squash is soft & sweet and the Parmesan adds a crunchy saltiness to it that compliments it so well! It was like a burst of different flavors and textures in my mouth, my taste buds savored them! I followed another reviewers advice and put the cheese in half way through baking and I didn't have fresh parsley so used dried parsley. This will definitely become a staple in our household.

This is an easy recipe and it was absolutely delicious!  I didn't have fresh parsley on hand, so I used dry parsley and it was just fine.  I also didn't add the cheese until a few minutes before I was ready to serve.  An excellent vegetarian dish!

I used the recipe for 10 people. One squash was exactly enough. I used cilantro instead of parsley and it was delicious. I will not use the Parmesan cheese next time. It was a great dish for my guests!

This was so good!! Added an extra clove of garlic, a little onion and garlic powder, and was a bit generous with the salt and pepper. Baked for 45 minutes. The cheese is not necessary. Definitely making this again!!

I was ready to not like this dish.  I don't like squash as a rule, and when I read the negative reviews I knew I wouldn't like it.  Someone had given me a butternut squash and I felt that my family should be exposed to more vegetables, so I made the dish.  We LOVED it.  My whole family ate two helpings.  It tastes more like sweet potatoes than squash and the garlic was perfect. I liked it better than if it had brown sugar. Perfect dish!!

This was divine.  Hubby who usually does not care for sweet flavored savory foods said this was the best dish I had made during thanksgiving.

I stirred it half way through and added the cheese 10 minutes before the end.

This was great! I've never had butternut squash before so I didn't even know what to do with it. I had my husband to cut the squash and I did the rest of the work. Next time I will try to microwave it first like other users suggested. I forgot to add cheese and even without that it was great. Both my husband & I loved it. It is a great side dish. I served it with grilled chicken breast. It was done in about 1/2 hour.

I was searching for a different recipe for butternut squash (something different than soup or risotto!) and found this delicious recipe. My sister and I loved it. We didn't have 3 1/2 pounds so we halved all of the ingredients, except garlic and we  used dried parsley instead of fresh; couldn't even tell. We thought 1 tbs of oo wasn't enough so added another and turns out, 1 would have been fine!

This recipe was delicious! I added the Parmesan cheese during the halfway point since the recipe didn't specify. The squash was tender in 50 minutes, and in the last 5 minutes I set my oven to broil for a nice, toasty, brown top.

Thought I hated squash till I made this recipe. Now I crave it. We took this one step further and made it into soup. YUM! I added a little more salt and pepper to taste. You can cream the soup with milk cream or even cream cheese.

I follow this recipe exactly.  Even the non-butternut squash eaters absolutely love it.  A favorite in my house, and out.

A nice alternative to traditional butternut squash in its pureed form. Made it for Thanksgiving dinner and my family raved-- especially loved the garlic. I only give it 4 stars because I thought it was good but not excellent.

This was tasty and smelled very good. The cooking time is off. I missed the "just tender" period and the squash turned mushy. Will cook again.

This was really, really great. I used a bit more olive oil because I had a bit more squash, and I used vegan Daiya 'mozzarella' cheese which I put on once it was out of the oven. Delicious.

I am in the process of making this dish right now.  Right away I have some problems w/ the recipe itself.  How big is the average squash?  I think this should be addressed.  Also, since this is my first attempt at using a butternut, I didn't think about how to get the rind (?) off until after I had cut it in half.  Luckily I found some kind of directions for that online.  Also, at what point are we supposed to put the Parmesan cheese in?  I'm going to take a guess that it's towards the end.  Wish me luck, I hope it tastes good!

ABSOLUTELY delicious.  My husband, who normally does not like squash, LOVES this recipe.  I added more garlic and sometimes substitute oregano for parsley, but either way its great!

My 8 year daughter saw what I was making and declared she would not eat it.  At dinner she took a bite and said, "Hey, this is good!"  She ate her entire helping before anything else on her plate.  My hubby & daughter gave a thumbs up, so we will be making this again! I used reviewer remarks and stirred along the way and added Parmesan about 15/20 minutes before I took it out of the oven.  And yes, nice aroma in the kitchen!

So delicious! I read the other reviews and baked it at 350 instead for 50 minutes and it was pretty much perfect. I also didn't have parsley, so used basil instead. it was awesome. Probably would have used more garlic and cheese though, even though I used 3 cloves...

This was delicious! I used herbes de provence instead of parsley and it tasted fabulous. Next time I will broil it for a few minutes at the end to make it more crispy.

This was delicious. I am always looking for recipes that I can serve to my vegan son and this was perfect, I just left the parmesan cheese off. When I make it again I'll cut the salt a little but otherwise I love it.

I didn't care for this recipe at all.  Came out tasting strange to me.  I think it may be because I just overall prefer the sweet taste of squash, vs. this recipe which is more savory.

Followed the recipe as written except I added a dash of cayenne.  This was delicious!  It did stick to the pan, so I might try spraying the pan next time.  Other than that, we all loved it!

This is a tasty recipe!  I decided to bake for 30 min, turn off the oven, then leave the dish in the oven for an extra 20 min (Letting the residual energy cook it through).  I also substituted with Asiago cheese.

I love garlic, so this was a no-brainer for me.  It was very good, and nothing needs to be changed with this recipe!  I did overcook it but it was my fault (got distracted making other foods).  Still yummy, just a little more soft (I imagine that it would have been just as good to whip these up and serve them mashed).

Oh MY....how awesome was this?!  I followed a few others' suggestions & cut the squash in smaller pieces, set the oven @ 375 deg, stirred every 15 minutes, and sprinkled with parmesan cheese 10 minutes before it was done; total cooking time was 50 min.  YUM!

This was super-yummy.  Modified to replace the parsley with fresh basil - really nice taste.  I ended up cooking it for about an hour, and included grated parmesean/romano in the dredging process.  Helps to keep the sizes of the squash pieces uniform.  Would also be good with some melted shredded cheese on top.

Thought this recipe was a delicious change from all the sweet butternut squash recipes ot there.  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect.  I might try adding some shredded asiago cheese next time but I will definitely make this again.  I served it with stuffed breaded pork chops and steamed asparagus spears--Yummy:-)

Great recipe! I've never eaten or cooked butternut squash. Tastes alot like sweet potatoes to me.  Difficult to cut the squash, but such a great side or main dish!

I am going to make this tonight for a third time . . . I have baked it according to the recipe and have also cooked it in my small crockpot for 4 hours.  Great as lunch the next day too.  This recipe was the first time I've cooked squash and it was so easy and delicious.  My familyl loved it ! ! ! !

Just made this with dinner and all I can say is YUM! I think I ate half the squash myself. The only change I made was using dried parsley because I don't have any fresh. I baked it at 400 for 35 - 40 minutes and its perfect.

As others have said, this is very good the first time around, and the left-overs are AMAZING when blended with some chicken stock and milk for a wonderful soup.

My boyfriend absolutely LOVED this dish that even my college budget can handle! I cubed the squash the day before into smaller pieces and stored it. I also did 2/3 of a cup parm cheese, 3T of pre-minced garlic, 2 T of parsley flakes, and 1T of italian seasoning for the olive oil. I cooked it at 375 after reading many of the reviews. Did it for about 30min and then topped with more cheese and baked for another 20. This recipe was so easy that I had dinner ready an hour after my night class ended!

I usually make candied squash, but I'm trying to cut down on my sugar intake so this recipe worked perfectly for me. It was very fast as easy (as far as squash is concerned). I found that with the salt and the parmesan it was a bit too salty for me. Next time I try it I'll leave out the salt.

Sorry, but I followed this recipe to the letter and it just didn't do it for me.  My husband usually likes just about everything I make and he didn't even like it.  The combination of flavors taste too garlicky or something.  I think I like this type of squash on the sweet side.

I made this for a dinner party i hosted.  I used 3 cloves of garlic.  I would make this dish again and only use 2 cloves.  It overpowered the mild flavor of the squash.  Very easy dish that looks like you spent hours on it.

This was Delish! My Hubby, who doesn't normally eat squash of any type, tried and really liked this! it has wonderful flavor and was easy to prepare. Another way to get the family to eat healthy! Be careful when peeling your squash, the skins are tough! God's Blessings

this is a fantastic recipe! however- don't pay any attention to the quantities for the spices and olive oil. i tend to at least double most of the ingredients listed (such as the garlic and olive oil) and it turns out spectacularly. this is now the only way my family will eat their butternut squash!

Remarkably simple yet flavorful and delicious. I added salt to taste, onions and sprinkled the top with couscous to absorb moisture (this probably wasn't necessary but I thought it might add nice texture since I was making it with couscous anyway). I paired this with Moroccan Couscous since someone suggested a couscous pairing and I could not find a better recipe. The couscous was delicious as was this one, but I'm not sure the flavors were complementary. It was all so delicious we didn't care.

SO SO GOOD! It was the only dish that was gone after our Thanksgiving in January. I didn't change a single thing about it. I used shredded Reggiano Parmesan, but added it halfway through the cooking time to prevent it from burning, then added more when it came out of the oven. I was even asked for the recipe. Delicious!

Love it! The spices make it so that I can't stop eating it, and the texture is perfect--soft on the inside but with a bite on the outside.

Absolutely delicious!  I have made this dish several times, and each time it gets rave reviews from my guests.  And there is never any left over!  It is easy to make with just a quick prep time, and then bakes in the oven - very low effort for an excellent dish.

In my opinion there's 2 schools of winter squash: Sweet and savory.  Sweet being the butter-and-maple-syrup-like applications, and savory being the herb and nut application.  This dish was an AMAZING savory squash dish, even without the parm.  Will try next time with rosemary in place of parsley for a nice variation.

Super easy and delicious!!!! Garlic with sweetness of the squash turned out to be a fantastic combination. Perfect for toddlers.

I added more garlic, traded parsley for rosemary and skipped the parm cheese.  I nuked it for 5 min before peeling and cubing so it only needed about 35 min cook time.

I wish I could give this recipe 10 stars! I made it the night before so all the ingredients melded together, it smells so good even before cooking. I added a little extra garlic because my family loves garlic, also some extra parsley.

One of the few recipes that is PERFECT exactly how it is. My family couldn't figure out how squash could taste so good! Made it for Thanksgiving and it was requested for Christmas--that's a first!

delicious and simple! I didn't even measure anything, I just put in a bit of garlic salt (didn't have minced), pepper, a tiny bit of oil, salt, and parm cheese and mixed. It was awesome, my husband even loved it!

I was not expecting much from this because I do not like butternut squash, but WOW!! It's delicious!!!   Next time I make this I will be using less oil because it was a little too oily for me. But I can't wait to make it again!! YUMMMMM!!!

I made this dish for Thanksgiving dinner and it was so very, very good!  I wanted to try this because I cook my sweet potatoes in a similar way.  I didn't add the parmesan because I have a nephew that is allergic to dairy but it was really fantastic without it (although I can't wait to try it with the cheese too!).  The simple flavors come together so well.  Other people at dinner liked it as well.

I've made this recipe twice, and once it was perfect, the second time way too much garlic! I'm not sure what was different, but perhaps the squash was a bit smaller the second time. Either way, the recipe is delicious!

I thought this was great, but my 12 year olds weren't fussy on it.  I mixed butternut squash and sweet potatoes, added about 1 Tbsp. of fresh thyme and it doesn't say what to do with the cheese, but I mixed it in in the last 5 minutes of cooking.

This was so simple and delicious I had to rate it a 5.  I added the cheese about 10 minutes before taking out of the oven.  I diced the squash fairly small so it took about 40 minutes to cook.

Wonderful recipe.  Wonderful flavor.  I cooked 5 squash and froze then.  Will use some for squash soup and some for side dishes.  Really love the garlic flavor.  Forgot to put in the parmesan, but it is great without it. Hope to remember to add some when I reheat it.

This is a fantastic recipe, i've made it several times, taken it to potlucks, etc and it is always a favorite. I get asked for the recipe every time!  I once tried to take a short cut and use the frozen cubed butternut squash, and it just didn't have the flavor of fresh, so I would not recommend using anything else.

This was a huge hit with my 86 year old mother who is hard to please! It did take me a little longer than 10 minutes to prepare since I had never "peeled" a butternut squash before.  I used lemon grapeseed oil, added an apple, and a few chopped walnuts; cooked a total of 50 minutes and stirred in the grated parmesan since the recipe didn't specify when to add it. DELICIOUS! Will be a regular in my repertoire.

I tried this recipe for a change from our typical  br. sugar and butter style. We liked it - I guess I would have to to play with it again sometime. Its just hard to think you're getting ready to take a bite of squash----and it wasn't sweeten!?

I just made this tonight and the whole family loved it.  I had to force feed it to my kids but as soon as they tasted it they liked it.  My husband does not normally like squash or winter squash and he loved this.  This would make a fantastic and impressive side to any dinner party.  I made the recipe exactly as stated.  I did microwave the squash first just to make it easier to cut.

I love butternut squash, I love garlic, I love cheese.  How can you go wrong?  Sometimes we add a 12oz package of browned spicy italian sausage to the mix and serve this as a main dish, too.  Fantastic!

This was good. I cooked at 375 for about an hour, stirred about every 15 minutes and lined the pan with non-stick foil. I liked this, but I think I prefer sweeter squash dishes.

This was awesome!! It only took 45 mintues for me.  40 mintues probably would have worked too.  I stirred the squash about halfway through and added parmesan in the last 10 mintues. Yummo!

I was excited to try a new squash recipe but this just didn't meet my expectations.  While good, it does have a lot more "savory" taste and I like mine sweet (usually with maple syrup or brown sugar).

When are you supposed to add the cheese? With the oil mixture or at the end? Liked this, did not love it. A little too salty, didn't love the parmesan cheese with butternut squash.

I used a combination of butternut squash and carrots. I used marble cheddar instead of Parmesan because I didn't have any; it would seem the cheese added more to the salty taste and took away from the delicate flavour of the squash. I added some crushed corn flakes hoping for some "crunch" but once again the cheese just made them mushy. Not a favourite, and I won't be making this again.

I am not sure why this wasn't quite our thing. We are used to butternut squash with just a little butter and salt and pepper, or made with a sweet sauce, so I think the garlic was just a little too much. I felt like I couldnt taste the squash. I did serve it to my friend, who said it was great, so I passed the recipe on to her.

This was a great recipe, especially for just when the weather starts to get cold. I added my own little twist: I added about a half a cup of brown sugar and substituted one tablespoon of the olive oil for butter. It turned out absolutely delicious! My boyfriend never had squash before and he claimed the leftovers before his second helping! I did cut the pieces much smaller and cook it at 375 for about 45 min. I live at a high altitude so that might change for a lower altitude. (also second time around I put way too much garlic in, don't make that mistake!!)

Everyone loved this recipe.  I didn't measure anything, and was able to make an awesome side dish.  I sprinkled the cheese on top and put it back in the oven for 5 minutes to melt it.  AWESOME!!

Very 'buttery-nutty'!  A fabulous dish.  Our kids thought it was a potato dish until I told them it was butternut squash!  I added the cheese half way through and roasted for 40 minutes because we like squash a bit more firm.  It was perfect, and very pretty, too!

It was really good.  The recipe doesn't specify when to add the Parmesan cheese.  I added it while cooking and that was a mistake since a lot of the cheese, garlic and parsley stuck together.  Now I know to add the cheese after I take the squash out of the oven.  It was still very delicious!

This recipe is fantastic! It's light yet fulfilling, enabling it to pass for a main dish or a side easily. This was the first time I had had butternut squash, and it has a lovely flavor, kind of a mix of pumpkin and cantalope. The only change I made was to leave out the Parmesan because I'm lactose-intolerant, but I think that it was delicious regardless.

This wasn't my favorite butternut squash recipe and I was a little disappointed in the end result. I think it needed both to cook longer and more "oomph" to it since I found it to be a bit bland. It looked amazing out of the oven but I ended up throwing a lot of it out.

So good! The whole house smelled so lovely while it was baking.  I tried it with regular potatoes too, good but not great like with squash.  I suggest more parmesan cheese but that's all.  Good and easy, my favorite!

Delicious! I followed the recipe as given. Next time I'll probably up the amount of garlic and thyme, maybe add rosemary. It could be more herbed.

Mmmm... fantastic.  Worth the hassle of peeling the squash.  I took the advice of another reviewer and microwaved the squash first which made the job much easier.

This is one of my new favorite recipes!  I had bought all the ingredients, and when making it, didn't read when the parm was used... so I ended up not adding it by mistake.  However, it was so fantastic without that I tried it the second time... but decided it was not necessary.  I have added extra garlic to my version as well.  So delicious and so healthy.  I could eat the entire dish myself!

This recipe was okay.  It had a very different flavor.  It was just a little weird I guess.  I'm not sure parmesan and garlic really compliment butternut squash.  It wasn't really a bad recipe however I don't think I'll be making it again.

No squash fans in my house, but we've been trying to eat more veggies. I made this tonight and watched in absolute shock as my husband and both kids ate this without complaint. Even seconds for my husband. Shocked and amazed! I kept to the recipe exactly and used fresh parmesan.

Absolutely delicious!  This is a great alternative to traditional ways of serving butternut squash.  I prepared the recipe in a 2.5 qt baking dish, figured I would save myself from washing a bowl.  I used 5 or 6 cloves of garlic - we LOVE garlic.  I stirred it after 20 min of baking, and added a bit more parmesan to the top after it was done.  I am on a bit of a diet right now - and this healthy alternative to potatoes was fantastic!  Add a chicken breast on the side - mmmm-mmmm!!

I used this recipe with a bag of cubed frozen squash.  I'd never used frozen squash before and found that after 30 min on a baking sheet it was cooked but pretty mushy, so I scraped it all into a casserole dish trying to keep the cubes, topped it with a sprinkling of cheese and broiled until the top browned a bit - it was GREAT, the flavor is perfect!  I will make with fresh next time but it's a easy cheap dish to make with a bag of the frozen kind.

This was absolutely fabulous!!  I found some pre-cut butternut squash at Costco, so I didn't have to hassle with cutting it up.  The sweetness of the squash combined with the garlic and olive oil were amazing!  I substituted italian seasoning for the parsley, as some other reviewers suggested substituting basil.  I forgot the cheese and my husband and I loved it - I can't wait to taste it with the cheese!!

Made as my contribution to Thanksgiving dinner today. Everyone loved it; I didn't change anything. Will definitely make again, but will try the microwaving trick to hopefully make peeling easier.

Everyone liked it. I made it a squash medley because I didn't have enough butternut squash. I also put the squash in the oven for 15 minutes to make it much easier to peel and cut. That takes the most time.

Only okay.  The squash baked well, but the mix of flavors didn't really seem appropriate to me--the squash is just too sweet to try to make it into a savory dish, in my opinion.

This was very, very good. 5 stars from everyone in my family, including my 2 picky kids. I used dried basil in place of the fresh parsley. So delish that I plan to add it to my Thanksgiving menu. Thanks for the recipe!

YUM.  I can't swear to the proportions I used (only had half a squash, didn't measure stuff), but used three cloves garlic.  Substituted dry parsley for fresh, and sprinkled on parmesan cheese about five minutes before taking this out of the oven.  Then stood at the counter and ate half the dish.  This is WAY better than the sweet/creamed version of butternut squash!

This was wonderful.  I followed the recipe as is, and was very pleased that I didn't change a thing!  However, I stirred every 15 min. to prevent the burn that others experienced.  Also, 45 min. was sufficient.

This is going to be my new thanksgiving squash. It's definately thanksgiving good! I wasn't sure when to add the cheese so i added it about half way through cooking. I made exactly as written and cooked a little over an hour (maybe i cut the squash a little too large) thank you for the fantastic recipe.

Very tasty!  If you cut the pieces smaller (1/2 inch cubes) it cooks in less than 40 minutes.  I used dried basil instead of the parsley (didn't have any on hand) and it turned out great.

We really liked this recipe. I left out the parmersan cheese because I'm trying to cut dairy out of my diet. Even without the cheese it was great. I made it as a side with steaks and salad. I will definately make it again.

Easy -- very little prep and no real time watching over it.  Healthy and tasty, what more can you ask for?  Rosemary instead of parsley adds a nice touch.  And we don't like sweet squash dishes, so this was great.  Thanks!

This was just okay.  I followed the directions exactly.  I assumed you put the parmesan cheese on it.  I thought it was okay.  My kids didn't like it.  My husband said it was just okay.

Loved this recipe! It was so easy to make and yet so tasty. I did add the parm about half way through the cooking and then it got all crunchy and yummy on the top. Fantastic and it will be made again and again.

I'd give it 3, but 4 because it took about 5 minutes to get into the oven.  400 was too hot, and it singed everything a bit.  375 would have worked fine for the suggested cooking time.  Also, put the parm on right when you take it out of the oven.  That long in the oven will burn the cheese.

I really wanted to like this recipe, but it just didn't turn out good at all. While it didn't look dry, it tasted very dry and the flavor just wasn't to our liking. I might try again, but will try to cook it for less time (maybe cooking until soft takes too much out of the veggie?).

I thought this was pretty good - interesting combination of flavors.  I can't say I would make it on a regular basis, but it's nice for a change of pace now and then.

I would give this 5 stars but it didn't go over well with my husband.  He grew up with butternut squash cooked with brown sugar and thought it was okay.  Personally I enjoyed a different way to cook butternut squash and will make this when he is on his next business trip.

I made a smaller portion size and just mixed it all up in the baking dish. Baked (covered) for about 20 minutes without parmesan cheese. Added the parmesan and broiled on low (uncovered) for five minutes. DELICIOUS! I'm going to try it with cauliflower next time.

Simple and delicious.  I used half the oil and added some vegetable broth, just enough for a thin layer at the bottom of the pan.  This kept the vegetables moist.  I also skipped the Parmesan cheese (not a fan) and increased the other seasonings instead.

You can add any other vegetables as you see fit.  I used carrots.

This dish is a real treat! Went over well at a family gathering during the fall season. I was more liberal with the amount of oil and cheese which tolerates the heat and cooking time. Also fresh whole cloves roast well mixed in....mmmmm!

my husband (who hates veggies) even loved this one!  the only thing we'll do differently next time is spread the pieces out (in a larger casserole dish) so they dry out more...neither of us liked the mushy pieces.  other than that this is a great, healthy side!

I must be butternut squash challenged, because I can't just cube it and go. Nevertheless, I did steam it in the microwave for about 10 minutes, cube away and then bake. It was very very good. Even my daughter who doesn't like my new experimental streak liked it. My friend at work loved it and demands I make more :)

I might still like sweet butternut squash better, but this recipe was great.  The squash came out the perfect consistency, it melted like butter in your mouth.  Well, except for the skins which I left on.  Made for a really nice additional texture.  I used only half the amount of squash for the  recipe which I think is why it came out super garlicky, which was a bit over powering.  I can't wait to try this one again with the right ratio of garlic to squash.

Extremely easy and delicious. I made it without the cheese (none in the house), but I think that the cheese would make it even better. I think next time I might try with a little less pepper, but I definitely liked it a lot.

Not one of our favorite recipes.  We usually love Butternut Squash but this was a waste of a good vegetable.  TOO much oil.  I'm going to try to save the leftovers and puree it into a soup....hopefully that will work!

This was good and tasty. It does take awhile to chop up the butternut squash. I have seen pre-chopped butternut squash at Trader Joe's. It would be very quick and easy to do with that. I did not have fresh parsley so I tossed in dried at the end of cooking along with the cheese.

Normally, I'm not biased by the texture of foods even if it is a new food, however, I just couldn't 'like' this recipe enough to plate it up.  I enjoy butternut squash in soups and casseroles, but I followed this recipe exactly and can't even see where to improve on with the ingredients and method described here.  I'll find something different to do with my remaining squash.

My husband and I really enjoyed this dish! I was looking for a more 'savory' way to cook butternut squash and this is it! I cooked the squash for 30 minutes and that was plenty of time. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

This is something really different.  I wasn't sure about the combination of flavors but it works.  It is definitely worth a try.

Very tasty and different from the norm.  We love garlic, and so it was perfect.  Very easy once the  squash is peeled!

I gave this 3 stars because it got mixed reviews in my house.  My mom and neice loved this.  They thought it was awesome.  My 5 year old tried squash for the first time on this recipe and liked it, but didn't want more than 2 cubes.  My hubby was caught drizzling honey over his...hee hee.  I just thought the flavor was a little off.  I doubt if I make this again.
