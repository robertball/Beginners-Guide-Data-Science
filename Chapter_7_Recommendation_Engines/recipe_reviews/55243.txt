AWESOME!!
I had some hungarian goulash at the cheesecake factory and decided to attempt it at home. It was absolutely wonderful!! Not too spicy, tender beef and exploding with flavor!!

Good authentic Gulasch (german spelling) 
recipe. There is also a soup, which we always made with oxtail. So the reviewer stating Goulash is a soup is 50% correct. We serve the Goulash with boiled potatoes (Salzkartoffel), rice and spaetzle. Truly a great fall and winter dish.

I was excited to try this recipe as I have not had great goulash since I lived in Europe in the early 90's.  I was a bit disappointed as it did not have the wonderful flavor that I remember.  The meat was tender and yummy but the sauce was lacking.

This was a good goulash recipe...I love the lemon zest in it. And yes, real goulash (at least the German) has lemon zest in it. I guess the other reviewer was thinking about gulaschsuppe. Thanks!

Wow!  Never made this before, but it was delish!  Had it with ww bread & butter because I could hardly wait to eat it.  Loved the lemon.  Had to sub cumin & coriander for caraway.  I made mine sort of 1/2 stew - 1/2 soup.  Oh, and lots more garlic.  Will definitely make again!  update:  very flexible and nummy recipe!

Thanks, Laulette. The "Goulash" turned out to be a flavorful soup. Although the traditional Hungarian Goulash recipe doesn't call for lemon, I really like the idea . By knowing that a hint of lemon doctores up all the flavors in a dish, it's only could be a good way to make "Gulyas". Yumm, I  recommend this "gulyas" to everybody.

How GOOD is this recipe?!  We loved this.  I maybe threw in a bit more caraway seeds and paprika than the recipe called for, but we both raved about this at dinner the other night.  We will be having this again, on a regular basis.  Thank you for this recipe!

The only one in my family that liked it was my 2yo.  Since we've never had Goulash before, I don't know if it was the recipe or the fact that we just don't like goulash.

Really good, the caraway seeds and lemon really make the difference in my opinion.  I was out of sour cream and used 1/2 a pack of cream cheese. Turned out great.

very similar to the way my mom used to make it, I Love it, and so does my family.  I didn't have any caraway so added a little thyme, i used more butter, more paprika, an extra clove of garlic, a little green pepper to use it up, and a dash of white wine :)  I also didn't have beef consomme, altho that's what i usually use, so i used chicken broth and cooked it in my wolfgang puck pressure cooker.  the lemon zest adds great flavor.Thanks!

My family loved this.  I also substituted olive oil and only used enough to cover the bottom of the dutch oven.  My husband is on a low salt diet and I only added 1/8th tsp. salt. We're used to low salt so that's probably too little for most people.  Having said that, it's hard for us to find recipes that taste good without much salt, but this was fantastic!

2.17.16  Really liked the subtle lemon flavor in the background (doesn't overwhelm) of this goulash.  Added more paprika and caraway seed (personal taste preference) and some sautéed baby portabella mushrooms which needed to be used up.  Only one comment:   it takes a lot longer than 1-1/2 hours for the beef to really tenderize.  I cooked mine for 2-1/2 hours to reach that fork-tender stage, but it was worth the additional time because this stroganoff was soooo good!

Yum! This is  perfection  on a dreary  blustery  winter's  day. The lemon  definitely  adds a  touch of brightness. A little  bit  of  fresh  parsley  would  be  a  nice  touch  sprinkled  on top. I'm  sure  this  is a new favorite. To make  the dish even  better  is that  it's  super  easy. Thanks  for  sharing!

Very easy and super tasty. I left out the lemon zest because I didn't have it and let it cook for about 2 hours so meat was very tender.
