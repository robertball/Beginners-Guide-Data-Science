Phenomenal!  love these potatoes.  I went on  a potatoe testing kick tonight and made 4 different types of mashed potatoes.  This was by far the shocker!!  Love it.  It tastes wonderful.  Not quite as fluffy as your traditional mashed potatoes, but the taste, Wow!  And it wasn't overpowering like a couple other recipies we tried.  Try em, you'll love it.

I added 2 onions instead of one, and instead of 1/2 teaspoon of cumin, I did 1 and a 1/2 and oh boy - this was really worth 5 stars!  So delicious.

These were really tasty and something completely unique. They would go great with some grilled chicken or fish!

Loved it.  Did end up adding some milk when I was mashing at the end.  Did not want to keep adding oil to make them creamy.  Great flavor!

Pretty good, a different take on mashed potatoes.  Bf just said "they're different".  He ate his full serving though, and agreed to have some with chicken for his leftover lunch tomorrow, so he liked them okay.  He did ask me if these were seasoned with saffron, and I think they'd be good that way--but I LOVE saffron.  Turmeric, which I like, but not as much, is a harsher flavor.  Nice idea, and it works pretty well, so I'd try with different seasonings.  I used red potatoes and didn't peel the skin--part laziness, part wanting the nutrition from it.  I prefer mashed potatoes with the skin anyway.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very tasty dish.  went very well with a Pork Tenderloin Wellington.  Everyone liked it and asked for the ingredients.  I added a bit more liquid to make them a bit softer, but otherwise wouldn't change a thing.

This recipe is amazing and so easy! Goes with lots of things and healthier than regular mashed potatos. I added extra cumin for added flavor but recipe is very good as is - I made this with Moroccan Chicken and everyone raved about the potatos!

Very nice.  Served with Cara's Moroccan Stew and with Moroccan Krsa, both from this site.  We cooked the potatoes in a slow cooker on low, but cooked the onions in a skillet, adding the seasonings as soon as the onions were cooked, then placing the onion mixture in the fridge until time to serve.  After removing some of the water, we simply mashed the potatoes, added a touch of instant mashed potato flakes (since we had slightly over cooked the potatoes in the slow cooker, so they needed something to balance out the extra moisture content which arises from over boiling... *oops!*, but nice catch anyway - - that trick always works wonderfully with any mashed T's that become soggy)......, and when the potatoes were just about the right consistency, we mixed in the onion mixture.  ****We did add extra oil**, which isn't ideal, but since we served it with Cara's Moroccan Stew, which had virtually no fat, and with the bread, which had virtually no fat, our meal was still significantly low fat, and by WW standards, was a meal which could be managed with low points, or higher points, depending on caloric need.  (the growing teenage boys had more carbs than those watching their waist lines, and so forth....., everyone but my daughter enjoyed the potatoes, though my husband likes the horseradish and caramelized onion mash potatoes from this site more than he likes these....  I like both equally well....., hmmm, there was a good bit of cream in the horseradish potatoes I served him..?)

Enjoyed the taste - I'm a fan of turmeric and cumin - but I like "traditional" mashed potatoes too much and so I'll probably stick with those in the future.  Thanks for the taste adventure.

Surprisingly tasty! I ended up using a touch of nutmeg and more cumin than tumeric. Kudos to the recipe creator!

This was excellent. We are on a sodium-restricted diet and I left out the salt completely. It was still outstanding. I let some of the onion get a little crisp and that seemed to add to it, too.

I brought this to a potluck and everyone loved it except for one small thing: it was a bit too salty.   I'm making it again tonight though- and anticipate a rave response!

Served these with the Moroccan shabbat fish recipe from this site. It was such a good side dish but I will add in garlic at least a few cloves chopped and cooked when I do the onions again.
