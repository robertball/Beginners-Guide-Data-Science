Quick and easy dinner...even easier when you use the crock pot.  I spray the inside of the crock pot with PAM and layer the chicken breasts on the bottom, then layer the cheese on top of chicken, top with milk and soup mixture and then top with dry stuffing and pour melted butter over stuffing, cover and cook 3-4 hours, longer if using frozen chicken breasts.  It seems as if the stuffing will be dry, but it is not...I had a friend who did not believe me and topped stuffing with more milk and soup mixture...very soupy...then she made it again without and very surprised...it was perfect.

Good, easy and basic chicken casserole recipe.  Per other reviews, I added half a bag of frozen chopped broccoli and used white wine instead of milk.  There are similar recipes out there like this but this one is by far the easiest...and with ingrediants you always have around!

Unbelievably good.  Per other reviewers suggestions, only made two changes.  Used two cans of condensed cream of chicken WITH HERBS mixed with milk (not wine) for more flavor and one whole box of Stove Top (6 ounce) chicken flavor stuffing.  Had sauteed mushrooms and shallots in the fridge from a previous meal and threw those in as well.  Absolutely wonderful!  Thanks Carolyn for a GREAT recipe.  Definitely a keeper in my rotation!!!

My family and I loved this casserole.  I added chopped broccoli to it and and chopped the chicken breasts into 1" chunks and it was delicious.  My only complaint is everyone enjoyed so much of it that there were hardly any leftovers for another meal!

I love this recipe for fast and easy.Lots of ways to change it up.To fancy it up for company,my version is chicken tenders,sprinkled with granulated garlic and fresh cracked pepper,topped with provolone and I use the cream of chicken with herbs(this adds plenty of flavor)and top with chicken stove top.Yummy...taste just like something you would get at an amish restaurant.

This was very very good!  I did make a few changes.  1st, I seasoned the chicken breasts with lemon pepper and garlic salt.  I used shredded cheddar cheese and covered the chicken breast well.  Regarding wine versus milk, I used both, half milk and half red cooking wine.  I mixed 1 cup of hot water with the stuffing mix and the butter.  Even my picky husband thought it was very good.  Thanks for this keeper of a recipe :)

This dish is so simple and very good!  I use the ingredients as listed but I find it simpler to melt the butter in a large bowl in the microwave, then toss together before adding to casserole.  I have yet to meet anyone who does not enjoy this dish.  Everyone will want the recipe.

Love this recipe! I use cream of mushroom soup and cornbread stuffing mix. Make sure to add enough milk to ensure that the stuffing is nice and moist... if it's crunchy when you put it on top it will stay hard and crunchy.

I was just in the mood for this sort of thing the other night... looking for a  taste of Thanksgiving without all of the work, and I got it in this simple recipe. I used milk, along with a generous splash of a decent sherry. Also used chicken tenders, sprinkled with garlic powder first, and added a bit of parmesan along with the swiss. For such little effort, the recipe produced rather tasty results. Thank you!

This was amazing! I had all the ingrediants already in the kitchen and it was so easy! The chicken was moist and wonderful. My husband went back for seconds! I made it exactly as the recipe said except I used a 13X9 pyrex dish and put foil over it while cooking. Next time I'll try it with white wine instead of milk as some reviewers have said.  Thanks!!

This is an all-time favorite comfort food casserole recipe in my family. We do one step different. We use a whole large cylinder container of the Stove Top Stuffing (we love the stuffing part) and we actually prepare it according to directions. Then we blanket it over the chicken, cheese and soup/water mixture. It keeps the chicken moist and tender. Cook for 90 minutes covered with foil, then remove the foil the last 3o minutes to make a crispy top.  We love it.

Instead of commercial cream soup, make your own cream sauce:  Sprinkle 6 T flour over some sauteeing (in 1 T EVOO) onions, mushrooms, celery if you have it, and stir.  Add gradually 3 c milk (preferably nonfat milk) and voila!  Your cream sauce.  Thin with white wine which adds to the "depth"; add whatever spices you like.

We loved this one.  I added a thin slice of honey ham inbetween the chicken breast and swiss cheese for flavor and color.

I have used this recipe for years and it is always a hit.  We serve it over rice and if you want a super rich sauce use heavy cream instead of milk.  Variations I have tried ... double the liquid and add dry rice to the bottom of the pan before adding the other ingredients ... use cheddar instead of swiss ...

after reading the recipe i must admit i shy away from any which call for condensed soip of any kind b/c of the sodium count - however i have found that a simple cream sauce makes a nice substitute and in most cases was MUCH tastier-- and the nice thing is you can control the salt recipe for a basic white sauce 2T butter- melted stir in 2T flour to make a roux and then whisk in 1+ milk try it !!

PLEASE READ.....My mom made this for my family growing up and here is the secret.  Use Peppridge Farms herb seasoned stuffing mix (crushed not cubed).  Use Albertsons brand processed swiss cheese.  Put chicken down, put a layer of cheese over the top (not one per piece of chicken but a layer over the top of them all.)  Then use TWO cans of condensed cream of chicken and 1/2 cup milk.  It took us 80 mins, we did 50 at 350 (wasnt long enough) then we did 30 at 375 and it was perfect.

I make this recipe a lot, it's easy and no fuss.  I used the Pepperidge Farms Herbed Crushed Stuffing mix, doubled the soup (low Sodium)added 1/2 C white cooking wine instead of the milk and sprinkle a little Rosemary on the breasts before adding the swiss cheese slices.  I also added fresh sliced mushrooms and a few frozen peas.  Dinner guests love it.

Great dish!!!! My entire family (husband and three children ranging from 2 to 10) loved it also. Minor modifications: 1) I seasoned chicken or turkey breasts (used 4 large breasts), 2) Chopped and sauteed a small to medium yellow onion in olive oil & butter, 3) Used one and one half cans of Cream of Chicken soup 4) Used the milk called for in the recipe, plus 1/4 cup of white wine (optional); 5) Mix all of the above ingredients with melted butter and stuffing (used Pepperidge Farm Herb Seasoned Stuffing). Mixed these all together which kept the stuffing moist. 6) Covered dish with foil and cooked. 7) Let sit for approximately 30 minutes. Served with cranberry sauce and steamed vegetables. Oh my goodness! This was such a moist and delectable dish. My family said this is a keeper; I agree. This dish would be great for a couple - or single person - that doesn't want to prepare a large meal for Thanksgiving or Easter. (You can also use shredded Swiss cheese vs slices).

Without reading everyone's reviews I made this exactly as written.  I found many things that could be changed to make this a better dish; I would pound my breasts to make them a bit thinner, I would remove the breasts from the pan after cooking and wisk the juices and the soup together, and I would DEFINITELY add enough stuffing mix so that the ENTIRE top of the pan/chicken would be covered with chicken.  These simply was not enough stuffing.  Also perhaps adding some veggies (broccoli comes to mind) .  All in all I don't think I'll make this again, and certainly not as written.

I've been making this recipe for years! It's actually in one my cook books that I've owned for over 15 years.  Funny, it's exactly the same recipe that's in the published cook book, except that it uses wine instead of milk.  Everyone that I've made this for loves it.  The milk gives it a bit sweeter flavor to the recipe than the wine does.  Over the years I have changed this recipe in little different ways.  Try sprinking some parmesan on top of the stuffing before drizzling it with the butter.  Add baby bella mushrooms to it.  It's been a favorite in  my house for many years now.

I made this for dinner last night with some changes based on previous recomendations and it was absolutely delicious!!  I only used 3 chicken breasts as there was 2 of us plus a child. I cut them into pieces, and sprinkled with sea salt, crushed pepper and garlic powder, then lightly browned with a handful of sliced mushroom.  I grated the swiss cheese and sprinkled some of it over the chicken and mushrooms, and the rest I added to the soup mix.  In addition, I kept the soup and milk amounts the exact same as the recipe called for, but added a 1/4 cup of white wine.  I saved a little of the soup mix to add to the stuffing to keep in nice and moist, and used about 1/2 the butter.  I don't usually like these one dish soup and stuffing dishes, but with the changes I made, it was so good that I would not hesitate to serve it to Company.  I really think seasoning the chicken and pre browning it, as well as the addition of the wine makes this dish.  Thanks for a great recipe base.

This was a crowd pleaser. Here's my changes- used provolone instead of swiss (personal preference. Put the stuffing on top of the chicken/cheese then put mixture of cream of celery soup. 1/2 cup chicken broth, and 1/4 cup sour cream. Omitted the butter. I really liked putting the stuffing first- THEN pouring the soup mixture over that, it really made the stuffing much better (not so dry and crunchy as opposed to putting it on top). Pleased my picky 5 year old, so will be making again!

After reading all of the reviews, I layered this in my slow cooker (greased)in the following order.  Diced raw chicken (I sprinkled with thyme and black pepper), swiss, 1/4 cup jack cheese, soup (Campbell's chicken and herbs) and wine mixture (wine used inst. of milk), then tossed a 1/2 c. melted butter with a bag of dry stove top stuffing and sprinkled it on top.  I cooked it on low for 4 hours, and it was perfect.  Mixed up a second one and my hubby cooked it in the breakroom at work from 8 to 12 for an employee lunch.  Everyone loved it, too!!  Thank you!!

I've been making this dish for years and it is definitely a family favorite.  The only thing I do differently is I use cream of mushroom soup instead of the chicken.  It's a matter of preference.  You can make this for a few or for a crowd.  And just think...you are not only baking your chicken, but you're getting your "starch" too.  It's soooo easy.

Very good recipe. I've found it works better for me if I mix the stuffing, soup, melted butter, and milk (1/2 cup)  together in a bowl first and let it sit while the oven is heating, just to allow the stuffing to absorb a little liquid. I then put a thin layer of stuffing on the bottom of the dish (sprayed with nonstick cooking spray), place the chicken and cheese on top of that, and cover the chicken pieces with the remaining stuffing. At least once while it is baking, I spritz the top with a no calorie butter spray, like I Can't Believe It's Not Butter, to be sure the stuffing remains moist. Quick, easy, very tasty.

This was very good. I made a few changes - I dusted the chicken in flour seasoned with salt, pepper, onion powder and paprika and then browned lightly in a bit of oil. i also added 1/4 cup of white wine to the soup. I used an oven-proof skillet and just topped with the lid and popped into the oven. I only baked for 30 minutes since I had already browned the chicken. Topped with freshly parsley and we really enjoyed it - will make again.

Wonderful recipe! Only changes I made were to pound the chicken breasts, and use white wine instead of milk. It just gives it something "extra" special. I also combine the melted butter & stuffing before sprinkling on top. My hubby LOVED this! And best of all, it's very cheap to make! A definate "comfort food"!

I could have written the same review at Joe B - I also have made this for years and it has always been a hit.  I also make it with white wine instead of milk.  It gives it more of a gourmet flavor. If you are carb conscious, then get a bag of pork rinds, crush them up, mix them with some spices and use them instead of the stuffing mix.

I give this 5 stars for it's simplicity and because it's good enough to serve company without alot of fuss.  I have been making this for years and everyone loves this dish. I do two things differently. One, is that I layer a slice of deli ham over each chicken breast (don't get it sliced thin!) and put the swiss on top of the ham. Second, I add a tsp. or two of dijion mustard to the cream of chicken soup & milk.  Feel free to remove the foil during the last half of bake time if you want a bit of crunch to your stuffing on top.  Also, if you prefer a less salty dish, use reduced sodium soup.  Delicious!  I have always called my version of this "Dijion Chicken & Ham Bake".  Enjoy! :-)

Really great. Reminded me of thanksgiving. I used a whole box of stuffing which ended up being about 2 1/2 to 3 cups and I added a bit more butter. I suggest *slightly* pushing the stuffing down into the soup mixture rather than mounding it. I did not do this and it was crunchy. It softened up more like stuffing after reheating the next day. Awesome leftovers!

If you are looking for 1970s style comfort food, you've got to try this.  Great recipe.  Very easy. family loved. reminded me of Church potlucks and "Come home when the street lights come on, kids!" dinners from my childhood.

This was very good.  I did as other's mentioned, 1 can mushroom soup and 1 can cream of chicken soup.  Put into crock-pot with chicken on bottom, 3 slices cheese, broccoli florets, last of cheese slices and poured soup/milk mixture over all!  Cooked on low about 4-5 hours, forgot the topping though...  I believe it's the cheese that adds to the saltiness, will make again with less cheese!  Thanks for sharing!

This is a great weeknight dinner.  Based on prior reviews, I substituted 1/4 C white wine and 1/2 C fat free sour cream for the milk.  I cubed the chicken and added frozen broccoli as well as frozen mixed veggeie over the sliced swiss.  I only used 2 large chicken breasts and the amounts of everything else worked.  I can't see how it would be enough for 6 breasts.  I also used cornbread stovetop and sprinkled Montreal chicken seasoning on the chicken before topping it with cheese.  Something tasted a little "off" in some bites; I think it might have been the carrots in the mixed veggies, but I'm not sure.  DH enjoyed it and I'm anxious to see how it heats up tomorrow!  Thanks for the recipe.

Oh, this was really amazing! I was a bit skeptical just reading the directions that it would be really dry, but this dish turned out moist and delicious. I used frozen chicken tenders, and enough sliced swiss to cover them all, then cooked for the amount stated. My son said, "this tastes like chicken cordon bleu". A huge hit at our dinner table! I did add about a tsp of poultry seasoning to the stuffing mix, because even though they say "seasoned" on the package they are so bland that I seriously question that. A do over for sure, THANKS for sharing this "comfort food"! The second time I made this I used a box of stove top brand stuffing mix for chicken and just used the whole deal even though it was a bit more than 2 cups. It still turned out great.

I cooked this in a slow cooker using the same method that gymmom recommended.  I sprayed the inside of the slow cooker with cooking spray and layered the chicken, cheese slices, chicken soup/milk mixture, stuffing, and drizzled melted butter.  I used a little more stuffing to cover the entire top because I really like stuffing.  I cooked it on low for 3.5 hours then turned it to warm for about 30 minutes, and it turned out perfectly.  I love the slow cooker version because the chicken was so moist and easily cut apart with a fork.  Nothing dried out and you do not need to add any extra liquid.  I love how easy and filling this is - very much a comfort food!

I make this often during winter months when I coupon a lot of Stove Top stuffing and I've got to find a way to use it creatively. I used a full cup of milk in with my soup to make more of a "gravy". This is also good with chopped broccoli as a layer, too. If you want to make an all in one casserole, this also works with leftover mashed potatoes as a layer, too. I like to serve this with either steamed brown rice or homemade biscuits to soak up some of the soup-gravy.

Holy macaroni was this good!  My husband practically licked the plate!  I skipped the wine and used chicken broth instead.  I loved the crunch of the stuffing mix on top!

I have been making this recipe for years.  The only difference is I make the stuffing per directions on the box, and then spread over the top of the soup mixture.  Also, I don't thin out the soup with anything - use it straight out of the can, and also put a thin layer of soup under the chicken.   I will definitely try some of these tips next time - the wine added in sounds fabulous!

I love this one and have made it for years.  My original recipe calls for wine, but I don't usually have that so I have substituted with milk, apple juice, and apple pulp from our juicer.  Once I did not have any of those but had a jar of baby food - pear and apple.  It was awesome!

Ok, so I've used this recipe for years.  I've always added white wine though instead of milk and I don't use nearly that much butter on top at the end.  Use the low fat cream of chix soup mix and Pepperidge Farm Herbed bread crumbs on top and you don't really need the butter at all.  It makes the dish lower in fat and much more flavorful.

I have made this several times. I always put extra swiss cheese on the chicken. I find that the flavor of just a few slices get lost in all the flavors of the soups and the stuffing. I never add any salt as there is enough in the soup and the stuffing. I used black cracked pepper.  I've used breasts as well as tenders. It's quick and easy and very very good!!

This was so easy and had great flavor!  I made a few changes based on others suggestions: cut the breasts into bite size pieces, seasoned the chicken with garlic powder, black pepper and dried parsley, and (because I didn't have any cream of chicken) used cream of celery soup.  My slightly picky 7 year old raved and my more picky 4 year old choked down a few bites as well.  Success!  Will definitely make again.

This tasted pretty good, but the sauce was a little runny.  Compared to recipes where the chicken is in pieces, it was also more difficult to eat.

Very very good, although my mom makes one with cooper cheese and homemade breadcrumbs that I feel is a little better.  The changes I made were that I pre-cooked the chicken a little so it didn't take as long in the oven.  I seasoned it with pepper, garlic powder and onion powder.  I also cut it into one inch cubes.  I used 98% fat free cream of chicken soup, a 6 oz box of stove top stuffing for chicken and shredded  swiss cheese.  I didn't think it was salty at all.  I definitely recommend the reduced fat/reduced sodium soup.  My husband really liked it, too.  I will be making this again.  It is quick and easy!

This dish was SO yummy!  The only thing I did to change it was that I only used 3 chicken breasts, instead of 6 since I wasn't sure if we'd like it.  I used the exact same amount of all the other ingredients, and it turned out wonderfully.  In fact, I will continue making it this way because of all the extra sauce it made, which tasted amazing when served over rice.  I also added some frozen broccoli, and in the last few minutes it was baking, I sprinkled shredded parmesan on top, and finished baking it uncovered.  I will definitely make this again and again, and might even have some for breakfast this morning! :)

Yummy! I sprayed the crockpot with Pam, added frozen chicken, topped with Swiss, then soup mixture, stuffing and last poured the butter on top. Cooked low for 7 hours. Added a frozen bag of broccoli during the last hour. Thanks for sharing!

I have been making a variation of this for years.  I use white wine instead of milk, add fresh mushrooms on top of chicken before layering cheese, soup mix and stuffing.  Also, use frozen spinach or french style green beans as the first layer.  Increase baking time accordingly.

I have been making this recipe for awhile-handed down from a friend. It is easy and delicious! You can add any steamed veggie to it too. Just add it next to the chicken before adding the soup.I haven't met anyone who doesn't like this recipe. I have had it requested and you will too!

This is so easy and tasty too! I layered everything in the crock pot with frozen green beans on the bottom and set on low for about 4 hours. Worked great! Next time I might try cornbread dressing just to see if it's better.

Excellent! So simple yet so tasty. A modified version of old Southern Smothered Chicken. I made ours in the crock pot and we loved it.

Instead of milk, I use white wine! (Making it infinitely better !) I've made it with moscato (because I had it on hand the first time I made it..and I wanted to drink it) and it didn't make it taste sweet at all. You could use a dry white wine as well, whatever your preference. Whisk it with the cream of mushroom soup and pour over the chicken breasts. I also use Pepperidge Farm herb stuffing mix, it has a great flavor. Cover the chicken with it, drizzle with butter and bake. It is so simple but soooo good! This is a go-to recipe for me.

Very good way to use up my leftovers. I doubled everything, making 2 casseroles, one w/ shredded turkey & mozzarella, the other w/ cubed ham & swiss. I did use fresh stove-top  stuffing from the box, although I think the leftover stuffing would have worked fine. I mixed both the cream of chicken & cream of mushroom soups, used evaporated milk,& poured over top of it all to keep stuffing moist. Also added canned corn & peas. Put one in the freezer uncooked for a quick dinner!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  However I would recommend that you follow the recipe and only use one can of cream of chicken soup.  Two cans made it "too soupy" to quote my husband.  The chicken was very moist and tender.  My five year old who has a chicken graveyard in his stomach kept saying yum yum while eating his.  The only down fall of this recipe for my family is that my husband really doesn't care for boxed stuffing so I probably won’t make it again.  But if you love boxed stuffing like my cousin in law who made her own at Thanksgiving because she doesn't like homemade then go for it, you won’t be disappointed.

I've been making this dish for awhile because it is simple and quick. But it's always tasted bland to me. I've tried different ways to season the chicken and  FINALLY found a great seasoning mix on this site that made a HUGE difference! ("Chicken Seasoning" by Patrick) I also sprinkled some bacon bits on top of the Swiss cheese before pouring the soup mixture. And I sprinkled 2 tablespoons of melted butter over the top of the stuffing before popping it into the oven. Now this dish is a real winner and I'd give it 5 stars with the new seasoning mix! We usually have this dish with a green vegetable, like broccoli. I'm taking leftovers today for lunch! :-)

I eat a reduced carb diet so I made this without stuffing and butter and it is still delicious. I followed some of the others and made with white wine and frozen broccoli. I made it a second time with frozen corn and it was just as good. Even the pickiest eaters love this and it is sure to become a family favourite. Yummy!

Actually I've made this many times and the stuffing on top always came out hard, so, I've found the best way to make it is to cook the stuffing before hand than add it on top the last 5 minutes, works out best for me, other than that, its a great recipe...

This was very good, I added a little garlic powder and cracked pepper to up the flavor a little, and I was very glad that i did. Good base casserole recipe, and i will try it with different spices next time. Thanks for sharing!

What a great recipe!  Simple to make.  I followed the suggestions of others and used white wine instead of milk and prepared the stuffing instead of putting in on dry.  Served with green beans sauted with bacon and onions.

I have been making this recipe for a long time- it is one of my family's favorites! The only change that was included in my original recipe is that I use white wine instead of milk- it adds a really nice flavor! I also skip the butter on the stuffing and it comes out fine. This dish is amazing!!!

I have been making a variation on this recipe for 20 years but my recipe calls for mixing the soup with 1/4 cup of white wine or beer.  Everything else is the same except I have always had mine in the over for 1 hour.

I saw this recipe in an eating for pregnancy cookbook. The only difference was the recipe in the book didn't call for butter to be drizzled on top. This dish is quite tasty. I halve then pound the chicken breast until they are about 1/2 an inch thick and I usually cover the dish for part of the baking time.

This is a GREAT recipe and I will be using this one again!! I threw this all together real quick before I took my daughter to soccer.  It was done by the time we got home.  EXCELLENT!! I used chicken tender pieces so they would cook quicker and easier.  Seasoned them with garlic powder and some Dash.  Then put provolone cheese on top. Spread soup/milk mixture over top.  Threw on frozen broccoli and then stove top.  Cooked covered (foil) for the first 30 min.  Then took off foil and let cook the rest. I pour some chicken stock over stuffing during the last few minutes.  EVERYONE chowed down and LOVED this recipe!!! Easy and delicious!! A+++ I will be making this again!!!

This was a very easy recipe with tasty results...the only things I did differently was 1) season the chicken with pepper, onion powder, seasoned salt and garlic salt before adding the cheese slices; 2) I had a feeling the stuffing would dry out on top of the soup mix while baking so used 1 1/2 cans of cream of chicken soup (doubling the milk), mixed in the stuffing mix and poured the whole thing over the chicken before drizzling the melted butter. My husband and I really liked this and the leftovers are yummy too. Thanks so much for sharing this!

I made a couple of changes per other's suggestions and our own preferences. There are four of us so I used three large breasts and cut them up into cubes. Then I added some frozen broccoli florets (maybe 1.5 cups worth) and some lean deli ham that I shredded on top of the chicken. I was using a 9 x 13 glass dish and ended up using at least 6 slices of swiss - enough to cover all the chicken/ham/broccoli mixture. I used wine rather than milk with the soup and the only stuffing I had was cornbread flavored. We cooked it at 425 degrees for about 35 minutes and it turned out wonderful. Everyone went back for seconds and there are no leftovers. Definitely a quick, easy and flavorful meal!

This is definitely in our rotation. It is so quick and very good. I cut the recipe in half and only cook 3 chicken breasts for my husband and I. For a change, I think I am going to try adding a layer of ham over the cheese for a "cordon bleu" twist.

This was so easy, and so good! I used store brand 98% fat free cream of chicken, and Stove Top Savory Herb stuffing. I didn't even bother to measure, and it turned out great. Thanks for the recipe.

I like this recipe but use Marsala instead of the milk and tried to spice it up by using a combination of Swiss and pepperjack cheese.  I have made it with various stuffing mixes but my favorite was a Southwestern one by Pepperidge Farm that I no longer can find locally since I moved.  More recently I used Chicken flavored stuffing.  I have made it with Cream of Mushroom, Cream of Chicken, and the Cream of Chicken and Herb.  I usually add a can of mushrooms to the soup to add additional texture.

little salty for my taste.  I did add extra swiss cheese to the top (low sodium alpine lace) and cooked it slow so the chicken would start to fall apart.  family loved it

I followed the advice of previous reviewers and used white wine instead of milk to mix with the soup.  I also added a bag of frozen broccoli florets around the chicken breasts before pouring the soup over, and I removed the foil during the last 10 minutes or so of cooking time so that the stuffing would brown.  My husband said that the only thing he didn't like about it was the BIG chicken breasts, would rather have pieces, so next time I think I will cut up the chicken and make it more like a true casserole.  The only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is that I wasn't just blown away, but it was a very tasty weeknight meal served with a salad and some hot rolls.

This was really tasty but took much longer to cook.  This could have been the size of the chicken breasts but at the 50 minutes suggested the chicken was raw.  Had to cook another 30 minutes.  Otherwise, this is one I will definitely make again!  Very easy to make and delicious to eat!

I love this easy chicken recipe. I've made it 2 times, both times I added broccoli and I think it makes the dish. Next time I'll add peas. Also, I cut the chicken into chunks and liked it that way better. Easy and yummy.

I did this recipe exactly as stated and it came out really dry and crispy. It had no moisture in it whatsoever and it was a total fail. I didn't read the reviews for alterations cause I didn't have the time but next time I will. This one was a miss.

This was pretty good.  It seemed a little salty in spots, I'm not sure if it was the cheese or the butter or the stuffing or what.  Overall I really liked it.  I added frozen broccoli all around the chicken before adding the stuffing on top and it turned out great.  Thanks!

it was so easy, but just okay tasting. i used stovetop stuffing, and it was way too salty. i used white wine instead of milk. i liked the flavoring, could use even more wine. it could have used broccoli to balance the salt. i would probably prefer to just bake the chicken with swiss cheese and then have stuffing on the side.

We are getting ready to have our second child so I've been looking for recipes to either freeze or have easy ingredients on hand.  This is a definite keeper! My picky husband described it as "Delicious!" and I can very easily send him to the store to get ingredients without worrying that he won't be able to find them. Before adding the soup I sprinkled the chicken with garlic salt, onion powder, and black pepper. 
(Note: after cooking completely, I did spoon the hot soup/cheese mixture over the stuffing and re-covered it with foil for a few mintues to soften it. Otherwise it would have been unpleasantly crunchy/chewy.)

Super easy, & very quick to throw together.  I used shredded swiss, but felt I couldn't really taste the swiss cheese at all.

Very good!  My husband is picky and even he loved it.  I followed every instruction except I had a feeling it would be too runny if I added the milk so I left that out and it was good.  For larger breast pieces you may need to put an extra half slice of swiss.

Creamy, nice meal for a cold day. Easy to make. Next time though I think I will add some more spices for a little more flavor and pound the chicken.

SOOO easy & my family LOVED it!!!  i used 4 large chicken breasts instead of 6, american cheese slices instead of swiss, 1/4 cup white cooking wine instead of milk & 1 6 ounce box of stovetop stuffing instead of 2 cups herb-seasoned stuffing - BUT im sure it would have been just as excellent exactly as written!

I have made this recipe many times but with a few variations. I poach and chop the chicken before hand, then mix it with the soup, milk, a can of green beans, and some sauteed onions and celery. I also mix in shredded swiss cheese, because we like the cheese to be evenly distributed, and this way the cheese flavor doesn't take over. I then prepare a box of chicken stove top stuffing mix according to the box. I put the chicken/soup mixture in the bottom of a baking dish, top with the stuffing mix, and bake. This is such a great casserole on a cold day. Thanks for a wonderful recipe that my family has adapted to suit our tastes.

This was pretty good. I thought I had all of the ingredients, but didn't, but still wanted to try it. I had chicken tenderloin instead of 6 chicken breasts and a shredded cheddar blend instead of swiss. I used seasoned cornbread crumbs for the topping, because it wasn't specific. It gave it a somewhat stuffing taste, but not sure if that was correct. It was quick to put together, filling, and I ate it with a side of green beans. Though, it didn't reheat that well the next day, as the coating was kind of hard and dry, but the meat was still pretty much tender. I may make again but half the recipe for just that evening when I am looking for something quick and easy.

This was good but I did add some things to it..I used chicken stock in place of milk and also when I placed the chicken in the pan I put a slice of hiney ham and then swiss cheese so it was kinda like deconstructed chicken cordon bleu.

I made this recipe tonight but with a twist: I used boneless pork loin chops, pork Stove Top stuffing mix, cream of mushroom soup, and the Swiss cheese. This is what I had on hand....and it turned out delicious! I put some milk and some white wine in with the soup; served the casserole with honey-ginger glazed carrots and homemade chunky applesauce. I love this kind of casserole. OK....I love stuffing any way I can get it!

This was excellent!  I did add a thin layer of ham on each piece of chicken under the swiss.  Next time, I will use low sodium cream of chicken...a tidge too salty.  Also used wine as the other reviewers recommended.  Will definitley make again.

This recipe is great! I was searching allrecipes one day for something new to make.. I wanted something cheesy and only had swiss so I typed it in and found this. Super fast and easy to make and absolutely delicious! The chicken and the stuffing are so moist.. just make a quick vegetable and you've got a great meal!

I tried this recipe last nite and ...IT WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING...I had been hearing about using "Cream of [...}" soups in different recipes and initally came here to look for those types and this one was soo good.  I just couldn't believe how moist the chicken was.  I only added one ingrediant, after basting the pan with margarine, I placed the unseasoned chicken in pan and put a slice of canadian maple ham on top of the chicken, then the cheeese, the the cream of chicken/milk mixture, then the stuffing mix and then  the butter....WOW...just WOW!!!!!

WOW this is good! I've added it to my favorites file with a few revisions. I took the advice of a few other reviewers and added another can of soup. I've made this recipe several times and have mix up the varieties of soup used, and they've all been great. I also slathered on extra cheese because, I believe, the more the better! I also added a bit more milk because I wanted the sauce a little more "saucy" and a little less "casserole" (to pour over the noodles I served it with). I was amazed that the stuffing mix and the soup added enough flavor because I didnt add an extra seasoning ingredient and it was wonderful!!

This was very good. I cut the chicken up, hoping that it would only take 30min. to cook, but it still needed an extra 15min. The only other change was adding some mont.jack cheese (shredded)along with the swiss (also shredded). The cheese gave it a great flavor. Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent and easy.  I always change a bit because I can't help myself.  I used Campbell's Healthy Request cream of chicken soup to which I added pepper and poultry seasoning.  I also sprinkled the chicken with salt, pepper and garlic powder.  In an effort to lower fat and calories, I ommited the butter and just mixed 3\4 cup hot water with the stuffing mix before adding it to the dish.  Even my family who doesn't want to watch fat and calories loved it!

I followed this recipe to the letter except for 2 things. First, I used boneless, skinless thighs; second, because I didn't have the stuffing mix on hand, I used some herb-seasoned  croutons!  Every bit as good as the stuffing mix, I would imagine.  I chose to use them whole which made the topping bulkier, but maybe next time I will crush them up a bit.  This is a rich dish and is fabulous over plain white rice.  I will make again.  Thanks for sharing!

We liked this!  I used Stove Top & added chicken broth to it, put it on top & baked.  Everything was moist & delicious.

this was an excellent recipe, followed as is.  i did use a variation though that was also just as fantastic.... i had some cooked chicken that i cubed and quickly pan seared to give some color, then used a small individual oven safe casserole dish and layed the chicken in the soup , topped with the cheese and stuffing then broiled in the oven for about 5 min.  so much faster, and just as easy.  do this method if you are in a hurry and don't want to wait!!  just perfect.

The saltiness: holey moley!  I even used plain stuffing mix sprinkled with herbs and no salt, and yet this dish came out insanely salty.  Not sure where the overwhelming saltiness is coming from.  Perhaps it's the combination of cream soup (used Campbell's mushroom) and the Swiss cheese?  I think I would leave out the cheese next time, since I can't really taste it anyway.  I served it with very plain mashed potatoes to temper the salt.  I think this recipe would be really great if the salt were toned down.

Wow!  What a weird recipe & SO TASTY!  My husband and I both thought this sounded crazy with swiss cheese and stuffing?  The mixture is wonderful.  My two children (ages 4 and 3) LOVE it.  I have been making this once a week for the past 2 months and the whole family goes nuts for it every time.  Best part is that it's insanely easy.  I only made a couple of changes.  I wrap the chicken breasts in swiss cheese, and I use 2 full cans of cream of chicken and 2 full bags of chicken stuffing (with butter added before I put it on top.)  Takes a little longer to bake, but it only takes 5 minutes to put together.  This will be my staple chicken recipe for a long time.

This is a family pleaser! We are a family of 5 - After reading the various reviews - I seasoned the chicken breast with poultry seasoning and black pepper and garlic powder - then I too added an extra can of soup and about 3 tbs more of milk and a half cup more stuffing mix-then I used 5 tbs butter to topping instead of 4- it turned out great!  Thanks for the tips on the various ways of making this-  I cooked mine a full 60 minutes as my chicken breasts were fairly thick and it turned out perfectly moist and tender!  I made a side of buttered peas and carrots & had a pineapple ring over cottage cheese salad-
it looked so pretty on the plate!

I had this last week and my kids devoured it.  I'm back this week to make it again... cooked in slow cooker and just left it alone for 3-4 hours, it was the easiest thing, and smelled wonderful.  All I had to do was make a veggie... greenbeans last week, this week broccoli.  Only thing I think I'll do different is add an extra can of cream of chicken to make more sauce, and maybe some extra stuffing... my family is pretty saucey, and they were fighting over the last of the sauce/stuffing mixture.  Other than exta sauce, I wouldn't change a thing.  Put in slow cooker for an easy fix and forget main, which only cooks for 3-4 hours, so you can plan dinner at lunch with enough time for it to be done that evening.

I LOVE this recipe!

This was easy, tasty, and a bit hit.  Next time I think I would use chicken tenders, and cook it for less time.  Good recipe for working families.

Very good.  I used white wine instead of milk.  Only gave 4 stars because the stuffing was dry.

This is my picky husband's new favorite casserole. He doesn't like stuffing and he liked this. The second time we made it we doubled the Swiss cheese and cubed the chicken. It was wonderful!

I thought recipe was good. The flavor of the cheese was a little much, so I'm going to use much less next time. I also cut the chicken into 1 inch cubes and added some steamed broccoli on top of the cheese.

This was good, but I would like to lighten it up a bit...I'll definitely make it again, but next time, I'll use 1) "lite" cream of chicken soup, 2) 1/2 c low-fat milk, 3) low-fat Swiss cheese.  I also think it would be better with an extra 1/2 cup of stuffing, as the 2 cups kinda disappeared--absorbed into the other ingredients.  Extra stuffing would give a little bit of a crunchy crust.

I made this exactly as written exept I put thinly cliced ham on my chicken breasts.  It was wonderful.  Much like a cordon bleu but much less hassle.  My boyfriend isn't a huge chicken eater and he devoured it.  Thanks!

This was awesome!  I used 3 chicken breasts and 2 cans of soup.  With a few minutes left of cooking stir the stuffing mix a bit so that it all gets soaked in the soup mixture. We normally don't eat leftovers, but this was gone the next day.

I don't know why other reviewers said this was bland or blah.  We thought it was simply delicious!  The only thing I did differently was topping the chicken with two slices of swiss cheese per breast instead of one slice.  It can never be TOO cheesy!

Easy and tastey, very simple.  I used the wine instead of the milk and cut the chicken into chunks.  I used the stovetop low sodium chicken stuffing and DH loved it, will make again soon.

I have a recipe that I use that's pretty close to this and it's fantastic.  Instead of 1/4 cup of milk-- add 1/4 cup white wine and 1/2 cup sour cream.  Its wonderful.

This is a recipe my family grew up with but I'd forgotten about. I made it a few times and loved it...but thought something was missing.  My sister reminded me that we mixed the soup with WINE instead of milk.  The reviewers who thought it was a little bland might find that that's just the "bite" it needs!

50 minutes on 350 degrees is not correct. Second time this has happened, this time I used thinner chicken and still had the same result.

I love this! However, I find it crisps up better on top if you mix the butter and stuffing mix in a bowl and then put it on top! Cheap, quick, and easy.

Instead of milk we use 1/4 cup vermouth.   This is an old recipe I have had since the local library put together a cookbook in the 80's.  Easy and always a favorite.

Recipe is an easy, good hot lunch. I used precooked, pre-shredded chicken and it was super easy.  Tastes too salty for me, however.  Probably the combo of cream chicken soup and stuffing.  I will use 1/2 can soup next time and add a little sour cream.  I added cooking sherry and liked the taste. May add Chardonnay next time.  I will double the amount of chicken, too.  Great recipe to "tweak" according to what you have in your pantry.  Green beans, onions, celery, etc.  Easy  left overs for late night snack,too.

We loved this recipe Carolyn! Took the advice from others and used much more soup than stated; four breasts and a family sized can of soup. I also seasoned and browned the chicken and then deglazed the plan with white wine and added it to the soup.Instead of mixing the stuffing crumbs with butter, I used evoo and added in some parm cheese. This is true comfort food that soothes the soul anytime of year. Thank you!

3 suggestions:  
(1)  I use chicken tenders - thinner, more tender - unnecessary to precook OR split chicken breasts OR  put breasts in plastic bag and pound them flatter.
(2) I add a layer of stuffing mix in the bottom
(3) I use enough stuffing mix to cover entire top of casserole.

I prepare the stove top chicken or turkey flavor stuffing as directed on the box, then put the chicken in the 9x13 baking pan, top with swiss cheese, mix the cream of chicken soup with 1/4 c of milk, and put the prepared topping mix over all evenly, then drizzle with butter, cover with foil and bake and remove the foil during the last 5 or 10 min. to crisp it up a little. We love it as written except I prepare the stuffing mix before i put it on the top.

I've made this several times and it's always a hit. I increase the soup to 2 cans and milk to 1/2 cup - I'e never had a problem with it being soupy as others describe.  I also use an entire cylinder of Stove Top prepared per instructions but omit the butter. My family thinks I could increase the amount of stuffing even more. Next time I make it I plan to add broccoli or mixed frozen veg as other suggest.  Love it!

This is the best recipe I've ever made from this site.  I seasoned the chicken with poultry seasoning, black pepper, Lowry's seasoned salt, and garlic powder, added a handful of brocolli, cut the milk, and replaced it with wine (Woodbridge Chardonnay).  Added more wine on top of the stuffing halfway through (used Stove Top Chicken, or whatever flavor I have on hand), and tadaaaa, my new favorite dish.

I'm really disappointed. I made this recipe exactly as written and that's how I'm reviewing it. The stuffing mix on top was cooked unevenly - some parts were soggy and nearly disintegrated while others were crunchy. The soup/milk mix made everything really soupy and despite the immense amount of salt in both the soup and the stuffing mix, the chicken was very lacking in flavor. I will definitely not make this again.

It was good- no cordon bleu but good- My husband really liked it though he says.. he loves stuffing. next time (and I will make again) I'll try with white wine and try to evenly coat the stuffing since some of it was hard when done

I think this recipe is good, and it's very simple.  The only caution that I heed is that 6 b/s chicken breasts is way too many.  I used 4, and I think next time I would just use 3, but it depends how much of the stuffing you want. (Assuming the author is calling one breast one of the HALVES out of the commonly sold 3 pack of halved breasts, which is what I used).

This is a great dish for entertaining. We had a casual dinner party consisting of 3 families,and this was a very easy meal to pull together. I prepared 3 baking dishes, leaving me some leftovers which I know we will enjoy.
I used cream of mushroom instead of the cream of chicken and white wine instead of the milk. Because we live at altitude and I had three baking dishes in the oven at the same time, I had the oven at 415 for 50 minutes.

This is a great basic recipe!  I have made it a few times and tweaked it a little bit:  I brown the chicken first to add flavor, and add a few carmelized onion slices and top everything off with a little Rosemary before popping in the over.  Tonight I have a few leftover baby Bella mushrooms I'm going to slice up and saute to add to the mix.  Note:  if you're browning the chicken first, you might want to cut back on the total cooking time.

The only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is because of how salty the dish was.  It was so easy and very flavorful and I will definitely make it again if I can figure out a way to cut down on the salt (subbing the soup for something else or making croutons instead of using the stuffing mix) The only modifications I made was adding roasted eggplant to add a veg and using fat free half and half instead of the milk.

Wish I had had this recipe years ago!  A great meal for family, but one that would also be very well received by guests.  I only had four chicken breasts to use, so I cut down the stuffing to one cup and the butter to 2 Tbsp.  After melting the butter, I just stirred it into the stuffing for more thorough coverage before sprinkling over the chicken.  This recipe was absolutely delicious served over rice.  My husband of 27 years is slow to try new things, but he raved about this.  Glad I found something new he really likes!

This was much tastier than the sum of its parts. I didn't do anything special to it (besides shredding my Swiss because it was in a brick and slicing it was more effort than shredding it), though in the future I might cut the chicken into chunks and maybe season it with black pepper a little, as I missed that flavor (and just shaking it on top is not the same). I served this over brown rice with garden salads and broccoli on the side. Thanks for sharing, this was easy and satisfying - I think the Swiss cheese might have something to do with the extra boost of flavor.

Everyone liked this. I mixed rice in with the soup and milk. If I add rice again next time, I will use another can of soup, as it was not quite as moist I would have liked.

It's important to note that "6 skinless, boneless chicken breasts" means "6 HALF skinless, boneless chicken breasts." If you use full sized breasts, you will have WAY more than six servings and the result is dry. If you use breasts that are halved (which is how they are commonly sold), this recipe is the BOMB! So very good - and amazingly quick and easy.

A nice, quick weeknight meal that takes about 5 minutes to put together.  I subbed sherry for the milk and added a jar of sliced mushrooms.  Served over rice with peas and carrots.  Very tasty and versitile.  Thanks for sharing, Carolyn.

Had friends over for dinner and wanted something that sounded easy and everyone would like.  I seasoned my chicken with salt, peper, and garlic powder.  I also threw in some mushrooms and used the herb stuffing mix.  Had to bake a little longer than stated, but it was pretty good! A little on the salty side, but when paired with plain brown rice it wasn't so bad.  Will make again, I'm sure!

Sometimes I'll switch it up and use cream of mushroom soup for a different flavor. I usually mix half of the stuffing in with the soup mixture and then sprinkle the remaining stuffing on top. I think it helps keep the sauce from running and the stuffing from becoming to hard.

Very good and easy.  Even my picky 11 and 9 year olds liked it.  :)  The only thing I did in varying the recipe was to season the chicken breast with salt, white ground pepper, and a little garlic powder....

EASY and delicious.  This will be a keeper.  I used about 1/2 cup of dry white wine instead of milk and about 1/4 of sr. cream.  I also added a bit of gouda because I had it on hand.  Even the 'chicken again?' hubby loved it.  Thanks.

This was a pretty tasty recipe, I just found it a little too salty for my liking. It may have been the type of suffing mix and soup that I used. I tend to not use a lot of pre-packaged foods when I cook, so I can really taste all the salt! Next time I will try using reduced sodium ingredients!

Very quick and easy to make, but tastes just like every other chicken and "cream of" soup - it is ok in a pinch, but nothing fantastic.  I love stuffing, so that made it better and provided some crispness. I would definitely recommend taking the cover off at some point to crisp up the stuffing a bit.

This recipe was delicious, my husband couldn't stop talking about it. However, I did make a small change. Because I didn't have the stuffing mix on hand, I substituted french fried onions. Next time I make it I will have to try it with the stuffing mix, and there definitely will be a next time.

I made this for supper today and we thought it was excellent! The only variation I did was used Stove Top Chicken Stuffing (1 whole box) instead of the Herb Stuffing and as I said it came out fantastic> I will make this again!!!

Very good.  Made this today for family.  I used chicken thighs & legs.  Cooked a little longer (15 mins.) because of the bone in the meat.  Also used a little more melted butter (about 2 tbs.) and removed the foil for about 10 minutes in the middle of baking.  Overall, very good and no leftovers!

This recipe is AWESOME and so easy!  I embellished a little by adding an extra can of Cream of Chicken soup and a little extra swiss cheese.  My family loves it served with white rice and steamed broccoli.  It has become one of our favorites and there are never any leftovers!!

Holy cow this is amazing!  I figured I would like it, but my husband and I LOVED it!  Made it as is, no changes.  I use Publix frozen chicken breasts and I don't even thaw them out, I just put them in there frozen and it still comes out wonderfully.  It's even great reheated!!!  Thanks for a superb recipe!  It's going on my regular rotation.

I love this recipe! It's like a mini Thanksgiving dinner in casserole form. If it seems too salty, cut back on the soup a bit, and add a little milk to the mixture. Grand

Delicious!  Double the cheese and butterfly the chicken breast, stuff a piece of cheese inside the and then refold. Wonderful with fresh green beans on the side.

So excellent! Changes I made were:  I sprinkled garlic powder, onion powder, and pepper on both sides of chicken before covering with cheese. I melted a 1/2 - 3/4 stick of butter and drizzled over the stuffing mix (used chunky kind of stuffing mix, not crumbs). I only loosely covered with foil while baking, then cooked under the broiler for about 2-3 min at the end.  Remove from oven and let sit 10 min to thicken.  Next time I will use the low sodium (not low fat) soup.  Chicken was very, very moist and tender. Great hit with my 30 yr old son and 8 yr old granddaughter!

We really like this dish. I did use 2 cans of souo and a bag of frozen broccoli spears plus some sauted onions. I mixed the package of dressing mix with water and butter as per the instructions on the box. Next time i will use double the dressing and still follow the box instructions. Comfort food at its best!!!

Served this at our quilt circle luncheon yesterday and not a bite was left over!  I used chicken tenders (some cut in half), seasoned the chicken with Lowry's All Season salt, garlic garni and some pepper; layered with some fresh broccoli, and topped with thin slices of swiss cheese from our local deli.  Sprinkled Stove Top Chicken stuffing mix on the top. The butter is definately a good idea.  This is a keeper!

I made this recepie last night.  It turned out great.  I used a 12" covered chicken for my pan.  I sprinkled "Mrs Dash" on both sides of the chicken, added the swiss cheese and the soup and milk mixture.  I then added a complete box of StoveTop "Savory Herb" dresing mix.  I then added 1/2 stick of melted butter over the dressing mixture.  I cooked it in the oven for 30 minutes, removed from oven, added a complete bag of frozen broccoli, then returned to oven for 30 more minutes.  It was very, very good.  Peter in Tampa

This was quick and tasty, despite the prep time stated: I cut 4 small raw chicken breasts into cubes and seared in a pan. I had accidentally dropped the cubes into the soup mixture (before reading reviews!) so I fished them out and seared in a little olive oil, and the bit of soup on them made a nice coating. Then I added 1/2 tsp curry powder and 1 tsp minced garlic, per other comments about the dish tasting "bland." Sprayed pyrex dish with Pam, added curried chicken, swiss cheese slices, then stuffing mix already mixed with soup, added extra milk to coat all the stuffing, and put layer of stuffing over cheese and chicken. Drizzled 1/4c melted real butter on top and baked for 35 mins. Everyone in the family, except the texture-challenged son, went back for seconds! (not normal!) Will put this in my huge "keeper" file; thanks for the post!

Excellent recipie   I cooked it in a crock pot for 3-4 hrs on Hi.  I seasoned the chicken with Lemon Pepper as did some other reviewers.  I used Thighs skin on, bone in. After I seasoned the chicken I layed them down in the crock pot skin down. I used shredded montery jack and American cheese..I did not have any swiss. I then put in 1 bag of frozen mixed vegetables w/ brocolli. I used 1 can of cream of chicken soup & 1 can of cream of mushroom soup mixed with the milk.  I microwaved the butter and added it to the Cornbread dressing and topped the veg/chicken/cheese with this. I topped this mixture after cooking over wide egg noodles.  It came out great!  My wife loved it!  She loves it when I cook.  I will make this for our kids the next time we are togther.

Wow! - combine two things I love - chicken & stuffing and this gets the magic 5*. Followed the recipe exactly and the flavour was wild. The only thing I'd wish to improve is to somehow get the sauce into the chicken breast, (partially slice/score the breasts prior to putting in oven & then pour sauce over??) Will try this next time. The next time - I used someone else's idea in cutting the chicken into cubes. Ended up better than first time - more flavor in the chicken.

This was a good recipe that my family enjoyed.  The only thing that I did different was to use 1 cup of fat-free chicken broth in place of the butter to knock off some of the fat grams.  I will definitely make this again when I need something quick for dinner.

I made this using a rotisserie chicken from costco to save time. I was greatly disappointed. I always read the reviews from others who have made the recipe and I thought it sounded like a winner.   I will not make this again.

Too salty as written. Make your own cream sauce sans salt, make your own stuffing mix without added salt, and use unsalted butter for a healthier version of this.

This was a hit with all my family. The only thing I changed was I cut the large chicken breasts in half and used only 3. Then I used Italian bread crumbs instead of stuffing mix. I liberally sprinkled them over the top of the chicken etc. and baked. I have served it with rice and with baked potatoes and tonight will do mashed potatoes. Excellent recipe.

This is very tasty and very easy to make.  I couldn't fit 6 chicken breasts in my 9 x 13-inch casserole so I only used 4; since I was only cooking for my husband and me it was just enough.  I did add a teaspoon of tarragon, a dash of pepper, and a dash of onion powder to the soup/milk mixture for a little extra flavor.  I also had thinner chicken breasts so it didn't take as long to cook.  This is a recipe that will be used again and again.

I really wanted to like this recipe.  I love chicken, swiss cheese and all of the other ingredients, however, I found this recipe to be too salty.  The flavor was very harsh and I couldn't get past the saltiness.  Sorry.

This gets 5 stars!  It was just the thing to prepare on a busy day.  I loved not having to precook the chicken, and the fact that there weren't a ton of ingredients to assemble.  I used shredded Swiss cheese instead of the slices and cut it back to about 4 oz.  Yummy!

I made this last night for my fiancee and I.  It was extremely easy to make and we had most of the ingredients at the house.  The only thing I would change maybe to add a bit more milk or soup... it seemed a bit dry.  The herb flavored stuffing was perfect.  You didn't need to add any other seasonings.  I also cut the chicken up into bit sized pieces.  It seemed like it would be more like a casserole that way.  Great recipe!  Thanks for the post!

I made this last night for my family.  Everyone loved it.  I did use white wine instead of milk this time.  My fiance said it gave it more of an "upperclass taste". When I made it with milk it was a "comfort food" taste. Both ways are good!

This was a big hit with everyone, even my son who claims to hate all casseroles!  I just used two really large chicken breasts and cut into big cubes. I added 1 large floret of broccoli, but into small pieces and used the whole pkg of dry stuffing. We'll definitely have this one again, Thanks!

This was okay-the boxed stuffing taste overpowered the dish in my opinion.  I guess I'm just not a fan of suffing mix.

I made this last night and it was great. I did use some of the modifications: add 1/2 cup white whine to milk and soup. Next time, I would add a whole cup as the stuffing thickened the sauce. If you use Stove Top stuffing, it can be quite salty, so use reduced sodium soup...  REALLY GREAT recipe. If you were intrigued enough to be reading the reviews, make this! You'll love it!

This was so easy to make its almost unbelieveable that it tasted so good. I think next time though, I will omitt the melted butter, too much fat.

Made this twice – loved it both times, but 1st time was the best.   Seems like the use of the stuffing mix is the crux – the more you use the more it tastes like stuffing.   I bought a herb & spice mix of parsley, sage, rosemary, thyme & marjoram.

1st was according to other hints, raw broccoli on base, chicken cut into squares (I actually sprinkled it with Nostimini – a herb flavouring  mix – but I am not sure its necessary), grated matured cheese, soup mixed with water, then only about ½ cup stuffing mix, sprinkled on like breadcrumbs.   In cooking the stuffing sort of sank into the soup leaving a more subtle flavour.   A 5 star turn.

The 2nd time it was the same but I used the two cups of stuffing mix.   It created a definite topping.   The casserole then tasted predominantly of stuffing and was drier.   I think the stuffing absorbed some of the liquid.   Possibly only 4 stars.

Thank you for this recipe, it is relatively simple, but it was missing something.  When I make it again I will pound the chicken breasts so that they are thinner (A couple of chicken pieces weren't cooked thoroughly) and play around with the recipe to find what is missing.

So great! I made this with 3 chicken breasts instead of the 6, and it was perfect. It came out "cleanly" for my pickiest of eaters (won't eat sauce or seasoning flecks!!) but had lots of extra sauce & stuffing for my great eater. I will definitely be making this weekly, since it had practically no prep time. yay!

This was really good!  I made a few changes.  Instead of slices of cheese I used a little over a cup of shredded swiss.  I also only used 2 chicken breasts, cut down into thin slices. The smaller amount of chicken was perfect.  If you make this with 6 breasts, double the rest of the ingredients or you won't have enough.  I also added about 1/8 cup chardonnay to the soup and milk.  I also recommend adding cauliflower, which is the perfect veggie with swiss cheese.  My husband couldn't get enough and even my super picky kids ate some of it!

I just made this recipe tonight for the family and everyone loved it. I cubed & seasoned the chicken with a little seasoning salt, pepper and garlic before throwing on the swiss cheese & chicken cream soup.I used Cambell's Chicken Cream Soup. I have used some generics in the past and they were horrible so I think that makes a huge difference for taste (especially this recipe). In closing, great, great recipe and very easy! I served it with steamed artichokes and steamed white rice.

I was very disappointed in this recipe. I made it exactly as written, and it was very salty and the stuffing mix didn't turn into stuffing, as I had expected. It stayed hard and crunchy on the top of the chicken and the sauce all but disappeared. It was basically salty chicken with cheese with dry stuffing crumbles on the top. Not worth the bother. At the very least, make sure you use a low-sodium soup. The combo of stuffing mix, cheese and regular sodium soup was disastrous.

This was VERY tasty.  I made a few modifications though.  As someone else suggested, I sprinkled the chicken breasts with garlic powder and poultry seasonings prior to adding the soup mixture.  I also used Stove Top Stuffing (turkey flavor since it was all I had) instead of croutons.  My husband raved about how tender and tasty it was.  This dish is extremely easy and quick to prepare.  Next time I'm going to add fresh spinach and mushrooms and see how it does.  Thanks for the recipe!

OMG this is AWESOME. I have no idea why it doesn't have 5 stars.  My whole family loved it and have requested it weekly! I do add a can of mushrooms and a little sour cream to the soup mix first. LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT. Thanks for posting it. :)

This is good, but a few things make it better.  Sprinkle the chicken with lemon pepper. It goes well with it. Also use white wine or white cooking wine instead of milk.  Since some think the top gets too crispy, add the topping later in the cooking process. Update:  It's even good with cornbread stuffing mix.

OH MY GOD!! This was excellent!  Took me maybe 10 minutes to prepare and that was the hardest part of this simple recipe.  My fiance went back for seconds as well as my best friend who is dieting but could not resist.  I took the advice of others and mixed the butter with the bread crumbs before baking and it was great.  Cooked it for 20 minutes longer than the recipe called for and no knife needed for the chicken, so tender.  Thanx for the great recipe, it's a keeper!

Easy and delicious! The only problem we had - we reduced the recipe since my husband and I were the only ones eating, and we used a smaller pyrex dish to bake the chicken in. After baking for the alloted time, we took it out, but under the swiss cheese and in the middle, the chicken wasn't done. I don't know if this came from baking it in a smaller pan or what - we ended up increasing the oven temp and baking for 15 more minutes. Probably our fault - we'll make again!

Easy and delicious!  I used 2 chicken breasts, (1 1/2 slices of swiss on each), sherry instead of milk, stove top chicken flavored stuffing mix and a square casserole dish.  I also pounded the chicken breasts to make sure they came out nice and tender.  Prep time about 5 mins.  I baked covered for 45 minutes and uncovered for 10.  My husband commented twice - very unusual!  Thanks - will make again soon!!!

I have been making this recipe for years.  For those of you who reviewed this as bland or tasteless try the following: Instead of Cream of Mushroom (family don’t care for mushrooms) I use Cream of Chicken with Herbs, this adds wonderful flavor.  I also use extra Swiss cheese. I also cut the chicken into bite-sized chunks.  Before placing the stuffing on the dish I mix the stuffing per the directions on the box.  I then cover the entire dish with foil and remove the foil in the last 15 minutes of cooking.

Delicious. I used 1/8th cup white wine and 1/8th cup sherry in place of the milk and Asiago cheese rather than Swiss because that's what I had. Even with substitutions this was very good. Some reviewers said they felt there wasn't enough cheese. Perhaps its because Swiss cheese is relatively bland. Try Asiago, Kassari or Regianno.
Thanks for sharing Carolyn.

A wonderful dish! My husband and 2 kids (4 yrs and 1 yr) love it.   Easy to prepare and it turns out every time.  I have also used cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken. Very tasty too.

This recipe has a GREAT taste. It was easy enough to make, and worth the baking time to wait. I could barely taste the swiss cheese, so next time I will add two slices over each chicken breast and see if that helps. Over all this one was a winner... no left-overs. Thanks, Carol.

Tasteless, consistancy of boiled chicken.  Not enough stuffing.  Stuffing to watery and buttery.

I grew up eating a chicken casserole that was very similar to this, and it's always been a favorite comfort dish of mine. This recipe is okay as it's written, but I prefer making some changes to it (hence my four-star rating). I cut the chicken breasts into strips before placing them in a baking dish (I think chicken casserole is better either like this or with shredded chicken, so I always do it one way or the other). I usually omit the cheese completely, but I have occasionally used either Swiss or provolone. I prepare Pepperidge Farm stuffing according to the stove top directions first thing. 

Once I have the seasoned chicken in a baking dish, I mix two cans of Cream of Celery soup with 3/4 cup of milk and then mix that into the stuffing. I then pour the stuffing mixture over the chicken, cover it with foil, and bake at 350 for 50 minutes. This version gives you plenty of stuffing, which is ideal for anyone who enjoys stuffing (the original recipe just doesn't produce enough stuffing, in my opinion).

My chicken was raw after 50 minutes.. Also, i would add hot water to stuffing before putting on chicken. Otherwise, stuffing will be crunchy and not soft like a side dish.

This a great recipe! It's a little bland for my liking so I add the spice packet from McComicks chicken in a bag to the stuffing or soup. Adds great flavor! I add all the spice to the stuffing when preparing. I like to prepare stouffers Italian herb stuffing.

Great easy recipe. My only change was using Havarti cheese in place of Swiss and I mixed the soup, milk, stuffing mix and melted butter together before spreading on the cheese covered chicken.

My Hubby and I both like it very much. I made mine with an open jar of mushrooms and topped it with stove top low sodium. I will make this again. I recommend that when you us butter you use unsalted. as I felt that it was a bit salty. But the flavors was very good together.

I have made this three times in less than two months. My kids love it! I also altered it just a bit. I used half milk half pi not grigio white wine, added 8 oz of sour cream and 1 pkg of philly cream cheese. I also added sliced button jarred mushrooms. This is now a family favorite.

Absolutely delicious! I'm not really a cooking type of person and it was so simple and yummy! Definitely going to be a usual dish in our home from now on.

Ok, this was a FANTASTIC template. I followed several other Reviewers recommendations. I cut up my chicken breasts. I also sautéed baby bella mushrooms and shallots in a little bit of olive oil mixed those with the diced chicken Then topped with sliced Swiss cheese. I also used cream of chicken with herbs soup diluted with both milk and a little bit of white wine.  I sprinkled the chicken mixture with 1/4 teaspoon dried thyme as well.  We only had the cornbread stuffing in the pantry so I had to use that and it turned out beautifully.   All in all a wonderful recipe with the modifications. I will post my recipe as it's own separate recipe also.

My family loved this recipe! The first time I made it I pretty much followed the basic recipe and the chicken was very tender and flavorful. Next time I make it I will add a twist or two; the recipe is very versatile!

For this type of recipe, it is five stars.  I cut the chicken into one inch pieces. I added cauliflower and broccoli to the chicken layer.  I substituted wine (but will try sherry next time just to see difference) instead of milk.  I did season the chicken a little, use whatever you like.  I melted the butter and added that to the stuffing mix then poured that on top.  Everyone in this house loved it.  My BF makes a family fondue recipe often and this reminded me of that flavor with the Swiss cheese and wine.  Yum!

I made this for supper tonight - I used 2 cans of soup instead of one.  Put soup on the bottom of pan, then chicken, and then soup again, then stuffing - Was perfect -wasn't dry at all - little extra soup was great for the chicken.

We loved this recipe!  I made a few changes:  1) I cut the chicken breasts in half lengthwise, so that it would cook faster.  To compensate, I doubled the soup, milk, and butter.  I used two 6oz boxes of herb-seasoned stuffing mix and added a dash of white wine (Moscato) to the soup/milk mixture.  I layered frozen broccoli florets after the Swiss cheese and put down the stuffing mix before generously spooning the soup mixture and the butter over the crumbs.  I cooked this on 375 degrees for 50 minutes, which came out perfect.  Oh, and I sprinkled the chicken with the following seasonings:  fresh ground sea salt & black pepper, whole oregano, parsley, celery seed, basil, garlic powder, rosemary, and a little Garden Veggie Dip Mix (Tastefully Simple brand which is basically flakes of red bell pepper, garlic, onion, spinach, carrot, leek, salt, crushed red pepper, oregano, parsley, basil, thyme, & rosemary).  So good!

This meal was very delicious. My husband loved it! However I did change up the recipe.  I used pepper jack cheese instead of Swiss.  This added a nice kick to the chicken.  I did not add any extra butter.  I used stove top.  I cooked the stove top according to the box directions.  I cooked this first and kept it covered while I prepared the chicken.  This allowed the stove top to be soft.  I covered the chicken with aluminum foil.

After reading other reviews, I used white wine instead of milk and Stove Top chicken stuffing (6 oz.). I thought it was ok and my husband really liked it. Next time I will try to find the cream of chicken with herbs and not use the Stove Top. I doubled the sauce mix and used extra cheese, but didn't taste the cheese at all. I think with a less artificially flavored stuffing and more cheese this will be awesome. I would also recommend using more stuffing than called for if you are doubling the sauce, as it was a bit soupy. I also cut the chicken into about 4 pieces per breast.

I made this up exactly by the recipe, thinking of things I could do the next time, but followed directions.  It was quick, easy and truly delicious.  My husband gave it at 8 out of 10 rating and he doesn't like chicken.

DELISH!!!  I used to make this using a little bit of white wine with the soup and milk, but since I don't keep alcohol in the house anymore, I got on here and saw this.  Didn't even miss it.  I put it together and stuck it in the fridge before church this morning to cook this afternoon and used chicken tenders because they cook faster and provolone cheese because we didn't have Swiss at the house, and it turned out WONDERFULLY!  Thanks for an easy, tasty, filling recipe!

Delicious! I would have given it 5 stars but the measurements seem off. The first time I made it there didn't seem to be enough stuffing for the dish. I will try making it again with more stuffing. My boyfriend loved it.

Better tasting than looking.  It was perfect.  I made it with 3 half sized chicken breast to serve 2.  We think the thinner chicken breast is easier to eat.  It was done at 45 mins.

This recipe is really good for those days where you don't have time to fix an elaborate meal. Its the perfect combination! I would not recommend using frozen broccoli as my mother has tried and you end up with a very wet meal. Make it as is and enjoy (:

This recipe was pretty good, i was pleased with it for dinner.  I think next time i will tweak it a little. Maybe add a little cream instead of milk.  I will use a different kind of Stuffing next time also. The cheese made the dish.

Whole family loved this.  Talk about SUPER easy.  I did only use 4 breasts that I seasoned with a bit of Lawrys season salt.  Added extra cheese, increased milk to 1/2 cup.  After cooking mixed the sauce with the stuffing (on my plate)=YUM

Our church recently made this for a Women's Conference meeting but in place of the 1/4 cup of milk, we used a soup can of water,  making it more saucy..  Lots of compliments but found it to be quite rich. Next time I will make it for myself with low fat and low salt condensed chicken soup and add Sherry and mushrooms.

I found this to be pretty tasty and quick, but it was also fairly salty. Use low-sodium cream of chicken soup and low-sodium stuffing mix. I also made it in the crock-pot per reviewer's recommendation.

Loved it! I especially like the option of putting it the crockpot. Anything to save time! Next time, I am going to experiment with different brands of stuffing. Stove Top was ok but I bet Pepperidge Farms would be better.

I wanted to love this but just didn't. Maybe if it was over rice or noodles but it needed more substance. Just okay for this family.

Quick & easy, not too many ingredients, tastes good. Have made it a few times. I've had to improvise and use different types of cheese or soup, still comes out fine. My only complaint is that the stuffing is a little bit hard. Im sure that could easily be remedied.

This was pretty good, a little bland for us though. The addition of the Swiss cheese really helps the flavor of the sauce, but it really didn't do much for the chicken breasts. I think next time I'll cube the chicken and add some broccoli so it's more of a casserole. Thanks for sharing :)

This recipe has been in my family for years and we have tried many variations.  I add one can of cream of mushroom soup, sour cream and red wine and omit the milk.  For a kick, use monterey jack cheese with jalapenos instead of swiss.  Serve over rice with some steamed broccoli.  Yum!

Delicious!  I used cream of mushroom soup instead of chicken and I really enjoyed the different flavor.  I also used a little more stuffing, added some sherry to the milk and even put a little white wine in with with the stuffing.  My husband had seconds and while my kids didn't love the soup and stuffing part (VERY picky eaters!), it was easy enough for them to push it to the side and eat just the chicken.  Going in to rotation in my house!

I haven't actually tried it yet because the chicken didn't cook through! I tried to serve it to my family, and the chicken was still pink after 50 min. I put it back in for 20 minutes and am anxious to try it. Meanwhile, my family had to eat something else because they were starving:(

this was delicious!  i dont know what some folks are talking about when they say it was bland...but i used the stove top seasoned chicken stuffing mix with it and it was yummo! i did give it a sprinkle of chicago steak seasoning, but i think pepper and garlic was all that it needed.  i think the suggestions as to weather to mix it with butter first, then sprinkle on top...as opposed to just drizzling the butter is sort of like weather you like your stuffing cooked in the bird or outside the bird :)  i like mine crunchier, so i went with the recipes suggestion, and it was great.  i did one stray from the recipe, i added broccoli and that was a great combo.  My 4 year old asked if we could make it again soon, and my husband gobbled his up too...so i took that as a good thing and plan to add it to our menu often.  Delicious comfort food that the family loves!  :)

I received the Allrecipes cookbook the other day and this was the first recipe I tried out of it. I thought it was delicious! The stuffing on top gets a little crunchy and then the flavor of the Swiss cheese mixed with it is out of this world good.

I had to try this as soon as I saw this recipe! I've been making a similar dish for years (with cheddar cheese, broccoli cheese soup, and croutons). This was a wonderful change! I used cream of mushroom soup, and sliced some fresh mushrooms to put in the stuffing, all ingredients I had laying around, and I added a little water to the stuffing and let it sit before putting it on top of the chicken. And like other reviewers, added some salt, pepper, garlic powder, and parsley. This is a great dish, and will be making this again! Next time, I'll make double!

5-stars cause hubby really liked it and it was about the simplist, easiest meal to make for as much flavor as you get.   I was afraid it might be a little bland so I added a bit of italian seasoning to the stuffing.

A good dinner.  The broccoli add is a real must.  I'd love to get a little more flavor into this though, maybe some spice on the chicken or some other seasoning as with the exception of the stuffing mix it does come off a bit bland.

I tried this and my family loved it!  One tip . .. if you want to kick it up a notch, use alapeno havarti cheese.  The spice of the hot peppers takes this recipe over the top!

I used cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken and added some chopped broccoli. Overall, this was a pretty good dish, though I think the re-heated leftovers actually tasted better than the dish did right out of the oven. To me, it was just a little bland, despite the fact that I made sure to add plenty of seasoning. It was still good, though, and something that I'll likely make again.

My husband LOVED this and I have to admit, I cleaned my plate too. I used 3 chicken breasts and sliced them up in thirds before putting in a 9x9 pan. If using more meat, the sauce and stuffing would need to be doubled (if you like plenty of sauce with your chicken). This is a great easy meal to feed a hungry hub and kids on a weeknight. Don't add salt; there is plenty in the stuffing mix and soup. Surprisingly actually does take about an hour to cook the chicken through so plan ahead timewise.

Made this last night for my men beasts.  Cubed the chicken before placing it in the pan.  Seasoned with garlic powder and cracked pepper.  Used 8oz. of shredded sharp cheddar cheese and the whole box of Stove Top Herb suffing mixed with 1/2 cup of melted butter. Can only say, "Eat em up--yum-yum."

Very easy and tastes great.  What more do you need?  I do mix the butter and the stuffing together before putting it on the chicken.

I thought this dish was very good and my hd loved it. Per other reviews, I made the following changes: Used white wine in place of milk.  This is what gave the flavor to the dish.  Also sprinkled salt, pepper, garlic-garlic and onion flakes on the chicken.  Mixed the stuffing with the melted butter before placing on top of chicken and uncovered for 10 mins after cooking covered for 50 mins.  Will make again.

Used white wine instead of milk as suggested. It gave it more of a cordon blue taste to it. This was good, very easy to do at lunch and have ready by the time I come home! I do like the Chicken Cordon Blue II recipe better though!

With a few changes, I might make it again.  First, I cut the chicken into bite sized pieces.  Next, you need about 2 times the amount of sauce it calls for.  I followed other suggestions and substituted 1/2 the milk with sherry.  If you double the sauce, only put it about 1/4 cup sherry total or it's a little overwhelming.  Use milk for the rest as called for.  I also doubled the stuffing mixture which I thought was the best part, so I didn't want to skimp on that!  Pretty good after the changes.  Hubby loved it.  (Note to myself, use 4-6 pieces of chicken cut up into bite sized pieces.)

I took others advice and added a splash of sherry to the soup mixture, very good touch. I also cut the breasts into 1 inch strips added salt and garlic powder over the chicken and covered that layer of chicken completely with swiss. I saw others reviews and decided to prepare my stuffing first, very very good. moist and the chicken was juicy. Will make this again.

This recipe just didnt do it for us.  I thought it was very soupy and liquidy.  I guess I expected it to be cheesy and gooey.  It also was very bland.

Mine came out soupy but that was my fault for adding the whole can of soup for only 3 chicken breasts. I added sour cream to the soup and milk and it was good.  Next time, i plan on using the crock pot way and also cubing my meat and maybe even adding some broccoli.

I thought it was great and used a few reviewers' comments to make it scrumptious--used cream of mushroom soup, sprinkled chicken with garlic powder, and threw in as much broccoli that would fit. Next time I'll use the crockpot and loads more broccoli!

I've tried a few of these "Swiss" chicken recipes, and this one is the best by FAR! The stuffing mix on top was not dry all all, making it a much better dish! I pounded the cutlets a little bit, and only used 3. I also used stove-top cornbread stuffing, and it was delicious. Next time I would add a sprinkle of salt, and a splash of sherry wine for more flavor, but this one is a keeper. Quick,,easy and yummy!

I cut up the chicken and used a whole brick of swiss, cut into chunks.  I added a bag of frozen broccoli and some leftover bacon.  I also added sour cream because it was in my fridge.  it was very good, but next time I think I would leave out the bacon.

Absolutely a keeper with the suggested changes of other reviews.  I used white wine for milk; added frozen carrots & broccoli (to make it a one-dish meal); seasoned the chicken with lemon pepper and garlic and cooked about half done; placed half of stuffing on bottom and half on top.  Definitely wanted 2nds on this one.  Cut chicken breasts in half, next time will cut into 1" pieces as another review suggested because my chicken wasn't moist enough for my taste.

Delicious!  Followed recipe exactly.  Next time I will mix the melted butter and the stuffing.  I will also cube the chicken.  (Except one piece which I will leave whole so I can scrape off the stuffing for my incredibly picky son.)  DH and kids enjoyed!

I followed the recipe perfectly. Wasnt that impressed with it. My boyfriend loved it though, but i just thought the recipe needed more. Definently more sauce and seasonings in there. Also wasnt cheesy enough for me either. If i made it again i think i would put shredded swiss cheese on there and pour the sauce over the chicken before i put the cheese on. And I would also mix the butter with the stuffing in a bowl before i put it over the chicken, because you could tell that some of the stuffing is softer than the other pieces and its because of the butter not getting over everything. Great start to a recipe though, just needs some tweeking. go with your instincts with what u think would taste good!

I think, if I make this again, I'll use cream of celery or mushroom soup, maybe more diced celery and onion and diced garlic. The chicken soup makes it too rich. The swiss cheese is an interesting change from cheddar - lighter. Glad I only made enough for two individual servings (two meals for me.)

My family loved this recipe.  The onnly change I made was browning the chicken and using cream of mushroom soup.  Fabulous, will make again!

Easy to make and the family loved it!  I too put it in the crockpot, used soy milk instead of regular milk and omitted the butter.

This is a very good recipe.  We like boneless, skinless chicken thighs as a matter of preference.   I used liberal amounts of salt free lemon-pepper seasoning and then browned the thighs.  I removed the thighs from the pan and then deglazed the pan with two cans of the chicken soup.  I put the thighs in the baking dish and topped them with 8 oz. of shredded swiss and then the soup mixed together with 1/2 cup of milk. I nestled the chopped frozen broccoli on top of the soup. I tossed 3 cups of herb seasoned stuffing mix with a stick of butter and sprinkled this on top of everything. We ended up with delicious chicken and broccoli in a nice cheese (but not too cheesy) sauce.  The stuffing provides a great texture contrast.  This rates five stars, and I am sure we be putting it into the "regular rotation."

This was delicious.   I followed "gymmom's" advice and made this in the crockpot.   We had my parents over for dinner and it was a huge hit with them and my husband.   Will definately make this again.  Thanks !

This was definately a HUGE winner with my husband.. I loved it too.. not the healthiest meal on the planet, but hey, it could be worse right?!! I highly recommend trying it at least once.. so quick and easy you just have to wait for it to bake. I made the recipe as is and it was perfectly moist and delish... I wouldn't mess with it!

This was great!  I did forget to cover it but did so about halfway through and all it did was give the stuffing a little crunch, but we thought it was great that way.  Also, substituted white wine for the milk as others suggested, and since I didn't have any swiss cheese, I used shredded mozzarella and a little shredded parmesan.  Will be making this again!

This was really good and easy to make!  I made a few changes: skipped on the swiss cheese, cut the chicken into bite size pieces then mixed it with the cream of chicken (with herbs), milk, a can of VegAll (drained), made Stove Top stuffing (low sodium) and then added that to the top.  Cooked for about 40 minutes at 400 (with aluminum foil).  Thanks for the recipe.

I discovered too late that I did not have cream of chicken soup so I was forced to substitute low sodium, low fat cream of mushroom soup. It was quite bland and salty. Would not make again, even w/the cream of chicken. It was just kinda funky.

This was really good - fast and easy to make.  I don't cook using anything with trans-fats in it, so rather than use a stuffing mix, I melted the butter, added 1/2 tsp herb seasoning with a few sprinkles of paprika - stirred it, then added about 2C worth of diced bread; stirred until the bread soaked up all the butter, then put it onto the top of the mix.  Turned out awesome!!

My family and I thought this was delicious!  I really only expected a mediocre but easy chicken casserole, but instead enjoyed a wonderful and tasty meal.  I used more stuffing crumbs then recommended and am glad I did that- use more- maybe 3-4 cups?  Also, used a can and a half of the soup and more milk, accordingly.   FYI:  Unbaked, it freezes beautifully- just defrost and cook.  Yum!

I didn't have cream of chicken soup so I made my own. Pretty tasty but next time I'll have to make the swiss cheese slices thicker because the swiss cheese came out crunchy.

Very good. I would recommend mixing the butter and stuffing mix together then pour over chicken.  Butter didn't go very far when just drizzled over top.

I made this almost exactly as it was written. The only changes I made were using Cream of Chicken & Mushroom and I added some mushrooms with the chicken and cheese. I had no problem at all with crunchy stuffing and the entire family loved it! My youngest daughter said she wanted to take some leftovers for her school lunch and when she was informed that she was eating the last of it, she said "You can just cook more of this tomorrow!" Great recipe!

I used crushed cornflakes shaken in a plastic baggie with some melted butter instead of stuffing mix. I baked without cornflakes for 25 min. covered then removed the cover, added cornflakes, and baked for the remaining time. I also seasoned the chicken with onion powder, fresh garlic, and herb seasoning. I added a dash of cayenne pepper, onion powder and herb seasoning to the crushed cornflakes. So good!

This is pretty good.  I hold on rating 5 stars unless a recipe really wows me, but in this case I actually wish I could rate it 4 1/2 - and the extra half star would be for the ease of preparing this recipe.   The flavor is good.  Unlike others, I had no trouble with the stuffing drying out.  I have to wonder if those having that problem are not covering the dish properly.  It seems as though the steam under the foil keeps the stuffing moist.  The only changes I made was slight - I used extra milk with the soup mix just because we prefer things saucier. Also, I cut each chicken breast in three pieces, making it a little more like a casserole. In all, it's well worth the few minutes it takes to put together.

Very easy and good recipe. I like my food WELL-seasoned, so I seasoned both sides of the chicken with freshly ground black pepper, paprika, and a little salt. I also added pepper, paprika, garlic powder and dried herbs to the soup mixture. I didn't have swiss cheese on hand, so I used some slices of cheddar and monterey jack. It tasted great, but didn't look that appetizing, so next time I'll add some peas and carrots for color.

This was pretty good for an easy meal. Cooked in crock pot on high for about 4 hours. I used cornbread stuffing mix, but will use herb stuffing mix in the future.

Easy, quick and great tasting. Cubed the chicken, used shredded swiss. Mixed the Stove Top dressing according to directions so it was moist, used wine & milk, covered casserole for first 30 minutes and uncoved for the last 20 minutes. Enough for another dinner tonight, there is only 2 of us.

I have made this so many times I've lost count. DELICIOUS!!!! It's truly amazing. The stuffing cooking in the oven smells like Thanksgiving all over again. I have made it with cream of mushroom soup, and got a richer taste. Easy, and tastes great, what more could you ask for?

I've tried this recipe with full chicken breasts as well as bite size pieces, I prefer the pieces as they seem to cook more evenly.  I substituted chardonnay for the milk and added a bag of frozen, chopped broccoli on top of the soup/wine.  Great recipe, thanks!

Really good!! I put mine in the crock pot and use frozen chicken breasts. Cook for 5 hrs. on LOW. Turns out perfect! (I use the reduced sodium cream of chicken soup) Otherwise it tends to be too salty for our taste. Cream of mushroom works great too in this recipe :-) Super easy, and one of those super comfort foods!

This is super good! The whole family loved it. My husband threw everything in the crock pot in the morning and it was ready for dinner. Chicken was very moist and not dried out. Excellent meal. Will definitely have this again!

My family really enjoyed this meal.  It was easy to make, which I really enjoyed!  I followed the recipe as it was written, except I used stove top stuffing because that is what I had on hand. The only other thing I did was cut the chicken into pieces so it was thinner and so it would cook faster.  All the kids ate it and my husband really liked it, and he doesn't usually like stuffing.  This will be made again.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This is delicious and simple.  The first time I made it as written...yum. The second time I added a layer of proscuitto under the swiss cheese and pounded the breasts. My husband loves it!

This is a fantastic recipe. However I did make a couple of changes. First I cubed the chicken in to 1/2-inch cubes (boneless skinless chicken breast). I also added 1 cup of water to the stuffing, I don't like hard crunchy bread on the top of things, I used chicken stove top. Finally, I put on 1/2 cup of shredded jack cheese and then swiss. The stronger flavored jack with the swiss made for a wonderful flavor. Finally I add 1/4 cup of chicken stock to the broth as I wanted this a little more moist.

This is a family staple recipe that I received from a friend 35 years ago. Except, instead of the milk, we use 1/4 c. dry white wine (chablis).  I eliminated the butter on top years ago. We also cut the chicken into bite size chunks (1") which makes the recipe easier to serve on a buffet, and guests do not have to struggle to cut the chicken on their laps. Great all purpose recipe to serve with vegetable and/or salad.

A great, easy, and quick meal for a cold winter night.  Family loved it.  Just 2 suggestions:  Use lower sodium stuffing mix and use 2 cans of soup (healthy choice) and 2/3 cups milk.  Otherwise 5 stars from me!

i usually make low fat substitutions with recipes, and they don't hold up, but this one does! i use healthy request soup, reduced fat swiss cheese, smart balance light and skim milk and it still tastes rich and wonderful. i also use canned chicken - which makes things easier, and i added frozen peas. it cooked up to perfection! this is now one of my "usuals"

This came out great.  Tasty and easy. Added some fresh chopped mushrooms, carrot, onion, and celery. Sprinkled some chicken seasoning on the chicken and it came out great.

Very good as written.  Made with one pound boneless skinless chicken breast pounded down.  Used lower sodium soup.  Tossed stuffing mix with melted butter before putting on top.

This was okay. I think if I make it a second time I'll cook the stuffing before adding it to the casserole...The stuffing was really crunchy so I had to kind of mix everything together after it was baked to get the stuffing to absorb moisture. My husband didn't like this recipie at all, but it was okay for me.

This is a very good quick meal to make  after working all day.  You can use lower fat ingredients to make it healthier.  I also add a piece of boiled ham on top of each chicken breast to make it into Cordon Bleu.

This sounded good and I had all the ingredients on hand for a quick Sunday dinner.  I followed the recipe but added some frozen brocoli florets.  It was just o.k.  A little bland for our taste.  I wish I would've used white wine in place of milk, per others suggestions. My husband will add Texas Pete hot sauce to a dish if he thinks it's just "o.k."  Well I did the same this time and my kids followed our lead.  It actually did taste better with hot sauce. Wouldn't make this recipe again.

I just made this for dinner tonight.  We loved it.  However, I would add more stuffing mix and find a lower sodium chicken soup.  Will most definitely prepare it again.  Thanks for great dinner recipes.

We had this for dinner a few nights ago. I made it in the slow cooker with partially frozen thinly sliced chicken breasts.I cooked on high for 2 hours and then turned down to low for 2. I'm only giving it 4 stars because you couldn't really taste the swiss cheese...My crock pot cooks very quickly and I think I may have over cooked it! I will be making this again, but will only cook on low for 4 hours. It really was delicious and I think it will be 5 stars with the adjustment. Thanks for the recipe!

This was good, I'd prob make it again. I diced my chicken and didnt read the directions very well because I added a can(from the soup) of milk instead of just 1/4 cup. But it turned out fine. Oh and I used cheddar as I was out of swiss.

Awesome recipe.  I added red wine, it was all I had.  The color was a bit off, but tasted great.  With the wine, the recipe is 5.5 Stars, without wine, the recipe gets 5 stars.

OMG~This was an all time favorite for me. I am not usually a fan of stuffing type recipes, but I was wanting a warm dish. I had to make adjustments on the cream of celery to  cream of mushroom because that is all I had and I think that made it all the better for me! I did season the chicken a little with salt & pepper and garlic powder. 
Very easy recipe!

We LOVE this recipe.  The only thing I did differently was to add a couple of cups of slightly cooked broccoli before I added the soup/milk mixture.  The broccoli makes it a more complete one-dish meal.

This was so easy and so delicious!  I used the milk, but I think I will try the white wine.  I also used herbed cream of chicken soup.  I would also suggest adding a bag of broccoli.  Your kids probably won't even notice the vegetables!

This is very good and super easy to make. I'm not a fan of any canned soups so I made my own - it's very easy. YOu make a white sauce - equal flour and butter, cook till it bubbles. Then slowly add chicken stock or milk till it gets thick. Voila. 

I grilled the chicken first in my George Foreman, put it in the dish, poured white sauce over, put some uncooked mushrooms and peas over that, then cheese over that, then stuffing over that then cooked it about 15 minutes.

This was delicious!  I however, used a cut up rotisserie chicken, evenly spread out on the bottom of the dish.  I then sprinkled it with a 5 oz. bag of shredded swiss cheese.  I followed the rest of the recipe after that - but only baked it for 30 minutes at 350 degrees.  My family loved it - definitely a keeper!

Easy to make and tasty. Had absolutely no leftovers. Reminded me of chicken cordon blue with the flavor, just needed some ham.

Pretty good recipe. I chopped up the chicken before putting it in the casserole. I also used corn bread stuffing mix instead. I also put the swiss cheese on top instead of in the middle and added french's onions. Enjoy

One tip: the cornbread stuffing will not be moist...it will be crispy. It was really good though.

Made this for a quick ad hoc dinner party.  Looked easy and quick and it was!  Everyone liked it and there was not a single bit of it left.  Only one minor compaint is that it was on the border of being too salty.  So next time I am going to try to used the reduced sodium cream of chicken soup, or make my own dressing.  Not really sure what the culprit was.  Chicken was moist and flavorful.

Followed the recipe perfectly and... blah. The casserole was not horrible, but certainly not 4.5 stars! I added broccoli and fresh mushrooms as recommended. Needs some more zip!

This has become one of my staple recipes. It's delicious and makes for great leftovers! I make a couple of changes: I cut up the chicken into ~1 inch pieces and season with Lemon Pepper and Garlic powder. I also use a bag of shredded assorted Italian cheese (just because I like it more than Swiss). Still tastes great, though.

I love this recipe!! It's so easy to whip up on a work night, especially since you don't need to pre-cook the chicken.  I just add a little extra stuffing and about 3-4 more tablespoons of margarine.  Yum!!

My family scarfed it up!  It was a quick easy meal.  I used white wine as other suggested.  I think next time I will try the milk.  Also I put too much butter (1/2 c. like someone suggested) and the stuffing was soggy.  I should have tried the recipe without changes!  But still my family liked it and we will make again!

This recipe was very good!  I would highly recommend it.  I don't really like stuffing that much, so I cut that down to one cup instead of the two cups, but it gave it a nice crunch.  I also used cream of chicken soup with herbs and it added a lot of flavor.  Will make this one again for sure!

Overall it was an recipe and tasty.

I thought this was really tasty and very simple to make.  A great one-dish meal.  I added some left over green beans on top of the cheese and we used shredded mozzerella instead of Swiss ( I hate Swiss cheese) and it turned out great.  I love the stuffing.

This was yummy! Totally easy and quick. I didn't have the smaller pan, so I put it in a 13x9. The stuffing on the edges wasn't burnt, but it was pretty crispy so I do think the smaller pan is needed. I would like to try it in the crock pot. It was very good and one of my favorites that I've tried from this site!

Very good!  This was a hit here at my house ~ my hubby is not a big chicken fan, but loved this dish!  He even went back for seconds.  The chicken was so tender :)  

The only complaint that I have is that it seemed very full of salt ~ which I know came from the stuffing. Anyone know how to make a less salty type stuffing or one that I could buy?

Easy to make and tastes great.  The chicken comes out very tender and soft.  I added broccoli, which is definitely an improvement.  Another time, I tried it with chopped fresh parsley.  I highly recommend adding some paprika and red pepper to the mix.

This made for a frustrating night.  I followed the directions to a T, and ended up with raw chicken covered with crunchy stuffing mix (and the oven works fine!).  It sounded good, anyways.

This is a great dish.  We all love it at our house! The only difference is I use 1/2 cup melted butter with the stuffing and bake the dish, uncovered.  I put the butter drenched stuffing on top for the last 15 minutes and it has some crispness to it!  YUM!

My family really enjoyed this and is was super easy to make. The only ingredient I substituted was cream of celery soup instead of cream of chicken soup as it was what I had on hand.

Delicious! I added a can of Campbell’s Italian seasoned cream of chicken soup because they were out of the regular kind and it was even better than before.  I will definitely make this again.  Quick and easy.  My boyfriend loved it.

This was just ok. I did make some changes - added seasoning to the chicken b/c it sounded like there wasn't enough flavor from other reviews, I decreased chicken, and used cream of celery soup. Also my stuffing was seasoned not herb, so I admit I didn't follow the recipe but I did get the idea. It was fine, but it wasn't something that made me or my husband say "MMMM- this is SO good!" It was just ok. So I won't make it again.

Pretty good.  I used cream of mushroom with roasted garlic (didn't have any cream of chicken).  I also seasoned the chicken with cajun seaoning before putting on the cheese.  We enjoyed this.

Very simple to make and tasted great!  The only thing I did different was toss the stuffing in the melted butter to fully coat it instead of just drizzling it on top.  Turned out delicous!  I think next time I might add some broccoli to make it a complete meal.

I guess I'm the exception here, but I've cooked this recipe twice and still find it so bland and visually unappealing.  First time I made this to a T - very bland and full of 'canned' flavor.  Second time, I took advice of others by using white wine instead of milk, using provolone and making sure the stuffing was mixed well with the soup mix.  Terrible.  The sauce was so bitter and strong from the wine - my kids (5 & 2 yr. old) couldn't eat it.  Moms - don't add wine if you're making for kids.  And the stuffing was soggy and the chicken was swimming in soup - as usual.  The melted cheese just ended up being melted in with the soup mix.  Flavorless despite all the additions - will not bother with again.

This turned out awesome.  Everyone in the family loved it and I did not find it that salty.  We did take a suggestion and use two cans of cream of chicken soup rather than one.  This will be something we try again soon.

Pretty good, but it was a little salty. I made only using 2 chicken breats (only 2 of us), but used the same amount of all other ingredients -- this method would be better with some green beans or broccoli added since there is a lot of stuffing. I also had to use an italian cheese blend -- I thought I had swiss but I was out. Also, I used sherry in place of the milk as recommended in other reviews.

I will make it again, but will use veggies and swiss next time.

Very tasty but a little salty.  We used cream of mushroom soup instead and that may have been the reason why???  I used a whole can of cream of mushroom for 2 chicken breasts.  It was the moistest chicken I have ever eaten.

It was excellent!  Except I used cream of mushroom soup instead, because I didn't have the cream of chicken, and it turned out great.  I think that I would'vd used the cream of mushroom soup instead even if I had the cream of chicken.  I used chicken flavored stuffing also.  I a great casserole if you're really busy.  You can throw it together in the morning and cook it in the evening.

This was wonderful comfort food!  I used boneless chicken thighs, golden mushroom soup and Marsala wine instead of milk.  I also mixed the butter and stuffing before spreading on top of chicken mixture.  I was pleasantly surprised at how easy and good this turned out!

This is good comfort-food with absolutely no fuss.  I used cream of celery soup and sprinkled a bit of garlic powder and lemon pepper on the chicken before the cheese.  I did as others said and doubled the cheese, and I baked it for about 45 minutes (covered) before adding the topping because the chicken was still partially frozen.  I didn't add as much stuffing as recommended because I was afraid it would soak up all the sauce, and I left the butter out completely.  I'll definitely make it again - my kids loved it.  It's just a good, basic, home-cooking kind of dish.  We had it with green beans and acorn squash, and it was very satisfying on a cold fall day!

I made this last night for my husband and loved it.  The chicken turns out really moist.  I used cream of celery soup instead of cream of chicken because that's all I had on hand.  It was super easy and I'd definitly make it again.

This recipe is perfect to make when you have little time or don't feel like cooking because it's easy and fast.  I thought it was pretty good, chicken was very moist - not a favourite of mine but would probably make again because it was so easy.  Maybe add more cheese?  A suggestion might be to add more cheese - I didn't notice the flavour at all.

Awesome! Only made a few minor changes: I cut up the chicken in chunks because I wanted to make sure there weren't any parts that didn't get done. I used a little more milk because I like my sauce a little thinner and used a bit of provolone because I didn't have enough Swiss. Got lots of compliments and requests for the recipe. Will definitely make again!

Good recipe not great but good for a quick easy week night meal. Used white wine instead of milk and chicken herb cream soup for more flavor. used pepperjack cheese along with swiss we like lots of cheese and it kicks up the fiavor a little, when I have more time I also add lots of italian spices to stuffing mix (basil,thmye,oregano,italian seasoning).

Taste was above average for a chicken casserole,
and so *very* easy to make.  (I joked with my
wife that preheating the oven was not only
1 of the 4 instructions, but also 25% of the
work.)

This was ok - dont know if I make it again, if I do I might skip the stuffing. I think thats what was bothering me. It was overpowering the flavor of everything else.

Love this recipe!  I use 1/4 cup of apple juice instead of milk, it seems to reduce the saltiness of the cream of chicken soup.

Very good recipe. The family likes this one. I feel that this could have been improved upon by using more cheese and more stuffing. This was a nice change from the usual chicken dishes. I make something very similar to this in the slow cooker that is to die for. It includes chicken broth to help the stuffing set. This one is worthy of a try in your home.

YUMMY!  Simply delicious!  Very juicy and the stuffing was moist on the bottom and crispy on the top.  My only changes were using on 3 large breasts and baking an additional 10 minutes to crisp the top.

Delicious!   I have used both  cream of chicken soup and cream of mushroom soup.   Both taste great.  I have passed this recipe along to many friends and family members - everyone raves about it.

Would not make this again. Even tho I followed the recipe, there did not seem to be enough of anything (except meat). The ingredients looked like they were for a pan 1/2 the size, but I went ahead & made it anyway. Should have used a smaller pan! The flavor was good & the chicken moist, but I think that could be accomplished by just baking the chicken in the soup mixture. I expected to have sauce left in the dish to spoon over potatoes. No such luck. The sauce cooked down too much for that. The stuffing on the top got too crunchy even tho the pan was covered. Over all this was disappointing.

My fiance loved this recipe.  He said it's one that I can definately make again, although he loves anything with stuffing or cheese:)  I thought the chicken was sort of "chewy", but maybe I'll cook it longer next time I make it.

I've been making this for years. Delicious.  I use chicken tenders instead of breasts. They seem to absorb the flavors better. It's a delicious leftover dish too.

I would add another can of soup and another 1/4 cup of melted butter.  The dressing was to dry for me.  Otherwise, it is a delicious and quick meal to throw together.

I fixed this for a late lunch. It is a great starter recipe. Next time I make it I think I will dice the chicken into bite sized pieces and season it with garlic powder, onion powder, and fresh ground pepper before adding it to the greased baking dish. I think I will use the full box of stuffing mix (3 cups) and up the butter to 6 tablespoons. I may even add more Swiss cheese, use cream of chicken and herbs soup instead of the regular cream of chicken soup, and use dry white wine instead of the milk.

My husband actually used the word “perfect”! I added a bit of white wine in with the soup mixture, as well as a couple shakes of dry mustard and a tiny touch of nutmeg. I also seasoned the chicken breast first with salt, pepper, and adobo (standard in my house). I’ve also added various frozen vegetables to the borders of the casserole dish, and I’ve tried it with different “cream of” soups - any way you try it, it comes out “perfect”!

We liked this a lot. I made a few changes because I wanted a one dish meal. I put frozen French style cut green beans on the bottom of the casserole dish.  I sautéed some onions, mushrooms and garlic and put that on top of the beans. Used 4 breasts and cut the chicken in bite size pieces and gave a quick sauté, just to brown the chicken and then put in the casserole dish. Layered the cheese then the sauce as directed. Prepared the stuffing as per directions on the box, then topped the casserole. Baked at 350 covered for 40 mins, then uncovered for 10 mins to crisp up the top. Was quick and easy and had great results for what it is. Nothing gourmet, but good comfort food and was satisfying. I will make this again

I made this recipe with 6 large chicken breasts (cleaned).  I spread a little of the soup mixture on the bottom of the pan and I also combined cream of celery soup with seasoned salt and ground black pepper.  It was delicious!

Next time I will cook at 400 for an hour. Chicken wasn’t cooked thoroughly after 50 minutes at 350. Will probably cut chicken breasts in half also.

It was good. A basic comfort food casserole. I did put more of the dressing on top than the recipe calls for. I also seasoned the chicken with poultry seasoning to pull all the flavors together.

I loved how easy this recipe was.  I thought the chicken was delicious, but the stuffing a little dry.   It's definitely a keeper, but next time I'll pour a dash of chicken broth on top of the stuffing mix.   I know I could add butter slivers, but I prefer the less greasy option.

When I read a review I want to see how the recipe tasted BEFORE people "doctor" it up.  I made this strictly according to the recipe.  It is not good.  For one thing, the stuffing on top is crunchy.  I recommend mixing the stuffing with the melted butter then spooning it on top.  Drizzling the butter over the top does not work.  I am not a beginning cook.  I know my way around the kitchen and this is sub par.  It may be easy, but it's not good.

I made cutlets out of the chicken and seasoned them with garlic, onion powder and some Trader Joes "21 salute" seasoning. Added white Wine instead of milk. I only had cream of celery soup but added some chicken seasoning to it and turned out just fine. I added fresh Mushrooms on top of Chicken. Next time will add some chopped Walnuts to the Bread crumbs. This is good enough for guests.  Served with a Salad and French bread. Was wonderful. I will keep making this again and again. Thank you.

I made this recipe with what I had on hand.  I had to substitute sliced provolone cheese for the Swiss cheese.  I seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper and garlic powder.  I used 3 cups  of dried stuffing as opposed to 2.

So...I liked this meal.  Easy to make and it was tasty.  Don’t think I would make this for company but it Is still a good family meal.  I will make it again.  Who knows, I might actually follow the recipe next time!  :)

I did use thinner chicken breasts and don't care for stuffing. So I added a rice/quinoa blend and it was awesome! One of my hubby favorites. Thanks for the great recipe.

I really wanted to like this one, but it just didn't do it for me.  I made as written.  It wasn't bad, in fact, out of the oven, it was fairly tasty, a little soggy, and very messy, but a decent dinner. It just did not reheat well at all, which was a little disappointing.  

I might try making a scaled down version of this, but it wasn't really anything to write home about.

This was really good.  Simple recipe, moist chicken.  I used boneless chicken thighs and breasts, added fresh sliced mushrooms over the chicken and cream of chicken soup.  I also made the stuffing recipe by the directions, just used a bit less liquid and spooned it over the top.  Drizzled olive oil over the stuffing and baked.  Really a keeper recipe.

I made this for a pot luck and had unanimous requests for the recipe, so thought I would share my experience.  I made a few additions to this recipe and normally I don't think its fair to rate recipes I have changed, but this is the exception. I sautéd 1 diced onion in the butter and added to 2 pkg dressing, along with 1 1/2 cups chicken broth. In another bowl I combined 2 cans of cream of chicken soup, 8 oz sour cream, and 1 cup broth, and mixed well. I layered in a large pan in this order: dressing, chicken, and soup mixture. Topped with paprika and baked as directed. I think its good enough for a holiday dinner!

I made it healthier and better! I cubed my chicken into 1 inch pieces, added 10-12 finely chopped Cremini (brown) mushrooms, 1/2 finely chopped sweet onion and 2 stalks chopped celery. Browned all the above about 5-7 minutes, then followed the of  recipe (also used low fat cream of chicken
Soup AND reduced fat Swiss cheese) was AWESOME!!'

Excellent.  I made this with turkey tenderloins.  I put a layer of mashed potatoes on the bottom and doubled the cheese over the turkey.  I also added diced celery, onion and red bell peppers.  I made it in a 9"x 13" pan with gluten-free stuffing on top.  It was just like Thanksgiving dinner.  I served it with cranberry sauce.

I have made this casserole for years.  The recipe I found was called "stuffing good chicken".  I like the option to replace the milk with white wine. I prepare one bag of pepperidge farm herb stuffing and omit the butter drizzle. If doubling it for a crowd I use two cans of soup ( One cream of chicken and 1 cream of mushroom or cream of celery) and 2 bags of prepared stuffing.  Cornbread stuffing is good also!  This recipe is a family favorite and also a great quick meal for company or potlucks!

My family loved this!  I read many of the reviews and concentrated on #18, but I also added the following:  I browned sage leaves in butter and folded those into the stuffing, soup, onion mix, and I also layered 1/2 cup of shredded Asiago cheese on top of the Swiss.  Yummy!

Turned out great!  I only used 3 chicken breasts, pounded flat, and cut into portion-sized pieces with the same ingredients as recipe.  I used only the amount of cheese necessary to cover each piece of chicken.   Easy and delicious.

This was amazing! I did alter the recipe a bit. Not because I found anything wrong with it. I've just never been good at following directions and coloring inside the lines. I used cream of onion soup and seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, garlic, and thyme.  I also added some chopped bacon  to the chicken before putting the cheese on. With about 10 minutes of cooking time left I sprinkled the top with some shredded swiss and those crunchy french fried onions. Yeah, the coworkers were jealous of my left overs all week! I will definitely be  making this again.

Made this last night. Didn't have any soup, so made a highly seasoned white sauce with cooked onions. Threw in a few mixed veggies and we had a very, very tasty supper. Will be making this often.

Quick and easy for sure! I would recommend seasoning the chicken a bit. Although to be fair, I followed the recipe exactly and it still tasted good, it would've have been just a little better with some salt and pepper.

I used 1 packages of stuffing mix and tossed with the butter to distribute better and keep it moist.  Also added some cooking wine and water instead of milk to soup.  My family loved it and the extra stuffing made it more of a topping/side dish.  So quick, easy and good!

We switch out the Swiss for  pepper jack for a little kick - it's awesome!  I also mix the butter in with the stuffing before putting that on. I use the butter and a little water to make sure all of the stuffing is a little damp before putting on top.

My wife and I both loved this. We used leftover chicken from a chicken slow cooker recipe that we were not too fond of--too bland.   Didn't have any  Swiss cheese so I used Munster.  Also gave it a good helping of garlic powder. Worked just fine.   I  think if I make this again I will try cream of mushroom soup instead of chicken soup just to see.   But this was really really good.

I've been making this casserole for three years now. It's bland if you stick to the recipe, but I love a "kick" so I did a few things differently.  I seasoned the chicken breasts with salt, black pepper, paprika and garlic powder. I added all 9 slices of Sargento's Swiss, added another 1/4 cup of milk to the cream of chicken mixture and added one more cup of bread crumbs. I'm very happy with the results! One more thing, 50 minutes isn't enough and you'll want to to keep it in the oven for an hour and forty five minutes.

This recipe is delicious and so easy. Since there are only two of us, I used 1 pound of chicken tenders. I kept everything else the same, except I only used half of the stuffing.  We loved it and had leftovers the next day.

This is a favourite when I need something with little prep time. I use chicken cutlets rather than full breasts, but I left it a five star rating since I don't think this is a big change. Very tasty, very easy. Thank you!

I turned it into a sort of philly casserole  .    After layering the cheese I added green peppers mushrooms and onions. Then I used one can of cream of chicken with herbs and one can of cream of mushroom.  mix them together with 3 tablespoons of A1 sauce  & a  quarter cup of milk. Mix that altogether and spoon it over the chicken cheese and vegetables  .    Then added the box of stove top savory herb stuffing over the entire top covered and baked

I replaced the Cream of Chicken with Cream of Celery, flattened out chicken tenderloins a little instead of breasts, added a few extra slices of Swiss, and added a little Garlic. My son & I both loved it. I will make this again!

I've made this recipe many times, I do pound out chicken breasts very thin, and seasoned them with salt pepper, garlic powder, added another can of cream of chicken, and another box of stuffing. Can never have enough of that! I also add veggies occasionally, this time only fresh mushrooms. My family loves this recipe! Thank you for sharing it!

Love this easy recipe, I added frozen green beans the 3rd time I made it. Added them right on top of chicken, before the cheese. Turned out fabulous, do that every time now to make it a complete meal all in one pan.

I give it 4 stars as is because I don't think Swiss cheese has the best flavor. I subbed cheddar for Swiss, chopped up the chicken, added green beans, and cooked it in the crock pot as another reviewer mentioned on low for 4 hours. It was then 5 stars. Thank you for this recipe!

I followed some tips from others, cut the chicken into one inch pieces, added a bag of frozen broccoli, used two cans of cream of chicken soup, and a full box of Stovetop stuffing.  Personally, I thought the stuffing was a little dry, but everyone else was raving about it.  The chicken and broccoli was amazing tasting, it would have been missing something without the broccoli.

Giving 4 stars as is because it is really all up to taste. Add more seasonings (lemon pepper, garlic, onion, etc.) to taste. Change up the soup if you don't like it. Change the cheese if it is all you have on hand. Great base recipe! Make it lighter or heavier if you choose (chicken stock or cream). Good start.

The cook time was WAY off. My chicken was still raw and needed an additional 20 minutes uncovered at 400 deg to be edible. We agreed that we both really would have liked some veggies in there too - peas, broccoli, mushrooms, SOMETHING. Probably not making this one again, sorry.

This recipe is the bomb! My husband and two sons, ages 7 & 4 absolutely loved it. My husband even said, "How in the world do you get chicken that plump & moist?"  Lol. My 2 year old son wouldn't even try it but I know he would've loved it too. I definitely recommend it & I followed the recipe exactly.

Great dish. Very flavorful and so simple my husband was able to prepare it from the recipe I left him. The only change I made was to use cream of chicken herb instead of plain. Leftovers were great the next day also.

This was so simple and easy to throw together. The only thing I did differently was that I used the whole box of stuffing (since it wasn't much more than 2 cups anyway), used a little less butter, and ended up cooking for about 60 mins. Fiancee loved it. I loved it.

This was a winner. Very simple & a big hit. The bread crumbs added a great crunch & the cheese added an extra creaminess.

Made it as written except added an extra can of soup. I don't think Ill add the second can next time and also next time make it a cream of chicken and herbs, but it was amazing. It made the house smell so good and the husband loved it. Even my 1 year old was gobbling up the soup/cheese/stuffing mixture. Im going to try it in the crock pot sometime too.

I made this for dinner last night and everyone loved it, including the kids!  I butterflied the chicken breasts and used 2 cans of soup and 1/2 cup milk.  I think next time I will serve it with some white rice and vegies and perhaps more stuffing.  Awesome recipe.

Made this for company and I was embarrassed.  I'm not sure why this got such great ratings.  It was very bland, the sauce didn't stick to the chicken and was very thin, and the chicken came out dry.  I would not make this again.

Had to add quite a bit to it and it was still bland to me; hubby and teenager loved it. Very easy and satisfying so I'll make again. I added: sliced onoin to bottom of pan, seasoned chicken with dry mustard, paprika, s&p, garlic, and added a container of savory garlic cream cheese sauce to soup mix. Will go even bolder on seasoning next time. Love to have these kind of base recipes in the rotation - thanks!

This was a fantastic dinner and so easy. I did read the previous reviews and comments and made the following additions....I seasoned each chicken breast with Mrs.Dash lemon herb blend. I used cream of chicken and herbs soup, I mixed 1/4 C white wine with the milk and soup and melted margarine, then I added the stove top stuffing for chicken to the soup mixture, and stirred it well. Finally I placed blobs of this mixture all around the chicken. Then I used a whole 10oz bag of  frozen baby broccoli florets and placed those all around the chicken breasts. It turned out great.

I made this for the first time while babysitting my 4 grandchildren, ages 8, and almost 5, 4 and 2. I used 3 chicken breasts and limited myself to a half of one because my grandchildren kept wanting more. The stuffing looks dry until you start to serve it .... When it mixes with the soup mixture it is amazing! I will definitely put this into my meal planning on a regular basis.

This is perhaps the best dish I've ever made! Nice and creamy, and it was cooked just right! Instead of pouring butter over the stuffing, I combine butter with crushed Ritz crackers and pour that over the stuffing. add broccoli to make it perfect!

I followed instructions exactly and it was very good.  As some pointed out the stuffing was a little crunchy and I actually liked that aspect.  Maybe that's what the originator intended.  The next day it was mush of course, but I liked that texture too.

I must've done something wrong...because I can't rave about this recipe like others.  
I'm giving it 3 stars because it did taste good.  The chicken was juicy, and the swiss cheese and the cream of chicken soup gave it a good flavor. But, the stuffing was dry and crunchy and had to be scrapped off to make the chicken edible. 
I will try making this again, but next time I'll put the stuffing on the bottom so hopefully it will soak up some of the soup and cook.

We really didn't care for this.  It tasted like it was made from packaged ingredients (canned soup and stuffing mix), rather than having the fresh taste that we enjoy.

This is a pretty good recipe.  I like it because you kind of get the taste of chicken cordon bleu except it's super easy to through together. A little salty though!

Added zucchini, water chestnuts, 2 tsp curry, dash of lemon juice. Saute 2 big pieces of breast, cubed chicken w/ onion & garlic. Cooked stuffing as directed & set aside. Used 1 can of cream of mushroom & 1 can of milk - could use a little less milk. Mixed soup & milk & then added sauted chicken w/ onions & garlic. then added veggies & shredded cheddar cheese. top w/ the stuffing - hard to make it smooth & even.
Baked for 30 minutes - kinda long -will reduce time. 
Flavor was good but not that spicy. Cooking time could have been a little less so chicken would not be as dry. The casserole came out kind of on the soggy side -but it's better than having it dry. Maybe use less milk next time.

My family loves this recipe! I use 2 cups of soup because we like extra creamy. With the dressing I add a little water and melt the butter and stir it with a fork just to make it a little softer before adding to the top. This has become a regular at our house. No need for salt - it is plenty salty with the soup. I have used both quick and easy Swiss slices and a good deli Swiss... They both taste good but the deli Swiss was a little better. So don't skimp on the Swiss! Yummmm!! :)

This was awesome!! The only reason I tried this was because I had some extra swiss cheese in the fridge which I normally don't use other than for ruben sandwitches & didn't want to toss it. I had 2 chicken breasts which next time I will cut up instead of leaving whole. Also used a whole can of cream of mushroom soup (what I had on hand) replaced milk with white wine, threw in some fresh broccoli & mushrooms with the chicken & didn't measure the stuffing mix just covered the casserole dish with enough. Was very yummy & we had no leftovers!!!!

awesome! my family makes fun of me when I cook... but with this recipe I NAILED it! They loved it and was asked to make it again :). Only change I made was swapping the crem of chicken soup for a can of chicken/mushroom. This was perfect! I can easily see myself making "spinoffs" of this!

EASY! Tastes pretty good, but the fact that this is so simple made it even better. I did add an extra step and cut the chicken into bite size pieces.

I absolutely love this recipe! I don't change a thing about it, with the exception of chopping the chicken into chunks. It's delicious either way, though. I haven't tried any of the alternatives yet, but I'm sure I will eventually. We have this meal at least once a week! Pair with a vegetable and you have the easiest meal ever!

Funny,I am making this recipe tonight for dinner.  I learned this from my mother years ago, but with slight variations.  I double the sauce, using cream of chicken and herb soup and 1/2 cup white wine.  You can't go wrong with chicken and wine :)  I also use crushed seasoned croutons for the topping.  It stills gives you that great crunch, but won't break a tooth like a dehydrated baked stuffing chunk.

I was pleasantly surprised by this dish.  I used condensed cream of chicken soup with herbs and seasoned the chicken breasts with salt, pepper and garlic powder.  I seasoned the mixture as well.  I had to cook mine about 10 minutes longer.  The crunchy stuffing on top was the best part.

This was very simple to make. My family loved it. I added a little bit of water to the cream of chicken to cut down on the salty taste of the cream of chicken. It also helped not make the casserole so dry. Will make this one again for sure.

I suppose it's fine for what it is - but like others - I expected more.  If you look at the ingredients - you can pretty much tell exactly what you will get.  There is no magic here. However - if you need an easy meal - this would qualify.

I pounded my chicken thin and it was still pink inside after the 50 min. bake time. The casserole was watery. I substituted whitw wine for the milk as other's suggested, it totally over powered the cheese and you couldn't taste the swiss. Never make again.

A wonderful, simple basic recipe.  I try to use the original recipe for my rating but did make two minor changes.  I used cream of mushroom with roasted garlic soup and drizzled with chicken broth i/o butter to reduce the calories.  A keeper!

We liked it a lot!  With only minor changes, since I used what we had.  I subbed shredded mozzarella for the Swiss, and combined milk and burgundy wine (looked gross, but oh so yummy!)  Finally I used a box of Stove Top cranberry stuffing, and combined with the 1/4 cup melted butter before putting it onto the chicken and soup/sauce.  Thank you!  Will definitely have again!!

This dish is everything we love. Swiss and chicken. I made mine for 10 servings cause i have a big family and it was a wonderful dish that everyone loved. The taste was amazing. It has a nice thick, but not too thick, sauce and the swiss melts nicely. And on the plus side it takes only minutes to throw together. I had to cook mine a little longer but it was well worth it. I was VERY pleased with this dish and will cook it more offter

I had been making a similar version for a few years, but this is a massive improvement!  My family loves it! The use of milk and the addition of the melted butter are what make this SO good.  Thank you!

I used 1 lb of chicken tenders that I had seasoned with garlic and fresh cracked pepper per other reviewers advice. I then mixed a can of mixed veggies with cream of mushroom soup and then added a splash of milk, sherry, and red wine. I then melted the butter and then mixed Stove Top stuffing in. I also added some water to the stuff because I did not want it to be dry. I baked this at 350 for 40 mins and then the last 10 mins I took the foil off and baked at 400. This was very good and comforting, which I was looking for. I did find it to be a bit rich with the soup and cheese, but it was still a great dish. I bet leftovers will taste even better. This was a really easy way to serve up a one dish meal. Thanks for sharing.

Very good as written. I mixed the (stove top) stuffing with 1/2 cup butter and the seasoning packet, may need to add a little bit of water next time. Also added some sliced water chestnuts with the chicken for the crunchiness. Used a 6oz bag of shredded swiss cheese instead of the slices.

Made this last night and it was very good. Use 2 slices of swiss cheese on each piece of chicken to really taste it.  The sauce with the bread crumbs kinda slid off the chicken/cheese part. Maybe sprinkle the bread crumbs on top of the cheese so that it sticks and then pour the soup mixture over top?? Very good recipe.

This recipe seemed to be a great hit with the family.  I personally did not partake, however my husband said to rate it at four stars.  As I too cubed the chicken breast.  I also substituted Sherry Cooking Wine for the Milk and used Condensed Cream of chicken & herb soup.    Will definitely make again.

Very nice, moist and tasty chicken. This is something I will make again for sure. I used white wine instead of milk.  Next time I think I'll increase the amount of swiss cheese as the flavour got a bit lost. This one's a keeper.

the topping was excellent, but the meat was kind of bland. i added salt, pepper, and garlic powder to the meat under the cheese, but still it was flavorless.  not a bad dish, but definitely not one of my favorites.

This was delicious. The second time I made it I added the some par boiled broccoli under everything. I also cut the chicken up and added some chicken stock to the stuffing before I sprinkled it on top. The Swiss cheese really makes it!

This was very good.  The only addition I made to the recipe was to add a little sherry which gave the stuffing an extra flavor.  I used stove top stuffing which already had the seasoning inside.  About 10 minutes before serving I did have stir the stuffing crumbs into the liquid as some of the crumbs were still dry sitting on the top.

We loved it!  It is so easy and so good!  I had to use three very large chicken breasts and cut them in half, so I put a half slice of cheese on them instead.  Had leftover (cooked) bacon in the fridge, so I crumbled that on top.

So good! I never use dried stuffing, but this really makes the dish terrific. I have made this twice this week! I also tried half swiss and half mozzerella cause that was all I had and it was still very good. Thanks!

I prepared this dish exactly as directed.  It is very easy to prepare.  My husband and I give it 4 stars.  The chicken is moist and has a good flavor.  However, there is some ingredient missing that keeps you from thinking about it the next day. This will definitely go into my recipe box after I experiment with other member suggestions (i.e. salt, garlic, brocolli, cream of mushroom soup, etc.)  I think everyone should try this recipe and be creative for desired results.

Seasoned chick with a little s&p and garlic but otherwise followed recipe exactly and it was really good comfort food for a cold night!

We liked it... probably won't make it again without alternation to give it more flavor. I am not a big fan of stuffing mix.

One of the better chicken casserole recipes out there.  HOWEVER, be sure to prepare your stuffing before putting it over the chicken.  Omitting this step will leave you with hard breadcrumb-like stuffing on top.  I also used extra cheese to make it even better.

Wonderful flavor and simple to make!  I followed a couple of different suggestions from other reviewers and used a semi-dry white wine instead of milk and chicken Stovetop mixed with melted butter.  We, as well as our dinner guests loved it!  I'll definately be making this more regularly.

Delicious!  We followed the recipe with our only change of cubing the chicken.  I lined the pan with foil and clean up was a breeze.  Next time I'll try it with broccoli florets or asparagus.  Also, mushrooms and onions could easily be added.  Any of these would be great!  Thanks Carolyn!

I thought that the chicken was very tender and moist. However; the kids did not care for the dressing at all. I am not sure if I did something wrong, but the dressing looked like a big cheese ball. Maybe next time Ill make the chicken seperate from the dressing and use stove top. I really hate to take the easy way out, but the kids are pickey, and are more likely to eat something if it comes out of a box....crazy "I know".

I made this according to the recipe and was shocked at how bland it was.  Not unpleasant or anything, just very "milky" tasting.  I saw another suggestion about using white wine instead of milk, which I think I'd try if I were to give this another chance, but I doubt it will come to that.

I used half milk and half wine and used bread crumbs. They just combined with the mixture so no crunchy top but the flavor of this dish was AMAZING! It tastes like so much more time was put into it than the couple of minutes it took to throw this together.

This is such an easy recipe and delicious as well. The only thing I can say is that it takes much longer than 50 minutes to cook. When I check the chicken after 50 minutes, it is still raw most of the way through. So I cook it for between 1 and 1/2 and 2 hours.

This is a pretty good recipe.  I followed AS IS, except I forgot to cover the pan before I baked it.  (don't recommend)  It still tasted good, but I'm pretty sure it'll be better if I do it the RIGHT way.  :) I will probably try the frozen broccoli advise as well.  My husband says it's a "cook again".

Was an absolute hit.  Great meal to make when you need something that is easy and quick to make.  Did exactly as written but only had chicken stuffing.  Husband and his friend loved it.

edited review:  have made this many times and still remains a favorite of husband and friend who I feed (girlfriend doesn't cook at all).  Have also used pepperjack and provolone and both have been hits.  Must try this.  Don't be fooled by ease and few ingredients, a weekly lunch staple for spouse.

A good weekend meal when you consider the longer cooking time.  Easy to prepare and good flavor.  I took other reviewers suggestions and substituted white wine for the milk and prepared the stuffing according to the recipe rather than drizzling the butter on top.

I liked this recipe, but I changed it a little bit.  I put the stuffing mix on the bottom of the pan and mixed it with some hot water to make it moist. Next I put my chicken which I cut into cubes over the stuffing mix.  Topped the chicken with swiss cheese, then poured the soup/milk mixture over the top of everything.  I sprinkled some more stuffing cubes on top and then some more swiss cheese. Baked in the oven & it turned out great!  I used cream of chicken soup with mushrooms and I left the butter out, didn't think it was needed.

This recipe was too rich and salty for our family, so I served it over rice and we liked it much better.  But then there is both stuffing and rice- too much starch for us.  I added an onion and twice as much butter which contributed to it being too rich.  Is it possible to drizzle 1/4 cup of butter over the stuffing mix and get it all moist?  I didn't know how.  Using fresh broccoli will increase the baking time to at least an hour and 25 minutes.  It was all right, but I won't be making this again.  Using canned soup, even Healthy Choice, adds too much sodium to our low sodium diet- not to mention the sodium in the stuffing mix.

Quick, easy and just what the family needed on a casserole night.  I made 2 small additions to this recipe by adding white wine to the soup/milk mixture and added broccoli around the chicken.

This was good, but the stuffing was a little hard for my taste.  Overall taste of the dish was good, though.

I made this reciepe this past week. I was rather disappointed. I did add the brocolli as others had sugested and I would have not liked it at all without it. Neither hubby or I was very impressed. I will say that the left overs tasted better the next day.

I tried this one last night. I did substitute cooking sherry for the milk and seasoned the chicken breasts with a little Tony Cachera's cajun seasoning. It came out great and was easy and fast. I'll add a few veggies to it next time. Thanks for sharing.

My husband and two teens loved this recipe.  I give it five stars for that reason -- they are a picky bunch!  The only small changes I made were shredded Monterey Jack cheese (instead of the Swiss), fat free half & half (instead of the milk) and I dotted margarine on top. I also used the crock pot!  Wil definitely make this again!!!

This is a simple and a very good chicken recipe. I made it according to directions and the stuffing was a little dry and crunchy. Next time I might press the stuffing down into the soup to coat the bread crumbs or pour some of the soup over the stuffing. I will just have to experiment. But overall I would give this 5 stars. I like how easy it was to prepare.

My family absolutely loved this receipe. It was so easy to make and delicious. I have a very picky family and they all said for me to make this again. I used cornbread stuffing since I didn't have the herb one but it tasted great anyways. This receipe will be a keeper in our family.

I followed the recipe as directed, except I chose to pan sear  the chicken and then place in the crock pot on high for 3 hours.  Supper easy!  I felt the flavors were a bit flat and wished the swiss cheese was more prominent.  Will try it again.

I absolutely loved this recipe because it is easy, healthy and so very tasty. I sprayed the dish with butter cooking spray. I didn't have herb seasoned stuffing so I used regular seasoned stuffing cubes and added thyme, garlic powder & salt and onion powder. I also used half & half instead of milk. I only had one very huge chicken breast so I cut it in half and it was even great to just eat the gravy with stuffing & cheese when the chicken was gone.  I think I might make it again this week with more chicken so we can have seconds.  Thanks so much for this recipe. If I could give it 10 stars I would **********.

I made this for my family tonight and everyone loved it. I used the whole box of stuffing and left it uncovered. It was wonderful! Can't wait to doctor it up next time with cheddar and broccoli. Rave reviews from the whole family and incredibly easy!

A nice dinner for an autumn night and I had everything on hand, except the Swiss cheese.  I blended swiss cheese with sharp, shredded cheddar and added tarragon and bacon bits before adding the soup.  I didn't drizzle butter on the stuffing, as I used Stove Top that I microwaved with water and butter, so I didn't want additional butter.  I also used the Healthy Request Campbell's Cr. of Chick. soup and no. 1 milk.  Evaporated milk would also work.  I served it with some cooked carrots and dill and it added color and was a nice accompaniment.  My son told me not to lose the recipe.  I won't.

Another variation of this: *instead of Swiss, use Meunster cheese   *instead of milk, use 1 mayonaise  *instead of stuffing, use bread crumbs (just to cover)  Really no need for butter. This makes a nice creamy sauce to put over noodles.

Excellent recipe!  I didn't have swiss cheese so I used American cheese and it tasted great.  Otherwise followed the recipe.  The only other difference is it had to be baked longer than the 50 minutes.  Will definitely put this one in my recipe book.

halved the recipe, but followed it exactly and it came out perfect.  i have another recipe that is similar to this, but i prefer this one.  very tasty.  the only thing i would change is adding 3/4 can of chicken soup (if halving the recipe) and 1.5 cups of dressing.  i like a little more soup/dressing mixture with my chicken. very good!  thanks!

Love it!  Super easy and very tasty!  I take the aluminum foil off for about 10-15 minutes to let some of the stuffing get crunchy.  It is even good as leftovers!

Excellent -- my spouse said it was "off the chain," meaning very good.  Like others, I used wine in place of milk  Also I seasoned the chicken with onion powder, garlic powder, black pepper and Beau Monde seasoning before cooking.  I'll do this one again.

This is really good. I used chicken cutlets as that was all I had. The chicken was very tender and the flavors of the swiss cheese, soup and croutons was tasty. I loved this recipe for its simplicity, flavor and importantly, that there is no need to add additional seasonings.

My boyfriend loved this. I only used 3 chicken breast but used the same amount of soup and milk. I did season the chicken with garlic and pepper first too. Leaving it unseasoned seemed weird. Also I didn't have bread crumbs but I did have slightly stale onion bagels that I made bread crumbs out of. It added a little something. As another reviewer stated I too used shredded swiss instead of slices. Good stuff!!!!

see note section. 5/09. homey and good.  i used cheddar not swiss, cream of celery because i didn't have chicken and it was fine, milk not wine as some suggested. didn't add brocolli frozen but should have.  and used garlic salt and lemon pepper too. alittle extra water over stuffing to keep moist. everyone liked it but said the recipe with the ritz crackers was better.

This was pretty good.  I was worried the stuffing wouldn't cook so I poured some chicken broth over the top.  Well that made it mushy so I'm better off just following the recipe next time instead of improvising.  Very simple, although mine did take a little over an hour to cook.  :-)

Very yummy.  I mixed the butter and stuffing together and added a little bit more water to moisten it up even more.  Chicken was cooked perfectly - so moist. I used Provolone instead of Swiss.  This is a great recipe to have on hand for an uncomplicated meal.

Very good and easy to make.  I checked it with about 20 minutes to go and it did not seem like the stuffing on top was getting soft, so I stirred it around a bit at that point - with that adjustment, it turned out perfectly.  Took it to a pot luck dinner and got a lot of compliments.

Although my family enjoyed this recipe, I was not as pleased.  I tried cooking it in the crock pot.  I put frozen chicken on the bottom of a sprayed crock pot and layered the recipe as directed.  I cooked it on Low for 8 hours and although the chicken was perfectly done, the stuffing was overdone.   Next time I would put in thawed chicken and cook it on low for 3-4 hours as someone else suggested, but working 9 hours a day at my job, that is hard to pull-off.

It was just okay for me. Hubby didn't really like it at all. The only problem we had with it was the chicken was too bland. It needs some kind of seasoning on it.

I made this for my family and it got rave reviews. Swiss cheese isn't my favorite so I think if I make it again I'll try mozzarella instead. The chicken comes out very moist and tender.

I found this to be mediocre... Perhaps if the chicken at the bottom had been marinated or cut thinner, but as it was, it was rather flavorless.  It was also impossible to test the readiness if the cutlets without making a big,ugly mess of the casserole and disturbing everything piled on top of them. My family was not impressed.

This recipe was great.  I found it pretty quick to put together before throwing it in the oven.  The cook time is well worth the wait for a great dish with lots of flavor!  Make some veggies and you have your meal!!  I can't wait to have the leftovers!!!!

this is a keeper - like some of the other reviewers, I have changed a few things - I used a little more milk in the soup to have it a thinner sauce - I used corn bread stuffing mix and moistened it with some hot water and wine along with the butter (I like moist dressing) also seasoned the breasts with a little pepper and some rosemary before topping with cheese - it's a yummy recipe that I'll be sure to use again !

I made a couple of changes to this recipe to use ingredients I had on hand.  I used pepper jack cheese instead of swiss and cream of chicken & mushroom soup instead of plain cream of chicken.  This turned out awesome and was just as good as leftover a couple of days later.  This will become a regular in my house!

This was very good.  The only change I made was that I doubled the soup/milk mixture because my children love gravy/sauces and I was afraid it would be a bit dry otherwise.  It was the right thing to do because there wasn't too much.  Everyone enjoyed it and my husband and one son who is 12 had seconds.  Even my youngest son said it was a "do again"!

I did not care for this receipe as written.  I'm not sure what people are doing so the stuffing isn't crunchy.

This was very good and simple.  All the ingredients were on hand, which is rare for me.  Only didn't give it a 5 because it wasn't surprisingly fantastic...but very good nonetheless.  We'll have this again.

This was really easy to make and very good too!  Used half the chicken, because there are only two of us, and kept the other ingredients the same.  I wish I would used the right amount of chicken because both of us wanted more!  Next time I think I might top chicken with a slice of thinly sliced ham before the swiss cheese.

This was super easy! I followed one reviewer & put it all in the crockpot! I layered the chicken, then the slices of swiss cheese & then the soup/milk mixture & then mixed the butter with the stuffing & poured that ontop. Delicious recipe!

Tasty, ez to make, stuffing placed on top gave it a nice twist.I may double swiss cheese next time, as we really didn't taste the one slice.

I thought this was really easy and delicious.  I did use mushroom soup because I had it and added fresh sliced mushrooms too. I also used half a cup of white wine instead of milk, gave it a little less soup taste.  Used half heart healthy margarine, half butter.  I will certainly make this again.  PS The leftovers for another night were great too!

This was a big hit with the hubby. The only changes I did was substituted milk with chicken broth. I added frozen peas and fresh mushrooms. With a salad was a great meal. It's a keeper.

My husband loved this dish. Definitely a man's kind of casserole. I found it too salty. Added wine in addition to milk and made the stuffing a bit softer with butter and milk. Used chicken and musroom soup

This recipe was easy and it's taste was AWESOME!!! Just make sure your chicken is done, some pieces needed to cook a little longer than the 50 minutes.

Wow was it ever good.  I used cream of celery soup, with cream.  I added broccoli too. I didn't have stove top so used bread crumbs, I salted and peppered the chicken before cheese and then the sauce.  I did top the bread crumbs with beacon bits.  I didn't use butter, just forgot too. I made some Orzo to go with it.  It was really good.  I made this first time in the crock pot,...something about me and crock pots.  I think I just cook them too long and when they get done cooking it goes to warm and it just over does it, it tasted bad.  Some people love the pot not me, I have better results with the stone ware to slow cook, just have to do it in the oven.    Marylin

This is one of the easiest recipes.  I forgot the swiss cheese so put on top of the stuffing and it stilled turned out great.  Very easy for all beginner cooks. It is fast to prep and was a crowd pleaser.

Cooked this in the crockpot.  Be sure to check it in 4 hours.  Used spray olive oil and then drizzled olive oil over the top.  Cut the breasts into half.  Really good!

Made this last night for dinner.  I used a can of cream of celery soup and added cut up pieces of broccoli to the cream sauce. I took the advice of some reviewers and put it under the broiler when it was finished cooking. At some point I will try the sauce on a bed of cauliflower or zucchini instead of chicken and use it as a side dish. Hubby said this recipe was "a keeper".

This was just average.  It needed a little kick.  Also, the stuffing mix was still very crunchy after cooking. Maybe next time I'll try provolone cheese (couldn't really taste the swiss), season the chicken a little more and add more sauce.

Made this last night for company and it tasted pretty darn good.  I used one can cream of chicken and one can of mushroom soup and added both wine and milk.  Next time I think I will try adding a gravy mix as there was not much gravy for the potatoes.

I cooked it for an hour and the chicken still was not done.  I saw that someone used her crock pot.  I may try that, if I do this recipe again.  It sounds so good, but I can't wait over an hour to have my supper ready!

After reading lots of reviews I made this dish.  As most reviewers have said, it was very easy and tasty.  The one dish meal, toss and bake is great!  Without being asked my husband said, this is a keeper.  Like many others I made minor changes to suit what I had on hand. Two large breasts, Stove Top dressing, Cream of Mushroom soup and Colby/Jack cheese; next time I'll try Swiss.  The two of us ate almost all of it.  Note: It was on the salty side so next time I'll opt for low sodium products.

Wonderful, easy recipe.  I did use 2 cans of soup and moistened the stuffing a little.  Other than that, changed nothing.  My boyfriend took one bite and said,  this is really good.  I am sure I will make again.

Very simple and easy to make.  The only changes I made to it were to add broccoli and I also added rice and I used shredded mozzarella cheese instead of swiss.  With the rice, I used 3 cups water with equal instant rice.  I added a couple of chicken boullion cubes to the water to add flavor.  I mixed the rice with the soup/milk/broccoli mix before spooning it onto the chicken.  The added rice really pumps up the volume of the dish.  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe was given to me a few years ago and called Goumet Chicken Breasts.  The only change is that mine uses white wine instead of the milk. Delicious recipe and VERY easy to make.

I cut the chicken into 1 inch cubes and add ham cut in the same fashion. Serve it over cooked white rice and the kids scream for more!

I also make this recipe alot it's one of my kids favorites.  I usually make extra because the kids always wants leftovers.  I pepper the chicken before adding the cheese. To save time I usually pound out the chicken so the breast is thinner and cooks more quickly. I use cream of chicken with herbs gives it a very nice flavor.

This was very good and the chicken was so moist.  I sub cooking sherry for the milk, I would use a low sodium soup, and the biggest complaint was the breast were to big, so I would butterfly the breast add cheese and spinach and ty or put toothpicks to hold together.  When I serve the chicken I would slice each breast.  The stuffing I would cook seperate and add to the dish perhaps in the last 10 mins to brown.

Good, needed more than 50 minutes to cook though....more like 1 hr. 20 minutes.  I used a glass dish though which may be why it took longer.

I thought this was good, but next time I will add more seasoning to the stuffing...and not just rely on the stuffing packet in the bag. I doubled the recipe for a crowd and my brother-in-law asked me if he could take some home. A little baby was joining us for dinner and she ate 2 peices of chicken!

I am always looking for new things to cook for my family... Well my family and I just loved this one.. It was so tasty.  I did over cook the chicken just a little bit, so a little on the dry side. However I won't cook it so long next time.. We just all thought it was great.

It was good but not great.  It seemed like it was missing something.  It does have a similar flavor to chicken cordon blu.

This is a simple and delicious recipe.  If you'd like to make it a bit healthier try leaving out the cheese all together.  You won't even miss it.

Fantastic!  I am a novice cook who is learning every day and not only was this recipe very simple and fun to make, but it was delicious.  It also makes a good template to try different substitutions and variations.  Highly recommended.

We have this quite often at our house due to basic pantry items required and the ease of preparation.  It doesn't hurt that it tastes fabulous!  I usually prepare this in the crock pot and cook on low for 5 hours.  Cornbread stuffing can also be used instead of herbed dressing for a little variety.

My mom used to make this chicken when I was a kid, so when I saw this recipe I had to try it.  It was just as good as I remembered, even though I forgot to cover the chicken (oops).  This was super easy, so that was a plus, too.  Nostalgia always makes food taste better!

This is very good but it is missing something.  Maybe more garlic or something along that line.  Make as directed then adjust next time for personal taste.  I will add more stuffing, add garlic and perhaps mushrooms.

Perfect comfort food.  The whole family loved it!!  Even my picky daughter was the first to clean her plate!  I did add a can of cream of mushroom and some poultry seasoning to the soup mixture. ( Both the cream soups were healthy reguest soups.)  I wanted extra gravey for my homemade mashed potatoes.  Definetly will make again and again.

This recipe was delicious!  I have to agree though with the other reviews, that it was a bit too salty, but with low sodium soup, I know it would be 5 stars.

This was really good! I stirred the stuffing with some of the soup 10mins before it was done so the stuffing wouldn't be completely dry and crispy and it was great. Everyone loved it!

Good recipe.  I added cream of mushroom soup, green beans, and peas.  I also browned the chicken and cut it into cubes.  Halfway through I mixed the casserole otherwise the stuffing would have been very dry.

I prepared the recipe as-is and it turned out a bit blah and the sauce was runny.  I'd try this again, but doctor it up the way some other reviewers suggest to see if I can get a more flavorful version.

This is a really good recipe. I have made it several times. I find the chicken is a little bland if you don't salt and pepper it before adding cheese. I also like to use cream of mushroom soup and add broccoli. It is awesome with the broccoli.

This was delicious. I did cook it in the crockpot and the aroma made our house smell so good. We couldn't wait to eat it. My 6 year old is very picky and he loved it!!!! Next time I may try using sour cream in the soup mixture. I had before in a simiular recipe, and it just richened the flavor. This was very yummy!

My husband and I love this casserole. We boil the chicken first and cut into small pieces. We also use the Cream of Chicken and Mushroom soup. It is wonderful!

This was wonderful. I took one of the suggestions and cooked in slow cooker for 5 hours on high. I also used an entire box of stuffing mix, with 8 frozen breasts. What a great way to use leftover turkey come the holidays! I just had to open an can of cranberry sause with this. It is a definate keeper!

This was soooo goood!  The chicken breasts were so tender we could cut them with a fork!  I added a few broccoli floretts and it made it taste even better.  I bumped the butter up a bit maybe to 1/2 a cup.  I made this diner ahead of time and it still came out wonderful!

Good, but a little dry and salty.  Although I forgot to cover it while it cooked, so that may be why.

Excellent!Loved it. I melted more butter over stuffing then it called for to be sure it wasn't dry after baking. I also forgot to put cheese on chicken before I put on the stuffing so layed it over the stuffing and it was great!

My family really liked this dish....I cut up mu chicken in cubes and added 1/2 bag of frozen mixed veggies for a more complete meal. Shredded my swiss cheese and used reduced fat cream of mushroom (didnt have the cream o'chicken). Very cheesy and creamy. Will make again. Served with a salad and bread sticks.

Yummy!  Creamy, warm and satisfying...I followed others' suggestion and added a couple of cups of frozen broccoli between the cheese and soup layers.  Dee-li-cious!  I also added a few tablespoons of pimento and a teaspoon of capers that I happened to have in the fridge.  Elegant comfort food, and very simple to make.

I didn't have any cream of chicken on hand so I just used cream of mushroom soup and also used turkey flavored herb stuffing mix. It turned out delicious! My hubby was really impressed! I was really impressed with the simplicity of it and how delicious it was! I will definitely be making this again!

I gave this 4 stars because it was simple and had a small amount of ingredients...I put it together with things I already had in the pantry. The dish tasted good, but needed just something extra...not sure what it is.  Someone mentioned adding broccoli, which would probably do it. We had broccoli on the side. I would make this again.

this is one of our favorite recipes. Guests love it too!  We have to be health concious, so I use low fat soup with low salt, 2% or skim milk, reduced fat cheese, margarine. Someone commented about it being too salty...I think with the adjustment of one or more of these ingredients, the salt will disappear. Canned soups have a very high salt content. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!! YUM!!

This was a great dish especially for the amount of prep time. Next time, I will use a lot more broccoli and more stuffing on my husband's side of the dish.

My family and I absolutely loved this...the only thing I changed since I didn't have stuffing or dried bread crumbs, was I substituted that with dry onion soup mix. I don't think after how amazing it was that I would ever make it any other way! My 3 & 5 year old girls went crazy over this and they are not huge chicken fans. There definitely were not any left overs and my husband even made toast to put the left over cheesy sauce over. To sum up....our new favorite!

This is pretty yummy and very, very easy to make.  You can reduce the number of chicken breasts (I only used four) without any problems. I do suggest spicing up the recipe as it is a little bland. I added more Swiss cheese and some leftover chopped onions that I needed to get rid of and it tasted great. I will probably add even more onions next time. If you're having a busy night and don't have time for something elaborate, this is a great recipe.

I absolutely love this recipe, and my husband cleaned his plate in under 10 minutes. I used only two chicken breast and kept the rest the same, and it was the perfect amount. I think if I were to make this for more people, I'd add more soup and bread crumbs. Great with green beans.

This was very easy and delicious. I cooked it in the crock pot and it turned out perfect! The chicken breasts were tender and the stuffing was crunchy on top.  The Swiss cheese gave it a nice flavor.

I may have had chicken breasts that were too big, but I followed the recipe and got terrible results.  There was way too much chicken and not enough brocolli.  SO I mixed everything up, added another round of soup and milk, a little bit of cheese on top of that, plus more stuffing and it tasted great.

Easy, Tasty, and GONE. I followed the instructions, minus I didn't have any Swiss on hand, so I used Baby Bell cheese. It turned out great. Hubby LOVED it, and I had to cut myself off at 3 helpings. VERY GOOD and something I will make at least once a month.

I used a few extra slices of Swiss cheese, seasoned the chicken and added white wine to the soup mix.  It was a big hit with everyone from an 18 month old on up.

This is pretty good, however I made some changed. I cooked some chopped onion in about 2 tbsp of butter and then mixed the dry stuffing mix in with that. Also instead of adding milk to the Cream of Chicken soup, I added a cup of white wine. The family loved it!

if you want a delicious chicken dinner in a hurry after coming home from work, this is it. i followed the recipe to the letter; the simplest meal ever, rich, yummy stuffing and cheese-okay, not exactly low cal-your family will most likely love it the way mine did.

This is the first Chicken Casserole I've made. This was great!  I liked it because it was easy and I was able to throw it together after a long day's work.  Now I have leftovers for a couple days!  I used more Swiss Cheese on the chicken because I love cheese and it was great.  I also used the Broccoli as recommended in a review, but I would add it before you pour the sauce of the cheese and chicken.  Easy Peasy!

This is absolutely delicious!! Hubby couldn't get enough! If I was to change anything...I would use reduced sodium cream of chicken soup, because it is a little on the salty side, but other than that the family loved it! I will make this often!

I did this with 1 can mushroom soup, 1/2 can of skim milk,2 cups chicken diced/cooked with garlic powder to taste), about 3/4c frozen broccoli, 1/2c low fat colby/jack cheese mix (grated), about 1/4c instant rice mixed in, and garlic salt/pepper to taste. After I baked it for about 40 min I took it out and sprinkled a little cheese on top and popped it back in for a minute or two to melt the cheese. It turned out perfect!!

Family really liked this. Seasoned chicken breasts, topped with slice of Swiss cheese then herb stove top and butter. Covered and cooked at 375 until chicken was done. Mine took a bit longer than called for. Great flavor.

This was awesome.  It was a little dry, but that was probably because I used pre cooked cut up chicken.  Regardless, it was great and I will use this often.  I did use 98% fat free condensed soup as well as skim milk, and it was still creamy and yummy!

Pretty good. A little salty. I cooked for two and only used 2 chicken breasts but kept all of the other ingredients the same. I also put some frozen broc. with it. The 50 minutes cook time was pretty accurate. This meal was good other than being a little too salty...

This was good.  But the stuffing didn't fluff up like I expectied it to...I had to push the stuffing down a little bit the last 10 minutes for it to be soft instead of crunchy. The chicken was tender and the flavor of the dish was pretty good though.  My family liked it.

This was a hit at my house.  It was very simple, but in my opinion, lacked something.  Perhaps next time I will try the suggestions of other users in making additions to this dish.

My family loved this meal!  I used reduced fat cream of mushroom soup and reduced fat Swiss cheese.  I only baked two breasts but didn't change the amount of soup, milk, or stuffing.  The extra soup mixture made the stuffing moist and made a great side dish!  Will try again with sliced mushrooms added in!

This was a great, quick recipe. I served it with fresh steamed green beans. I used low sodium, low fat soup and didn't find it salty at all (as others had mentioned). The flavors were amazing! Will be making this again. :)

This was great!  I took it to a ladies potluck dinner and everyone asked for the recipe.  It is doubly great because I live in South Korea and was able to find all the ingredients here in Seoul.  My swiss cheese selection wasn't the best in the world but it worked.

I made this last night and it was very very good.  I used two cans of lower fat cream of chicken soup, no extra liquid, and it was divine.  I put it in the oven to cook for an hour covered in foil and ran an errand.  Perfect for a rushed evening meal after work, but filling enough for hubby.  Will definately make again!

I had hubby get the chicken for me.  Which be brought back, chicken breasts with skin and bones.  So I boiled the breasts with a little of salt.  Tore the chicken into bits of pieces.  I doubled the recipe.  I used mushroom soup and chicken soup (condensed), and hubby liked it.  This recipe is going into my recipe book.

Excellent, easy dish.  I did as some others did, I used cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken.  I also added in a can of sliced mushrooms.  It turned out great.  My husband, who doesn't usually like any type of creamy dish, thought is was delicious.  Very nummy!!

Of course this recipe is good.  It's right out of the Mr. Food "Ohhh It's So Good" cookbook! The only missing ingredient is the mushrooms.  It's the best quickest chicken dish I have ever made...one of my favorites.

I changed some minor things - I used 3 large chicken breasts cut in half, I seasoned each breast (both sides) with salt, pepper, garlic powder and paprika and finally I used shredded swiss instead of slices, sprinkling some on top of the whole casserole as well as the chicken breasts. It was easy and quick and my husband and our dinner guest loved it. I will make it again, but double the recipe if I use more chicken.

My husband loves this recipe!  We use a cornbread stuffing mix, and it is really good.  We also increase the cheese (becasue we love it so much) and it's great!

I really enjoyed this.  Not sure if you need the cheese on it or not.  The soup makes kind of a gravy so it would be very good with mashed potatoes.

This recipe is very very salty due to the soup so I suggest using a low sodium soup.  It definitely needs additional spices so I used pepper, garlic powder and poultry seasoning.

This recipe was very easy.  I added my own flavor to it with a little garlic powder, paprika,dried minced onions, and 1/4 cup mayo to the soup.  I just had some garlic and cheese croutons for the topping, and it worked out very well.  I also mixed in a can of green beans.I will probably make it again.

This was great and so easy! I will definitely make it again. I followed the recipe exactly but next time I will add black pepper, garlic powder and some other seasonings to the soup mix. I will also try the white wine as other's have suggested.

Couldn't believe how easy this was and I had just about everything on hand or something close to it at least.  I only had cream of mushroom in the pantry so used that instead of the cream of chicken and I used the chicken flavored Stove Top stuffing mix I just happened to have.  I didn't have foil on hand so I layered the chicken in a more narrow casserole dish with a lid.  The chicken turned out very flavorful and moist.  Will definatly make this again, even my picky eater 8yr old loved it.

I wasn't crazy about this dish but it was quick and easy. The taste was on the " blah" side though. I didn't change anything other than using crushed corn flakes instead of the stuffing mix.

This was a great basic dish that can be modified in many ways!  I took the advice of other reviewers and used white wine, which gave it great flavor.  However, I found it a tad bit salty for my taste even though I used low sodium cream of chicken.  I'm sure that I can use low sodium swiss cheese and that would rectify the problem.  Overall this was a quick and tasty meal that will go with an array of side dishes!  Will definitely make again with a few alterations!

I have been trying serveral chicken casseroles. This was OK. I added wine instead of milk, pepper on the layer of swiss cheese. I also used cream of chicken with garlic soup. I used a whole box of stuffing, but still there could have been more.Stuffing was a bit watery. I was a bit disappointed with the cheese. I expected more because I added 4 more slices. My husband said it was not as good as my regular recipe (his mother's), but it was better than the last tried. Do not think I will make this again, unless pressed for time. I served with cheddar garlic biscuits and wine. I will say, in a bind it is quick and easy to prepare.

This was pretty good.  I used 3 chicken breasts cut into strips and found I needed to bake it for about 70 minutes or so.  I added a little sherry to the soup mixture (just because I like the flavor) and used cream of chicken & mushroom soup.  A very simple recipe that I'll use again!

My 13 year old daughter made this for us for dinner one night this week.  It was great!  We didn't have stuffing on hand, so she made her own bread crumbs and added Good Season's Herb dressing mix.  Excellent flavor!

This was very good, and so easy to make.  I used a pan far too big and the sauce ran all over.  I mixed the butter and crumbs together before adding to the chicken, it was wonderful!

This recipe was pretty good.  Nice and easy.  I used the cream of chicken soup and added canned mushrooms and chopped green onion on top of the chicken to give it a little extra flavor.

Wonderful flavor!  I only used 4 chicken breasts, and I used 8 slices of cheese and a 6 oz box of Stovetop Stuffing.  The only problem is I must have done something wrong, because the chicken was a little chewy and tough.  I will try again because it really tasted good!

This recipe was awesome. REALLY easy. I doubled the swiss cheese, but other than that followed the recipe exactly. The chicken was really moist, and the sauce/stuffing mixture was delicious. I served it with wild rice, steamed veggies, and white rolls. Would definitely reccomend!!

My family loved this, but I revised the recipe a bit-I pregrilled the chicken, shredded it, added broccoli, used 2 cans cream of chicken + 1 small can of evaporated milk, doubled the swiss cheese and made the stuffing as directed before sprinkling on top. Baked for 30 minutes at 350. Really good!

I was most surprised that my kids ate this, but that is it's biggest selling point for me.  I thought it was pretty good, but maybe not something I'd crave.

this recipe is a real winner: substitute milk with white wine, use 1 chicken breast cooked and shreaded, add a carrot chopped, 1c broccoli florets, 1c cooked pasta and monterey jack instead of swiss, subtract the butter...throw it all together (pasta on top...pour soup on top of everything last) into a pie dish and heat as directed...yummers!

Most of my family really enjoyed this recipe. But make sure that you only make enough for one meal. Leftovers were not very good at all. Thanks for the delicious recipe Carolyn.

This is a fabulous recipe. My family really enjoyed it. It was like a short cut to Thankgiving dinner.
