Very good.  I made the recipe twice - once with chopped zucchini & apple, the second with grated zucchini & apple.  I liked it better the second time.

This recipe is an instant favorite--I substituted applesauce for the oil, and used only 3/4 C of each sugar, and it was fabulous. Thanks!

I Love zucchini bread, I had made one last week from a different recipe and it was ok.  I had extra zucchini on hand so I made this one.  I did alter the ingredients a little by using whole wheat flour, applesauce instead of oil, and 1 egg and 2 whites instead of 2 eggs,  I just wanted to see if it would come out ok with a little less fat.  thank you for the base recipe, YUM

Adding the apples, makes it different from other zucchini breads. This bread is not as sweet, but pleasantly suprising. I took some to work and everyone loved it.

A very nice bread but it was very chunky. I grated the apple and zucchini the second batch and it was much better.  Also I found it dry when I mixed in the zucchini and apple so I added a 5th egg which did the trick.  Maybe my eggs were just on the small side but no matter.  I'm sure it will be a big hit at my pumpkin carve tomorrow.  I do love how the apple and zucchini merry together.  Lovely recipe.

grated the zucchini, and left the skin on the apple for added fiber and color.  Grated one cup of the apple for more even distribution, and fine chopped the second cup.  Had to up the cinnamon by 1/2 tsp and could have used more but out of personal preference.  Replaced all the oil with applesauce.  1 hr. in the oven was perfect.  It was just a tiny bit on the dry side, but could be because both my zucchini and jonathan apple didn't have alot of water content.

This was a wonderful recipe for the fall to use up the last of the zucchini and apples. My family and friends loved it. I will use it in place of the old Zucchini bread recipe.

For those reporting they found this bread not very moist, it could easily be because there's a lot less oil in this recipe than there is in most recipes of this type.  After a gagillion years of baking experience I stuck with what I was comfortable with and doubled (yes, DOUBLED) the amount of oil.  As I expected, I was quite content with the outcome.  As for the zucchini, I shredded it - I know I wouldn't have cared for biting into pieces of zucchini in a sweet muffin.   I omitted the  walnuts so everyone would be happy, but I believe these would be equally delicious with or without them.  Half the recipe was just right for 12 gorgeous, perfectly risen and rounded muffins which I topped with demerara (aka turbinado) sugar before baking.   (If you choose to make this recipe as muffins, bake them at 350 degrees 20-25 minutes)  These are moist and just sweet enough, the apple lending a lot of extra flavor using zucchini alone wouldn't.  While I ended up loving these, for me having to double the oil to ensure a moist muffin, particularly since this is a deviation from other, similar tried and true recipes,  made this a 4, rather than 5-star recipe for me.

I cut this recipe in half and made muffins from the batter instead of one big loaf. I kept the vanilla extract at a teaspoon. I made no other changes. I baked the muffins at 350* for 22 minutes. This recipe turned out a very moist muffin that was slightly chewy and very flavorful. I'd make this again. I'd like to try this with half whole wheat flour and a half cup or so of organic raisins thrown in.

I liked the level of sweetness, sweet but not overly sweet. However, I didn't think it was "light and fluffy" like the description claimed. I do think I overmixed it a bit which added to some of the denseness, but that aside, it just wasn't that flavorful.

Absolutely love this bread. It is so moist and full of flavor.  I used applesauce instead of the butter and was out of walnuts, so I used pecans in the bread instead.  Will make over and over, especially in the upcoming fall months.  Thank you!

Great recipe. I cut the recipe in half for one bread. I grated the zucchini and chopped the apple.  It's a very dense bread that has a nice sweetness to it. I left out the walnuts for my husband, but next time I'll leave them in and add some more chopped apple and maybe add some raisins.

It's ok. I actually didn't do apple, but used apple sauce instead of oil and 1 2/3 c of 100% whole cane sugar (rapudura) instead of the two sugars.

This was delicious! I did as someone suggested & grated the apple & zucchini but otherwise followed the recipe exactly - this was FABULOUS!! We work cross-culturally & can't get alot of things t make different kinds of recipes but many people make various kinds of bread - my daughter said this is the best kind of bread she has EVER had!

This has got to be one of the best zucchini breads I've ever had. It's texture is very nice and light, not like alot of other loaves that are very dense. I didn't feel the need to peel the zucchini and I grated it instead of chopping, but I did peele and dice the apple. I also added and extra cup of apple into the mix. Didn't have any walnuts on hand but I think it defintly would have improved the recipe even more!! Going to be my go to recipe from now on!!

I loved this bread.  Not only did it taste wonderful, but it baked up just like the picture showed!  When I made it the second time, I did add one more egg (because the batter is quite stiff) and used grated zucchini, as was suggested by other reviewers.  I liked the apples chunkier, but I did cut them into very small pieces rather than grating them.  This recipe has been added to my permanent collection for sure!

I made 4 mini loaves and 6 large muffins, I've already gone through the muffins, they turned out great.  The only change I made was to decrease the white sugar to 2/3 c., that's all I had.  I like the less sweet flavor and the texture is great. Baked the muffins for 20 minutes and the mini loaves for 35 minutes.

I used whole wheat flour instead of white flour, and I grated the zucchini and apple instead of chopping them. I also added a little ground flax seed. I was surprised by the fact that the bread didn't rise at all. It stayed flat, dark, and almost too moist. Still good, but not anything that looks like the photo.

I was looking for a recipe to use up the apples we collected apple picking and this one is a winner!  The bread turned out great!  I kept one loaf and served the other at church and it got rave reviews.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and grated the zucchini and apple and added an extra 1/2 teaspon of cinnamon.  Yummy!

These were a hit at home and at work. I shredded the zucchini and diced the apples - used Transparent apples fresh from the tree and zucchini from the garden.  Another make again recipe.

It was not as sweet as I thought it would be, but not bad. I substituted banana for apple as one reviewer suggested, but next time I will use the grated apple.

This was good bread. I shredded the zucchini and apples. I thought it tasted better the next day but my son just loved it!

This recipe was easy & turned out good.  Be careful  not to overcook or it is too dry.  Its very good paired with fruit such as blueberries & blackberries for a light & healthy meal.

Absolutely fabulous!! The only thing I changed was shredding instead of chopping the zucchini and apple because I like the consistency better that way. I also added chopped walnuts to the top because I like the crunch.

This was a big disappointment. I made this a week or so after making Blueberry Zucchini bread which was the best, most moist z bread I've ever made, so my expectations were high. But this bread came out dry and a little bland. I don't think I did anything wrong following the directions, but it cooked in half the time and as I said it was dry. I believe the flour to oil ratio is way off. I won't bother trying to fix it though because next time I'll just use the Blueberry recipe and substitute apples for the berries.

I used a mixture of rice flour and garbanzo bean flour instead of the wheat flour (husband is allergic to wheat), didn't drain my zucchini, was delicious.

Great flavor - I headed the recommendations of others and grated both the apple and zuch, and added 1 more egg. Cooked perfectly. I used Organic Oat flour instead of all purpose - didn't seem to affect the texture - I'll definately add this to my favorites!

This was just okay.  A little too dense for me, and it dried out within a day.  I will stick with the Cranberry Zucchini Bread on this site.

I made this without the walnuts, and I substituted apple sauce for the oil.  I also added a little bit of nutmeg.  It turned out perfectly, really moist and sweet and wonderfully spiced.

Bread is light and fluffy - not too sweet. I added an extra 1/2 cup of apples per some of the comments of the other reviewers. Also omitted the walnuts based on personal preference. Converts to gluten free really well, too (just minus a few tablespoons of flour if using rice flour). Very yummy - will make again, soon!

Great bread! I made a few healthy swaps. I used 1 1/3 cup flour and 1 cup each of whole wheat and whole wheat pasty flowers. Cut the apples into very small chunks. Also used apple sauce in place of oil as I do in all my baking recipes. Alos used all egg whites.

I just got finished putting this together and was a bit confused. I substituted 2 cups of the flour for whole wheat flour and when I went to mix it into the egg mixture it was so thick there was no way I could "pour" it into the loaf pans. I added more oil, another egg, and some milk before it was even close to the consistency I have seen in other recipes. Did I do something wrong? Seems like its a bit shy on the liquid ingredients to me.   Anyway, I just stuck it in the oven and can't wait to try it out.

This is an excellent, fast recipe for one of those situations where you're expected to bring in a baked cook for the next day and only have a weekday night with limited time.  I cut the recipe in half and shredded 1 medium zucchini and 1 medium apple. I substituted two teaspoons of baking powder for baking soda. I also used whole wheat pastry flour rather than regular flour. The bread came out quite well. I will definitely make this again.

I used 2 ripe & mashed bananas instead of apples and it was just delicious. I gave it to a couple of fishermen friends who grilled it up on the high seas. They didn't catch any tuna but loved the bread.

I really like adding the apples to the bread. I did find that grating the zucchini and fine chopping the apples worked better. I found the bread a little dry, but otherwise very nice.

This is an excellent recipe. I did use Applesauce instead of oil and I finely grated the Zucchini and apple which gave it a nice texture. 

It was a bit heavy, certainly not light, but it didn't affect the amazing flavor, I made this a few days ago and am currently cooking another batch.

I grated both the zucchini and the apple  and omitted the nuts, as I had none on hand.  Very nice bread!  The baking time was too long for me do next time I will check it at 50 minutes.  Maybe a bit bland compared to others but I like this one very much.

My family loves the way I make this bread. I like to grate the zucchini and apple. I also use 3/4 of applesauce and decrease the baking soda to 1 tsp. Added 1 tsp of baking powder, 1 tsp salt, and about half a cup of white chocolate chips.

This is a lovely zucchini bread.  The addition of chopped apples is a nice change.  The texture was perfect, and it was not too sweet.  For my personal preference, I would add a little more chopped apples the next time I make this.

This was SO SO delicious!  I can't get enough of it!  I used applesauce instead of oil (almost 2x the applesauce for oil to keep it moist), threw in an extra egg, and use a little bit more grated apple and zucchini than called for.  It came out absolutely fantastic.

Not sure what went wrong, but this bread came out heavy and very dry.  I wasted a lot of ingredients making it too.  Now I’m in search of a much better recipe.

I think next time I will increase the salt and sweetness just a bit.I did not put a sugar topping over it, so that may be the issue with the sweetness. 
  Other than that the bread was very good.I brought it to my sitting group and everyone gave me wonderful complements, so Im happynthat they all enjoyed it so much.

The only thing is that it swells a lot. Not a problem! It just needs an extra (a little smaller) pan!!!

Very good. I am lazy and just dump everything together in one large bowl!  Also, I did not peel anything, and used 1.5 cups zucchini and 1.5 apple.

Easy recipe to make.  You can always put more apples in it and less zucchini if you want.  Always seems to be variations of this recipe.

I followed the recipe except reduced white sugar to 3/4 c.  It was a little dry for my taste.  If I make this again I will add another apple or zucchini or perhaps applesauce.  Good with cream cheese.

This was an easy recipe but way to dry and bland for my taste preferences the first time. The first batch, I cut the flour back by 1/2 cup, sugar back by 1/2 cup, and added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and used zucchini I had squeezed the liquid out of. Still thick and bland. Next time I make it I will add 1 cup of applesauce or make sure you use fresh, drained but not squeezed, zucchini, and add more spice. I would also check on the bread after 30 minutes. 40 minutes was too long. This thick batter cooks quickly. 1 hour and I would've had dog treats.

I got 2 loaves out of the quantities listed in the recipe. Even after doubling the olive oil and adding apple sauce and an extra egg, I would have liked the cake to be more moist. I'm glad I added nutmeg too.  I made a lemon glaze and garnished it with pecans and matcha covered chocolates.  I would make this again,  and since I love variety, I'd switch it up and try making it vegan with flaxmeal instead of eggs.

I made this bread twice. The 1st time I made it I followed the recipe and directions exactly. Result: My son, his wife and both of his boys loved it (hence, the 5 Stars). Both my Husband and I are diabetic, so the 2nd time I made it, I altered it (as I alter all of my "for our consumption only" quickbread recipes) by: (a) using 3/4 All-Purpose flour + 1/4 White Wheat Flour; (b) 1/2 Canola Oil + 1/2 Applesauce; and (c) substituting Splenda for the Sugar . And it was delightful -- especially at Breakfast and especially when my "secret ingredient" (Vanilla extract) Cream Cheese spread was applied. I've been using my Vegetable Peeler to prepare my "additions" to my Breads for years (and then I cut the pieces into 3rds or quarters) and I made no exception here. This Bread freezes well. Next time, I'm going to make it into Muffins (reducing baking time to 35-40 minutes) if only because Muffins are easier to grab and run with on busy weekday mornings.

This was okay. I didn't use nuts because they're not allowed in my kids' school lunches.  A good use of any zucchini or apple that you need to clear out of the fridge. I couldn't tell there was apple in the bread. I don't think I'd make this again.

I made this gluten free using almond flour, gluten free pie crust mix and a little gluten free Bisquick to make up the required amount of flour. My bread was light, fluffy, moist and super wonderful!!! I will put this on my favorites list.

Made no changes, except, did add raisins.  This is a good moist bread.  Did not taste shredded apple,  so next time, I'll use a tart Granny Smith apple.  And, there will definitely be a next time!

Batter is very thick, thought I'd have to add more liquid ~ however after I added the zucchini and apple the batter loosened up enough to finish and spoon into pans.  Tasty, perfect  with tea or coffee!  I cut the loaves into serving size pieces and froze them to take on a  camping trip.  Two thumbs up!

I've made this several times in the last year. I swapped out all the oil for apple sauce, and half the white flour with whole wheat flour. I also added 1/2 cup of raisins and, reduced the sugar by a third. The bread is moist and just sweet enough for the entire family.  This recipe makes great muffins as well. I sprinkled course sugar on the tops before baking at 350 degrees for 20-22 minutes. It yielded 18 regular sized muffins.  Delicious!

I used grated zucchini and chopped and grated apple (honey crisp).  Didn't have walnuts is I used cinnamon roasted pecans.  Smelled great in the oven and tasted great.  Moist and flavorful. Recipe is a keeper.

We tried this recipe and thought it came out too dense. The version of this recipe that we liked best included these modifications (based on 12 servings): 1 cup flour, 1 cup oats, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup white sugar, used un-peeled zucchini and un-peeled apples. 

Next time we make it, we will reduce the sugar to just 1/4 cup brown sugar (or possibly use honey) and add some unflavored protein powder and more walnuts. I also may try melted butter or coconut oil instead of vegetable oil. 

Anyway, great starting recipe for us. I'm writing this review so that I can remember my modifications.

I tried it once, and made a double batch soon after! I used 1/2 oil, 1/2 applesauce, and shredded the zucchini and apple with a salad shooter. I also made them into muffins. 20-23 minutes was a more manageable wait for my sugar fix. :) Thank you for the recipe!

I shredded both the apple and the zucchini and made one loaf, a dozen muffins and six mini muffins.  It was good but I will probably try a different recipe next time.

I made this recipe without the nuts and shredded the zucchini and apple. Also I cut the flour by 1/4 cup and added 1/4 cup ground flax seed.  It is delicious!  My family requests it often, great recipe!

I used 1/4 cup of low-fat sour cream and 1/4 cup oil instead of the full 1/2 cup of oil. It turned out very well!

This came out dry.  I halved the recipe for one loaf and it appeared too dense going in, so I should've known.  I even shredded everything as others had suggested.  Maybe at 45 mins I over baked it, I dunno.  I do like the flavor though, so I will try again and add 1/2 c u/s applesauce and bake 5 mins less  to see if that helps.

O my goodness, this was so good! the crust was crispy and sweet and the inside soft and fluffy and perfect. The recipe is great, don't need to change anything. Chop or grate the zucchini and apple, comes out good either way. One time I was out of oil and used buttermilk, it was just as good.

i just made this bread..it was too dry when i mixed it up..i used a food chopper for the apples and zucchini and when it was all put together, it was really dry..no way it would pour..so i added a can (8 oz) of crushed pineapple..and a dash of cloves and a dash of nutmeg..this is an excellent recipe and adding the pinapple only made it better..and the moisture level was much better..this is my new favorite bread recipe..gave it four stars as i think the recipe should have been moister, but with the addition of the pineapple, i will say it is a 5..i also added a handful of raisen that i had left in the fridg..very tasty

We Felt that the instructions to use chopped zucchini and apple should be shredded. The product itself was delicious.  The bread was moist and filling. Great recipe.

Really great recipe, and great use for all my zucchini/summer squash and apple! I made the changes I usually make to baked recipes (ww flour, less sugar, applesauce for part of oil, twice as much spice), and my amounts of zucchini/summer squash and apple weren't exactly the same, and it held up great. Moist, slightly sweet, rich... I'm sure it's wonderful exactly as is, and I can tell you that it's fantastic to play around with too!

This is a great recipe. I used safflower oil instead of vegetable oil and raisins instead of walnuts. I also cut down on sugar to 3/4 cup of each. Came out moist and perfect. Big hit with whole family and a very fresh squirrel!

LOVE LOVE LOVE! My husband was shocked when he saw me adding the zucchini( I tossed in walnuts too), but all I've gotten from him since are the best compliments! It's almost sweet enough to be a dessert cake, it's wonderful. Will make again and again!

Great! I gave one loaf away as a gift and it was much enjoyed.  I reduced the amount of sugar (used 1/2 cup white, 3/4 cup brown) and replaced 1 and 1/4 cups white flour with wheat.  And as suggested by other reviewers, I grated the zucchini and apple.  Plan on making again today.

A VERY nice dense moist zucchini bread. Chopped the zucchini very fine and the apple into small chunks. Cut the sugar in half and used all cane sugar instead. Still can taste the sweetness but wasn't overwhelming. May consider substituting some of the sugar next time with stevia and using applesauce instead of oil to cut down on the calories.

very yummy recipe!!  I made some changes like the reviewers said to make it more healthy.  I added wheat flour, wheat germ, 2 eggs and 4 egg whites, and applesauce.  I also added more cinnamon since I love the taste and smell of it.  I made one loaf bread and 24 mini muffins. I also grated the apples and zucchini and didn't add walnuts.

Loved this recipe, I added additional spices, but I'm sure was very good without them.  Thanks for submitting this recipe!

I halved the recipe because I wasn't sure all of it would fit in my bread pan. Next time I will make the whole thing. I can honestly say this is the first time I made bread & it turned out! It tastes very similar to pumpkin bread. I will definately be making this again!

It was great, but just like great zucchini bread. The apple isn't really noticeable, but it was delish. I made it with applesauce instead of oil.
