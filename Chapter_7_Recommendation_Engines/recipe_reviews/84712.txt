Really tasty! Made a nice, quick lunch on the weekend. I used around 1/3 cup Country Crock instead of butter, and it tasted just fine. :) I also used 1 cup mozzarella and 1 cup Mexican blend cheese, and more like a whole cup of olives. I think I might have to add bacon next time, that would be awesome! Thanks for sharing, Tara!

I’ve been trying a few bruschetta/crostini/cheese breads lately and made this one yesterday for Hubs and I to snack on during the football game.  EXCELLENT!!  I just loved this!!  I made just a small amount (1/4 of the recipe) using half black and half pimento stuffed green olives.  I sliced my bread and toasted both sides under the broiler, spread on the cheese mixture and broiled again until just beginning to bubble and brown.  I noticed that there’s no salt in this recipe, but after tasting it, I realized immediately that no salt is needed, as there is plenty in the olives.  I will definitely make this again and I’m anxious to try it using a greek olive blend I’ve found at the olive bar in the deli at my grocery store.  I can see adding a little green onion to this too!  YUM!  UPDATE 12/2/10 - Made this again using sliced ciabatta and the same black and pimento stuffed green olives, but this time I added some well drained diced pimentos for more color - beautiful!

I have tried a previous version of olive bread, but this is MUCH BETTER! Simple flavors combined with lots of olives! I only use half of the butter and it still comes out perfect.

I make this often except I use equal amounts of mayo and butter and instead of onion powder add a couple of sliced green onions.  Yummy

I have a similar recipe, mine calls for fresh garlic (2-3 cloves) and 6oz of pimento stuffed green olives chopped (in addition of the black chopped olives) OMG! Pair this a salad or soup, forget about pizza night, we now do Olive Bread Night! YUM YUM

Super simple to make.  You can even prepare it ahead of time. Throw it in the fridge and then pop it in the oven when you are ready.  I personally hate black olives from a can so I was almost tempted to use green olives but I'm glad I stayed true to the recipe.  It was delicious.  It's just a few ingredients but they compliment each other nicely.  It's a very nice looking appetizer if you slice it on the diagonal.  Will make again.  It's a great compliment to soup or even a salad if you're looking for a lite supper. Thanks. Update 12/2010. Made this again and used some red,green & yellow peppers and it was delicious !!  I also used lite mayo and butter alternative to cut back on the grams of fat.  Didn't miss the fat one bit. It was great !

I've made this exactly as listed and I LOVE it.  I absolutely love olives so I usually put more Black Olives than the recipe says. 
On occasion, I've added chopped Green Olives to the recipe to give it a slightly different taste. Green and Black Olives together .... YUMMY!! Sorry, forgot to take a picture before I ate it all!

I would give this bread a hundred stars if I could. Every time I have a group of people over for dinner this is what I serve. It is just something different than your average dinner roll. And I basically use whatever cheese I have on hand if I don't have mozzarella and it always turns out great. It is also the only thing my father in law asks me to make, so this recipe is definitely a keeper for me.

Yum Yum. Everyone asked for the recipe at the party. Easy to make but be sure to rinse the olives first, even then it is still a bit salty but ohhh sooo good. A definate keeper...

OMG....I AM IN LOVE!  This is amazing. I did 1/2 the mayo, butter, garlic powder and onion powder because I wanted to cut down on the fat and people mentioned it was too salty and it worked perfectly! Thanks for such an amazing recipe. This is going to be a regular addition to our meals in this house. Olive lovers must try it!  I have done 1/2 green and 1/2 black also and it's wonderful.

This is possibly the best bread EVER!!  I usually add thinly sliced green onions and mushrooms and broil for the last 2 mintues to get a crispy top.  Everyone I've served it to loves it.

Excellent!  I double the black olives.  I have made it with cheddar instead of mozzarella because that's what I had on hand and it was just as good.  Sometimes when I have leftover sandwich bread, I make half a batch of the spread, store it in the frig and pop a slathered slice of bread into the toaster oven whenever I have the urge.  Simple, quick and yummy!

My husband always drills me when I buy a can of black olives - he is not a big fan. it was no different when I had to make a speacial store run for the black olives for this recipe.I promised him I would use sparingly but of course I sneaked the whole 1/2 cup In to the  spread as called for. Needless to say, the whole loaf I made disappeared during the course of our meal.This bread is delishous.  Will definitely make again and again.

This recipe is very good. Used Miracle Whip because that's what I had on hand, and rinsed and drained the olives. You could do so many variations on this. Would be awesome with spaghetti or soup!!

This was a little disappointing, flavor-wise. I followed the recipe exactly, with the only exception of using sliced ciabatta bread. Not sure what else it needs, but it didn't wow us.

This was yummy and easy to make. I made half to go with dinner and saved half to make for lunch tomorrow! Followed the instructions exactly except I use a light margarine to cut on calories.

This was fabulous. I'm not a huge fan of olives but I wanted to try this because it looked different. I didn't have the onion powder so I left it out. Served with Bolognese over angel hair. Will definitely make again.

This recipe came out absolutely AMAZING!   We made the recipe for just 2 servings but made the ingredients cover 3/4 of our med sized baguette.   You can make a little bit go a long way without sacrificing taste.  Also, having done so made the bread less oily.

I made this using bread slices, basil, onions and corned beef.  We all loved it, but I do think that it was a little too buttery.

This is very good! I usually make it just as written, but sometimes I'll add a little cheddar cheese in there too. Either way this recipe is a winner! Love the addition of the black olives for something different. Thanks for sharing. :)

This was good, but I didn't think it had much flavor.  I'll probably make it again, but I'll add some dried herbs.

OMG! This taste just like the cheese bread we get from a local pizza joint. I fallowed the recipe word for word. I think this is sinfully delish. This is going to be a regular for Italian night at my house. Yummy!

I added parsley to the butter mixture & extra garlic, then finished with a light sprinkle of tarragon. Very good! Just needed a side of marinara to dip it in, so we'll make some next time. Yes, there will be a next time.

We enjoyed this recipe. I used third cup for butter/mayo/olive oil. It made a nice consistently and a little healthier. That made enough for 2 loaves of French bread. I used both green and black olives and also fresh basil and oregano I put everything in my food processor and pulsed it. I wrapped 8" pieces with the topping on it and wrapped it in tinfoil and froze it. Nice treat anytime.

The first time I made this bread everyone loved it.  I ended up making it three times that week.  For those who think it is too salty, try rinsing and drying the olives before adding them.   This is so easy and so tasty.  I will definitely be making it many more times.

This was really good, but way too much butter. Next time I will follow others' suggestions and use about half of it.

Was a big hit, use the best cheese possible and I think a cheese combination would also do well.

This was so good. I don't really like mayonnaise but this was amazing. We ate it at my party and loved every bite, mmm so good. But one thing I would change... I made half with green olives and half black and I really liked the green one but other than that DELICIOUS.
