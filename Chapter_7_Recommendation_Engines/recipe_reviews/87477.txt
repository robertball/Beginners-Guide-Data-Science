I make this cake yesterday. Use all-purpose flour instead of cake flour and 1/2 cup of sugar less. The texture was very nice which is soft and moist. Taste just like the cake that my mom bake 30 years ago.

I've made this cake many times now. Its easy to make and delicious too. It is very sweet but when I tried making it with less sugar it didnt taste quite as nice.

I was pleasantly surprised I really didn't expect the cake to come out well because of the margarine and all purpose flour, I expected it to be dense. I have made poundcakes for years only using butter, cake flour, and sour cream. I was a bit surprised when I tried this recipe and it came out moist and delicious. I only made one slight adjustment I only added a 1/2 cup of milk instead of of 1 cup because the batter consistency without the liquid was already close to the usual poundcake consistency and it come out great. Thx

This is the author of the recipe - don't know how to make any comments other than this way...please note that the recipe calls for a tube pan (very important).  A bundt pan was likely too shallow for the batter.  I'm sorry it didn't turn out for you. :(

Okay you guys and gals.  This cake is AWESOME!!!  Do not change a thing.  Just eat the butter and all of the sugar that goes with it.  My cake was gone in just under an hour when my neighbors came by to visit.

This cake is very soft and moist. I made it in a Whinnie the Pooh tin for my daughter, and it turned out lovely. The only thing i would suggest is reducing the amount of sugar, its very sticky to the touch, and 3 cups of sugar is a lot in my opinion. Apart from that, very good. i will definately make again.

LOL, this is a comedy cake!  I followed the directions exactly and used a bundt pan.  It expanded and started running all over the place in the oven.  We had to run fans, open windows and doors because it smoked up the house.  Plus it was as if it had cooked hardly at all.  If only it were April first.  (The batter was extra yummy and I was so looking forward to this...darn it)  I will try again.

Just made this cake! Came out DELICIOUS! I put 2 cups of sugar instead of 3 and didn't add lemon juice. But followed everything else! I also took out of cup of batter and mixed in unsweetened chocolate powder, as one of the previous reviewers did!

What is that swirl in the cake? My cake didn't come out like that. It was very good overall. I didn't use lemon juice and it was fine. Family loved it.

This is a wonderful cake, I did make a few changes like using half butter and half margarine also I used buttermilk instead of the evaporated milk which made for a very moist cake.

This cake always turns out great for me. It does take an hour and half though at 325 degrees and if you don't want it to overflow leave an inch off the top. For more moistier cake I found by error using 5 sticks of margarine 1/2 cup more flour and 1/3 cup only of evaporated milk will also give you beautiful results. Try adding almond extract too!

My family and friends looove it. It's a hit at bake sales and I'm making one now for a birthday party. I use just a little less sugar, margarine, and I can't believe it's not butter.YUMMY
