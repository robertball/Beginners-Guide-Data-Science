I made these with some variations.  I made them bite-size and they were devoured.  Still have a ton of dough left and some filling so will make the rest tomorrow.    My variations were as follows: Substituted shallots for the onions. Added garlic (2 cloves) Add one finely chopped birds eye chili pepper Did an egg wash on top before baking (as another reviewer suggested)  The turnovers were flaky and the flavors complimented each other well.  I will definitely make these again.

These make wonderful appetizers!  Though they're a little putzy to make, they're worth it.  I brush the edges with some beaten egg for a better seal and also brush some on the tops.  I bake them in a slightly hotter oven (400 degrees), too.  Delicious!

These were easy enough to make, but I froze the turnovers before baking. They turned out messy, leaky and sloppy. The filling had way too much liquid after freezing as the turnovers thawed in the oven. In addition, the dough seemed very thick. If trying it again, I'd roll out to 1/8 inch thickness rather than 1/4 inch. And if baking from frozen, I'd try upping the oven temp to 375 so maybe it would mitigate some of the extra liquid.

I have never made pastry successfully before trying this recipie.  They turned out beautifully!  The recipie did yield 22 instead of 10, but they all disappeared fast.  I added cooked crumbled bacon to the filling and more salt, but the rest was the same.  I even took a photo of them, my first success with pastry!

The filling was a little bland thus I changed the recipe. Since the dough was amazing I used it and filled it with brie and cranberry sauce. These were a fantastic appetizer for my Christmas party.

These were fantastic.  I added cooked chopped spinach to the mixture along with some grated parmesan cheese.  Added egg wash to the top of the crust like some suggested.  Really really good.

I'm a little biased because this was my mom's recipe, but it is fantastic.   The dough is extremely easy to work with and I use it for other recipes, like mini sausage rolls.

I only used the crust. Its extraordinary. I used homemade ricotta instead of cream cheese and a few tbsp. oil instead of butter, and also whole wheat pastry flour, inspite of my changes, the crust is spectacular.

The crust was really light and flaky, but the filling was just too bland. If I make this again I'd add some more flavor to it somehow.

Not bad, not great. Pastry turned out nicely flaky, but was fairly difficult to work with. Filling a little bland and somewhat watery - had to thicken it up quite a bit before baking.

Not only has my mom been making these turnovers for years I myself have made them several times and they always turn out stellar and receive rave reviews. The pastry is fabulous and very easy to work with and the filling is tasty. The only adjustments I like to make are the addtion of one large clove of garlic, minced and roughly 1 tbsp of worcestishire sauce for added zip.

This is my Holiday staple for parties ever since I found it in a Philly Cream Cheese cookbook! Not a year goes by that I don't make these. In recent years, I have changed one thing about the recipe - instead of making them as turnovers, I actually make them as mini tarts.

The crust recipe is versatile and delicious as a pie crust, and the filling is better than Trader Joe's version of these (& so expensive to buy)!  Thanks a million, these are a huge hit!

I just assumed the filling would be bland and added couple cloves garlic, a tsp of worcestershire sauce and a dash of Tabasco.  I also did bite size and got about 35 out of it. Lastly I added egg wash and baked them for 25 minutes. I really like them! So much more elegant to bring to a party than your standard fare.

These were really good.  I followed the recipe almost exactly, I had more mushrooms to use up though so mine had a bit more mushroom.  I wasn't sure if there was enough flour in the pastry but they turned out fine after being baked.  They have a great texture as well as a simple but enjoyable taste.

I love these little morsels!  If I have to bring an orvi-dori, my friends always say "bring your mushroom turnovers".  I purchased (at the $1 store) a set of 3 different size plastic, molds that are hinged and the smallest one is the perfect size and seals the edges with a nice crimped edge.  The most important thing is to not put too much filling in to ooze out.  A little finicky to make but worth the effort!! yum yum

These were good. I don't like making dough because it's too much work but this wasn't bad. The second time I made them I took the easy way out and used refrigerated crescent rolls and they were equally good. I took the advice of another reviewer and used some minced garlic.

I've been searching for a recipe similar to the ones my mom used to make (she lost hers). This seems pretty close. I made a few changes to the filling though:  I doubled the thyme I added garlic powder I added a little cooked spinach A smidge of cayenne pepper I used more than 1/2 the onion  And my boyfriend and I both thought they were delicious...

I had some filling to use up so I just made the pastry which was awesome.  Very light and flaky and I thought it was easy to work with.  They do take longer than 15 minutes to bake however, I pronounced them done at about 25 minutes. Thanks for the recipe!

I had some puff pastry to use up so I just made the filling. I added two cloves of garlic and some parmesen cheese (as I didn't have the cream cheese in the pastry). Also didn't add flour to the mixture - not sure why that is needed as the mushroom mixture was not lumpy at all?  Anyway the results were very tasty. Next time I will try making the pastry.

Made the turnovers exactly as written but they turned out just OK... they were bland and definitely missing something (though I can't put my finger on exactly what it was). We served them to our party guests next to a bowl of sour cream to help enhance the general blandness of the turnovers.

Great Filling ! They took a little longer to cook than it said.  Next time I would make the rounds larger than 3" You cannot get much filling in them. In a hurry use refrigerated pie crust instead.

My family loves mushrooms and finger foods. This is always a favorite snack. I use store bought puff pastry to save time and I add lots of garlic to my mushrooms and a little bit of rendered beef fat (I get the fat in chunks from the butcher)for extra flavor instead of butter.

It sounded good on paper, but the filling was too sour; the combination of cheeses did not compliment the mushrooms, particularly the sweetness of the sliced portabellas I chose to use.  This recipe is a little too time-consuming and messy for the unremarkable end result.

These turned out great. I have never made anything like this before. And I found it to be very easy to make, even though it takes quite a while to prepare. But it was worth it. I baked for 20 mins. but I think they could still take another 5 or so. I will do them again. They were also very tender, just melts in your mouth. They are a great substitude for potatoes. Thank you Rachel

These are great!  Admitted, I do not use the dough recipe, just the filling.  I am sure the cream cheese dough is great but every time I try to work with pastry dough it turns into a big fat fail that ends with me cursing loudly.  If you have the same problem, here's a tip.  Get two boxes of the Pepperidge Farm puff pastry sheets (there are two sheets in each box).  Use a pizza cutter or just a knife and cut the sheets into sixths, and use them for your crust.  I up the filling for the recipes slightly, using a full pound of mushrooms, a little more than half a cup of sour cream and increasing all the spices slightly for taste and to account for the increased amount of mushrooms.  I make the filling the night before and refrigerate it then assemble the turnovers and bake them on the holiday, which cuts down on the time I need to work on the actual holiday considerably.  I cook them at the same temperature and for the same time.

These have become a new staple of my Thanksgiving/Christmas table as an appetizer before the meal over the last year or two.  I love mushrooms so when I first heard "mushroom turnovers" I couldn't wait to try them.  They are delicious.  Even my daughter, who claims not to like mushrooms, loves them.

I was disappointed with these. Even my husband, who will scoff anything and everything said these were 'just alright.' I thought the filling was really bland, so I added 2 fat cloves of freshly-minced garlic. The cream cheese pastry was quite nice, but not worth the extra calories, in my opinion. I probably won't make these again, but thanks for the post.

These turned out great, flakey delicious pastry that’s easy to work with. I followed the pastry recipe as written, however I changed the filling just slightly... I added to the mushrooms and onions, pepper, garlic powder, basil and oregano (no thyme .. hehe) and 1tsp of salt and only 1/4 cup of sour cream and it was perfect, not runny and only had maybe couple tbsp leftover. This recipe made 2 dozen delicious turnovers! Will definitely make these again.

These were great! I started my search for a recipe since Trader Joe’s stopped carrying their frozen version. Next time I would use less sour cream in the filling. The dough was very soft and even though I baked them ten minutes longer they never got golden brown and crispy. I’m not sure how to fix that. I froze the remainder (after baking) and reheated in the microwave which was delish. Popping them in the toaster oven afterward crisped then a bit more. I plan to make these again. Adding chicken plus spinach, or steak plus peppers would be good ways to change them up occasionally.

Very easy to make and very good. These are small 4-bite sized, so make a lot of them!

This is a 5 star recipe!! I have made these for years and this is the exact same recipe my family has made. I always get rate E reviews, yes it's a bit time consuming but sooo worth it in the end. I always baste with egg to seal edges and they brown up better. I haven't tried freezing them and then baking them. I always make these fresh the day of I plan to have them.

I made these with a variety of freshly harvested mushrooms I bought from a little stand on the corner. I followed the recipe exactly. These were amazing. Served with a fresh vegetable soup for dinner. I will definitely make these again.

I have been using this recipe for years for New Years and other party times. I use canned mushrooms though, drained and paper towel dried before adding. They can be made ahead and refrigerated until needed. I layer them on parchment sheets on a cookie sheet in fridge so they are easily pulled out and placed directly on cookie sheet for baking quickly for guests. I have also used chopped black olives instead of mushrooms occasionally just to change it up.

I thought this was a great recipe and the possibilities are endless. I made them large, hot pocket style and added chicken and it was our on-the-go dinner and YUM!
