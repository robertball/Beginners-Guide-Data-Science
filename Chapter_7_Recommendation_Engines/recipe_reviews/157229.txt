I took another reviewer's method and used the oven instead of boiling the mixture in a can.  The top layer of the milk did nearly burn after an hour, but it was easily removed.  I used 1/4 rum for one can of milk to adjust it to my tastes...IT'S SO GOOD. I hesitated to use the original method of browning the milk simply because the can has a label saying 'Do Not Heat in Can.' I've been told this pertains to using on a fire, but it was easier and FASTER to go with the oven method anyway.  I do not like the taste of alcohol, so add the rum slowly until you have the taste you want. The full amount would be too much for 'light' drinkers.

I found this recipe when trying to use up the rest of a can of sweetened condensed milk. Since the can was opened, I had to find a different method of heating the milk. I put the milk into a pie plate and the pie plate into another dish that I filled with boiling water. I placed this into a 375 oven for about an hour. Then continued with the recipe. I also blended the mixture because otherwise there would have been lumps. It is delicious and only took an hour and 15 minutes (total) to make instead of the almost 5 hours it states on here.

Wow! This is great! The only things I did different was boil the milk for only 3 hours - I was worried it would become too thick. I also added a couple of tablespoons extra of rum until it was the consistancy I wanted. Though it takes a little time its very easy and very fancy!

This is the best.  Everybody so impressed.  Great to make camping & that is what we are doing sitting around the campfire on a cool evening sipping warm caramel liqueur. I wouldn't change a thing & not worried about storage

AWESOME!! I didn't want to go out and the only alcohol I had on New Years Eve was about a 1/3 of a bottle of Amber Brandy but I did have a can of sweetened condensed milk. I was skeptical (and a little scared) but it worked wonderfully. I peeled off the paper and boiled the can in a 3 qt. covered Farberware pan covered with water for 2 hrs and 45 mins. It was perfect. It did take some mixing to combine the brandy with the caramel. Very smooth. Looking forward to trying it again with spiced rum, also in my coffee. Happy New Year!

Lovely taste and smell. Easy to make too, just takes time. We'll see how it keeps but for now it's lovely.

This tasted amazing, and was so easy.  The only change I will make in the future is adding a bit more rum.  It was very thick and hard to pour, or sip, at room temp.

Excellent! Can also add whipping cream makes it easier to pour. Have added Brandy in place of the rum. Wonderful. Thank you

Decadent!  Very sweet and thick, but sinfully good.  I'm betting this would be good drizzled over ice cream or pound cake.

Delicious! But very thick. I used a blender to mix all ingredients together and strained the final product into a jar (there were some remaining chunks). Note to future caramel liqueur makers, boiling the metal cans left a rust ring around my stainless steel pot that I cannot remove. I will try the double broiler method next time.

If you go to the Mexican section of the grocery you will find this already made.  It is called Nestle La Lechera  Dulce de Leche Caramel.  This is exactly what everyone is making.  I used to make it myself until I found this.  It's great.  Just open and use.

Tasty, but very thick and very sweet.  It tastes just like the Brachs caramels...

I ended up adding another 1/4 - 1/2 cup of rum to thin it down and make it more drinkable.  I also put it in the blender to smooth out any clumps, as whisking did not do the trick.

Good stuff though - I am considering adding a little sea salt for a salted caramel taste.  I may also add the whipping cream as another reviewer suggested.
