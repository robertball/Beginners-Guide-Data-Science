Delicious.  I thought there was too much sugar, so I modified to the following: 1.5 lbs taro (2 cups of .5 inch cubes) 5 Tablespoons white sugar 1 Tablespoons brown sugar 1 can (13.5 ounce) coconut milk 1/2 teaspoon sea salt  Simmered until the taro was VERY tender, almost dissolving. Took about 20-30 minutes on low.   Note that the taro releases a lot of starch, thickening the liquid into a porridge-like consistency.  Will definitely make again.

I made this up for my Xmas get-together. It's good the way it is, but I added a 10oz can of naturally-sweetened pineapple chunks to fill it out. It's twice as good that way.

This recipe was so easy to make. It's a quick way for me to use up the Taro I had left over from making dumplings. Personally, I don't like it too sweet, so I took out some of the sugar.

My mom makes this. It's a great dessert for vegans who cannot have grains.
