I halved this recipe and came up with 19 meatballs, making sure to have no leftover parts.  I used 2 Italian sausages and 1 pound of hamburger, using a small cookie scoop for the sausage (and that cut in half) and a larger scoop for the hamburger.  It was a little difficult to get the sausage meat to stick together, but they held up well with the boiling method.  For the sauce I used only one 28 ounce can of San Marzano tomatoes with basil, otherwise following the recipe.  This all turned out well, and we (hubby and I)  enjoyed the dinner, as did my son's family, who received all the leftovers.  I don't think that if I were to make these again that I would bother with making the little meatball in the middle because in the end you couldn't tell the difference between the two----it would have been fine just to mix all those ingredients together.  Maybe it would be fun if there were a different color to one or the other after cooking.  We did have a nice dinner, so thank you, lynn socko!

I changed slightly to include 1 pound of Italian pork, 1 pound Italian turkey and I pound premium beef.  Mixing all together and baked as instructed.  Very tasty!
