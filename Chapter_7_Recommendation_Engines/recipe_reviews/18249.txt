These were sooooooo delicious, but I did a few things different. Like other users, I cut the potatoes into smaller pieces, about an inch. They only took about 40 minutes to cook. I was out of oregano, so I just stuck with the olive oil, salt and pepper, but I added 2 garlic cloves (crushed), and half of a yellow onion, diced. OMG was it good! Thanks for the recipe. I've never done sweet potatoes like this, so I'm very glad I found this recipe.  ***Update*** I made these with some cheddar cheese sprinkled on top for the last 15 minutes or so. So yummy!

I made this recipe exactly as written.  The only thing I changed was that I cut the peices a little smaller ( 1.5 inch cubes)  I covered them for the first 20 minutes then baked for an additional 30 minutes.  They were SO DELICIOUS!  I love oregano and I was surprised to have it on sweet potatoes, but it was fantastic.  I shuffled the potatoes around 3 times during baking so that they wouldn't be hard on the bottoms.

After following the directions, I thought there was to much oregano taste.  So I tried it again by bumping up the salt & pepper to 1 teaspoon each and the oregano to 1/2 a teaspoon. I dump everything into a large bowl and mix it all by had to get the potatoes well coated, then bake as directd.  I do not turn them over. YUM.  Now it is one of my favorites.

These were a big hit with my fiance.  He hates sweet potatoes, but I pressed on and tried them anyway.  I'm glad I did because he requests these time and again.  The only thing I do differently is to poke holes in the potatoes and put them in the microwave for a few minutes to soften them up before cutting into cubes.  The first time I made them it took me 30 minutes to cut up two large sweet potatoes and my hands were cursing me afterwards.

Great recipe and a nice change usual sweet, sugary sweet potato side dishes! I love sweet potatoes so roasting them like this was not only tasty, but just as easy as wrapping them in foil and baking them. I cut the potatoes into small pieces, opted for rosemary vs. oregano and sprayed my baking dish with a little Pam before baking. I also upped my oven temp. to 400. I turned them a few times during baking and they were done in about 45 minutes. Excellent with grilled pork tenderloin.

Excellent! What a great healthy way to make sweet potatoes. I agree with others that it was nice to see a sweet potatoe recipe that did not call for brown sugar! The whole family loved this (husband and 21 month old daughter) I will make this again and again. I used rosemary instead of oregano and season salt instead of regular salt.  **** I have made this recipe with both the oregano as called for and the rosemary as many reviewers recommend and the rosemary is MUCH better.

Love this. I was looking for a healthy way to prepare sweet potatoes, and this is it. Tastes nice as written, but I now add Hungarian Paprika to give it some kick. Cayenne works as well. Also, if you want just a little sweetness to this, without making the candied version, some carmelized onions mixed in after baking tastes marvelous!

Lots of points from me for being easy and savory. I made this with yams. I'm a fan of sweet potatoes and yams but I hate those sticky candied yam dishes. Ugh. This recipe is simple but brings out the flavor of the yams instead of drowning them in syrup.

I was also looking for a sweet potato recipe that wasn't full of brown sugar and marshmallows. This was perfect. Everyone in the family enjoyed it. I plan on using this recipe frequently this summer when we're doing a lot of grilling - this will be a perfect side dish, and I may try this on the grill, too. Thanks for the recipe!

Very easy recipe, seems sweet potatoes are pretty flavorful with having to do too much to them and this recipe proves that.
I followed a couple of the other member suggestions and it turned out excellent. I got the orange potatoes instead of yellow and cut them up a bit smaller than they suggest (about 1-1.5" cubes) and let them cook for about 1hr 10 min just to make sure they cooked through.

Good recipe, however, I ended up modifying by:  Preheat oven to 400; did not peel potatoes (scrub well) as skins are thin and make a delicious crunchy crust when roasted; in bowl mix 1/2 envelope dry onion soup mix with dried parsley (amount to your taste) and 2-3 cloves pressed garlic; in bowl, toss the largely diced potatoes in enough olive oil to coat; add dry ingredients and mix well; spray pan generously with cooking spray and spread potatoes evenly in pan; baked for approx 40 mins.(depending on your oven), turning after 20.

I love sweet potatoes but this dish didn't wow me. The potatoes took forever to cut up. I sub'd rosemary for the oregano (not a fan of oregano). Stirred a few times during the baking time for even cooking. Not sure what I could do differently but I imagine this would taste better if caramelized some.

I left out the oregano but these were still really great. Even my husband, who isn't crazy about sweet potatoes, liked these. I like that the flavor of the sweet potatoes wasn't overpowered by anything. When I made them, I simply tossed the potatoes in the olive oil, salt, and pepper in the baking dish them popped them in the oven on 350 covered for 15 mins, gave them a stir, then baked covered for 20-30 mins. They were very tender (almost too soft though) and delish! Next time, I'll bake the last 20 mins uncovered.

OH MY HEAVENS. These were absolutely delicious! I did make a few changes. Personally I don't see any reason to use so much oil, so I used one tablespoon for one large sweet potato. I cut the potato in half twice, cut it into bite size pieces (probably 1/2 thick, 2 inches long), put them in a bowl, combined the oil, a pinch of italian seasoning, 1/4 tsp rosemary, and a few sprinkles of seasoning salt. Mix that up, put on an aluminum foil lined baking sheet, and they were done in 20 minutes! I am in love. I'll be making these again. And again.

This was absolutely DELISH!!!  I didn't have plain oregano, so I used a "Complete Italian Seasoning" and it worked perfectly!!  My husband is NOT a fan of Sweet Potatoes but he could not get enough of these. Will definitely be making these again. 

Side note - I forgot how difficult it was to cut raw sweet potatoes... OUCH!! :(

Yummers!!  I opted for a little rosemary and thyme instead of oregano, and cut the pieces smaller. Sooo good!  I always get compliments and questions about how they were cooked when serving to guests.

I've always baked my sweet potatoes whole, wrapped in tin foil and they take forever and then you still have to peel the volcano hot potato!  This was perfect without the oregano.. and only took about 60 minutes for perfectly done sweet potato goodness.  Top with a little more salt & pepper and some low cal butter.. it's a hit with us!

Loved these! Unique way to make sweet potatoes. I cut mine into 1 inch cubes so it cut the cooking time down to about 35 minutes. I also placed all my cubed potatoes into a large bowl before cooking, and lightly coated them with olive oil. Much easier than having to turn each one on the pan. I followed the recipe as followed and absoloutely loved it!

I finally met a sweet potato that I liked! I've never had any that I liked without being in a soup or something, but I really enjoyed this recipe.   It was easy to make, quick to prep, took minor alterations well, and was well worth waiting for. I added it to the top rack of the oven to cook while my Thanksgiving turkey was finishing. Great addition without yet more super sweet stuff!  Since I'd searched dozens of recipes prior to deciding on this route, I ended up adding a couple of spices, namely Hungarian paprika and cayenne pepper. Oh, and I tossed in some rosemary. Not being sure how those would taste strength-wise, I only used two pinches of each of those, too. It worked out quite nicely and not hot.   Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I made these with white sweet potatoes as I don't like the orange ones, and followed the recipe, and they were very good. I shook all the ingredients in a plastic bag - so much easier than dirtying a bowl. Turned halfway - 40 min later they were done!!! Thanks for a great recipe. Update 1/21/09: I tried these again tonight with herbes de provence as I wanted to try the rosemary, but was out, and they were better than the oregano version!! Cut into approx 1" chunks, baked 325 in conv. oven for about 40 min, but prob could have done them for 30+/- min as they were too soft.

This was simple and perfect for a nice light side.  I did get a late start so I microwaved my cubes first for about 5 minutes with just a little bit of water, then laid them out on a sheet pan and followed the directions to roast them up in the oven.  Any number of spices or additions would have been nice also, but I wanted to stay true to the recipe.  I cut my sweet potato into rounds first, and then cubes.  DH really liked them also.  He said he has had SP fries before, but he thought the cubes really held their spices better.  Thanks for sharing!

Great way to eat sweet potatoes and something I would have never thought to do. As others suggested, I cut the potatoes into smaller cubes, but followed the recipe other than that. Will definitely make again!

I have been roasting sweet potatoes/yams for years. I peel and cube them to 1.0-1.5 inch cubes, it never takes me more than 10 minutes to do this. Then I toss them in oil, sprinkle with spices and spread them out on a foil (or parchment) lined cookie sheet. Never takes more than 20-30 minutes to cook. If you don't turn them (I don't) they get crispy and brown on the bottom, but we love that.

Delicious!  Follow oil quantities carefully - too much makes mushy potatoes. Just right makes yummy crispy on the outside, soft on the inside!

This was really good. As others suggested, I added 1 small onion and extra olive oil and seasonings. I used an Italian dried herb blend. Delicious!

Made according to review with olive oil, salt & pepper, half chopped onion and tbs garlic.  It was awesome!  I wasn't sure how this would be with the sweetness, but such a nice surprise.  Maybe I'll try the cheddar cheese as she suggested next time.

Excellent dish!! I didn't have oregano by itself, so I used a spice and herb blend (a non-cajun blend).  The spice blend has oregano, basil, salt, etc.    Since I used the blend, I did not add more salt or black pepper.  I cut the potatoes in bite size pieces, put in zip lock bag with oil and spices (1 tsp) to coat the pieces well.  I only had to bake them about 45 minutes and turned them every 15 minutes.  YUMMY!!!!

These turned out just okay for me. My family all said they tasted good but I changed it up a bit. I cut them quite small but even then it took longer than an hour at 400! For the last 10 minutes I bumped it up to 450 but by then the rest of my food was sitting out and cold :(
I took someone else's advice and kept the skins on - yuck. They did not get crispy and they were just tough. I added salt and cinnamon. I did like the flavor - that was the best thing I could say for these potatoes. I will keep playing with the recipe...

I made these to go with our pork chop dinner tonight, and they were delcious!!  Not being a huge fan of either too much oregano or rosemary, I went with a dash of both, used extra virgin olive oil, seasoned salt, and freshly cracked pepper.  I cut them smaller, as some viewers suggested, and baked them for about 45 minutes.  My daughter (who despises most sweet potato recipes), ate them off of her plate like they were candy!  Even my husband had a large helping...the next time, I guess I'll have to double or triple this recipe.  Thanks for a great sweet potato recipe!

These were wonderful!  Even healthier than baked in foil, because then you add butter...this way, you get your healthy olive oil in!  Kids love these.  I just used ground sea salt, fresh ground black pepper, a little garlic powder and onion powder, then just a sprinkling of basil.  Terriffic!

This is a yummy side dish.  I do recommend cutting the sweet potato a lot smaller than mentioned so that it cooks through & is crispy.

I once had sweet potatoes, oh, let's just say decades ago.  Once.  Whoever made them (not my mom I'm sure of it) left an indelible impression on me of disgusting sweet potato mash with billows of melted marshmallows baked on top. It ruined me for life. And Hubs didn't like them either. Now that I'm a reasonably grown woman I wanted to give them a second chance - I typed sweet potatoes into a recipe search and I specifically excluded anything sweet - marshmallows, honey, maple syrup, brown sugar - everything.  This recipe, so similar to roasted potatoes, is just what I had in mind - and what I hoped I might be able to tolerate.  I seasoned them with rosemary rather than oregano and baked them at 400 degrees for about 20 minutes - I anticipated them getting a little crispy that way (they didn't) and besides, Hubs was ahead of me on his pork rib roast, so I had to hustle things along.  I actually had intended to turn them at that point and then continue roasting for another 15-20 minutes, but they were done!  Nicely caramelized and fork tender.  They were good - not squash good, or oven roasted potatoes good, but good. I could have been persuaded to even make them again - except that unlike me, Hubs did not prove to be a convert.

I tossed and coated to make sure none of the potatoes were too dry.  So simple and different than all the other recipes that call for brown sugar and marshmallows.  All those recipes go best with pork or ham.  These are great with anything.  I served this with steak.  Would work well with regular potatoes, too

Thank you for submitting a 'healthy' recipe for sweet potatoes.  It seems that everyone is obsessed with adding sugar to a vegetable that has it's own natural sweetness.

Hard on outside and soft on inside; Need to extend cooking time; I used the pale yellow sweet potatoes rather than the bright orange ones.  Maybe that is why mine did not taste very good.

Though my kids weren't a big fan, I sure enjoyed them...I ate the leftovers the following day. I thought it was a welcome change from sweet potatoes dripping with butter/sugar/marshmallow.  I actually prefer it this way.

Simple and exactly what I was looking for. I put the potatoes in the dish first, drizzle with oil and sprinkle with seasonings, then toss them all together with two spatulas. If I was making these just for me I would have added more salt, possibly seasoned salt, but DS doesn't like too much salt :) Thanks for sharing your foolproof method! Oh, I convect roasted at 325 and they only took 30 minutes.

I love roasted sweet potatos. However I cook them at 425 for 20-25 minutes. They get browned on the sides and are soft in the middle. Yum.

I love this recipe.  I have tried it as described here, with rosemary instead, with rosemary AND oregano, with a little extra chile powder (spicy + sweet!)... all are delicious!  I usually use pam olive oil spray instead of olive oil, though.

Such a great healthy snack or side! I used Pam to make it even lower calorie and it worked out beautifully. I cut the potato into 1" cubes, added a few large pieces of garlic, and used rosemary instead of oregano.

I'm not a fan of mashed potatoes, so this is quite a nice alternative. I change it up sometimes, substituting cinnamon for the oregano.

My family loved this recipe! Everybody ate it, my anti-sweet potatoe husband, the toddler and the other kids. It was pretty simple, I used half oregano and half rosemary after reading the other reviews. This one is a keeper, glad I found it!

I microwaved the sweet potatoes for 3 minutes after peeling and washing.  As suggested, I used rosemary instead of oregano, and it was tasty.

These were great!  I added basil and will do a little less oregano next time. I did add a little brown sugar though which we loved.  We're always eating super healthy and little bit of brown sugar makes them oh so perfect =)

We added fresh rosemary and chopped garlic to this recipe - otherwise made it as written. Delicious!
For Elizabeth32, after looking at the review over 6 pages, was able to find only one mispelling of potato, except for yours. The plural of potato is potatoes, not potato's. Wouldn't have brought this up if you hadn't.

Uhhhh, these were okay but not memorable. My hubby didn't like them at all. I even made a mix of white russets for him and the sweet ones for me. He tried both and pushed them aside. I thought it was okay but just okay. Thanks I had fun making and trying out a new dish.

Very tasty.  I left the skin on for extra nutrition and threw in a handful of pine nuts, just because they were there and I like them.   Sweet potatoes are so good for you, I didn't want to ruin them with all the extra stuff people are using.

This was an odd...ok, bad taste.  I just don't think oregano and sweet potatoes go together at all.  My husband did not eat the potatoes after trying to force a few down.  I won't repeat this recipe.

This was okay.  The potatoes were soft - I think I like them a little crispier.  Next time I'll bake them on a baking pan instead of a glass dish.  I used Italian Seasonings.

I think I made this smaller potatoes than it called for, but it still turned out great! I followed some advice and softened the potatoes in the microwave (def. shortened oven time) and used half teaspoon of each dry ingredient.  We liked it with olive oil too.  I will make it again!

Delicious!!  I made this with rosemary instead of oregano.  I cut the sweet potatoes up into 1" pieces and added coarsely chopped onions. I put all ingredients into a Ziploc bag and mixed thoroughly. Baked for about 45 minutes at 400.  I will definitely be making again!

I didn't notice the oregano as an ingredient until reading the reviews, then I was doubtful.  So many positive comments convinced me to choose this particular recipe over the others in my search.  I followed the suggested 2:1 salt&pepper to oregano and it was outstanding.  Thanks for such a tasty recipe.

I have never in my life liked the sweet potato dishes that are most commonly served (marshmallows, brown sugar, etc.); but this is delicious!!!  I'm so happy that I finally have a way to make sweet potatoes in a way that is so pleasing to me.  I plan to make this dish several times a month.  Thanks for a great recipe!!!

this came out great- i made it with some modifications that were suggested in other reviews- cut in bite-sized pieces, seasoned with a combination of oregano and rosemary, salt and pepper. 
i also made this with just one large baked potato, which made two servings. because of the smaller recipe size, i was able to make this in a square pan that fit in a toaster oven- with these modifications, the potatoes only had to bake for about 30 minutes (and they were delicious!)

Confession: I subbed rosemary for the oregano after reading reviews, and I'm glad I did.  Rosemary just sounded so good with these... and it is!! The sweet potato and herb combo smell heavenly while roasting.  Great side dish, thanks for the recipe!

This was simple and delicious... I used Herbes de Provence that contained both oregano and rosemary instead of just oregano based on comments from other reviews stating that rosemary was great on the potatoes.  So glad I did!  I served it with maple-garlic marinated pork tenderloin from this site, and the flavors went wonderfully together.  Thank you for a great, non-sweet, sweet potato recipe! LOL

I am going to try this today because one of my children hates sweet potatoes and a couple others are not fond of it, but they all love oregano and I think something other than mashed will go over better. Emily said her fiance doesn't like sweet potatoes and loved these, so I was encouraged to check them out.  For anyone that thinks that sweet potatoes are hard to peel and cut up, you can always try the boil method to remove skin and soften potato.  I don't know if that would make potatoes too soft so I don't think I'll do it that way the first time.

I just started making this recipe a couple of years ago. In my family growing up the only time we had sweet potato's was for the holidays, my mother always fixed the candied type recipe and we all know you can only deal with that dish once a year. Poor mom, she missed out on enjoying this versatile vegetable throughout the year in a healthier way.  I usually fix this with a combination of sweet potato and yam or even beets, I like the colors. I also vary the herbs I use, oregano, rosemary or sage, sometimes even minced fresh garlic.  I chop up my potato's in the same manner this recipe calls for, I find that they get crispier on the outside while remaining nice and steamy on the inside, if you cut them up smaller be sure to cut your baking time by about 10-15 minutes or they will just become over cooked and hard.
One last word, In reading a couple dozen of the reviews I noticed that about 95% of the reviewers misspelled the word "potato", is this an American phenomenon?

Awesome! as a sweet potato hater due to marshmallow/sugar casserole being the main recipe out there, I was hesitant to try this. Totally a convert now. 

I've tried this subbing the oregano with lots of other herbs so I don't get bored eating it all the time. Rosemary, thyme, marjoram, they have all come out great!

Big hit at dinner last night!  Cut them into 3/4" chunks.  Tossed to coat in pan as suggested.  Instead of the spices recommended I used Kirkland's Tuscan Spice Blend liberally.  Tossed them again, baked full 60 minutes and they came out beautifully browned and delicious.

This was excellent. We only used one potato cut in inch size chunks, one small yellow onion and spiced it up with garlic, salt, pepper and italian seasoning. Loved it!

Made these last night after searching for a healthy recipe for sweet potatoes.  I am training for a half marathon and this type of carb is excellent.

I didn't use the olive oil, instead sprayed them with Pam used Mrs. Dash, salt and pepper for the spice.  Threw them in the roasting pan with "Juicy Roasted Chicken" also from this sight.

It was really tasty!! Will definitely make again.

This is a great recipe.  I love sweet potatoes, but my husband will not eat them because he says they are too sweet.  I made this with a savory pork roast the other night and it was a hit!  I followed this recipe as it is written but I also added mexican and chipotle chili powders for a little spice. I couldn't believe how good the oregano tastes with the sweet potatoes!

Celebrating Thanksgiving in France this year as I've already made my annual pilgrimage back home to the U.S. (in July).  Couldn't find a whole turkey to prepare (and didn't have time anyway, what with working all day) so I cooked breaded turkey cutlets and green beans sauteed in garlic butter along with baked sweet potatoes. 
 
After reading reviews, I decided to precook in the microwave before putting into the oven.  I think maybe I precooked them a little too much; nevertheless, they were absolutely delicious, and my English husband and I were both very happy!  

This is something I will most definitely make again.  Thank you!

3421I had never done this with sweet potatoes before but do it with red potatoes all the time.  I changed the recipe to the way I do my red potatoes....instead of oregano (which I hate) I used rosemary, I also added 1/2 a diced onion and 2 cloves of minced garlic.  It was wonderful.  My husband who likes everything the sweeter the better even liked it.  Although the look I got when I told him this was how we were eating the sweet potatoes was not what I had hoped for.  He told me after dinner that I could make the sweet potatoes like that anytime I like (except for thanksgiving ... please put marshmallows on them)  lol.  Thanks so much for sharing.  I will absolutely be using this recipe again!

Made these on the BBQ with our Christmas in July turkey.  If my nephews could say how good they were instead of just smile and open their mouths I would write their review as well.  Maybe next year.  PS the Adults raved about these as well.

Delicious!  I cut them a little smaller as one suggested and they took about 50 minutes to cook.  I also used Tony's Chachere's Seasoning with just a touch of oregano.  Perfect!

The time mentioned left my potatos crunchy. I ended up adding mine to a stew broth for a few minutes.  That did the trick.

I made this recipe  but i added baby carrots and brown potatos to it. Instead of oregano i used rosemary. It came out so delicious.

Very nice and different than the loaded up with bad ingredient sweet potatoes dishes. Each piece firm on the outside, creamy sweetness on the inside. Loved it, do not like most sweet potatoe preparations I have previously experienced.

I don't really like sweet potatoes, but I decided to try this recipe anyway. They were pretty good. I couldn't get over the weird sweetness the potato had, but I still enjoyed them.

I love this recipe - as a vegetarian I am always looking for variations on staples. I love using sweet potatoes/yams, and this has become my staple dish! I didn't change anything about the recipe, I just cut the potatoes really small to speed the cooking time. Love it!

I used a combo of white and orange sweet potatoes.  This is a recipe that lends a lot of flexibility in that you don't really need to measure anything.  Just season to taste.

Very tasty! Like other reviewers, I too cut the sweet potato into smaller pieces so it took maybe 45 minutes to cook. I included white potatoes in the mix as well.

We love a good savory sweet potato dish as opposed to the plethora of sweet candied ones out there. This is so simple, so tasty, and is a perfect side to accompany so many main dishes. Personally, I could eat the whole batch myself, but that wouldn't be nice. :) Thanks for sharing the recipe! It's a keeper!

Good but nothing special. Hard to rate because baked sweet potato, even if it was unseasoned is tasty to me.

This is the best sweet potato recipe I have used so far.  I love the saltiness of them contrasted with the sweeter taste of the potato.  I omit the oregano b/c I don't like it and use sweet basil instead.

This was delicious.  I only used 1 tbsp of olive oil because I'm not too keen on unnecessary calories and it was just wonderful.  I used a 1/2 tsp or oregano, salt, and pepper each as I assumed we weren't supposed to use 2 pinches of each as I see in the recipe.  I also followed the idea of one of the previous posters and covered it for half of the cooking time.  This is definitely a keeper.

This is the best healthy sweet potato recipe that I've ever seen.  I had a to cook the potatoes a little longer, but it probably depends on how small the pieces are.

i always thought sweet potatoes were sweet because of the brown sugar and butter they usually came dripping with, but this was a delightful surprise at how good and sweet these still were with just a hint of salty side flavor

I used smaller pieces of sweet potatoes and followed everything else exactly... I just thought it was kind of bland and boring. If I make it again I'll try putting more spices and salt and pepper on it.

This is a wonderful recipe.  Like others, I wanted a good, healthy recipe that wasn't drenched in sugar or marshmallows.  This really fit the bill!  I did add more salt as I find potatoes generally need a significant amount to bring out the flavors.  I have a whole box of sweets and will likely be making this a lot!

I made this recipe hoping it would be a nice change from regular potatoes.  They were fabulous.  I think I could have eaten them all myself, but I had to share with my husband and sons.  The oregano is a great addition.  I will make these often now.  Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!

These are really good. As others had mentioned, I cut the potatoes in bite size pieces, and also put all ingredients in a bag to mix.  Hubby wished they  had more crunch to them, so next time I will try stirring more often.  For added fun, I sprinkled Parmesean Cheese and let sit in oven turned off while the rest of dinner finished (maybe 5 min).  Will make again

Wow, what a great way to eat sweet potatoes!  My family has always traditionally eaten them baked with just some butter.  These were much better and had a LOT more flavor.  I followed the recipe but cut them into smaller pieces as others have mentioned, and I also added some onion powder.  I'm definitely making them again!

I thought these were pretty good...a nice change for sweet potatoes.  I followed the recipe exactly, but I think the rosemary would be good too, as others have suggested.  Mine only took about 45 minutes to cook because I cut them into 1-1.5 inch cubes.  I also popped them under the broiler for a couple of minutes after baking to crisp them up.

Perfect side dish! Really limit the amount of olive oil so they come out crispy and not soggy.
So easy and delicious.

These were GREAT! I loved the taste the oregeno gave the sweet potatoes. It was a welcome change to the sugary sweet potatoes I have had in the past. I will be making these again and again and again! AMAZING!!!

This was delicious!  Followed recipie exactly, even though I am usually a garlic salt/onion powder girl when it comes to oven roasted potatos.  The sweet potato has enough flavor to make this wonderful without having to garlic it up like I do for regular potatos.  Will be making this again for sure!

I LOVED IT!  I found the potatoes hard to chop, but well worth it.  I don't think I will use as much oil next time.  2 tbsp was too much.  I liked the pieces that got a little crispier better.  I will make this recipes again and again.

Very good side dish.  One large potato will easily serve two people.  I just sliced two sweet potatoes into even slices and spiraled them around a round deep dish pie plate.  Tasty and savory dish.

Used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil.  Added garlic powder and rosemary to the seasonings.  Cooked it in an Airfryer.  The standard cooking time from Airfryer left them cooked but not crispy.  Increased time to 20 minutes on 2nd batch and that made them crispier and more to my liking.

My first time making sweet potato and it turned out wonderfully. I did as another reviewer said and cut into 1 inch cubes and added half a chopped white onion. It was done baking in just under 40 minutes. Paired with boxed couscous as a side and Appetizer Mussels for a main; you would have thought the BF had died and gone to foodie heaven.

I was looking for a way to cook sweet potatoes the same temp and time as a meatloaf, and this was just the ticket.  I only like the pale orange sweet potatoes, and I usually cut into them rounds and roast at a much higher temp.  So I cut these into chunks - about 1" rounds, then quartered - and I didn't peel them as there's so much fiber in the skins (plus it's a pain in the patootie).  I didn't think the oregano would go well with the meatloaf, so used a zesty no-salt  seasoning  (a lot like Grill Mates without the sodium).  Came out perfectly,  nicely browned and not mushy at all.   Would be great with a dollop of Greek yogurt (and for those of you missing a little sweetness, try  topping with maple sour cream).   Thanks for a great recipe!

I went by other reviews and cut the pieces about 1 inch and used Rosemary instead of Oregano. I also added 1 sautéed sliced onion. Only used 2 large sweet potatoes instead of 3 and cooked covered 20 min and uncovered 30 min. Came out perfect.

Made this and chopped them into small 1 in pieces. Put oregano on only half of the pan, the other half had only sea salt on it. Everyone liked these. Easy! Made 5 sweet potatoes the first time. I liked the ones with oregano a lot. I did not measure it out, just sprinkled it on. Also baked it at 400 and stirred it around a little during baking and put it on the jelly roll pan.

Baked Sweet Potatoes Haiku: "Cut pieces smaller. And added some rosemary. Taste great, but squishy." Not sure if we were expecting these to get crisp the way that oven roasted red potatoes do, but the flavor was so awesome, I was OK w/ them being on the smooshy side. Very nice to eat a sweet potato dish that wasn't bathed in honey, brown sugar, or marshmellows!

Really good. Husband followed recipe exactly. Next time I'd like to try one of the suggestions of using Cajun, basil or Italian seasoning instead of oregano & then decide which is our favorite.  Will make again.

I made this recipe as written but adjusted the servings for 2 and used 2 medium-size sweet potatoes. Overall, these were good but not great.  60 minutes of cooking left them a bit too soft and there was more oil than necessary.  The flavor was good.  I will make these again and add rosemary, as other reviewers have suggested.  Also, reduce the oil and cooking time.  I think with a few small changes these could be excellent.

Excellent in every way...although I did make a few critical changes.  First, I mixed sweet potatoes and yams, half and half.  I added a very coarsly-chopped sweet onion. Then I used rosemary as I had a bush outside and could get it really fresh (instead of the oregano).  Then I mixed in 1 hearty tsp. of cajun spice.  Actually, this sounds like a whole new recipe...but it was fabulous!

I made them as a side dish for some quesadillas, and I didn't think oregano would go with them. Here's what I did: I peeled and cut 1 really big sweet potato into about 1" pieces (harder than it sounds, btw!) and chopped half a red onion into like 1/2" pieces. I tossed those in olive oil in the pan (9"x11") like the recipe said to do. Then I sprinkled on garlic salt, onion powder, fresh ground pepper, and a generous amount of cumin and stirred it all together, then spread them out in a single layer. I baked them covered at 350°F for 20 minutes, then uncovered at 400°F for 20 minutes*. They were DELICIOUS, and the onions were like little candy bits! YUMMMM! I was kinda glad the hubby and kids (toddlers) were too stubborn to try them! More for me! I've made them 3x this week just to sit and eat! They're DEFINITELY better than sweet potato fries! :)  *Oh, and today, I set the timer, but didn't hear it and ended up baking them covered for the whole 40 minutes at 350°F. They were STILL delicious, just didn't have the crispiness you get when you bake them uncovered for half the time! :)

Have made similar dishes with sweet potatoes.  For those, like me, who aren't big fans of oregano, try sprinkling curry powder on.  I don't know what it is about it but it really enhances the flavor of the potatoes.

Made this Sunday, along with a pot roast/ in place of going out to eat. The whole family loved it and said they would rather have this meal than to go out to eat! ( Of coarse, I am probably going out to eat next Sunday ... Mommas need breaks too!)

Inirltially I was scared to try this but I'm so happy I did. I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and microwaved for 3 min prior to cutting, used rosemary and tossed before putting in baking dish. I baked for 45-50 min at 350, uncovered and mixed only once half way through.My husband loved it. Will make again and again.

Make these often sometimes putting them in foil on the bbq grill.  I have done it with changing up the spices too.  Yummy!

Just made this recipe as a side dish for the Roast Pork with Maple and Mustard Glaze (recipe on this site) and they were perfect. I wanted to make sweet potatoes without all that butter and brown sugar for a change and this was it. I followed the recipe to a tee except I not a fan of oregano so I used dried rosemary instead. I don't know how much of a difference it would have made, but these came out awesome. Definitely a keeper.

My husband is not a big fan of sweet potatoes but he really liked these!  Made recipe as described but did leave skins on and cut potatoes in smaller chunks...1 hour at 350.  Next time will try rosemary.

I was so sure these would be bland, but they were my favorite part of the meal! I do not care for oregano, so I didn't use it.  I cut them in bite size pieces, and since I was making a meat at the same time, I cooked them at 325* and they were definitely ready in 60 minutes.  I will be making this many more times!

These were delicious. My hubby and I both love potatoes, but needed a change. They did not get crispy or crunchy at all and I cooked them much longer than stated.  Next time I will try half the olive oil and see if that helps.

My husband is pretty picky and he kept saying, "These potatoes are so good!".  They are so simple and easy to make.  I didn't peel the potatoes but other than that, I followed the recipe and it was a big hit.

I modified this recipe a little bit. Instead of oregano i used paprika. It turned out very good. I baked it for 1 hour 10 minutes. One hour uncovered and 10 minutes covered with a foil paper.

I made the recipe, but increased the oven temp to 375 (doesn't seem like I ever have enough time after work to get dinner on the table at a reasonable time). This change decreased cooking time by about 20 minutes. Potatoes were wonderful!! I was a little skeptical about the dried oregano, but it works. Thanks for the recipe.

I really enjoyed this.  It's a really nice change from the usual sugared sweet potato dishes.  I have tried it with both oregano and rosemary.  I prefer the oregano best.  Thank you for the super recipe!

These sweet potatoes were so good and easy to make. I was planning on just baking the sweet potatoes with butter and brown sugar but something made me look at this recipe and I was pleasantly suprised.  It made a great vegetable dish and healthy also!

Easy recipe!!  I originally was going to make the sweet potatoes with sugar, heavy cream, eggs, etc..., than I said "wait a minute, it's the New Year 2013....time to eat healthy!!  I found this recipe and the entire family including hubby and kids ate up!" Thank you!! P.S. I also cut them into smaller pieces, put rosemary and a little garlic powder/salt on...wonderful wonderful.

The first time I made this I put too much oregano in the potatos and didn't like the taste. However, my boyfriend requested these again tonight for dinner. The second time around was spectacular. I added two cloves of minced garlic and followed the rest of the recipe. This is now a mainstay in our home.

Fantastic! I had a couple of cups of butternut squash hanging around so threw it in with one large sweet potato. Both cut into the same 1 1/2"  cubes. Used oregano. We LOVED it.   It is so nice to have a savory sweet potato dish. This is a great side dish for any meal. Beef, chicken, fish... Whatever. Sweet potato is such a power food and we try to eat it as often as we can. Next time I will double the recipe and use half in a low-fat sweet potato/squash roasted soup. Perfect for fall/winter.

This recipe was very good, I was surprised to say the least.  I am used to sweet potatoes smothered in brown sugar and butter.  I wanted to try a healthier sweet potatoe recipe and this is a keeper.  I did make some changes as other views have.  I used Rosemary in place of the oregano.  I sprayed the pan with Pam cooking spray, placed chopped onions on the bottom along with 3 cloves of fresh crushed garlic.  I chopped the sweet potatoes about 1/2 in thick placed in a bowl drizzled olive oil, salt & pepper, and rosemary and mixed well.  I than laid the sweet potato mixture on top of onions and garlic.  I baked at 400 degree covered for about 40 minutes, stirred, and baked additional 20 minutes uncovered.

Tasty and nutritious. I used 1 large sweet potato and chopped it into pretty small chunks. After tossing in oil, I just shook some pepper and salt and oregano over the top. I cooked for about 25 minutes at about 425 (so I could cook them at the same time as my pork chops). I stirred them up every 10 minutes to make sure they cooked evenly. They could have used more of the spices, but now I know for next time :)

I used this recipe with a yam. It was easy to make and delicious! I think next time I'll try with both a sweet potato and a yam at the same time.

Easy recipe. Easy satisfaction with how sweet potatoes taste. Was reluctant in seeing oregano as ingredient, but don't hesitate to try this different twist on this vegetable.

This is the first review I have ever written and trust me, I am NOT a good cook! i struggle with even the simplest of recipes :(   THIS IS DELICIOUS!  I made it just as stated, except cutting them potatoes fairly small (as I have two young toddlers) and I needed them to cook faster.  Super delicious and so healthy!!!!!!

I made this recipe as written except for subbing rosemary for oregano as others suggested and adding 1/2 of a med. sweet onion thinly sliced. I thought it was a simple and delicious side dish that I will make again.

very good! would make again and again! the only things I did different, were that I only used 2 large sweet potatoes (plenty for us with enough for leftovers as well!) and added some rosemary with the oregano. very savory and a nice change of pace from classic candied-style sweet potatoes. : )

Loved this!  I tossed the potatoes to coat with oil as per recipe but then re-tossed after I added herbs & seasoning to distribute the flavor better.  I will definitely make these again!

We added 1/2 medium chopped onion about a clove of minced garlic and some crushed rosemary in addition to the ingredients in the printed recipe.  This recipe was suprisingly delicious and will be added to our regular rotation.  The only downside is that it takes an hour in the oven so it's not a quick side dish.

Sorry to say but I wasn't impressed with this recipe.  I love sweet potatoes and actually like them plain so I thought I would like this because it was just a couple of ingredients.  They were just okay and I wouldn't make again.

I follwed the recipe and tried these about 15 minutes before they were done, was not overly impressed.  It may just be that I'm used to my sweet potatoes being "sweet".   So I added about 1.5 T of brown sugar, for 4 large potatoes, and they turned out very good.  I took one reviewer's advice & turned the oven up to 450 for the last 10 min, but it did not make them crisp.  I will still make these again with the addition of the brown sugar.

This was a great healther way of making sweet potatoes versus the casseroles with brown sugar.  I didn't have enough sweet potatoes for the recipe so I used two sweet potatoes and one regular potato.  Also added a little garlic powder and seasoned salt.

I was very skeptical of this recipe since I was brought up on sugar and buttery sweet potatoes but I loved these! I used olive oil, salt/pepper, paprika, and sliced onion. I didn't have any oregano but they were wonderfully tasted! The onions were crunchy and the potatoes soft although I will add a hint of brown sugar next time. I will be making these for years to come. :)

LOVED this recipe; I've been looking for a way to incorporate sweet potatoes in my diet without making the syrupy sweet version usually seen (I HATE sweet vegetable dishes!).  I will try other spices but I liked the oregano.  THANKS!!!

The kids didn't really like and husband and I thought they were OK. I didn't really like the consistency, they were pretty soft, like I should have mashed them or something. Don't think I'll make again but worth trying.

Loved this recipe!  I think the only thing that would make it better would be if the potatoes were really crispy on the outside.  Maybe next time I will try coating them in flour first!

I'd never had sweet potatoes before and at first I didn't really like this recipe.  My husband and I actually talked about omitting the ogregano next time.  But the flavor grew on me and I think the next time I'll keep the oregano.

Very good!  To be different (and so my son would eat it) I added a couple of russet potatoes as well (the sweet potatoes were far better, though).  I crushed a few cloves of garlic, cut way back on the salt due to dietary restrictions, and added Mrs. Dash.  They turned out very nicely, and we'll do this again.  Thanks for the recipe!

I didn't like this (but our family is not fond of sweet potatoes).  I cut mine potatoes into smaller pieces to cut back on the cooking time.  Too much olive oil.

I agree with the second review in that I mixed everything in a bowl first and everything had much more flavor. I dont turn them over - I love when they get a tiny bit crispy on one side. I do love the oregano flavor however - I didn't skimp on that one!

Tasty taters!  While the seasoning was just fine, I'll experiment with it a bit to find something that suits my taste a little more.  Perhaps some cumin or cinnamon instead of the oregano.  A good recipe to start with for a savory potato.  Thanks!

This is a really good recipe for those that are slightly standoffish about trying sweet potatos.  My family eat regular potatos like they are going out of style, and we are trying to make the switch to sweet potatos since they are better for you.  I didn't want a recipe with a ton of sweet stuff in it like marshmallows...that's not the point of eating better.  This just fit the bill for us!  I gave 4 stars because I think I could tweak the basic recipe to fit our taste a little better.

A fabulous and refreshing change of pace from the typical candied sweet potatoes. I nearly doubled the oil and spices for more flavorful potatoes and baked on 375. We loved these!

I really like this recipe. I didn't measure anything, just threw it all together.  Very simple and healthy, yet very enjoyable and impressive.  I served them on the side of curry vegetables and brown rice.

It was a nice change to the regular sweet potatoes with marshmallows--very different!  I used rosemary instead of oregano.  They turned out fine, but I'll have to try the oregano or another mixture next time to see if they turn out better.

Finally a HEALTHY recipe for sweet potatoes.  We are trying to eat healthier and I've looked at dozens of recipes that add sugar, syrup, honey, marsmellows, etc.  I just want a nice easy to prepare savoury dish ad we really liked these.

These are just coming out of the oven...and I had to sneak one!  They are delicious.  I used Season Salt, Paprika and Basil.  I did not have olive oil - used vegetable oil - worked just fine.  I also cute into mid-size chunks.  This is a easy recipe and you don't miss the gunky sweet stuff at all!

Good and different for sweet potatoes.  I cut mine too thin (like scalloped potatoes) and they were a little over done.  Took another reader's advice and made them with rosemary instead of oregano.  I will definately make them again -- but cut into cubes, like hash browns, or wedges like fries.

This was very good and easy.  I lay them under a 6 lb chicken and roasted them together.  They were fine though the they had to cook 2 hours. I sprinkled them with rosemary instead of oregano since thats what I was using in the chicken.   I didnt like the slight sweet potato taste in the gravy.  I think I would do them again like this.

I cooked mine about 20 minutes longer to crisp up some of the potatoes.   And who knew that oregano went with sweet potatoes?

Great recipe for a healthy side dish. My daughter asked to have this again and will plan to pack it in her lunch for Highschool.

I followed the recipe but only used one large potato for the 2 of us...big mistake, we were fighting for the last bite.  Next time I will bake 2 large sweet potatoes.  Excellent recipe.  My fiancé already said he wants this again soon.  Thank you for a great side!

No changes because the first time I make a recipe I follow it as it is presented.  I will make it again for sure and add a little more oregano.  For me  having struggled with liking sweet potatoes it is  a gift.

Absolutely delicious sweet potato recipe.  I roasted them on a prepared baking sheet and turned them over half way through to crisp them.  Just before serving, I squeezed a few drops of fresh lemon juice over them. Everyone was amazed at how much subtle flavor the lemon juice added.

Made as outlined, but did add a small onion, cut in chunks.
I had white skinned, white pulp sweet potatoes I needed to use. 
I did use a plastic bag to coat the potatoes and onion, but ensured I only used the "pinch" of spices suggested. Oops! I did use seasoned salt, but added regular salt after baking (I like salt, no excuses).
I was surprised and delighted by how great this turned out.
Scrambled some eggs, wrapped it all in tortillas, and never looked back. Yum!

I don't even like sweet potatoes unless they have brown sugar and butter on them. This recipe changed my mind. Easy and very tasty.  Followed the recipe exactly.  No more brown sugar. Thanks for sharing it. Will definitely make again.

The recipe was very vague, from the size to cut the potatoes to how to arrange them in a casserole (layered  or single), to how much seasoning.  I put them in a casserole dish and they were slightly layered.  I tossed the potatoes throughout the hour and ended up still having to microwave them to get them done.  I put them back in the oven to see if they would slightly crisp (which they didn't).  They had brown marks that weren't there when I cut them up (perhaps from the oregano?).  They were pretty bland and a real disappointment!!  I would not make them again!

These were a wonderful addition to Thanksgiving and super easy to prepare.  I cut the sweet potatoes into about 1' chunks (or a little bigger)  and added fresh chopped rosemary and thyme to the potatoes, along with the salt and pepper.  After the turkey was out, I popped these potatoes in, turned the oven up to 400', and they were done in about 30 minutes.

Trying what this reviewer suggested: "I cut the potatoes into smaller pieces, about an inch. They only took about 40 minutes to cook. I was out of oregano, so I just stuck with the olive oil, salt and pepper, but I added 2 garlic cloves (crushed), and half of a yellow onion, diced."

I agree wholeheartedly with the others who said they were delighted to find a sweet potato recipe that did not require cinnamon!  My husband and I LOVED these!  And they were so quick and easy to prepare.  I did, like others, cut the pieces smaller (about an inch and a half), and shaved a few minutes off the baking time.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe.  SUPERB side dish!

Nice flavor, came out nice & soft, but dry on the outsides.  I will flip a couple of times during cooking to keep the oil fresh and the outsides moist.

Really good recipe.  We used rosemary rather than oregano, and felt it did need to be tossed with a little butter before serving.

This was a hit!  I made them to go with a pork loin roast and it was a great combination.  Also very easy to make.  Delicious.

Every one at the table loved this! We often eat sweet potatoes in”the skins” but this was just easier!

So refreshing to finally have a sweet potato recipe that isn't sweet! I love to bake sweet potatoes on a regular basis but I always find that my family wants them sweetened in some way. These came out perfectly seasoned. I did not have to change anything in the recipe and they actually enjoyed them. I did add an extra teaspoon of olive oil to coat the potatoes because I did not have any medium-sized sweet potatoes on hand. All of mine were super huge, so I had to accommodate the oil measurements to make sure they were coated well. Great recipe! We will definitely be making this one again!

It was good, didn’t amaze me. I’ve always felt sweet potatoes weren’t the best. I think I’d prefer more taste to mine that just salt and pepper.

This really pleasantly surprised me! I recently changed to a vegetarian diet/lifestyle. This was the very first recipe that I cooked myself as opposed to buying pre-made. This was so easy and turned out DELICIOUS. The herbs made it just right. I also used a Rosemary/Garlic infused olive oil...delicious!

I didn’t care for the oregano and I don’t particularly like Rosemary as others have suggested...sweet potatoes are pretty tasty on their own, next time I’ll just do the punches of salt and pepper.  Overall came out wonderfully and I had 4 kids all eating it and happy about eating something healthy!

These were delicious! My 15 year old daughter cooked us dinner and included these sweet potatoes. They were perfect! She cut them a little smaller so they cook faster.

I've never liked sweet potatoes because the only time I've ever tried them was when they were prepared with brown sugar, syrup, etc. Just not a big fan of sweet dishes.  But these were surprisingly good!  Based on other reviewers, I cut into smaller 1" pieces, used ground Rosemary (personal preference), and covered for the first 30 min, uncovered for the last 20 min and were cooked perfectly!  Will definitely make these again when I want a change from my favorite regular potato. Thanks for the great recipe!

I made these to go with an apple spiced pork dish. Instead of oregano I used cinnamon and garlic powder. This is the best way to get perfectly cooked sweet potatoes every time! Thanks so much!!!

I made it with basil and thyme instead of oregano.  I tried it raw first and it was delicious.  Great change other than candied or a baked potato.

Excellent. Came out great. You must cut the potatoes about a half inch or smaller for them to be totally soft, but they are delicious. I never knew oregano would make them so good!!

Yum! I used a little more salt and these turned out amazing. I didn't have enough time to bake, so I used my potato peeler to peel and cut up into inch size pieces. I boiled for a few minutes until tender and then cooked them in a skillet with olive oil and all the seasonings until they browned really well.

I am altering my first review.  I made this recipe again and followed another reviewers suggestion.  I cut the potato pieces smaller and upped the salt and pepper.  Also subbed rosemary and thyme for oregano and they turned out great.  I will be making these again.

Easy peasy. I put the potatoes and seasoning in a Ziploc bag and shook it up for even coating. These tasted great. I'll be making this again.

Prepped this last night and cooked it today and it was very tasty. Even my husband, who isn't that fond of sweet potatoes said he'd like to have this dish again.

Made these with fresh sweet potatoes from the garden. Amazing! Cut them small and baked at 350 for about 40 minutes.

Simple and savory side dish. I think more than just a pinch is needed for the seasonings. I just eyeballed it when adding the seasoning and was pleased with this dish. I would make this dish again without a second thought. Served along with chicken and brown rice.

I used 2 large sweet potatoes plus one medium and one small.  Aside from the hassle of peeling and dicing the sweet potatoes (which are harder than regular potatoes), this was pretty easy to make.  I used sesame oil in place of olive oil.  I covered the pan tightly with foil.  After an hour, the potatoes were very tender.  I like sweet potatoes and will often bake them whole and then put butter and a little pepper on them--pretty simple.  Yet, this particular recipe seemed lacking in flavor.  I think quartered onions would make a nice addition and perhaps drizzle a little maple syrup over the potatoes as that seems to pair well with sweet potatoes.

Who knew sweet potatoes and no brown sugar these were awesome I made them exactly like the recipe I cut the potatoes up smaller just so they would get done quicker because I was in a rush and they were delicious.  I tried the rosemary one potato I didn't care for that so I'm going to stick with the   Oregano or Italian seasoning   Thanks

Sooooo yummy!  I did add garlic powder, onion powder and onion soup mix.  I did microwave for a few minutes to make easier to peel and chop.  Be careful though; you don't want them to cook to much.

These were a nice change from sweet with marshmellows.  Simple.  I cooked my sweet potatoes for 45 minutes and let them cool a little.  I cut them into big cubes and used  rosemary.

I made this for Christmas dinner, so I had to increase the ingredients to serve 12. I did make a few changes. I did not peel the sweet potatoes and cut into smaller size like others. I mixed the spices with the oil in a small bowl, and also used  half oregano and half rosemary. I put  some of this  mixture in button of glass dish and put sweet potatoes in the bowl to coat them. I covered with aluminum foil and baked at 375° for an hour. Taste great!

Won't use so much of the oregano (or any) next time, but overall a good side. I paired it with  Lemon Piccata Chicken (http://allrecipes.com/recipe/214488/lemon-chicken-piccata/)

Made this for thanksgiving and it was very well received. I used the rosemary and a bit more olive oil than the recipe called for.  Cooking time was also a little bit longer than advertised but that may have been my oven.

I added a little Rosemary and after 45 minutes it was still a little tough so I put it in a pot with 2 tbsp. of butter. After it was done I added 1/4 cup sugar. I did use 3 pounds of sweet potato. It tasted great!

Holy Cow!  Tasty as all get out! Took reviewers advice. One inch cubes. Rather than oregano, sprinkled liberally with Herbes de Provence.   Great base recipe to try different herbs.  Next time I'll try the rosemary, or curry powder, who knows.  Why folks only consider adding sugary stuff to already sweet, sweet potatoes, I don't know.  The sweet potato is a nutritious powerhouse and this recipe is a "must try"!  Also, there is absolutely NO need to cover the pan while cooking!

My family loved this recipe, except for my 6 yr old who doesn't like sweet potatoes fixed any way. It's very easy to make! I added minced garlic and used less oregano after reading the reviews.

These were ok. Not bad ,not good or great just ok. Ended up sprinkling some cinnamon sugar on them after the initial taste test and it made it a little better. Most likely will not make again.

You'll think I'm crazy. I was in a hurry so took a whole sweet potato in its skin, scrubbed it, poked it with a fork, cut off the stringy ends, brushed on a little olive oil, then cooked it in a microwave in a closed glass bowl for about four minutes until done. Then I sliced it into half-inch wedges, spread them to look nice on a plate, drizzled on the oil and shook on the oregano and black pepper (I'm sure more than the recipe called for, but I love spices), and I left off the salt.

Oh, MY!!!! In FIVE minutes I had the most delicious sweet potato! And it kept my summer kitchen cool! Can't wait to try it baked as described, but for a quick side dish, THIS WAS AWESOME!! (I've never liked those sticky sickly sweet potato recipes.)

I use this recipe and add McCormicks Grill Mates Spice to it - it's AWESOME! Probably too much sodium but it is delicious!  I also use it with half red potatoes and half sweet potatoes.

A welcome alternative to too sweet recipes! My  family also enjoys it with a pinch of Allspice.
Since my hands are arthritic and makes it hard to cut-i parboil the potatoes to allow for easier cutting.

This is a delicious way to eat sweet potatoes. My kids were surprised to find out that no sugar was added. We used Italian seasoning.

My husband doesn't love sweet potatoes, but this got a thumbs up. To speed it up, I put the sweet potatoes in the microwave for 90 seconds & oven for 30 minutes.

Really enjoyed these potatoes.  I did decide the seasoning sounded a bit bland for my family and bumped them up a bit and for that reason am only giving it a 4 star.  I added some basil and rosemary and a bit extra salt and pepper.

Delicious is all I can say about this baked sweet potatoes, and without all the sugar, cream, butter, and marshmallows in it.  I now share this recipe with all my family for their own holiday meals. I am preparing this recipe for our Thanksgiving and Christmas family dinners this year. My family loves this recipe when I prepare it! That is all I can say!!!!   HJL+

Healthy and easy. I make these all the time. Lovely! If you don't want to have to turn them, Combine al ingredients in a plastic bag, then use a (sprayed with cooking spray) rack in your pan. These are also good with rosemary and garlic or with pumpkin pie seasoning.

These sweet potatoes turned out absolutely delicious, I am very please with the recipe!  I followed the recipe exactly, scaling the portion in half to serve only two people.  I think because of that, or maybe my potatoes were cut smaller, it took less baking time - more like 40 - 45 minutes for me.  I didn't alter any spices or the olive oil, and it tasted so simple, healthy and wonderful.  I will be putting this recipe into my dinner rotation for sure, thank you!!!

This straightforward but delicious recipe was perfect for our house guests!  They loved it.  I admittedly took some liberty and added some onions to the mix but once it came out it was PERFECT!  Paired wonderfully with the (http://allrecipes.com/recipe/oven-barbecued-beef-brisket-ii/detail.aspx)  Well done!

I mixed white potatoes & sweet potatoes cut into small pieces.  I also added quartered onions, bell peppers cut in medium size pieces, & whole cloves of garlic.  I mixed everything in a bowl with a bit of olive oil, a rosemary & garlic spice blend, fresh ground black pepper, & a bit of salt.  I roasted everything for about 35 minutes, turning occasionally.  The end result was delicious served with baked tilapia, sautéed spinach & onions, and fresh garden tomatoes, garlic, & basil.  Yum!

I used avocado oil (it handles the heat much better than olive oil) but otherwise followed the recipe. It was well-received by family & guests alike! I told everyone what was in it but they were convinced there was a "secret ingredient" - guesses ranged from various spices to parmesan cheese!  (Weird, right??). But it had rave reviews. :)

I had two large sweet potatoes I was going to cook a different way. After boiling them for about 15min I realized I was too hungry to go with the original plan. Then I found this recipe. Instead of baking them I diced half of one then put it in 1 of those Ziploc zip & steam bags. I added about a teaspoon of water then the salt, pepper, &oregano (just eye balled it didn't measure). Put it in the microwave for a few minutes & it was ready to go. Quickest side dish & it tasted AMAZING. Served with green beans & maple glazed salmon that recipe is on this site as well. Who knew healthy eating could taste so good!

I tried this recipe to add last minute next to a turkey during a family dinner. I also added one medium sized, chopped onion, 2  cloves of minced  garlic and cut the potatoes into stew sized chunks. Various ovens differ in cooking times so I raised the degree to 375 and covered the baking dish with foil, for 45 minutes,  removing it the last 5 minutes to brown the top slightly. The oregano added an earthy flavor to the potatoes which I liked and my family enjoyed the variation too.

This is an easy way to make sweet potatoes and yams. Being the lazy creature I am I didn't peel the potatoes; just scrubbed them good and sliced them in even rounds. Then I dumped them in a plastic bag, added olive oil, and shook. My friends rolled their eyes at the oregano so I just used really good coarse salt and fresh ground pepper.

I made this and it turned out soooo good! I was very impressed with myself. It cooked in 30 minutes so I am glad I checked it. It may be because I had smaller chunks. But this is really good. I also added Mrs. Dash

This was good, but I was not crazy about the oregano.  I will definitely try it with rosemary next time as suggested by other reviewers.  My 5 year old twins did not like it... which surprised me, because they have always liked sweet potatoes no matter what way I've prepared them.

My family LOVES these potatoes!!! I made a couple of small changes, I was also warming a spiral ham at 325, so I put them in with the ham at the lower temp for a half hour. When I took the ham out I boosted the temp to 475, sprinkled some seasoned salt on top, gave them a stir and put them back in for 8 to 10 minutes to brown them up. I also, on the advice of many other reviews, used rosemary instead of oregano, and yams instead of sweet potatoes, just because they were what I already had. We could not stop eating them, and I'm sure in meals to come I will never have these as left overs.

These were good but not great. Just kind of plain.  Made as stated but will likely not make again.

Delicious - the sweet potatoes came out just the right texture and the sweet taste of the potato mixed with the oregano was a nice combination.

This is a keeper!! I did as others suggested and cut into smaller pieces - about an inch. I also put all the ingredients in a large plastic bag, shook it up to coat everything, then put on a foil lined pan (sprayed with PAM) then in the oven. DELISH!!

I made these for our Thanksgiving dinner. I omitted the oregano because it didn't go with other flavors in our meal. I added onion and garlic as other viewers noted, the were good, but I didn't find them exceptional. I think I will try adding some sugar next time to try to bring the sweet potato flavor out more.

Really good!  Wash the potatoes well and there's no reason to peel.  With smaller sweet potatoes , rub them with oil, salt, and pepper and cook them whole on the grill.  Yum.

Easy and tasty recipe. I cut my sweet potaotes into wedges, coated them as instructed, and wrapped them in foil for an hour. Came out perfectly! Can't wait to finish eating this batch and make a new batch soon!

Loved this!  Would have liked them to be a little crispier on the outside, but great anyway!  Seems even like a great way to have sweet potatoes at Thanksgiving as an alternative to the high-calorie ones we usually serve.

These were AMAZING. I made them exactly as the recipe is written and am so happy that I have a new option for making sweet potatoes. They almost taste like sweet potato fries, but in wedges! Thanks for the amazing recipe!

These are fantastic!  I've never had success with sweet potato fries and didn't hold out much hope foro these, but they turned out tasty, soft on the inside with a bit of crunch on the outside.

These were a nice change from white potatoes.  I was looking for a recipe that didn't include marshmallows since sweet potatoes are sweet enough!  And also wanted something that wasn't drowning in soup like some of the other dishes on my in-law's table yesterday.  I added some onion and crushed garlic and thought that added some nice flavor.  Would make again.  Thanks!

All of my family loved these and I got a lot of compliments. I thought they were alright; needed more salt and maybe not oregano? I don't know. Not my favorite and probably won't make again unless asked.

Nice, subdued way to make sweet potatoes. Like other reviewers, I cubed my potatoes smaller. I do like the oregano, and so did my boyfriend, who usually thinks sweet potatoes are too sweet.

I was looking for something different (everyone else wanted twice baked potatoes) to go along with ribs (cooking out) and found this...it turned out great!  I did cube the potatoes smaller and add another pinch of oregano...Thanks!  I really enjoyed this recipe.

I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe. As another reviewer suggested, I cut back on the amount of oregano and upped the salt. I thought the oregano complemented the sweet potatoes in a subtle way. I'd definitely make these again, maybe next time cutting up an onion and throwing in in with the potatoes.

I make red potatoes just like this, except use a different herb than oregano.  I'm going to stick with the red potatoes, because while this was good, it wasn't as good as it is with the red potatoes.  We love sweet potatoes, but this wasn't our favorite.  Thanks anyways!

Maybe I am too used to the standard sweet potato taste, but I didn't think the oregano went with it at all.  It was quite easy to make though, and I even managed to get my two year old to try it.  Even with those benefits, I wouldn't make it again.  I'll stick to my marshmallow covered pound-packing potato!

Kind of flat tasting, in my opinion.  Will just bake them next time, and eat with butter.

Simply awesome! I tried it one time with oregano and one time with rosemary.. Both are great, but I have a slight preference for the fresh rosemary.

Everyone LOVED this when I made it a few years back.  I don't like the super sugary syrupy sweet potatoes.  I'm making them again this year.

i thought this was pretty good, but i agreed with some other reviews that oregano probably did not go best with sweet potatoes.  at another suggestion of another reviewer i diced my own onion, substituted the second time with seasoned salt and threw it all in with the diced potatoes, and it was excellent.

I'm not a big lover of sweet potatoes, but these were really good. I cubed the potatoes a little smaller placed them in a plastic bag with the oil and seasonings. I shook them and then let them stand for a bit.  I cooked them a little longer for crispiness.  The flavors were great together.  This is a keeper!

So pleasantly surprised by how tasty this was, coupled with it's ease.  An easy 5 stars.  The only thing I did differently was add the finest dusting of garlic powder in addition to the oregeno, salt and pepper.  Will be making this many more times in the future!

These were good but nothing special or over the top.  I made it to go along with thanksgiving dinner and we had mashed idaho pototes as well and I thought these sweet potatoes tasted good, but nothing to write home about.  My 9 month old liked them mashed up.

This was a very yummy dish. I followed the recipe and added maple syrup and cinnamon to it. It does take a while to cook so I would prepare this dish first in order to eat in a timely manner but it is a very easy dish to make.

This is quick, easy, and yummy.  I, too, used the rosemary (I didn't have any oregano), and I didn't know sweet potatoes could be this good without brown sugar and marshmallows. Thanks for a great recipe!

I used the basil/paprika combination as the oregano didn't sound as if it would work. This recipe was okay. Not outstanding in my opinion but nice all the same.
