This turned out pretty good. It was a little thin but did thicken upon refrigeration. I am not able to find  soppressata ham in my area so instead I served the dip in baked hard salami cups. That went over well and would be a big hit for a Super Bowl party. It was the perfect finger food. Next time I'll add some crushed chili flakes for some heat but overall this is good as written.
