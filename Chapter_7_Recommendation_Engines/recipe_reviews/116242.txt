I have made this soup successfully several times and here are my suggestions: -always use sage sausage -don't peel potatoes for rustic look/feel -half the amount of potatoes (add to your preference) -add potato flakes to thicken and cut simmering time -be generous with the majoram (powder also works) Good Luck!

I just joined this site today and I just finished cooking the sausage corn chower. Instead of using pork sasage, I used smoked beef sausage and this dish is delicious. In the future I will be vistiting this site often and I will be sure to tell my friends about it.

I thought this was very good.  i used an entire bag of frozen corn, no cream-style corn, chicken broth instead of water and rice milk for the evaporated milk, DH is lactose intolerant.  it came out very well.

Delicious and very easy to make!  I did have a few issues during preparation, but it still turned out great!  One problem was that after I cooked the sausage and added the potatoes, the 2 cups of water as called for didn't cover the potatoes, so I had to add more water...2 more cups.  I also forgot to drain the meat, so it's probably good that I had more water to spread the fat out.  Next time I may consider cooking the potatoes in a separate pot so that I don't have to add all the extra water.  Also instead of adding potato flakes as some reviewers recommend, I simply removed some of the potatoes with a slotted spoon and mashed them up to give the soup a creamier texture.  The great thing about this soup is that is still tastes great even if you don't make it just like the recipe says!

For once I actually made a recipe as it calls for, and it was worth it!  The sausage meat was really good in it- I used hot Italian ground pork and it gave a nice little kick.  The potatoes softened up just enough at the end to thicken the chowder perfectly while keeping their firmness.  My only complaint was it didn't have enough corn, but I used two corncobs rather than a can, so I'd assume the can had more kernals.  Delicious comfort food!

This chowder was absolutely delicious.  I didn't have to change a thing.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a hearty chowder to impress and satisfy.

We love this Chowder! I had sage sausage on hand and I think it gave it more flavor. I did use 1 tsp of marjoram, just preference, and a little more black pepper. Very good!

Good!  I would step up the seasonings a bit though.  I'm going to make this again next week with "home-made" sausage from the local Mexican market for some new flavors.  Staple.

WOW!!!  This was really good!!  I used Jimmy Dean hot pork sausage, red potatoes with skins on, and I added 2 cloves of minced garlic which I sauteed with the sausage and onions.  I rarely write reviews, but this one deserved a good review!!

I made 1 1/2 of this recipe for a group of friends. It was a huge hit! I would definitely make it again. Next time, I will use low fat pork sausage. I used full fat sausage and it was really really greasy.

Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum!  My husband loved it!  I accidentally used sweetened condensed milk instead of evaporated milk the second time I made it, and it still came out really good.  I thought it was just a tad too sweet, but everybody else thought it was great!

Love this soup!!  Easy to make too.  I have also made it with cooked bratwurst and it was really good.  Next time I try it I'm going to use turkey sausage.

Excellent soup...I followed the recipe except that I used frozen corn in place of the whole kernel corn!  It was so easy to prepare and tasted wonderful.

I generally double this recipe. I use frozen diced breakfast potatoes with the pepers and onions in it. I substitue dried onion flakes for the whole onion. Its fantastic with shreaded cheese on top. Sharp white cheddar and colby jack are my two favorites on this dish, and I like to use both if I can. I use oregano, marjoram, and garlic salt.  I've made this dish so many times, I can do it from memory and don't use exact measurements. I've gotten many compliments on this dish. I take it to potlucks frequently. it's my go-to dish. my kids love it!

I love this chowder! I think the only things I did differently was I used ground turkey bulk sausage and I had a surplus of fresh corn so I used that instead (making sure to get all the yummy milk from the cob).  Super easy, super yummy. Thanks for the great recipe.

This is delicious and filling on a cold day.  I like it best made with a sagey sausage and fresh silver queen corn (I use 9 ears: 6 whole kernal, 3 pureed with a little milk).

Lots of flavor, came together quickly and was very filling.  This makes it a perfect weeknight dinner in our book!  Its several years after my first review and I am back to say that this is STILL a favorite in our home!  Everyone loves it and the kids can make it themselves now! - We just tried it using bratwurst sausage and it is amazing!  I love playing with this recipe!

This has become a staple meal at our house.  I use cut up turkey sausage and fat-free evaporated milk in an attempt to make it lower fat.  I don't have any marjoram, so I use a few other spices - oregano, thyme, whatever is handy.  Kids love it and we have good leftovers for a few days!

This chowder ROCKS. I've made it three times in the past few weeks. A few tips: I used turkey sausage and substituted organic chicken broth for the water. I also stir in about 3/4 cup of half & half and 3/4 cup of grated cheddar cheese before serving. It's a meal in a bowl.

I made this for supper tonight and it was a hit. I made two changes: 1) I used 3 cups of 2% milk in place of the water and evaporated milk and 2) instead of raw potatoes; I used steam and mash potatoes that I microwaved on high for almost 12 minutes until they were fully cooked and then added them to the soup. This step really cuts down on prep work/cook time. With those two changes this soup was delectable and satisfying and will be made again. Thanks for sharing Sue.

This was very good and super easy! I used chicken broth instead of the water. Also, I didn't have marjoram, so I subbed italian seasoning. I felt it was a little thin in the end, so I just added a cornstarch slurry to thicken it up. This soup had great flavor, and I will definately be making it again! Thanks for sharing. :)

This is the best and easiest Sausage Corn Chowder recipe. I just made it last weekend and have been asked to do it again, this weekend!  Great with corn muffins on a cold winter day!

Very delicious.  I use less potatoes and sometimes I add an additional can of cream corn.  Italian Sausage is also great in this soup.

My grandma just passed away and this was one of my favorite things she would make. Looking at the ingredients, this was the closest one to what hers was and IT TURNED OUT PERFECT! So delicious!

Holy Yummy Soup, Batman! Very hearty and filling, easy to make (my husband even "helped"). I did have to add 1 cup of water to cover the potatos, but it cooked down after a minute or two uncovered. Will definitely make this one again!

We really enjoyed this recipe. It was great that I had everything on hand. The only thing I did different is I had venison sausage and used it. It is only me and my husband so needless to say I had plenty leftover.

I cooked this recipe for a party and everyone really enjoyed it.  The only changes I made were to use "hot" sausage and I did not include the marjoram because I couldn't find any at my local store.  Enjoy!

Super fast and easy. Threw in a 12 oz. bag of frozen corn during boil then simmered. Was out of evaporated milk, so just used regular milk and added a Tbs. cornstarch to thicken. Really good.

This is a great,easy recipe. My picky son loved it with grated sharp cheddar sprinkled on top(added a little sour cream on top of the chees for me). Use spicy sausage for a little more flavor.

I don't normally make chowder but figured I would take the plunge with this one.  Loved it!
I used vegetable broth rather than water and added some chopped red and green bell pepper. Like others, I added potato flakes to thicken.  Served it with a baby green and onion salad with ranch dressing and topped the chowder with sharp cheddar to serve. 
Definitely a keeper! Thanks

This Chowder was wonderful.  I was exactly what I was looking for.  My husband loves potato soup, but likes meat with his meals and the additional of the sausage and corn makes it an entire meal. I used fresh corn since that was what I was trying to use up. I had added more water since my potatoes were not covered completely so to make it a bit thicker I add 3/4 cup of potato flakes and it was perfect.

Average recipe, I like my chowder thicker and with more spices/flavor.  Might add cornstarch or potato flakes and some more spices.

Easy, delicious and quick. I halfed the rec and used whole can of creamed corn and no whole kernel corn(did not want to have 2 cans half way used in fridge). I like my chowder thick so I also added 1 Tbsp cornstarch. Wonderful.
