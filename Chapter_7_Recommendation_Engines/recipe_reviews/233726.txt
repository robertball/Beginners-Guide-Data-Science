Had this last nite with Lasagna. Very filling yet light. I thought this would taste like ice but it didn't! The strawberry's are creamy but not heavy. I would defiantly eat this as a summer refresher. : )

Very refreshing and yummy! This is a great way to use an abundance of strawberries from our garden patch. Very simple recipe but make sure you leave enough time for the freezing and stirring. I make mine in the morning and it is ready to devour in the summer evenings . Make sure you don't omit the balsamic vinegar. It adds brightness to the dish.

I took this as a technique rather than a strict recipe. I didn't have 2# of strawberries but had a seedless watermelon and fresh mint and limes on my deck so that  was what I used. I did put in some salt and some white balsamic. It was excellent! Will try with various other fruits.

It was a delicious and refreshing treat that is just perfect for a sweet tooth craving. It helps satisfy that sweet tooth without all the sugar! Absolutely Marvelous! I hope everyone has a fun time making it as well! :)

I made this last summer( a little late in my review) and my kids came to spend the night with my grand children. The weather was so hot and this was so refreshing! They told me not to bother buying popsicles any more!

It was a little sweet but it tasted good. I told my daughter it was like a snow cone so it seemed like a fun summer treat to her.

I made this with frozen strawberries in my Nutramax blender and it came out creamy and delicious. Perfect for my lactose intolerant son and relatively healthy for the rest of us.

Awesome!  Turned out just like he said. Only difference is it took much longer to freeze bc I have a small overcrowded freezer bc my other freezer died. So look it took over night to really freeze. We tried the every 45 minutes thing. After the 4th 45 minute we just decided to wait.  We used all the ingredients. Tastes awesome.

Made it exactly as written.  I had made a rather heavy meal for company and wanted something light for dessert -- this was the perfect choice.  My husband loved it and he didn't expect to.  I'll be make more of this with other fruit as well -- Yummy!

A Yum, Yummy lunch, paired with a feather than airy Twill, a huge success! In a martini glass with a spiral twill??

A recipe that don't need adjustments is a fave in my kitchen. But, I was so awe that forgot to take a photo??
