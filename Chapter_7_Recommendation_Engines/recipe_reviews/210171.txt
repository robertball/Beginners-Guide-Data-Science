This is a great basic eggplant parmigiana recipe!  If you have never made it before, this is a great one  to start with!  I will gently disagree with a previous reviewer that there is no reason to add water to the eggs as stated in the recipe.  The water is intended to prevent there from being too heavy of a breading on the eggplant.  If you like lots of breading, leave out the water.  If, however, you want the taste of the eggplant to come through, I would make it exactly as stated in the recipe.  I use Progresso Italian bread crumbs, and they have no salt in them at all.  However, parmesan cheese can be salty, so if you are worried about saltiness, you may want to cut down on how much you use.  Mangia!

Normally I follow a recipe to the letter, when making it for the first time, but I've had experience with Italian seasoned bread crumbs and I find them too salty.  Suggestion:  Use 1/2 of the Italian crumbs and 1/2 plain.  The water is unnecessary (if it was to be mixed with the egg).  Tasty, easy to make, and certainly cheap.  I think next time, I'd leave the skin on.

I thought this was an extremely delicious recipe.  I used egg beaters instead of the real egg so I did not add the water.  Make sure to turn your eggplant 1/2 way through baking so it crisps up evenly.  I also placed my eggplant slices on a piece of papertowel, lightly salted them, and covered them with additional papertowels.  I left them like this for 15 minutes.  It helps to draw out any additional moisture and draws out the bitterness.   I used the shredded mozzarella and a spicier sauce.  All in all, I rate this 5 stars as this is some of the best baked "fried" eggplant I've ever made.

A tasty and easy eggplant parmigiana recipe.  Don't peel the eggplant.  Leave the skin on but score the eggplant lengthwise four times so it helps hold it together when cooking, you get the texture and nutrition of the skin, but you won't have problems of long pieces of skin pulling around in it when it's served.  Also, I don't use Italian seasoned breadcrumbs. I like full control of the seasonings that go into my dish and pick them to my own liking.  And just like the others, no water in the egg. Try it, it's really tasty and the most of the Bertolli sauces are great just like this one.

Really good, but the proportions are WAY off. I only had 1 pound of eggplant, so I halved the recipe, andran out of breadcrumbs, sauce, and cheese!! I ended upwith a full 9x13 pan of eggplant!  But very good and easy.

This was great! I had several little eggplants that I didn't know what to do with and this recipe saved them from being thrown out. I followed the recipe as directed (using olive oil to grease the baking sheet) and was pleasantly surprised how rich and 'meaty' it tasted despite being a vegetarian dish! Had the leftovers for lunch today and I must say, it reheated well. I'll definitely make this one again and again.

This was simply delicious.  I liked the crispier taste of the baked eggplant over the fried (and more greasy) version.

I have made this recipe before, and it is very good. I cook some linguine and put this underneath the eggplant when I put it in the oven. It makes a meal in a dish, along with a salad it is so good. You need to use a little more sauce under the linguine but that is the only other thing I do to change the recipe.

Absolutely DELICIOUS!!  Didn't have enough mozzarella cheese and had to substitute cheddar for half of it, but it was still very good!  Even my KIDS (who are 2, 3, and 5) ate it, so I was truly impressed!  It's rare for me to find a recipe that makes my children and I equally happy!

This is a very tasty (and easy) basic eggplant parmigiana recipe.  As a previous reviewer stated, it is not necessary to peel the eggplant and the recipe works just as well.  A great recipe to cut your teeth on and easily tweakable for those of us who just can't help but to put our own spin on a recipe.

I love this recipe.  This was my first try at Eggplant Parmigiana and it was fabulous.  I put some feta cheese on top with the mozzarella cheese.  Great addition.
