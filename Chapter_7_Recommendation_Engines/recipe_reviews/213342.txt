Not bad at all but I prefer them without the mint because I like to cover them in gravy, but I did try them with mint and they were quite good, I just prefer them with gravy. Red gravy is best but there good with beef and chicken gravy too. ;)

This is a great side dish for chicken and fish.  I followed the recipe exatly and it came out perfectly.  I know one of the reviewers ommitted the mint but I disagree, as the mint is what makes this dish so flavorful.

OMGness! I turned leftover buttered peas (I like them but also get tired of them) into an amazing side. There's only enough left for me and I'm hoping that no one else wants any.
All this, coming from someone who doesn't cook well or even like cooking! This Will be on my table again. Thanks so much for glamming up my peas.

Good recipe to make green peas even more flavorful, but I can't understand why you would want to mash them.  They taste great even without the mashing.

These were delicious and oh so easy! We boiled the frozen peas before cooking in the oil to make them extra mashable. The brown sugar added that perfect amount of sweetness to the already sweet peas! Will cook these again and again! Thanks!!

These are really good and I don't even like cooked peas. I made them ahead for St. Patrick's Day to see if I like them better cold or warm. I had a problem smashing the peas with a fork, but then I used a flat bottom drinking glass and that seemed to work great for squishing the peas.

Delicious! I was a little skeptical about the mint, but still made it exactly how the recipe states. It was wonderful. Mint is truly what give this dish a nice, full flavor without being minty at all. Love this mash. Thank you for sharing Ella!

I've been making these peas for years without the sugar.(I'm diabetic).  I mash the peas, mint and onions in the pot with an immersion blender.  Excellent!

A good alternative that's tasty. The bowl was empty before dinner was over.

Mushy peas and this style of peas are best when dried peas are used. In the UK, we use "processed" peas, which means they have been dried and reconstituted

I didn't use oil and instead heated them up in the butter. I did not mash them. I used dried mint  because that's what I had. Kept the rest the same. They were yummy. Will do again for St Pat's day.

I was really hesitant to make this.  I did make it with the mint and brown sugar - OMG it was tasty.  Even my grandson liked it (and he doesn't like/eat peas)

I'll be making this again and again - next time will be without the mint and sugar - a little irish butter and salt and pepper!

I thought I'd try this as a change to my usual preparation. It is good but has calories that I can live without. I usually boil peas in a vegetable broth and then use an immersion blender to break down the peas  but not to the point that they are completely smooth, but rather chunky.  It is comfort food and I eat it as a pick-me-up snack - simple food that is delicious and high in protein too -   1 cup of peas (pre-blended) has more protein than 1 egg (8.6 g vs 6.3 g).
