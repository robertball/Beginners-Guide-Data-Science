I loved these!  I made one change out of necessity, but which I think i would repeat.  I only had one cup of banana, so added a generous half cup of finely grated zucchini, which was conveniently at hand from the morningâ€™s zucchini bread marathon.
Also, I tossed in the half cup or so of chopped walnuts that were left over from the zucchini bread recipe.  
I made mini muffins, no paper liners but a quick spray of Pam.  Baked them at 350 for about 9-11 minutes.  The recipe made 60 mini muffins, and they were delicious!

Made them in extra large muffin tins and increased the baking time.
