I made the graham cracker crust. I chose to use lighter ingredients like sugar free pudding, 1% milk, reduced fat cream cheese and "lite" whipped topping. I thought that my pie pan was a deep dish but I guess not as not all of the mixture would fit. My husband was okay with that, he ate what was left with a spoon. ;) This set up nicely and the boys really liked it. My husband did comment that next time, I'm not to lighten it up so much and maybe use a fatter milk. He said it needs a heavier milk for this pie--other than that, he had no complaints. Lesson learned.

I saw Brutalmoose make this on his Youtube channel not long ago and thought it would be a great idea to make it for Thanksgiving dessert. It turned out delicious! My only complaint would be that it's a little difficult to get slices out from the dish without the whole thing breaking apart, but the great taste outweighed that complaint by far.

This is really quick to make. My graham cracker crust turned out to be one of the larger, extra serving ones (10 inch rather than 9). The ingredients in the recipe barely fit in the larger crust, so I'm not sure how well they would fit into the 9 inch crust. I did use white chocolate pudding instead of vanilla. There were no leftovers.

This one's a hit with everyone!  Easy to make...one note the pudding seemed to have an odd consistency so I added a touch more milk.  Have made it now for several occassions and great as a quick thank you gift for a friend or neighbor!

This recipe is great! My EXTREMELY picky boyfriend absolutely loves this recipe! I have also made it with just chocolate pudding (no vanilla) and it is just as good.

This is a great dessert for so little work. Used less fat cream cheese and lite whipped topping. Made this after reading Pam-3boys mama formerly faceless blog. Thanks to submitter and Pam.

Only 4 stars as you really need a dip dish pie crust to fit all those layers!  Very easy, tastes great but don't really like leftovers as the pie starts to "juice" a funny colored liquid and looks gross.

Tastes great. A hit! One thing though, you need two pie crusts or possibly deep dish, or else you will have a lot left over like I did.  That's okay, the kids got double dessert...pudding and filling, then pie. :D

My mother and I have been making this recipe for years on the holiday. We make a homemade crust using cruched vanilla wafers and melted butter, put in a 13X9 baking dish and cook in the oven.

The ingredients were great, the flavor was good, and my family loved this. The only thing I might change is the time to chill or adding less milk. The pie ended up being more of a "pudding mess" than it did a pie, but it was sooooooooooo good.  :-) Thanks for sharing!

This recipe won me first place in the Pi(e) day contest today at my office!  Yeah! https://twitter.com/theresumator
Definitely use two pie crusts, the filling will be overflowing if you don't.  :)

Yum! This was a great pie and my family loved it. One comment: The layers do not all fit in the 9-inch pie crust. You will need to use a larger crust or less of each layer.

This recipe was very much like my Chocolate Lush recipe but easier because you didn't have to make the crust! Yummy!

The ingredients are way out of proportion for a 9 inch crust. Had to keep pushing down ingredients and ended up with leftovers. Additionally, 1 and 1/2 cups of milk was not enough for the pudding as they both were too dry and i ended up having to add more. Otherwise, good recipe.

Made this and used 2 9-inch pans and they were a hit! Easy to make and very popular with the kids!

Took others' advice and used a 10" deep dish pie plate. Substituted an Oreo cookie crumb crust for the graham cracker crust because we LOVE chocolate! This definitely was a hit and we would make it again!
