I've used frozen blueberries instead of fresh.  Also, because I love chocolate, but not the sugar, I add a few tablespoons of cocoa powder to make a dark chocolate version.  The sweetness of the banana, blueberries and peanut butter is so good that you don't need any added sugar.  Yum!

My daughter who’s 4 absolutely loves smoothies and this recipe is one of our favorites!! When I don’t have blueberries I’ve used cranberries, blackberries or a combination of berries.
