The quantities and times are accurate for this recipe. Kheer is not as thick as a Western-style rice pudding, and should be still be a bit fluid when cool.

Often I have used substitutions in this recipe, depending on what I had on hand. Instead of ground cardamom, I use about 12 - 15 green cardamom pods (I like my cardamom!). The pods should go in with the milk to get the best flavour, and be fished out after cooking. Instead of sugar, I like to put in about a quarter of a small can of sweetened condensed milk. Instead of rose water, I add about 1/4 tsp of almond extract (and sometimes some vanilla extract). Unsweetened flaked coconut is another great addition or garnish. Chopped (and roasted/toasted) almonds, pistachios, and walnuts are delicious garnishes.

Kheer is delicious warm or cold. When cooking the rice, I leave the pot uncovered and watch it carefully so it doesn't burn or boil over.

My husband had 5 male guest from India and I made this dish for them. The guys recommendations; don't need to use coconut milk, use whole milk and not any low fat milk, need to cook a lot longer- about an hour. You can tell the rice is done when if you take a piece out and you should be able to smoosh it easily with your finger. I have more of a sweet tooth and I tried while cooking before I added the raisins and cardamom and loved it. I bet kids would like it also before the raisins, cardamom and rose water is added.

This recipe makes very nice kheer. The coconut milk is a creative addition that really enhanced the flavor. The liquid-to-rice ratio was perfect in the finished dessert, with the rice swimming in the delicately sweet, creamy base. This is a recipe I will enjoy making again.

I'm an Indian originally from Delhi. My mom is Bengali and Bengali's are OBSESSED with rice. And potatoes, too, but that is irrelevant. I agree with an earlier reviewer: coconut milk is not needed, at all, and yes the cooking time is longer; takes more than an hour when we make kheer at hom! and the BEST part about kheer is that it is traditionally served CHILLED. Once the kheer is cooked, take it off the stove, and let it cool down to room temperature, THEN you have to refrigerate it. There's very few milk-based Indian puddings that are served warm, and kheer is definitely not one of them.

Excellent recipe.  My fiance, who is from India, absolutely loved it.  Just a couple of things to keep in mind, however: Don't be surprised if you find yourself waiting for about 45 minutes or so before the pudding actually thickens.  The suggested 20 minutes is a little short.  Also, be careful not to overcook it.  Kheer is supposed to be more watery than typical rice pudding, so don't panic!  And it may appear at first that 1/2 cup of Basmati rice is not enough compared to all of the liquid needed, but it is actually perfect; don't add extra rice, or else it'll be too thick!  

I hope my suggestions helped!

This was awesome! I made a coupke changes, however: I did not use the rose water, and I made the dish vegan by substituting the milk with vanilla rice milk, and also used only half of the coconut milk, substituting soy coffee creamer for the other half. I toasted the nuts in a dry pan before adding them to the mixture which I think really brought out the flavor.  When I served it, I dusted the bowls with just a tiny pinch of nutmeg.  This went over REALLY well at the food co-op where I cook for the masses.

kheer is supposed to be more liquid-y than traditional rice puddings! It's not meant to feel like a log sitting in your stomach.

OH Yesssssss......... let me start with saying I have never had any type of rice pudding before. This is my very first experience with making and tasting rice pudding. W@W this was so good so creamy and geez so tasty. I am NOW a HUGE fan of rice pudding, I did follow recipe except for I added just about 1/4 cup more rice, a tad bit more of the cardamom, becuase I really love this spice, and topped my serving with toasted walnuts and toasted coconut flakes, this to me is super delicous:) Thank you so much for a great treat! Now my tummy is all warm inside;)

Don't be put off by the texture of this pudding! Kheer is the original rice pudding, which became part of western cuisine through the British. I like this, but my husband and son didn't (too 'spicy' for them). I didn't have enough coconut milk, so I used more 1% milk than called for. The flavour is nice and somewhat creamy (would have been better and creamier with the proper proportion of coconut milk). I used a little more rose water and cardamom than stated, used sultana raisins, and added a pinch of cinnamon. Other tips: cook the rice as long as it takes for it to become porridge-like in consistency. After refrigerating the leftovers, the kheer thickens up, so you might want to add a bit of milk.

I' give you three and a half if I could. While it does taste yummy, and was easy to make it's still a little off from the other kheer. To the other person who responded, Kheer is what could be considered like american rice pudding. It is not anywhere near as thick or super sweet as the american version. This can be served hot or cold. (though I like it at room temp)

This was absolutely perfect--it tasted just like the rice pudding at my favorite Indian restaurant.  It does taste best chilled, imho.  Thanks, Patrick!

Excellent. I made a few substitutions- soy milk for normal milk, jasmine rice instead of basmati, no rose water and no pistachio. I am dairy free so substituting the milk was necessary. Recipe is wonderful. I'll make it again and again!

I love indian style rice pudding. This is a good recipe for it. I did add another couple tablespoons of sugar towards the end. It was too thick for my taste when it finally cooled, so I also added more milk (1/2 cup) to make it soupy like it is at the restaurants. I also highly recommend adding a couple pinches of saffron threads.

4 stars b/c I changed the recipe and it's awesome now!  I used 3 cups whole milk, 1 cup coconut milk, and added 1 tbsp extra sugar, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and 1/2 tsp vanilla.  I left out the raisins, rose water, and pistachios, and instead toasted almond slivers to mix in.  I also cooked it for 40 mins to get the right consistency for the rice.  I had to add about 1/2 cup more milk after it cooled a bit.  Amazing!  It tastes almost identical to the kheer at my local indian restaurant (served cold).

Fantastic recipe! Turned out exactly like "real" Kheer from my favorite Indian restuarant. I used more milk than coconut milk (2:1) and doubled the recipe, as I had some regular milk close to expiration I needed to use up. Used skim, fyi. Still ended up with a nice, rich,  coconut taste. Recommend mixing the powdered cardamom into a a few teaspoons of sugar, then adding this mixture to the cooked pudding. Otherwise, the cardamom may not disperse throughout the pudding, leaving small, dark lumps. I normally use less sugar than called for in recipes, as I don't like very sweet things, but I felt this recipe could use a bit more. No problem to add it at the end, so just make it as is, then add more if needed.

This is a really good recipe! I think whomever was having issues with it being thin, perhaps didn't simmer at high enough heat because I found it a perfect consistency with the original cooking time and liquid amount. My only addition was a little flaked coconut.

I have searched high and low for a recipe that would make a perfect, hearty, Authentic Indian rice pudding...and this is it!  It was incredibly easy, and my whole family, yound and old, keep asking for it.  I'll make it again with all the ingredients listed.  The subtleties of the rose water, etc. were what really made this special.

Wonderful!  My preschooler and I made this to celebrate Diwali.  I didn't have any white rice on hand, so I used our usual long grain brown rice and doubled the cooking time (just put the rice in with the milks & sugar and let it all heat up/boil together).  I can also see doubling the cardamom, but that's just personal preference.

Great recipe. I added more rice until I got the consistancy I liked. I also added more milk. Kheer is supposed to be runny but I like mine thick.

The flavor and texture are excellent.  I added more rice and it came out fine, but I actually think that the amount of rice in the recipe is very appropriate.  Kheer is not like the European/American rice puddings--it's meant to be more "liquidy."  Mine, because I added more rice and cooked without the pot lid, came out to be more dense and firm.  By the way, when the milk and rice is boiling, it tends to overflow and create a mess if you aren't watching it.  I used almond extract as recommended by another reviewer, but I honestly think that the coconut flavor is strong enough.

Amazing Kheer recipe!  This is my first time making it.  I've eaten Indian food about five times so far in the past few months.  The closest Indian restaurant is about 40 mins away. I crave chicken jalfezi, gulab jamen and kheer many times.  This recipe is supreme compared to the restaurant.  My parents loved it!  I couldn't wait for it to chill as I was tasting as it was cooking.  I could eat this as oatmeal!  I used 7 tbsp of Dixie sugar.  I had to shell about 20 pistachios and beat them in a plastic bag.  I cooked the rice for about 25-30 mins.  Heating on 2 was too slow so low heat of 3 and 4 is ideal.  I will keep this recipe forever.

I would have given this recipe 4.5 stars if I could.  My fiance is from North India, and he loved it!  We serve this dish chilled, and did not use raisins.  I also didn't use rose water because I didn't have any at the time, but the taste was still very good.  I also added a tablespoon more sugar, as we have a bit of a sweet tooth.  Also, after chilling it, it may be necessary to add more milk as kheer is supposed to be a bit runny.  Also, be sure to cook the rice long enough so that it is soft.  Don't be surprised if your cooking time is over the suggested amount. Overall, Yum!

Really wanted to like this recipe. It sounded so good. Way too rich for my liking and also no flavour. If I make it again I'll make it with either regular whole milk or some amount of reduced fat milk and triple the spice. The rose water is a nice touch.

I used brown Basmati rice (instead of white rice) for a healthier pudding, one can of 'light' coconut milk and I used original almond milk instead of cow's milk.  It took about 2-3 hours for it to cook to a soft and not-watery consistency, but it was worth it!  I added a handful more raisins, because I love them.  I didn't have any rose water.  And, I usually serve rice pudding warm.  It was delicious! I'm now trying it with left-over rice and almond milk - the coconut milk is so high in saturated fats!

Well it is more like 3.5 stars (couldn't really get the half start) but I thought there was a little too much coconut taste to it...I would cut the coconut in half and add more milk, also the sweetness was very subtle maybe add some honey?...Good start though!

This was delish.  I didn't have everything on hand, so just the basics of this dish are great. I used coconut milk, unsweetened plain almond milk, thai sticky rice, and dunked in a Chai Tea bag for spices for about 3 min while the rice was cooking. Turned out perfectly. Tastes great warm, can't wait to try cold.

It is perfect the way the recipe is written. I couldn't find rose water so didn't use any and it still came out good.

I really enjoyed this!  The guys, however, did not and I was left to eat the entire pot of kheer.  I think they just didn't like the flavour of cardamom (which is too bad, because it's delicious!).

Made this with the first four ingredients.  Added dried cherries in place of the raisins, and sprinkled on a little lavender-infused sugar for the floral taste.  Wonderful!

This was pretty good...since we're a single income family raising 5 kids, I could not justify spending over $10 on cardamom, so while the milk and coconut milk were heating, I put a chai tea bag in it to steep and flavor the milk.  I also put in golden raisins, and slivered almonds.  For those that like a "thicker" texture, just add a little more rice than is called for, but as was stated before, traditional Kheer is quite thin.  Thanks!

I always crave kheer during  Ramadan. This recipe satisfied my craving but was bit thick. My recommendation would be to make a much as you will use on the same day. Refrigeration made it even thicker. Tried to bring it back to life by adding milk but not successful. Still a wonderful kheer recipe.

Remembering that dreaded rice pudding that reigned in the British public school era of my time, where the only thing worth eating was the blacked crust on the top, I wasn't sure I wanted to make this.  The husband said he LOVED rice pudding .. and why didn't I make him more "puddings" and why .. why ... why...
So I did!

First I thought .. why use good basmati for a rice pudding but then I thought .. heck .. give it a chance!

Result?   I don't care if it's hot, cool or chilled.  I don't care if it's creamy, runny or thick.  I don't care how it should be in India or London or Eastern Bankok.    This stuff is just plain good!

Now .. that one we called "frog spawn" .. not sure I want to try a tarted up version of that!

FINALLY!! A kheer recipe just like my favorite Indian restaurant's. It is spot on with the ingredients I just tweaked the ratio for my preferences.  It was my first time trying, so I took the recommendations and omitted the coconut milk and used whole milk instead. I like the texture to be more soupy than pudding like so I would decrease rice amount or increase milk amount for that. Also I cannot get enough of the cardamom spice so I doubled it. I only had whole cardamom so improvised and put 1 teaspoon amount into a tea bag and steeped for half the cooking time to infuse milk as it boiled.  It was also my first time using rose water for cooking and not for my face! LOL it tasted great in this recipe. Thanks!!

Made this for an Indian friend for Maghi.  I had never heard of it, nor had I made rice pudding before, but it was very interesting and I will definitely make it again. I used golden raisins, and didn't have any cardamom so I substituted cinnamon and cloves. Seemed to be ok. I preferred it warm.

Very good traditional rice pudding. I ended up simmering for 50 minutes on low heat and adding 1/2 cup more milk from too much thickening. If I were to make this again I would use a bit less cardamom and would let the almonds soften a bit with the raisins. Best served cold. Overall, great recipe!

This took me about 40 min on very low heat, stirring occasionally, to get the (uncooked) rice tender enough. My other stovetop rice pudding recipe calls for already-cooked rice, which is simmered with milk and stirred for about 20 min. I will probably do that next time with this recipe, to make sure my rice gets fully cooked. Anyway, the flavor, Wow! I love cardamom & I love rice pudding so this recipe is a keeper!! Would be great after a nice Indian meal. or anytime really!

I had to simmer at least 30-40 mins extra for it to thicken a bit. I followed the rest exactly, except for omitting the raisins due to personal preference. My kids loved it! The texture is different from what you get with long grain or arborio rice. Less creamy or fluffy. However, the fact that my kids asked for seconds and thirds means that this recipe deserves a FIVE star in my book! Very easy, thanks for sharing!

I thought it tasted much before before I added the cardamom. Perhaps, if you're expecting a more smooth/creamy dessert, add less cardamom than called for. I also added about 1/3 cup more rice and cooked it for a bit longer to make it more soft, but it was still a little hard for my liking. Overall, though, very simple, good tasting recipe!

I made this for a dinner party where everyone made an indian dish.  We had a couple vegans in the group so I substituted the milk w/ vanilla soy milk. I didn't have rose water so omitted that.  I had to cook it for longer than the recipe called for, maybe 30-40 minutes.  Everyone enjoyed it.

Yummmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!  This is so very tasty.  The flavors are all very subtle.  I cheated and used aborio rice and cooked it for 45 minutes or so until the consistency was REALLY thick like regular rice pudding.  I also used 4 packets of Splenda out of necessity and it was still delicious.  P.S. Made this again and realized what a mistake it was to not use Basmati rice the first time...so much better.

Delicious and my husband loved it. I just used whole milk, no coconut milk, and I left out the raisins and almonds. We are it warm, which is my preference, but I saved some in the refrigerator to try it cold as well.
Next time I’ll use less sugar, as it was sweeter than we expected.

If you add sugar to milk before putting rice in milk, you will have tough time to cook rice.. So add rice first, once it is cooked and mashed properly, then sugar has to be added.

very forgiving and delicious dessert- refrigerating it overnight lets it thicken naturally. I did use one can of coconut milk adjusted the other liquid to compensate - getting the solid/liquid ratio is important (too thick the next day can always be thinned with milk, tool liquidy needs some straining). I also used almond milk for the anti-real milk people and it was fine

I've made this lots of times. It's great.  I use waaaaay more sugar than the recipe call for because I like it sweet, and I also heavy up on the cardamom and rosewater at the end.  It doesn't make a perceptible difference in flavor or texture when I've used regular coconut milk or light, or skim or regular milk for that matter. Don't use Splenda -- I tried that and the aftertaste is noticeable.

Made this to bring to friends' Indian themed dinner.  Really lovely texture, just the right sweetness, and a divine aroma.  Used almost exact recipe except used vanilla sugar (sugar stored with vanilla bean in it), couldn't find rosewater, and had whole cardamom what I steeped in the milk.  Took the recommendation of others to simmer for closer to an hour.  Served chilled.  Garnished with toasted almonds and dusting of Saigon Cinnamon Made 6, 1/2 cup servings.

This had a nice flavor but took much longer to cook than suggested. It's important to eat it right away, though, as it becomes thick and heavy if you wait.

I eat at an Indian Restaurant near my home at least twice a month and their kheer tastes EXACTLY like this recipe.   I didn't use rose water but everything else was spot on.  I even paid more than I was comfortable for the ground cardamom but as soon as I opened that jar of spice, I knew I was on the right track.   I agree that kheer is served cold and even though the mixture was really runny when I put it in the fridge, it started soaking up the "juice" and became creamy and good.  I did end up cooking it longer than the recipe said only because I lost track of time while I was cooking other things.   I stirred it every few minutes and by the time I looked at the clock it had been cooking on the stovetop for 50 minutes.  Didn't seem to affect it one bit.  I am wondering how well this would do in a crock pot on low for several hours?   That may be something I will try soon.   Goodness knows, I need to use up that cardamom that I paid royally for!

This is a fantastic rice pudding recipe. I'm always on the look out for something to fatten up my 3 year old son with and he always enjoys rice pudding when we go to our favourite Indian Restaurant.

A few notes:
I did not add the raisins or pistachios as my son doesn't like them. As a result I would add less sugar next time I make this as I found it a touch too sweet without the offsetting saltiness of the nuts.

I also added a smidgeon less cardamom to cater more towards my toddlers taste buds. 

This however is a very delicious kick  rice pudding!

This was a great recipe. I took a few people's suggestions and added 3/4 cup of Basmati instead of the 1/2 cup. Though now I can see that after it cools, the 1/2 cup would have been accurate! It does take more like 35-40 minutes for the rice to cook. And I'll probably leave out the optional rose water next time.

This isn't just GOOD, but crazy slap your mama good. I added MORE of the Rose Water and it made such a huge difference in taste and smell. I also used Organic Coconut Milk and it's certainly than cheap coconut milk.

It's not so sweet like the American version, but still tastes great. I'd recommend cooking the rice longer than 20 minutes.

An interesting twist on rice pudding.  If you are using white rice, double the amount or it will be far too watery.  I suggest being conservative with the rose water - a little goes a long way!  Next time I will mix in only 1/4 teaspoon, then taste it and add drops until I reach the flavor I want.

Close enough to perfect I'm happy to give it five stars.  The ONLY thing I would change is giving it a little more sugar.  It has a very soft sugar taste in its original form and I have a bit of a sweet tooth so that's mostly my issue.  I halved this recipe according to what I had left of my coconut milk but kept the cardamom amount the same as the original--as another poster said, I like my cardamom!

This was good but not exceptional.  I only had brown rice, which was a mistake to use because it took almost an hour and a half to cook and it still wasn't cooked all the way. I didn't have cardamom, so I added pods to the milk while it heated up and cooked the rice. Mine ended up being pretty thick because of the long cooking time, but it had a good texture. It was my fault that it didn't turn out great, but it's still 4 stars for the taste.

I love this recipe! I make this all the time now and the only change I make is to triple the cardamom because I like the flavour. I also use golden raisins and slivered almonds. When I refrigerate it, I find that it thickens considerably so I add more milk to it to thin it to the proper consistency. Thank you for this wonderful addition to my recipe box!

Absolute fantastic!  I have been looking for a recipe that was like I had in Indian restaurants.  I love that keer is not as sweet as american rice pudding.  I don't like raisins so didn't use them and didn't have rose water.  Followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  So easy and creamy.  Have made this several times and will use it lots more.

Wonderful recipe - I thankfully DID NOT take the advice of other reviewers and omit the coconut milk or rose water.....- the only substition I made was out of necessity - I was completely out of raisins and used chopped dates instead.  This pudding can be served warm or cold and has a delightfully subtle flavor!!!!  Thanks for sharing!!!

Outstanding!  I think next time, I will add a little more rose water, as the rice pudding I get at Indian restaurants usually has a stronger rose flavor.

Being a fan of traditional kheer, this recipe definitely satisfied my craving.  It was actually a little thicker than I like it but I solved that by adding more milk after it had cooked. I would also use a bit less cardamom next time (1/4 tsp).  Other than that, it was great combo of flavors and textures.  The kheer I have is always served warm so I just heat up the left overs from this recipe and add the milk to give it a thinner consistency.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

This rice pudding is awesome! I think it could use a tad more sugar. I did have rose water on had (finally got to use it!) and I went ahead and stirred the almonds into the pudding, and skipped on the pistachios. I cooked it a little longer than directed because the rice didn't seem to get tender in time. If you're concerned about the fat, using light coconut milk and 2% or skim milk will cut a lot of the fat out. It still tastes amazing! Thanks for the great recipe!

Soooo good! At the suggestion of other reviewers, I added a little vanilla and cinnamon and a tiny tiny dash of almond extract. It really complemented the flavors. I will definitely be making this again. We had it with coconut curry chicken and naan from this website and everything was fantastic and went well together.

I must say that I was really hoping to like this recipe much more than I did.  It was creamy, but not as good as similar recipes I've had in Indian restaurants.  Additionally, when I looked at the nutrition numbers (unfortunately after I'd already started making it), I was shocked to see how much fat is in one serving--33 grams!!  I guess I should have looked more carefully at the nutrition label on the can of coconut milk.

I first made this about 3 years ago and am finally getting around to reviewing it. This is a great recipe. I haven't had authentic Kheer, but this is great. It is nice and creamy and not too sweet. A great combination of flavours. It's great warm and just as good cold. It sets when it cools. Now, when I want rice pudding, this is what I make. The rice to liquid ratio in this recipe is just fine. Don't change a thing.

I've made this before and loved the flavor & consistency.  This time I made it for a friend who is dairy free, so I used vanilla almond milk and vanilla rice milk instead of the regular milk.  It turned out a little too thick so next time I'll use 1 can regular coconut milk and 1 can of lite coconut milk.  Could probably use a little less sugar too. I don't usually add in the raisins or pistachios and it's very yummy.

This was a good recipe and it was super close to the kind they serve at my local Indian restaurant, but just didn't quite excite me in the same way. But apart from trying to live up to that impossibly high standard, this really is an excellent and easy recipe.

I have never had a rice pudding like this. It was delicious and light tasting.  I think I would like a little more vanilla.  The coconut milk is a very nice flavor.

I liked this alot, but it cooked up too thick for my taste so I stirred in some extra milk at the end to thin it out.  I didn't have rosewater so I stirred in a couple tablespoons of honey to give it a flowery flavor.

Loved it! I don’t think I’ll toast the almonds next time or toast them more lightly is all. Very tasty and all six of us loved it. I even made extra and had some for breakfast hehe

I didn’t add sugar but did use coconut milk. I also used leftover basmati rice.  Didn’t have any but slivers. Used Rose water. On a sailboat you have to use what you have and can find. This recipe was a good basis for that. I would definitely make this again!

Pretty good recipe. I omitted the coconut milk (didn't have any on hand), put in another cup of milk halfway through ( original consistency was too much like pudding), added a bit more cardamom and let simmer for 1 hour.

Good recipe. I added 1/4 cup more rice and doubled the sugar because I like my kheer sweeter. I used diabetic sugar (stevia).

It turned out well. I thought the rice took long to cook and was still slightly too hard for my liking. Next time I am going to cook the rice in the rice cooker and add it to the milk mixture.

Made it exactly according to recipe, except after it finished cooking, I blended up the whole thing with immersion blender. That is how I had it in an Indian restaurant recently, and it was exceptionally good! 

Some other commenters warned not to change the proportions of milk and rice. I too was concerned that it would end up too soupy. However I followed the recipe exactly, except for the blending part, and it turned out just right!

The flavors and this recipe blended well , and were subtle.  The thickness  is easily fixed by adding a little extra milk. I will make this again!

Great recipe! I grew up eating Kheer, since my grandmother was Indian and made this for "pooja" all the time. This recipe has been the closest I've tasted to hers.  I made a few modifications: used 4 cups of whole milk and simmered the rice for about 45 mins to 1 hour. I also used 6 whole cardamom  (i LOVE cardamom!) which I shelled and crushed up in my mortar and pestle and dropped in during the cooking process.  In the end, I'm glad I used whole cardamom instead of ground because the little crunchy bits of cardamom throughout wasn't overpowering the entire dish, but it added to the texture nicely and gave a nice punch of flavor when you bit down on one.  I also used about double the amount of sugar and omitted the coconut milk altogether, as I don't remember my grandmother using it. It came out great! My American boyfriend, who isn't the biggest rice pudding kind of guy- couldn't get enough!!

I found this rice pudding absolutely delicious and would make it again and again. I did not use the rose water as I can't stand it, it takes over all the flavors of what ever its added to.  I used 1/4 tsp of cardamon, increased the raisins to 1/2 cup (golden raisins) and as for the coconut milk I used the can of lightly sweetened.  I cooked the pudding until began to get thick removed it from the heat then added 1/4 cup of fat free 1/2 & 1/2 to make it creamy.  The result was terrific and we enjoyed it while it was still warm.

As others have said, trust the rice quantity and don't add more! And use golden raisins instead of regular--it's more traditional and much nicer looking.

This is the 2nd time I've made kheer (first recipe was nasty) so I was a little scared. But oh my gosh!!! This was SO easy and SO delicious!! I didn't use rise water or add nuts (deirnitelt got the cardamom though, it's a tad pricy $8 for a jar...). I will be making this again and again! If you like it more soupy, easy, just add more milk. If you like it thick add less milk or just add more rice :)

I really enjoyed this kheer but I did have to add some extra milk, raisins and sugar. It was my first time making kheer and everyone loved it after the few changes I have mentioned. You really dont have to add extra raisins and sugar but I do have a sweet tooth and I do like my raisins!

This was pretty good. I followed the directions exactly. The cardamom was a bit overpowering for me personally, but for an authentic Indian dish I'm sure it's supposed to taste like that.

Loved the flavor of this recipe!  But being of the more of the culture where I like a thick rice pudding I did tweak it a little.  I only used one can of coconut milk and used a scant cup of rice.  No rose water either, but that's because I can't find it for anything but extravagant prices.  I also replaced slivered almonds with 1/2tsp almond extract since I don't like the crunch of nuts in most of my food.

so I’ve made this for a second time.  It helps tremendously to rinse and soak the rice for a half hour before cooking.  Even then, I find a cooking time of 45 minutes more effective, stirring every five minutes.  It is delicious.  I’m just holding back a star on the cooking time inaccuracy.  This isn’t fast food.

I had a root canal today, and wanted something warm and soft to eat. This was out of this world, in taste. Not only did I love this but my whole family was saying that this is a keeper. Maybe like what the others said, it might not be traditional. But honestly, this is good as is.

This rice pudding is so creamy and flavorful! A new favorite:-) The rosewater and cardamon really make it stand out. It does thicken up quite a lot in the fridge.

I think this is my new favorite dessert. Did not use rose water and instead of cardamom I used about a teaspoon ground cinnamon, 1/4 tsp. freshly grated nutmeg and a pinch of grated ginger. Rice boiled about 40 minutes to get tender. I'm glad I read the reviews so I knew not to wait until all of the milk was absorbed. I refrigerated it overnight and the texture the next day was perfect.  I served it with bowls of toasted coconut and almonds.  All the ladies of my book club enjoyed it.

Substituted dried cranberries for the raisins.  This was great, subtly sweet.  You could even have this for breakfast.

I didn't have rose water, but as suggested by another reviewer, I used vanilla extract instead. Used seven cardamom pods and didn't have crushed pistachios so left them out unfortunately. I think I might have cooked it ten or so minutes longer than called for as it was a bit thick, but I prefer it to be a bit thicker anyway. Very rich and creamy if you use whole coconut milk.

So, I tried this recipe, mind you I have grown up eating kheer. A few things, I saw some of you mentioned about cooking time, what I did different was put this on high heat instead of low. It was done in a reasonable time. My problem didn't have enough milk in the house. Anyway, I added toasted coconut shavings (did them on stove top before making the kheer) and nutmeg powder as one of the reviewers recommended. Also I have a horrible sweet tooth, so I added a little more than 1/4 cup of sugar to this recipe. you don't really need coconut milk, made this with whole milk brought at gas station.

I wanted a non-dairy pudding that used leftover rice so used:

- 2/3 C cooked rice
- 1 C coconut milk
- 2 T sugar
- 1/4 t rose water (which I had on hand; this is optional and certainly an acquired taste)
- 1/8 to 1/4 t cardamon (I eyeballed it. Try cinnamon or nutmeg if you don't have cardamon.)
- 1/8 C raisins
- 1/4 C almonds

It was yummy! I will try it cold when the weather warms back up.

This was okay.  No one was really wowed by it the way we've been wowed by kheer in Indian restaurants.  Maybe it wasn't sweet enough?

This is a wonderful base recipe that yields a tasty treat in under an hour. The cook time was correct, but I did make a few changes to the ingredient list. I used whole milk (like Jenny B's suggestion) since the recipe did not specify what kind (2%, whole, skim)... I also used vanilla instead of the rose water and scratched the raisins. It was super yummy!

very good.  I followed the recipe except that I reduced the sugar to 2 tbsp.  I will make this again.  The rose water, cardamom, and coconut milk are the main flavorants of this dish and I would not skip them.  Otherwise, you will miss the flavorful touches that make Indian food so good.  I found rose water in the ethnic section of Shoppers grocery store.  The note of rose reminds me of rose gelato.

Wonderful -- best Kheer I've had.  I'm cursing myself because I freaked out at how soupy it was, and added another 2 or 3 Tbsp rice -- big mistake, since it came out too thick, like an English rice pudding.  The rice/milk ratio would have been perfect as written.

Adaptations:
I boiled 12 pods of green cardamom in the milk/coconut milk, rather than using ground cardamom, and spooned them out after about 20-30 minutes... the flavour was perfectly infused in the milk.  I also used a bit too much rose water (about 1 tsp) by accident and it was perfect.

I also used coconut cream, rather than coconut milk -- and I used whole milk too.  My Indian friends always tell me that you can't get the proper taste with low fat milk, and the creaminess of this Kheer was excellent.

I highly recommend taking the time to toast the sliced almonds... it takes the flavour of the nuts to a whole new level.

Thanks to Patrick7 for posting this recipe!

This is a traditional Pakistani dish. We LOVE this stuff. Every time I go home, I request my grandparents to make it for me. I love the creaminess of the dish. Jewish people also have a great version of rice pudding.. yum!

I was craving the taste of the kheer I had the last time I had it at a restaurant. This filled the bill nicely.  I picked this recipe because I thought coconut milk would round out the flavor and fragrance without rosewater, which I didn't have. It was just the right sweetness, and the cream from the coconut milk replaced the richness lost by my using 2% milk. I don't have anything against raisins but I left them out because the restaurant version I had didn't have them. It was simply delightful anyway. I can't wait to have it again when it's thoroughly chilled. Thanks for the recipe!

This was delicious, and easy to make.  I added a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg and sprinkled a little coconut on it as well. The coconut milk adds a lovely flavour. My husband loved it.

I used some of the other comments, including using Sweetened Condensed Milk in place of sugar, and it turned out well.  However I did have some burning due to heating up the milk too quickly.  This ruined the batch so next time I'll have to stir it continuously!!

Very Very good dessert.  Very simple and it provides just enough sweet but not overwhelmed with sweetness.  The raisens are just like little surprises as you take a spoonful.  The addition of the nuts adds texture and crunch.

Great taste and texture!  I used 3/4c rice and 14oz can of coconut milk with an equal part of regular milk and added a few green cardamom pods that were removed at the end.  Followed directions as posted (only needed to simmer 20 minutes). Finished off recipe with crushed almonds and a dash of vanilla. I was a little hesitant because I don't normally like coconut but the flavor blends uniquely and subtly with the cardamom and almond. Will definitely make again.

Wonderful recipe, have made several times and always with great results and taste. Important to cook rice uncovered to evaporate some of liquid. Be careful not to overcook rice (will still be soupy when rice becomes tender, but thickens up a lot as it cools).

Yummy! I make extra rice just for this!  I don't use coconut milk or the rose water and it turns out just fine.  I did add a bit of almond oil to the rice's cooking water.  Ground cardamom works fine, too.

I thought that the liquid to rice ratio was too much so I took another reviews advice and used only 1.5 cups each.  This made the mixture too thick.  Do not use less milk, it really needs the full amount.  I also added a pinch of saffron which I soaked in about an ounce of milk first.  This was a nice addition.  Overall, the recipe was okay but nothing to die for.

This recipe is wonderful!! The nuts really add a spazz to the flavor. I had kheer in an Indian restaurant and loved it. The only thing I couldn't reach was a light consistency like the pudding in the restaurant.

This was enjoyable but I had to add more sugar to satisfy my sweet tooth. I cut the recipe in half & I used jasmine rice because that's what white rice I had. I also added some extra coconut milk & some shredded coconut. Thanks Patrick...this was a very nice finish to an Indian themed meal!

Wow!  I totally loved this recipe!  I grew up with rice pudding but this is amazing.  I added coconut flakes and used an 1 tablespoon orange simple syrup and 2 tablespoons white sugar.  Really great and different taste!  Thank you :)

I just made this! I wanted to make kheer with coconut milk, since it was the coconutiness I was lusting for. It came out great: the pudding was just thick enough, though still a little soupy; it was tasty, and not too sweet, which is what I like; and eating it warm (instead of cold, as in the restaurants) made me feel wonderful and sleepy. 

I did make some alterations -- I added a little vanilla sugar, did not use the pistachios or rose water, but did add some (untoasted) coconut flakes on top, to enhance the coconut flavour. Also, I loved the raisins in the pudding, but my boyfriend didn't -- he said it was being "untrue to the taste of the pudding."
