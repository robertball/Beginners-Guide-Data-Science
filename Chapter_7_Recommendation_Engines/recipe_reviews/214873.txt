"2 lime juice"? 2 what? Tablespoons, teaspoons, 2 limes? Can someone let me know what this is? I have made soups like this in the past that were amazing (hence the rating because I had to rate it to ask the question). I assume this is 2 T of lime juice but it would be nice to know.

I used honeydew instead of casaba melon.  Using the coconut milk I had made earlier in the week, this  treat was refreshing!  Delicious!  Thanks for the recipe!

Very nice and refreshing. I love all types of melon and this was a great way to enjoy. Someone asked to clarify "2 lime juice"; I believe it means the juice of 2 limes. That's what I used anyway and it turned out very good!

Wonderful! I did make some changes. I used an Orange Flesh Honeydew melon instead. Also used the culinary coconut milk and I added 2 limes (7 servings).
For a little added something, I put a large spoonful of cashew nut yogurt on the top.
