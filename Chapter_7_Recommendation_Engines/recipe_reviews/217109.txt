For the love of all that is holy DO NOT DOUBLE THIS RECIPE. I did, thinking it would feed our three person family for three days like that, instead it turned into one of the most absurd kitchen experiences I have ever had, with both my husband and I sous cheffing for hours in the midst of crying babies and toddlers, and ultimately all three of our giant pots so that they couldn't even all fit on the stove simultaneously while it simmered, etc. THIS MAKES A TON OF FOOD AS IS. Unless you are feeding hundred or thousands or hundreds of thousands of people, DO NOT DOUBLE THIS.

This is a healthy staple in our house. We often modify it to include whatever vegetables we have on hand or in the garden. Also, you can make a bulk batch of spice mixture and keep this Moroccan spice mixture on hand for quicker day-of preparation. This spice mixture makes a great addition to Lamb burgers, a fantastic pork roast or salmon rub, and can be added for a wonderful variation to a stir fry. We love these Moroccan flavors!

Delicious, versatile and cheap! do not skimp on the spices, they are the key. I used what I had on hand as far as vegetables goes and substituted 2 cups slices celery, raisins and canallenni beans in place of white potatoes, apricots and chick peas and used chicken broth instead of vegetarian and it still came out great. Very tasty and filling, enough left for another meal.

Followed recipe as is with exception of using spinach instead of kale.  Result was very good though seemed to be lacking in some flavor.  Flavor was good but a little more subtle than I expected/hoped.  I would consider doubling the spice mixture next time I make this (and I will make this again).  Oh yeah, if you are not making this for an army, strongly consider adjusting the recipe servings down.  We served 4 people and probably have 4/5's of this left over still.

This soup is AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS! As some of the reviewers suggested, I used the veggies I had on hand. I used some unusual veggies I got in a grab box of organic produce. My stew contained purple sweet potatoes, yellow snap beans, celery, raisins, onions, kale, diced tomatoes, and garbanzo beans. I also used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth. Additionally, I had to add a little olive oil with the kale and spices in order to saute them since the pan became dry. This is an excellent and very flexible stew and I highly recommend it!!

Excellent recipe!  I had to revise based on some dietary factors and also added a few things....as some other reviews recommended, I reduced the amount of cinnamon.  Because my household likes spice, I added a lot more curry powder, cumin, black pepper and also added a bunch of cayenne.  I also added more kale (one whole bunch), some celery, 2 zucchini,  2 total cups of lentils - no garbanzo beans, 3 large sweet potatoes (no other potatoes) and added a 32 oz can of crushed tomatoes.  I also omitted the apricots, sugar, butter and honey.  Yumm--it is so good!  As many other reviews mentioned, this makes a large amount of stew so be prepared to eat it for days....or reduce quantities.  Overall a really great fall dish.

This was really good and I followed it exactly. It looks like a lot of ingredients but most are staples. It does have a good hint of cinnamon but the blend of sweet and savory with a good amount of vegetables.  I love the variety of flavor within the dish and it was very filling. I will definitely make again!

Made this in my slow cooker today.  I changed it up a bit.  I used 2 cups of lentils, a whole bunch of kale, celery, cilantro, and 2 red bell peppers.  I also used about 3 heaping tablespoons of minced garlic, some ceyenne pepper and ancho chili pepper.  I left out the potatoes and garbanzo beans.  Turned out great!!  And oh sooooo healthy!!

I love veggies, lentils and kale and had great hopes from this recipe given the stellar reviews. I even bought dried apricots specially for this. The overall result was rather bleh. The sweet flavors with kale tasted really strange to me. After waiting a day for the promised flavors to meld together, I gave up and added garlic powder to give it some taste. Plus kale and lentils can be hard to digest without an ingredient such as garlic. I should add though that I did modify the recipe as I do for all recipes, and did not add curry powder. I added cayenne pepper and garam masal. I am not making this one again.

This is an easy, delicious stew with all the flavors of Morocco. I honeymooned there--So, it brings me back!
If you wanted to add chicken to this recipe, it would work quite nicely!

So amazing. I added a lot more kale though... Two whole bunches of lancinato kale. Gets better the next day too.

So very delicious! My 1 and 3 year olds both enjoyed it.  Mixing it with plain yogurt was good, too.  I was doing this as a last minute dish and didn't have dried apricots or kale, so I substituted raisins and peas.  I'll definitely be trying this again with all the correct ingredients.  It's rare for my husband to rave about a recipe...Score!

Delicious! I used spinach instead of kale (it's what I had), barley instead of garbanzos (same reason) and added yellow squash just because.  I also left out the fruit. And why did my red lentils completely disintegrate? Good thing I had the barley in there! This is delicious, and even hubby likes it!  We'll be taking it to a potluck and keeping some at home for us, yum!

Delicious, healthy and filling; has a really nice flavour. A lot of prep work, but worth it as it makes a huge batch that will last over several meals. For me, it took at least an hour to simmer until the vegetables were tender enough, so a little longer than expected to prepare. This will be a great tummy-warming dish for a cold fall or winter's day.

I followed this recipe 100%. It is awesome. Don't change a thing. Great as leftovers as well. I did cook it on low for 3 hours and added potatoes in more towards the end to keep them a bit firm and not mushy, but I love the sweet potatoes mushy. Topped it with cubed avocado once and that's good too. Makes enough for 2 dinners for a family of 4 (2 kids). Complex flavors from the spices make it very tasty and interesting.

Made this recipe tonight, it has a lot flavors going on, sweet and salty. I followed the recipe but I added yams, and used purple potatoes instead of white potatoes. I love the smell and taste of the spices. I didn't use the cinnamon because a friend has an cinnamon allergy. But it is really good. Next time I will add more kale, extra spices and corn. Very filling and it made a huge pot, that I will be sharing with my neighbors. My favorite is till the Vegetarian Kale soup, but this one is in the running. Enjoy!

Delicious.   This received rave reviews from the family.   The spices are the key to this stew, so don't leave any of them out.  I substituted raisins for the apricots and I believe most any veggies could be used. First time I made it I used maple syrup instead of honey and always organic green and brown lentils.  They stay whole and don't go mushy.,  It's become my go to dish of deliciousness.

I didn't think this would be good, but it turned out very good. Sweet and flavorful. No sweet potatoes on hand, and had to sub in tomato sauce for the tomatoes. Turned out thick because of that - perfect stew thickness. I'd prefer it without lentils.

Maybe Moroccan food is just not my thing, but I didn't like this at all…probably because I don't care for sweet entrees.

I made this exactly as the recipe stated, didn't modify anything. First time my family has tried Moroccan, and "no one" in my entire family liked this sweet, odd tasting stew. I will not ever be making anything Moroccan again.

I made this with only 2 changes. I wanted a vegan dish, so I sauteed the onions in 1/4 cup veggie broth, and I omitted the garbanzo beans (I don't like them). My changes in no way affected the authenticity of the original recipe. This stew is absolutely delicious. Other reviewers said that the prep time was time consuming. I didn't think so. It took me 30 minutes to chop the ingredients, and the stew was done in another 30-40 minutes. This is a keeper!

I made this in my crockpot, which is on the small side.  I used about 3 cups of water with two bouillon cubes and a packet of dried onion soup (since I was out of onions), about 3 cups of chopped kale, half a butternut squash, about 2 cups of chopped cauliflower and a can of chick peas.  No lentils, tomato, carrot, potatoes or apricots. I used all of the spices and honey in the amounts listed in the recipe (except for cloves, since I didn't have them), even though my total volume was a bit smaller.  I also added a little cayenne pepper.  The flavor in the smaller volume was intense (in a good way)!  I cooked it on low for about 7 hours, and then added cooked quinoa (1 cup uncooked in 2 cups of water on the stove for 15 minutes).

Wow, this is tasty and easy! Due to what I had on hand, I increased the kale, skipped the honey, carrots, sweet potatoes, and apricots. I also reduced the salt and potatoes, and added about a cup of orzo. I also skipped the bit about the cornstarch. It came out with wonderful flavor and heartiness!

This was very yummy!  I didn't have ground ginger or dried apricots but it still turned out great.  It fed our family of 4 and there are enough leftovers for 2 more dinners!

Excellent. I did this pretty much like the recipe, except I didn't add kale, but I added peas. At the end of cooking I added a half cup of Cilantro. This was very good.

This stew is delicious.  After three bowls for supper my 13-year old asked me to please make it again.  I made it exactly as instructed and it was very easy and now my house smells so good.  Thank you for sharing this recipe with us.

This was fine, good, but I didn't fall in love with it.  Instead of using potatoes, I used sweet potatoes.  Tasted good.

Made this for our veggie/first course for the Morocco night I prepared for my husband.  Served with Ksra bread and we both really liked it.  This was my first time making Moroccan and this was tasty, easy and differently delicious!

very good-- a lot of prep! I'd suggest cutting down on the amount of veggies, maybe leaving out the lentils, if you want enough broth. Be sure to use a huge pot--makes enough for the neighborhood.

I underestimated the time it would take to prep all the ingredients, but it was well worth it!  Delicious! Next time, I will pre-chop the vegetables and combine the spices to make it faster to cook.  I made it to deliver to another family and there was enough for my family to have a full dinner, as well.  Served with cornbread and salad.

So good! Didn't have exact veggies, but used most of them and subbed a few. The spices and sweeter items really make it.  I'll be eating it for a week tho...it makes a ton.  Great for lunch to work and good for you too.

I made a variation of this recipe and it was delicious. I mostly stuck to the recipe for the spice mixture, though I did substitute thyme in place of the turmeric (three of the five letters of "thyme" are in "turmeric"; and turmeric is yellow, and thyme has a "y", so I'd say they're about 3.5 letters overlapped, which is 70%!) As the top reviewer suggested I put in whatever vegetables I had in the house: kale, potatoes, zucchini, carrots, yams, onion, black beans, and a can of tomatoes. All of the flavors melded wonderfully and made a hearty and delicious dish.

Amazing recipe. The blend of spices is like nothing I've ever tried - sweet with a great aftertaste. Unfortunately, I underestimated the size of pot I required for the default serving size, so I had to cut out the lentils. I will be making this again next week!

This recipe was a last minute menu addition but it soon became the main attraction at the annual meeting for the FOGFLP in Baltimore. I usually cook vegetarian because of the diverse membership's eating habits. To my surprise everyone loved it. I made(2)changes. 1. I left out the kale only because I forgot to buy it and 2. I used vegetable stock not broth.I doubled the recipe for the crowd and that worked well. This was my 1st time cooking with lentils. Super Easy! I had no left overs. I will make again!  V-more

This soup was very sweet. It was difficult to eat. We made it exactly as the recipe directed. I would suggest omitting the sugar and the apricots. Halve the cinnamon and give it a teaspoon on curry instead. Add a little cayenne. If I were to make this again, I would probably also do only one sweet potatoes and more regular potatoes.

That said, I won't be making it again. Not worth the effort. Plus this recipe makes a LOT of stew, so if you don't like it, you've got a lot of leftovers on your hands.

I went heavy on the spices as recommended by others, but I really didn't care for the flavor of this soup.  If you prefer savory over sweet, this probably isn't the soup for you.  On the other hand, if you are looking for something with a very different flavor, give it a try.

I followed the recipe as written (without using the optional cornstarch) and loved it. I served it at a gathering of extended family members ranging in age from 5 to 70. I offered warm bread as a side and plain yogurt as an optional topping. Everyone finished their serving (THAT is a rare occurrence!) and many went back for seconds. It makes a huge batch…perfect for a holiday weekend with lots of people who have no interest in being stuck in the kitchen cooking for everyone!

I followed the recipe as close as I could, only changing golden raisins for the apricots and swapping one sweet potato for one white. Very, very good. Nice mellow flavor and chock full of nutritious veggies. It's Halloween week and the weather is crisp... My husband (a meat lover) declared this a wonderful "Fall" soup. This recipe will be made many times!

The flavors in this stew are delicious and "just right".

I actually doubled this recipe and froze half for a large group. This is a forgiving recipe that could easily accommodate other  vegetables you have on hand.

I've made this twice for potlucks and it went over very well.  In addition to the apricots I also added raisins (though not everyone likes it I love it)  The spices I added to taste as I love a full flavour punch!

Based on what I had, I substituted cabbage for the kale and added a half-cup of chopped cilantro.  I also roughly doubled the salt to suit my taste.  Overall, I love love love this savory-sweet recipe and will revisit it often.

Very satisfying and plentiful meal.  All of the prep work pays off but it did take me almost twice as long as the recipe stated. I also needed to let the stew cook for 45-60 minutes rather than the 30 minutes in the recipe.  I used raisins since I didn't have apricots but that was the only thing I substituted.  As other reviews stated this makes a lot of food, more like 12 servings than 6.

This recipe is truly awesome. I added extra spices, as per other reviewers and am glad I did. I went with the ratio of 1.5:1 on the spices, except for the curry which I tripled since I use an awesome brand (Sharwood's) and we love it. Next time I will use hot curry or add hot chili as I needed the heat. Served with a dollop of high quality plain greek yogurt and pita bread. Next time, I will make some basmati to accompany. I had no dried apricots and I did not miss them, though I will add them next time for comparison's sake.

The spices were very off-putting. It reminded me of mulled cider, not a good compliment for vegetables. I would re-make this soup again because it is so healthy, but I will use simple salt and pepper instead.

A great dish that makes terrific leftovers! Go heavy on the spices - they're good! I didn't do the last step with the cornstarch since we like more soupy consistency. Used a whole bunch of kale - very forgiving recipe that allows you to add whatever you have on-hand.

This had amazing flavor. I made it exactly as it says (minus the ginger cause we just forgot to get it when we went on our grocery run) and was anticipating leftovers, but when I realized just how much it was going to yield we invited a bunch of friends over for an impromptu dinner. Being that this was my first time making this, I was a little nervous, but everyone raved about it and was asking where I got the recipe from! They also said it tasted exactly like autumn and have thus renamed it "fall stew" hehe. Anyways, I would say this yields closer to 10 servings (maybe even more!) It was awesome over the couscous and went great with the squash braid I served it with. I would recommend this to anyone it was easy, just allow time for the prep work, get some friends and/or family together and have fun!

This was really, really good.  I found I had to cook it 20 minutes longer to get the lentils and carrots soft.  I didn't need to thicken it.  I also found in the end I needed to add a lot more salt which I often have to when using good organic broth.  I thought the spice level was great and you didn't miss the meat at all.  This makes a large pot so I think I will freeze some today.  I mainly tried this because I needed to use up some kale and potatoes that I had.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Lot's of chopping and prep = a wonderfully yummy stew.  Makes a ton and is filling.  Only change made; used raisins instead of apricots and added more Kale (cuz I had it).  Took about 45 minutes of simmer time.  Great as a vegetarian dish, but would be good with a little shredded chicken or pork and served over rice.  Will make again!

If you love stirring a pot of bubbling goodness for hours, this one is for you. You can make it in 30 minutes if you're in a rush, but of course it's better if it simmers for as long as you let it. You may also want to make more vegetable broth if you're like me and love to drink the broth or sponge it up with a baguette.

Yum! I used fresh potatoes and kale from our garden, and this was delicious. I followed the recipe exactly but opted not to use the cornstarch. Will make again.

This was fantastic.  I left out the dried apricots and lentils as I was trying to keep the shopping list short and I'm not crazy about them anyways.  Also, I used spinach instead of kale.  Other than that, made exactly as is.  The spices were perfect for me.  Definitely tasted them without being overpowering.  This will be nice in the winter when I want comfort food without the cream, cheese and other fattening ingredients.

Made this for the first time today.  Really delicious.  Agree with one review suggesting less quantity wise.  I reduced it to accommodate one person and there was certainly more than enough.  Most definitely a recipe I will use again and again.

I absolutely loved this recipe and I followed it almost to a T, however I did choose to use dried dates rather than apricots because that's what I had on hand .
I had no need for any added thickness or corn starch.  I just stewed the veggies and lentils down till they were perfect for thickness.  I used all organic products and organic chicken broth. I will definitely make this aromatic and flavorful stew again.

Not aure why it says to mix spices in a large bowl. . . . a small one works just fine. Also, finely shredded kale doesn't need to be cooked prior to adding the other ingredients. If anything, it can go in last and only requires about 10 minutes max of cooking time.

Absolutely perfect blend of spices.  Be generous with the russet potatoes or white potatoes.  Served with warm fresh wheat rolls and butter.  May try over quinoa next time.

I followed this recipe to a tee, adding all of the optional ingredients (the water, corn starch and the black pepper) and didn't really like it. I had my mom and step-dad taste it first and they said it was sweet and I asked them if it needed more spice and more salt. My mom said she doesn't know if it's supposed to be a sweet taste or what, because she wasn't use to it.  They said more salt at least. Then I taste it and it was just sweet and they were right. This is why I knocked off a star. So after I finished it, I added another 1 tablespoon of the kosher salt, 1/4 teaspoon of Turmeric, another 1/8 teaspoon of curry, about 3 dashes of cumin (I didn't feel like searching for another measuring spoon), 3 dashes of ginger, and I decided it might need a little more spice, so I added 3 dashes of cayenne pepper.  I stired it and they said it taste better.  My mom said she liked it and would eat it.  She said it was a little thick though.,  I should have not added the corn starch since the potatoes ended up making it thick after I simmered it for 5 more minutes after adding the corn starch and also I forgot to turn the heat back down when I added the extra seasoning (i just wanted to let it simmer a few more minutes). It's still good though. I added maybe a cup more of vegetable broth, then one more dash of kosher salt. I'm scared that adding more broth will water out the spices. It's kinda thick to me, but good. I might put it over Quinoa to get more protein! I give it 4 stars!

I have made this countless times now. It's a staple in our house. We can it eat again and again and not tire of it.
I make a ginormous batch and then split it into freezer bags (BEFORE adding the cornstarch). Then, for dinner in a flash, simply reheat the meal in a pot, add the cornstarch, and serve with hearty bread.

This really is delish! It does make a very big batch, so I downsized. I used a quart of veg broth, one 14 oz can tomatoes, one can garbanzos, less potatoes & carrots, more kale, only half cup red lentils, and no apricots. Even though I reduced the quantity a fair bit, I used the spices in quantities as written, except half the cinnamon & cumin. I also used 1/4 tsp garam masala instead of curry powder.

Fantastic!  Hearty and tasty.  I was not excited about this recipe when I started making it, but when we tasted it, everyone loved it.  I made it in the slow cooker because I have little time for cooking.

Loved this.  The apricots and heavy spices were fantastic.  I added more kale, more water as some evaporated during the cooking, then at the end I added a cup of cooked brown rice I had in the fridge, and a handful of sunflower seeds.  Excellent flavor, I'll make this again for sure.

Loved this recipe. Only reason I gave it 4 stars is because of the cinnamon. Next time I will not use it. The taste was a little too strong for my liking. If you don't love cinnamon I would suggest not using it but other than that this is delicious! Makes a lot more than the servings it says

I have to disagree with most reviews here.  The spices were tasty, but I felt the kale and lentils muddied it up.  I may try it again without them.  Didn't have apricots so I used raisins.  Just didn't come together for my family's tastes, even after a night in the fridge.

Only a 3 as written.  Can get to a 4 with changes.  I added a lot more spices and kale, and some red pepper, and omitted the cinnamon.  My wife is allergic to lentils, so I omitted them and doubled the garbanzo beans.  It's healthy and hearty, and a good cold weather dish.  It makes a TON.  I cut the recipe in half, and got 5 quarts.

We loved this dish made exactly as written except didn't have cloves or white potatoes. Very hearty and quite easy to make ;)

I used regular vegetable stock so did not add any salt. I doubled up on the sweet potatoes, used fresh spinach (not a fan of kale), doubled up on garbanzo beans no lentils (not a fan). Kept everything the same...spices Heavenly! Do make this, YUM!

Absolutely delicious! I doubled the spices & am glad I did, it came out perfect. I'll make this again, but won't include apricots & will double up on the kale - there was very little for the amount of stew this makes.

I LOVED this. It's great for vegans. I put cashews in it and I highly recommend adding them in. They brought other flavours in the dish out and added a creamy hit. I also thickened it up a bit with some tomato paste instead of cornstarch (had to put a bit more spice in when I did that so the tomato wouldn't overpower the dish) which made it taste rich. For veg I used most of the same stuff as the recipe calls for but dropped the white potatoes in favour of sweet potatoes (had to drop the honey for the vegan version) and used chickpeas instead of the garbanzo beans. I served it to some non-vegan friends and they loved it. I'm going to make this all the time.

Holy moley this is good. I definitely doubled all the spices and replaced the butter with coconut oil. Mine needed more liquid so I added about half a cup of coconut water which added a subtle hint. Beautiful stew. Thank you so much.

This was fabulous! The only changes I made were I used Hubbard squash instead of sweet potatoes and did not add the dried apricots or the cornstarch as a thickening agent. The spice combination really made the dish! Thanks for sharing--this is a keeper!

Good!  Made with everything except the lentils and cornstarch.  When it was cooked I took two ladle fulls and put them in the blender and then added it back to the pot to make it a bit creamier and thicker. Prep did take a long time but peeling and chopping all those veggies was worth it!

I doubled the recipe in order to use an entire bunch of kale, which is easier to buy-- came out great (and HUGE!). I also used 2/3 of the recommended broth and the rest water to save a little $$ and the taste didn't suffer. Great with parmesan and/or hot sauce. Yum!

Tasty.  I think this serves more like 8-10 people.  Make sure to cut the veggies small to keep the cook time down.  This took me about 2 hrs to make but I think it was because of the size of my veggies.  I have to say I loved the dried apricots in this!

Very good overall and I liked the wide variety of ingredients. The next time I will put in less cinnamon, it overpowers the other seasonings in my opinion. I agree with the other post that added more kale. I put in an extra cup and could definitely have added more.

Really delicious and easy stew. I substituted zucchini for the regular potato because I have so much of it this time of year and the stew still came out wonderful. I did cut it in half because it was only me and my mother eating and it made much more than three servings! It made about 8 cups of stew. Great to have as leftovers though, so no complaining here! Thanks for the tasty healthy dinner!

We loved this! I added a lot more Kale, but used less broth and less of both types of potatoes. I kept the spices, maybe used a little more even. I used fresh ground nutmeg, tasty! We loved the sweet taste, so unusual. My husband has just been to Kenya, he said it reminded him of the food he had there.  Every member of my family thought this was a great Meatless meal and it’s easily adapted for my son’s vegan girlfriend. A winner! Thanks for the great recipe!

We love this and make it regularly.  What I like most is that the sweet/spicy combination is different than other soups or stews that I make.  I add chicken, 1 1/2 times the spices because I enjoy them so much, and throw in what ever veggies I have on hand (in addition to those in the recipe).  It freezes well.  I  took it to a potluck and came home with an empty pot.  A dollop of plain yogurt or sour cream and cilantro compliment the other flavors.

Wonderful recipe wouldn't change a thing. I did use 1 tbsp butter and 1 tbsp coconut oil when sauteing the onions. It did seem to help when adding spices so it wasn't too dry.

So delicious, closest thing I've ever found to my favorite Nile Spice Couscous Lentil Curry soup, and will definitely make again (would be delicious served with couscous).  I made the following adjustments:  (1) Doubled the amount of curry powder; (2) Added a few cloves of minced garlic when I added the dry spices; (3) Reduced amount of potato - used 2 russet potatoes, 1 sweet potato and a cup of chopped zucchini  (add the zucchini towards the end of cooking so that it doesn't get too mushy); (4) Reduced the amount of apricots [used 4 small apricots];  (5) Didn't add honey; and (6) skipped the optional cornstarch.  An instant favorite.

The stew taste bland, but I doubled the spices to give it more flavor and added red pepper flakes to give it a little kick.with the added spice it was delicious.

My family and I really enjoyed this stew, more than I thought we would, honestly!  Actually, my family doesn't typically like soups or stews so I was surprised.  I will definitely make this again.

Great flavor.  I would have to call this a soup rather than a stew. If I make it again, I think I'll use more lentils.

This is so good and healthy. One of those recipes we crave because it is delicious and makes the body feel good. I add a can of sweet peas. I also always make the corn starch slurry and add it. The thickened broth is just so satisfyingly more stew-like. This makes a lot. As one reviewer noted it would be a very bad idea to double this. I am a chronic recipe doubler and I would never make two batches of this at once because it fills my largest soup kettle to the top.

This was a real hit with the whole family. You can add extra, less or some different veggies to this and will turn out good. I had some frozen pureed hubbard squash (maybe 3/4c) that I added and it thickened it even more, not that it needs any more but was a nice addition. Great stew and gluten free for one of our family members needs.

This is really good. Use a big pot to make this one. It serves 8 or maybe 10 depending on portion size.  It’s very flavourful and filling. I added a touch more of all of the seasoning. I had no nutmeg, so I used garam masala. I used brown lentils. Didn’t bother with the corn starch.  We’ll be making this again for sure.

This is a very flavourful, filling, and flexible recipe, perfect to use up any veggies you have in the house!

I used carrots, sweet potato, onion, lentils, and chickpeas -- it turned out very yummy with just these veggies. This is one of those great recipes that works with most combinations/quantities of random winter vegetables. :)

For the spice mixture I didn't have nutmeg or cloves, but I just added a bit of turmeric and curry powder instead. Still turned out very flavourful!

The overall flavour is quite sweet, so if you're not a big fan of that, go a bit easier on the cinnamon and skip the honey. And you can balance out the sweetness by added more black pepper at the end.

I also didn't use the dried apricots. They can be quite expensive, and I found the soup was sweet enough without them.

Overall, very yummy, quick and easy, and made a large amount (no need to double the recipe!!).

I also varied the recipe some. I added 1/4 tsp cardamom  and a bit more turmeric to the spices and added kalamata olives and mushrooms to the stew with the potatoes, etc.  the olives add a little tang that I think helped a lot. It was delicious over whole wheat couscous.

Excellent; nice blend of vegetables. The sweet potatoes blended in well and were not the strong flavor that I thought they may have been. Used two 32-oz Chicken Broth cardboard containers for the vege broth.  Mixed spices per the measurements and was perfect! Did not put in the apricots nor the corn starch;  but did use the honey. Served with Naan bread. Even my meat-eaters liked it. Nice healthy dish!

I made some tweaks to make the recipe vegan and it was delicious! Even more flavorful on day 2! Excluded butter and sautéed in olive oil. Also, Instead of broth I used water & 2 tbsp Tom paste. I added corn (to entice my son) and used red kidney beans instead of lentils; added chili powder and instead of the regular potatoes, I added jack fruit for some sweetness (I did still include sweet potatoes which were yummy)! Absolutely delicious!!!!  Thanks for giving me the base ingredients for your wonderful, healthy stew!! This will become a staple!!

Decided to make this for Meatless Monday (a new venture in my house) and was really happy with the flavors.  The stew felt substantial and I am excited to make this dish again - word of warning I would budget extra time for prep and make sure you have an extra pot available because the quantity is quite a bit.

This recipe makes enough for eight or more. I used precooked lentils and added them before serving. I should have cut the kale into smaller pieces. I also used raisins as well as apricots. Very filling but good. Served with dollop of sour cream and corn bread. A very full and tasty meal.

I made this for my mixed family (Vegetarian and Meat Eaters).  Put Chicken on the side for the latter.  I took other reviewers ideas and did not use too much sweet potato but otherwise followed the recipe as written.  Long story short, it was a hit and the spices were wonderful.  Will definitely make this again!

Made this as written.  I thought it was very flavorful and will definitely make again.  This recipe makes a lot of soup, so be prepared.  The only change I’ll  make next time is add more vegetable stock (because I like brothy soups).  Good hearty soup. Thanks for the recipe!

This dish was very good. The only change I made was adding some garlic powder. Even my husband (who usually won't eat this type of dish if it doesn't include meat) liked it.  I would definitely make this again.

The flavor of this stew is amazing!  I followed the directions pretty closely, except I doubled the curry and cumin, added an extra half cup of lentils (I had a 12 ounce bag and wanted to use the whole thing), added zucchini and red bell peppers, used fresh diced tomatoes instead of canned, and increased the broth to account for the extra lentils and veggies.  I served it over black rice (not brown, actual black rice) and sprinkled my serving with red pepper flakes.  Yum!

Didn't have nutmeg, or cloves so those were omitted.
Added garum-masala, so it had some Indian flavors, I guess.
Also reduced the amt of honey, but it was still sweeter than I prefer. I might exclude the honey altogether next time. Overall, it is a yummy recipe I'll make again.

I love this dish! It's hearty, filling, and goes over well with my vegetarian friends. You can easily make this a vegan dish by using coconut oil instead of butter, and maple syrup instead of honey.

For my dish, I added turnip, parsnip, and extra kale. I substituted the honey for maple syrup, and I added a couple chopped dried mango slices, and half the apricots. 

The next time I make it, I'll be adding some garlic to the onions while they sauté, for some additional flavour. 

This dish makes a ton of food! Serve it with crusty bread and enjoy!

OMG this was so good! I halve the recipe, but still added an entire 14oz can chopped tomatoes. Other than that, I followed the receipt exactly. Even the Non-veggies hubby really likes it! “It’s good!! Doesn’t taste like vegetables!”As he said.... The only thing is, it came out a huge amount of stew even halved, seems enough for 6-8 people as a SIDE DISH. Considering make this for the potluck dinner.      P.S. is there any particular reason using dried apricot? Could it be dried plums/papaya or any other dried fruit?

It's very bland, so be prepared to double the spices.  Rather than using corn starch to thicken, just hit  it with an immersion blender a few times.

My all time favourite! Depending on what I have on hand, I throw in different vegetables and beans each time, with small variations in the spice I use. Every single time is a hit. Always better the day after and it keeps well for days in the fridge.

Made it twice and the only change was the second time I left out the honey, which then made it completely Vegan.  It was a great blend of seasonings.The sweet potato and dried apricot added a great sweetness to the stew.  It was better the next day also.  I had some left overs so I ladled them into freezer bags.  Each with enough for two servings and froze them.  Have pulled them out for a couples of lunches since, defrosted them in the refrigerator overnight , heated in microwave till hot, added a piece of 21 grain bread and just as yummy as when it was first made.  
Now on my, regular staple list, and have given the recipe to my daughter, and step-son (he is vegan).  
Thank you for this great recipe.

My sister is vegetarian - she loved it. I cooked some lamb sausages with it, and that kept the meat eaters happy. One of them cut up the sausage and added it to the stew and said that was great.

We really liked this recipe but it took a lot longer to cook. Not sure if my heat was down too low while simmering. Also would like to have had a little more spice. Think next time I will half all ingredients except the spices. Definitely intend to make again.

Easy and filling. I ended up simmering my stew closer to 45 minutes so the vegetables could cook a bit longer. It ended up with very little liquid left in the mix. Next time I'll add more broth. The dried apricots really made this recipe for me!

I can't count the number of times I've made this recipe. As others have said, the key to this recipe is the wonderful blend of spices so be sure to use all the spices stated in the recipe. 

Makes a large pot so probably not a good idea to double unless you're using a large stock pot and have a lot of people to feed. I omit the potatoes and replace with some extra vegetables such as cabbage and zuchinni. 

Pretty much any vegetable I think would work well in this recipe. This recipe is definitely an all time fave of mine and a keeper!

I did everything according to the recipe. After 25 minutes of cooking in the broth, all of the root vegetables were mush.  I made this to take to a friend's house the next day, but I wouldn't want to put it in front of my hostess, or anyone for that matter. Very disappointing.

This is the best recipe served over cous cous.  I make it in the slow cooker so it simmers all day.  Often I don't include the lamb...a very nice vegetarian meal.

I made this in the crockpot today. Not knowing how long it would take in the crockpot, I set it on too low of a setting, and after hours, the lentils were still not totally soft. I wish I had time to have cooked it on the stove instead. That being said, the flavors are wonderful, but you have to like the strong spices of Moroccan food. I do, but I have family members who dislike those spices and wouldn't even try the stew. Their loss! I loved it. Healthy and flavorful - what more could you ask for?! I followed the recipe other than having to substitute Better than Chicken because I was out of Better than Vegetable broth mix. Oh, and I used 1.5 cups of lentils (green).  I will definitely make again.

I halved the cinnamon and upped the curry powder to 1/2 t. I skipped the honey and apricots, but I might add raisins to the leftovers. Otherwise, very good!

Excellent for lunch or dinner.  As other have said, the spice mix is the key.  I substituted spinach for kale, dried apricots for raisins and one can of lentil soup for dried lentils  I also added some brown rice and quinoa. 
This recipe is not a hit in my house, as it is on the sweet side, but  I've made this recipe many times just for me!

This is a great dish which myself, 3 teenagers and my husband all enjoyed. I didn't have kale so used Swiss chard instead. I topped each bowl with Greek yogurt and added a wee bit of salt to mine. Only change next time -  I would omit the honey, it was slightly too sweet for my taste. Overall - a keeper!

PROS:
1. Excellent flavor and spice palate!
2. Makes a TON of food.
3. Great freezer meal, just chop and freeze all the veggies.
4. Filling way to go meatless if your family isn't quite on board.
CONS:
1. The recipe calls for way too many potatoes and sweet potatoes - I recommend halving the amounts if you want everything to fit in a large pot - otherwise you should use an actual stock pot. 
2. If you add even 2/3 of the recommended root veggies, there's not enough broth to cover them. Again, less root veg OR bigger pot and more broth.
3. It does need a kick to liven it up, curry is good.
CHANGES:
1. I didn't have apricots so I used raisins and it tasted fine.
2. I used homemade chicken stock instead of veggie  broth.
3. Wait to add the garbanzo beans until five minutes before the rest of the stew is done, otherwise they turn to mush.

Great recipe. I didn't have all the proper ingredients so I improvised and it was still great. The spice blend is key,  but I used butternut squash instead of sweet potatoes, raisins instead of apricots, 2 cans of chickpeas and no lentils, also no carrots and chicken broth instead of veggie broth.  Again, this was just what I had on hand but it was excellent despite bastardizing the recipe :)

Great flavors!  Lintels overpowered it a bit so I may cut down on those or just add the gabanzo beans next time.  I'll definitely make this again!

Delicious. Anyone who says it doesn't have flavour must have old spices... it's very tasty. I did add a 28oz tin of tomatoes as that's all I had, and I used raisins as I don't have apricots... but definitely a keeper and I will use apricots in the future.

Delicious! The spice mixture is so good. We are not vegetarians, so I used chicken stock. No potatoes because of the glycemic index, but added celery, extra carrots. Really, any vegetable would be a great addition. Saved this one to my favorites!

Made this in the slow cooker after looking for tips. Other sources recommended using onion powder and garlic powder instead of raw, or otherwise pre-sauteeing the onion & garlic before starting the slow cook. For our house, it could have been a bit spicier, so I would add red pepper next time, but the combination of fragrant spices was lovely. Lentil, chickpea and 2 potatoe types makes this a well-balanced meal nutrition-wise for vegetarians!

I love to make a big batch of this when the weather first gets cool, freeze it, and enjoy it on the cold nights.  Very flavorful!  I do add a bit more heat when I reheat it, either red pepper flake or some sriracha.

Yum! I've been looking for a hearty stew to fit into our plant-based whole food diet. This will definitely become a staple! The only change I made was to water sauté the onions because we're trying to cook with less oil. (I also left out the sweet potato because I didn't have any on hand.). I had never used dried apricots in a stew and was a bit nervous it might ruin the taste but it was actually a terrific enhancement! Thanks!

The spices are perfect and the apricots and honey really make it.
After being on tour and eating nothing but cheap cheese pizza for 3 weeks, this is the first thing I made when i came home.  It was glorious and it fed me for a week (AND I froze about 6 cups of it).  I added chicken this time and can't wait to impress my boyfriend.

Good recipe, doubled the spices on another users recommendation and doubled the kale. Didn't have curry powder so omitted but it was still very tasty.

This is a great recipe.  I doubled the spices and the kale to suit my taste.  The combination of spices is AMAZING!  Delicious!

I served this dish for friends- non vegetarian. They loved it. I too added double the spices, and for an extra twist  the juice of an orange . Next time I will double up on the kale aswell. 
Great easy meal to make for  the family to.

Love this recipe! I have made it many times (with a few changes). I have 2 girls (6 & 11) & they always devour it.
The changes; Sautee 3 cloves of garlic with the onions. I      
Omit the honey & dried apricots. We are not 'sweet' eaters so the cinnamon is enough for us.
I increase the spice mixture to 1.5 (aside from the salt, I keep as is). Use spinach in place of kale (I always have it on hand). I use 'chili' style canned tomatoes & canned lentils. If I don't feel like standing in the kitchen I just throw it all in a pot & let it simmer for a few hours - it still turns out amazing!

Delicious!  The only change I made was that I added an extra sweet potato in place of the white potato.  I absolutely love this recipe and will be making it quite often.

This was delicious. Great flavor combination. I left out the honey and the potatoes since I was out of both. I substituted 3-4 cups of spinach for kale, and sultanas for the apricots. I also added about 1/2 cup rice to thicken it up. This is a very versatile meal.

Added more veggies, fewer potatoes, and almost doubled the spices because I enjoy strong Moroccan flavors. I also love tomatoes so added another can of those (also to even out the extra veggies). My family loved it so much they asked for the recipe to make it for a big holiday dinner. Don't leave out the apricots. They add a unique flavor.

This is a really good winter meal.  I added 1/4 tsp cayenne but otherwise made it according to the recipe.  This makes a lot; I might halve it next time.

Very good. Part of my New Year's resolution to eat less meat. I know it says "large pot", but they really aren't kidding! This makes a lot of stew. I just made it for me to take to work for lunch, and if I'd been more aware, I might have halved the recipe. I would also recommend that you get all ingredients ready before you start. I was rushing to chop carrots, add lentils, etc... while the rest of the soup was already boiling. This led to the carrots not being all the way done. The lentils were al dente when the potatoes were done. The dried apricots are a cool addition, they add the occasional burst of flavor/sweetness.

Pretty good.  I doubled the spices, would have been kind of bland without that.  Some celery would have been great...I'll try that next time.  Went great with a Pinot Noir.

It's delicious! I edited it quite a bit though....so I can't say exactly for sure that I give it 4 stars......on top of the recipe I added parsnips, and I tripled the amount of spices, I added corn, and barley, and some celery at the end. Mine turned out SO delicious!! 5 stars!

Love the spice flavors. I use more sweet potatoes than white and have used spinach in place of kale. Have also added random veggies, zucchini, celery, whatever looks good. I'm trying it with less broth today to make it less soupy and maybe cut down on the quantity. This recipe makes a ton. Also doubled the spices.

This recipe is wonderfuland so fragrant!  I only used dry lentils (no other beans) and fresh tomatoes and it really was delicious.  Also, I blended about 1/4 of the finished product and that gave it a nice consistency.  I will definitely make this again!

This was a hit! I used all sweet potatoes because that's what I had and healthier than regular potatoes. My husband and in-laws all loved it. I made rice with it the first night and pita bread the second night. I loved the spices as I've found many dishes can be on the bland side. I will make this one again for sure.

Loved this. Didn't do it to make-ahead, just had most of these ingredients on hand. I didn't have the dried apricots, so used figs, forgot the carrots, and used red potatoes, since that's what I had. I think this recipe would be and is very flexible. So healthy, too. I know I'll make it again.

What a delicious and simple stew...simple to make that is.  The flavors are complex and wonderful...it also makes a ton - great leftover for lunch. The spice mixture is the key to the flavor...don't skimp on that.   I followed the recipe exactly with great results.  I never quite know what to do with kale...not anymore - might even add a little more next time.  This recipe would also lend itself well to other vegetables - a very versatile recipe.

this soup is bloody BRILLIANT!!! i did a few replacements: raisins instead of apricots, baby tomatoes instead of canned, and i didn't have kale today, but look forward to cooking with it next time. also, i used a hand blender to make everything slightly more blended and WOW that was a great decision. absolutely smashing results.

I have tried many recipes for my vegetarian daughter & her chef spouse and with this one I finally have a hit!  I am not a vegetarian & find it difficult to cook for them, but this was a big hit.  I made this for part of their Christmas dinner and even the non-vegetarians liked it, I even had a couple of recipe requests.  Thank you so much for making Christmas dinner more enjoyable for all with this wonderful recipe.  I made it as per instructions except I used more sweet potato & less white potato.  I also used spinach instead of kale as I was worried about it being bitter.  My daughter wants me to make it again with the kale as she assures me that it will be fine.  Once again thanks!

Great! I used a butternut squash instead of a sweet potato and carrots, eyeballed the spices, and added a little heat. Very forgiving recipe!

Family favorite. I add either 1-2 lb or ground turkey or 1 lb of ground beef, whatever i have on hand. (we like the extra protein). I also used twice the sweet potato and eliminated white potatoes. Lastly, used olive oil instead of butter. Awesome.

This was absolutely amazing!  Made a big batch of it and had it for lunch all week and never got sick of it!  I used an array of different vegetables, basically what I had on hand.  Spinach instead of kale and added 5 minutes before we removed it from heat.  We didn't have sweet potatoes, carrots or apricots, and added in celeriac,  zucchini and rutabaga.  YUM!

I made this for my daughter's freezer.  She is just about to have a baby and I wanted to fill their freezer with healthy vegetarian food.  I think we will be eating vegetarian meals now too.  My husband just came in for his 2nd bowl of it. We have never tried anything like this and were so pleasantly surprised by how much we loved it.

Very tasty even my 2 yr old ate it! I omitted the regular potatos bc 2 sweet potatos is plenty starch. I had to double the veg broth to make enough liquid. Other than that, cooked it for 1 hr longer to get the lentils softer, I added a spoonful of sourcream and fried onions to the top when serving.

Holy cow this is yummy.  My 9yr & 14yr old loved it!  The only substitute I made was using black eyed peas instead of garbanzo beans.

I wanted to make something a little different for a change and decided this recipe would probably be very well-received in our home.  I didn't change the recipe and found it to be very good and extremely filling.  I would have preferred a little more heat but this is definitely a keeper.  I'll just play with the spices a little to taste.  Definitely give it a try!

I made this exactly to recipe, except I made a half batch.  I will say, I definitely had more than three servings; more like 5 or 6!  And, this is super filling.  The kale was great.  I might add more tomatoes next time.  The spices were just right, except it needed more salt.  Good, unique flavor.

Awesome! Can't wait to eat the leftovers from the freezer.  Didn't have sweet potatoes on hand, so used acorn squash instead, and it turned out nicely.

Fantastic stew!  Used red lentils, olive oil instead of butter and did not add the honey, cornstarch or extra water.  This recipe has become a family favorite. Next time I will probably add a little more kale.  Thank you for sharing this delicious recipe!!!

This stew is a wonderful fragrant meal all by itself. Had to make a trip to the store for a few spices and fresh veggies.  It was so easy to make. The only change I made was that I used 3 big red yams and no white potatoes. The apricots made it extra tasty as well as all the spices, smells amazing! This is my new favorite!!!

This is amazing!  I changed very little - added a little more curry powder, and a little more honey.  It was delicious and I will definitely make again (and often!).

Sooo good and healthy!! My husband and I loved this and so did our 2 year old and 8 month old! I made a couple of slight changes. I used 3 small potatoes instead of 3 large potatoes and added a diced golden delicious apple (Peel on). I also added a little less than a tablespoon of brown sugar and a pinch of table salt. I seasoned it pretty generously with black pepper and added a little more cinnamon. Amazing! Will be making this on a regular basis! My husband and I both agreed it would be fantastic with a little ham in it so I'll try that next time! Also a nice loaf of crusty bread would be great dipped in it! Mmmmm : )
