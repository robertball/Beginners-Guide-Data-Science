We offered this on our Saturday Breakfast menu at our restaurant.  It got great reviews from staff and customers alike....decadent! Oh my!   One family asked for the recipe so I referred them to allrecipes.com!  Others offered suggestions of various other sugar fix cereals to try including ones with berries or peanut butter Captain Crunch.  Paired with a good bacon it's a winner!

This was a great use of our leftover challah from Shabbat, but I did make some changes so it would be healthier. I only used 2 eggs, omitted the heavy cream, used 3/4 cup of soymilk instead of 1/2 cup 2% milk, used vegetable oil instead of butter, and Life cereal instead of Cap'n Crunch (far less than the 1/2 package suggested by the recipe). Also, maybe it's just my stove, but I partiallly burned the first slice at 3 minutes on medium-high heat. I cooked the rest of them for 1 minute on medium heat and they cooked perfectly. With these changes, it was great! My family loved it. I will probably make again next time we need to use up some challah.

French Toast with Captain Crunch cereal in it sounds crazy but, if you've ever been to the 
Blue Moon in Baltimore, you know...  People wait in line for well over an hour to eat at this place, and this is one of their most popular dishes.  I live in Texas and do not get up to MD very often-there is nothing like it.  Thank you so much for posting-you did a great job!

This was really good French toast - but the recipe ingredients are off a bit in my opinion.  I had a lot of egg batter left over - so I would probably reduce the ingredients if I were to make this again.  I did use just regular whole wheat bread - so maybe that effected how much egg batter was used.  I also needed a lot more Cap'n Crunch cereal than the recipe called for, probably about triple (1 1/2 cups).  The end result was really good - my kids loved it!

Fun food. Must try at least once in your life. Delicious, but I wouldn't say the most nutritious breakfast food. Reminded me of the fair and all the tasty treats.

This was sooo good! It was the first time I used Challah bread for French Toast and it defintiely won't be the last. The Captain Crunch made a nice cripsy/chewy texture on the outside. A definite keeper!

No one liked this, maybe it was the Captain Crunch (kids never had it before) but I won't be making it again.

Used whole milk, forgot to put the sugar in the batter, it was still very sweet, so I'm glad I didn't. I also watched the Blue Moon Cafe video on making the toast, didn't see nutmeg so I left it out and used Texas toast instead of egg bread, I think egg bread would be excellent though, you don't want to use thin sliced bread as I can see it ripping when putting the cereal on, you need a hearty bread. Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

The lower rating might be more my fault. I'm not good with breading things. Also I couldn't find that egg bread and all I had was normal bread that fell apart with the weight. Anyway, it was good but I think I'd much rather eat one that someone else had prepared. LOL

Good interpretation of french toast. My only comment is too keep it in the oven until all the outside is crisp.
