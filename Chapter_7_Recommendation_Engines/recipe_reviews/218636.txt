My boyfriend and I made it all in one day, since I didn't realized you needed to marinate the mushrooms over night. I was still AMAZING! Defiantly having it again.

I absolutely love this recipe. I'm vegetarian and not a very good cook, and this recipe turned out fantastic. Even meat lovers in my family love it!
