Elegant and impressive.  I made these for a family dinner and there were none leftover.  I followed the recipe exactly except I put the figs into a processer and pulsed until chopped fine.  It made this so much easier to eat these two bite crostinis.  Use good balsamic vinegar, it makes all the difference.  LOVED this recipe.

I recommend this to everyone. I just had a cocktail party for 45 people and everyone loved these. The basil leaf sliver added the perfect taste to this.

I had leftover fig and pine nut puree from the Dolce Pesca recipe on this site. Since I happened to have ricotta in the house, this was a perfect way to use it up. I did half with the puree and half with diced figs. On all of them, instead of just putting "a few ribbons" of basil, I covered the whole piece of bread with basil, which I think added a lot of flavor. The ones with the puree had more flavor, held the vinegar better, and you could put a lot more topping than with the diced figs. The diced fig ones were noticeably less flavorful, probably because they didn't hold as much vinegar. If I make this again, I will do the puree, and add the vinegar to the puree instead of drizzling.

This is my recipe.  It's important to note that the ricotta should really be fresh ricotta, from a cheese shop, as it has a much different texture than the kind you buy in the dairy case.  Hope you like it!

I agree with some others - this is rather bland. Maybe some cinnamon mixed into the ricotta would liven it up?? Any other suggestions welcome as I would like to see this idea work.

A delicious, but different appetizer. Also works nicely substituting pears for those anti-fig eaters (what is wrong with them?)

Not as much vinegar!
