Awesome dish! I have been meaning to rate and review this for some time now, only just now got around to it. This makes the BEST sandwiches!  The only way I changed this was to add onions. I make my sandwiches using french bread,the meat, onions and peppers, slap on a piece of provolone cheese, stick it under the broiler long enough to melt the cheese and then use a dressing of sour cream and horseradish...It is to die for..

Thanks for a great recipe..

This recipe is sooooo good.  Made exactly as stated.  It was quite spicy so cut down on the peppers if you don't like too much heat.  This recipe is a true "keeper".  Also, many thanks to the reviewer who said to make quesadillas with the leftovers.  They were the best quesidillas we ever had. We spread tortillas with low fat, canned re-fried beans then topped with beef mixture (including chopped peppers) and topped with cheese then folded over and pan fried till golden and put in oven while the others were being prepared.  Served with sour cream, salsa and homemade guacamole.

This recipe made the best sandwiches possible.  Everyone loved it.  The juice is spicy, so I put it and the peppers in a separate bowl for those who wanted it.  We used french rolls, covered the meat with grilled mushrooms and onions, topped it off with Jack Cheese and grilled it under the broiler.  YUMMMMY!  Don't pass this recipe up.  Its a winner.  Teresa

WOW - so simple and so delicious! This has to be one of the easiest and tastiest crock pot recipes I've made on this site! What's great about it too is it's very inexpensive and makes a lot. I used minced garlic from the jar and added about 1/4 cup of balsamic vinegar to cut heat a bit and cover more of the roast. I also added two vidalia onions that I quarted and added half way through cooking. I cooked this on low for 8 hours and the smell was heavenly. We served this on toasted hoagie rolls with provolone cheese. Everyone loved it! Thanks Joyce for a great recipe!

This is a weekly staple at my house. Since only my husband and I eat this (it's too spicy for my 4 year old), I only buy a 1 pound roast (and it's usually an arm roast because we are picky about fat). I do not use the garlic, but I do add a package of McCormick AuJus and 1 cup of water one hour before serving. Also, before adding the mixture, remove roast from crockpot, shred and then put it back in. I cook it on high for 3 hours and low for about 6 hours. I love it and I'm not a big roast eater. It is always so tender, no knife needed!

I found this recipe for my mother, who was looking for something good,quick and easy to make with a chuck roast. This definitely fit the bill! Some may find the "kick" of the pepperoncinis a little too sharp, but no complaints in my family!

OMG AMAZING! I used a 12oz jar of pepperoncini, added 1 1/2c beef broth, and some dry onion flakes. Served on hoagie buns, lightly buttered, topped w/ the beef, onions, some juice (from the crock pot), and sliced cheese. We broiled it for apprx 3 minutes and then topped w/ lettuce. AWESOME! A hit with everyone! Thanks for sharing this great GREAT recipe Joyce!

I had a little trouble finding pepperoncinis at first but finally found them in the pickle asile. My family really loves this recipe.  My daughters both work at grocery stores and have taken this to work with them when they have potlucks, one of the butchers commented he had never enjoyed a roast as much as he did this one.  Thanks Joyce for a great recipe.

This is one of the best roast recipes I've tried in a long time.  The pepperoncini gave the meat such a fabulous taste.  Like others, I made this into sandwiches.  I used provolone and bread rolls and popped it under the broiler for a few minutes These make the best sandwiches!!  Thanks for sharing this JOYCE...it's a gem.

This tasted just like a regular roast to me?  I mean it was good but that special flavor everyone is raving about was missing?? What did I do wrong? I followed the directions exactly! No one in my family thought it was out of the ordinary. Won't make this one again.

If you find the pepperoncini too hot, try using banana peppers.  They give a nice pepper flavor without the "bite".

I wasn't able to find a chuck roast so I used three thick chuck steaks, cut them off the bone and saved the bones for soup or stock:) I think I used alot more garlic, and took Ingalyn's advice as to adding a sliced onion. I wanted to add some beef broth as well, but there was plenty of juice, so I added a pack of Au Jus gravy mix instead.With the first bite of our toasted and cheesed up subs, we were both thinking "TOO SPICY!" but next thing ya know, we're both chowing down like two starving, stark raving maniacs. Wonderful recipe, Joyce. Thank you!

Used minced garlic - because it was what I had, and only put two teaspoons over the top of the roast - I think using the sliced cloves would've given it a more garlic-y flavor, but we were very pleased nonetheless.  Had to give *kid friendly* only 2 stars - because wow was this too hot for my 2 and 4 yr olds.  Peppers (I used mild) were unbearably hot - but we skipped them and just ate the beef and WOW was it delicious.  Thanks for a super easy recipe that we'll make again and again!

This recipe was excellent, tasted just like a Chiago beef.  I added some beef broth, season salt, pepper, a whole jar of peppers, french onion soup mix, and half an onion. I cooked it for 9 hours, then removed it and cut up the beef and trmmed the fat and put it back in the broth.  Served it on a bun with provelone and stuck it in the broiler.  Sauteed some mushrooms and onions and served the sandwich with the juice for dipping.  It was awesome.

I was totally impressed with this recipe. I bought the already sliced peppers and I added a little worcestershire to the bottom of the crockpot after reading the reviews but then I just went on about my way doing other things and when dinner time rolled around it was done. So simple yet so full of flavor. I've cooked many of roasts in my crockpot but I have to say this was my all time favorite so far. I will make this often. Thanks so much!

Wow!!  What a perfect and super easy dinner!  I used london broil since it was on sale for super cheap and just dumped it in the Crock Pot, threw the sliced garlic on top, and dumped in the pepperoncini.  I did cut off the tops/stems from each pepperoncini before I put it in the Crock Pot, but even with this step this meal took under 5 minutes of prep time in the morning.  When I got home from work I threw some tater tots in the oven, and heated up some veggies.  During the last few minutes of the tater tots cooking I put the beef into sub rolls, it was so tender it just fell apart with a fork, covered it in the pepperoncini's, and put a slice of provolone on top of each sandwich.  I threw these in the oven with the tots for about 3 minutes to melt the cheese and they came out perfect!!  My husband hasn't stopped raving about this delicious dinner since I made it!  Total this dinner cost me under $5 including the side items and tasted wonderful.  I love recipes that can be made with stuff that I keep in my pantry.  This will definitely satisfy a fast-food craving without the expense or thousands of calories.  Thank you for the wonderful recipe, I am adding this into my rotation.

The pepperoncini gives this such a good flavor, though it was quite spicy. I'm from the Chicago suburbs, and love Italian beef sandwiches. I used a 2 lb roast, a 12 oz jar of peppers, 2 cups of beef broth, 3 or 4 garlic cloves, a Tbl of Ital;ian seasoning, and another Tbl or so of oregano. I also seasoned the roast with salt, pepper, and granulated garlic. Try it on toasted French or Italian rolls brushed with garlic butter. I melt provolone cheese on the sandwich, and add sauteed sweet peppers. YUM!

The first time I tasted this was about 15 years ago at a potluck at work. We love this recipe. I have found that the "heat" in pepperoncini's varies with the different brands. Vlasic is the most mild I have found. The imported brands are hotter and that's how we like them.

This was great!  I added 1 packet of Italian salad dressing mix (for approx 5 lbs of chuck roast) and approx 1/3 no salt added beef broth.  Also, since the amount of roast I had was more than what the recipe called for, I added approx 24 ounces of pepperocinis.  Slow cooked it on low for 9 hours.  Used the shredded roast for sandwiches with sauted mushrooms and onions and melted provolone cheese. Yummy!

If I could give it more stars, I would.  This was so easy and also so fabulous!  I served it on toasted wheat rolls with monterey jack cheese and put the pepperoncinis on the sandwich as well.  My hubby gave it two thumbs way up and my kids loved this as well.  Would make a great/easy dish to serve to guests at a casual get together.

This is one of my favorite recipes on this site! I added it to my recipe box because of all the good ratings but it took me about a year to try it because I didn't think it could possibly be so good with so few ingredients. I am kicking myself now that I didn't try it right away. It is unbelievable that this tastes so amazing with so few ingredients. I found that I like to use the jars of sliced pepperoncini's better than the whole ones so that the little pieces of peppers are all thru the meat, and you get the peppers in every bite! Try this recipe! I PROMISE you won't be disappointed!

Out of this world yummy!! We cooked exactly as directed but instead of shredding and serving on hoagie rolls, we shredded the meat and ate it in tortillas with fresh salsa and sour cream. Wow! Even my uber-picky son ate TWO. We also served it with a southwestern salad I made up. This is without a doubt going on our monthly rotation. I just can't rate it high enough - so so so yummy!

Delicious!  9.5 out of 10 stars! We loved the flavor.  We prepped the sandwiches topped with fresh, raw onions, more pepperoncinis (NOT the pepperoncinis that were in the crockpot), and provolone cheese melted on top under the broiler.  For condiments, we took another reviewers suggestion and served with a half-and-half sour cream/hot horseradish mix.  Phenomenal!... we loved it.  Definitely a keeper.  Thanks for the great recipe, Joyce!

Sometimes the best things in life really do only contain 3 ingredients! This recipe couldn't be simpler, couldn't be easier and could't be more delicious! I served on hoagie rolls with provolone cheese. I did spoon some of the cooking liquid over the top to soak into the bread a bit...this does not need one condiment to compliment, in my opinion, the taste can stand up alone. Fantastic recipe and I've probably made this 10 or 12 times now...it is a monthly staple in our RV. I have made this with whole pepperoncinis, but find that buying the jar of already sliced works a bit better for me. This is just a fantastic recipe that is worthy of TEN stars if AR allowed us to rate it as such!

This is okay, but we have a recipe that is similar, but much better.  Use a jar of pepper rings with juice, 1 package of zesty dry Italian dressing mix, and 1 package of regular dry Italian dressing mix.  Cook in slow cooker on low heat for at least 12 hours (I have cooked this all night and all morning to use for a weekend lunch), shred beef, and cook another 30 to 40 minutes.  Meat is moist but not too juicy and flavor is great.

Love this recipe! It is so simple. My only change is to add a whole onion, sliced. We devour these sandwiches whenever they are made. I do recommend using the whole peppers only. I have made it with pepper rings and the whole ones give a much better flavor to the beef. We serve on toasted rolls with melted Provolone or mozzarella cheese.

This is so good to eat during football games. Like other reviewers we made this into sandwiches. I add sliced onions and a small container of shredded parmesan cheese . Once it's all done I shred the meat (it just falls apart) and place on hoagie rolls, top with cheese and place under the broiler until it is melted, gooey and delicious! Thanks for the post.

Sorry.  It must be a matter of individual taste.  I made this and couldn't eat it. For those who want to try this let me suggest to you, taste a teaspoon of the water in the Pepperoncini jar, if you like it you'll love the beef.

This came out perfect! We spread our rolls with mayo and provolone and then broiled for a few minutes before adding the beef. Yum! My husband added horseradish for an extra kick.

This is the most AWESOME sandwich filling!!  We loved this!!  Per other reviewers, I used the sliced pepperoncinis - highly recommend this.  I added salt, ground black pepper, minced onion, a beef bouillon cube, 1.5 cups of water (to help cover the roast), and a splash of Worchestershire sauce to the concoction before letting it cook all day and the result was delicious, tender, & juicy shredded beef (easily shredded with two forks when there was one hour left in cook time) and perfect little pepperoncini bits au jus.  Used french baguettes (sliced lengthwise & toasted both sides), topped the beef with grilled onions and cheese, then threw under the broiler for a few minutes to melt the cheese and we happily gobbled it up.  You'll want to serve the yummy au jus on the side for dipping -- trust me.  Makes a ton of leftovers for the two of us which we are VERY MUCH looking forward to!  Thank you for this absolute keeper!  :)
*UPDATE* Last time I made these (pictured), we didn't even add the grilled onions or cheese on top, and they were still the best sandwiches EVER! Dipping in the au jus makes each bite that much more enjoyable. :) Try this, you'll like it!

This was excellent. I halved the amount of peppers, added sliced onions, added 1 can seasoned beef broth, and 1 envelope of dry zesty Italian salad dressing mix. Served it on rolls w/ provolone and mozzarella that we broiled before placing the meat on the roll. Served w/ the au jus for dipping. My family loves it!

This is so easy and tastes fabulous. Even my picky eater loves these. We like to broil ours for just a minute vs. microwaving and Hubby makes the best sauted onions for garnish. Thanks JOYCE this is a regular at our house.

This recipe is so good, my family won't stop begging for more! We ate it on hard rolls with tzatziki sauce and it tasted just like a Gyro. The sauce also takes the edge off of the heat a bit. I've made this twice this week and it can't get any easier or better than this.

Once again I tried a high rated recipe to be terribly disappointed.  Had no flavor whatsoever except for the pepperoncini which isn't all that great.  What a waste of a perfectly good piece of meat. No one liked it.

I browned some onions and red bell peppers on the stove.  I put french bread under the broiler to toast, then added mozza cheese and melted under the broiler.  I topped with this recipe and the peppers and onions...just ok.  The beef was amazingly tender but I'm not so sure I like the pepperoncini flavor.

A really easy base recipe.I followed the advice of another review and added some beef broth.Also,I don't recommend using a larger jar of peppers.I used a smaller jar,and that was plenty.I also added plenty of garlic and some course ground blackpepper.YUM!

This was very good. I did not have garlic cloves so I substituted garlic powder for them. This did have a bite to it. It was very tender. I shredded this and served on Kaiser rolls with some sauteed onions and provolone cheese. I will be making this again.

This recipe has become a favorite at our house.  The pepperoncini with the garlic are a great combination.  I also love the ease of preparation. My only suggestion would be to remove the stems from the peppers and slice them in half before adding to the crockpot. Delicious!

I loved the simplicity of this recipe.  I used a large jar of sliced banana pepper rings.  My husband and I are eating low carb, so this was a fun way to spice up a roast.
I sauteed mushrooms, green pepper and a little onion and put that over large chunks of the roast.  Then I melted provolone cheese over the top.  It was tasty, easy and delicious!

AWESOME recipe.  I was very surprised how much we enjoyed this.  I put the meat on crusty rolls that I had spread creamy caesar dressing on.  Then I topped it off with fried onions and mushrooms and the pepperocini peppers from the slow cooker.  Topped it off with a little bit more caesar dressing and some mozzarella cheese and popped them open faced under the broiler.  Thought we had died and gone to heaven.  Great recipe!!

O.K., I couldn't make this as written because I didn't have the beef. We had just gotten back from vacation and the cupboards were bare; however, I did have Italian sausage, so I figured, what the heck, how bad could it be? I browned the sausage in a pan along with a large onion. Once browned I put the meat and onion in my slow cooker with a large jar of the pepperoncini, (which I chopped in my food processor) a bottle of beer, fresh chopped garlic, onion powder and Italian seasonings. Man oh man, what an aroma! Naturally, between the pepper juice and the peppers themselves, this makes a nice spicey dish. I served this on hoagie rolls and my gang lapped them up! My youngest daughter informed me that the dish was a little too spicey for her, but she ate two whole sandwiches! The kids were even taking Italian bread and dipping it in the sauce! Although the sausage was gone I saved the peppers for omelets. Thanks Joyce for a great recipe!!!!

Simply outstanding. I used a three-pound rump roast, a jar of hot sliced pepperoncini, and garlic. Dumped it all in the crockpot this morning, and when I got home I shredded the meat and left it simmering in the juice another hour. Then I sliced up some french bread, poured some of the juice on the bread, put on some meat, sliced up some monterey jack, put it on the meat, and put the sandwich under the broiler for a minute til the cheese bubbled. Plenty of leftovers for lunch tomorrow.

Juicy, Spicy, and Perfect. It was even better re-heated the next day watching football! I added a can of beef broth, can of water, and a package of french onion soup, put it on low in the crockpot for about 8 hours....the meat was falling off. This is a must for football parties! I also bought some french onion bread from the bakery....perfect match! Enjoy!

Made exactly according to recipe. Husband and son liked it, and it was exceptionally easy, so I gave it 4 stars.  After eating it with the bun and provelone cheese,  they went back to the pot and took another forkful and claimed that it was better without the bun.  I am not much of a beef eater, so to me it was just okay, not the deliciousness I was expecting after reading other reviews.  Not sure if I will make again.

We LOVE this recipe. It is so easy and has so much flavor. We use the meat to make hoagies. About 30 minutes before dinner, I add sliced green and red peppers and  onions to the slow cooker. I then toast hoagie rolls in the oven until crisp. I drain the meat and slice and add the meat and provolone cheese slices to the rolls. Top with the peppers and onions. Absolutely delicious!

Delish!  I used minced garlic and a 12 oz can of pepperoncinis.  It works well with other types of roast too.  I served it with sharp provolone on a toasted hoagie.  It was too spicy for the kids, but it's too good not to make on a semi-regular basis.

This meat was awesome....I added a can of beef broth only because the meat was going to be in the crockpot for almost 9 hours and I didn't want it to dry out.  We used it to dip our subs into...wonderful recipe!

My husband loved this served on sesame rools with cream cheese. I thought it was a little lacking, and could perhaps go for a few fresh pepperoncinis.

I have made this a number of times since I first found the recipe ... I still love it.  The only change I have made is to add an extra jar of peppers (sans juice...one jar of the juice is enough) because I can't get enough of the peppers on my sandwiches.  Also, I like to add some beef broth for the au jus.  Highly recommended.

How did I not rate this yet? I'm making it for the third time! This can be quite spicy, especially if you bite right into one of the pepperoncini, but the flavor is fabulous! I toast up hoagie rolls in the oven for few minutes, place the meat/pepper mixture on the rolls, top with slices of provolone, then put back in the oven for a few minutes till cheese is melted. I also serve with a cup of the juice for dipping. Wow! My whole family loves it, including my 8 year old and my mother (in fact, she bought me this last roast just so I'd make it again!). :)

It was love at first bite!  I added 1/4 tsp liquid smoke and 3 large onions quartered.  My house smelled amazing all day.  Served with pepper jack cheese on my Lager Bread personal recipe.  Whole family enjoyed it so I will definitely be adding this into my rotation!

This is an easy and tasty meal.  I have used this for beef and pork.  I add onions and a dash of bbq sauce and serve on a toasted crusty bun with provolone cheese melted on the bun in the broiler. I had tzatziki already made and it was a nice topping for the sandwich.  I put it all in a crock pot and cook until it shreds.

Oh boy - so simple and yet so popular!  My husband is a huge fan of pepperoncinis, so I had a feeling this would be a winner.  It was and he ate it up!  It's not too spicy, which is good.  Just the right amount of kick.  I recommend it.

Ok, since we are not fans of fat in our meat, we didn't use the beef chuck roast and instead used a 3 lb beef top round London Broil. Man!!!!! It was awesome!!!!  After cooking it, as described in the recipe, I took a spoon and broke the meat up in the crock until it was shredded then I stirred it all up. I cooked it about 30 minutes more. We then served the meat/pepper mixture (draining the juice off the spoon to prevent soggy rolls) on long rolls with provolone cheese and horseradish! BOY was it good! Thanks!!!!

"Awesome" commented my hubby and daughter repeatedly.  Perfect for the busy household - super easy and great to have in the fridge for days when there is a lot of coming and going.  I browned the meat first, put in crock and sprinkled with granulated garlic and onion and some black pepper then the jar of peppercini's (mild).  We shredded it for sandiwiches.  Baguette, mushrooms, jack cheese and some BBQ and broiled open-faced.  Leftovers freeze well and would be a good filling in Burritos, enchiladas, quesidillas, etc.

Wow..so simple, yet delicious.  I piled my beef on thick slabs of homemade bread then topped it with some shredded italian blend cheese (mozzarella, provolone, romano, parmesan) and put it under the broiler until the cheese was melted and bubbly..and it was really, really good.  I'll be making this a lot!

I used a 12 oz jar of Trappey's Torrido Sante Fe Grande Hot Peppers (store did not have pepperoncinis). It was very hot and spicy,just the way we like it! I shredded it over toast and then broiled a slice of pepper jack cheese on top. Very Good! Thanks Joyce

This recipe is incredible! The key is that you have to put the peppers on your sandwich (and I like to dip my sandwich in the juice too). My husband and I were very surprised at how much of a difference that makes in the flavor. Making a sandwich with only the beef is okay, but it's really not all that special. Peppers are a MUST!

So easy and delicious!!! If you are looking for the perfect lazy Sunday crock pot recipe - this is it! I took the others advice and added a quartered yellow onion. I also added a sprinkle of italian seasoning (not too much!), and a few shakes of Tony Chacherie's Instant Brown Gravy powder to thicken up the juice a bit. We put the shredded meat/pepperoncinis/onion mix on hoagie rolls, topped with provolone cheese and broiled the sandwich for a few minutes to crisp the bread edges and melt the cheese. **** to make this sandwich pop - we added a little horseradish sandwich sauce (use in place of mayo)*** and holy moly - amazing!

We really enjoyed the flavor of this beef roast. I used a 2.5 lb rump roast and cooked it on low for 8 hours. Also added chopped onion and more garlic and seasoned the roast with salt and pepper. Made  tasty, peppery and juicy sandwiches. The only thing I missed was the au jus. The juices were way too sour to dip sandwiches in but it made the roast beef taste great. So five stars anyway!

We loved this!!! I added some chopped onion in with the peppers.  We shredded the beef and put on rolls, sprinkled shredded Italian cheeses on top, and put in the oven for a few minutes to melt.  We were pleasantly surprised by the slight sweetness from the peppers. This meal couldn't be easier or tastier!

This is good, but we add a chopped onion, some crushed garlic, and some beef broth to ours. After it's soft, we shred it and strain the contents and then cook another hour or so. we save  a few of the pepproncinis to serve wtih the meat. We make sandwiches on hard rolls - very good!

I have seen this recipe reviewed many times and always resisted because I really do not like pepperoncini.  However I was looking for something different to make and since DH loves pepperoncini I decided to give this a go.  I used a rump roast and since we had a jar of mild sliced banana peppers, used them.  This has made me a believer.  It does not taste at all like I thought it would, it is wonderful!  Some other reviewer said it tasted similar to sauerbraten and I have to agree.  I will be making this again.

Soooo good and so easy!! I read a few reviews and decided to put about 1/4c of balsamic vinegar on top of the roast, but that was the only change I made. Even my boyfriend loved it which is a huge deal because it's very hard to please his palate. He kept going on and on about how good it was, I felt like I had just been elected president!

This is my type of meal!  Rubbed the chuck roast with salt, pepper, garlic powder and paprika and browned in a pan first.  Also browned some onion.  As suggested, added 1 can of beef broth.  Cooked on low for appox 5 hours and pushed it to high for the last hour.  Tasty, tender meat!  Will make again!

I love using my crockpot for those busy weeknights when our family of five (with three teenage boys) are not all on the same schedule. This recipe was extremely easy to make and had a good flavor. I skipped the step of slicing the roast and inserting the garlic and just added minced garlic in with the pepperoncini instead.  Will definitely make again.

Pepperoncini Beef Haiku: "What else can I say? This was surprisingly great. No less than 5 stars!" It doesn't get much easier than this - cheap, simple, and delicious. Granted, so many of the reviews boast about all the tasty add-ons (melted provolone! salsa! and what-not) and I also served mine w/ other goodies, like corn tortillas, red onion slivers and tomatoes. But, a forkful of the virginal beef from the crockpot was just as wonderful, and I'm already anxious for some leftover nibbles.

The pepperoncini with beef is a good idea, but the meat needs some more seasoning of some kind. As the recipe stands, it's pretty bland.

Very easy and really good.  Served the meat on horseradished rolls with melted muenster.  Put under broiler for a few minutes.  Yummy! EDIT:  Although the taste was outstanding I think this stuff burnt my lips!  I may be allergic to pepperoncini juice.  Beware!

This was very tender, so much so that you couldn't slice the beef, only shred it. Don't know if there's anything to do about that, but oh well. Still delicious. Took some other reviewers advice and added some balsamic and then used water until the beef was covered. Not spicy at all but I could only find mild pepperoncini. Used the peppers in the sandwiches for the adults, yummy.

WOW!  This was fantastic!!  I miss read the recipe and bought a jar of mild banana peppers instead of the pepperoncinis.  Served over toasted hoggie rolls topped with spicy brown mustard, low sodium provel sliced cheese and sliced jalapenos.  My hubby is already asking when I'm making these again.  Did I already mention that these are fantastic!!!

Very good.  Might try to punch up the flavor a tad, but recipe as it stands was a hit.  Browned some onions and green & red peppers and topped with shredded mozz. cheese.  Also brushed buns with butter and browned lightly before assembling.  Will have again.

This was a huge hit with my family and it is SO easy to make. I used london broil instead because it was less expensive. I also fried some onions to put on the sandwiches. Next time I make this, I will remove the stems from the peppers before I add them to the crockpot. They get very soft and tender after cooking and the stems fall off and get mixed in the with meat. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I thought this was nothing great but the kids loved it.  So it's a keeper i my book.  We used the meat to make sandwiches as recommended.

Delicious and very easy to make. The juice from the jar of pepperocinis gives the beef a nice "tang" but it's not overwhelming or spicy. The actual peppers also compliment the beef well. Could be nice as an entree served along with something like potatoes or cauliflower, but I made it into sandwiches like many others here. I used a two pound boneless chuck roast, three cloves of garlic, and about 3/4 of a jar of pepperocinis. I let it cook in the crock pot for about five and a half hours.  I used french bread and one on side spread a mixture of prepared horseradish and sour cream. I cut up the beef (well, after almost six hours of cooking it basically fell apart once I cut into it) and threw that along with some of the pepperocinis (whole) onto the bread. Added some sauteed onions and mushrooms, topped with a slice of provolone cheese, and zapped in the microwave for a few seconds to melt. Really good!  It doesn't get much easier than this and I'll definitely make it again.

This was absolutely wonderful!!  So easy and the flavor was great.  I used a rump roast, for less fat.  We had it on hoagie rolls and then, with the leftovers, I made enchiladas.  Wasn't too sure about pepperoncinis in enchiladas but they turned out to be the best we've had.

If I could give this 10 stars I would!  I was a little worried about the amount of heat from the peppers, so I almost passed on this recipe.  But, I am so glad I went for it anyway.  This turned out absolutely delicious.  It was moist, tender and the flavoring was perfect.  I made it into sandwiches with provolone, caramelized onions and a few of the peppers all toasted in the oven.  Who would have thought that something so absolutely "simple" would be so outstanding.  This will definitely be put into my rotation!

Absolutely excellent!  I prepared the beef, slightly thickened the juice and the first night, served it over cooked rice.  The second night we had it on rolls as pictured.

This was FANTASTIC!  I made it just as the recipe says.  Thought it may be to much heat but we loved it.  I put it on crusty rolls, sprinkled with mozzarella and popped them in the oven to melt the cheese.  YUMMY!

Originally used this exact recipe.  Have since changed from chuck roast to sirloin tip roast.  I cut roast in thirds and sprinkle 1 to 2 packs of dry zesty italian dressing all over roast.  I place in crockpot and pour entire contents of pepperoncini jar over roast.  Once roast is done, I shred it and pour liquid from crock pot over meat.  Serve on hoagie buns with swiss cheese  (Freezes well).

I have been making italian beef this way for quite sometime. If I have an onion and green or red pepper I'll add that too.  My family loves them!  Its great to make for a football party etc.   All the work is done ahead of time.  Sometimes my boys love when I serve the beefs on garlic bread with melted cheese. Yum. Freezes well too.

I make this a little differently.  I use half a jar of pepperoncini's  and half a package of dry Good Seasons Italian dressing.  A whole jar makes it a little too spicey for my 12 year-old daughter.  Adding the dressing takes this from good to great.

This is a great easy meal especially or crowd pleaser for parties.  I do mine a little differently. Needed items 2 cans beef broth, 1 jr pepperoncini, 1 3 lb rump roast.  In crock pot, put roast, beef broth and pepproncini juice. (May need to add some water to cover all the way.) Cook on low overnight.  A few hours before serving shredd the beef and add the remaining pepproncini pieces.  Serve as shown with hoagie rolls and cheese. My family likes a little bbq sauce as well.

This is a great, simple Friday night dinner.  I didn't get started until 2:30 in the afternoon, so I took my chances on cranking the crock-pot to high and cooking for 3 1/2 hours.  At 6, I took the roast (1.5 lb. London broil) out, shredded it, and put it back in the pot for a half hour on low.  I'm sure it's best after cooking on low all day, but we liked it this way just fine! I love the kick the pepperoncini gives to it.  I did look at a few reviews and add some water, onion, and Worcestershire sauce to the pot.  I also browned my roast before throwing it in, and we ate it on hoagie buns with pepperjack cheese.  Thanks for the recipe!

Holy cow, was this good!  Here's my tip:  cook that bad boy alllllllllllll day........  The longer it sits in the vinegary pepperoncini juice, the softer the meat becomes.  It does go through a "dry spell" -- push on.  You haven't overcooked it; you've undercooked it.  Keep it in the pot.    Also, to the genius who recommended making fajitas the next day from leftovers:  Thank you!  Amazing, amazing, amazing!

Was pleasantly surprised how simple and tasty this turned out. We served the meat in big, chewy sub type rolls. I liked mine with the roll soft and quickly dipped into the watery sauce. Kids liked theirs with melted cheese that I laid on top, and did a quick oven broil.

This is an awesome recipe!  It is probably one of the easiest dinners I have ever made.  I put the roast, pepperoncinis, & garlic in the crockpot in the morning before church and it was done just in time for dinner at 5.  My family raved about all the flavor it had.  I didnt and wouldnt change a thing.  I have 4 kidos, from ages 6 to 17 and they ALL loved it.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a monthly staple in our house.  I throw it in the crockpot before work and it sits for 12 hours.  Toast the buns, add cheese and a quick salad and dinner is done.  I always use a 3 to 4 lb roast and use the rest for other recipes.  Meat can go in salads, in quesadillas or tacos and as a pizza topping.  I usually get at least three meals out of this.  (Note -only feeding two adults and one toddler but recipe is easily doubled.)  Also, wait untill the roast goes on sale or buy one get one free and it decreases your costs even more.

So easy and so yummy!  We put the meat/peppers on hoagie buns, cover with provolone and broil for a few minutes to melt the cheese and toast the buns.  Delicious!

Alot better than what I expected.  While it was cooking, I didn't think it would come out as great as the reviews stated.  But once I placed the meat onto french bread, laced with provolone and american cheese, slightly broiled, it was fabulous.  Next time I will make more....we are a family of 5 and it was barely enough for all of us that I had to spread the meat thin so as to have enough (and 1 of my children is 8 and eats small portions).  It's a KEEPER!!

This is amazing! My husband and I both loved it and will make it often! We made sandwiches on a Ciabatta bun, which was a little too much bread. When we make it again we will probably serve it on a pita, or as a Roast with some veggies on the side. It is so good by itself, putting it on a sandwich is just almost a crime! Thanks for this excellent, EASY recipe!

Not that good, taste the vinegar and that was all. Meat was very tender though. I won't make again.

This was certainly different.  It was pretty good on sandwich rolls but after a few I was tired of the flavor and felt it would have been better with a traditional beef broth flavor instead.  Plus after putting the entire contents in the crockpot, it became a hassle with the stems getting mixed in with the beef.  Don't think I will be making this again.

WOW!  This was absolutely amazing!  When I first told my BF what I would be making, he made a face at me, and not a nice one.  Well, he LOVED it.  The biggest roast I could find was about 2-1/2 pounds.  I took other reviewers suggestions and I sliced about a 1/2 of a large yellow onion (will use the whole thing next time) and about 3/4 of the jar of 16 oz peppers (will use the whole jar next time) and about 1 cup of beef stock (will keep that the same).  I cooked it on low on the crock pot for about 6 hours and during tasting of the broth thought it was way too hot.  After 6 hours, I took it out and removed the fat and shredded it all up (it was like butter!) and tasted the actual meat instead of the broth.  It didn't have too much taste and then I was worried.  So I put it all back in the crock pot and let it all stew together for another 2 hours or so.  WOW... it was amazing on split hoagie rolls that I toasted under the broiler first with butter, garlic powder and a small shake of parm cheese then layered the bread with swiss and provolone cheese and the meat and put back under the broiler for just a sec, maybe 30 seconds.  My bf is in HEAVEN. He actually put s/p on it even though I told him not to (he puts it on everything) and he said he would not touch it again.  HUGE compliment.  Great tasting, super easy and super cheap.  My kind of meal!!!  Will make this ALOT.

Loved it. I served it with pasta salad on the side for opening day game night! (It must have been lucky because we won!)I sprinkled the roast with salt, pepper and italian seasoning and then followed the directions exactly. It was perfect. My little ones thought it was a bit spicy, so I may substitute some of the peppercini liquid with water or broth next time if kids are eating it. Although they still gobbled it all up! Thanks so much for this new recipe, I know we will use it often.

Very good.  I don't like spicy food at all, therefore I take off the stems and pull out the majority of the seeds before putting them in the pot.  :)  Everyone loves this, and I'm making it again for a b-day at the middle school where I work. :)  I can't wait!

Wow!, it just doesn't get any easier or better than this. What a great dish to have sitting in the slow cooker on a cold winter day or on the sideboard at any gathering such as having friends over to watch a ballgame. I added one cup of beef broth mixed half-and-half with au ju concentrate just to make it a little beefier but there is really no need to do this. The peppers are not hot at all and adds just the right amount of spice. On a sub roll topped with provolone and mozzarella cheese it tastes like a really, really good Philly steak sandwich. This one is a keeper!

This is really good!  And for those who fear spiciness, this isn't spicy at all.  More like just tart.  It's a nice change up from a standard BBQ sauce roast beef sammich or au jus.

This is one of our very favorite recipes; I've made it often since discovering it two years ago. It couldn't be easier and it's so good! I serve it on toasted kaiser rolls with melted pepperjack or provolone. Thanks so much! :)

I made this yesterday, added a sliced onion in the bottom of the crock pot and sprinkled dry italian dressing packet on top. Served on sub rolls, put it under the broiler with some smoked provolone cheese. Delicious! Thanks for the recipe!

I loved this recipe.  I changed to a whole jar of banana pepper rings and added a sliced onion.  I served it with provolone cheese.  We toasted the sandwhiches under the broiler before serving.  It was very good.  There is a lot of juice left in the end that was great poured over the top of the sandwhiches.  I will definitely make this one again.
Thank you for the post.

This is so easy to make and tasted pretty good.  This is not a roast to be eaten plain on your plate - there's a very strong pepperoncini flavor.  But in a sandwich, the strength of the flavor was perfect.  I won't make it again, but it was fun to try something different.

Very good but VERY spicy.  We couldn't handle too many peppers on the sandwiches - and we like spice!  However, the beef was incredibly tender and flavorful.  I mixed a little of the juice with some beef broth for dipping and broiled the sandwiches topped with Meunster - it was delicious!  Will definitely make again, though I may look for milder peppers.
Have to add - just used leftovers tonight in quesadillas with refried beans and cheddar cheese, cooked till crispy on the griddle, served with sour cream and salsa and it was AMAZING.  Husband couldn't stop raving!

Amazing! I have already made this twice in the last couple weeks. Both times I added concentrated beef broth for a richer beef flavor. I also inserted more garlic and added half a diced onion to the pot and then melted cheese on the toasted sandwich rolls before serving. If you want to try a spicy spin on a Philly, this is it! Highly recommended! I can understand why others have suggested using only a half of a jar, as it can be make-you-sweat spicy with a whole one.

I was really afraid to try this recipe, based on the ingredients, but the number of high ratings convinced me.  We all loved it!  I would do a few things differently next time, though:  I lined my crockpot with a roasting bag to save on cleanup, which worked fine, but made it impossible to get the 3 1/2 lb. chuck roast out in one piece.  I also used only half a bottle of banana pepper rings (the pepperocini in my stores are whole peppers with stems and seeds) and half the juice.  Next time, I would use the whole bottle.  I would also cut the meat up into big chunks before putting it in the cooker, (it's going to be shredded anyway), so that I could cut away more of the fat before cooking.  I had a hard time removing the layer of grease from the juice, and would prefer it to be a lower fat dish.  Otherwise, it was fantastic, and is now on my permanent list of favorites.

This recipe was very easy to prepare, and it smelled wonderful cooking all day. The meat was tender and juicy.  I would recommend that you add only 1/2 of the jar of pepperoncini.  The whole jar was just a bit to overpowering.  Otherwise, the sliced cheese and sub rolls were perfect!
Thanks for a great dinner.

I added 1 pkg italian dressing seasoning, 2 cans of beef broth, and 1 cup very strong coffee to this at the suggestion of a friend.  I also chopped the pepperoncini up so that it would be easier to eat.  The  result was awesome!!  We served it on buns with sliced of pepper jack cheese!!  YUM!

So simple! Who wouldve thought. I Love Spicy! But was careful due to my son. So i added 5 peppers and the juice. And It was perfect. Not spicy at all...I brought the slow cooker to a friends house. During halftime everyone made sandwiches and LOVED IT! you obviously can add your own flavors..but this recipe as is. Is simple and good!

mine was way too salty. Maybe it's because we used home pickled pepperoncinis. next time will drain the peppers and add the same amount of water that I drained out of the pint jar. We did love the flavor though.

Made this recipe for our Super Bowl Party last year. Everyone loved it!! I did add 2 1/2 jars of pepperoncinis and some sliced green pepper and a bit more garlic as well. I think this is the type of receipe if you like things a little spicer add more of course! I am making this recipe again on Saturday for my husband's birthday party! I had slices of mozzarella, pepper jack, and provolone. I told my guests to make their sandwiches add the cheese, but then put it in our toaster over for a few minutes until the cheese melted and then add their condiments. We had horseradish sauce, mayo, mustard & lettuce for an extra crunch!

This is one of our favorite sandwiches from this site.  It is so nice putting it in the crockpot and coming home and having dinner ready.  I used mini Ciabatta rolls instead of the hoagie buns this time.  Served the sandwiches with Dijon-Roasted New Potaotes, and a gelatin salad.

This was super easy, especially since my roast was mostly frozen.  I just spread minced garlic on top instead of inserting it.  We made sandwiches as pictured, and my daughter wanted them served with au jus. I will try them in the future with extra not-cooked pepperoncini, lettuce, mayo, etc.

Hmm three stars for me. Although this dish is easy and cheap to make to me it is lacking something. I did follow some other reviewers suggestions. I recently went to a gathering and a friend from chicago had made this. Hers had banana peppers and alot of au jus sauce, and wasn't such a vinegar taste. I though it was good so looked for the recipe. For mine I used pepperoncini with juice, au jus mix prepared, galic cloves, and dry italian dressing mix. It smelled off when i put it in the slow cooker. 8 hrs later i shredded the beef (it fell apart easily) smell wasn't as bad let cook for another hour. Put it on steak roll with provolone cheese. Cheese melts right away. But I am not bonkers over the taste, maybe I should have added beef broth as well I don't know. So I'm disappointed after waiting 9hrs to try this. Although, I am pregnant and what taste good one day taste rancid the next, so that might have something to do with it.

My dear darling daugher Amber made this for super bowl sunday and now I will be making for Easter Sunday.  I like to color outside the lines and not do the typical ham or lamb or ram dish for Easter meat.  She did according to recipe and did the provolone cheese and toasted buns but also made grilled onions to go on the top.  Who needs Calgon when you cn get taken away by Pepperoncini Beef.  AWESOME easy impressive and sinful!
Can I rate this a 10?

There's nothing better than tossing some meat/ingredients into the crock pot and coming home to dinner!  I followed the recipe, though I did sub jarred minced garlic for the cloves because I'm lazy.  I also added a can of beef broth to completely cover the roast.  Mr. "Sissypants" LTH deemed this "hot", but I only tasted the faintest essence of heat.  I served them on rolls w/provolone cheese toasted a few moments under the broiler.  Thanks for a great crock pot recipe, Joyce!

Made this recipe last night while I slept. [Love my crockpot (=] Several of the reviews say it's very hot. Mine is not. Very tasty. Not at all hot. Finally figured it out . . . I used Mezzetta Garlic and Dill Golden Pepperoncinis. The pepperoncinis are very tasty. It is not at all hot. I do want to try it with "regular" pepperoncinis, just to see, but my guess is I will come back to the garlic and dill. BUT, for anyone who can't handle heat, this has good flavor, but is mild.

3 ingredients, 2 steps. This came out soo good, I inhales the sandwiches. I'm not sure how this is makes 12 servings, it barely made 6 servings for the man and myself.  This is almost like a Chicago Italian beef in flavor, and the pepperoncini is soo good afterwards and the au-jus is amazingly delicious. Can't say enough about it. Got an email from the hubby and a comment after work about how incredible the sandwich is.  Next time I am going to take the pepperoncini out about half way through the cook time so it doesn't lose its structure and turn to mush.  I also saute some sliced onion in a ladle-ful of the juices for the hubby's sandwich.

EXCELLENT, made exact the first time...second time I used an ARM ROAST is has more beef flavor and less fat and is very tender when cooked this way, I added 1 cup low sodium beef broth, 1 pkg of dry "Italian" dressing mix & 1 pkg. of dry "Knorr Au Jus" and the rest of the ingredients per the recipe.  I make sure the liquid covers the meat and use additional water if needed, shredded it for sandwiches & Beef Burritios.....NOW IT'S OFF THE RICHTER SCALE !!!!

I love recipes like this!!! It was so simple to put together and even easier to cook, but so delicious! Perfect on foccacia bread with melted provalone. I wouldn't change a thing, although I used a 2lb chuck roast. The leftovers are delicious as well. This would be great to make for a party, kept in the slow cooker to keep warm, and left on the counter for guests to assemble their own sandwiches. EXACTLY what I will do during football season!

Very Tasty!! Followed exact recipe except browned the meat first, when done shredded it, and decided to put all the liquid in the refrigerator overnight so I could skim off the fat. Good move cause there was a lot!! Next day, assembled the sandwich, and poured a little of the juice over the top of the sandwich before serving. The family loved it, and I was out of the kitchen in 10 minutes. My kind of meal....Thanks for a great idea Joyce!

WOW!!! I made this recipe yesterday. It was delicious!!!!!!! I didn't make any ingredient changes, I did brown the roast in a cast iron pan after studding it with the garlic because I am a big believer in browning roasts before slow cooking them. We served it on toasted kaiser rolls with melted provolone. DELICIOUS!!!

I made this recipe again the other day, instead of beef I used a small venison roast and a small elk roast that I had. Still Delicious! A great way to deal with the gamey taste that you sometimes get Especially with sagebrush fed deer.

I added potatoes and carrots to the crock pot to make a full meal out of it. I was a little nervous about adding so many pepperoncini, so I skimped on that. Next time I will use the full amount. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

We loved this recipe!  At the beginning I added 1 Knorr's beef boullion cube dissolved in one cup of water, to a frozen pot roast, along with the garlic and pepperoncinis.  Thanks for this yummy recipe!

One of my go to favorites. I have been making this for years.  Once cooked, I shred some of the beef separate from the spicy liquid for my kids because they won't eat it otherwise (too spicy for them).  For my hubby and I, I shred the rest right into the crock pot so that the liquid gets absorbed into the meat. We always eat it on a sub roll with mayo, provolone and sauteed onions. Easy as 1,2,3 and tastes great.

I was worried that the meat would be bland, as there were no seasonings listed. I rubbed the meat with 1/2 teaspoon black pepper 1/2 teaspoon salt  1/2 teaspoon paprika 1/2 teaspoon onion powder 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme 1/2 teaspoon 1/2 teaspoon basil. I followed as directed after that. It came out SO flavorful! Nice spicy flavor

Made this today!  Isliced an onion and added it to the crockpot.  I used a 12oz. jar of pepperoncini's and a cup of beef broth.  I threw in a can of mushrooms at the end.  Put the meat, peppers, onion, mushrooms, and a slice of provolone on a roll and put it in the toaster oven on broil.  YUMMY!!!

Very flavorful but it is messy, just to warn you.  We put it on hard rolls and even some swiss cheese and it's delicious.  Great for big groups!

I added enough beef broth to cover the roast, there was not enough liquid in the jar to cover. Also added some onions. Put in on asiago focaccia rolls and broiled with provolone, with horseradish. My boyfriend went crazy over this... and brought it to work the next day, and the next!

This was so easy, yet so amazingly delicious. I put some sliced onions in the bottom of the crock pot, then prepared the recipe as written. I followed another reviewer's suggestion and, after shredding the meat, returned it to the crock pot for about an hour to increase its flavor.  The meat by itself was really good, but was even better when put on french bread rolls with American cheese.  The flavors melded together really well. My meat was a little tough, so I probably should have started it a little earlier in the day and will do so next time.  Other than that, I won't make any changes.

Good night this stuff is wonderful! My kids even loved it! I made it with sliced peperoncinis and added some beef broth for extra dipping juices. Some how managed to lose my garlic between the store and home but had 1/3 of a jar of minced garlic. I just dumped it all in and mixed it around.  Toasted BUTTERED rolls (key, so you don't get soggy bread, if you don't want it) under the broiler and then add cheese for some melty goodness. Makes super left overs!
EDIT: I have sent anyone looking for easy, tasty meals to this recipe! The meat is phenomenal in soft tacos.

It came out VERY spicy, and I used the mild ones!  My son & grandson liked it, but it was way too hot for the rest of us.  I halved the recipe, as I had a 1 1/2lb chuck steak, and added extra garlic.  I cooked on low for 6 hours and then shredded the meat as suggested in one review.  I then added strips of sweet peppers and cooked 2 more hours on low.  Next time, I will use a few of the peppers, but instead of the liquid from the pepperoncini, I'll use Beef boullion with some slivered onions and Italian herbs as the liquid.  This is more like the Chicago style and it would be served without cheese.  I do like the addition of Mozzerella though, so I would use that again.  Heat can always be added by putting more pepperoncini on the sandwich, or adding Giardenieira.

Despite my husband being upset earlier in the day that I was making roast beef (he doesn't like how fatty and gristly it can be) after taking one bite he said "wow, this is good, no not just good, this is really great!" Coming from a guy who rarely eats roast beef impressed me. I liked it alot also, though to get a tastier au jus I added one beef cube and one cup water, and also 1/4 cup soy sauce. Turned out great with lots of juice for dipping and leftovers....

This was so-o-o good.  Used only 12 oz pepperoncini.  Cooked in crock pot 10 hours.  Absolutely delicious!  Intended to have some left over for quesadillas . . . Nothing left.  Had some leftover sauce to which I added 1/2 lb shredded roast beef from deli.

I have made a similar version of this recipe using Chuck Roast, Beef Broth, sliced onions, 1 pkg. of Good Seasons Dry Italian Dressing and 1 can of beer (any kind).  Throw in the oven for 3 hours, remove and clean out the fat, return to oven for another hour.  Remove, shred, and serve on buns with desired garnishes.  Fabulous with horseraddish sauce.  Thanks for sharing!

I guess I'm one of the few who doesn't like this.  My friend did, so I'm giving it a 3.  I thought it was too vinegar tasting from the pepper juice.  The meat was very tender though.  If I made it again, I'd drain the juice and use beef broth or some other liquid and spices.  But I don't think I'll make it again.  I threw out the leftovers because the vingegar taste was even stronger the next day, and I never throw away leftovers.  I really do like vinegar, but I've learned I don't like my meat cooked in it.

We used a lean round roast and cooked on low for 6 hrs. The beef had a hint of the pepperoncini flavor and shredded easily. It had much more flavor and kick after I shredded and put back in the cooker for 2 hrs. Lack of initial flavor may have been due to the choice of roast. Regardless, we enjoyed the sandwiches but I don't believe it's intended to be a "roast" so that use would perhaps be disappointing. Served on toasted rolls with mozzarella,the peppers,and carmelized onions. Will also be great in tacos,burritos,etc.

LOVE this recipe.  It could not be any easier.  Be sure to use fresh rolls because you want to sop up the juice!  I've used Mozzarella and Provolone on top and both are great.  I freeze small portions to pull out later and it freezes well also.  Scrumptious!

Fantastic!  I've made this with a few different cuts of meat, and it turns out delicious every time.  I serve it on french bread, often with mozzarella or provolone, sometimes by itself.  The family loves it either way.

Excellent! I did add a cup or so of beef broth while cooking to add some au jus for dipping. Put meat on hoagie rolls, topped with sliced provolone & broiled in oven to melt cheese/toast bun. Family gobbled it all up - even my picky 12 year old eater (note: a little spicy)

This is a great dish!  I do cut off the stems of the pepperoncini before putting them into the crockpot.  I toasted up hoagie buns, put on an ample amount of meat and provolone cheese and then toast that under the broiler until bubbly.  It is really good!

I absolutely LOVED this beef!  My husband (who is NOT a pepper eater and was skeptical of the pepperoncinis) was completely blown away by how good it is!  I put it on hoagies with jack cheese and broiled for a few minutes for a toasty, gooey, delicious sandwich!  Will make again and again!

I first saw this recipe in a low carb cookbook.  Couldn't believe it was so easy and GOOD!  Don't be afraid of the heat of the pepperoncini, they mellow out.

Overall pretty good! We made as directed with the addition of an onion added to meat, and I cooked in the oven- crock pots creep me out- I didn't find the meat too spicy at all! Nor did my 2 year old. We used the mild peppers...thanks for sharing

This was great!  I made this as written, but when I did a taste test after 6 hours in the slow cooker it wasn't very spicy.  So, I added 1/2 jar jalapeno slices with juice.  That did the trick!  This turned out great for subs.  We even used the dripping as Au Jus, but we LOVE spicy!

Delicious. Made just as the recipe stated. Definately get some provolone cheese put in on the bread and put in the broiler. So tender it didn't need any mayo. Kids gobbled it up.

This is certainly not bad. It's not the most flavorful recipe like this that I've ever had, either, however. Beef broth or Italian dressing mix or Ranch dressing mix (dry) or au jus mix would have added a much needed flavor component. There just wasn't enough going on here flavorwise, though we did like what the pepperoncini add. Thanks for the recipe :)

I added 1/2 cup beef broth and some beef base to the beef in crockpot and the whole jar of pepperoncini. Put a slice of provolone cheese on the open sandwich and placed under the broiler to melt the cheese. Absolutely delicious!

Just ate this tonight. I thought it was good once it was made into a sandwich. The meat tasted like a roast but with a kick from the pepperoncini. It wasn't as hot as what some other people said. I toasted hoagie buns buttered the top slice and put some garlic salt on it. Added the meat and the pepperoncinis, topped it with provolone and put it under the broiler till it melted. It was really good then. I ate it with cold pepperoncinis also. My boyfriend told me I need to make it next week.

omg.  I have never reviewed a recipe before, but this one deserves it.  It was amazing.  The only thing i did was add a little salt and pepper.  I served it on slider buns for my kids with provolone melted in the broiler.  It was a little spicy for them and next time I plan to try mild banana peppers, but the pepperoncinis were perfect for my husband and I.

Great just as the recipe is written! However, I made this a second time and added a packet of taco seasoning which was also delicious gave it some extra kick!

It's hard not to love a recipe that's so easy and gives you a great end product! We love spicy dishes but didn't find this as spicy as I thought it would be, based on some reviews. It was actually pretty mild, though maybe it's because we used the mild pepperoncinis.  About an hour before dinner I shredded it all so it could "marinade" in the juices, it really helps get that flavor throughout all the meat & makes it less dry. After tasting it I wanted to give it a little more something so I threw in quite a few big splashes of worcestershire sauce. It complimented it well & I actually preferred it this way. It gave it more dimension.  We made sandwiches, buttering hoagie rolls & grilling them on the stove top. Then heaped the meat & peppers on (added some extra juice from the pot too), topped w/some pepper jack & put them under the broiler for a minute. Perfection!

Fabulous!  So easy and full of flavor!  I put my roast in the crockpot still partially frozen and threw the garlic & pepperoncini's on top.  Cooked it onl low for almost 10 hours while I was at work.  The meat was so tender.  Makes great sandwiches!  I spread a little bit of mayo on the bun, then added the meat mixture and a slice of provolone cheese.  I threw them under the broiler for a bit to toast the bread & melt the cheese.  Definitely a keeper!

This is my first time to rate/review any recipe, but I just had to add my "5-Star" rating to this one!  It has become an old standby for me.  Sometimes I add sliced onions and au jus to the liquid as has been suggested by other viewers.  Any leftovers I freeze in the liquid and it's wonderful to have on hand.  This recipe has lots of possibilities as I often use it as a base for casseroles using noodles, spinach, mushrooms, etc.  Thanks Joyce for a real winner!!!

This was so good!! I didn't do anything differently, except add some beef broth so the meat was covered. It turned out with just the right amount of spice. Served it on hogies. What a simple and excellent recipe!

TASTY!!! I didn't have any pepperoncini's so I added a jar of homemade banana pepper rings, exceptional. Not to hot but lots of flavor. Will try again with pepperoncinis and see if there is a difference.

i don't eat beef so im going on reviews from my husband and a friend but this did not go over well in my house. My husband said it just tasted "weird" and the friend thought it was basically just a pot roast sandwich and just "okay". Sorry i couldn't give more of a helpful review.

How could this NOT be worth 5 stars?!!  Delicious.  I used sliced pepperoncinis, and slightly more garlic (about 4 heaping Tbsp. of minced from the jar), plenty of Oregano and freshly grond black pepper.  My roast was 5 lbs., I wish I would have trimmed the fat off, but was in a hurry to get to work.  Put them under the broiler with Pepper Jack (cheddar for DH) and served with creamy horseradish sauce!  Tonight I will skim off the fat and make Au Jus for dipping.  Next time, I will add sliced onions to the crock pot.  Thank you Joyce, for a wonderful recipe - def. a keeper!

Excellent.  I did have to make a couple of changes.  I used a 1.5 lb chuck roast and a 1.5 venison roast, which actually worked out well.  (Venison is pretty lean so this cut down on the amount of fat.)  Also, I started this in the slow cooker, but then the power went out, so I cooked the meat over low heat on my gas stove.  By dinner time, it was so tender and falling apart that I didn't even have to shred it.  We served the meat on rolls with mozzarella cheese and stuck it under the broiler for a few minutes.  I will be making this again.

This is so good, and easy since it just cooks away in the slow cooker all day. Waiting to eat it is the hard part! Don't forget to dip your sandwiches in the au jus - that's what makes the recipe. I added one can of beef broth at the beginning since other reviewers complained the meat was too dry. The broth also cut down the vinegar flavor of the au jus which some had complained about. Other modifications included adding a bit of parsley, oregano, basil, and dried minced onion. Also, I trimmed the chuck roast well before cooking since it contained a lot of fat. Even after doing that, I still skimmed a thick layer of fat off the au jus after it cooled in the fridge. Last - you'll definitely want to chop up the pepperoncinis before adding them to the pot! Enjoy!

I made this for the first time several years ago.  It's very good and makes excellent sandwiches with toasted bread and provolone cheese.  I buy the jars of already-sliced pepperoncini.

As is, I give this one four stars.  It's very good but needs onions either cooked in with the meat and peppers or grilled and added on before broiling.  We didn't find the pepperoncinis to be too hot at all.  They really give the meat a nice flavor.

I did make this with a pork roast (not beef) because that is what I had.  It came out moist and my company enjoyed it!  The pepperocini did disappear during the cooking time, but you could still taste them and they gave a nice flavor to the meat. We made the sandwiches and had them with green salad and chips.

Yum, this was so good!  I thought it had plenty of flavor.  I love the ease of the recipe too.  You can't beat that!  I made it as written except I minced the garlic and sprinkled it on top of the meat instead of slicing and inserting into it.   Served on toasted rolls with provolone that I broiled for just a few minutes to melt the cheese.  Fantastic!

I topped the beef with one sliced green pepper and one sliced onion before pouring the pepperoncini over. It was tangy & just a little spicy - very good!

My husband loved this dish but I thought it was a little bland.  Lots of heat, but lacking in flavor.  Perhaps my taste buds were burned out.  I will make it again but next time I will use half of the juice and add some beef broth and seasonings.

I made this last night after getting the recipe in my email. I love it, and have gotten rave reviews from everyone I fed it to. I took the dry salad dressing and rubbed it over the meat and put it in a ziplok bag overnight, just the right amount of seasoning for this recipe. If you want to serve something quick (minus the cooking time) and easy to guests, this is definately the recipe. I served it on crusty bakery rolls and it was the best.

I think the chuck roast is too fatty for this recipe. I have always made this with any type of butt beef roast, that is the way the recipe was given to me. We love it.

A similar recipe has been in our family for many years. I use a roast, the liquid in a large jar of pepperocinis. I toss in 3-4 pepper. I let this cook all day then when the meat is falling apart, mix a packet of Au Jus per the directions and add to the pot. While that simmers, I slice two loaves of crusty bread, butter on side and very lightly sprinkle with garlic. Those go in to the oven for a few minutes to toast then the sandwiches are served open-faced with mashed potatoes! This always a success and so easy

My family has been making this for years with a few modifications.  We call it Italian beef. We use the chuck roast, the same peppers and garlic but also add Italian spices and cover it with one can of beer and cook it in the slow cooker.  I like mine a little spicier so I will sometimes add hotter peppers.

This is good, but I have a similar recipe that I like better. It's basically the same but you sprinkle a package of Good Seasons Italian Dressing over the meat & peppers, pour a beer over the whole thing and cook it in the slow cooker all day. Makes really yummy sandwiches!

The flavor on the beef was great. I do not like spicy food, but my husband does, so I made this for him. I liked it and was able to eat a sandwich without it being too hot, but was too hot for my 2 year old. I also made these by shreding the meat and placinfg it back in the crockpot for the last hour of cooking then placed on lightly butter hoagie buns and broiled with a slice of mozzerella cheese-Great recipe! Thanks!

I have made this many times and am asked for the recipe each time.  I do season the meat with some garlic powder, Accent and pepper before I put it in the crock pot.  I used the sliced pepperoncini so I don't have to pick the stems out at the end.  I LOVE THIS!!!

These made awesome mini subs for appetizers during an afternoon of watching football.  Like others, I added provolone cheese, melted under the broiler and made a dressing of mayo and horseradish.  YUM, yum, yum.

Seriously awesome. Total 5.  I like more garlic, and lots of pepper with any beef, so I added those with the pepprocini. It seemed dry-ish, so I dumped in a can of beef broth, too. We had this sliced thin, like some kind of delicious Italian-French Dip, with sweet/hot cherry peppers, sauteed onions, on toasted Italian bread, and provolone cheese melted on it.  Definitely going into heavy rotation!

Oh my Gawd!!! This was amazing!!! I put it in the slow cooker when I went home for lunch and by the time I got home the whole house smelled so good! This was so easy to make too! I thinly sliced about half an onion and sauteed it with the roast. Then I dropped everything into the cooker added the jar of pepperoncini's and away we went! YUMMY! When I came home from work I sauteed the other half of the onion with some portobella mushrooms, and shreded the meat. To serve this I used french rolls, filled with meat topped with onion mushroom mixture, some mozarella cheese and put it under the broiler to toast up. DA'LICIOUS!!!! My family ate it all up! The following day I came home for lunch and put the little bit of leftovers in flour tortillas with cheese! Also very DA'LICIOUS! I passed on the recipe to my girlfriends and my mother-in-law! Awesome recipe!!!!Thank you so much for sharing! Tip* If serving on rolls you may want to run them under the broiler for a few minutes to toast them up so they aren't soggy from the juice. Try buttering them lightly and sprinkle with garlic powder!~

Awesome recipe!  The whole family loved it!  I added a can of beef broth because I was worried the pepperoncini may be too strong after I got a whiff of it.  (I had never had it before.)  But it turned out fabulous!  And SO easy.  I can't wait to make it again!

I have made this recipe many many times but never rated it. It is so easy and everyone I serve it to asks me for the recipe. Last time I made it I added 2 beef bullion cubes and served the juice along side to dip the sandwiches in. Soooo good!!

Yum, Yum and Yum!  Only thing I did differently was to cover the bottom of my crock pot with sliced onions and then sear the roast before adding it.  Threw the meat into some hoagies along with some extra peppers and onions and then provolone cheese before broiling for about 5 minutes.  Delicious, and leftovers were even better.  Thanks!

This gets 4 stars for ease of preparation, and 3 1/2 stars for taste/flavor-- to cut back on fat I used an eye round roast, I used 4 nice sized cloves of garlic, and all the peppers. Midway thru cooking I turned the roast over so it would soak in the juice on all sides. the edges of the meat had a nice spicy flavor but the rest of it was kind of bland. I served it on toasted hard rolls, and topped it with carmelized onions (2 onions thinly sliced cooked in 2T oil until brown then add 1 1/2 T sugar in last 2 minutes of cooking) peppers from the roast, and mozzerella cheese then broiled in the oven until the cheese was bubbly--we enjoyed the sandwiches this way but everyone agreed it needed the onions to really give it some flavor. It was so easy I would definetely make it again--I will probably try some of the other variations such as beef broth and italian seasonings to see if it adds more flavor.

I thought that this was okay but I don't think I would make it again.  I know I'm in the minority here.  My meat turned a green color on the outside but when I sliced it there was a nice pink on the inside and my peppers were a little soggy.  The people I served it to said it was "okay" and I think that it what I thought as well.  I do love how easy it was.

Terrific-ly easy!  My sister in law has this same recipe, except hers calls for a 5-7 pound roast!  So obviously there is room to increase it if needed for large parties.  (If you use more beef, you will get less juice.)  I love to use the leftovers from this (especially the ample juice) for making tortilla soup, such as Six Can Chicken Tortilla Soup - substitute the beef leftovers for the broth, chunk chicken and chile peppers that the soup recipe lists. Just great, twice!

This was OK, but not anywhere near as wonderful as I had anticipated from some of the reviews. We thought it was spicy enough, but not as rich and terrific as other Italian beef we have had.

This is GREAT!  I have made this many times.  I cook my roast on low for about 8 hours.  Serve with sauteed sliced mushrooms and bell peppers on top of the sliced roast and a couple slices of provolone cheese.  I then pour a few tablespoons of the juices (the best part) over the roast and serve.  Can't get enough of the juices!  I serve the pepperonci's on the side and I like to slice mine up and eat it with the roast.  A winner in our house.  My husband and I don't mind having it over and over again.  Even the 3 year old enjoys it.   YUMMY!

I first found this recipe on another site.  I like the easy of preparation.  I do make it the day before, chill it, remove all fat, and reheat.  Although it makes wonderful sandwiches, I usually just serve it with sides of rice and vegetables.

This recipe was OUTSTANDING! I baked hoagys with the dough from Italian Bread recipe 1. I split the buns and toasted them in butter and then served the meat on them. I also sliced an onion very thinly and topped the beef with that before putting in the slow cooker. My husband and his brother couldn't stop raving about it.

I used 1/2 jar of pepperocinis as was recommended.  Served by shredding meat, placing on homemade tortillas and covering with pepper jack cheese and fresh salsa.  Added more cheese on top and baked at 350 degrees in oven until cheese was melted.  Serve with sour cream.  Awesome shredded Beef Burritos!

YUM YUM YUM!  Everyone loved this, inculding my seven year old.  I took others advice-put this on a sourdough hoagie rolls the topped with red onions, some of the sliced pepperoncini, and then the cheese.  Placed this under the broiler until the cheese melted. Will make this over and over.

My husband did not like the flavor of the beef. It was a bit vinegary. No one would eat the leftovers. I thought it was ok, but will not make it again.

This was really good. My family loved it. At first glance though I thought it said "pepperoni" so I bought that then had to go back for pepperoncini and so I added both. I used pistolette breads and buttered the insides then layered pepperoni provolone, beef, mozz, then pepperoncini and baked for 10 minutes, Yum. 
Thank You for sharing

I thought that this was great.  Very tender and juicy.  I seared it first in a frying pan to keep the flavor of the meat in.  I threw in the crockpot with the jar of pepperoncini's and went to school.  When I came home, it had filled the house with wondeful smells.  I had it with mashed potatoes and brocolli.  YUMMY!  My husband loved it too.

WOW! This was an amazing success! SOOOO Easy! I have made this for friends and family and EVERYONE loved it! Great for kids and adults!
I serve the shredded beef on hoagie rolls & I put the split rolls & a slice of havarti cheese under the broiler until browned.
I usually shred the beef & separate into two bowls. Then I add the juices it was cooked in. Alot of juice for those who prefer spicy, and only a little for the ones who prefer mild.

My whole family loved this it was tender and tangy! I used it as the main dish with only a few variations I added some flour and a packet of augus seasoning to the pereroncini juices after I took out the roast and it made a wonderful gravy!
                 5 stars!

This was soooo good and soooo easy!  Had to mark down on quickness *only* because pulling the beef does take some time, and I cut my cooked roast in half so as to have shorter meat "threads" since my roast was very thick.  I cooked, then chilled in fridge overnight so I could pop off the solid fat.  Even the kids liked it!  The pepperocinis add a wonderful flavor without adding very much heat.  Peppers can be added on the sandwich before serving.  A definite keeper for me!

I  have made this for years, ever since Don Wade on WLS in Chicago raved about it. The only things I would add are:

1. Remove the stems from the pepperoncini before eating.  No one wants to chomp on wood.
2. You need way more garlic than this, and not powdered garlic or salt, either. I use a whole head of garlic in mine
3. Throw in a sliced yellow onion
4. About an hour before you're done, throw in a sliced green pepper
5. A tsp of Lawry's Seasoned Salt helps.
6. Use the cheapest cut of meat available to you. The liquid from the pepperoncini is going to break down all the fibers and make it so freaking tender.
7. Cut your meat into large chunks before you put the garlic in. That way the liquid will infuse through all of it and not just the meat on the outer edges of your roast.
8. Butter your hoagie rolls with a little garlic butter and toast for a minute or two. Huge bonus!

This was full of flavor for the simple ingredients required.  I didn't change a thing - except I added the meat to the bread, with the cheese on top and toasted it for about 5 min.  Will definitely make this again and again!  Next time I will add some onions and maybe some mushrooms.

Very, very underwhelmed. The beef was very one note and missing some seasoning. I loved the simplicity but this did not awaken my palette. Bland. I would not make this again.

Amazingly good recipe! It was simple, easy and definitely will become a regular meal in our house now! I followed the recipe but also added a sliced onion and green bell pepper to the bottom of the slow cooker. I drained the meat, peppers and onions from the juice and used the juice as a dipper for my sandwich (I told my husband I was pretending it was au jus).

My version is a little different.  I don't use the whole jar of pepperoncinis with juice as it is too spicy.  I add a can of beef broth and two packets of dry Italian seasoning.  Cook for 8-10 hours on low.  Then I shred the meat and you have a great Italian beef sandwich!

This "Pepperoncini Beef" gets 5 stars from me just for being the perfect comfort food and "busy day" meal. I added onions for my husband, and served my "beef, peppers, and sauce" with mashed potatoes since I am both dairy and grain intolerant (no cheese-covered sandwiches for me!). This meal gives me a "warm and fuzzy" feeling like the meals prepared with love by the women's auxiliary at church (good food plain enough for universal appeal). I will definitely make this again. Thank you Joyce for sharing your recipe.

My husband absolutely loves this.  We used to make it with just the pepperoncini peppers, but we both agree that adding the garlic makes it even better.  Possibly even cuts out some of the tang of the pepperoncinis.  Everyone asks us for the recipe and are shocked out how easy this is.  I wish all meals could be as tasty and easy to make as this one!

The only thing we did different was use jarred minced garlic.  I left instructions for the man to do this while I was gone. This is officially our favorite easy peasy dinner!  My boys went guano over this.  It was a three pound roast.  There are three of us.  There is none left.

My husband wanted Italian beef sandwiches but my son suggested the Pepperoncini Beef. I'm so glad he did!  So easy & so delicious!!! Making them again for my other son & his family today.  I know they'll love them as much as we do.  It's my new favorite "go to" for parties & get togethers!!!

Made Exactly, Tasted just like Steak-ums bought from "Food City", With a barbeque pork texture and consistancy. Thank You, now I don't have to buy Steak-ums from the store again.

I was a little worried that it might be too spicy for my mom but it was not. Amazing, the pepercini's give it a really nice taste! I did add a little more spices (garlic, black pepper) My youngest son and his friend had a sandwich after school (the meat was done by 4pm) and they asked for another but I had to hold them off because we were having it for dinner. My son had another sandwich at dinner and then he and his friend had another sandwich the next day after school(it made more than I thought). I will definitely make this again!

This is my go to recipe for a crowd that needs variety.  It has such a wonderful flavor!  And, I can throw this together and let it cook while preparing the rest of the menu.  Of course, I add mozzo, pepperjack or provolone to the sammies because everything is better with the cheese!

I followed the recipe as is. I've made it several times and my teenage boys love it.  We put them on sub/hogie/sasauge rolls with some provolone cheese. The only thing I would recommend is removing the stems from the pepperoncini beforehand, it makes serving easier.

Have made this a few times & we all love it!  It's a nice change from the french dips I usually make.  We top ours with the pepperoncini's, sliced tomatoes, provolone cheese & mustard.  Have even substituted the chuck roast with a london broil that I had on hand.  It worked well! Excellent, simple recipe!

Delicious and easy!  I toasted hoagie rolls then added the meat and toasted provolone on top.  My son is super picky and wont eat anything.  I left the pepperoncini's off his sandwich and added some honey mustard and he loved it.  My husband and I added lettuce and tomatoes and the pepperoncicni's.  I think this will be a new fave to come home to after football games!

Wow, this was excellent.  I sliced an onion, separated into rings, and placed in bottom of cooker with three smashed garlic cloves. Placed beef on top, poured 12 oz jar of whole pepperoncini around roast.  Dissolved 1 packet Goya beef bouillon in 1 cup of water and poured over all.  Cooked 8 hours, turned roast over (shredding what I could), and submerged for another 2 hours in liquid.  Everyone, including my Italian husband who doesn't like pepperoncini, loved it.  Served on ciabatta rolls.  Excellent, excellent, excellent.

After making this almost regularly I feel like I should review it. A lot of people have their own special way to make this, it seems. I don't think it's necessary to add or change a thing! To make it even easier, I don't even dice up the garlic and put it into the beef. I've added a few garlic cloves to the juice from the pepperoncinis and called it good a few times and it's just as delicious. Ingenious and easy - which is great for a gluten-free family!

This was like so many other reviews have said- amazing! The flavor was excellent and even if the taste had been a four-star, the simplicity of this recipe alone would have bumped it to a five. As it is, no bumping necessary. We kept it simple and served it over french rolls we'd buttered and broiled with provolone. After 8 hours I pulled the roast out to rest for about 5 mins then sliced/shredded it and threw it back into the crockpot for awhile. It made it even juicier without being overly liquidy. I'm planning to use the leftovers in a quesadilla tomorrow night as another reviewer suggested.

I made this recipe exactly as instructed and put the cooked meat into hoagie rolls with provolone. It had a delicious tangy flavor and even though I'm not into very spicy food, it was not too spicy for me.

I LOVE this beef!!!!!  My whole family loves it.  The best part is how many ways you can use this as left overs!  We always make steak and cheese subs and quesadillas with this beef and they are unbelievable!  I also think the steak and cheese subs we make with this beef are better than any sub shop!  I can't rave about this recipe enough. I add a sliced onion to the slow cooker.

This recipe is great and super easy.  I used a 3 lb cut of meat and a 32 oz jar of pepperoncini's.  Used all of the juice and half of the peppers.  Added a few garlic cloves to the slow cooker and put it on high when i left for work.  10 hours later I came home, drained all but 1/2 cup of the juice- added 2 cans of Beef Au jus, shredded the meat back into the slow cooker and cooked for another 30 minutes or so.  It was awesome.  Really flavorfull and so easy.

I was intrigued when I saw this recipe & was dtermined to try it.  My husband has been a very picky eater so I used the banana peppers instead of the pepperoncinis as others commented on the "bite". I was thrilled when he loooved this meal!  He said it was better than his favorite grilled sandwich at the restaurant!  Thank you so much for sharing!

Really really good! Put an onion in with the peppers and sprinkled half onion soup mix + a little extra water. ( we love onions around here) Lots of leftovers so it makes it way worth the price of the meat.  Had sandwiches twice and quasadillas With the rest. Lots of ways you could use the leftover meat. Cheese steak pizza??!

Awesome.  Simple.  I cooked pretty much as is (added way more garlic!).  It was delicious. My husband loved it.  Shredded the leftovers for tacos and nachos.

Very easy and quite delicious.  I used a 3 lb roast (frozen) and about 20 ounces of pepperoncini.  Cooked on low for about 12 hours.  It was a bit spicey but not horribly spicey.

I make this often...we call it 'Amazing Beef Sandwiches'...it's that good! I use a rump roast and sliced jarred pepperoncini (Mild). I serve it on kaiser rolls! The beef has so much flavor and just melts in your mouth! I make beef barley soup with the leftovers! This is a must try recipe!

I had 1/2 of a vidalia onion left over, so I sliced it to add and completely forgot the garlic... The meat is so moist and flavorful! (a little spicy, but tasty)  I LOVE this easy crock pot recipe! I am so excited about having leftovers and can't wait to make it again for friends.

Really, I didn't enjoy the smell all day in the crock BUT it turned out totally awesome.  It is hard to believe something so easy can be so good. Add provolone and hoagies and you have a meal.

Fantastic. Used toasted sub rolls, then melted provelone on top. The peppers were spicy but well within a reasonable range. I may try this again with banana peppers.

Very simple and delicious.  I have tried this with both hot and mild pepperoncinis, and prefer with the mild.  It is excellent with a crusty bread and provolone cheese.

This is so yummy!  I think this is better than any sandwich shop!  I've made this several times and my family prefers it when I add a cup of beef broth (to mellow the peppers but I serve extra peppers for those of us who want extra zing) and I use lots of garlic powder instead of whole cloves simply because it's easy and I always have it on hand.  I serve this on bakery rolls with swiss cheese melted under the broiler.  So so tasty.  I've also made quesadillas with this beef. I think it would also be delicious on top of a Greek style salad with feta cheese, black olives, more pepperocinis and a nice vinigrette.  Yuuummmmmmm

My niece told me about this recipe. At the time it didn't sound good to me at all, but, I was so wrong. It very easy and delicious. I have shared it with quite a few others, most all with my same reaction at first, until they try it and love it. What a different zing this roast has and so easy to put together and leave it. Thank you for sharing.

We made as directed and it was wonderful! I was hesitant about the strength of the peppers but they did mellow somewhat and when combined with the other ingredients, were delicious. What a nice, easy dinner and a good option for for a game night with friends.

This was an especially easy dish. I used stew beef because it was what I had on hand and added a little Chianti to it for good measure. I served it in rolls with Feta cheese, tomatoes and lettuce. Make sure you use rolls that can stand up to lots of juice without getting soggy.

After reading this simple recipe I just couldn't grasp what could be so raving.  It just seemed to simple to be so great.  I made this recipe yesterday, I thought about it all day while I was at work and it was at home cooking on low in the crock pot.  At one point I was thinking I won't probably like the peppers cooked so long, they would probably be slimey.  I got home the smell was amazing.  I took the meat out and started to shred it.  I tasted it and OMG amazing.  Seriously one of the best taste ever.  This recipe is so simple but yet so amazing just like most people reviwed.  We had sandwiches on a small baquette. The changes I made came from previous people.  I did add a splash of balsamic Vinegar.  I added some dehydrated onion and two builion cubes.  The rest was the recipe.  The spice to it was mild but just right.  I expected the taste to be so over powering but it wasn't at all.  I can't wait to make this again.

Ridiculously simple and amaaazingly delicious!!!!  I am not sure if I will ever want to cook a roast any other way now.  This made amaaazing sandwiches and amaaaazing quesadillas the next day.  Other than adding a large, sliced onion and minced garlic instead of sliced, I didn't do anything different and don't think I ever will.  THANK YOU for this amaazing idea!

This was good. I am not a huge fan of chuck roast so I think I will try using pork or chicken next time. For those who don't handle spicy foods well, I suggest only adding half the jar of peppers and juice. If you find it too spicy you can always dilute with water to tone it down for your tastes. We enjoyed the spice, but we can handle the heat. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I was skeptical that something with only a few ingredients would be that good, but it was.  I don't think I would like the beef just on a plate BUT served in a toasted roll with saute green peppers, onions & mushrooms with spicy mustard (didn't have horseradish) and melted pepper jack or provolone cheese was outstanding.  I cooked it just as the recipe stated but I started my roast frozen and sprinkled some McCormick Montreal Steak seasoning on top.  I didn't think it needed extra broth like some of the suggestions.  It was delish!!  I will definitely add this to my food rotation.

I have had this recipe in my recipe box for about a year now and have been skeptical to actually make it as I couldn't believe just those two ingredients could make a dish as amazing as the reviews indicated.  I was completely wrong!  I seasoned a 4 pound chuck roast with kosher salt, course black pepper, onion powder and stuffed about eight slits in both sides of the roast with minced garlic.  I cooked on high for two hours and on low for another four hours.  It was delicious!  Tender, juicy and a fantastic flavor that had just enough kick for my husband, two teenage sons and my three year old.  We ate it on french rolls with melted, smoked provolone and mayo.  I was going to make quesadillas with the leftovers as one reviewer suggested, but when I came home from work the next evening all of the "leftovers" had been devoured by the boys!  Will definitely make this over and over again.

This recipe is awesome! I used banana peppers so it wasn't so spicy for the kids and didn't add the garlic. I seared the meat first. The meat was delicious and we dunked the sandwiches in the juices! Yummy!

I used half a jar of pepperoncinis with the stems removed so it wouldn't be too spicy for my kids. It was not too spicy but still had a great hint of vinegar and peppers. Delicious on toasted bread with melted cheese.

SOOOOO good & easy!  The pepperoncini give this just the perfect amount of flavor and the meat just fell off the bone.  Pepperoncini will now be a staple in my pantry so I can toss this together any time.  Thanks for sharing!

This is so easy and delicious!  I used a venison roast b/c I have a frezzer full.  I used lots minced garlic from a jar and then sprinkled the whole roast with a roasted garlic seasoning blend before I dumped the jar of pepperocinis in.  Too spicy for my 5 year old but hubby and I loved it.  He even said that it puts my family's Italian beef to shame!

This was fantastic!  I used a slightly smaller roast and trimmed almost all the fat from it.  I didn't add the beef broth other reviews suggested because it wasn't needed.  Tender, juicy, slightly spicy meat was terrific with provolone cheese melted over the top.  I will definitely make this again.

My husband and I loved this recipe!  We took the advice of some earlier reviewers and added a can of beef broth and some onions for a little more flavor.  We made sandwhiches with it the first night and made quesidellias the next night....both were amazing!  This meat is really versatile and it has just a small bite from the peppers.  Definitely a keeper!!

This has become one of our favorite quick and easy dinners.  We don't add the garlic, although we do season the meat before we put it in the pot and add some carrots and onions to the liquid.  We don't add any liquid other than the peppers, although we use 2 jars.  We put the results on homemade rolls and some white american cheese and it is seriously the perfect dinner.

I made this yesterday and it was really good.  I removed the stems as suggested and added some chopped onion.  We think everything is better with onion.  I thought it would be spicier which we would have liked but we ended up adding some sliced jalapenos to our sandwiches along with provolone cheese.  They were delicious.  Next time I'll tweak it a little bit and add more garlic and more onions.  Possibly even some dry Italian dressing mix to make it more of an Italian beef sandwich.  It was well worth the time to make this and I'll definitely make it again.

I have been making this for over 10 years, but have been making it less often since I have switched to organic and natural foods.  The pepperoncini is loaded with carcinogenic food coloring and preservatives.  Otherewise this is a GREAT recipe.  I'm going to try to jar my own pepperoncini this year and boy will we be in food heaven.

This is a great, really simple recipe! My family loved it, but the next time I make it, I'll take the time to cut the tops with stems off all the peppers before adding them to the crock pot. They never cook down and it's a pain picking stems out of your sandwich -- it will just simplify everything.
Thanks for the post ... it's a keeper.  D- at the Lake

This was outstanding. I also added one envelope of onion soup mix to give a little bit of seasoning and extra flavor. I served as an open faced sandwich with horseradish and grainy mustard. Great recipe!

I thought this was easy & tasty.  I recommend it and will make it again!  I used 2.3 pounds of London Broil.  Next time I will definitely use 3 pounds of meat so we'll have more.  I did not find the recipe greasy like one of the reviewers said, possibly because of the less fatty London Broil.  I used chopped garlic instead of sliced because that's what I had on hand.  I also removed the stems from the pepperoncini's before cooking.  We didn't find it very spicy, just a nice amount of pep.

AMAZING! My husband and I loved these sandwiches and it was so easy to make!  I stuck to the recipe and added a few onions.  We had velveta on hand and it melted perfectly into the sandwiches. I'm sure my husband will ask me to make this again soon. Thanks!

Really nice recipe as is if you like some heat.  I didn't serve it to my adult son who just cannot take heat, but my husband and I thoroughty enjoyed it on sub rolls with melted Provolone. Another thanks to the reviewer who suggested Quesadillas from leftovers.  I amped up the heat a bit with these using spicy refried beans and medium hot salsa.  Breaking a sweat but loving it!!  Thanks for a terrific recipe

This meat has great flavor.  I definitely do not think it is as spicy as some reviewers mentioned.  I also don't think it would hurt to salt and pepper the roast before putting in the crock pot.  I originally used this to make sandwiches, and it was good that way but didn't make me shout from the rooftops or anything.  Then we used the leftovers to make quesadillas and thought they were awesome!  I just put some meat in a tortilla with shredded monterey jack and browned the outside until the cheese was melted.  Delicious!

This was surprisingly good! My husband was kinda worried when I was telling him about it. We tryed it yesterday and nothing was left. The juice gave the meat a hint of pepperoncini flavor (not over powering). I served this French Dip style with shredded mozzarella and AuJus. Very good!

So flavorful, with the perfect kick. My favorite sandwich yet!!! I used half a jar of pepperoncini instead so the kids can enjoy as well and double the garlic. Used montery jack cheese and mayo on a sub bun and WOW!!!  A must try

Man this was HOTT!! And I used a 3.25 pound roast and only 10 oz of pepperoncinis. But I'm a wuss when it comes to spicy food. It was a very delicious flavor and the husband liked it a lot. So if you like your mouth to burn...go for it!

Excellent! For those who think it is too spicy, the title says, "Pepperoncini" so it is your own fault if you think so! This is so good and easy. Especially on toasted buns with provolone cheese.

Excellent!  I made it exactly per the recipe.  Got some fresh Italian rolls from a deli and toasted them.  As suggested  I used mozzarella cheese on the sandwiches, with the pepperoncini.  Big hit!  It's got a little kick, but not too spicy.  For leftovers I spread horseradish mayo on the bread.

only change I made was to use a beef brisket.  it was a huge success with the family.  Especially using the "juice" in the crock for dipping the sandwiches in.

I followed this recipe to a tee - it was very, very good! All of my adult family members loved it, but my 2 picky teenagers didn't like the vinegary taste of the pepperoncini. Thanks!

This was very good.  My roast was on the big side so we had to add some water and cooked longer.  And this was even better the second night in quesadillas!

What an easy way to please a crowd!  This literally took minutes to trim the fat off the roast, slip the garlic slices into cuts in the meat and pour on the banana peppers.  What I loved is that I didn't have to touch this dish at all during the eight hours it cooked.  The only drawback is that it is quite fragrant while cooking, but the strong smell does not transfer to the meat.  The meat has a great balance of spicy and pure beef flavor.  I will make this a staple in my cooking!

This was surprisingly good!  I honestly thought this would be kind of weird.  I love pepperoncinis and slow cooked beef is always a winner but together?  Well this was delicious!  The meat was so tender.  I served them on wheat dinner rolls with lightly sauteed portobellos and provolone.  I like being able to add more of the sauce and some peppers if I want it spicier.  And the best part is it made leftovers.  We have now had these two nights in a row and even a day later it was very, very good.  Will definitely make this again!

This is great!  We made a spread for the sandwiches using a couple of the pepperoncinis (after cooking), some low-fat mayo, ground Italians herbs, and some fresh grated Parmesan cheese processed in a mini-food processor, and it was even better!  Leftovers freeze well, reheat gently over low heat, stirring often.

Easy and tasty! Nice and spicy.  I thought mine came out a bit dry, but still pretty good.  I used this for tacos.  I have heard that this also works very well with pork, so I may try that next time.

Yummy! I seasoned the roast with salt and pepper, browned in a large skillet, put the roast in the crockpot and deglazed the skillet with some dry, red wine and dumped it on top of the roast.  So simple, so good and so many possibilities for the leftovers!

Really good and easy.  The meat had a nice flavor.  We cooked up some red and green peppers and onions and had hot italian subs instead of using the cheese.  Yummy!

For something so amazingly simple to make, this was wonderfully good!  It was a bit too spicy for our children, but my husband and I loved it.  I cut crusty bread, brushed with olive oil and toasted.  We put the beef on the bread, covered with some provolone and put back in the oven long enough to melt the cheese.  SO Good!!!

4 stars only because I did take the advice of some other reviews and add a few things for extra flavor.  I used one giant elephant clove of garlic, 1 onion, 1/2 head cabbage and 1 package of Zesty Italian dressing mix.  Cooked on low heat for about 8 hours.

WOW!  Who would have guessed something so simple would taste so good?  We loved this recipe.  It had great flavor from the peppers but the spice was too much for our four-year-old who cleaned her plate!  Thank you for sharing this....

I absolutely love this recipe for its simplicity, ease of preparation and taste! Strongly recommend sliced provolone to finish off the sandwiches. I've also used London broil as the meat.

Ok, I made the recipe just as directed.  It was quite spicy (which we love).  Topping it with provolone and toasting the buns helped to tame down the taste a smidge.  I didn't put horseradish on it this time, but I will be next time!  This recipe isn't a RAVE one, but is super easy and I always have the ingredients on hand which is a plus.  It will get made again.  The meat is super soft after cooking for so long!  Just how we like it.

I liked this because it has the fewest ingredients, is VERY simple and always comes out great.  I used mild pepperoncini because if your not carefull this can be too spicy.

All that I have to say is, OH MY GOODNESS!!!! This was absolutely amazing and super easy. I don't have a crock pot so I just put this in a pot on the stove over low heat with a lid and cooked for about 6 hours, turning a few times, and told the boyfriend to leave the lid on unless he was turning the meat(he likes to "peak", lol). The meat was really tender and had so much flavor, but wasn't too hot. We used provolone cheese on sub buns and toasted them in the oven, YUMMY!!!! Because I made the full recipe and the Boyfriend, one of his buddies and myself were the only ones that ate I have plenty of leftovers so I'm going to make Veggie Beef soup with the leftovers. Oh I can't wait until dinner tonight!!!!!

YES!! We loved this! Havent stopped making it.  I now like to add sliced bell peppers just to add more health and flavor!  The kids complain it's a bit too spicy, but they still eat it.

This recipe is the best. I did season the meat a little before putting in crockpot and I used pepperoncini with dill and garlic. This is a must try. You wont be disappointed.

I added a can of beef broth and enough water to come to the top of the roast, just to make sure it stayed juicy. My husband usually doesn't like crockpot dishes since they can get dried out, but he LOVED this one! I will definitley make this again. Plus, it was SO easy!

This recipe was excellent! The whole family liked it and spiced it up with their own likings; husband put mayo & tomato. Tomato is very good on this. Toasted the bun with the cheese on the bun then put on meat with tomato, salt & pepper- daughter used garlic. I would use cheese with a little more pep but overall it was excellent.

very good and super easy!  The meat got spicier each day in the fridge, so if you like it spicy...make and reheat a few days later!   When first out of the crockpot, my kids ate the heck out of it though!

This roast tastes great every time. I use a lean beef roast and serve it with authentic Cuban bread. Everyone that has tried it falls in love and its not too spicy.

This is one of my favorite things to make in my crockpot.  It creates a deliciously moist, flavorful roast that shreds easily for use on sandwiches, salads, wraps - you name it.  A fun variation is to use a pork tenderloin or some chicken breasts, and instead of pepperoncini's use a jar of salsa.  In any case - if you need a crowd pleaser for a party then look no further.  We serve this with the mini-bread rolls, and  a variety of salads.

This was AMAZING.  I added about 1/2-1 cup of beef broth (didn't measure) into the crockpot.  Used a jar of whole pepperoncinis which I cut up before putting into the crockpot, and used all of the juice.  Served shredded on wheat hoagie rolls with the pepperoncinis, topped with mozzarella and then put in the toaster oven a few minutes to melt the cheese.  Then topped with sauteed mushrooms and onions.  Seriously, to die for.

Amazing! Since the pepperoncini jucie doesn't fully cover the beef, I flip the beef over halfway through the cooking. I used french bread and provalone cheese and put it and the bread in the broiler.  I used the horseraddish/sour cream spread idea from another reviewer. YUM!!!

I made this today. It made the house smell wonderful. I added a big fat onion, cooked it low and slow in the oven. Unfortunately it did not taste as good as it smelled.:( I had such high hopes for it too! I made the Sammies and added crumbled blue cheese to it.This would be good with Adzell's Horseradish garlic spread on it. hubby wasn't crazy about it either and he eats just about everything! Sorry, Patty

The only thing it is missing is basil.  Years ago we had a pizza place in Mattoon, Il and they made Italian Beef Sandwiches - the best.....They used a bay leaf when cooking the beef.  I use basil because I like the sweeter taste.  But the rest is yummy...........The original recipe calls for 1/4 cup water to be cooked with the meat but I use Chuck Roast and you sure don't need the water..............

Very good recipe for sandwiches. As for some of the comments about being to spicy, we sure did not feel this was the case, in fact I was thinking about adding some cayenne pepper to it to heat it up some more.   Also, the comment about being dry, sure don't know HOW that happened, we had more than enough juice. Followed the recipe exactly, but did use some beef broth as well as the juice from the peppers. Thanks for the new addition to my collection of GREAT recipes!!!

I thought this was an excellent recipe! Nice taste to it, but wasnt spicy at all like I kept reading in the reviews. Shredded the meat then put back in juice for about 30 minutes. Served on homemade cheesy italian bread with shredded mozerella on top (put under broiler for few minutes tp toast up). Wasnt dry at all. I liked the peppers on my sandwhich too, hubby preferred w/o peppers. Used the leftovers to make green chili empanadas (food network website). Will make again for sure!!

Oh my, this was so delicious that even my picky husband went for seconds...let alone actually at left overs (which is a rare occasion for him). It was sooooo easy. I had sliced pepperocinis on hand so that's what i used. I added about one cup of prepared au jus after shredding the meat and adding some more peppers at the end too, about 2 - 3 whole peppers worth (fresh heat). I toasted the buns, topped them with the meat and placed an even layer of provolone on top, then broiled until the cheese melted. We used the remaining prepared au jus (the packet makes about 6 cups) to dip our sandwiches in. Mmmmm, Mmmmm, good!

This is absolutely delicious.  I didn't find it to be spicy at all and my 11 year old loved it also.  It's even better a day or two after it's made, it has so much flavor.  I will be making this again and again!

I was really looking forward to making this recipe as I am a big pepperoncini fan.  It was spicy and I wish the recipe would forewarn you of that fact.  And despite the spiciness of the peppers and the flavor of the garlic, it was still a tad bland for me.  We served it on hoagie rolls as suggested with melted mozzarella on top.  I added some mayo to mine to make it less dry.  I think I'll try this again, but maybe add a pack of dry Italian dressing mix to the roast to spice it up a bit more.  I'll also make sure to put more juice on my sandwich so it won't be so dry.

What a great sandwich! Made this exactly as directed. When the crockpot time was up, I shredded the meat and ladled it on sub rolls.  Then I put sliced of provolone on the meat and put the subs under the broiler until the cheese melted.  Unbelievably delicious!  I didn't put any pepperoncini on the sandwiches because I thought it would be too spicy for us.  The meat and sauce had plenty of kick in my opinion.  Tonight I am reheating the leftovers for quesadillas as a previous poster recommended.  Mmmm!  So easy and so good, I will make these often!

A very tasty sandwich for sure.  I used posters' suggestions for 1 bottle of beer, 2 beef boullion, 1 pkg dry italian dressing,and 1 1/2 onion sliced. With only jarred chopped garlic on hand, I made lots of slits and pushed in the chopped garlic. I was a chicken and used only 8 oz of pepperoncini, sliced.  I think I could go with more next time.  It took a long time to cook so it would break down.  Plan on at least 8-10 hours. Once it is shredded, put back into the pot and stir it around in the juices. Simmer for another 1/2 hour or so.  It was so juicy. Add some provolone!!  Yum!

A really nice change of pace sandwich! I used chabata rolls.  The peppers were really spicy, but I'm going to see if I can find some mild variety.  The whole tase was awsome!

we only added 4 peppers & about 1/3 juice from the bottle, for fear the kids wouldn't eat! also added a bit of red wine & a sprinkle of au juice to the crock pot. browned sweet onions & roasted peppers & added to the toasted bun with melted provalone cheese. in the "save" pile of recipes!

When it was finished cooking, I tried some from the crock pot and was honestly a little disappointed.  I thought it needed "something."  After putting it on squishy hoagie rolls with a little mayonnaise and a slice of swiss cheese--WOW!!  This is great, and it's probably the easiest thing I've ever cooked.  We'll be making this one again and again!

Good.  I toasted our buns ahead of time and then also melted the cheese in the oven after the sandwiches were made.  It was not as spicy as I was expecting, but it was good nonetheless.  Not sure if I will make again--had expected it to be bursting with flavor and it didn't.

This was tasty considering I only had pork loin. I followed the recipe exactly ( with the pork) and when I made my sandwich I added caramelized onions and saute mushrooms, prov cheese on a toasted roll. Will try nex time using beef.

My recipe is very similar to this except I sprinkle a packet of Good Seasons Italian Seasoning on top of the meat then add the pepperoncini's.  Try horseradish sauce with provolone cheese on the hoagie roll...fantastic !!

For those of you who live in a major metropolitan area, and have an Italian community, will really appreciate this dish!  It's like making an Italian Beef sandwich in giardiniera with a slow cooker.  The only thing I added to it, was toasting a French bread, and melting provolone cheese, before adding the beef.  If you don't like "spicy", you won't care for this masterpiece.

I made this for my family, changed nothing on the recipe and they loved it.  You can either slice or shread the beef, great either way.  I would definitely put if back in the juices after you cut the meat to let it soak up the flavor a little more before serving.  Great with some onion rings or french fries!

We did not care for this. To us it kind of tasted like the relish used for hot dogs mixed in with beef. We normally like eating pepperoncinis and felt this was a waste of a can. But then again neither he nor I like relish on our dogs.

This recipe is a staple in my household! Instead of inserting the garlic into the meat, I just throw it in the crock pot. I also add a sliced onion. I've used everything from rump roasts to thick sirloin steaks for this recipe, and it always comes out delicious. We make this into sandwiches, top with cheese and put under the broiler for 2-3 minutes. A favorite recipe that I've passed along to many people!

What a simple dish!!  Instead of the garlic I used a packet of italian dressing. The meat was so tender!  This is how I intend to cook the meat next time I make tamales.  Very good and so easy!

Simplicity - 5 stars - very easy to make, took me a total of 4 minutes to whip together in the crockpot before I left to go to work.  

Cost - 5 stars - $4 for the roast, $2 for the peppers.    I had the garlic.

Appearance- 5 stars

Taste - 4 stars - very strong pepperoncini taste - Loved it.  

I put on kaiser rolls with swiss cheese and broiled.  I did not need any condiments - no mayo, no horseradish, no salt, pepper, nothing.  Next time I will try provelone.  

I liked this a lot ( I had seconds), my husband liked it a little (no seconds for him) and my kiddo wouldn't try it.  But he is picky!

I have been making this recipe for a long time and substitute a packet of dry italian salad dressing in place of cloves of garlic. I like the added flavor it gives to the meat. Also remember to remove the stems from the pepperoncini's prior to pouring them  into the crockpot.

THANK YOU!  I've made this now for two years and am just now rating it.  Everyone in the family LOVES it!  We really like spicy so I also add crushed red pepper to the crock pot while cooking.  The spicer, the better.  If the roast doesn't shred after 8 hours, I take it out and cut it up in chunks and place it back in the crock pot.  Then it usually shreds on its own after about 2 more hours. Last time I made it, I accidently bought pepperoncini's with garlic and dill in the jar.  It still turned out wonderful. Thank you again!

A family favorite, great after a long hard day at work. Be sure to use crusty rolls to soak up all that tasty juice.

This was pretty good.  I used a 2 lb. roast and it took 7 hrs on low and 2 hrs on high before it got tender enough to shred.  We ate them on toasted hoagie rolls with melted provolone cheese.  On mine I had to add some horsey sauce and that just made the sandwich!  I added some onion and beef broth to make some more au jus to dip with.  These were pretty yummy.  Something different to try, but not something I would want to put in our normal meal rotation because it was kinda plain for our tastes.  But we still liked it and are sure to make it again sometime in the future.

My daughters and I have been making this for many years.. a real no-brainer to throw together and be special enough for entertaining! We add some sliced onion for use on the sandwiches. Very easy and special!

Wow, how can something so easy be so good?   We happily ate it 2 nights in a row!  I don't understand where the smoky flavor comes from but I love it. I would add a bit of extra water so I can have more dipping juices next time.

Oh my, this is good! My husband LOVED it! I added a can of beef broth to the recipe. Then we put the meat and peppers on french bread rolls and melted provalone cheese on top and dipped the sandwiches in the au jus. I will make this again often!

This was ok. Nothing to go nuts over. I followed the directions with only one small exception. I only used half the pepperoncini's called for. It was still pretty spicy. My only tip is that I thought for sure there was not going to be enough liquid in the crock pot during cooking so I added a bit of stock and it ended up being too much liquid. Dont make my mistake.  Only reason I am giving it three stars is because even though this was good, I have had many that were even better.

This was a huge hit in our house among those of us over the age of 4!  So easy, toss the roast in the crock, threw in some minced garlic since that's what I always have on hand and use in everything, Victoria brand pepperoncini's (stems, juice and all) and let it go.  By the time we were ready for dinner it was so easy to shred.  Served on hoagie rolls with provolone cheese on top, lightly toasted in the toaster oven to melt the cheese and it was great!  No extra condiments necessary.  Definitely a regular recipe in our rotation now.  Toss some Sun chips on the plate and you've got a quick, easy and not too bad for you quick dinner for a busy family.

I couldn't believe the smell when I walked into the house tonight.  I just knew we were all in for a treat.  Oh My Goodness.  I followed some of the reviews and had a big success this evening!  Thank you so much for a very moist lucious meal.

4.5 stars.  For ease of preparation, this is 5 stars.  For taste, 4 stars.  I also sauted onions and mushrooms to add to the meat and provolone cheese.  The house smelled great while this was cooking.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was such a hit!  We have done it several times now.  My husband likes me to saute mushrooms and onions to put on the sandwiches.  Toasting the buns is a good tip, too.  We melt the cheese in a toaster oven so the roll didn't get soggy.

Very easy with a zippy taste. Made a nice moist sandwich that could easily be gussied up with onions, red peppers, or mushrooms. I chose really good rolls and it made a big difference.

These are very good! I was the only one that added the sliced up pepperoncinis to my sandwich and thought it was delicious- they sort of eliminated a need for a sauce in my opinion. Mr. Beez isn't a fan of the peppers, and I forgot to sauté some onions for him, so he added A1 Sauce (??) and really liked it that way. I used a Venison chuck roast & swiss cheese since I forgot to get mozzarella. I toasted the assembled sandwiches under the broiler for a few minutes to melt the cheese- delish! The only thing is that next time I'll add some sautéed onions.

Very very good sandwiches! The easiest roast I've ever cooked. My husband and son both thought it was a bit too spicy and maybe I could have used half the peppers and it still would have been okay. I only had minced garlic in the jar so I just tossed in a couple of heaping spoonfuls in the crockpot. A Keeper, thanks!

My mom makes this recipe and the whole family loves it. The only difference is that she doesn't use the garlic and takes out the peppers and seeds after the beef is done cooking and saves them for those who want them. We top the sandwich with mozzarella cheese. Also my sister likes to dip her sandwich in bbq sauce.

This recipe has become part of our regular rotation.  Absolutely delicious sandwiches.  We serve on steak rolls with provolone cheese and either microwave or broiler for just a few minutes until the cheese melts.  You will not be disappointed!!

This was awesome.  I don't like Chuck roast, and that is why I tried something so different, I loved it.  My 9 yr old son liked it so much he asked for the leftovers the next night.  It wasn't to spicy, just flavorfull.  I served it on 1/2 a kaiser roll, to keep the carbs low.  Thanks for this great meal.

Absolutly wonderful - but I did make a couple of changes.  I added 4 cloves of sliced fresh garlic, 1 jalepeno chopped, and 1 large onion sliced to the slowcooker.  I put it on hoagie rolls and melted some pepperjack cheese on top.  It was soooooo yummy.  This is definatly a 'make again recipe'.

This definitely deserves all five stars!  If you want to make a great meal with very little prep work, then this is the recipe for you!  I was skeptical as I had never bought Pepperoncini peppers before (didn't even know what they were: I had to google them!, but I was just too curious after reading all the great reviews to pass it up.  I'm sure glad I didn't....it was divine!  We shredded the meat, then removed the stems from the peppers and chopped them and added them to the meat.  Then we placed the meat on buns, added sliced swiss and broiled them until the cheese was melted.
OH SO GOOD!

My husband and I love this as is.  But lately we've taken to adding potatoes, carrots and onions, and we serve it like a roast.  Be sure to serve with bread to sop up the juice.  (I've not tried it in sandwiches, but I'm sure that would be good. I've also read a suggestion to use a jar of picked cauliflower and other veggies instead of pepperoncini - sounds good, but I haven't tried it.)

Delicious and great as leftovers!  I used 2-3 tablespoons of minced garlic instead of the whole cloves of garlic.  I also sliced an entire onion into the crockpot as another reviewer suggested.  Once the beef was done, I shredded it and placed it on toasted french bread with provolone cheese, a bit of mayo and the onion slices.  Mmmmm!  It also made great leftovers as I assembled the sandwiches cold then broiled them for a few minutes before serving.

Great recipe!  My husband and I have used this recipe on many occassions.  We love it because it is so easy and the flavors are great.  Everyone we have made this for loves it too, including those that tend to stay away from spicy sounding foods.  We usually serve it with some type of hoagie role and cole slaw.

Excellent!!! My fiance loves this recipe and requests it.  My kids even like the sandwiches minus the peppers.  We use wheat rolls and provolone cheese.

We had this for dinner yesterday, and it was great. There are no leftovers...everyone ate untill they was sick! I did add some things from previous reviews. I added beef broth and onions. We had kiser rolls that I broiled before hand and then added the mixture and topped with provole cheese and broiled it again. Perfect!

I make these sandwiches almost everytime tri-tips go on sale at the grocery store!  Chunk up the roast, mince some garlic, pour in a big jar of sliced Pepperoncini and cook all day.  What could be any easier than that!  This is a top 5 favorite at our house!  Try it on toasted sour dough rolls with melted jack cheese and sauted sliced mushrooms!!!  YUM, to die for!!!!!!

Delicious.  I toasted the rolls in the oven, topped with provolone, fried onions and mushrooms. I followed other users' suggestions and measured out 2/3 C juice and replaced it with beef broth. The meat was perfectly spicy.  I prefer pork and will try it the next time instead of beef. Everyone loved these sandwiches.  What a simple, no-fuss, delicious meal!

WONDERFUL.  EASY.  I filled hoagie rolls added grilled onions and mushrooms and topped with provolone cheese.  I broiled in oven til cheese was melted and bubbly.  I also mad some garlic mayo for people to add themselves.  It was a hit and everyone loved them.

Love this simple recipe! I add a few garlic cloves to the pot and serve the butter-tender meat on crusty taosted rolls with melted mozzarella, a bit of cilantro & a squirt of lime. FABULOUS

This was very good. I used a small rump roast and a whole jar of banana peppers. The smell of it cooking all day was mouth watering. I used the leftovers and made sandwiches using avacado, chili powder and pepperjack cheese, these were good also.

My aunt gave me this recipe a long time ago.  The only difference is that hers calls for adding a package of dry onion soup mix.  I make this as a regular pot roast with potatoes and carrots...it gives the vegetables a fabulous flavor.  The vegetables usually get eaten the first night leaving only the meat for leftovers.  I'll have to remember the sandwich idea next time!

This is a great recipe for hot roast beef sandwhiches. I used hard rolls from our grocery store bakery and broiled provolone on top for just a few minutes until hot and bubbly. The pepperoncinis add a nice little kick!

Nice & tender & very flavorful.  I salted & peppered my beef before placing in the slow cooker & also added 1/2 of a red onion, sliced.  It was delicious on warm bread w/provolone cheese, extra pepper, lettuce & tomato.  Thanks Joyce!

This turned out pretty good.  Added a cup of 99% beef broth and half of the pepperoncinis.  Drained most of juice reserving about 1/3.  Used steak buns brushed with olive oil, added meat and cheese and broiled till tops of buns were brown and crisp.  Very Very good.  Thanks for the post.

Fantastic! This was so simple. My husband used to be rather skeptical when I would pull out the slow cooker. That was before I found this website. Now that we have had this dish, he is going to be thrilled to find the slow cooker on the counter! Thank you!

Great way to cook a roast.  New and different!  I broiled the sandwiches with provolone on top.  The peppers on the sandwhich are a must!  I don't think pepperoncini is that spicy, but if you don't like spice, I'll bet banana pepper slices in a jar would work also.  Thanks Joyce!

This is one of my all time favorite *surprised by* recipes. I was leery at first because I am not a huge pepper fan. But 3 ingrediants?? What is there not to try? The peppers & garlic leave this amazingly sweet and slightly spicy flavor throuout the meat. There is plenty of room to adjust for personal taste as well. 1/2 jar, 4 lb raost, etc....it always coms out wonderful. We use it for stew meat, burritos, sandwiches or eat it right out of the bowl. Even my kids will eat it!

We prefer other italian beef-type recipes from this site, but this was super easy!  As usual, I stuck this in the fridge overnight to get rid of the fat (LOVE that trick!).  Topped mini sub buns with provolone and broiled, then added the meat, a little more fresh pepperoncinis and some horseradish, and dipped liberally in the au jus.

This was REALLY tasty! And so easy! I did add some sliced shallots and about tripled the amount of garlic (we're big fans here). Served it on french rolls and melted some provolone cheese over the top. Be sure to add some of the peppers to your sandwich! Oh, and it was even better the second day.

I wasn't sure it was going to be enough liquid, but I let it stand as it was and it was some of the most tender pot roast we've ever done in the slow cooker. I let it go on the low setting for 10 hours. I would recommend that because I tried a piece at the 7 hour mark and it really wasn't tender yet. That extra time really does the trick!

Next time, I think I will add some bay leaf and maybe a few red pepper flakes for just a little more oomph. This was definitely not too spicy.  This was also the first time our cats circled the counter like sharks all day while it was cooking and we use our slowcooker all the time! LOL

Ive been making this recipe for years and years! I have found ANY cut of beef will work, it is extremely versatile . I use this with Tortillas and shred the meat which by the way is NOT difficult to do. I have published this recipe in our local paper too. It goes over great with Church potlucks, as well as making taquitos with the roast meat. Its Super Tasty and way too easy! Also- "Don't Forgetta Mezzetta" pepperocini's work the very best! I have found the other make and models too bland. I find the Mezzetta brand at Albertsons.

This was delicious!  Super simple and so yummy.  We served it on kaiser rolls with provolone and grilled peppers and onions.  I couldn't get enough!  We had some friends over that I've served a horrible meal to before and this was the chance to redeem myself and I did!  They were very happy.

Next time I will use a jar of pre-sliced pepperoncinnis.

Definitely easy to make.  Mine turned out very spicy, which I wasn't expecting, next time I might try using just 1/2 jar of peppercinis.  The thing that truly made this fantastic was serving it on Schlotsky's Bread which I found on this website too. We put the meat on the bread and topped with cheese, toasted it in the toaster oven and then topped with onion, lettuce, tomato, and olive slices. Yum!

I work from my home and everyone who came to my door today wanted to stay for dinner.  I had a request for the recipe based on the smell alone.  
We go the toasted rolls and provalone route. It doesn't get any easier and it's so good.

This was delicious!  We had it the first night on buns and made chimichangas with the leftovers the next night.  My husband and son have asked me to make it several times in the last few weeks.  This was definitely a hit at our house!!

This was very tasty!  My husband absolutely loved it.  He hates it when I try new recipes on him!  Some, I admit, have been disasters, but this one was a HIT!  He likes vinegar/sour tasting foods so I though I would try this one.  I found it to be a bit on the spicy side (the reason for the 4 star rating insead of 5).  Next time I will only use 1/2 a jar of Pepperochini instead of a whole 16 oz. jar.  Toasting the bread and melting Jack cheese on the sandwiches is key!  It took all of 1 minute to throw together in the morning and 5 minutes to shred the meat.  It couldn't be any easier than that.  Thanks for sharing this recipe Joyce.  I will definitely be making this one again!!!

So very easy and so very good! We have this at least every other week! Thank you Joyce! We serve this with provolone cheese in big wheat hoagie buns. It is a little spicy, but not overwhelmingly so. I use practically any cut of beef with this and just use 1/2 of a large jar of pepperocini.

Easy to prepare, tastes great--a winner!  I'm amazed at how flavorful the meat turns out.  As recommended, after cooking, we put the meat & peppers on french rolls topped with American cheese (it's all I had) slathered on some mayo and zapped it in the microwave for 30 seconds--awesome!  Two of my family members don't really even like pepperoncinis and they loved this!  Also, I thought the pepper rings would become slimy and really soft after all that cooking, but amazingly they don't.  I highly recommend this!

This is unreal!!!  We only used a very slight amount of mayo on the rolls before adding the beef, cheese, and peppers, and it was delicious.  I can't eat another deli sandwich now because none can match this.  The younger kids even liked it (I didn't put the peppers on their sandwiches).  The meat is unbelievably tender and flavorful cooked like this.

This was great and we will definitely have this again. The meat is tender and moist, but the sandwich needs some sauce. I used the juice as an au jus, but this makes it a little too spicy for the kids and my husband. They liked A-1 on the sandwich.

This is exceptional.  Not quite hot enough, so I add some tiny hot peppers and their juice.  Just right!  I cook it for 7-8 hours, remove the meat and shred it, place back in the cooker, and let it stew for another hour (if we can wait that long!)  Thanks for the recipe!

I've made this many times. My family loves it. I've also made it with homemade pickled peppers multiple times to increase the spiciness, peppers ranging from Hungarian wax peppers to scorpion peppers. With toasted hoagie rolls and melted provolone cheese  it is near perfect.

SO SIMPLE and SO GOOD!!! I used wheat hamburger buns, buttered them, put provolone on the bun bottoms and broiled tops and bottoms of buns. Added more provolone on the top of meat also.

I absolutely love this recipe! I’m not a huge fan of the traditional roast with carrots and potatoes, so this is great to switch it up. I followed the recipe as is, and it’s SO delicious! I do add some extra pepperocini peppers on my sandwich at the end for extra zest! Highly recommend!

So good. My parents are hard to please when it comes to food, we take our cooking very seriously. I'm happy to say they LOVED this and so did my kiddos. A couple of small edits for added flavor:  salt and pepper the roast before cooking and a dry pack of onion soup mix with 1/2 C water. I will most definitely make this again!

Made this years ago, forgot all about it. It was delicious!!! Made it again for the Superbowl & everyone loved it! Added some italian seasoning, and a pack of dried onion soup mix this time because the pepper brine was a little overwhelming with the sourness. Still great!!!

Will absolutely make again. Made in the oven, 350 for about 4 hours. Added a can of beef broth (as others suggested), lots of garlic, and a chopped onion.  Sauteed some mushrooms to put on top. Topped with a slice of provolone cheese (put under the broiler) and finished with some horseradish sauce. Yummy.

Best, and easiest, sandwich recipe on this site. When I don't have garlic cloves, I sprinkle 3/4 tsp of garlic powder over the roast instead. Sometimes I add a tsp of onion powder, too, but not always. Take care to avoid the hot variety of pepperoncini if you don't want it _too_ spicy; the jar is usually clearly labeled. I always use the sliced variety, not whole. My cheese of choice is smoked provolone, and I always place it on the bread, then toast it under the broiler to brown the cheese a bit. I shred the beef in the juices, to spread around the spices throughout the meat. Then strain out some of that juice before putting in the sandwiches (to avoid a soggy mess). So good.

This recipe is pretty amazing and simple! I added a little salt, but without salt is good too.

Perfect for Super Bowl supper.  Used slice pepperoncini and made sure to cut all the way through with the knife prior to inserting the garlic.  Also made sure to insert garlic in the naturally occurring space in the roast. 

Lightly toast the buns before building sandwiches if bread is soft.  I  topped with rough chopped onion and tomato slices and then toasted the full sandwich in a 375 oven for about 5-8 minutes.

In process of slowcooking now and expected to be finished in T-minus 4-6 hours and it was startling to me to see some of my garlic slices have turned a green color! I'm assuming it's from the pepperocini or its pickling juices. .. but it's very unsettling. Has anyone else experienced this?

It was good but I would have liked some sort of sauce with the meat. While the garlic and pepperoncini gave good flavor, once it was put on the bread it was rather dry. Next time I’ll probably add some tomato sauce or gravy of some sort.

Topped the meat and peppers with sautéed/grilled onions then melted provolone under the broiler, perfecto!  For people worried about the heat, I would rate it as medium spicy.

I have made this more times then I can count, its outstanding. I pop it under the broiler with the cheese. For leftovers, I  warm everything in the microwave & use a low carb. tortilla. I could seriously have this on the menu once a week, but I'm trying to watch my red meat & carbs.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it !! PS I always use a chuck roast, you can't beat it when it comes to shredding meat.

Pretty darn good simple recipe. I like it a lot but I did change mine to have different flavors. I added beef broth with anju sauce and added Johnny seasoning for a different kick. Also added some red onions into the mix. Good recipe that I will keep for the books.

Very good... the family loved it.  I used 5lbs of chuck roast, cut in half, seasoned with black pepper / salt and browned on all sides.   I covered the bottom of the slow cooker with a sliced sweet onion.  I was too lazy to carefully insert the garlic slices so I just dumped four cloves of minced garlic into the slow cooker.  I poured in the pepperoncini liquid and the sliced the peppers before putting them in.  Served on sub rolls with mozzarella melted under the broiler for 2 minutes.

We all loved it!!  Didn't change a thing, maybe added some more pepperoncini.  There weren't enough in the jar.  I was hoping for leftovers for a couple of days. My family ate this all in one night!  This one is a keeper.

My family has made this recipe for almost 30 years. It's simple, good for a crowd, freezes well, and tastes awesome. I have begun adding a package of au jus or brown gravy mix to the crockpot while cooking. My mother has used green pepper if she had no pepperocini's.  I toast the rolls with garlic butter before adding the meat. It adds an extra boost of flavor.

My family loves this! I worried that it might be too spicy for my youngest boys (8 and 11) but they gobbled it up and asked for more! I served the meat in small street taco tortillas with a little cheese and a little sour cream, and my family couldn't get enough! Taco Tuesday turned into taco Monday through Friday at our house! This recipe made me turn my back on "taco seasoning" tacos forever! (My youngest dropped his plate on the floor one night, and even the doggos loved this recipe!!!) This one is tacos for the win! Easy, inexpensive, and an absolute crowd pleaser! ?????

Great recipe and very easy. I tweaked it very slightly by adding about a half a stick of butter to the crockpot as well as a diced onion. I shredded the meat thoroughly and then toasted some buns with some butter and then put the drained meat on there with some of the sliced pepperoncini on top as well as some sharp provolone. Broiled it real quick and then served it to much acclaim.

Good stuff! I cut down the recipe slightly since it’s just two of us. And we still have plenty for leftover sandwiches. It was delicious. I’m not a big meat person, but even I liked the flavor and enjoyed the meal. The hubby has already asked me to keep this in our regular rotation. Win for me!

My husband and I just Love this recipe! Super easy, takes about a minute to throw it all together and when we get home from work my house smells amazing and supper is ready! We just use 1-2lb roast since it's just the two of us but leave the rest of the of ingredients as is stated. I think there might not be enough pepperoncini if we did use the 3lb roast. We used the sliced pepperoncini not the whole ones. Also when I'm in a super hurry I use the jarred already diced garlic. Since I'm gluten free instead of serving as a sandwich I make mash potatoes and spoon the roast on top then melt the cheese on top. My husband raves every time! This is made almost weekly in our house.

Made it as per recipe directions,  it turned out really good.   i was concerned about it being overly vinegary, it wasn't.   no different than using italian dressing for meat tenderizer, can only slightly taste the vinegar,   part of the flavor profile.

For someone who is a low key and beginning cooker, this is simple and easy to follow. II used a 12 oz jar of pepperchini as there was no other choice at my local store and it worked just fine!

DISCLAIMER: I've made changes, if you dont like tweaks, sorry!

I started making this a couple of years ago but not super often because the beef was overpowered by a vinegary flavor from the peppers. Then I made some changes

1) sear the chuck roast
2) use the drippings to carmelize a LOT of chopped onions and to fry garlic. For a 3 pound chuck roast I use 2 chopped onions and at least 1 whole bulb of garlic...adjust to your taste. 
3) in addition to the pepperoncinis, I add some beef broth, generous amount of italian seasoning (I use a dry blend of oregano, thyme, etc), abit of soy and Worcestershire
4) last time I added chopped mushrooms 2 hours before turning off. 

i reduce the liquid at the end.

Enjoy!

I combined two recipies, so I added about 3-4 T homemade Italian dressing mix and a large sweet onion. Trimmed fat off roast, sprinkled roast with dressing mix. Placed peppers and onions on bottom and top of roast. Made enough for two meals.

this is delicious. it was however very spicy and not as wet ..au jus.. as I would have liked..the second time I made the following changes.. I just used quarter jar of the juice and half jar of peppers added 2 tbsp of Italian seasoning and one cup of beef broth..i always Brown my meat first which adds the roasted flavor u don't wanna miss.  sliced n sauted one medium onion and threw it in at the beginning so they'd breakdown to not be seen by my picky son. absolutely delicious..both way we're great the second much less spicy

So good!!! Important to follow directions! Use the entire pepperoncini with all the liquid!! Serve on a crusty roll---we plated and used juices over sandwiches so knife and fork necessary.

This was the best roast I've made it turned out fantastic. I used  minced garlic and a 4lb blade roast I cut deep slits in and rubbed the garlic in poured the whole jar of peppronchis in and added beef broth (low sodium) to cover I cooked on low for 9 hours, cut it off the bone removed the string and left on keep warm setting overnight (too late for supper) the next day I shredded the beef chopped the hot peppers served on whole grain buns with mozzarella and red onion finely sliced with a horseradish mayo sauce broiled in the toaster oven. It was so good. Thanks so muck for the recipe

Wonderful!!!  My mouth is watering typing this.  The first time I made it according to the recipe, and it was very good.  The next time I put in nearly two jars of the sliced mild, Greek peperoncini, a whole sweet yellow onion sliced into thin rings and a packet of powdered ranch dressing mix.  It was slap your knee good!  We added the extra peperoncini, because they cooked down so much in the crockpot...we wanted more.  We didn't even put it on bread.  We ate it as is.  Will be making it for the fifth time in 7 weeks this next week.  Awesome and literally mouth-wateringly good!!!

I agree w/ some raters that the 1st time the taste was just ok - not something that really tingled the taste buds.  But this time, I added the following:
Salt,
Pepper, 
Garlic Salt,
Worcestershire Sauce, Two Beef Bullion Cubes, and
Diced White Onion.

The slow cooker is cooking right now with all of the above.

This has SO much flavor! Some members of the household cannot handle spicy, so I used half a jar of the pepperoncini  peppers and the juice from a jar of banana peppers that only had a few pepper rings in it. I also added in 6 beef bouillon cubes. It is our new favorite!

Made exactly as the recipe stated. It turned out great!!! (I did add half a jar of jalapeño juice in the crock pot for a little more liquid and kick.) Hubby was VERY skeptical when he asked what was for dinner. He ended up saying it was good too. Perfect for an easy meal.

So simple and good! I like spicy food, and this wasn't as spicy as I'd anticipated, but that's good because I can actually serve it to a wider audience!
If I wanted more spice I would probably use a jar of jalapeno's instead of pepperoncini.

I don't normally post reviews for recipes as I generally go rogue on how I make it,  but this was so simple, I cooked it as instructed. Fantastic just as instructed! Next time we're going to try it with onion, but trust me, this recipe is so simple and tasty that nothing else is needed, I just like to experiment.

So easy and amazing! I added one sliced onions at the beginning- that is the only change and it was very good. My husband couldn't get enough and I got many thanks for dinner tonight!!! I used mild pepperoncinis and my 2 year old could eat it with no problems.

Wonderful.  I followed the cooking of the meat exactly.  I toasted the bread before assembling the sandwiches.  After cooking I added a can of beef broth to the juices so we had more broth to dip them in.  Next time I think I will have a jar of pepperoncinis to use as a garnish for the sandwiches to give them a bit if crispness.  Would be a great game day sandwich option too.  Will add to my list of keepers.  SO GOOD!

I love pepperoncini and this has the strong slightly spicy flavor of them. However, it is definitely lacking on the meaty taste. 3 lbs of beef and the flavor is completely masked. One reviewer said they added an au jus packet. Luckily, I had one on hand and added about half of it (1/2 oz). Much better flavor!! Do yourself a favor and add an au jus packet to your grocery list for this recipe.

This was fabulous!  I added extra garlic and added onion about 3 hours into the cooling process.  My kids could not get enough.

I make this quite often, and have share the recipe dozens if times - always a favorite.  I stopped adding the garlic, just because I was out of it once, but found makes no difference.

For such an easy recipe it was pretty good! It makes A LOT, it would be perfect for a crowd. Next time I make it I may tweak some thing for my own personal taste but will definitely be making it again!

You can do this with all different cuts of beef, the flavor reminds me of Chicago Italian Beef Sandwiches, love it. The only thing missing is Gonella bread.

I like the simplicity of this recipe. It was delicious and the flavor was good.  I changed it a little bit, by searing in olive oil and adding Worcestershire sauce. I also added more peppers because I was afraid it that amount in the recipe was not enough.   I was really happy with how I turned out.

This makes such a great sandwich!  I add a sliced onion to the crock and then place the meat on top.  I use a 12 oz jar of MILD pepperoncinis.  If it's too spicy for your taste, you can add a little bit of sugar to the liquid. It makes a huge difference.  I reserve some of the meat and freeze.  Makes great filling for tacos.  Just add some more garlic, cumin, lime, and cilantro and voila.  You've got a great meat for tacos or quesadillas.

This was GOOD! Have to serve with peppers on top. I made the mistake of cutting too much fat off of the roast and it dried out. Next time I will leave it all on.

Great recipe. For those saying it is too spicy, look for mild pepperoncinis. The only thing I can add is that it's smart to remove some of the fat from the beef prior to adding to the crockpot.  I add a thinly sliced onion as well, but that is personal preference, as I don't rate a recipe based on the changes I make to it.

Made this recipe except I didn't use the clove of garlic I just sprinkled everything with garlic powder and a little garlic salt.  I also cooked it for almost 12 hours.
The meat was AWESOME!  We ate it plain instead of in sandwich form, and my husband even took it to work the next day for lunch.  He texted me that day to tell me how great it was reheated.
I can't wait to make this again.

Oh my, this was delish!  I used beef stewing meat and added onion soup mix (to bring the heat down a bit for my little ones). My husband wants me to make a big batch to keep on hand now. Thanks for a great recipe the whole family loves.

This simple recipe is AMAZING!  I let it go in the crock pot for a really long time.  It was PERFECT.  I think next time I will add more picked stuff, like celery, etc.

Don't know what I'm missing, but my roast has been cooking for 8 hours, just went to taste it and the vinegar from the Peppers was OVERWHELMING to me. I have invited ppl over for dinner and will have to change the menu, I don't care for the taste at all. :(

I always made Italian Beef sandwiches with an envelope of beefy onion soup mix...pepperoncinis were the condiment on the side.  I made these recently and got more rave reviews from family than ever!  Excellent taste!

Made this a couple weeks ago.  DELICIOUS!  So simple; I couldn't believe it would be so tasty but it was.  It's also quite rich especially with addition of cheese.  I made a sandwich on a kaiser roll for my husband and he had a hard time finishing it.  So perhaps a half sandwich with a nice salad would be better for those watching calories or with smaller appetites. P.S. Use a well marbled cut of meat--not tenderloin or anything lean.  You need the fat (marbling) to create flavor.

SOOOOO good!!!!! I added a little jalapeno at the end and around half time I added onion. Such a delicious flavor with the additives. Boyfriend raved about this, so that means it was truly great!!! What makes it better.... it's so easy :)

I add some sliced onions, and some beef broth to keep the flavors from getting to spicy (never really had that problem, but with little ones i want to make sure).  Delish!! I have tried it frozen out of the freezer and thawed and browned, didn't really matter either way.  I tend to use whatever garlic I have on hand, powder or fresh just minced up.  Making this for dinner tomorrow again, bought an extra large roast and using the leftovers for taco's later in the week!

Loved this..   I like to brown the meat a couple of minutes each side for a few minutes before pitting in the crock pot?  
Was worried that this would be spicy but it wasn't ....

I have made this twice now. I don't use the garlic but I add a full ripe jalapeno and add potatoes, carrots, and onion as well. The meat has a spicy kick but is not overwhelming.

What could possibly be easier than this?  We thought this was one of the very best slow cooker recipes I've made.  It is even better two days after it is cooked so it can "stew" in the juices.  Yum!

This is such an easy and delicious recipe! I did change it a little though. I used brisket instead of roast because it looked better than the roast the day I went to the store. Also, I seasoned with salt and pepper before studding with garlic. Also I used Muenster cheese, then stuck under broiler for a few minutes to crisp the bread and melt the cheese. This recipe will be in rotation at my house now. My boyfriend said it was the best brisket he had ever eaten!

This was wonderful!!  I am not a big meat eater, my husband is a steak man, and our four kids can be picky eaters but we all loved this! We added onion in the slow cooker and cheese on the bun and they were great!!  The meat was so tender it fell apart in the crockpot.

I loved loved loved this! I had about 2/3rd full jar of pre-sliced 16oz jar pepperoncini, and it worked out great. Next time I plan on adding sliced walla walla onion and using the onions/peppers on the sandwich.

Awesome and easy! made this a few times at home and it was great!  Tried it with pork (excellent!) as a dish for a party and it was the first thing gone! Used Monterey Jack for cheese and baked the sandwich in the oven until melted. A total hit and a definite keeper. Thank you Joyce!

YUM! I used garlic pepperoncini because that was all I could find and still used the garlic cloves. This hearty sandwich with clear juices doesn't risk dripping barbecue sauce on your game day shirt at a tailgate potluck.  The flavor does permeate the entire roast so my aspirations of feeding the kids from the "middle inside" did not work. Also noteworthy, but not a deal breaker, is the fact that this dish does not leave your home as pleasingly fragrant as many beef roast meals...think more corn beef and cabbage like in aroma, but who cares, an incredible  and easy dinner awaits!

Very good and easy.  How spicy it is must depend on the pepperoncini because mine was not that spicy...DEELISH!  Didn't change a thing.

This was so easy and a nice change from most slow cooker beef recipes I have had. The only thing I would change next time is to only use half of the jar liquid and subsitute the difference with some low sodium beef or chicken stock. It was right on the verge of being too salty.

This was wonderful!!!.  I added 1 cup of no sodium beef broth and only used 12 oz of pepperoncini's and it turned out perfect! I also browned the meat ahead of time and cut off the tops of the peperoncinci's.  YUM YUM YUM!!!!

This is one of my favorite recipes.  I like to use pork roast instead of the beef roast. This is just the easiest thing to make.  I also eat mine over mashed potatoes, which is so yummy!!

Love this recipe! I followed the instructions exactly - no modifications - and was blown away by the results. At about hour 7 I took the beef our and shredded it, then put it back in the juices/peppers for the last hour. It was so delicious! I ate this on a nice roll from the bakery with some melted provolone cheese. Delish! Will definitely make this again.

I'll add my 5 star rating into the mix...this was delicious! And I don't generally like peppers very much.  The beef was tender, the juice was tart but very flavorful, and the peppers were so good on a sandwich.  A hoagie roll toasted in the oven & swiss melted on top of the beef-heaven!

This recipe was awesome! It was so simple and turned out wonderfully.  I didn't have garlic cloves on hand so I just used the minced garlic in a jar I had.  I will be making this again.

This was AWESOME!! I doubled the recipe and added Worcestershire (2Tbsp).  I toasted the buns, buttered them and melted some cheese on them.  We had lots of au jus for dipping!! They were such a hit, the guys now call them " Superbowl Sandwiches"-- we will be having them again soon!

I don't know, I thought this was okay... maybe it's not my kind of dish. I thought it was far too fatty and greasy.  My boyfriend liked it, though.  I don't think I'll be making this again.  I would only recommend this dish to carnivores who LOVE to eat fatty meat.

Fantastic easy recipe. I cut slits in the  (4pnds)beef, put in the garlic, dumped a 14 oz jar of sliced peppercinnis on top along with a cup of beef broth. Covered and put on high for six hours. AWESOME! We put on toasted rolls with more peppercinnis, provolone and spicy mustard. My boys ate and ate and ate.

Love loved this!  The beef was very tender and I thought that the pepperoncini added a great flavor.  Only changes I made was adding some seasoning to the beef(pepper, salt, garlic pepper) prior to inserting garlic cloves.  I'm excited to eat the leftovers!

I have made this sandwich for years for our Christmas Dinner. My family loves it. I have never put the garlic in it but will this year to see how it tastes, as we all love garlic. Do try this...so simple and it is the best hot sandwich I have ever tried. Enjoy!!!

This was so delicious. It will definitely become a regular in our house. I used pepper jack cheese, and topped with sauteed red onion, and mushrooms. I also used extra juice from another jar of pepperoncinis I had. Served with onion rings. This was really filling too.

Interesting concepts.  Needed more pepperocini after to put on the sandwich...fresh ones worked best.

This was sooooo good! I added1/2 c.water and 2 tea.beef bouillen, and a few dasheds worchestire, also added two sliced onions, and used the the  garlic dill flavored pepperocinics, i also used about 8 cloves garlic and used a 4 lb. sirloin tip roast because we have to watch our fat intake. cooked on high 6 hours, and low 4 hours, it was perfect! Make it the day b-4 or over nite for the football game the next day, and re-heat in crock pot on low, it tastes even better!! Thank you for the wonderful recipe!!!

This was certainly easy to make.  It makes a tasty sandwich.  I covered with peppered havarti cheese. I would make sure you toast the buns because the meat is moist and it helps not make the bread soggy.

I guess I forgot to rate this one back when I made it. We really enjoyed it and it smells wonderful. I served on toasted rolls with some provolone cheese and broiled them until melty and gooey. We didn't find them at all spicy.

Heaven. All I do to finish it off is toast some french bread, put the meat and cheese on and broil in the oven until melted. Pretty much the best sandwich on the planet.

This was great! I was afraid it would be a little spicy for me, but it wasn't. I took the beef out, sliced it thin, then dipped back into the juices. Toasted up the hoagies in the oven with a little olive oil, rubbed a garlic clove on it when it came out and put a little mayo and a slice of provolone cheese. Yum! Definitely a new favorite!

Very tasty but the beef is dry...you really need to serve the au jus for dipping your sandwich and then it's perfect! I'm going to use the leftovers for tacos tonight.

just made this for dinner on a busy weekend. It was very easy. I think next time I will try to find the already sliced pepperoncini since I had whole ones in my fridge. They worked fine but getting the stems off later was kind of annoying. I did think this was good and my DH who isnt a crockpot lover declared it tasty. I will probably make this again. Thanks for a great and easy recipe! :)

This was so easy and so good!  My husband is rather picky and couldn't get enough.  It wasn't really spicy like some said, maybe if they used a different pepper or you are used to extremly bland food.  I made as is and will definatly be making again!

It was okay. I used chuck roast as stated and it tasted like a pot roast with a kick. The meat was very tender, but the taste was just..okay.

Very tasty.  I will make this again.  However, I didn't find it spicy at all.  I may add some pepper or something hotter than pepperoncinis next time.  Maybe jalapeno?  In any case it's great on a bun or roll with some provolone (or other white cheese like havarti).

I used this as my most recent in-a-hurry wild card recipe ... and it was fantastic.  Heavenly on a mini-baguette as an open face sandwich; enough zip to eat plain or cheeseaholics (like myself) can do no wrong by working some Swiss into the picture.  Delightful and SO glad I tried it!

All I can say is yum, yum, yummers! I made it exactly as the recipe is written (mine was a 16-ounce bottle of peperocinis). I shredded the meat, put it on a sliced hoagie roll, added some of the juice and a couple slices of Provolone cheese and broiled the whole thang and WOW! a super result! The entire family pigged out on this one!

Sorry, I found this to be nothing spectacular, as other reviewers have rated it. Best I can say is that it is probably "healthier" for you than the standard version of adding in a dry soup mix.

I did not use this as sandwich meat, but had it on a bed of mash potatoes and it was delicious! I wish I had leftover for sandwiches, but there weren't any :) The garlic turned a fosforescent yellow/green, which impressed the little ones into trying it, yet it was not so spicy as to turn them off. You don't get this type of meal with 5 minutes flat of preparation! Will make again.

I read through all of the negative reviews so I wasn't expecting much...I was pleasantly surprised. This gets even better after a day in the fridge. I didn't have a problem with the peppers breaking up like some reported. I suspect the quality of the pepperoncini determines how good this dish turns out.

Was not quite sure as it was cooking because it smelled a little strong.  Actually turned out great.  Served it on whole wheat hoagies and provolone and kids loved it.  Always a hit if it is easy and whole family eats.

I will give this five stars. I followed the recipe and never changed a thing.  What an amazing dish.  I prepared this for the first time for my son and husband.  They both loved it.  Toasting the buttered roll is a great idea.  I put this together the night before and took it out of the crock pot mid morning.  It just fell apart.  Thank you...this is a keeper.  Can't wait to fix it again. So easy!

This roast is WONDERFUL...I have made this using a beef roast and love it...however, we were snowed in over the winter and I only had a Pork Roast in the freezer...the Pork roast win hands down... I added a few ingredients to this and it only enhanced the flavor...I use Chicken or Beef broth and added a package of Italian Salad Dressing and a small onion quartered with the other ingredients to the slow cooker... This is a family favorite!!! Even my two year old grandson loves this...

I've been making this dish for years and never get tired of it.  It is also quite good if you add onions and green peppers to the meat while cooking.  My family doesn't like the texture of cooked green peppers so I cut them in large chunks and remove them before serving.

This is a great EASY meal!  Since I made it on Monday we had wonderful sandwiches all week long.  We are going to try whats left in quesadillas today!  (I did rub the meat with salt and pepper.)

I followed the recipe exactly - except I might have used more beef.  I think maybe next time I'll use 2 jars of pepperoncinis or use a packet of italian seasoning like I saw in another recipe (or use less beef!).  It tasted very pot-roasty.  I cooked it on high in the slow cooker and it came out really tender.

This was fantastic!  We all loved it-hubby and 3 girls.  I used sliced Hot Mt Olive banana peppers.  It was so simple but packed a flavorful punch.  I bought fresh crusty hoagie buns, sliced them, topped with provolone cheese and put them under the broiler before adding the meat/peppers. It was like a feeding frenzy at our house. Soooo satisfying. Crunchy,tangy,spicy goodness.  It's a keeper!

This was a good recipe. I served it at a Christmas office luncheon and it was a big hit. I not only added onions and beef broth as other did - I also doubled the garlic (as I always do) and added roasted red peppers (jar) and that really made the sandwiches awesome. With the pepperoncini, the roasted red pepper made the sandwiches very festive looking as well. I used pepper jack cheese and mozzarella and a horseradish sauce or mayo depending on each person's taste. It was a huge hit. The meat did not shred, so I had to slice it, but it was still tender.

Wonderful, I am not into peppers but I am pregnant and some reason I love pepperoncinis right now. My friend told me about this recipe, but I made it by dumping a 32oz jar of pepperoncini in crockpot with beef, cooked on low for 8 hours. It was so tender it just fell apart! It was way too spicy for my taste (the broth) but the meat was great. The last 20 minutes I added a bag of instant rice to the pot. It cooked up with all the flavor in it--this was awesome, I recommend trying this if you liked the recipe. We did not make it for sandwhiches, so I served it over the rice (No sauce on top for me!!) I am making this again soon and trying to tweak it to make it less spicy (add water maybe lipton soup, take out half a jar of peppers).
This is only one of about 5 recipes over the years my (incredibly picky) husband said 'Wow, you have to make this again'.

My only recommendation is to use hot pepperoncini instead of mild to give it an extra kick. Great meal!

This made a great tasting sub sandwich. I needed something quick and easy while babysitting our twin grandbabies. Put my frozen roast in my digital pressure cooker with 4 cloves garlic, an envelope of french onion soup mix, some beef broth and the pepperoncini. Pressure cooked for 50 min, thickened up the sauce and sliced up the roast. Piled it on a hoagie roll with jalepeno monterey jack cheese and broiled. Yum!!! Family loved it. Thanks for a fast & easy recipe.

Would give it a 5 for ease of recipe, but just lacking for us on the taste. Served it with  sauted mushrooms and onions, put under broiler like others suggested. It was ok, not sure if I'll make it again...

Dh loves this so I make it for him.  Too much heat for the rest of us (we aren't big "spicy" people).  Freezes well in individual portions for dh to take to work for lunches.

So easy and so delicious!

I slathered a roll with mayonnaise, poured some of the juice onto the sandwich and into a small bowl for dipping. So good!

Man, what a simple, yet totally perfect recipe!  I made this for Mother's Day lunch, and everyone loved it.  The meat's texture and taste was perfect.  I love easy recipes like this, can't wait to make it again.

This was pretty good.  The recipe didn't state whether to remove the stems on the pepperoncinis or not...I chose to remove the stems.  I also added sliced onions, green peppers, and fresh mushrooms.

I used a 2 lb chuck roast, 1 1/2 cups banana peppers with juice and sliced 1 onion.  This was so wonderful.  We melted cheese on crusty sub rolls and will keep this in our rotation!

Loved this recipe.  It was spicer than I expected but fine for me.  Not so much for the children.  Took away with us for the holidays.  Never did put it on bread just kept walking by the pot and picked at it all day.

Very good and easy. I served this on toasted sub rolls, topped with swiss cheese and placed them under the broiler. I also made a mixture of mayo with horseradish and spread this on the rolls. This was excellent!

This is AWESOME!!  Here's what I did: I put one can beef broth and one jar pepperoncinis for 1.75 lbs meat, and cooked it for 9-10 hours on low. When it was dinner time, I piled this on toasted French bread with provolone cheese, and melted the cheese in the broiler.  Just fantastic!!

I had a tri-tip in the freezer and thought why not try it with the recipe! I used a jar of bananna peppers, 1 cup of au jus, added sliced onion and 1T Italian seasoning....it was wonderful!! I did brown the roast first in olive oil with salt and course ground pepper.  I cooked it 3 hrs on high and 6 hrs on low. My husband is a truck driver and hates the food out on the road, so this made wonderful sandwiches on sub rolls to take with him. He likes extra peppers on it as well! Thanks for sharing the recipe!!

I loved this!  It was insanely simple and we had it on toasted hoagies with cheese melted over the beef and pepperoncinis.

Very very good but very very spicy... next time I'll use half the jar and drain them also and instead of the juice of the pepperoncinis, I'll use beef bullion.

This was so delicious, it's hard to believe how easy it was.  I've also tried it with a pork roast and it was just as good.  The leftovers made great cold sandwiches, too.

Wow!!  Super good, and spicy.  I cooked mine on low for 11 hours, it basically shredded itself.  Taste awesome with provolone cheese on a toasted roll.  Next time to cut back on the spice, I think I may drain the juice out of the pepperoncini into a measureing cup, and then replace it with water or beef broth.

This was excellent.  I had heard of this recipe a few years ago, but never found it until now.  We loved it.  I usually broil sub rolls, but microwaving them made them so soft and delicious.  I don't like spicy food and this was great.  I didn't include the peppers in my sandwich, but did in my husband's.  The flavor was wonderful!

OMG...what a great recipe!  Ran out of pepperonconis so had to substitute a 16 oz jar of Hot Giardiniera instead.  Family just went wild!  Served on wheat hoagies with provalone cheese gently toasted on top.  Cannot wait to try it with the pepperonconis to compare tastes.

This was awesome!  What a great idea to use a jar of pepperoncinis!  It gives the meat such a sweet and a little spicy flavor and very tender and moist.  My husband made sandwiches for work with this...used pepper jack cheese.  Thank you for a simple and delicious recipe!

Yum.  Dinner was ready when I walked in the door form a long days work, all I had to do was shred the beef.  We ate it on hamburger buns topped with beef, peppers and shredded jack cheese.

This is, without a doubt, the best roast beef sandwich I have ever had. I added an onion, and with an hour left, some fresh mushrooms. Also, I topped with pepper-jack cheese. If I did not feel like I was about to pop, I'd make another right now. Thanks for sharing.

Great quick recipe! Guys love these.  I have made this many times now, using whatever jarred peppers I've had on hand at the time.  Works just as well with a jar of banana pepper rings with a few pickled jalapeno slices also thrown in - usually forget the garlic and never even noticed the difference.

Good flavor to the sauce and loved dipping the sandwiches in the sauce but the meat on its own did not seem to pick up much of the flavor. Husband loved it how ever and ate most of it that night. We will be trying it again and maybe adding more seasoning, garlic and maybe some hotter peppers.

Really easy to make and turned out to be delicious!  Sauteed some peppers, onions and mushrooms, put it on some toasted sub rolls and topped with cheese.  My husband ate 2 subs and wished there were leftovers for tomorrow.  A little spicy but my 23 month old son ate it with no problem.  Thanks for the great recipe, I'll be using this one a lot!

This was super easy, which I love! It was good as a sandwich meat, but not so much just by itself. Maybe would be perfect for making a cheesesteak-like sandwich.

Excellent!!  I've had this in my recipe box for over a year and decided to try it for a lazy, football watching day.  I made this exactly to recipe and my family is already asking for a repeat trying out different varieties of pickled peppers (cherry, jalapeno, etc.).  Served on toasted french rolls with provalone cheese under the broiler for 2 minutes.

This was pretty good. I didn't think that it was too spicy at all. I followed the recipe exactly, and it was so easy, but I think next time I'll add some beef stock to make a rich broth for dipping. Thanks for the recipe!!

I made these as suggested by a reviewer in the cookbook- on toasted hoagies with pepperjack cheese, and topped with some sauteed mushrooms and onions.  I used more pepperoncini than called for, and it turned out incredibly moist and I would give it 4 stars on flavor, but gave it five for how easy it is. We didn't find it very spicy.  Next time, I will try this and add some mexican spices to it, and use the beef for enchiladas.  This recipe is a keeper!

I followed the advice, and I only put in half of the peppers.  I used the broth for a dip, and I just didn't care for it.  However, my husband loved it and made me promise to make it again.  Next time, I will add all of the peppers since it didn't seem to have enough flavor with half the amount.  I will also add onion to the mix and see if that helps with the flavor.

My husband and I loved this, but the kids did not. Would make a great super bowl dish! I  put the meat on onion kaiser rolls with a slice of provalone cheese, then put it under the broiler to melt the cheese. Loved them!

I have made this numerous times, but I actually prefer it made with pork. I used a pork shoulder roast the first time because that's what I had on hand. It was delicious. I tried the beef next, but have made it with the pork since.

This was a very easy recipe and the meat came out extremely tender and fell apart as I was taking it out of the crock pot.  But, it was too intense with pepperoncini flavor, and we love pepperoncincis.  Next time I will make it with some of the juice, some water and beef broth. Great with prov cheese melted under the broiler!

This is one of my favorite "lazy day" recipes. 3 ingredients, the crock pot. It doesn't get any easier than this!

This tastes pretty good.  Although, something was wrong.  My meat did not come out very tender.  It was impossible to shred.  I ended up with chunks instead.  Next time maybe I will try a different cut of meat.

This was so flavorful and definitley one of the best philly cheese steaks I have made.  It was so tender and very easy and inexpensive to make.  I expected it to be more spicy, I might add some jalapeno's next time.  Yum, yum, yum.

This is great.. however, I did make a few changes. I left out the garlic, so only added the beef with the entire contents of the jar of pepperoncini's. When it was done, I took the roast out of the crock pot, shredded the beef, and placed it back in the pot for about 30 minutes. This was PACKED with flavor! One of my husband's favorites.

This is very good and very easy! Made a few changes like adding beef broth to the meat during cooking. Also added sliced green peppers and onions towards the end. I toasted the rolls before serving and poured a little ranch dressing over the meat before adding back to the toaster oven to melt the cheese. The gang loves it. A real keeper!

After all the rave reviews, I must say that I wasn't very impressed.  In the end it came out more as a typical slow-cooked chuck roast recipe and wasn't jumping with the flavor i expected.

I had some pork tenderloin that I wanted to use so I substituted it for the beef. It was excellent! My husband and I will definitely make this again. I'll try the beef next time.

I also added one med. sliced onion on top, and a few shakes of additional seasoning: fresh ground black pepper, Morton's Nature's Seasoning, Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning.  My husband loved it and had it for lunch the next day on flour tortillas, and my daughter is already requesting a second batch.  Thank you.

Wonderful recipe! I made this last week, and the two of us had sandwiches for dinner 3 nights in a row.  I added some onion flakes, ground mustard, and pepper to the crock pot.  This was requested again this week, and I'm going to add a sliced onion this time and maybe use the Hot peppers rather than mild.

I really liked the idea of adding Pepproncini to the roast, but for me it just wasn't tasty enough. It was a little to bland.

I just recently bought a convection oven.  I prepared a roast that didn't quite turn out & it was underdone so I thought I would try to save it with this recipe.  It worked!  I added the entire jar of whole pepperoncini's with the liquid and it was to die for!  My hubby raved on and on about it!  He loved that the peppers were whole and we made two meals out of this roast (sandwiches & burritos).  Thanks Joyce - you're a jewel!

I really wasn't ecpecting the "spice" in this dish. I used mild banana peppers and it was way too spicy for kids.  My hubby and I like the extra kick and it was a very easy dish to make but probably won't make again.

This was so easy to prepare and extremely tasty!  I used banana peppers instead of pepperconcini and it turned out great!  I spread horseradish sauce on hoagie rolls and topped the rolls with the beef, the peppers and provolone.  I put the sandwiches under the broiler to melt the cheese.  My husband loved the sandwiches and I am looking forward to the leftovers tomorrow night!  Thanks JOYCE for an easy AND tasty dish!!

Prepared this on top the stove. Browned the roast,and sauteed a couple of sliced onions. Added salt as well. Everyone enjoyed this dish, but no rave reviews.

Wow!  This is sooo good!  I tasted it before dinner, and didn't think I could stop picking at it!  We had it with crusty rolls and provolone cheese melted on top.  Absolutely delicious!

We actually give this closer to a 3.5 stars.  It was good, but more of a winter meal than summer.  We like how it's a little spicy!  I'll make it again, Thanks Joyce.

Everyone enjoyed, including picky 11-yr old son.  Cooked an additional 2 hours on high to make shredding easier, then put back in crock and simmered 1 more hour.

YUM!  This is great with swiss cheese, too...a favorite in my family, and perfect for party mini-sandwiches on french rolls.

This is outstanding!  It's so easy and so good.  My husband loves it and even my 2 year-old likes it. It has become a regular for us...needs no modifications.

Excellent! Family loved it. I passed this recipe out at work. Great reviews from all! One of my friends is planning on making a few batches for her daughters graduation party. She already has a few extra crockpots, including mine, on reserve.  Will make this again and again.

This recipe was so easy and the taste was great! Instead of 1 jar of the mild pepperoncici I used half a jar of the mild and half a jar of the hot!
There were no leftovers!
