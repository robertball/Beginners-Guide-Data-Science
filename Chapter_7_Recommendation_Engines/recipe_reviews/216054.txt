Surprisingly good! I was looking for a recipe that wasn't the usual miso soup in order to use up some miso, and this was it. The combination of apple/celery/shiitake is interesting, but it works. I used tofu in mine which wasn't a problem. Since I used miso, I left out the broth because I figured it would have enough sodium between that and the extra salt and I don't like a lot of salty taste, so just use your judgement when it comes to that. Otherwise, I'll definitely make this again!

To the commenter above who said there wasn't enough water: did you add an entire head of celery or just one stalk? Celery is mostly water, and when blended with the chicken broth and apple, it all breaks down to form the base of the soup. 

It seems there was a bit of an error in the edit/publish on this recipe, as my original submission does specify that the celery isn't just a few stalks, but an entire head. This may be what was missing when you made it.

I think this recipe is missing a couple of things.  One, it is soup that is supposed to serve 10, but it only calls for 1 1/4 cup water.  With the miso, the salt, and all the spices, it turns out entirely to salty and spicy and doesn't make much.  Two,  after adding several cups of water to the mixture which took care of the strong taste of seasonings, it was lacking substance.  It tasted like well seasoned water. I ended up grabbing whatever vegetables I could find in the refrigerator and adding them to this soup.  I added two cups of sweet potatoes, 1 potato, chopped carrots, rice, etc.  After all that, it was worth eating and had nice flavors.

If you think a tablespoon of salt and a tablespoon of pepper are too much,you're correct. Cut these by 75% and the soup might taste good. And, triple the liquid called for in the recipe. We added rice and water, and more organic vegetable stock until we could eat it. It was a good idea, but way too many spices and salt.

First,  I really appreciated the flavors...it was a nice break from the average soup - and yummy!  Yes, I changed a couple of things.  I used low sodium chicken stock and I only added 1/2 tablespoon salt.  Also,  i roasted my garlic head.  And at the end I did add a good bit of water to make it more soupy.  I will make this again and I will probably use more celery as suggested....sounded like a good idea.
