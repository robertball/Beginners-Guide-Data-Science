I inverted the tarts so the crust was on top and dusted with powdered sugar. I doesn't get any easier than this - simply tasty and elegant!

Coming from Bakewell I had to try this recipe. I found it interesting there was no ground almonds in it. I shall stick to the recipe my mum uses

Why is everyone surprised that these aren't a traditional Bakewell tart?? It clearly states that underneath the title in the authors comments. They are her Grannys quick version. I made some for a bake sale as I had run out of steam making 'traditional' biscotti and 'traditional' danish biscuits. They were super easy to make as you can tell from the ingredients. I 'tarted' them up a little with a teaspoon of almond extract and garnished with some flaked almonds. Thank you for posting x

The ladies in my Bunko group seemed to like these. I used raspberry preserves. After tasting one I decided to add a light powdered sugar cream cheese glaze. If I make them again I will brown the crust a little before adding the preserves and cake mix. No one realized that there was pie crust on the bottom since it was the same color as the yellow cake.

I liked the simplicity of this recipe but somehow the simple idea turned into a disaster. The jam spread out to the edges of the muffin tins and beneath the pie crust and glued the whole thing to the bottom of the (nonstick!) pan. They were impossible to get out of the pan without destroying them. The pieces of cake and jam that came out tasted good (it was just cake mix & jam after all) but the pie crust layer was permanently left in the bottom of the tins. I've never had a problem with pie crust sticking like this before. I'm not sure if they should have been left in the tins to cool - maybe removing them immediately would help? Using muffin liners might also help but it seems like they'd still be a mess to remove from the liners and try to eat.

This was a hit at my bake sale! I made it with white cake mix instead of yellow and peach pie filling instead of jam and put vanilla frosting with sliced almonds on the cake part but it still turned out great!

My Grandmother used to make these for us too:) We loved them...and still do! Our family has called them Queen Ann tarts and Empire tarts....have to confirm with my grandfather the real name. Thank you for sharing this as I needed to make some and couldn't find a recipe.

Made these twice. I was excited to try them because they sounded like something different. First attempt was an epic fail as the pie crust bottom was raw after the cupcake baked. 2nd time I prebaked the pie crust rounds then poured the batter on top. That batch turned out fine but at the end of the day it was basically a jelly cupcake & not worth the fuss. I did add almond extra to the batter & topped them with sliced almonds & powdered sugar.
