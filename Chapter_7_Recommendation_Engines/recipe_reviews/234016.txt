Delicious simple recipe. I spruced it up a bit and it turned out wonderfully. First, I cooked the bacon about halfway then added chopped onion, celery, carrots, and a couple cloves of garlic.  Cooked all together until the bacon was crispy and veggies soft. I used 2 bay leaves and put them in the milk while it simmered. Before I put the veggies in the milk I mixed the chopped potatoes and corn (I used frozen) in the pan with the bacon and cooked veggies to get some extra flavor. Let simmer on the stove and salt and peppered to taste. Great comfort dish on a chilly day.

This was absolutely delish! I didn't have bacon, so I used some kielbasa sausage instead. I also added a teaspoon of chicken bouillon and 1/2 teaspoon beef bouillon, along with 1/2 an onion. Other than that, I stuck to the original recipe. The directions were excellent and it was very easy to put together. I definitely give this a 5/5!

I followed the advice of some other reviewers and added chopped onion and garlic to the vegetable saute. I didn't have regular milk, but used a ratio of 3/4 skim milk to 1/4 half and half, and that yielded a very rich taste. We added no salt and enjoyed the mildly sweet taste of the corn and dairy ingredients. So good!

I've made this several times and love it. I swap finely diced ham for the bacon and add an extra bay leaf. Instead of simmering on the stove I finish it in the Crockpot. It's much better the next day.

It is ok.  Missing something though.  And I even added garlic and pepper.  Also cooked the veggies in some vegetable broth so that I could then puree them.  But still missing something.  Kids wouldn't eat it.  Bacon didn't even help.

This recipe turned out fantastic! I made a double batch and I am glad I did, because it was delicious.  The only change I made was that I didn't use paprika, and I added black pepper and sea salt.

Delicious.  I thickened it more at the end with some instant potatoes.  Also added onion with the carrot and celery.  Very filling and warms you up on a chilly winter night.
