I tried this recipe for my restaurant, and it is a hit!! I used chicken broth instead of the condensed cream of mushroom soup because I dont like mushrooms. I also added rosemary, minced garlic, and carrots. I also use more than the 5 tbls of bacon grease to give extra flavor.

Two thumbs up from a fellow northern Minnesotan! I did make some variations to the recipe that we found were tasty. I added 1/2 cup of sliced carrots to sauteed veggie mixture. I substituted the cream of mushroom soup for cream of potato because we do not like mushrooms; added 1 pint of half & half (and added only enough water to make desired consistency instead of using 3 1/2 cups of water), 1/4 cup roasted sliced almonds, and 1/4 cup cubed Velveeta cheese to simmering soup. It turned out nice and creamy. Two lbs of bacon may have been a touch too much so next time I will only use 1 lb. A definite comfort food, and I will make this soup again. Thanks for sharing the recipe!!

I replaced bacon with Turkey bacon- and added chicken sausage in it- it was delicious.

Excellent. The meat mixture seemed really soft, and I worried the meatballs would be soggy. They baked up nice and firm, a perfect consistency. I used half quick oats and half old-fashioned, because I ran out of quick. Served with brown rice and squash. All 4 kids ate it!

Good soup. Wasn't sure about the green pepper but it added a nice taste. Easy to make since you're using canned soups as a base. Be sure to use low sodium broth or it could be too salty. I only used half the bacon because it seemed like too much.

I used only 1 lb of bacon instead of 2 but used a bit more of the grease when frying the onions, pepper, and celery. It was awesome!  My wife and Son both loved it as well.  I think I will try adding the carrots too next time I make it as the other reviews suggest and possibly a potatoe finely diced might go well.
