No changes. From an Italian family, My mom made it that same way. I am 79 and I make it the same way. I grow my own parsley so I have it re6ady to use at any time we make this dish.

Very simple but a delicious side. Would be great to bring along to a bbq, itâ€™s great room temp or chilled

I made this recipe as is and it was very good. Easy, fast, and a nice deviation from the typical mayo+potato combo. Very summery too!

Sort of like a pasta salad but with potatoes instead. I can see the sauce being really good to dip bread into too! Yum!
