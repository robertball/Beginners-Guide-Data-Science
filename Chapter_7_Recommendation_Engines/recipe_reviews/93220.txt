This soup was amazing. Everyone in the house had second and thirds.  I wouldn't tell my son what was in it until his third bowl. He doesn't do veggies.
I shortened this process considerabley by cooking in the microwave for 3-4 minutes. Then split them and backed on cedar planks in the oven until soft. (soaked cedar planks)  I also add 1 tsp. of liquid smoke to off set the non grilling.
Make a double batch it goes fast.

Delicious! I didnt make it exactly as the recipe called for but it turned out amazing anyway- I didnt smoke the squash-I baked it in the oven until it was soft and scooped it out after. I used turkey bacon instead (it has a smokey flavour too it) cut the butter and sour cream in half too. I wish I had doubled the recipe as it did not last long!! I topped it off with a few toasted pumpkin seeds and yum yum yum!

This is a great addition to Thanksgiving. If you have a smoker the acorn squash can be cooked for a few hours at the same time as the turkey, which gives it exceptional flavor. A keeper for sure!

I sauteed onion and garlic with a bit of the bacon fat and omitted the butter, the squash to be rich enough.  After soup was done, I was under impressed.  So, I chopped and sauteed two jalapenos and two poblanos to add; tasted great.

WOW !!! This was fantastic. I am a member of a local club and in the fall we have "Soup Saturdays" so I made a large pot. The flavor was awesome. I highly recomend the garnish as it gives a subtle enhancement to the soup. The alder wood is perfect. My wife and I found ourselves nibbling on the squash right from the smoker. A definate repeat.

I made it today. As I harvested it from my garden fresh Acorn. I backed it in a 375 degree oven in shallow baking dish, with water in it. Wrapped it in alumni foil. Mean time,chopped onion, garlic, carrotts, oil in a pan, chopped up five stripes of bacon. Heated the oil, added the onion the garlic, on low flame. Stirring constantly. In mean time I heated 2 cups of chicken bullion. I left chunky zuchini,s, carrots in my soup it is tasting soo good. And I added half and half and more curry to taste.

This was really good! I only used one squash, but didn't scrimp on the bacon, using 4 slices (Applewood Smoked) I also added some onion powder, and was also generous with the fresh parsley. I'll bet the bowl I have left over is even better tomorrow. If I make it again, I'll add more spices.

Wow for the recipe to get me going on using different spices with squash. I did substitute Liquid Smoke rather than smoke on grill and used peanut squash instead. I left out the butter completely. Flavor is fantastic. Way better than I anticipated. Thank you!
