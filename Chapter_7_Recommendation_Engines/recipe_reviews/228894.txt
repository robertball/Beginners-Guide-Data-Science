This tuna salad is fantastic and a new favorite for me and my best friend.  A few things we changed: replaced the green onion with one small white onion, took out the garbanzo beans, used less parsley, and added some feta cheese to give it a Mediterranean flare. It goes really well with some Mediterranean flavored pita chips.

I followed the recipe exactly and I found there was way to much parsley for my taste. I'd maybe do 1/2-2/3 of what it calls for. I'd probably add another can of tuna and maybe some more red peppers. I found there was a bit too much vinegar in the dressing but I did like the taste of it. Overall it's very good. I would just tweak it a bit.

this is a great healthy lunch. i skipped the green onion and parsely, and diced up a small red onion and some fresh thyme leaves instead. and i didn't have spinach so i just scooped it onto pretzels, and its even good by itself.

This was so good! Had to change it slightly. I didn't have any peppers, and I don't care for onions.  I only had dried parsley. Also, only had a reg. cucumber, so I cut most of the seeds out.  Really delicious and great for a hot day! Thanks for the recipe!

Very good, authentic Italian version of tuna salad. I like to increase the garlic and add chopped celery and other veggies (cucumber, bell pepper, whatever I have handy).  There's lots of flexibility with this recipe...you can modify it to your family's tastes.
