This was a very nice soup. Didn't have access to the fresh herbs so I used dried.. still very good. I also pureed this and tried it cold.. tasty that way too

I LOVE THIS RECIPE IT TASTES SO GOOD BECAUSE AFTER I ADDED THE BROTH I WAITED 5  MINUTES AND ADDED A PINT OF HEAVY WHIPPING CREAM.I PLANNED TO MAKE ANOTHER RECIPE FOR ZUCCHINI SOUP THAT HAD HEAVY WHIPPING CREAM BUT COULDN'T FIND IT ON MY COMPUTER SO I COMBINED THE 2  RECIPES.
