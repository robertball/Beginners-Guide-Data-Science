This was excellent! Like other reviewers, I used roasted red peppers out of a jar, fat-free half and half and a bit of flour to thicken, and it came out just great.  I used whole-grain spinach tortellini stuffed with ricotta and the dish was excellent! I will be making again.

Very good sauce... even my mom, my toughest critic, loved it! If made with skim milk and flour instead of cream, it can be a real healthy sauce that feels guilty. The recipe does make enough foor for a cruise ship, though.

A few suggestions...

1) I mixed in diced chicken (briefly sauteed in red wine) and put it over spaghetti.

2) I would add more spices. I actually put in hot sauce, very nice kick. 

3) If you make it thick enough, it could be used as a dip! Cut up some pita bread, toast the slices, and dip it into the sauce when it's cold.

This was good.  I am a big fan of tomato cream sauces so I thought I would switch it up and try this.  Def different and worth a try.  I did sautee up some onion with the garlic and basil and I used jarred roasted peppers and added a few extra pieces.  I also used mostly heavy cream with a splash of whole milk for the cream which I also mixed in 2 tsp cornstarch for a thicker sauce.  Spiced it up with some dashes of red pepper flakes, sea salt, pepper, and red paprika.  Using fresh grated cheese makes a big difference in a dish.  Served over fettucini.  Wouldn't it be an idea to brown chicken chunks with the onion/garlic - blend the peppers then pour over the chicken..Let that cook awhile and then add the cream and spices...Throw over pasta and top with some shredded mozzarella cheese and bake til cheese melts...Sounds good huh??
It's great to have a decent base recipe to experiment with.

Great recipe.  First time I made this I just bought a jar of roasted red peppers and it worked great.  Tonight however I had some time so I halved and roasted my own peppers in the oven.  MUCH easier than I thought and the skin just comes right off.  For a sweeter sauce, I used one yellow and 2 reds instead of just 2 reds.  On that note, This recipe calls for 2 peppers, but I used 4 large bell peppers (keeping the other measurements the same) and you could taste the peppers much better.  Also at the end while simmering... try adding a few oz's of chopped sundried tomatoes... it adds a nice burst of flavor that is great for pasta, meat or whatever.  Bottom line is this sauce tastes great on everything i've put it on.

Oh my good Lord in Heaven-please let this sauce adorn the pasta at the banquet table when I get there!!!!  Out of this world good, and not that difficult to make.  It would work well with any kind of pasta and I could see this sauce and pasta paired up well with grilled chicken strips.  My mind reels with the possibilities of how much I can use this.  THANK you Bob!  It should be noted that all the low reviews changed this recipe from using jarred peppers, dried basil, to subbing lowfat milks and adding onions, broth and the like.  Perhaps rating the recipe on how it is written would be helpful to those who are considering making it-then reviews could be taken at face value. :-)

It had an outstanding flavor.  Great on tortellini!  I wanted a slightly healthier version and I added 2T flour to the sauting pepers and garlic and so on, and then just used skim milk.  Still rich and creamy and a wonderful flavor.  I also opted for not putting it into the blender and it was a wonderful, beautiful, chunkey sauce.  Defintaly making it again!

To quote my fiance, "This is incredible!"  I used fat-free half & half and jarred red peppers with very good results.  I also dissolved some corn starch in the half & half before adding it to help thicken the sauce. I served this over cheese ravioli...yumm. I wouldn't make the recipe as it's listed due to the fat content, but my lower fat version didn't sacrifice the taste at all!! thanks for a great recipe :o)

I liked the recipe but I agree that it needed to be thicker.  I reduced the cream to 1 cup and increased the romano cheese to 1/3 cup.  I omitted the butter, salt and pepper.  I had this in a restaurant over wild mushroom ravioli and torn spinach.  It was delicious and so is this recipe.  Thank you Bob!

This was excellent! I made half a recipe and roasted the red pepper over the fire on the stove instead of the oven. Then I put it in a sealed bag for about 10 minutes before removing the charred skin. The skin came off with ease.

This recipe took quite a bit of time, but it was well worth the time and effort. Next time I might make one big batch of the red pepper, basil and garlic puree and freeze it.

Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

What is it, with such a huge portion of these people that rate recipes?? They talk about how incredible it is, and only rate it at 4 stars. Does it have to cook itself to receive 5 stars?  Or, they substitute many of the ingredients, and then they're somewhat disappointed about the way that it turned out?  That's a load of garbage!

I wish I could give this ZERO stars.  This was downright awful.  I followed the recipe to a T and it just simply was not good at all.  Took forever and fell flat.  It was beyond bland but some of the flavors that it did have just clashed horribly.  After tasting it, I tried to rescue it but to no avail.  It ALL went down the garbage disposal.  What a waste.  The consistency was horrid.

I loved the flavor of this sauce. To save some time and hassle, I used bottled roasted red peppers. I also used fat-free half-and-half. I agree with one of the reviews, which indicated the sauce might be better thickened a little, so I add some cornstarch (about 1/2 to 1 teaspoon) with the half-and-half and keep whisking to prevent lumps. I served this over regular linguine with some spicy Italian sausage on the side. Absolutely wonderful!!

this recipe is FANTASTIC. I don't really like bell peppers. But I belong to a food co-op and I recieved 13 of these suckers and needed to think up something different to make with them. I used 4 of them for this recipe...OMG Its my new favorite sauce. I couldnt stop eating it last night, in fact I licked the spoon after I put the left overs away. ITS FANTASTIC. I only changed a few things because of what I had on hand 1. I used dried basil 2. used whole milk and some flour instead of half and half 3. used parm cheese 4. used only 1 T of butter. Served over pasta and with Fish! YUMMMM!!! I cant wait to eat it again tonight and I cant wait to make it again!! SOOOO easy! Make this sauce, you will NOT regret it!

I served this sauce over ravioli and my husband and I both thought it was really good. I chose not to puree it, and I'm glad I didn't, I liked the little chunks of pepper. I would definitely make this sauce again.

Great for someone (like me) who doesn't care for tomatoes.  I've made it as-is and it was rather thin, but I also made it with some tofu (instead of the half and half) and that thickened it up while adding protein.  You'll need a blender or food processor to puree if you try it with tofu.  I'll make it again.

Simple, quick and good.  I used one cup of cream instead of two cups of half and half.

I've made this cream sauce on a few occasions now and I've loved it each time. I have always used the jarred roasted peppers and low fat half & half, I have not noticed any loss of flavor by the changes I've made. I do however, mix in hot Italian Sausage with it and that definitely makes me love it even more!! I plan to make it again this weekend, as I have been craving it for sometime now. It tastes just like the hot sausage & sweet red pepper fettuccine dish I used to get at a restaurant I worked at years ago, that has since closed.

Delicious!  I sauteed some chopped onion with the garlic for more flavor.  I used it on top of regular spaghetti noodles since that was all I had, and used extra cheese to thicken the sauce.  I also used the fat-free 1/2 n 1/2....my family loved it!

This recipe does not have to be bad for you and still maintain all of its great flavor!!!  Instead of 2 c. half-and-half, I used about 1-1/2 c. light sour cream,  and I omitted the butter altogether!  The consistency was perfect and needed no extra thickening.  (Other reviewers suggested fat free half/half, and while the flavor is just fine, it gets visually clumpy/pasty when cooked--not so appealing.)  I added a couple shakes of red pepper flakes to give the sauce just a little zing, then served over whole wheat penne with sauteed chicken and asparagus chunks.  My hubby raved.  The flavor of the sauce was perfect.

I made this into a vegan recipe by substituted unsweetened soy milk for the half and half.  Because I could not use cheese, it required more flavoring with spices.  If you are a vegetarian and eat dairy, the romano cheese added at the end surely will complete the dish!

This was very good!  Although the next time I make it I would reduce the heat because the cream seemed to separate....  Maybe I did something wrong - but it was still edible and still very yummy!

I used jarred roasted red peppers and added some frozen spinach. I used whole milk and thickened with cornstarch, which worked fine. Served over toretellini. Will definitely make this again.

I really enjoy this sauce.  I've made it twice in the last few weeks.  The first time it was a bit week so the next time I doubled the peppers and added a little more spice with paprika and red pepper flakes. Blended it the first time, just chopped the second time, both textures were great, you can't really go wrong. Can't wait to make it again!

I tripled the peppers (we didn't want the dairy to overpower the pepper flavor) but otherwise followed the recipe as is. I've made a lot of pasta in the last 5 years, but DH says this was the best and is already looking forward to having it again. I served it with Barilla plus penne and sweet Italian sausage.

Excellent sauce, simple and delicious.  A good tip though, use fresh garlic and basil only.  I have done once with jarred, minced garlic and dried basil, not the same.  Enjoy!

WOW AWESOME!!!! I added steamed broccoli and then after pureeing sauce and before adding into pan, I sauted some chicken with onion and garlic, then added the puree in. Skipped the butter and was still delicious. Added a tablespoon of red pepper flakes.

This was pretty okay 3 1/2 stars and a bit difficult to critique since I can't help but compare it to a raw foods red pepper pasta sauce I recently made that was totally wild in your mouth good.  That being said it was on the bland side. I would add fresh garlic, sun dried tomatoes and cayenne should I opt to try it again.  This might be a good sauce to use in a layered dish with another spicier sauce. The author was correct in  suggesting tortellini for the pasta.  I chose cheese ravioli.

Oh my Bob, was this ever good!!!!!!! I'm hanging my head in shame as I cheated and just bought a jar of roasted red peppers. (do you mind if I say that this was a really, really good idea and would do it again? Ha!) Yup, I didn't see the need to roast my own peppers and it worked out beautifully. I added more parm than suggested just because I love it and it also helped to thicken the sauce.  I had run out of fat free half and half so I used skim milk instead. It was perfect and will continue to use it with this recipe. A few dashes of red pepper flakes added just a bit of friendly heat to satisfy all of our palates. Fantastic recipe Bob and we all thank you so very much!!

I added one leek and used jarred roasted red pepper when sauteeing then added 1/2 c low sodium/no fat chicken broth at the end.  Used an immersion blender to mix it all then only use 1/2 of the half and half, added a bit more chicken broth, skppped the butter, added 1/2 lb of cooked shrimp and a dash of sherry and let it cook down to thicken!!  Excellent!

This sauce was rather bland for our tastes.  I doubled the garlic and added red pepper sauce but even that didn't perk it up.  I had high hopes for this one but found it a little disappointing.

It wasn't great and it wasn't awful. I wound up adding 3/4 of a jar of leftover Prego to mine and that actually made it FANTASTIC. I won't make this again, but what I will do is puree roasted red peppers and milk again and add it to my usual spaghetti sauce. Bottom line is that, as written, this recipe is NOT as good as its current star rating suggests. It needs effort (probably in the form of more cheese--a LOT more cheese) to make it worth the calories you're consuming.

Pretty darn good. It was a little bland for our taste so we added Cayenne pepper to taste. We were shooting for Pasta Bravo /Brio so we added the sauce to sauteed grilled chicken and mushrooms- yummy!

I used roasted red peppers from a antipasto bar at the supermarket and threw in a few marinated sundried tomatoes.  It was sooo good- not good for you.  I added chicken to it to make it a meal.  Added a little salt at the dinner table.

Oops.. I just finished eating the sauce and realized I forgot to add the cream. And yet it came out really good. I used jarred red peppers, basil, paprika, red pepper flakes, no butter (didn't miss it), olive oil taken from a sun-dried tomato jar and added a bit of store-bought tomato sauce to give it a saucy consistency. Really liked the results. Thanks!

This was really good.  I wanted to re-create one of my fave restuarant dishes, so I chose this recipe.  I used a 15 oz. jar of roasted red peppers.  Pureed everything with my immersion blender.  I served this over fresh spinach-ricotta raviloi, topped with shredded parm and drizzled with a balsamic reduction.  (Google "balsamic reduction recipe" if interested).  All of the flavors went so well together; this sauce was really highlighted by the balsamic.  A very good meal.  We ate less than half; I froze the other part.  Hopefully it will be just as good!

This was good but not great.  For me to keep a recipe this fattening it has to be excellent.  So I will probably pass on making it again.

I try to make it a habit not to give a recipe 5 stars when I have made a lot of changes, but the changes were mostly for the sake of food-allergies (and therefore substitutions), and the results were so unbelievable that I HAD to give the recipe 5 stars simply for being such a phenomenal base (my best friend, who recommended it, by the way, used it as written and said it was incredible).  With the following changes, my husband--who hates red peppers--added this recipe to his Top Ten Favorites (!!!!) after two bites.  WOW.  Here is what I did: Made 4 servings instead of 8.  Used 2 large red bell peppers and roasted as directed, then sauted them for 10 minutes with 1/4 cup packed minced yellow onion, 4 cloves of pressed garlic, 2 tbs. basil, 2 dashes cayenne pepper, 1/2 tsp. salt, 3/4 tsp. fennel seeds and 1 1/2 tbs. olive oil.  In a glass measuring cup, I whisked together 1/4 cup spelt flour, 1/4 cup unsweetened hemp milk, 2 oz. of creamy goat cheese and 1 oz. shredded smoked mozzarella cheese.  After blending the sauteed vegetables as directed, I added the cheese mixture and cooked it over medium heat while gradually adding approx. 1 cup chicken broth to thin it out a bit.  I then tossed it with 8 oz. of brown rice penne pasta and spicy Italian chicken sausage (that had been previously decased, sliced and sauteed until brown).  My husband ate a huge bowl of this, then asked if he could have the portions I had put aside for us to have for dinner tomorrow!  DEFINITELY a keeper!

I also used a jar of roasted red peppers but got the ones with carmelized onions.  It was wonderful on the chicken and spinach ravioli that I fixed it for.  Will save this recipe and use again.

I made this as directed except I used skim milk thickened with 1/4 all purpose flour in place of the half and half. I also used 2 (12 ounces each) jars of bottled roasted peppers (had on hand). Delicious, would make again.

I really enjoyed this easy recipe. I added mushrooms which I had sauteed in garlic and olive oil before making the sauce. I used red peppers from a jar to save time. I also added hot sauce to spice it up. Chili pepper flakes might be a good addition. Overall, my fiance and I really enjoyed it and will definitely make it again.

This sauce was absolutely delicious and very easy to make! I roasted the peppers in advance and refrigerated them, so I was able to make a quick but impressive weekday dinner. I followed the recipe exactly and will do the same in the future.

Not a bad sauce, but very creamy. Used a 12oz jar of peppers, could have used a 2nd or sun-dried tomatoes. Could cut the cream in half. Also, add more cheese, along with high quality cheese. Also, I added some corn starch, but add that to the cream while it's cold. I used fat-free half and half, that changes the texture more than the flavor.

This was WAY WAY WAY good! I didn't have fresh basil, so I just used dried italian seasoning but everything else I kept the same. Tossed on some linguine with some sauteed zucchini and yellow squash and it was a very yummy vegetarian meal!

Amazing. Such a nice change from the regular tomato based pasta sauces. I usually do 3-4 large cloves of garlic (personal taste) and use jarred roasted red peppers to cut down on time. I have spent the time to roast fresh peppers, and it is better, but most people dont have that kind of time. I also tend to use dried basil (I keep killing the basil plants I buy...) and do 1c 1/2&1/2 and 1c skim milk to cut the calories a bit. I tried it once with all skim, and it definetely lost something in both flavor and texture. I also cut the butter in 1/2 and use a parm/romano blend for the cheese. This is a definte treat in our house!

I use 2 blocks of cream cheese instead of the half and half and flour and the liquid from the roasted pepper jar

Smooth and mild, don't serve with something that will overpower it. Easy if you use jar red peppers. Took me less than 5 minute to put together.

First of all, I cut down prep time by using about 3/4 jar of roasted red peppers. This meal came together very quickly and easily. I served it over spinach ravioli, which I thought was a perfect match. Flavor was great, but the texture was very soupy. I even had to add some cornstarch to thicken it up. I don't think all the butter is necessary, and some crushed red pepper flakes would be a welcome addition. But, on the whole, we really liked this sauce as a nice change of pace from regular red sauces.

Fantastic Recipe!  It's worth roasting your own peppers, just make sure to completely blacken the skins.  I also added about 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper to give it a little extra flavor.

The sauce was light--but not on flavor. I'll add more red peppers next time to make them stand out.

This sauce was excellent. My husband can't stop talking about it. I ended up using jarred roasted red peppers. I didn't have any Cream so I used milk instead and just added a little extra cheese to thicken it up. Definently a keeper.

Fantastic, tasty, delicious!  I skipped the butter and used olive oil instead, also I used some skim milk in place of some of the half and half to make this a little healthier.  It was so tasty... a party in your mouth. :)  Thanks for sharing!

This was tasty and very easy.  I used fat free 1/2 1/2.  I also used some jared and some fresh roasted peppers.  I added juice from the jar and less oil in the sauce pan in order to cut down on some of the fat.  The butter at the end does add to this dish!
1/21/2011.. update.... just made this again for a bunch of foodies and they LOVED IT!!  Added lots more garlic because we like it heavily seasoned !!

So Yummy! I changed the recipe just a bit - I roasted a big red pepper and a small one, cut up the garlic and used fresh basil - then i put it in a container for 2 days (not really planned but it happened that way)i got it out, took a can of roasted peppers from a jar and added them in, cooked them in the skillet to warm, added the milk (I used 3/4 cup 1% milk with about a 1/4 cup half and half) I didn't puree, left it chunky and added only 1 Tbsp. of butter -It really was great - the only thing I would change is adding the whole 2 cups of milk/half and half because there just wasn't that much liquid.....otherwise it is awesome and will make it again!

Fantastic! I added onions and a yellow bell pepper like some people suggested, and also added some cooked Italian sausage slices while simmering. Served over farfalle. Best pasta dish I've had in a long long time!

Good recipe, I followed it exactly but reduced the amount of cream as there were only 2 of us!  It made a very rich and tasty sauce that I would definitely make again.  
I used this sauce with the Gnochi I recipe from this site.

Very good. I left out the butter, used jarred peppers, & didn't puree. There was great flavor. Next time I'm going to add sautéed onions, mushrooms, and perhaps artichoke hearts to give it a more chunky, veggie taste. Served over rotini twirls.

I wanted it even lighter than the last reviewer, so I added a can of plum tomatoes and 3/4 cups of mushrooms for a meater flavor.  I cut down the cream to 1/2cup.  I put it on penne and the whole family loved it.  I will definately make it again.

I've made this recipe twice;  the first time using 15 oz. jars of red peppers and the second time using fresh red peppers.  Fresh is still best.  I added pieces of chicken that I had previously boiled in garlic, oregano, sea salt and paprika.  I used it over spaghetti I had made.  It was fabulous!!!  Well worth the time and effort to broil the peppers.

I used a jar of roasted red peppers and fat-free half and half...so maybe that made a big difference...  But the sauce came out a bit chunky and the flavor just wasn't great.  I won't make this again and will probably end up throwing the sauce I froze.

I had a bag of mini peppers that I wanted to use up so I roasted them and made this sauce. The pepper part was a lot of work (slippery little things were challenging to peel) but the flavor was AWESOME!
I grilled some chicken breast and garlic & mozzarella chicken sausage and tossed it all into lb of linguini. Served with garlic foccacia bread sticks. Family was super impressed and even our picky 12 yr old loved it & had seconds. Thanks for a great sauce idea. I tend to cook to taste so I did add more basil, garlic & pepper towards the end. Delish!!! Will definitely make again - with full size peppers. :)

This is such a great sauce! I serve it with chicken (whole grilled breasts or bite-size strips) or shrimp, and both are equally delicious. I must admit that, as written, I find it a wee bit sweet, so I add some diced store-bought tomatoes to the skillet, which adds a nice bit of acidity. Some diced red onion is good, and I usually substitute a splash of heavy cream for the half as well. Good stuff! Thanks, BOB!

I tried this recipe because my husband is newly allergic to tomatoes. We both loved it!  Roasting the peppers was easy but definitely time consuming. It does make a ton, though. We used left overs as a pizza sauce a few days later ( delicious by the way ), and we still had more to freeze.

My wife and I loved this sauce. We let the peppers cool for less than 10 minutes due to time constraints and they came out great. We topped it over linguini but mixed in dreamed clams, mussels and shrimp with sauteed onions. What a great feast with Italian bread. Loved it!

Cooked according to recipe except added Italian Sausage(spicy). It had a wonderful taste and the consistency of the sauce was perfect. Not to runny or to thick. This was an easy dish to prepare and was delicious!

This turned out great! A real hit with my family. I roasted the red peppers on the stove top instead of in the broiler and, once they were off the heat, I cut into them immediately. I also used heavy cream and forwent the butter. Definitely saving this recipe!

I also used jarred red peppers but will roast my own next time. Not a big deal. Gets better the next day and with a little added tomato sauce, even better. I added a pinch of chili pepper flakes to give it some zing and found it delicious on ravioli for a meat free night and also on pasta. Good addition to my New York Italian cooking...

Delicious,  my son said this was the best thing I have ever made.  I made it twice in one week.  We used sautéed chicken and whatever noodles we had on hand.  I am not a cook at all so the difficulty level for me was about a 7.  Now that I know you can get roasted red peppers in a jar I am sure this will help tremendously with time and difficulty.

This was a great tasting sauce.  I was initially hesitant because I thought that the red pepper flavor would be too strong, but it isn't. I used 10 oz of jarred roasted red peppers and reduced the half and half to 1 1/4 cups and it worked really well. Next time I may use a couple of tablespoons of jarred pesto sauce insead of the fresh basil and also puree the peppers first, just to save the time/effort. 
I'll be making this again... for company!

very good idea the roasted peper give excellant taste to the sauce.
alghou i used almond milk and put cheese only for my Swiss husbend.
it was similer to the alfredo sauce wich i make for him....but a littel better.
oh and i roasted the  pepper in the hoven in 250 c degree 
and one plate was broken from the heat as result.:(
but the smile of my husbend worth it:)

I thought about using jarred red peppers, but decided it was about time I learned how to roast them myself.  It was fairly easy, but the recipe doesn't mention that you need to turn them once the top begins to blacken.  For me, that started about 5 minutes into the process and took me about 25 minutes.  This will vary greatly depending on the size of your pepper.  As an alternative to putting them in a plastic bag, you can also put them in bowl sealed with plastic wrap.  In case you're wondering, the purpose of this step is to loosen the skin.  In the end, this was good, but not any better than tomato-basil cream sauces that I make (and it took much longer).

Amazing sauce! I did add sauteed onions, extra roasted garlic (we love it!), fresh spinach leaves and roasted eggplant cubes. I served it over whole wheat pasta, since I had it on hand, served with a salad. The base for this sauce can be made in large batches and frozen for later with no change in taste. My teen sons, dad and hubby loved it! Thanks for an amazing recipe!

This is so bland and grainy I would not make it again.  Flavorless, boring.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I've had red pepper sauce before that I once described as one of the best things I ever had in my mouth.  THIS ISN'T IT!  Next time I'll use peppers from a jar (and a different recipe!). For one thing these won't puree because the mixture is too dry.

Definately will be making this again!  The only change I made was using 1 cup lowfat milk and 1 cup half-and-half to help cut down some of the calories.  I served over pasta with chicken and it was perfect.  Next time I think I will try it over tortellini.

This sauce is going to become a staple in my pasta repertoire. It's VERY good, very easy, and very customizable - it's good with a mix of red and yellow peppers, with sautéed onion added in, with dried basil (I'm sure it's better with fresh, though, if you have it), less butter, a touch of white wine, Parmesan cheese instead of Romano, red pepper flakes, etc. Highly recommended!

I followed the recipe but i roasted the peppers, pureed them with the onions & garlic prior to adding the chicken broth & I added cayenne. After the 1st 1-2 bites I wasnt sure if it was worth the effort, but then I let it cool for about 15 minutes & came back to taste it again & it was really really good. However, i'm only giving it 4 stars bc it isnt quite as good as Wagners Bakery in Olympia, WA. Their roasted red pepper soup is what inspired me to search for a recipe.

I THOUGHT THIS WAS BLAND AND JUST NOT VERY GOOD.  I USED JARRED ROASTED PEPPERS AND FAT FREE HALF AND HALF BUT THAT SHOULDN'T MAKE THAT BIG A DIFFERENCE SINCE I ALWAYS SUB FF 1/2 AND 1/2 AND IT NEVER AFFECTS THE RECIPE.  AND I CAN'T IMAGINE THE JARRED PEPPERS ARE THAT MUCH DIFFERENT TO MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE.  READ THE ONE STAR REVIEWS BEFORE YOU MAKE THIS.  NOT SURE WHAT TO DO TO SPRUCE THIS UP FOR MY TASTES BUT IT'S GOING TO TAKE QUITE A BIT.

This is super good and super easy. I was able to peel the skin off the peppers almost right after I took them out of the oven which saved some time. Next time I will save myself more time and clean up by making the sauce in a pot instead of a pan and using my immersion blender to blend the sauce. I didn't end up using the 2 cups of half and half, I used one and I think next time I'm not going to use as much butter either. I served the sauce over penne and it was perfect.

OMG - I haven't even put the cheese in yet and I'm in love (dreamy sigh).  Lightly blended the peppers instead of a total puree and (based on reviews that people liked a thicker sauce) have only eyeballed liquid - about half of what was called for.  Can NOT wait for dinner tonight!

Very tasty.  Used a jar of roasted red peppers (drained), sauteed those with a little bit of onion and the garlic.  Used about 1T dried basil.  Pureed, then cooked up a pound of Italian sausage before adding the half&half and (parmesan) cheese.  Did not add addt'l butter as we felt it was rich enough.  Served over fettucini.  Sweet, creamy, and filling.

This recipe was wonderful!  I made a few slight modifications to best suit my likings (and for the time I had to make and what was in the fridge).  Rather than grilling the peppers, I went right to sauting them with garlic and included a few scallions for added flavor.  I did not have fresh basil available so I simply used the dried seasonings which was still great.  Because I like a hint of tomato in my cream sauce, I added a few tablespoons of tomato paste.  I also love my food with a kick so I added red pepper flakes for a little spice.  I couldn't believe how great this recipe was!!

this is the BEST roasted red pepper sauce I have ever made, had or tasted!  absolutely delish!   We did not have enough fresh basil on hand so I did add some dried as well.  Also did not have romano cheese so subed parm for it and it was fine.  Added a couple dashes of garlic salt at the end instead of reg. salt.  My husband almost licked his plate.  Does make quite a bit of sauce....good for sopping up with some good crusty baguettes!  totally worth making!

This is a great alternative for kidney dialysis patients (like myself) who are barred from tomato products because of high potassium.  I am roasting the red peppers in the oven and trying skim evaporated milk instead of cream to save on calories.  Tomorrow I am using this sauce to make a "version" of eggplant parmesan.  With non-fat mozzarella cheese.

This was a great recipe. Was my first time attempting....Gave it a 4 for a few reasons. I did not add as much cream as the recipe calls for ( but this is personal preference) i suggest just adding it slowly to see where you like it best. I did not have time (or fresh peppers) to roast, so I used a jar of roasted red peppers that I had in the cupboard. Also, had no fresh basil....could not find any in my local store when I shopped early in the week, and have killed my plant by using it so much....lol..so I used dried.Served it by itself on pasta, hubby liked it, but am thinking that it would be great with some chicken breast, and maybe a veg or two to give it some fullness (or heartiness, whichever you prefer...:D ) In any case, I will be making this as my sauce instead of buying it when I want this pasta......thanks so much!!!

Added an ounce of pine nuts to the roasted pepper and basil mix, then processed in the food processor and added a half teaspoon of flour as it was cooking with the cream.  Delicious!

This sauce is amazing. I loved it! I didn't change a thing. Next time I make this I will probably double the recipe to have extra sauce for another meal. *** Made this a second time and wasn't paying attention and ended up omitting the butter on accident and couldn't tell. It was still really really good. No need to add the butter IMO. Save some calories.

It was just ok for our tastes, but I've never had or made red pepper cream sauce before, so I won't fault the recipe.  For the time involved, didn't quite seem worth it.

I've been looking for a recipe like this for a long time. It's just what I was looking for! The only thing I did different was that I added some chili powder for a little zip. It's a keeper!

Where is the 10th star?  No really, I would rate it a 10 if it where available.  Absolutely delicious is how I describe this.  I cheated and purchased Roasted Red Peppers instead.  Next time I 'may' be brave enough to try roasting the red peppers myself.  My 16 yr old son only mentioned he would have liked it to be a little more spicier but he thought it looked more like butter chicken; so guess he was expecting it to taste like it :)  Everyone loved it.  I knew before serving it how good it was.  I had a little set aside....a good cook samples, right?  I poured this over Buitoni's Chicken & Prosciutto Tortelloni, along with a small side salad with my special garlic/butter toasted bread and YUM is all I can say.  Very excited to report about this sauce; I'm even up before 7AM just to rate it!

If your tired of regular parmeasan alfreado sauce. Try this it's yummy!! Except make it exactly as the recipe goes. I tried to make it low fat and didn't like it as much. Just go for a walk afterward.

We really enjoyed this sauce.  I used it over home-made gnocchi.  I had to substitute a few things because I was pressed for time.  I used milk and added low-fat cream cheese to give it a thick, rich flavor.  Then I added some mozzarella cheese and thickened it with cornflour/starch.  It worked well.

I made two sauces last night, this one and a pesto from this site.  They were both wonderful but this one was the winner.  I omitted the butter and the cheese and didn't miss them.  It was excellent!  So much flavor!  Will definitely make again.  Thanks!

The sauce was pretty good.  The only changes I made were to use 1 red and 1 yellow pepper instead of 2 red (what I had on hand), 1% milk instead of cream and a whole bulb (about 8 cloves) of roasted garlic (cooked with the peppers) instead of the raw garlic.  I also thickened the sauce with about 4 tbsp of flour.  The only change that I would make is to cut out half of the cream/milk and to use 3 peppers instead of 2.  The puree before adding the milk was delicious, but after it was a little bland.  Make sure to season well.  I poured the sauce over Spaghettini with grilled chicken.

This sauce is delicious! I make a healthier version by cutting the oil in half, using 1 cup of fat free half & half instead of 2 cups regular, and omitting the butter altogether. I also like to throw in about 1/2 cup chopped onion. This sauce pairs well with shrimp and asparagus over angel hair.

I used a hand mixer instead of a blender to have a few chunks of red pepper in the sauce.  It was thick and didn't need flour as some bloggers mentioned. I did think it was very bland.  It definitely needs a lot of seasoning and some kick.  It is a good base, but there is plenty of room for improvement.

2 thumbs up!  This was great.  I decided not to use jarred peppers, so I roasted my own.  I only used a little bit of half & half and then just used skim milk for the rest.  I had mine over cheese & spinach tortilini.  Next time, I might just add a bit more garlic & pepper.

This is a great recipe. Better and much cheaper than you would get in an Italian restaurant. I used grilled red peppers from a jar and parmesan cheese instead of Romano. The whole family loved it. A definate keeper.

Although this was nice, I found it lacking in flavor. I added crushed red pepper (a couple pinches), extra garlic, and more salt and pepper than I would have expected I'd need. After that, it was pretty good! I didn't think it would need the butter but it definitely helped the flavor.

Was ok, but definitely needed a bit of help to kick it up a bit.  I added crushed red pepper and cyan pepper to taste, and it definitely did the trick.

This sauce is really great, I like to use it with the Bertolli stuffed pasta.  Just last night I decided to use this sauce as a twist on the regular chicken alfredo pizza I make, turned out really great.

I'm not a big cream sauce (except vodka cream sauce), but this was very good. I used jarred roasted peppers due to time constraints.  I also cut the half and half down by about 1/2 cup (or less) and added a little cornstarch to it before adding to the sauce as another reviewer suggested.  I thought it was a tiny bit too thick so I would try without the cornstarch next time.  One thing I will play around with is giving it some kick.  It was good, but slightly bland.  My 8 year old loved it.  My husband said he really liked it because the peppers didn't overpower the sauce.  This would be delicious with some grilled chicken added.

I like to spice it up with some tabasco.  You can add more cheese to thicken and also use as a dip for salmon cakes!

I followed the recipe exactly, and used it over a wonton ravioli recipe I found. It was totally awesome!
My mistake was not noticing that the wonton recipe was for 4 and the sauce was for 8, well my husband ate half of the sauce anyway, he loved it so much.
we decided we liked it so much we'd have to make it less fattening so we can have it often!
One thing we did was roast the peppers, and make the sauce up to adding the cream, and made the insides for the wontons one day and then we finished the sauce and wontons for dinner the next. Really worked out well!
thanks!

i made this sauce, unknowningly, with 3 roasted HOT red peppers.  so i didn't have to add any spice since the sauce was hot enough.  i don't have a food processor and i'm sure the sauce would have been creamier if i did have one.  also, i can't get basil from where i'm living, china, so i didn't add that and i'm sure it would have added another layer.  i will make this again when i have all the proper tools...

My husband and I loved this sauce. I did saute some onions with the peppers before pureeing everything. It was a nice change from tomato sauce, and while it was time consuming (though I know that could be cut down by using jarred roasted peppers), it was easy. I served this with grilled steaks and pasta. I can't wait to make this again.

Totally awesome to the taste buds!  I made it with Italian meatballs in the crockpot, so I didn't need as much of the half and half.  I used 3/4 cup only, used a 15 oz. jar of roasted red peppers and blended the whole thing together in the processor skipping the cooking step first. Poured the whole thing over Italian meatballs in the crockpot for 4 hours on low and it was the best.  I also added fresh oregano from my garden and a couple bay leaves.  This will be made often I can tell!  I served it over stir fried shredded cabbage.  A good low carb meal.

I'm going to say I'm confused as to how this recipe got such glowing reviews. It appears to be missing something. I noticed that the majority of ravers changed the recipe by adding onions, paprika, etc. Maybe that was it. I followed the directions exactly and didn't change a thing and it was good but not great. Nothing about it jumps out at you (my husband's words). I might try again with addl ingredients for more flavor because it really needs it.

Really enjoyed it...added heavy cream instead of half and half, and also added a large can of plum tomatoes for bulk.  The grocery was out of Romano cheese, so I used Asiago and it was a pretty good substitution.  Will make again.

I followed the recipe to a T and it turned out quite thin.  In fact, I ended up serving it with spoons.  Perhaps next time I'll try less cream or adding some flour to thicken.
The flavor, however, was unreal.  The roasted peppers came through to just the right degree and the sweet finish complimented my 4 cheese tortellini perfectly!

Great recipe, thanks!

This sauce is... incredible. It is truly the best thing I have ever made. I did not use pre-made roasted red peppers, and am glad for that even though it took more time. I also have found that I really like it if the consistency is a little more chunky. I've never used a blender, just a chopper.

I will definitely make this again.  I used jarred peppers, added 1/2 tsp dried sage, and did not add the butter. It worked great over farfalle with veggie sausage and roasted acorn squash.  Awesome sauce!

This was fantastic, even after I made a couple changes to make this lower cal/lower fat.  Instead of the half and half, I used half skim milk and half neufchatel.  I used an immersion blender, so this sauce was not lumpy whatsoever.  It was smooth and creamy and wonderful.  Oh, I also doubled the amount of fresh basil to suit our own tastes.  This will be made again.

yes, this ends up somewhat lumpy, but it's still a good sauce.  I might try using a mortar to smush the pepper even more next time.

Omit the butter, not needed IMO.

I also add some cayenne to the cream mixture as it's thickening.

To easily peel the peppers, slice them down the length of it on one side - then open and flatten the entire pepper skin side up on your cutting board.  Scrape your knife blade down the length of the pepper and the skin will easily come off.

Oh my...we loved this!  And this is coming from someone who isn't a huge fan of red peppers.  I cut the recipe in half and used the roasted red peppers from my grocery store.  I also added a medium shallot which I finely diced.  The only other changes I made were to reduce the amount of butter to 1 Tbsp, but IMHO you could probably omit the butter altogether.  I also forgot to add the cheese but we just sprinkled it on our pasta at the end and it was fine.  In the end, I whipped this up in about 20 minutes and it was just delicious...a keeper for sure!

Excellent Sauce.  I roasted the red peppers on my outdoor grill-be sure to blackened them well.  Added a touch of white wine at the end to thin the sauce out a little bit.  This recipe is a definate keeper.  Try it - you won't be disappointed.

Excellent, rich thick and creamy - made with double the peppers. Exactly what I was looking for in a creamy pasta sauce, considering I can't get enough of roasted peppers these days.

I have made this twice.  Both times it tasted great.  The first time was a little runny so the second time I used three peppers instead of 2.  I use cream instead of half-and-half and only used 1 1/4 cups, and I can't get romano cheese here (China) so used a combo of mozzarella and parmesan.  All-in-all a great recipe - the only down side are the dishes :o)

Very good recipe!  My hubby loved it, though I was looking for something more cheesy.  I cut down the half/half to 1 1/2 cups, but will cut it more (1 cup).  Served with Bob Evans Italian Sausage shaped in to meatballs and spaghetti.  Thank you Bob!

Very Good. Goes well with chicken and seafood.  I usually add a bit more ground pepper though to give it more of a spicy flavor.

This is a nice, light tasting sauce.  I used fat free half-n-half and roasted peppers from a jar.  This sauce definately needs thickening.

This recipe was ok. I thought it was a little bland, but my husband liked it. It was not as flavorful and creamy as I would have liked, and as I have had in similar sauces.

Excellent recipe, even using a 19 oz bottle of roasted peppers, drained,  instead of roasting my own.

Easy, quick and delish.  I followed the recipe except I may not be the most accurate one who measure.  The sauce had a nice mix of heat ( crushed red pepper), savory (basil,onion and garlic) and sweetness from the red bell pepper.  I served the sauce over cheese ravioli.  Loved it.

There was enough sauce leftover  to freeze for another quick dinner in the future.

Absolutely delicious! I added some cayenne for a spicy kick and it was awesome! I plan to use jarred roasted red peppers next time to cut out the majority of the prep time.

Excellent flavor even though I had only one red pepper, so had to use one green as a substitute.  I might try adding some red pepper flakes next time to spice it up slightly, but really enjoyed it as it.

I made the sauce to serve over swordfish and rice.  I only added 1/2 cup half and half and did not add the cheese.    I thought all the half and half and cheese would take away from the flavor and brightness of the peppers and basil.  So glad I followed my instincts.  It was great!  I will definitely add the cheese when I make the sauce for pasta.

Like other cooks I used roasted red peppers from a jar. I substituted Parmesan for Romano. I also found it a little bland but I I added a sprig of cilantro at the end. Perfect solution!

This is wonderful! All three kids, four and under will eat it too! I've always roasted the peppers, skinned and de-seeded them then thrown the cheese, peppers, milk, and garlic into the Vitamix then cooked on the stove. Besides roasting the peppers it takes hardly any time or effort this way. We've eaten it with veggies, pasta, roasted cauliflower ravioli, and on rice. I usually make enough to freeze for a quick dinner later on.

The recipe isn't particularly flavorful, but I also admit I didn't follow instructions to a T. I mixed in some chicken bits cooked in a garlic & herb mix and paired it with thin spaghetti. Personally I think I'll add some garlic to my leftovers and next time I want to experiment with this recipe I'll go a bit lighter on the basil since I used dried.

This was such a good sauce!!!! I wanted to make it a little healthier, so I forwent the butter and half and half and just used 2% milk, and it was as rich or creamy (of course) but it was still very delicious and a little healthier! I added a fan of drained crush tomatoes and onions to the pan when cooking to garlic and peppers, and it really added a nice, more complex flavor. But it's delicious as is, too! Great recipe

Made this with a jar of fire roasted peppers from Costco and served it over home made chicken fingers and rice. I did make sure I had enough salt added. It was great! So easy and soooo good. Try those tomato's from the jar. It's awesome and makes it much easier.

I made it the first time according to the recipe for my girlfriend. She liked it a lot but asked me to try 3/4 cup cheese rather than 1/4 and 1 cup half n half rather than 2. She liked this version even better because it made the sauce thicker. I made this slightly modified version with spinach linguine and this is now her favorite meal I cook for her. Also, I put the pasta in the sauce and stirred it around on medium for 5 minutes. This allows the flavors to mix. I am now in very good standing with her! Don't be afraid to change things a little. Good luck!

So good! I roasted 3 peppers (2 red and 1 yellow), but next time will roast 4 to get that extra pepper taste.  I will probably use jarred roasted peppers to save on time.  Instead of half and half I used low-fat milk and 2T of flour. I omitted the butter - it was unnecessary. Lastly, I used Parmesan cheese because it's what I had on hand. My husband loved it and so did I.

Terrific recipe. The only change I made was I used 2 red peppers, 1 orange pepper, 1 jalepeno (which I roasted with along with the others) and a touch more basil. The reason for the extra peppers is because I had some extra that I did not want to throw away. I will definitely make this again, maybe without jalepeno next time. Great on panini's and in pasta, or any chicken dish. Thanks for the delicious sauce recipe!

I love this sauce!  I didn't have any fresh basil so I left it out.  I used parmesan instead of Romano cheese because that's what I had but Romano has a more robust flavor so next time I'll make sure that's what I have.  I put it over spinach ravioli and grilled chicken.  Yum!

I deglazed the pan with white wine before returning the blended pepper mix, and reduced it with some chicken stock before adding half the cream, instead of all two cups of cream.  Made with tortellini, it was delicious!

This sauce has instantly become a staple recipe of ours. The flavors in this sauce match so well together and give such a rich flavor it's amazing. My wife and I literally licked our plates clean of the sauce and seriously contemplated cooking up more noodles to use the leftover sauce for a "dessert" because we enjoyed it so much.  We look forward to making this again and again.

This sauce was amazing! I used roasted red peppers from a jar rather than roasting my own. Also- I found that you can substitute a bit of cream cheese for the Romano, works perfectly. The sauce was robust and flavorful, better than any I have had in restaurants. I spooned it over chicken breasts and green chile risotto. Great recipe!

I roasted the red peppers from my CSA the night before when grilling dinner.  Stored them in olive oil in the fridge.  Used fresh basil, half whipping cream, half whole milk; and followed the recipe exactly.  

I used more than a pinch of salt to bring out the flavor, and next time I might try a little cayenne pepper to jazz up all the mild dairy.  (I don't like spicy food, but this is very mild).  

I used the sauce to top cheese tortellini, as recommended.  A delicious late summer meal!  I didn't feel bad about the calories at all--it is very rich and filling, so it takes very little to make a surprisingly satisfying portion.

This was fantastic! My husband asked me to make it again less than a week after I made it the first time. The only changes I made was to use 3 peppers and fat free half and half. Will definitely be adding this to my favorites. Thanks!

Fantastic!  I used parm instead of Romano and whipping cream instead of 1/2 &. 1/2 b/c that all I had in the fridge, and it was great.

Great sauce! the only thing I did differently, was that I only used 1/2 the amount of half and half because I was afraid that it would make the sauce too thin. What great flavors! I served it over fresh green Linguini and steamed asparagus. This one is a definite keeper!

We used mozzarella cheese, chives, two tsp of cornstarch and basil leaves (not fresh). Wonderful! My husband is the pickiest eater and this made his night!

Those who rated this recipe "bland" must not have functioning taste buds!! This was excellent and the only thing I did different was to use one reviewers recommendation to add some red pepper flakes and grilled chicken strips. Will definitely be making this again and again! Thanks for submitting this awesome recipe Bob Bailey!

Great recipe! A family's favorite. My son always request for this recipe. My husband doesn't like Alfredo sauce like me and the kids so I wanted to find a pasta sauce that we can all enjoy. We all love it so much that I make this recipe every time we want pasta. Very tasty like restaurant quality. I also use the red peppers jar and half and half and I cut down on the basil a bit and use 3t salt.  Perfect!

For the sake of time I used jarred peppers. I had cream so I used it. I added a  few shakes of cayenne and allspice.  Yum, yum!  For the rest of the dish I sautéed onions, mushrooms, threw in some sliced grilled chicken, added a few handfuls of baby spinach. After the spinach wilted I added cooked penne and then the sauce to that. Topped with some more Romano/parm. Tasted like our favorite restaurant's meal.  A keeper!

I used it with cooked lentils and chickpeas, and it was fabulous. Ten people agreed. Substituting half-and-half with regular milk and the Romano cheese with mozzarella works great! In addition, don't feel shy with the cheese. I also added cumin and hot curry powder. Fantastic! Will use again.

Love LOVE this!  Easy to make and ever so delicious!  Huge hit with the family.  Served over chicken-stuffed ravioli.  Creamy, flavorful sauce, with all the right nuances of savory and spiciness.  So glad to have found this recipe.  Will be a regular addition to our menu. :o)  Also made it with jarred marinated roasted red peppers (due to time constraints) and it was fast, easy, perfect. Divoon!

First tasted this in a great restaurant.  Thought I'd try it at home.  Superb!!!! Had it wit big ricotta spinach stuffed ravioli.  Not the lightest of meals, but for a pasta night .. Just beautiful.   Can't wait to make for a gathering.. It's beautiful and delicious !! Served this with a cabbage slaw/arugula salad.

I LOVE this and everyone that I have made it for either wants me to make it again or give them the recipe.  Like others, I play with my food and used milk (2%) and cornstarch for thickener and a little more cheese (so much for saved calories), the last time it was a 4 cheese pasta blend.  I also have added mushrooms which I love with the red peppers.  When red peppers were on sale I roasted a bunch under the broiler and froze them and they were just as wonderful.    Thanks for my favorite pasta sauce.

I absolutely love this recipe! I have been searching all over for a good recipe for roasted red pepper cream sauce and I'm glad I chose this one. I followed the recipe the first time and loved it but thought I could make it better. The 2nd time I made the sauce I added about a tablespoon of sugar, more of the romano cheese (I recommend grating your own DON'T USE THE STUFF IN THE PLASTIC CONTAINERS), and just a little dash of flour.

This is so yummy and very forgiving.  I made as written with only a few adjustments (added one more red pepper, used half and half and milk and halved the butter)  SO GOOD and will definitely make again.

I only cooked enough for 4 servings, but used the amount of red pepper for the original recipe.  My husband thought it tasted like a sauce he's had on etouffee at a Cajun style restaurant it was that good.

With the exception of using Parmesan instead of Romano, I followed this recipe exactly. It came out very soupy. I had high hopes, especially when cooking the peppers, garlic, and basil for 10 minutes. The house was very fragrant. After adding the HH and cheese, I tasted it and it was SO bland. So, I added at least a cup more cheese, salt and pepper, onion and garlic powder. Fortunately, I don't plan on serving this until tomorrow, so hopefully the flavors will mingle over night and it will thicken a bit. I will use this as a base recipe, but next time I'll chop up some onion, double the garlic, and add salt and pepper while those are cooking. I know Romano and Parmesan are made from different milks (one's goat the other's cow), so perhaps using Romano will help next time too.

I am a tomato cream sauce fan so this was a lovely change for us. A nice light flavored sauce. I agree i would like it a bit thicker, may lessen the 1/2 and 1/2 amount next time. Great for meat free night meal.  Actually it was better the next day..perhaps with shrimp?!?! Oh the possibilities!!

Overall a good sauce, but afterwards it just left a weird taste.  I reduced the half & half and butter so it wouldn't be so rich.

Great easy sauce. I used whipping cream, cutting down the measurement to 1 cup and added 1 cup of milk instead. I didn't add any butter at the end. A really nice change from tomato based sauce

Wonderful recipe! This approxmates the red pepper cream sauce at my favorite Italian family restaurant! I followed the recipe, roasting the red peppers on my gas grill, except I added a chopped onion and a 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes to the vegetable mixture. After pureeing the veggies in my food processor, I returned to mixture to the pan on low heat and gradually added half and half, while stirring, until it was the consistency I wanted. I would estimate approximately 1 cup of half and half. I made the sauce before beginning the rest of the meal, so it had thickend up by the time the tortellini were ready for the sauce. I added a small amount of pasta water to loosen the sauce, which added to the silkiness of it. This was a big hit with my husband and I can't wait to make it for my daughter who is crazy for this sauce. Thanks Bob!

This. Is. Delicious. I skipped the basil, used milk and a few pats of butter instead of the 4 tbsp, and added some onions and parsley, which I cooked with the garlic and red pepper. SO good.

Absolutely delicious! My husband loved this sauce, and said it was a terrific alternative to normal hum-drum tomato sauce. Definitely worth the time and effort to prepare. BRAVO!

I tried roasted red pepper cream sauce for the first time several weeks ago at a fancy restaurant and loved it so much I couldn't get it out of my head. When I saw this recipe I had to try it. The only alteration I made was a touch less cream and crushed red pepper flakes. It was SO good my family and I couldn't have been happier with the results. Surprisingly it tasted exactly like the restaurant dish. I put this over a penne pasta with simple grilled chicken cubes. Bravo!

This was great!  I made some alterations based on what I had on hand, and it turned out delicious.  I cut the recipe in half too.  Keeping that in mind, I used: 1 1/2 TBSP EVOO, 1 jarred roasted red pepper (whole), 2 cloves of garlic pressed, 2 tsp of dried basil, one cup of silk almond milk, a small handful of shredded cheddar cheese and 2 TBSP of flour!  No butter and no extra salt and pepper. It was AWESOME!!  Thanks!

i used jar bell peppers as well. If you peel the skin off some sausage (i used parsley & cheese sausge) and then break the sausage off in small meat ball sized pieces and allow the meat to cook in the sauce it adds a great flavor to the sauce and adds meat as well. its quite good!

This is delicious.  I don't think raosting peppers really takes long at all. I do prep a little differently though.  I usually roast them, take the skins off and throw them in the food processor with the garlic.  I add olive oil to pan and add the processed peppers and garlic and saute until garlic is tender.  I then add the cream and romano cheese.  I leave out the basil mainly because I usually don't have fresh basil on hand. Great recipe.  Thanks.

This sauce is excellent and actually very easy to make. DO NOT use fat free half and half to try to save calories.  Will make again and again.

I made a half-batch because of the previous reviews and it was the perfect amount.  Always in search of meat-alternatives: My vegetarian boyfriend loved it.  He wasn't feeling well...said he would try it anyway...and ate the whole bowl.  Served it on miracle noodles since I cut out carbs...stuck perfectly to those slippery little guys.  I will make it again and again.

Okay, this sauce is ridiculous.  I have made it as written and it is unbelievable.  Now, I save all my garden red peppers for this (basil is always in abundance at that time) and make as much as I can because it freezes perfect.  I cut the olive oil and butter in half (still soooo rich) and double the romano, basil, and garlic now, but it really is CRAZY delicious!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I get to eat it all winter if I can fight everyone off the red peppers.

It's a good base recipe for sure. I made this last night and I'm actually surprised I haven't seen any other comments to this effect. This is the first pasta cream sauce recipe I've seen that used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of heavy cream.  I used jarred roasted peppers which was much easier & faster.  The flavor was great with a little salt & pepper.  I did find though that because of the 1/2 & 1/2 that it was a little thinner than my taste, so I think I'll do as some others and use flour in the middle or add corn starch to thicken it more.  In general, it's a great taste & nice to have something different that the usual white sauces.  I added more cheese to try & thicken it a little...which didn't really work, but I also didn't like the added flavor of cheese when I really wanted to taste only the pepper taste.  Just FYI in case you think of it.

This was very good!I wasn't sure I wanted all of the fat content as written and therefore, I used 1 C. fat free half and half and 1 C. milk with some cornstarch to thicken. I also used jarred red peppers. I served it with butternut squash ravioli and chicken & broccoli on the side; however, it was good all mixed together. Can't wait to make this again!

So much flavor, love this divine sauce.  Served the sauce over rigatoni with fresh asparagus as a side dish. Simple and delicious dinner! I added just a bit of red pepper flakes and also threw in some roasted poblano pepper and sun-dried tomatoes that I had in the frig. I plan to keep a jar of this sauce in the freezer.

Really yummy.  Used jarred peppers. Added pepper flakes for more depth.  Would have liked it to be a bit thicker next time so may add flour or cornstarch.  I made this in conjunction with Alfredo Lasagna Roll-ups from this site.

Used Roasted red peppers from the jar, and this is pretty good, but I found it to be bland. Had to throw in additional spices to kick it up a notch. Would make again for a quick meal, but nothing super special. Sorry!

This was delicious! I used skim milk and flour instead of the half and half and it came out beautifully! I would recommend putting th flour into the pepper mixture before blending, allowing the flour particles to soak up the oil so they wont clump together in later steps. A great recipe I will be using again and again!

This was so good, we absolutely loved it!  Even my picky nine year old liked it and my one year old kept saying mmmm every time he took a bite. My husband said this morning it was so good that he dreamt about it. We can't wait to make this again.  I didn't change much but added asiago cheese instead of romano and only one tablespoon of butter.  I roasted my own peppers, I believe that is definitely better than the kind in the jar.  I tossed this sauce with some linguine. So good!

Really good.  I used a hand mixer rather than putting it in a blender.

This sauce is SO GOOD!  I've made it with both jarred peppers and freshly roasted under the broiler..  I sautee onions with the garlic for a little extra flavor, and hubby likes to add a bunch of fresh grated Parmesan..  It's great over spinach or mushroom ravioli or pasta and grilled chicken..  This sauce is so easy to make and tastes just as good (if not better!) than what you can get at a restaurant..

We loved this.  We had leftover and i pureed a couple of chili peppers and added that to give a spicy flavor and that was good too.

I've made this recipe for years!  Absolutely fabulous.  I do, however, use Parmesan cheese instead.  It gives you that umami kick.

This was very tasty but a LOT (underlined) of work. I would be inclined to use the jar of roasted peppers. When in the blender, add about a half cup of the half & half so it will fully puree rather than chop. My sister made this and added shrimp, served over penne pasta....EXCELLENT!!  If using a full pound of pasta, I would double the recipe as the pasta really drinks it up. Also pass a little extra cheese.

Awesome. I used a less cream, more grated cheese, and no EVOO. I liked it this way because without the oil, the sauce got nice and thick.  I used fresh red pepper and also a tomato.  I steamed the pepper rather than roasting it, and didn't puree the veggies.  It was a delicious creamy, chunky sauce over rotini pasta.  I'll make it again and plan on making more to freeze for a busy night.

made this sauce last night.  put it over spaghetti with chicken.  It was fantastic.  It had a very good flavor that the family loved.  It made enough sauce for a second day.  I will love making this again in the near future.

This was so good, although I used this recipe as a base for a thicker sauce. I sauted jarred peppers, onion & garlic in EVOO. Blended, added some parm cheese, butter and just a splash of cream. I served it with crab cakes, along with a Dijon Mustard sauce. Very good. I can't wait to make the whole recipe!

SO good. I did add a couple sundried tomatoes to the pepper mixture before it was blended. I also used a combination of parmesan, asiago, and romano cheeses. Turned out amazing! I served this with cheese tortellini

I served this sauce over a mixture of cheese filled spinach and plain tortellini and it was absolutely delicious. I took some tips from other viewers and used an extra bell pepper and decreased the cream and added a bit of cornstarch.  I liked the extra pepper but didn't need to decrease the cream, especially with the cornstarch.   I served it with a salad (using the Restaurant Style House Salad recipe from this site) and french bread.  My son is still talking about it two days later. I feel like a gourmet chef! I can hardly wait to make it again.

Very flavorful sauce...I only had a jar of roasted peppers and used that, which turned out excellent.  I served this over pan seared pork medallions and potato filled pierogies.  I would make this recipe over again.

I felt it was lacking in something.  Just a very weak flavor.  I had high hopes for this recipe after reading the comments.  I think I will try again with more garlic, red pepper and salt.

This was very good.  I added about 1/4 of a medium sweet onion and some cubed chicken.  I sauteed the chicken first and then used the same pan to make the sauce.  I didn't remove it from the pan to blend, I used a hand blender (my boat motor:)) and it turned out great.  So easy and simple to make.  I also used the fat free 1/2 & 1/2.  Will definately make it again

My roomies and I agree that this is one kick butt recipe!  I added my own twist to it by adding some farm-fresh veggies to it.  I steamed asparagus and stringbeans, and chopped up some fresh tomato and spinach and added it to the sauce before serving.  I also added some extra basil, garlic powder, and roasted red peppers to the sauce, to make it really flavorful!  My choice of pasta was a mixture or Barilla's "Three-Cheese" and "Spinach and Cheese" torellini.  YUMMY!

Okay, but needs a certain something to add that extra finish. Can't figure out what it needs. It did improve a lot with some kosher salt.

Very good sauce. I used this on ravioli-delicious!! I used parmesan and mozzrella cheese as I did not have romano on hand. I also used dried basil and jarred roasted red peppers. Still tasted great. Had enough left over to freeze some. Thanks!

This was great. I cheated and used jarred roasted red peppers as a timesaver. This was very pretty to look at. For some reason, I can also see this as a sauce for crab cakes.

This was very rich & yummy. I had no problems with thickness. I added an onion when cooking the peppers, garlic & basil so that may have helped. I used only half a cup of cream which was plenty. Because the sauce is so rich it really only needs to just coat the pasta.

Found it a wee bit granular from the cheese and/or the pureed red peppers. Maybe next time puree the peppers a little longer or something like that. I used good, fresh romano cheese so Im not sure if maybe it just didn't get melted...
Also ended up sprinkling with fresh parm after serving and that gave it a nice added flavor - I think I might try adding that into the sauce prior to serving in addition to the romano.

I am always looking for a good sauce recipe, and I will be adding this to my collection. I made an extra batch for the freezer, so that I always have some on hand. Thanks!

Delicious!  Although it took lots of time to prepare the sauce, it was definitely worth it.  I used fat free half and half and the only thing I would change for next time is to add more Romano cheese.  Other than that it was great!  I served it with fresh cheese ravioli and grilled chicken breast.

Awesome, awesome, awesome. I used it with pork chops and mashed potatoes and it was incredible! To make a bit thicker, I added 2 tablespoons Wondra flour the second time around.

Very flavorful!  Smells delicious and tastes great!  I've paired it w/ a 4-cheese ravioli.  Loved it!  Definitely making it again.

Excellent recipe.  I added a little proscuitto and red pepper flakes and served it over bowtie pasta.  Delicious!
