I baked these cookies last night for UFC 79 and everyone loved them.

I did not have butter flavored shortening so I used 1/4 c butter and 1/4 c shortening with no adverse effect to the cookies.

I also split the recipe in half before adding the candy-coated milk chocolate pieces.  In half I added raisins and walnuts and in the other half I added the candy-coated milk chocolate pieces and walnuts.

Both cookies were fabulous!  The cookie dough tasted great also!

These were delicious cookies; however, I would love to know why the dough would not hold together very well.  It was VERY crumbly and difficult to drop by spoonfuls.  Otherwise, everyone loved them!

This is a very versatile recipe, and a very good one I might add.  I found out, after starting the dough, that I didn't have enough candies, nor did I have almond flavoring.  I used all vanilla and decided to fill the rest of the cup with the candies with pecans and raisins.  I also didn't have any butter-shortening, so I put in a little butter for flavor and regular shortening.  Boy, these turned out so yummy!!  I will definitely use this recipe again as I know you can add almost any combination of things to the mix and it will come out yummy.  Thanks Ellen, the kids, nephews, grandma and myself couldn't wait to pop them in our mouths after they got out of the oven!
enjoy!

We have tried a lot of M&M cookie recipes, yet this one is about the best we've tasted.  After the holidays, I was eager to try something that had a healthy ingredient like oatmeal in it (after weeks of a very "sugary" season!)  So the next time I made treats, I tried this recipe.  Everyone loved it!

I doubled the recipe as suggested by another reviewer- the dough was way too dry and wouldn't stick together. So I added some peanut butter to get it to stick together. Mmm-mmm. I didn't have almond extract, so I doubled the vanilla. I had to bake them longer,  about 15 minutes. They turned out good, not great, but I would make them again.

Thanks so much for a base that I can make my diabetic hubbie a treat. I make my own Splenda Brown Sugar Blend. I mix 2 parts Splenda with 1 part Dark Brown Sugar. My blend actually was clumpy, so I put in the blender & it made a fine powdered sugar like texture. Used 1/3 cup of that blend, 1/3 cup of more Splenda & 1/3 cup of regular brown sugar. Used Whole Wheat Pastry Flour, less oats because mine are Organic Old Fashioned. Found Dark Choco M&M's after Christmas on clearance, used less that the cup. Hubbie was so happy! I learned on the Splenda site to cook at a lower temp, these were perfect at 350 for 9 minutes. Thanks again!

I am not a great cookie maker.  This cookie recipe just changed that!! These were the best cookies ever!!! 

They kept their shape, did not spread all over the pan and were chewy!!

Thank you for a WONDERFUL recipe. This will be my base recipe for every cookie from now on!

This was a great recipe!! However, the yield is kind of small. I would try doubling it next time. 2 dozen may sound like a lot, but once you start eating these you can't stop!! :)
I made a few changes, because I live abroad and not all of the ingredients are available; I used butter instead of shortening, and because I only have one bag of miniature M&Ms and didn't want to use them all up, I used 1/2 cup M&Ms and 1/2 cup chocolate chip cookies. 
They turned out GREAT!!

These were delicious!!  I added butterscotch chips instead of M&Ms and baked them into bars.  They were moist, gooey, and full of flavor.  5 Stars for a great cookie!

A nice departure from the chocolate chip cookie. I was a little short on oatmeal but added some extra flour to achieve a nice texture, and used m&m mini baking bits. I love almond extract in cookies. Yum!

The batter/mix was very crumbly as another reviewer had mentioned and I used the ingredients exactly as listed. I put in 1 tsp of water but that wasn't much help so I ended up added about 2 tbsp of vegetable oil to make the mixture more "sticky" so it could hold together better. I made about12 giant cookies and pressed them down. Took about 15 mins to bake. Still crumbly even after once cooled. Not a bad thing just seems a little odd. Ended up looking exactly the same as picture #2. Will probably not make again.

Doubled the recipe.  Used 1 bag of m&m baking bits (just shy of 2 c).  Yielded 48 cookies using medium cookie scoop.   Subbed trans-fat free margarine for crisco.  Subbed 1/2 WW flour for 1/2 the white flour.  Used all vanilla (no almond extract).  The cookies are yummy and attractive.

Here's my favorite version after I tweaked it a little:  1/2 cup butter in place of all the butter flavored shortening and 1 t. vanilla; omit almond extract.  As the recipe is written these cookies have a really rich taste--almost "Crisco-ie" (as in they almost have a shortening taste to them). And the almond extract added a new flavor, that's for sure, but I must say--we (as in the entire family) prefer the classic cookie taste (to achieve that follow my alterations above).

Amazing recipe! Instead of 1 cup of all purpose flour, I used 1 cup of whole wheat flour. I also substituted the egg for low sodium egg beaters. My family can't stop eating these!

These cookies are very good- the almond flavoring really makes them special.  Try adding a little milk in the batter as it is quite dry otherwise.

Wowee wow!  I am shocked at how deeeeeeeelicious these cookies tasted.  I exchanged the white sugar for brown sugar, and over greased the pan with butter. And they turned out real crispy( I used M&M's)  You can use smarties, M&M's, or any other candy chocolate pieces.

These cookies are yummy but I accidentally skipped putting the almond extract in until the end because the directions skipped it, I'm sure it should go in with the vanilla. Otherwise, I used softened butter instead of shortening and they turned out great! The four stars are for the miscommunication in the directions.

This was a tasty cookie.  My boys loved the smell that the mix of the almond and vanilla extract gave the cookies.  This was easy to make and so tasty.  As a previous review mentioned, we did half butter/half shortning.  I also doubled it so we could freeze cookie dough balls for a rainy day when we don't want the mess of making cookies from scratch, but still want fresh cookies! :)

The dough was difficult to work with as it wasn't sticking together well and the amount of M&Ms seemed to be too much in comparison to the amount of dough. Also had to make sure the M&Ms were not on the bottom portion of the unbaked cookie or they would burn. The taste was okay, not the typical texture of an oatmeal cookie.

I brought these cookies to a party and everyone loved them! I could only find dark chocolate M&Ms and they were so amazing I won't even try them with milk chocolate. I am also a big fan of almond extract and really enjoyed the flavor. Overall great texture and flavor - make two batches because they disappear very quickly!

very crumbly texture that was hard to work with.  The oatmeal probably needs to be cut down for future recipes.  I think the amount of candies is off too.  I will try this again after making some adjustments.

This is a fantastic recipe! I love that it makes a reasonable amount--just making cookies for me and my husband I usually have to halve recipes and they never turn out as good. I love the almond extract. Thanks so much!!

I added walnuts to the recipe as well as some cinnamon (I didn't measure... maybe a little more than 1/4 tsp?). They were delicious!

Dough was a little crumbly, maybe cause i used more M&M's :), so I threw in a little buttermilk that I had on the side. It was maybe a tablespoon or two. Cookies cooked up perfectly. Everything is wonderful about them. I loved the oatmeal texture. Will make again if I ever have excess M&M's

I love these cookies. Easy and delicious. The almond flavoring really adds to the taste. I used half shortening and half margarine, and they turned out soft and chewy.

Mixture was dry & crumbly, which made for hard & dry cookies.

these are excellent!! not dry or crumbly at all.  soft on the inside and slightly crisp on the outside.  the small amount of almond is just perfect, so don't be tempted to add more.  I made these without the M&M's -- just as an oatmeal cookie -- and they were wonderful.  This would be a great chocolate chip cookie batter.

These taste great.  I thought they would spread out more, they came out kind of like lumps but I enjoyed them very much.

I did not care for this recipe. The cookies were very dry and would not hold their shape (used a small ice cream scoop). The almond extract added an odd flavor.

They were sooo good. Had to double recipe for us 1 batch is never enough. Didn't have almond extract so doubled up on vanilla.
