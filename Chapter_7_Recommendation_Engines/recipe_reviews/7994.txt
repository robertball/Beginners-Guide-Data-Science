Such a great cake! Rave reviews from everybody on this one. Make absolutely sure to use coconut CREAM, not coconut milk. It will be in the alcohol section. It also looks really pretty with some sliced, fresh strawberries on top. Enjoy!

Delicious!! And fellow cooks, don't alter recipes so that they are so, so different than the original poster's and then give them a negative review! If anything, make the original recipe first...THEN tweak it if you must. Only review recipes that have been prepared as directed!

This cake was delicious. I did not have a can of cream of coconut in my pantry, but I did have a can of coconut milk. I combined the coconut milk with the condensed milk in a microwave safe bowl and the mixture was a bit runny, so I added a bit of cornstarch (about 3-4T.)and simmered the 2 ingredients in the microwave for about 4 min.(stirring after 2 min.) to thicken it a bit. It worked out great.

Wow, what a great dessert! I used Devils Food instead of white cake, and added 1/2 tsp. coconut extract to the batter. I also heated up the condensed milk and coconut cream slightly so the sauce would be thinner while pouring over the cake. Poked holes using a wooden spoon handle ... the sauce absorbed right in. The cake came out light and fluffy, not soggy like I thought it would. Fabulous taste ... hubby ate 2 big pieces as soon as I finished sprinkling the coconut! Thanks for the recipe - this will definitely become a family favorite!

I have to admit it. The cake is pretty good. I saw the recipe and thought oh my god this looks disgusting. But I was intrigued that the recipe recieved such high reviews and so many; so I assumed it had a cult following and I was quickly seduced -- finding myself in my local grocery store searching for the  ridiculous ingredients.
I made the cake and yes I have to admit again-- it is delicious and very light.   It is much much better than I would have thought and it does not have that coconut tanning product taste that I find offensive.  In any event, the cake, while perverse in its cult status (you should see how weird it looks in my icebox), is a winner.   I altered the recipe slightly by pouring a snifter of armagnac over the top before icing it.  I also used Betty Crocker yellow cake mix rather than white. GO HOME AND MAKE THIS CAKE NOW AND JOIN THE COCONUT POKE CAKE CULT.

This was so easy, but I did make a few alterations. I added 2 teaspoons of coconut extract to the cake mix for a more home made taste. I also took the advice of others so I only used the cream of coconut without the sweetened condensed milk.( this was plenty moist ) I used cool whip french vanilla and topped with coconut. It was a big hit!! No one would believe that this was so easy and quick to make!! Thanks for this shorter version, it will quickly become one of my favorites!

It really surprised me how much I didn't like this cake.  First, it was way too sweet for my tastes and second, it tasted like preservatives.  I realize that the base is a box cake, but maybe if not everything came out of a can/box/tub it would taste better?  I would imagine that homemade whipped cream would have made a positive difference.

I accidentally bought coconut mike instead of coconut cream and I actually liked it better. It wasn't as heavy as the cream! 
I added a bit of coconut to the cake batter before baking too. Toasting the coconut on top is a nice touch.

Great dessert!  I made this for Christmas, nervous that no one would try it and it was the first to go on the table!  SO moist & sweet...everyone loved this!  Must use the CREAM OF COCONUT (I buy it in the Mexican or Asian section of my food store)  I also mix the coconut into the whipped cream, instead of just sprnkling it on top of the cake.  I make it as a bundt cake the day before, refrigerate overnight and shave chocolate on top before serving...they love it!  I also make it w/ Devil's food cake and it goes over just as well.  An instant family favorite!

This was amazing and this is how I tweaked it. I added a package of  coconut pudding (not instant because there wasn't any) and 1/2 tsp of coconut extract to white cake mix and made according to directions.  Some of the reviews said this cake did not have a strong coconut flavor...well this worked perfectly. I used 8 x 8 square pans. While still hot I poked holes about an inch apart with a straw. Using  the cream of coconut and 1/3 can condensed sweetened milk I SLOWLY poured it all of it over the cakes and let them cool.  I roasted about 1/2 cup pecans, chopped them and drained a small can of  crushed pineapple mixing together. I whipped fresh heavy cream with no sugar (since many of the reviews said the cake was sweet) and used about 1/3 whipped cream folding it into the pineapple and pecans and used that in between the layers. I spread the rest of the whipped cream on the cake and coated w the toasted coconut.  The cake was not too sweet or soggy. It was total perfection and delicious. I cook a lot but I don't bake often and this was off the charts delicious. Reading the other reviews helped immensely. Good luck...very easy, very delectable a real winner!

I've made this for my husband's birthday two years in a row and he loves it! I couldn't find cream of coconut, so I just used coconut milk (coconut milk is not the juice, it's a diluted cream from the pressed flesh of the coconut). I never use cool whip because I think it tastes like chemicals, so I made real whipped cream and I also toasted the coconut. This cake is messy, but it's fantastic!

This is one of my favorite coconut cake recipes.  My only suggestion is that you only put half of the condensed milk mixture on the cake.  All of it is just too much.

Oh my, I made this cake today and all I can say is yummy yummy yummy! I sliced a thin piece after adding the coc and letting it sit for a few hours.  My modifications were as follows: I used a DH yellow cake mix, added a few drops of coconut extract to the batter, omitted the condensed milk and used approx 1/4 can of the cream of coconut.  I plan to make real whipped cream and sprinkle coconut on top of the cake.  I haven't put the whipped cream on the cake yet I wanted to let it sit overnight in the fridge and didn't want to whipped cream to soften!  Thanks for sharing.  Will definitely make this again and again.

I love this cake! It always goes over great at family gatherings. For people who can't find the cream of coconut, IT IS IN THE LIQUOR or mixed drink supply section at the market. It is used for Pinia Colodas. I add crushed pineapple to the top of mine with the cool whip and coconut. Great recipe is all I can say!!!

My coconut loving husband is already asking for another one of these.  I used about 2/3's of a can of coconut "milk" and a whole can of sweetened condensed milk and tossed in 1 cup of coconut into the batter.  This was perfectly sweet enough for us.  As soon as I took it out of the oven I used a chopstick with the largest round end to poke holes for the combined milks.  I used a large spoon and tilted the cake pan in order to assure the milks getting into as many of the poked holes as possible instead of having it run off to soak the edge of the cake.  I'm posting a picture so you can see the holes in the cake.  It was topped with an entire 8 ounce container of lite Cool Whip and sprinkled with toasted coconut.  Since it was done in a 9X13 pan I shared with a neighbor who called and asked for the recipe and was stunned to learn it was a cake mix!  After hubby's first serving, he mumbled something about "not sharing anymore cakes"!! Totally deelish!

I made this for my husband's birthday. He really liked it. It was helpful to read the reviews beforehand because I learned some tips. First, it is true that the cake must be hot or at least still warm when you pour the liquid over the cake. Otherwise it will not sink in quickly enough. I microwaved the mixture first too so it was thinner and easier to pour. I poured a bit too fast, leaving some of the mixture to pool up on the sides of the cake pan instead of sinking into the holes I had created with a straw. The more holes the better. I made this in a 9x13 pan and didn't even consider trying to take the cake out of the pan before or after pouring the liquid - that would be very difficult as the cake probably would have fallen apart from all the moisture. I followed the recipe to the letter (except I only needed half the recommended amount of cool whip) and it IS sweet, but not overly so, in my opinion. I used Betty Crocker moist white cake mix which I cooked a bit too long, so it was a little dry initially - luckily for me, this recipe will result in a moist cake no matter what. The flavor is not overwhelmingly coconut, so I think it's important to start with a good flavorful cake mix since that will be the main flavor. Next time I might make my own base cake and add coconut extract as others have suggested. Overall, this is easy and good and a crowd pleaser.

I changed this up, when I made it.  Boo and hiss all you want, I'm still going to rate it and tell you what I did. :)  I prepared the cake as directed, but I added 1/4 tsp coconut extract.  For the cream of coconut mixture, I used 1/2 cup of cream of coconut and 1/2 cup of milk.  I thought the condensed milk would make it too sweet.  For the "frosting" 1 small tub of whipped topping, 1 3.5 oz instant vanilla pudding and1 cup of milk.  Mix pudding and milk together, then fold in whipped topping. Then topped with coconut.  I brought this to Easter dinner and my inlaws loved it.  It was so moist and not overly sweet.

The key here is to use cream of coconut (NOT COCONUT MILK) and omit the condensed milk. TOO SWEET otherwise. I also used freshly whipped cream that I lightly sweetened and shaved large curls of fresh coconut that I toasted. With these changes, it was perfect.

I love all things coconut and I love tres leches cake so I was excited to come across this recipe thinking it's like combining two of my favorite things and I wasn't disapointed! Now this cake isn't as wet as a tres leches cake and that's fine, it's not supposed to be. I couldn't stomach using a boxed cake or fake whipped topping so I admit I made my own white cake and my own stabilized whipped cream and we all loved it. When I made my cake I cut the amount of vanilla called for in half and replaced the other half with coconut extract. Highly recomend this cake whether you use a boxed mix or make your own cake but I strongly recomend making your own whipped cream either a regular whipped cream or a stabilized whipped cream recipe (there are several good ones here on allrecipes) they'll both taste better than the fake whipped topping, the only difference being the stabilized whipped cream holds up better rather than "melting" or deflating some.

I made this cake over the weekend, and I was quite impressed with how it turned out!  I accidentally bought yellow cake mix instead of white, and it STILL turned out fabulous.  I did make a few modifications.  I drained (very well) a large can of crushed pineapple and reserved the juice.  I substituted the reserved juice for half of the water in the cake mix recipe, which meant I still had a small amount of juice left after that.  After the cake was finished baking I mixed together the remaining juice and the cream of coconut, and I omitted the sweetened condensed milk.  I placed the drained pineapple on top of the cake before spreading on the whipped cream.  Even after omitting the condensed milk, the cake was very moist and sweet but not excessively sweet.  I don't like coconut but I sent the cake to work with my husband, who is a police officer.  He said that everyone went crazy over the cake and it was gone in no time!

Update 12/20/2010 after having made this cake several times:  I've found that it's best to stick to the recipe except for the icing.  To ice the cake and make it hold together a little better, take 1 container of plain white cake icing and gradually fold into it an entire tub of whipped topping, extra creamy if available.  This holds the cake together a little better.  Also, I like to put the coconut on the iced cake, and then pat in a small amount of toasted coconut flakes to improve the appearance.

Okay, first off let me say that I didn't find coconut cream at my local grocery store, so I used a mix of coconut milk and a bit of powdered sugar, then mixed that with the can of sweetened condensed milk. Then I tried the mixture, and i hated it! It tasted like raw eggs...  GROSS! I was about to call the whole thing off, but I said what the heck... I am almost done. So I got the cake out of the oven and poked holes all over and poured the mixture over the cake, let it cool and smothered it cool whip and coconut flakes. I put in the fridge for a little bit to get it nice and cold. After 15 minutes in the fridge, I cut it and let my family try it first. The looks on their faces were priceless! I decided to try it myself, and ended up LOVING THIS CAKE! An amazing recipe after all! One of the best cakes I have ever tried!

Outstanding!  I make a version of this recipe only using 1 can sweetened condensed milk.  Once cool, I spread raspberry preserves on top then frost with cool whip and coconut.  YUM!

OMG!  Soooooooooooooooooooooooo good!  To die for!  I made it just like the recipe says.  It gets better and better the longer it sits in the fridge (a day or two ..... or longer)!   SERVE COLD!  Nice and moist!  Definitely use a straw to poke holes in the cake.  It may seem like the holes are too big at first, but after you pore the liquid over the top and let it sit in the fridge, the holes eventually fill in (you can't even tell they were there).  I also added coconut extract flavoring to the cake mix (because I happened to have it in the cupboard) which made it taste extra coconutty!  LOL!   YUM!!   Yes, it was sweet (like other reviews said) but what do you expect?..... it's a cake.  Delightful with a cup of french roast coffee.    mmmmmmmmmmmmmm  NOTE:  I HIGHLY recommend using cream of coconut.  Yes, it is hard to find, but if you look hard enough, you'll find it.  I found mine at Safeway in the mixed drink/bar items/wine section next to the margarita mix.   :-)

Out of this world!  I followed the recipe and used some tips from other reviewers.  Here's a summary of the tips.  I used cream of coconut, which I found in the liquor store with the drink mixes.  It's really thick, even thicker than the sweetened condensed milk.  I added 1 tsp. coconut extract to the cake batter (boy, did that smell good!). I poked holes in the top of the cake with the handle of a wooden spoon.  I think the holes were too big, so next time I'll try using this big meat serving fork that I have.  It works best to drizzle the milk mixture really slowly in a fine stream, filling up the holes.  I also mixed some of the coconut with the wipped topping.  It came out so moist and beautiful.  And yes, it is sweet - but cakes are supposed to be sweet!  However, if you did want it less sweet, I think it would work fine to use less S.C. milk too.

Easy and big elegant flavor! I’m so happy that I made this for Christmas dessert. I read the reviews that this was too sweet and recommendations to cut the sweetness by only using either the cream of coconut or condensed milk…don’t listen to them. It’s not too sweet, it’s perfect…it’s cake people! I mixed about 2/3 of the bag of coconut flakes with cool whip which was at room temperature and frosted the cake and its layers. This, along with the cream of coconut gave enough of a coconut flavor and didn’t need to add any further coconut flavor to the cake batter. I made this cake twice in less than 1 week. For the first time, 1 basic white cake mix box was enough for two 9 inch round Calphalon cake pans, lined with parchment paper at the bottom. There was enough of the cream of coconut and condensed milk mixture for both cakes. It’s seems like your drenching the cake with too liquid much but as the cake cools it absorbs it all. I let both cake rounds sit in the refrigerator 2 days before frosting and cutting into it. I think cutting into it any earlier it will fall apart. The second time I made this cake I used a bundt pan and it feels like because of  the thickness of the cake it didn’t absorb the liquid all the way through…it was still good though. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this recipe this weekend and nobody was very excited about it......until they tasted it!!  They loved it so much that they made me freeze the leftovers instead of giving it away to any of the guests.  I used real whipped cream instead of whipped topping.  It was wonderful. Thanks for the recipe!

I tried this cake at work, and it was fabulous! The cook said it is even better if it sits overnight in the fridge to soak up all the liquid. I am definately showing this one off at get togethers. Thanks for the recipe.

WOW ... This Cake is one of the best tasting Cakes I have made. I made this for a potluck at work, by the end of the day there was none left and four people asked for the recipe. Even people that don't like Coconut loved this. I followed the directions but added 1 tsp of Coconut Extract and 1 tsp of Rum Extract to the Batter. Since I do not like Cool Whip I frosted with real Whipped Cream.

I have made this cake for years. My recipe calls for it to be made 2 days in advance as it need time to "cure". It's a huge hit in our family. I make this using all 3 flavors of cake mix...white/yellow/chocolate. My family prefers the chocolate!!! Yummy!!

This cake is very rich and most.  It actually tasted better on the third day (?)  I think that the next time I make this cake, I will reduce the coconut cream, I thought it was a little too rich.  I had also added coconut in the cake mix and my husband suggested that I leave it out next time.  I would agree.  I also will not use the white cake mix with the pudding in the mix.  I don't think it was necessary.  It is a delicious cake!!!  Thanks for sharing.

This is a REALLY Moist cake - and so YUMMY :)  Just a little tip, make sure you let the cake refridgerate at least an hour, if not it will fall apart when you try to cut it.  Tastes the same, just doesn't look as pretty.

This cake was exactly what I had hoped it would be-YUMMY! I did change it up a little, but I know it would be fantastic as is. As per some reviews I added 1/2 teaspoon of coconut extract to the cake batter as I was mixing it.  I folded in an 8 oz. can of very well drained crushed pineapple w/ the whipped topping. Also I toasted my coconut slightly for a more intense flavor and to add a little crunch. Then I sprinkled on some finely crushed walnuts and decorated with some marachino cherries. My family really enjoyed this and I know I will be using this recipe often! Thanks for sharing. :)

This cake was absolutely delicious!  I was nervous about using everything out of a can/box/tub, but it turned out great.  Coconut cake is my hubs favorite, so I made it for his birthday and he can't stop raving about it.  Will definitely make again.  Thank you!

Soo good but only if you use canned coconut milk instead of cream of coconut and if you make your home made whip cream using hvy whipping cream, powder sugar, and vanilla extract.

Great flavor, make sure to use parchment paper if you are going to remove the cake from the pan.  I used the "Cool Whipped Frosting" from this site.

Made this for my son's 22nd birthday because he's a fan of coconut. I did not use any sweetened condensed milk, just more of the cream of coconut. I used a frozen whipped topping that I found at the co-op that seemed better for you than Cool Whip and I lightly mixed the flaked coconut into it. It was enjoyed by all, except my husband who is NOT a fan of coconut. :)

Made this recipe exactly as directed and it was a huge huge hit!!  Very moist, rich, and sweet, even three days after being made.  So rich that you won't need large pieces to feel satisfied.  Should be called coconut cream cake, it's so moist and creamy tasting (but not overly so).  Super easy to make.  As mentioned in the recipe, don't let the cake cool before poking the holes and pouring the cream of coconut/condensed milk over it (I didn't notice that distinction until the cake had already cooled, and found it difficult to get the liquid to absorb correctly....despite this, however, it still turned out delicious!!).  Definitely a keeper.

I use yellow cake mix for this recipe and sub. whole milk for the water called for on the cake mix box (I do this with all cake mixes).  I also add in a tsp. of vanilla extract and 1/2 tsp. of butter extract to the batter.  Cake is very moist and delicious - much better made a day or two in advance and chilled until serving time.  Cream of coconut is located beside the alcholoic drink mixes at my supermarket.

This was a good recipe with a few minor changes. Unless you can handle really sweet stuff I recommend forgoing the condensed milk.  The cream of coconut  already has all the sugar needed for this recipe; just warm it slightly in the microwave before adding it to the cake.  Also I suggest topping the cake with toasted coconut and homemade whipped cream with a touch of vanilla instead of using frozen whipped topping.

I've got one heck of a sweet tooth, but even this was to much for me.  If I ever make this again, I will double the cream of coconut and omit the sweetened condensed milk, as I think thats what put this cake over the sweet edge

This was a really good cake, but next time I think I will only add half the coconut cream and milk. The cake was falling apart when I was slicing it because it was too moist. Also I used half the whipped topping and half vanilla frosting. My husband and brothers really enjoyed it, I just wish it was more sturdy.

Overall, a great cake. If you're wondering to use or not use the condensed milk: DO NOT USE IT. It is plenty sweet without & too sweet if you add it. Thanks for the recipe.

SO good. I was a bit worried it would be too sweet but it wasn't.. my 15 year old made this for us and lightly toasted the coconut for the top. She didn't use all the cool whip it called for...about half was enough. This cake will not disappoint the coconut fan!!

This cake is GREAT! I used a can of unsweetened coconut milk instead of cream of coconut because I knew it would be too sweet otherwise. I also used some of the coconut milk in the mix as part of the liquid. It turned out perfect. Not too sweet with a nice velvety texture. Not at all mushy like I was afraid it would be. This is my husband's new favorite cake. Thanks Leslie for the wonderful recipe.

WOW!!... Is all I have to say about this cake.  So extremely simple to make; without it 'tasting' simple.  Not an overwhelming coconut flavor, which is nice, though if you really want a LOT of coconut taste you can add coconut extract as some have said. I actually make this cake in two small cake pans (I keep one for myself and give the other away).  Definitely heat your cream sauce to thin it before pouring over your cake.  Its unimaginably, ~sinfully~ delicious with chocolate sauce, also not bad to put a can of pineapple tid bits in the batter.  It is SOOOOO worth it to try this cake!!

I didn't have coconut cream so I used one can ffsc milk plus one small can of coconut milk.  It was really wonderful although I did have a couple "dry spots" in the cake.  Next time I will use more coconut milk and be more careful poking my holes!  I added coconut extract to the cake mix  and some flake coconut on top of the whipped cream as well for a super coconut flavor.  Everyone enjoyed this - thanks!

WARNING:  This cake will do evil things to your bathroom scales.  It will sabotage any coconut-lover's best efforts at self control.  I had definitely better not make it again for a while!  When you try it, make sure to puts lots and lots of holes in it--with something bigger than a table fork--especially in the center of the cake, and also pour the cream of coconut/milk mixture over it in increments, so that the middle of the cake can absorb some.  I toasted my coconut to put on the top, and didn't use quite 8 ounces.  Next time, I will only sprinkle the coconut on half of the cake.  My husband likes coconut flavor, but hates the texture of it.  Then we can quietly devour it together.

I just realized that I've never reviewed this recipe! I have actually made this several times now and will never make another coconut cake than this one. As other reviewers have said, I am now officially a member of the "coconut poke cake cult"!!! It is so delicious and moist, not overly sweet (as I was afraid of), and sooooo easy!! The fiance said it was better than mom's and I almost keeled over!! :) You can't ask for anything more than that!

I've made this recipe several times and it has turned out great.  In fact, when I've been short on the whipped topping I skipped it and it was still yummy.  Don't be scared about adding so much syrup to the cake; it seems like a lot when you're doing it but the cake soaks it right up like a sponge.  Yes, *some* people will gripe that it's too sweet, but they are the people who only like plain pound cake--like my mother.  For the rest of us cake lovers, it is just perfect.  My aunt went nuts over it and now I have to bring one every time I see her.  Happy Baking.

I made this for Easter '15.  I did not use the sweetened condensed milk because the coconut cream or cream of coconut that I bought was already sweetened.  It was fabulous and only got better the longer it sat in the fridge.  I believe I also added some coconut extract to the cake batter.  I took another reviewer's advice and made my own whipped cream for the top.  It was out-of-this-world!

You can get coconut cream at Trader Joes. The stuff you get in liquor department is full of sugar too. Coconut cream is just very thick natural coconut w/o sugar.

This cake is incredible!!!The first time I made it my wife completely fell in love with it!  I lightly toasted the coconut flakes, which not only added a dimension to the cake but made our kitchen smell delicious as well.  Another key is to let it sit in the fridge...not easy to do when your kitchen smells like a pina colada. Trust me, the longer in the fridge the better.

I thought this would be good as a chocolate-coconut cake, and it absolutely was.  The only thing I did differently was to use a devil's food cake mix and light whipped topping.  I also lightly toasted the coconut.

Scanning the recipe ingredients a few days ago, I couldn't wait to make this! I wasn't expecting the cream of coconut to be so sweet, so I thought about omitting the sweetened condensed milk, but against my better judgement, I mixed it with the cream of coconut and added a tsp of vanilla, just because. I really wanted love this, but it was simply too sweet. I didn't hate it though, and I will make this again with some major tweaks. It wasn't really as coconutty as I expected, so I'd probably use coconut pudding to "poke" into the holes next time. I used Cool Whip, but it only added to the sweetness factor, so next time, I'll make homemade whipped cream and add a few sliced strawberries, as I think they would complement the coconut flavors nicely.

Fantastic cake! Oddly difficult to pull off though given how simple it is - I've made it (1) too runny, (2) oddly shaped. Even when it's a soggy mess it's delicious. When I've gotten it just right it's been pretty *and* delicious.

My husband loves coconut desserts so made this for him for Father's Day and he loved it.  Had a hard time finding the coconut cream (I was looking in the baking section of the store), but our store keeps in the the mixer section for cocktails (I guess you can use it for Pina Coladas?).  Anyway, I would have like a stronger coconut flavor...and maybe some chocolate chips on top would be good for those who like chocolate-coconut.  Next time I might add the chips and some coconut extract.  But hubby loved it and it was easy to make!!

My mom made a cake like this on special occasions with a few changes.  1.  She usually used a French vanilla, but would  sometimes use a pineapple cake 2.  Only mix 3/4 of the cream of coconut with the sweetened condensed milk 3.  Mix remaining cream of coconut with whipped topping

This cake needs more coconut cream or condensed milk to make it moist. I think I would add a can of evaporated milk next time to be more like a tres leches cake.

This recipe has been around many years. I used to make it a lot. It doesn't work well anymore because the size of cake mixes has shrunk from 18 1/4 oz.  To 15 1/4oz.  The last time I made this I couldn't figure out what I did wrong because the cake was so little. I finally figured out the problem. You can't find a mix that has 18 1/4 oz.

I'm not much for coconut, but this cake is good.  I want to let others know, however, that most cake mixes on the market today are no longer 18.25 ounces; they've shaved off anywhere from 2-3 ounces to save themselves some money on production costs, etc., and boost their profits at the same time.  Adjust the recipe accordingly.

I made this for the seniors card group and although it was delicious for me it was far too sweet. I think it is because as I have got older I have lost my tastes for sweet stuff. Anyway as other people said  I only used half of the sweetened milk and definitely used cream of coconut. It came up very very moist so much so that we used spoons instead of forks. Although it was delicious and the ladies enjoyed it I would not make it again. Just one other thing. If you don't like the recipe please don't make nasty comments. Just put why you didn't instead of slagging off the recipe in total. Other people may have loved it.

This was delicious.  The only thing I did different is to use coconut oil instead of vegetable oil.  I never use vegetable oil and the coconut oil gave an additional hint of coconut flavor to the cake.  It was a big hit with my family!  I cut individual slices and topped with fresh whippes cream, sweetened shredded coconut,  and a maraschino cherry!

This is wonderful but I do think there is an error with this recipe.  I think it should be coconut milk with sweetened condensed milk OR cream of coconut.  Coconut milk is found with the Asian food section and is unsweetened.  Cream of coconut is found in liquor stores and used to make Piña Coladas.  It is very sweet on its own!!  I made mine mixing 14oz of sweetened condensed milk and the unsweetened coconut milk!  Perfect!!!  Had quite a bit of milk left over too...can't imagine 16 oz of each.

This cake tastes great and is so easy.  I also could only find coconut milk.  I did as one of the reviewers recommended and mixed in 4 T. of cornstarch with the coconut milk and sweetened condensed milk.  Worked great!  I would highly recommend this recipe as a quick cake that tastes delicious!

I made this cake for our family Christmas Eve party.  Since our theme were appetizers, I made them as cupcakes!!  This was the BEST coconut cake I've had.  The cake was super moist and had the greatest flavor.  One thing I altered was use coconut milk instead of water in the cake mix (the box recipe calls for water).  I've also taken this idea and made german chocolate (cup) cakes (super moist and super yum).  This recipe is simple, versitile and simply delicious!

Now that I made this and screwed it up, I know what to do differently next time. If I attempt to make this a second time. Instructions need to be more clear

I was so excited to make this cake after reading all the rave reviews but was sadly disappointed. I was afraid it'd be too sweet like many others said so I only used 1/4 can of the sweetened condensed milk with the cream of coconut; which was something like $3 for a can at Walmart. The cake was light but my family just found it way too sweet. I actually ended up throwing it away which broke my heart since it looked so pretty with all the coconut. I guess everyone has different tastes. My sweet tooth just isn't as sweet as I thought.

Absolutely great recipe.  I've made this cake three times already and the most recent time I was rushing and accidentally used coconut milk instead of the coconut cream.  It was STILL a hit with party guests and people were asking for the recipe.  A winner!

Delicious.  Followed the instructions as written with one exception - I don't like Cool Whip frosting, so I took another reviewer's suggestion and mixed 1/2 can of whipped white frosting with the cool whip.  That gave it the right amount of sweetness for me.  I used a fork to poke the holes and waited an hour and all the liquid was absorbed.  Used Wilton Cake Release on the pans before baking and the cake popped right out after the hour.

I love how easy this was! I love the Pepperidge Farm coconut cake and wanted to make one similar.  This is it!  I used a white french vanilla cake mix and subbed coconut milk for coconut creme, since that was all I had.  For the frosting, I mixed a half a tub of "Fluffy white frosting" with a tub of whipped topping with some flaked coconut. It was still fluffy, but a little  more substantial than just whipped topping. I topped it with more coconut.  REALLY really good!

This was a great recipe. I was able to lighten up the prepared cake by using egg whites and applesauce without noticing the change. I also  found that 8 oz of whipped topping and about half the reccomended coconut was enough for us.

This one has become a family favorite. I combine the cream of coconut and sweet condensed milk together the night before I make this cake. I make the cake the next morning and let chill until evening. The cake turns out perfect everytime.  It is sweet like a sundae or coconut creme pie.

Very rich and delicious. I made the mistake of using 2 9inch round pans rather than a 9x13. (I like the look of a layered coconut cake but, I was unscuccessul in acheiving a pretty cake) If you like coconut, this is heaven on earth!

LOVE THIS CAKE!  I add 1 tsp. coconut extract to the coconut/condensed milk mixture for more intense coconut flavor.  But still, it's not overwhelming.  And I use only about half the can of the condensed milk rather than the full 14oz.  Husband requests it every birthday and says it tastes better than any coconut cake he's ever had.

If you are a fan of coconut- this cake is for you!!!  SO GOOD!!  I used a standard white cake, but used light coconut milk for the water called for in the directions.  When the cake was just out of the oven, I poked holes in it and drizzled with a can of Cream of Coconut.  I frosted with standard white frosting and dumped a small bag of coconut over the top.  This cake was a big hit at the 4th of July picnic I went to-- there was none left!

I served this for a birthday for a group of women friends and got rave reviews.  I only used 1/2 can condensed milk, like others have suggested, and I would make that a permanent change.  I made the cake two days before the party, and added fresh raspberries as garnish right before serving.  Yummm!

I have not attempted to make many coconut cakes, but my dad LOVES coconut cake, so I decided to try this one for his birthday. I made it as directed, except as I do with many cakes I added 1/2 package of instant pudding mix and about 2 tblsp. of sour cream to the cake batter when mixing.  I made a layered cake using 2 9 inch round pans and added a small amount of the leftover cream of coconut (I had a 21 oz bottle-found in the alcohol section) to the whipped topping before frosting cake on top and used in between layers. Let it sit in fridge overnight and even my mom who doesn't care for coconut cake..loved it! It was very good and oh so moist! Thanks leslie!

I used a chocolate fudge cake mix (it's what I had on hand, plus I like the combo of chocolate & coconut)  I also use the fat end of a chopstick to poke the holes & made the holes about an 1" apart so I had lots of good sized holes to pour the coconut/Sweetened condensed milk combo into, so I didn't find that there was "too much" liquid like many reviewers found. You just want to pour very slowly and allow the mixture to settle into the holes. I topped with light cool whip (I don't care for the "greasy" taste that the full fat cool whip leaves me with) & toasted coconut. For me personally, maybe using a chocolate cake mix was a mistake, since I didn't really pick up the flavor of the coconut cream, but I am giving the 4 stars because it got lots of raves from people at the party, and it does make a VERY moist cake without it being mushy - I left the leftovers with the hosts and they made a point to tell me last night how AWESOME that cake was.

This was excellent!  I made it a day ahead, used whole eggs instead of egg whites as the cake box called for.  I think letting it sit allowed for the cake to soak up all the liquid.

VERY TASTY!  I give it only 4 stars though because I would've had to adjust ingredients to make it *perfect.
I started out with making my White cake from scratch...because Scratch is better (imo) :)  I used the "cake mixes from scratch and variations" recipe off this site following the suggestions from the review from April 5, 2008.
I found "cream of coconut"  instead of coconut milk which is what the recipe calls for, but cream of coconut is incredibly thick esp. mixed with S/C milk.  (Cream of coconut was easily found in the "mixed drink" section of our local walmart)
I would've used coconut milk in my cake mix as the liquid to give it more coconut flavor, and added a little to the cream of coconut/sweetened milk mixture to thin it out a bit, so it more easily soaks into the cake.   But even without these adjustments the cake is WONDERFUL!  Thank you!

Edited to say that I only used about 1/8 of the can of Sweetened condensed milk.  It would've been waaaaaaaay to sweet adding the whole thing.

This cake was a bit sweet for my taste, but it was also delicious.  Since I had yellow cake mix on hand, I didn't think it would make a difference if I used that instead of white cake mix.  Would I make it again? Absolutely!  Just serve it in small portions.

Coconut cake is one of my favorites. Love simple but with much flavor. I used only half of a can of coconut cream and half of sweetened milk. For those of you that think it may be a little too sweet , try this. I promise the flavor and moisture will not be a loss. I do this with a lot of poke cakes . I freeze my left over milks for my next poke cake. I thaw by removing from the freezer to frig  a day before my next bake...Thank Allrecipes for an awesome recipe ;)))

This is my favorite coconut cake; I have been making it for years. I made it gluten free by using a gluten free cake mix instead but no one could tell the difference.

My family and I loved this recipe but I made the cake twice - I had to toss the first attempt.  I did the first cake (white cake)in a bundt pan (bad idea!) and let it cool on a wire rack to the point I could turn it out on a plate.  It just wouldn't soak up the liquid very well.  Second cake was in a 9x13 Pyrex and it stayed in the Pyrex.  I drilled the cake with lots and lots of holes and poured on probably 2/3rds of the liquid.  I stopped when it seemed like the cake was well-saturated.  Later, when I iced it with the frozen topping I topped it with fresh strawberries and toasted coconut.  Success!!!

I made this for my husband for Valentine's day. It is much better the second day. I thought it was too sweet the first day. I also added crushed pineapple to the top after the milks had soaked in. I added coconut to the whipped cream as well as on top. I used the juice from the pineapple and milk in place of the water for the cake mix.

Next time will use 1/2 the sweetened condensed milk, will make my own whip cream and will omit the flaked coconut. I toasted the coconut but it got soggyish after adding it to the cake. Didn't care for the consistency. Overall the taste of the cake was great.

I'm not too fond of coconut but I'm glad I gave this recipe a try. I used the amount of cream of coconut and sweetened condensed milk that the recipe called for. I almost cut back on it and I'm glad I didn't. I loved how moist the cake was without being soggy. It was perfect. I didn't think it was overly sweet as some commented. The only thing I did differently was made my own whipped cream from off this site and stirred in the coconut flakes. It was delicious!

My husband said this cake was in the top 3 best cakes he ever ate! Found the cream of coconut in the liquor aisle by the Pina Colada. Thanks for the hint. I used 1/2 a can of sweetened condensed milk and it was perfect. Also used the coconut extract. Used a straw to make bigger holes and I felt that more cream went in. Pour it slow. It really is an easy cake to make.

This was so easy and good.  I made it into an Almond Joy Cake, by adding some Almond extract to a Devils Food Cake; and to the frosting, which I used Pastry Pride.  I grated some chocolate for the top and added slivered almonds.  Everyone really loved it!

The recipe as is gets four stars.  To turn this cake
into a 5 star cake I added 1 teaspoon of coconut
flavoring in the batter and threw in a couple
handfuls of coconut. Poke holes in cake using
a wooden spoon handle.  Otherwise, the holes
are not big enough.  I used 1 can of coco lopez
cream of coconut (make sure you stir thoroughly
before using as there is always oil in the bottom
of the can) and mixed with 1/2 can of sweetened
condensed milk. Poured on top.  

I used the whipped cream mousse frosting and
instead of adding vanilla to the pudding I used
1 teaspoon coconut flavoring and then topped
with flaked coconut.  Very good!!

Everyone loved this. The only changes I made were making my own whipped cream for the topping, and I lightly toasted the coconut in the oven before adding it on top of the whipped cream. As other reviewers have said, make sure you use coconut cream not coconut milk. Coconut cream is found in the alcohol section with the drink mixes. Yummo!

10 STARS!  My husband wanted a moist delicious coconut cake for his birthday....well, this is it!  I used a butter cake mix and instead of the cup of water added coconut cream and rum flavoring.  I like so many others was worried about the sweetened condensed milk and the cream of coconut....(the bottle I got was with the wines and had 21 ounces. so I used the 7 extra ounces instead of the water in the mix.) I poked the holes and poured all of the mixture over the cake...let it sit on the counter for a couple of hours and it soaked up every bit of it.  I used a can of "whipped cream" icing and lots of fresh coconut which I sort of pressed into the icing.  DELICIOUS!!!  My husband just said I could stop making all other cakes and just make this one for every occasion.  It is moist and just right....hard to believe but it's NOT too sweet!  Perfect!!!  Will be making this cake for the rest of my life.

I've made this two ways, with and without the sweetened condensed milk. Just the coconut cream is perfect. The sweetened condensed milk is not necessary at all(a bit too sweet)! I added coconut extract to the cake and the whipped cream (real not cool-whip). Very easy and a winner!

Excellent recipe! I bake a lot and never received so many compliments. After reading reviews I made the cake with half the called for cream of coconut and sweetened condensed milk. I also made my own whipped cream. The cake was perfect.

Really delicious! I used about half of recommended condensed milk, cream of coconut, and whipped topping and it turned out wonderful! Plus, I baked the cake with coconut oil instead of vegetable oil to add a hint of coconut to the white cake. Yum!

I followed the recipe and it produced a super sweet, melt-in-your-mouth dessert. If you like tres leche cake, this is very similar, but not as watery. But it is moist, light, airy and just delightful. I brought it to a birthday party and everyone devoured it. Thanks to the reviewer who said to find Cream of Coconut in the alcoholic beverage aisle.

I love this cake because not only is it delicious, but you can prepare it ahead of time and freeze until needed.  It is great to make ahead and have ready to take to barbeque's or family cookouts.

This cake is so good.  It is very sweet and gooey, and I like it that way.  I started making it about 5 years ago when I found this exact recipe on a website that had church potluck desserts.  It does very well when I take it to pitch-ins.

This cake was wonderful...moist and not too sweet.  I used a 9 X 13 pan because I was afraid a layer cake would fall apart with all the liquid I was putting into it.  I don't think that would have happened, though, as the pieces held together well when served.  I plan to try a layer cake next time.  Also, I used "lite coconut milk" which I found at my local supermarket.

The idea of the cake is great! But the instructions are lacking :S The cake itself was missing the "coconutiness", what I would suggest is using a baking syringe or even a turkey baster to INJECT the coconut/condensed sauce into the cake. I would also suggest making real whipped topping, and adding a  bit of coconut extract to the cake before it is baked.

This was a really good recipe - but a little on the sweet side - You must use the Cream Coconut but I would suggest using regular evaporated milk instead of the sweetened condensed milk. I also added a small can of pineapple bits.  I used the pineapple juice in the cake mix as part of the water measurement and then chopped the pineapple into small pieces which I sprinkled on top of the cake batter before baking.
I also toasted the coconut.  the kids loved it!

I made this for mother's day and it was a huge hit with my extended family.  I made my own whipped cream and I toasted the coconut to make it a little prettier, but changed nothing else.  It was a beautiful cake.   I will say though that I did have a hard time taking it out of the pans after it had been soaking in the coconut cream mixture, but as the whipped cream covered the small blemishes it was okay.

This cake is an absolute winner!  I was a little unsure, but made it just as the recipe is written and it turned out to be one of the best tasting cakes I've ever made!  I splurged and bought the cream of coconut and I'm glad I did!  I poured the condensed milk and cream of coconut mixure over the cake and let it sit for serveral hours and when I was ready to serve, topped it with the cool-whip and coconut.  The cool-whip is the perfect compliment to the moist cake.  This cake will absolutely become one of regulars!  My family loved it!!

This cake was SO easy to make (I don't bake very often, so that's important to me), and it came out wonderfully.

I used the recipe as written, and everyone that ate it raved about it, and it was gone very fast.

 Next time, however, I think I will mix in a little coconut extract to the condensed milk and cream of coconut, since I like a lot of flavor (to me, the main coconut flavor came from the actual coconut on top).

Quick and easy to make (frosting with whipped cream is cinch !), as well as delicious, this one is a sweet, sweet keeper !

Made for my husband's birthday.  Followed exactly as stated (although didn't need the whole bag of coconut flakes).  I was nervous about pouring all of the liquid into the cake, but it turned out perfect.  The kids helped poke holes and the cake looked pitiful until frosted.  None of that mattered, it was moist and delicious.  Better the second day.

I followed the recipe for the cake exactly and then followed the advise of others. I made the cake the day before I wanted to serve it, covered it and put in the fridge.  The next day shortly before I wanted to serve it I made fresh whipped cream to ice the cake and topped with the coconut. It was a hit. Very moist. Mine didn't fall apart like other reviewer's did. It cut very well and looked very pretty.

I had this at my daughters and it was wonderful. so I made it for visiting family, they loved it and asked for the recipe. I used less fat coconut cream and low fat condensed milk. If you like coconut this is the cake for you..Thanks for sharing.

I never make box cake, but a friend suggested this one and I make it every time I make coconut cake. I use coconut milk, fresh whipped cream, and unsweetened coconut in place of the cream of coconut, whipped topping and sweetened coconut. Cutting down on the sugar products for the topping and making fresh whipped cream makes this delightful dessert taste like it is all from scratch!

Really good, insanely rich.  A little goes a LONG way.  Loses a tiny bit for falling apart easily, but that's really only an issue if you are serving for company who cares about that sort of thing.  I definitely agree with the other reviewer who said to heat up the condensed milk & creamed coconut before pouring - that made the liquid smooth instead of chunky.  The liquid doesn't really fill the holes if you make big holes (with a serving spoon) rather than smallish holes - but this probably contributed to the falling apart easily thing.

great, quick & easy recipes, was definitely a big hit, however I did make a few adjustments. I only used half of the condensed milk, I feel the cake would have been waay too sweet if I used the whole can & for the cake itself, I used a regular betty crocker white cake mix. Instead of using all of the water indicated in the directions, I used half water & half Bacardi Coconut Rum which gave the cake an authentic, almost home-made flavor. I topped it off with fresh whipped cream, in which I added a cup of coconut milk & toasted coconut flakes & it was a hit! One of my favorite cakes to make!

I fixed this for my Mother-in-law's birthday as coconut cake is her favorite. She said it was truly the best she'd ever had. It was light, moist, and had a good coconut flavor. I'll be serving this one again.

The first time I made this according to directions and it is a very good cake but the sweetened condensed milk makes the cake a little dense for me so I tried again. The second time I used a coconut supreme cake mix and mixed coconut flakes into the batter. While it was still hot I poured the cream of coconut over the cake. Once cooled I top with extra creamy cool whip and toasted coconut flakes, delish!

This cake is amazing and a perfect summertime dessert! I mix up a pkg of instant coconut cream pudding and mix that with the cool whip for frosting, then top it all off with chopped strawberries. BIG hit!!

Well, first off,  everyone loves this cake, but I make mine a little different. I mix the cake mix as directed except I use milk in place of the water & I mix in one cup coconut into the batter. Bake as directed on cake mix box. Allow to cool then poke holes in the cake with handle of wooden spoon. Pour your cream of coconut over the cake. Ice with Cool Whip, Then sprinkle coconut over the the Cool Whip.  Delicious cake.   PS I don't use sweetened condensed milk.

I have made this cake three times now and it is delicious and easy.  My family asks me to make it often.  Only changes I make are to always toast the coconut and I add about a teaspoon coconut extract to the batter.

I made this cake with coconut milk because that's what I had on hand. I took others advice and didn't use the condensed milk so as to make it a bit less sweet because I wanted to frost it with a chocolate frosting.  It was ok--not bad at all, but not as good as I was expecting after all the reviews. And it definitely didn't have much of a coconut flavor.  Also, I baked the cake in two round pans and poured the coconut milk over them while they were still in the pan--i don't recommend this. It was impossible to get the cake out of the pan to stack and frost nicely.

I am rating this recipe exactly as it is written.  It is way too sweet.  I won't make it again, but I woud suggest to anyone who does try it to cut back on the sweetened cond. milk.  Or just make half the milk/coconut cream mixture for the cake.  Real whipped cream would make it better too, but the real problem is the overly sweet cake.

I AGREE WITH ALL POSITIVE COMMENTS!!!  I DID USE MY OWN REAL WHIPPED CREAM - 2 HALF PINTS OF HEAVY CREAM/1/8 CUP POWDERED SUGAR INSTEAD OF WHIPPED TOPPING AND FOLLOWED THE SUGGESTION TO MAKE A DAY AHEAD TO ALLOW FLAVORS TO MELD.  A REAL WINNER......EVERYONE TOOK PLATES HOME!

This cake is AWESOME!  I followed the recipe exactly and it was loved by the entire family at last nights dinner. Next time though I might try to use only 1/2 the condensed milk to cut some calories, but it wasn't super sweet at all using the entire can. Definitely make lots of pokes and pour the liquid slowly to let it absorb it in the center of the cake and elsewhere.  I plan on making this for my coworkers this week as a treat, but I'm hesitant to share the recipe and let them think that its harder than it really is.

I made this with coconut milk instead of the cream of coconut. I was worried it was going to be too runny so I added some flour and cooked the coconut milk/sweetened condensed milk in the microwave for four minutes. It made the mixture too thick. I will follow the directions verbatim next time. My family loved it. I will be making it again. The only think I didn't like was it was not very coconuty flavored. Two thumbs up!

This really was awesome! I followed the recipe except I put red food coloring in half and did a swirl pattern in the cake. I also put chocolate covered strawberries on top of each slice. This was definitely a keeper. Even the hubby raved! Not an overbearing coconut flavor either. I'd imagine that people who don't care for coconut would like this!

Wow, this is one delicious cake.  I served it to 6 dinner guests last night and every single person  said this was a winner.  The cake does get super moist when all the liquid soaks in.  It becomes almost like a pudding cake.  Even if you aren't a huge fan of coconut, you will love this cake.  Thanks for a great recipe, Leslie.

This cake was so yummy! I couldn't find cream of coconut at the local grocery store so I used a can of light coconut milk and it was great. I toasted the coconut and it was delicious! Everyone loved it, even people who said they don't typically like coconut!

Wow Leslie, you're one popular lady in this house tonight! What a terrific cake! As others have already said, make sure you don't use coconut milk but cream of coconut as the recipe states, such as Coco Lopez. Yum, yum and what do you think about adding crushed pineapple to the cake batter? That might be a nice addition too! Thank you so much Leslie we all loved this!!

This is the most amazing cake ever!  Better than any scratch, box or bakery cake.  Really.  I did toast the coconut (because I wanted toasted coconut for something else) but that wouldn't be necessary at all.  I'll definitely make this again for home or potlucks -- it is delicious!

A little too sweet, but with some modifications, could be a really great cake. Will try again with a little less sweetened condensed milk and maybe using my own cake mix (so I can add less sugar). Great texture, though, and I would definitely recommend taking the time to make fresh whipped cream. It's worth the effort.

Eww....Really?  I did the recipe exactly as directed.  I really wish I would have left out the sweetened condensed milk and only used Coconut Cream.  WAY too sweet- and I LIKE SWEET!  Almost inedible.  I may try this again as I love easy recipes but will DEFINATELY leave out the sweetened condensed milk- it sure doesn't need it!  ICK!

I asked my mom what her favorite cake was because I try to make everyone a special cake for their birthday.  She said, "Coconut."  This is the cake I chose to make and I am so glad I did.  It was a total hit.  My family couldn't sop eating it.  I was very reminiscent of a Tres Leche cake, as far as texture and moistness.  I added flakes to the batter and halfed the condensed milk, as someone suggested in the reviews.  Although I am not a big fan of cocnut, everyone in my family is, so I am sure I'll be making this cake again!

This cake is fantastic. I love coconut milk, so I really wanted to make this recipe. Just make sure you poke big enough hole for the liquid after is comes out of the oven. I just used a fork and that was not enough. I was onlu able to pour about 3/4 of the liquid mixture onto my cake before it stopped absorbing it. I made a 12" round cake. This is very elegant tasting!

Love it, love it, love it. I made a from scratch white cake. The more holes you poke the better! I used a big utility fork and wiggled it around in each hole to make sure the "sauce" actually gets through. My family is already asking me to make it again!

Excellent cake!  I could not find the coconut cream, so I used 1/3 can coconut milk.  I also used about 1/2 of the sweetend condensed milk and coconut milk mixture.  The flavor was deliciously intense.  I could really taste the coconut, and the whip topping seemed to balance out the cake and kept it from tasting too sweet.  I will definitely make this cake again!

Tasty just right for my sugar tooth friend who adores coconut. THough I took the advice to use a spoon handle and that was really bad advice, it left my cake full of huge holes. Next time I will just stick with the recipe and use a large pronged fork. I also made some cupcakes, and they turned out nice too!

I made the cake and added 2 whole eggs and one egg white. I poked holes with a wooden spoon and slowly poured the coconut cream down each hole and then slowly over the whole cake.I omitted the sweetened condensed milk because I could tell it would be too sweet for my tastes. I refrigerated it, and then the next morning I took it to work along with Cool Whip,coconut,crushed pineapple,cherries. Everyone seemed to like being able to choose individual toppings. It was definitely a hit, and it was soooo easy to bake. I will definitely make again. I may try a pineapple cake mix next time.

I have made this as a sheet cake for my husband's b'day it was gobbled up by the family very quickly.  You will never have leftovers with this cake. I also used this recipe to make cupcakes over the holidays (snowmen cupcakes) and our guest raved about them all week long.

This is a Yummy cake!  I've made it several times and it is always a hit!  I now use coconut milk instead of cream of coconut, it cuts the sweetness.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

I made this earlier today for my father-in-law, who loves coconut cake. He loved it. He said that the only thing he would change is the type of cake mix used, he said it was really great but would be even better with yellow cake mix. Also, I would mix the coconut with the whip cream before spreading on the cake. I didn't like the idea of just spreading the coconut on top. Everyone should try this recipe. It is good and pretty easy to make. Thanks for a great recipe =)

I made this for Easter and all I can say is WOW!!!  Easy and delicious.  I accidentally bought coconut milk instead of coconut cream and it still turned out fantastic.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

I made this for my son's birthday and it was enjoyed by everyone.  They all wanted the recipe.  I didn't use the sweetened condensed milk because I didn't have and it turned out great.  I didn't use the cool whip or flakes, but did top with sf/ff vanilla pudding and we all loved it.  Next time I think I will buy two cans of the cream of coconut and replace some of the liquid in the cake batter with it instead and add the remainder on the cake. I also may try spreading caramel pecan frosting on it.

OMG!! I don't make a habit of doing reviews but this one deserves gushing over.  I use a bundt pan with French Vanilla cake mix and it absorbes almost all of the liquid.  I refrigerate it overnight before icing and serving.  For the icing I use a can of whipped Whipped Cream Icing (Betty Crocker), 8 ounce container of Cool Whip, 1-2 tsp of coconut extract and a ton of coconut flakes (no sprinkling here).  For my friends that are not as fond of coconut, the cake is perfect without any icing - so moist!  As others have stated, the Cream of Coconut is in the drink mixers section.  I will be experimenting with other flavors to 'poke' into my cakes, I'll let you know how it goes!

this is a delicious cake.  Definitely very sweet and very rich as other reviewers have mentioned, but a great summer dessert after a spicy meal.
The only thing I did differently was I used a 'butter recipe golden' cake mix instead of white.  Also, I'm a HUGE fan of freshly whipped cream, but in this case using the frozen whipped topping will last better as you can refrigerate the cake and continue to serve it for a couple of days.  And I recommend the 'extra creamy' variety of whipped topping.

I am surprise that the rating was so high for this recipes. After looking at the other reviews, i cutted back the sweeten condense milk to roughly around 7 ounce, and increased the cream of coconut to 15 ounce (It should be near the bloody mary and pina colada for those who cant find it). Even with the changes, the condense milk to half, and added 2 teaspoons of coconut extract; it didnt help much. The sweeten condense milk was way too overpowering, and cover up the coconut taste. I used the "simple white cake" from the site and even cutted the sugar in half! The condense milk still made it way too sweet! I skipped out on whipped cream also, since it would probably make it even sweeter. The only reason why i gave it a three star is because my family liked it. If you cant get over a heavy saturated texture, then this isnt a good recipes. This was disappointing, i will not make it again.

Very sweet but oh so good.  For all of those who cannot find cream of coconut, look in the beverage isle alongside bloody mary mix, etc.

This was really yummy!  I love poke cakes and coconut..so this was perfect.  Poke cakes are supposed to be somewhat soggy/moist, so if your not keen on those kind of cakes, this might not be for you.  This cake had a very pleasant texture with the extra liquid poured over.  I enjoyed this very much and thanks for posting.

This cake was fabulous - I have been asked to make it many times - in fact, I will be making this for our company Thanksgiving feast next week.  The only thing different I did was to use a homemade chocolate sauce, with added coconut, as the frosting - tasted like a Mounds bar!  Thanks for sharing!

This cake is the bomb! I made the mistake of frosting the cake before it was all the way cool and the cool whip kind of melted. I also didn't use all the syrup because it seemed like so much. But I think next time I will use it all as it didn't soke down all the way into the cake in some places, and the places it did were my favorite. YUM! This recipe is a keeper.

Very easy to make.  Also very tasty.  If you need to whip a good desert up that isn't time/energy consuming, this is it.  However, you can't keep this cake.  It becomes VERY soggy due to the coconut syrup (I only used about 1/4 of the syrup).

One of my favorite go-to desserts! Moist, fluffy,  and delicious. Didn't realize I was out of condensed milk, but I chose not to sub it with anything, still turned out incredible!  Always a hit!!!

Can't say enough about this cake it's so easy and moist.  I've made this cake many times since I found this recipe. I couldn't find cream of coconut so I used unsweetened coconut milk it works just fine. Everyone that ate this cake LOVED it. My go to recipe when I want to impress.

Wonderful!  Everyone loved it.  I like that it is a simple, easy recipe with big results.  The only change I made was to use homemade whipping cream rather than the store bought frozen stuff.  Taking into consideration the other reviewers comments of excessive sweetness, I made my whipping cream light on the sweetness to balance the cake. This recipe is going in the permanent file!

Delicious & light coconut cake.  I did however add 1 tsp coconut extract to cake & substituted coconut milk mixed with about 1/2 cup powdered sugar since my local grocery was out of cream on coconut.   I also toasted the coconut & only used about 2/3 of an 8 oz bag.  It turned out just right for my taste...not too sweet

I hate to be in the minority here with all these positive reviews, but I made this cake today and found it to be sadly kind of gross.   I have a sweet tooth, but this was sickeningly sweet and also full of very “processed” flavors.   Box mix with 2 cans of processed sweets and then topped off with Cool Whip.   What was I thinking?   The only thing missing was sliced Twinkies on top.     It also didn’t stand out as a coconut flavored cake since the sweetened condensed milk was very prominent.  To me it tasted like an overly sweet dessert that you might love as a kid, but later as an adult you can’t believe you ever ate it.    (Ex:  Cotton Candy).  Sorry....   To each his own, but no one in our house could get this one down.   We tossed it.

I made this cake for my adult daughter's birthday because she loves coconut, and it was a big hit with the family. Yes, it is very sweet, but instead of using Cool Whip, I whipped real cream and used half the powered sugar in the whipped cream than usual. That worked perfectly. We served it with a scoop of high quality vanilla ice cream, which also seemed to tamper down the sweetness. I almost made a white cake from scratch, but there is really no need to do so. The cake is going to be taken over by the condensed milk and cream of coconut, so there really is no reason to bake a cake from scratch. This recipe is a keeper!

I have made this one time before and am going back to write down the ingredients of the recipe to make again - for Mother's Day this time.

I do have a question because the recipe doesn't say and I can't remember how I made it the first time - - what size pan do you bake the cake in?  Assuming a 13" x 9" pan but if anyone could respond that would be great!
Thanks!

i made this cake exactly according to the recipe.
i used the coconut cream, not the milk.
the cake turned out totally mushy!
we ended up throwing it out because nobody really likes a 
soggy cake! 
i just wondered why it had so many great reviews.

Very moist and flavorful, easy cake to make. Could not find coconut cream at my store, so I simmered about 3 cups of sweetened coconut in a cup or so of water for about 30 minutes. Then I strained it into a measuring cup and the cream separated from the remaining water. It worked fine even thought I didn't have quite as much as I needed.

I have made this cake 5 times in varying ways (cream of coconut, coconut milk or mixing the 2) and the best way to my taste is mixing the cream of coconut and the coconut milk together (making 14 oz). It seems to cut the sweetness a little but still give it a rich flavor.  I added blueberries and strawberries to the topping each time - Rave reviews no matter how I made it! Love this recipe!

This cake is amazing. It took us about 3 days to eat it all and it got better everyday!  I used real whipped cream instead of cool whip, but otherwise I followed the recipe. I may add some coconut extract to the cake batter next time just to get a more intense coconut flavor. This cake is now one of my favorites. AND, it's so easy!

Great recipe! I did make a couple of changes after reading many of the reviews...and was very happy with the results. I used a wooden skewer to make the holes, being careful not to go to all the way down to the pan. Also, I ONLY used the cream of coconut (recipe calls for condensed milk as well) and found that was sweet enough for us. Making the cake at least 24 hours in advance and refrigerating certainly helps enhance the flavor. Before serving, I used less than an 8 oz. container of whipped topping to cover the cake, sprinkled (toasted...yum!) coconut on top and chopped chocolate covered almonds. Tasted like an "almond joy"! The Birthday boy was ecstatic!!!

You can divide the coconut cream  and condensed milk into 2 bowls. Use food coloring for any holiday in each bowl. For example, for Easter do one bowl pastel blue and one bowl pastel pink. Pour each color over cake, so each half of cake is a different color. Make the whipped cream pastel yellow and the coconut flakes green. There you go, a lovely Easter dessert. Yum!!!

First of all, I hate white cake!  I like the idea of this cake, so I made these changes:  I used a chocolate fudge cake mix and chocolate sweetened condensed milk, then followed the recipe.  It gets rave reviews and is compared to a Mounds candy bar.

I've been making this cake for over 20 years and got the recipe from my sister. Having lived in the Philippines, we named it "Pinoy sa Langit"--"Filipino in Heaven." I too use only half the sweetened condensed milk called for; whip my own cream without sugar; and I use unsweetened "dessicated" (ie, finely shredded) coconut, available at Asian groceries. Be careful of buying coconut milk or -cream at liquor stores, as many of these contain added sugar or corn syrup--best and cheapest at Asian groceries. I use either white or yellow cake --I think yellow is a bit less sweet, but that's just my tastebuds.

For a better coconut taste, try using the frozen coconut from Bird's Eye instead of flaked coconut.  It's just like being scraped out of the coconut shell...not sweet like the flaked.  I've been making this cake since the '70's with the cream of coconut and sweetened condensed milk as the recipe is written.  Always a winner wherever I take it!

Great recipe and the whole family LOVED it. I added 1/2 tsp coconut extract to the coconut cream/condensed milk combo. I also eliminated the whipped topping (yeesh...) and instead whipped together 1 C heavy cream with 1/2 C mascarpone and 1/2 tsp coconut extract. Finally, I toasted the coconut, which is a must. Small changes but great flavor!

This is ridiculous! There should never be something so easy to make that is so delicious that you eat it in 1 day, then you realize that you have extra coconut flakes so you have an excuse to make it again and cover up your accidental over-indulgence.  The pokey pokey hole trick makes it moist and coconaughty.

I have been making this cake for what seems like forever, only I much prefer using a yellow cake mix, much more flavorful. I toast the coconut before putting it over the top of the cake. Always a hit!

i love this cake!! i have also made it as a layer cake, but its pretty tricky with those heavy and deliciously saturated layers. if you make it into a layer cake refrigerate it overnight before removing from the pans so the cake has time to firm up. be prepared for a delicate assembly.
i don't care for cool whip so i always use frosting. cream of coconut can be hard to find. my store (HyVee) carries it in the mixed drink and cocktail section in a squeeze bottle, not a can. i have seen it canned, but not every store carries it.

This recipe was delicious!  I used the entire can of coconut milk/sweetened condensed milk combination.  1/2 would be sufficient.  Kept well in the refrigerator.

I know people don't say this anymore, but......this cake is the BOMB! Ha!  Made exactly as written. My cake mix was only a little over 16 oz - so I added a few T of flour to get it closer to the ounces specified.  Added the coconut to the cool whip before frosting and added some toasted coconut to the top.  Garnished with cherries with the stems on.  Very cute & so delicious!!!   I got two requests for the recipe and was almost embarassed to give it because it's just so easy.  Thanks for sharing!!!

There is no need to heat up the cream and milk if you put it on a hot cake, it will melt right in.

Delicious and easy to make.

This was my first attempt and it was great. I altered the recipe a bit; I omitted the condensed milk (as somebody suggested) and added about 1/2 cup of shredded coconut into the batter, as well as some vanilla extract. I made the cake the day before, added the coconut cream and kept it in the fridge overnight. Frosted it the next day. Perfect!

I made a home made cake with King Arthur unbleached cake flour which calls for almond ext. Then followed the recipe. I used 2 cups real heavy cream and added 1/2 c. Powdered sugar and 1 tsp. vanilla put that on top of cooled cake and sprinkled bagged coconut on top. It is amazing. It's even better the next day.

I am a Coconut Poke Cake Fanatic!
I made this cake, was out of condensed milk so added 2 cans of coconut cream. I used a BBQ fork to poke the holes so they wouldn't be too big, and refrigerated overnight.  I frosted with Cool Whip and topped with shredded coconut. The cake was beautiful, should have gotten a picture but we ate it too fast, LOL.  I wanted to try the cake before I serve it for Thanksgiving, it got rave reviews!

Made this as a three-layer 9"x13" cake with pineapple filling for a going away party. I was a little scared when I saw how much liquid was instructed to soak in it since it was going to be layered. I used 1.5 cans of coconut cream and 1 can of sweetened condensed milk to soak all three layers total. It could have handled more but probably not 3 cans of each, but still tasted delicious. Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. Perfect with pineapple filling (don't be shy with that, as I wish I added more) and homemade whipped cream. I coated the sides with coconut and decorated the top with pineapple slices and a goodbye message.

I am a baker & this is my husband's favorite cake!! Instead of cool whip, I top it with a coconut seven minute icing. To take away some of the sweetness, use unsweetened coconut.

This cake is fabulous!  The only change I made was not using the sweetened condensed milk.  I am not a big fan of super sweet cake and frosting and I found that just using the cream of coconut was perfect.  This is very easily my favorite cake and of course, my family loves it.

Excellent!  I made some adjustments to the recipe.  I deleted the oil from the cake recipe adding an extra large egg (4 large eggs altogether) and added a cup of flaked coconut to the mixture before pouring into the 9X11 pan.  I used a little less of the Cream of Coconut (10oz) and sweetened condensed milk (8oz) heating a little before pouring on the cake using the straw to poke holes as others have suggested.  When cooled in the refrigerator I served individual pieces with Rediwhip (real cream version)out of the can and topped with toasted coconut. Thanks to all the others for their suggestions which I utilized for my version. I do rely on all of your comments!

I made this for my son's birthday yesterday and oh my delicious and moist. It reminded me of the peppridge farms cake you buy in the freezer section at the grocery store; only this is by far superior. I did make my own white cake from scratch as also real whipped cream. Not into the boxed or tubs! I will definitely be making this again. Keeper!

Very easy, very delicious!  Everyone loved it.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated, except did not use quite as much Cool Whip and coconut as was called for.  I used the "creamy" style of Cool Whip.  Be sure to pour the cream of coconut/sweetened condensed milk mixture very slowly over the cake - I used a large spoon to ladle it on slowly, so that it would soak evenly into the holes and not just run to the sides of the pan.

Excellent.  Easy.  Delicious.  Used real whipped cream instead of cool whip. Next time will poke holes using wooden spoon handle.  Thanks Leslie for the great recipe! :)

I love this recipe!  I love these kind of cake recipes because they are so easy and so yummy!  I did a few things differently-I didn't use the sweetened condensed milk because I don't think it needs it.  For the topping I mixed the whipped cream with coconut cream pudding (that I made only using 1 cup of milk instead of 2) and then sprinkled more coconut on top like the recipe says.    Soooo good!  I think the longer it sits the better because the flavors come together!

This cake is incredible! I made it for my mom's birthday and everyone loved it! I was told by two people multiple times it was the best cake they ever had.The cake is moist and the whipped topping goes perfect with the cake. Pouring the mixture of coconut cream and sweetened condensed milk over the cake was a bit challenging, I had to transfer the cake to another plate for that to work out but in the end it was fine. I had a hard time finding coconut cream, I didn't now it was in the liquor section but after researching it online in the store I managed to find a can and it is much thicker than coconut milk, which I wouldn't recommend using in the recipe. I will definitely make this cake again! Enjoy!

I have made this cake quite a few times. I have actually gotten requests for it! Although it sounds sweet, I think because of the condensed milk, it Actually is not. I make it with homemade whipped cream, maybe that could be why. I just don't prefer the taste of cool whip, taste like chemicals to me. Also, make it at least a day in advance.

Very delicious!!! The cream of coconut and sweetened condensed milk was too much, I halved it. Cream of coconut is typically found in the alcohol mixers aisle, FYI. I also added a hand full of coconut into the cake mix, huge difference!

This cake is unbeleivabley delicous. This tops any coconut cake I have ever tried. The only changes I made is that on my 3rd making of this cake, I added coconut extract to the packaged cake mix. (duncan Hines) is everyones favorite with this cake. I tried many store brands and bc and everyone liked the dh better. For those events that the cake will be out of the fridge a bit. Use dream whip with a little less milk in it to hold the frosting form without turning runny. Besides that this cake needs no altering at all.. It's Perfection at its best!

Very, very sweet - which can be could good or bad depending on your taste.  Too sweet for my taste.  

Tip - make a TON of pokes.  I made an average amount of holes and ended up with a cake that had some parts moist cake and some part just cake.  I didn't like the just cake part.  I'm assuming this is trying to be a coconut tres leche cake, so I think the whole cake should be moist, not random bites of regular cake and random parts of moist cake.

Also, used Betty Crocker white cake, tasted too artificial to me.  

Might try this cake with a home-made cake instead. 

I did use real whip cream, don't like Cool Whip.  Also, the Cream of Coconut is in the liquor aisle.

Coconut Cake has been my favorite since I was a child, so I've tried a lot of them. This one is  a keeper! I've used white and yellow cake mix, both work well. Looking forward to trying a chocolate mix. I use a 14oz bag of coconut. I add about 1/2 a cup to the cake batter then bake. I also mix about 1/2 cup to the cool whip and frost the cake, and then top with the remaining coconut. I use a straw to poke the holes in the cake. Please make sure you are using "cream of coconut" and not "coconut milk". Cream of coconut is usually found in the mixed drink section of the store.

My daughter made this for my birthday last week. Wow, so very moist and delicious! This is a new family favorite! The alteration we will make next time is using about half the coconut/condensed milk mixture. We baked ours in a bundt pan, and it was too much liquid and we had to toss some of it. We also made our own coconut cream cheese frosting instead of using frozen whipped topping. Just decadent!

Made this for an office party, everyone loved it. Some even had 2nd and 3rd servings. 
I used a French vanilla cake mix. I used half a can of coconut milk and half can of condensed milk and I added a bit of cornstarch to thicken it. Will definitely make this again!

Sadly, I was not a huge fan.  I pick recipes really really carefully and had already made a Strawberry Poke cake (phenomenal!) but this one was really too sweet.  I like sweet desserts, but I think I would try it next time with a pineapple jello/coconut milk combo, or a coconut pudding/coconut milk mix.  I made exactly as the recipe called for and it's a bit heavy and soggy.  Maybe even a lime jello/coconut milk mixture for the poking, along with the same topping.

Made this cake this afternoon with help from the boyfriend (ok, he got to poke the holes, cuz that was the "fun" part lol). Amazed at how yummy it turned out! I accidentally bought coconut milk instead of cream, but I put a couple of tsps. of cornstarch in it, and I think it was ok. The cake was very moist - almost like a tres leche cake, but the flavor was great! Loved the "frosting"! My boyfriend though it would be even better chilled, though, so I stuck it in the fridge and will try it later :)

So good...I have to make this again.  So this is what I did, got the white cake mix and did the soda version (white cake mix, 12 oz can of Sprite and one egg).  I purchased the cream on coconut and the sweetened condensed milk, but then I read the reviews and just used the cream of coconut (tasted it and it is very sweet, glad I didn't add both lol).  I split the batter in half, made cupcakes with the first half for work and made a round cake for me and the bf...people at work was mad that I only brought 24 and wanted more than one... lol so I take it that was a big hit...bf doesn't like coconut but he ate it anyway and he loved it and wants me to make it again on Sunday. A++++

So wonderfully yummy and moist!  I did NOT add the condensed milk as I found the cream of coconut to be plenty sweet. I made it layered and did not have any issues removing cakes from pans or stacking cakes. Once I poked and added cream of coconut I refrigerated the cakes for one hour before stacking and icing. I used a coconut/pecan icing for the in-between layers, which I think really brought it all together. This is a recipe I will be keeping! Hubby almost ate the entire cake!

My mom always makes this for Christmas and Thanksgiving along with other special occasions.  It is so good and I never thought it was so easy.  The only step I added was to sprinkle a tiny bit of coconut flakes on top of the cake right after it came out the oven before I topped it with the cream of coconut and the sweetened condensed milk.  Very Yummy and moist!  Thanks for the post.

I used a yellow cake mix and added Coconut Extract.  I also mixed Whipped Cream Cheese, powdered sugar and vanilla together and folded in the Cool Whip and flaked coconut for the frosting.  It got rave reviews from my co-workers!

I have made this a million times and it is so yummy! I lightly toast the coconut and spoon it on as I serve it....everyone says that is what makes the cake so incredibly good. Has a little crunch and makes the coconut not overly sweet.

I really love this cake. Coconut cream can be found in the hispanic or alcohol sections of stores. I tried the fork method but most of the liquid was absorbed around the sides. I think i will try something another reviewer did and use an end of a wooden spoon to make bigger holes. I followed the recipe exactly as written and its a 5 star to me and my husband. Next time i am going to add pineapple to the batter and some strawberries on top with the coco.

Great cake.  I let it sit in fridge overnight and served it with buttercream frosting the next day, topped with coconut and some toasted coconut (as I did not expect Cool Whip would take 6 hours to defrost!).  I served the cake cold but it would be much better at room temp.  I will definitely make again.

I do not add the sweetened condensed milk. The cream of coconut is plenty. I also add 2 tsp of coconut extract to the mix. Everyone says this is the best coconut cake they have ever tasted. And it tastes even better if you cook it the day before and leave it in your fridge over night.

My husband has made this cake before, adding crushed pineapple before the whip cream- what a treat! This time he added cherries with the pineapple. I recommend trying these two add-ins:)

This was wonderful, and coming from a chocoholic says a lot! I made my own white cake form the Heavenly White Cake recipe from this site and I made whip cream from a easy recipe from this site too.  Wonderful! BTW I used a crazy straw to poke the holes, big but not too big.

I made this cake for Christmas dinner.  I thought it was perfect.  All other cakes that I have had pale in comparison now.  It is not sophisticated and it is not gourmet but it sure is good.  For the record, my husband thought it was too sweet.  The only thing I changed was to use an 8 ounce container of extra creamy cool whip instead of the 16 ounce container recommended in the recipe.

I made this for my husband for his birthday. He loves desserts, so I always try to make him something different. This cake was just for him. He loved it. He ate the whole cake by himself. Nobody else got a piece. Good think I made something else for the rest of the family! The only thing I didn't have was a white cake mix. I used a yellow cake mix.

This recipe is way too sweet! (and I love sweets!)...but this one has a LOT of sugar. I won't be making this again with the amount of sugar the recipe calls for. I may try it again, but will - definitely - cut the sugar in 1/2, and - perhaps - use coconut milk instead of coconut cream (which is extremely sweet).

I used a yellow cake mix and mixed the coconut into the cake batter. I mixed the cream of coconut and condensed milk together and only poured about 3/4 of the total over the cake. I was worried it would be too much liquid. Everyone loved it and it is definitely better the next day (and the day after that if there's any left)!

This was very good.  The cream of coconut I bought was very runny.  When I combined it with the condensed milk, it looked like too much so I only used half of the liquid.  The cake was still sweet enough for us.  Just an FYI, the cake crumbled a bit also when cut so it wasn't the best presentation

very good, light dessert.  I followed others suggestions and halved the condensed milk as to make it not too sweet. Although the whole can probably wouldnt have been that bad.   I also mixed the coconut in with the whipped topping and spread it on top of the cake.  It was a hit at our house.

This cake is wonderful....for those who are not wanting to use cool whip try adding to the already whipped cream 1 cup chopped up mini marshmallows as they set the whipped cream and it wont go runny for days. Yummm

Akeeper recipe.  Easy to make.  I could not find a can that said "coconut cream" and at Stater Bro's they had not heard of it, so I used coconut milk.  I searched google for answers but found some who said they were different and some said the same.  So, I e mailed the company and I am waiting to hear.  But from the company website, I would say they may be the same.  Regardless the cake is wonderfull with the milk.  Make sure to keep cold and do not leave uncovered too long as the cream hardens over time.

This is so, so good! I served it at Easter lunch, which doubled as a bday party, and it was a hit. I added coconut extract (1 tsp) to the cake batter, and only slightly scaled back on the sweetened condensed milk. Instead of using Cool Whip, I whipped my own cream and added some vanilla and sugar to it. This was such a good coconut cake....thanks!

One of the most delicious coconut cakes you will eat!!  Please...be sure and use the correct ingredient-creme of coconut-is what makes this recipe.  Chill overnight to allow the flavors to develop.  Enjoy!

This was an easy and delicious cake!  Tried it with devil's food mix with 1/2 tspn of coconut extract as suggested by another reviewer, which sort of gives the flavor of a mounds candy bar.

This is unblelievable!!!  I made this for my son's birthday and it was definately a hit.  I made it with the listed Ingredients and it turned out perfect.  Even tasted better the next day.  I would recommend this cake to anyone that loves coconut.  If you are needing an easy recipe that is not complicated and tastes like heaven... this would be the one!  I did add something....I added this to the top of the coconut I used about 1 cup of coconut and toasted in the oven @ 350 for 6-8 minutes.  Letting it cool first.  OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!!

Very Good!  Using packaged cake mix, made this cake very easy to make.  I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil.  I didn't have cream of coconut, so I used coconut milk.  I used about half of the condensed milk, which sweetened it perfectly. Thanks for a new twist on coconut cake!

I did not actually try the cake but made if for someone at my husbands work. Everyone raved about it and asked for the recipe. I used other people's advice and used coconut milk with the condensed milk. I was not able to find the coconut cream at the grocery store. I only was able to use about half of the container of whip cream. Next time I will just buy the smaller container. It is a little strange at first the idea of pouring the coconut mixture over the cake but it all seems to soak in well. I will have to make it again and have some myself next time!

This was so good!  When using the can of Cream of Coconut, it may not be liquid when you open.  Mine looked pretty awful and I thought I had some kind of lard.  Whenit gets cold, it congeals (I live in MN......)  Put the can into a bowl of hot water and keep stirring it, then it can be used.  I did add about 1 tsp. of almond extract to the Cool whip, and I toasted the coconut and added toasted sliced almonds.  So good!

Thank you for a really wonderful recipe. I have made it twice. The first time we had several friends over and they all loved it.  I followed the recipe except for the whipped cream; using less than 8oz.  One thing I did find is that it became sweeter and sweeter as the days passed.  I think it may have been the coconut seeping into the whipped cream so I may try unsweetened coconut next time.

I cooked this delicious cake up this afternoon.  Three of us almost ate the whole thing.  I messed up when poking the cake and made to large of holes.  Other then that it was really good and i only added about 3/4 of the condensed milk recommmended and it turned out fine.

This is by far one of the best cakes on this site.  I love love love coconut so this was perfect. I first tried this about 2 years ago and have made it many times since then. Everyone loves it, and I always get great reviews when I make it. I love the recipe exactly the way it is, wouldn't change a thing.

This cake was a little wierd when I was making it.  After applying the mixture over the hot cake I never thought the cake would soak it up, but it sure did.  Tastes great on a hot day.  Sweet but not heavy.  Loved it! You must make at least a day ahead to get full flavor.

I agree with the reviewers who did not like the cake mix. I might try it again that way but as written, 4 stars. (However, if you don't mind the flavor of boxed cake mix, it'd be a 5 star recipe.)

This was awesome and easy. I did like others suggested and warmed the condensed milk and cream of coconut. Make sure to pour slowly over cake so it has time to soak into the holes. I love coconut flavoring, but I do not like the texture of coconut so I left off the coconut flakes. Was still great. This is definintely a keeper!

My friends and family love this cake.  Make sure to use ALL of the liquid over the cake.  I didnt do that the first time I made it because it does look like alot.  But it magically melts in.  I always make homeade whipped cream too!  It's really good with Chocolate curls ontop.

MMMMmmmmMMMMMmmmm....but after some modifications: I used coconut milk in the cake mix instead of the water, then incorporated the remaining coconut milk (about 1/2 cup) with a can of cream of coconut, added only 2 tablespoons of sweetened condensed milk for the liquid topping. It was a little too thick for the cake to absorb all at once, so I poured it on top in intervals. I briefly heated the mixture in the microwave before adding the last batch because it had hardened a bit. The cake looked a little messy but was covered up with the whipped topping....DEELICIOUS!

Hubbies birthday is TODAY. And this cake was a disaster. Used Devil's food cake mix, pudding in the mix, made according to instructions. Used coco milk, with condensed milk (many others did same also put in in microwave to thin out...) Looked great like it all soaked in. But then cake failed to release from bunt pan. One third completely sogged out. Could be I needed the cream or micro thinned too much. Cake is a slobbery mess. Now to be Bday Triffle!

The amount of the cream was too much and made the cake fall apart because it was still warm. Add the cream after the cake has cooled.

This was simply divine!  I made this for my hubby since he loves coconut and he couldn't stop eating it!  I made this on Halloween. I tinted the milk/coconut mixture a shade of orange and then tinted the coconut that goes on top orange to give it a more festive feel.  I left all the measurements the same and it turned out great!  Big hit in our house!

This is the BEST cake!  However, I only use about half of the concoction you pour over the cake.  It does take a while to soak in.  Once I tried using all of it and it was just too sweet.  Much better just using half.  Yummy recipe.  Thank you!

A really yum and simple recipie. Very simular to the 'tres leche' recepies out there but much easier which I like. I didnt frost mine as I thought that would be to sweet for my liking...but I do feel it needed something to decorate and finish it off.

This cake is wonderful. I did alter it a bit, I added coconut and vanilla extract to the whipped topping for extra flavor. I also added about a fourth of a cup of regular milk to the condensed milk mixture to thin it out a bit. This cake is very sweet, but sooo good.

My cousin has been making this exact recipe for years and we all LOVE it!  The cake is so moist and flavorful. The people that I know that don't like coconut - actually like this cake because the cake itself doesn't have a strong coconut taste and the fresh coconut is just on top of the cool-whip -so anyone who doesn't care for coconut can easily take it off.  If you like coconut though - you will LOVE this cake.

This was a very moist and delicious cake, it did taste like the Tres Leches cake my brother makes, I love the taste of toasted coconut, so I toasted the coconut flakes and sprinkled them on the cake, it was a hit with the family..

Very good cake, everyone liked it. Next time I will use a wooden spoon to poke holes like suggested. I used a big meat fork, and the cake had a hard time absorbing the mixture. Still turned out good!

This cake tasted wonderful!! I didn't use the sweetened condensed milk and it still turned out great. I think it is too much liquid with the milk. There were parts of my cake that were a little soggy without it, but everyone loved the taste of it. Great coconut flavor, but I would just use a bit less liquid next time and add coconut extract to the cake batter.

This cake was pretty easy to make but what a mess it made!!  I also found the taste of the condensed milk to be a bit overwhelming and it made the cake sticky. I made it for Easter and found it to be not impressive enough to serve so I had to run up to the bakery and buy a cake at the last minute. Sorry, but won't be making this cake again.

This was delicious!  I also couldn't find cream of coconut, so I bought a premium brand of coconut milk, and spooned the thick cream off of the top. I also accidentally bought low fat condensed milk, and it was really very good (who'd'have guessed??).  It was so easy to make, and I would easily serve it if having company.  Luckily, we're not expecting any company, so we get to polish off the rest by ourselves!

we didn't know where to get cream of coconut, either, so we used coconut milk and condensed milk. i had to pour it over the cake in batches, letting it sink in, so that it wouldn't overflow. we made our own whipped cream, too. overall this is really good, VERY sweet and coconuty. there was too much milk/milk mixture, making the cake just beyond moist. if i make it again, i'll just use less. there's a lot of room for addition here, too. thanks!

Wow!!!! This cake was amazing.  I didn't think the cake was soggy at all, and I used all of the cream of coconut and sweetened condensed milk.  It was a perfectly moist and tasty cake.  It was even great the next day.  Will DEFINITELY make again and again!!

I made this using pineapple supreme cake mix as suggested from another review and then followed everything else as the recipe directed. It was fabulous!! This will definitely be one of my keepers!
It tastes really good the next day with a big cold glass of milk too!! Thanks for a great comforting cake recipe!

This is an excellant and easy recipe. I substituted coconut supreme cake mix and also pineapple for the white cake and both were outstanding. The pineapple made it kind of a pina colada tasting cake. Everyone loves it!

Could have had just a bit more coconut flavor for me, but everyone LOVED it! No problems at all.  Keeping it refrigerated may have kept it from turning mushy.

My husband made this cake for my birthday.  He made the whipped topping home made instead of already prepared.  It was a perfect coconut cake.  He added the cream and milk and let it soak for a couple of hours and the cake was not soggy.  Totally yummy.

This cake is fabulous for coconut lovers.  I made a bundt and poked holes in the top of it.  Instead of frosting it I poured the coconut mixture into the holes and all over the cake and topped it with  the shredded coconut.  I didn't use the whipped topping because I thought it would be too sweet.  It was great with these modifications.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very Good.  I had my family make this for me, for my birthday.  Simple enough for kids to help with.  We all loved it.  Nice and moist.  Wouldn't change a thing.

This is one of the simplest cakes I have ever made and everyone wants the recipe whenever I serve it.  I use Coco Lopez coconut cream and you can find it in the liquor section of the store or at Gordon Foods Stores.  Julie

this was a good cake.  I would not start with the entire amount of coconut cream/condensed milk as it turned the bottom of my cake to complete mush after it was absorbed.   
I give this cake a 4 rating because it is very good, very rich and flavorful.

Attention coconut lovers!  This is an awesome, moist, easy cake that will satisfy cococut addicts and recruit many a coconut doubter.  i found the cream of coconut in the goya aisle or in the mixed drink section, not in the baking products.  Behold the power of coconut!

Just made it for our church Homecoming fellowship this afternoon, and it was a RAVE.  Many asking for the recipe.  Used the 1 tsp. of coconut extract for added flavor - but would use a little less whipping cream - unless you LOVE whip cream!!

Living in Singapore, we like to do a good tropical BBQ every now & then...this cake was PERFECT for our last grill-up!  Easy to do, and not too much time in the kitchen, which is great, since it is usually 90 degrees f. year-round here!

I made this cake with Lechera brand sweetened condensed milk and added about 1/2 cup flaked coconut to the cake mix. I also added coconut extract to the cake batter and the sauce (about 15 drops). Then I toasted a little of the coconut to put on top. Lastly I used extra creamy cool whip to top it. The cake turned out PERFECT! And I will make it again!!!

Made this super easy cake for my sister's birthday. Made the white cake according to directions on the mix box and baked in 9 x 13 glass dish. I just now reread the ingredients and see that it actually  called for Cream of Coconut and NOT the can of Coconut Milk I used!  I guess ignorance is bliss because the cake could not have turned out any better! Everyone wanted in on the leftovers and husband was like "you need to bring that home!" The only thing I will do differently next time might be to toast the coconut for the top of the cake.

It was too sweet.  Next time i'll use UNsweetened coconut flakes, UNsweetened condensed milk, sugarless  cool whip, and only 1/2 can of "cream of coconut" to one can unsweetened condensed milk.

Made it for an event at my daughter’s school and it was a hit! The only change I made was I added 1/4 tsp of coconut extract to the whipped topping...just for fun. Definitely didn’t make or break the icing though.

My cake was delicious, but the bottom was very mushy.  The top part of the cake was a perfect texture.  The only thing I changed, because I have to, was gluten free cake mix.  I used Pamela’s chocolate gluten free cake mix.

This cake was delicious. Also, used coconut oil in the cake batter.   I didn't have coconut cream but used coconut milk.  I put the milk and condensed milk in a pot with 3 tbls of cornstarch. Stirred until thickened.   I also added 1tsp vanilla.   Then poured over the cake. Added coconut and chopped pecans. Everyone loved it.  So yummy!

Made this as my mother’s birthday cake. It was fantastic! Found coconut cream in Hispanic aisle of grocery store. Highly suggest going the extra mile and making homemade whipped cream instead of frozen whipped topping. Also, toasted unsweetened coconut flakes and made for a nice touch! Simple and elegant dessert!

I had this cake at a party recently and it was unbelievably fabulous! Definitely a keeper! I made it as posted. No need for any revisions and I tend to be a tweaked.  As many said, you must use coconut cream, not milk. It may work with the milk (and I’ve done it both ways, but it is just not as good.

Made it for a family gathering. All of the coconut lovers enjoyed the cake and commented that it was very moist.  If it’s left out too long, it gets a little “soggy” for my liking, but the others weren’t phased. Will make it again!!!

Made it with a white cake mix and skipped the  sweetened condensed milk. Also made it with a gluten free wgite cake and used the consed milk as gf cakes can be a dry. Great choice. Great reviews.

I have made it twice.  Made it dairy free also. No sweetened condensed milk.  Put coconut in the batter and sprinkled it on the sides and top.  Decorated it with sliced strawberries on top.  Everyone loved it!

I LOVE coconut so, when I saw this I knew it was for me.  I made it for my Birthday and it was a delicious addition to the day.  Took the leftovers to church and it was gone in a flash.  I was complimented on the fact it was not too sweet, just perfect.  Will definitely make this again.  Thank you.

I made the cake as directed except I toasted the coconut. The cake had an amazing flavor, however the texture was like soggy cake.  Next time I make it I will use only 1/2 of the coconut/condensed milk mixture and see if that helps the texture. I would definitely recommend toasting the coconut. Thanks for sharing, will definitely make many more times.

This cake is soooo good, LOVED IT!! When I made it for Thanksgiving  the only thing I changed was I lightly toasted 
the coconut  for the top just to give it a little more color.
Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This cake was amazing.  I know lots of people have said this - but seriously, this cake is amazing.  After reading a ton of reviews I was torn mainly about it being too sweet with coconut cream AND condensed milk.  I decided to try as written and see, as we really don't like overly sweet even in desserts.  Yes, no way was it too sweet with both.  It was truly fantastic.  I always substitute unsweetened apple sauce for oil,  added coconut extract to cake mix, made a topping of cream cheese, confec. sugar and heavy cream - which is a stabilized whipped cream.  I used a white cake mix - next time will try with something denser as it kind of became a little mushy as the cake was so fine.  But believe me, no one complained.  It's simple to make and so worth it.  The only problem is not overeating.

If you like coconut this is the absolute bomb!  I’ve made this 5 times now and I will continue to make it. I’ve shared the recipe with friends and they love it too. I make it in a bundt pan and use a straw to poke the holes. I’ve used both milk and cream and each work well.  I always toast my coconut. Make early in the day for dinner or the next day. The longer it sits the better. Absolutely delish!

Just pay attention to your coconut products and this will be great.   Coconut cream (typically found with Asian or Mexican ingredients) is NOT THE SAME as cream of coconut (such as coco lopez and the ones found among mixers destined for a pina colada).   If you use cream of coconut you are going to get it too sweet and “artificial” tasting.    Coconut cream is also not the same as coconut milk (but that’s a little closer, milk is just more watery).

I hate to bake and don't really like cake, but I love this.  I'm the first one in my circle of friends to bring it to parties.  Everyone has asked me for this recipe.  Its really amazing and so so easy.  My only suggestions are 1. I use Duncan Hines.  I tried Pillsbury once, and it wasnt good.  2.  Use the canned Cream of Coconut found in the Mexican section - ie. Goya.  You can use the uber processed stuff in the mixed drink section but its really not as good.

I made this cake but with a couple tweaks! I didn't use the sweetened condensed milk, I made fresh whipped cream (I never, ever  use Cool Whip) and I toasted the coconut before sprinkling it on top. It turned out great! Very moist and sweet enough!

My suggestion is to use just half of the condensed milk. It was really sweet but delicious. Garnished with flowers from my yard!

I substituted ground flax seed for eggs (I Tb of flax + 3 Tb of water for every egg).  I made two mistakes while making this cake. First, I forgot that you poke and pour while the cake is still hot. I waited until it was almost cool.   I put it in the fridge after soaking and topping for about 20 minutes and ate it after dinner.  

It was sooooooo sweet and soaking wet.  I put it back into the fridge until about 4 hours later when I wanted another piece (because duh, cake) and it was PERFECT.  Flavor was more balanced, not as sweet. The cake and moisture had held together rather than being so soggy and I was very happy.   MY ONLY CRITIQUE: 16 oz of whipped topping is way too much.  I put 12 oz (reg sized tub and a half) on top and felt it was still too much.   

I will definitely make this again. It is a great summer dessert. Next time I want to serve it with Strawberries. You also do not need to serve a huge slice as it is so sweet.

This cake was really good. I did make a few changes from a recipe that i have used before on Pinterest. It’s just making a box cake taste like bakery. It made the cake denser (I use it for all box cakes I make). You replace the oil with melted butter and double the amount. You use milk instead of water (same amount on box). Add an extra egg or 2. (I added 2 extra egg whites). Bake as directed. This only changed the cake density and consistency. This cake would’ve been delicious without those changes to the cake. Thanks for the recipe

RAVE reviews on this one, including the best ever coconut cake.  FYI, I was transporting it to function and wanted it to stay cold.  I put it in the freezer overnight and let it thaw on the way there in the cooler and it was wonderful.

My teenager daughter made this. It was very easy since the cake was from a cake mix and the frosting was store bought.
She put about 2/3 of the batter in an 8x11 pan and the rest in a muffin tin. Following some reviews recommendation, she used less condensed sweetened milk. She also used unsweetened coconut  powder ( what we had at the time) The cake was moist and had a delightful coconut flavor, and it is the ideal kind of cakes for beginner bakers.

I made it as a Christmas dessert. I added green food coloring to the coconut mixture and added red maraschino cherries on the top. It was a big hit. I didn’t have coconut cream so I put a can of coconut milk in the refrigerator and then scooped the hardened “cream” from the top of the can.  Though I did end up using a little of the watery milk left in the can to make it thinner so it would pour into the poke holes.

If you need something easy that is extra special, this is it! This delicious cake melts in your mouth. The cake (and I)get raves when I serve it. I followed the recipe as written. I used coconut milk. I  recommend refrigerating it for 2 hours or overnight before cutting it.

My husband and MIl loved this.  I feel it is a bit rich and not as much coconut flavor.  However, it is super easy to make, and aside from the coconut cream easy ingredients.  Will make again.

Note that the ingredient list doesn't include the extra ingredients that are called for by the cake mix. So, when shopping for the cake mix, be sure to review its directions so you'll have the right ingredients on hand. EVOO, by the way, works well instead of the usual vegetable oil. You could even use coconut oil. And coconut milk can be substituted for the water if you really want to go all in on coconut flavor. And, yes, as another reviewer noted, a cup of coconut flakes mixed into the cake mix helps, too. I suggest adding an extra egg or two for additional loft and structure, considering all the demands being made of the cake mix!

Everyone LOVED it!  Especially my husband, who doesn't normally like cake or coconut!  I made this as a last minute cake for a family gathering.  I was afraid it wouldn't be cooled in time, but a couple of hours ahead of time worked great!  I made it exactly to recipe.  I was thinking the coconut cream and condensed milk would be too much when I poured it on and it would be soggy, but it came out perfect!  Very flavorful, moist and yummy!  Even yummy the next day!

I made this cake and we loved it as well as others at a gathering I took it there. It was a bit too moist as I couldn't find a (18.25) cake mix  as the recipe called for, the largest ones I looked for was only(15.25) I was wondering if I could make a regular cake from scratch and followed the rest of the recipe if that would work. We did like the cake though it was delicious!!

LOVED the flavor of this cake, but fork holes didn't do it for me- need to use something larger (chopstick?) to make big enough holes for all of the thick liquid to soak in- as it was we ended up with some sauce to spoon over the rest.

I have made this cake twice now and it is a big hit with everyone.  I did make a few adjustments based on the comments of others.  I did not add the condensed milk, I used Duncan Hines coconut cake mix and I made my own frosting with unsweetened coconut flakes mixed in!!   The frosting is the sturdy whipped cream frosting. http://allrecipes.com/recipe/140837/sturdy-whipped-cream-frosting/
This is my go to frosting now and definitely a crowd pleaser!!   I did make the frosting with some almond extract, which paired nicely with the cake.

This got rave reviews from everyone! Not too sweet, in our opinion. Used coconut cream and sweetened condensed milk. Also used Lite Cool Whip mixed with a small ant of coconut on top. I like the idea of adding some extracts to the cake. Highly recommend! Will make again!

This cake was one of the most delicious cakes my family and co-workers have ever eaten!  I will say I slightly changed the topping.  I accidentally poked too large of holes in the cake.  To cover up this oops.... Instead of just topping the cake with whip cream, I wanted to make it a little thicker since I was transporting this to my work for a special luncheon.  I mixed the 8 oz. of cool whip with an 8 oz. package of cream cheese and 1 cup of powdered sugar.  I topped that with toasted coconut, as per the directions on the back of the bag of shredded coconut.  This mixture kept nice and firm in the fridge until we served it after lunch.  I can't tell you how many people asked for this recipe.  My family cannot WAIT for me to make this again.  Thank you for this delicious treat!!!

This is so easy & delicious! I had to substitute yellow cake mix as I didn't have white cake mix on hand, which made no difference at all. Also, I made homemade whipped cream using 2 C of heavy cream,  2t real vanilla extract & 2T confectioners sugar, beating with a chilled beater & bowl until peaks form & desired consistancy is reached. Family loves loves loves this one!

We loved it!  I cut down on the liquid, and it was still quite moist.  I baked it in two round cake pans, to make a layer cake, with cool whip between layers and over the top and sides of entire cake.  I covered it with toasted coconut - yum!  Planning on making it again soon.  Super easy!  Just remember to line the bottom of the pans with wax paper to make it easy to get the cooled cake layers out of the pans.

I didnt care for how thin the coconut cream and sweetened condensed milk was. I toasted the coconut for the top and that was much better. I put the coconut on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and baked at 350 degrees for 3 minutes on each side.

Thanks for tip where to find the Cream of coconut, in the alcohol section! I had made it before with Coconut milk and it was very good but with the Cream of coconut, it was outstanding. And I didnt use all of the mixture, too much of it.

I don't like the chemical taste of cool whip. I used milk instead of water called for in cake mix and added one egg for richness.
 I used real whipping cream, instead of cool whip, but stabilized the cream. 
Enjoy!

This cake recipe is OVER THE TOP!!! I did do a little tweaking to the recipe by adding 1/3 cup of the coconut flakes to the batter, increasing the baking time by 3-5 minutes to make up for the extra moisture from the coconut.   I had a half tub of ready-to-spread frosting I used for part of the cool whip (you don't need the entire tub as the recipe calls for, nor the entire pkg of coconut... so you'll have leftovers of both.)  I then added chopped pecans on top with the coconut flakes!

It only has 3 stars because of the box cake part.. I altered it to making the cake all the way from scratch, I scratched the whipped topping and used blended cream cheese, butter and confectioners sugar instead. I added almond extract along with the vanilla. I kept everything else the same.. Major hit. Thank you for sharing

This coconut poke cake is so easy and so good! My sis was right when she recommended it, "It's always the first one to disappear from the dessert buffet table and church functions." I did as she suggested and added 1 teaspoon of coconut extract to the cake batter. Also, I found a firm straw was the easiest and neatest way to "poke" the holes in the cake. It's much more uniform and the coconut cream/condensed milk mixture fills the holes quite nicely.

I've made this several times now, the first time exactly as written.  My rating is based on the recipe as submitted. 
I've made the following changes in subsequent cakes:  I've replaced the liquid in the cake box directions for coconut water and used coconut oil in place of vegetable oil and added an extra egg. I then replaced the store bought whipped topping for homemade whipped cream sprinkled with lightly toasted coconut. These changes are worth the extra steps for a more decadent cake.

I loved it! A little too sweet. I'll be sure to reduce the amount of sauce poured over the cake the next time. Otherwise, it was delicious!

This cake was so good!  The only thing I changed was I used less cool whip and it turned out perfect! Will definitely make again!

This cake was easy, fun and delicious. I added 2tsp of almond extract to the cake mix and toasted the coconut. It came out fantastic!

For those who might not be a fan of coconut --  like me -- this recipe might be the recipe that shifts your perspective! My family constantly asks for this treat. 

I admittingly tweak the ingredients a bit, like using real whipped cream and topping it off with a  toasted combination of organic coconut flakes and almonds; but, other than that, the ease, the moistness (is that a word?), and the taste is absolutely SINFUL!!!

This recipe has been a family favorite for years. However, I have always made it without the condensed milk and it is wonderful (and much less sweet) this way. Highly recommend trying it this way.

Wow is this a sweet cake. I love coconut but this to me seemed very subtle other than what was on top of it. I will make this again but next time I am going to leave out the sweetened condensed milk as see if that helps with the sweet factor.

I made it with a gluten free cake mix since my husband has Celiac  and it was great.  A lot of times gluten free baked goods can be grainy or just bad, but because this has all the moisture of the condensed milk and cream of coconut it was amazing!

I have made this cake many times over the last 20 + years.  I use French Vanilla cake mix and I add a package of frozen coconut to the cake batter and either add a package of frozen coconut to the cool whip or just sprinkle on top.  I do think cutting back on the condensed milk helps with the "too sweet" taste you can get from this cake. But, if that doesn't bother your taste buds, by all means go for the whole 14 oz.   Everyone always loves this cake. I have even had requests to bring it to family reunions.

I just made this tonight and it came out AMAZING!  I baked the cake per the recipe, with one small change.  I  added 2 tsps of coconut extract based on previous suggestions to the batter.  As soon as I took it out of the oven, I used a chopstick to make holes in the cake and SLOWLY poured in the sweetened condensed milk and cream of coconut (which you can find in the section of your store that sells mixers for drinks or at your liquor store).  I then put it in the refrigerator and after about an hour, mixed the Cool Whip and coconut, then spread it on the cake.  I used a 13 X 9 pan, and an 8 ounce container of Cool Whip was just the right amount.  If you are doing a layer cake, you would want more.  I will be making this cake over and over.  My boyfriend, who isn't fond of cakes, told me this was better than his favorite coconut cream pie.  Definitely try this recipe....you won't regret it!

I thought the coconut cream was way too sweet so I have made it since with coconut milk and evaporated milk.  Also a small dowel rod worked better than poking with a fork.  The fork didn't make big enough holes for the liquid to soak in.  I also used real whipped cream rather than whipped topping.  It's very similar to a tres leches cake except with coconut!

I made this cake 2 times, every body love them.  The 1st one I use golden butter cake mix, the 2nd one I use vanilla cake mix (I prefer vanilla cake mix). I changed a little bit by reduce the condenced milk, I only use about 1/4 can or until is sweet enough and also I roast the shreded coconut until just golden brown. 
This cake become one of our favorite recipe.

The liquid absorbed into the cake  but not enough. The caked "floated" in the liquid. The flavor was awesome but just never got to the absorption that the old jello poke cake did.  Will make it again using no sweetened condensed milk ...only coconut cream and some pineapple juice.

I didn't make a single change and this simple recipe was fabulous!  Definitely for the sweet tooth as it is really rich and super moist.  I think the flaked coconut on top brings it all together with spectacular texture and flavor.  A few people had said they added coconut extract to the cake mix but i don't think it's necessary as it has a lot of coconut flavor.

So good!!  My family couldn't get enough and keep dropping hints as to when I'll be making it again.  I made a few alterations.  Homemade "from scratch" cake instead of a boxed mix.  Mixed coconut milk (just the solidified part) with the sweetened condensed milk instead of cream of coconut.  Definitely sweet enough even for my super sweet tooth.  (I used the liquidy part of the coconut milk in my cake recipe.  Also used coconut extract in the cake.) And I used homemade whipped cream, sweetened with icing sugar.

This may be the best coconut cake I have ever eaten!  It is certainly the best one I've ever made (and I've made a few)!  And with a cake mix!  Who would have thought?  I made this cake exactly as the recipe instructs.  Next time I may use a white cake from a scratch recipe, but I must say, I was very pleased with it as it is!

Best coconut cake ever!  I make this all the time and everyone loves it.  I've been adding some coconut extract in my batter and I think it gives it a little more coconutty flavor.   Personally I prefer using the cream of coconut in the squeeze bottle.  The cans are yucky!  I find it on the baking aisle at my store too...just FYI.

It was quick and easy.  I added some roasted almonds and crushed pineapple, which made it more Hawaiian and colorful .  It has become a family special treat.

This cake is good , but way to sweet. The second time making it I only used the creamed coconut, no condensed mike. I also added vanilla, almond and coconut extract to the cake batter.  I also added creamed coconut to the cool whip topping . Much better..

I made a few changes. I also used Jello Coconut Pudding ( GO BY DIRECTIONS ON BOX )  on top of cake after cooling and adding the cream of coconut and  evaporated  milk and changed flaked coconut to frozen. My family absolutely loves it.

I followed the original recipe almost exactly but did a couple changes. I added in coconut cream instant pudding to the cake mix before stirring. I found sweetened condensed coconut  milk (yes, there is such a thing) in the Asian Foods section and subbed with that. I chilled the cake for 24 hours before topping with cool whip & coconut.  The next time I bake this again, I will adjust the portions. I will increase the cream of coconut and decrease the condensed milk. Although I used a condensed coconut milk version, I thought it was too sweet. The cake is still moist though and not dry. Everybody I served it to liked it! Especially my Dad since I baked it for his birthday. He turned 84! He loves his coconut desserts!

this is a great recipe and have made it twice for my husband.  the coconut cream and the condense milk you just have to see if the coconut milk is sweet enough for you.  if not then add the condense milk to taste.

I’ve made this for so many birthdays, bake sales and work functions and it has become “Cassandra’s famous coconut cake”. I love to share the recipe with people, my only addition to the recipe is to add a small package of coconut pudding to the batter to make it extra spongy and moist.

I was a little nervous making this cake. I never made a poke cake before and the amount to pour over the cake seemed a bit excessive, to me.  I made the cake pretty much as written, and I have to say I did enjoy the cake. With that being said it was a bit to wet for my liking. If I make again I will reduce the amount of cream of coconut and sweetened condensed milk. I also think that a 16 oz tub of cool whip is to much as well, the small tub would work just fine.

Pretty good use of a .79 white cake mix.  I used coconut oil instead of the vegetable oil the  directions called for.  Only 3 stars because :
1) the directions don't mention, if you make  layers, you have to IMMEDIATELY turn the layes out of the pan and stack them, and then poke and pour.  No need to frost between layers.  But ,you couldn't remove them if you waited until after you poured in the milk mixture.  The cake would fall apart.
2)  Frozen whipped topping would have made this tooth achingly sweet.  I used a lightly sweetened basic stabilized whiiped cream icing.

Like all  poke cakes I've tried, this one is very sweet. It is delicious but does have that "box cake" taste, which is why I'm only rating 4 stars. I give it a 10 for convenience, however, next time I'll try a white cake recipe from scratch and homemade whipped cream. That should make it 5 stars.

This cake was very easy to make and everyone raved about it.  When I first tasted the cake I did not like the wetness and that is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  I will make it again for friends, but I can not really eat it because wheat  make me itch. But I have to taste everything before I serve it to others. The only thing I did different was that I added a teaspoon of coconut flavoring to the cake mix because I love coconut. Plus I used coconut milk and I will use cream of coconut like the others suggested.

Forgetting to pick up sweetened condensed milk I used instant coconut pudding but followed  the recipe.... This is by far the most refreshing, delicious coconut cake I have ever baked.  This is so moist and delicious.. Big hit with my family.

We really enjoyed this cake. I listened to other reviewers: Coconut extract in cake mix, leave the sweetened condensed milk in the store. The cake is sweet enough with only Coconut Cream (found in the liquor section at the store). We also put blueberries and strawberries on it! Awesome results!!

Fantastic! Some tips for those wanting them... Make sure to use coconut CREAM found in the alcohol section of your store.   Don't  remove cake from pan before or after adding milk/cream mixture. It's meant to stay in the pan. Use something large (like a chop stick, straw, etc.) to make the holes so the mixture can get down into the cake properly. Pour the coconut cream/condensed milk mixture over the cake while still hot and the more holes you poke, the better. I like to top this with homemade buttercream icing and top with flaked coconut. But when I do use whipped cream, it is homemade, not cool whip (personal preference - I can't stand the artificial taste of cool whip).

This is a truly delicious and easy to make cake that can be a showstopper if you go the extra mile with your topping choice (meaning, make it homemade), and topping with lots of flaked coconut. Yum!!!

I would make it again. I did seem to have a lot of the ccream of coconut and sweetened condensed milk mixture on the side of the pan. I think my cake cooled too much so next time I will mix that ahead of time and have it ready to pour on the cake. It still tasted delicious!

This recipe is a keeper! Like others I did add a few drops of coconut extract to the cake batter. I also only used a small 4 oz can of cream of coconut with an additional drops of coconut extract. It made the perfect amount mixed in with the condensed milk therefore not to soggy. I also used real whipped cream versus the Cool Whip. Everyone loved the cake!

Delicious!  Instead of packaged whipped topping, I made fresh whipped cream.  It was outrageously good!

Amazing recipe.  People will rave and shower you with compliments, guaranteed.  I cut back to 8 oz extra creamy Cool.Whip, and thought that was plenty.  I also toasted the sweetened coconut flakes in a large skillet over medium heat stirring frequently until lightly browned.  Cool toasted coconut completely before sprinkling on top on the Cool Whip.  The texture and nuttiness of the toasted coconut on top made the cake extra delicious.

I used the coconut milk and thickened with corn starch.  Worked great.  My husband doesn't like coconut, but he liked this cake.  Took to work to share - everyone loved it!

I found the cream of coconut in a health food store after searching every grocery store in town. But I'm wondering if it still wasn't the right product after reading these reviews. It was to thin even after adding it to the sweetened condensed milk, and I was very disappointed that there wasn't a coconut flavor to the cake once it was done.  I did doctor the cool whip topping, by adding powder sugar and rum flavoring so there was some flavor to the overall taste.

Fabulous!!!!
Followed the recipe. I didn't change a thing! Had a hard time finding the coconut cream and had to Google it standing in Walmart. I found it in the alcohol section. Apparently it's more popular there.

I actually got this recipe from a dear lady many years ago, and it's my husband's favorite cake.  She called it Coco Lopez cake, as that's the brand of coconut cream available in the booze aisle of most grocery stores.  A small piece goes a long way - it's very rich.  I measure out about a cup of coconut for a 9X13 cake, and then toast half of it in a pan, toss in a bowl with the untoasted coconut, then top the cake with it.  So delicious!

I made this cake but changed a bit. I did not have the cream of coconut. Used half a can of condensed milk and half a can of evaporated milk. I substitute the oil in the cake with applesauce . Whipped topping is just the right thing for this cake because the other main ingredients are so sweet. Top of with sweeten coconut flakes and blueberries.  A big hit in my house. Will definitely make again and again and again....

Made this yesterday and we love it. I did make some changes after reading other reviews. I used a yellow butter cake mix and used pineapple juice in place of the water called for. I only used 1/2 of the sweetened condensed milk. I also mixed about 3/4 cup coconut flakes into the batter and mixed coconut into the cool whip rather than sprinkling on top. I will be making this again might try a pineapple cake mix next time with coconut water in place of the water called for.

I give it a 4.5.  I added 3/4 tsp. coconut extract to the cake and use coconut milk instead of cream of coconut, because it's what I had on hand.  I think the coconut flavor was weak, but the moistness didn't suffer in the least.  In fact, I couldn't get the cake to soak up all of the liquid, even though I let it sit for over 5 hours.  I only used an 8 oz. tub of Cool Whip and 1 cup of coconut for the topping...it was enough.  Any more would have been too much.  Overall, I think it's a good cake...easy to make too.  I will use this recipe again...it's a good one to take  to an event.

AMAZING!!!   A family hit and required at every occasion.  I also took it to a pot luck on Thanksgiving and everyone was asking "who made the coconut cake" and also, "will you share your recipe"!!!   We have a local restaurant who serves the best coconut cake EVER!  I always wished I could get their recipe.  Guess What….  I FOUND IT!!!!

I think this is a fantastic recipe. However, the first time I made it I felt it was too sweet. I made a small adjustment and it was perfect. I completely skipped the sweetened condensed milk and added a half of cup of light cream to the cream of coconut. Every time I make this cake I get rave reviews!

Made this for my hard-to-please boyfriend and he loved it! He had 2nds and 3rds. My only complaint is that it doesn't taste very coconut-ty which is either a good thing or bad depending on what you like. I did add coconut extract to the batter but think I may add more next time and use coconut oil instead of vegetable oil. Glad I followed other reviewers' advice and only used some of the cream of coconut and no condensed milk. It was just the right sweetness!

It was very good, matter of fact too good! I did heed the warning of previous reviews about the sweetness of the cake, so I used a can of cream of coconut and about 1/4 of a can of condensed sweetened milk and it was plenty sweet enough! I believe if I had used the entire can of condensed milk it would've been too sweet for my taste. My family said it as good too!

I've made this a few times now. Instead of using a cake mix, I make my cake from scratch and I make my own whipped topping. This is, by far, my favorite cake!

This is the BEST cake! I use lightly sweetened fresh whipped cream instead of cool whip. Some in my family prefer the cool whip, some the fresh whipped cream, but since I'm making the cake I do it the way I like it! I think it is best if you make the cake at least a few hours ahead of serving and allow the cream of coconut to soak in while refrigerated. Then add the whipped cream and flaked coconut right before serving. There is never any left, so I don't know how it tastes the next day.

This recipe is very versatile.  Try Pineapple Coconut with a pineapple cake mix and Chocolate Coconut with a Devilsfood cake mix.  Also, I often use only half of the Cream of Coconut/Sweetened Condensed Milk mixture and freeze the rest for another cake later.  The cake is still very moist and sweet.

I have made this cake before and this is what you do:  Bake in two 9" cake pans. While cakes bake, toast coconut in a skillet for a couple of minutes, till light brown. Make fresh whipped cream, add coconut flavoring. Warm coconut cream (NOT cream of coconut) and scm in microwave, just until blended. Allow cake layers to cool,remove from pans. Frost bottom layer with half the whipped cream and toasted coconut. Cover with top layer and carefully poke holes through both layers using the narrow end of a chop stick. Slowly spoon (or pour) the warm cream mixture into the holes and over the top layer. Be sure to do this very slowly, it will soak into both layers. Top with the remaining whipped cream, toasted coconut and fresh sliced strawberries.  Garnish with berries around the edges of the plate. This is a great recipe, it's just the assembly and using coconut cream vs cream of coconut that needs tweaking.

This cake will receive raves all around.  So easy to make.  I did not use the bagged version or dry coconut.  The frozen "real" flaked coconut (can be found in Walmart) is so much better and truly makes this cake fit for your fussiest guests. Yummmy...

Cream of coconut where have you been all my life?!
Awesome recipe - though I did omit the sweetened condensed milk and made my own whipped cream.  I also added coconut extract to the cake batter and to the whipped cream.
This cake tastes even better after it sits in the fridge for a day.
Thanks for satisfying my coconut craving! :)

I absolutely love coconut cake and decided to make this cake for my birthday.  I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and poured the cream mixture slowly over the cake to make sure it was spread equally throughout the cake.  With the amount of liquid, I was afraid the cake would be really soggy but it was perfectly moist.  The only reason I'm not giving it 4 stars is because it was a bit sweet and didn't have a pronounced coconut flavor even with all the coconut on the top.  Maybe next time, I'll add some coconut to the cake mix before baking.

Made this yesterday for a birthday, it was awesome. Everyone had a second slice!

I used the Betty Crocker extra-moist white cake + the zest of 1 lime added to the batter. My grocery store didn`t have cream of coconut, so I put coconut milk in the fridge and used the thickest cream portion of it that rose to the top of the can. Scared it would be too sweet, I only used half the can of condensed milk. 

Lime and coconut,yum!

Omg this cake is to die for! My mother in law requested I make a coconut cake and found this recipe. It was a hit with everyone that ate it. I did however use yellow cake mix and didn't put in the whole coconut cream and condensed milk mixture, just half of it. It still tasted great, I recommend everyone who loves coconut make this delicious cake.

This cake was delicious!  I am so thankful that another reviewer mentioned that coconut cream could be found near the alcohol/cocktail mix section of the grocery store- I would never have thought to look there, but there it was!  That saved me a trip to a specialty grocery store.  I made this cake to take to a 4th of July BBQ and it was a huge hit!  I decorated the top with strawberries and blueberries to make it look like a U.S. flag, and the berries were a nice compliment to the coconut flavor.

The best poke cake I have ever made! I used white cake and only half the sweetened cond milk. It was still so sweet, next time I will try it without bc the cream of coconut is all sugar.  I changed the icing and used the "Whipped Creme Mouse Frosting" recipe from this site. It calls for instant pudding so I used coconut flavored. For fun, I folded a well-drained 8 oz. can of crushed pineapple into the icing (I used the juice in my box cake mix in place of water).  The pineapple totally made it bc it cut the sweet a little and balanced the coconut flavor. I topped with toasted coconut and this is my new favorite cake!

I have been craving coconut everything lately. This cake does not disappoint. I made the cake from scratch using the Heavenly White Cake recipe from this site, and used coconut milk instead of coconut cream because that was all I had on hand. Anyway, the cake came out fantastic. I will definitely be making this again.

I added 1/2 tsp coconut flavor to batter, left out the condensed sweetened milk, and relied on 1/2 bottle of cream of coconut used for mixed drinks.  A very moist and sweet cake.

This cake is unreal delicious and moist! I didn't have coconut flavoring so I just used the sweetened condensed milk and the coconut cream and it was still nice and coconutty :) For the frosting I used the Cool Whip Frosting recipe and instead of French Vanilla pudding mix I used the Cheesescake pudding which I could have ate the whole bowl of that... I sprinkled the coconut on top and let it sit for awhile and I made more brownie points with my new Hubby!!He loved it!! This would be perfect for a shower,Easter or really any nice occasion, even those office parties!So easy too!

Easy to make. I substituted 2 oz of coconut rum for water in the cake mix. Really added a great flavor to the cake.

I have used "Sweet cakes" method.. store didn't have coconut cream pudding, so I got vanilla, used french vanilla cake, and omitted the SCM, as others recommended. So far, I tasted everything before it is all put together. I have a great feeling about this!

Really quite good!  It's much better after it refrigerates a day or so as well.  The weak part of the cake is the cool whip, which just really has an overwhelming fake taste.  I think next time I'll try fresh whipped cream or maybe even coconut milk whipped cream.  You definitively do not need the sweetened condensed milk as others have noted.  It is plenty sweet enough.

This cake was excellent! It was the wings for my daughter's angel birthday cake and it was a hit! I followed the directions to a T and was a little worried about cutting and moving the wings into place, but the cake was not soggy at all (it was refridgeratered overnight before moving). I got many complements!

I have made this cake several times and it tastes wonderful and is so easy to make. The only change I make is I use French Vanilla cake mix instead of white. I think that gives the cake extra flavor.

Made this recipe for my DH's B-day. I couldn't find coconut cream so I used a can of coconut milk. Otherwise, I made it exactly as the recipe said. I wanted to make it into a round cake, so I used 3 8-inch cake pans, buttered the bottom of the pan and put parchment paper over it, and then buttered the parchment paper and the sides. Then I cooked all 3 cake pans in the oven until done. I quickly poked holes in them via chopsticks and poured the mixture of coconut milk and condensed milk over it (the coconut milk really thinned down the condensed milk, so I didn't need to heat it up to thin it). Then I waited for it to cool before flipping them over to assemble the birthday cake. I used a third of the whipped cream and mixed it with some coconut flakes to put in between the cake layers. It was a little scary flipping the cake over to layer them, but the parchment paper and butter really helped. It wasn't too hard to position either with the whipped cream in between the layers. Then I frosted the whole cake with whipped cream and dusted toasted coconut flakes all over. It sat in the fridge until dinner time when we enjoyed it. With coconut milk, it was a little wet at the bottom of the cake after sitting in the fridge, and it was a little too sweet for my taste. But overall, very pretty cake and overall very easy to make.

yes I tried this cake.  It's delicious just like it is.  I was wondering if you could use frozen coconut instead of flaked. Has anyone tried it?

I been making this for so very long!
But instead of pouring the ingredients on top i use a baster and poke holes and then fill them with the mixture. the cake is best cold and every bite you'll get just a bit of gooeyness!

Excellent!  Put 2 tsp coconut extract into cake batter.  Nice and moist and not heavy.  Keeps pretty well in the refrigerator too.

Yum;this coconut poke cake was very tasty. I am sensitive to overly sweet desserts, so I am not sure why other reviewers are saying that this cake is too sweet. My family loved it. I did add about 2 tsp of coconut extract to the batter and toasted the coconut, so it's possible that those changes made a difference. I will definitely make this again.

Just made this last night for an anniversary party.  Absolutely delicious!  I used coconut milk instead of cream of coconut and worked out beautifully.  Everyone loved, and could not wait to have piece for breakfast in the morning!

Easy and error-proof cake!

This was delicious. I made it exactly as the recipe states. Cream of coconut was a little difficult to find, but I found it in the Mexican food section of the grocery store. It was super moist and almost tasted better day 2 after being refrigerated.

I thought this cake would taste more like a coconut cake, but it just tasted like a plain old boxed cake.  I even used REAL whipped cream.  I wasn't impressed at all.  Quite a disappointment!  What a waste of my whipped cream and coconut cream.  I only made it because it had such good reviews.  People must not be used to baking from scratch to think this was great.

I made this cake for a group of teachers.  They were very impressed.  Most of them ended up asking for the recipe.  I followed the instructions exactly, except I used coconut cake mix instead of white. It could not have turned out better! Fantastic recipe...I will definitely be making it again.

This is a great cake if you love coconut. I used vegetable shorting instead of the oil beacuse I didn't have any. Also I put coconut fakes in the cake batter to give it that much more of a coconut taste. Everyone loved it.

very good recipe! i made this for my daughter's bday and a coworker's bday. both times i made a 9x13 sheet layer cake with angel's food cake on top and devil's food cake on the bottom. i used 2 cans of coco lopez on the top layer and 1 can on the bottom layer. i soaked the cakes while they were still warm from the oven. i omitted the condensed milk based on what other reviewers said about it being too sweet.  then i refrigerated cakes overnight, and frosted them with a cream cheese frosting recipe that i found on barefoot contessa's site. topped the cake with toasted flaked coconut and decorated with fresh flowers! everybody raved about the cake! try it, you will not be disappointed.  thank you for sharing this recipe!

Amazing! Have made this easy recipe twice in the past couple of weeks, and it is to die for.. We also used a suggestion from one other review to mix the coconut with the whip cream before topping.. Totally Devine..

I got this recipe from a friend and was surprised to see it on here. The only difference is that hers was made with yellow cake. Add 1 small box of vanilla pudding mix to the cake batter. It is fabulous!!!!

I made it for a work party and everyone asked for the recipe.  It tastes a little like coconut pie, which I love.  I toasted the coconut which gives it a delicious chewy texture.

This cake tasted delicious! BUT, the one can of coconut cream and one can of condensed milk wasn't enough for the cake to soak through. The milk had only settled mostsly around the edges. I'll probably up the amount next time so it'll have the tres leches mexican cake texture I was hoping for. I also toasted some more coconut to sprinkle over the cake, yumm!

I've recently fallen in love with coconut cake, so I decided I wanted to make one myself, and I came across this recipe. 
It was easy and simply it was to make and I loved how moist it turned out. It was yummy, however a tad too sweet for me. I think next time I make it, (which I definitely will!) I'll try what others have mentioned and not use sweetened condensed milk. Thanks for the recipe!

This cake was SO GOOD!! (I used a buttercream frosting instead of the one called for in the recipe.) This cake was very easy to make and it tasted fabulous! I made it for an Easter dessert and everyone loved it. I will definitely be making this again.

Sooo good and yummy, made it for my hubby's 35th Bday and everyone loved it.  Did toast half of the shredded coconut just for a little crunch and added maraschino cherries for decoration.  Maybe next time will try to add the coconut extract to the batter as some have suggested, otherwise great as written, definetly a keeper.

This cake is wonderful and moist.  So much better, though, if you use real whipped cream, slightly sweetened, instead of the whipped topping.  The folks in my office devoured it!

I followed the recipe exactly but now i think i should've taken other viewers' advice.. it was crumbly, too sweet and too moist. We love coconut so i added coconut extract and it couldve been more coconut flavored.

ONLY FOR THE COCONUT LOVERS!  I do not care fore coconut so I would personally give it about 3 stars but others who like coconut said it was to die for.  Followed directions exactly except I also added a little coconut to the cake mix.

I cooked this cake it two rounds & poured the liquid over the cakes. It completely soaked the cakes & made it impossible to remove from the pans in one piece or frost. Apparently the way to make this cake is in a 9X13 pan & leave it in the pan for frosting & serving. The cake is really good, but right now it's in total pieces.

Oh, my. I just made this to see if I thought it would be a good dessert to enter into a competition this weekend... and I couldn't even finish the piece before rating it as 5 stars.   The only modification I made was to put a bit of coconut extract into the batter of the cake mix before baking and also into the Cool Whip before frosting.   Holy. I love this. Excited to win the competition. Ü  Thanks for such a great recipe!

I was surprise with this cake. I had hoped for the best since it had great reviews but as I made it I became a bit nerve as I soaked the cake in the mix. BUT it came out perfect. Oh, and I followed the recipe to the T :-)

Very good cake but I only rated it 4 stars because I just used the cream of coconut and didn't add the condensed milk as the recipe called for...I think it would have been too sweet for my family.

Wonderful cake! I wanted a complete homemade cake, so I used the recipe for Simple White Cake from this site, rather than a box mix. Very moist and yummy!!

I have mixed feelings about this cake and the company I made it for either couldn't stop raving about it or thought it was just way too wet for them. It does remind me of a tres leche cake actually and if you like that sort of thing then I think this will be a big hit. The flavor is good and the cake VERY moist. It didn't blow me away but I really enjoyed it. I did end up having to make more whip cream for it b/c the recipe doesn't call for enough. So the verdict is, Good taste, VERY moist, but I'll stick to my favorite coconut cream pie.

I really liked this recipe. However, i was unable to find coconut cream in my area so i mixed an instant coconut pudding mix with the sweetened condensed milk. This mixture was really runny at first so it didnt go down into the holes very well but once i put it in the fridge and it settled it was really good. I also topped the cake with toasted coconut. I will definitly make this again.

Absolutely delicious....I made it and  brought it for a pot luck lunch and it is GONE! and many people commented how good it was! Very moist. I added the pineapple before the cream topping and toasted the coconut. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.

Fabulous cake!  The first time I made it, it ended up way too gooey.  My fault because I allowed the cake to cool.  The second time I made this it was perfect!

I made this exactly as written and wouldn't make it again without some alterations. First of all, the cream of coconut/condensed milk combination made the cake WAY too sweet. And I love sweets, so it's unusual for me to think something is too sweet. Also, there is too much liquid. I ended up with a goopy, soggy mess. I couldn't cut out a piece of cake and expect it to stay together; it was just that wet. So, in the future, I would probably substitute skim milk for the sweetened condensed milk (to drastically cut down on the sweetness) and half the liquids (using 7 oz of each cream of coconut/skim milk instead of 14 oz each.) Even then, I probably wouldn't use all the liquid...

This cake was amazing! I used coconut milk as well and it cut the sweetness a little. Also, I used real whipped-cream with a little coconut extract in it and toasted the coconut for the top! HUGE hit!

the best cake i have ever made or tasted!!!  there were no 8oz packs of flaked coconut at our walmart so i used a 14oz pack. i measured out a little more than 8oz for the frosting while the cake was baking. then after i took out the cake and poured on the cream of coconut mixture i sprinkled half of what was left and sprinkled on the rest after i frosted the cake  i took the cake to a party and it was gone before i could take a picture  it was one of those cakes that falls apart so if you arent using a pan that you dump the cake out and it is shaped like something (like an animal etc.) then i suggest leaving it in the pan  this cake is great for any celebration or if youre just craving something sweet and is very easy to make  p.s. do NOT use whipped topping that is in spray cans it gets VERY watery (i made that mistake :/)

This cake was way too sweet for me.  I suggest using half the condensed milk like others have said.  I was going to take it to work for co-workers, but thought they would find it too sweet also, so I will have to dump this one and try again.  I did put almond flavoring in the milk mixture and that gave it a really nice hint of flavor.

Fabulously delicious cake! Took it to an Iron Chef night where coconut was the ingredient and won 2nd place. Wanted to present it on a cake stand rather than serve it out of a pan. I knew the  whipped cream would fall off the sides of the cake so I added about 6 oz of cream cheese and 3/4 c. powdered sugar to whipped cream to make it stiffer. Worked great! It added several more calories and grams of fat, but at this point, who's counting?

The first time I made this, I followed the recipe and it  was wonderful!  Then I made one small change and it was even better!!  Try using the WHITE ALMOND WEDDING CAKE recicpe from CUPYCAKESMURF for your base cake.  Then pick up this recipe at "while still hot ...."  YUMMY!

All I can say is WOW.  I've NEVER received as many reviews for a cake as I did when I presented this at my sister's 21st birthday.  It was a HIT!!  I was worried because I accidentally picked up a can of coco frio, (which is coconut cream already mixed with sugars, ready for a pina colada).  I mixed a half cup of half anf half in it, and poured that over the cakes instead, but the worry was unwarranted.  I'll stick with what I did.  Also added a few drops of coconut extract to the cake batter prior to baking.  Voila--Fantastique!!!

This cake was super sweet.  I even used coconut milk, thickened it with cornstarch, and, used real whipping cream to top instead of cool whip.  I'm gonna try again soon, but probably use 1/2 a can of condensed milk.

I used my favorite white cake recipe (sweet cream cake from the Betty Crocker Picture Cookbook) and it was really outstanding. I think this would even be pretty good with a box cake mix. I always hate to use them but the coconut cream just makes it so moist and flavorful I don't know that you could tell the difference.

I have no choice but to give this 5 stars.  I served it at the superbowl party and everyone LOVED it! It was so moist and delicious. I did use the coconut cream and a half can of sweetened condensed milk (I think a whole can would have been fine) I also frosted it with real whipped cream. I served the cake with a raspberry sauce that looked beautiful with the white and tasted delicious. (1C no-sugar added frozen raspberries and 1-2 tsp sugar and mashed them with a fork)

I made this as written with a box cake but my cake fell apart when I poked it (my fault, I used the back of a wooden spoon... figured big holes would be better but I was wrong!) so I had to make a homemade white cake instead.  I then followed the recipe to a "T."  I personally found it to be way too sweet, but my husband loved it.  I guess I was hoping for a more of an Italian Cream Cake (just because thats what the picture kind of looked like)which this definitely was not.  4 stars b/c I really felt this cake was just way too sweek...

I love coconut cake and this one turned out awesome. It was so simple and easy to make yet turned out so delicious. After reading the reviews I used half the sweetened condensed milk and it turned out perfect. I will be adding this to my recipe box for sure!

Can't remember if I have ever rated this before but just in case....I give it a 5 star--exactly the way it is written.  I've made this so many times!  Hubby asks for this as his birthday cake.  Also the ingredients can be kept in the pantry ready to whip up in a hurry. Thanks for this recipe!

This cake is sooooo good.  I thought it would be a soggy mess but it is really moist.  However, I didn't use any S.C milk.  I just used 14 oz of the coconut cream.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Oh my goodness - the best cake ever and so easy!  I have been making this for years and it is always a huge hit. It is light, fluffy and so moist. I like it best when served cold. My husband doesn't even like coconut and he likes this; I just don't use as much coconut on top. If you haven't tried this yet, try it - you'll love it!  =)

Have had this a few times and even the non-coconut fans loved this!  The best thing is, even 3 days after it's made, it is still completely moist like it was just made.  I never thought my favorite cake would be something that isn't chocolate, but this was literally, a sweet surprise!

This recipe is soooo good but it's much better to prepare your own whipping cream with a little sugar! I also fancied it up by using fresh, grated coconut from the health food store.

I liked the flavor.  I made it into a bundt cake and had difficulty keeping the cake together as I poked the holes and could only add half the mixture. Next time I will cut the cake in half and drench each half then place a layer of whipped cream on top.  I opted for real whipping cream instead of the cool whip brand and sprinkled coconut on the top of the bundt only.

Everyone at my office said it was perfect!  I couldn't find coconut cream, so I used coconut milk with half the amount of condensed milk.  Real whipped cream with toasted coconut and slivered almonds topped it off.  It was a hit!

This was amazing. Everyone really loved it. I followed the recipe exactly except for the whipped topping. I have no idea how one could use 16 oz. I only used barely half that amount and it was just right. The ooey gooeyness of this cake makes it so delicious. But it isn't overly wet and is still good 2 days later. BTW, I used cream of coconut not coconut milk like some others. It was in the liquor section of the grocery store. It's what is used to make foo foo drinks.

My family and I really enjoyed this cake.  I read a review and used coconut milk instead of coconut cream.  It is important to make larger holes in order to hold the mixture.  A fork did not work very well.

My family loved this.  I agree with other reviewers that the coconut flavor was not huge.  I didn't try any of the suggestions to boost the coconut flavor, tho.  Made in 9x13 glass pyrex, only used 1/2 the sweetened condensed milk, let set overnight in fridge and frosted at the party.  Oh, and I agree that it definitely ony needs 1/2 the cool whip  called for.

This cake could be a 5 star if were not for the cake mix. I made my own cake, which was the Simple White Cake from this site, and it turned out fantastic. I will definitely make this again, but next time I will cut the condensed milk in half because it was too sweet.

I've had this recipe in my recipe box for a while.  I was waiting for the perfect occasion to make it.  This cake is delicious.  It's very sweet but moist and light.  I was hesitant to use all of the sweetened condensed milk and cream of coconut but I did anyway and I'm very happy with the outcome.  I would highly recommend this cake.  It's easy and holds up well.

I made this for mother's day.  This was a really moist, yummy cake.  I didn't use the whole coconut creme/milk mixture to pour onto the cake.  I only used about 2/3's as I was afraid the cake would be too wet.  I made this the night before and refridgerated the cake overnight.  Also, I used chocolate fudge cake mix.  The cake didn't have too much of a coconut flavor to it? Maybe because the chocolate cake overpowered it. But it was really moist, delicious, and very pretty.  Mine didn't come out too sweet as other reviews have warned.

I used a yellow cake mix and replaced the oil with applesauce.  VERY good cake but a little on the sweet side for me.  I thought it was too moist and heavy so I think next time I'll only used the coconut cream and not the condensed milk, only because I like lighter cakes.  But it was very easy to make!

I made this cake last night and loved it.  It wasn't too sweet but it was lusciously mosit.  I made it with a yellow cake mix and it was wonderful.  Next time I will make with a white cake mix like the recipe calls for but the yellow cake mix was great.

I followed the directions and used a 9 x 13 dish.  It was very good but also very sweet.  But then... it's cake after all! I'll make this again when we need a sugar rush!  Very good.

I've had mixed feeling on this cake through the whole process; white cake mix?  A lot of liquid? But the end result is perfect!  The cream mixture thickened up after sitting in the fridge but my only complaint is it didn't completely soak in the cake, it pooled around the sides.  The cake wasn't soggy like I thought it would be like Tres Leche.  IMO, 12 oz. of Cool Whip is plenty.  I can't honestly say how much coconut we used since I just topped in on individual slices since I didn't want to waste the coconut if we didn't like the cake.  Will probably make again.

Such an easy recipe to make! The taste is light, not too much coconut or too sweet flavor. We found it to be so delicious and will definitely become a family favorite!

Wanting to cut the sweetness some, I made this with coconut milk instead of the coconut cream and it came out wonderful.  I used half of the milk combo on one cake and baked a yellow cake with choco chips and topped it with the ramaining milk. FABULOUS! OH YUM!  Definately going to make this again and again.  Simply wonderful!  Enjoy!

This is so easy and so good.  My husband hates coconut and he loves this.  I just leave flaked coconut off of half for him.  I've made it several times, exactly as written and it's always popular.

This was scrumptious! Made this for my dad for his b-day and everyone loved it. Very moist and coconutty. My only changes were to poke holes with the back of a wooden spoon instead of using a fork. I also added 1 tsp. coconut extract to the condensed milk/cream of coconut mixture. I did make this cake a day ahead before I served it. I think this let the flavors really come together. I also had no trouble finding cream of coconut....I found Goya brand in my grocery store. Thanks for a really tasty cake, will make again!

This cake is so delicious and moist! I followed the recipe and my family did not have a problem with the sweetness. We loved it. I'm making it for the second time tonight for company. The only thing I found is that you don't need 16 oz of cool whip for a 13x9 cake. 8 oz is probably enough.

This cake was very good BUT very very very rich. My mother is a sweet loving, coconut loving person, who can eat a coconut cream pie in a sitting or two but she said this cake was too rich, yummy, but to rich. I think next time I was try only dumping half of the mixture over the cake or something.

EXCELLENT! I did however use only about 2/3 of the milk & coconut sauce as I tought it would be TOO sweet. I made this over the holidays and had family invited for Dinner. The cake lasted that day and that was it! I couldn't believe my eyes. I will make it again and again! Thank you.

This cake is really sweet!  My husband and I enjoyed it.  It was just so sweet that we could only eat a little at a time.  The recipe calls for 16 oz. of whipped topping, but half of that would probably be better.  That way, the cake is more of the focus rather than the whipped topping.  Also, it tasted better the next day, since the cream of coconut and sweetened condensed milk had soaked in more.

Well, I guess I am the minority but I didn't think this cake was that great.
I am wondering if the sweetened condensed milk pushed it over the edge.  Adding the cream of coconut & SCM makes 2 cups of liquid - I feel it was overkill. I may give this another whirl without the SCM.  Sorry folks.

Whenever I bring this to a barbeque or party, I always get rave reviews and am asked for the recipe. Guys especially love this cake. This last time I made it with low fat sweetened condensed milk and I did not notice a difference. I usually do not pour all of the mixture on top because it seems like the cake gets soaked with the first 3/4 of the mixture. GREAT, GREAT, GREAT!!

If you're not a fan of tirimisu, or anything with a mushy, soaked texture, don't make this cake.  I've made poke cakes before with jello, and becuase they firm up, they just taste like super moist cake.  This doesn't firm up. The sweetened condensed milk overwhelms the coconut milk, which is disappointing because I love coconut.   I'll probably look for anther coconut cake recipe.

This is SO good, I stuck with the cream de caco even though I was scared that it would be to sweet. It was very sweet but just right! I also used not fat sweetened condensed milk, and didnt notice a difference. yummmmmmmm....

WOW! This cake was a hit.  I was worried because it seemed like a lot of liquid to load on the top of the cake. But, it is exceptional.  I didn't have cream of coconut, so I used Pina Colato mix instead.. it was delicious..next time I might add the rum to it too!

The only thing I changed was I used coconut flavored cake mix and not quite all the mixture. It was a BIG HIT at a church function! Everyone asked for the recipe.

It had a great taste, and I really liked it, but it was just a tad bit too soggy for me.  I will make it again, but ease up on the liquid a bit.

This is one yummy cake.  I made it for Easter and everyone loved it, especially the kids.  I do think that there is a little too much whipped topping, but other than that it is really good.  It is sweet, but we like it that way!

I made this for a potluck work luncheon and it was the first dessert eaten. Actually, it was gone before most people had a chance to even eat the main course foods. It was just delicious and so easy to make. Thanks for the recipe.
