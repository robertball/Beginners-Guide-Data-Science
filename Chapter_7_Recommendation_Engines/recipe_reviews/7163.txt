With a couple of modifications this is total 5 star bread.  I followed the other reviewers advice and used applesauce instead of shortening.  I had some so why not cut the fat?! I also used 1 full cup of frozen (not thawed) blueberries.  Any fruit bread I make gets a dash of cinnamon, fresh nutmeg and vanilla -just a dash of each.  I used 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar also (personal preference) I baked it in 3 mini loaf pans on a cookie sheet and it still took almost the full cook time. Crunchy on the outside and moist and yummy in the center!  I don't think I would try this bread in a large bread pan, it may have never been cooked through.  My 10 year old ate almost a full tin by himself!  Perfect for a Sunday morning treat!  Thanks

Very moist! I used the applesauce in place of the shortening and decreased the sugar as suggested previously. I also used 1 cup frozen blueberries. I omitted the nuts and added some more oatmeal. My husband and I really like it especially since it is so healthy and delicious at the same time.

I made this while caring for my 5 week old AND making dinner, it was VERY simple!  I used frozen (no need to thaw) blueberries (about 1 cup) and put them in lined muffun tins to decrease the baking time (around 25 min).  They were delicious!

So I prob would give it 5 stars if I hadn't substituted all of the shortening w/apple sauce as other reviewers did. Next time I'll try half apple sauce, half oil - the sauce makes the crust a bit rubbery rather than classic crunchy, it also changes the flavor some. I was trying to be healthy, but some things aren't worth it. I'm going to make it again, and I do think putting the oil back into it will make it an exceptional bread. Very hearty. The only other change I made - well my husband got blackberries instead of blueberries so banana blackberry quick bread it was. I was hestitant at first but the berries held together and came out great in the bread. A nice variation. As for my husband, we are going to go to the grocery store together and review our fruits.

My family loved it.  I liked the way the ingredients were combined.  It seemed lighter than other banana breads, and I like that.  I put in a bit less sugar, as my bananas were rather sweet.  Thank you for this neat recipe!

I've tried several banana bread recipes and this is by far the best! I am not a big fan of banana bread (my husband loves it and I can't bear to let bananas go to waste.) I made a couple of modifications: I doubled the blueberries (fresh), added half t vanilla, used half brown sugar and half white sugar, walnuts (no pecans on hand), used butter in place of shortening, & replaced half the butter with applesauce. I also used quick cooking Irish oatmeal instead of rolled oats...not sure if that makes a difference in flavor in a bread but it came out great!

WOW!  This was one of the best breads I've ever had!  It was moist and delicious, all the ingredients blended together so nicely.  We used butter flavored Crisco for te shortening, which worked well.  The bread lasted less than a day!

Completely delicious over the top and very easy to make. I decided to make them into muffins instead of a loaf and got 22 of them out of this recipe.  I didn't have the quick cooking oats so I used the regular and whizzed them in my mini food processor for a second or two, not to make powder, but a really rough chop. Using others suggestions, I did 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar. I used 3 smaller sized bananas to get to 1 C, and upped the blueberries to 3/4 C. I also added 1/2 tsp each of nutmeg and cinnamon only because I knew I would want these tastes in my quick bread.  I sprinkled a smidgen of raw sugar on top of each prior to baking.  Baking time was 22 minutes and they were a very nice and yummy change from either a blueberry muffin or banana bread. Will definitely make these again.

Changes I made:
*  Used 1/4 cup softened butter and an individual serving cup of unsweetened applesauce instead of the shortening.
*  Used a whole cup of fresh blueberries and maybe 3/4 cup chopped pecans
*  Used 1 cup of all purpose flour plus another whole cup of whole wheat flour (so 2 cups of flour total)
*  Baked for 75 minutes in a glass loaf pan
It came out REALLY well.  Very hearty and dense and filled with nuts and berries.  I don't think it will last long around here!

Great taste - just sweet enough!!!!!!!  I doubled the recipe and baked for 40 minutes in a 9x13 pan.  I used all whole wheat flour and half brown sugar and half large crystal white sugar....as well as a 10-oz drained package of frozen blueberries(not quite double).   I didn't double the salt either.  Thanks for the recipe - will make again!!!!

I WOULD GIVE THIS 5 STARS BUT I MODIFIED MINE. I WOULD GIVE MINE 7 STARS. I JUST DID HALF WHITE SUGAR AND HALF BROWN. THE TOP WAS CRISPY AND THE MIDDLE WAS VERY MOIST. BY FAR THE MOST AMAZING QUICK BREAD I'VE EVER HAD :)

Wonderful recipe!  My family loved these!! Followed ingredient list pretty much as posted except I used instant blueberry flavored oatmeal (only thing I had on hand) in place of the quick cooking oats. I sprayed muffin tin with pam and sprinkled with a mix of cinnamon and sugar.  It added a nice touch.   I made 6 XL muffins and cooked for 25 minutes.     I think next time I will add 1/4 Cup more blueberries and sprinkle the cinn-sugar mix on top too.

I was looking for a good banana bread recipe and I found it!  Very moist and the addition of the blueberries is great!  The only modifications I made were increasing the blueberries to 1 cup (maybe a tad more) and leaving out the pecans.  The blueberries I used were frozen, I just tossed them in some flour and added at the END of the recipe instead of the beginning (so they wouldn't get smashed).  I opted for a muffin tin instead of a loaf pan too.  The recipe easily makes 12 generous sized muffins (I filled the cups at least 2/3 full-not much rising to worry about overflowing).  I will say that I usually don't use shortening in recipes if I can help it, but I didn't have any applesauce so I used the full 1/2 cup and I think it did add to the moisture and texture of the muffins.  I wouldn't hesitate to use shortening again in this recipe!  Thank you, this is a keeper!

My best friend and I both tried this recipe and it did not turn out the way it was supposed to. I followed every step correctly and the bread turned out to be very gooey and sticky. It actually took about an 1 hour and 30 mins for the bread to finish baking. After cooling the bread and slicing I would call this more of a sticky cake and not bread.I love blueberry banana bread and I hope to find a recipe that does work for me.

Wonderful recipe, and I made some substitutions to cut back on sugar and fat:
- replaced shortening with equal amts of applesauce
- used only 2/3 cup sugar
- used walnuts instead of pecans
Really exceptional recipe!!  Thank you.

Another good way to use up some blueberries.  This bread is a little heavier than other fruit breads due to the oatmeal.  It is moist and a great addition to any meal.  I like it best toasted for breakfast.  I made it as written and made 3 mini loaves rather than 1 big loaf.  Thanks MARBALET for sharing your recipe.

VERY good recipe! Turns out very well using apple sauce instead of shortening. I used at least double the blueberries called for and more banana too.

Very good. Definitely decrease the sugar--especially if using applesauce instead of shortening. Added oats and decorating sugar on top for a pretty touch.

Delicious!  I made 12 muffins with this recipe instead of the bread loaf.  I also added 1 teaspoon of vanilla and a teaspoon of cinnamon to the recipe. I  used about 1 cup of frozen blueberries and I made a streusel topping from another recipe. I used chopped walnuts instead of pecans.  These are the best muffins I have ever made!

My family really enjoyed this.  I used mostly whole wheat flour, and didn't use shortening.  I used 1/4 cup of butter, and 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce.  I increased the blueberries too.  I bet this would be great toasted with butter.  The description of this recipe is lots of fun too.  It is indeed a quick bread, isn't it?  And yes, it is moist!

this was really good, though i took so many liberties, largely due to what i had on hand, that i'm going to end up sounding like those "reviewers" that i hate. i had never substituted applesauce for fat before, but thought this might be a good place to try; i doubled the blueberries (i'm not a blueberry fan, but even i could tell that 1/2 c. was not enough!); i put regular rolled outs in the mini processor and chopped them fine; i had ground pecans leftover, so i used them; i used 1/2 brown sugar; high altitude adjustments of 2 T flour and 3/4 t. soda; 12 mini loaf pans for 25 min. 2 1/2 bananas was about right for 1 c. mashed. i'll definitely make this again!

Awesome bread, it was my first time making bread.  I used 1 cup frozen blue berries instead of fresh, 1/2 cup applesauce instead of shortening, omitted the pecans, used 1/2 cup wheat flour and 1 cup ap flour, used 1/2 cup splenda and 1/2 cup sugar.  Just wonderful and tastes healthy, and I know it is to a certain degree!  Hubby loved it too!

Very good and my family loved it!  The only reason I didn't give it a five was because I had to cook it about 15 minutes longer since it came out goey at 55 minutes, 60 minutes, etc.

This turned out really good! I doubled the blueberries and used butter because I had no shortening, but otherwise I kept it the same!  Everybody seemed to enjoy it.  My only problem was how long it took to bake, finally after about 1h15min I took it out, but the center was still a bit wet once I cut it.  Oh well, I kinda like it gooey anyway!

I've made this bread 4x, the last time making two loaves at the same time because people LOVE it.  It is gone within hours of coming out of the oven or being brought into the office.  I use a full cup of fresh blueberries and a full cup of chopped pecans, along with swapping the shortening for applesauce and Splenda for the sugar. Using Splenda significantly reduces the calorie count per serving.  It is also really easy and fast to make.

Very yummy, made 3 2" high loaves which I froze.   That way it's less of a temptation for hubby & I to finish off one large loaf over a weekend!  Added a little cinnamon & vanilla as prev. reviewers suggested, used fresh picked blueberries.  Looking forward to making it this winter whenever I have overripe bananas in the house, and my frozen fresh-picked blueberries in the freezer!

Like other reviewers, I found this recipe to be a bit too much on the moist side and cooked longer than the recipe states to thoroughly bake. While the appearance is not "pretty" (very dark and "lumpy" on top), the taste is WONDERFUL! I used 3/4 cup thawed, frozen blueberries (they were quite large), and they almost over-powered the bananas (good thing I used black-skinned/over-ripe ones or it would have!). I will definitely make it again, but will add an extra 1/2 c. flour to improve the consistancy.

I had 7 black-skinned bananas and blueberries to use up so doubled the recipe.  Only additions were using butter in lieu of crisco, 2 tsp. vanilla and doubled the salt to 1 tsp for 2 loaves.  This bread had a beautiful banana flavor w/the nice surprise of blueberry.  Incredibly light and fluffy; beautiful texture.  baked 2 big loaves and 1 'review muffin'.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe. *muffin baked for 28 minutes in my oven.

This is good and easy. I used oil instead of shortening and didn't use my electric mixer. I used 1 c. blueberries b/c they needed to be used. Added a bit of cinnamon and vanilla, and used half brown sugar. Mine took a about 65 or 70 minutes to bake through.

Like many other people, I made some changes: 3/4 cup fresh blueberries, 1.5 cup flour, 1/4 cup oatbran, 1/4 cup margarine, 1/4 cup pumpkin puree, 2/3 cup sugar, 1/4 tsp allspice, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp banana flavoring. Made 16 muffins. Baked 20 minutes. Very tasty. Banana flavoring brings out the taste of the bananas.

SO good, if I could rate more than 5 stars, I would.  Sub'd applesauce for the shortening, used 1 cup of fresh blueberries, added 1 t vanilla, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, sub'd 3/4 cup white & 3/4 cup brown sugar for the 1 cup white, and used 4 small bananas. Baked 4 mini loaves for 40 mins, should have done at least 45, but it didn't change the taste at all -- and the taste is phenomenal!  I'm loving this as an afternoon snack for my boys - they like the sweetness of it, and I like they are getting whole oats & fruit & don't realize it.  :)  ETA/9/27 - Made this again today b/c I had more bananas & couple of apples that I needed to use - it was fantastic w/ apples in place of the blueberries, as well!  Definitely a KEEPER!

Really nice and easy quick bread!  I used a cup of fresh blueberries and omitted the pecans (allergies) to good effect.  I liberally sprinkled the top with cinnamon sugar, which made a nice crunchy finish.  Give this one a try and it will become a favorite!

Very yummy!  I made a few tweaks to make it healthier.  Subbing plain greek yogurt for the oil and using half brown half white sugar, this came out moist, dense, and amazing!  Applesauce is good, but the yogurt is GREAT!

Superb banana blueberry bread! I used white whole wheat flour for extra fiber, and added some cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla and almond extract.  I also reduced the sugar a little and replaced half the fat with applesauce. The loaves came out moist, with a nice crunchy crust. The flavor is wonderful!

This is the best banana bread recipe I have tried so far on this site.  I was looking to use up some pecans and I had to try this one since it also used blueberries.  I used a cup of frozen that I had let thaw on the counter on paper towels.  I didn't have shortening so I used coconut oil and it was fantastic!  Perfect consistency.  Thank you!

I tried a couple other recipes for banana bread on this site and this one is the bomb! Easy,  moist and delish. I used frozen blueberries and put it in 3 mini loaf pans.  Baked them at 350 for 30 minutes and then turned it down to 325 for about 15 minutes more checking the bread every 5 minutes. GREAT!

This was a huge hit at my house! If you want to make it a bit healthier you can always substitute applesauce for the shortening. Also, I used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar (read that on an earlier review, good idea!). Just to give it a bit more spunk I added nutmeg, cinnamon, and vanilla. Very delish!

Here's my best advice for this bread:  double the recipe!!  The only changes I made were that I used whole wheat flour, added about a teaspoon of vanilla, and substituted the shortening with unsweetened applesauce.  The one thing I will change next time is that I will add less sugar...maybe I got lucky w/ a really sweet banana, or maybe it was the applesauce, but the bread was a bit sweet for my taste.  Will make again 100x!

Quick, easy bread.  The only negative was even after an extra 10 minutes in the oven the center still seemed a bit undercooked.  I made french toast with the bread & it was wonderful! A nice
change from regular french toast.

I normally do not care for banana bread but this is much lighter and the addition of blueberries (no need to thaw) is the icing on the cake.  I do use half butter and half shortening (could not imagine subsituting all applesauce) and decreased sugar by 1/4 c. because it is plenty sweet enough for us.    A nice change in a bread and the creaming method give it a much lighter texture. This is a keeper.

Very good!  I did make a couple small changes.  I used applesauce in place of shortening.  I also used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar.  I am not sure why it is called "quick" bread.  I had to cook mine for over an hour before it was cooked all the way thru.  But it was worth the wait.  Very moist and yummy!

This is the recipe I use EVERYTIME for banana bread!!! Going on... at least 15 times.  There are only two alternatives to this I toy around with - I'll add Ocean Spray Blueberries instead of fresh (it makes it taste fresher longer) & instead of using flour to prepare the pan, I'll use cinnamon sugar.

This is a great recipe with a few modifications! I subbed half a cup of apple sauce plus 1/4 cup oil for the shortening and I used rolled oats because thats all I had on hand and this came out delish!

This was so good.  Very moist and tasty.   I made these into muffins.  I got 14 muffins and I baked them for about 18-19 minutes.  I sprinkled each muffin with cinnamon/sugar mixture before baking - not because they needed it, but because I love it.  I also used oil instead of shortening because I do not use it.  Great recipe - thanks!

Good!  Made one batch as muffins, baked for 23 min. Tried sub. Applesauce for shortening in a loaf, I prefer with shortening, but not bad!  Never tried with pecans, just doubled the blueberries. Yum!

Yum!  I used 1/2 all purpose and 1/2 whole wheat flour, skipped the pecans, 1/2 canola oil and 1/2 applesauce in lieu of the shortening, egg substitute, and an extra small handful of blueberries.  I also added some cinnamon and almond extract.  Very moist and delicious!

SO GOOD!!! I made this with a splash of vanilla, 3 smallish bananas, a carton of fresh blueberries, and walnuts instead of pecans.  I didn't have anything to substitute the shortening, so next time will try it healthier and see if it comes out as amazingly delicious.  My boyfriend doesn't like banana bread, but asked for seconds, and thirds, of this one.

Very tasty and smells great while cooking. We used blackberries, walnuts, and butter instead of blueberries, pecans, and shortening.

This had a wonderful smell while baking and looked beautiful when done!  It also tasted great!  Loved the blueberries and banana together.  I didn't change a thing and wouldn't make any additional changes when making again.  I think it's perfect the way it is.  Thanks!

My first impression of this recipe was that it's really a cake trying to pass itself off as a quick bread -- too much sugar, too much fat.  But I needed a quick remedy for having too few blueberries for my usual muffin recipe and some ripe bananas, so ... I used this recipe as a springboard and came up with some pretty good muffins.  I substituted 3 T of canola oil and 1/2 cup of applesauce for the shortening, cut the sugar in half, and used whole wheat pastry flour and whole oats.  Didn't have any nuts on hand.  Baked them for 20 minutes.  They were still plenty plenty sweet but at least they were more like a muffin than cake.

I just made this, and it's quite delicious. I think next time I'll try substituting the Apple sauce, so it's a little healthier (and I assume you really won't notice in this type of bread?). I also will be adding some Vanilla, and probally some Cinnamon. Overall good base recipe, and I know my daughter (who is 2, and loves all thing blueberry) will love this tommorow morning.

I just made this bread this morning after searching for a recipe to use up my over ripe bananas and blueberries. I used unsalted butter for the shortening. Everything else I did as written. This was excellent! Moist, flavorful and just delicious.

Great recipe. I will apologize in advance b/c I may use some untraditional ingredients.   Spices: I added 1 tsp. vanilla, 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. nutmeg,   Substitutions:  used 1/4 c. applesauce & 1/4 cup butter, used 1 c. fresh blueberries mixed with some cake flour, 1/2 cup brown sugar & 1/2 cup maple sugar, 3/4 cup whole wheat flour & 3/4 cup pastry flour. I added orange rind from 1 orange (use microfine grater - works fantastic!). And I made Mini Muffins.

I used half wheat flour, half white and cinnamon roll instant oatmeal. I also added a little vanilla flavoring. This makes a good sized loaf, so I had to cover it with foil halfway through to keep it from burning. Tasty loaf!

Not a very sweet bread. I cut shortening in half & added cinammon applesauce. Cut down on sugar by 1/4, added tsp of vanilla & more blueberries, as other suggested. Next time, would add all the sugar and a little more applesauce and vanilla. Definitely pulse those oats in a food processor.

I thought this was a pretty tasty recipe-the blueberries add a nice change to regular banana bread. I made a few small changes and simplified the directions and it turned out great. First I mixed all the dry ingredients (flour, oats, soda, and salt) and set aside. Then I creamed the shortening, sugar, and eggs and added the banana. I added the flour mixture next and after that was blended well, I gently folded the blueberries in with a wooden spoon. (I didn't really see the point in coating the berries with flour first?) The only other change I made was that I used a whole cup of blueberries instead of a half. It turned out great!

I read a few reviews before baking this tonight, so I added 1 tsp cinnamon and probably will add a little more next time as well as some vanilla. I didn't have any quick oats, so I used 1/2 C of Hodgson Mill multigrain hot cereal mix which has oats along with flaxseed and other milled grains. Worked beautifully and I will probably continue to substitute with that. I used 1 cup of fresh blueberries, but could have easily used a little less, I just like them. I did the muffins instead of the bread and it worked great - about 25 minutes. Tops were browned and insides were moist. Definitely a good basic recipe that you can experiment with.

This recipe is almost perfect.  I madde a couple of changes.  I ended up using three over ripe bananas.  I used Fat Free sour cream instead of shortening and for the sugar I used 1/4 cup splenda and 1/4 cup brown sugar.  Sometimes I have trouble with my baked goods rising when using splenda but these turned out beautiful and delicious.  I made muffins and baked them at 350 for twenty minutes.  Next time I will add cinnamon though as I forgot to this time.

This was a great recipe and is flexible enough to support improvisation.  I had to make some changes due to items in my kitchen and based on other reviews.  I replaced quick oats with 2 packs of instant oatmeal (maple and brown sugar flavor); omitted the salt; I only had 2 bananas; I added 1 tsp. vanilla, 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. nutmeg, replaced 1/2 c. applesauce for the shortening (great choice), used 1 c. fresh blueberries, didn't have nuts so I used 1/2 c. choc. chips (yum), and baked for about 60 minutes.  The kids went WILD for it after their first bites.  Wonderful texture and intense flavor.  Delicious.  I don't usually like to alter recipes, but this time I had no choice.  Only including my review to show what a great original recipe it is since it could support so many alterations.  For this, it is a 5!!!

I baked this in a 9x5 pan and all the comments about this bread taking longer than 55 minutes to cook are correct. Maybe this is better as a muffin mix with a quicker cooking time. It might turn out moister that way. Thanks!

I was a little concerned with the batter after making the shorening and sugar so fluffy, but it is REALLY GOOD!  I thought that this was an excellent bread.  I have had many many rave reviews with it.

I thought this came out with almost no flavor. The blueberries and bananas somehow trumped each other. It was quite moist but something is missing.

AMAZING - I've never had a banana bread this moist and delicious.  I used one third brown sugar and I added vanilla, cinnamon, and a tiny bit of nutmeg.  The last loaf is still in the oven. (I tripled the recipe) As others have noted, it really is best to make these either in smaller loaf pans or muffin tins.  My large one is very done on the outside and just barely done on the inside.  The taste is incredible.  A winner!!

I had never had (or made) Banana Blueberry Bread before this recipe, so I was a little unsure of what to expect. I was, therefore, pleasantly surprised with the results. This bread turned out moist and delicious. I read the other reviews before making it and decided to use applesauce instead of shortening and it turned out great. I'll be making this again. BTW, I used partially defrosted frozen blueberries. The liquid from the berries mixed into the rest of the batter and spread the blueberry flavor throughout. Great overall recipe!!!

Very tasty!  My husband & I loved it, the 3 yr old wasn't crazy about it but I think he was expecting something different.  
I followed the recipe closely, but I used frozen berries (thawed & drained), walnuts instead of pecans, regular oats and a little fresh ground nutmeg.  I will definetly make this one again!

Excellent fruit bread, a nice departure from banana bread for a seasonal treat adding blueberries. I served it at a party and people ate seconds/thirds and took some home! The changes I made were subbing the shortening required with applesauce, then adding in one teaspoon of shortening; 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup white four, and equal parts white and brown sugar. I got one cup mashed bananas using one small and one medium sized banana. It baked for 55 minutes and was crunchy on the outside, moist on the inside. The oats contribute a hearty tasting crunch. I will make this one again!

Whenever I make banana bread, this is the recipe I use. One thing that I change is that I add blackberries (frozen) along with the blueberries. I have to make at least a double batch because this crunchy on the outside, soft and moist in the middle bread never lasts long!

I made this as a spur of the moment breakfast for my grandson so I made some necessary substitutions.  I used butter instead of shortening, I had overripe bananas in the freezer and used them with the separated liquid after defrosting and since they were so sweet I cut the sugar in half.  I didn't have quick cooking oats so I used old fashioned oats and I used frozen, drained blueberries and doubled the amount.  I did not add nuts.  The end result was a slightly sweet quick bread, sweet enough to eat on it's own but really perfect toasted with butter.  I think next time I would like to try the same recipe but with a moist sweetner like honey or agave as the bread was not dry but I would have preferred just a tad moister...may have had to do with the fact I used regular oats and btw, no one would ever know there were oats in this bread, great way to sneak a healthy grain in for the kids.  The ease of this recipe makes it a keeper!

My, what a fabulous recipe.  I made it just as written.  I had so many over-ripe bananas that I doubled it.  I could only find one loaf pan, so I made one loaf and one tin of muffins.  Both were out of this world with plenty of banana flavor and just the right amount of blueberry.  The nuts gave it a nice little crunch.  I'll say it again--these were fabulous!

I think using frozen blueberries caused this loaf to take too long to bake resulting in overdone edges and a raw centre. I will defrost or use fresh blueberries next ti e to see if that helps. I like the idea of this recipe but it won't be worth saving if it doesn't bake properly.

Very disappointed in this bread. Everyone was saying put applesauce in instead of shortening, so I used both. Went over a bit with the applesauce, but pretty much equaled 1/2 cup. Didn't have nuts, but used everything else. Filled one bread pan to the brim, I should have used 2 smaller pans. Did not bake in 55 minutes. Had to cover the top after over an hour of baking because inside was still raw. I lost track of how long I baked it, 1 & 1/2 hours? When the inside FINALLY cooked, I took it out, let it cool. It was soooo bland. It needed more salt, it has not much taste at all. It had not much flavor at all, all I could taste was the banana! The blueberries don't even taste like blueberries, they might as well have been less expensive raisins because the banana dominated. Putting salted butter on it helped a lot, it was just that bland. Also, the quick oatmeal had some that didn't soften, so they were like little 'watch out for your dental work' rocks!  I don't know what I did that was so different coming out in my oven than the stellar reviews I read on here, but it was a waste of ingredients. Especially very expensive blueberries. Sorry, never again. Maybe I shouldn't have used applesauce and shortening... couldn't taste the applesauce at all, and even after all that cooking time, it was STILL a little raw inside! Very disappointed...:(

This recipe has all that i love! Bananas, blueberries and oatmeal. I halved the recipe, used brown sugar instead of white..decreased the amt, add a little vanilla and made mini muffins instead. And oh,i added some granolas instead of the pecans cos i haven't got any. Very moist and delicious! I will try again with applesauce the next time. Thanks!

I just made this yesterday. I did a double batch. It made one regular loaf and four mini-loaves. It was REALLY good! There are so many banana bread recipes out there, & hard to get one that isn't dry. I think this would be good with or without the blueberries. I had a bag of frozen, which is what I used, & did not thaw them first-just left the bag on the counter until I was ready for them. The only changes I made were tiny - I added 1/4 cup of wheat germ bec it was on the table in front of me (decreased flour by that much), and tossed in some cinnamon. Unlike some, I didn't find it to be dense, so perhaps someone did not cream the ingredients long enough? All thumbs up for this recipe - I'll definitely make this one again! Thanks for sharing! I can't think of a better use for dying bananas! (The mini loaves are gone, and Hubby is taking the big loaf to work for a bake sale. Darn it! No midnight snacking!)

I made a slight change and replaced the shortening with 4 oz of applesauce and 2 TBSP of shortening. It was slightly on the dry side, but it seemed to have overcooked a bit. My other criticism is that it did not have a strong banana or blueberry flavor. If I make this again I might add more banana. I think it is worth tinkering with a bit to find the right mix of ingredients.

Very good bread. It is a dense bread with rich flavor.  I doubled the recipe and it worked out just fine.  I used frozen blueberries (1-1/2 cups) and an extra 2 TBSP flour for high altitude - we're at 5200 feet - and lowered the temp to 325 half way through the baking. Perfect!

I read someone else said this was a very moist bread. I actually had a bit of trouble getting it baked just right, I found the outside was getting a bit dark while the toothpick was still coming out gooey. Delicious taste though! I am a novice baker, so it may have just been my technique!

The bread is very good, but the blueberries still ended up mostly on the bottom. I baked this bread without the sugar, so it was barely sweet.

Great recipe! I made a few modifications upon reading other reviews. Increased blueberries to 1 cup, used ww flour, instead of shortening i used half greek yogurt and half applesauce. I also made these into muffins instead of bread loaf. Delicious!

This recipe was OK, but I didn't find it to have much taste (I even added a little cinnamon and vanilla to the batter). It also took nearly 90 minutes to cook and I had to turn the oven down to 300 after the first 50 minutes to keep it from burning. May try one more time making it into muffins and maybe adding a little nutmeg, but this won't likely be on my favorites list.

Really really yummy loaf, I added cinnamon and vanilla just as a matter of personal taste and used margarine instead of shortening. It came out really good, my only complaint would be that it is not quite bananaey enough.

Very moist & great for breakfast.  I doubled the recipe and made 2 loaves since I knew my kids would eat a whole one by themselves.  Since I used frozen blueberries, I added 2 full cups (to the doubled recipe) and I used slightly less sugar since my bananas were very ripe & sweet.  I didn't have ay pecans, so I used walnuts and the flavor is nice, but I think I'll leave the nuts out altogether next time.  I used 6 bananas, and I think it was equal to 3 cups mashed.  The baking time was exactly 50 minutes.  :)

This banana blueberry bread was really good, it came out sp light and tasty. I doubled the recipe, and it made 2 large loaves. This will do so good for one for the mailman and one for my grandson. I give it 5 stars.

This is a typical banana bread (a bit sweet for my taste). The blueberries are lost in the banana. Good but not great.

We love this recipe!!! Made muffins (24) yesterday and between snack and breakfast almost gone.  I add 1 cup of blueberries as we love them so much.  Substituted 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 apple sauce for shortening, also did 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown.  It kind of has a maple flavor now. Oh, is it good!! I used 2 cups flour plus the 2 tablespoons of flour for flouring the blueberries.  It is very moist and delicious!!

Awesome recipe.  Used butter for shortening and ample bananas and nuts.  Cooked for ~65 mins, though, and still a little gooey in the center

Delicious and easy to make. I followed the recipe as directed, except for replacing the shortening with applesauce. I will definitely make this again!

Yummy! Loved it so much I had to get back here to rate it. Made small alterations as many @home cooks like to do. I can't wait to make it again and bring it along with me to a church social.

Pretty good...I made the healthier version like many reviews and thought it was fine.  I also made muffins to decrease baking time.  My 4 year old loved them and my 2 year old thought it was "okay"...good HEALTHY recipe (which I'm always looking for) Thanks!!

This was very good even with some "healthy" changes. I used extra blueberries, half whole wheat flour, and applesauce in the place of shortening. No one in my family even noticed the changes. Great recipe!

Awesome!  Will definately make agian, next time I plan on trying with applesauce instead of the shortening.  I took advice from other reviewers and upped the blueberries to 1 cup and cut the sugar to 3/4 cup.  I did not have enough pecans so I used walnuts.

This bread is so good.  I used applesauce instead of shortening & also reduced the sugar.  I used 1 cup of frozen bluberries.  Cook time was more like 1 hour 15 minutes.  I took it to a family get together & everyone wanted the recipe.

Made this today and was not completely happy with it. I made 3 mini loaves rather than 1 large since so many members mentioned the problem with it cooking in the middle. I increased the blueberries to 3/4 C. and used butter flavored crisco. I used splenda for half the sugar and the splenda brown sugar blend for the other halfand added 1/2 t. vanilla and a few dashed of cinnamon. When I finished mixing it all up the batter was extremely thick so added a little over 1 T. of sour cream which helped a bit. Rather than using flour for the pans, I sprayed them with pan spray and then dusted them with a mixture of cinnamon and splenda, gives a nice sugary crispness to the bottom and they come out of the pan very well.  I love banana bread and love blueberries and while this was ok, it didn't blow me away. If I try it again I think I would decrease the oats and possibly use buttermilk to make a thinner batter.

I made this just as recipe is. The middle took a long time to cook, the outside and top are way too brown.The flavor was good,but too dry. Next time, I will add vanilla and cinnamon to it also. It needs something for extra moisture. I'm a lover of moist breads. Overall ok.

I found the bread to be heavy-maybe it is the oatmeal.  It did have a nice flavor-but not the best banana bread-won't make this again.

It was so good, I just made a second loaf a few days later...with a few changes. I used butter instead of shortening, used a packet and a half of organic cinnamon and spice instant oatmeal, added a little vanilla and cinnamon, used walnuts instead of pecans and cut the amount of sugar in half (used organic unbleached cane sugar).

The whole family liked this.  It had great flavor and texture.  However, it took quite a bit longer to bake than was stated in the recipe.  I added a touch of vanilla, and I used old-fashioned oats instead of quick.  I put the oats and pecans in the food processor and pulsed until they were coarsely ground.  Most of my kids won't eat nuts, but they don't even know they're in it this way.  It may have contributed to the longer cooking time, though.  All in all, it's a great recipe, and I'm sure I'll be making it again.

I have made this bread twice now and both times it did not cook in the middle. So I just kept cooking away which gave us a burnt top and still uncooked middle.  :(

The best bread I've ever made!  I took one reviewers advice and added a little cinnamon and cloves, and also added about 2 T. of cream, b/c the batter was really thick... it turned out delicious!  My husband even loved it and he's hard to please.  Thanks for the great recipe- will make again, for sure!

I didn't have any shortening, so I substituted 1/2 cup of blueberry (no sugar added) applesauce.  It was delicious with this!  I also took the suggestion of another reviewer and added a dash of cinnamon and a dash of vanilla to the applesauce (shortening) before adding the sugar, eggs & banana.  I used 1/3 cup brown sugar & 2/3 cup of white sugar.  I baked muffins (25 min.) and mini-loaves (30 min.)  Bread came out golden brown around the edges and very moist.  Thanks for sharing such a yummy recipe!  My 2 year old daughter loves it! :)

This quick bread recipe is superb! Very moist and tasty. I made a couple of modifications (per other reviewers); i.e. substituting 1 cup white whole wheat flour and the rest all-purpose flour, doubled the bananas (very ripe, organic), 1 cup frozen blueberries, 1/4 c. sugar, 1/2 cup butter, and 1 tsp vanilla. The sweetness of the bananas more than made up for the reduced sugar. This one will be made over and over again!

I made a few adaptations. I used 1/2 c applesauce instead of shortening. I added 3/4 tsp vanilla and 3/4 tsp cinnamon. I also used 1 cup frozen blueberries (not thawed). Once the batter was ready, I made 16 muffins which I cooked for 20 minutes. I still had some batter left over, so I added 2 fresh lilikoi (passionfruit) and 1/2 c walnuts. Then I baked this new concoction in a small square cake pan for about 28 minutes. I know the lilikoi variety came out DELICIOUS because I tried it. The muffins disappeared before I had a chance to try them, but I got a "thumbs up" when I asked how they were- since they disappeared overnight by my boyfriend, I'd have to say they were probably quite tasty. The recipe was easy and I will use it again. Thanks!

This recipe was wonderful. I had no nuts in the house so I doubled the oats. Replaced shortening with applesauce as others did. Cooked for an hour and it was perfect.

Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly as it is here and the results were great. Both husband and I loved it! 

In his words: "It's like eating a giant muffin!"

Yummy! Added a boost of fiber by making the flour equal parts white and whole wheat.

Yum! I was going to just add some blueberries to the banana bread recipe I usually make, but am very glad I decided to branch out and try this one. I changed a few things to make it healthier (used part wheat flour and subsituted applesauce for some of the shortening), and it turned out so good. I will be making this again trying different fruit combination...I'm thinking peach chunks mixed in with the blueberries would be awesome. Oh, also, I made a triple batch and made two loaves and 12 muffins.

I've just started trying out different recipes for quick breads, and this is the best one I've made so far. I used applesauce instead of shortening, but I otherwise followed the recipe. It came out sweet and delicious, with a yummy, gooey crust. I'll definitely make this one again!

This was a pretty good recipe but not what I was looking for. It turned out very hearty with the oatmeal and pecans but the baking time/temp needs some adjusting. It browned way more on the outside than I like before it finished baking inside. I covered it with foil for the last 20 minutes because I was afraid it would burn. I am not sure I would make again without some revising.

This is good; better the day after it has baked (moister and more flavourful). My only 'complaint' is that I couldn't really taste the blueberries (I used almost 1 cup). Banana was the prominent flavour. It took 65 minutes to bake. I may or may not make it again.

I used butter-flavored shortening, whole-wheat flour, and walnuts because it's what I had on hand. Next time I'll probably add more blueberries. This turned out delicious and I'm sure I'll be making it again in the future. It's great for breakfast or as an afternoon snack, and it's healthy too.

The best fruit-type bread I've ever tasted!!  I put in butter instead of shortening and raw sugar instead of white sugar.  I've made lots of diffrent banana breads and this is far the best!

This bread is very good, but didn't cook through. The batter is a little too wet and/or dense. Next time I'll add an extra 1/2 cup of flour.

I made this as written, though I used whole wheat flour instead of white.  I'm trying to get my kids to eat stuff that is good in taste, yet somewhat healthy for them.  They thought this bread was ok, but 3/4 of the loaf is still on the counter.

This is an awesome recipe!!  My family loves banana bread and blueberry muffins, and this was a great combination of those two flavors!  The bread was gobbled up quickly!  This recipe is great as is, however upping the blueberries to 1 cup made it blueberrier!  Thanks Holly...this is a keeper!

This bread was really good!  It went fast at the workplace!  Only complaint is that due to the oatmeal and the pecans, the top came out bumpy(the inside too), so it wasn't very pretty.  Other than that, it was really enjoyed.  I added just over a cup of blueberries.

this bread is moist & absolutely delicious. i used a heaping cup of blueberries, old fashioned oats instead of the quick cooking variety & substituted 1/4 c. of the all purpose flour with whole wheat flour. note: the recipe alterations increased my baking time to 70 minutes. thanks holly, this one's a keeper!

EXCELLENT!  I loved this bread and so sorry it's gone now.  I took someone's advice and used more blueberries.  I also dredged them in whole wheat flour.  I doubt it made much of a difference though.  Thanks!

Instead of blueberries, I used some frozen raspberries I found in the freezer and it worked out very nicely. I divided the batter in half and made two small loaves, each the perfect serving size for a family of four.  This bread is quick, tasty and my family loved it!

It was moist and easy to make...but for some reason my loaf turned out dark on the bottom (like a spice cake) but light on top (like it should be). It was baked on the top half of my oven and I've never had this issue with other banana bread recipes. I'll see if it happens again the next time I make it.

Followed the recipe exactly as is. I did have to cook it about 12 minutes longer until the center was done. By then, the outside was overdone. I wouldn't use this recipe again.

I used half brown and half white sugar, also I like to use some whole wheat flour in my banana bread so used  1 C white and 1/2 C whole wheat. I omitted nuts as hubby hates them.  Very good!

I made it exactly as prescribed. I loved the flavour, but found it a little too moist. I will probably use a longer thinner pan, or separate it into two loaves next time.

This was very good!  I doubled the recipe as I had 5 very ripe bananas and a pint of blueberries.  I used a heaping cup of oats, regular not quick.  Did not add nuts.  A splash of vanilla.   I made 3  (8x4) loaves that cooked at 53 min.  Made one big muffin for the cook!  Done in 30 min.  Delicious!  So far, everyone loves this!  I love the combo of flavors with the heartiness of the oatmeal. It will go into my book of faves!  Thanks so much for the recipe.

This is an excellent recipe. I made muffins rather than a loaf. Plus I only had about 3/4 cup of bananas and the muffins turned out just fine. I’ll be baking these again.

A friend shared a loaf of this banana blueberry quick bread.  It was wonderfully moist and flavorful.  When asked, she said she followed the recipe without modification.  
I live at 4660 feet above sea level.  My first attempt at making this recipe,  I followed the directions (with the exception of raisins in lieu of blueberries)... no high altitude adjustments, whatsoever.
I had trouble with it collapsing and not baking the center properly.  But the flavor was great.
Today, my second attempt, I totally converted the recipe by every trick I know for high altitude baking.  Ingredient amounts were adjusted (flour increased & baking soda decreased), sugar and shortening were replaced with corn syrup and extra virgin olive oil and oven temperature was increased to 375°F.  After a full 55 minutes, the bread was beautiful... perfectly raised with an even texture throughout, moist and tender.  DELICIOUS.

Took suggestion and substituted 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce for shortening and stevia for sugar. Took longer to cook (about 65 min) and it was great. Grandkids loved it too.

I'm giving it 5 stars because even though it's cooked all the way through it's a bit more crumbly then I like.  I'd like a bread that I can lift the whole slice with out it breaking.  I tripled the recipe to make 3 loaves.  They took more like 45 minutes to cook.  Maybe I took it out too soon but I'm so afraid of burning the crust and my fork was coming out clean.  Will make again.  I added "Jan's Crumb Topping."

One of the best banana breads that I like. I'm not a big banana fan. Love the blueberries and oatmeal in it. I used 1/2 cup of sugar vice the 1 full cup and still tasted great.

I was looking for a recipe to use up my bananas and blueberries. I have always been hesitant to try a new banana bread because my mom spoiled us with her recipe. This is actually pretty close. The blueberries were a nice addition and the men-folk loved it too!

I made 6 small loaves with just this recipe, not doubled.  I also used butter Crisco so there would be a slight buttery flavor. One person suggested adding Vanilla and Cinnamon, so I did this as well.  I have had nothing but praise on this bread.  This is a keeper!

I used margarine, instead of shortening. Like others, I did not thaw the blueberries, and I threw in an extra cup full. Quadrupling the recipe yields about seven dozen muffins. I had to turn my oven down about 25 degrees and baked for 25 minutes. Then, perfecto!

Very good bread. Next time I'll try the applesauce instead of the shortening and use some bananas that are more ripe than what I used.

For anyone who would prefer to stick closer to the recipe, I made it as is with the only substitution being butter instead of crisco.  It turned out absolutely delicious.  Also I did bake a 9x5 loaf for about 53 minutes and I also baked a second batch using 5 mini loaf tins for about 33 minutes which turned out great

I followed the recipe exactly as written.  I baked the bread exactly as stated.  The bread didn't rise causing the outside and ends to be done, but the inside remained doughy.  I have never had this happen before in bread.  The ends were baked so I tasted that part and it had great flavor.  If all of the bread would have turned out that way, then it would definitely be a 5 star for me.  I may try again with some personal adjustments.

SO good!  Didn't have shortening so used unsalted butter.  Left out the other 1/4 tsp salt as well and the nuts.  This is my new favorite banana bread receipe - throwing away all the others!

amazingly delicious! easy and moist, just perfect. i love how there are oats in it. i personally don't care for a lot of sugar, so i cut it in half and it was still great. I also added vanilla (suggested by other reviewers) and a touch of lemon to bring out the sweetness of the blueberries,which made this beyond a 5 star recipe. thanks marbalet for posting it!

Made this per my 4 year old daughters request for a blueberry and banana cake....lol.  Turned out really nice.  I did substitute applesauce for the shortening and used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 reg sugar but these are all normal for me.  I usually try to make things a bit healthier if I can since it is mostly my 2 and 4 year old eating them.

Like everyone else it seems I added something to this recipe.  1/4 tsp cinnamon and 1/8 tsp nutmeg.  I was just shy 1 cup sugar so I added about 1/3 cup brown sugar...not packed however.

Love this bread. I did use applesauce for the lower fat version. I usually only give 5 stars if I follow recipe exactly as written, but for this I made an exception. Like it that much!

Not that spectacular, really. I used applesauce instead of shortening, as others suggested, and the edges were rubbery. I did not need any extra cook time, as 55 mins at 350 was almost too long for the loaf- I removed it right from the pan so it would not continue to cook the extra 10 minutes suggested. I was disappointed, definitely have had better.

This is a great bread recipe and really forgiving.  I ran out of everything while making it and it still made a great loaf.  I made it in a breadmaker using the cake setting (I was worried it wouldn't cook through but it did and it was moist and delicious, whew!),  To show how forgiving this bread is: I didn't have oats so I added a half cup of Swiss Muesli (containing dates and raisens along with oats, concerning but it actually tasted good in the end), I ran out of walnuts while filling the measuring cup and so I added almond flour to come to 1/2 cup.  I added half butter and half oil due to butter shortage, and I cut down a bit on the sugar because I was worried about adding so much, it was still good, but I honestly think it would have been great with full sugar amount, it wasn't at all too sweet I did half brown, half white and a touch of honey.  I also added 1 cup of frozen blueberries (completely frozen at beginning of cycle), along with a teaspoon of vanilla, and ran a bit short of flour, no kidding, that one scared me.  So if it can take those last minute changes and still be really good bread, there is a lot of flexibility there.  I will make this again and again.

I am always trying to find new healthy snacks for my kids, while using up extra fruits and vegetables.  I made these into muffins and they turned out great.  I used 1/2 cup oil instead of shortening (it was a light olive oil/canola mix) and frozen blueberries.  I didn't thaw the blueberries, just ran them under warm water for a second to get rid of the frost.  I also used 2:1 whole wheat to all purpose flour, 1:1 white sugar to brown sugar and replaced the pecans with extra oats.  I baked them for 25 minutes, as suggested by another reviewer.  I will definitely be making these again.

I've made this twice now. Substituted 1/4 C applesauce and 1/4 C butter for the shortening. It came out great! I've also used 1/2 C white sugar and 1/4 C spenda brown sugar and there was no difference in taste. This last time I doubled the recipe to make 2 loaves, and used 3 eggs plus 1 egg white. Came out fine. Excellent way to use up those older bananas.

As always I changed everything in this recipe and it still was delicious. Doubled blueberries, used 1 cup flour (didn't have whole wheat) 1/2 cups ground flax, almonds, sprinkle cinnamon, dash vanilla, two small single containers of applesause rather than shortening and Splenda white. I made mini muffins 350 for 10 minutes. They had a yummy nutty flavour to them next time I will try 1/2 white Splenda, 1/2 Brown Splenda, and add another few banana's. I can only imagine how wonderful the origianl recipe is. Thanx for sharing. This is a keeper:)

This bread was awesome! I did make some changes: 1 cup of blueberries 2 cups of flour 1 cup oats 1/2 cup pecans 1 1/2 teaspoon baking soda no salt 1 pureed apple (peeled) instead of the shortening 1/2 cup sugar instead of the full cup 3 eggs 2 pureed bananas  Same preparation directions should be followed.  It made the recipe soooooooo much healthier and it tasted great!

This was very good. I only had 1 banana, so I added enough applesauce to make 1 cup. It ended up being about 1/2 cup each. I also added 1 tsp. of vanilla.

I really wanted to like this recipe because I love blueberries and bananas.  But unfortunately these two flavors were not meant to be.  And the texture of the oats was not quite the quick bread I am used to.  Very easy to make though and the only reason I gave it three stars is because of my own personal preferences.

This was really good and I really goofed it up, the Lord only knows how it managed to turn out so well. :) I made these into muffins, substituted milk instead of eggs and couldn't whip the butter due to a sleeping husband. These looked gross going in and didn't rise a lot but taste so good, I'd definitely make this again and do it correctly! :)

Excellent banana bread! As some other reviewers said I also substituted applesauce for the shortening, slightly less than a cup of sugar, a dash of cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla, wheat germ, and flax seed. My 20 month old gobbled his piece up and asked for more!

I just got done making this bread, and I love it! It looks like its going to be dry on the outside but inside its very moist. The only thing I did differently was instead of shortening I added one stick of margarine, (personal taste preference). I also added some vanilla extract for some extra flavor. And I didn't have pecans on hand so I chopped up some walnuts instead. Very good...Thanks!

This bread is excellent.  Not too sweet and VERY MOIST - I expect it to still be moist even after a couple of days (it will probably freeze very well too).  I used 4 overripe bananas and used applesauce instead of shortening as per many of the other reviews.  Bread doesn't rise very much but that's okay.  Try toasting this bread - absolutely excellent.  Oh, and I also added about 1/2 tsp of both cinnamon and nutmeg and 1 tsp of vanilla.  Think I will add a full tsp of cinnamon and nutmeg next time for an extra bit of flavor.

I thought this turned out really moist. I used Splenda instead of sugar and added a heaping cup of blueberries. I also substituted half of the shortening with unsweetened applesauce. Thanks for the great recipe! I will definitely be making this again! I did not have any problem with the inside being undercooked and baked for a total of 65 minutes.

Oh my - this is definitely a keeper. Unbelievable flavor, very moist, not too dense - simply wonderful! I made a few changes: 1. used canola oil instead of butter, 2. used 1 cup fresh blueberries instead of frozen ones, 3. Omitted the nuts, 4. used 3/4 cup turbinado sugar instead of white sugar, and 5. added 1tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp allspice. I chose to make muffins which took about 25 minutes to bake and came out nice and brown and oh-so-tasty!

Awesome!!  I modified the recipe slightly to suit my personal preferences (added some vanilla/ cinnamon, half white/half brown sugar, and extra blueberries in place of the pecans), but I have no doubts that it would still be wonderful without modifications.  Super yummy!  Will definitely make again!

I made these as mini muffins and halved the sugar and shortening to make them a bit healthier.  Also used egg whites instead of whole eggs because that is what I had.  My 2 boys can't get enough of them!

I made 2 different kinds of Blueberry Banana Bread.  I had only 1 slice of this one & by far love it better than the other & I thought it was good. This bread has substance to it & is great in the morning with coffee as well as in the evening with tea.  A definite keeper.

Good recipe!  We bake a lot of quick breads, and I wanted to try something just a little different, so I liked the oats and blueberries added to this banana bread.  I did use frozen, and only left them out on the counter until I was ready to use them, as I was worried if I microwaved them, they would be too moist and take up too much flour when I dredged them.  I did leave out the pecans (family nut allergy) and substituted a 1/2 c of coconut oil (which is like a solid, even at room temp) for the shortening, as that's something we don't eat.  Thanks for the recipe; it's a keeper!

I substituted the shortening with applesauce.  I did half of the sugar as regular white sugar and the other half as brown sugar.  I also added cinnamon, ginger and a splash of almond extract.  I used 1 cup of fresh blueberries.  I ended up using a muffin tin that makes 6 extra large muffins instead of making a loaf.  It's super tasty and a beautiful way to use those fresh picked Michigan blueberries!

Gone in 1 day. I used low fat sour cream instead of shortening(didnt have any) and it tasted really good.  Not to mention it looked pretty, my hubby thought I bought it from the bakery.  I condider that a compliment since I'm not the best baker.

What a great recipe!  I followed the others advice and used applesauce and 1/2 white, 1/2 brown sugar.  It made 12 muffins and a small loaf.  Definitely a keeper!

I used applesauce instead, and skipped the nuts in favor of additional oatmeal. I used three over-ripe bananas and one full cup of fresh blueberries. I cooked it without liners in muffin tins. It was very moist bread, but could have used more sugar. Next time I'll up the sugar and use wheat flour to make it a healthier breakfast bread.

This bread was very tasty. I wanted to keep eating it, but must learn self control. I used 1/2 brown sugar & 1/2 white. NExt time I'm going to try it using whole wheat pastry flour to make it a little more healthy. Thanks for a tasty recipe!

To Die For!  I used 1 cup fresh blueberries, omitted the pecans, and used 1/2 cup of both brown and white sugar.  I also added a sprinkle of both nutmeg and cinnamon and a dash of vanilla extract.  I cooked these as muffins at 350 degrees for approximately 25 minutes.  They were the best!

I wasn't sure about the cornbread and zucchini idea, but after tasting the end product, it was really good.  I only cooked it for 50 min, but it really needs a full hour to set the cornbread up.  Also cover the dish with aluminum foil at the start of cooking and remove it for the last 10min.  That way the cheese doesn't burn or get too hard.  Overall, would definitely make it again, and maybe add some bacon or smoked ham.

I, like a few others, had trouble getting the middle to cook so I left it in for a full 50 minutes and the bottom was stuck and it came out a mess - still tasted good and I used it to layer a trifle with vanilla yogurt and blueberries - does anyone have a clue what may have gone wrong?

This had great flavor; like other reviewers I used half brown sugar, half white, and added a dash of vanilla and cinnamon.  I had some trouble getting it fully cooked in the middle making for dry ends, but the middle was nice.

This was very disappointing..I did not like the hard pieces of the cooking oats..I assumed the oats would dissolve and just give flavor but on the contrary, I was biting are hard pieces of the oats..not pleasant. It tasted like there was too much flour in it too.  Didn't love this recipe and won't make it again.

Tasted great but started getting too dark before middle was done so I had to take it out early.  I would have lowered temp on oven and baked longer had I known...

I was sooooo looking forward to this, but I was a little disappointed in it.  I thought it was just a little bland.  Good, but not great.  I might make it again, using cinnamon applesauce instead of the shortening, just for a little extra flavor.

This recipe is really delicious.  I didn't have pacans so I used almonds and cashews, as well as added vanilla (it makes the world go round). To finish is sprinkled the top before baking with sugar. It gives it a bakery feel. Yum!

Moist, delicious & easy. I didn't use any pecan so I  increased the oats. I don't like sugar sweet stuff so I used only 1/4 cup of sugar & 1 cup of frozen blueberries. I used sunflower oil instead of shortening, and sprinkled chopped almond on top prior to baking. Turned out great, hubby loves it! Thank you for the recipe - this one's a keeper.

Yummy!  I just made a few changes.  Added 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar.  Also added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg.  Instead of vanilla I added 1 tsp almond extract.  It gave it a lovely almond flavor that complemented the banana nicely.  I also added 1 cup of blueberries.  Delicious!

Very good! I made a few changes though...cut the shortening to 1/4 cup and used 2 extra bananas (which made it 5 bananas in total). That made it lower in fat but it didn't taste like a "lowfat" loaf. I also used toasted slivered almonds which were very good. Will make this again!

This was really, really good and moist.  Unfortunately, I didn't have nuts on hand but added a little extra oatmeal. I'll try applesauce in place of shortening next time as other reviewers have done.

I made this with my 11 y/o and 2 y/o and it was so much fun to make with them. We had a piece for dessert and it is so moist and delicious!
I used applesauce instead of shortening, and took everyone elses advice and added vanilla, nutmeg and cinnamon. BUT instead of putting in a pan I made it inmy 7-1/2" diameter bunt pan-cooked it for 40 mins and then checked with toothpick. I could have kept it out but I put it back in for 10 minutes more just in case and it came out YUMMY!

This is an excellent quick bread! The banana flavor is just right, and the blueberries add a delicious tang. I used dried blueberries, which I soaked in hot water for 15 min then drained well and added last. .... My only problem was that the baking time is understated. I kept adding 10 min again and again, for a total of at least 90 min. The top was getting too brown by that time, but it's good eating though not so pretty.

This was fantastic!!  I baked it in muffins instead of a loaf, just because it's easier for my kids to handle.  The taste is fabulous!

Very good breakfast bread. I used 1/2 brown 1/2 white sugar and it turned out nicely. I will make this again and next time wont skimp on the walnuts.

Just okay for me. I did like the interesting texture from the oatmeal. I doubled & made one regular loaf & four mini loaves. The mini loaves turned MUCH better. Like other reviewers', my regular sized loaf was way OVERdone by the time the center was BARELY done. The blueberries seemed more like an afterthought - barely noticed their flavor.  That was disappointing because they were the reason I tried the recipe in the first place.  I doubt I'll make it again.

Like many of the other reviewers, I found it very difficult to get the cake to bake through.  It was too moist and didn't have much flavor.

I'm rating this a three because it was just OK. Like others have said, it took forever to bake and turned out very moist. It'd definitely edible but not my favorite for some reason.

This bread is ok.  Personally I think this recipe has too much fat (shortening) in them & it browns much faster than it cooks even with a foil cover.  I love the blueberry, walnuts, oats & banana combination but the basic bread recipe is flawed.  Next time I will combine those items into a different quick bread recipe - thanks for the inspiration!

I used applesauce like others suggested.  Since everyone was complaining over the bake time, I decided not to put all the batter in the pan.  It still had to bake for 1 hour.  This is pretty good, but it's not out of this world.  I don't know if I would waste my fresh blueberries on this recipe again, but it will get eaten.

Even though this recipe has more ingredients than I usually use, it is well worth it. The oatmeal adds so much. Frozen blueberries are available all year around so that's no excuse for not making this.

Taste was great but appearance was not the best.  Baked for about 55 minutes and it was very brown on outside yet the center was still soft.  Would still make again though.

I've been burned by a few of the 5 Star recipes but this was very good! I also used butter and a few extra blueberries.  

I used the conversion option so it would double the recipe for me...the list of ingredients came out fine but the directions only showed half of the flour. BE SURE to check when you do a conversion. I'm a 'dump and stir' cook but made sure I followed the steps for this one...it came out moist and delicious!

Will use again...

This turned out to be a nicely flavored bread with both the banana and blueberry being pretty balanced. I only had one egg so I added a bit more banana and more blueberries (cause I like 'em) and left out the nuts. I had to keep it in the oven for 70 minutes, but the loaf came out pretty good with a very cakey texture. I couldn't notice the oatmeal in it, but it was a pretty dense loaf. Very good, would probably be good with some cinnamon in it too.

I absolutely love this recipe!  So easy!  I just made it and my house smells wonderful!  I used mini loaf pans instead of one big one, which cut the cooking time down to 25 minutes.  I will definitely be making this again!

I substituted Splenda for the sugar and Smart Balance for the shortening; threw in some Cardamom and ginger, increased the blueberries to a cup and added 2 T of honey.  My kitchen smells wonderful.  The bread is very fluffy.  I'm very excited to try this.  Thank you for the inspiration Holly.

Absolutely delicious.  I however did make a few adjustments:  I omitted the pecans as I didn't have any and I added a 1/4 tsp of vanilla to the wet mixture.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe Holly.  Will definately make again.

Cons: Not moist enough, kind of crumbly and not sweet enough

Pros: Tastes good with some extra honey. Good breakfast kind of bread.

Forget letting it cool completely - slice it up and eat the whole loaf warm! Yum Yum! I used 1 cup frozen blueberries and increased the baking time to compensate. Might also add some vanilla and nutmeg next time.

Omitted nuts, and added more oatmeal and blueberries as suggested.  Used a little lemon juice, and less sugar, to help with the extra ripeness of the bananas.  With a touch more salt, to balance the oatmeal, this recipe is easy and yummy.

I usually increase the blueberries to a full cup and make muffins (baking for 25 minutes).  This has been a family favorite for years.
