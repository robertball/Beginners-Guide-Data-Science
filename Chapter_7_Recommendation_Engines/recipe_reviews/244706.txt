I've made this  3 times with a few changes to make it easier but used the same ingredients.  I put the florets, garlic and about 1/2 cup chicken broth in microwave safe glass casserole dish large enough for florets to fit in..  I cooked it on high until it was  tender and then removed the florets and garlic with a slotted spoon and mashed it, gradually adding the broth it was cooked in, as needed to make it a good consistency. Then added the cheese and mixed well adding reserved warmed  broth (3/4  cup) as needed. I only used 1 cup of broth total but its according to preference. It heats up well if there are leftovers.

This dish was so good I should have doubled up on the recipe.  Next time for sure.  Family loved it!  One thing I'd like to try next time is adding crispy bacon crumbs in the mix at the end.  Now THAT would make it out of this world even though it was pretty amazing already, but with bacon...Oooooooo the thought! :o)

Easy and quick to prepare in the Swanson Broth.  I added salt and pepper and a touch of sour cream and pureed using a hand blender.  My husband thought it was great!

This was good.  I poured off most of the cooking broth before mashing, added pepper and a drop of heavy whipping cream, topped with extra parmesan and baked in the oven for 30 minutes on 250 to try to cook off the extra liquid that you get with many cauliflower mash recipes.  I've never understood those reviews (on other sites) where people say their guests were fooled into thinking this was mashed potatoes.  It tastes like what it is, and it's good.  I found myself looking up how many carbs in 2 cups of cauliflower because that's how much of it I ate!

This was super easy & delicious!  I had never made mashed cauliflower before, but it truly is like the consistency of smooth mashed potatoes.  I added extra garlic (we love it in our house!) and made it the day before, which further infused the garlic flavor into the dish!  Definitely a keeper, and I can't wait to make a triple batch ahead of time to freeze into individual portions for even faster access to what will now be a regular side dish during those hectic weekday school nights.  :)

This was delicious! I used a Parmesan, Asiago, Pecorino blend from Trader Joe's instead of just grated Parmesan...it was a great choice.

Simple and easy side dish to make. Not completely kid friendly but my kids ate it with minimal complaints. my husband and I on the other hand liked it a lot. I used the unsalted broth and seasoned with a sprinkle of salt and pepper and extra parm on top.

Sorry I didn’t like this. I used less broth and it was still too soupy. I didn’t like the taste initially either so I added some cream cheese, fresh black pepper, and more parmesan. It improved it, but I wouldn’t make this again.

It was super easy!  I added some pesto dip to add some zip...though it still needs a little something that I haven't figured out yet.  I will definitely make this again, though.

So tasty! Great replacement for mashed potatoes! I used 1 head of cauliflower, 5 cloves of garlic and one shallot. Mine turned out to be watery (but absolutely delicious!) so next time I will not use as much chicken broth. Also, I am dairy free so did not even use the cheese or butter.  Yum!!

I’ve made this over and over again. I use less chicken both and good quality Parmesan cheese. A cheap cheese will not give you the desired results.

I made a version of this and it was delicious. I didn't have Parmesan so that was omitted. I drained most of the remaining stock before mashing, then added butter and two large spoonfuls of sour cream and topped with chives. I'll try it with Parmesan next time, I'm sure it will only get better.

Very good! I added only a cup of chicken broth at the suggestion of other users.  Even one cup made it a bit soupy.  Poured part of the liquid out. Also added sour cream at the end.  A low carb delight!  I might add fresh rosemary next time to give it more flavor.

this recipe was ok, needs some tweaks. I had to drain a lot of liquid off of the cauliflower and add a lot of extra cheese. I would definitely suggest using a ricer or blender to get a smooth consistency. Overall I just felt that it was missing a punch of flavor

This was just okay for us. It was easy to prepare, but needed a little something added to the mix.
