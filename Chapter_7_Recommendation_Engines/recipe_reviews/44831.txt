Loved this recipe.  I made it for my teenage son's party. Everyone loved it.  It was gone in no time! The only change I made was to add more cheese.  We used Velveeta, the large block, I believe it's two pounds.  I thought it alittle thick without the extra cheese.  We didn't change anything else though, which surprised me.  It wasn't too cheesy this way. Really good recipe -- thank you.

This was so easy and delish, I made it for a beach party mexican themed buffet and 150 people (as much that was left) got to try it and loved it!! This is so tasty, many compliments were given!

Update: Mar. 08, I made this again and didn't know what to do with the leftovers because it does make alot.... so I created "Encha-males".  I warmed white corn tortillas to softened them, dipped them (both sides) in the warm Cowboy Dip, filled them with about a tablespoon of heated leftover shredded chicken and some shredded cheese. I suppose these could be held in a warm oven until you assemble as many as you want, but I served then immediately and just made more as we went along. The oven might dry them out too much. I also added more cheese to the top.  Voila!  My SO, who is mexican, wanted to know what the "gravy" was.... he said these were excellent! I served them with a salad and the borracho beans also from All Recipes.  I hope you try this and enjoy it too!

I served this to my card club and everyone loved it.  It's not the healthiest dish, but what the heck... Thanks!  I did add more hot sauce and used 1 lb of the Mexican velveeta... next time I will increase the "cheese"... I felt it needed more. For the person who said mashing the tamales was "messy"... I used my handy-dandy old fashioned potato masher and it was a breeze!  This does make alot so be prepared to share! (Does anyone think it would freeze well?)

This was the hit of the party! I used  mexican velveeta and jarred chili instead of canned as well as several dashes of  lousiana hot sauce, chili powder and a tad of cumin. Everyone fought over the leftovers!!

Very tasty and easy to do!! Dont forget to spray the crockpot with PAM or a cooking spray so that it doesnt stick. We used a potato masher to mash up the tamales which worked fabulously. Much less messy than mashing with a fork. The appearance of the dish isnt the most appealling (it looks kinda like a refried bean dip), but all the guests at the Christmas party last night devoured it. I got lots of compliments and will definately do it again. We bought two bags of chips (one bag of tortilla chips, one of corn chips) and ran out...I will do three bags next time.

Great Dip!  I had a hard time finding the beef tamales, used frozen ones and cooked them in the microwave.  Everyone loved it!

Wow, what a surprise but I'll be making this again and again!  I used a little less than 1 lb of 2% velveeta, 98% fat free turkey chili with no beans, and only 1 can of the tamales, (they have 6 in each can).  I also added about 6 ounces of cream cheese too and I loved it.  Used the mild form of the Rotel and it was perfect for us!  Thanks for this fun recipe.

The recipe was a hit!!!  Chopping/Mashing the tamales was very messy but well worth it.  Everyone loved it.

This was amazing! My family loved it. I used it as a topping on my homemade Shredded Beef Chimichangas! It was a hit. I followed the recipe for the exception of a few spices and made it on the stove top. It will be a staple in my cookbook!

This isn't the best-looking dip, but it is very addictive. Use Velveeta Mexican Cheese for more spiciness, although the original recipe is zippy enough.

My husband and I liked the flavor of this dip, but it didn't melt in the slow cooker in 40 minutes. It didn't even melt after an hour, so I would recommend and alternative method of heating it up. Not sure I liked the consistency, either, but would probably make it again.

I was taught a very similar recipe back in the second grade (23 years ago) - just omit the tomatoes/chiles and use cheddar cheese instead of processed cheese - it's really great, so I can imagine this is just as good. I like to add a litte cumin and hot sauce.

My sister first introduced me to this recipe. She uses Hormel canned tamales, it makes it easier and less messy. This is a great recipe for folks who can't have spicy food.

I love this one, I added a little salsa because I didn't have enough of the tomato's and green chile's and it was great.  Only downside was finding right temperature for the crock pot to keep it from burning to the bottom, but also keep it melted.

Wonderful. The addition of 1lb ground beef (browned before adding) to the mix makes it heartier.

I could not really taste the tamales.  I like to use sausage instead, it makes a much nicer cheese dip.

This was a staple at all the office parties I went to before retiring.  Always the crock pot was licked clean.  Sounds simple, tastes complex.  
Thank you for posting this.

I have never come across a recipe for dip that is even remotely similar to this one. It was such a huge hit in our house that I let my sister try it when she came to visit yesterday and she went home with the recipe. This has just become my go to dip knocking rotel dip off its pedestal. Thanks for sharing!

I didn't particularly like this recipe, it tasted too tamalalee.  I don't know if it was the brand of tamales I used, but it was really thick.  It was easy, as all I had to do was place it in the crock-pot and cook it.  I don’t' think I will try this recipe again.

Great recipe!  DO NOT substitute regular block cheddar for the processed cheese.  It comes out a bit too stiff for dipping.

Thanks is for sharing! This was a BIG hit on Christmas Eve. I did use 2lbs of velveeta and it makes a massive amount; if you do not need to feed an army (or handful of teenagers), you may consider halving the recipe.

I thought is was great tasting, kind of reminded me of bean dip. I used the whole loaf (2 Lbs.) of Velvetta  Cheese. My husband didn't care for it, would rather have a more cheesy taste. Probably will make it for a big crowd.

Very good. Very thick.  Easy to play with & customize.  I added chili powder, garlic powder, seasoned salt, etc., to build a bit more body flavor, as well as more canned diced tomatoes/peppers/chilis to thin it out a bit.  Will definitely make again.

The tamales made the recipe too thick with too much corn flavor and covered the Rotel flavor.  We had to add hot sauce and salsa to balance it out.  Probably won't make this again.

Very easy, and my family loved it. I used canned tamales because I would feel guilty wasting quality tamales on a dip.
