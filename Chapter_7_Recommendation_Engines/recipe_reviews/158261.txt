This is one of our favorite snacks around here. Want a real treat? Use 
Peanut Butter and Co.'s flavored peanut butter, like Cinnamon Raisin or White Chocolate Dreams. Puts a different spin on Ants on a Log!

Great recipe - the classics never die!  I made these for my niece and it was great because she could "help" and I loved it because I am an admitted peanut butter addict and couldn't help but sneak a few myself....

These used to be a favorite of mine when I was little, I had forgotten all about them until I saw this recipe, I also have never used cinnamon which was a nice twist.  I also used chocolate chips instead of raisins, which my mom would do sometimes!

Try using dried sweetened cranberries instead of raisins.  Red Ants on a Log!  It is a nice twist.

I love this as a snack, but gave this recipe only 4 stars because the addition of cinnamon didn't affect the taste of the dish, in my opinion. Still a good snack, but why waste the cinnamon?

I like the cinnamon in this!  What could be easier and bring back childhood memories?  We have a large amount of celery so I thought I'd add this to our lunch.  Tastes good, thanks.

What a fun name for a "typical" snack! Kids loved it just because of the name I think. We also did our own twist to the recipe, and changed out the raisins for Cranraisins (dried cranberries) and called it "Fire Ants on a Log" It is a after school fav!

I made these as a snack for my 4 year old.  He loved them so much he asked if I can pack them in his lunch tomorrow.  I like them because he is getting veggies, fruit and protein. It is a healthy snack he enjoyed. Thank you!!!

A ridiculously simple and healthy snack! I'd never used cinnamon before, but enjoyed the tasty addition. We generally use pomegranate craisins, but anything from raisins to chocolate chips would be a good add-on. Easy to pack in lunch boxes too. Enjoy!
