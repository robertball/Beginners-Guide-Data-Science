I added a splash of balsamic vinegar to the tomatoes.  After toasting the french bread, I spread a thin layer of basil pesto on before topping with the tomato mixture.  Very good!

Very quick, simple, and tasty!!  I added an extra clove of garlic,  diced red onion, and a splash of balsamic for extra flavor.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I thought it still had a bit of that canned tomato flavor.  I used Hunt's brand, so maybe using the RED GOLD brand that the recipe calls for is the trick!?
