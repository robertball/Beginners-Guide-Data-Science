Turned out well. Usually turmeric is not added in curd rice but I added it cause it says so in the recipe. Added  little sugar for taste. And make sure that the rice is at room temperature before adding the yogurt mix.

This is a great recipe! I've made this a few times now and have varied it in only a few small ways. Instead of using the dry red pepper, I now use sriracha brand chili paste that gets mixed in after pulling the mustard seeds. Additionally I started using a tzatziki sauce (home-made--traditional recipe) as opposed to plain yogurt. I also tend to go a little more generous with the curry, but that is a personal taste thing. This has been requested repeatedly by both roommates and my girlfriend since the initial trial. Great with any kind of Mediterranean or Indian dish.

I kind of made this dish on a bet as it looked so kooky.   This dish is so good, I feel sorry for anyone who has not tried it.    I have made it maybe 30 times and will make it forever more.  I leave out the asafoetida as it is kind of a heavy hitter.  The curry leaves are key though.  Thanks DHAN0923!!

I have made this dish multiple times with different dried chilies (man the habaneros were HOT!), however I can't get my hands on curry leaves. I have asafoetida powder which I thought would be the harder ingredient to find, but no curry leaves. So I will need to try to buy some from Amazon to try this rice in all its glory. In the meantime, the rice is still very tasty without the curry leaves and no substitution made. This recipe has frequented a few of my menus throughout the summer and I am sure it will continue to pop up frequently. Thank you!

Tasty! I didnâ€™t have curry leaves so used a bit of lime zest and two bay leaves instead, and I used soy milk instead of dairy milk. I added in a bit of paprika and a quarter cup of pine nuts, which added to it for me.
