This is an excellent basic recipe for pasta salad.  I added small amounts each of avacado, cheddar cheese and cucumber.  Very good!

This is closer to my macaroni salad and I like it better without bellpepper. Use a bag of salad macaroni instead of regular macaroni. Chop about a cup of celery and about 3 to 4 green onions, add about 2 tab of pimento,small can of sliced olives and and 3 small chopped gerkins.  Mix with a couple of tab of lemon juice, olive oil and a little bit of dill pickle juice. Add salt and pepper and cover and chill for a couple of hours and make sure to chill your macaroni as well. Later mix enough mayo to coat your macaroni and drain a bit of the juices from your mix and add to the macaroni and mix well. Add about 5 chopped boiled eggs and mix well and sprinkle some paprika on top and wala! You have a great macaroni salad!

Sorry, but I thought this terribly boring.  I don't quite comprehend the concept of rating THIS recipe by substituting so many things that it's an entirely different recipe.  But THIS recipe certainly doesn't "have it all."

Excellent Recipe! I used Kraft Greek Vinaigrette dressing instead of Italian dressing. Also I added 1/4 c. shreeded  Parmesan cheese & 1/4 cup Mexican shredded cheese.  My husband rated it 10 stars (if possible!)Thanks for the recipe!

I have not made this yet but it pretty similar to the way I make mine and for the people that mentioned that this salad has no flavour - marinate the pasta in the dressing for about an hour or more if you like. I also put fresh garlic into my salad - toss it in with the dressing to marinate the pasta. I also add to mine olives, sweet gherkins. Red or yellow bell peppers sounds great and I don't care much for celery so I would substitute them with cucumbers chopped fine and blotted to get out the moisture. Also I would season with some extra granulated garlic - can you guess I like garlic :)

I omitted the eggs, celery and added dry hard salami, cheddar cheese and black olives, sliced. Also made my own Italian -style dressing. It was very good and my husband gobbled it right up. Have made it two more times since.

We enjoyed this recipe. I did add a bit of mayo and a tiny bit of musturd as well. Threw in some extra green pepper chopped as well. Will make again for sure but maybe add some bacon next time. Good for making in a hurry.

Followed the recipe exactly, except I used Balsamic V. dressing because that's what I had on hand.
