This is my recipe, and I wanted to mention that YES, at first it can taste salty - you need to let it sit for a few minutes.  Salt pulls the juice out of fruits, and when an adequate amount of juice is released it makes a nice sauce without tasting salty.  Also, if you buy underripe fruit they wont be very juicy and you wont get a good balance of flavors.  Hope this helps anyone else who considers trying this!

My boyfriend LOVED this salad.  I didn't think he would because of the cayanne pepper; he doesn't like spicy food. But he begs me to make this all the time. I mean every week.  I originally made the salad for a Mexican themed Tapas night with his parents and a bunch of their friends and this salad was a big hit.  I made the sauce exactly as directed the first time but since I am a little more liberal with the honey and lime and cayenne and it's just as good (I measure mostly by eye and "feel"). I never do more salt as you can definitely taste it in the marinade. I do INSIST however that you make this the day before, it's sooo good that we almost never eat it same day.  My typical fruits: canteloupe, honeydew, pineapple (must have), mango, papaya.  I also tried strawberries the first time but I insist they get a little too mushy from the marinade and they soak up a bit too much marinade.  My other tip: big bite sizes pieces!  The first time I diced the pieces small to look more like a fruit salsa but they took on too much marinade and weren't as good. "Chunky" sizes make for the best fruit-marinade ratio. :)  Enjoy! This Mexican Fruit Salad is very good any way you slice it!

This was very good. It seemed a bit salty at first, but that mellowed as the salad sat and the juices released. I like the addition of the cayenne--it reminds me of Mexican candy (mango-flavored hard candy coated with chili powder and cayenne), and it's not too spicy at all. I added some honeydew for color and because salt complements melon perfectly. Next time, I'll add mango as well (8/11/07). UPDATE: I eat fruit for breakfast every day, and I've found I can make up a batch of this on Sundays and just keep adding fruit to it throughout the week (my favorite combo is cantaloupe, honeydew, mango, and watermelon)--the juices combine with the dressing and the flavor lasts all week.

This is fabulous! A flavorful snack that's great for a hot day. I made it with a nectarine, an apple, ~1.5 cups blueberries, 3 cups watermelon, a can of organic pineapples, half a pound strawberries, and a quarter of a cantelope. Substituted pineapple juice for the honey, added a handful of chopped fresh mint, and left out the salt completely (added it when I ate it if I wanted to) - delicious!!

Mexicans always put lime, salt and chile powder on fruit.  We wouldn't eat fruit any other way.  So the "something different" for me was putting honey in the mix.  I cut up 2 mangoes, 1 honeydew, 1 cantalope and 1 pineapple.  I did add more lime juice because the honey was a little too sweet for me.  And I used chile powder instead of cayenne.  This was excellent, everyone loved it.

Made this for a baby shower at work--apparently I thought the extra heat from the cayenne might induce labor. I loved it--couldn't find any melon, so I subbed in diced pears and apples, I also zested the limes before juicing them, and added a some coconut flakes. It was a big hit.

Really good. I liked the heat from the cayenne and the salt with the sweet fruit. I cut this down to a couple of servings and I used kosher salt and only a sprinkle of it and about 1/8 tsp (a really good sized pinch) of cayenne. I preferred the flavor this had with the pineapple and mango over the strawberries and grapes. I think maybe the tropical fruits are better suited for this dressing? If you don't like spice, you probably won't like this. It wasn't spicy hot, but had a little warmth to it. This is really similar to my favorite fruit topping of Trecha's brand chile powder for fruit, so if you like that, you'll like this salad. Thanks, I liked this.

Definitely something different! I adjusted the "sauce" ingredients for a half recipe, and opted for canned fruit as nothing looked appealing at the grocery store. If doing this, and making a half recipe, reduce the salt to 1/4 tsp. or a pinch or two as the fruit will not release juices to dilute it. I would also use a pinch or two of chile powder next time as it was slightly too hot. It has a nice balance of flavours, sure to be a hit at brunch! I topped it off with some granola for a "crunch" factor. Yum!

I had really sweet pineapple and watermelon, so I ended up deciding not to use any honey. I did use the full amount of salt though - and it turned out great! Tomorrow I'm going to blend the leftovers with ice for a virgin margarita slushy... Thanks!

I brought this "different" salad to a tailgate with friends. The general consensus was that this was not a win. The cayenne pepper was overwhelming and ruined the fruit. This was a waste of money & an embarrassing contribution to the event.

This is definitely something different! It was a great treat for a picnic down by the river! I used cantelope, watermelon, honeydew, grapes and strawberries but wish I'd left the strawberries out. The flavor was best with the melons. As others mentioned, it really does need to set so that it doesn't taste too salty.

This is delicious. I used half as much honey (I didn't have any more...) and twice as much cayenne pepper, as well as the full amount of salt. For me, it was perfect! I've never really liked fruit salad because I always felt there was something missing. Now I know what it was. ;)  As for the fruit, I used strawberries, pineapple, mandarines, and kiwi. I wanted to throw in some blueberries, but they were too expensive. :/  As for the salt, it's definitely not too much. Granted, I eat a lot of salty foods, so in my opinion, salt needs to be added to everything...  [edit]: My boyfriend hated it. *sigh* And this is the guy who puts onions on his strawberry ice cream for fun.

I made this recipe for new years and it was awful. I used half the salt recommended  it was still all I could taste, even after I let it sit as recommended. I like fruit salad that has a fresh taste. This just did not do it for me.

I did not enjoy the salty flavor in this salad.  I wanted to try something different and let it sit for awhile since another reviewer said it wouldn't be as salty if I let is sit for awhile.  That wasn't the case.  The next morning the salad was still too salty to eat, and I only used half of the salt the recipe dictated.  I gave it two stars because I liked the honey/lime mixture and thought it was tasty before the salt ruined the flavor for me.  I guess we just don't have daring enough tastebuds...;)

I had this at a party, and it was yummy! The heat of the cayenne is a great balance to the sweetness of the fruit! I'm going to try the same basic concept with different fruits.

Oh yea, used only a "dash" of cayenne pepper.  -  Next time I might try adding mandarin oranges & kiwis.

I only used half the salt and half the cayenne but still found the salad much too salty and although it wasn't too spicy, we didn't like the taste of the cayenne with the fruit.

This was very different and very good.  I decreased the salt back to 1/2 tsp due to hypertension issues and thought it was plenty salty.  Would be really good with cantaloupe too.  Will definitely add this to my menu on a regular basis.

I was a bit worried with the mixed reviews, so I only used half the salt & half the cayenne.  I am curious to the flavor with the whole amounts, but I have to say that using half didn't really stand out a whole lot.  No one raved or was game to try the full amount, so I won't be making again.  I did personally like the "warmth" that came from eating the fruit.

This is absolutly the very best fruit salad I have tasted. I took it to Keeno and the group just loved it. Hats off to FYRECRACKER for sharing this.
