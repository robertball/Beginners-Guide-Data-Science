Made this after stumbling across yet another 2 lb tube of bologna in the freezer. Husband had been reminiscing about the pickled bologna his best friend's mom made for them when he was a kid. I thought it sounded revolting, but I gave it a try anyway. Have to say that while it's not up there with my all-time favorite things to snack on, it IS pretty darn good. I made it with apple cider vinegar and fresh sliced jalapenos. Haven't reached the 90 day mark yet but I agree that it definitely gets better the longer you let it steep. We have it summer sausage-style with cheese and crackers. Good stuff. Thanks!

I didn't have any good bologna on hand, so I used some higher-quality beef franks without any other changes to the recipe. I waited about ten days to open the first jar, which was very good. The sausage flavor wasn't dominated by the vinegar mix, and the hot sauce and jalapenos gave a nice bite. This brine could probably be used for a whole variety of different picklings!

My husband and 9year old daughter begged me to make a second time! We get lots of venison ring bologna so it's a different way to use it up! They say DELICIOUS!
