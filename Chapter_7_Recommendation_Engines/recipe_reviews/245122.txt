I just guessed at most of the ingredients because I had frozen some mini pepperonis as well as 1/4 cup measurements of the pizza sauce. I omitted the olives because I don't care for them. But this is the good thing about this recipe - you can adjust and easily make it your own! I enjoyed this for a very filling lunch.
