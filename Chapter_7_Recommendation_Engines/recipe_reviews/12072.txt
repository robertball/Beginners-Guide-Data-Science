DELICIOUS! WOW, what a great tasting pasta dish. I added just a touch of butter with the olive oil to cook the onions (adds some great flavour), seasoned the chicken breasts with salt and pepper before cooking, used half of the oregano suggested (not a huge fan) and used whole wheat penne pasta. I used reduced fat feta cheese which melted right away and created this beautiful, light, creamy sauce. Everyone that tried it absolutely LOVED it. I'm so thrilled that I found this recipe. I will be using this for many years to come. DEVINE recipe Lalena... thank you so much for posting!

This recipe was fantastic!  I took some users suggestions and added the olives as well as some marinade from the artichokes.  I also used a can of diced tomatoes..do not drain!  The marinade and juice from the tomatoes really helped keep this from being dry.  I was very surprised at how flavorful this meal was!  This is definitely restaurant quality!  The feta cheese really gave it that "greek" flavor.  My b/f referred to it as "fancy"!  Wasn't very difficult to make and took right at 30 min to prepare and cook! There is also a ton of leftovers..which will be perfect for lunch! Will be making this again and would recommend this to anyone!

This was very good.  Because of the mixed reviews I added the marinade from 1 jar of artichokes (I only used 1 jar) to add more flavor.  Also used canned tomatoes since fresh are not in season.  If you don't like tangy sauces then you won't like this one.  Next time I'll add a bit of tomato paste to thicken the sauce.  My husband and I really enjoyed this.  I will make this again!

I can't believe I haven't rated this, I've been making this for quite some time and it's a favorite. I make a few changes - I season the chicken with paprika, salt, pepper & onion powder. I frequently use fresh herbs from the garden. I use a can of petited diced tomatoes instead of fresh. I also add mushrooms and saute with the chicken. I saute this hard to get a nice coloring going on. I also add black olives. I don't add the feta until I mix the pasta with the chicken. I appreciate the recipe, we have really enjoyed it.

I prepared this with linguini noodles and it tasted great. I also made sure to add chopped kalamata olives which added plenty of flavor. Lastly, the only artichokes I had on hand were the one packed in oil and they worked great as well. It probably added a few calories, however I was able to cut a few out by using fat free feta cheese. So it probably evened itself out in the end. This recipe was ideal for a weeknight dinner because it was fast and delicious without a lot of cleanup.

Wow, this was AMAZING!!!  If you like Greek Salad, you will LOVE this pasta!  Both my husband and I thought it was even better than most of the pasta dishes we've had at nice restaurants.  I would give it 10 stars if I could.... I made it in my electric skillet and I changed a few minor things.  First off, I only used 1/2 pound of pasta.  We like our pasta to have more sauce and less noodles and since it's just the two of us, this worked out perfectly.  It was nice and moist and it still made enough for us to have leftovers the next day.  I used penne pasta, which is our favorite.... The other changes I made were: I used a yellow onion instead of red, I used a can of diced tomatoes (drained) instead of the chopped tomato, I added about half of the artichoke marinade along with the artichokes (for more flavor and liquid), I added 1/2 cup sliced kalamata olives (this made it REALLY yummy!) and I used double the amount of feta cheese (1 cup total).  I added 1/2 cup into the sauce and cooked it a little longer than what the recipe stated, so it melted down somewhat and made almost a cream sauce.  The other 1/2 cup I sprinkled over the top of the pasta/sauce mixture before serving it... I'll definitely be making this again and again and again!

Per all the advice, I decided to make a delicate tomato sauce to go with this, I used a marinara with 1/2 c heavy cream and about 1/2 cup of red wine, and reduced it till it was very thick, when added with the other ingredience in this recipe, the meal was incredible. Really it does need a light tomato sauce, I also topped with fresh grated parmesean cheese. 5 stars, and I will be making this one often! Thanks for the recipe!!!!

This is a very good recipe. I followed the directions as I always do the first time. I really enjoyed it as did my company. Even though tomatoes were in season, I failed to have and fresh one so I substituted a can of diced tomatoes. I found no problems, but think that fresh would be even better. Thanks for a great recipe. I STRONGLY recommend marinated artichokes. It is the make or break ingredient in my opinion.

My husband and I thought this was delicious. As is my habit, I increased the amount of seasonings, the artichokes, the tomatoes, the feta, the olives, the garlic, added fresh basil. Next time, I will do the same, but use white rather than red onion (looked like ham to me) and I may try canned plum tomatoes, though I don't want to lose that fresh summery taste. Made a great meal with salad, kalamata olive/garlic bread and wine

Very good dish, however I do not understand how this is meant for six (4-5 is more appropriate).  I reduced the artichokes, and would recommend increasing the feta.  Presentation is a bit bland and needs more color.  Red or green peppers or broccoli would be nice.

DELICIOUS!!!!! I followed directions, but I added a few things. I added some yellow, orange, and green peppers with some broccoli. I had a feeling the pasta was going to be a bit dry so I added a lil olive oil to the pasta. Eating was so playful because of so many flavors and textures. I will DEFINITELY make this again!

I love Greek food and this hit the spot.  After reading the reviews, I made the following changes:
1. Decreased pasta to 1/2 lb of bowtie(there are only two of us)
2. Used one can of petite diced tomatoes undrained.
3. Definitely added the Greek olives and MARINATED artichokes!
4. used 3/4 cup feta cheese
5. added 6 ounces plain Yogurt just before adding pasta 
6. juice of 1/2 lemon at end.
7. Lots of chopped parsley!!

Fiancee loved it as did I and there was plenty with enough for another meal the next day. Next time will marinate the chicken in the drained marinade from the artichokes. Great recipe!!

I make something very similar but as a salad instead of a hot pasta dish. I start out with broiled chicken, then I marinade it in olive oil, the juice of a fresh lemon, garlic & finely chopped red onion or shallot while I assemble the rest of the recipe. Some other changes I make include using a pasta like shells or bow tie (they catch more of the dressing), cherry tomatoes & chopped Kalamata olives, then more dressing made from olive oil, lemon juice and garlic. I often put the feta on the table so people can add as they like. It is always a hit at showers, parties and family gatherings.

I loved this!  I made it for some guests and they were very impressed, calling it a perfect light summer meal.  I also used basil/tomato feta.  For the people who said it was dry, I think they thought that because they are not used to pasta that isn't saturated in some sort of sauce.  This is exactly how a "light" pasta is supposed to be (typical of Greece and Northern Italy).  Flavorful without the saturation!!

I've made this recipe before exactly as shown and it's good. I read many of the reviews and made it again with revisions and it is 5 star! Here are my changes. I added pepper to the pan when I cooked the chicken. I added the artichokes with a couple of TBSP of their marinade, a can of diced italian seasoned tomatoes with their juices instead of the tomatoes,feta cheese, about a cup of diced Asiago cheese,parsley, lemon juice, oregano and about a cup of chopped kalamata olives. These changes made it a keeper!

I absolutely loved this.  My husband was walking around the kitchen, actually muttering to himself, "MAN that was good!" over and over.  I added capers to my version, and also thought kalimata olives might be good - will be trying that next time.  As an aside, the leftovers (without the pasta) make a tasty wrap or pita sandwich too.  Mmmm.  I also have done it with shrimp instead of chicken.  Just those frozen shrimp from a bag - around 31 per pound, maybe a little bigger - and it's awesome.

This is a very good recipe.  Both my son and I just loved it.  The only thing I changed was to omit the chicken, since I wanted to make it into a meatless meal for Lent.  I definitely will make this again...and can't wait to add the chicken as I'm sure it will be even more delicious.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

I made this after I read the reviews and made some adjustments. I browned the chicken, took it out. I sauteed the onion than garlic and orgegano in olive oil until soft and than added 1.5 cups of chicken broth and cooked it down. I put the chicken back in with a 28 oz can of chopped tomatoes, artichokes and kalamato olives. I added the parsley, 6 oz feta, and squeezed lemon at the end. It has a wonderful Greek flavor and I will definitly make it again but will add 2 28oz cans of tomatoes the next time. I made it for Valentines Day and my husband loved it so much he ate two bowls full.

Awesome recipe--thanks for sharing! I added a 4 oz can of black olives and also added the juice from the marinated artichokes. Didn't have red onion but yellow worked just fine! I served with couscous on the side instead because I didn't feel like pasta. I let the sauce thicken for about 20 minutes after I removed it from the heat.

I made this tonight and it was a hit! My husband loved it and even my 15 month old daughter loved it!! I will make it again for sure!! I did add more feta and more onions. It was great. I agree with others that 1 pound of pasts was a bit much I used about 3/4 a pound and I still thoguht it was a bit much - but overall it was a great meal!

This got mixed reviews from my family. DH took 3 bites and stopped eating (and he usually will eat anything). My teen said "the chicken pieces are good" (an attempt to be polite). I on the other hand loved the "tangy" flavor, (but I love Greek Salads w/tangy dressing and Feta, picked beets, etc., and they don't). I did think it was too dry (too much pasta for the amount of sauce) and (after tasting) added some more of the same ingredients fresh, (tomatoes, Feta, parsley and red onion) at the end.  I will try again without the marinated artichokes, add some canned diced tomatoes (to add some 'sweet' from the sugar, canned tomatoes have, AND not drain, to add some liquid. If you like Greek dressings etc. or "more vinegary" foods, you will probably enjoy this.

Just made it for dinner tonight. Everyone liked it, so I will definitely add to the rotation. Next time, I will probably put the feta on the table as a condiment instead of in the dish though.

I had some chicken thawed out..had planned on a greek pasta salad. But it's too cold for that today. So...found this recipe. It was awesome. I had a half jar of marinated artichokes from a meal I did a few days prior, and a sprinkle of Feta cheese left. It didn't matter still turned out awesome. I didn't have any lemons, so didn't use the lemon. Used one roma tomato, and 2 chicken breast. Quick, easy and full of flavor!

Excellent.  I added black olives and used vegetable rotini.  Make sure you chop the onions fine or they overpower the other flavors.

Delicious! I used a 14 oz can of petite diced tomatoes but will increase that to a large can next time. Used some italian seasoning (1 tsp) and omited red onion becase family doesn't like it so used sweet onion and used canned artichoke hearts(not marinated) and even with these few changes it was so good. If you use a pound of pasta this will be on the dry side. Didn't make enough sauce for a pound so take that into consideration when making it. So yummy!

AWESOME.  And really easy.  I actually grilled my chicken and then added it to the pan with the juice from the plate after I added the tomatoes, etc.  I did not use fresh tomato, I used 1 can of diced tomatoes (with basil, oregano, and garlic included). I did not drain tomatoes or artichokes.  I'm VERY glad I had that juice in the sauce.  Otherwise I added a little red pepper flakes, olives and sauteed some mushrooms with the onions and garlic.  VERY good but I felt like I could have used a little more seasoning.  Next time I'll add more garlic and onion.  YUMMM!!!

This recipe is great as is, I did however add  kalamata olives, mostly because I traveled to Greece recently and came to love the tang olives add to dishes. Great addition IMO, but the dish is really good regardless.

We made this dish almost exactly to recipe. The only differences were in how we cut the vegetables (I used a food processor, so it was more fine), and we also added shredded parmesean cheese and some of the reserved pasta water. The water helped make it less dry, and I kept it behind after reading some reviews that said the result was kind of dry. It was fantastic! Plenty of leftovers, we'll be eating this tomorrow, too.

Very good!  I used whole wheat penne (not a whole pound though) and followed the recipe almost exactly.  Didn't have a red onion (but I think it would've been better that way) so I used a yellow one.  Bell peppers would have been a great addition.  Sprinkled some olives on top before eating.  Served with spinach salad.  Makes a ton, so we'll be enjoying the leftovers tomorrow!

Absolutely loved it.  Followed to the letter, and will not be making any adjustments, except possibly canned tomatoes if really crunched for time.  Passed my two tests:  Can I make it easily with a cranky baby hanging onto my leg, and will the family eat it/like it.  Yes to both!

This is a light, easy, fairly quick pasta recipe that can be made after a long day at work. I would decrease the lemon only IF you plan on using all of the marinade from the artichokes, otherwise leave it alone. This is not your average, heavily sauced, heavy meat, heavy ingredients type pasta dish. It IS a refreshing, lighter, easy pasta dish to make for a bit of a change-up. I like this recipe, and it is easy to tweak the ingredients a bit to your liking. I used a rotisserie chicken with regular seasonings, and that was delicious! One may also skip the lemon juice as it can be very pungent, and instead use a "Mrs Dash" type seasoning which pairs well with the flavors of a rotisserie chx. Also remember that dried herbs provide more flavor than fresh.

A quick and easy recipe to impress company; I used brown and wild rice instead of pasta, it added a great texture. I also added a green pepper, a red pepper (awesome color addition), mushrooms, and I did not drain the artichokes. I did not cook the chicken, garlic, and onion in the same pan with the rest of the vegetables so the chicken would not overcook. I used a whole onion, and added red wine vinegar & extra olive oil to the pan without the meat. The vinegar gave it more 'greek' flavor! The cheese went on last after serving the dish over the rice. This dish is also GREAT as a salad topping of fresh spinach/romaine. So versatile and full of flavor! Thank you!

Fantastic, the fresh lemon squeeze prior to eating, made the flavors pop!  My only slight adjustments were to season the chicken and to add kalamata olives.

This is a great, flavorful pasta recipe.  I use marinated artichokes with the marinade, and each time I make it, I add different ingredients; mushrooms, black olives - sliced, sun dried tomatoes, canned tomatoes, etc.  It's one of those recipes that you can have fun with!  Thanks for sharing this one!!

I give this five stars when you add the juice of the artichokes adds so much to the flavor. We love this in summer especially cause it is good hot or cold.

This is soooooooo good!!!  I plugged in the ingredients I had on hand and this came up.  So many people complain about some of us who rate recipes when we make a few substitutions but as cooks we are creative!  And sometimes I'm looking for the "essence" of a recipe based on what I have in the kitchen.  I had leftover parmesan/paprika chicken (from AR) and knew I wanted pasta.  This fit the bill.  I had no artichokes but did have mushrooms so I sauteed those with the onion and then added everything else.  To make a little more sauce I just added some white wine and let the whole thing reduce a little.  Delicious!!!  and yes, tangy.

We made this recipe tonight and it was delicious! We went with some of the reviewers suggestions. We used a half a lb of bowtie pasta. We used a white onion instead of red, seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, garlic salt and paprika. We also used about a tablespoon and a half of the artichoke marinade. I thought the fresh parsley made this recipe. The sauce is tangy and my husband and I both agreed next time to use a little less lemon juice or marinade. Taste it as you go to see how tangy you like it. The feta was a nice contrast to the tangy however. This was very flavorful and with a half pound of noodles was a perfect amount of sauce. Will definitely make again!

Delicious!!!!I took the liberty of adding some white (dry), wine while browing the chicken. What flavour! I also added sliced mushrooms and fersh baby spinach to the sauce. Also, along with the fresh tomatoe, I included one, 8 0z can of Hunts tom. sauce. Next time however, I'll add another so there's more sauce. Also next time, I'll include the artichokes. Didn't have any on hand, and I was anxious to make this dish today. Turned out VERY tasty. My boyfriend said it reminded him of a dish he ate at a fancy restaurant in D.C. Go figure!!! Thanks so much for this fabulous dish Lalena!

This was a great recipe. It is also a fantastic starter recipe! I tried adding spinach, olives and red pepper flakes.

Great recipe. Personally, I like more tomatoes and sauce, so I add another can of tomatoes and a small can of tomato sauce. So easy, but so delicious!

excellent! I used roasted diced toms out of a can and the marinade from one jar of the artichokes...a bit too much but overall outstanding!

I added some black olives, half can of diced toms, and the marinade from the artichokes.  Used chicken from poached whole chicken.  Delicious!

I love this recipe!!! I use canned tomatos for convenience and price and blended them to be more kid friendly. I also add roasted red pepper, instead of the artichoke only because I forgot the artichoke, i look forward to trying it that way. The kalmata olives are an awesome extra, yummy!!!

This was OK. I will not be making it again though. It didn't really have a sauce to it and you couldn't really taste the feta.

Wonderful!  I seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper and used a 4 oz jar of marinated artichokes with a 14 oz can of non-marinated artichokes.  I increased the garlic and added way more fresh tomatoes and some kalamata's.  Wonderful!  Served over whole wheat rotini.

Yum!  I suggest double the tomato and onion, and add a few spoonfuls of pasta water.  That eliminates any dryness but retains the original intent.  We skipped the feta.  Husband ate even more than usual!

YUM!  I added everything that other users said to add (pasta sauce, olives, red wine and heavy cream) and it was delish!  I left out the parsley, as it only adds color to dishes.  The olives did that for this dish.  It was wonderful!  This is a keeper!!  Thank you to everyone for your suggestions!

Wow, great recipe! Easy and super tasty. My whole family loved it and that includes my picky toddler! I added a little more olive oil at the end to moisten it up a little. Other than that, I followed the recipe and yum.

FANTASTIC!!!  I've made this a few times now and everyone loves it!  I skipped the onion just because I don't like it.  I grilled chicken breast with a greek rub on it and used that.  I also added a bit of greek dressing to the veggie rotini pasta I used instead of just olive oil.  The artichoke hearts and feta really make it.  Will gladly make this frequently.  Would even be good without the chicken.

I was kind of nervous with this one, thought it would be dry since there wasn't any real liquid or sauce to it... but OMG it was so good. Full of flavor and definitely a repeat. Although I omitted the olives, just because I dont like them :-)  Would recommend this to anyone!

A great meal, but I would wait to add the feta cheese until the end right before serving. I also used half a can of petite chopped tomatoes from a can rather than a fresh tomato and it worked very well!

5 Stars!!  For both taste AND ease.  I followed the recipe...mostly.  I, like others, added some of the juice from the artichokes and threw in some olives.  Turned out delicious and it really only took 30 minutes.  I can't wait to make this in the summer and serve it chilled!

This is definitely tangy! I followed the advice of others and added a little of the marinate from the artichokes and I think next time I wont do that, it made that flavor much more in my face then I wanted. Also, I don't know if I did something wrong but my feta didn't melt in any way? I followed the directions and others said theirs did. I'm curious if I did something wrong...or if that is suppose to happen.

Love this recipe!! I have cooked this for a few different crowds and it's always a hit. I definitely agree with other suggestions, use the artichoke marinade. The feta added great flavor so don't skip!

Great recipe!  I, like many others, made a few changes: I used a can of diced tomatoes with seasoning (undrained) instead of the fresh tomato, I added a 1/2 can of olives, used the artichoke marinade, added some diced sundried tomato, and cut the amount of pasta in half.  One reviewer said her fet melted to create a creamy sauce.  That didn't happen to mine, unfortunately, but this is a delicous recipe!

Really good! Definitely will make it again. We tried it with the artichoke marinade as other reviewers suggested but without the canned tomatoes that other reviewers encouraged, and next time we'll add the canned tomatoes too, because it could use that little extra flavor.  The recipe really makes a lot of food.

My husband, and I both LOVED this. I only used 1 tsp of oregano and I added a little liquid from the artichoke hearts as other suggested. Other then that followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious. I can't wait to eat the leftovers for lunch tomorrow. This will be added into the rotation.

delicious and healthy recipe! i made the following simple additions/modifications for added flavor: doubled the artichokes, drained the artichokes from the oil and marinated the chicken in the oil for one hour, used two small chopped tomatoes and one can diced tomato undrained, used 6 oz fat free feta, added one sliced red bell pepper and 2 cups fresh broccoli, used extra salt and oregano, added dried basil. delicious!! husband thought it was outstanding and gobbled it up. little did he know i used fat free feta. heehee ;)

This was very good.  I used two tomatoes, and I think I would double that next time, along with more red onion.  I used whole wheat pasta and fat free feta, and it was delicious!  This is definitely a keeper.

I am the type of cook that uses recipes more as a "guidline".  I followed this one to the "t" and WOW!  It was fantastic.  I used another person's suggestion of orzo - 3/4 lb.  I loved the way the pasta didn't overtake the veggies & chicken.  3/4 lb. was still a bit much, so I just chopped up fresh veggies and poured a little vinagrette on it and will have it for lunch.  This recipes does make A LOT.  Great for a dinner party.

I have made this over and over again --I use a large can of diced petite tomatos (you can add a smaller can if you wish) and also add double the fresh tomato and a bit more of  artichoke hearts.  My family loves it cold too.  It is one of our favorites.

This is a great recipe!  Even my one year old loves it.  With so many different flavors, it's always a crowd pleaser.  We've recently tried it with wheat pasta and my husband loved it, which is surprising because he's not a fan of wheat pasta.

Simple dish, but, my husband and I didn't like the flavor. Maybe it was the feta cheese. Oh well, it was worth a shot.

I made this dish for Valentine's Day because it had all our favorite ingredients: feta cheese, artichoke hearts etc.  It was incredibly good! I like garlic, so I used four cloves instead of two.  I also waited until just before I served the dish to add the feta cheese.  Great, simple receipe!

This is so quick, easy, and delicious.  I do use all the marinade from the artichokes, and since I usually have cooked chicken left over from cooking a whole chicken, I use that chopped up.  Definitely use the kalamata olives (reminds me of my trip to the Kalamata region in 2013, miles and miles and miles of olive trees everywhere!!)

Good favors.  Next time add tomatoes after the pasta is off heat to maintain texture.  I deglazed pan with red wine when chicken was cooking for added layer.

It was good.  Six servings?  Really?  Our family of four ate less than half of it.  Perhaps we are small eaters.  Not crazy about the lemon...would leave that out next time.

Excellent dish. Made it for company and everyone liked it. A couple changes: used the whole jar of artichoke with juice and kept the feta cheese on the side to add as needed because my kids don't like feta. Will be making this again. Thanks for a great recipe.

Excellent, and certainly not bland with the recommended changes: 1/2 lb of pasta, 1 can of diced tomatoes with juice, doubling the feta (half mixed in, half sprinkled on top), adding 1/2 of the artichoke marinade, 1/2 c. chopped kalamata olives, and fresh basil. Even though there's a lot going on here, the sauce is lovely and light. For the heavier, creamier sauce, add about 1/2 c. plain yogurt. Definitely a keeper.

Very good!  Don't drain the artichokes or tomatoes. The extra liquid is great.  I used whole grain pasta and even my very picky 13 year old ate three helpings!  I will add mushrooms and kalamata olives next time.  Even good cold the next day, like a pasta salad.  Thanks for the great, quick dinner recipe!

This was pretty good, not quite 5 stars though. The only change I made was to add some mushrooms to use up ones that I had in the fridge.

really good... I added the marinade from the (jarred) hearts, and I substituted 1 can of diced tomatoes for the fresh. We loved it.  My 6 year old even ate it, and that says a lot.

Came out delicious. I grilled the chicken and added it at the end. I used canned diced tomatoes and also added all the artichoke juice from the container then boiled it down before I added the cheese. Very good recipe! AND we used Gluten-free rice pasta for a delicious GF meal!

Oh my this tastes almost exactly like my favorite dish at Carino's!  I absolutely love it!!!  I will take others' advice on making more sauce to go with it.  I might add capers next time also.  What an amazing recipe!

This is a great dish! I was a little skeptical because I like stuff with rich sauses, but this creates it's own sause. I did make some changes, I added olives (this was a no brainer to me- its greek!) and I used spinach instead of parsley, and I didn't drain my can of tomatoes or artichokes. It was great! 5 stars from me and my family!

This recipe was easy to shop for and to prep, I used all fresh ingredients so the prep time took a little bit longer for me, but the outcome was a mixture of fresh tasting pleasant textures.  It was very filling, I think if I made this dish again I would add maybe some wine, the flavors were good, but I think it could have tasted stronger.

ABSOLUTELY THE BEST!!  Light taste but very filling, wanted seconds but was too full!!  The whole family loved it.  I did use slightly less oregano and used regular canned aritchoke hearts because thats all I had.  I had to double the recipe to feed my family of 6 plus a guest we had in town.  But have a little left over.  Will become a regular favorite in our home!!!  Thanks or sharing!!

This was so simple and so tasty.  I didn't use fresh lemon juice so I added 3 tablespoons of the bottled stuff and didn't use fresh garlic so I used a heaping tablespoon of jarred minced.  Thanks for this.  I will make again!

This was a very good meal!  My husband loved it, which is always a plus.  We added some of the liquid from the canned artichokes, and a can of diced tomato along with a medium fresh tomato.  We also added a little bit of smooth marinara to thicken the sauce.  We will definitely be making this again!

This has become one of my favorite recipes.However, like some previous reviewers have said it does turn out a bit dry.I always add the extra liquid from the artichoke hearts and I think I will add an extra can of diced tomatoes in the future.

Excellent, excellent meal....I will make this recipe again.  I used a quart of home canned tomatoes instead of a fresh tomato to give it more sauce for the pasta.   Cooked it in my electric frypan.

This is a good base recipe but does need some tweaking.  It is a bit dry - not terribly the first day but the leftovers are dry (that is with added marinade from the artichokes).  I also think it needs additional veg and olives are a must.  I would recommend some type of peppers, mushrooms and olives at minimum.  Maybe adding some greek dressing or more olive oil the next day would make for a good cold pasta salad.  I enjoyed it but my family didn't care for it.

I followed the recipe exactly and it seemed very bland to me - I know kalamata olives would have enhanced the flavor, but even they wouldn't have fixed it.  Not worth the amount of prep it took :-(

I have also had this recipe printed out for years but have never reviewed. Great, simple recipe. 
I do find it makes an awful lot though- I always half the recipe and it is enough for us ( 2 adults and a preschooler) with a substantial lunch for my husband left over. 
I served this last night with steamed green beans. I am jealous of my husband's lunch in the fridge :)

YUM!  Everyone in my family loved this last night for dinner, and I'm loving it all over again today for lunch.  I used whole wheat pasta and added another tomato, but the flavor of this dish is perfect as written.  Thank you :-)

I wasn't too impressed with the dish at all.  I followed the recipe and took in other tips and used canned diced tomatoes and used the artichoke marinate (some, not all otherwise the dish would have been too 'wet'), even added fresh basil, and the saute'ing chicken with half of the required oregano.  It was indeed quite bland.  I think when I found this recipe, I was searching for 'healthy meals', hence the fresh tomatoes, not canned tomatoes with high sodium.  I used diced canned tomatoes with no added salt (50mg of Sodium).  I think I would definitely have added:  olives, more feta cheese, less of the tomato sauce.  I probably would not recommend this to anyone.  It was too bland.  It's Greek so the consistency should be dry, not 'wet' or 'saucy'.

I normally do not come back and rate recipes, but this was really delicious. I was very apprehensive about making it for fear it would be bland and have little taste because of some of the reviews. That wasn't the case at all, I followed the recipe to the T, except that added canned tomatos (I used the kind that has garlic, basil flavor) and I added olives (because we love them) I also just lightly added some red pepper flakes while cooking the chicken. It had an awesome, VERY favorful taste. This is sure to be one of our favs, thanks so much!!

Turned out great. Used whole wheat pasta and added salt, pepper and half the oregano to chicken right away. Next time will use a bit less lemon juice (too tangy). Added crushed black pepper, some garlic salt, crushed red pepper and a little cayenne pepper. I'll also try adding lemon pepper and paprika next time (I love my spices!). Also, added black olives which were a great addition. Thanks for the (relatively) healthy and delicious recipe! :)

I found this only ok. I made it just as the recipe said and found it to be dry. I also think that a pound of uncooked pasta is a bit much. Next time I'd try canned tomatoes, fresh basil and probably throw in zucchini.

Excellent recipe!  I tweaked a few things.  I don't really measure and I added extra tomatoe and different peppers.  It turned out fantastic.  I have never thought to add feta and lemon juice to a pasta!

Maybe I used to much pasta, but I did not get any flavor from this. I don't know how to make the chicken more appetizing in these type of dishes.

Great dish! Made as is, only I had to use canned tomatoes, regular artichoke hearts and dried parsley. Only used 1/2 a bag of pasta after reading many reviews. Oh, and added some olives. Yummy...thanks!

This was just OK as-is.  When you could get a bite of pasta, tomato, & feta at once it was yummy.  I just didn't think there was enough of the saucy stuff to go with the pasta.  Next time I'd add more feta, add kalamata olives, and some of the juices from the jar of artichoke hearts.

My husband and I were kind of sick of pasta, so I made this recipe but put it on pita bread. It was a great idea! I read a lot of reviews, and a common complaint was that the pasta was somewhat dry. By putting it on pita bread instead of pasta, the problem was solved. :)  I halved the entire recipe with the exception of the feta cheese and artichokes- those I kept at the full portion (I like both of those ingredients a lot). I used marinated artichokes and canned diced tomatoes per the recommendations of others. I sauteed the chicken pieces in the oil from the artichokes, which worked out really well. Overall the result was great. I feel that this is really versatile recipe with a TON of flavor.

This was great! My husband went back for a total of 3 helpings. I changed a few things... I added chicken sausage, spinach and zuchinni and used whole wheat pasta. I also used canned italian styled tomatoes (diced) and a jar of marinated artichokes. I used juice from the both the tomatoes and artichokes to make a sauce (to my liking)and added a touch of ff half and half to make it creamier. WOW!!!

This tastes amazing. Made this exactly to recipe for Valentines 09 and it not only made for a lovely meal that evening but it's something we make a few times a month. It's just mild enough that even my toddler LOVES eating it as well.

My wife and I both loved it.  We're adding it to the "regular recipe" book.  I added spinach and Kalamato olives for what I felt was some much needed color.

After reading other reviewers suggestions, I used only the marinade from the artichokes to saute the garlic, onions, and chicken.  In addtion, I also used a can of diced tomotoes NOT drained.  I added sundried tomoatoes and kalamata olives for a little more "zing" to the dish.  I tried using whole wheat pasta as well to make it a little more healthy, but the next time I will use regular pasta...it just goes better with this type of flavor.  But there will be a next time.  Thanks to everyone for their suggestions!  I'm learning to cook using recipes from this website and comments from other users almost without any help from anywhere else!

Just reading about this made my mouth water. It was so very very good. I pretty much followed recipe exactly except added 1 clove more garlic and about 1/2 - 1 cup chicken stock and more feta. I can't wait for tomorrow for leftovers! Do again for sure, maybe with shrimp?? yummy!

This was soooooo good! I used "California Style" artichokes (whatever that is), and I did put maybe 1/4-1/3 cup of the marinade in the pasta. I also threw in more feta cheese, because it's yummy. No salt or pepper needed! Edit: This doesn't really reheat all that well, so don't make a big batch for leftovers.

The second time around, I really modified this recipe for more color and taste. --- I omitted the olive oil, oregano, salt and pepper. --- To substitute, I used about 1/4 cup of "Absolutely Fabulous Greek/House Dressing" off of Allrecipes. --- Then, I added 3 diced tomatoes, a 10 oz jar of drained Calamata Olives, a sprinkle more of Feta Cheese, and last but not least about 1/2 lb of Genoa Salami. --- I love Genoa Salami so this addition may not work for others. It does however satisfy my taste and gives the pasta dish a more meaty flavor rather than just using chicken by itself. The next day, I added about 1 cup of the Greek dressing, a few Tblsps of lemon, and some more feta cheese. Maybe next time I'll do what others have done and use the artichoke marinade and not the Greek dressing and see how it tastes like the next day. Then, adjust taste with the Greek dressing if needed.

Thanks for sharing:)

This was pretty good.  I added about 1/2 cup of tomato puree (made for 2 servings) to make it more saucy, and used less noodles as other reviews said.  Added more chicken for extra protein.  I also used non-fat feta and whole wheat penne.  We are not huge fans of the Greek flavors, but we did enjoy this.  Thanks!

Pretty good! I ended up using about 1/2 pounds of pasta instead of the full one pound and still felt like there were too many noodles. I know I will use less if I make this recipe again.

Absolutely amazing!  Melted in your mouth and tasted like a true Italian dish!  While eating dinner, the boyfriend asked "When can we have this again" and I said tomorrow!  Used artichoke juice rather than the hearts.  Used mini rigatoni instead of the long noodles.  Larger chunks of chicken gave a heartier taste.  Amazing!!

I loved the flavor of this recipe.  The only recommendations I would make are to reduce the amount of artichokes and serve it on top of the pasta rather than all mixed together. (I felt the flavor became lost in all the noodles.)

A delicious summery dish, although the sauce was watery.  The next time I make this, I'll add some tomato paste to thicken it.  Also added olives because I love them.

I was a bit leery that these ingredients would actually be as tasty as others at this site stated in their reviews, but they were correct. I made a batch of this recipe adjusted for 16 (Super Bowl party) it was a big hit. I added the Kalamatas & more garlic and feta than called for... it was really very good!

I thought this was very bland.  One large tomato was not nearly enough, is you are going to make it  I would use 1 or 2 cans of diced tomatoes.

Love this recipe. Followed some suggestions of reviewers and used canned tomatoes with juice and a little of the juice from artichoke hearts. I am making it again today and using some chopped kalamata olives. My husband loves it and we are adding it to the rotation.

Was Delish!!!  I would cut the oregano some. I used 3/4 of medium onion. I used jar artichokes hearts and put some whole hearts too which made it more eye appealing, just a few. I used real squeezed lemon juice and put extra. I would add Parmesan cheese next time. Was so healthy and delicious.

Yummy! I do feel that the pasta to other ingredients ratio is off, though. Next time I am using half the pasta,leaving all else as is,and it will be perfect for the three of us.

Delicious, quick recipe that you can easily change according to what you have in your fridge. I often omit the chicken to make it even quicker. I used some of the suggestions and added some of the marinade from the artichoke hearts. I also usually add bell peppers and olives.

YUM! I made this last night after looking for a recipe to use leftover rotisserie chicken.  It was delicious.  I  added the cut up chicken at the end to heat up.  I also used 1/2 as much pasta since it's only the two of us.  I will add a can of tomatoes tonight when I heat it up.

We really enjoyed this. It's a nice change of pace from sauce-drenched pasta dishes, and the lemon takes it to another level. My changes: used a leftover 1/2 can of  diced tomatoes with liquid in addition to the fresh tomato, seasoned the chicken before sauteing, and made only 12 oz. of pasta.

I love pasta, and cook it quite often, but never tried this combination - it is absolutely delicious. The artichokes add a lot of tangy flavour, which I really like when mixed with the feta cheese.

This was delish! Even my picky boys ate it. These are the changes I made: I cut up the chicken and sprinkled with parsley, basil, oregano and put it in a zipper bag for about 30 min before cooking. I used sliced green onion instead of red and grape tomatoes. I also used alittle of both regular and tomato basil feta.

I hate to say it, but I found this recipe to be absolutely deplorable. This was especially disappointing because I thought it looked phenomenal. I made the recipe as written except for adding olives and some of the artichoke juice, as other reviewers suggested. I would not make this again, but if I could offer any advice to someone planning on making this it would have to be add the lemon juice bit by bit and DO NOT add the artichoke juice as other reviewers have suggested -- it made the whole recipe taste briney in my opinion.

Super easy recipe with items you would have around the kitchen.  My non-cooking husband put this meal together with a little chopping from me and it was delicious- we were missing fresh parsley and didn't us the garnish lemons and that only would have made it better!  Try it!! My 1 year old niece was visiting and ate the chicken and pasta cut up on her tray and loved the flavor and she is very picky!

I goofed up and bought too much hamburger and not enough chicken for this week's menu.  So, I made this with hamburger.  I used a little Rosemary seasoning, garlic, and onion when I browned the meat.  It was a nice break from the monotony.  A little pricey on the ingredients. We will definitely use this recipe again!!

Fantastic pasta dish.  The lemon, artichoke hearts and feta cheese were a great combo.  My two children (super picky eaters), husband and I all loved it.  Will definitley make it over and over.

One of my all time favorite All Recipes finds!  This is really great exactly as written and you can add any of your favorite greek flavors that aren't already included to make it your own.  It is in our regular rotation, especially in the spring and summer.

I gave this 4 stars as it was written. I changed some things and will add some things next time: 3 TB olive oil, we love garlic so a heaping tablespoon of minced jar garlic, 1c onion. Next time will add 1/4 white wine with chicken. Used one lg tomato but next time will use 2 drained cans Italian seasoned diced tomatoes. Will add olives, doubled lemon juice and feta and added more feta as garnish to top. I used a pound of farfalle pasta and with the amount of chicken (4 thin breasts) it was a good amount. I also added some dried basil since I didn't have the parsley. Good as written but when you grew up in Tarpon Springs you want REAL Greek tasting dishes!

This recipe was even better the next day!  I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh tomatoes, and would recommend adding either black or kalamata olives and doubling the feta cheese.

My fiancé who hates vegetables asks for this dish regularly, so that should say something. When I make this, if I am preparing it with pre-marinated artichokes like the recipe says I do not add the tablespoon of olive oil to keep the calories down. If I make it with un-marinated canned artichokes, then I add the tablespoon. There is actually a big difference in this recipe whether you use fresh parsley or just some from your spice cabinet. Go for the fresh! Thanks for the recipe.

YUMMY!!!  I thought this was fantastic.  I did as other reviewers suggested and dumped in a little of the marinade from the artichoke hearts.  Would definitely make this again.  Unfortunately I learned my hubby doesn't like artichokes in pasta (GASP!) so it won't be as frequent as I would hope.

This was really yummy! I didn't have any fresh ingredients, but it turned out great with jarred seasonings. The times are definately off...it took quite a bit longer than stated. I didn't use marinated artichoke hearts, but next time I will. I will also use a little bit more feta cheese.

Great recipe, but I was worried it would be a little bland so I used sundried tomatoes instead of diced fresh. It was a delicious addition. I used a jar of sundried tomatoes marinated in olive oil, and just sliced a few of the tomatoes. Next time I will use a few more, and dice them instead so they can be spread throughout the dish. Also, the chicken could use a bit more taste (though I am admittedly a bit heavy handed when it comes to seasoning) so next time I think I will try increasing the garlic. Also, like some other reviews said, there was way too much pasta, so I'll definitely cut back on that next time. Don't want to fill up on carbs when there's so much other yummy food! For presentation, try to save some feta and sprinkle it on top at the end.

Great flavor, but this turns out a little dry. I would do like others suggested and add some olive oil to the pasta or use the artichoke marinade to keep the dish from being so dry. I would also use less than 1 lb. of pasta.

After reading a lot of the reviews that made changes on this recipe, I was a little worried.  But I had a giant jar of artichoke hearts to use up, so I figured I'd try it.  I am so glad I did!  This was delicious.  The only thing I did differently was throwing in an extra tomato because I had it.  Between the lemon and the artichoke hearts and the feta, I have a hard time understanding how this could be bland.  I actually forgot to put in the oregano, and still felt it had great flavor.  Maybe if you used plain artichoke hearts instead of marinated, it would be bland.  At any rate, the whole family really liked this, and even the pickiest of the kids said it was really good.  We'll be making this again.  YUM!

SO delicious! I did make a few modifications.  Instead of draining the artichokes, I added the water/seasonings they were soaking in and I also added 1 cup of heavy whipping cream to keep it from getting so dry.  These two modifications were all it needed!  I have made this dish many times and still love it! Thanks for the recipe!

This is a very tasty dish that we will have again!  I halved it and maybe added a little more garlic than called for.  I also used some of the liquid from marinated artichoke hearts.  But otherwise, I followed the directions.  This is a wonderful, light pasta meal.  I agree with one of the reviewers who said that it is not supposed to have a thick sauce on the pasta.  Very tasty!LATEST REVIEW:  I think this would be best with half the pasta recommended.  I made the whole recipe tonight, and it seems that it just had too much pasta.  That could solve the problem of taste for most diners.

This recipe will be five stars when I make it next time. I will add another tomato and some chopped kalamata olives to give it extra tang, color and texture. I added some crushed red pepper and fresh oregano with the parsley, and it was so good that I look forward to making it again with the aforementioned changes.

This was soooo good! The lemon juice really makes it taste so fresh!  I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh and added olives. Definitely use the feta cheese, it's a nice delicate cheese and adds to the wonderful and authentic flavor of this dish. Everyone loved it...delicious!

I really loved this recipe.  I did make a few changes like the other reviewers, but kept the essence of the recipe intact.  I seasoned the chicken and cooked it separately before I added it to the onions and garlic.  I also added some sun dried tomatoes and a little of the oil from them.  I used a can of petite cut tomatoes instead of fresh, which made it a little more "saucy."  This dish had a wonderful flavor.  I will definitely make it again.

I've been using this site for years and have never rated a recipe however, I had to take the time on this one.  It was excellent. I used all of the juices from both the tomatoes and artichokes.  I added a little bit of corn starch mixed with water to thicken it up and let it simmer at the end. I also used more feta, olives, a few sundried tomatoes and lots of greek seasoning that you can find at the grocery store...it was really, really good!!!

This recipe was pretty good.  I do think it was a bit too 'lemony' for my taste and it may have been better with artichokes in water, but overall pretty good.

This was just OK, and I LOVE artichokes and feta. I followed the recipe exactly and didn't care for the taste ... it may be too heavy on the lemon, basil and parsley(?).  In any case, I probably won't give this one another try.

Very good but I use a good quality can of diced tomatoes - do not drain!  I normally saute the gralic and onions and artichokes - then add the can (1 or 2)of tomatoes and then a can of black olives and about half of the feta and let that simmer while the pasta boils.  Then drain pasta and toss with sauce and then add in the rest of the feta.  Serve...  Not dry at all!!!  YUMMY!!!

Followed recipe exactly.  Overall flavor was great; however, it was very dry.  Would make again and would possibly add the marinate the artichokes were in, or perhaps make a sauce using chicken broth and white wine.

This dish is great!
One key is that you must enjoy artichokes. 
I have tried a variety of pasta with the recipie. Angel Hair is my personal favorite.

This was very good; however, I prefer a little more of a sauce with my pasta.
I happened to have some jarred alfredo sauce that I used on the leftovers, but that was a little too overpowering for such delicate flavors.  I think a light, white wine sauce would compliment this perfectly.  It's a keeper!

This was so tasty. It was quickly put into the box of recipes that I'll make for company! Tasted just as good for lunch the following day, the only problem was there wasn't enough left!

This dish was very interesting. It was very good and unlike anything I've ever had before. I substituted black olives for the tomatoes. My whole family enjoyed this dish. Thanks!

This was a hit.  The next time I make it I will probably use artichoke hearts from a can rather than the jar, personally I just think the flavor is better.

Absolutely wonderful! I made some additions.  First, I used fresh Italian parsley, and added fresh baby dill (about 5 tbsp). I juiced 1/2 a lemon. I probably used about 1 cup of feta (I love feta!!!). I didn't add the oregano, it didn't seem to go with the dish to me. I made homemade pasta noodles. I also used small cherry tomatoes, halved. I did not add the salt, as I did not think it needed it, since feta is a salty cheese. Topped with fresh ground pepper!  I served the pasta separate. This dish would be great alone, or with some Greek lemony rice. DELICIOUS!!!

this was great! i'll probably try it with the green peppers next time. my husband hates artichokes and even he loved it! one note: half of the pasta is enough and it takes closer to an hour to make. i highly recommend this recipe.

Great recipe! Although, for those who do not like sour taste, I would suggest to omit the lemon juice.

This was good but fairly time-consuming with all the ingredients.  I think it can easily be customized to suit one's taste.  I made it with cherry tomatoes which were the best part!  I lookj forward to making it again when my cherry tomato plant produces this year!

Great flavor and very easy to make!   I substituted shallots for the red onion simply because that is what I had on hand.  I also used a 12 ounce package of pasta and it still seemed a bit too much.

Too much pasta in dish, perhaps only 12 oz pkg instead of 1 lb would make it better.

Lemon juice was too strong - will eliminate next time, and will try adding kalamata olives.  I liked everything else about the recipe - the moisture content was perfect, unlike some other reviewers.  Very impressive to serve.

This was quick, easy, and filling.  After reading some reviews about dryness, I added a can of diced tomatoes, which really helped.  It was not quite as flavorful as I like, though... something's missing, but I'm not sure what!

Really delicious.  Would make a nice, light summer dish.  Younger kids may not care for the flavor from the artichokes.

Loved it!! Hubby said that I have stumbled on to his new favorite dish 
Definitely add some sliced kalamata olives for flavor and also for color.  I used fresh tomato's and glad I did.  I upped the cheese a little and chose penne pasta.  Superb!

Following the recipe will result in a fairly "dry" pasta dish without much sauce.  Next time I would add several more fresh tomatoes or a can of tomatoes.  +

This is definitely a keeper.  I made some changes as suggested in other reviews like half of the pasta, using the liquid from the artichoke hearts etc.  There is still plenty left over for another meal.  This will be made often.

I really wanted to like this recipe but it turned out pretty bland and tasteless.  I used only 75% of the past expecting to get increased favor but instead got "nothing."  With all the other exceptional reviews, I went back over what I did and I made no mistakes.  So fellow reviewers, I know you want to be nice to the recipe author but you also have an obligation person that is reading your review to rate the recipes correctly.

This was delicious but I made a few changes based on reviews.  A few people said it was dry so I added about a quarter cup of lemon juice.  This made it a little more tangy, but we like it like that.  I also added a ladle of starchy cooking water from the noodles just before draining.  Just put it in a cup, then add it to the sauce with everything else when you the lemon juice.  
I sautéed mushrooms with the onions.....mmmm.
Added kalamata olives with the artichoke hearts.
Seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper and oregano.
I kept everything else the same and this was amazing!

This dish was delicious! I made it first with chicken and then after seeing how great it smelled kept going and made it again with shrimp. I made half the portion of each. I agree with other reviewers that adding the artichoke marinade gives it a lot more flavor!  I also ended up adding butter to the shrimp portion. Great recipe! Thank you so much :-)

We all loved it! I doubled the feta and added a bit of the marinade from the artichokes to suit our preferences. Even those that thought they weren't going to like it ended up getting seconds.

One of my family's favorites!  I make as directed, but I usually add about 1/2 can tomato paste to thicken it a bit and give a little more zing, and I season my chicken a bit.   
If you don't have a fresh tomato, a can of fire-roasted will do., though fresh is better! Also, boil your pasta in 50% water, 50% chicken stock if you have it to enhance the flavor.  If not, it is still great!  
I add the feta at the very end, just before serving.  
Great recipe!

Great as is - just tweek amounts to your preferences. I did add a little Cavender’s no-salt greek seasoning. We’ll be adding this to rotation.

This is sooo good! I've made it so many times and I'm pretty sure it's my new favorite food. I buy a big package of chicken thighs/breasts and bake and shred it beforehand, separate it out into little baggies and throw them in the freezer. Then I can just grab a bag out when I'm ready to make this. It makes it so fast and easy!  Make sure to use the marinated artichokes in the jar, not the cheaper canned ones... I've found they have a lot of tough/chewy pieces.  I use a can of diced italian tomatoes (not drained), and plenty of feta. I usually add in a little juice from the artichokes and a little from the kalamata olives.  I also use the "Garden Delight" pasta spirals. I prefer to eat this hot, but is delicious cold as well!

Absolutely amazing! Like others, I included the artichoke marinade along with using a whole can of diced tomatoes--not draining. This far surpassed my expectations and was bursting with wonderful flavor. This will be a routine meal in my home.

I have not cooked Greek before but this is definitely a great recipe to start with!  Loved it!

This was so delicious!! Like the other suggestions, we used canned diced tomatoes and added the juice along with the marinade from the artichokes. This made the pasta moist and the feta made it creamy. We also added kalamata olives and that made the dish. Definitely recommend!!

This is absolutely delicious. My husband is greek and expects alot  when it comes to his food and he was Very satisfied with this dish. I made it yesterday and he wants it again on the weekend. I added red peppers to it, added a nice flavour. Fresh kalamata olives are the Only way to go. I used grape tomatoes as I didnt think canned would do this recipe  justice. If you find it is getting dry add a bit more olive oil, lemon juice and the feta. Use a little of the artichoke juice and the brine of the feta as well.

Not much taste at all.  Weird the picture has olives in it but the recipe doesn't call for it.  I should have added kalamata olives.  Maybe it would have had more taste.  or spinach?  very dry and bland.

I made an account just to review this. It's amazing! Not only is it healthy but all the flavors come together so well when cooked, it's definitely pleasing to the palette. I did modify it a bit by adding some red bell peppers, and am quite satisfied. I definitely recommend this dish!

This is definitely a KEEPER.  Made it according to the recipe.  I did add some black olives because the photo shows them and my hubby loves them.  

We ate ALL of it, which doesn't always happen with new recipes.

Love this dish, and it makes for great lunches next day, served hot or cold.

I always add a touch more feta and kalamata olives for more flavor.

This was fantastic !! Easy to make and an absolute pleasure to eat ! Yum !! My wife couldn't stop raving about this dish. She said this was a restaurant quality dish. She then asked me to make this again this week !! Few slight changes to recipe. Used whole wheat farfale noodles instead of linguine, used chicken thighs instead of breast   (I picked up the wrong package at Wegmans!). used a little more Feta and red onion. Thats it. Oh, I did pour some of the artichoke marinade into the dish at the end for an extra coating. This one is a keeper !!

Loved it, but it was a bit dry so I made the following adjustments: lots of calamata olives, more tomatoes (~1/3-1/2 can undrained fire roasted are fine), a couple of spoonfuls of the artichoke marinade and extra feta sprinkled on top. Next time, I will leave more water clinging to the pasta.

I've made this recipe now a couple of times and it's great. Everyone, even the picky eaters in my family like this one. The only reason I give it 4 instead of 5 stars is because I felt that the recipe as is was a bit bland. I basically doubled up the garlic and oregano plus I also add spinach and extra feta. This is definitely a keeper for the recipe box!!

This was really tasty!  I found the recipe as written was lacking in flavor but then I added some chicken bouillon base and it was delicious!  This is a great, easy pasta.  I would definitely make this again with the added chicken bouillon.

So so delicious. Everything was just right; I added little more of the feta, but other than that, I didn't change a thing. Unlike some reviews, I do believe it was enough to serve 5-6. It is pasta, and one shouldn't eat too much of it. I served it with a couple of light appetizers (hummus with olives and cucumber, soup, and grape leaves), a side salad, and after, a light desert and 4 adults were more than full, with enough pasta left over for a light lunch.

The first time I made this recipe it was kind of bland. So I just tried it again and made some adjustments. I used an already cooked rotisserie chicken from the grocery store and shredded it. When I heated it up with the onion and garlic I used about half the jar of juice from the marinated artichokes to moisten it and give it flavor. I also added a few more spices to it. I also added black olives to it like it shows in the picture. I used a whole container of feta and cut the noodle amount just about in half. It still made plenty and my teenager went back for seconds. Great recipe!

This recipe has a great foundation for a tasty Mediterranean type dish.  However, I too had a problem with it being dry.  My family of four adults have big appetites (and love good left overs)and I double most every recipe that I make. Two pounds of pasta is ALOT OF PASTA!  I seasoned and sautéed the onions, chicken and garlic in butter & EVOO and chopped fresh tomatoes (if I'd had canned tomatoes, I'd have used them too, as they contribute extra juice and still plan on adding some..  I ended up adding a whole large can of ripe olives, sliced (because the pasta to meat/veggie ratio still seemed to be off)and used some reserved marinate from the artichoke hearts.  Even then, I had to use what I had on hand to correct the dry characteristic and used some tomato juice, which helped a lot. I also still plan to add another container of feta cheese.  We enjoyed it, but it's a work in progress and we'll probably be eating on it all week!!

Overall, delicious. The husband loved it. Only had elbow mac. Used 3 cloves garlic and minced them. Added a tbsp of butter to the olive oil for more flavor. Seasoned chicken with salt/pepper before saute. Added a spoonful of tomato paste for color and flavor. Added olives, only had small whole canned, but kalamata would have kicked it up a notch. Added a little extra feta and parsley for garnish. Will make again!

I was in a rush and used a few different things that I had in the  fridge and pantry. I used two 9 oz packages Perdue pre cooked chicken breast grilled Italian style. Skipped the artichokes (hate em') and used a can of original rotel and also 2 tomatoes I needed to get rid of. The lemons were Meyer lemons if that matters and the pasta I used was elbow Mac. All other ingredients I stuck to from original recipe. It tasted great!

Amazing! I followed the recipe, except that I used 1tbsp lemon juice instead of 2. Just not a fan of a lot of lemon in my food. Next time I think I will add kalamata olives. So good!

The whole family loved this! I put extra olives and feta on the table for anyone who wanted a bit extra added in :) Served with Garlic Bread. I also added a bit of the artichoke marinade in. Yummmy! When I told my kids I would be making this for company coming in a weeks time they began to argue about who would get the leftovers! Ha ha I think this is a keeper!!!!

Good recipe, family liked it.  Maybe add some spinach next time just to give it a little more flavor.  I don't think adding tomato sauce to it would be good but some of the other suggestions are worth looking at.

Pretty tasty. I followed other's suggestions and used a can of diced tomatoes and the liquid from the can of artichokes to make the sauce a little more wet. I also added some kalamata olives. If I make it again I'll probably use more red onion and splash in some white wine. Some grated kefalotiri cheese to top the pasta might be nice too.

This was good, but I think next time I would leave out the tomatoes and sprinkle the feta on top afterwards rather than stirring it in (the flavor got kind of lost among all the others). Quick and easy recipe that turned out pretty good, so thanks!

Everyone loved this dinner. Based on the reviews and my own personal taste I adjusted some things. I added a can of black olives and along with 3 chopped grape tomatoes I also added a can of garlic & olive oil chopped tomatoes. I also seasoned the chicken with greek seasoning. I added about 1/2 cup of heavy cream at the end.....It was soooo delicious.

I was looking forward to making this recipe, but I was NOT prepared for this!!! Oh my goodness this is AMAZING!!!! Like someone else said, this is definitely restaurant quality! I love the red onion taste - it adds to that Greek effect. There's not anything I don't like about this recipe. All I did differently was add a tablespoon of butter to my olive oil. You will be amazed with the delicious flavors in this pasta. I'm about to put it on the table and I'm expecting loads of complements! :D

We just made this recipe and it was not very good - it was very dry and there is no "sauce".  My husband said "Thank you for dinner BUT let's not make this again".  It was somewhat easy to make, but we will not be making it again!

I made this and it was wonderful  I used a combination of canned artichokes and marinated ones, and used half the amount of pasta.  I also added olives and used shrimp instead of chicken.  To those who thought is was too "lemony", that would be because the recipe is for canned artichokes so adding lemon is perfect.  If you are using marinated artichokes, omit the lemon.   I use dry greek seasoning in stead of just oreganno.  A nicer blend of greek flavours.  Save 1/2 c pasta water to add to eliminate the dryness.  Mine wasn't dry, but the sauce is just supposed to coat the pasta, not drown it.

Okay, I am admitting right up front I altered the recipe based upon my tastes and what I had on hand that needed to be used up.  The parts I changed are:  used 1/2 packet of dry italian dressing mix to season the raw chicken, substituted mushrooms and spaghetti squash for artichokes and pasta, eliminated lemon juice.  The feta I bought was kind of tart, so I didn't want any more with the lemon juice.  I added capers, because I love them.  Used the rest of the recipe ingredients.  I enjoyed the results.

This was a fantastic, light, and refreshing summer dinner.  My husband and I loved it!  It would also be great for potlucks or picnics.  We had PLENTY left over of which we ate for lunch the next day.  It was as good as reheated or cold leftovers, but it definitely a keeper!

Came across this recipe by random chance and it has become a total staple in this household.  It's super easy, quick and delicious.  We usually add in another tomato worth of tomato chunks to make up for the fact that my partner dislikes artichoke hearts and we don't put them in.  Other than that, just according to the recipe.  Awesome!

Don't forget to put kalamata olives on your shopping list too.  All in all a great, easy dish to make after work...

This was GREAT!!!   Usually when you see a recipe listed as healthy and lo-cal, you don't expect much, but you try it anyway.   This one was just amazing....thank you so much, Lalena, for creating something soooo wonderful and tasty, and watching out for our waistlines at the same time!

LOVED IT!!!!!  Even my picky eaters loved it as long as I didn't tell them about the artichoke hearts.  They didn't know and ate them happily...lol.  Put two servings in the freezer for another lunch.  I will have to see how freezer-friendly this is.  Also, I used whole wheat pasta cooked until it was soft (only way my kids will eat it) so it didn't have the grainy texture.

YUM!  While eating, my husband said "This is really good - you could serve this to company, it's like restaurant-quality" as a previous reviewer said.  I used canned tomatoes as real ones are pretty bad right now, with some juice included, along with black olives.  We also put a few red chili flakes in which added a little zing.  Next time, I'll use a clove or two more of garlic and see how that turns out.

Tasted good!  I would add more tomatoes next time. I would add the kalamata olives because I didn't this time.  I also used more feta cheese than the recipe called for.  Instead of adding the pasta to the mixture, I just put how much I wanted on top of my own serving of pasta.  I think that there was not enough of the mixture to blend with the amount of pasta the recipe called for.

This would have been perfect, a delicious meal...if they didn't say to mix everything in to the pasta. It ended up being only slightly flavorful pasta...but if I just topped each bowl of pasta with the chicken, feta, tomato, onion, garlic mixture, it would have been perfect. I know for next time.

I made this vegetarian but subbing the chicken for sliced mushroom. It was great! I also added half a yellow pepper, and the red olives. It was kind of sour though. I might lay off on the lemon next time.

This is very quick and just awesome.  I used what we had on hand -- 12 oz. tri-color spiral pasta, 2 tomatoes, 1 c chopped white onion, 3 garlic cloves, half a can of artichoke hearts, a little extra olive oil and lemon juice, dried spices, sea salt, and chicken sausage because we didn't have any chicken thawed.  It is AWESOME.  My elementary age kids are eating it up and I'm sure there won't be any leftovers!  Thanks for a delicious, super fast, and very easy to modify recipe!

YUMMY!  I took the advice of other cooks and added some of the marianate from the artichokes, and added black olives, however, I also added some chopped basil right before serving... I also salted and peppered the chicken before adding to the pan... no need to add more salt and pepper later.

Very good and easy.  I used light feta cheese and reduced the pasta to 5 cups of cooked and made a Weight Watchers friendly version.  Kids loved it too. Definitely part of the weeknight rotation.  I made it on Sunday and served it on Monday.

I made the recipe as stated with the exception of decreasing oregano in half.  Next time I would decrease the artichokes (less than 10 oz for sure), double the garlic, add sliced mushrooms, baby spinach leaves and more feta cheese.

This is delicious!  I do recommend adding a little of the cooking water from the pasta to prevent the pasta from drying too much.  The feta melts and makes a wonderful coating for the pasta and vegetables.  Yum!

We loved this pasta dish. I did not use the chicken (because I forgot to thaw it), but I doubled the garlic, the onion and used 3 large tomatoes. I also used the marinade from the artichokes and added about a quarter cup of capers and a half cup of chopped Kalamata olives. To keep the pasta from being dry, I added about 1 cup of the pasta water back into the dish. Oh, I skipped the oregano just because I didn't notice it until I was finished but it was great without it. The feta melted and just made a wonderful coating for the angel hair. Next time I will use the chicken too. Thank you Lalena

LOVED this!! My husband and son really liked it too which is good lol but I really loved it. The only thing I did different was not adding feta cheese only because I didn't have any and I'm sure that would have made it even better but my husband isn't a fan of feta. But I did everything else as written and it was just so good!!  **update** I was able to get this started before DH got home and I added the feta without telling him - he liked it so much better (we all did) so I told him after and he laughed, so we'll have this with the feta from now on :)

Very tangy.  I followed the recipe almost exactly, except I used canned diced tomatoes instead of fresh ones since that's what I had in the pantry.  I also used marinated artichoke hearts - so they may have added a bit more flavor to the meal.  Overall it's super tasty.  I'll be making this again!

Love it!!  I modified it a bit though.  I added mushrooms and asparagus pieces to the saute mixture and seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, pakrika, and italian seasoning before cooking.  I used a can of italian style diced tomatoes instead of fresh, and added about 1/4 cup of marinara.  Delicious!  Even my 3 year old said it was "yummy."

Great beginning-not enough chicken for my family's liking and we added fresh spinach which added some deliciousness to the meal.

I used canned chopped tomatoes, because the fresh tomatoes were out of season.  Next time I think I will add some mushrooms.  It was a easy and yummy dish!

This is so good. I'm not a fan of this kind of food, and was afraid it was going to be overpowering, but it was fantastic. My 8 year old and 5 year old ate it up...and my husband is in love =) I used marinated artichokes, added just a little bit of the marinade, and then added some cream at the very end. Thanks for this great recipe!

Really good! Some nice additions: shredded meat from a rotisserie chicken, about 2 cups uncooked chopped spinach (saute with the other veggies), ~1/4 cup balsamic vinegar, 1 tablespoon good pesto, and a red or yellow bell pepper (chopped) for color. I also used whole wheat pasta.  This was a great meal. The flavors were very complementary and the dish was nice and light. I will definitely make this again. Thanks so much for sharing!

WARNING: This is a HUGE amount of food. If I could give it 3.5 stars, I would. The flavor was good, but not over the top delicious. I used 1/2 box of pasta, and it was too much. I may make this again, but there would definitely have to be some changes.

I loved this recipe!!!  I am a big fan of greek flavors and this one hit on them perfectly.  I did add kamalata olives and was glad that I did.  Next time I make this I will use a little of the marinade from the artichokes to keep it from being too dry.  But it was SO good and we will be making it for many dinners to come!!!!

Made this last night and it was wonderful!  I used a 10 oz jar of marinated artichoke hearts (only size the store had) and a 4 oz package of feta cheese.  I also forgot the oregano (my wife says no harm done there, as she doesn't like it).  I think next time around I'll cut down on the amount of pasta (used a pound of penne) just to have a higher ratio of fixings to pasta.  I'm also going to throw in some black olives!  Great recipe, Lalena!

Very light and plain, but good that way.  Make sure you have a little extra feta cheese on hand to sprinkle over the top before serving.

Made it "vegetarian" ... added a head of diced broccoli with the veggies instead of chicken. Used tortellini for the pasta. I also used a can of diced tomatoes since that's what i had on hand. I drained the juice into the onions to reduce ... then went on as with the original. YUM

UPDATE: MADE THIS TONIGHT, BUT THIS TIME I FOLLOWED LALENA'S DIRECTIONS TO THE LETTER - EXCEPT I USED MEDITERANNEAN FLAVORED FETA INSTEAD. MY ONLY SUGGESTION IS TO HALVE THE AMOUNT OF PASTA CALLED FOR (1 LB. IS FAR TOO MUCH, IMHO). I MUST ADMIT, I PREFER SAUCIER PASTA DISHES, BUT ON A HOT SUMMER DAY (THE THERMOMETER TOPPED 100 DEGREES TODAY), I REALLY APPRECIATE THE SIMPLICITY OF A LIGHT, FRESH ENTREE LIKE THIS. THE BONUS? YOU DON'T HAVE TO HEAT UP YOUR OVEN TO MAKE IT! :) Summer is coming to a quick end. :( This dish allowed me one last chance to take advantage of all the wonderful fresh ingredients available. Although I enjoyed this, I did find it necessary to make a few changes. Because so many reviewers warned that this was bland as written, I decided to marinate my chicken for a few hours using a favorite souvlaki recipe of mine (on this site - by Abby Benner). In retrospect, I wish I would have left this as is.... A generous sprinkling of Greek seasoning would have done the trick (and involves less work!). My other changes were to use only 1/2 the amount of artichokes called for (my fiance doesn't care for them, so I used less rather than omitting them alltogether) and add all of the marinade from the jar to my pasta. Warm pita wedges and hummus completed our simple meal. Thanks for sharing, Lalena. :-)

Really good and healthy!  I did use whole wheat penne for the added healthiness, and as many others did added juice from the artichokes.  Needed quite a bit of seasoning but the end result is delicious!

There wasn't anything flavorful or tasty about this dish. I usually like these kinds of dishes but this one lacked a lot. If I were to make it again, I would add more spices or something to take it up a couple notches.

I hesitated to make this because I wasn't sure if it would be "flavorful" enough...boy was I wrong! This is a perfect example of a really satisfying delicious meal that's also light & healthy.  The only thing I did different was to use a 14oz can of diced tomatoes instead.  The flavor combinations in this dish are fabulous and I will definitely make this again!

Mmmm, this was delicious!  I didn't have any tomatoes so I just threw in a small can of tomato sauce.  I also only had artichokes in water so I added a little bit of Italian dressing to the pan as well.  Half of my kids liked it and half didn't, but that's pretty typical. :)  Will definitely make this one again!

This recipe was wonderful! I loved the fresh lemon flavour along with the feta cheese.

This was easy and quick and very delicious!  I marinated the chicken in Greek dressing for a few hours.  I used canned tomatoes instead of fresh since that is what I had.   Those were my only changes.  We both loved it and will make again.

I think this recipe would've been very dry if I'd followed it.. but I suppose that's what's great about recipes like this... you don't have to follow them.  I didn't have any tomatoes so I put some left over red sauce (1/2 Cup) in it instead and it tasted pretty good.

This is one of the best recipes I've ever found. I have given the recipe to friends, and their families love it as much as we do. The only changes I make are that I add about 1/2 c. chicken broth and one red pepper.

FANTASTIC!! This is comparable to my favorite dish at the Cheesecake Factory (Evelyn's pasta). I changed/added a few things: added butter to the olive oil for sauteeing the chicken (skipped the onions - bleh). Added fresh chopped broccoli and sliced up some pitted kalamata olives and added to the skillet with the tomatoes and artichokes. I used drained/diced tomatoes (they are out of season). I was generous with the lemon juice and herbs. This has such a yummy and tangy flavor. I had no need to add juice from the canned artichokes or tomatoes. The 'sauce' is supposed to be a very light herby/tangy oil. 

My anti-vegetable boyfriend actually went back for seconds (a rarity).

I made this with pheasant breast. (My husband hunts.) It was wonderful! I used canned diced tomato instead of fresh, and dried parsley instead of fresh. I did add the kalamatas. Definitely a keeper!!!

This was really good. Made it just as recipe said except used a whole container of feta and added some grated parmesan and olive oil at the end. Also threw in some green beans. It made a a lot! I also prepared some red sauce, but no one used it as it didn't need it. Will make again! Thanks!

This is yummy! My husband especially liked it and he is into foreign and ethnic foods. I would suggest adding a small can of tomato sauce and maybe using less than a whole pound of pasta. Either way, this is a very tasty dish.

Another fantastic recipe! If you love greek food and pasta, you'll love this dish! A great recipe for dinner guests...it's easy to prepare everything you need ahead of time, and then a quick 10 minutes of cooking and it's done!  I added orange and green peppers for color, and also added a couple of tablespoons of the marinade from the artichoke hearts. mmmm mmmm good! Also added more olive oil just before taking it out of the pan. More flavor and less dry.  Enjoy!

I can't in good conscience give this dish more than three stars. It just isn't good if you make it according to the directions. If you tweak it like others suggest, you'll come out with a pretty good dish, but make sure you do a lot of tweaking. 

I suggest adding the kalamata olives, extra artichokes (and the juice from their marinade, extra feta, and something to thicken up the sauce. I used tomato sauce and the juice from  a can of diced tomatoes, but I like the idea of heavy cream.

I was so excited to try this recipe after all the rave reviews, however I was severely disappointed. The chicken had no flavor whatsoever and the sauce was watery. I will not make this one again.

My husband and I absolutely loved this!  I followed the recipe except, as suggested by someone else, used a can of diced tomatoes including juice, and it was delicious.  I included the feta when cooking, and added a little more on top when served.  Will definitely add to my rotation.  Thanks.

Made this last night for my family - they all enjoyed it.. even my picky 5-year old. Was easy to make, tasted light and fresh.. but it was very filling! Great with crunchy bread. We'll be making it again, my husband suggested that next time we add sundried tomatoes... so I think we may try it that way.. but this recipe is wonderful as is! Thanks for sharing!

Good base recipe. I also added the marninade with the artichokes and a can of undrained tomatoes. I left out the onions and used angel hair pasta. It was good, but my whole family agrees it was better the next day.

Very tasty.  I skipped the pasta, and scaled down the recipe to a 1 serving size.  The combination of artichoke hearts, tomato, feta cheese,  and lemon juice was great.  I will make this again.

I tried this recipe, as my husband is half Greek. He raved about it! Only thing different is I added a cream sauce, since my husband prefers thick sauces on pasta. I put all of the seasonings in the sauce to make sure everything mixed well. It was absolutely perfect!

My husband could not get enough of this recipe. In fact he didn't leave any leftovers for me! 
I listened to advice and added some tomato paste to thicken up the sauce... I don't think I will do that next time. It added a strange flavor that I didn't really like. Maybe instead I will try just some tomato sauce, or I will add less noodles, because it is a bit dry.
Other than that, this recipe is great! I'll definitely be making it again! Delish!

Just made this tonight and we really enjoyed it.  I added a chopped red pepper when I added the chicken and about a 1/2 package of sliced fresh mushrooms when the chicken was almost done b/c I had them on hand.  I added the marinade from the artichokes and some extra chopped chokes.  Since some of the reviews said this was dry, I added about 1/2 - 3/4 cups of the pasta cooking water which I added about 1-2 tablespoons of tomato paste to...turned out GREAT!!!  Thanks for posting!

I used 2 tomatoes, and 4 cloves of garlic. I didn't really measure my onion or pasta exactly but I used the better part of a medium/large red onion, and also an additional sweet onion. (I like onions). I used a full box of penne. As a special addition I added a touch of spinach. It turned out amazing! I was really pleased with this recipe, and definitely plan to make it again. I plan to attach a photo.

I was a little skeptical at first- but hubby wanted something 'healthier' than normal and I had what it took to make this... I changed it a lot though. I used leeks instead of red onions because I had some left over, 2 crushed garlic and 2 small chopped garlic cloves, add lots of red crushed peppers and some red pepper olive oil. I also used whole canned tomatoes chopped up and added their juice in the can, the artichoke juice and a little bit of white wine and tiny bit of milk to thicken it up. I also added some pieces of yellow and green zuchinni to liven it up a bit.
I changed a lot, but it was SOOOOOOO good. I don't even like Greek food and I couldnt stop eating it!

This was good, and easy.  I liked it, but dont know if I liked it enough to make it again.  Per the suggestions I added Kalamata olives, which really livened up the flavor.

Very bland.  I probably won't make it again, but if I did, I would use a lot less pasta and a lot more spice.

I liked this, but only if you follow what the reviews say. Add the juice from artichokes, and tomatoes if you use canned, add Greek Olives and cut the pasta b half. Way TOO much pasta!

This was wonderful.  My boyfriend normally hates feta cheese and artichokes.... but I made this anyway because, I happen to LOVE Greek-style food.  Much to my surprise, he fell in love with it as much as I did!  He's constantly bugging me to make it again. Great recipe.

i really liked this pasta salad... but i made it my own. i made half a pound of penne- 2 tbsp. olive oil and added garlic... used a can of halved tomatoes because i dont like how the skin kind of peels off when you cook fresh ones. i added half a can of quartered artichokes and let them stew in the tomato juice. also used left over chicken and cut it up to throw into the pan. i just squeezed half a lemon into the sauce and added salt and pepper. added the pasta and poured into seperate bowls. added the feta and more lemon into individual bowls. turned out reeeeaaaalllllyyyy good.

I found this recipe somewhat bland, however has the potential to be more flavourful easily.  Next time I would double the feta cheese, and add tomato sauce or paste (as suggested by another reviewer).  I also added some red pepper and herb spices as well which added a bit of a kick.  Not a bad recipe at all.

I changed this recipe a lot- maybe that's why we didnt like it. But I thought it would be way to dry as written. First, I marinated the chicken in the artichoke marinade, plus the oil from a jar of sun-dried tomatoes. When making the sauce, I grilled the chicken on a stove-top grill pan, added 1/2 jar of chopped sun-dried tomatoes to the sauce, chopped olives, the marinade from the chicken, chopped fresh spinach and a can of diced tomatoes. Sad to say it came out just basically like a tangy non-traditional spaghetti sauce. Not a favourite.

This is the first thing in years I have made which I can honestly say that I did not like at all. I tried some of the suggestions and added some of the marinade from the artichokes and zested it up a little,and it just smelled awful while it was cooking! It tasted better than it smelled, but that's not exactly the picker upper that most people think it would be.

I would give 5 stars with my adaptions-My husband absolutely loves this.  I used probably triple the garlic and onion, some red pepper flakes, also added a can of chicken broth and some white wine to the sauce and reduced. Added fresh torn basil and oregano at end. Tossed feta with cooked pasta and sauce before serving.  This is our favorite pasta dish!

This was great!  It has a great flavor, it smells great while cooking and it's just as good the next day.  It was easy to prepare too.  I was afraid early in the recipe that it would be bland, but I was proven wrong when it all came together.  I did it all in my big cast iron dutch oven.  I didn't change a thing in the recipe but I didn't use the lemons as garnish, I forgot.  This was really good and we'll be making it again!

Really yummy, easy to make.  I took the marinade from the artichoke jar, and marinated the chicken pieces first for about half hour before cooking.

This was absolutely delicious! I am a disaster when it comes to preparing chicken, but I followed directions and the chicken was moist, tender and fantastic. This was an 11th hour dinner and I found the recipe on the ingredients search. The household gives it two thumbs up. I did not have artichoke hearts to add, but I enjoyed it just the same. The flavor was light and perfect for summer. I shocked myself with how tasty I found the first bite of the finished dish. The prep took me considerably longer than 15 minutes (again, I'm not so handy with the chopping) but I found the end product well worth it. I'm equally excited to see how the leftovers stand up for lunch tomorrow!

I made this three or four times with half the pasta and it was good. then I started doing it with canned tomatoes in olive oil and garlic and it really added something to the recipe. I definitely recommend using canned tomatoes over "fresh" tomatoes from the grocery store. Who knows how fresh those things are anyways...

My husband and I really liked this dish.  However, I added kalamata olives which gave a burst of flavor I believe it needed.  I think it would have been somewhat bland without them.  After reading the other reviews, I only used 1/2 of the cooked penne pasta and it was plenty!  Also, there's no real sauce to this dish and the advice to add a bit of the artichoke liquid really helped.  Even for just half the pasta.

I love this recipe. I agree that a pound of pasta is way too much. I probably used about 1/2 a pound. If you need to make a pound for a larger group, I would double the rest of the ingredients. Because the other reviewers talked about how dry this recipe can become, I added a small bit of pasta sauce-just enough to coat the noodles. My oldest son is not a pasta fan and he ate to plates full of this!

I started to make this and realized that I didn't have a tomato, but I had a can of stewed tomatoes so I chopped those up instead of the fresh tomato.  I also used fat-free feta cheese- which melted fairly well.  I really liked this dish- thanks for the recipe!

Like some of the other reviewers have said, I, too, will use less pasta next time.  I used a pound of farfalle and the there just wasn't enough "sauce" for a pound of farfalle. I even used about 4 Tbs of olive oil rather than one and there still wasn't enough to cover the pasta thoroughly.  The flavor was pretty good, but when I ate some for lunch today, I added some olive oil so that it wasn't so dry. Next time, I will also use more parsley, more tomatoes, and will use kalmata olives as others have suggested.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was really good! And filling to boot. I used 2 ounces of pasta per serving and 3 ounces of chicken per serving, instead of the amounts given in the recipe. I also used whole wheat pasta. Other than that, all it needed was a few extra spices for zip, my own preference!

Excellent, with a few changes....  I added an 8 oz can of pasta sauce, just cause I felt like a more saucey pasta.  I through in mushrooms for fun and I used reduced-fat feta.  The sauce was absolutely delicious!  However, I would recommend only using 12 oz of pasta--there were waaaay too many noodles and I think it overpowered the sauce a bit.  Plus, it seemed to serve at least 8, haha.  But, all in all it was very tasty!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  This is not too high on the fat content.  The only thing I did different was puree the fresh tomato since my husband doesn't care for them.  I also added some sliced black olives.  Very very yummy.  Great leftover too!

This was so tasty, to make this a bit healthier I used reduced fat feta and Barilla whole grain omega-3 rotini pasta. My boyfriend's exact words were "This is a winner, put this in your recipe box as a keeper". Now that's what we like to hear.

This was pretty good! It wasn't as flavorful as I had hoped, so I added a couple tablespoons of balsamic vinagrette. Delicious!! Nice mix of color and flavors. Next time I will add some kalamata olives too.

I just made and ate this, and it was pretty good.  I used medium egg noodles and added extra feta cheese because I love feta cheese.  I didn't have any fresh parsley or dried oregano on hand, so I used my Italian seasoning mix instead (bottle says "made with spices including thyme and oregano).  And no artichokes for me.  I also forgot to add salt and pepper, but it was good enough that I didn't really need it anyway (although I'll add a little salt and pepper when I eat the leftovers).  I also didn't use 1 lb. of pasta; I used a little less than that.  It was a little on the dry side; next time I'll add a little more olive oil (or some other liquid, like water or lemon juice).  Overall, pretty good and I'd definitely make it again.  Seems like a nice, light, healthy meal.

Loved it! Easy and very good! I used a bow tie pasta so it would be easier for a child to eat. Can't wait to eat the  leftovers tomorrow!

I was on a greek food kick a couple of years ago when I first tried this recipe and it has been a favorite since.  Definitly put some kalamata's in it! Had some friends over the other night and made this recipe again, funny thing was, one of my buddy's was on his 3rd helping when the ingredients was mentioned. He dislikes artichokes and said that he didn't eat any. . .yah rite!

This was very good. I had to make a few substitutions. I doubled the garlic; used one can of mostly drained diced tomatoes instead of a fresh tomato; I used canned artichokes; and I used about a half pound of whole wheat spaghetti. Also, I didn't have chicken breasts, so I used a large can of chunk chicken. I just added it with all the other ingredients to warm. I've never done this before, but being a new mom has led me to try many new ways of simplifying things! For the amount of time it saved, it wasn't too bad. My husband still compared the meal to eating at a restaurant. I also mixed in kalamata olives, and served with extra feta. I will definately make this again!

This was lacking in flavor.  Also, a pound of pasta was way too much.  I used angel hair pasta, and it was VERY dry.  I kept reading the recipe to make sure I made it correctly.  May try to make again, doubling the garlic, adding some olives, and more olive oil.

Great recipe!  My boyfriend actually made it.  Use juice from 2 whole lemons and add more tomatoes.  He also used whole wheat pasta and non-marinated artichokes, which reduces the fat content and makes it a bit healthier :)  Hope he makes it again!

I love this refreshing recipie.  Next time I think I will not use marinated artichokes and see how it turns out.  I always use feta with basil and tomatoe, it adds a nice tuch.

I made this wonderful dish for dinner tonight and was pleasantly surprised. It was delicious! I added extra lemon juice, and a couple pinches of cilantro and basil too. I made penne for the pasta. Since I had no marinated artichokes, I substituted marinated mushrooms. Yumm! I also used canned, diced tomatoes since I had no fresh ones on hand. I used the idea of adding a few slices of kalamata olives, and was glad I did. It added a nice extra taste to the dish, as well as another color too. My boyfriend loved all the flavors in this dish too and said it was a keeper! Thanks Lalena!

I thought the main ingredients to this recipe were great...I would change the process though.  Instead of adding the pasta into the topping mixture, I would leave it separate.  Also, Fettucini was not the best choice for pasta...next time I will probably go with Penne.  I liked the lemon flavor and ended up putting in 1 1/2 times the amount called for.  All together a good recipe though!

Excellent, used as a side dish to grilled t-bone steaks, salad, bread, and grilled corn on the cob. Used fresh tomatoes from our garden - yum! Here are modifications only because I didn't have the ingredients: no chicken (didn't want it), used yellow onions, no artichoke hearts, no parsley, no lemon juice or lemons. It was a very light, tasty side dish - perfect!!

I give this 5 stars and my husband says 4 stars (so I win since I'm putting in this review!). I LOVED this recipe! I skipped serving with pasta and next time will substitute rice - we're not big pasta eaters - we prefer rice. Anyway, it had great flavor and was even good the next day! I will make this again! Thanks!

I loved this dish because it was different from the ordinary pasta dishes we are used to. There are so many layers of flavor and you can add or take away ingredients without compromising the taste.  We do not like Feta so I used Parmesan instead and added lots of chopped sun dried tomatoes and black olives.  1 pound of pasta would have been too much in my opinion, so I cut it down to only a 1/2 a pound. At the end, I mixed in some of the oil from the sun dried tomatoes to give it a little more moisture.  Overall, this is one of my favorite pasta dishes and I urge those of you who like lots of "flavor" to try this.  Many thanks Lalena.

This was the worst thing I have ever tasted!  My husband and I hated it.  Do not waste your effort to make this.  It takes longer than 15 minutes for prep time.  I even tried listening to the suggestions that other people gave and it still was very tasteless.

Love, love love this recipe.  I make it pretty much according to the directions, but I add more red onion and garlic.  I put half the feta in with the dish and then sprinkle the rest on after it's served because I like the texture of unmelted feta cheese.  Super easy and good enough for company!

As a lover of artichoke, feta and chicken, I was really looking forward to this.  However, I found that there was something missing. Won't be making again.

This was really good!  Instead of a tomato, I used a can of petite diced tomatoes.  I am not a fan of marinaded artichokes, but it really made the dish!  I agree with the reviewer who said the feta cheese made it!!  Delicious!

This was great.  The only thing I did differently was to add 50% more tomato - and allow the chicken/artichoke/tomato mixture to simmer for 6-8 minutes before tossing in the hot pasta and feta at the very end.  That allowed the ingredients to blend more.

Very good!!! I added some sun-dried tomatoes, bell peppers and more feta. My husband and I loved it, although next time I will leave out some of the lemon, it was a little overpowering. We can't wait to make it again. Next time I may use shrimp instead of the chicken. This will become a recipe in regular circulation at our house!

Yummy, yummy, yummy.  This dish was fantastic.  It was very easy to make and delicious, all in one.  For those of you who are "boycotting" pasta because you are on one of those diets - you don't know what you are missing!

I thought this was good, but it makes a lot. I cut the amount of pasta in half, and thought it was a good chicken-veggie-pasta ratio. I prefer the consistency of feta cheese that is not melted, so I just sprinkled it on top, with the olives, instead of mixing it into the dish. It could use some more garlic, onion and lemon juice to give it stronger, Greek flavor. A good dish with everything in one - starch, veggies and meat.

I served the pasta & sauce separately on the table, so you could take how much you wanted, instead of mixing them together ahead of time.  My husband liked this more than I did but he likes dishes that have more sour flavors.  I think the dish was too dry & I only used 1/2 a lb. of whole wheat pasta.  As some reviewers suggested, a can of diced tomatoes (which I would not drain) and/or some white wine might have made it better.

I chose this recipe because my boyfriend loves both artichokes and chicken. He was very impressed with the flavour and the unusual combination of ingredients and even I loved the dish albeit I am not that keen on neither feta cheese nor artichokes. We have made the dish several times since. It's quick, easy and absolutely delicious - especially if you reduce the amount of pasta and add some extra spice with herbs, pepper and spice mix!

Definitely a keeper.  Added more garlic and Kalamata olives and sun-dried tomato sauce. I agreed with other reviewers that more tomato would be good.  Think I'll add some white wine next time too as it is a little dry.  Nice tang to it and very elegant.

This review is overrated. I made it for guests and it turned out to have too many ingredients to really create a distinctive taste -- it ended up as a jumbled group of ingredients that tasted too bland. (I added the olives).

Even though this recipe has some of my favorite ingredients, it was missing something.  It also had a bizzare "tang" to it.  Will not make again.

We made this for dinner the other night. We did it exactly like the recipe called for. It was ok. Kinda bland. The leftovers the next day were awful!! Dry and bland. Typically pasta dishes are great the next day. Not this one.

Amazing simple recipe. I just subbed out regular tomatoes for sun-dried tomatoes - I think it kicks it up a notch. I already had grilled seasoned chicken prepped so this was an even easier dish to prepare.

This dish was excellent! The only ingredient I was missing was fresh tomatoes. I substituted a can of diced tomatoes, including the juice. I also added sliced black olives, only because I enjoy them. I would recommend this dish all day long!

This was Wonderful. It came together very easily and quickly. And my spouse loved it. The flavors of the feta and the artichoke really got raves. And it was a nice difference from our usual pasta dishes--no heavy sauce! Filling but good for summer.

Very dry. Maybe I should have not drained the marinade.  5-6 mins for the chicken was too long though I should have paid more attention to it. If I make it again, definitely will add more liquid.

The only thing I did different was add more feta cheese and kalamata olives.  My husband loved it but said a little more sauce would make it better.

Made it per recipe except used canned tomatoes (drained) and a little more feta cheese. My husband and 2 teenage boys liked it a lot, went back for seconds and thirds. I used linguine but will try a different pasta next time. It was good with the linguine.

Yummy! I started cooking the chicken first after marinating it in some spice and oil, then added the onion and garlic so they wouldn't get overdone. I didn't have tomatoes on hand but did add a couple of heaping teaspoons of tomato paste as well as some of the artichoke liquid. Nice pasta dish!

This was just ok for us.  I followed the directions, and felt it needed more sauce.  I served on top of orzo rather than mix the orzo in, as I prefer less pasta, and my husband prefers more.  This is basically the same recipe as another on this website (Greek penne and chicken), which calls for less oregano, which I would have preferred.  I may try it again with some modifications.

This turned out really well, though it dried out rather quickly.  I tossed some chicken broth over the leftovers before refrigerating.  I do not like feta and garlic, but the SO does, so I made this as specified!  

I really liked it a lot!  So did he!  It's on our list of keepers.  Thank you!

Very tasty and great for something really different.  I added a small can of  black olives, dried basil, garlic salt, about 1/2 C of the pasta water,  and a 1/2 can of diced tomatoes. I used whole grain penne pasta.  Everything else I kept the same.
I loved the mixture of feta cheese with the lemon.  It is a keeper for sure!   Thank you!

This came out great!! I followed the recipe exactly except I didn’t have elbow noodles so I used whole wheat rotini. And I added a bit of fresh spinach because I needed more vegetables. I thought I would have leftovers for lunch,  because usually my picky husband isn’t big on pasta, but he ate 3 servings! This was a big hit. Definitely will make this again.

Pretty good recipe.  Next time will marinate the chicken in greek dressing to add more flavor.  The sauce is very good otherwise.  Thanks for the recipe!

We like it. Made according to the recipe.  I cooked the chicken on medium and it accumulated a lot of juice. Probably from being injected with extra water during processing.  I think this would have been better if the flavors were more concentrated.  Next time, I'll make sure the juices reduce by cooking on a higher temp.   Also, my family isn't a fan of marinated artichoke (silly people) so next time I'll use un-marinated artichokes and add just a little red wine vinegar to get the bit of tang the artichokes contributed.

I normally do not do reviews however I needed to express my disappointment in this recipe. I followed the recipe and the reviews. Although I followed suggestions...there was absolutely no favor to this recipe!! Hopefully the leftovers will have some flavor! I spent way too much money to make this pasta for absolutely NO taste! Will not make again!

Used this recipe with young, new cooks. We got to practice knife skills, measuring and multitasking. The meal was delicious! The only adjustment we made was to add some pasta water to the dish to help loosen the sauce.

I used Rotini pasta in lieu of linguine. Strictly a personal choice but also
to capture the sauce more. Very delicious and just the right balance of saltiness with the feta  and olive combination.

This is the best pasta I have had in a while. Simple is better sometimes and this was so simple my husband made it....And the best part is that you can put whatever you want in. Don't like artichoke then try broccoli, cauliflower, asparagus, mushrooms, and even change up the meat or even remove it and put tofu in.  I have given this 5 stars not because it was perfect but because anyone can easily make it perfect for them. This is a new staple for me. Lalena your a goddess.....

This is really good and tastes so healthy! I added olives and used reduced fat Feta. Fantastic! Next time I'll probably add the artichoke marinade to the dish for some extra zest.

My family and I thought this recipe was excellent and very tasty. We buy artichoke hearts in large jars so I had to find out how many in a 14 ounce can. With research, I found the count to be 6-8 artichoke hearts, so I used 9 of them chopped and also added a couple tablespoons of the liquid in the artichoke jar.  I added about 1/3 cup of chopped Kalamata olives, and used on undrained can of diced tomatoes with garlic, oregano, and basil instead of a fresh tomato. For everything else, I followed the recipe as stated.  I used farfalle (bowtie) noodles since these are easier for my mother to eat. This recipe was very flavorful, and the feta cheese melted into the sauce.  For us, the recipe was enough for 5 as we had enough for 2 leftover that I froze for use as a side dish later. I will definitely be making this again and will likely double the recipe to have enough for two meals. I may also leave the artichokes and olives in larger pieces instead of chopping them.

I made this recipe as written, adding sliced kakamata olives as suggested by the submitter's remarks  above the list of ingredients.  The olives gave a much needed punch to the flavor, but one pound of pasta was too much for the amount of sauce.  As I was folding in the pasta I omitted about two cups iof it, because I felt that there was simply too much of it.  I will make this again but will either double the sauce or use only 8 oz.  versus 16 oz. of pasta.  After tasting the dish, I added another half cup of feta cheese  to enhance the flavor--roughly a 6 oz. container.  Offering wedges of lemon to enhance  the flavor was a good idea of the author's also.

Versatile, can be served hot or cold with grilled veggies and cooked protein. I used rotisserie chicken but could easily use grilled shrimp or sausage.

Wow!  This was delicious. I made a couple of changes based on other reviewers - I used marinated artichokes with a little bit of the oil marinade and I added kalamata olives. I followed the recipe exactly beyond that.

Unfortunately the lemon I thought I had for this recipe had gone a little old by the time I was ready to use it. So I had to use lemon juice from the jar which I think was also expired.  So the strong lemon taste of this meal might be my own fault.  Hubby liked and I will try it again with real fresh lemons.  It was good, just a little more lemony then I usually like.

My changes were minor and my guests raved about this entrée.  I used orzo instead of linguini pasta.  I used marinated artichokes and Kalamata olives.  
By the way, this recipe is easily "veganized".  The vegan version included quinoa instead of pasta; firm tofu instead of chicken; and no cheese.  Everyone loved both dishes!

The inclusion of black olives is a must, for added texture and a bite of a saltier taste.  Two tablespoons of lemon juice made it too lemony for me, I would reduce it next time, plus add some  fresh black pepper.  Those are personal choices, overall a good basic, easy recipe.

This turned out well the first time -- a good taste. I wasn't sure about the artichoke hearts, but they tasted good. I put the feta cheese directly on the chicken before adding the vegetables. Next time, I would use less pasta.  Definitely season the chicken with salt and pepper before cooking.

This dish was wonderful!  I took some short cuts that may have added more flavor.  I used a lemon pepper rotisserie and I had an artichoke salad in my pantry as well.  I still put the artichoke hearts in, however, they were not marinated.

I always look at reviews and did add mushrooms, like others had recommended, and I used a can of Rotel tomatoes instead of a real tomato.  I like some heat, so I also used Extra Spicy Mrs. Dash, along with garlic pepper and salt, and used a little italian seasoning instead of just oregano.

Amazing dish that has become one of my favorites!

Liked it a lot. Added about 1/3 c artichoke marinade. Could have used a bit more. Used petite diced tomatoes with the juice. Picture does not match recipe. No olives called for.

I added broccoli instead of Artichoke Hearts due to unavailability. Good swap! The dish was tasty though I would say it could do with a little extra spice, due to myself not using salt in my cooking, so some extra spices would alleviate this. I would also add one or two more tomatoes in future.

So easy to make, 2 dishes (that's the real come-on!) and if you don't have Kalamata olives, stuffed green olives will work great too.  The feta cheese really brought out the flavor of the artichoke hearts and tomatoes (even tomatoes in the dead of the Northeast winter!)
Definitely going to make this again!

We found this too dry, really needed some kind of sauce.  The flavors were good and I liked the combination.

I love this recipe.  Simple and fun to put together.  I cook for myself only but it reheats well.  I added a little Greek yogurt when I had the leftovers to make it creamy.

This dish was very good and a great variation on chicken and pasta.  I followed the recipe exactly other than using canned diced tomatoes.   The flavor is a little heavy on the oregano, but I found it nice and tasty.  It's great with calamata olives.

It was very tasty. I used a can of Italian diced tomatoes (with basil, garlic and oregano). I think next time I make it, I'll only use half of the box of pasta, or two cans of tomatoes. It seemed to make more than four servings, unless the servings are supposed to be giant sized!

This was okay, but not quite the taste I had in mind. Maybe there were too many artichokes... Anyway, I made this exactly per recipe, it was interesting, but the kids hated it.

This was good.  Mixed 1 1/2 pounds of chicken with a little salt, pepper, roasted garlic and some of the juice from the artichokes. Maybe I'll marinate it longer next time. Splashed some white wine in the pan. Roasted tomatoes would be a good substitute for the fresh. Had a ton of pasta leftover even with the extra chicken. Next time 1/2 box will do.

This was delicious!  The pictures shows black olives, but they aren't listed in the recipe... I happened to have a small can of sliced black olives, so I added them.  I also doubled the feta and used fresh oregano.  Delicious!!!

I was expecting a strong  acidic flavor due to my previous experience with cold pasta salad dishes. I'm please to announce this recipe has a pleasant relatively mind flavor. I can definitely taste the oregano.  I very much enjoyed it and would make it again. My only recommendation is to eat it right away. I made a huge batch on Sunday and took some to work with me each day. Each day it became dryer and less flavorful. So make right before you plan to use it.

This has become our favorite pasta meal for the two of us. The lemon highlights the artichokes and the oregano and parsley are perfect spices! I made some adjustments  for our tastes and to serve two. I cook 4 oz dry whole wheat spaghetti for the two of us. I use one four-ounce chicken breast cut into bite-sized pieces; half of a 33.5 ounce jar of artichokes (drained), quartered rather than chopped; 14.5 oz canned diced tomatoes, undrained, in place of a large chopped tomato. I add 1/4 teaspoon of red crushed pepper; 3.8 oz sliced black olives, drained; 1 teaspoon sugar. I don't add the pasta or feta cheese to the sauce. I put the cooked pasta in a bowl and pour sauce over it, then top each serving with feta cheese.  I add a tossed salad and we have a satisfying, wonderful tasty meal! Thank you, Lalena!

Oh my gosh, this was so so good! It was very light and fresh tasting. I used a can of petite diced tomatoes (cuz easy), a yellow onion since that's what I had, added some of the marinade from the artichokes to the pan as others recommended, and threw in some baby bell peppers for the heck of it. This dish was a complete hit, and I'll definitely be making it again!

Hubby and I loved it. I did make a couple of  changes based on what I had at home and what some said. I changed out  fresh chicken for canned organic I had in the pantry. I did drain it first. Also I used canned diced tomatoes with Italian spices. I did drain that as well. I did use the liquid from the marinated
Artichokes.  So that added more oil and flavor. I added olives As well. I really don't think it matters for which pasta. I used a high protein one.  We really loved it and have  left overs for lunch tomorrow. I think it may taste great cold too. Definitely and keeper.

This is a really simple and delicious meal. I didn't have any artichoke so just added more tomato.  I also substituted the Feta cheese and used 4 low fat cheese triangles and it worked great, it gave it a lovely creamy texture and went down a treat with my husband, Will definitely be a regular on our menu from now.

I used about 4 ounces of pasta and that was plenty. There wasn't a lot of sauce.  I used canned tomatoes and I should have poured the juice in instead of draining it first.

We loved this!  Following others' suggestions, I added some pitted Kalamata olives and topped it with a little extra feta.  I also agreed that the portions were more a lunch amount than a dinner.  All in all, it was delicious.

I followed the recipe, but did not use artichokes as my family does not care for them.  Used 2 can of diced tomatoes, 1can of stewed tomatoes and fresh grated Parmesan along with the Feta cheese.  This is a keeper and is easy to adapt recipe to a family's preferences,

I made this exactly as is and it was wonderful.  I loved the lemon flavor and the feta.  I hadn't used feta in a hot dish before and I loved it.   The flavor was light and delicious.

This was quick and easy!!  I used a meyer lemon that I chopped up and added in place of the lemon juice.  I also added some chipotle powder for a bit of heat (don't know if heat goes with Greek but it was absolutely delicious).

Good!  Made with Orzo - maybe do less instead of full 16oz.  Add olives in skillet.   Needs 1 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp pepper - I did not add any this time.

Loved this dish.  The original recipe is good and it adapts well.  It's incredibly easy to prepare. Two things I did differently - I seared the chicken instead of just stirring and made sure all of the pieces got nice and brown. I also added peppers, the recommended olives and the juice from the artichoke jar (just a little).. so good. Self sauced nicely.

This was absolutely delicious! My husband and 13-year-old daughter LOVED it! The next time I make this I will add more artichokes and tomatoes. I used 1 can of petite-diced tomatoes; however, when I make again, I may add some fresh grape tomatoes or another can. I chopped up and added some Kalamata olives. One other thing I may do when making again is add some more lemon juice. It was light and refreshing! Thanks for this recipe!

Very easy. I grilled the chicken with a little lemon and oregano which added a bit of smoke. Those complaining of presentation, I added a selection of heirloom cherry tomatoes and a bright red pepper which added a bit of zip to the dish. I also used kalamata olives. Bright flavor, ease of cooking....this is a keeper.

Loved this dish, as did my entire family!! I did add  a bit of marinara and used water chestnuts as I didn't have artichokes in the house at the time.  Thanks for a family friendly meal!!

Our family enjoyed this salad very much.  I made a few changes based on personal preference.  These included using roasted chicken and adding the chicken cubes into the onion mixture when it was nearly done.  I added a couple of cloves of minced garlic as I cooked the onion. I also used sweet onion rather than red onion because the red onion fades with cooking. Finally, the artichokes that I used in the dish were not marinated so we added greek vinaigrette to further season.  Will definitely prepare again.

When I plated up this dish after cooking it, it looked like something out of a nice restaurant. It also looked like it needed a glass of wine to accompany it, so that happened. ANYWAY it was just as good, if not better, than what I had expected. All the flavours blended so well together; everything was so fresh-tasting, and to top it all off, it was healthy! Thank you SO MUCH for this recipe. Definitely will be making it again.

Made this tonight and really enjoyed it along with the hubby! We like the lemony taste along with adding kalamata olives for more Greek flare. Will definitely make this a staple at least monthly.

I was searching this site for a Greek inspired chicken dish. I had most of the ingredients on hand, made a few tiny tweaks and it was superb!! I subbed a vidallia onion b/c it's what I had on hand,  used a drained can of petite diced tomatoes, again, i didn't have a fresh one on hand. I added 1/3 cup of sliced Kalamata olives and added the marinade from the artichokes back in at the end and simmered the dish with all ingredients including the feta, which melted to a yummy consistency.  I used a 12 oz box of campanelli - I didn't have the linguini. (I do think the 12 oz box is as large as you should go, or the pasta would be too dry.) Tossed all together before serving and sprinkled a little more feta on top. Hubby & kids all had seconds?? I'm adding this to the rotation!!!

Made it for the first time last night and my husband said "If I was stuck on a desert island this is what I would want to eat!!" I'm not sure he has ever raved about something so much! Changes: 6oz marinated artichoke hearts including juice, 1 can diced tomatoes with garlic and olive oil (juice included), 5oz reduced fat feta cheese (allowed it to melt completely), kalamata olives

Easy, low fuss, not at all messy during  cooking.

Increased the garlic.Overall a festive alternative to the New England standby of Macaroni Salad.

I made this last night. The only change I made was the type of pasta, I used penne. This is a very good basic, Greek style recipe. I wanted to make it 'as is' so that I could understand all the tweaks the other cooks made. Now I DO understand and will make this again using many of the suggestions.  My family does not like chicken...I know...hard to believe. So I am going to make it with shrimp. I think it will be delicious.

I thought it was a really good pasta dish.  I added spinach, more feta, and black olives, which make it complete for me.   I thought that an entire bag of pasta was a bit much with 2 of us here, so I cut it in half.  I was glad that I did, because half of the recipe filled my large skillet.  I got 4 large bowls of it out of half of the recipe.

I have to admit I was a bit skeptical because of the directions and adding all the seasoning last.  
Mind you I'm no expert cook.
That said - this dish was really, really good.  The chicken was cooked all the way but a little chewy in a weird way.
Other than that pretty good dish.  Will definitely try again.

Very nice dish! I love the tang the lemon and feta provide. Personally, I find it's especially nice with extra parsley.

This pasta turned out to be amazing! I made a batch for my husband and I which gave us dinner and leftovers for lunches the following few days. I ABSOLUTELY recommend following the comment suggestions. I ended up adding a little butter to the olive oil & included 1/2 the juice from the artichoke hearts, 1/2 can of sliced black olives, used 1 can of petite diced tomatoes (undrained) instead of the whole tomato, and 1 small package of sliced baby bella mushrooms. I left out the lemon wedges and garnished it with some extra feta cheese crumbles.

We loved this recipe!  I made it as is and it turned out great.  We served the ingredients on top of individually portioned noodles (there was too much pasta otherwise).  This recipe is added to my besties for the future!

LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! It's great as written with room for your "tweaks".  You almost can't ruin a batch. Thanks SO much for the great recipe, Lalena!
I always season my chicken with salt & pepper & double the garlic.

Loved this. Based on other reviews, I used a jar of marinated artichokes and threw in the marinade as well and a can of diced tomatoes (not the whole can). I also threw in a small can of sliced black olives. Next time I will season the chicken although the dish did have good flavor without it.

Great taste with simplicity. I skipped out on the artichoke hearts since I was cooking for my grandmother with gallbladder issues. But I have to say it really did not impact the flavor of the recipe. The lemon juice gives the noodles a well-needed zest that goes lovely with the chicken and tomatoes. Oh the tomatoes. I wish I had added more but there's always next time.

I always enjoy making this recipe! It is especially good for those who favour greek herbs and ingredients. I always double the onion and garlic and omit the pasta (decreasing carb value). It's a rather forgiving recipe, allowing cooks to substitute similar items, add spices, or omit ingredients.

Loved this pasta! I did use a can of diced tomatoes undrained plus one small tomato. And I used the marinade from the artichokes. I like having extra sauce, helps keep things from being dry when you have leftovers.  The olives are great in this too.

I initially prepared this as described, and I thought it was really bland. To take it from 3 to 4 stars, I added some more flavor: a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar, a handful of sundried tomatoes, and a teaspoon of paprika worked well. I also threw in a lot of kalamata olives, they're my favorite.

Taste delicious! Like others before, I used a can of diced tomatoes and then I used the fresh tomatoes as a garnish. I also used salt and pepper and oregano on chicken and then again on all the veggies to give it flavor.. I would use small rotini though, not the big. Also garnished with a small amount of parmesean/asiago cheese..

This was super easy and my children had no idea they were eating artichokes, parsley, tomatoes or red onions.

Me and the kids made this tonight and it was a big hit!  We increased the garlic a bit and added some fresh dill, but other words followed the recipe to the letter!  It was very much enjoyed!  Thanks for the idea!

I thought it wasn't too bad but my husband and teenage daughter were unimpressed.  I followed the recipe exactly; it was just missing something, kind of bland.  Probably won't make again.

This was incredible! Lots of flavor, lots of color. As most users, I tweaked this recipe a bit. I used less than half the amount of pasta. I added a bit of butter to the olive oil (used twice the amount of olive oil), onion and garlic. I used double the amount of garlic. I used marinated chicken (bought from the grocery store, Italian marinade). After cooking the chicken, I added the rest of the ingredients listed above. I added spinach, kale, and chard to the mix for some added color and nutrients. I let everything simmer for 10-15 minutes to let everything combine. I didn't add the pasta into the skillet, I instead spooned the chicken mixture over the penne pasta with the juice. 

A really light, yet filling meal. The flavors were unbelievable! The sauce was perfect. Not too tangy/acidic with the lemon, and not too creamy with the feta. Just the right amount. I loved the added benefit of the spinach/kale/chard to the mix, added a great color to everything. The olives were a needed bonus as well, absolutely delicious!

I liked this recipe, but next time I make it, I'm going to try marinating the chicken first.  I found that it didn't absorb much of the flavor from the sauce.  I also served the feta separately instead of adding it while I was cooking.

This was good.  I prefer to eat this cold. I will add Kalamata olives next time.  I will also saute the tomato and artichoke hearts with the onions next time. Add the cheese at the very end when you are ready to eat it.

This seems like a good start to a recipe, but I found it a bit bland and dry. It could really use a sauce, and I discovered I'm not a big fan of artichoke hearts ;-) It came out all right, but I don't think I'll make this again.

I have been waiting to make this for a month, and now I can't wait to make it again!!  We just LOVED it!!  What a wonderful mix of flavors.  The only thing I changed was the fact I didn't have fresh parsley on hand so I had to use dried.  My husband and I ate "too much" we liked it so much.  I'm already looking forward to trying it as a cold dish over the summer, perhaps adding some olives  as suggested.  Thank You!

Excellent!  I added kalamata olives, as suggested.  Next time I'll try adding some of the kalamata olive juice or a little chicken stock for more "sauce."  My pasta was a bit dry. Flavors were excellent!

Wonderful!

Used Chx Thighs- baked cause didn't realize they weren't breasts.  

Added canned tomatos, Kalmata olives, mushrooms.   WONDERFUL- kids liked it too.

This recipe is one of my husband's favorites!  It's also a great recipe for company with an added salad and bakery bread. I do make a few modifications to the recipe.  I usually use at least 2 lbs of chicken, and season the chicken with salt and pepper first. I use at least 2 large tomatoes instead of only 1, double the feta cheese, and mix with a penne type pasta instead of linguini. With those small changes, it's a wonderful dish!

Pros: Easy, quick - was ready in about 30 minutes, start to finish. Cons - I found the flavor to be bland. Next time, I would definitely add olives and would probably add seasoned canned tomatoes rather than fresh.

The flavors of this dish go so well together. Very fresh tasting and satisfying, especially in summer when you don't want anything too heavy. I pair this with baked pita chips and tzatziki. One of my current favs :D

This wasn't as good as I thought it was going to be.  If I make this again, I will definitely add more feta cheese and less marinated artichoke heart, and probably will use canned, diced tomatoes as other reviewers have suggested.

This is good - it's a nice light sauce.  I tried to make some of the suggested changes to add to the sauce, but found that it was lacking in taste.  It definitely needs more flavor and some spice - possibly an addition of a smattering of red pepper while cooking would help it.  I think this is something nice to serve at home, but would probably not make for guests as it lacks a wow factor, but again, it is great for a nice light, healthier sauce.

Meh.  This was all right.  I'll eat the leftovers but I don't think I will be making again.  Not sure why I didn't loooove it, anything with artichokes makes me happy.  Was just kind of bland - the only thing I did differently was to use dried parsley instead of fresh.  I think this would be improved with some kalamatas thrown in, though.

We really enjoyed this.  I didn't use marinated artichokes, but otherwise followed the recipe.  A great quick, fairly low cal meal.

Very good.  My husband thought it also would be good with shrimp.  My tweaks:  a 6 oz. jar of marinated artichokes (in my grocery store, 14 oz. cans of artichokes were packed in water - not marinated); 3 tomatoes, seeded before chopping; and sliced black olives.   Next time I will either use shrimp or only half as much chicken, also.

WOW!!!  Great, easy pasta dish!  Different from the usual, love that it has no "sauce" on it!  Made it with whole wheat penne for a real healthy meal.  I doubled the tomatoes cause we love them and added more chicken.  A keeper!!!  I already shared it with my mom!

Very easy and very delish!!! I added more lemon and 6oz of feta instead of 4oz and capers for flavor. For a pound of pasta I would of done more than 1lb of chicken, this was mostly pasta. Also add more tomato to give it more flavor. Overall great and the kids liked it too!

3 star presentation  4 star texture  5 star taste    I made mine with fresh homemade pasta (yum!) and found this recipe both quick and easy with satisfying results. However, the texture was a little strange with the feta mixed in, and I found the presentation rather bland on the plate.

This was delicious and easy! Modified it by adding sliced olives, chopped basil leaves (about 5), 7 oz of marinated artichoke hearts and marinade, and half the amount of pasta. Used bow tie pasta---was perfect. Will definitely make this again!

YUMMMY!!  The husband and I really enjoyed this one!  Very simple ingredients, not too filling and overall healthy.  We cut back the recipe for three servings (had a feeling it would make a good lunch tomorrow).  I didn't have lemons so I substituted in Greek salad dressing.  We will be making this again and again!

I liked this pasta enough, but it isn't something I would necessarily rave about. I made it exactly how the recipe said, but it just seemed to be missing something. I didn't use an entire pound of pasta, and the pasta still seemed dry. Next time I will try and spice it up a bit.

Very tasty.  I increased the onion to 1 cup and added 3/4 cup of yellow and red peppers, which added color, texture, and flavor.  Also added a little extra feta and offered some on the side.  Squeezing the lemons (for garnish) onto the pasta is delicious as well.  It looks dry but is actually quite flavorful and moist.

This recipe was pretty average.  I even boosted up the garlic, onion, and lemon juice and it was still lacking a bit.  I was hesitant to add the crumbled feta at the end, but it ended up being the best part of the meal.  It was an alright dinner, but probably won't make it again.

I love this dish because its easy to make and practically tastes gormet. I don't change a thing except sometimes I nix the feta for myself but leave it on the side for others.  Its hearty so there is always leftovers and it's great with a small side salad.

I made this for the first time tonight, and my husband and I REALLY liked it.  I used a can of crushed tomatoes w/ oregano and that really made it great!  I would def opt for using crushed tomatoes vs just a tomato diced.  My husband suggested I add some button mushrooms next time.  All in all, it was a yummy successful dish!

My hubby and I thought this was pretty tasty. We kept to the original recipe as much as we could. We cut serving size down to suit the 2 of us and have left overs for lunch. We didn't have a tomato on hand so we used a drained can of chopped tomatoes. Didn't add the olives as suggested but will make that change next time we make this dish. It reminds me a lot of a dish my mother makes by only adding white wine and red pepper flakes. Delicious and in the future I will try adapting a bit more.

My fiance and I both loved this!  We used whole wheat penne to add some extra nutrition.  We also added a few sundried tomatoes.  We didn't have any kalamata olives but both agreed they would make a great addition.

It was good, but not as flavorful as I was expecting. Maybe I should have used "marinated" artichokes as recommended, but I didn't want to add the calories. Don't get me wrong this was tasty - I just think I will add a few more spices next time. It really needed quite a bit of salt.

Everyone in my family really enjoyed this... Except me! It wasn't that it was bad, it just wasn't my thing. The reviews are right: Use less pasta, canned tomatoes, and throw in the artichoke juice. I'm not a very experienced cook, so I timed the pasta and sauce incorrectly- but it worked out to my advantage. I let the sauce stew for a bit and the more I tasted it while I waited for my pasta to get done the more flavorful it became. Really stress using a large pan when making the sauce... The biggest pan I owned almost couldn't fit all of the sauce! Very easy to make and tweak as needed.

I seasoned the chicken with salt, black pepper and red pepper flakes before cooking.  That was the only change I made. If I make this again, I will definitely add kalamata olives and top with a little more feta.

EXCELLENT!!  This is my favorite recipe to date that I've made from this site.... I took some of the recommendations and I did include the marinade juices from the jarred artichokes, also kept the juices from the can of diced tomatoes that I used.  Used about 3/4c. of low fat feta a little higher than recommended.  Also added a 1/2 can of green olives (natural variety, so not very salty) cut up in half.  Cooked organic whole wheat corkscrew pasta and only used about 3/4 of the package after reading some posts about having too much pasta.  This was just a wonderful dish all the way around.  It was so good! Got about 5 servings out of the recipe but the hubby and I went back for seconds too.  Five Stars for sure!

My husband and I loved this dish. We were looking for something new to try and our "new" ingredient was artichoke hearts. DELICIOUS!!!! The only thing I changed was I added fresh mozzarella to the dish instead of feta. I will def have to try feta the next time around.

Just tried this last night for dinner and it was excellent! I didn't drain the artichoke like some people suggested - the juices really added to the flavor and the pasta needed it. I forgot to add olives and I think that would really add to it - next time!

This recipe is awesome.  The one thing I changed as others suggested is the amount of pasta.  1 lb is way too much.  I cut the noodle amount in half (I used penne)and next time I will cut it down a little more or double everything but the chicken to give it more sauce. My husband and I could not quit eating it. After our initial meal we would go back to the stove and say "I just want a little more".  I can't wait to make it for my friends and family members.  I cook a lot and this one is going to be at the top of my recipe book.

This was very tasty.  The only variations I made were to use white onion instead of red (I remember reading somewhere that red onion is not really meant for cooking) and adding about half a jar of pitted kalamata olives, chopped.  I served it with linguine pasta and garlic bread--the garlic bread was great for mopping up the rather liquidy sauce.

As is, this recipe would've been too dry and bland for my taste, but it is a good base.  I left out the artichokes because i don't care for them. Marinated the chicken and sauteed it, then simmered with chopped red peppers, garlic and a can of diced tomatoes with the juice. Then added the herbs, lemon juice, feta and pasta and heated through. Pretty yummy with these changes!

I am giving this a 5 on the benefit of a doubt because I was missing a few things and it was still good! Not much of a sauce base though.

Followed recipe exactly. A little too tangy for me. It was good, the leftovers were better though. Maybe I'll cut the amount of lemon juice next time.

I am not a cook and even I could follow this recipe.  It is so yummy!  I added mushrooms and green olives to the recipe as well and it was great.  This was so easy and tasted like something I would get at a restaurant.  This is definitely going to be a regular.

I usually marinate the chicken in italian dressing and use the dressing when I cook the chicken.  It adds a nice tang with the lemon.  I even made this for Chritmas Eve once.

Excellent!  I was looking for a side dish so I opted out of the chicken and added kalamata olives and sundried tomatoes, according to other reviewers.  Used fresh herbs-- basil and greek oregano.  Also made a half-pound of pasta (rigatoni) which was the perfect amount.  Served cold.  Will be adding this one to the recipe box!

My hubby said this is definitely a "keeper", and I totally agree! I followed the suggestions of others and did the following: seasoned my chicken w/salt & pepper, sub'd artichokes for mushrooms (the little town I live in doesn't sell marinated artichokes believe it or not), and used 1 can of diced tomatoes with juice instead of a large tomato. The juice is a must, and I would consider even using 1 1/2 cans next time. I made this with rigatoni noodles, but will use a spaghetti noodle next time. Thanks for the great recipe!

Needed some tweaking... after adding fresh mushrooms, the artichoke brine, a can of fire-roasted tomatoes (not drained), and a few splashes of balsamic, there was plenty of liquid, but it was a bit too thin, so I added a cornstarch slurry (cornstarch and water) which thickened it up very nicely.  Also added red pepper flakes and capers and topped with fresh grated parmesan... And I had seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper before cooking. It was unique, savory and healthy with these changes.

Nice recipe and worth all the prep work. I tweaked it a little and added some kalamata olives, broccoli, and red peppers. It tasted just as good the next day.

This came out very well.  The only change I made was to use canned diced tomatoes with Italian herbs drained to replace the chopped tomato, parsley and oregano.

Absolutely delicious! I added some white wine to the sauce and some bell peppers as well.  I will definitely make this again! I also used parmesan instead of feta.

This was a great recipe, the only thing I'd suggest is reducing the lemon to half - I found it overpowering.

Just ok.  I made as recipe stated and thought it needed something so I added kalamata olives and the artichoke marinade.  It did help, but still missing the WOW! factor.  I won't make again.

This was very very delicious! It was so easy, and so good. I added Kalamata olives before serving, just to give it that extra bit of flavor, and visual appeal. This is definitely going into my menu rotation.

This was an easy week night dinner.  My family enjoyed it.  I added the extra can of artichokes & it's marinade.  I also added more garlic and tomatoes than the recipe called for and some broccoli florets.  I think it would have been quit bland w/out the additions.  Next timed I'd also add some olives.  The feta complimented the dish very well.

I made this recipe as is and it was so bland I had to try and doctor it up.  Even after all the doctoring it still was not my favorite.  Edible, but really not worth it.  I was very dissappointed.

With a few minor tweaks, I thought this was fabulous. I seasoned the chicken with Greek seasoning, salt, and pepper. Instead of fresh tomatoes, I used two 14.5-oz cans of fire-roasted diced tomatoes.  Instead of draining the tomatoes and the artichokes, I added both liquids to give it more of a sauce. I also added some julienned-strips of sundried tomatoes. For the cheese, I used 1/2 cup of tomato and basil flavored feta and an additional 1/4 cup of regular feta. I used the juice from one large lemon, and that seemed to be enough. Instead of a full pound of pasta, I used about 3/4 pound of ridged elbow macaroni, and that worked nicely. The flavors in this were wonderful - quite bold, but that's how I like my food. Next time I make this, I'll probably do a simple spinach salad and some hearty, crusty bread on the side.

I followed this recipe word-for-word, ingredient-for-ingredient, with one exception - I left out the chicken. It was SO delicious! As other reviewers have said, the flavor is a bit tart but this recipe is totally healthy, totally re-heatable, and I will make over and over.

Delicious!!!! I marinate teh chicken for about an hour in a mixture of olive oil, garlic powder, oregano, salt and pepper. My family isn't a big fan of tomatoes, so I don't add them. I also use garlic & herb feta cheese. YUMMY.

Very fresh tasting. I only used about half the amount of artichoke hearts, but I did add some of the marinade. Used reduced fat feta to cut down on the fat content. Added some kalamata olives too. Had left-over roasted chicken that I used on this. I'll bet this will even taste better tomorrow for lunch.

My husband and I made this for dinner, and everyone's reviews were helpful.  We used marinated artichokes and sundried tomatoes, and we included the marinades from both.  Kalamata olives are a must!  We'll make this again, for sure.

I made this a little different, but not to take away from the recipe. I chopped sun dried tomatoes up and put them in at the same time I put the onion and garlic in. I, like others used canned diced tomatoes pre-seasoned in the can with garlic and olive oil. I did add a small can of sliced black olives also. They didn't have any marinated artichoke hearts at the store which irritated me so I had to stick with plain & canned when I prefer the ones in the jar. It still turned out great. The other reviewers mentioning it being dry was also a problem with me. Not so much when we sat down to eat, it was delish, but I knew pasta really soaks up juices and that sending it with my husband the next day for lunch could be a let down so after dinner I added another can of diced tomatoes, a bit more olive oil and a small can of tomato sauce..(heating it back up to blend well) I taste tested it and it was better. I saved this recipe and will at least have it once a month. Thank you

Great, fast recipe! I loved this, as did my mother-in-law, husband and my sister. Even my toddler would eat the chicken from it.

I used an herbed feta cheese, so I omitted the extra basil.

So good!

This is a great, fast, and easy recipe. I have made this recipe twice. Once following the recipe as is and more recently using suggestions from other users. My two main suggestions are to make sure you are not light on the tomatoes, feta, or lemon juice. The other is to add some red and yellow peppers for both taste and appearance. The sweetness from the peppers is a great compliment. A small salad with balsamic dressing and some italian bread along side this meal and you will have a crowd pleaser!

This was okay. I thought it was lacking in flavor, though. I'm not quite sure what it's missing, but it needs more of something. Perhaps less artichoke hearts and more onions or something.

I thought this was too bland, and it definitely needs the olives. I'll make it again, but with some other ingredients to spice it up a bit.

This was a great Mediterranean recipe! I made a few small changes: I too used canned plum tomatoes, as the fresh ones didn't seem to be to great. I also added mushrooms, black olives, and the marinade from one jar of artichokes, which seemed to really add to the flavor. Thanks for this great recipe!

Really good!!  I changed the recipe a bit, so I couldn't give it the full 5 stars.  I left out the lemon and feta, but added some chopped Italian sausage. I should have added an extra can of artichokes, because there weren't enough.  Didn't feel like it really missed the lemon or feta.  A definite keeper.

This was good it was missing something.  I did do changes.  I cooked my chicken in half a bottle Olive Oil Greek Vinegrette. Then I left the juice.  I added a can of diced tomatos and tomatos sauce.  I used spanich pasta.  It was good.  Different I love Greek food.

AWESOME RECIPE!!! Thank you! I made a few additions: sauteed mushrooms with the onion/garlic, seasoned the chicken prior to adding to the pan, saved some of my salty pasta water and added with the tomatoes, feta, etc. I used a whole cup of Feta (the Greek herb kind) and also added black olives.

This is definitely a keeper!

I didn't enjoy this at all. I used fresh lemons instaid of lemon juice thinking it would make this recipe even better then it seemed but i don't really think anything would make me enjoy this. Maybe i just don't enjoy greek food?  sorry:(

This is a fantastic, easy recipe. I followed the advice of others and used diced tomatoes undrained and put the marinade from the artichokes in so it would not be dry. Next time I might use a little less because it did get a little runny but that is my only complaint!

I did not try this myself, but according to my husband and mother this was great!  I couldn't find the 14oz can of marinated artichoke hearts so I just used a small jar of them and added some of the juice as per other comments.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and from what I was told, it turned out great.  And, it is very simple to make which is always a bonus!

I thought this recipe was very good.  I did add a relish of chopped cucumbers and onions, with just a sprinkle of chopped red peppers in a separate bowl for sprinkling on top of this dish.  My whole family really liked this pasta and I will make it again.

Great recipe! Just for extra flavor, I may add some white wine to this next time. It is great as written though also. Also, after reading other reviews adding pimento olives is a great idea too. The dish is nice visually and with taste to back it up.  I plan on serving this to guests.

We made this pasta last night and made a few changes. We added canned diced tomatoes, kalamata olives, extra garlic, a little white wine and cooked the chicken in the artichoke marinade. It was definetly delicious but it does take longer than thirty minutes. Don't let that hinder you from treating yourself to this delicious food.

This was really quite yummy. I followed the reviews from other cooks and just dumped in the marinade from the artichokes and topped it with a wee bit of fresh grated parmesan. I also added about 7 cloves of crushed garlic and used fresh oregano since it is in season.

It reminded me a lot of a hot pasta salad, only with chicken in it. My hubby loved it and I will definately make it again.

Great recipe! I would add some mushrooms and olives next time. I also kept the pasta and sauce seperate from each other. I thought that there was to much pasta (I like lots of sauce). I used a can of tomatoes- thank you to the others who suggested that idea :)

Since some of the other reviewers said the dish was too dry, I added a can of diced tomatoes and as well as some marinade from the artichokes.  The sauce is really tasty, I just wish the pasta absorbed it a little more, and also there was more to it.  Maybe I'm just used to thicker sauces.  However, this dish is very flavorful, thanks for a great recipe, Lalena!

I liked this a lot, so did my husband. I used some leftover turkey that I wanted to get rid of, and I added a TBSP of balsamic vinegar with the lemon juice. I made a few other changes based on what I had available, but this was good, thank you.

This recipe is a winner with me! It takes just minutes and my whole family of picky eaters all raved about it. They even ate the leftovers for lunch the next day. I have such a difficult time finding meals that everyone agrees is tasty. This one is a keeper!

I love this dish!  It was easy to make and perfect for the hot day we were having!  I made it with wheat pasta and fresh tomatoes and added a touch more olive oil and it turned out just great!  One of three kids ate it, which is very good for our family!  I will definately keep this in mind for our next "potluck dinner" or family gathering.

I adapted this to make a cold pasta salad and it was very well received!  I used leftover grilled chicken, lemon-garlic-oregano feta, and a little extra olive oil and lemon as a dressing to supplement the marinated artichoke liquid.  Delicious on a hot evening!

Awesome... and so quick to do.  I did reduce the pasta to 1/2 pound, and marinated the chicken for a few hours in olive oil with a splash of vinegar and Italian seasoning. It was great!!!

I followed the suggestion of sundried tomatos which was really good, and added a little more lemon and feta.  The only thing I would do different is only make a 1/2 pound or so of pasta because I like more sauce than there was.  Great recipe

My husband and I loved this!  He picked out the artichokes (he's a meat and potato man and doesn't like "green" things). This is definately one of my favorites.  The feta cheese was a nice add-in.

My boyfriend and I made it for dinner the other night and we really like mushrooms so we decided to throw some in. For us it added just the right flavor and texture. Unfortunately we forgot to throw in the artichoke hearts which was a key Greek ingredient, but maybe next time! There will for sure be a next time!

I think the dish needed more chicken and artichokes.  I added olives and sundried tomatoes... it was GREAT!

Wonderful!  I added one can of black olives and 1 or 2-14.5 oz. cans of diced tomatoes, which makes it nice and moist. I also added more lemon juice to taste-we like the zip it gives.  Yummy!

Really good. My hubby liked! Mine got dry pretty quickly so serve immediately! It's not so much a sauce over the pasta but more like the pasta is coated in the flavor, which was super delish. The lemon juice gave it the kick it needed to make the flavor pop, definitely don't leave that out!!

I thought this was just okay. For as many intresting ingriedents that went into this I expected alot more flavor, I even added extra salt, pepper,garlic and some dry basil and all I could really taste was the artichoke, I didn't really care for this and won't make again.

My husband and I liked this dish. I think it's a good recipe, but if I were to make it again, I would prefer more tomato, and probably less parsley and a bit less oregano maybe? Something was slightly off which is making me hold back on giving it 5 stars. We did serve it with whole wheat angel hair which paired nicely with it.

This recipe was great!  Instead of oregano, I used a Greek spice mix.  It added a bit more flavor.  My husband loved this dish.

A very easy and tasty dish. I was looking for something to make using leftover spaghetti noodles. Only change I made was using fresh oregano rather than dried (just because I happened to have it on hand) and it was wonderful. A keeper for sure.

Absolutely full of flavor!  I did double the garlic - but I'm a garlic lover.  I also used angel hair pasta, but notice the pic uses rigatoni - I'm going to try that next time.  And my husband, who used to turn his nose up at artichoke hearts, was looking for seconds.  Very easy to make - very little time involved.

I love this recipe - it's quick, easy and delicious.  I tweaked it a little bit too.  I cut down on the oregano, used canned artichoke hearts, and added about 1/2 cup of white wine to create a bit more sauce.  I made it with shrimp too, and it was just as good!! Thanks for the recipe - it's a new family favorite.

This was great. I will definitely be making this again. I added 1/2 pint of heavy cream into the pot when it was almost done and then let it simmer for about 15 minutes. Delicious!!!

Delicious! I've made this for a couple of occasions and most recently for a group of friends. It easily fed 7 hungry college students. Be sure to prep ahead of time or get some help. I like my ingredients finely chopped so it takes me a while. I also add more feta than called for (it's my favorite cheese), a whole lemon juiced and some of the marinade from the artichokes. You have to remember that this is not a saucy dish, but it is rich in a lemony flavor. I get rave reviews for this all the time. Try a little tinkering with this and you won't be disappointed!

My family LOVED this recipe. It had a lot of flavor. My husband even loved it enough to eat the feta cheese, which he has sworn he would never eat. We will make this one part of our routine.

I tried to go a little healthier and chose this recipe; I wasn't impressed.  It was ok but lacked the "umph" of flavor I think greek food has.  It smelled so good when I was cooking it but the taste fell short.  Maybe it can be saved with some olives?

My teenagers and I liked this dish!  We changed a few things according to recommendations in reviews like the addition of spinach and olives.  We added a little greek dressing and fresh Feta cheese just before serving, also great as leftovers!

This is a regular recipe for me and my fiance. I've also made it for a few friends, who really enjoyed it as well. It's easy, it's healthy and it's nummy to boot! Thanks for posting. ^_^

This recipe was great. I hate feta cheese so I substituted with parmesan. I also used whole wheat pasta. Very easy and delicious.

This is just ok as written. I took some other reviewers' advice and it was better, but not 5 starts. I'll make it again because it's healthy and fast. Thanks for the recipe!

I'm only rating this 4 starts because of the modifications I made based on previous reviews.  Since a lot of people felt this was dry, I chopped 2 large tomatoes and dumped their juices into the pot.  I added one cup of onion and basil for extra flavor.  Also, to thicken up the "broth" I added some tomato sauce.  This dish has a lot of flavor with the modifications.  And the best part is that I didn't even need to add any salt whatsoever!!!

I added an additional can of tomatoes, some white wine and the juice from the artichokes.  Very tasty and made the sauce more juicy.

Love this.  I would say a half pound of pasta is the most you'll need, and it definitely needed the liquid from the artichokes.  I also used more feta than the recipe called for (because I'm a cheese freak).  This will be a regular staple!

This was great and really flavorful!  We added some summer squash and zucchini as well as olives, and cooked the chicken in olive juice for extra flavor.  Chicken and vegetables can get very boring night after night, this was really great.

I loved this recipe. I used a small can of diced tomatoes instead of a fresh tomato. It made it more saucy. I also added some black olives....yummy! This dish is delicious.

We both loved the flavor of this but though that it was a little dry and could have benefitted from a little more "sauce" of some kind (perhaps a reduction of the artichoke marinade and lemon).

This is really yummy. I don't mix the pasta and the "sauce" outright, I put the "sauce" on top of the pasta in the plate - that alleviates the problem of whether or not there is too much noodles, yes?

Very good and soooo simple.  I used all the marinade from the artichokes as others suggested....otherwise too dry.  Also followed others and used a little less pasta.  With these two changes it came out perfect.  Great leftover.  Would be good with shrimp too!

This was amazing and very flavorful! I followed the other reviews and added the canned tomatoes and marinade from the artichokes (2 cans). I love feta cheese, so I added a little extra.I even had the leftovers for lunch today.

This was great! I cooked dinner for my mom's B-day and it was a big hit everyone loved it, I used a few tips from the other reviews with the olives and the marinade I also added some white wine. This is a keeper for my family, I want to try it with shrimp next time.

OMG!! Im in LOVE!! This is now my favorite dish! My family devoured this!
I went almost exactly by the recipe. I used grape tomatoes and all of the artichoke juice. And I used Penne pasta.
I made a big beautiful salad to go with it and used the Greek House dressing (also on Allrecipes) My husband fell in love with me all over again!! Thank you dearly for sharing this recipe!

Tried this last night.  Followed many of the suggestions.  Added good olives, marinade from the Artichokes and canned diced tomatoes with their juice.  It was just ok.  My husband liked it better than I or it would have been just two stars.  I would add our taste buds are not americanized as one writer suggested.  We enjoy all the individual flavors of the ingred in this dish, it just didn't come together as well as expected.

Very good and very easy! Depending on personal preference, others might consider cutting the pasta by 1/4 or even 1/2.  The dish was still rather tasty, but would have been even better with less pasta.

5 Stars, would give it 10 if I could! I followed the recipe pretty straight forward, I used two cans of artichokes and one can I drained, the other I poured in. Low fat feta was used, and it came out GREAT! Family favorite here, im making it again this week!

Wow this was great! I doubled the garlic, onion and tomatoes, and was pretty generous with the cheese too. It turned out creamy, tangy, and very fresh tasting. I am making it again this weekend, we can't stop raving about it! My husband had never had artichokes before, he still isn't sure what they are, but has asked for this dish again.

Use sliced olives, chop parsley and put in last so it is only barely heated through.

My wife made this last night and it was wonderful.  It had a nice Mediterranean flavor.  I think maybe some greek olives would add a little more "greekiness" to it.  This recipe has made our "It's a Keeper" list.

Loved this recipe! Used shrimp instead of chicken and a little more feta cheese so it made a creamy sauce for the orzo pasta. Delicious!!

This is the best Greek Pasta recipe I have ever made. I will definitly make it again. I've even passed on the recipe to friends.

I added kalamata olives to it which I thought was a great addition!

I ranked this a 5 with the following modifications: Add extra fresh tomatoes, a can of diced tomatoes, a dash of salt and pepper, and don't drain the artichokes.

This was fantastic, and really had a Greek flavor!  I used only 1/2 lb. pasta, increased the tomatoes to 2, used 1/2 tsp. salt and 1/8 tsp. pepper - would make all those adjustments again.  I also bought pre-cooked/seasoned chicken breasts to save time - just omit the cooking step and throw them in with the other ingredients (artichoke hearts, tomato, etc.) to warm.  Serve with pita bread wedges.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Very good. I used whole wheat pasta and also added a couple tablespoons of sundried tomato pesto that I had left over from another dish, which added a nice taste to it.

I guess I am in the minority here. I thought this was ok as written. It was fairly bland. We added pesto and it turned out excellent. JMO.

This was very yummy!  It's not terribly pretty though, so if you're worried about presentation, you might keep some extra feta to sprinkle on the top when it's done.

This was very easy to make. I added salt and kalamata olives to give it more flavor.  After that though, it tasted fine.  I also substituted orzo pasta for penne, and then just mixed everything together when done.  Then it becomes an excellent, rice-like and chicken dish. I will be making this again.

I did not read all the reviews before making this and now that I have, I am not suprised that mine turned out very dry.  I did cut the amount of pasta in half and I am sure that helped some.  I also was out of olive oil so used cooking spray instead and the feta was fat free.  These changes might also account for some of the dryness.  It was also a little bland so next time I will add kalamata olives.  My husband thought this was good so I will try it again with a few modifications.

I loved this! I only used 1/2 the amount of pasta and added a little juice from the jar of artichokes. Mine was not dry at all. My hubby doesn't like artichokes, but he liked this, though not as much as me. My toddler liked it too. I used whole wheat penne.

This recipe was excelent and extremely easy!!! I tasted supurb and even my toddles loved it. I had to improvise a bit because I didn't have any chicken, I had ground turkey, so I made small meatballs and it worked out nicely. I have and would recomend this recipe to anyone who likes pasta dishes and has little time. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

This was very dry and not a whole lot of flavor. Also, one pound seemed like to much pasta for this dish.

This was a great recipe. I left out the chicken b/c I'm a vegetarian and added a touch more garlic, and my family loved it. Great the next day for leftovers too. Will definitely make this again.

I just made this pasta dish for dinner. The flavor was really good.  I did add an additional clove of garlic, more feta and some basil.  It seemed dry to me, but realized while looking this over, that I forgot the olive oil. Next time I will definitely try that and I'm sure I'll love it.

This was delicious!  My husband and I loved it, but not our 5 year old son.  I used cubed, leftover cooked chicken and several roma tomatoes.  Next time I'll use more tomatoes.  I thought I had bow-tie pasta, but only had shells and used that instead.  Since it's chunky, I like a bigger pasta rather than angel hair.  I'll definitely make this again, especially in the summer with tomatoes from the garden.

the whole recipe was delicious.  i will definately do this one again.  the only thing wrong with it was that it came out a bit dry.  may be add some olive oil to it and toss it in right after you take it off the stove.  other than that it was fine.

Oh WOW this is resturant quality...thats what my hubby said anyway, I agree!  I added fresh mushrooms and I didn't have kalamata olives so I used peruvian olives.  This was also my first time eating artichokes!!  It was WONDERFUL.  I agree with a previous reviewer that the feta cheese is what makes this recipe so great.

I agree that it's a good concept, however is definitely lacking something.  If it weren't for the cut up red pepper I added, I don't think it would've tasted like anything- and I doubled the garlic and oregano!

I made this tonight for my DH and myself as written.  I only wish I had some kalamata olives to add to the dish, that for sure would have given this a 5 star rating.  Be sure to add the feta into the pan, as this melts it some to give it the sauce.  I served over angel hair.  Delicious and very easy to make in a short amount of time. The squirt of lemon on the finished dish was wonderful.  I will make this again for sure.

This is a great recipe, with a nice change from the regular "pasta from a jar" idea.  I did make a couple changes though to personalize it.  I browned my chicken breast with Mrs. Dash's Garlic Herb spice.  I also use a can of diced tomatoes to save from the hassle of chopping.  I add a bit of chopped black olives.  I also add about 4 oz of cream cheese.  IMO the feta makes the dish. I served this to a group of friends this past summer, and it went over wonderfully!!!

I really thought the "concept" was great: Feta, chicken, artichokes, etc, but the end result just seemed to be missing something.  It needed a little more flavour.

Loved this!!!!! Even my picky teen daughter ate this. I only had spaghetti pasta and that was O.K. but it seems like it would be better suited for penne or no pasta at all. This came together quick and easy and the flavors were tremendous. I will be making this many more times and cannot wait to try it out on friends. I can even see making this for a large crowd and keeping it in a chafing dish. I added a tad more lemon juice and some Greek seasoning but other than that, I kept everything else the same. The only downside was the small portion that I reheated the next day in a skillet didn't taste like it did the night before so only serve this immediately.

What a flavorful pasta recipe! Made this for a multi-family dinner and it was a big hit - everyone had seconds! I did wait and sprinkle the feta over the top right before serving. I do not recommend using angel hair - maybe linguini, instead. I love the lack of high-fat cream sauce!

This was OK, good for a quick meal that you can make with pantry items.  I found it to be a bit watery, but that could be because I sprinkled the feta on top instead of mixing it in (thought it would look more appealing and less muddy).  The lemon flavor was good, but next time I would be more generous with the oregano and pepper.  Kalamata olives were a nice touch.  Overall, it was a very satisfying weeknight meal that I will probably make again.

The best dish I've ever made! This is one incredible pasta dish.  It takes a more advanced tongue than the corn-syrupy American Prego-lovin' tongue to enjoy this, and that's the only reason that everyone doesn't give this 5 stars.

This was a great "starter" recipe. I made several changes though: decreased the amount of noodles to half, and added chicken broth, cream cheese and a little milk to make it more saucy.  Having the extra sauce boosts the flavor a quite a bit!

Very good recipe.  Definitely do not use a pound of pasta though (I used 3/4 pound and thought that was still too much), and DON'T use angel hair!  I didn't have any fresh tomatoes, so I used canned diced tomatoes, and that worked just fine.  Very easy and delicious.

This was a good one-dish dinner recipe.  I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of the tomato, as some of the other reviewers suggested.  I also used less pasta as was also suggested, and the consistency was still a little too dry.  When reheating I added extra olive oil which helped alot.  Overall still a good recipe.

Something just wasn't right about this recipe and I couldn't quite put my finger on it.  I normally adore greek food too, so I was a little surprised and disappointed.  Maybe I'll try it again and tweak it a bit...

Excellent! The secret is the feta cheese, which gives this dish an excellent flavor in combination with the artichokes. It is also very fast to make.  I think you could use about half the pasta recommended though, I found it to be a lot. I guess I just like the other stuff more!

A big hit with everyone!  Followed the recipe exactly, but  used canned chicken for a quicker fix.  VERY GOOD!

Yummy, easy.  I love feta but did not have as much as recipe called for.  Was even delicious with less feta.

I would have made more of the chicken mixture, because there was not enough to cover all the pasta.

I tripled the amount of lemon juice and olive oil the second time I made it and it wasn't as dry.  I also used a can of diced tomatoes instead of the fresh tomato and it was just as good.

I loved this and it was pretty easy. I totally omitted the chicken and didn't miss it at all. The artichokes are so filling. Great presentation-looks and tastes like something from a good restaurant. Serve with wedge of fruit and good crusty bread.

This recipe was okay, but I wouldn't make it again. The flavors were nice, but I felt like the recipe lacked something. Perhaps a light sauce of some kind would improve it. I'm surprised it's gotten such high ratings.

This was a very good dish, I added a couple more cloves of garlic, and additional feta cheese.  I also added Greek Black Olives at the end. I will defintely make this dish again. Kids were just o.k. with it.

This was truly outstanding. I am a terrible cook, but wanted to fix something nice for my boyfriend for putting up with me when I was acting crabby over the weekend. I picked this recipe because it featured several of his favorite things, but I wasn't anticipating that I would love it, too! Thanks very much for submitting this!

Excellent recipe!  I used sundried tomatoes instead of a fresh tomato.  However, be prepared to spend more than 15 minutes preparing this dish unless you buy the chicken already diced and the feta already crumbled.

This was fantastic.  I didn't use the lb. of pasta as directed though.  I used a little over a half.  I think it would have been dry if I used it all.  I threw in some black olives.  A must try!!
