Delicious and unique.  

Some folks have complained about a strange flavor -- keep in mind that "curry powder" is a general term for a hundred possible combinations of spices.  If you get a good-quality curry powder from a gourmet shop, and stay away from nasty grocery-store brand yellow American-style curry powder that's mostly turmeric, you'll find the recipe much more appealing!

Excellent! Very tasty and easy to make. I only used 1 1/2 Tbl. curry powder since I was cooking for picky boys, and they loved it.  I also used 1 cup apple juice and 1 cup chicken stock rather than 2 cups apple juice and the bouillon to reduce the salt.  Came out great! Thanks for sharing!

I really just picked this out for my boyfriend because he loves pork chops with applesauce, and I do not like applesauce, but this recipe was very good. It was not sweet like I thought it would be.  The curry was very interesting and a great ingredient to balance out the with the applesauce.  I enjoyed the amount of sauce because it completely covered the pork chops in the dish as they were baking, although we did throw out a good bit of it after we ate.  The pork chops were slightly overdone at 40 mins, so watch your cook times (and my pork chops were thicker than one inch).  Will definitely make this again.  May use a little more garlic next time also.

Great recipe, if bouillion is omitted. Use less apple juice and add a little chicken broth/stock instead. We love curry, but I did have to experiment with a variety of curry brands before I came up with one that I have used for about 40 years. We don't care for cumin, so I purchase one that doesn't have cumin listed as the first ingredient.
As others have said, 40 min. at 400 degrees is way too long and high for chops that have already been browned. Reduce heat to 350 degrees and bake for about 30 minutes. Also to keep moist, the pan can be covered while cooking.
You do have to enjoy curry to like this recipe. We found the curry amount just fine, but if you've never had curry, I'd reduce it by at least half.

This was absolutely delicious!!  I used the crock pot on low for 6-7 hours.  I browned the onion and apple first and then added to the crock pot.  

Edit: I've made this many times and I've found I like it best when I also make the pork chops on top of the stove, adding the apple mixture to it after I've cooked that separately.  I love the curry taste too, so I always add more.

My family raves over this! Thanks for the recipe!

My somewhat picky family is new to curry, so I wasn't sure what their reaction would be. They loved it! I slightly decreased the butter, and that seemed fine. I also found the cooking time to be a tad long, so I'll have to watch that next time. This is a very saucy dish, so be sure to serve it with rice. I'll definitely make it again!

Great recipe!  I only did a few things differently--I like to saute the garlic with the meat.  I also sauteed the meat longer and then cooked it in the sauce on top of the stove on low heat rather than baking it.  I find this makes the meat more juicy and tender.

I also prefer curry *paste* over powder.  I feel it has a deeper, more subtle flavor.  If your regular grocer doesn't have it, try to find a store that offers Eastern/Asian foods.  

I LOVE mango chutney and am thinking I'd like to adapt this recipe next time with a mango curry sauce.  Yummmm!

I've made this twice now, it has such great flavor!  Definitely cut the sauce by half and be careful--curry stains.

I read the reviews before making this and chose to make it in the slow cooker.  I first browned the chops and placed them in the slow cooker, and then browned the apples/onions and placed them on top.  Then I combined the sauce ingredients and poured it over all.  These were ok.  The pork was tender (the slow cooker will do that though) but I didn't really care for the sauce that much.  It was fun to make something new (although hot oil almost hit me in the eye in the process!) but this just wasn't to my liking.  Hubby really liked it though.  So did my 12-month old.  He ate just as much of the pork as I did!

This was fantastic! Used a mixture of Penzeys maharajah, sweet, and vindaloo curry powders and kept everything else the same.  my boyfriend said it was the best curry he's ever had - and he loves curry. Permantly in my rotation now, for sure. Thanks!

It tasted great, however, it was terribly gassy for our family so we will not make it again I do not think!!!!  I even took Beano before eating this and I was gassy for 24 hours!!!!  Was it the Curry Powder????  It remains a mystery.

This was really good.  The only change I had to make was instead of apple juice, I used raspberry lemonade (! that was all I had on hand :-P ) and it came out with a very nice flavor.  Next time I think I will just throw everything into my slow cooker and that will make it even easier.  Overall, a very good recipe!

The flavor was excellent but as someone already stated, too much sauce.  I would cut the apple juice, applesauce, and curry powder in half if I were to make this again.  Too many recipes, too little time so only a few make my 'keeper' list, glad I tried this though.

So good & different!  I didn't have any bouillon, so added a bit more salt.  I didn't read the review to reduce the sauce (less juice), but I used 6 chops and it was too much.  Maybe I'll also add some cornstarch to thicken it up a bit.  Definitely good with rice (of any kind). Also, agree, get some good curry powder, or make up your own.  Thanks for such an excellent recipe.

AMAZING! Seriously this is going on my list of best recipes of all time and I didn't even have to add anything! Well that's not true I added a bit of Cumin and some Cinnamon and extra curry powder because I am a huge curry fan =) If you like Indian inspired cuisine you will adore this slightly sweet and spicy recipe. Make sure you take the time to caramelize the onions and apples!!

I think the temperature of the oven is supposed to be preheated to 350 degrees. 400 is way to high for those pork chops...i did it at the correct temp. of 350 and it all turned out perfect!

This was delicious. Very strong curry flavor but the apple helps keep it on a sane level. :)

There was a little more sauce then was necessary but better too much than too little.

Great combination of flavors! I used sweetened applesauce, cut down on the curry and substituted about 1 cup of water and cream for the apple juice. Turned out great. 40 minutes seemed to be a good length.  Goes very well alongside some  garlic mashed potatoes. Certainly a keeper, hard to go wrong.

These were absolutely amazing! I substituted grape/peach juice for the apple sauce (since that's what I had on hand) and it still turned out terrific. My fiance and girlfriend loved them and there were no leftovers.

Hubba asked me to make this again. The kids gave it more than 5 stars each (except my little one, but he doesn't like much anyway, LOL). I love curry, anyway. I upped the garlic, and added an extra apple. Will make this again.

This wasn't that great, but probably because I had to make some subs based on preference and what I had on hand. I wanted to make it lower fat and lower sodium so I cut out the margarine and chicken boullion. I used reduced sodium chicken broth instead of apple juice and boullion. I cooked the apple and onion in a non stick skillet using fat free cooking spray. I had to make my own curry using cumin, tumeric, ground coriander, cayenne, ginger powder, black pepper and garam masala 'cause that's what I had.  It was really spicy and not very sweet so I added a little brown sugar.  A quality curry would probably make this better, and if you're not worried about fat and sodium then following the directions exaclty is probably outstanding.

I made this for my boyfriend who loves Indian food and he literally raved about it for days. I did have to make a few changes based on what I had on hand. I substituted white wine and grape juice for apple juice, cinnamon apple sauce for unsweetened, and added brown sugar. The sauce was sweeter, but great with the pork. As another review said, I had a lot of sauce left but we ate it over rice with grilled chicken, as leftovers. Great recipe!

spiced it up- loved it but modified quite a bit because of my lack of ingredients and actually loved it.  I didn't have apple juice, so I used a can of light beer instead, skipped the currie powder and instead chopped up 1/4 fresh jalapeno, added a bit of fresh cilantro and some green onions.  Deeeelicious!  Sweet at first with the apples then the jalapeno added a nice kick.  Very easy to make and was delicious.  Will make it again soon!

This recipe has a very different taste to it. At first I was a little nervous but the ending result was very tasty. My only complaint was that the curry was too thin. Easy and cheap to make.

It tasted really good and everybody seemed to love it, but I think extra curry powder would have made it a little better.

Very tasty! My chops were thin and boneless so I cooked at a lower temp (350) for a shorter amount of time (30 minutes). I prefer a thicker sauce, so I didn't add as much liquid as the recipe called for. Will definitely make again.

Good Recipe, I wish I would have browned my chops a little more for presentation, but family loved it, despite I had no curry powder. I plan to remake it with the above mentioned adjustments.

I used less curry and made it in the crockpot, but I can see this would turn out great in the oven too, because the amount of liquid was enough to not allow the meat to dry. The whole family loved this one. Will definitely make it again.

I LOVED this recipe!  It was so easy to make and it tasted like I had just ordered a meal from my favorite Indian restaurant.  My only recommendation would be to get the thickest pork chops you can because I found they were overwhelmed by the fantastic curry sauce.  Also, I only used one cup of the apple juice or it would have been very runny.

The fat content in this recipe surprised me.  I am wondering how long ago the recipe was first published, as pork chops are usually less fatty today than they were years ago. In fact, less than chichen.  What is raising the fat content to 45%? (24.6g)  Should this maybe be revised???  This is a great dish.

This was an excellet recipe! A few of my changes included reducing the curry by half, using aprox. 1/2 cup chicken stock as a deglacie, slicing the chops very thinly before adding them back to the sauce and adding a handfull of dried currants. Served w/ basmati rice and curried chickpeas w/ pita bread.
In future, I am considering adding coconut milk to the sauce, it may add a bit of richness to it.
This one's going into the recipe box for sure!

This recipe was very good!  I took into consideration others saying the chops were overcooked and after browning cooked the pork chops at 350 for 35 minutes, they came out perfect... nice and tender.  I served them over basmati rice... delicious, picky husband even liked them.

This recipe was great.  I forgot to buy the apple juice and apple sauce at the store, so I put an extra apple in a food processor and used for "applesauce" and used a little OJ instead of apple juice.  I had no idea if it would turn out, but it was excellent.

My husband told me I should get on and give this a good rating. I made this using a bone in pork roast in the slow cooker. I did not however use as much butter as called for, I just did not need it, also I used two tablespoons curry powder. The meat was tender, the sauce was mild and had a nice aroma. I would make this again.

I agree; too much sauce.  Next time I will use 1/2 of the suggested apple juice.  I had to use sweetened applesauce becuase that's all our little neighborhood market had. I used HOT Madras curry becuase that is the only kind I had.  But the flavors and heat all came together to make a really nice meal for a crisp Minnesota fall day.  I served this with brown rice and steamed green beans.  A keeper; a very good dish to have in the dinner recipe rotation.

Really good ! 
I went a bit lighter on the curry powder, just 1 tbsp and I was happy with the result. Rather than use store bought apple juice and applesauce, I made my own which only takes about 20 minutes and it all turned out great.

I was looking for a recipe to use up some left over pork roast and happened upon this.  I cut the sauce in half, threw the pork and some asparagus in the skillet and let it simmer for a few minutes. Great and really quick.

This was not as good as I hoping it would be.  I used center cut pork chops instead of the thick cut chops.  Here a few changes that I will make next time: Cut the apple juice down to 1 cup and slice the apples instead of dice.  By the time I pulled the dish out of the oven the flavor was good but the apples and sauce were not there.  An option would be to pan fry the chops and then fix the sauce and serve over them.  I will try again but will fix a little different.

This is delicious! I can't chop and carmelize onions and apples in 10 minutes, but the extra time is worth it. Next time I will use less juice and sauce, as others have. I also used 2 Tbls curry powder and it was too much.

Milder crockpot version using pork roast: I used a 2 lb pork roast, and since I was using a crockpot, cut the apple juice to 1 cup as suggested for the original, chopped the onion and apple into dice-size pieces. Used Honey Crisp apple to see if would hold shape better and the pieces on top of the roast did. I only had cinnamon flavor applesauce, sweetened version with Splenda, so I cut the curry powder down to 1 Tbsp just in case the cinnamon made it too much. Next time I will add more, but this was mild with a curry flavor. I also used ham soup base as I had no chicken bouillon; I don't think it makes a difference due to the curry flavor. Used 1/8 tsp garlic powder as substitute for the garlic. I did not caramelize the onion, just put it with apple chunks on top of the roast, which I did not brown either. (Did not use margarine.) I did mix the other ingredients together though before pouring over everything in the crockpot, cooked for 5 hours on high and we liked it. Smelled WONDERFUL while cooking. It was not spicy. It made a LOT of sauce, 4-1/2 cups - might decrease the apple juice and add some apple jelly instead next time. This sauce might be good with ham or another meat so I didn't throw out the leftovers yet.

Very tasty! I only made 2 changes to the original recipe - I used a spiced cider and 2.5 T of HOT Madras curry. This made so much sauce that next time I will cook six pork chops instead of four. My family loved the dish and wished there was more of it.

I gave this 5 stars because it was so good.  But I did not use the curry so I guess it was just Pork Chops with Apple Sauce.  I am probably the least picky eater in the world but just can't do curry.  As a matter of fact it is on the top of my will not eat list but think it's unfair to the submitter to dis a receipe just because I don't like something.  But I loved the combination of the apples, onions, etc.  Thanks.

This was good, but lacked depth of flavor. I used 4 very thin pork chops, browned them for a couple minutes on each side, used 1c apple juice, 1c chicken broth and 2T curry powder.  I only baked it all for 15 mins at 350...any longer and the chops would've been hard as rocks.  The apples were amazing, but it still felt like it was missing something and I don't think the extra 1T of curry powder was it.  If I make it again, I'll use 1/2c apple juice, 1/2c chicken broth...and I'd have to put some more seasonings in there, just not sure exactly what yet.

I think that the amount of curry called for in this recipe was WAY too MUCH !!!  I even lessened it as others had suggested; however it was very overpowering- to the point where I had to open the windows and doors to my house because even the smell of it cooking was extremely strong.  If you love curry this is the recipe for you.

I made this exactly to the directions and it did not turn out well at all.  I am not sure what I did wrong.  I actually had to throw it out unfortunately, which I hate to do.

Maybe I was expecting something different from this recipe.  In hindsight I don't know if I would want to eat apple sauce with curry, onions, and chicken bullion in it so why would I want it on my pork chops?  

Sorry for the bad rating but I didn't like it at all.

Easy, economical, and delicious.  Helped me get over my aversion to meat with sweet sauces.  The spices complement the sweetness of the apples and onions perfectly.

We loved this meal. The curry flavor was mild, not overpowering and blended very well with the apples. I thought the amount of sauce was perfect as we had enough to spoon over the pork and basmati rice. I've made this meal twice~ once using center cut loin chops and once using tenderloin. Both turned out very tender. Thanks for this delicious recipe!

Hmmm...this was interesting. I had 4 small boneless pork chops and a large pork steak so I threw them in together. Neither of them seemed to soften up - pretty tough. I liked the sauce over rice and didn't think it was too much. I only put in 2T of curry but 3 would've been fine. I think I'd try it in the slow cooker if I made it again so the meat would be more tender. Everyone seemed to like it as long as the meat was cut into small pieces.

This was great.  I used the crock pot also, but I cheated.  I didn't brown anything. I just thru all the ingredients into the crock pot and let it cook all day.  I didn't have curry so I made my own using southwestern seasoning and instant mulling spice from tastefully simple.  It was delicious.  It is my 4-year old's favorite and she actually eats 2 helpings. I have also made it with a pork roast and it is great.

Great recipe, especially the sauce.  The pork chops were a little dry, so I will try this in the crock pot or cook them a little longer at a lower temperature the next time I make it.

This was delicious.  I took previous reviewers' advice and cut the amount of sauce in half.  Also, I didn't have any applesauce on hand, so I used peach preserves; and it still came out great.

Great flavor, but a bit too saucy.  I think the pork chops would be even better and more tender if slow-cooked for several hours in the sauce.  Great over a cut-up baked potato.

Amazing.  I baked at 350 for about 40 minutes, had a 9X13 pan with about 12 chops layered in it and doubled the sauce.  Chops were tender and sauce is really savory and delicious.  Tastes like autumn!  i used half curry powder and half garam masala.  Cut chops thick from a loin roast.

Yum!  Like others I did make a few changes:  subbed 1 cup chicken stock for 1 cup applesauce, omitted bullion,
added cinnamon, cut butter to just enough to cook apples and onion, chopped red potatoes and sweet potatoes and put them in the pan with the chops and poured sauce over all of it.
My picky kids (6, 4, and 2) ate it and the older two asked me to make it again!  And yes there is a lot of sauce, but so good on rice, and too much sauce is better than not enough.

I must say, this was the best meal I have ever made.  I did deviate a bit from the recipe.  I only used 2 pork chops, made my own applesauce & didn't use apple juice.  In lieu of the apple juice, I used chicken broth.  It was AMAZING.  I did use a dutch oven and only left it in the oven for 40 minutes, instead of 45.  I also used butter instead of margarine.  I used a tifny bit of butter, maybe 1/2 tablespoon.  My hubby was drooling.  Really, the yummiest pork chops ever!

Totally love the mix of sweet and savory with most anything, especially nice pork chops.
I live in the desert and try to avoid using the oven for a good portion of the year, so here's what I did to tweak this for my liking.
- Used coconut oil and butter instead of vegetable oil and margarine, respectively
- Split the curry powder to half curry powder and half cumin
- Cooked entire dish in a skillet instead of baking
- Because I didn't bake, I didn't use apple juice (and also cut back on the chicken bullion)

Caramelized onion and apple in butter over medium heat. When they were tender and brown, removed from heat to a side dish. 
Cranked the heat to medium/high and added coconut oil. Once hot, placed the salt/pepper prepped pork chops in the pan for quick searing on each side, then reduced heat to medium/low. Added onion and apple mixture, remaining ingredients and a little bit of water so everything wouldn't sear too much. Cooked for about five minutes on each side until center was 145. Removed promptly.

Incredibly tasty dish - thanks for sharing!!

Such a great dish for cold weather.  I used chicken breasts instead of pork, a granny smith apple, and only 1/2 cup of water with 2 T curry powder.   Served with a pumpkin and cauliflower puree.  So perfect

This was absolutely delicious! My family isn't that big on curry but they absolutely loved the dish! Instead of regular chicken bouillon, I used some low sodium bouillon and I used two apples instead of just one because I had some extra ones laying in my fridge!

I halved the recipe and added a cubed sweet potato when the apples and onions go in -- YUM!  The sauce was great - my pork chop was kind of boring, but the sauce more than made up for it.

My husband and son loved this though it stinks up the house.  I added extra apple sauce and served with apple sauce (what can I say we love apple sauce)

OH MY GOSH.  This is so good.  I like to say it's "good enough for company".  Not hard at all to prepare, and oh so tasty.

We all loved this recipe - I used water instead of apple juice (I was out)  and it was still fabulous.  Thanks for the recipe!

Did not change the recipe - very tasty! Scaled down to 4 servings - alot of liquid.   As per others, 30 min at 350 was perfect.

I made this last night and it was great.  The only change I made was to the temperature and time - as others suggested I baked at 350 for 30 minutes - and it was NOT done.  I had to put it back in for another 10 minutes or so, but I admit my chops were fairly thick.  I just served with plain white rice, green beans, and a simple salad.  I thought the amount of curry was just right!

This was really good!  My picky 8 yr. old turned up his nose when he saw it but once he tried it he really liked it.  I did, however, make some changes based on what was on hand.  I followed the recipe other than I used thin cut pork chops, sliced 3 small apples, used less butter, two kid size containers of no-sugar added green apple applesauce, 2 c. lite cranberry juice, and about 1 tbsp of curry.  It was very liquidy so I would definitely make rice to go with it & next time I'd add more apples.  Mmmm.  It was very tasty!

this was a good recipe, though a bit sauce heavy.  My pork chops were literally drowning in it.  I would try it again, but with some modifications to the sauce.

Excellent.  A little soupy - perhaps a little less liquid would make the sauce more, er, saucy.  It did start to thicken by the end, but I also had thinner pork loin chops that were done sooner.  I used the suggestion of 1 cup apple juice and 1 cup low sodium chicken broth instead of bullion granules. But that is the same amount of liquid, so I don't think that made it so soupy.  The taste was wonderful - I might cut down the curry just a bit, but my husband loved it.  I might try to find a sweeter curry blend next time!

I found this recipe super easy and fast to prep. I don't eat pork but my boyfriend loved it! I made the sauce in a food processor and it turned out great. I didn't use chicken cubes and I used extra garlic. Also, to speed up the cook time throw it in a baking dish with a lid for 20 mins and its done :) Lovely recipe

I'm really surprised that this recipe has received as many positive reviews as it has.  I was very disappointed with this dish.  I reduced the amount of curry quite a bit, but the curry flavor was still really overpowering, and in my opinion, it didn't blend well with the sweetness of the applesauce.  The pork chops also turned out really dry.  I definitely won't be making this one again.

Tasted good but I found that the meat did not get really tender.
