Campbell's recipes are usually good starter recipes, like this one. I am giving 4 stars for the potential here.  I have been here before with this type of recipe :)  I recommend seasoning the chicken with garlic and onion powder and just a dash of celery salt, along with S&P.  It is just too bland without. I also added in sauteed onions. So delicious! Going into my rotation for sure!  Also all I had was Campbell's cheese soup and it turned out wonderfully.

I was skeptical because my wife is not a fan of broccoli so I left the broccoli flowerets out and just used the soup. It was great! Placed it all over a bed of brown rice. So easy and so healthy. Great meal that takes such little time.

This was easy, tasty and filling. We used frozen broccoli and added brown rice. It was a little bland, but probably a pinch of salt would have taken care of that (we're cutting back so we skipped it - still good and pretty darn healthy!).

This was a good base for a delicious meal! I added onions and garlic in with the butter. After sauteeing those until they are translucent, I then added seasoned, diced chicken to the mix. I find that diced chicken cooks much more evenly, especially in a skillet meal like this. I seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, and garlic powder to give it a little more flavor. I actually ended up using two cans of the broccoli cheese soup because I needed more liquid to put everything over brown rice at the end. A few extra steps and this goes from OK to delish!

We really enjoyed this dish.  I had to improvise because I didn't have the Broc.Cheese soup. Used Celery soup and some block cheese, plus subbed chicken broth for the water. It was scrumptious! Can't wait to try it with the proper ingredients. I did use sauteed mushrooms, bell pepper and onion before adding the chicken, which I floured before browning.  And per other suggestions, I used garlic etc. This would be so good with other veggies. Served it along side sliced tomatoes and bread. Made such a pretty colored dish. YUM!

This is soooo easy and filling! I always put it over rice and it does the trick. It can be a little bland though so any help on that would be great
