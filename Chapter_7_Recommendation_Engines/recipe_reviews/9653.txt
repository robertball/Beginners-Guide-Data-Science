Iv'e made this recipe twice now. The first time I followed the refridgerator cooling time exactly but the second time I tried only keeping the dough in the fridge for an hour or so and ya know what? It came out exactly the same! I though four hours had seemed a wee bit too long and it was. Same results same taste in way less than half the time! I do add two cups of brown sugar however because I'm a brown sugar junkie and a flavor of brown sugar lessens so much after baking with it so two cups seems to be satisfactory. I know it seems like a lot of sugar but it's soooooo yummy. Also try adding chocolate chips for some really yummy choco-chip cookies!

I thought this was great. The cookies were moist and chewy and stayed thusly for several days. I added a 1/2 cup of white sugar substituted half/half for the water and heavy cream and did not refridgerate the dough. Otherwise I prepared the recipe exactly as stated and it was grand. My family couldn't get enough of these cookies!

This recipe was ok but A little bland. I added white sugar in with the recipe and also sprinkled white sugar to the tops of these cookies. Just to give them some better flavor. I will continue my search for a better sugar cookie recipe.

I agree with another viewer - they're not sweet enough. I like things not tooo sweet but these tasted too "healthy" - double the brown sugar and use TWO pinches of salt to bring out the flavor. These would be good as thumprint (jam) cookies or with a 1/2 tsp cinnamon added. The texture was nice very buttery.

This dough was easy to make and easy to work with. Not too sticky at all. I made huge cutouts and they didn't dry out in the oven get too crispy or burn. They needed some frosting to be perfect (in my opinion). I used to sugar cookie icing yellow sugar and mini chocolate chips on mine to try to make sunflower cookies.

These are delicious! But it is the only cookie that I can't stop eating so I won't allow myself to make them anymore.

I messed with the recipe some. I increased the flour by 1/2 cup. I doubled the vanilla and brown sugar I also added about a 1/4 c. white sugar. When I took them out of the oven they smelled PHENOMENAL! I loved them. My 2 year old loves them too.

I am constantly looking for dessert recipes with less than copious amounts of sugar and I'm thrilled to say this is a great one. I even substituted 25% of the flour with ground flax meal to add some omega-3s and it was awesome. My husband is crazy about these too. I despise our American sugar obsession and can appreciate the subtle sweetness these cookies offer.

Really good cookie. My daughter is hard to please and she loves them too. Only problem was not enough brown sugar for us. I used 2 cups like oe of the other reviewers did. That made them perfect. I am going to make another batch tomorrow.

I liked them a lot. I used 1 cup of brown sugar instead of 2 and chilled for less than half the time. They came out great but have more of a sweet tea-time biscuit flavor than an American traditional cookie flavor. The texture was really pleasant. Easier than I expected. Someone said they are too rich and I can't imagine what they mean. They are pretty mild as far as cookies go.

These were pretty good. I added a half cup of white sugar too. They weren't all that sweet but they tasted better the next day. The kids ate them up.

I made these for my snack durng the week. I don't like the doughy quality of my cookies but I will tweak your version until it comes out right. I loved the icing. It really added to the cookies.

I used this recipe for Christmas cutouts. I'd been using my mothers recipe for years and years. This recipe is MUCH better. ( sorry mom ) I followed the recipe exactly except the whipping cream. I had none on hand but...I added a shot of eggnog instead. LOL. I think the cookies are perfectly sweet and crisp. I also refrigerated for only an hour. No problems.

I was looking for a brown sugar cookie recipe that would work well for using cookie cutters. I didn't want to frost them so I followed other reviews advice and doubled the brown sugar. If you want to frost them less sweet would probably be good. I also added a little more salt dash of cinnamon and a few drops of almond extract. I put a pecan and sprinkles on several of them and left some plain. Delicious both ways and kept their shape beautifully. I gave them out for Christmas and received many compliments!

These are ok. A decent basic sugar cookie that bakes up very crisp and tastes nice. Only thing is that the dough is extremely stiff and needed a lot of extra liquid. When I rolled the chilled dough out (which I only chilled for 2 hours and 1 would have been fine) it kept wanting to crack and split. Next time I make it I ll chill it for only half an hour and add more butter and sugar probably a fourth cup of each.
