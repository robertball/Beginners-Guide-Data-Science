This was excellent!!  At age 73 I like spicy foods, but not KILLER spicy.  I omitted the cayenne pepper from the sauce--turned out to be perfect for me.  As another viewer suggested, I left the shrimp in the bag after the first shaking, refrigerated it for about 20 minutes while I finished my scotch and water and the deep fryer was heating to temperature, and then sifted excess flour off.  Placed in the deep fryer for 3 minutes, removed and covered with the sauce.  PERFECTOMENTO!!  I served it to myself with a spinach salad with mushrooms, hard boiled eggs, bacon bits, and the spinach dressing  from another contributer to this site.  I highly recommend this to any young, middle-age, or senior citizen.

I'm the person who orginally entered this recipe.  We tried something different the last time we made it - we dipped the shrimp in egg and then flour, then repeated this.  It put a heavier coating on the shrimp.  My husband like this way better, I still prefer the original recipe.  Just thought I'd share this information with you...Janet Roetzel

If you don't like spicy, this isn't the recipe for you if you don't have the sense to adjust it to your own taste!  I made these tonight, my husband isn't even a big shrimp fan but he really liked these.  Although there is no way I'm cooking anything that calls for 4 cups of oil for deep frying, I followed the instructions to a T and sprayed them with Pam, broiled them and then tossed them in the sauce.  EXCELLENT!!!
A definite keeper, thank you Janet.

I used collassal shrimp and a fry baby type deep fryer and found that this is the way to go with the really big shrimp. Take them out as soon as they just turn golden. I've made rubber out of the big shrimp when boiling or grilling or they aren't done enough. These are fantastic. We love Buffalo Chicken Wings and I have a standard recipe I use for the sauce using Frank's Hot sauce (it's slightly garlicky as it is) and butter. I used that instead of making the sauce in the recipe. These were terrific! I've made them several times so far and I'll make them again.

This was an easy dinner to prepare. I served it with rice and garlic bread for a complete meal. For the coating, I left the shrimp in the bag for the 15 minutes, then shook them again (someone else suggested it) as opposed to laying the shrimp out on a cookie sheet in the fridge. My suggestion is to remove the tails, for simpler eating. And, instead of making the suggested "hot sauce" I just microwaved some butter with Frank's Hot Sauce -- worked fine.

My husband and I could have eaten twice as much shrimp as I actually made.  As a vegetable I used the flour mixture to coat big chunks of zucchini and fried them too... what a meal!

Wonderful!  Thought it was a simple recipe however it had GREAT taste.  Just a word of caution though to those who are sensitive to spicy food, my fiance thought it was a little too hot.  I, however, thought it was just perfect.

These were sooo good! We will be having these again and again. I made cheesy ranch new red potatoes( from this site) and the flavors went really well together. Next time I'll do some chicken wings using this recipe as well. Would be great for a party or get together as well as part of a meal.

I made this recipe tonight for dinner, it was excellent! It was fairly easy to prepare and was pretty much like something you'd order in a restaurant. It wasn't super crispy it was tender-crispy. I made two pounds of shrimp instead of one and didn't have to double anything else the flour was enough, I just made a bit more sauce. Oh yes I heated the butter and garlic in the microwave to soften it up and then added the hot sauce, then drained it to get rid of the garlic so as not to scare my husband too much (he gets heartburn). It really was scrumptious. This is the first time I ever made buffalo shrimp....great.

Absolutely delicious! I DID dip the shrimp in an egg wash before coating with the flour mix to give it a "heaver" coating & it turned out great.

 I also added a little orange juice to the Buffalo sauce to add a little sweetness and cut back on the butter, squeezed with fresh lemon while hot & served with a home-made Blue Cheese Coleslaw & 5-Cheese Garlic Bread =)

We absolutely LOVED this! my husband was asking for seconds! i didnt have creole seasoning so i used Cajun Seasoning... Also i dipped the shrimp in egg first and then the flour mix, i did this twice so it can be thick. Delicious! i used Franks Hot Sauce since my husband loves it so i just added butter =)

Fabulous!  I took one reviewers suggestion -- sprayed with pam and broiled for 2 minutes each side.  The result was a healthy AND yummy shrimp appetizer!  Also, I dredged half in flour once as originally suggested, and with the other half, I ran through egg yolk and dredged a second time.  The result was a thicker, heavier coating, again very yummy.  The twice-dredged shrimp needed an extra minute under the broiler to crisp up.  This was so easy to make and a nice alternative to the boring chicken wings.  It's a keeper!

This recipe is awesome!  I used a bottled buffalo sauce I had on hand to make this a little quicker, so I can't review the sauce.  We made tacos out of it.  Tortilla, shredded lettuce, drizzle of homemade ranch dressing, sprinkle of blue cheese crumbles, buffalo shrimp...  YUMMY!  Next time I will try dipping in egg then flour for a thicker coating, but I loved the original recipe as is.  Thanks for sharing!

Loved these! Perfect for me and my husband, though we did leave out the cayenne in the sauce, since Franks does the job well on it's own. Definitely going to use this recipe from now on. Thanks!

We have made this several times and it has always been terrific!  One step I don't do anymore though, is place the shrimp on a cookie sheet.  Instead, I leave them in the bag of flour mix and put them in fridge.  Then I just gently toss them again before cooking. Nummy! Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe! I used a package of frozen, cooked medium size shrimp. They shrink but it was still really good. I would have prefered a bit more hot sauce, so adjust to your taste.

OK, so we have a sports bar in our area called Taco Mac, which features my favorite menu item when eating out, Angry Shrimp.  This is close to that recipe.  I tweaked it just a bit to make it more closely match Taco Mac's version.  I used large shrimp from Costco, which I removed the tails because they are enormous even without them and much easier to eat.  I used a blended Canola/Soybean Oil to fry them in.  The sauce was actual just the butter and a healthy portion of Taco Mac Wing Sauce(I bought a bottle at our local TM)  These were  near dead on to Taco Mac's version.   Great recipe!  Thanks for sharing.

Made these last night and they were good. I used EVOO for the frying and they didn't get as crispy as I had hoped so I would recommend a different oil. I also used a bottled Buffalo sauce (that I love) so that was easy.  I served it with a spinach salad and long grain rice.  Tasty - will keep practicing to make better.

This recipe was very good. I followed the advice from some other people and dipped it in egg before putting it in the flour. I also skipped the part about putting the shrimp on a cookie sheet. I'm not a huge fan of very spicy food and this was just right for me. My boyfriend loves very spicy food and added some more hot sauce to his. Thanks for the recipe!

This was yummy! Spicy and good at the same time - to make things a bit different we also added in a pinch or two of Old Bay Seasoning. Slight recommendation though: unless you are using a deep fryer, the amount of oil is way too much! Try cutting back to maybe two or three, particularly if you find the batter is coming off the shrimp.

My fiance absolutely loved this recipe! We usually eat buffalo wings and shrimp at Hooters and he said this was better than their recipe! I only used 12 oz of raw large shrimp and I peeled them and took the tails off instead. I also marinated the shrimp for about an hour in Franks, garlic and cayenne pepper before coating them with flour. So yummy!

WOW!!! This recipe was OUTSTANDING!!!! My husband LOVED it! 
The only thing that I changed was that I used 1 cup of flour and 3/4 tablespoon of the cayenne pepper and left the shrimp in the flour mixture. I used Frank's Red Hot Wing Sauce. Thank you so much for sharing!

My husband and I just made this recipe for dinner tonight...it was awesome!!  We did make a few changes...for the shrimp we used frozen cooked shrimp instead of fresh; they were fine, we just lessened the cook time slightly (we also took the tails off).  Instead of just rinsing them off with water we did the egg wash like some other reviewers suggested.  It worked really well.  For the hot sauce, we used Frank's which everyone said was the best, and they were right.  And we also pan-fried the shrimp. The sauce and the shrimp were both great! This recipe was super easy too!  We were so sad when the shrimp were gone. :(  We can't wait to make it again!

Terrific!  I added 1/4 cup honey to the sauce and let it simmer while cooking the shrimp - I like my wings and shrimp "hot-n-honey" style when they are "buffalo'd"

This was SO good!! The only change I made was to use one cup of flour instead of two (still had a ton of mix left over) but with the stated quantities of spices. I also just put the mix and shrimp in a lidded bowl, shook, refrigerated, then shook again. The shrimp take no time at all to cook, maybe 30 seconds per side. Served with the hot sauce, and Ranch. Amazing. Thanks so much!

Just delicious! I made this with tiger prawns and everyone loved it. Try using the garlic butter hot sauce as a dip instead of coating the shrimp with it, it turns out great.

This is amazing! My husband isn't much on spicy foods but he loves these shrimp. I always buy 2 lbs of fresh shrimp just for this and there is never any leftovers. I will say, I don't put as much pepper in the hot sauce to keep the "kick" down. Also, since I make this so often, I keep the ziplock bag sealed up and in the freezer for the next time to reduce waste. Great recipe!

admittedly i didnt have creole seasoning on hand so i tried it with chili powder instead. i think that made the taste a bit off but it still was pretty good. But ended up VERY spicy.

This was excellent as written! You can easily adjust the heat to your liking. I used medium shrimp and deep fried them at 360 for 2:30 minutes. Perfect!

These are really good shrimp. My husband and I kinda tweaked the recipe a little though. We added Worcestershire sauce, extra garlic to the sauce and used 12 oz of hot sauce instead of 6. They turned out amazing.

I tried this last week, but broiled it like one of the reviewers suggested. The texture was not so good -- but the flavor merited a second try. I made it again this week, using the double-coat egg suggestion of the author and pan-fried it in 1/2" of oil. THIS WAS FANTASTIC! My husband -- who doesn't like "different food" --said I could put this into my weekly rotation! Other than peeling and deveining the shrimp, this is quick and easy. I'll definitely make it again.

I combined this with 'Coconut Shrimp I' and only used the Creole seasoning (homemade!). The sauce is really spicy, even made without the teaspoon of cayenne. I've made a buffalo wing recipe from here that wasn't as spicy as this, and will use that sauce next time. Good as modified.

Loved it!  I am kinda a sissy so I added only 1tsp. of cayenne pepper to the flour.  Next time I will be able to amp up the heat.  Very good recipe.

These were hot hot hot hot...I like hot/spicy food and this was too much. I would cut the cayenne in half next time. These were crispy right out of the oil and I recommend tossing them in the sauce right away and eating them ASAP because they get cold quick. I think I might try to do the egg wash then flour then egg wash then flour next time to give them a little more coating but overall these ROCKED the house!

This is really good - and really spicy! It was also quick and easy to make. The only thing I don't like about it is that you have to eat it all right away (shrimp doesn't reheat as forgivingly as chicken). Next time, I'll do this in 2 batches (it really is quick) so my son can enjoy his fresh when he gets home from work. Thanks for the recipe!

YUM!! I loved this! I took the deep fat fryer outside on the deck so the house didn't get all stunk      up and boy was it worth it! The only thing I was sad about is that I didn't make more... I will be sure to next time!!

This is such a great recipe, my mother who hates seafood liked it! For the sauce I used the recipe from this site for Restaurant Style Buffalo wings and served it on the side.  It was wonderful!! I did cut down on the cayenne in the flour mixture by about half.

WOW, you werent kidding when you said they were hot.  I even tried numbing the recipe by adding tomato paste, a bit of milk, some ketchup, garlic bbq sauce, and a bit of ranch dressing.  It turned out awesome and everyone loved it. . .as soon as their mouths stopped burning!  I love it, Perfect recipe, definately a keeper!

I am from Buffalo, and this reminds me of the wings my Mom used to make -- except with Shrimp!  I also added a 1T of vinegar to the sauce (that's the way we always did it) and reduced the garlic a touch, but excellent!! YUMMMM!

I loved this recipe.  My husband loved this recipe.  I will make it again.  The shrimp i used were too small (my own fault) but it was still good.  Would be great if you removed the tails before frying and then mixed the shrimp with pasta and then added the sauce...really delish!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a really good recipe, like some others I
cut the cayenne down to 1/2 tsp and it was still 
really hot. I will add more cajun spice and omit the cayenne next time. I did not make the sauce in the recipe instead we used about 1 cup of Franks store bought hot sauce with 1 tbl butter and 1 tsp garlic powder, heat to blend and it was excellent.

My husband loved these shrimps.  According to him, I "outdid myself".  To me, however, the shrimps were okay.  I ate some with the buffalo sauce and without.  I preferred the ones without the sauce but again they were just okay and nothing spectacular.  I guess this is also because I'm not big into spicy food as my husband is.

This was pretty good, but not as "all out spectacular" as I was expecting.

I had a dish like this 5 years ago at the Eagles Nest, a sports bar owned by former Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Ron Jaworski.  My mouth was in heaven then and I've been searching for a comparable recipe since then.  This is it!!  Fantastic!

Awesome! I used 2TBaby Bam (Emerald's recipe) and 1T creole seasoning and just a bit of cayanne pepper for my young guests. Everyone loved it. These are the kind of recipes that this site was made for! I made about 3 pounds of shrimp and had enough flour seasoning for another pound.

We made those tonight and they were absolutely delicious !! The batter is perfectly seasoned and mouth watering! We did not use the buffalo sauce recipe and simply used Frank's Red Hot and it was absolutely perfect! Will make these over and over again !

I made these the other night and followed the recipe to a tee. They were okay, but not outstanding. I found the outer coating of flour and spices to be soggy, even after letting the shrimp sit on paper towels. The coating also fell off pretty easily. I don't know if it's worth the time and effort to make these again.

Outstanding.  This was my first experience cooking shrimp and knew exactly what I wanted to do.  This recipe lead me to it.  This is not extremely spicy... it's pretty much what you'd expect of anything touting the name "buffalo" in the headline.  You'll have leftover powder and sauce... maybe this would be good with fish as well?

For the chicken wing lovers - it's the same but with shrimp instead!    I followed some other reviewer's advice and did 2 things: dipped it in an egg wash and again in the flour mixture for a little thicker coating and also used store-bought "Frank's Hot Sauce"  partly because I was lazy and didn't know how 'hot' the buffalo sauce recipe would turn out (although it sounds yummy too).   It was an easy prep, quick to cook, and MmMmm tastey!  This recipe is definitely a keeper -says the boyfriend.

This turned out well. I made some adjustments for dietary restrictions; used arrowroot powder rather than flour, halved the flour mixture, which was plenty, just used buffalo wing sauce for the buffalo sauce rather than add the butter, etc. I also pan fried in olive oil rather than frying. Tasted "fried", but a little bit healthier than deep frying! YUMMMMMMMM!

This was very yummy me and DH enjoyed it very much and he is not much of a shrimp eater. I used Franks Redhot sauce in mine and we didn't find it to spicy. I served ours with a homemade ranch since I don't care for blue cheese. Will def make this one again since it passed DH's test ;)

Came out pretty good. I used egg and only dipped the shrimp once (impatient). The shrimp were crispy and had a good flavor.

this was quite good. i used jumbo? shrimp, 26/31 count per lb. next time i'll use two lbs. as one lb. is barely enough for two servings if you like shrimp like we do. i also made some buffalo chicken legs with the same recipe. i call them hot legs. used my trusty lectric fry pan.
do not over cook the shrimp, as soon as you get them all in there, start to turn once and then remove.

This was delicious!  Had people over for Monday Night Football & decided to try this.  I should have doubled the recipe.  I did take other's suggestions and used Franks Hot Sause & butter instead of making the sauce in the recipe.  ***The 2nd time I made these I shook the shrimp in the mixture, refridgerated in container for 20 minutes, then dipped shrimp in milk & shook in mixture again.  I also deep fried outside to avoid smelling up the hosue.  Wonderful Recipe!

According to my husband this is the best shrimp that I have ever made.  (I make alot of seafood dishes.)  It was very easy and tasted just like the Buffalo Shrimp I had on the coast in Savannah years ago!  Served with Blue Cheese and used Franks Hot Sauce.

These are awesome, and easy!  If you love Hooter's, then these are the shrimp for you.  Try using Frank's Louisiana Hot Sauce for that perfect zing and water chestnut flour so the sauce doesn't make the coating soggy.

The coating for the shrimp was absolutely delicious, with a great subtle spice. They turned out very nicely in the FryDaddy. The only reason I'm not giving this five stars is the sauce, I thought it was pretty terrible. The spiciness was good, but I should have taken my mother-in-laws advice and never use hot pepper sauce for buffalo sauce: it just had a terrible aftertaste. When I make this again I'll take the suggestions of a few others and melt some butter into my regular bottled wing sauce, then this will be a five! Thanks for sharing.

Yummy!  Made this for a potluck dinner.  Someone took a bite out of it and said, "This is soooo good...", while flailing the half eaten shrimp.  I was standing right there and they had no idea I made it or that I even cooked.  That made my day and almost made me forget what I paid for the shrimp.  Yikes!  I need to grow my own shrimp.  I thought the spicyness was just right, a few said it was hot but give it a try.  Very easy to make.

These are awesome! I do have to fry twice in order to get really crispy, but besides that they always turn out great! Only difference I make is that I don't add the minced garlic to the buffalo sauce. I don't think it even really needs it! Thanks for sharing!

these were tasty.. i used the creole recipe from here for the creole style seasoning, and intensified the seasoning the shrimp recipe called for by adding some ground habanero.. i used franks hot sauce and a few splashes of El Yucateco Salsa Picante de Chile habanero,.. I like my wings intense... I served with homemade fries and truffle cream, which i got from diners, drive-ins, and dives.. AFTER I fried the fries once, i dusted them with the left over flour for the buffalo shrimp and fried them again for a minute.. they were perfect.. i topped the fries with the truffle cream and instead of using ranch or blue cheese for the shrimp, used a side of the truffle cream for dipping... this was SCRUMPTIOUS.. THANKS FOR the recipe.. i enjoy the fact it was light and not heavy on the batter..

I was lazy and didn't add all the extra seasonings into the flour mixture, which I used half corn meal and half flour, just used the creole-style seasoning. Delicious. I left some without sauce for the kids. I'm using the leftover buffalo shrimp on my salad today for lunch.

I am a person who doesn't like shrimp and i liked this. I love the crunchiness that the flour mixture gives. The buffalo sauce covered the taste of the shrimp, so it also tastes good without the buffalo sauce. I used 2 pounds of shrimp and I didn't have to double the flour mixture.

These were great!!!  Better than Hooters which is exactly what I was craving on my cheat day.  I wld suggest using garlic butter in the sauce which is what I did (half regular butter and the remaining garlic butter).  I also seasoned the shrimp with Cajun seasoning before dipping in the flour.  We made these with fried green tomatoes and green salads.  My boyfriend was also crazy for these. Thanks for the great recipe!

Hubby signed me up to make buffalo wings and shrimp for a xmas party....gotta admit...I am so not a seafood eater. So, I found this recipe, it was super easy to make, and everyone raved about it. I did not make the sauce though, I have my own sauce that hubby likes.

This was wonderful.  I didn't dip them all in the sauce because my husband had really spicy food for lunch, so my daughter and I just dipped ours in the sauce one by one.  The only change I made was to use 2 1/2 Tbsp. of hot sauce--the same ratio as the butter.  My husband really liked the batter on the fried shrimp and said it was very flavorful.

Nope. Not Hooter's buffalo shrimp (not that this recipe claims to be...). I have been wanting to try this for a long while. I'm glad I did, but my fiance & I agree that when the "craving" strikes, we will go to the "chain." The ambience is more entertaining for sure (haha!)!!! I have a few "gripes." Here they are: a) my fiance & I like spicy foods (my fiance is the KING of HOT - just eat his pepepr shrimp... lol), & even he couldn't finish what was on his plate; he's got the tummy womblies now..., b) there is WAAAY too much sauce (and the Frank's sauce I used was WAAY too hot, IMHO, so choose wisely & use sparingly!!!); I suggest 1/2ing the amt. of sauce called for & using = parts butter/sauce (this is the standard recipe) & c) BE SURE TO SERVE W/ A COOL DIPPING SAUCE (it helps take the edge off - I served w/ blue cheese dressing); a sprinkling of fresh lemon also helps. I think the submitter's egg/double dip idea is great! It would yield a crispier text., similar to what you'd get @ Hooters. I also think the idea of placing your bag of shrimp (coated w/ flour) in the fridge is a good idea. I placed mine on a foil-lined cookie sheet, which ended up working well for me. My fiance held the fry daddy basket over the sheet, so there was no mess to clean up (we just folded the foil & tossed)! Served w/ fries, this was a suitable sub. for the "real" thing. I guess our innards are not as resistant as Gordon's tho, so this won't be a repeat with us. Thx. for sharing, JIGGYnFL!

I liked this, it was good, but I didn't really like it (4 stars) or love it (5 stars).  I liked the spice but didn't care for the crust, it wasn't crispy enough (or thick enough), got kinda doughy after sitting in the sauce.

I love anything hot, and this fit the bill. However, I used cooked shrimp and so they came out a little chewy, I served the sauce to my family from New Orleans and it was a big hit when I made it again for fresh shrimp that were grilled and fried. They took the recipe home with them!!!

I made these last night exactly as written and it was easy and good.  Not as hot as other reviewers have said. Way too much of the flour mixture left over though. I would cut that in half next time.

This was great!!!  We love hot, spicy food but usually it is not hot enough.  No worries with this recipe!  After reading other people's reviews we opted to not pour the sauce over the shrimp but rather just dip them in it.  The shrimp came out great, really crispy.  We will definitely make this again, thanks for the great recipe.

This was awesome and would have gotten five stars, except for one thing...I highly suggest using the sauce to dip the shrimp in rather than tossing them in it after cooking.  I tossed mine in the sauce and the breading became too soggy.  The taste was incredible but I prefer crunchier shrimp.

This was awesome! I used it as an appetizer at a party and everyone loved it. With ranch dressing to dip, it was great. I did have to fry it longer than it said, but other than that I followed the directions exactly.

Quick, easy, delicious.  When I'm in a hurry (and as a college student that's often) I skip the refrigeration part, and it's still very tasty.

I made this tonight for dinner.  Be CAREFUL it kicks butt and was actually over spicy in a bad way. (and we LOVE spicy food)  The breading was good, but the sauce was way too hot.  Next tme if I decide to  make this I'm going to change the sauce a bit.

This is wonderful.  My husband and I ate these at a local restaurant and I had to go searching for a recipe.  The coating is perfect and I usually buy bottled sauce from local restaurants that we like.  I've also used this coating on catfish nuggets.  The spices are perfect.  I pull off the tails before battering them, just easier to eat that way.  Also, I mix the coating in a bowl with a lid and throw in the shrimp and shake.  Put in the fridge about 15 minutes and shake again.  I've never had a problem with the coating coming off.  Tonight will be my 3rd time to make these in 2 weeks.  Anyone who likes shrimp and spice should love these!!  Thanks for the post.

I loved it and it came out great! I used medium sized shrimp and I must say, you have GOT to use jumbos for better flavor. I also halved the recipe and it was still too much.

This was sooooo good!!  I used the recipe for both shrimp and chicken for the Superbowl and it went over GREAT!!  I didn't think I'd have enough buffalo sauce so I tripled it for 5 lbs of shrimp and a load of wings.  This WAS NOT necessary!!  We like things SPICY and a little bit goes a LONG way!  I used Louisiana Hot Sauce as my base.  Yummy!!!

I agree with others, there's no need to take the shrimp and put them on a cookie sheet. Shake, leave in bag and shake again after taking out of the frig. We liked them alot, but next time I'm going to try baking instead of frying them.  Will try a 400 degree oven till they turn pink.

She isn't kidding when she says they like it HOT!  I *loved* the shrimp just after frying in the double-coating; the sauce was a bit hard for me to take, but I can see where a real leather-tongue, like one of my sons, would love it! Maybe I am just getting old!  Delicious coating.

This was a great recipe and so easy!  I did as the others suggested and kept the shrimp in the bag rather than place on cookie sheet. Also I didn't have enough hot sauce only 2oz, and it was more than spicy enough for my husband and I. My husband wanted less garlic next time(that's just his personal thing, not much into garlic)..We used the end sauce more like a dip rather than putting it on top of the shrimp.
I just loved it!

pretty good - breading was a little thin, and sauce was too garlicky with just mincing - I'll really pulverize the cloves next time and maybe only use 3.  Spicy & delicious however

Our family loves this recipe.  We make the sauce  a lot hotter though.  We use 3oz hotter pepper sauce and 3oz of a habanero-based pepper sauce.

I had put off making these due to the frying but I saw the other review that broiled them.  I followed the ingredients as written.  Left the shrimp in the bag for the 20 minutes of fridge time and then sprayed with oil and broiled.  It came out really well.  I served them in lettuce wraps.

Awesome recipe. I skipped the butter and cut down the oil. Used medium shrimp and frank's hot sauce. I didn't have Créole seasoning but there's more than enough flavor to keep me happy :)

This is my first time writing a review and I've been a member forever. OMG this was fabulous. And KGOLD what a great idea to use the breading for veggies. Wish I ould have had read your review first. Onion rings would be great. This is a real keeper. I used the spice that Steak and Shake sells, has everything in it and just added cayenne. Thanks for sharing!

This was awesome. I used the flour mixture as written and left the shrimp right in the bag to refrigerate, it was simpler and less mess. For the second coating, I used an egg wash and creole seasoned panko bread crumbs and fried in canola oil. FANTASTIC crunch and flavor, these were good all by themselves. I made the sauce as written using Frank's red hot and then dipped them in Marie's blue cheese dressing. Loved it!

This was a big hit! It was delicioso! The only thing I did differently was I skipped the cayenne pepper and only tossed the shrimp in the flour and seasonings just once. And I used buffalo sauce instead of the hot pepper sauce. Turned out excellent. I used a little over 30 shrimps and it was more than enough. I thank you for having such a wonderful recipe and sharing it with us. If I have a family dinner party to attend opr having guests over my home....this will def be on the table! YUM!

I held back on the cayenne in the buffalo sauce since my husband doesn't like real spicy food.  This time he liked it and I thought it was too spicy.  I think next time I will hold off on placing my portion in the sauce and just dip them in when I want the flavor.  I did not deep fry, pan fried.

Such a great recipe! I followed some of the other reviewers advice: left them in the bag and did not deep fry, cooked on the skillet instead. Still came out amazing! Also I dipped them in buttermilk and then threw them in the bag. A quick and tasty recipe!

This was amazing. My wife doesn't normally eat stuff with buffalo sauce on it, but using some Tabasco Garlic sauce and butter as the buffalo sauce instead of the recipe's really made this a nice mild heat. Definitely going to do this one again!

I replaced the onion powder with cumin and used sriracha (the vietnamese hot sauce with the green cap) for the buffalo sauce. I also left the shrimps in the bag instead of laying them out. Turned out really tasteful. I had it with my gf, and we drank a Chardonnay that complimented the food perfectly.

After a lot of modifications, these shrimp turned pretty well.  Cut the flour in half, double all the remaining dry ingredients and add 1 Tbls. red chili powder or flakes.  Skip the sauce! It just makes the shrimp soggy and doesn't taste like anything but hot grease.  Use your own favorite dipping sauce.

These tasted awesome! My only problem was the sauce made the crispy shell soggy. Maybe I just used too much sauce. I used Franks RedHot because it's my favorite!

Wow!!! These sure were spicy!!! They were a nice change from buffalo chicken which is one of my favorite meals!!! I tried to be a little healthier by grilling them but the batter didn't get real crunchy, but still not bad at all!!! Make sure you like it spicy though cause I love it the hotter the better & even I thought they were pretty darn hot!!!! Really yummy though :)

The batter on this was amazing, but I changed up the sauce and simply used Frank's Red Hot and melted butter.  Much simpler and tasted just like quality pub/bar buffalo sauce!

Yum! I love a dish similar to this at our local 'Cheeseburger in Paradise'. I am so happy that I can make it at home! Like others I did use Frank's Red Hot and about one tbs of margarine as the sauce. My boyfriend and I gobbled them up!

Very tasty. I served it with blue cheese dressing, and my husband really liked it. I have also substituted the shrimp in this recipe for Tilapia. Tastes just as good if you are not a big shellfish eater.

This was fabulous!  My husband is allergic to chicken and this TOTALLY satisfied his craving for something buffalo style.  I used much less oil - probably about 2 cups (or less) of peanut oil and fried them in a large skillet.  I did not make the sauce - just tossed the shrimp right before serving with some Louisiana Hot Sauce.  There is NO need for all that extra butter (although it probably is tasty).  I'll be making this again very soon!

Wow--I had Buffalo Shrimp at a Hooters restaurant in Jacksonville FL and decided that I wanted to make the dish at home.  This recipe was better than Hooter's Buffalo Shrimp and cheaper to make at home.  I wouldn't change a thing.

Very good recipe! Only change I would make is to double the onion powder. I did not make the hot sauce this time but look forward to trying it next time.

I've made this recipe quite a few times. I love it! I think it's hot but...but a little bland. I like to add more caynenne and some garlic salt (as the recipe has no salt). WOW!!! What a difference! I also don't use the sauce. I think it's perfect without it. My fiance loves it too! I like to make the shrimp and have it over a nice salad with honey mustard dressing...or even a nice vinaigrette. This is also good to use on chicken wings. This recipe is a keeper!

I thought that my hubby would really like this, being a lover of both fried shrimp and pepper sauce. I was wrong.I decided to coat one in the sauce beforehand,just to let him taste it before I coated them all and was glad I did. He didn't really care for it. He did like the breading, though. He ended up foregoing the sauce and just eating the shrimp with cocktail sauce instead.

This recipe was absolutely delicious, not for the calorie conscious.  The only change I made was that I substituted garlic pepper (1 tbsp.) for regular pepper.  Dipping the shrimp in the buffalo sauce was awesome...the buffalo sauce was SOOOO GOOD and so easy to make!

This recipe was really tasty, but also very spicy. My husband loved it though! When i made the sauce, i put a little less cayenne than stated, and it was still very spicy. I would probably make this again though.

This recipe rocks!  The batter is delish and not too spicy at all.  Most of the heat is in the sauce so I served it on the side as a dipping sauce.  The batter was nice and crispy and with the sauce on the side everyone was able to enjoy it both ways.  It was yummy!  I couldn't find any fresh shrimp at the market so I bought pre-cleaned frozen jumbo prawns and just thawed them on their skewers for 20 minutes.  I took them off the skewers and made them according to the recipe.  They were wonderful and the best part was I didn't have to clean the shrimp!  I made the sauce using Franks Buffalo Hot Sauce and it was great.  I bet this recipe would make wicked chicken wings too!

very good recipe made shrimp excactly as recipe, but instead of sauce made a beer batter and added hot sauce as part of liquid, I used 3 ounces but can be adjusted to spiceiness to your taste. after dipping shrimp in flour mixture I dipped into batter and deep fried for 2 minutes. the shimp can be frozen this way and reheated in 450 degree oven for 10 to 15 minutes.

We just finished this yummy dish...and loved it! I used my new DeLonghi deep fryer and the shrimp were super crisp & delicious. I used Paul Prudhomme's seafood seasoning with the flour and omitted the onion powder. I served itwith a sliced tomato salad with a bleu cheese vinaigrette and red beans & rice. Really terrific! Thank you for this!

Was tasty but a bit messy.  Everyone loved the sauce but thought it would taste better on Chicken Wings.  Would make again but substitute chicken for shrimp.

An excellent party snack, However the flour mixture makes enough for 2 or more pounds of shrimp. As others have said, its a lot less messy if you leave the shrimp in the bag. I also used Frank's Hot Sauce with good results.

The buffalo sauce was way too hot for us (and we love spicey food).  It tasted better as I burped it up all night then it did going down.

Too spicy.  The batter was amazing and I ate the fried shrimp without the sauce added.  My husband ate the rest.  He enjoyed the batter as well and suggested we leave off the hot sauce next time as the batter was perfect to deep fry the shrimp.

Solid. I used Frank’s Red Hot 2:1 with unsalted butter. After dipping the shrimp in flour and refrigerating, I dunked em in some whisked egg and milk and coated them in flour again, set in fridge for additional 10 min then fried.

Very tasty, but the next time I make it, I will leave the sauce on the side. Mixing the two takes away from the crunchiness . Would make again.

Really good and super easy. Did not have Creole seasoning, thankfully had all the ingredients to make some. Added blue cheese crumbles and put it in a wrap. Delicious!

Didn't have "pepper" sauce so I used sriracha sauce and added 3 T sugar. It was excellent!! Would have liked a little thicker coating. Next time I would dip it in egg before the second flour dip.

I made this the first time just to see and I couldn't get them out of the fryer fast enough as my kids were eating them as I cooked them. This last time I made them we used them as shrimp tacos with lettuce, broccoli slaw, and the same buffalo sauce (Frank's was our sauce base). This has easily become one of those meals everyone looks forward to eating!

We will definitely be making this again. As written it wasn't too spicey. I wouldn't change a thing unless you want to turn up the heat. Very quick and easy to prepare.

This is amazing!!!
So Delicious  and the taste and texture was so rich.
I made it twice the first time I followed the recipe step by step, it was so hot and spicy for us. So the second time I put half and half buffalo sauce and BBQ sauce. it taste very good.

With the sauce, it was really spice, but delicious! The batter wasn't too thick and it cooked up nicely in a cast iron skillet.

WOW was this good!  I did coat my jumbo shrimp with cornstarch and then some egg white wash before coating with the seasoning.  The flavor is spot on!  Made two batches- one with the heat and one without for folks who prefer it mild.  Perfect appetizer with a round beers.

Wowza! This is so good. This recipe was absolute perfection. Only thing I did different was whisk up the garlic butter sauce over a pot of boiling water on the stovetop, so it was well blended and smooth. I also had to strain the sauce because my family are not big garlic fans. However, it was still delicious!! Squeeze a little lemon on top, dip in ranch. Mmmmmyum!!!

This was one of the best recipes yet! I used Texas Pete hot sauce to make this and it turned out perfectly. It was spicy, but not an overload of spiciness. These would probably work great as a dish for a party. I definitely recommend it!!

Followed recipe to a "T" ... used Texas Pete's and plenty of minced garlic to make the sauce.  Perfect for those who like it hot and garlicky! 
Thanks for the recipe!

We made this almost exactly the same as the recipe calls for but used Frank's Buffalo sauce instead of making the sauce and we also used about a pound and a half of shrimp without using less flour mixture. It turned out awesome. The fried shrimp itself was pretty good before adding the sauce.

These had great flavor. The shrimp can be shallow fried in a skillet to save oil. I might coat them twice next time (to better absorb the sauce) Use unsalted butter for the sauce, it works towards dulling the tart hot sauce. We enjoyed these with grits and roasted sunchokes.

Love, love, love this recipe!!! My husband is a huge buffalo fried shrimp fan and always looking for it on a menu when we go out... He said this beats anything he has tried before! I actually ran out of creole-style seasons so added some white pepper instead. Otherwise followed the recipe as stated. Just perfect, thanks so much!!!

OMG!! probably better than buffalo wings, since they cook within just a few minutes. 
I changed the recipe slightly, didn't have any creole seasoning, so I just did half adobo and half of another all purpose seasoning. Also didn't add the garlic to the buffalo sauce. I used Frank's Red Hot Buffalo Sauce- absolutely the best. I will be making these again, and again, and again!

Holy Buffalo deliciousness! I followed directions exactly, except I kept the shrimp in the flour mixture instead of placing them on a cookie sheet, per another review. I did not make the sauce, I used Sweet Baby Ray's Wing sauce. Outstanding. This will be used for chicken in the future as well.

This recipe is excellent and not much different from the wing recipe I use. For the flour mixture, I left out the onion powder (because I didn't have any) and added a tsp. of paprika and salt. I used the egg wash suggestion for a thicker coat and to allow for a little longer cook time while making the shrimp a little more crispy. At 375, they cook fast - closer to 2.5 minutes. For the sauce, I used 1/2 cup Sweet Baby Ray's Buffalo Wing sauce (Frank's would work too) and a 1/4 cup butter heated for 2 minutes in the microwave which may be a little less hot for those that want to reduce the heat. To avoid getting the crispy shrimp soggy, I used the sauce for dipping instead of tossing and had some blue cheese dressing and celery sticks on hand. Easy prep, delicious result. My family loved them!
Thank you JIGGYnFL!

Great recipe!  Good little appetizer for a football Sunday!  I went by the recipe 100% and it was a true success.  If you are a spicy food lover you may want to add more cayenne pepper and potentially allow the shrimp to marinate in the flower mixture a little longer, but the recipe as is adds just the right amount of punch.

I followed this recipe exactly and the flavor was very good; however it was almost too hot to eat for our family.  We like spicy food, but this was more like burn your face off level.  If I make it again, I will probably leave out the cayenne pepper. It was very flavorful though and for those who aren't afraid of fire mouth, it's a great one!

These are okay, a little strong on the hot sauce flavor, just too much of it, and the breading was soggy after dipping in the hot sauce.  My husband didn't complain, but I could only eat a couple.

Excellent!  Used this to make a buffalo shrimp salad with blue cheese dressing and it was wonderful.  Only changes I made:  half the flour and less than a quarter of the oil (pan-fried, not deep fat-fried) and I used canola oil.  I mixed Franks and Crystal for the hot sauce.  Will be making again soon! Thanks!

Wow!!  My sweetheart and I are sticklers for trying a recipe AS WRITTEN the first time and then playing with it when we don't like something.  I was pretty nervous about the amount of spice in this one, but it sounded tasty so we did it....holy &$@#!  This is SPICY!  But a GOOD spicy.  Not a burn your taste buds off spicy. There was so much amazing flavour, that even though we were laughing and reaching for the beer it was just soooo good we couldn't stop eating them!  Will make again and again!!

I always love Buffalo Shrimp at places like Chili's or TGI Friday's... but have never made them at home.   I tried this recipe and loved it!   I used Frank's Hot Sauce as the base and added the ingredients below.   I didn't change anything and it was fantastic!!     Only thing I did was after taking the shrimp out of the oil, I brushed the buffalo sauce on rather than dipping it.   They were great!!  I"m keeping the sauce to use on BBQ chicken to make Buffalo chicken!

These are sensentational!  Fixed a small batch for my husband and he loved them so much I went out on a limb and made them for our football party.  Serve them with the classic blue cheese dipping sauce or ranch too!

I probably had enough flour mixture for another half pound of shrimp.  Also, I'll probably use a little less hot sauce next time.  It wasn't too hot, but the shrimp were pretty soggy.  Otherwise a great recipe.

Great recipe for spicy shrimp. Coming from the west indies, my parents love spicy dishes, and my dad was thrilled when I made this. If you are not too keen on spicy food, serve the sauce on the side as a dipper, which I did for my dad, who cannot eat spicy food because of his condition. I used peeled and already cleaned shrimp and Maria's Haberno XXXtra Hot Sauce.

Mmmmmm.  Boy are these good!!!  I followed the recipe exactly.  I used Krystal hot sauce (for the hot pepper sauce), and added about 1 teaspoon of salt to the flour mixture and these turned out great.  I will definatley use this for a recipe for buffalo wings when I make them.  Delicious!!!

This recipe is terrific!  I ran out of cayenne pepper, so the Buffalo sauce was minus the 1 tsp.  It was still hot enough....and we LOVE spicy!  Definitely a keeper!

Yowzers, these were fabulous! My husband loves hot foods, and he raved. Next time I will leave the buffalo sauce on the side since it was a little hot for me. I loved how easy and quick the recipe was.. this one is a keeper!

I was't that impressed with this.  I have a feeling it may have been that I wasn't using a good-quality hotsauce.

Nice! added more hot sauce, we like it hotter! Put some onion powder in the Buffalo sauce to give it a bit more zing.

I made this recipe for Valentines Day dinner for my husband.  He likes very spicy food. I made this extra spicy!  This recipe got rave reviews from him, and we have added it to our list of favorite dishes.  Thanks for the excellent idea.

I totally loved this recipe!  It tasted so good.  I used the already cooked shrimp from the seafood deli and it tasted fantastic. I'm going to make this dish a regular at our table!
