I made this recipe exactly as stated without the peppers. I subbed in some a teaspoon of chili beak chili oil and the heat was perfect. My problem with the recipe is the cook time. It is way too long. This was perfect after just 3 hours. With such small pieces of chicken and squash you should not have to cook it for 7+ hours! It ruins the texture of the meat and the squash and turns them into mush. After just 3 hours they were perfect and the flavors were distinctive and delicious. I wish I had gone with my gut and took it off the heat at that time. I rated the recipe as it is written. We did not like it overcooked and mushy. I recommend cooking this for no longer than 3 hours and then it's almost 4 stars for me. It smells great the first few hours of cooking too. I might try it again with the lower cooking time.

First, let me say this recipe is delicious! I don't have any chili peppers so I added a spritz of hot sauce and Worstershire sauce to add some savory flavor. I also added spinach for additional food value. My only criticism is the prep time. The author gave a 15 minute prep, but it took more than 45 minutes. Prepping the chicken and onions required extra work and time. I'm glad I made this dish. I wonder if some of the work can be done the night before so I can just start the crock pot first thing in the morning.

I added mushrooms and crushed heirloom tomatoes to add texture and flavor. Served with a side of fresh sopapillas with honey. A perfect fall meal!

Sorry, but this was just too plain for us.  I'd rather have done something else with the chicken thighs and squash.

I will make it again based on the broth I just tasted. I don't know how the squash is going to turn out, though. I'm sure the chicken will turn out fine. I'm an avid fan of spicy cuisine, but I only used 1/2 of a jalapeno pepper and the broth is VERY spicy only after 3 hours of being in a slow cooker on low. I seldom can find Thai peppers in my area but when I can find them (and I love them), adding Thai to this recipe would have been too much heat. I also must say the photo looks like it has mushrooms in it, so unless I overlooked something in the recipe, I didn't add mushrooms, albeit there's still plenty of time to do such. Thanks for sharing.
