Very good recipe.  I used rice flour instead of garbanzo bean flour. I'm not a big fan of the garbanzo flour's nutty flavor and grittiness. Also skipped the sugar in the wet mixture because I was afraid it would be too sweet for our tastes. My 7 year old said it was the best GF pizza I've made so far.  I used parchment paper on the pan to avoid sticking and only baked at 420 (per needs of paper). Worked great!  Note to the cook who said the dough was gooey. GF doughs aren't like other bread doughs. They can't usually be kneaded and their consistency is usually between cake batter and cookie dough.

Important to note that the batter is much like pancake batter.  Spread it around as such and pre-bake.  Comes out great - all the kids asked for more cheese pizza and no one guessed it was gluten-free.

Fantastic - made 6 personal pizza crusts for my daughter, and they were her favorite gf crusts so far.  Like most gf recipes, the dough is thin, so I spread the dough onto parchment paper pretty thin (it is kind of like brownie batter constistency) and then prebaked and froze the crusts.  Thanks!

This crust is amazing!  My 5 year old loved it.  I took a taste myself and was very happy with the results.  If you are new to gluten free baking, please note that this crust will NOT be anything like the same consistency of a wheat pizza crust.  As other reviewers have said, it is very gooey.  Don't worry though, because once it is baked, it comes out perfect.  You can't roll this out with a roller.  You have to use your hand to spread it out into the size and shape you want on the cookie sheet.  I took another reviewers advise and put it on parchment paper when I baked them, and they just slid right off when they were done...perfect.  I made 5 small crusts for my kiddo. I baked them for 15 minutes, let them cool, then froze the remaining 4 in a gallon bag with parchment paper between them to prevent them from sticking together.  You definitely want it to bake for ~ 15 minutes before putting the toppings on.  My son is allergic to wheat, dairy, and eggs (among other things) so I had to modify the recipe a bit. I just didn't put any kind of cheese in it and it came out fine.  In place of the egg, I used my old standby of 1 Tbsp of flaxmeal to 3 Tbsp of warm water (this needs to thicken for ~15 minutes before using).  Another option for the egg is Ener-g egg replacer. This is the first time I have made him pizza crusts and I will continue to do so from now on. No more store bought crusts for him.  This recipe is soooo much better.  I think any wheat eating person will eat it!

Great pizza crust recipe.  One of the better ones I have tried.  I also used white rice flour instead of the bean flour. A lot of people do like bean flour. However, I don't care for the beany taste in my food inless I'm eating Indian food.  Anywhoo- for the people who are going to try this remember the dough is more like a batter so spread it.  Do not add more gf flour it will weigh more like a brick and chew like one too=) If you are having problems spreading it use a little water on your spatula or fingers that should help.

Great! Kids loved it! We loved it! I was skeptical when I saw the texture before baking, but persisted as I remembered the comments from this blog. SO glad I did! We'll probably make pizza weekly now, at the behest of a very happy gluten-intolerant 4 year-old :-)

I recently tried this recipe; it had a wonderful outcome. I eat gluten free and I am close to someone with a mild form of autism, which also requires a gluten free diet. Both of us enjoyed this very much. There were a few tweaks here and there, but mostly for preferred taste.

This crust was really, really good!  I hate reviewing when I modify a recipe, but this one is really good, and I think the original recipe is perfect for the methodology!  I had to modify it, because I had rice flour and not all purpose gluten free flour, and I had gluten free Bisquick mix on hand.  I used the Bisquick in place of the all purpose flour, omitted the xanthan, baking soda, and sugar (the mix has it already), and added an extra 1/8 cup each rice flour and tapioca flour to make up for the missing flour.  The general recipe and the method are what is important here.  This turned out just delicious; it can be as thick or thin as you like to spread it (I like it thick)!  My husband was raving and ate 4 pieces before I told him it was gluten free.  Remember to spread the batter carefully, and bake it almost completely before adding toppings and baking again!

Nice recipe.  I am a  little bit intimidated by GF recipes as they often have a lot of ingredients that I do not keep on hand and seem complicated to make.  This was really pretty easy and turned out really good.  I followed the suggestion to use rice flour because it was what I had on hand and it worked well.  My husband has recently given up gluten and he loves pizza.  We made an extra recipe and froze some of the smaller crusts as well.  Another good way to help him stay healthy and not feel like he is missing out too much!  Thanks.

When the dough is done, it is a goopy consistency-not like dough at all.  In order to make it like dough (so you can make it into a ball and roll it) I had to add a TON of extra gluten-free all purpose flour.  Then I baked it and it is completely flat and heavy. It did not rise at all.  I'm guessing the ingredients are mis-proportioned, but I'm not a good enough cook to play around with the recipe to figure out how.

Because it states "leaving the edge slightly thicker than the center", I assumed that it should be thicker than the drizzly form that resulted from following the recipe.  In order to get it to the point that it could be thicker on the edge, I had to add a lot of GF all purpose flour.  Even then, it was very difficult to pile it up on the edge.  The flavor was great, but the consistency was not.  I hadn't read the other comments before making it.  Now, I shall simply follow the recipe and forget about the edge.

I've just recently had to go gluten free.  I've heard of people having a hard time in the beginning, so I wanted to find some really great recipes that I would be successful with. I read other people's reviews about the consistency, and so I was not thrown by that.  This was my first attempt at making something gluten free, and it was absolutely AMAZING!!  I would not have known that it was gluten free had a not made it myself.  I loved the flavor, and to me, it had the consistency of focaccia.  I followed the recipe exactly with no substitutions and am so pleased.  Thanks for sharing such a wonderful recipe.  This will now be my go-to recipe for pizza dough.

Fantastic!! As my husband and I are trying healthier recipes, we were a little sceptical about trying this... it was fantastic!! We don't put the cheese in only because I'm not a fan, and it's still amazing. This is a keeper!!

I have two celiac in the family craving for a decent pizza forever! I was always intimidated by the idea of making pizza from scratch. This was easy and turned out really well! Kids loved the taste ( so did I). I didn't have rice flour. Skipped it and used 1 cup all purpose GF flour. The texture was a "deep pan" type of pizza. Spread a really layer if you prefer a crunchy pizza. Lessons learned: I used wax paper. It stuck and removing it after the topping was on.... Not pretty. Suggestion: bake 10 min on wax paper, remove, add topping and finish on cookie sheet or directly on rack. Ready to freeze after the 10 min baking. I think it will be perfect as a quick crust for next time. Thank you!!!

Yessssssssss. Perfect. NOT going to look like real pizza dough, but it crisps and sets up well in the oven. I do 12 minutes par-bake and 12 with toppings and it comes out great! One time I made breadsticks, so it's pretty versatile.

Very good pizza! Super easy. After we finished eating my husband admitted he had been very worried about GF pizza, but said he would have never known if I hadn't told him. We both enjoyed very much! Will certainly make it again. Thank you!

I added more flour to make a dough that I let rise then punched down and pressed onto a parchment paper lined pan.   This pizza crust dough recipe was very tasty and yielded a crispy crust. I would definitely make it again.

This recipe works perfectly for gluten free pizza dough.  As mentioned by other reviewers, this is a gooey dough, rather than the expected wheat pizza dough.  My family hates bean flour, so I substituted white rice flour for the bean flour.  I also reduced the sugar, only adding it to the yeast.  We've made this twice in two weeks and my husband has decided that he likes this recipe more than the many gluten free frozen pizzas that we've tried in the past.

I really liked the texture.  I used white rice flour instead of the bean flour.  I'm not sure if the flavor is my favorite, but the texture was really good. I'll play around with the recipe some more.

This is the best gluten free crust I have ever had.  In fact it is one of the best homage regular crusts I have made also.I wouldn't change a thing about the recipe.

I was looking for a wheat free pizza recipe but cannot tolerate garbanzo bean flour.  I used a wheat free blend (mixture of sorghum, tapioca and arrowroot) and then followed the rest of the recipe as is (sans garlic) due to intolerance.  Only thing I needed to change was to add and extra 1/4 cup (used 1 1/4 cup total of the flour mixture).  Really good flavor and love having an option for pizza crust that I can eat.
