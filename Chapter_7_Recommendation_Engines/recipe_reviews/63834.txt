This is different from anything I've ever tried before so it took a bit of "getting used to." That being said, this is a wonderful, quick, light dessert and would be perfect on a hot summer day. I didn't have any fruit cocktail to serve with it as the recipe stated, but I did substitute a bit of thinned out raspberry jam, which was wonderful with the prominent almond flavor. All in all, great little dessert and very please with the results.

I like it.  It's a flexible dish that can be dressed up lots of different ways.  I'm also a fan of almond flavoring, and I like that it's not too heavy.

Simple recipe.  Can be served at the most elegant of gatherings.  Skip the fruit coctail.  Use fresh diced fruit such as pear papaya and mango.  This recipe is far superior to the "Almond Jelly" recipe on this website.

I love this. :) Add as less gelatin as possible for a wonderful panna cotta.

Very easy to make, and very tasty. Paired it with some cherry preserves instead of the fruit cocktail.

Very light taste - did the raspberry sauce with some fresh berries - used small flower molds.  Very good almond flavor!

My absolute favorite and I usually double the recipe. I can use up fruit I have laying around, I love using berries and mixing up the fruit. I use some Splenda to bring down the amount of sugar.

Love this recipe! I've made it 3 times in the last 2 weeks or so...a great way to use up the milk you can't seem to finish! ;)

I like this recipe more than the others on this website. It's easy to make, easy to clean up after, and the proportions are just right. The gelatine holds its shape but is not stiff.

I made this for dessert tonight for a large group and it went over quite well. It was a nice, light Spring dessert with unique flavour and texture. I served it with canned mandarin oranges and the orange-almond flavours paired well together. I've never worked with gelatin before so I followed this recipes instructions, which ended up being a mistake. I used Knox gelatin packets and the instructions on the packets MUST be followed before proceeding with this recipe's instructions (or else the gelatin will form into a hard lump when you pour it onto the boiling water, instead of dissolving like it's supposed to). Rookie mistake, I'm sure. After I worked through that kink, this recipe went off without a hitch.

Not too sweet. I used half unsweetened vanilla almond milk and 2% milk. Cut down sugar to 2 or 3 tablespoons . 9 inch pan is too large for this amount. I used a 3 cup shallow Pyrex rectangular dish with a lid. Traditional Chinese dessert, served with canned lychee nuts!
