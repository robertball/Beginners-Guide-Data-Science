This was excellent and so simple. I also did not find this to be too moist. I just added more bread crumbs until I knew it would not be too moist. I also used ketchup instead of soup because I didn't have any soup. However, next time I'll try the soup.

This meatloaf was great. We did not find it too moist at all.  I used ketchup on top instead of soup!

I picked this recipe because it looked simple to make and it got 4.5 stars.  But it was such a disappointment.  Then I went back to read several reviews and noticed that most people modified the recipes in some way.  What are you rating this recipe when you did not use it as written?  So annoying.  But here is my review.  The loaf turned out very moist but this was b/c there is way too much liquid (it was like meat loaf stew) and the flavor was bland.  I should have notice that there is no salt or seasoning in the recipe but I thought 4.5 stars can't be wrong!  I would omit the milk, season the turkey and change to tomato sauce to kick up the flavor.

I am trying this recipe right now, but I used StoveTop stuffing mix, instead of breadcrumbs, omitted the milk, but added an egg. I also topped it with ketchup rather than tomato soup, as I didn't have any.

This dish pleased my husband along with my children (5, 3 and 1 1/2).  They all asked for seconds.  I used 1/2 tsp dried basil instead of fresh which I didn't have.  I also substituted the tomato soup for a can of turkey gravy. It was delicious with egg noodles & veggies.  It was so easy.  Definitley a keeper. Thanks!

Surprisingly a great meal! I did add a little more bread crumbs and omitted the milk because the mixture felt very moist. Even my son liked this turkey loaf! Very Impressive!

This was super tasty! I left out the milk and added more Italian bread crumbs. I also added a teaspoon of red pepper flakes and tablespoon of Italian seasoning to the mixture. The Tomato soup topped it off nicely. It turned out perfect! I will make this again!

I followed the recipe mostly, only I didn't top the loaf with tomato. I used 6oz of canned yams, mixed them with the turkey.  Didn't use milk either.

this was a very good turkey meatloaf! Since I have intolerances to gluten, dairy, eggs, and wheat I did change it up some. I put some regular oatmeal (not quick oats) in my food processor and used that instead of bread crumbs, I omitted the milk completely, and I added 1 tbsp flax meal soaked in 3 tbsp hot water as egg substitute. I also omitted the parmesan cheese. I added some rosemary and thyme to the herb mix and sued ketchup on top. All in all this meatloaf was loaded with flavor, I especially loved the celery and onion in it, rough chopped for textureâ€¦my family loved it!

This is a nice base recipe. I did tweak it doing the following: I used all dry spices instead of fresh spices, used 1 cup of bread crumbs, omitted the milk and mixed in ketchup instead of putting the ketchup on top. I also made these into small serving sizes and froze uncooked. When I got around to cooking one of them, the meatloaf was very tender and tasty. I'm definitely happy with the results and will be making it again!!

This was fairly easy to make, but the onion was a bit too much. We were able to continue eating leftovers for a day, but I wont be fixing this again.

If it hadn't been for all the celery I'd have given this recipe more stars. After adding only one stalk, we found it had too much celery, which seemed to make the turkey loaf taste bitter. Otherwise this turned out somewhat well.

This is a GREAT recipe. I reduced the milk as a few others did and it was perfect (not too moist). I also added a splash of Worchestershire. Topped with ketchup instead of the soup as I didn't have any on hand! This was a winner with my husband!

My husband has Celiacs Disease and I prepared this meal for him gluten free style! I followed the recipe but used crushed Glutino crackers in place of bread crumbs. This was very flavorful and we even had seconds! My husband loved and and best of all he didn't get sick :)

I have made this meatloaf several times and each time for a different group.  I love the way it comes out and so do they :).     My variation of this recipe is instead of using tomato soup I used Napa Valley's creamy marinara pasta sauce mixed with a can of tomato paste and 1/2 a can of stewed tomatoes.  It comes out extremely tasty.  Try it out :)

This was very good. I used 2lbs of ground turkey and omitted the milk. I also added a tad bit more bread crumbs and used ketchup instead of the soup. It came out great! even my picky husband enjoyed this healthy alternative to meatloaf. I will def make again.

So good, I used half the amount of parm cheese, omitted the milk, and used 3/4 c bread crumbs. Perfect! The fresh basil gives it an excellent flavor, but you could use dry if that's all you have. I did not use the tomato soup. I baked for 40 minutes, then topped with my fav sauce combo (2 parts BBQ sauce, 2 parts ketchup, 1 part mustard) and baked again for 5 min. YUM!

This meatloaf was too moist. Next time I would take the other reviewer advice and omit the milk and instead of an entire can of tomato soup, just use a little ketchup on top!

Made this for dinner last night and it was simple and delicious. Very moist and flavorful. I didn't have any tomato soup, so I used half a small can of V8 and it came out great.

Made it tonight. Needed lots of extra seasoning to get it a bit more flavorful. I seasoned the turkey and added some basil and garlic salt. I think the 9x13 pan suggestion is a mistake, as the soup was boiling when it was removed from the oven. Should have gone with my gut and used the meatloaf pan. Duh!

I really liked this! It went over very well with my roomie who I made dinner for. I made some small changes - I omitted the milk & celery as I didn't have any, but I did add a little bit of BBQ sauce to the mixture. Then I poured the soup overtop. I cooked it for 45 mins covered then about another 14 uncovered. It sits in a lot of liquid but the meatloaf itself wasn't too moist or loose it was nice and tight and there was lots of yummy sauce to pour over it! I'll definitely make this again, it was easy to make, standard ingredients I almost always have on hand, and it's moderately healthy! Thanks Melissa, this rocks!

I added apple slices on top and mixed ketchup with a little bit of brown sugar.  It came out fantastic!  Also added a bit of fresh rosemary to the meat to match with the apples.  Yum!  Next time I will add a bit more bread crumbs like the other reviews note, and pre-cook the minced onions.  Thanks for a great, healthy recipe.

This was very good, but I made changes the second time around.  I omitted the celery (which I hate), but added grated carrot & zucchini (about 1/4 c. each). Omitted the basil & used poultry seasoning instead. Used ketchup instead of the tomato soup, which I felt made the meatloaf too moist. These changes may not suit everyone, but friends & family loved it, even those that thought the turkey might be too dry.

I loved this! Of course, I had to make a few changes based on what was in my pantry. I added one finely grated carrot, used dry Italian herbs, garlic powder instead of fresh, grated onion instead of minced, plain panko crumbs, a little mayo (out of eggs) instead of eggs, and ketchup instead of soup. 
But it's still the same basic idea and it had a great flavor! Served with baked potato and green beans.
Great recipe! We will have this again.

I used tomato ketsup & added some liquid smoke, & worcestershire sauce instead of the tomato soup. Also there was no seasoning mentioned, in the recipe, so I used kosher salt (coarse) & freshly ground pepper. But really a very good recipe.

I didn't add celery b/c I didn't have any.  I used 1/2 t of dry basil b/c I didn't have fresh.  I also put ketchup on top instead of the soup.  Turned out great!  Next time I may try using dry onion soup instead of onion only b/c my husband doesn't care for them.  I will be making this again!

Yum yum yum. This recipe was super easy. I substituted green peppers for the celery and used tomato sauce and ketchup instead of the soup. I also used condensed milk instead of regular milk which was fine.

This meatloaf is moist and delicious.  The only change I made was that I used only one stalk of celery.  The soup on top created a nice sauce for the meatloaf.

This is a great turkey meatloaf.  I made it last week and again this week...and I usually don't repeat recipes that quick.  My family loved it.  I did substitute ketchup for the tomato soup on top.

We had this meatloaf last night.  It was delicious.  We made it as written except the ground turkey we used was the 98% fat free all white breast meat.  The soup did give a nice sauce to the meat.  I will add just a 1/4 can of water to the soup when we wish to eat it with mashed potatoes, so it is easier to ladle.  This recipe would make nice individual loaves or muffin tin loaves.  Thank you for this tasty recommendation.

Gotta tell ya, this was awesome!  I couldn't find our thermometer so i cut it open and it was VERY moist so i put the broiler on for about 10 min at the end.  I also had removed the foil after about 20 min.  The entire family loved it, including the very picky 5 year old who even ate the onions.

I followed this recipe fairly closely and I found it to be ok at best.  I did read through prior reviews and took some advice.  First and foremost, too much garlic! I might use a garlic press in the future and cut back to 2 small cloves or 1 big clove. Time was a factor and I didn't not saute the celery and onions and that was a big mistake unless you like a crunch to your meatloaf.  I did reduce celery to one stalk and it was still a lot.  I used ketchup instead of soup which was fine. I threw in splash of milk for moisture, though not the 1/4 cup. I added 30 minutes to the cook time based on a meat thermometer reading and the consistency of the meat was perfect.  I think it's a good base recipe worth tinkering with.

I made the recipe as indicated and it was quite good. Later I varied it: instead of tomato soup, I used cream of celery, and added some sage, rosemary, thyme, and a bit of high-quality chicken bouillon, and I think it was even better: moreover, it actually tasted like turkey-- which is nice for a change (instead of trying to get the turkey to taste like beef). I suppose cream of chicken would do well also, as well as using ground chicken in addition to, or in place of, the turkey.

So quick and delicious!  I didn't have soup and so used spaghetti sauce instead.  I had only 1.2 lbs of turkey and used a 9x9" pan instead of 9x15". I put some shredded mozzarella on top towards the end of the cooking.

My whole family absolutely loved this recipe and requested the following week which when I read it I realized I made a huge mistake....I poured the soup into the mix instead of on top of the loaf.....when I was making it I thought it was way too moist so I added another 1/2 cup of bread crumbs and broiled it for 5 min @ end to crisp it....I have to say it was amazing....I would recommend my error!!  Thanks for a great combo of ingredients!!!!

No one in my family enjoyed this.  We all thought it was "too turkey flavored" I've made turkey meatloaf before and the spices/seasonings were so well done that it didn't have the non-beef flavor at all.  Guess this was not the recipe I made in the past. Will keep searching, but will not make this one again.  half the loaf is still in the fridge and hating to waste food, I am trying to decide how to disguise it...maybe crumbled in a taco soup or chopped up in a spaghetti dish.  Not sure what we are missing here, as everyone else has rated it higher.

I cut the recipe down to 4 servings because I only had a pound of turkey, added another egg and dropped the milk, and crushed and added 6 buttery crackers plus a little poultry seasoning. DELISH!!!
* I also didn't have the soup so I mixed ketchup with some brown sugar.

I'm with love2eat on this one. While my family liked it I thought it was bland. I even added an extra clove of garlic and Lawry's seasoning. I omitted using milk. Also, by the way, who ever heard of making any meatloaf in a 9 x 13 pan????? I used a 9 x 3 loaf pan and added 15 minutes to the baking time because otherwise it did not cook right. I also checked in my Pillsbury cookbook how long to cook a meatloaf to be sure, which says 60-70 minutes! The soup didn't even really cook much (the hubby thought I had made cabbage rolls when he looked at it). I took off the aluminum foil at the 40 minute mark as well which helped. May make it again but it needs some kick to it for my taste.

This was very good.  Changes: I didn't use milk; sauteed the vegetables and seasoned them with some all purpose seasoning; and used ketchup on top.  This is one I'll make again for sure.

This was one of the best turkey meatloaf recipes I've come across. Flavor was right on. I did change a couple things in the recipe though. I added an extra clove of garlic and salt and pepper. I didn't use the milk as the mixture seemed wet enough without it. Will definately be using this one again.

Really enjoyed. I had no Italian breadcrumbs so I used panko breadcrumbs. I added Italian seasoning and a little salt. Once it is cooked the tomato soup took on some of the flavours of the meatloaf. Will definitely make again.

Yes, I will make it again.. It is delicious. I didn't put celery in, only because I didn't have any on hand.

Made with substitutions...Added 1 chopped red bell pepper, no onion, ised two tablesppons minced garlic (instead of 3 garlic cloves), no milk and one small can tomato paste smeared on instead of canned soup (too much sugar!). Served with ketchup on the side. It was moist enough without the milk...also, it is important that it be covered tightly while cooking, otherwise it doesn't cook as quickly because it is not in a loaf pan. Turned out delicious! I can hardly tell it is turkey.
