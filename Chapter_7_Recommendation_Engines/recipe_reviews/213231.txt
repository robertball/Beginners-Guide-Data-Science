I made this for all to bring for lunch as it will keep and not go bad.  I did not add the Bacon because the flavor would be bad mixed with the other spices.  To keep give it a real protein boost I added garden vegge type of tempeh.  That gave the dish the extra punch it needed without the fatty bacon.

I made this exactly like the recipe (except I always add cumin), and the results were light and textural and very complex flavors.

Loved it! Light and refreshing with wonderful curry flavor! Little less vinegar to my taste. Stevia instead of sugar makes this a more healthy option!

this was very good and simple to make. I used some fresh asparagus instead of the cucumber, because that is what I had in the frig. It was good at room temp. and would be good chilled. Very colorful! A little bacon adds a whole lot of flavor, so please don't omit the bacon.

Could use more curry powder and think I will add cumin next time. Added jalapeno and cilantro which added a nice flavor.

I didn't have cuckes or chickpeas so omitted them, but added tomatoes and green pepper. Otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Would be delicious warm or cold, as a main dish or side dish. Definitely don't skip the bacon and caramelized onion step though, that takes it from a 4 star to a 5 star dish!!! Oh, I also added a few artichoke hearts because I had some that needed to be used up. Super dish!!! :-)

Doubled recipe, added a cup of quinoa (pre-cooking) and two avocados. Very tasty. I actually liked it better before adding the bacon. I'm sure it will go over well at the Mother's Day gathering tomorrow, and if not, delicious lunches for me next week--win-win!

I liked it - I used Israeli couscous and I cut out some of the ingredients I didn't have on hand like the cucumber and the beans, so it was mainly the couscous, onion, carrots, and bacon, but it was delicious.  Really good idea.

This was good! I didn't have any cucumber, so I shredded some zucchini in there and also shredded the carrot instead of using diced. I only used 1 tsp. of curry powder and that was plenty for us. The flavors were good, and I think this would also be nice w/ some grilled chicken or shrimp added. Thanks for sharing. :)
