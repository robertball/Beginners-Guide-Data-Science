Originally my daughter and I weren't incredibly impressed with this recipe but I have to say sitting in Tupperware on the counter for a day has completely changed my opinion.  Maybe it gave the flavors a chance to do their thing or something, but they're fabulous!  I do think that it would be nice to add some chopped pecans but other than that I'd leave this one alone!
