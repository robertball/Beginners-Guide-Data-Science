This is a wonderful dip that can be served in bread or ina small crock pot if you can't find round bread.  I've made this dip for years with a few minor changes and someone always wants the recipe. I omit the jalapenos and use a small or large can of diced green chilies.  I substitute 5 slices of pastrami, diced in place of ham to give it more flavor.  Another great addition is a can or jar of chopped artichoke hearts, either marinated or regular.  Make sure you use a few good Worcestershire shakes as it makes the dip.

and this version took less than 40 minutes Start to Finish!  Success when in a Bind!

Tried it and it was wiped out!  But was in a huge hurry, so... I mixed all the ingredients in the mixer, placed it in a huge microwave casserole bowl (glass) and heated it for about 7:00 minutes-paused half time to stir.
(I used Hormel canned smoked ham also)
Cut the French bread in bite size pieces for appetizers, spooned the Mississippi Sin on the sliced bread.
Put it in the hot oven (400 degrees for about 5 to 7 minutes-watching not to burn)
Then turned it up on broil to brown the top and edges of French bread a little.
It was eaten quickly at our neighborhood Christmas party! and because it was not baked in the bread, the mixture went a lot further than I thought.  I still have enough mixture to make at least 3 more makings of bite size appetizers.  

It does need more color, so if I do this again for a party I may top/sprinkle with chopped black olives or parsley.  Start to finish time less than 35 minutes! and we all would still give it 5 stars for taste!

So delicious- definitely a keeper! I used the full 8 oz of cream cheese and added some minced garlic to the mix as well. Everyone loved it!
