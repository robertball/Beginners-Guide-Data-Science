This recipe deserves all 5 stars for its simplicity and tastiness. When I make this, I mix all the ingredients in the crockpot (saving myself from cleaning an unnecessary dish), cover, and let it cook for hours. I agree with the other reviewers that said it did not need to cook for that long, so test it after a few hours. Also, this recipe calls for only 2 packages of spinach, which makes the dish too runny - it ends up more like a dip. I added an additional package of spinach, for a total of 3, and it turned out perfect. You can use any cheese you would like, as well. I used white cheddar and it was delicious. This recipe has been around for decades (my great aunt used to make this in the 70's), so it's definitely a keeper. Just tweek it to your likeness, and you'll have this staple creamed spinach recipe for years.

WOW!What an awesome recipe. I broke my crockpot while I was preparing this, but I decided to make it anyway. I baked it for one hour at 350, covered then for another ten mins or so, uncovered and it browned up nicely. It almost tastes like broccoli and cheese rice. If you serve it "piping" (very) hot you dont taste the wonderful flavors as well---just so that everyone knows how good this is, Thank you so much for the wonderful vegetable recipe!!!youre the best!--Lady M----

This was really good spinach.  The only thing I did differently than the recipe said, was I just mixed everything together inside the crock pot instead of mixing it in a bowl and dumping it in.  Saved me a dish!  I also lined my slow cooker with one of those slow cooker bags, so I had no mess.  This was delicious and simple.  Next time I may tweak the spices just for fun, to see what happens.  I used light cottage cheese and american cheese, and next time I may use egg whites just to keep this dish low fat and not cancel out the health benefits of spinach.  I served this it a birthday dinner with lots of family.  Most of the kids wouldnt' try it because it had spinach in it, but a couple did and they were surprised that they liked it.

This is really good. i pureed the mixture after cooking in the crock pot for about an hour, then returned it to the crock pot. it tasted even better. my husband likes it too and isnt a big spinach fan. my 4 yr old wasnt crazy about it but anything green and squishy is going to be hard to feed him even if its good. i think other kids who dont have this issue would like it.

This is a wonderful recipe...I just made it and can't wait for dinner time to come so I can eat it!  I agree with others who say you don't need to cook it that long.  Maybe only an hour and a half or so - that's what I did and it tastes great!!

This was very good, but does not require 5 hours in a slow cooker.  It is easily done sooner.  My husband made this for a special evening dinner and accidently used cheddar instead of American and it was still very good.  It will be a keeper.

Awesome!  Changed nothing except the time it took to cook.   Two hours total: one on high and one on low.

I love spinach, but found this too rich, too salty... like a little spinach with my cheese. I scaled it back to 4 servings but found it didn't have a nice taste. Agree with the other reviewer, it didn't need 5 hours in the crock pot - but I probably will not make this again.

This worked out so good for me. I brought this dish to church for a pot luck because the Pastor made a comment how he loved creamed spinach. He raved about it and wanted the rest that was left to go to him to take home.

One of my friends makes this dish, my husband & I love it!  I was stuck in the hospital for 2 weeks before the birth of my daughter.  I was really wanting this dish, so my friend made it & plugged the crock pot in my hospital room.  It smelled so good all the nurses came in to ask what I was having!!

Pretty tasty. I added some garlic and substituted cheddar cheese.  Also added an extra package of spinach. Really good.

I am indifferent on this recipe.  My husband liked it, which is a huge plus. On the other end, the smell while cooking, and i am blaming the "processed cheese", ugh, next time i will definitely use something else,altho i am not sure what. any suggestions would be helpful.  I also agree that the cooking time at most , is 3-4 hours, it starting burning and curdling after that. I also forgot salt, and i am VERY glad i did, cuz it didnt need it.  i also forgot the flour, maybe thats why mine was curdling? Anywho the taste was very good and tasted like many delicious traditional resturaunt cream spiniches i have tried.  Was also very easy to make!

My Mom loved this recipe.  I wasn't a huge fan but it wasn't bad either.  It made a large quantity and probably was exactly what I expected.

I've been craving this for a while, and decided to give it a try for a Thanksgiving side.   I lightened it a bit with fat free cottage cheese, but probably cancelled that out when I realized I forgot the flour and sprinkled about a quarter cup of parmesan cheese instead!!  So rich and creamy!! Also cut back on time in slow cooker; it was done in 4hrs or less.  Will make again soon, either for a side or a yummy dip!  Thanks...

As one reviewer recommended, I used three packages of spinach instead of two.  I also used white cheddar instead of american.  This recipe was delicious, a definite keeper!

Served this at a "Thanksgiving sampler" at my house (everyone brought a dish they wanted to try out before T'giving) and this was a huge hit!! (and who doesn't need to free up oven space on T'giving?) I used a brick of sharp white cheddar and a generous sprinkle of parm/romano from the can and held my breath that it would be OK - I am delighted with the result. Only pitfall is the "squeezing dry" of the spinach (I used 2 - 16 oz bags)- it is HARD getting all that liquid out of that much spinach!!

This was even better the second day, warmed up and eaten with tortilla chips.  The second batch I made, I put half the american cheese recommended and half cream cheese.  Great recipe.

I really did not like this dish. It was really mushy and sick. I didn't even serve the dish. I also agree this the others that it didn't take that long in the crock pot. Mine only took about 3 hours. Sorry!

No party leftovers here. Some had reviewed that it was salty, so I held the salt and used unsalted butter.  Also, I used shredded cheddar instead of American.  Cooked one hour on high and one on low.  This is a keeper.

I was cleaning out the freezer and realized I had somehow accumulated more spinach than Popeye the Sailor! Found this recipe and made it just as a snack to have around for snacking but it didn't last long.  The entire family down to my youngest kept picking at it until it was gone.  Followed the recipe exactly without modifications.

I made this at Thanks giving and everyone really enjoyed it. It was good but i felt like it was missing something. I added alot of extra cheddar cheese and salt. I think i didn't dry out the spinach well enough.

I loved this! I also made some changes: I replaced the American Cheese with feta cheese, cream cheese, yogurt and parmesan cheese (what I had in the house). I also cooked in on high for about 1.5 hours and low for about 1.5 hours and it came out really good. As another reviewer suggested, I used a hand blender to blend it all up after the initial hour.

I prefer a much creamier texture. This turned out fairly dry. The taste is there, just not creamy enough for me.

It's a 3 star when newly made, but the refrigerated, re-heated leftovers blossom overnight into a 4 star. I had made this with the upgrade to sharp Cheddar.

This was great. I used sharp cheddar cubes and low fat cottage cheese. My friends loved it.

Perhaps spinach isn't my thing. Didn't care for this one and neither did 5 out of the 7 people I prepared it for. Giving it 2 stars simply for the fact that using a crockpot makes anything easier to make.

After reading the reviews, I decided to cut this recipe in half (my family is 2 adults, and 2 small children) but I used the full amount of spinach since a lot of people said it was too rich. 

I started out using half of everything, cooked it on high for 45 minutes, tasted it... then decided to go ahead and add the other package of spinach because YES it was VERY cheesy! So I added that, stirred, and cooked on high the remaining 15 minutes. Then I pureed everything in my Ninja blender, and put it back into the crock pot on low. It was done after 2hrs on low, and starting to stick to the sides in spots. Unfortunately, I had to switch it to "warm" setting because my husband is still an hour away from being home. 

It's really thick and cheesy, despite using double the spinach. My 10yr old just sampled it and said it's too cheesy, and she felt like she just took a big bite of American cheese. I just added some evaporated milk, hoping that will buy us some time until dinner is served. I think this recipe might be better as a dip, but I can already tell I will probably make it again. Just maybe needs some adjustments, especially on the timing. And perhaps American cheese is just too rich...

Delicious!!  Very easy in the crockpot.  But I only had fresh spinach which I wilted down to the required amount, and only had grated Mexican cheese, so subbed that for the American.  The taste was great, but the appearance was somewhat distorted by the cottage cheese (small curd);  it doesn't melt.  But it was truly a wonderful dish as long as you close your eyes when you eat it!!!!!!!!)

Taste wise it was great. I do like the idea of processing and putting it back into the crock. It is a little lumpy otherwise

Brought this to Christmas Eve dinner. Wish I had remembered to not cook it for as long as the recipe said however we all liked the browned "side crust".  Used 3 boxes of spinach. Used an entire pack of individually wrapped white American cheese. My mother-in-law asked me for the recipe! Was a big hit with even "non-adventurous" eaters. Next time I make it I'll try it with less butter (but maybe that's just the post-feast me talking).

I had first tried this recipe years ago when I had seen it on a PBS fundraiser.  I've since lost the recipe so I thought I'd try my luck on Allrecipes.  Since this was it, I decided to make it for Christmas brunch.  Like other reviewers, I also cut down on the cooking time.  I did the one hour on high but I only did one and a half hours on low.  Came out perfectly! For those who think it's too rich, I think when I had seen it on that program I got the impression that it was supposed to be a dip.  It would be great for that but you have to make sure your spinach is really finely chopped.  Thank you so much for the recipe.  Now I won't have to wait so long until the next time I make it.

My husband nor I didn't care for this as a side dish, however, I reheated this and served this to some guests as a dip with some Tostitos chips and they gobbled it up and asked for the recipe.  I wasn't very impressed with it.
