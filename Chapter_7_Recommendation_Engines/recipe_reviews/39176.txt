This is by far the most popular recipe I've served to family and friends.... and so versatile!  I use diced ham instead of bacon when pressed for time, and ground sausage with some sage makes it really hearty.  I also throw in veggies whenever I'm in the mood - spinach and mushrooms are great.  I've also substituted 1/2 cup Cheddar for some of the Swiss - it adds color and a little "bite" to the flavor (be sure you keep at least 1 cup of the Swiss, I've discovered that reducing below that alters the texture too much).  Basically, you can suit whatever 'food mood' you encounter with this amazing recipe!!

I've made this quiche several times, but I use cubed ham instead of bacon.  I also use green onions.  It turns out perfect every time.  It also freezes well.

I liked this recipe although it came out a bit greasy tasting due to the bacon.  I chopped mine up before putting it in the pie and used some low fat monterrery jack cheese mixed with swiss and a dash of red pepper.  Next time I will use all low fat cheese and skim evap. milk to make it more light tasting.

A favorite in our home!  We like using sauteed diced deli ham, chopped onions and frozen spinach in ours.  Add a little nutmeg, pepper and cinnamon to spice it up.

I made this for my 3 picky children and one picky husband.  Thay all loved it!  I used skinless breakfast sausage I cooked and chopped up instead of bacon and I added some diced green chiles.  I also used cheddar instead of swiss cheese.  It's a great basic recipe that can probably be altered many different ways.

This is a quick, delicious recipe that can be adjusted for different ingredients. I swap the swiss and bacon for mozzarella and ham with roma tomatoes. Everyone loves when I bring this quiche!

Outstanding!  Even my husband, who turned up his nose when I told him what we were having, ate 2 big pieces!  I also lowered the fat by using turkey bacon, evaporated skim milk, and egg beaters.  I also only used 1 1/4 cup of swiss cheese since it was all I had.  I added 2 chopped plum tomates that made it just delicious!

Very good and easy.  I cut the bacon before I cooked it, easier than crumbling the bacon after it is cooked.

This was awesome! I did add sauteed mushrooms but, everything else I followed to the letter. This quiche was sooooooo good. Next time, I'll make two of them. Who'da thought the evaporated milk could replace heavy cream?... Not me! This was delicious!     Thanks!   Erin

I did exactly as the directions said except that I added some chopped fresh spinach. The egg texture reminded me of scrambled eggs, not quiche. The taste was okay, but I'll leave out the nutmeg next time because I didn't care for it. It took a lot longer to bake than the directions said, as well.

I was disappointed with this.  The texture was just off.  The only change I made was subbing ham for bacon.  I cooked it for more than 45 minutes and it still didn't seem "done" to me.  By that I mean that the eggs were cooked but the texture was not firm enough for our liking. The flavor was wonderful though.  I probably won't be making this again but if I did I think I would add more eggs to give it a firmer texture.

I made this and it turned out great. I would recommend not putting the cheese at the bottom and add the cheese to the egg mixture instead. My crust should have been a little crispier but because of all the melted cheese at the bottom it didn't. Over all good. :)

This was my first time making a quiche EVER. I have to say that it's not difficult at all. I used the Butter Flaky Pie Crust from this site, turkey bacon, fat free evaporated milk, four cloves fresh minced garlic and I cut the cheese down to half. My husband hearing "Oh, we're having quiche for breakfast" was less than pleased but I'll tell you, he ate three pieces. And my kids? All they had to hear was egg pie and they were down. This was a good base recipe, next time I'd like to add more vegetables, like spinach, mushrooms and peppers. I had one bite and thought it was good but yeah, it needs vegetables. I think this would be good with turkey ham, too.

Family loved it - and they don't like quiche.  I used mild sausage and about 1/2 C more shredded cheese.  Great with fruit salad for dinner on hot summer nites.

Wow! Soo easy for a beginner cook like me. Followed directions to the letter. Had to adjust cooking time for my oven but got RAVE reviews from family at our Mother's day brunch! Will make again.

Very good; a hit for a luncheon.  All good cooks loved it.  I did have to bake it about 15-20 minutes longer.

Delicious!  I was forced to make an adjustment when I realized that I only had 5 oz. of evaporated milk...so I used 5 oz of evap milk, and 10 oz of low fat milk.  Other than that, I made the quiche as written...it was delicious!  I tried another quiche recipe from a "well known" big red cook book, and I was disappointed with how thick and dry it turned out.  After following this recipe, I realized I was using too much egg and not enough liquid....what a difference in texture and flavor!!  And what a great starting recipe...the possibilities are endless as to what you could add to make different kinds of quiches!!  Thank you!!

This was so easy to make! I followed the recipe and made only one small change. I didn't have any bacon, so I substituted chopped honey ham for the bacon. The quiche came out fantastic.

My first quiche ever! Husband and I both loved it...will definitely make again and try variations. The swiss cheese flavor was too strong for my kid, she wouldn't eat more than one bite...so in our house it's an adult dish.

My first attempt at making quiche is a success! I substituted 6oz of canadian bacon for regular bacon. I diced the canadian bacon and sauteed it in a T of olive oil until the edges were crisp. Removed from pan, then added the onion (I used red onion) and sauteed in a T butter.  I also added a few tablespoons of freshly grated parmesan cheese to the top prior to baking.  Just a quick note that I used a refrigerated pie crust that was not deep dish and and it came out just fine. (baked the crust according to the directions on the side of the box).  I will definitely make this again. Thanks!

I loved this quiche! It is ridiculously simple and is now a requested family favorite. I've tried it with lots of toppings and it works well with all, though if I cook it with ham, I won't add extra salt. If you like quiche, I definitely recommend this recipe.

Very disappointing! Let this cook longer by 5 mins. at a time as there seemed to be too much liquid ozzing from the top...didn't like the taste either...family gave this thumbs down

Loved this and used broccoli and ham in a Pillsbury rolled out crust. Used one extra egg. Can't wait to try other combinations!

Wow, I was pleasantly surprised! I had some cans of evap. milk that had been here awhile and needed to be used. I whipped this up this morning, so easy and so good! I only had a shallow pie crust so I used two 5 oz cans of evaporated milk. I used real bacon bits (enough to cover the bottom of the pan) and frozen chopped onions (didn't saute) from the freezer, omitted the nutmeg, and used "casserole" shredded cheese as this was all I had on hand. I thought.... this won't be that good but it will be warm and something to eat; but I was wrong! Thank you Carnation!

I've made this a few times now and decided I should finally write a review.  It's delicious.  For a little something different, try chopped ham instead of bacon (no cooking required) and I use swiss and cheddar cheeses, but any "hard" cheese would be great.

This was good, but I wouldn't consider it excellent. My husband and I liked it, but haven't made up my mind if I'll make it again.

Excellent.  I made this using a BIG corningware pie plate (12 inches, I think) and it fit just fine.  Turned out great, I had no problems with it not setting, etc.  I did use a bit more swiss cheese than the recipe called for, probably closer to 2 cups).  
The second time I added half a cup of cheddar and used packaged deli ham and broccoli chopped up by the food processor - hubby thought it was even better than the first one.
Bacon always tastes better to me but the ham was less time consuming.   I'll add canned mushrooms next time.  I'm enjoying making it because it's relatively easy to make and the result is so delicious.

I use one of the no-roll crust recipes from this site.

The taste was really good. I would've liked less cheese. I also had to extend the baking time to almost an hour.

I loved this!!  The only problem I encountered was the cooking time.  I had to bake it for an hour to get it done enough.  Will defintely be sending the recipe to my friends and family.

This was so simple and my whole family loved it.  Only I needed to cook mine longer than 30-35 minutes.  I tried putting it on the table then and it was soupy, so I stuck it back in the oven for at least another 15 minutes.  I'll will certainly make this again and my family is looking forward to it!!!  Which is nice!

IF I COULD I WOULD GIVE IT 10 STARS!
It was perfect & light.
For anyone who claims theirs didn't turn out, they
must have done something wrong!
It did take an hour to cook & set up but it was
SO worth it. Give it a try. You'll be glad you did.

Everyone LOVES this quiche when I make it! It was the first and only quiche receipe I've ever used. I throw broccoli in rather than bacon (we're vegetarian), and I often use cheddar cheese instead of swiss. Definitely a family favourite, and any left-overs are just as yummy the next day!

Added 1/2 cup frozen chopped spinach (defrosted and drained). After 30 min. turned heat up to 375 for another 13 min. - perfection. To reheat, microwave 2-3 minutes. Rave reviews from all.

This is scrumptious. Quiche will make a person fat real quick though, so being able to use lowfat evaporated milk (which I did) helps with that. Make sure to drain the grease before you put the onions in the bacon pan...Im sure you knew that already though.

I've never been big on Quiche but thought I'd give it a try and WOW!!! This was awesome and very easy to make. I did make a couple of changes because I didn't have onions so I used mushrooms and sauted 3 cloves of garlic in with the bacon (which I cut into pieces first and then cooked) I made it last night and my husband ate 3 peices and I just finished having a peice for breakfast - MMMM!

yum yum yum.  I make this recipe almost as directed :)  I add 1 more eggs and more bacon.  I cook the bacon fist, then cook the onion in the bacon fat.  Also I mix all the ingredients together then pour into the shell. 

I also use the bacon fat to cook my hashbrowns!

I have made this recipe pretty much every year for my husband's birthday dinner. He loves it! The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it needs to bake for at least 40-45 minutes, not the 30-35 minutes stated in the recipe.

I made this tonight to bring to our Sunday brunch at work tomorrow and it looks great! Substituted ham since someone in this house finished all the bacon! Just one note...I had to bake it aabout 15 mins more since it wasn't quite set in the time frame listed...but I am sure every oven is different. Thanks!

This was a supremely easy recipe!  I made one adjustment, however, instead of frying my bacon I microwaved it, then sauteed the onions with one piece of the already cooked bacon.  The flavor wasn't affected at all.  The only tweak I could suggest is more salt and pepper.  Overall a great recipe.

Very easy to make and my whole family loved it! I made a few changes to the recipe. In place of the bacon I used a roll of Bob Evans sausage and fried it with the onions and used 4 eggs.I also made my own pie crust.  I think next time I will make 2...1 for now and 1 for later.

Excellent basic quiche recipe!  I've made this probably a dozen times and have always received great results and great reviews.  The recipe has so many possibilities and variations, don't feel you have to follow to a tee (add sausage, green onions, cheddar, chilies, ham, veggies, etc., etc.).  Each one has tasted different due to variation in ingredients, but it turns out wonderful each time!

Yes, real men do eat quiche, especially when it's a recipe like this one!  I cooked the onion in bacon grease after removing the bacon from the skillet.  I diced the bacon for ease of chewing. I mixed a small carton of mushrooms with the onion.  Other than those slight changes, I prepared this versatile recipe exactly as indicated.  Though my oven usually cooks items quicker than the recipe calls for, this took closer to 40 minutes to get done.  I made two of these--one for today and one for tomorrow, the second of which will sit in the refrigerator until it's time to pop it in the oven.  I couldn't let that second pie crust in the two for one package go to waste, you know.

This is an excellent quiche. I added one extra egg and left out the nutmeg. Very good. I used a frozen deep dish pie crust and precooked bacon, which made it quick and easy. In response to one reviewer, sweetened condensed milk is for making candy and very sweet desserts. It is not the same thing as evaporated milk.

Delicious!  Easy!  No need to look for another recipe!  I've made this 6 times - each with a different mix - and you just can't go wrong.  Mushroom/Green Chile/Onion was yummy or for a mild spicy "kick" I dice up a slice of Jalapeno Cheese and toss it in with whatever combo - and it's great!  I have one in the oven now.....Broccoli/Mushroom/Green Onion!  My next experiment will be a Seafood Quiche!  Love quiche - gotta try it!

Tasty, but I did make a few adjustments. I almost always add about a teaspoon of dry mustard powder when using cheese. The flavor is definitly enhanced. I also sliced up very thinly a yellow pepper, that I wanted to use up,and microwave cooked it and then added it to the recipe. I am sure you can experiment with other veggies to enhance both the nutritional content and flavor. It worked for me.

Delicious and easy!  I used a cubed ham steak with sauteed mushrooms and onions in the filling, instead of bacon.  Also, borrowing from another recipe, I used 3/4 cup jarlesburg and 3/4 cup mozzerella for the cheese.  Wonderful results.  I did have a lot of left-over liquid filling, though.

Good, but I would make some changes for next time.  I didn't like the taste of evaporated milk in it, so I would use fat-free half-and-half next time (worked great in other quiches I've made).  I used turkey bacon and 1/2 cup less cheese to cut down on the fat.  In addition, I had to bake this almost 60 minutes for it to get done.  Will be making again, but just make those few adjustments.

Terrific.  I've used this base recipe for several variations too.  My favorite is frozen spinach.. thawed, feta and parmesan cheese, with oregano instead of nutmeg.

Since I didn't have any Swiss cheese on hand, I used a combination of cheddar and mozzarella, and it still turned out great!  This quiche reheats very well and makes for excellent leftovers.  Next time, though, I will cook it until a knife comes out clean in center.

This is very easy to make and very good.  The only change I made was using real bacon bits instead of frying my own bacon, and I also sauted the onions in 2 Tbsp of butter before I combined the bacon and onions.  I will definitely make this again.

Was easy and foolproof for sure. Next time I will cut the bacon up before frying and adding the onions. Had to cook longer to set the center.

Recipe was good, although I made some alterations.  I made a crustless quiche as I'm on the South Beach diet.  I also used a 8x11.5 greased pan.  Used 5 eggs instead of 3, ham instead of bacon.  Also substituted dried minced onion for fresh, but forgot to cut the amount in half due to it being dried, so it had too strong of an onion flavor.  Will definitely make again as it's an easy dish to take to work and reheat for breakfast!

Yummy quiche. Used real bacon bits instead of cooking bacon and it worked fine. Why would anyone use sweetened condensed milk when the recipe clearly states evaporated milk? You can use regular milk as well.

I really liked this recipe and my boyfriend said it was the best quiche he had eaten.  I made the recipe exactly as it was written and it was perfect.  Definitely not runny at all.  I did use the largest 3 eggs in my container but thats about it.  I definitely loved this recipe and won't look for another.  I am looking forward to trying different veggie combinations though.  Thanks for this recipe!!

My husband loves it.  I cut down the milk and only used 3/4 of the 12 OZ can of evaporated milk since some of the reviewers said it was too soggy.  It cooked in 35 minutes. Will make it again.

UPDATE - Funny, here it is over two years later, I had lunch recently with a friend I rarely see who was at the party in 2002, she made a comment about "that delicious quiche" that I brought to that party! So it really is a delicious recipe. I'm making it again for another party but this time I am going to brush some dijon mustard on the crust  - someone told me that prevents sogginess and adds a bit of "tang."  
ORIGINAL REVIEW 12/2002:
I made two for a party recently and it got raves. The first one got eaten up quickly, the second there was half a quiche left and one of the partygoers asked to take it home, so the hostess let her have it.

I made this quiche over 30 years ago I loved it then, and I love it now!  It was easy to make and cheaper than regular quiche, because there is no  heavy or half and half cream involved.  You use evaporated milk instead.  You can cut the fat even further by using fat free evaporated milk, and alpine lace swiss cheese with reduced fat for a real calorie saver.....You do not lose any of the taste, and no one even knows it's lower in fat, because you are not sacrificing the taste, only the calories....

Very easy and delicious! Have made it the original way and must say it has a much better texture with 4 eggs instead of three. Holds up to various additions/substitutions to filling (ham instead of bacon, cheddar cheeses, etc). A great, simple recipe that always impresses guests...use a pillsbury roll out pie crust and you are good to go! :)

I love this Quiche. I have made it with a variety of fillings including ham and cheddar. It always gets great reviews. The canned milk makes the texture great. I cook it for about 50 minutes to make sure it's not to runny.

This was very good and a huge hit at the baby shower brunch.  I had to cook it 30 minutes longer than the recipe called for, but it was worth the wait.  I used packaged, pre-cooked bacon pieces (not imitation bacos) so that my house didn't smell like bacon grease...you'd never know.

One of THE best quiche recipes! I used real bacon bits (6 T.) & saute'd the onions in a little butter. Don't leave out the nutmeg- it's such a great flavor enhancer! YUM!

Very easy and absolutely wonderful. Go ahead and make two - if there's any left, which is doubtful, it's a great leftover for a quick lunch!

I made quite a few dishes for a Mother's Day brunch, but this was the only thing that was completely gone, with several people commenting how good it was. I made my own pie crust instead of buying one, and added a little more swiss cheese on the top. Great quiche recipe.

This recipe is amazing!! It is extremely easy to throw together, but it tastes as though it took hours. I have changed the recipe a bit by using cheddar cheese instead of swiss and cinnamon instead of nutmeg and it still tasted great! Thanks Nestle! :)

This was GREAT!!  I made a few alterations for a healthier version and it was still fantastic.  I subsituted light cheddar & mozzarella for the swiss cheese, 150 ml Egg Beaters for the 3 eggs, used a thick piece of Ham instead of bacon, used 2 green onions instead of reg. onion and added some red pepper.  I did follow the suggestion of another cook and used only 3/4 of the can of Carnation.  Also they were all out of the 9" pie shells at my store so I used frozen small tart shells.  It made about 15 and this would be perfect for appetizers!!  The small shells took exactly 25 mins.  Enjoy!

This is a very simple yet very delicious quiche.  I made it for breakfast when my in-laws were staying with us and they seemed very impressed with it.  I used half and half when I found I had forgotten to purchase the evaporated milk and it came out wonderful.  I also found that it was necessary to use a lot more egg - I used six extra large eggs in mine and it barely covered all my bacon, onion, and cheese filling in a standard pie pan.

This is very good.  I ususally don't make quiche because it calls for either 1/2&1/2 or light cream -- neither of which I usually have on hand, but I always have a can of evaporated milk.  It was a very tasty meal.

Condensed milk is absolutely no substitute for evaporated! In Asia, it's used to make milk coffee and tea so you don't have to add sugar. Quiche is savoury not sweet! If you must find a substitute, cream is the closest. Overall, a very versatile recipe though I like to use chives for colour instead of onions. I usually add some parmesan for added richness as well. Guests complained why I bake only 1!

I love this quiche so much! Was so incredibly easy and my guests were totally impressed. I like that one reviewer's comment about the jalapeno cheese- sounds like a must do. People- read directions! Don't use sweetened condensed milk or you will make everyone laugh, or shake heads in frustration!

Sweetened condensed milk is NOT a suitable substitute for evaporated milk. It is sweetened, hence the name, and using it as a substitute will affect both the flavor and the texture of the dish....The quiche is good!

oops- didnt see the part about the deep dish pie dish- made a drippy mess all over my oven.  good texture though- and very fluffy.  i used evap skim milk, egg beaters, green onions (reserved just a touch of the bacon drippings to fry the onions- made the bacon flavor much more prominent in the quiche).  the husband ate 3 pieces!  will make again.

I used sweetened condensed milk, and that was a big mistake.I think that cutting down on the milk would definately be a good idea and adding one more egg as well wouldn't do any harm. As for the bacon, well ham would be a better choice.I don't think I'll ever be tempted to make quiche again because of the sweetness, but that shouldn't discourage anyone else from this,it's definatley one to play around with.

This recipe was very easy to make and the guys in the house ate it up - I honestly can't say how good it was because I didn't get any! I asked them and they said 4 stars, so this is their rating :) I'll make it again.

This is one of the best and simplest recipes that I have tried.  I used a can of evaporated skim milk and Kraft Smokey Swiss and Chedder Cheese and also some Monterey Jack cheese.  I have also added ham and onion. Each time it comes out perfect!

Excellent recipe!.  I used an extra thick slice of ham from the deli instead of bacon.  The nutmeg really added a great flavor.  We'll definitely be making this again!

When I made this, I really didn't think it could be that good.  But it really is.  It's super easy too.  It doesn't say in the recipe if you are supposed to break up the bacon when you put it in the crust.  I did because I thought it looked better.

This is the best tasting and best texture I have found in a quiche in a long time.  I've made this exactly as written and also with turkey bacon or mushrooms with the sauted onions...yummy!  Who would have thought nutmeg was the key?!

This recipe made a quick supper with leftover deli ham and cheese.  I did substitute cheddar/Monterey jack for the swiss.  It tasted great!  Husband and teen daughters all like this recipe.
