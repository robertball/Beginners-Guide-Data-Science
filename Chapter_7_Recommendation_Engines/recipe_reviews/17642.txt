This is an excellent recipe.  I didn't follow the recipe exactly and perhaps if I did, I would've given it five stars.  I used lemon pudding instead of lemon gelatin like some reviewers suggested.  Also, instead of poking holes in the cake so that the glaze could saturate the cake (like the recipe calls for) I poured it over the top.  The change I would make to the recipe would be to poke holes in the cake and pour the glaze into the holes like the recipe calls for.  This probably makes it REALLY lemony.  Then, I would pour a regular glaze over the cake.  This would make it perfect in my book.  By the way, for those of you wondering what apricot nectar is, it is apricot juice.  You can usually find a can of it in the juice aisle.  Libby's makes it and I am sure that others do as well.

This recipe is the "bomb"!  I followed the recipe exactly as written and its wonderful.  If you don't know what apricot nectar is, it is an apricot puree, much thicker than plain apricot juice.  It is usually found in glass bottles..Goya is one brand that I know of.  Apricot juice is NOT the same thing.

This cake was just ok to me.  I made it exactly as the directions indicated.  It did not turn out supermoist like I expected.  Next time I will use lemon pudding as other users have suggested and a quarter cup of sour cream (which I normally add to all of my cakes)  Sour cream ensures your cakes are moist and delicious.

I needed an Orange Pound cake, so I substituted all the lemon ingretients with orange; orange cake mix, orange gelatin, orange extract and orange juice.  It turned out perfect.

Yummy! I did everything the same except for one thing.  I doubled the amount of glaze.  I poured the other half of the glaze on top of the cake after I flipped it.  Everyone loved it and it was gone before we left the table.

I made this for an employees birthday and she requested a Lemon Pound cake like Publix makes.  I found this recipe and we were all very greatful I did.  It was extremely moist and flavorful.  Changes I made, I used pudding instead of jello and I didn't use the lemon extract.  I also reduced the cooking time to 40-45 min.  The glaze was perfect by adding a little zing to the bite.  After I glazed it I dusted it with powder sugar.  I will use this all summer long!

This cake is wonderful!! I had a piece of lemon pound cake at Starbuck's a couple of weeks ago, and wanted to duplicate it not only because of the price, but so I could always make it if I wanted to. This is exactly what I was looking for, and my husband has eaten half the cake already. After I cooled it, I refrigerated it, and plan to keep it in there until it's gone.

GREAT! When I add the following changes, it came out DELICIOUS! I noticed it tastes better when you add 1/2 package of lemon gelatin and 1 full package lemon pudding in it works best.  Also put 1/4 sour cream to make the cake moist.  For the icing I found this to be better:
1/4 cup sour cream 
2 1/2 tablespoons butter, softened 
2 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar 
4 tablespoons lemon juice 
 
For icing, in a small mixing bowl, beat the sour cream and butter until blended. Gradually add confectioners' sugar. Beat in lemon juice. Drizzle over the cake. Store in the refrigerator.

I love lemon so I could have eaten this by myself, but I made it for a baby shower where there were 4 other cakes to choose from and it was gobbled. My husband ate the remaining leftover piece the next day. I made it the day before and then put it in the fridge overnight and I think it intensifies the lemon. I don't like buying obscure ingredients so I used orange juice in place of the apricot nectar. Great texture. I also did as suggested by another reviewer and poked holes (with a skewer) around in the bottom of the cake while it was still in the bunt pan just out of the oven to pour the glaze in and then let it cool about 20 mins before removing it from the pan. Another tip for baking with bunt pans I read: instead of flouring your greased pan and having the white dust show when you take your cake out, make a paste with 1 Tbl melted butter and 1 Tbl flour and then brush it on your pan with a basting brush. Your cake will come right out and look pretty too.

So delicious, and easy and quick. Looks pretty. I can't say anything bad about this one. I will make this a lot. I don't usually use cake mixes, I prefer to make my own but I do buy cake mixes for my kids to use, but when I came across this recipe I just had to try it I am sure glad and you will be to. Thanks Pam

This cake should be called "Death By Lemon!!!"  It came out great I as well used lemon pudding instead of gelatin.  I also used the glaze and then melted lemon supreme icing and poured it over the cake.

You've outdone yourself on this one Pam! Its a lemon-lover's delight. Dense, moist, veeerrry lemony.Has a very course crumb, but the flavor is outstanding. Try this one with an orange cake mix. If you like citrus, you won't be disappointed! Thanks Pam.

I made this cake just last week and was really pleased.  I had no trouble doubling the recipe.  My mother took one to work and everyone wanted more as well as the recipe.  It was very rich and moist--much like a scratch cake.  One note, however: it is indeed lemony.  I thought it was a tad too tart.  When I make it the next time, I will do everything the same with one exception.  I'm going to try it with lemon pudding instead of the gelatin.

5 stars for this lemon cake it is truly the best, I have now made this several time. I have made a couple of changes to the glaze.  I add 2 table spoons of the nectar and the zest of 1 lemon to the glaze.  I also bake it in 2 loaf pans, it freezes well.  I also live overseas and can not always get Apricot nectar, so I have used Mango and peach nectar and the cake is still great.

I have made this 4 or 5 times by now, substituting different flavors of cake mix/jello mix. Lemon is wonderful, but our favorite is orange. Either way, I substitute orange juice for the apricot nectar. I haven't found it at the store. I will keep looking, because this is an easy dessert to whip up. Oh, one peice of advice: poke holes on the bottom of the cake, pour HALF of the glaze on the bottom & keep the other half for the top!

Absolutely sinful! If you like lemon flavor, this is the one for you! Definitely poke holes in the cake with a chopstick before pouring the glaze over it while still in the pan. I used lemon pudding mix instead of gelatin, and double the lemon extract. Also made a simple glaze of lemon zest, milk and confectioners sugar to pour over the top once cooled. Delicious!!

My son asked for a Lemon Pound cake for his birthday cake this year. (He will be turning 22 years old!) I found this recipe and thought I'd give it a try. I followed the recipe but added 1/4 cup sour cream and lemon pudding instead of lemon gelatin. Because I had to serve it to 12 people in a resturaunt, I decided to make cupcakes with this recipe. They turned out very moist. I poked holes in the cupcakes and poured 1 tsp of the glaze over it. I then mixed 1/4 cup water and 1/2 cup granulated sugar in a sauce pan. I mixed in 1 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp lemon extract. After the sugar was dissolved, I mixed it into 2 cups of confectionery sugar, and stirred in some yellow food coloring. I piped on some rose buds with some icing I already had. My husband loved this cupcakes. I will be taking the cupcakes 4 1/2 hours to see my son for his birthday /Easter.

This was the best cake I have ever made!!  I used the pudding instead of the gelatin and lemon juice instead of lemon extract because I didn't have any and I added 1/4 cup of sour cream like another reviewer suggested and it was super moist and addicting!!  I will only be making this on special occasions because it was way too good!!

This is my husband's favorite cake and has been for the past 45 years!  He got the recipe from a college slassmate's mother and gave it to me when we married.  I make it all the time and it never fails to be moist, flavorful and delicious.  The nice thing about it is that the longer it sits, the better it gets. But around here, it only lasts a couple of days!  If you can't find apricot nectar, peach nectar works well, too. Te only difference in my recipe is that I add 1 tablespoon of lemon extract.  It's not too much.  A real winner if you like lemon!

Excellent recipe.  My family loves pound cake and this one barely made it past the 24 hour mark.  Remember that the glaze is a GLAZE, NOT ICING, and you won't be disappointed.  Also, keep an eye on your baking time.  (This cake was ready in 45 minutes.)  Enjoy!

Overall, a very good cake.  Several comments or suggestions:  I did add 1/2 cup sour cream as other reviewers had sugggested - very moist with this addition.  I did not have apricot nectar, but cooked dried apricots with apple juice until soft, then pureed - worked great.  My only problem - I used a Bundt pan.  If this is your pan of choice, you will need to lower the oven temp a little and check it often - will be done much earlier.  I burned my cake after only 40 minutes.  Also, your cake will look nothing like the picture, as the glaze is just a glaze - NOT icing - so don't plan on that lovely look!  However, it does taste super lemony - got good reviews at my superbowl party.  I think I may make it again with a topping closer to icing.

This cake is absolutely delicious and very easy to make.   My grandmother made a wonderful Lemon Supreme Cake in the 1970's and this one really brought back memories.  If you like lemon flavor, you will love this cake.

This recipe is a definite keeper.  Instead of using a tube pan, I used two 8 in. loaf pans.  Next time, I want to use some of my mini loaf pans and wrap these lemony cakes as gifts for friends.  The cake was absolutely delish! Thanks!

This Cake was Outstanding!!  My husband always requests Lemon Cake on his Birthday and I have been using his Mom's recipe.  I found this recipe and tried it instead - it's easier and the taste (Sorry Mom) is better!  My husband agreed as well.  I found that it's even better after it's been in the Frig for a day!  This is a Keeper for sure!  THANKS!

I have made this cake so many times and every time I make this cake my children fight for the last piece. I add lemon juice to the batter to help make the cake a little more moist. Also I use a fork in the top before I glaze the cake so that will run down on the inside of the cake. This cake taste soooooooo good with some Haagen Daz Butter Pecan Mmmmmmmmm Goooooooooood

I made this last week for my husband's luncheon. It came out pretty good, but not really like a pound cake. I liked the icing, nice and lemony

Oh my GOD! Pam you are a genius. This cake has been made in my home on average of 2 times a month and has drawn unbelievable raves from everyone. I hold you singularly responsible for making ALL of us lemon cake addicts! Follow the recipe as written and it will come out AMAZING! I reserve 1/8 cup for when you flip it over and brush over top.

I've made this several time and never a bad review. It is easy and very lemony. I have used both lemon jello and lemon pudding with excellent results. I've also used an orange cake mix and lemon pudding and it was just as good. It's the glaze that makes it.

Good recipe. I was looking for that dense pound cake texture too, but mine was a little bit softer than I expected. I forgot to get lemon extract, so i used lemon juice into the batter as one reviewer mentioned, and i think i overdid the juice a bit, because it turned out extra-lemony. VERY good with a glass of milk, or a scoop of vanilla ice cream. I'll probably still sub lemon juice in the batter next time, (what's a lemon pound cake without real lemon?) but I'll use less juice, and it should be perfect. Definitely sprinkle it with additional confectioner's sugar after the glaze and cake have fully dried, for a nice immediate effect, but it will dissolve into the glaze after a day. It's tastes better the next day too.

This cake was an absolute hit with my dessert exchange group!  The only changes I made to the recipe was I used a 3.4oz box of lemon pudding mix instead of gelatin, and I baked it for 45 minutes (although I could have gotten away with a slightly shorter time, as the cake was a little overcooked around the edges).  The cake's texture was just right for a pound cake, and it was fluffy and moist.  The cake's flavor was a wonderful, rich lemon.  The glaze was extremely tart and lemony - almost too tart for me.  I would have been equally happy with a non-lemon powdered sugar glaze.  Glaze aside, I would definitely make this again!

This cake is fabulous!  It is just the right density and the perfect balance of sweet and tart.  The only change I made was using lemon pudding instead of gelatin.  This recipe will definitely be in my permanent repertoire.

This one is a keeper for sure! Made it last night and last night the glaze seemed to make it too tart, but as others have said, it's even better the next day. Today the glaze is not too tart at all, it's perfect. Next time I will experiment with making the glaze thinner and poke holes in the cake so that the inside of the cake is "jucier". My glaze didn't really soak inside the cake, it only coated the outside. Great tasing cake without the "box" taste.   Thanks Pam

This was an amazing recipe. I tweeked just a couple of things. I used lemon pudding instead lemon gelatin and I also added a quarter cup of sour cream to the batter. Also, I wasn't too sure about how the apricot nectar would be so I didn't use. But everything else turned out amazing.

Also, for an added touch: I took some of the store bought frosting; like Betty Crocker Vanilla extra creamy, stuck in the microwave for 15 minutes. I poured the liquid frosting on top of the cake and stuck it in the freezer for 10 minutes. It was amazing. It gave you a nice thick white icing. it looked excellent and would be great for presentation purposes. Just a thought.

Thanks again for a great recipe ;) Maybe next time I'll try the gelatin.

VERY easy and tasty (I made exactly as recipe called for)...my only dislike was the glaze.  I'm not used to a glaze on the bottom (I used a fancier bundt pan, forked the cake slightly after done cooking and poured glaze on/let set a bit before tipping cake out to slice - glaze was too wet. Keeping it refrigerated helped (even froze it before serving it at an event...that worked best.) Just made it seem like dough was still a bit raw when it was just a wet glaze. Next time I will make a less sweet, white glaze and drizzle on top of the cake once it's turned over. Cake looked very pretty sliced/laid out on a plate with sliced lemons in the middle for display!

This is great! I've made it several times, following the recipe exactly, and it always comes out well. I make it in a loaf pan instead of a tube pan and serve it like the lemon load from Starbucks. I use a fork and poke holes in the top to allow the glaze to drip down into the loaf. It is very lemony so if you are looking for something sweeter, this is not for you.

I only gave it four because I took on a lot of the suggestions. I used lemon pudding instead of Gelatin, Simply Lemonade in stead of apricot nectar and added 1/4 cup of sour cream as suggested for moisture. I did cook it on 345 for 55 minutes and only beat the igredients until they were incorporated, which was only about a minute and a half. I doubled the glaze as suggested and used the Simply Lemonade again instead of lemon juice as I was afraid it would be to acidic. Tje only problem I had was getting the cake out of the pan. I would recommend taking it out just as the the glaze sets of not a little bit before. Once the glaze hardened it was stuck. I know it was not stuck before I put it in the pan because when adding the glaze and tipping the pan the cake was actually wiggling. The cake was excellent. It tasted just like it was from the bakery which my husband loved. Dark crust and very heavy, which means good pound cake, and it couldn't be more moist! My husband has already had two pieces and said it was really good....so that is huge! I have only been trying to find the right recipe for 7 years! THANKY YOU!

This is a really good cake!  Like other reviewes, I made a couple of changes...I read other reviews before baking, and some had used jello, some had used pudding.  I used both.  I also used fresh squeezed lemon juice instead of extract, and threw in an extra egg to make the cake a little more dense.  Next time I make this--probably in a day or two, the first one won't last 24 hours!-- I'm going to use a small can of lemonade concentrate instead of the apricot nectar.  It'll be over-the-top lemony!

This was great!  My parents absolutely loved it and they aren't big "sweets" fans.  I didn't have lemon juice, so I made the glaze with powdered sugar and some of the left over apricot nectar!  Worked great!

I thought after reading all the nice reviews that this was the cake recipe I was looking for.  Sadly it was not.  I had trouble getting the cake out of the pan despite a thorough greasing.  The cake was moist but had a fall apart texture,very weird. I would definately never call a cake with this texture "pound" cake. It was just like a boxed cake mix to me even with all the add-ins.  The flavor was this poor "pound" cake's shining star.  The glaze gave the crumbs that sweet-tart flavor I was craving.

Thanks for posting, Pam.  This is a very easy and delicious lemon cake.  I was unable to find lemon cake mix today so I used a vanilla cake mix as a base.  I only needed to bake my cake for 40 minutes (using a bundt pan).  I should have used a tube pan though because when it came to pouring the syrup over, it didn't make it down the sides of the cake tin.  The cake itself wasn't sweet so the syrup was the perfect contrast.

I have made this twice.  The first time, I used other reviewers' advice and substituted lemon pudding, but it wasn't lemony enough for me.  The second time I followed the recipe exactly, but bought a lemon cake mix with pudding included to maintain moisture. I also added lemon zest to the glaze, and it was a wonderfully lemony addition to the afternoon tea I did.  My only issue is that it won't last long enough to try it after it has sat for a few days!

I made this for Thanksgiving for those who were not interested in the traditonal pies and it was a hit.  It was not overly sweet and it had the perfect balance of lemon.  The only change I made was that I omitted the apricot nectar.

My daughter and I love Lemon Cake so I was happy to find this one. On my first try the cake did stick so on the 2nd one I took it out of the pan eary as suggested on another review. I also used lemon pudding and extra lemon extract as suggested by others. My family loved it. I will be making this again.

I made this cake for a 4th of July potluck for work. It's pretty good but, like other reviewers, not as moist as I'd like.   The only change I made to the cake recipe was the addition of about 1 Tbsp. of lemon zest to the cake batter to give it more of a 'real' lemon flavor. I have to say to be careful with the baking time - I just happened to check the cake after 45 minutes and it was DONE. I can't imagine how it would have been with the additional 15 minutes!  For the glaze, I followed the directions exactly and had no issue with sticking. I do use the pan spray with flour (i.e., Baker's Secret or other brand). I did make an additional drizzle of a white glaze (same as that poured over the cake but thicker) for a more decorative look.   This cake tastes fine but, again, it's not as moist as I'd like.

I thought this was exceptional! I made it for my friends tea party birthday cake and all of the girls loved it! It came out super moist. I had not idea where to get apricot nectar. So I actually replaced it with Apricot preserves and I also did not have the lemon extract. But it turned out amazing! And was much easier to make than I anticipated! I highly recommend this cake.

Delicious! I didn't have apricot nectar so I substituted orange juice. I also used instant lemon pudding instead of lemon gelatin. A big hit with the entire family!

Mine came out a little dry but my oven is wonky so who know.  I made a second batch of the glaze and put it on the top/outside too for some super duper lemony-goodness.

This recipe was absolutely fabulous.  I left out the lemon extract and it was very lemony without it so it all depends on how lemony you want to go.  I suggest putting it in the fridge so that glaze hardens.  Highly recommended, everyone loved it.

This recipe is unexplainably great. I will be making this over and over again. I would just say watch the suggested backing time. The cake was done in about 45 minutes for me. I sliced it and gave it away to friends.

A keeper for sure. I did change one thing. instead of using package lemon gelatin I used a box of instant lemon puddin instead. I have done this in other box cakes and it make it so moist that no one will ever guess it all sarted from a box recipe.

i just used the glaze recipe as i already had my own lemon pound cake recipe.  i thought it was too runny and too sour.  i had to add some milk to it to get rid of the really sour taste and extra powdered sugar to thicken it up. thanks anyway...

I thought the cake sounded good but I didn't have all the same ingredients.  I used orange cake mix, orange jell-o and lemon extract.  For the glaze I used orange juice with the powdered sugar.  The instructions for the glaze "pour over hot cake before inverting"  sounded WRONG.  But I did it anyways and was sorry I did.  In my opinion icing or glaze should be drizzled over the top AFTER inverting for a much prettier appearance. A very large crumb also.  But very moist and tastey.

Very easy and different lemon pound cake!  The glaze seemed to make the cake moister and gave it a very nice, glossy look.  This would be great for a potluck or picnic.

This was seriously the hit of Thanksgiving!  I did make a few tweaks based on some reviewer suggestions but I'm sure these was just the cherry on an amazing recipe.  The changes I made are: Made it as a bundt cake.  I did half a package of lemon jello and a whole package of lemon pudding.  I added 1/4 cup of sour cream.  I changed the nectar to a 10oz jar of Apricot Just Fruit spread in the jelly section.  Right out of the oven, still in the pan, I poked holes with a skewer stick and used a basting brush to thoroughly glaze the bottom. Waited 20 minutes, flipped out of bundt and brushed the top of cake with glaze.  Once completely cooled, I made a frosting of powdered sugar with a tad of milk, lemon extract and yellow food coloring and drizzle over the top. We couldn't taste the apricot but my husband said that the cake tasted so perfect, that I should include it again next time anyway just in case it altered the taste in any way.

This cake is good but not outstanding.  The lemon flavor is very strong, and it bakes much more quickly than indicated. Also, it looks nothing like the picture, which has a bright yellow glaze, and the instructions to pour the glaze over the cake while it's in the pan then invert it makes no sense.

I baked this cake back in February for a friend of mine and she loved it!  I used the 3.4 oz box of lemon instant pudding and 1/4 cup of sour cream as suggested by some of the other reviewers and the cake was moist and lemony.  Also, I opted to drizzle the cake with some store bought lemon frosting with about 1/4 tsp lemon extract added to bump up the lemon flavor.  I've added this recipe to my "frequently used" collection.

I made this recipe, with only 2 minor changes. I doubled the lemon extract, and doubled the glaze. I poked holes in the cake when it came out of the oven and poured half the glaze over it while it was still in the pan. After I inverted the cake onto a plate, I drizzled the other half of the glaze over it.  I was bringing it to a birthday party, so I made it the night before. This cake did NOT disappoint! Everyone loved it.

I made this for my cousin's birthday because lemon cake is her favorite. She enjoyed it (as did others) and thought it tasted just as good (or better) as store bought cake. I certainly hope so! I liked it as well, but I do like denser pound cakes. I might try adding more flour next time for increased density.

This was more like a true cake than a pound cake. The lemon taste was great and I loved the simple lemon glaze. Though my cake turned out a little dry- maybe it was my oven? But it is worth making again and will be a great cake to take to all those summer bar b ques.

Very good cake.  Not quite the dense pound cake texture but it is dense enough.  
If you only have yellow cake mix you can add a teaspoon or so of powdered lemon koolaide but use sparingly.

This was really yummy!  The directions said to bake for 60 minutes, I just happened to check it at 40 minutes and it was done.  Maybe it was just my oven.  I did add the zest of one lemon, as well as its juice to the batter.

Wonderful! Loved the lemony, moist flavor.  I will be making it again and again. I added a little lemon juice to batter. Thanksgiving guests had to have recipe! It can not be too lemony for us!

This is a good cake - and easy, too. I used lemon pudding instead of lemon gelatin, as one reviewer suggested, with good results - the cake was not too tart at all. Delicious!

I just started baking and I cook for my aunt and uncle  who is 102 years old he just gets better with age like a fine wine and makes me feel like I can do anything it doesn't always come out as I like when I see pics of true art when I look at the pics of others that should be in a magazine but with that said u try your best and sometimes have to repair your design but mine came out sooo moist and the glaze was outstanding I then tipped it back over once I added 1/2 the glaze to what stuck to the pan then flipped the cake over and topped it with that yummy glaze over the top guess Im learning that it okay to think out side the box because it was moist and yummy I posted the pic anyway

I've made this cake quite a few times, but never wrote a review. It's just great. I've never served it without people asking for the recipe. Using the lemon gelatin instead of pudding, as some reviewers have suggested, makes the texture a bit different. This cake is more moist the day after you bake it.

I love it!  I added cream cheese to the icing. The baking time suggested was too long. I will try less time next time I bake it. It was delicious.

This cake is to die for.  Easy preparation. It works well in a bundt pan also. It is soooo very lemoney (if that is a word) and very moist.  Eveyone I have served this to is crazy about it!  I have made it several rimes and it comes out the same every time.  I do add about a teaspoon of lemon zest because I am such a lemon lover.  Once I was out of apricot nector and substituted mango nectar and the recipe worked just as well with no noticible change in taste.  Watch your baking time and check it at about the 50 minute mark as due to your oven it may not take the full hour to bake and it would be a shame to over bake this wonderful cake.  To whoever submitted this recipe, THANKS! - Linda O.

Wow!  Turned out moist (crumbly-moist, but good) and delicious!  Instead of apricot nectar, I used a full cup of crushed pineapple (plus some pineapple juice for the glaze, too).  The glaze turned out nothing like pictured... it was very liquid-y and ended up mostly soaking into the top and sides of the pound cake.  You can taste the glaze, but it didn't harden like shown.

YUM! Very lemony.  I doubled the glaze and only put a little bit on the cake while it was still upside down in the pan (since some of it drips off when you flip it on to the wire rack anyway).  I did poke some holes in the bottom of the cake before putting the glaze on the bottom, which the recipe doesn't tell you to do. Then after it was out of the pan I put the rest of the glaze over the top.  It was very good.  Next time I might try it with lemon pudding instead of jello to see how it compares.
