No wonder it's too salty. Try 1 teaspoon salt and 3 TABLESPOONS honey.

After reading the other suggestions, I realized that the measurements were, indeed, reversed for the salt and honey (use 1 tsp salt and 3 T honey!).  Even after making the adjustments with the salt and honey, I needed more flour - about 6 C total - and after kneading the dough for 12 minutes (!) the bread was still too dense for communion bread, and didn't seem cooked all the way through.  For home use it's a pretty nice taste, especially with homemade jelly - but the texture just won't make it for communion at church.

The bread came out very heavy and difficult for individuals to break apart.  I do not recommend this recipe at all.

I adjusted the salt (1 tsp) and added more honey (4tsp).  Next time I will add more honey.  It required more flour, about 6 cups.  We used this recipe for our matzo bread at Passover.  If you roll it out (with a floured rolling pin) very thin, about 1/4" thick, it makes it easier to chew.  My family really liked it.  Also, I baked it on a baking stone for 35 minutes, only basting twice with butter and once with egg.  Very good!

I tried to make one loaf of this.  Problem was that I added 3/4 Tablespoon of salt instead of 3/4 Teaspoon.  Everyone loved it, but it was obviously way too salty.  Goes well with other food.  Is it supposed to be that thick?

This recipe is way too salty.  I was expecting chewy, not doughy when it was done.  The consistency was more like that of bread that had not cooked fully and I let it cook past the full time recommended by the recipe.  I was in a pinch for a recipe and praying for a good one.  This isn't it! I didn't have time to make a trial run before I needed it.  If I had, I definitely wouldn't have served this at my church.

I really liked the bread but not for communion.  It was way to hard to tear and very heavy.  But we sure enjoyed eating it at home.  I won't make it again though.

This bread turned out tough and chewy, but not particularly tasty. It is quite salty and not sweet.  I do not recommend it.
