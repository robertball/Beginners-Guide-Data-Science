I made this using 3 regular-sized bagels, and pretty much just eyeballed the ingredients. I thought one cup of mayo sounded WAY too much, so I used a heaped tbsp, and it was plenty. This was quick and easy, but not something I would want too often. Thanks, debsling!

Made these exactly as the recipe was written, and they were a HUGE hit!  The only thing I might do differently next time is also make a batch of a vegetarian version- maybe cream of mushroom soup and replacing the ham with another veggie?  I had a few people who didn't eat red meat who were disappointed they couldn't try them.
