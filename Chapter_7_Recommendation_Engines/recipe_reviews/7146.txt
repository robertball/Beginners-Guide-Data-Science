These were great! However, in this recipe along with the others I've found for Cheddar Bay Biscuits, The "Bay" is missing. I've discovered it's Old Bay Seasoning. Here in Pennsylvania it's found by the seafood in the supermarkets. I added a dash to the batter and 1/4 teaspoon to the butter mixture and THEN it was exactly like the famous seafood chain restaurant!

Wonderful biscuits!  For this recipe alone I have become one of "those" reviewers ~ I am rating this recipe on changes made before trying the original.  I know, I know, shame on me!  I am only doing so as I had items in the fridge that I needed to use up!  Based on other reviews, I added the garlic and onion powder, parsley and 1/4 tsp of Old Bay seasoning to the mix.  In place of the water, I used buttermilk which makes a more flavorful biscuit.  As soon as the biscuits were done, I brushed the butter mixture (plus chives for color) on top of the biscuits and popped them back into the oven for about 2 minutes.  Full of flavor, easy to make with ingredients usually found in any cooks kitchen!  5 Stars!

I have always wanted to replicate the garlic-cheese biscuits from one of my favorit restaurants and now I can!  I followed other reviewers advice and doubled the cheese (about 1 cup) as well as adding 1 tsp. of garlic, 1/4 tsp. onion powder and about 1/2 tsp. of dried parsley to the biscuit batter.  In the butter, I added the called for amounts of garlic and onion powder, increased the parsley to 1/2 tsp (love the color and flavor) and omitted the salt.  I used baking spray rather than parchment paper and took advice from another reviewer and brushed the biscuits with the butter and popped them back in the oven for a few minutes.  Next time I will most likely increase the amount of garlic a bit and maybe make 1/2 a batch as these are hard to resist (I don't believe it's very kind to my waist line!)  Thanks Cookie...and also, would you happen to have the restaurant recipe for the blackened fish spice blend???  Yummy!

I LOVE Red Lobsters biscuits and being Australian and having NO Red Lobsters to go to - I had to create my own biscuits for my 4th of July celebrations.  They were SO easy and tasted SO much like the restaurant ones I couldn't believe it.  I didn't think that I was going to be able to survive until November when I come back over - but now with my recipe on hand - I'll be making these all the time.  My family also LOVED them and they have never had real American biscuits although my sister swore they were the same as a scone - I don't think so at all.  The only time consuming aspect of this recipe was the fact that I had to make my own Bisquik because we don't have it in Australia - luckily I had shortening on hand from my American Food Store.  Australians need to revise some of our cooking products that are seriously lacking.  AMERICAN FOOD ROCKS.
Tip:  dip your biscuits in French dressing - there's nothing better!!!!!!!

So yummy and so easy!  Next time I will try some of the other reviewers' suggestions - milk instead of water, adding the seasonings to the mix as well as to the butter topping, leaving the salt out, baking a little longer after adding the topping.  Even so they were nearly perfect and disappeared very quickly.

Nothing not to like with these!  I have never eaten at Red Lobster, so I have no idea what their biscuits taste like and cannot compare these to them.   But these were goooood.  So easy to make there really is no reason not to make them, and often.  I played with the recipe a bit, but without disturbing its integrity.  I used milk instead of water and a Danish Dill Havarti instead of cheddar (mainly for practical reasons, since I didn’t want the milk to go to waste and the Havarti for the same reason).  In keeping  with the dill already in the Havarti, I swapped  the parsley out  for even more dill weed in the melted butter mixture.  I deliberately made these oversized, planning ahead to use them for some breakfast sandwiches in the morning.  They’re just  delicious – golden and crusty on the outside, soft and tender on the inside.  Loved ‘em.

These were very close to RL's!  I did use milk, and added garlic powder, onion powder, and parsley to the dough as well as the butter.  My family was very impressed!

OK, these were VERY close to tasting like the real thing! Mine just came out to dry for my taste. I used the easy baking mix recipe instead of bisquick, and I also made my biscuits way too big. I had to end up baking them for over twenty min! So the next time I make them I'll do some adjustments on my end and they should turn out better.

The only change I made was that I put some of the garlic powder and a little bit of the parsley into the batter itself.  Everyone said they tasted EXACTLY like RL's biscuits!!

Great Recipe! I tried swiss cheese and they were out of this world! Can't wait to try them with cheddar!  Thanks for the great and quick recipe!  I did find that when they cool down or a day old, they taste great zapped in the microwave.

Needed a biscuit to go with some chicken/rice soup last night and thought I'd give this a try.
This recipe is THE BOMB!  Blows all other biscuits away! Simply delish and easy. Left my husband begging for more. Lucky him, we have left over soup for tonight. Doesn't seem like leftovers with these biscuits.

Wow! All I have to say that these biscuits were very good. It's tasty and cheesey delicious!  I halved the recipe since I was making for only two people. I used buttermilk in place of water and fresh minced parsley. I added the fresh parsley and garlic powder to the batter along with buttermilk. I doubled the amount of Cheddar cheese to 1 cup. I also added a dash of Old Bay seasoning to the batter as well. The dough was a bit sticky and I dropped about 10 biscuits onto a parchment line baking sheet. I brushed the top with melted butter. I used 1/4 cup of melted butter that had a dash of old bay seasoning, garlic powder, fresh parsley, onion powder and a little garlic salt. I omitted the 1/4 tsp salt. When the biscuits were done I brushed the top again. I thought these were just delicious, cheesey, tasty and awesome. There was nothing overpowering and I simply loved the cheese and garlic mixed in the fluffy biscuits. I think the buttermilk really adds a nice flavor and moistness to the biscuits. We ate all 10 of the biscuits up. The biscuits complemented the corn chowder soup very well. This is one recipe I will use again.

These are very good and do taste similar to the "chain seafood restaurant" biscuits. I actually like them better because they aren't as greasy. They are really easy, too!  The husband really liked them too, and he usually could care less about bread.

One tip: more spices! I made these, and my boyfriend and I decided they need more cheese and more onion powder. Old Bay was also important. I added all the spices to the dough and to the butter, and I could only taste a hint of the Red Lobster biscuit. Good thing is, the hint was delicious! Also, my texture was dead on. For y'all with dry biscuits, the lower temperature for more time is what's drying them out. I used milk instead of water, and baked them at 450 instead of 375. After 7 or 8 minutes, I brushed the butter on them, then popped them back in for another minute. Mix the dry ingredients before adding the milk.
Edit: I made these again tonight and added an extra oz of cheese, the given amount of spices to the batter, and the given amount again to the butter (added Old Bay to both). Baked them as I did before, brushing the butter on with 1 minute left, and they were perfect!

I'm not sure how the recipe would have turned out had I followed the directions exactly, but with a few alterations, they tasted EXACTLY like the RL biscuits (and 15 other people agreed).

First of all, the trick to making light and fluffy biscuits is to handle the dough as little as possible.  Earlier reviews stated that these biscuits were much more dense than the light RL ones, so remember to mix the dough only as long as necessary.

I doubled the recipe, so I added about 1 teaspoon of garlic powder to the baking mix (before the wet ingredients) to give it a garlic punch!  I also doubled the amount of cheese.

I think the real secret into making these like RL's, is to take them out after baking halfway, brush with the garlic butter mixture, bake the rest of the way, and then brush again with the garlic butter.  This keeps the biscuits moist and full of flavor!

All in all, I give this recipe four stars, because it did need some alterations, and like most bread recipes, after the biscuits sit out for a bit, the taste just isn't quite right.

But serve these fresh out of the oven and you will amaze your guests with that famous seafood restaurant appetizer!

I don't know what red lobsters biscuits taste like, but these were excellent! I added a bit of italian seasoning to the melted butter. I also found them a bit salty so next time I will omit the salt or use unsalted butter. Overall they still rate a 5 star in my house.

Great and easy!  I cut the recipe in half, and used only 1/2 cup cheddar cheese, and only 1 tbl butter for the brushing.  I would definitely omit the brushing on the top next time - way too salty and too buttery.  I would rather see the spices in the dough.  The 2nd time I made these, I followed others' suggestions:  I doubled the cheese (used 1 cup), added 1/4 tsp. Old Bay seasoning, 1 tsp. fresh garlic, 1/4 tsp. salt, 1/4 tsp. onion powder, 1 tsp. parsley, and replaced the water with milk (note that skim milk works fine).  Baked for 15 minutes on parchment paper, then brushed butter on the top.  Perfect!  Thanks for the recipe!

These are great, my mom used to make them but they were never like the ones red lobster serves (kind of dry) but this recipe is wonderful and moist and fluffy. i cut this recipe in half (only feeding 5 people in my family) and i did however add a pinch of garlic powder to the batter and brushed them with the butter mixture and put them back into the oven for a couple of minutes and brushed them again just before serving.

I had a recipe fiured out that was "okay" then in a hurry one night I did a search on the web and found THESE. They are positively the best. I e-mailed to all of my friends to get to the site and make them. The response was just like mine, WOW. I now use my "other related italian restaurant" Grilled Chicken Fettucini recipe with these and we save about $50. I even served them with Thanksgiving dinner!

Used this baking mix, which makes exactly 4 cups: 
http://allrecipes.com/PersonalRecipe/62611486/Hannahs-Baking-Mix/Detail.aspx
I also doubled the cheese, used milk instead of water, and added 1/4T of Old Bay seasoning, 1t of garlic powder, 1/4t onion powder and 1/2t of dried parsley to the biscuit batter. I baked them in a mini-muffin pan, which worked out nicely. After basting with the butter mix, I put them back in the oven for a couple of minutes. Delicious!

Wow!  I make these quite often, because they are so delicious.  I always eat more than I should when we have these for dinner.  As other reviewers suggested, I substitute milk for the water, add the Old Bay seasoning, garlic powder, onion powder, and parsley to the mix.  I love cheese, so I usually put in a little less than a whole 8oz. bag of cheese.  When there are 2 or 3 minutes left, I sprinkle the rest of the cheese from the bag onto their tops and turn on the broiler for a minute or two to get the cheese nice and crispy.  This results in a soft inside and semi-crispy golden brown top.

I don't know what RL biscuits are like but my husband looked at them and took a bite and said, "These are RL biscuits."  Way too salty on top.  Next time I will leave out the salt.  But yummy still!

These were great. My whole family loved these. They stayed soft and moist and were easy to make. I didn't have any parchment paper so I just sprayed the pan good. They didn't stick. I didn't add any salt and I used Italian seasoning in the garlic butter. I will definately be making these again.

These biscuits were tasty, although they didn't remind me of the Red Lobster ones. Still, they made for a good addition to the meal. I took the advice of other reviewers and added Italian seasonings to the butter. I also rolled out my biscuits because I like them better that way.

This is an awesome recipe but I did one change and it totally makes it identical to Red Lobsters! I added between  1/4 to 1/2 tsp of Old Bay seasoning in with the melted butter and other spices! This is whats missing!!

These were great bisquits.  I made them once as written, they were a very good start may be 2 stars. Second attempt:  I read the reviews and added 1/8 teaspoon old bay, and then the garlic and onion powder to the bisquick, I also probably trippled the cheese and also used whole milk instead of water.  Made up the butter sauce exactly as written.  I used an icecream scoop for the drop biscuits and when they were done I put the butter mixture on them and put them back in oven for 3 min.  These bisquits are exactly like Red Lobster's !!! Take the hints from the other reviewers and you will be in love with this recipe !!!

These tasted exactly like the RL version.  I made them with the baking mix recipe also on allrecipes.com as I live in the UK and can't get Bisquick here.  My son, who is nine months old, loves these and will eat as much as he can get given!

This is a wonderful base recipe! I took suggestions of others and substituted the water out for buttermilk, added old bay seasoning to both the mix and the butter topping, and it's a hit every time. Oh, and added more cheese too.

These are such good biscuits!! Pretty close to the ones served at Red Lobster but I can make them at home instead of having to buy them. A couple of things I have done differently based on suggestions from reviewers is that I double the cheese, use whole or 2% milk, and I include the seasonings in the batter as well as in the melted butter. Once you have brushed the biscuits with the butter, bake a little longer in the oven and they come out golden and crispy!

Fabulous and addictive! I made them 3 times this week. Try adding seasonings to the biscuit mix as well as the butter topping for extra flavor. A bit of Old Bay works well if you're serving them with seafood. I've also sprinkled in dill and chopped garlic and experimented with different cheeses. A winner!

I have not made this particular recipe, but my version is to use club soda in place of the water.  This makes for fluffier biscuits.  And I just use melted butter and garlic powder to brush on top.  Yummy to the tummy!!

Wow..these are very close to you know who's.  I love it when I can make homemade bread and have it turn out successfully.  These were awesome.  I was very generous with the herb mixture.  I like to brush some on before and after they bake.  These are great with the zuppa toscana recipe also on this site.  Will definitley keep in my bread rotation.  Thanks Cookie...cute name :)

I halved this recipe, however, used 4 ozs. of shredded cheddar.  I also used the the seasonings in the dough itself along with some cayenne pepper to give it a little zing.  Unfortunately I didn't have any parchment paper and they stuck to my non-stick cookie sheet.  Regardless, they were soooooo good!

Only recommendation is that you sprinkle the parsley on top after you have buttered them.

*danger, danger-remember portion control* these are very hard to resist! Super easy and super good! We used the lower fat version of the baking mix and these were still so tender and flaky, we all loved them! I loved them the most since my daughter made them while I was putting together the salad.

So authentic! I used the "Easy Biscuit Mixture" on Allrecipes. I added the garlic & onion powder, salt and parsley to both the mix and then again to the butter, and they turned out great.

Mixed reviews, but I used a multi-grain mix to make it.  I'm sure with another one, it would be very popular.  It was still good, very tasty flavor.

These were pretty good, but, I will look for a by- scratch recipe instead of using baking mix. I wasn't crazy about the baking mix texture & flavor.

Will try the "Old Bay" seasoning the next time, as other reviewers suggest, as well as mixing some of the spices in with the biscuit dough.  Very good, though!  Best warm & not day-old...

These were pretty good.  I used skim milk instead of the water and pretty much doubled all the spices.  I still thought they were a bit bland and needed something more.  Will try these again but will add alot more for seasonings.

These didn't turn out nearly as yummy as the ones at Red Lobster or Ruby Tuesday, but I think I made the mistake of compressing the dough, so the biscuits were too dense.

I doubled the cheese and liked it that way, but my husband didn't even notice that it had cheese in it.  I used a sharp cheddar; next time I might try extra sharp.

These are fantastic! My husband and I can't get enough of them. Made them with and without the Old Bay seasoning but it is the key to making them taste like the restaurant version.

I made a half batch and based on other reviews I added the same amounts of the seasonings for the butter mixture to the baking mixture, including 1/8 teaspoon Old Bay seasoning to both.

For the baking mix I used the recipe for Easy Biscuit Mixture from this site with a bit of extra salt and sugar.

Made smaller biscuits (approx. 18) and baked for 21-23 minutes @ 400.

Then brushed with butter mixture, kept brushing until it was gone and then added a few shreds of cheddar to the top of each, and put back in the oven for an extra 1-2 min.

They came out fluffy and moist with excellent flavour and a nice hit of salt. Putting them back in the oven also helps keep them from having a super greasy top.

Thanks for this - so good!

I was really looking forward to these.  And while they certainly weren't bad, they were good when I drowned them in the butter/garlic sauce.  One simple brushing was not nearly enough.  I wonder what they would be like with the garlic and herbs baked inside?

OMG!! I thought I was at RL's when I bit into that biscuit! WOW they are so dead on and they taste so amazing. A few modifications I made that made these awesome: while mixing dough add garlic powder onion powder and parsley in and mix in well with dough, this gives the dough that wonderful flavor of those biscuits we love so much, once the biscuits are in the oven follow recipes instructions for making the butter to go over biscuits including recommended measuerments of seasonings, about 3 to 5 min before biscuits are done brush one by one with butter, finish baking let biscuits stand for 1 minute then brush with butter again to make shiny, also watch your biscuits as these aren't supposed to brown, so you don't want the botttoms to burn because the tops still look light...hope this helps and happy baking!! Thanks for the recipe!!

I made these biscuits for a sick neighbor. Her family happened to be over also. They disappeared quickly. Needless to say I had to go back across the street and make some more. Good thing I has biscuit mix already done. I add 1 tsp.garlic powder, 1/4 tsp. onion powder, 1/2 tsp. dried parsley and increased cheese to 1 cup. Deeelish!!!!!

Bland, did not resemble Red Lobster's biscuits.  Probably would be better if they were not made w/ biscuit mix, but made like a traditional biscuit.

These don't taste like Red Lobster's biscuits, in fact, with a few changes, I think these are even better.  By the way, the butter mix is way too much.  Halving it should be fine.  I made some changes. I had fresh parsley, so I chopped that up and added about two tablespoons to the the bowl, along with  garlic powder and 1 teaspoon of Old Bay seasoning.  Next time, I think I'll use two teaspoons of Old Bay.  I added 1/3cup melted butter to the batter, doubled the cheese, and used only 1 cup of water.  Be careful with the water.  The amount you need varies on the humidity in your house, and adding the melted butter mean you need to pay extra attention when adding the water.  The dough shouldn't feel wet.  I pulled the biscuits out a few minutes before they were done, brushed them with the butter mix and put them back in the oven.  Then, when they came out, I brushed them with butter again.  Fattening, but so delicious.  And if you've decided to make cheddar biscuits you've already committed to spending extra time at the gym.

Super easy and the family just raved!  I did modify this recipe however by adding 1 tsp of the garlic powder and 1 tsp of the Parsley and half tsp of the Onion powder into the biscuit mixture.  I also returned them to the oven for about 2 minutes after brushing with the butter mixture which gave the biscuits a nice golden color.

I made/served these cheddar bay biscuits this evening for dinner with homemade potato soup. Everyone, including a picky 3 year old, loved these. I did substitute milk for the water and  I also added the spices to the biscuit mix as well upon suggestion from others and i'm glad I did because these were excellent. I understand why some people get peeved because people rate a recipe only after they have "tweaked" it so to speak, but with cooking this is just a given. It doesn't mean you have to make those same changes to the recipe and you are free to leave it as is if you want. I actually enjoy reading and trying other tips and tweaks and if someone can tweak a recipe of mine and make it better or more delicious, then have at it!!! To each there own I guess.

These were pretty good as is, but next time I will use either frozen or canned biscuits and just use the topping for this recipe. I wasn't a huge fan of the taste of the actual biscuit, but the topping was very tasty.

These are the best biscuits hands down. I added more garlic but other than that I followed the recipe as is.

I followed the bisquik recipe  with milk, and added the Old Bay seasoning.  It took alot longer than 12 minutes to bake mine, as I made mine larger.  I also put them back in the oven for two minutes after brushing the seasoned butter over them.  My wife says they are pretty close to the restaurant's bisquits. Thanks, all!

I've been dying to try this recipe ever since I came across it but being a new mom, time just wasn't on my side. I decided to try it last night but I didn't have the proper measuring cups/spoons so I eyeballed it. I used the biscuit recipe in the footnote and before really thinking I used the entire biscuit mix instead of 4 cups. That turned out to be a disaster. This morning I just couldn't give up so I had at it again...I followed the advice of other reviewers and used milk instead of water, added the spice along with a little old bay seasoning to the batter mixture AND in the butter. I must say that these are by far the best biscuits! Very proud of myself because I've never made homemade biscuits! I made them for my co-workers and a few of my clients and they were a big hit. Extremely similar to those at my favorite seafood restaurant. Oh I did omit the salt since I used old bay seasoning. I'd highly recommend this recipe as it's easy to make, and simply delicious.

Yes, these are great indeed. 4 stars because it tasted better when I doubled the cheese and spices. I added some cayenne too. They are so easy to make. I doubled the size and served it with a chunky veggie soup for for dinner. They freeze ok. So go ahead make extra. Anytime you are busy, make a throw-everything-into-the-crockpot veggie soup and serve with these biscuits. Easy and tasty.

These were phenomenal.  I added a little garlic powder into the biscuits themselves because I'm a garlic fiend.  They ended up buttery and garlicy and perfect.  My husband raved about them throughout dinner.  The best part is, they weren't just the most delicious biscuits in the world, they were easy, too!

Missing something. I tried a version of these where you cut a 1/4 cup of cold butter into the Bisquick that were MUCH better.

Easy to make biscuits!  I added all the seasonings to the dough and only brushed them with butter at the end.  I followed two other reviews that said add 1/4 teaspoon bay seasoning and to brush them with butter and put them back in the oven for a minute or two.  Then I brushed them lightly again right before serving.

After following the adjustments suggested by other reviewers these biscuits turned out better than I ever could have imagined!   They taste exactly like the biscuits from RL!   I added Old Bay and the other seasonings to the dough and added a heaping cup of cheese.    I don't like to bake at all, but this recipe was SO easy, I'll be making it a lot!   Oh, I used Bisquick and it worked great.   Maybe next time I'll try the easy biscuit recipe from this website.

Absolutely fabulous. I took the advice of another review and added Old Bay seasoning to the mix and they were absolutely perfect. Only problem I have is when I add the butter mixture to the biscuits after they are cooked, the biscuits tend to want to stick onto the wax paper and I end up pulling the paper off. Other than that...WONDERFUL!! One to add to the recipe book.

This was my first time making ANY kind of biscuits and I am glad I picked this one!  Loved, loved, loved them!  My 4 year old had 3 he loved them so much.  The butter topping is amazing, I ended up dipping mine in the leftovers.  Not diet friendly, but who cares!

These were good I used the bisquit baking mix from this site.  I also cut them in half and used milk instead of water.  I really liked the texture of these but I think next time I will cut out the salt, cut the butter in half and not use any onion powder.  Thanks for sharing!

dThese came out good - but my husbands biggest complaint is that you can really taste the bisquick  mix flavor too much. I think you would be better off with a home made biscuit recipe adding in the cheese, and other seasonings.

Couldn't believe how much these tasted like the real thing... which is fantastic because living in Florida where seafood is fresh and readily available we don't have much reason to go to seafood restaurant chains. :) Thank you to Tricia M for the advice on Old Bay.  Had never heard of it before and that really was the magic indredient!  Will 1/2 the recipe in the future.  For 2 people it's a lot and leftovers aren't nearly as good.

These were very good, I used garlic butter instead of the mixture listed to save time, but I preferred it without.  Also, I made two batches, one at the temperature suggested in this recipe and another at the temperature suggested on the box.  The temp listed resulted in a slightly dry biscuit, and they took about 17 min to cook.  The temp on the box (450F) resulted in a much lighter, fluffier biscuit and only took about 10 min to cook.  I recommend making this change.

Oh wow, these were good!  I used a lot more cheese, added a little Old Bay, and brushed the butter mixture on the biscuits before and after baking.  The only trouble I had was working with the dough ... it was incredibly sticky, but soooooooooooo worth it!  Served them with Christmas Eve Beef Stew (which was also fantastic!), and everyone loved them!

I have been making this recipe for years now, but came up with a few alterations over the years that make these biscuits really taste like those famous restaraunts!  All you need to do is add half a stick of melted butter to the batter with a good sprinkling of garlic powder - and increase the cheese to 1 cup.  Perfect!

I made these biscuits last night and my picky children thought they were very good!  I doubled the cheese because 3 oz. didn't appear to be nearly enough, and I was pretty generous with the herbs.  I brushed the biscuits with the butter mixture halfway through baking and also when the biscuits were done.  I wouldn't say the biscuits were as light as the ones at the restaurant (perhaps because of all the extra cheese I added), but they still were extremely tasty, and this recipe will go into my permanent file.  Thank you!

These were fantastic!  I served with these with salmon chowder (from this site) for lunch today.  They were a big hit.  I ended up only using about half of the butter mixture, so I would cut back on it next time.
***I made these again but used buttermilk in place of the water and they were fantastic!***

My husband worked for Red Lobster in Canada while attending college - he and I both agree these tasted exactly like the biscuits!  I made half a batch; I added twice as much cheese.  They probably could have used a bit more cheese though.  I measured the dough with a 1/4 measuring cup and scooped them onto the cookie sheet.  I also used a generous amount of the spices called for.  These biscuits were DELICIOUS!  Served them with my homemade clam chowder.  Thank you for the "secret."

I have made these several times now and they are great.  I added a litte garlic powder to the dough.  they are almost exactly like RL.  I live in Maine and haven't had these since we moved here.  There are no Red Lobster restaurants in the state (go figure)!

These were good...but I don't think they tasted too much like the ones at the seafood restaurants.  I added some garlic powder and parsley.  I think they were a little heavy as well.  Will tinker with again and make.  Thanks for the post.

Very close to Red Lobster's cheese biscuits.  On the recommendation of other reviewers, I added half of the herb mixture to the batter.  Next time, I would not use an entire half-cup of butter to brush on the biscuits; half of that would be plenty.  I grated 1/4 of a 1-pound block of cheese, which would be 4 ounces, and thought it worked nicely, but I'd add a little more next time.  And lastly, the biscuits stuck to the parchment paper lining!  I baked them in two batches, so on the 2nd one I just sprayed the pan with cooking spray and it worked great.  Thanks for the recipe!

I love these biscuits.  IMO they are the best thing about red lobster.  I didn't use bisquick because i don't like how it makes biscuits taste so i whipped up some buttermilk buscuits from scratch.  My batch was about half of this recipe so it was a bit too much cheese, but boy oh boy were they light and fluffy, and tastey.  I would strongly recommend to everyone to just add the cheese to HOMEMADE dough.  As for the butter topping, I didn't have butter so i used margarine and it was still good.  I added more garlic, since my family are garlic hounds and i added some italian seasoning. Plus i omited the salt and just used onion salt, but next time i think i will omit that too.  I followed other reviews and brushed the tops pretty heavily with the butter mixture about 3/4 of the way through cooking.  THey browned up beautifully, just like at the restaurant.  When i pulled them out, i poked the holes with a toothpick like one reviewer suggested and lightly brushed more butter on top.  They smell and look wonderful.  My three year old couldn't get enough and this is the first batch of biscuits i have EVER made where my husband didn't slaughter 'em with butter.  I served them along side a country fried steak dinner.

These turned out really well!  They taste very similar - if not exactly like - the ones at Red Lobster.  I worked at one for over 3 years, so I've had my share!  =)

I'd always been disappointed by Red Lobster copycat recipes for their biscuits. I have found that the biscuits taste the same, but the butter/garlic coating doesn't taste "right". Instead of this melted butter mixture I mix 1 tsp. parsley flakes, 1/2 tsp. garlic, 1/2 tsp. italian seasoning and 1/4 c. melted butter to coat with and this makes it taste VERY similar to Red Lobster biscuits.

Mmm Good!  A very quick and easy biscuit to round out a meal.  Instead of water, I used milk and they were moist and fluffy.  Thanks for the recipe.

These biscuits were really good!!  I used bisquik for the baking mix and milk instead of water.  I also added a little onion powder, cheddar cheese and freshly grated parmesean cheese to the mixture.  I baked at 400 for about 10 minutes. Then brushed them with the melted butter, garlic salt and italian seasoning mixture (like someone earlier had recommended) and put them back in the oven for a few more minutes until they were golden brown. They are also good the next day if you reheat them in the microwave.

A cookie scoop made it easy to portion these out, and it also helped them bake more evenly.  (I may be the only one, but when I make drop biscuits with spoons they tend to be spiky and I end up with little overdone horns all over them.)  I will have to change the name of mine to Monterrey Bay Biscuits, as it turned out that I had Monterrey Jack and not Cheddar in the stash. For my topping I used a tsp of Lawry's Garlic Salt, a quarter tsp of Old Bay, and a healthy shake of Parmesan cheese.  Another dash of cheese over the whole batch after I added the butter mix...just for good measure.  My husband is not a huge bread eater, but he crammed three of these in his mouth as soon as they had been topped, and declared them to be better than the original.  Thanks for such a great recipe.  This is a keeper!

WOW - DELICIOUS!  I cut the recipe down to only make 5 biscuits.  So glad I did as it is very hard to stop with only one!  Great recipe that I will be using again.

Wow. I have to say I am a little bit disappointed in this recipe. I felt the dough was really bland and not at all like the ones I get at Red Lobster. I will try this again but I'll be adding spice to the dough mix and see if I can get a better result. This has been the first recipe that I've really disagreed with the ratings that others had put on. One more try with some spice to remedy the blandness and if it doesn't work, this one gets eliminated.

I cut this recipe in half, just me and my hubster. I made them too big but it didn't matter, they were delicious. I replaced the water with buttermilk because no biscuit should ever be made with anything else. Great tasting and easy to make.

These biscuits are so yum! I cut the recipe in half, and for the dough I used 1 cup shredded Mexican blend cheese, 1 tsp. garlic powder, 1/4 tsp. onion powder and 1/4 tsp. Italian seasoning. Baked at 400 for 10 minutes, then brushed with the 1/4 cup melted butter and 1/2 tsp. each garlic powder and parsley. Popped back in the oven for 2 minutes. Hubby ate half of these right out of the oven and I have orders to make these much more often from him and my Mom. A total keeper! Thanks for the recipe Cookie.

If you want them to taste more like the original, cut 4 T. of butter into the dry mixture before adding the milk. The difference is amazing.

This recipe is really good.  I did like a lot of the previous reviewers have stated and added the 1/4 teaspoon of Old Bay Seasoning to the butter mixture.  I also doubled the cheddar cheese. These changes did make the recipe taste like the ones at Red Lobster.

Wow, I thought I was going to destroy this recipe when I began making my own biscuit mix and was out of shortening and butter!  
I used healthy olive oil in my mix (and saved my 2 tablespoons of butter for the top.  Turned out wonderful!!  Thanks so much for posting this recipe!

Holy poop these biscuits were fabulous!!!  I did follow another reviewer's idea to add a dash of Old Bay to the dough and 1/4 tsp to the brushed-on butter.  I haven't been to that certain seafood restaurant in years, but these taste spot on with what I remember!

I think someone may have mentioned this already, but here goes...  I was in a hurry and didn't fully read the recipe.  I put all the herbs/spices into the batter instead of the butter.  Oops... but it turned out great that way!   I put melted butter with a brush on the table and let people brush butter on top of their biscuit when they were ready to eat it.  Worked very well.  I just ate one this morning as a snack... even reheated for 10 sec. in the microwave, and with no butter added, it was very good.   They are really close, if not exactly like, the biscuits at Red Lobster.  So easy and tasty!  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.

The easiest yummiest biscuits ever.  Doubled the cheddar and added the spices to the mix too.  Brushed the tops with the spices n butter about 2 mins before finished. YUM!

AMAZING! I made these last night, and when I woke up in the morning there were only three left! I used 1/2 tsp Garlic Powder, 1/4 tsp Onion Powder, Parsley, and Paprika into the batter itself. I will definitely make these again! Thanks! :)

These were delicious but I did make quite a few changes based on the other reviews. I halved the recipe but kept the amount of cheese the same.  I also added some garlic powder, dried parsley, and Old Bay to the batter.  I also added some Old Bay to the butter mixture and after brushing it on I returned the biscuits to the oven for  a few minutes.  The only thing I would change for next time would be to increase the amount of cheese even more to 10 oz.  Thanks for the great recipe.  I will definitely make these again.

I didn't find they had enough cheese or salt but to be fair I had to make my own biscuits since I am in South Africa. I did use Fluffy Biscuits from this sight with your ingredients but I didn't think they were tasty enough. Next time I will double the ingredients.  and see if they taste like Red Lobster. I so do miss yummy biscuits :( Miss American food.

Very Good!  I doubled the cheddar cheese and added garlic and onion powder, and dried parsley to the batter as well as the butter mixture as other reviewers suggested, and was glad I did.  Also after baking the biscuits and brushing with butter, popped them back into the over for about 3 minutes.  Perfect.  Took them to a birthday party and they were a hit!  Thanks Cookie for a great recipe.

awesome! Followed other reviews and added one cup cheese and added the dash of old bay to the dry mix along with all of the seasonings to the dry mix, along with milk instead of water. Also added 1/4 tsp of old bay to seasonings into butter mixture and spread on 2 minutes before biscuits were done baking. Awesome! Just like the restaurant that rhymes with fred bobster!!!!

Yup, these taste very similar to the famous seafood restaurant. My son said the are better. Light, fluffy, cheesy, garlic.  Can't go wrong.

Fantastic. Very moist and nice garlicky flavor. I used monteray jack cheese - it's what I had. These were super easy and they required no kneading, no rolling out,  and no cutting. I used 2% milk instead of water because that's what I do. Excellent quick little bread! Thanks :)

Fabulous little cheddar bay nuggets of goodness. I've never cared for store-bought baking mix so I used the "Easy Biscuit Mixture" recipe as suggested in the footnotes of this recipe. Total biscuit perfection. They look as delectable as they taste.

These were very good and quite simple to make. I used milk instead of water and doubled the amount of shredded cheese.  I also added a dash of onion and garlic powder, dried parsley and Old Bay seasoning to the mix itself.   Once they were baked, I only used about 1/4 cup of melted butter, omitted the salt and used the other seasonings for the coating, also.  Bonus was I had 3 left over, so I put them in a zip lock bag in the fridge.  When I wanted to warm them up, I took a paper towel and dampened it and wrapped the 3 biscuits inside it and put in the microwave for about 40 seconds.  They were warm and did NOT get hard.  This is a great recipe!!

Definitely needs parsley and seasonings in biscuit mix itself. You almost have to put it back in the oven after brushing the butter on or you won't get that crispness like at the restaurant and it will just be wet. I would put in slightly more cheese and seasonings next time. I substituted the water for milk. Make sure you make these small because they turn out huge!

I added a dash of Old Bay and minced garlic. My tips: bake at 400 degrees.  Combine Bisquick with cold butter in a medium bowl using a pastry cutter or a large fork. You don't want to mix too thoroughly. There should be small chunks of butter in there that are about the size of peas. Add cheddar cheese, milk instead of water, and ¼ teaspoon garlic. Mix by hand until combined, but don't over mix.  3. Drop approximately ¼-cup portions of the dough onto an ungreased cookie sheet using an ice cream scoop.  4. Bake for 15 to 17 minutes or until the tops of the biscuits begin to turn light brown.  5. When you take the biscuits out of the oven, melt 2 tablespoons butter is a small bowl in your microwave. Stir in ½ teaspoon garlic powder and the dried parsley flakes. Use a brush to spread this garlic butter over the tops of all the biscuits. Use up all of the butter.

I didn't get the "wow" factor with these that so many other people seemed to get.  I thought the seasonings needed to be kicked up a notch to taste like the ones from Red Lobster.  If I didn't know they were supposed to taste like the ones from Red Lobster, I never would have made the comparison.  I used homemade baking mix since I didn't have any store-bought.

YUM YUM YUM! I have made these 2 times. Once according to the recipe and they came out great. Tonight I made them with these changes: Buttermilk instead of water, made my baking mix with a recipe off this site, added garlic to the biscuit mixture, used a full cup of cheese, added Old Bay seasoning to both the butter mixture and the biscuit mixture, no salt to the butter mixture because I used salted butter, and baked them after I brushed them with butter, and brushed them again. They are BETTER than Red Lobster! I can't wait to have the leftovers:-D

WOW! These were great!  I served them with the "Delicious Ham and Potato Soup" from this site, and they were so popular only one was left for me to photograph.  I took other reviewers' advice and added the spices to the Bisquick in addition to adding them to the melted butter.  I also doubled the cheese and used milk instead of water.  Yum!

Excellent and just like the biscuits served at you-know-where! I used heart-healthy Bisquick instead of regular and it didn't make a difference. As another reviewer suggested, I added parsley flakes to the batter, and returned the biscuits to the oven for 2 minutes after brushing with the butter/garlic powder/parsley flake mixture. Served with Chicken & Corn chili from this site. The whole meal was delicious!

YUM YUM YUM YUM! These were awesome! I used my pastry brush to brush on the butter mixture before they went in the oven , halfway through and when they came out. They were buttery and delicious! I added a touch of garlic powder to my batter too. My husband ate 3 of them at dinner!  Served it with the Crab Stuffed Mushrooms and Sole with Butter Sauce from this site. Even better than going out!

Everyone that has had these cheers when I make them.  I do add significantly more cheese than the recipe states otherwise they are a little boring.  I also omit the salt because it's just not necessary.  Very good otherwise!

These are really good!  I can't compare them to those at RL since I've never eaten there, but I can say these are yummy and soooo easy to make.  I used Pioneer Brand Buttermilk Biscuit Mix.  I made one batch and used 1 cup of cheese, then I made another half batch to make sure I had enough for my family dinner tonight.  The 2nd batch, I added some garlic and onion powder to the mix, and it was good like that too.  If you like a stonger garlic taste, I'd recommend doing it that way.  I will definitely be making these often.  Thanks for the recipe!  Oh and I didn't have parchment paper, so I just simply sprayed my cookie sheet with nonstick spray, and it worked fine.

These were yummy.  I substituted Johnny's Garlic Spread & Seasoning for the garlic powder, onion powder, salt and parsley in the butter.  I added some to the dough as well.  The whole family loved them.  Note that the serving sizes are for somewhat small biscuits.

Delicious!  I put them back in the oven for 2 or 3 minutes after brushing with the butter mixture, and that browned them nicely, and kept them from being greasy.

I made this recipe & added 1 tsp. minced garlic to the dough becuz' my family LOVES garlic... HUGE amount of biscuits & absolutely wonderful!!!  Thank you for submitting, now my bubby doesn't need to crave RL just for their biscuits (everything is just too overpriced!) and we'll save our "dough!"
Hint: no need to roll out & cut, just drop by tbs. full & they come out cute as ever!!!  Oh, also added 3 snipped, fresh chives to butter mixture, outstanding!

I feel o so alone, but did not care for these.  Made recipe as stated, first batch baked extra few minutes, turned out doughy, second batch baked almost 20 minutes and were doughy.  Very heavy, no "fluffy" to speak of, not very flavorful, even with garlic butter.  Sorry!

Use milk instead of water for a better turnout and a bit of garlic powder to the mix to help work the taste throughout.  Wonderful!

This is a GREAT recipe!  My family loved them.  I did take the advice of other reviewers and added some of the butter/seasonings blend to the biscuit batter.  I also added a little more cheese. Since I didn't have to add any extra ingredients and it was a really simple recipe it get high marks!

These are fantastic - I've been making them for years, and this recipe is just like that of a famous seafood restaurant for sure.  The only thing I do differently is use garlic butter that I purchase from my local grocery store (as opposed to making my own).  As well, as soon as I pull the biscuits from the oven, I take a toothpick and poke several holes in each of the biscuits so when I brush with the melted butter, some of the butter drips down into the biscusts - absolutely decadent!

Excellent clone of the original.  I usually make them with 4 to 5 ounces of Sharp Cheddar, and use 2/3 cup of buttermilk in place of 2/3 cup of the water.  Made them for a holiday party at work, and had to print off two copies of the recipe for co-workers.

Yum. I used 4 oz of cheddar cheese - we love cheese! I used my Pampered Chef melon baller / cookie scooper and this made 48 of these puppies!!!!!! Hello, I am not complaining though! For the topping I used 1/2 cup of melted butter, 1 tsp of dried parsley, 1/2 tsp of Italian Seasoning and 1/2 tsp of garlic powder. I tried it with 1/4 cup of butter and it wasn't enough for us as we are a cardiologists dream family; we love stuff drenched in butter! These are fast and easy, a 5 star just on those counts! Then you add in the yum factor and this is 10 stars!

My husband and I were very pleased with these biscuits! I actually made them in advance and refrigerated some of the dough for one day (8 biscuits) and froze the rest. The refrigerated ones cooked beautifully and tasted delicious! I'm trying some of the frozen ones tonight...I'm sure they'll be great too! To freeze them, I just dropped them on waxed paper coated with cooking spray to prevent sticking. Then wrap with plastic wrap and place in freezer for about 2 hours. After frozen, put biscuits in freezer storage bags and return to freezer. That way, you can make as many as you like! Thanks for a great recipe, Cookie!

Very easy and tasty.  I divided the seasoning and put half in the mix, and half in the butter and that seemed to solve some of the "too salty" complaints I read in the reviews.  I've never had the RL biscuits, but these are pretty good.  Nice change from a plain biscuit.  And they tasted great the next day reheated for 20 seconds in the microwave.  Thanks Cookie for sharing!

Made these tonight using the baking mix on this site, as I had no Bisquick. Not exactly Red Lobster's, but just as yummy. Probably would have been exactly like RL if I had had the proper ingredient!Thanks for sharing, Cookie.

These are wonderful! I'm lucky enough to get Bisquick here in the UK. Everytime I make these, I use different spices to mix into the butter, and then brush them over the biscuits! Excellent!
They also taste wonderful with Ranch Dressing! Makes a perfect dipper!

Yum!  Not to be cliche, but my hard-to-please husband took one bite and emphatically said, "These are good."  I put all the spices in the mix, including a pinch of basil and oregano.  They cooked in 10 minutes, but I had to bake them for 35 to get them to brown (and the bottoms weren't even close to being burnt!).  Next time I might try baking for 10 minutes, brushing with butter, then broiling for however long it takes to get them browned.

I read everyone's advice to add a litte bit more of the ingredients (cheese and seasonings), cook the biscuits longer, and to put back in the oven once brushed with ingredients and they turned out wonderful!

Great! Tastes just like the box mix of the Red Lobster biscuits. I added a bit more seasoning (more garlic powder and old bay spice) to the mix like others suggested and the flavour was spot on. Only thing was that it took almost twice as long of a cooking time for mine to become browned, which may have been because of their size.

Yummy as written.  Wished I had looked at other reviews before making.  When I make them next time, will substitute milk for the water and add the Old Bay Seasoning.  Definitely a keeper!

These are amazing!  I made a few changes based on the reviews - put in a full cup of cheese, and added 1 tsp garlic and 1/2 tsp onion powder to the batter.  I tried them with and without these additions and definitely felt adding to the batter gave it more flavor.  I also did 1/2 tsp parsley in the butter spread. After brushing on the butter, I put them back in the oven for a couple minutes and they were perfect!

My brother-in-law's best friend, a chef at a major corporation, started his culinary career as a chef at Red Lobster. He said the real secret to making the busicuts is using club soda for the liquid. Amazing results!

A couple of improvements make a big difference! I tried the first half of the recipe exactly as listed. They came out still almost perfectly round, left a little to be desired in the flavor department and were really dry. So with the second half of the batter I added a Tbsp of honey and an egg. The batter became really sticky instead of powdery and crumbly. Then I brushed some butter mixture on before I baked and then again after. They looked much more like RL's cheddar bay biscuits and the taste is much closer as well, also they weren't dry anymore. I'd say as listed they taste 65% like RL's and after the honey and egg they come in around 85%. I will test and tune until this is perfect but it is now good enough for company. Try it!

I also added the Old Bay seasoning in the dough and in the butter. Edit: wanting a breakfast sammy I did a freezer dive in search of an english muffin. Found a few of these instead. Defrosted, then toasted. Split and added some thinly sliced ham and a poached egg with a lil more cheese. OMG!

I can't compare them to Red Lobster's biscuits since I've never tried them but these were really good. The recipe instructs to brush the butter mixture after biscuits are done, and some reviewers suggest brushing them then bake them a bit more. I tried both ways and I liked the ones I brushed After they fully baked. You could taste the butter mixture more I found. Anyways, good recipe!

My favmily LOVED these after I added the missing Old Bay seasoning.  They cannot be Bay Biscuits with Old Bay.  These have become a requested favorite with family and friends.

Made these for my hubby who LOVES the ones from that famous seafood restaurant chain.  They came out wonderful, but as the other reviewers said, use more cheese.  I also used milk in place of water.

These are absolutely delicious!  I halved the recipe and dumped in what shredded cheese I had (don't know how much it was).  I used extra sharp white Vermont cheddar.  I also used buttermilk instead of water because I had just enough left to use up.  I also added a couple of dashes of Old Bay Seasoning but I'm not sure it made any difference in taste.  I used the topping as directed and these are yummy!  I will be making these again.

Really good!  I used the footnote: recipe for baking mix and it made it taste really good.  If you want more of a "spice" or "Seafood" taste add a little bit of old bay seasoning to mixture.

o great holy deliciousness, how did i miss this recipe for so long????  completely amazing and so close to red lobster's.  my only change was to use melted "i can't believe it's not butter" instead of real butter, in a pathetic attempt to lower the calories somewhat. this did not appear to affect the taste at all in my opinion.  i also didn't have shredded cheddar, but i did have slices, so i just broke them up into pieces.  i halved the recipe for my family of 4 to make 10 biscuits, thinking there'd be enough leftover for tomorrows dinner....not so.  they're ALL GONE!!!

As good as (and several family members insist these are even better than) the famous seafood restaurant.  I add a teaspoon of dried parsley to the baking mix (I use my own baking mix recipe), and increase the cheese to one full cup. And when they are done baking, after brushing with the seasoned butter, I pop them back in the oven for just a minute for a nice finish.

They turned out delicious!  I made some changes based on other reviews: doubled the cheese, used milk instead of water, added garlic powder, onion powder, and parsley to the baking mix, and baked for 10 minutes, brushed with the butter mix and put them back in the oven for 2 minutes.  VERY close to the restaurant ones.  I will definitely make these again.

I made this years ago. It is the same exact recipe. I still have it in my recipe box. They are very butter and good, especially compared to regular drop baking mix biscuits. I never thought they tasted just like Red Lobster's biscuits though. I believe this recipe originally came from a copy cat on-line recipe source. My only complaint was that no matter how much is added to them, they still have that boxed baking mix taste. I may try them again, with one of the recipes on here for baking mix, and compare the difference.

NOM NOM!! These taste just like the ones you get from a restaurant that sounds like Fred Yobster :0). I did a half batch, and personally prefer a smidge more garlic powder (like maybe one extra dash per biscuit). These will be gone before the night is over!

Excellent biscuits! I did have to change a few things because I didn't have cheddar chesse, I used four cheese blend. I also didn't have parsley so i used basil. I cut the recipe in half as I am cooking for two and we have some left over that were saving for tomorrow. I ate 3 with dinner (smothered pork chops and mashed potatoes!) 5 stars easily these are delicious!

These biscuits are sooooo good! Three ounces of cheese really didn't sound like enough to me, especially after reading some of the reviews, so I roughly doubled the cheese. It still wasn't quite enough for me, but that's easily fixed. I also used only garlic powder and Old Bay seasoning in the butter wash. I think next time I'll add the onion powder, but I don't really think these need more salt if you use Old Bay.

Delicious but you really have to beat the batter hard. I was a little too lazy and ended up with flat biscuits.

Yummm! Fast, easy, and delicious! They taste a lot like the ones at the seafood restaurant, but of course it's hard to get the exact same recipe they use. In my opinion, these are the closest anyone's ever gotten to those famous, sinfully tasty biscuits.

I substitued milk for water and to the batter mixture I added 2 tsp. garlic, 1/2 tsp. onion, and 1 tsp. parsley.  followed rest of directions the same and put melted butter mixture on and baked for 2 mins.  almost taste identical to resturant style still tweeking batter mixture may need more or less to your liking of those ingredients

The biscuits came out great!  Very similar to a famous seafood restaurant's version; however, it felt like something was missing.  I'm certain it was Old Bay Seasoning. Still very yummy despite it!

These were absolutely wonderful.  The only changes I made was to use reduced-fat Bisquick and I added a little garlic powder to the dough.  We were very impressed with these and I can't wait to make them again.  Thank you so much for the post!

Muah! These are delicious!! I'm a novice with baking (I know that sounds ridiculous, but the whole whisking task is just difficult for me) and I was able to make these so fast and everyone loved them!
I cut the recipe in half because it was only for about 4 people including myself. I yielded about 10, but a couple of them were pretty big scoops.
I followed this the almost to the tittle! I just forgot to add salt! I brushed it with the butter mixture before the oven and afterwards. 

Lastly, someone suggested to warm them up the day after (I did about 20 seconds per biscuit) and they are indeed a good breakfast snack.

I've tried a few of the recipes for cheddar garlic biscuits. Mainly to imitate the same biscuits that they make and sell at Red Lobster. This recipe comes the closest to the texture and taste that I have tried so far. Everybody normally loves these biscuits. I did change the garlic powder and garlic onion. Instead of those two ingredients I substituted that with minced garlic around 3 tablespoons and I did not add salt. For the topping I added a couple tablespoons of water, 1 teaspoon of old bay seasoning and 2 tablespoons of olive oil. It's a great recipe and I would recommend this to other cooks as well.

I love these - soft and easy.  I use Bisquick for the baking mix.  Instead of adding the parsley with the butter, I sprinkle it on top at the end as a type of garnish - it mixes with the butter on its own.  For a group under 10, I would recommend halving the recipe.

PERFECT!  This recipe along with some suggestions made the BEST biscuits!!  I only made half of a batch because I know they are addicting.  I put a clove of garlic in the batter and a small amount of garlic powder, onion powder and old bay seasoning.  I also added old bay to the butter mixture.  These were a huge hit!!  We will be making these again for sure!

I cannot stress how amazing these buiscuits are! I substitute the flour mixture with my own gluten free mix that I make and they come out perfect! Doesn't hurt to add a little extra cheese though :)

I screwed up and didn't read the directions closely enough and added the herbs to the bread. Just as I was about to add the salt to the dough I looked at the recipe again and saw what I did wrong.  That being said I didn't think it made a big difference.  My husband said it wasn't bad for buisquick which is a huge compliment.

Very tasty everyone enjoyed them.  I made the same changes most of the other reviews made.  Parsley, garlic, onion powder and 1/8 tsp old bay in mix as well as same amounts added to butter.  I had to keep an eye on them in the oven as I have been having problems with them burning on the bottom before they are done cooking in the middle.

I only gave this 4 stars because the original recipie does need a little tweeking but with the changes it is a 5 star recipie.  I did as others suggested and added garlic, onion powder and parsley into the baking mix and upped the amount of cheese to one cup.  I also did as another suggested and found the Old Bay Seasoning - I havent made these without it so I dont know what the difference would really be but I know with it they are AMAZING!!!!!  Just like the RL biscuits!    SOOOO SOOOO GOOD!  Thanks Cookie!

This recipe definitely needs TONS of more cheese than listed on the recipe. 3 ounces to 4 C of flour just doesn't do it for me and my husband.

Tasty and easy.  DH made these while I made Hungarian Mushroom Soup and he said they were really simple to make.  The in-laws really liked them, too, so this is a definite crowd pleaser.  This is a keeper.

No, No, No...this is the first time that allrecipe ratings have let me down. This recipe is NOT the right copykat and it doesn't taste like the real things. I am just lucky I had enough ingredients to make new biscuits before me guests arrived!

This recipe simply didn't work out for me.  I will surely raise the rating when I give this recipe a second go.

Not exactly what I hoped for.  I did follow the suggestions of other reviewers and they were all eaten up though.

These are very close to the biscuits at the "rouge crustacean"! They are delicious; my husband and I loved them. We did however add the 1/4 teaspoon of old bay seasoning suggested by Tricia M. These biscuits are amazing!!

These were very good. Not quite as light and fluffy as the restaurant version, but the taste was very close. I used 2 T garlic salt in the butter topping and added extra cheese into the biscuits as recommended and turned out great!

These are soooo good.  I have made them twice now.  The first time I followed the recipe exactly and I thought they were a little bland.  The second time I added a handful of cheddar cheese to the mix and a little of the garlic powder, onion powder, and parsley to the mix before I baked them.  I followed the baking instructions and brushed them with the butter mixture as directed and they were so much better.  Everyone loved them.  I will be making these a lot!

I didn't care for these to much. I thought they didn't really have any flavor. My husband liked them more but, I won't make again. Definately not Red Lobster tasting for me. :(

I thought they were very good.  I seasoned the biscuit mix with the same seasonings for the butter, plus I added a 1/4 tsp of Old Bay to each.  Oh, and used sharp cheddar cheese(double the amount).  I think maybe the original submitter's intentions were to season the biscuits, too, because the description under the recipe when you search for it says, "the additions of cheddar cheese, garlic, parsley, onion, and water" is the trick to turning bisquick into Cheddar Bay Biscuits.

Very good!  Like many others I added half (roughly) of the spices to the biscuits themselves, and added the other half to 1/2 stick of melted butter to brush over the top.  Took another reviewer's advice and added just a pinch of Old Bay.  Also, I didn't have a "small scoop" so I used a 1/3 cup measure; the biscuits were the perfect size.

Wasn't sure how to rate this one. If I would have stuck to the original recipe I think it would have been fine...but I didn't. Used some other people's comments and didn't like how they turned out. Added garlic and onion powder to my dough and they were way too overwhelming! Overall a good recipe...just stick to what it says!

I rated this 3 stars because of all the changes I had to make to the recipe.  First, I followed others' advice by putting spices (1 tsp. garlic, 1 tsp. parsley, 1 tsp. Old Bay seasoning) directly into the dry batter mix.  In putting the ingredients together, I kept the dry and wet separate until the last minute and prepared it following a different biscuit recipe: I had the baking mix and spices in a large bowl, then I cut the VERY CHILLED (not melted butter) into the baking mix.  Then I made a well in the center, and put into it the milk (not water) and cheese to form the dough, being careful not to overmix but doing it as quick as I can so it wouldn't toughen.  Then I put it into a preheated 425 degree oven and had to keep it there for about 15-20 minutes, after which I brushed them with the butter and herbs.  I've made this twice, once following the recipe and then trying it with these changes and they come out MUCH better with the changes (flakier, lighter, more moist and flavorful).  Again, the taste is awesome, I just rated it low for all the changes!

This recipe gave me about 45 nice-sized biscuits.  I added about 2 tsp granulated garlic, 1/2 tsp onion powder to the biscuit dough and added at least that much again to the butter, along with several shakes of Tabasco.  Like others mentioned, I put these back in the oven after basting with the butter mixture.  They took longer to cook than indicated but that may be because I had 2 cookie sheets in the oven and so many on each.  Next time, realizing it will make more, I will cook them in batches.  Thanks for sharing!

This was such an easy recipe to follow and the biscuits tasted exactly like the ones at "that seafood restaurant".  Next time I will make enough so everyone can have 2 or 3.  I have also found that using a muffin pan gives me evenly sized biscuits; just give each cup a quick shot of cooking spray and the finished biscuits come right out.

I am giving this four stars because you HAVE to add Old Bay to the dough as well as the butter to get the Red Lobster taste.  I added that plus some garlic/parsley to the dough, then Old Bay to the butter and salted the tops again after I brush the butter mixture on.  Don't over mix or overbake and add the Old Bay and you will have evil, melt in your mouth decadent biscuits!  I loved how easy this was to pull together.

Great biscuits, but I did modify the recipe slightly.  I used whole milk in place of the water and added about 1 tsp. of garlic salt into the biscuit mix.  Used a large cookie scoop to keep the biscuits all the same size on the pan.  Served with 'My Best Clam Chowder' from this site and they were the hit of the party.

These were pretty good. I did make a few changes. I added a little extra cheese and Swanson's roasted garlic chicken broth in place of the water. I also brushed the biscuits with the butter mixture and put back in the oven a few minutes. When I took them out of the oven, I brushed them with the butter again and sprinkled extra garlic powder and salt on the top. This one will go in my recipe box! Thanks!

I halved the recipe and I made 9 medium sized biscuits.  I did add about 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder to the batter which I think I should have added more to give more flavor to the inside.  Also, I think they need a bit more garlic and onion powders brushed on top to really taste like the restaurant chain.  I followed the advice of others and popped them back in the oven after brushing with butter mixture.  Over all, they had to have been good because I ate 3!

These came out awesome. They really tasted just like Red Lobster's. I mixed half of the butter/spice mixture in with the dough, and I think that really helped. You'd have too much otherwise. Thank you so much... this is a recipe that I will be making again and again!

These were really tasty. I used a multigrain baking mix, a soy cheese blend and instead of butter I used smart beat spread flavored up with some Butter Buds. Very fast and way too tasty!  Thanks.

These were so yummy.  If you like the biscuits at Red Lobster, but don't like paying for overpriced, overcooked, previously frozen fish, then you'll love this recipe.

I made the biscuits with milk instead of water, added a dash of garlic to the dough mixture.  The topping is fantastic.  My husband really loves these biscuits.

I wouldnt exactly say that they taste like Red Lobster biscuits but they are pretty close. I didnt really get the taste on the out side as much as i wanted, but it was still good.

My husband and in-laws loved these.  I thought they were pretty good as well.  
Not quite like R.L.'s, but very close!

Yum these are great.  I like to put parsley and garlic in the actual mix as well as extra cheese.  Also, when putting the butter topping, I take the biscuits out a little early to poke holes so some of the butter can drip inside, then let them finish baking (and put more topping at the end).  Not like Red Lobster's imo, but great nonetheless!

So good! My husband liked these too. I did a half-batch, and just shredded a LOT of cheese into the bowl (probably close to 3/4 cup of cheddar to the two cups of baking mix). I also added a little Italian seasoning and garlic powder to the dough. For the topping, the amount called for (even halved for a half-batch) is too much. I had some leftover. The next time I made them, I cut the butter amount in half and that was plenty. I used garlic salt (omitted garlic powder and salt), and I used Italian seasoning again. I think you could add some Parmesan cheese for a different flavor. Thanks, Cookie, these are great. :)

I loved these biscuits!  My husband told me they were absolutely outstanding-I added a little seasoning to the biscuit mix prior to baking, but I don't even think they needed it.  Great, simple recipe! I have also made these using low-fat Bisquick....don't do it.  The consistancy is not the same as the regular!

Great. Just like Red Lobsters'! Chewy and cheesy. I used the Easy Biscuit mix recipe on this site instead of Bisquick.

These were great!  I added the garlic, parsley and onion powder seasonings to the biscut batter and added a little more garlic and parsley to the butter topping and they were a big hit!  I also added extra cheese due to my family's personal tastes.  Great and easy recipe!

These are not so great.  I used this recipe as a base using 1 cup of milk and 1/3 cup of melted butter in place of the water.  Also, I mixed the seasonings in with the baking mix and used about 1 1/2 cups of sharp cheddar cheese, then just brushed with more melted butter when done.  They were much more flavorful this way.

These biscuits are awesome!!I made them with fried chicken and my boyfriend loved them.I used the easy biscuit mixture also on this website. I listened to other reviewers and did not use garlic salt...I used garlic powder and added salt to our taste. I also put the butter mixture on before and after baking..YUM YUM!!

Good. Not exactly like the restaurant ones. I recommend adding the spices into the biscuit batter as well. Next time I might try and spice it up. I'll definitely make them again.

Very Tasty!  However, I don't know how to get the tops to turn golden brown. I used 4 oz instead of 3 oz of cheese and added garlic, onion powder to the biscuit mix.  Yum!

It is hard to mess this recipe up, so I love it. You can sub cheese type and different seasonings and still get a really great dinner biscuit. Definitely more affordable than paying $3 for a little bay biscuit box mix. Staple recipe for me.

This is a simple delicious recipe. Easy to make. I used bisquick instead of self-rising flour. I added the old bay seasoning to the dry mixture. I also used half milk and half water for the liquid. I melted the butter in the milk and water in the microwave. 
Easy peasy!! Will make again!

I made these according to the recipe directions and they were delicious.  The 1 1/3 cups of water was a little too much for the 4 cups of biscuit mix and I had to sprinkle in some extra mix to make the dough stop being sticky and turn soft and pliable.  I would recommend changing the recipe to say add water until the dough forms.  I would also go so far as to make extra garlic butter for dipping the biscuits, because it was so good.

I added a dash of old bay seasoning, garlic powder, and onion powder to the dough mixture. Once they were done baking, I put the buttery mixture on top then put them back in the oven for 1 minute and it was amazing!! Tasted just like Red Lobster biscuits!!!

Made as directed but would like to try with milk or buttermilk. My girls liked them. We crumbled them in our creamy chicken chili.

Too many reviewers suggested the same modifications so that's how I made the biscuits.  Added Old Bay Seasoning, added all spices to both batter and butter, and baked an additional 2 minutes after bushing butter on top.   My family began the compliments just from the aroma of the oven, then gobbled them up.

Really great biscuits (or scones as we call them) . Made a half batch and my wife and I polished them off by ourselves. The second batch (the next day) we reduced the garlic powder and the cheese tast really came through. Quick, simple and fantastic

I have made this recipe twice now and both times it was inedible. I followed it exactly and  it seems like I have way to much flour or too little milk. I am feeling frustrated but the other reviews have me holding onto hope and I will keep trying.

Best I have ever baked.  Well, first I tried it with self rising flour; not a great idea.  Picked up the biscuit mix and they were amazing; so good I actually said something like whoa, I did this.  I made my own Old Bay seasoning from this website.  Love this a bunch.

As written I'd give these a three.  I followed several reviewers' suggestions and added Old Bay to the mix, as well as adding the seasonings not only to the butter but also to the biscuit mix and using milk instead of water.  Most of that did vastly improve on the initial recipe, though please do yourself a favor and don't add the Old Bay.  These also really need more cheese- I weighed out the shredded cheese and it didn't seem like enough to me, but I didn't notice many mentions of that in the previous reviews so I didn't add more.  I should have.  For a full batch of these biscuits I would have added 2 full cups of sharp cheddar cheese to the biscuit mix and another 1/2 to 3/4 cup sprinkled over the top before baking.

Super easy!  Needed more salt, but we love our salt.  Don't be shy, generously brush with butter mixture.  Otherwise a little dry.  Excellent and easy!  I should have read reviews first to see what tweaks people suggested, but that just means I get to make them again!

5.29.16   As suggested by many reviewers, I did add some Old Bay® seasoning to both the biscuit dough and the butter, otherwise, followed the recipe to the letter.  I don't recall ever eating at that seafood restaurant, so I don't know if these measure up.  Although these biscuits had good flavor, I found them a little dry and doughy, dense/heavy in texture.  Guess I'm just used to fluffy and light Southern biscuits.

I tried recipe and for some reason they were not as good as original.  I called my local Red Lobster and tried to get recipe from them.  They suggested that I can just get some as a take-out order,  I paid $1.99 for 1/2 dozen biscuits. They come in a bag with heating instructions.  I only used 2 and froze the rest.  Frozen ones tasted just like fresh when I reheated them.  I know this is a lazy way out but the $1.99 price tag can't be beat. It cost me a lot more to buy the ingredients to make them from scratch.

I added a bit of Old Bay seasoning to both the dough and the melted butter, and these were addictive and perfect, just like the "real" ones!

I was trying to multitask and added the butter to the mix along with the seasonings.  I added about 1/4 tsp. of Old Bay Seasoning to the batter as well.  They turned out great! I used buttermilk but since I added the melted butter by mistake, I didn't use about the last 1/4 c of buttermilk.  They were perfect!   I might try cutting down on the butter in the mix next time,  just to save a few calories, but will definitely add it to the mix.  I did spread a little melted butter on the tops when they came out of the oven.  So good!

Given the ratings of others, I expected more and was disappointed. Good, not great. I did get compliments from others. It wasn't worth the effort for Thanksgiving with so many other good foods. I likely won't make these again.

These were fantastic.  I did add garlic, onion powder and parsley to batter (just a little).  I also brushed with the butter mixture halfway through baking and again at the end.  I was going to add a pinch of Old Bay, as suggested, but I forgot.  Loved these biscuits.

Love these with any pasta bake!
Pretty perfect just the way the recipe is. I half everything since it makes a lot.
Sometimes I'll put some Old Bay Seasoning right into the dough mix and sometimes I leave recipe just as it is. You really can't go wrong.

These taste like the ones in the restaurant. I've made them a few times now, but for whatever the reason, they don't puff up for me they stay sorta flattened. i'll keep trying, though.

I did NOT find these yummy as so many others did. I followed the recipe (but added extra cheese as so many others did).  Very disappointed.

Pretty darn close! I did as others suggested and added garlic n onion into the batter and I used more cheese. I also drizzled the butter mix on them with 2 min left and popped them back in. Totally making these over n over!

Delicious. The only changes I made were to add Old Bay seasoning to the batter and the butter and to use milk instead of water for the batter, per other reviewers' suggestions. My husband prefers from-scratch biscuit dough but said that this recipe was "good if it's easier to make" than my usual recipe.

Good recipe, I made it as stated, except I added 4 tbsp buttermilk powder since the other reviews suggested using milk. I used old bay in the melted butter topping instead of the spices. It does get dry when the biscuits are cold, but if you heat them up they are yummiest again!

Hubby liked these. I took some other reviewers' advice and used milk instead of water.  I mixed in the parsley, onion powder, and added some celery salt, a dash of nutmeg, garlic powder.  I didn't put any butter on top.  (I was trying to make "Old Bay" as we don't have this in our grocery store).  These were nice with the cheese and spices.

Loved these biscuits!  I did as others suggested and increased the cheddar shreds to 1 cup and added 1/4 tsp. Old Bay Seasoning to the butter mixture.  I also put them back in the oven for a minute after brushing with the butter as per one of the suggestions that I read and they were perfect.  My first time baking biscuits from scratch, but so easy that it won't be the last!

Sinfully delicious!  I used a full 20oz box of Bisquick for a total of 35 rolls.  Fantastic as-is, but if you have Old Bay Seasoning go ahead and add some for a perfect knock-off.

I made these with the suggestions of other reviewers--added garlic and onion powder to the batter with some pepper; used milk instead of water; you definitely do not need a full stick of butter for the topping--1/3 should be fine. got a lot of compliments on these!

1st time – used buttermilk instead of water (reviewer suggestion), shredded cheese myself (think store bought fine shredded would have worked better) they had to bake 14 minutes and maybe would have been better a few more minutes baking as biscuits were heavy (maybe the buttermilk). Called for a little too much butter, next time will cut by 25%. With left over butter I scooped up on my personal biscuit. I will play with this again.

Great Recipe, I added the suggested parsley to the mix and also the Old Bay Seasoning with garlic and herbs.  Seems pretty darn close to the lobster place.

So yummy! These are very close to the Red Lobster Biscuits that my family loves so much-- though they were more tender and moist than the restaurant's. They are SO easy to make, and so delicious. As a note though: they don't brown hardly at all, so you'll want to rip one in half at the 10 minute mark and decide from there. I left mine in for 12 minutes and they were perfect.

I just finished these biscuits. I followed the recipe except i used gf Bisquick. They were good, but not as fluffy and airy as Sw. Truck cheddar herb biscuits. I would make these again with Bob mill instead..

Excellent recipe! I used 32 ounces of Bisquick and a pint of half & half instead of water. And because my garden is flush with chives, I threw in a good amount of those, too. I baked mine for 10 minutes, brushed with butter, then baked for another 4 min. Also, because I used salted butter to brush them, I skipped the extra salt. So good!!

These were delicious! I've never eaten at the seafood restaurant but my sister had and assured me they tasted just like theirs. I used a very full cup of cheese instead of only 3 ounces and milk instead of water. It also only needed about 4 tablespoons of butter to be enough to coat the biscuits.

My mom absolutely adores these biscuits. However, it was annoying that I had to go out and buy the mix. The recipe is pretty good but doesn't compare to the actual Red Lobster Biscuits. I suggest halving the amount of butter in the glaze.

These taste very good, and were a real hit when my yeast failed and my bread didn't rise on Easter and I needed a quick fix.  I only gave them 4 stars because they left my stomach feeling uncomfortable, I think probably because they ended up being pretty high fat with the cheese and melted butter.  But if the fat doesn't phase you, they are definitely worth a try.  I ended up making them with by accident with skim milkinstead of water, and it worked just fine.

These were OK.  Not sure what the bay in the title was to mean, but I added Old Bay as others suggested and I think it was a great addition.  With bay in the title, it would make sense for the recipe to include Old Bay seasoning.  Good combo with cheddar.  I think putting the garlic and onion in the biscuit dough would make them taste better than brushing on top.  Made the tops a bit too salty and the seasoning was a bit powerful.  These turned out just OK to us.

These turned out delicious and do taste a lot like that "famous seafood restaurant."  This will definately be my go-to biscuit recipe as they will go with so many different main dishes.  I usually halve the recipe when I make it for my family of four.

Love these. Made them for my friends kids and they were a hit (fighting over the last one). I doubled the cheese and added garlic and chopped green onions to the dough, used buttermilk instead of water, and added extra garlic salt to the butter mixture. Thanks!

These were just ok. Everyone ate them and no one complained but they just weren't the same as the restaurant. Seems like the only thing that saved them was the butter topping. I might make them again and try to spice up things a little bit.

These tasted very much like Red Lobster's biscuits, only they turned out pretty dry and dense.  I also thought they needed a bit more cheese or maybe I shredded it too finely.  We will make these again, but try adding more liquid.

I've tried to approximate those famous biscuits more than once over the years and this recipe finally helped me nail it.  I didn't have any Old Bay on hand, so I subbed in Lawry's instead of plain salt.  Perfect seasoning mix, fantastic reviews from the family.

I didn't use baking mix so used a recipe for "best cheddar biscuits" from Company's Coming Muffins & More cookbook which are great. I made the butter mixture from this recipe and brushed it on afterwards. While they were good I think the real ones actually have some seasoning in the biscuit itself. I would also add a little more garlic next time to the butter mixture.

Great recipe.  Next time I will add a bit more cheese (I love cheese) and make the biscuits smaller so they cook a bit more in the center.

Perfect delicious biscuits, and so easy to make! Just like the food chain too. My family loved them, and I followed the other reviewer's advice of adding spices to the batter, Old Bay Seasoning to the butter, and leaving out the salt. Definitely going to make again :)

I was hoping for a copycat of Red Lobster's biscuits, but there was something missing. Overall, very easy and good, just not quite as tasty as the ones at RL.

I made these last night.  I didn't have the garlic/onion powders or the parsley, so I used a garlic herb blend.  I ended up with 12 huge biscuits rather than 20 normal sized ones.  These were totally delicious, super easy to make, and a complete repeat!  Family loved them!

These were delicious and surprisingly easy to make! I reduced the garlic powder in the butter topping to 1 tsp. instead of 2 because I didn't want them to get too garlic-y. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. I think that the cheddar bay biscuits at Red Lobster are still the best, but these are definitely a nice homemade alternative!

I am so glad I found this recipe! My husband is always talking about how much he loves the ones from the seafood restaurant, so I absolutely had to try this as soon as I read it. He loved them, and brought some to his mom and brother and they were a hit! I followed the recipe exactly, and will make these again. Next time though, I will probably use more cheese and a little less garlic. Thank you so much!

These were so simple that I really didn't expect much from them, but I had busquick to use up and no milk, so I thought what the heck. Boy am I glad I gave them a try, they were delicious. My husband absolutely loved them too and he is a very picky eater, especially when it comes to breads. Definitely a keeper!

These are so good!  The only change I made was to double the amount of cheese.  I also used Clubhouse Garlic Seasoning Plus instead of garlic powder.  These freeze excellent.  Thanks for the recipe.

I used buttermilk instead of water, but other than that, it was the same.  Pretty good.  I think sour cream would make them more moist.

Very good :) delicious and cheesy. I did add some dried parsley to the dough and to the butter for color. Also, added some onion/garlic/old bay to the dough. And all it is is cheese and bisquick!? I will make these every day! :D Thanks cookie!

These biscuits are so addicting and so easy to make.
I used colbyjack cheese (all I had on hand), but I don't feel it made a big difference. I too added fresh garlic and a dash of old bay to the batter. I also added old bay in place of the salt to butter mixture. So good, thanks for posting!

These were really good. However, I followed some suggestions from other reviews and added some garlic powder to the dough and we thought it was too garlicky. Next time I make them I will just leave the garlic powder out of the dough and just put on top like the recipe suggests.

These were great! I cut halfed the recipe and added a little garlic powder in the dough. I used about a half cup of cheese. And I used dried Italian seasoning for the tops because that's what I had. We all loved these.

These were awesome. I halved the batch and still had 3 sandwich baggies of leftovers, but man were the leftovers wonderful! I agree with earlier reviewers and added half of the spices to the dough. In the future I think I will add all the seasoning to the dough and just brush with butter when they come out. Also, I used McCormick cajun seasoning instead of Old Bay, seemed to give it a bit more flavor. Overall, wonderful!

This is a great recipe. As soon as i ate one i had flashbacks to eating one at Red Lobster, except mine tasted better. The one thing I did differently was add more flavor into the batter by putting some of the butter/herb(seasoning) into the batter. I also used less cheese but in the end it was amazing.

Loved these biscuits and they are so easy and quick!
I substituted milk for the water and used Tillamook extra sharp cheddar for the cheese. I also put some of the seasonings in the biscuit dough, as other reviewers did and put them back in the oven for 1 minute after brushing the butter mixture on them.
Very addictive!

These were super easy, made with all common ingredients in my home.  I made a half batch and the only changes I made were to use milk instead of water and I added a shake of Old Bay to the batter.  Oh, and I doubled the parsley because there was barely any in the original recipe once I halved it.  The butter topping smells very garlic-y when you are putting it on, but the end result is just fine.  I poked the tops several times with a toothpick, in hopes that the butter would seep in.  But the biscuits were still a little dry, so I will try to find a way to fix that for next time.  That said, my 17 year old son still went nuts for these.  Quick, easy and very tasty - thanks!!  We'll definitely be making these more.

These are great with additions.  I used more cheese, seasoned salt and garlic powder in the biscuit mix for more flavor and a dash of cayenne pepper in the butter mixture.  Mine took way longer to bake than 12 minutes.  They tasted great and none were left.

The only flaw that I found was it wasn't flavorful enough so I put the butter mixture in the dough instead of brushing it on top and it was much more flavorful. All in all a great recipe.

delicious! add some garlic on the inside and it makes it even tastier. I like adding some fresh minced garlic on the top instead of garlic powder as well. Wonderful!

Pretty close to RL biscuits!  Like other reviewers, I put a little garlic (minced) and onion powder into the mix before baking.  I used about 1 cup sharp cheddar cheese shredded.  Turned out great!   Will be making these again.

These are really awesome! I made these to take to a friend's for dinner, and they disappeared! I took advice from other reviewers and added a few dashes of each spice (I just eyeballed it) to the dough, and then also poked holes in the tops of the biscuits before brushing on the butter mixture. I also added at least twice as much cheddar cheese!  I don't like crispy biscuits, so I pulled them after about 8 minutes. They were perfect!

I made these biscuits for thanksgiving and they were finished the same day! I did follow the recipe as is except I did add a dash of old bay seasoning to the batter and 1/4 teaspoon to the butter mixture as someone else mentioned. Overall a great recipe and very yummy!

YummYY and STUPID-EASY!!!  My kids asked me if I had called this certain restaurant and asked for their recipe!  Add some Old Bay seasoning to the baking mix -wisk it together with the cheese, then add the water.  I made the mistake of adding the water first and then realized I needed to shred the cheese still.  By the time I added the Old Bay and cheese, the gluten and proteins were turning the dough into a rubber-like glob.  Still turned out awesome, but made it harder on myself than necessary.  Added a few dashes of Old Bay to butter mixture and brushed it on before and after baking.

These were very good! My dad ate 6 and really wanted more. I used fresh parsley instead of dried, and I think that turned out well. I might also consider adding some of the spices/herbs to the batter next time, but they were fine without it.

These were great!  As close as I've come to the real thing, tastes best when warm.  They did not last long at all at my house and although everyone was full from dinner people kept wanting to grab another biscuit.

So delicious. I used the 'Old Bay Seasoning' that I found at Publix down here in Fl in the biscuit mix and on the topping as others suggested. I didn't double the cheese, but I will next time. Absolutely delicious! This recipe makes 20 large biscuits, or 30 smaller, had a lot left over.

Ive been making these for years! Everyone who has tried them, loves them. I usually do add a little extra cheese. After I pull them out of the oven, I take a toothpick & poke a few holes in the tops of each biscuit, then brush them with the butter mixture so a little of that buttery goodness seeps into the biscuit:) I also sprinkle a tiny bit of black pepper on each one.

Easy to make, not a big fan of boxed biscuit dough texture however.  I also added some garlic and onion powder to the dough, but could have used more flavour.  I may try some of the commentd on seasonings in another dough recipe.

Great taste and very easy. I added measures of spices to the dough and after brushing the biscuits with the butter mixture, I topped with a little more shredded cheddar and baked two more minutes.

I doubled the cheese and added the same seasoning o the batter as I did the butter. Tasty biscuits but still not phenomenally cheesy.

I have never made a better biscuit!!! And - they looked exactly like the picture.  My teenagers ate the leftovers for breakfast the next day.  The second time I made them I put the Old Bay seasoning in the butter and it was even better.  A new family favorite.....thank you so much

These were absolutely spectacular.  I added the Old Bay Seasoning, as reccommended, and put a little more salt and garlic powder.  I have shared this recipe with a bunch of friends, and will be making it often :) Thanks!

They were very yummy. I used way more seasoning, and will add more next time. I love the flavor, I added 1 cup of cheese and I think I will add more of that next time to. I did add some of the old bay seasoning like suggested. Will make again, very simple.

Only giving a 3 beause I changed the recipe based on other reviews.  Added 1/2 tsp garlic powder, onion powder, parsley, Old Bay Seasoning in the batter.  Also used milk instead of water  and increased cheese to 1 1/2 cup.  Everyone loved them for my New Years Party, some even preferred to RL's!  Very easy and will make again.

Yum, yum.  Used milk instead of water for the biscuits and as per others recommendations added 1/2 TSP of Old Bay seasoning.  Turned out GREAT!

I made these for a Christmas party and they were a huge hit! I added the spices to the batter as well as the butter topping as mentioned in other reviews. I replaced the water with milk. I doubled the amount of cheese called for in the recipe, and found that it still could have used a little more. I'd recommend about 1 1/2 cups of cheese to make these truly cheesy. I added a dash of Old Bay to the batter, and next time I'll add a little more. Put the butter on after baking for 10 minutes, then pop them back into the oven for 2 minutes for a perfect yummy biscuit!

First, these are the easiest biscuits I have ever made.  No rolling or cutting them out, just plop them on the pan and bake.  I made them for Thanksgiving and they were wonderful.  Actually, I made them the night before and my husband and I ate so many, they almost didn't make it to Thanksgiving!

These were alright.  Not quite as good as the Red Lobster biscuits, but fairly close.  I didn’t use parchment paper (because I was out), so I greased the baking sheet with cooking spray, and it was just fine.  After reading other reviews, I brushed the butter mixture over the biscuits after about 7 minutes, then put them back in the oven to cook for another 4-5 minutes.  It was a good decision.  They came out very nice.  I will make them again, but next time I will put some of the parsley and garlic powder in the batter itself.

Made this tonight with some soup and my boyfriend and I absolutely loved it! Fabulous recipe!  I added a bit more cheese than called for and I only baked half of the mixture, since it was just me and my significant other, and I put the rest in the fridge for later. Ended up having a lot of garlic butter left over, so I used it as a dipping sauce, which was even BETTER! It made the biscuits melt in the mouth.   I'll definitely will be making this recipe again. Most likely when I have a large social gathering since there will be plenty. :D

I made these biscuits for dinner and they were good.  I read some of the other reviews and change it a little.  I used 3 cups baking mix, 1/4 tsp onion and garlic powder and 1/4 tsp old bay season and 1 cup shredded cheese and 1 cup milk.  I also had parsley flake to the mixture. Very good next time i'll had more cheese. and brush w/more butter.

Yummy! I gave the recipe four stars because I think it needed a few additions to really punch up the flavor. I added garlic powder, fresh parsley and green onions to the batter. I also used fresh parsley in the melted butter and brushed it on before the biscuits were all the way done and then again after they came out of the oven. I think next time I will add some Old Bay as well. MMMMMMMMMMMMM......

These biscuits were good, but not awesome. I cut down the amount of butter to 5 tbs. and I still had extra. The biscuits were also pretty salty, and very crumbly. I did find an easy way to shape these, though. The dough was sticky, like a cookie dough, so I used my large cookies scoop to easily make small, uniform, round biscuits. This worked so well that I'm always going to use my cookie scoop for drop biscuits from now on! Thanks for sharing!

These were quick, easy and tasted great.  Baked until firm but not brown yet, removed biscuits from the oven and brushed the butter/seasoning mixture on top then returned the biscuits to the oven to brown.  I also made corn on the cobb for dinner and used the left over melted butter/seasoning to coat the corn after boiling - WOW! made the corn out of this world!

I had to make a couple minor changes because of what I didn't have available - I baked on a silicone baking sheet on top of my cookie sheet (didn't have parchment paper) and I replaced the onion powder with Tastefully Simple's "Onion Onion" seasoning (didn't have onion powder). Otherwise I followed recipe exactly and really, really like these!! So quick and easy and super tasty, the way that butter blend soaks into the crusty top of the biscuits is AWESOME! I do think next time I'll add a little seasoning to the biscuit dough too, before baking to give it a little extra flavor, but I really like these as they are!

This was amazing! I added more cheese (like some reviewer had suggested) and used fresh parsley (since I already had some chopped up). I also think the key to this recipe is to flavor the batter more. Somebody recommended to add some garlic, onion, and parsley to the batter in addition to adding it to the melted butter. It really helped to make the biscuits that much more incredible. Thank you SO much for this recipe (and the reviews) as these have always been my favorite biscuits and can now be made at home. :)

These were good, however I found the actual biscuit a bit bland. The melted butter topping was good, and I added some Old Bay seasoning. Next time I will add the seasoning to the mix as other reviewers have suggested.

I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and added a dash of Old Bay seasoning to the batter and 1/4 tsp to the butter mixture.  I also used extra sharp white cheddar cheese.  Excellent! I'd say they were even better than that seafood chain's biscuits!

These were really really good. They're not exactly like RL BUT they're REALLY close. I made a few changes, I added the garlic, onion, & parsley mixture to the dough & then melted the butter & added the same amount of garlic, onion, & parsley mixture to the butter & brushed on top. Also, I halved the recipe to 10 servings. I used about a cup of shredded cheese. Also, one of the key parts to using Bisquick is to stir the mixture as little a possible, just enough to combine the ingredients. This recipe is definitely a keeper, I can't wait to make these again!

OMG these are PERFECT just the way the recipe reads!  I don't really care for Red Lobster's bisquits that well but absolutely looooooved these.  DH was oohing and aaahing over them too.  Had them tonight with the ham/potato soup on this site.  Who would believe perfection so easy!!   Thank you so much for sharing.

I've never eaten at Red Lobster so I don't know what these biscuits are "supposed" to taste like, but these are delicious!  In the dough mixture, I added 1 t. garlic powder, 1/4 t. onion powder, 1/2 t. dried parsley, and doubled the cheese.  I also added 1/4 t. of Old Bay into the melted butter.  To die for!

Key to this recipe is Old Bay seasoning with Garlic powder and melted butter over the tops of the baked biscuits. I've also made my own baking mix, since I was out of Bisquick.

These were very good.  I have never had RL biscuits, so I have nothing to compare them to.  I did add 1 teaspoon of minced garlic and a few shakes of Old Bay to the dough.  The biscuits were very easy and well-received.

Good recipe.  The biscuits really do taste like the ones at Red Lobster, only better because they're fresh out of the oven!  Added a few shakes of Old Bay to the baking mix and 1/4tsp. to the butter mix.  The flavor was good, a little salty so I may reduce the salt a little next time.  I will also cut the recipe in half.  I ended up throwing out half of the dough because we just didn't need that much for dinner.

The base recipe is very good. I followed some of the suggestions from other reviewers: about 1/2 c. cheddar, added some garlic and onion powder to the batter, doubled parsley in the powder and only used a few dashes of salt. In the first batch, I made them too big and they took about 17 minutes. I suggest using only a 'small' heaping tablespoon for each biscuit. Next time, I think I'll add more cheddar and seasonings to the batter. Overall, it's a good starting recipe.

These taste very similar to a famous seafood restaurant's cheesy biscuits. Very good recipe overall..the only small complaint is that they were quite dry. Next time I will add more of the garlic butter to the top!

omg these are amazing and easy to make.  I did follow several other reviews though when making them.  I added the parsley, garlic powder and the onion powder into the mix.  I also doubled the amount of cheese( i love cheese)  as well as i used half milk and half water.  As I also love garlic i added more to the melted butter mixture.  I used a heaping table spoon to make the biscuits, and as they were bigger then they were supposed to they did take longer to bake.  All i did was I kept and eye on then till they were golden brown.  YUMMY!!!!!!!!

YUMMY!  Like others suggested, I added onion powder and garlic powder to the biscuit dough.  Also, used just a couple of TBSP of butter for top and added minced garlic to the butter.  So good!

I was told these tasted just like Red Lobster.  I tripled the cheese, used milk instead of water and added most of the butter mixture to the biscuit mix before baking.  I used a cookie scoop to measure out the mix and still brushed the tops with the remaining butter when they were done. Sadly, I didn't get one of these before they were gone :( I guess that was a good indication they were excellent, lol.

Fantastic recipe. I took these to a BBQ and they were gone in minutes! Only change I made to the orginal, was to up the amount of cheese to 1 Cup ( as another reveiwer suggested) and subbed milk in place of the water, also added a few additional splashes of the milk, as i wasn't happy with the consistency of the dough, with the original amount of liquid. Though even with the changes i made, i'm sure this recipe is great as written! Try it, it's easy and good!

Awesome!  Just like the ones at the restaurant!  I took the advice of the other reviews & added the garlic, onion & parsley into the mix as well as into the butter & put back into the oven after brushing with butter.  Now my husband makes arguments every now how the cheddar bay biscuits would make the perfect side to whatever we are having that night!

Followed the recipe. These weren't anything spectacular. I'll use the recipe again but add more cheese and seasoning to the dough.

These biscuits are so good, especially considering how quick and easy they are. I subbed milk for the water as suggested, added extra cheese, and I didn't feel like measuring out the seasonings so I just sprinkled some in the batter and then in the butter. I halved the recipe and it still made more biscuits than I expected, but I didn't mind having some left over. Surprisingly, I liked them even better the next day after being microwaved for a few seconds! I will definitely make this again.

This is an awesome biscuit recipe- it has become a regular at our family's dinner table on any occasion.  Cook biscuits until they are crisp on top and a little browned, once you brush the butter mix on top it softens up a bit, but adds a little texture, and does not turn biscuits soggy.

I've never had a Bisquick biscuit recipe fail, but this one was particularly good and has been raved about by the people I served it to.  I did leave the salt out of the butter, though I would include it if I were using unsalted.  I also found a garlic powder-parsley blend in the spice aisle that worked really well.  Great recipe!

I followed the recipe (although I halved it), and they had little flavor and were dense like little bricks.

These are delicious! I followed Shannon's advice and altered this recipe as follows: used about 1c cheese, added 1 tsp of garlic, 1/3 tsp. onion powder and 1/2 tsp of dried parsley to the biscuit batter. I used specified amounts in butter mixture but added 1/2 tsp of additional parsley (and could probably even used more). I omitted the salt which wasn't missed at all. I also used baking spray rather than parchment paper. Fantastic! Will make many times again :-)

Wow. I followed the hints of some other users (used milk instead of water; mixed spices in to the dry mix; increased the amount of garlic, parsley) and they were AMAZING. HUGE family hit; going to make these every week from now on!

Really good.  After 12 minutes in the oven, I brushed on the butter mixture, then returned to the oven for another 4-5 minutes.  They came out golden brown with this additional time.

These turned out excellently.  I followed the recommendations of others and added the seasoning to both the dough and butter.  I also brushed butter on the biscuits immediately after they got out of the oven, only to return to the oven for a few minutes longer.  When I took them out of the oven I brushed more butter onto the biscuits.  Overall they were wonderful.  I intend on preparing them again in the future.

Per other suggestions I added some onion salt, garlic powder and parsley to the dough and I put in 1 cup of cheese and put a bit of cheese on top before putting them in the oven. They came out perfect. So easy and so great. Just like the restaurant.

I make these exactly as recipe reads although I don't measure the cheese and probably add more by sight.  This is one of our favorite sides to grilled steak.

Sooooo easy & yummers!  Prefect with some soup I made.  The batter was so easy to work with-- not sticky & it made up a large amount.  These will be a staple with soups & chilies.

These were kind of a disaster for me but I am still rating them 4 stars for taste as the disaster was my fault! First of all, I think I made them too big, I wasn't sure of the definition of a small scoop so they really puffed up and it took longer than 12 minutes for them to turn brown.  Second, I used my Pampered Chef baking stone, which was fine, but when I followed the advice of other reviewers to put the butter on and bake them for a few more minutes, the butter dripped off my baking stone and smoked up my oven!  Lastly, I put my biscuts too close together and some stuck to each other.  I followed the advice of others and put in extra cheese and seasonings into the dough (omitting salt) which was fine, but I think there was too much butter topping.  I tried to use it all and it made my biscuits soggy.  It really is a good recipe, but I will have to try it again and not be in such a hurry!  Thanks for the recipe.

I was making a small dinner for few people, so I halved everything in this recipe except the cheese. I got 11 biscuits so this scales really good. I also added garlic powder, black pepper and dried parsley to the biscuit mix.  This way, you have the garlic flavor throughout and not just on the topping. That makes these better than those at the lobster place. I baked mine on a baking/pizza stone and they just lifted right off! They taste even better on day two out of the microwave for 10 seconds.

I've tried numerous recipes on this site (and would give many 5 stars) but this is by far the best recipe I have tried to date!!!!  As suggested by others add old bay seasoning (garlic and herb worked for me) and substitute buttermilk for the water.  I did make two other adjustments as well: I cooked the biscuits at 400 degrees and reduced the salt by half (like others mentioned, the amount of butter is a bit excessive, you would probably need only about half of the butter mixture)

I think this deserves a 5, and will gladly give it that, but made one change of my own. I find the garlic powder adds a metallic taste and would make a paste of fresh garlic to incorporate.

These biscuits are so good and easy!  I usually add a little extra cheese.  I also sprinkle very lightly with garlic salt after brushing them with the butter mixture because I like the "crunch" of the salt on top.

I make this mix (without the wet ingredients) for Xmas gifts every year.  Put it in lined bags bought from Papermart.com and make labels with instructions on my computer. My friends love it, and insist that I make it every year.

I followed some of the suggestions in the reviews, and added extra cheese, and these were a hit. My cousin calls to see when I make these so he can come for dinner.

These biscuits are the absolute best!!!  The only change I made to the recipe was to take out the biscuits halfway through cooking and brush on the butter mixture as well as when they were finished.  It made them a little more moist, and definitely delicious!!

mmmmm... I haven't had the LJS or RL biscuits, but these are good regardless.  I halved the recipe, used unsalted real butter, cooked on sprayed foil in a toaster oven (about 15 min cooking time for me), and used cheddar jack.  Next time I'll try using Sharp Cheddar for more flavor, and I'd like to try others' suggestions with experimenting with italian seasonings.  Definately use Garlic POWDER, not garlic salt, else only use garlic salt (no reg. salt).  Yummy!

My husband and I could NOT BELIEVE that we were eating the Red Lobster biscuits in our own home!!! And they're SO easy!  I also added garlic powder to the dough for more oomph.  Other than that, the recipe as-is was perfect.  BRAVO!!!!

Wonderful.  Not quite Red Lobster's, these are a little drier.  I think some garlic powder in the biscuit themselves would be good.  Thanks a lot.  A definite keeper!

These biscuits are very close if not the same as at Red Lobster, my friends raved about them. According other reviews I added 1 teaspoon garlic powder to the dough and doubled it in the butter. After 8 min of baking I brushed them with half of the butter mixture, then returned to oven until they got golden brown and then brushed again with left butter after I pulled them out of oven. Delicious.

These were Okay.  Little to no flavor.  I made the batch as directed, and baked 2 to try it out.  Ended up adding a lot more cheese, minced fresh garlic, parsley and garlic powder and a touch of onion powder to the baking mix itself.  Melted butter, added more minced garlic and powders and parsley and brushed on top.  With so much garlic, it still wasnt STRONG.  Tasted much better after adding all the other stuff. On a few, i dusted them with cayenne.  We like spicy.

These are so good!  I added a little more cheese and needed to make more of the butter topping because I ran out.  My husband said these are the best biscuits he's ever had!  He is a very picky eater, so that's a great compliment!

Yes, these DO come out like the biscuits at Red Lobster. They're always a hit. I made them three ways: Using a boxed biscuit mix, using my own homemade biscuit recipe and also by using the recipe for biscuit mix on this site. They all tasted the same, but using the biscuit mix on this site was very helpful when I had to serve a huge crowd. Everyone always loves these biscuits.

Yep, these are the real deal.  They come out light & fluffy and oh so delicious!  I added substantially more cheese (since the name is not Hint of Cheddar Bay Biscuits) and these went over VERY well with friends and family for Easter dinner.  I'm doing dinner tomorrow for additional family members, so I'm thinkin' another batch is in order.  I wonder if these freeze well...

Very tasty! I used the "Easy Bisuit Mixture" o this site instead of Bisquick, and added some garlic powder, onion powder and parsley to the dry mixture...go light on the salt and garlic salt though!

I used to visit a particular seafood restaurant for their biscuits only.  NOT ANYMORE!!!  These biscuits are RIGHT ON.  I can never ever make enough, dinner guests always gobble them down and ask for more.  Thank you!!!

I halved the recipe but stayed with the original amount of cheese. I asked my family if they would suggest putting some of the spices into the batter rather than with the butter and they said no.  I like the suggestion to make the homemade Bisquick recipe on this site, instead of brand-name Bisquick--will give that a try next time I make these.  We thought these were pretty close to RL biscuits!

Very good.  Not the exact cheddar bay biscuits we all know and love, but VERY close!!  I make these quite often, and add a little butter, garlic powder, onion salt, and parsley to my batter.  It really kicks up the biscuit.  Naturally I still brush the melted mixture over them when they're finished baking.  Again, great recipe!  Thank you!!!

was debating b/t 3 and 4 stars...just a little on the gummy side for biscuits.  Maybe too much water?  Anyway, I messed up by adding the onion & garlic powder etc to the baking mix, instead of with the melted butter.  Still tasted fine though.

Easy and oh so tasty!  I just added 2 tsp of garlic salt to the melted butter...it was a little too salty, so next time I'll just do 1 tsp.  But they were still very good... everyone wanted more.

These are delicious!  I made a half-batch, and they were fantastic fresh out of the oven.  I will probably use more cheese next time, though - it was hard to taste.

These are addicting!  I bake the biscuits 12 minutes, coat them with the butter mixture, then put them back in the oven for a couple of minutes so they don't feel greasy on the outside.

I used extra cheese, 3 oz just didn't seem like very much for all that baking mix. I left out the salt and cut the garlic powder by half in the butter topping. These are good and satisfying.

These biscuits are fine, I suppose. However, I am quite relieved I decided to take the advice of a couple other reviewers in omitting the 1/4 tsp salt. If I decide to make the biscuits again, I will probably reduce the amount of garlic powder to 1/2 tsp, as the full 1 tsp I believe overpowers the taste of the cheese in this recipe. And I used 5 ounces of sharp cheddar cheese, 2 ounces more than is called for in this recipe, so the cheese flavour should be quite prominent. Also, I will reduce the amount of butter!!! 1/2 c far exceeds what is practical for 20 biscuits. I'm no health nut and thus do not object in principle to the use of 1/2 c butter, yet  I could not use even 2/3's of the butter mixture. The amount remaining sits covered in my fridge so I suppose I'll find some clever way to use it. And finally, as mentioned by others, the time required to bake these biscuits at 375 degrees fahrenheit will probably exceed 12 minutes. I baked these biscuits for 15 minutes to achieve  a very light golden brown.

These are awesome! My husband and son loved them. They are only good once they come out of the oven hot & fresh. Thanks for sharing. Will definitely be making again. The only complaint is...It does need more cheese and definitely use the SHARP cheddar cheese.

These biscuits were good, but no comparison to Red Lobsters. I think they needed more seasonings in the batter.

I wish I could give this recipe another star.  These biscuits were so flavorful--they just melt in your mouth.  And they are so EASY to make.  I didn't add the salt to the recipe because "bisquik" is already a little salty.  I also made my biscuits fairly large, about the size of a cue ball--it made 12.  They turned out perfect--really great when they are still warm.

I don't like the actual biscuit taste. But...when I do find a biscuit recipe I like...I'm going to add the cheddar to it...and brush the stuff on the top of it...then we'll have some good biscuits!! The only flavor in these...are the garlic/butter and cheese you add to it. And...I'm a bisquick lover...these just didn't hit home...but the seasonings did.

Wow!  Even after screwing up the recipe these were still fantastic.  I was doing too many things at once in the kitchen and poured 1 and a half cups of parmesan cheese into the mixture. (Which was supposed to go into the alfredo sauce I was making oopsie!)  Though I don't recommend doing this, they still were heavenly!  Can't wait to make them again correctly.  I may not be able to contain myself!

very good, but not quite as good as red lobster.  I always make extra garlic for the top b/c otherwise I feel there isn't enough.  My family gobbles these up quickly.

I slightly varied the recipe...since we like to put our own button on biscuits, I combined all the herbs/spices with the bisquick & cheddar.  It made about 2 dozen small sized biscuits.  I made homemade butter to spread on them, too.  These were a nice change from plain biscuits.

This is THE recipe, and it makes me so happy! Not to mention everyone who gets to eat them. I make mine a little bigger (cause I'm a major pig for these things), and just increase the bake time by a few minutes, until golden brown. And usually what I do, to serve my family of four, is cut the recipe in half and bake them in my toaster oven on the small baking sheet that came with it. That's an ideal way to reheat them, too, so they'll still have the same texture as when they were freshly baked. Thank you SO much, Cookie!

My first time making Biscuits and this is an excellent recipe; it will defiantly be my first choice when making biscuits.  I made these with the Ham, potato, and cheese soup from this website and they went well together. Thank you!

Very good replication. A little richer. I made this with milk also and added more cheddar. I also put the garlic and onion powders and parsley in the dough. After baking I brushed with melted butter with a dash more garlic and onion powder. Very delicious!

Wow, great.  I added some parsley to the dough and followed the suggestion for a second brushing just before serving.  They reheat so well in the microwave, just wrap in a very slighty damp paper towel.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Okay recipe, nothing special and only somewhat like Red lobster's.  Definitely need more cheddar cheese in this recipe, you really couldn't taste the cheese at all.  I followed the directions precisely, but I can't see why anyone would rave about these rather tasteless biscuits.  Wouldn't bother with this one.

Wow! I was looking for some redlobster type biscuits, and these are it (if not better!) I took them out a little early and they were nice and soft and cheesy and the topping really pulled all the flavor together. They were incredibly easy to make, too. I'm so surprised that something so easy to make turned out so good! My parents and boyfriend loved them, saying they tasted like red lobster's and my sister said they were even better. Will make again and again!

These were great with dinner and to snack and snack and snack on.  We just keep eating them anytime because they are sooo good.  I cut back just a little on the garlic and onion, it's not our favorite, but they are GOOOOD!

My family begs for these. I use my own homemade biscuit recipe, but I add all these seasonings and other ingredients. Exceptional flavor, and you can't beat the fragrance as they bake! Delicious when serving any type of seafood or fish. A savory winner!

I made these as a side dish to fried chicken.  It wasn't the healthiest meal, but boy was it good.  The biscuits were gobbled up and everyone commented how good they were.  They are also super-easy to make.

Great recipe!  I made them for the first time tonight with a pot of chili and they were enjoyed by all.  I cut them out with a biscuit cutter instead of spooning them out - worked fine.  Will definitely make again.

Pretty good, but still not what I'm looking for, it's just mising ... something, to make it taste like the restaurant ones. Dh didn't like them (and he eats them by the basket when we go out) and the kids wouldn't touch them.

I agree. Almost a dead-ringer for the biscuits served at The Red Lobster. In fact, a waiter once told me ,"They just Bisquick mixed with cheddar cheese and brushed with butter and garlic. Served these tasty morsels with Fish Chowder found at this site. Great meal. P.S. I added lots more Old Bay Seasoning and a cup of salad size shrimp.

Everybody loved them, but they were a little too salty... probably would be better with chowder or milk, so the saltiness didn't keep growing on you.

These biscuits are very good, but the ones from RL are much better.  They were too salty and to much garlic, so I fixed them again with less salt and garlic.  I also used more cheese.

These are really good!! I also added some garlic powder into the mixture, and added extra cheddar and some parmesean. I added a pinch of basil and oregano to the melted butter, and after brushing the biscuits with that, left them in the warm oven about 5 or so minutes longer!! They were a big hit!!! Will make again for sure!

This is an excellent clone of the famous Red Lobster biscuits. However, I highly recommend adding a couple sprinkles of Italian seasoning, which contains marjoram, thyme, rosemary, savory, sage, oregano and basil, to the garlic butter sauce. Red Lobster uses this seasoning on their biscuits and it really does enhance the flavor.

Holy cow, it is so easy. It's almost as fast as heating up bread. My first try: I use the jiffy baking mix, it is not quite like RL's yet, but I think all the essentials are pretty much there. I quartered the recipe for my own individual portion. If you do that, you might consider skipping the salt, especially if you used salted butter. After all, it's kind of hard to measure 1/16 tsp of salt.

Would someone please tell me what baking mix is?  I tried this recipe with regular flour and it was yukky.  I then tried it with pancake mix; they tasted grose.  Then I tried it with bisquick and they came out ok but not what I had expected; they were dry.  I did like that butter sauce.  When I find out what baking mix is I will try again.  I asked at the grocery store and no one knew.  I looked it up in several cookbooks and on the internet but I could not find any info on it.

These biscuits were really great.  I also added additional cheese to the mix.  My cook time was a little longer, maybe the size of my scoop.  The parchment work perfectly.  Definitely will bake these again.  Sooooo easy.

These are so delicious. I recommend adding a couple pressed garlic cloves, doubling the cheddar, and adding parmesan cheese. Make sure you fold the dough over lots before you cut the biscuits out to make them high and flaky. I make these almost weekly now. Incredible.

These biscuits are the absolute best! I added 1 oz more cheese and put the ingredients into the mix and they turned out so good. I used the remaining butter topping to spread into the biscuits after they were done to add extra flavor. My hubby loves 'em! - Steph

Yum! These were almost identical to the Red Lobster biscuits, which I love. I am a garlic and cheese lover and these were definitely up to par. Definitely make these if you like Red Lobster's biscuits! Surprisingly easy to make!

I had fun with these.  They were easy and tasted really good, but I forgot to scale down the recipe and had WAY too many.  They don't taste very good the next day, so my advice is to scale the recipe down so you have no leftovers.

I made these biscuits for a family get together.  They were very easy to make, and didn't take very long.  As for taste, everyone at dinner thought the tasted much better than biscuits served at a certain restaurant!

The biscuits tasted good, but didn't look very pretty.  They didn't get brown and they stayed lumpy looking.

To make these taste like Red Lobster Cheddar Bay Biscuits, cut one stick of COLD  butter into the dry biscuit mix, leaving pea-sized pieces of butter, and add the remaining ingredients being careful not to overmix.  When it bakes that butter melts and leaves an airy light biscuit.  Still make the buttery topping, and put over the warm biscuits.

Just FYI....(I live in British Columbia Canada & there isn't ONE Red Lobster in the whole province.....so I'm devastated! but...) you can buy a 1.28kg box of Red Lobster Cheddar Bay Biscuit Mix made by Continental Mills Inc. Seattle WA. It's made exclusively for Red Lobster & has 4 packs of biscuit mix that make 10 biscuits each &  pkts. of garlic herb blend to mix w/melted butter to put on top.  All you add is shredded cheddar and water & butter.  The are EXACTLY like what they serve at the restaurant!  Yummy!!!

These biscuits were very good, but not as good as that seafood restaurant.  When I make it  again I think I may add more cheese.  I will use the recipe again.

Really good and really easy...my kind of recipe.  I did not read the recipe completely and added the garlic and onion powder into the baking mix...oops.  Added the correct amount of garlic  and onion powder to melted butter and it was quite savory.  So the extra worked out very well.  Thanks for the recipe

soft inside and crunchy outside.  The cheese was just perfect. I didn't have a pastry brush so I just dipped each as they came out of the oven.  Sprinkled old bay seasoning after dipping in butter sauce.

These turned out pretty good. I took the advise of adding the Bay seasoning and that was a great add in. Think I may add more cheese in next batch.

I make these CB Biscuits about every three months.  However, I do add Old Bay seasoning and use milk or H&H vs. the water. Prior to baking, I brush them with: melted butter, fresh minced garlic, fresh parsley and chives.  This gives them a nice crispy top and very moist interrior.  After cooling, I wrap them in 2's in plastic wrap and put all in the freezer bag. Pull two out, defrost and bake on 300 for about 5 minutes.

personal opinion, they meant to say 3 c. baking mix rather than 4... Tried it the way it's written. Okay, I used a gluten free 1 for 1 baking mix, and my water/milk was coconut milk made from coconut powder according to directions, and if anything it was lighter rather than heavier than milk, and probably extra cheese, more than 3 oz. It came out a very dry dough, so I added about 3 tbsp. plain yogurt to moisten it up a bit,  but still not enough.  Was very crumbly, just barely holding together, and after baking sufficient time, tasted doughy, and could not taste the cheese much either. Also made more than 20 rather large biscuits. So that's why I think they meant "3 cups" baking mix. I may try it again someday, with that adjustment.

The video mentions Old Bay Seasoning but the recipe does not show it.
I prefer fresh garlic and onion minced real fine and a salt free seafood seasoning. The Spice Hunter has a great one.

Excellent!!! These tasted EXACTLY like the Red Lobster version! I can't believe so simple. So happy I tried, will use often I am sure. The only thing I did differently was to use 1 teaspoon of Johnny's Garlic Seasoning to flavor the butter, because I was too lazy to gather the other flavors. Thank you for this!

These were barely edible and we wound up throwing them out.  It seems like 3 oz is not nearly enough shredded cheese and I think the biscuits would be better with seasoning in them.  They didn't bake in the amount of time shown either.  I followed this recipe exactly and it just did not turn out well.

I used a commercial, licensed mix for Cheddar Bay Biscuits the night before an loved them so much I wanted to be able to make them myself. I followed the instructions and the ingredient list was surprisingly basic, but the results were spectacular. Everyone loved them and said it was a new family regular. Cheddar Bay Biscuits ftw!

The butter sauce was yummy!  I think I added too much water; my biscuits were big and spread a lot.  Versatile, since I served these with soup, as sausage biscuits in the morning, and then as dumplings for stew the next day.  I may try what others have suggested and add a little Old Bay if I'm serving with seafood.

The biscuit flavor was exactly what I expected however they did not rise as fluffy as I expected using the Jiffy baking mix.

Good flavor. I chose the gluten free bisquick baking mix and they came out quite hard but I’m sure the original recipe was better.

This is a great recipe!  I have made this several times now and love it.  I have added a little more garlic powder than the recipe calls for though as I like the taste of garlic.  The 1st time I made these, I did the drop type biscuit, but wasn't wowed by the "look" of them.  Since, each time I've made them, I don't roll them out either, but I've shaped the dough the square, then cut the square into 8 smaller squares.

Cut the recipe in half for the two of us and it still made too many biscuits.  I did not add the spices to the biscuits directly but did use them as directed in the butter used to finish them. 

They were a hit although I think Ill increase the cheese next time..  I used extra sharp cheddar.

I had purchased the red lobster brand mix at costco and was annoyed when I got home and found out that the cost of making the biscuits was just about doubled by the cheese I had to add to the mix.  This version is every bit as good as the mix and a lot cheaper.

Love this recipe. I did add 1/2 tsp. of garlic powder into the dough. I also used milk instead of water. Family loved this with soup, or chili.

This recipe will get you really close.  This might sound disturbing, but I found if I straight dunk the biscuits in the garlic butter mixture, then they taste exactly like them.  Usually, I have to set them on a rack to dry or pop them back in the oven for a few minutes to dry out after their butter bath.

These were incredible and tasted just like a certain seafood restaurant's chain. I made them exactly as the recipe stated but added the seasonings to the batter as some suggested along with the butter brushed over the top both before and after baking. Ate so many that I'm waiting to make them again or I will definitely be packing on the pounds which is not something I need!!!!!

Pretty good. Halved recipe. Added garlic powder to dough and more cheddar. Used large cookie scoop- yielded 9 biscuits. Texture was kind of doughy. Maybe I mixed too much or didnt bake long enough.

We liked these! As some others mentioned, mine came out a bit dry, but in all fairness I did use the 'Heart Healthy Bisquick' and that may have made a difference??? I did not add any extra seasonings, but, again as others have mentioned, I wish I would've added more cheese and maybe some garlic powder in the dough. I have a recipe that I have been making for years that we prefer, but this was nice to try for a change. Thanks for sharing. :)

Tastes like the real deal at the chain restaurant that serves them. Do not add Old Bay seasoning, you will ruin them. Double up on the cheese and add some parsley to the batter. I used a cookie scoop to portion them out on the cookie sheet. Don't let these hang around, get 'em while they're hot.

These are delicious, and I serve them frequently with clam chowder. I add about 1/4 tsp. Old Bay seasoning to the butter mixture, and I don't measure the cheese, but I make no other changes. I recommend halving the recipe if serving to a smaller group because they're not as good reheated.

Good biscuits, just wish they were a little less dense, but good flavor. I did add the garlic & onion powders in with both mixtures, and only needed 1/4 c butter to baste the biscuits twice, so just think 1/2 c might be excessive. I also added old bay to both mixtures. They were good, just not great.

I made this recipe last night and loved it!  As a matter of fact my whole family loved it !  It was just too easy and delicious! I didn't change anything but know that when I make it again I'll add a little more cheese and tiny bits of jalapeño pepper for that extra kick! Thank you for the recipe which I'll make over and over again!

These although not exactly as the ones in the box are very good. the only thing I did different was to use 3/4 cup of cheese instead of the 1/2. Also this recipe made a dozen good sized biscuit's. will definitely make them again

Excellent recipe! I added a bit more onion powder and salt and used Bisquick baking mix and have made these on a number of occasions already.

I've lost count of how many times I've made these, usually to go along with shrimp scampi, but they've always been good with whatever I've made them with. I use milk instead of water and double the cheese. I've never tried adding Old Bay seasoning, so I'll give that a go next time. But even without it, still great.

Hey Guys! Could someone tell me what "baking mix" I should use? I'm from Germany and I'd like to cook this recipe but I have absolutely no clue what "baking mix" refers to. I'd be happy if someone could help me.

I added the old bay seasoning as mentioned in the reviews.  They came out amazing!  The only thing id change next time is the type of cheese.  I think if i had used a sharp chedder theyd have more of a cheesy flavor.

These were delicious!  I opted to add an additional 1/4 tsp. of garlic powder directly to the biscuit dough, and used buttermilk in place of the water.  I also added some Old Bay seasoning to the butter mixture and put the biscuits back in the oven for a minute or two after brushing the butter on top to get a pretty golden color.

As others suggested - mixed in the spices - cooked - then brushed on melted butter and put back in oven for one minute.  Husband and son raved - actually they each at 5 biscuits - truly loved it - thanks for this easy great recipe!

These we sooooo good! I made them to accompany the Hearty Hamburger Soup found on this site, and my family loves the meal! The biscuits were so yummy dunked in the soup broth. I followed others' suggestions of adding the spices, including 1/4 tsp Old Bay Seasoning, to the batter, doubling the cheese, and using buttermilk in place of the water. I also added spices to the melted butter. The only small problem I had was that they would not brown very well, so I popped them under the broiler for just a minute or two, and they were perfect! Thanks for this recipe, it's a keeper!

I will make it again but set oven to 425 next time.  Maybe my oven is off as I am in a rental but most of the other biscuit recipes say at least 425 to as high as 450!

These little biscuits tasted just like Red Lobster's if not even better. I baked mine at 375 F for only 15 minutes in a preheated oven. They were so moist and simply delicious. Went really well with my crab bisque soup.

These biscuits come out better than any I've had in a restaurant. I make sure not to just brush the butter on but put enough on that it is soaked into the dough.  Also make sure you stir the butter mix every time you brush some on so the spices get mixed up as well and don't all settle to the bottom.

I made these using Jiffy baking mix. I used buttermilk instead of water hoping for richer flavor but they were very bland.

I made this recipe as written, but then decided to add the Old Bay Seasoning as recommended in another review. It was good, but I think I may try brushing the biscuits with the butter mixture before they go in the oven next time, so they maybe come out a little less soggy, which they kind of were when brushing them afterwards.

Delicious!  Followed the recipe except the following changes: used 4 oz of shredded Colby Jack cheese, instead of Cheddar.   Added 1/8 tsp of Old Bay Seasoning.  Baked them for 14 minutes.

My sister and made these for our family and they were great! They could have had a lot more cheese taste, though. Also, we made them too big because we didn't realized that they would rise. Because of this, we had to cook them for twice as long. Other than that they were great!

This definitely hit the spot and got rid of the craving that my husband and I were having. We ate out at this chain restaurant a week or so ago, and ever since then we have been thinking about more of these biscuits. Since we have 3 young boys, we hardly ever get a chance to eat out, and so we had to resort to making our own. They turned out great, and very similar. Thank you for sharing the recipe, cookie!

I used the homemade baking mix recipe from this site for the baking mix, I didn't have milk powder for the mix part so I used milk instead of water, the batter was very dry I added extra milk, I halved the recipe and got 8 large biscuits with my #50 scoop, baked in 15 minutes on parchment lined sheets, used 2 tbsps butter for brushing, omitted salt and used Italian Seasoning for the parsley. Family loved them.

Didn't have time to read any reviews so just made as written and they came out beautiful and tasted EXCELLENT!  They seemed a bit soggy after brushing with butter mixture so popped them back in the oven for a minute or two which did the trick.  Used the two spoon method to scoop onto parchment, too gooey for the cookie scooper.  Recipe made 22 good sized biscuits.

Biscuits fluffed up just beautifully. Couldn't ask for a better quick mix biscuit. I did double the cheese to 6oz because it didn't look like it was enough. However, it's a really nice versatile recipe for extra mix-in's and will be my now go to biscuit recipe. Thank you it's a keeper.

I made these for a 4th of July seafood boil and they were a huge hit. I didn't have any biscuit mix though, so I had to snag a recipe off of this website and half it. They came out perfect though. I used a 1/3 cup measuring cup to measure out the dough and then cut that in half and rolled it into balls. I ended up with 48 bite sized rolls that were a hug hit. These were super simple to make and easily made me the hit of the seafood boil. Thanks for the amazing recipe!

I've tried a number of these cheesy biscuit recipes, and this is the best I've found.  Deffinitely use milk or buttermilk instead of water, and add 1/4 to 1/2 tsp of the Old Bay seasoning (I found mine at Walmart) for that authentic Red Lobster flavor.  I like that this recipe makes more biscuits, since my family goes through them so quickly.

I followed the recipe for the most part, but instead use the butter mixture over the biscuits before baking and added Sazon seasoning with Azafran. It tastes delicious!

Made these the other day.  Scrambled around looking for my original recipe but couldn't find it, and came across this one. Absolutely wonderful!  They are even better than the ones I normally would make.  Indeed VERY close to Red Lobster biscuits.  The only difference I find is that the restaurant ones are a tad more moist and melt-in-your-mouth than this recipe.  But if you're not too finicky about the texture, then this recipe is the best for you.  I did add the seasonings to the batter as well as the butter topping and this really did make all the difference.  I never did this with my other recipe, and I can really taste the change.  These bake up nice and fat and high.  Thanks for sharing!  This is my new official biscuit recipe!

Megan's recipe.  Very good.  Would add a bit more salt-- maybe use garlic salt instead of garlic powder.

Delicious! The only changes that I made where using real minced garlic sautéed in the butter instead of powder...and add a little feta cheese to the batter. You could add any kind of cheese I imagine.

Great with changes

(Halved recipe) Used buttermilk (1 c. Milk + 1 tbsp. lemon juice sit for 5 min.), doubled cheese, 1/2 tsp. garlic powder, 1/8 tsp. onion powder, 1/8 tsp. old bay seasoning, and 1/4 tsp. dried parsley
**too much garlic, therefore try 1/4 tsp. garlic and try 1/2 tsp. old bay seasoning
Update:  buttermilk instead of water; add a touch of butter to dough mixture;  double cheese; add 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp old bay seasoning, 1/4 tsp onion powder, and 1/2 tsp dried parsley to dough mixture;  cookie scoop is small but ice cream scoop is too big (maybe 1/4 cup?);  10 minutes in convection, take out and brush with butter mixture, then put back in for couple minutes

For such a simple recipe, an awesome turnout.  I added 1/4 teaspoon of old bay seasoning to the butter mixture. FABULOUS! These biscuits reheated very easily with one toast cycle on my toaster oven.

Excellent!  I did adjust to taste per other reviews - increased cheese to 1 cup, added 1 tsp garlic powder, 1/8 tsp onion powder and 1/4 tsp old bay to the biscuit mix and then again to the butter with half the salt listed.  I didn't have parsley on hand, but used fresh chives instead.  I was sure to just mix my dry ingredients per another reviewers suggestion to ensure the best texture.  Biscuits were light, flaky and moist - fabulous!!  Definitely a keeper!

Awesome!  I think people are using flour instead of baking mix.  You HAVE to use Bisquick.  Regular old Bisquick from back in the day - it says "Original pancake and baking mix" on the box.  I didn't have quite enough cheddar cheese so I made up the difference with Swiss.  Tasted great and just might make it with a little Swiss from now on. Family can't wait to have them again.

Loved the flavour and how easy this was to make! I did everything the recipe asked but in the end, I sprinkled some garlic salt after brushing the butter bit. Four stars only because I didn't know how big or small to portion for the 10-12 minute cooking time. This point was trial and error for me.

These are wonderful.  Just when I thought I'd never learn how to make a nice biscuit.  These were very fluffy and moist and my BF can't get enough of them.  I do think the cheese measurement is off.  I think the author meant cups, not ounces.  4 cups of Bisquick and 3 measily ounces of cheese would never result in the pictures shown or any flavor of cheese.  The topping at the end is a must.  I add a 1/2 teaspoon of Old Bay to mine.

This recipe was good but I had to bake it for longer than the time listed or it was gooey in the middle.  I will bake the next batch at 400 degrees for 15 minutes and see if they bake up better.

Made these exactly as recipe directed, and used the Easy Biscuit Mixture as suggested, and they were delicious!  These are the closest to Red Lobster's I've had, and I've tried lots of recipes and mixes.  I did have to cook them a little longer to get them brown, but they didn't get hard.  Sooooo good!

These were good, but not quite as flavorful as Red Lobster.  I still give it five stars, because the texture was perfect and the recipe, as written, is a good "jumping-off" point.  I made them a second time and used chicken broth for 1/2 of the liquid and milk for the other half.  I used about 6 ounces of shredded cheddar, and a pinch of sea salt in the mix.  I also put 1/8 tsp of garlic powder and 1/8 tsp parsley in the mix (in addition to parsley and garlic that go in butter mixture. Thanks, Cookie!

This was very easy, and tasted delicious!  I used milk instead of water (that is what the bisquick biscuits call for) and cooked for 12 minutes at 400.  Thanks!

Nice change of pace for a drop biscuit recipe - but really, you can't go wrong with Bisquick or their drop biscuit recipe on the box. As written, it's a bland recipe and could use more seasoning. I added the Old Bay (a Baltimore girl always has this on hand!), as suggested by others, and that's what it needed. Will definitely use again.

Followed the recipe exactly except brushed 1/2 of the garlic butter on biscuits a minute before I took them out of the oven, and the rest after. So Yummy! My family raved. Will definitely make these again.

I have made this recipe 4 times now and have always been consistently complimented on these biscuits. My friends LOVE the flavor from the butter glaze that goes on top. It's a super easy recipe that doesn't really need any modifications. The only thing I change is adding more cheese (about 1/2 c.) to the batter. Make sure you don't pull them out until they are golden on top and be careful about putting these out before your main dish, your friends will fill up on them!! Guaranteed to make guests happy! :o)

Good biscuit. Not quite like the famous restaurant chain, but a delicious substitute. I too used milk instead of water, added garlic salt, Old Bay and parsley to dough, and baked for additional 3-4 minutes after brushing with butter mixture.

Fast and easy.  I managed to do all the prep work in the time it took to preheat the oven.  They were a bit like a scone in texture and slightly dry... not as popular as regular dinner rolls, but received well.  I made recipe as specified.  I think adding seasoning to the mix would have been overkill, but in my case I used a spoon to pour the herb mix on, and picked up the garlic salt which filtered to the bottom.  A tiny bit of oil might help with the dryness.

This was a pretty good recipe! I halved my batch and it tasted absolutely fine. We don't have a weight so I used 1/4 cup of mild cheddar, ending up with enough cheese in the final result.

I will probably take the advice of others and use the extra OOMPH! needed in the recipe though. Felt like it was missing a little something.

I followed the recipe exactly the way it was written and found it was good but not great. Found they tasted a bit doughie in the middle. The best part was for sure the top.

Excellent! We added a pinch of Old Bay seasoning to the batter. Next time, we'll add another pinch. We also added 1/4 tsp of Old Bay Seasoning to the butter mixture. Can't recommend this enough to eat with seafood! :D

Excellent biscuits, and so simple. I made them twice with two different baking mix recipes, and both were delicious, though different. I'll definitely make this again, and likely often.

Very good, tried to use garlic and onion salt together as a substitute for the other ingredients, but wound up too salty (even though I did omit regular salt from recipe).  Will make again, good recipe that complimented our dinner and nice change of pace from our usual Bisquick recipe biscuits!  Thanks.

Wonderful - light and fluffy and great taste.  I put parsley and onion powder in the biscuits as well as in the melted butter.  Used 1/2 cup of buttermilk and 1/4 cup of water for the scaled down recipe for 10 biscuits.

Made them exactly to the recipe, even when i adjusted the servings to 6 they turned out great. If you're in a hurry you can put them in a muffin pan and they only to be baked about 10 minutes. They're the perfect size and cook in half the time!

Very delicious biscuits after I added some extra seasonings as advised by other reviewers.  I thought the biscuits could have used more water in the mix, as they were rather dry, which I find true of biscuits in general.  I was a little worried when I started to make the mix because of how dry the mix was, but they turned out great with addition of old bay seasoning.

Amazing biscuits, and they came out perfectly.  So easy to make.  Just be careful - the dough gets very sticky so you might have to use a little extra flour.  I also added some extra garlic powder into the actual baking mix (used Bisquick) and the taste was great.  I like my biscuits a little bigger, so I got about 15 total.  And to lighten up the recipe, you can easily use 2% cheese and a lighter butter spread without any problems.  One of my favorites!

Excellent, excellent, excellent! These taste identical to Red Lobster's Cheddar Bay Biscuits! I brushed the tops once when they came out of the oven, but I still had plenty left over so I brushed and re-brushed and it tasted delicious! I would recommend these to anyone looking for a great biscuit to go with a pasta or salad!

Love these biscuits! Just like the chain restaurant.  I replaced the water with milk just as others suggested and it was excellent!  I made it for Thanksgiving but made them small which yield about 40.  My kids ate so much there was only 12 remaining after dinner.  It was a hit!

Mistake #1.... 4 cups of flour... Jeez I had biscuits running out of my ears.  I used milk, off of another recipe and somehow mixed the garoic, onion parsley and butter in the mix to bake.  This recipe is a tad bit over the hill for only 20 biscuits and 375 is not a good temp with which to bake biscuits.... Dunno how this is going to turn out but will look for a better recipe that seems logical.

These biscuits were delicious.  I followed the exact recipe and my family loved them.  To scoop the mixture before baking I used my pampered chef cookie scoop and this made about 30 biscuits.  We will be making these again very soon.

These were fantastic! Quick & easy. I halved the recipe and now make this often with family dinner. They are a hit with everyone. I add garlic salt & dried parsley to the batter as well as extra cheese. After they are done I douse them with the butter sauce and then stick them back in the oven for another 2 minuted. They come out beautifully golden, with just the right amount of crunch to the top layer. I have tried these with and without the BAY seasoning, both ways are delicious.

Yum, yum, yum! My husband is a cheese lover, so I'm a little heavy-handed with the cheese, but other than that, I left the recipe as is. So easy, and they go with just about everything. Potato soup and these: Fantastic!

Boy, with 832 reviews mine doesn't count for much.  However, these biscuits rock!  I followed some reviewers suggestions and used milk instead of water and would use more cheese next time.

These were so awesome!!! i used milk instead of water and did add garlic powder, minced onion (didn't have onion powder), parsley and zatarain's creole seasoning (didn't have old bay and all my store had was a huge $8 container of it) to the mix as well, and increased the cheese. i took the advice of others and omitted the salt from the butter topping, but would add some next time just for my personal taste. i also halved the recipe and got 10 nice size biscuits, plenty for my family of 3. also when i removed from oven, poked several holes in tops with a toothpick so the butter topping could seep through. these are a new staple in my house! just for reference, i used jiffy baking mix. can't wait to make these again!

My husband hated these. I didn't think they were great but they weren't that bad either. The garlic butter that you put on top was WAYYYYY too salty! If I do make these again (which I probably wont since I'd be the only one eating them) I would cut way back on the salt since the garlic powder has salt in it as well as the butter. I would probably use real garlic as well. The bread was good but the butter needed to be tweaked a bit.

I couldn't believe how easy these were to make, and they taste *just* like the restaurant's. I followed Tracy M's advice and added the Old Bay Seasoning - perfect!

Very good recipe! Next time I'll cut the butter in half and use the same amount of seasonings to give them a little bit more flavor. My kids and husband went back for more and more and more....

Instead of using flavored butter for these, I added the seasoning into the batter.  I also added 1/4 tsp. of old bay to the batter as well.  These were really tasty.  They just don't have the light as air feeling to them.  They are a little heavy.  The taste though, is spot on.  It's everything I wanted!

Very delicious!  As one of the other reviewers mentioned, I added about 1/8 teaspoon Chesapeake Bay Seafood Seasoning.  I thought that they turned out a bit too salty, so I think I will omit the salt next time.  They were definitely a hit in my household!

These were soooo delicious! I am not a baker, in fact I don't think that I have ever made biscuits (or even cookies) all that successfully! These were moist and delicious. I took other reviews and added parsley, onion powder and garlic to the mix as well as increasing the cheese. I also used chopped garlic in the mix and the garlic powder on top.  Used unsalted butter and omitted the salt in the topping and it was perfect! I didn't actually measure anything but the baking mix and water!

These were very good! I added spices to the dry mix and then also added the same amount to the butter mix. I also added the old bay spice to both as well @ 1/8 teaspoon. Next time I will add more cheese.  And maybe sub milk for water or just add a little more water. I wanted the texture to be a little  softer. The inside was a  little on the dry side. Overall very good!

I have been trying various recipes for those famous biscuits and this one was good and very similar. However, a few months ago, I tried the recipe from the Food Network Magazine and found them to be a lot better in flavor and in softness.

Very easy, tasty recipe.  I added some of the seasoning into the dough itself.  Next time I will add about an ounce more cheese and cut out the salt as the butter was a bit salty for me

SOOOO GOOD and so very easy!  Easy to make and easy clean up.  I used the dough hook on my mixer, which worked beautifully! I also used reduced calorie mix and smart balance for the butter.....to lighten things up a bit!

These were fun to make, I did add the Old Bay Seasoning and I didn't read the recipe well enough so I added the seasonings to the dough the first time out.  Made it right the second time and thought they were a bit bland, so I  will add the seasonings to the dough from now on and a bit to the butter.

These were so close to the real thing. I do think with a bit more cheese they would be perfect, so I will add more next time. The only butter in the store that came in sticks was garlic butter, so I used that and omitted the garlic powder and accidentally forgot the salt.

I cut this down to eight servings which made six large biscuits. (Odd, I know.) I used my own homemade baking mix and beer in place of the water. These were good, but I think they would have been better if the spices were added into the biscuits instead of mixed into the butter. The beer was a good addition.

Pretty yummy biscuits for the ingredients and time involved.  I cut my servings down to 10 and got 9 really nice sized biscuits out of it.  I could have cut the butter mixture in half as I had a fair amount left over.  I cooked mine for the whole 12 minutes.

Good not quite the same but close enough that they were gone within 24 hours. Based on a reviewer's comment I did add some old bay seasoning to the dough. These shared the plate with crab stuffed manicotti one night and with lobster bisque another.

I had plain biscuits leftover from last night, so I cut those in half and put cheddar cheese slices in the middle. Then brushed them with the garlic butter (inside and out) and toasted them in the oven (350 for 5min). Delicious! I tried with a hint of bay seasoning and it added a fun kick for one biscuit but got a little old after that. Next time I'd leave that out and just stick with the original recipe (minus the salt - that wasn't needed).

Eh. These were allright. Nothing to write home about, but a decent complement to the cheddar baked chicken (Judy) I made for dinner tonight. I hate to give a mediocre review, but don't feel I can give a great one either.... Not only did these taste nothing like the "famous" chain's biscuits (IMHO), they were also (somewhat) dry and terribly bland. I even doubled the spices (added half to my batter and used the other half in my melted butter topping), added 1/4 t + a dash / 1/8 t Old Bay seasoning (for authenticity) and doubled up on the cheddar. Keep in mind, I did halve this, so when I say doubled, I used the amounts called for per Cookie's recipe (if you don't halve this, double the amounts of cheese / spices called for). My only other change was to substitute milk for water (I wanted to clear some items out of my fridge). I made 9 LARGE biscuits and, because of this, I ended up baking for 13.5 minutes total. I still prefer mini cheddar biscuits (Chris Rentmeister), but I'm glad I tried this recipe too. I first found Chris's recipe in my TOH Quick Cooking cookbook and have been making it ever since. I guess it goes without saying that once you find a recipe you like, there's no use looking for another. Sorry, Cookie. I won't be making yours again. Thanks anyways. :)

Best Biscuits I have made from this site so far! I LOVED these! I doubled the cheese and used fresh parsley from the garden. In the future I will probably seasoning into the batter AND on top. These were so yummy. I used my ice cream scoop to measure out the dough and it worked perfectly.

My mom made these for Christmas, and they were great. Almost like the biscuits from the chain restaurant. A great addition to any poultry dinner!

This is one of the best recipes I've found on this site. Tastes identical to the popular restaraunt and has an identical texture as well, which is the best part. It's also super easy and quick to make, and is used with things you have in your pantry. I followed others suggestions and put the biscuits back in the oven for a couple of minutes after pouring the butter mixture onto them, and added some Old Bay seasoning in the butter. Thanks for the recipe!

These were okay, but kind of salty and just not as exceptional as I thought they'd be based on other reviews.  We won't make again.

These were very good, almost too good because we wanted to eat them all as soon as they came out of the oven.  Just as good as the lobster restaurant but much cheaper than going out to eat.

These are some good cheese biscuits. Very much like Red Lobster. I loved them!!! I put a bit of parsley and garlic salt in the dough... Was very careful not to overmix. Mid way I put the butter sauce on them and let them continue baking. I used bisquick buttermilk biscuit mix...thatnks for the recipe!!

These are very similar to the seafood restaurant biscuits.  I didn't use exact measurements and probably added alot more cheese but we enjoyed these.  Next time I might use milk vs. water and increase the baking temp. to follow the recipe on the box.

Yum! I omitted the salt because Bisquick is always too salty for me. I didn't measure the cheese, I just added a couple handfuls.

I was dissappointed in these biscuits. I added some garlic and onion powder to the dry ingredients, but I still thought they were really bland. The texture was great, moist and fluffy!

I thought these were great.  My daughter made them to go with our homemade clam chowder today.  The recipe is quite forgiving--we took others' suggestions to brush the biscuits partway through cooking and again towards the end--fantastic.  Also, because other foods were being timed while the biscuits were cooking, I can't swear my baking time was right-on, but they turned out nonetheless.  Thanks for the recipe, we enjoyed it!

These tasted too much like Bisquick and not so much like Red Lobster Cheddar Bay biscuits.  The texture was too crumbly and not flaky, even though I did not over-mix.  I'll keep searching for a way to make Red Lobster's Cheddar Bay biscuits.

WOW! These were melt-in-your-mouth good. Due to another recommendation, I put 1 cup of cheddar cheese in the dough and it was perfect. (I used the 10-serving recipe amounts). I will definitely make these again.

I have made this many times.  I always use pioneer baking mix and buttermilk(instead of water).  I have never tried it with the old bay seasoning as suggested in other reviews but will do so very soon.  This is one of my favorite recipes!

These were quick and easy to make. There were no leftovers! I had to sub italian seasonings for the parsley (I was out) and I added more cheese because I love cheese. I also added a little bit of garlic powder to the biscuit mix. I do agree with others that it's missing Old Bay to match RL. But they are fine as written

Yum!  I did take another reviewer's advice and put a dash of Old Bay into the mix and butter.  We ate every last one!

We loved these. Really yummy. They took a bit longer to brown, so we just left them in the oven for a few more minutes and they turned out great. They don't taste quite like Red Lobsters, unfortunately, but they are good. I may try the Old Bay Seasoning like some others mentioned next time.

Sorry to say we really didn't care for these.  I used Bisquick, and followed directions to a T, but they did not brown one bit during the alloted time and I had to pull them out, brush them with the butter mix, and put them under the broiler to get them browned.  By then they were just kind of dry and crumbly.

This recipe was great! I did need to bake mine a little longer and I did add "Old Bay Seasoning",but overall they tasted very similar to that seafood chain restaurant.

I made these with reduced fat Bisquick and 1% cheddar cheese.  I used light margarine and they really didn't brown correctly.  I wish I'd read the last review and brushed them after 12 minutes and then baked them for about 5 more.  I halved the recipe and it made 9 large biscuits.  I'd try them again with a dash of Old Bay in the dough and in the butter mixture.  Again, this just may be one of those recipes that doesn't convert well to low fat.  Thanks for the recipe.

They are very close to the same as Red Lobster, not quite but as close as I could get. So tasty. Make sure you do the melted butter on top it makes them even better!

I made these for a dinner party. The others liked them. As for me..I was a little disappointed in how not-so flaky they were. It could of been my fault down the line some where...as I am not the greatest cook. But these got a 3 star from me.

these are great! i put in nearly an entire pound of chopped up crisped bacon and doubled the cheese. upon another tip, i brushed with the butter mix 3 minutes before they were to be done and continued baking. that made them melt in your mouth divine!

Very good! tastes just like the ones RL serves, if, I hadn't added too much water/milk mix they would have been perfect...they ended up more cookie like than biscuit like. I did add more garlic, cheese and Old Bay seasoning. These are so easy to make and have become a favorite that will be served frequently I'm sure!

I am just starting to bake, but I made these because I love the biscuits at the famous "seafood" place.  WOW.  I was shocked that they turned out so good.  I took some to work to ask the girls for their opinions and came home with an empty tin and every one of them requested the recipe.   The only change I made was that I used the garlic butter from the store and melted it==>all the needed spices are in it already.  Was quicker.    And these go fantastic with the jambalasta recipe submitted by raesive.

These are pretty good.  I didnt have onion powder so I just didnt use it.  I also cut the recipe in half. I wanted to test a few things.  I did some brushed with butter garlic mixture, some with cheese sprinkled on top about half way thru baking time.  I think I liked the ones with cheese sprinkled on top best.  I also followed the baking instructions on the bisquick box.  I will make these again and try it with some onion powder or old bay.

Easy to make, and pretty good. I think next time I would add more cheese - maybe sprinkle some on top and put the spices and parsely into the dough and skip the butter. Thanks!

A little too salty for my liking, but I think if I cut the spices down a bit I will get a close to perfect biscuit. Thanks! I added the butter/spices to the biscuits about 5 minutes before they were done in the oven. They turned out beautifully.

I made my biscuits too big so they came out with a doughy taste. Husband liked them though.

These taste so yummy. My whole family loves them and we make them all the time. I even use the butter sauce on other rolls etc. because it is so good.

I added about 1/4-1/2 teaspoon Old Bay seasoning && they were perfect!! I paired this with Baked Potato Soup, and my fourteen month old gobbled it all up -- so did her daddy, lol!!!

I have tried to make biscuits numerous times and they never turn out.  These, however, turned out great.  Tasted just like the ones from Red Lobster.  You will not be disappointed with this recipe.  I did add the Old Bay Seasoning as was recommended.

Yummy.  I made the recipe as is, and I wouldn't change a thing.  I ended up with 18 biscuits so I guess I made them little big.  For that reason, I ended up having to bake them about 15 minutes.

These were great! My whole family liked them, and my husband declared them "a keeper." The garlic butter mixture would be great on any bread. I'm going to use it on homemade loaves of Italian bread to make garlic bread.

Nice change from italian bread at dinner. I only used 2 cups bisquick and enough milk with the decrease. I also added garlic powder and parsley to the mix. Melted the butter with more garlic and brushed on when done. The only change  would make is to add more cheese - we didn't think they were cheesey enough.

I added some lemon juice to the butter mixture and brush it on right before they are done.  The lemon adds that missing kick! It might be good with lime juice as well, but I haven't tried that yet.

Good, but I added all the spices and herbs to the dough as well, plus chives. I was glad I did that because it would have been flavorless/colorless without. All in all, I think I tripled the spices, and everybody at Thanksgiving liked them a lot. Next time I will also double the cheese. Hopefully it will be something like the biscuits from Red Lobster that I love so much, but can't afford to go eat more than once a year! Thanks for posting!

I made these for dinner tonight and they came out pretty well.  I score them a 4-star because I made a few modifications that others had suggested.  I made the batter with milk instead of water and I added parsley, garlic salt and old bay seasoning to the batter and increased my cheddar cheese by a handful.  I plan on making these again soon.  Thanks for sharing.

I prepared these according to the recipe and they were average.  They were rather bland.  (Side note: I did use low-fat Bisquick.)  It made 13 good-sized biscuits.  In the second half of the batch, I added a little salt and garlic powder to the dough, and they tasted much better.  With the modification, I'd give them 4.5 stars.  Next time, I plan on trying milk instead of water and maybe adding a little butter to the dough.

1st time I tried this recipe I used parchment paper... first of all I almost burnt my house down, second of all, we didn't get to eat the biscuits that night because they were covered in parchment paper on the bottom. The second time I just greased the pan... MUCH BETTER!!! they turned out SOOOOO good!

I use milk instead of water and about 1 cup cheese.  And they seem to turn out better if I use the garlic with the parsley already in it.

I rated this four only because I made a few modifications.  I added the seasonings to the mix as well as 1/4 cup melted butter.  Then I used the recipe original butter and spice mix for on top... not the healthiest, but so delicious.

I, too, used milk instead of water, used more cheese (personal preference), and added the seasonings to the Bisquick as recommended by others.  I used my medium sized Pampered Chef cookie scoop and got 29 biscuits.  The biscuits were great even a few days later.  I can't keep my oldest son out of them!

I love these biscuits! Took the advise of Tricia M. and used old bay seasoning in the mix as well as in the butter spread. I also found the seasoning in my supermarket near the seafood. It's inexpensive and delicious. The only reason i'm not giving this five stars is because it needs way more cheese than the recipe states. I doubled it and will add even more next time. I also added a pinch of garlic and onion powders into the mix. YUM!

I was disappointed with these biscuits. The reviews were wonderful and maybe my expectations were a little bit to high, but I thought they were just alright! I did have them 2 day's later for a big breakfast that was cooked up at my house, and I really thought they were much better then!

These are so good and only take like 5 minutes more than popping the cheap dough out of a can (which is fine, but they do get old after a while).  I used probably 1 cup of cheese and I also used milk instead of water.  I too mixed my spices into the dough.  Soooo tasty and so easy.  Would these be good with a dash of dill?  Hmm...maybe I'll try that next time.  :-)

Ok, I did change some things like other reviewers did.  I used milk instead of water, I added 8oz of cheddar cheese, and also added the garlic powder and parsley to the batter, and also on top.  I forgot the salt.. oops. And I didnt have any onion powder so I used onion flakes.  It did feel a little doughy to me in the middle, but the flavor was nice.  I think next time I will add minced garlic also.  Plus salt and onion powder.  The kids (4yrs & 2yrs`) loved them.  And they dont like anything.  Thanks!

Amazing with the addition of herbs into the dough.  Also doubled the amounts.  I should have made smaller dobs of dough onto the pan, though.  It was my first time using bisquick this way and the biscuits got way bigger than I anticipated.

everyone has an opinion! son and i thought these were 5 stars! daughter said they tasted too much like a cross between cheeseits and garlic bread and that the two tastes didn't belong together. hubby said they had too MUCH flavor! i would leave OUT the salt next time but the flake of these is great and i used a really good quality cheddar--perfectly cheesy!

This is delicious and tastes like Red Lobster's, but as other reviewers said the next time i make this I'm adding powdered garlic and onion to the batter itself.
it's a great substitute for me since there's no "Red Lobster" in the country i live in :)
I highly recommend you try it.

These were amazing!!!  They were so much like the ones I crave from Red Lobster.  The only thing is that they didn't look done even though they were.  They came out kinda white, but they still tasted great.  Thank you so much for the recipe!!

Fabulous!!!! I made a few adjustments. Like others suggested, I used milk rather than water and added old bay to the seasonings. Also, I doubled the seasonings and added half to the bisquick mix (cheddar garlic) and mixed half with the melted butter which I spooned over the biscuits a few minutes before taking them out of the oven. These are wonderful!!!!

I made these for a summer party yesterday and they turned out really great! One thing I may change is I may add milk instead of water, as some people suggested. I made them as suggested and they seemed just slightly dry (to me, anyway). Also they need to bake a bit longer. But they have a great flavor and were enjoyed by everyone. I will make them again. These would go great with a hearty stew or soup in the winter!

Ok, let me start by saying I read the recipe wrong and thought it called for 3 cups of cheese, not three ounces (oh God) anyway I ended up putting 1 1/2 c. of colby jack,and used milk instead of water. They turned out wonderful, and not at all too cheesy!!!

I made these and my sister likes them. She thinks they taste like a well known restaurants biscuits but I think they are too gummy. I have made them twice and both times they were gummy. I guess that is how they are supposed to be.

My family liked the biscuits, they would have been better with the spices inside the biscuit instead of basted with it.  I'm trying that next time.

So good!  They did taste just like the restaurant's and were surprisingly easy.  I'll be making these again and again. Thanks for the recipe!

This was amazing! I did take some suggestions and subbed the water for milk. They dissapeared fast... and for how quick and easy they are to make, that's no problem. I can just make more in a handful of minutes!

Very very very good- really around a 4.75.   I added some crushed garlic to the batter and some extra cheddar (about 1/4 cup) which worked out well.  I would add more cheese next time (I am a cheese addict!!)

Definately add seasonings to the mix as well as to the butter topping!  Used milk instead of water.  These were unbelievable.  Served them with Cream of Potato Soup.  Mmmmm

Easy to make and delicious!  I, too, replaced the water with milk, added extra cheddar, and mixed the "toppings" in.  I also sprinkled a little garlic salt on top after I brushed with melted butter.  I will make these again and again!

Pretty darn good. I did add extra garlic to the mix (we like them garlicky).  My family loved them and thought they tasted like the ones I make from a pre-packaged mix.

OH MY GOODNESS!!   These were totally great....so very close to the real thing. I didn't have a pastry brush so I just dipped the biscuit in the butter mixture upside down and then put them back in the oven for a few....MMMMMMM!   Thanks for sharing

To be fair, I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I used milk instead of water, and a little more garlic than called for, including putting some in the dough and not just in the butter on top. But it was a really yummy biscuit, just not exactly what I was looking for. I was hoping for a more salty garlicky taste. I ended up using a lot more salt and garlic than called for even after my original extra. But still very very delicious. I'm going to continue to use the basic recipe with a few changes. Thanks!

Simply the best.  Recipes like this is what makes Allrecipes my favorite website.  This is a fabulous recipe.  I took others suggestions and increased the amount of garlic powder that you brush on.  My hubby went nuts for these.  It feels great to serve a good meal and make your man smile.  Thanks for sharing!

Everyone loved these.  I read the reviews before making and added the garlic powder, onion powder and parsley to the baking mix as well as the butter.  Turned out excellent!  I'll definately be making these again.

Easy, easy, easy. I added more cheese upon recommendation & used milk instead of water. We loved them. Also mixed the seasonings in w/ the Bisquik instead of the butter. Made them w/ ultimate potato soup recipe on this site. Thanks for sharing!

When I made these, I was originally just looking for something new to make for a family get together. But now, I have to make them every holiday, every family get together and everytime there's a pitch in at work!! Everyone loves them. As soon as my boyfriend had one, he said that I was never allowed to leave him.

These were fabulous! My husband loved them and he's not a big biscuit fan.  I used buttermilk (and a bit of water) and added some of the seasoning to the mix, as others had recommended.  Thank you for a great recipe!

WOW!!  These are FANTASTIC!  I followed other reviewers' advice and used Milk instead of water, plus added the garlic powder and onion powder to the dough as well as to the melted butter .... positively delectable!  I am at a high altitude, and usually have to make slight adjustments - but still have very little luck with baked goods.  This time, however, it worked beautifully!  I made a very yummy homemade peasant soup and served these biscuits, and the biscuits got eaten way before the soup was gone!  Definately a staple in my home from now on.  Thank you for a delicious, fool proof recipe!!!

What a great replica of a certain seafood restaurants famous biscuits! I followed a few of the suggestions on here, added spice to the batter, as well as the butter, used milk instead of water, doubled the cheese in the batter and put 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese in also. Put the spices in the butter and added italian seasoning. Everyone said tasted just like RL!

Delicous - perfect to the letter!  You will get rave reviews on these biscuits.  And the fact that they're quick and easy to throw together makes it even better - I live to make these with a big pot of soup - that way I don't feel as guilty eating as many as I do....you just can't help it - they are the BEST!

These are the best ever.  They taste just like those at that famous restaurant.  They are not difficult to make and everyone loves them.  They reheat well.  I usually make them when we have get togethers with the family or even if I just want some at home for my family.  The only thing is that I like to add more cheese.

Pretty darn good!  I made these for a lunch that I catered....there wasn't a crumb left!  I took others suggestions and added the spices to the dough as well as the butter.  Next time I am going to cut the butter mixture in half because I was left with so much extra.

Next time I would definitely take the advice from the other reviewers and not add the salt to the butter topping.  Other than that, they were okay.

Soo good.  My husband and I agreed that these are probably the type of thing you make to impress company because it's not very good for us to eat them all by ourselves.  I've only had the Red Lobster biscuits a couple of times, but from what I remember these are pretty similar.

Out of the six of us here for dinner, only two raved about these biscuits. In my opinion they were rather dry. Will not make again.

I really liked these.  They came out pretty close to Red Lobsters version.  I will keep this recipe for future use.

Yummy! These were great! I thought they were just like the famous "biscuts". I did add the onion powder, garlic and parsley flakes to the mix and then again with the butter after they were done. My family Loved These! Will make them again!!

These were a hit.  I was looking for something to add to a meal that I was taking to a friend.  Everyone raved about the meal and this was mentioned more than once.  My daughter in law made another batch for us while I delivered the meal.  Grandkids to grandparents all enjoyed.

Oh my goodness!  These are so good they are DANGEROUS!  I took the advice of other reviewers and used spices in the butter, turned out fabulous.  I also added parsley in the dough, makes them look just like Red Lobster's.  Very good, thanks!

These are good.  Very easy to prepare.  I have served them several times.  No one has ever gone nuts over them but they are well received.  I find that guest enjoy the plain biscuits more.  But these very nice.

I made these tonight for the first time.  My Mother-In-Law from Australia is visiting the US for the first time and I thought these biscuits would be perfect for a beef tenderloin "on the barbie" accompanied with tomato/mozzarella salad.  Talk about delicious, these were absolutely to die for!!  Shhhhh, but she ate 4 of them with dinner!

LOVED them.  I have been craving red lobster biscuits since i was a little kid, and now i can make them so easily at home.  I fried the garlic in the butter a little bit first.  It took me maybe half a minute to prepare it and then twenty minutes to bake it probably since I have a toaster oven.  Well, this is the easiest, most delicious recipe here and i am so glad i found it

These are excellent.  Although I used a Buttermilk Biscuit mix and buttermilk in place of baking mix and water.  I followed the directions on the pack for the biscuits, then added the cheddar.  Turns out excellent!  Although based on a previous review... I will try the dash of 'Old Bay' next time.

Great tasting biscuit.  Very similar to Red Lobster's Cedday Bay Biscuits.
I halved the recipe, and it still made 15 biscuits.  I will probably quarter it next time since it is just the two of us.

Yum.

I followed the advice of others and added all of the herbs to the melted butter AND I brushed the biscuits twice: once halfway through the baking and again when they're finished.

All of my college friends LOVE these biscuits and they ask for them whenever they come over for dinner.

Great recipe!

I made these as a side to go along with Broccoli Cheese Soup, and they ended up being the main attraction for us!  I'm not a huge fan of biscuits (they always seem too dry to me) but hubby loves them and he went crazy over these.  I halved the recipe, used extra cheese, and a small ice cream scoop which worked perfectly.  Thanks so much for this delicious recipe.

These were GREAT!  I baked them at 400 for 12 minutes.  I brushed the butter sauce on them before cooking them and then again at 10 minutes into the baking.  Also, I didn't have parlsey, and they were still amazing!  I used water, but I wonder if they would be even better with milk??
The only problem I had, I wasn't sure if I was supposed to use a mixer or mix the dough by hand. I used a mixer, and it was too thick for it, really, so I still don't really know.

Since the first time I took down this recipe, I have made it 4 times. All four times were a hit with family and friends. These are biscuits you can bring to the next bbq or pot luck. Easiest thing I've made to date. Thank you!!!

These were really good. I used garlic salt, parsley and no onion powder and they were still yummy.

These are so easy and quick.  I put the garlic powder in the biscuit mixture.  Even without the butter topping these are really good!

i'm not the best of bakers so mine cooked a little to long and were a bit dry, but i think it needed a bit more liquid to soften them up, i also put in more cheese

i just tried making these tonight for a test run before christmas dinner and they came out great!  Due to my inability to measure things out, my biscuits could have probably had more flavor.  All in all they were good and i will definitely making them on the 25th!

This recipe was so easy & it came out great! Took me less than 10 minutes to mix it. I added a bit more cheese & instead of just brushing on the butter after it finished baking, I did it halfway thru as well. My boyfriend gobbled these up and after the first bite he declared me an excellent cook. 
These were not as moist as RL's though. After they cooled they didn't retain their fluffiness. I may use buttermilk instead of water next time. Otherwise they tasted very similar to RL's.

These were delicious and tasted almost exactly like the ones at Red Lobster.  All I do differently is add extra cheese.  Thanks for the recipe!

These biscuits are wonderful!  The recipe I have calls for milk instead of water.  It also does not call for the parsley or onion powder but I will probably try that next time.  Definitely a keeper.

They're not as fluffy as RL's, but they're fine for serving at home.  Next time I will decrease the amount of garlic powder by about half.  I'm not a big fan of garlic.

These were very good, although slightly dry.  They went very fast, everybody loved them and I will definently be making them again.  I used Krusteaz buttermilk pancake mix for this and it went very well.

These were very good biscuits!  A definate improvement on the regular plain biscuit.  Since I very, very rarely have a biscuit mix on hand, this was very convenient to make with ingredients that I do keep on hand!  Will definately be making repeatedly.

The ratios of the various seasonings : butter is perfect - I will probably brush that onto other things, most certainly these delicious biscuits. Thanks so much for sharing.

Really easy, REALLY good. I was skeptical at first. I mean could they really be as good as red lobster? They were ALMOST there. A little more dense to me than red lobster. The topping was great! Served these with quiche and salad. Will make these over and over again. Filed in my "keeper" cookbook

The topping on these biscuits really adds a unique and delicious flavor.  I have tried tons of cheddar biscuit recipes and have found that they just don't pack a cheesey punch, regardless of how much or how sharp the cheese.  And these really are no different, so the addition of the topping really makes these stand out.  Try 'em!!

oh, my god! I could make a whole meal out of these, they're just so good. I had to bake them for a lot longer than 10-12 minutes, and I like mine with more cheese and seasonings, but this recipe still deserves a 5. thanks so much!

I've been meaning to make these forever and finally got around to it this week.  Made these as a side to the Cajun Seafood Pasta on this site.  I can't believe I've been missing out all this time.  Not only are these delicious, but they're sooo easy!  I had to let them bake about 6 minutes longer than stated.

These were so yummy with the clam chowder I made!  I cut the recipe in half and it still made 8 big biscuits.  I will definitly use this one again, my family loved them!  The only thing is you need to eat them fresh.  The baking soda flavor comes through a little when they sit for a day or two.

These rolls were excellent and very easy to make.  We ate quite a few before dinner was even on the table.  The kids really liked them alot, and after trying 6 rolls each, so did me and my husband!

This is the closest recipe I have found for "Red Lobster" biscuits.  I made one minor change, and that was to substitute colby-jack for the cheddar.  Thanks for the great recipe!

easy to make and delicious. used bisquick and followed the recipe to a T except i brushed the biscuits w/ the butter DURING cooking and put 1/4 onion powder and parsley instead of 1/8 and a dash more salt. REALLY close to rL's biscuits!

These were very good.  My husband thought they were too garlicky with the garlic butter brushed on top, so I left half the batch plain and he liked them much better.  I liked the garlic, though.

I used Krusteaz pancake mix instead of Bisquick, I don't know what difference that made.  These were good and garlicky.  They were more dense and heavy than Red Lobster biscuits, but good nonetheless.

I don't know that I can add anything other reviewers haven't.  I also will leave the salt out next time.  But the biscuits do taste very similar to Red Lobster.  I quartered the recipe and with three of us eating there were none left.

As written, recipe only a generous 3.  Quantity of stated 20 biscuits per recipe would yield very small biscuits.  Scaled recipe down for 6 servings and only got 4 good sized biscuits so made another batch and got 8.  Baking time is way to low.  Took double time to bake and they don't get very brown on top so brushed the butter mixture on to make them browner.  On the jiffy box it states 425 for regular biscuits.  Didn't know if the difference w/the cheese needed the lower temp but I did bump up my oven just to get them done and they didn't burn.  I had to add extra everything to make these taste anything like the RL biscuits.  They were not dry, nice and fluffy, but added garlic powder to the mix as well as the butter mixture, and added dried onion flakes to batter as well.  Still needed something.  Used up all the butter mixture.  With tweeking, they were good.

This is pretty close to Red Lobster biscuits, I did follow the advice of others and add 1 tsp. of each seasoning to the batter as well as the butter mixture.

I made these brushed with the new fat free butter spread by Promise. They weren't as greasy. If you are looking to cut fat and calories I think it is worth the change.

The second time I made them I count down the garlic powder and onion powder a bit-seemed too strong. Also doubled the cheese-were excellent.

Great flavor and very light and tender biscuits!  Added garlic powder for extra kick and extra cheese to the mix.  Had to bake approx 18 minutes, and only the bottoms browned.  I added extra spices to the melted butter and the mixture turned out "curdled" looking.  Not sure why, but that did not seem to effect the taste.

Mine were dry and hard. I halved the recipe and it still made a dozen. It was my fault. These don't get brown looking and you need to adhere to the time in the recipe. I baked them for twice the time called for. I also had a friend brush them with the butter and she was awfully dainty with it and had butter leftover. Slather it on and use it all up. Anyway I learned what not to do next time.

My boyfriend ate more of these than the main meal.  He said they're even better than Red Lobster's.  (I used Reduced Fat Bisquick and you couldn't even tell the difference- they were delicious!)

My husband really liked these but I thought they were lacking a bit; I would have given this recipe a 3 star if not for the hubby.  If found that the topping was tasty but the biscuit itself was pretty bland.  When I make these again I'm planning on trying other reviewer's suggestions and adding a bit of garlic powder and extra cheese to the biscuit mix.

Me and my family just couldn't stop eating these! We loved them! It is so easy to prepare, and comes out actually devine. In the melted butter sauce that you put on the biscuits when done, I added some paprika to that, and then brushed it on. The paprika added a smoky kick that really made these to die for! Will definatly try again!!!

I have never been a big fan of biquick or biscuit mixes.  They just don't taste as good.  So I used my favorite plain biscuit recipe and added the "extras": cheese, garlic & onion powder, & parsley.  My husband & I both liked these.  They were a nice change.

I cut the recipe in half since 10 biscuits is enough for my family of 5.   EXCEPT, I didn't reduce the cheese.  I used a shredded 4 cheese mix leftover from a taco dinner, skipped the salt per other's reviews, and this turned out great.

My husband really liked these, but I thought they were bland. I love the ones at Red Lobster, but these just didn't come out the same for me. My husband is Australian so he doesn't know the difference. I think I'll make them again, but I'll make them smaller and with full fat cheese rather than reduced fat. The word bland is the only thing I can think of, but I'll work on it. It gets a 4 because hubby thought they were great and wouldn't let me throw out the rest of the dough.

These biscuits are very good.  I am not usually big fan of biscuits but I will definitely make these again.  Quick and easy to make which is always a plus.  The only alteration I made was to add some extra cheese than the recipe called for.

These are just excellent!  I took suggestions from previous reviewers (add more cheese, cut the salt, bake longer) and am glad that I did.  Then I made notes on the recipe.  I always wondered how that famous seafood restaurant made their biscuits and now I know.  Thanks!

Very Good biscuits!! I guessed at the amount of cheese and mill add more neext time. Also I think I made them a little bigger, next time i will make them smaller so that they cook better. We will be making these again, Thanks!!

These were so good and extremely easy to make.  Just as good as Red Lobster's, if not better.  I only used one sheet pan which held 15 large biscuits.  To make the smaller ones I'd need to use two pans.  No one's complaining about the larger version.  Definitely a make again recipe.

This is wonderful...just like the restaurant's.  When I presented these biscuits at the table no one believed that they were actually homemade.  
An alternative serving method... skip the butter and seasons and serve as a yummy breakfast biscuit.  Either way, these are a quick and easy complement waiting to happen.  

Thanks for sharing.

Very good - we really enjoyed these with our potato soup.  I must have not had the dough quite stiff enough, as my biscuits spread out and were fairly flat.  They still tasted great.  Will make often.

I have made these before, and I though this was the same recipe, but it wasn't.  These were too dry for my taste.  I don't know what went wrong, but I will keep looking for my old recipe.

Taste wise it was yummy...however the dough should be cooked longer than the recipe calls for.  And because I left it in the oven for a bit more time they burned a bit.  This is also something that needs to be eaten immediately or else it gets pretty cold.  But it was yummy!

I haven't eaten in the famous seafood restaurant chain in several years, so I can't say how these biscuits compare to theirs.  Nevertheless, I thought they were very good.  The dough seemed a little soft to me and the biscuits flattened somewhat as they baked.  They also needed longer than the given baking time.  Although some other reviewers said they needed additional salt and garlic, I personally think they need less.  Still, they were good and I will probably make them again.

unbelievably delicious. I find that making them with water produces a fluffier biscuit and making them with milk makes a more dence one that I don;t enjoy as much.

I halved the recipe and made 8 biscuits. It took about 25 mins to bake (which was quite frustrating when serving dinner and having to get up every 5 mins to check on them). Though very good, they did not taste like Red Lobster's at all - too dense and doughy, not at all light. The basting-with-butter at the end just left them greasy as it was not absorbed at all. Again, tastes ok, but I'll keep searching for a better Cheddar Bay recipe.

My guests gave them two thumbs up.

I don't know what I did wrong.  There are only two of us, so I cut the recipe down to make five biscuits. They came out flour-y tasting. I just noticed someone used Bisquick Buttermilk mix - I used the "easy biscuit mix" recipe on this site.

I'm eager to try again if someone can give me any tips.

These biscuits always come out tasting great and are a real crowd pleaser.  I'm a big cheese fan, so I double the cheese and it still comes out very good.

I try to avoid RL for seafood, but have had these bisuits once before. Stuck to the recipe, except, substituted milk for water...made 'em bigger (drop-style biscuits, not rolled), baked 'em a little longer, did the butter thing, but left out the salt. Not bad...light...airy...rich. A nice compliment to a steamed crab dinner for New Year's. If you want a different type of bread with your meal,and have some Bisquick and sharp cheddar cheese lying around, try these.

This is pretty good. I read all the reviews and did as many of them had suggested and mixed the spices in with the dough. These were quick and easy and will probably be a regular on the monthly menu.

These were great! Made them exactly as the recipe said.Maybe an ounce more of cheese and maybe a few minutes more in the oven. The parchment paper was a great idea as well!!

These were wonderful.  I also added extra cheese (sharp) fresh parsley and garlic powder.  My entire family loved these and I will pass on the recipe.

A bit dry inside, but cutting open and buttering the inside when it's on your plate isn't much of a hassle.  Goes VERY well with homemade chowder, and leftovers are great! All in all, this recipe is a definite keeper.

Awesome!!  My little 2 year old helped me make these (very easy) and entered them in the fair.  She won a Reserved Sweepstakes ribbon on them!!  They are wonderful.  Nice and light and fluffy.  I did add a bit more cheese because I love cheese.  WOW!!!

These were okay but certainly not worthy of a five star rating.  Easy to make though.  Probably won't bother making them again.

Since I did not have baking mix (ie Bisquick), I improvised on this recipe. I made the recipe for Baking Powder Biscuits (submitted by "Anne"), then added the cheese that this Cheddar Bay recipe called for. Once out of the oven, I brushed on the butter, garlic and parsley mixture. They turned out great! My family LOVES the biscuits at Red Lobster, and now we won't have to go there to get this great taste. Thanks, Cookie for this great recipe!

These are delicious and so incredibly easy to make! They take no time at all. I didn't have garlic salt, so I just mixed some table salt w/ garlic powder and sprinkled a little on. My fiance must have eaten 4 of them! These will be making lots of future appearances on our table!

Very good biscuits! They are reminiscent of Red Lobster biscuits--though not exactly.  Nonetheless, they were very excellent and kept their freshness the next day too.

These are the greatest!  I thought for sure I'd done something wrong because the dough was so thick, but they turned out absolutely perfect.  I didn't have onion or garlic powder so I omitted the salt and used onion and garlic salt.  They were still wonderful.  My husband even called his best friend to tell him I'd duplicated the biscuits from their "favorite restaurant".  Now, if only I could replicate the shrimp scampi...

Awesome!  I used colby/jack (I had run out of cheddar!)  These tasted just like biscuits at many southern restaurants.  5 Stars!

These were GREAT!  Mine taste just like that famous restaurant kind. My family and especially my son LOVE IT. So much so, I had to make them 2 nights in a row.

These were delicious and so very easy. I think they are better than the seafood chain's.

My whole family LOVED this recipe!! I added the seasonings in the biscuit mix and skipped the parchment paper.  They tasted just like Red Lobster and didn't stick to my greased pan.  My 4 year old couldn't get enough of them, so I know I'll be making these over and over again. Not as good cold, so try to eat them when they're fresh.

Very quick and yummy!  I use a little less garlic powder in the butter mixture than the recipe calls for.  Definately tastes just like the Red Lobster cheddar bisquits.  Great recipe!!!
