For all the first time makers, let me tell you... the more cassava added, the thicker the cake.  The less, it will be more softer and fluffy more custard like.  4 cups make a thick cake.  2 cups will make it really fluffy.  When grating fresh cassava, one pound will yield about 1.5 cups and the grated product will have a mushy consistency.  I added 1/2 cup of dried sweetened coconut flakes.  It is better to add jarred macapuno strings, or fresh coconut.  It is also better to reserve a couple tablespoons of condensed milk and coconut milk to add as a topping at the last 15 minutes of baking.  Thanks so much for the formula my friend.  Very delish.

You have the ingredients wrong. You say 2 cups of cassava, but for that much liquid you need 4 cups.

This is my first time making cassava. I used two 14oz. packages of frozen grated cassava, thawed and drained, it looked about 4 cups. Baking time was about 1 hr 15 min. The top was already browned, so I didnt bother broiling it. We love it! Thanks for a great, simple recipe!

I am always tempted to buy the bakery items at the Asian grocery store, but are too afraid to eat them for sanitary reasons.  Don't know how old they are and how long they have been sitting at room temperature at the store.  Also, all the food color we don't need to consume.  

This recipe allows me to enjoy Asian desert made simply at home. It stays soft and chewy warm or cold. I was able to get a bag (2lb./32oz) of frozen yucca at a local Indian grocery store.  I thawed, rinsed and drained the yucca in a colander.  In a blender, I placed the yucca, 12 oz of water instead of evaporated milk, coconut milk and process until smooth.  If you do not have a large blender (Vitamix), you may need to do two batches.  In a large bowl, whisk together the egg and condensed milk.  I also added 1/4 cup of sugar and 1/2 cup of unsweetened coconut flakes. Pour the yucca mixture into the bowl and blend them together well.  Coat a 3 quart casserole pan with non-stick spray.  Bake for 1 hour and 10 mins. until the edge is golden.  Will make this again, can't stop eating until my stomach is bloated.

Yucca and cassava are the same.  Goya makes a very nice frozen cassava product.  Found it at Wegman's food stores, not sure if you have them near you or not.  You can probably contact your store manager and request that they order some from Goya for you!  I used theirs for a very good cassava pie just a couple of months ago.

I always use fresh cassava (approx 3 lbs). I peel then grate it...I soak it in water then drain it and do it over again.. at the end I strain with with a cheesecloth and another cloth napkin and squeeze as much as I can..I am left with a nice white, dried paste. This cake taste best when it's fresh out of the over. I tried another recipe from a well-known/rated Vietnamese book and immediately came back to this one - why mess with perfection? Thanks for sharing!

I followed all measurements plus I added 3T of agave nectar for my sweet tooth. Delicious soft cassava cake--the way I like it. Simple to make the very first time I tried.

I followed the recipe but added shredded young coconut and only half of the coconut milk. It's delicious and we live it so much that my husband wants it served every  week. We eat it topped with ice cream. Yummy!

Perfect cake for the gluten intolerant! It takes about two cassava roots to make a little more than two cups. My local Stater Brother's carries it fresh. I peeled, cut, food processed and then Ninja'd the cassava to a paste. I used almost three cups. I did not have a liquid problem but put it in a colander anyway. Great taste and texture. It was firm like Jell-O. Taste even better cold the next day. I did the math, if the cake is divided into 12 pieces, its caloric value is about 280 calories per. Thanks Lola!

Great for beginners. I used two bags of frozen cassava (Asian store) and followed the rest of the ingredients. I baked it for one hour and 10 minutes.  Not bad at all!

Marty, you got it wrong. One package of Yucca is 16oz which makes 2 cups. This is the same recipe my family uses and its perfect. remember . There are so many different ways of making this just as for anything else. 2 cups is right.

Great easy recipe; not too sweet, perfect consistency with these adjustments: used a 28oz. bag of cassava, and a 12oz. jar of macapuno (young coconut strings). Baked for 1 hour 15 mins in a greased 13x9 glass rectangle. Broiled the top the last 5 mins & cooled down overnight.  DELISH! Thanks for sharing!

Cut into 4 inch logs, score the tough skin lengthwise every inch or so, peel off sections between the score lines, cut each log into halves lenthwise and remove the tough center veins. Process the clean pieces in a juicer to remove the liquid and keep about 2 cups of the fine paste to use in the recipe. The texture is more like bread pudding and is rather gummy. The flavor is excellent though.

Not worth the effort!  I'm all for cooking from scratch - I make my own pastas, pie crusts, even bagels - but this cake took forever to make and made a huge mess out of my kitchen.  Between the washing, peeling, chopping, processing, soaking, draining, repeating, squeezing out, etc. and then biting into a gritty, barely sweet mush, what a disappointment.  I even added extra cassava like the other reviewers recommended but this was hopeless.

This was an excellent recipe. I used frozen root from the local Asian market. It's much easier than grating, and tastes more consistent that fresh grated root. I wouldn't add less than 2 cups of the root (1-16oz package of the frozen). You can play on the consistency with arrowroot (cornstarch if no arrowroot). I added 1 teaspoon of arrowroot and it was perfect. My fiance is Filipino, and I know authentic cassava cake has toasted cheese on top. I used a little grated cheddar, a couple tablespoons of reserved coconut milk and condensed milk, and browned on broil for 3-5 minutes. It was absolutely delicious and decadent.  Add coconut flakes to the batter if you like. I like to eat mine warm, but my fiance prefers room temp or cold.

Batter seemed a bit runny to me when I made it so I added 3/4 cup of coconut flour to the mix which made the cake a bit thicker in consistency. I think the liquid to dry ingredients is a bit off in this recipe.

I give it a four because it reminded my wife of her childhood, she is Filipino, but it definitely needs 4 cups of the cassava and an extra can of sweetened condensed milk poured over the top. Not friendly to you waistline but definitely a treat.

I used turbo broiler for this. It works just as perfectly. This recipe is so easy and very cheap. I grated the cassava myself. Since there's so much water I squeezed out the excess liquid to make two cups of dried grated cassava. I also added 1 cup of coconut meat to give it more texture. Heavenly. I've been making it for pot lucks and my family and friends love it!

Recipe is fine. But the food processor shreds the cassava too thick. So I will transfer the shreds to the blender, extra step. You need paste consistency b4 bake. Or else you will taste shreds in your cake. And you don't want that...

Super delicious! Used 3 packs of frozen cassava, drained in a colander for 30 minutes. Yielded 1:9x13 and 1: 8x8. Used the same amount of can products. Added 1 jar of macapuno (young coconut in syrup) did not drain. Lined pans with Parchment  paper for easy cleanup. Baked for 1 hr 45 mins @350 degrees. Last 20 minutes added a thin layer of condense milk. Super easy and freaking delicious!!

I stuck with the recipe butI used three cups instead of two or four  of grated yucca and the cake had a nice consistency-any more would have been too much.  Also, I baked it for 90 minutes in order for it to set. Next I’ll experiment with panela and grated coconut and maybe do one in chocolate...

This is perfect. It's not to sweet and has the perfect texture. It's so yummy!

I read some reviews before making it. They are right about the measurements. However, it still a good recipe. Adding some more sugar if you want it sweeter will be ok. I  like the custard that formed on top.

Tried this for the first time, and it turned out exactly as my wife remembers. Really a very good recipe.

I really wanted to like this recipe,    but the flavour was off.  The condensed milk taste  overpowered the rest of the ingredients. Took 45 minutes on my convection oven to bake. The texture was right, something like bread pudding.

I made this recipe twice from scratch and then my flip friend told me they sold grated cassava in the frozen section of some asian grocery stores. So much easier now. The problem with buying the roots too was that sometimes I would end up with bad roots. Apparently you're not supposed ot use them if they have black spots when you cut them open. Most of the time, I'd have to buy 3x the amount I wanted to use because i'd end up throwing out 2/3 of it.

I'm only able to find the liquid ingredients in cans that were ±1-2 oz what the recipe called for but they totalled to the same amount of liquid. I'm still really happy with the taste.

Although I thought it was good, my family did not.  It was interesting to try, but I don't think I would make it again.
