I made this last night for dessert and LOVED it. I had too much heavy cream in my fridge and I wanted to use it up so I substituted heavy cream for the milk. It is excellent, I highly recommend it. If I could afford the calories I'd make it again tonight! Last night I had my first serving with ice cream and that was superb, the second serving I had on it's own, also superb!

What a different take on bread pudding, read the other reviews and this is what I came up with. Take the milk and butter and cook it on the stove as directed, let it cool while preparing the other items on the list, them pour the milk mixture in the rhubarb mixture, then pour all on top of the bread( left the crust on) let sit a little to soak in. I mixed up some of the rhubarb to go into the bread. Wow is this good, will make this all summer.

I wanted to make this bread pudding more like a breakfast than a dessert, so I reduced the sugar to 1 cup and omitted the brown sugar on top.  It was still pleasantly sweet.  I also used 1 cup of egg substitute instead of eggs.  Overall, this is a great recipe.  It tastes good and uses up lots of rhubarb!  My family gave it a thumbs up.

Very, very good!  A bit sweet for my taste so would use a 1/4 cup less sugar next time.  I used leftover whole wheat hotdog buns that I toasted in the oven before using, in the place of the bread.

FYI...8 slices of bread = about 4 cups!  Love the idea of combining the rhubarb mixture with the milk mixture and then pouring over the bread....less messy and distributes the rhubarb better! Yummy!

I did this with whole wheat bread and splenda and it really turned out.  Awesome taste and fun combo.  Will do it again.  Used 4 eggs after reading reviews.

Excellent!  Made myself a small gluten free version.  Divided all ingredients by four, but used 3 slices of gluten free white artisan bread.  One piece was the heal, and it worked fine.  Low on milk, so used some half and half creamer.  Added vanilla and a bit more cinnamon.  Baked in a 9 inch x 5 inch bread pan at 350F for 25 minutes (but checked after 20 minutes and every five thereafter).  Removed from oven when set and golden.  Finished result was about two inches thick.  So yummy!

I did not remove the crusts, and added 1/2 tsp of vanilla. This turned out perfectly! I will increase the vanilla to 1 tsp, and increase cinnamon next time - and there will be a next time.

For years we have only used rhubarb in wonderful pies. This week we tried this recipe, finding to equal any of our famous pies! After enduring long hard winters we enjoy watching rhubarb begin growing even while frost is in the ground below. Northern gardeners are truly blessed by this plant, and this recipe!

The recipe says to stir the egg â€“ rhubarb mixture into the bread in the prepared pan. Did that, and saw that all the pan greasing was eliminated if you do it that way. Mine is still in the oven but I'm not going to be surprised if it sticks. Should mix the milk-sugar mixture into the bread in a bowl, and then add the rhubarb-egg mixture, and pour it all into the prepared pan. I saved out the butter from the recipe and adding to the brown sugar with some nuts for a streusel topping.
