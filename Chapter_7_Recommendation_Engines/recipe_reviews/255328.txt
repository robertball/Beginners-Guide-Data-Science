I just made this after watching the show. As I was making it, I was thinking there must be something wrong. It didn't look like it was on the show. I kept asking myself, this is a lot of spices, shouldn't the tablespoons be teaspoons? I can't see any spices on the corn in the picture. My corn was completely covered. It had some good flavors, but overpowering. Please let me know if the measurements are correct, or am I doing something wrong?

Lots of ingredients going on here but they worked well together.  Only omission was the onion powder. Will make again!

This was fun, different and delicious! Everything complimented each other perfectly...a great balance of flavors and textures. Yes, there is a long list of ingredients, but it is still very easy to make and well worth the effort. I will be making this again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

The refried beans were my favorite part of this recipe...so flavorful. I wouldn't have thought to season them, but it really made a difference. And the homemade salsa really topped it all off!
