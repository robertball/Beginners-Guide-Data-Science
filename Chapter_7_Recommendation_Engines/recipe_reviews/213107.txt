We make this a bit differently. Herring, layer of potatoes, shredded beets and shredded carrots. Repeat. Each layer divided by mayo, garlic,  salt and pepper. Top layer is boiled grated egg and on the very top is shredded cheddar cheese. No onions. Served in a glass container, awesome colors and fantastic taste!

My darling and I ran into a 2.50$ pack of smoked herring in the store, sniffed it and were transfixed. We had some leftovers of potato salad (with onion, lemon and vinegar) from the previous day, so I invested 1$ in a can of beets and microwaved the remaining baby carrots that were counting days on the bottom of our fridge. As the herrings were hellishly salty, I soaked them in water for 20-30 min and only used three pieces. I had some sour cream, so I added it to one of the potato layers. I also boiled two eggs and added them on top, with a thin layer of mayo, a pinch of dried parsley and two (leftover) lemon slices for decoration. I haven't added any more salt nor pepper, except for what was already in the potato salad and herrings. It was DIVINE. I will make this many times in the future.
Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

To remove excess salt herring, it must be cleaned and put it on 30 minutes in the milk.
And to remove the bitterness of the onion, chop it and place it in the boiling water.
Even sometimes add a thin layer of sweet-sour apple. It's not for everybody.

It is strange that this recipe has onions in it. I am from the Baltic States where people eat a lot of this "salad" and we never use onion. Instead of pure mayonnaise we use a mix of mayonnaise and sour cream, not so fat and the taste is much better and the salad juicier. Besides- when layering is done we put crushed boiled eggs on top (they should look like grated). Fresh chopped dill can be added, too.

This "Russian Beet Salad with Herring" was one of the most delicious and beautiful salads that I have ever had. I wish that I could give it 10 stars! I made mine with BUBBIES herring, which I understand is a high-end brand. I used only the onion that was packed with the herring (although I chopped it finely) since I don't especially like raw onion in salad. I also garnished my salad with hard-boiled eggs and herbs as per Sasha's photo. I can hardly wait to make this again! Thank you Evgeniya for sharing your recipe.

My Grandmother makes a similar salad like this, she says it's Slovenian, but I'm thinking she borrowed it from Russia.  I've got a great recipe for Borscht Moskovsky  that I made to go along with this.

Very yummy though you do have to like beets and herring. I used herring that came with onions in sour cream. I sauteed my onions for fear of a strong raw onion taste that I am not fond of. Took some of akmommy23's advice to put mayo, salt, and pepper between each set of repeated layers and also added layers of hard-boiled egg. I think adding chopped walnuts or another very oily nut would be great.

I made this recipe several times before I realized I was using pickled herring instead of herring in oil. It is amazing with pickled herring! I rinse the herring well and pat it dry before coursely chopping the larger pieces. I use the onions that come in the pickled herring, rinsed and dried. I also like combining mayo and yogurt (or sour cream) instead of all mayo, but once I was out of mayo and used tzatziki instead. It went so will with the tang of the pickled herring.

I forgot to cut the herring in to bites sizes... But my husband being Russian loved it.. I think I would do it a little different next time.

Per others' suggestions, I spread a mixture of 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 mayo between each layer (which came to about a cup of each). I bought herring filets packaged in oil with onion so the onions were already soft and mild. I chopped the filets to match the onion size and spread together for the first layer. I also sprinkled garlic powder, salt and pepper on each veggie layer. It was a hit with my Russian family.

Excellent holiday salad. My American husband loves it. I do layers in slightly different order: potatoes, herring, onions, carrots, beets then repeat. My American neighbor thinks it goes well with wine, beer or any kind of liquor, so I make a small dish just for her around the holidays.

I'm not Russian myself, but my wife's family is from Ukraine and I just fell in love with this salad. I make it almost on a weekly basis and it's great for those who love fish, and if you don't, you can make it with chopped chicken breasts or thighs instead of the herring.
