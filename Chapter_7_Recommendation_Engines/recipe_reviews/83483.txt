Fabulous!  My only suggestion would be that I had a LOT of bread mixture left over and alos a ton of sauce for the amount of chicken.  I definitely could have breaded and cooked up twice as much.  This would make a great appetizer as well and was even good cold.  I loved the fruity-nutty combination.  I love different and delicious and this definitely fit the bill!  A keeper.  Thank you for the entry!

this is ok... but the title should noth say coconut first... for a really good coconut chicken, type in coconut chicken and find the one that kraft has on here .. it is excellent if soaked in ceam of coconut before cooking... that recipe with this crunchy fruit sauce would be excellent!!!!

A great recipe. Yummy!!! I had some orange marmalade on hand and used it instead of the apricot and it was delicious. The sauce was a bit to sweet for me, that's the only reason for the 4 stars.

This is very good. Easy to prepare and the sauce is great. I plan to make the sauce and use it with a coconut shrimp recipe I got from this site. A keeper for sure.

this was very good and easy to make.  instead of the coleslaw dressing, i used fat free honey dijon salad dressing.  I also used some chopped pecans in the coconut/bread crumb mixture.

This is so good!!! I made mine with chicken tenders and I used Panko bread crumbs. The sauce makes alot, I will cut down the recipe for it next time. The sauce does compliment the chicken very well though!!

This was awesome!  I used the Light Marzetti Slaw Dressing, which worked really well with this recipe.

I took the advice of another reviewer and added garlic powder, onion powder and ginger to the breadcrumbs.  I also added salt, pepper and cayenne to give it a kick.  I will make this one again.

Coleslaw dressing, pecans, apricot jelly, and cucumbers??  Never in my wildest dreams did I think these 4 ingredients mixed together would make such a fabulous sauce!  Pair that delicious sauce with the coconut chicken and you have got a meal worthy of company.  Don't let the ingredients scare you! This would work as an appetizer also!  Oh, I almost forgot - spray your pan well so the coconut chicken doesn't stick.

I made it for myself so I had to reduce the recipe. I changed the preserves from Apricot to Orange marmalade because I don`t care for apricots also I added a about a 1/4tsp. of garlic powder, onion powder,& ginger to the bread crumbs & coconut...Too me this gave the chicken just an extra amount of flavor & I believe with orange marmalade the dipping sauce wasn`t as sweet....too me it was excellent!!

The flavor was good on this but I expected a bit more crunchy crust. I even did them on a rack. The dipping sauce was very good but not sure it was the best choice for coating the chicken in first. Something about the chicken seemed bland.

Based on everyone's reviews I made one major change and it turned out Delicious! I marinated the chicken in Coconut Milk all day before I did anything!! It was soooooo great! Loved this recipe.

This recipe was delicious!  My family loved it.  I brought it to work for lunch and let some co-workers try just one bite (didn't want to share too much of it!!) and they couldn't wait to get the recipe.  I think I'll try a mixture of Apricot and Pineapple preserves for a slightly different flavor the next time I make this...but the original sauce recipe is quite delicious just the way it is!

This recipe was truly yummy!  I will make this again and again! A little more labor intensive than I usually like but worth it!  My husband loved it, saying, This is restaurant quality!  Definitely a break from the tried and true.  I made this exactly as the recipe is written.  I liked the idea another reviewer had about making it as a salad.  I will definitely try that.

I think it was just too sweet because of all the dressing. If I made it again I would probably not make the fruit sauce.

The chicken itself was nice but I will not be making it again.

Very easy to make.  Chick is very moist and delicious.  I used a pastry brush to apply the slaw dressing.  Cooking time should be adjusted to the size of cut chicken pieces.  Next time I will line pan with foil as there was some sticking of coating to pan.  Did not make fruit sauce.

I gave it 4, my husband would have given it a 3.  I thought the chicken by itself was kind of blah but it was pretty good with the sauce, althought really fattening!!  I will try with red fat dressing if I can find it.  I would season the chicken like someone else mentioned before breading it!

I'm not one to measure, so the amounts might not have been exact, but this was delicious!  I had farfalle pasta on the side and ended up mixing it up into a wonderful dinner salad.  The sauce is awesome.

Outstanding - Well worth 5 stars. Easy to make and the sauce is delicious.  Without the sauce it's just Chicken nuggets.  Will make this one many times.  Thanks for the experience.

Very yummy - but because it's so sweet I would prefer to serve it as an appetizer in the future rather than as a main dish.

The sauce was good, but the coconut breading needed help...it just didn't tast like coconut. Maybe instead of dipping the chicken in the dressing, it should have been dipped in coconut milk, to enhance the flavor.

I liked the idea of coconut on the chicken, which did give it a nice crunch, but this was very sweet, and I didn't care for the taste the marzeti's left on the chicken.  Won't be making again.

This was fun to make, but I didn't care for it.  The chicken was too bland by itself, but I did not like how the fruit sauce and chicken coconut flavors tasted together.  The sauce might be good with something else instead.

This was fantastic!  My husband said it was the tastiest Chicken dish he has ever had.  He made a mistake and bought peach preserves instead of Apricot but it was still WONDERFUL!! The Chicken was so tender and juicy.

Tried it last night!  It was great, but I would HIGHLY recommend greasing the pan before placing chicken on it, as it stuck to the pay, leaving a lot of the good stuff behind!

I thought this sounded great... but it was pretty bad.  We did not care for the sauce at all.  It was too sweet.  And the first few pieces of chicken taste ok, but it gets worse as you eat it.  I won't be making this one again.

made this for tonights dinner and it was a great hit!!  it was easy to make and delish to eat.  at the meat department in my local supermarket, i bought chicken stir fry strips.  doubled the amount to 2 lbs and doubled the bread crumb/coconut mix.  did not double the sauce amounts.  came out perfect!!  try it - you'll love it!!

This was wonderful!  The sauce was tangy and the chicken was sweet.  I loved how the cucumber gave the sauce an interestingly surprising flavor.  My 10 year old was not a fan (a little too "weird"), but my husband and I loved it.  I will definately make again and pass the recipe on to others.

I fixed this recipe last night and it was awesome, but better yet was the sauce.  Very enjoyable, easy to prepare, will serve in the future.

my husband made it and had some trouble, so that may be part of the problem, but it was just not as great as I was expecting. Not bad, just not fantastic.

My family really enjoyed the chicken!  My  husband wasn't crazy about the sauce though.
