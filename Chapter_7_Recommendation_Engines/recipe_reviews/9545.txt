I've had this recipe sitting in my recipe box for years now, scared of making it, and not sure about what kind of crackers to use! I finally bough the original ritz crackers, and said what the heck, I'll just make it and see! I was afraid it was going to be too salty or something. 
Let me tell you, it came out awesome!! I cannot believe how much it tastes like apple pie, but better! My mom tasted it not knowing it didn't have apples, and said," this is a great pie, especially cuz the apples have caramelized, and THAT's how I like them to taste!" The topping was also really good, crispy and chewy at the same time. It was perfect warm or even after it cooled down completely. If I cut down on the sugar next time however, I think it would be even more delicious! Great recipe if you need to make really good apple pie and you don't have apples, but should't be made too often, just because it is not as healthy!

I have been making mock apple pie for many years at Thanksgiving time.  This has to be the easiest recipe that I have tried.  Thank you Brenda for adding this recipe to allrecipe.com

I had a bunch of crackers left over and I thought they would go to waste. This was the perfect answer. Loved it. Thought it tasted like apple pie. Tasted a bit and gave the two pies away as a Valentine's Gift. Added a bit of lemon juice and added more cinnamon during the boiling process. We didn't have enough Ritz crackers for the topping so we used cheddar and peanut butter sandwich crackers. This made it even better! It gave it a saltier tangier kick that only that sandwich cracker can do. It reminded me of a salt water taffy type candy. Yummy. I would definitely make it again.

So, I made this recipe this weekend because it intrigued me. It was great to see my father's reaction when I told him it wasn't apple pie, but cracker pie! It was a great experiment, but really nothing more. After being in the refrigerator overnight, the filling thickened up to look even more like apple pie. It tastes like a decent pie, but I think the topping was a little too salty with the additional Ritz crackers.  I would recommend making another streussel topping or adding a top crust instead. After the first piece of "apple pie," I could not eat anymore because the thought of cracker pie was somewhat sickening. It is a great joke to play, however, and it may be a great gift to give unexpecting relatives.

Great pie. This was very fun to make - as the crackers were boiling, I was delighted by how much they smelled like apples. Other than adding about 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon to the syrup (I love cinnamon) and using less of the topping than called for (I'm a cheapskate; didn't want to use all that butter) I followed the recipe exactly. By the way, as another reviewer noted, DON'T stir the crackers after putting them in the syrup. Just plop them in and leave them be for 5 minutes.

I have to give this recipe 5 stars for pure genius! I made it as a experiment and I can't imagine making it again because truly, why would you want to take the apples out but it was so much fun when people kept wandering in after I had made it, smelling the apple pie, and then having them comment on how great it was, and then watching their shcoked expressions after revealing the truth. Priceless! Probably the most fun I've EVER had cooking something, and I always have a lot of fun cooking. Tips: Make sure the crumbs on top are really crushed, or just go ahead and use another pie crust. If anything were to give the pie away, it would be big pieces of crackers on top. Additionally, 35 minutes was a little too much in my oven so make sure you check while it cooks. Cornstarch would be great(about a TB or so) to thinken it up because it totally fell apart when we cut it. The only one who thought the pie was fishy was my mom( a highly critical foodie) who thought that I had made the pie with applesauce. That's the only fault of the pie; it lacks the chunkiness that real apple pie has and that why I'll stick with the real apples. Plus Ritz crackers aren't really the best for you. But still a fun experiment!

This is one of my favorite recipes I've discovered on this site, and I've found lots of good ones. This tastes, looks, and smells like apple pie. At first this disgusted me but I decided to try it out of curiousity. I keep marveling at how crackers make this recipe. I used Ritz Crackers and followed the instructions exactly. I will definitely make this again. Do not let the ingredients keep you from trying this. It's that good.

My boyfriend is allergic to apples. Weird! Myself, I love apple pie. So I always lamented not being able to make it. But this recipe turned things around completely! He loves it, I love it, this pie is wonderful!

I incorporated this recipe in a lesson for 5th graders about the chemistry of taste. The kids LOVED it, and couldn't believe they were eating crackers.  While the taste and texture are pretty convincing, this pie is no substitute for the real thing. This recipe is fun to make for the novelty of it.

My son had to make a mock apple pie for his math class as they were studying the concept of Pie (3.14). The pies were judged and we won! I don't know why it tastes like an apple pie, but it does. I didn't change a thing to the recipe. Truly delicious! Just made it again for his birthday per his request. This is truly a keeper! Thanks for a great recipe.

Okay...???? This was awsome!!!  when I was boiling the crackers I could kinda see how the "apple" filling was forming...DON'T stir the crackers after you put them in to boil, then slip it into the crust.  This is one you seriously don't have to tell anyone there is no apples in it.  I just told my boys it was an apple pie and they mowed it down!!!

This is better than my apple pie!  I made one and took it to work.  I work in the food industry with chefs and they could not believe there was no apples in this pie.  Everyone has been raving about it all day.  It was even good cold after being in the refrigerator all night.

I have been making apple pies for years so I wasn't expecting much from this recipe.  Boy was I wrong! This recipe is very good and sooooo easy.  It is a little sweet through.  I will be using this again and again!  I also tried the Hot Water Pie Crust I with this and it worked very well.

I still can't believe all those ingredients made such a great pie!!  It was very good!  I did use more crackers than called for in the topping to make the mixture more "crumbly."

I've made this recipe twice, and the family loves it.  However both times the top crust has burned.  I'm not sure if that's due to the high temperature, or if I just need to cook it on the lower rack, but be aware and take caution with the upper crust.

Very simple to make.  A complete surprise.  We figured there was NO WAY it would taste like apple pie.  Boy were we ever wrong!  My husband took it to work and no one could figure out how it was made and insisted on seeing the recipe before they believed him.  We would definitely make this again.  Do serve warm!

What a great idea!  I couldn't believe it tasted just like apple pie!  I put a little extra cinnamon with the 'apples' and a pinch of nutmeg and it was fantastic.  I didn't have the round butter crackers so I used regular saltines broken up a bit and it was still tasty.  Thank you for a really unique recipe!

This recipe has received the best reviews.  I thought it would be funny to make since there are absolutely no apples inside, it intrigued me.  Everyone is convinced that it's apple pie and I also made it pretty by adding a lattice crust top to it.

I am massively impressed!!!  I made this for father's day and didn't mention it was a mock apple pie and everyone was impressed with the taste.

I added a little bit of vanilla during the boiling process, but otherwise the recipe was the same.  Thanks!!!

I have not had this since I was a kid been looking for this recipe for years because I loved it.  Back in the 70's for some reason I do not remember there was a apple shortage and this recipe was being made everywhere.  Thank you for having it here.

Eh, I did not enjoy this in the slightest. I thought it tasted too salty and all I could think about while eating it was all those stale crushed crackers. Ended up tossing it.

a good pie, but not a good substitute for the real thing. careful with the boiling the crackers- i followed another reviewer's advice and didn't stir them (in order to get that "apple" appearance), and mine burned!

My new guilty pleasure!  You would swear there were apples in this pie by the aroma, texture and flavor.   Even though it's basically a cracker pie, it doesn't freak me out because it tastes so good. It is not too sweet, not at all, and the topping is the perfect blend of salty, crunchy sweetness. I wouldn't change a thing, except maybe the picture, since it shows a lattice crust top which this pie does not have.

Mom made these when I was a kid, I loved them over the years I have taken two wives and several girl friends to dinner at moms when this pie was served ....all thought I was crazy when I told them while they were eating it that iy was not made from apples. Now still liveing alone at 60 I made it for myself and it is still GREAT!  ! ! O:-) But NOT AS GOOD AS MOM MADE IT!  HAHaha

Oh my goodness! The reaction I got from this was amazing! My father and fiance' were amazed that no apples were used in this recipe. It was funny seeing their reaction when they took a bite. Interestingly enough..my dad saw this recipe in an issue of Mother Earth News years and years ago. He said he always wanted to try it, but the Ritz crackers seemed too odd. This was extremely easy to make and came out beautifully!

The filling tasted more like applesauce to me, but wow... how do you get apple flavor from those ingredients? It was more fascinating than appetizing, however. The fact that crackers were made to taste like fruit kinda squicked me out.

I am a 72 year old recent widower trying my hand at cooking
Remember this from a while back and thought I would try it. 
Easy to make and tastes really good. Fooled some friends when I took it for a party. Next time I may add some walnuts or pecans to the topping.

This was really fun to make and was taste magic. I did not put a crust on top of the crumble because that didn’t seem necessary. Everyone who tried it loved it. The recipe says to serve it warm, but I thought it was just as good after it had been refrigerated.

I had the original recipe from the Nabisco box, but somehow it became lost  over the years.  Next time I use this recipe, I will try using less water and more vinegar.  I think that will help give it more "apple" flavor....otherwise it was fine.

This was SO much fun to make with my kids. We home school and this was a very fun experiment and easy enough the kids 13,10 and 5 we able to make it on their own. 
    After reading reviews we did make some tweeks. We added another tablespoon of fresh squeezed lemon, and a little more cinnamon. We did not add the extra crackers in the brown sugar mixture since we read it was too much. We actually just did the brown sugar mixture into the "apple" mixture and then did a criss cross pie top. 
      It tasted AHMAZING!!! We could not believe their was no apple in it. Like just SHOCKED! It was fun and now a family favorite! We will make this often, so cheap, so easy, so FUN!

Just made this for my chemistry classes.  Loved  by all!  Very applicable to our topic of acidic and basic salts (the cream of tartar is the workhorse in this lesson)!
I didn't have enough crackers for the crumble, so I substituted 1/2 c flour instead.

I used Ritz "honey butter" crackers cause that's all I had so when my son and husband walked in the house they thought I was making honey buns :)  They gobbled the pie up.  I drizzled about 1 tbsp of butter on the top before I put it in the oven.  Delish

Amazingly simple and delicious!!! I couldnt believe how much it tastes like apple pie, and yet has not one single apple in it. Its warm and crumbly topping is fantastic! A true crowd pleaser and they will be shocked after they finish and you tell them there were NO APPLES IN IT!! ... or you can keep that secret to yourself and tell them you slaved all day.... This one is a KEEPER!!!

My husband's Mom used to make this but hers didn't have the topping he said.  This would have been great even without it, but that crunch and flavor on top really puts it OVER the top!  He loved it even more than what "Mom used to make".  Thanks for sharing!
