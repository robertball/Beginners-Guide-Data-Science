With my changes, this is a 5 star pinto bean recipe.  I changed it up a bit by using chicken broth for the water and just put the dry beans (that had been washed and picked over) into the crockpot.  Cooked on High for about 6 hours, turned down to low for 2 more.  Very tender, no soaking required.  I did add a small onion and salt & pepper.  I mashed the leftovers to make refried beans (no frying needed) for 2 more meals.  So for $1 I'll get 6 meals.  Not too bad using a left over ham bone from a spiral sliced ham.

this recipe has no seasoning to it other than the smoked pork. it needs salt and pepper, garlic, onion and chili powder just to start getting the southern flavors. also the addition of shortening just adds to the fat levels as if the pork isnt enough fat, try smoke pork jowles instead

Pinto beans can also be cooked with a ham hock, salt pork or a big glob of bacon grease.  They should be cooked at a hard boil (adding water as needed) for about 3 1/2 hrs  or until fork tender. When fully cooked, mash a few beans with a potato masher right in the pot to thicken the soup and salt to taste.  Pintos should always be eaten with cornbread and a selection of chopped onion and/or tabasco sauce added to the bowl.  A little hot pepper juice added to the bowl is also very good, if you like it hot and spicy.

I used this basic recipe and the advice from other reviewers and came out with the best pot of beans on the planet!
I used 1 smoked ham hocks, 1 onion, 7 cloves of garlic, and chicken stock. I followed the overnight directions then the next morning I boiled the hamhocks in 6 cups of water then rinsed the beans and put it all (including onions,garlic) in a slow cooker on high for an hour then turned to low for 8hrs until we were ready to eat. So, good!!!!!

Great basic pinto recipe! Smoked neck bones are very salty, don't add salt until you taste the broth.  We liked them as is, great comfort food for us bean lovers...to change the recipe up one might add chopped onion and some garlic maybe a hot pepper or two. Try this one it is a really good recipe.

I love this recipe it's, very easy! If you have kids make sure you get all of the backbones out!! All together they where great! We made cornbread with it also, and i would make it again!
