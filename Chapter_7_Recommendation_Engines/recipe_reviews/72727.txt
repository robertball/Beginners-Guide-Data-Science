This recipe was so easy and absolutely tasty.  Be careful.  The temptation is there to overbake them because they are so soft when they come out of the oven.  The cooled in a few minutes and cut easily.  You won't regret trying this recipe.

My kids loved this and I loved how easy it is!  So, much faster than spooning out individual cookies.

Very easy, and my 8 year old says they are the best cookies I ever made!

If I could give four and a half stars, I would! These cookies were very easy. I loved being able to roll them into logs and cut them after they were cooled. They are perfectly bite-sized that way, too! The only problem I had, which could have been my mistake, not the recipe's, was that the cookies had somewhat of a salty aftertaste. Otherwise, these cookies are phenomenal. I glazed them with the Vanilla Glaze recipe on this site. I will definitely be making these again!

I made these last year for our Christmas Tea at church.  I had 2 requests for the recipe.  They were so wonderful and, yes, addicting!  I have had requests to make them again this year.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I like the ease of rolling out the dough and slicing the cookies later, however, I found the flavor to be a bit bland and these were too soft for my taste.  I was looking for a ginger *snap* cookie.  I gave 3 stars because my son likes the flavor.  He too, thinks they're too soft, even after trying to over bake them.

Love this quici and easy recipe! I don't like using shortening, so I substitute butter. I also drizzle dark chocolate over the cookies before slicing to make them extra special - it's a fantastic flavour combo!
