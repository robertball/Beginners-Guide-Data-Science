I just made this bread however, instead of using tapioca starch, I used gluten free all purpose flour. The results are great. Thanks!

This is a nice bread with a crisp crust which I like.  I followed the measurements exactly and used the correct sized bread pan. The batter overflowed  on to the oven racks and bottom of the oven. The only change  I made was  to substitute honey for aqave syrup. I will make it again but use a larger bread pan.
