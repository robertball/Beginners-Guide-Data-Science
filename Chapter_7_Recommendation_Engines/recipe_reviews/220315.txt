I halved the recipe to use as a side dish to Mediterranean Crusted Chicken (also from this site). I think the 3 hour wait time for the flavors to blend was a bit too much, as by the time we served this, the pasta had soaked up all of the dressing, and the flavors were really lost. I would dress it maybe half an hour before serving next time. We ended up having to add more balsamic, lemon juice and oil to flavor it up before eating.

I had leftover asparagus and eggplant from my yard and didn’t think they would go together.  This recipe brought it all together in a delicious way.  The lemon and vinegar were a great addition.  The only thing I added was a little bit of blue cheese at the end.  I’ll make it again for sure.

It wasn't a hit for my family.
