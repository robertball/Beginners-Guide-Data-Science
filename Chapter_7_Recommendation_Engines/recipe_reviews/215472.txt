One of my favorite fruit salads. To really add a touch of class, drizzle a quality balsamic over the sugar and berries and toss well. Let it sit for 15-20 minutes. Spoon that over vanilla bean ice cream. Completely awesome.

There's nothing like fresh fruit in any combination. You really can't screw it up no matter what you do and if I had a nickel for everytime I made this I'd be rich beyond my wildest dreams! It's great all by itself, mixed with yogurt, added to cereal, or on top of your favorite pound cake!

I eat this combination of berries "ALL THE TIME"!!  The only change I make is to add Red Grapes to the mixture and I use Splenda instead of sugar.  This is a staple in my house and commonly eaten for breakfast, lunch and/or as an accompaniment with dinner.  Yum

I skipped the blackberries (not crazy about them) and just added more raspberries. As is my preference, I sprinkled the fruit with brown sugar rather than white and poured a little cream over each serving in pretty dessert dishes. Easy, elegant and delicious.

This is always good.  I always put a big spoon of sugar free vanilla pudding on top of it.

Wonderful, fresh berries are in all the markets this time of year, so of course, I had to buy them all!  I found this recipe as a way to use them all in one recipe.  I didn’t use the sugar in this, but instead I lightly dressed the berries with some leftover dressing I’d made for my Orzo and Wild Rice Salad.  I also added some fresh pineapple that I had and liked the color contrast it provided.    I served this on some bright, beautiful baby lettuce from Hubs’ garden.  So, if you’ve got berries, this is a good and simple way to use them!

Pretty simple, I think I’ve made this recipe before without knowing it was an actual recipe. Can’t go wrong with a gigantic bowl of fresh fruit!

I'm lucky enough to live in the Pacific Northwest where we have an abundance of berries all summer.  I make this all the time and sometimes mix a bit of fresh mint into the sugar.  I love the mint flavor with the berries but my husband prefers his unadulterated.  It's easy enough to fix both ways.
