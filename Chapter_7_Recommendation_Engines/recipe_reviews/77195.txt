I grew up hating lima beans. But I actually liked this dish. I didn't have tarragon, so I substituted a combination of fennel and anise. Also, I used lima beans cooked from dry. I liked what sauteing did to the flavor and texture of the limas.

I had a can of lima beans that was an "inheritance" from my old roommate.  This looked like the most appetizing way to cook them, and after actually trying the recipe, I think I was right.  I still didn't like it very much, but I'll give you credit for finding a way to make lima beans palatable.

This was one of the BEST pasta dishes that I have had in a long time.  It is VERY easy to make and is done in the time it takes to boil pasta.  If I could have given it 10 stars I would have.  Even my 2 and 4 year old sons ate it and they do not like any veggies.  Yummy!!!!

Admittedly, I didn't actually make the pasta; however, I found this recipe to dress up my lima beans.  I added Lawrey's garlic salt and parmesan cheese (based on this recipe), and they were the best lima beans I've ever eaten.  Will definitely try the complete recipe next time, but will also continue to make the beans this way!

A very quick and easy recipe. Good if you like pasta, want a break from the typical pasta recipes (which I did) but don't want to try something really complicated.  This took very little time to make, is probably very healthy, and tasted very good.  The tarragon, garlic, and the beans complement each other perfectly, especially with Parmesan cheese.

Well I was going for different and found it. Very good too. I love lima beans and I love pasta so it was clearly a good match for my tastes. This was a fantastic meatless dish, Thanks so much. I truly enjoyed this one! I scaled this down for just myself and wished now there had been leftovers.

I made this twice, exactly as written, because I had some tarragon to use up.
It's a decent recipe, but nothing spectacular. Cheese and garlic are always good, though, and I was surprised that just two cloves of garlic went a long way in this recipe. Mainly, the reason I give this 3 and not 4 stars is that, though I like most beans, lima beans are pretty boring to me, even here.

Different and pretty good.  Four stars with five-star potential with some tweaking.  I followed the recipe except I used frozen lima beans (after cooking them about halfway).  With a little more olive oil and a little more garlic, this will definitely be a keeper!

Lovely. I used fresh tarragon as I was looking for recipes that would allow me to use it, plus added half a can of diced tomato and a light sprinkle of crushed red pepper.   
Also I used farfella pasta just because I like it most.
Very satisfying and pretty dish.

I was a little hesitant about using tarragon, because I was not at all familiar with it.  Turns out that I really like the flavor it gives this dish.  I love this recipe and could eat it as a main course!

the taste was good, but my husband and i decided it was better with some tomato sauce. Would say 4 stars, but we both felt like it was not filling at all! after my husband (who is not a big guy) ate the remaining 2 servings, i made myself a pb&j...

I thought this was really good. My husband doesn't like lima beans so I just made some for myself. I didn't really follow the recipe exactly but it turned out great anyway. I'll definately be fixing this one again.

This is a great recipe for something different. I make it with angel hair pasta (since I like thin spaghetti).  It is served in a pasta  bowl with a side salad and homemade garlic bread. MMMMMGOOD

This pasta is good-tasting and easy to make. Lima beans were a nice way to sneak more veggies into our family's diet. I like garlic a lot and wish I had added even more than this recipe calls for.

At first I was skeptical since it was so simple but it was surprisingly delicious! I tweaked it a bit though - added chili flakes, used parsley instead of tarragon. Still great though! Thanks!

Thank you for posting this recipe.  I don't usually like lima beans but I needed a recipe to use up a package of dry lima beans.  Delicious, and so easy.  I had some fresh parsley to sprinkle on and that gave the dish more color.  The next time I buy a package of lima beans it won't be by mistake.
