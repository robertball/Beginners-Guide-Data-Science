I loved this dish! I thought it was very easy and healthy! I only made a few changes....... I added more garlic because my husband and I love it!! I also added fresh mushrooms and a can of diced tomatoes (drained). I used rigatoni instead of shells because thats all I had. I also only used 1/4 cup of sugar due to what others had stated. I simmered it for 1 hr like the recipe said and it turned out wonderful! Iadded low fat parm cheese and that topped it off!!! Great dish I will make again!! 

PS this dish is just as good the next day! (and I am not a "left-overs" type of girl!! Yum!

I decided to make this in an attempt to use up some extra Zucchini we had and wow, I am impressed! Very simple to make and very, very delicious. I didn't add the sugar and only let it simmer for roughly 30 minutes and it came out great. Will definitely be making this again!

This recipe came out pretty good! I only used 1 Tbsp of olive oil, omitted the sugar and the water. There is no reason to add water here, it's much better a nice and thick sauce. I also added some fresh tomatoes, basil and cooked for only 30 minutes because I wanted the vegetables nice and tender. Served over whole wheat pasta shells. Next time I want to try a little more "cheesy", some mozzarella and extra Romano. Thanks for the recipe I will definitely make this again!

This recipe was good, but it had *way* too much sugar in it. It was like eating candied zuchini sprinkled with oregano. I would cut down on the sugar by half, and not simmer for a full hour if I was to make this again. I prefer a little more sauce and there wasn't much left after condensing for  60 minutes.

WOW WAAAAAYYY to much sugar!  I love sugar and have a really big sweet tooth but gosh.  Hubby said he could feel the diabetes starting.  This was super easy to make and would have been really good except for the sugar.  I served it with mini meatballs.

We really enjoyed this! I doubled the recipe and used a bottle of spaghetti sauce in place of the tomato sauce. I omitted the sugar and cut the water down because I wanted it to be thicker. Also, I had some sliced mushrooms to use up, so I threw them in there as well. This was very tasty and hearty, yet light. I will definately be making this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

After reading prior reviews I cut sugar out completely.  Taste was great, but cooking zucchini an hour was too long as it got too mushy.  Next time will do the same thing only cooking 30-45 minutes.

I had already shredded my zucchini before finding this recipe.  I added some chicken which I saut√©ed at the beginning with the onion.  I followed the advice of others and halved the amount of sugar.  The whole family enjoyed and I would definitely make again.

This is fresh tasting, sweet, & spicy - had a hard time stopping myself from getting additional helpings... Instead of the tomato sauce, I used a can of diced tomatoes (undrained) and then only water as needed.  Half the amount of sugar was plenty!  When I have fresh garden tomatoes, I'll use those.

Not bad. Like others, I had lots of zucchini around, and I was tired of making zucchini muffins. I doubled the recipe but only used 2 TBS of oil. I also used a 26-ounce can of spaghetti sauce and a can of diced tomatoes. I omitted the sugar altogether. It was good, but much better when I used an emersion blender to puree some of the zucchini up. I might make it again, I might not. Neither my husband nor my daughter were thrilled, but I did find it a nice change. Thanks for sharing, FABA!

This was pretty good!  I doubled the recipe, but cut down the amount of water to maybe 3/4 cup because we like a thicker sauce.  I also cut the sugar to 1/4 cup total.  I also left the amount of oil the same instead of doubling that.  I added the zucchini last and only simmered it for about 30 minutes.  We like our zucchini to keep a bit of crunch to it.

This turned out good.  I did listen to other reviewers and only put in 1 Tablespoon of sugar and I eliminated the water entirely.

I fixed this for 20 people.  I kept in mind the prior rating and cut the sugar by 1/3, and used Splenda granular instead of regular sugar.  The sugar could have been cut more.  Everyone enjoyed it, and I will fix it again.

This was sooo delicious, however by reading some of the other reviews I decided to cut the amount of sugar in half and I instantly fell in love with this recipe.

This was really good. After reading everyones reviews, I didn't add any sugar and cooked the zucchini just until crisp-tender (not an hour). This was very good! Will make this again.

Easy, good flavor!  I used no salt tomato sauce since my husband has high BP.  And I was short on time,so I kept it on med-high instead of low. Just remember to stir.

My family absolutely loves this recipe. The only thing I do differently is I cut the water in half. Otherwise, exactly as stated in the recipe. With fresh zucchini from our garden, this is a fantastic recipe. We like our sauce a little sweet, so we don't mind the added sugar.

This was edible but just barely.  I cut the olive oil down to two tablespoons and that was plenty.  I cut the sugar down to 1/4 a cup and it was still wayyyyyyy too much.  I can't imagine what this would have been like if I had added the full 1/2 cup.  This was a lot soupier than I expected- not necessary a bad thing, but if you're expecting a really thick sauce this won't do it.  Overall, the overwhelmingly sweet taste completely overpowered the flavors of the zucchini and tomato sauce.  I wouldn't make this again.
