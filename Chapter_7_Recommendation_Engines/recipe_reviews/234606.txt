I prepared the onions according to the recipe.  I had a very large skillet and it took about 1 hour and 15 mins to carmalized 2 large onions.  I spread the dijon on some toasted crostini, then topped with a selection of cheddar cheesees, and finished with the onions before putting in the oven to bake 5-7 mins.  Very easy and very fancy looking fun appetizer with lots variations as the onion complimented the cheddar so well
