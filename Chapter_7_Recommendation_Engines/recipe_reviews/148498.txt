Great, different taste than I'm used to in shrimp.  Next time I would cut way down on the butter (was just a bit too rich for me as written), and add some garlic.  I found that it was absolutely necessary to let the shrimp sit in the beer mixture for the full half-hour...improved the taste and made them exceptionally tender.  My husband loved this dish!  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

WOW! I tried this recipe and it came out de-lici-ous!  I actually made this with 2 1/2 pounds of shrimp, half the butter and 2 beers to boil in, followed the rest as stated and also took reviewers advise and added old bay.. I also added garlic and added bay leaves and let it sit for 30 minutes (shripm will not turn rubbery!).  Came out stupendous! served with yellow rice and had a restaurant  quality meal made by a trusty person (me, lol) 
I would recommend this to anyone!

This is better than "outa this world"! I did reduce the butter (Whew!) to 2 sticks (to reduce my guilt) and then followed recipe as directed.  I also saved liquid and used it in a big pot of shrimp creole and it was one of the best I've ever done and whatever guilt I had is long gone!!  Thank you.

YUMMERS! I had 2 pounds of shrimp and began the recipe from memory. I thought the original  stated 1 cup of butter, so I accordingly halved it to 1/2 a cup, or one stick. I used 2 beers and added garlic and Old Bay Spice as well. The shrimp was divine! Great with pasta and French bread to suck up all the juices. I have frozen the rest of the broth for fish sou someday. So, even though I inadvertently cut the butter WAY down (and I am a butter freak), it was superb and I will keep to the one stick whenever I make this dish again.

This recipe was SO EASY that it's hard to believe it was SO GOOD!!  My whole family LOVED it (even the kids).  I halved the recipe, and still had plenty of stock left for soup or gumbo.  I will be making this recipe again soon!!

This was great! I didn't have any onions, but I will definitely try it with them next time. I cut way back on the butter, mainly because I served them with clarified butter. I also added garlic cloves and Old Bay. Definitely a keeper!

So easy!  I used less butter and waited to salt the broth only after it was ready.  I didn't let it stand for half an hour.  I recommend having some crusty french bread handy for the broth!

I used 3 lbs of the biggest shrimp I could find. Used 1 1/2 sticks of butter, and 24 ounces of Budweiser. Added 4 chopped garlic cloves, 1 1/2 tbs of Old Bay and 1 tbs of red crushed pepper. I garnished the bowls with a little fresh chopped parsley. Served it with crusty french bread. Looked beautiful and tasted de-licious! My husband raved and raved- he wouldn't shut up.

I did this recipe with shell-on, de-veined shrimp, keeping the heat at a simmer until they just turned pink, then turning them out in a bowl with the liquid to steep for about 1/2 hour.  The texture and flavor were excellent!  The previous reviewers had it right about adding Old Bay Seasoning (omitting salt).  3/4 TBL per pound was about right.  I also added a pinch of cayenne to give it a little top-note.    Beware of heavily hopped beers.  I used Miller High Life and it came out fine. Might be interesting to try with a simple ale, too, for a slightly sweet taste.    Many previous reviewers added garlic.  I did not, but I could tell that it would be a good addition.  Definitely serve with a crusty french bread to soak up the juice!  I'd pair it with a cucumber and vinegar salad and some radishes.  GREAT recipe!! I'd give it 6 stars if I could.

I have been making a recipe similar to this for ages.  The only difference is I do not shell the shrimp but leave them in the shell to boil in the beer and then let everyone peel their own.  I also omit the butter from the boiling and just serve it on the side with a lot of garlic for dipping.

I was hesitant when I originally looked at this recipe however I needed something different and this is definitely different.  As you've read time again - don't over cook the shrimp.  I cooked a pound of shrimp an cut the recipe down to one bottle of beer and a half a cup of butter.  Wonderfully different and a huge success at my house!!

I had to cut back on the butter due to health reasons and that obviously cut back on the flavor some too BUT I still feel there was something missing that didn't have anything to do with butter. I have since made this for the second time and halved the butter once again but this time added some garlic and some Old Bay and it was perfect. I tasted the beer more this time as well and I always use the same beer for cooking so I'm thinking the Old Bay or either the garlic brought the beer flavor more? Anyway, it was good before but great with my additions. Thanks Nita!

This has to be my new favorite recipe. And I am not a beer person! Only changes I made were to toss in 2 bay leaves, a little garlic, and a wedge of lemon...and I was debating whether it would be rude to lick my plate! Used a pound of shrimp for 2 of us- and could have used more... cant wait to try this one again!

My Sailor brought home several cases of Canadian beer from one of his sea tours in the Navy. I used it to make this dish and while I can't stomach drinking it out of the can, it was delicious as a broth!

I felt this was really bland. I kicked it a bit by: 2 cans  a beer ( any beer will do) 1 qt water, 3T hot pepper flakes, 1/4 c of old bay. 
For the onion, I cut 3 onions in half and allowed them to boil for 10-12 minutes then added my shrimp and boiled until pink.

Loved this recipe!!!! I took the advice of some other reviewers and added garlic and Old Bay Seasoning. I served it over rice and yummo. I saved the "stock" too for future use.

Very good basic recipe.  For 2 servings, I added 2 cloves of garlic, 1/2 tbs of old bay and 1 tsp of red pepper flakes.  I used 3/4 stick of butter and covered the pot when I turned the heat off.

I really enjoyed this recipe, it reminds me a lot of Bubba Gumps' Shrimpin' Dippin' Broth. I used a Czech Pilsner beer and it was really interesting, I used more shrimp just to "dilute" the richness the butter introduces to the dish. Overall, I loved it and will be making again. I am interested though as to know what other kinds of beer did people use?? Thanks! . . . .p.s. great with lots of fresh lemon juice!

My hubby prepared this for our monthly Family Night dinner and it was a hit! He prepared it exactly as written, used cheap beer and let it sit for a while longer than indicated. The shrimp were tender - mind you we used frozen shrimp - juicy and oh so perfect! Don't let the nutrition facts scare you, the buttery sauce is well worth it. My only suggestion next time would be to try adding some garlic and a little bit more salt to the dish. Other than that, excellent dish and super duper easy to prepare!

Served this super easy recipe for the superbowl; they were devoured!  As others said, reduced the butter and added Old Bay seasoning, plus some red pepper.  Will definitely make again! Thanks.

I started out to make this recipe.  I had the beer on the counter and wasn't sure if I wanted to add the onions.  I ended up using garlic butter (bought at a store called Sprouts)cooked the shrimp in this butter.  Then I added lemon juice.  It was devine, so I guess I changed the recipe with out even trying.  Sorry.

Excellent - the beer added gave the shrimp a very good, and different, flavor.  Also, easy!

Very good, but the shrimp didn't absorb as much flavor as I would have liked.  I think next time I'll try adding a little seafood boil for seasoning.

This was awesome!  I haven't read what others did but I added some old bay seasoning (a lot of it) and served with crusty bread to soak up the sauce.  All my guests want the recipe including my 16 year old step daughter who can't wait to make it herself.

Wow. Wow. Wow! By far the best shrimp I have ever tasted. Way better than anything I've had in a restaurant. We cooked half with Old Bay and half with Jamaican Jerk seasoning. Both were incredible. Will definitely be making this again.

This recipe was good. The onion/beer/butter give a really good flavor, but I think more seasonings are needed to play up those flavors. We ate thinking that it was good, but we wouldn't even guess so much of the ingredients were used because the flavor was so delicate. It did smell amazing on the stove, and the leftover juice was really good on pasta with a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese. Not a repeat boil for us but we enjoyed trying it, thank you so much for sharing.

This is a big hit with our family.  I used only 2 sticks butter for 5 lbs.  I also added the following spices:  2 TBL Old Bay Seasoning, 1 teaspoon minced garlic, and 2 TBLTony Chachere's.  The taste is awesome!  I mix all the ingredients execpt for the shrimp.  Bring to a boil.  Add shrimp for 5 minutes.  Once shrimp is cooked, I take the pot off the stove, put the lid on it, and let it sit for about 30 minutes to get the flavors soaked into the shrimp.  Delicious!  The shrimp does not get rubbery.  Serve warm with toasted garlic French bread.

Fantastic basic recipe.  I had this at the Summer Shack in Mohegan Sun Casino.  This is what they add in addition to original ingredients.  One sliced lemon, 3 celery stalks, garlic and plenty of old bay seasoning.  When I tried to duplicate it at home, I only used 1 tbs of Old Bay and it wasn't enough.  I will try 2 and 1/2 next time.  Definaltely cut back on the butter, I used one stick and it was plenty.

I made this recipe recently and, while VERY leery to whether or not the shrimp would get rubbery, I went ahead with the 1/2 stewing (kept it on a simmer instead of completly off). Shrimp turned out terrific; succulent and slightly firm yet turned to butter with a few bites. The flavor left alittle to be desired from, even with the addition of a clove of garlic added ( to my 1/3 batch, mind you). I WILL cook shrimp in this manner again, but will add old bay and tabasco to taste next time!

How yummy!!  I followed the recipe, omitted the salt and added Old Bay.  (No need for both, as Old Bay is high in sodium as it is.)  I love it when easy recipes are also the best!

This is SO good ! We seriously scaled back on the butter though . Did not let them sit the full 1/2 hour either as we were afraid they would be rubbery.
Turned out great .

this is the very best way to boil shrimp! I had a similar dish at a restaurant when I was a kid...40ish years ago! It's great for a crowd or a couple...I've made it for 2 or a bunch and it's always a hit!

I did this recipe but I reduced the butter and put a little dash sweet spicy sauce as I love spice and it comlemented the beer very well.  Other than that I tasted the beer and it was good with the shrimp.  This was awesome.  Thank you very much Will definitely make it again.

I adjusted the recipe for 2 people.  It was hard for me to melt a whole stick of butter just for the two of us but I also believe in following recipes to the letter (at least the first time)  so did it anyway.   This recipe is quite delicious and a welcome change if you want something other than dipping shrimp in cocktail sauce.   I have saved leftover butter/beer sauce and will use it tonight w/ linguini.  I am not sure whether it would taste as good w/ butter substitute.  I look forward to reading future reviews from those who tried a lower calorie alternative.    I should have rated it 5 stars for yumminess but gave it 4 stars b/c I still feel guilty about all that butter, lol.  yikes! I just looked at the cal/serving and it exceeds 1,000--fat grams are thru the roof also.  Won't indulge in this again despite it being absolutely delicious.

This is really good. I did doctor it a bit by adding more seasoning the second time I made this. I added garlic and red pepper flakes for more of a kick.   Great with steamed rice or over toasted garlic bread.

This is amazing and so fast!! I too used the Old Bay(2 tsp for a half recipe) and 2 cloves of garlic. It was tender and flavorful. This is a rich recipe and made me feel like I was eating out! Good bread for dipping is a must. I will be making a big pot of this to bring to BBQ's this summer. A perfect crowd pleaser.

We would definitely make this again with a mellower beer (my husband's treasured home brew made it a little too hoppy!).  Good suggestion for adding Old Bay.

This recipe is okay, but missing the main ingredient!!! Old Bay or J&M seasoning adds what is lacking! Spicey and Delightful!!!Try it, you'll love it! No need to measure it, just dust it over the shrimp while it's steaming in the beer. Perfection!

Have made this awesome dish 6-8 times over last few years. The base flavors of shrimp and beer complement each other really well, but each time I've added more and additional flavors...which just made it better until this last batch was slightly over the top with too much Old Bay and red pepper flakes. I use 4 lbs jumbo (16-20/lb) shrimp, several small cloves garlic , 2 sticks butter, 1Tb Old Bay (1+1/2 tb was too much), small amt red pepper flakes, a very large,sweet onion, 4-5 bottles corona beer. At end of cooking I added small amt seasoned salt and  cracked pepper. Cook gently to barely done if you intend to save some for next day, so doesn't get rubbery or overdone, and reheat gently. You can add additional beer as needed, and the leftover stock is priceless. A light beer is best, heavier ones add too much competing flavor. Outstanding, loved by one and all!

I live in Belgium and enjoy any recipe that lets me cook with one of their delicious beers.  :)  I made this with 1 kg (2 pounds) of shrimp, I used half the butter the recipe called for and 2 beers (1 Leffe blond, 1 Leffe bruin).  Bersides the onion and salt, I also added a couple sprinkles of cajun seasoning, 4 cloves of garlic and 4 bay leaves.  It is very important to let the shrimp sit for 30 min (or more!) after simmering, it really soaks up all the flavors.  Thanks NJMOM for a yummy recipe!  :)

Very good recipe!! I served my shrimp over cheese grits and added sausage (I'm from the Gulf Coast). I almost used shrimp and crab boil for the shrimp but talked my boyfriend into this recipe instead. We will definitely be making this again.

This is the only way to cook shrimp!  I made this dish a few times for company and everyone loved it.  I agree with cuting down the butter .  I use about a quarter of a pound for 1 pound of shrimp.  Also try different kinds of beer.  It changes the taste.

Very very good recipe!  Added garlic powder and black pepper to onion butter mixture.  Omitted the salt, and using half the amount of butter (no salt added butter too).  Added Old Bay to the shrimp and threw in a Bay leaf for good measure.  (Dunk bread into the juices, you will not be disappointed, my hubby was not.)  I am freezing the leftover juice for a later adventure.  Thank you so much for the recipe!  Very good without my additions as well.

I followed Recipe till the end! Then, I tasted them before serving them. Blah....No flavor but butter! Not sure what I was expecting...but was hoping for more spunk. So, we added lots & Lots of fresh ground black pepper,and 2 TBL. of crushed garlic. A couple big shakes of chili powder, heated it up again to let the flavors get together. After an about/face...We all decided it was great! Wish we knew our measurements!!But at least we enjoyed the spicier flavor, and our bagette loved the spicy flavor as well!!

YUM!! ADDED A TBS. OF OLD BAY AND REDUCED INGREDIENTS TO SERVE 2.  THOUGHT SHRIMP WOULD BE TOUGH BUT TURNED OUT PERFECT. DIPPED FRENCH BREAD IN THE SAUCE.  REHEATED NEXT DAY ON LOW IN A SKILLET UNTIL JUST HEATED.  WILL MAKE AGAIN.

Very easy to make and delicious.  I served it with yellow rice and peas.  The SO mixed it all together and declared it delicious.  I will try it with French bread next time.

WOW! Everyone loved it! I cut it to 3 servings and used Argentine Red Shrimps, I bought a 24oz can of beer so used it all because no one drinks it. I took suggestions of adding large cut onion, Cajun seasoning and cracked garlic cloves to the beer-butter mix while I brought it to a hard boil for about ten min before turning off the heat and adding the shrimp. I will definitely do this again! Thank you for sharing!

Excellent... easy... melt in your mouth shrimp.  Don't overcook.  Let them JUST turn pink and then turn it off and let them sit.  They will be perfectly cooked after sitting for 30 minutes.  Boyfriend said these were the BEST boiled shrimp he'd ever had.

This is a pretty good recipe.  I cut the butter in half though, and I think next time I'd cut it even further.  I also spiced up the boil with my favorite Cajun mix.  I'll definitely try this again.

I felt this was pretty bland. We generously applied Old Bay after serving to salvage the shrimp! Maybe it's important to let it sit overnight in the fridge... but I'm not interested enough to try that.

Have to admit I was quite disappointed after reading all the good reviews.  I did add garlic and Old Bay as suggested by other reviewers as they sounded like good additions.  My family was not impressed and I had leftovers, which is unusual when I make shrimp. To add insult to injury, no one wanted to take the leftovers, so they ended up in the trash.

If you want delicious shrimp that are easy to peel EVERY TIME, use this recipe, but better with a few changes. I put a few extra ingredients too. For up to 20lbs of shrimp I add bell peppers, celery, garlic and lemons, and the secret extra ingredient is a couple of ounces of Zataran's Liquid Crab Boil seasoning.I don't saute' the onions, or other veggies; just put them in all together at the begining. And Very Important; don't add the salt until the shrimp begin to separate from the shells. Then add salt to taste and let it soak. I add more salt than the recipe too. And one other thing; you can use less beer if you want to. I use about one 12oz can for every 4 lbs of shrimp. I know, everyone says it not enough beer, or you need to put water in, but trust me, just keep stirring the shrimp every now and then, and you'll be surprised how much liquid you end up with at the end.

This is such a great easy recipe.  I love to have a loaf of crispy warm bread and after I peel the shrimp I sit it on the bread.  This lets the buttery juices soak into the bread.  So good! I do spice it up a bit with more pepper and I added a teaspoon of sugar that gave it a great flavor!

I really did think that as the shrimp sat they would become rubbery, but after waiting on guests for an hour they were fantastic.  great flavor, even great flavor with the lobster i added-perfect served with an ice cold beer

This was a great shrimp recipe.  I opted to add garlic and it made the dish.

Excellent. I also used one stick of butter, little garlic, sauted sliced onion  and one can of beer for a large bag of shrimp.The extra sauce we put over pasta the next day. Outrageous and super simple.

Very good, added a little bit of seasonings and the shrimp turned out perfect! My husband was very impressed as well! Thanks for the recipe!

i made this last night, but i didn't like it. i added fresh garlic and substituted half of the butter for olive oil. it just wasn't tasty, and the sauce was too watery. the beer taste was also too overpowering.

MY HUSBAND AND I DIDN'T LIKE THESE AT ALL.  I EVEN ADDED FRESH GARLIC, AND THEN ADDED GARLIC POWDER AT THE END AND IT STILL DIDN'T TASTE GOOD.  I'M GLAD I ONLY DID 2 LBS.  VERY DISAPPOINTED.  IF I WOULD'VE ADDED SOME CUT UP SAUSAGE TO THE BUTTER AND ONIONS IN THE BEGINNING, THAT WOULD'VE MADE IT TASTE REALLY GOOD.  IT NEEDED SOME FLAVOR.

I cooked it as is, and it was not flavorful enough...I usually do not add salt to my food and had to add it to this.

OH MY....this was delicious!!! We served this over fettucine. I had some leftover roasted asparagus & red peppers and added that! We also added Old Bay. This is definately a keeper. Thanks for sharing!

I am not a huge fan of either shrimp, or beer (I had no wine in the house), but my husband loves both.  I took the advice of other reviewers, and used old bay in the pot.  I also used old bay to coat the shrimp after I got them out of the pot.  I served mine atop a salad.  My husband says he loved it, but I prefer other things to be done to shrimp, and other things to be done with beer.
