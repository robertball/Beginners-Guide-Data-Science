I just had this for lunch today and boy was it delicious. My only sub was soy sauce for the liquid aminos. The nuts and nutritional yeast  you can buy in the bulk bins so it isn't too expensive to give this recipe a try . I did like the sauce better heated.. different taste and it thinned out some too.  If you dont like kale, spinach would work in this too. I added a few more red pepper flakes and really enjoyed this different meal

I was nervous about this one, but it turned out really well! I don't have a great blender, so I soaked the nuts for 45 minutes in really hot water. They blended up just fine. I also was sure to use full fat coconut milk. Don't want to skimp on the fat when you're trying to mimic cheese. I used way more of the spices than the recipe called for, but that may have been because my chili powder is pretty old. Also, I heated up the sauce, which I'm assuming you're supposed to do anyways, but that changes the flavor a fair amount. Just keep that in mind as you're testing it out of the blender. It tastes pretty yeasty at room temperature. I'm not vegan, just dairy free, so I added chicken, which was delicious.
