YUM.  It really is good.  I love prosecco but didn't have any on hand.  Used a brut champagne and loved it.  Lemon zest is a must.

I thought this had a nice refreshing flavor. It kind of reminded me of a lighter more citrusy version of a sangria. At first I wasn't going to add the lemon rind, but am glad I did after reading the one review. It is neccessary! I used the finest grater I had and just added some to taste. For the wine, I used sparkling Moscato. I also made 1/2 recipe no problem. It actually made enough for one drink. The only problem I have is with the color. It is like a non-clear dark grapefruit looking color. The taste, though, outweighs that.

We've made this a couple of times for dinner parties, and it's a total hit. Everyone always asks us what's in it; it's so simple to make that it kind of feels like cheating. Last time we made it we used sparkling rosé, which was also delicious.

Fabulous drink!  Did not use the lemon zest or ice cubes.  Placed a Prosecco in freezer which kept drink cold enough.

Our whole gang liked this a lot and several people asked me for the recipe, but most people said that if I made it again to not add the lemon zest.  It just makes you feel like you have something stuck in your teeth. :(

Wow!  This was good... so good I am making it again for New Year's Eve!  It was very simple and easy...that might be another reason why I'm going to make it again... I made 18 dishes in 2 days....  I tripled the ingredients in this recipe except for the lemon rind I loved the taste but I choked a few times on the rind while drinking....
