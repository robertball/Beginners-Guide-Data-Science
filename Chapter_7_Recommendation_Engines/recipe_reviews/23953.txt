Wow does this ever bring back memories! Sometimes the simplest things are the best. This is a great snack and it's something that's not bad for ya either. I LOVE peanut butter and would eat it on just about anything. If they would only come up with a fat-free version.....(one can only hope).

I love this recipe.  I make it all the time to take in my lunch.  Instead of raisins I sometimes used dried cranberries or cherries.

I am a teacher and we did this in class. Not only did the kids love to make them by themselves, but htey loved the taste. Some of the children chose not to use the rasins.

What a classic and delicious recipe!  I modified it a bit to my taste, and in my opinion it tastes even better this way: I didn't have any celery, so I substituted white bread (personally, celery tastes like grass to me anyway).  I spread the peanut butter on both slices, but omitted the raisins and used jelly instead.  Amazing!!

This is a wonderfully fun, delicious, and nutricious snack for children and adults.

Crispy, colorful, and tasty, all the compononents for a *successful* snack.

Thanks for submitting this recipe.

Why would someone have this as a child and not care for it and as an adult find the recipe on here, make it and/or complain about it?

I made these with my 5th grade class as a fun art project and to eat it after we were finished with it.  Most of them said it was good...I think they liked the putting it together and the look of it better than the taste.  You know how 10 year olds can be.  Thanks for posting but it was fun to make.

Odd combo, but good flavor.  It has kind of a sweet and salty thing going on.  Great for an after school snack with a tall glass of milk. Yum, I'm kind of craving some now.

I've tried this in my 3-yr-old preschool class and it's a big hit.  Last year, due to peanut allergies, we used strawberry cream cheese and Craisins...very yummy as well.  A healthy after school snack!

I do an 'adult' version of this for my lunches. I mix the raisins/dried cranberries with the peanut butter in a to-go cup and use it as dip for my celery sticks.

My 7 year old daughter brought this recipe home from school one day and I thought it sounded awful.  I let her make it and tried it myself - it was delicious.  I love having it for a snack now - ONLY we use CREAM CHEESE instead of peanut butter.  It is an easy snack for kids to make themselves.  A little messy but who cares - they have fun.

i love this! i make it all the time. I find that for smaller children though it is hard to bite through so i take and cut the celery into then strips, melt the pb in the mic. till it is pourable and then drizzle it over top the celery pieces and the cellery sticks. Stick it back in the fridge until the pb hardens again and poof aints in the grass :P

This is the best snack ever!  I loved it as a kid and still love it now.  You can't go wrong with celery and peanut butter.  Then add raisins.  It's scrumptious not to mention nutritous.

Second to apples and dip, this is my daughter's favorite snack.  We love to have fun and "decorate" with the raisins but she always eats these up.  I find them okay but then, I'm not sure if these were meant for more mature taste buds. Still, healthy and a great way for kids to get those vitamins they need!

This is the only way I enjoy raw celery!  I like to cram as many "ants" on each stalk as I can.

I grew up with this one, except we use bananas instead of celery.  Both varieties remain favorite snacks of mine, as an adult!  My preschool teacher also taught us how to make hot dog "dinosaurs."  Ruffled potato chips or hamburger dill chip pickles make the fins on the stegosaurus' back (inserted into cuts along the side made by an adult).

This is always a winner. This time I used cinnamon-raisin flavored fancy peanut butter and craisins. Works with any sort of dried fruit and a variety of peanut butters. I also like the variation with cream cheese and raisins--I think that might be my favorite. Thanks for the recipe :=) (Tip: If your celery is wilting, trim the parts you aren't going to eat anyway off, and stick it in a vase of water. It'll absorb the water and plump back up. If it's beyond that point & you have kids--stick it in a vase of colored water, & the celery will absorb the colors!)

These are really cute, easy, and tasty snacks! Some of my siblings don't like raisins, so they use dried cranberries instead and have red ants on a log! This is such a cute idea; thanks for sharing!

These are a hit with the kids!  The great thing is that the kids  can make 'em for themselves.  We sometimes use chocolate chips for the ants to make it a sweeter snack.

The creamed peanut confection paired with the dried grapes lent a sweet and savory friendship to the crisped celery stalk. The water from the celery helped to lubricate the mouth and aid in the dismissal of the sticky peanut butter. I recommend the creamed peanut butter over the chunk variety in this particular scenario. (The celery and raisins gave enough texture) This is a well balanced, easy, fun, cost-effective, and relatively nutritious snack. It would be ideal for hors d'oeuvre and intoxicated midnight-munchies.

Okay.  I strongly dislike celery.  I don't like the flavor or the texture and always leave it out of recipes.  But I LOOOVE ants on a log!  I can eat ridiculous amounts of it.  I always use dried cherries instead of raisins because I like them better.  For some reason the flavor and texture combination of the celery, peanut butter and dried fruit is just divine.  I often make it when we're supposed to bring in food for a class and people always eat it up.

This is simple and a great way to get fruit & veggie into kiddies! Try all sorts of dried fruits once they enjoy the initial "ants" idea. Another variation....those tubs of different flavored, spreadable cream cheese!

Great, classic recipe!! So much better for kids than most snacks.A few said it was messy but  what's a little mess if you can get the kids to eat healthy ?You could always make it for them and not have the mess but I think it is better for the kids to make their own and have the accomplishment of making it. They also seem to eat anything better if they help make it!

This is the best snack for toddlers. I have a great variation on this - Tropical Ants on a Log! Mix crushed pineapple with cream cheese and then add the raisins (or craisins) I made it for our Easter party at preschool and everyone loved it. yum!

I LOVE these.  Have been eating them since I was a kid.  A twist on this is red ants on a snow covered log.  Instead of raisins, use craisins.  Instead of peanut butter, use cream cheese.

I have always loved this crunchy snack, and so have my kids. I also use cream cheese instead of PB, and different kinds of cubed fruit is a nice change, even cubed fresh strawberries with the cream cheese is nice, but PB is always a hit.

I had this when I was a kid and hated it.  Although it looks fun, the celery taste was awful, I ended up just sticking raisins in peanut butter and eating that!

I love this simple and tasty snack. This is a great "cooking" experience to do with kids. Give them a butter knife and they can cut the celery themselves!
Yes it can be a bit messy, but who doesn't love to lick their fingers clean?
I sometimes switch the celery for apples, or the raisins for walnuts. Still tastes awesome!

A wonderful classic.   Celery, peanut butter and raisins were made for each other, in my opinion.   One person thought it was messy to make....well, maybe a little for kids till they figure it out....but it's not as messy as mixing pb-jelly!

I make this all the time. I never knew there was a recipe for it. Unlike other commenters I love this mix of flavors. It *is* messy, but I have always enjoyed a reason to lick peanut butter of my fingers.

I ate these as a child, made them for my (now grown) kids, and now for my almost 2 year old granddaughter. It's relatively healthy and she likes eating the 'ants' first then nibbles the celery. Since she is still young and getting new teeth, I pull the strings off the celery before adding the peanut butter. I don't understand why people have to be rude in their comments. There are many new and inexperienced cooks that may never have heard of the simpler recipes before.

What a fun thing to make!  I used to make these a lot when I was a kid at home and in girlscouts.  Now, I sit down with my fiancees children and they both love to be able to do this on their own.  Such a great healthy snack for everyone!

I made these tonight for my 5 year old daughter.  She ended up licking off the peanut butter and raisins and leaving the celery after trying only a few bites.  Oh well, it was worth a try to get her to eat celery!  I thought they were really good though!

I've always loved Ants on a Log! I don't really know of anyone who doesn't! It's a great snack, easy to make, and I've never really had trouble with the mess. It's the only way I can get some kids to eat raisins!
