I made this recipe exactly as written, only using lowfat buttermilk instead of regular milk. As I've learned with most oatmeal based recipes, the batter really needs to sit for about 15 minutes or so to give the oatmeal a chance to soak up some of the excess liquid and puff up and expand. These puffed up nicely and cooked up without issues on my griddle.  I served this with a pumpkin spice syrup and homemade breakfast sausage. The kids and I really enjoyed this.

I used half whole wheat flour half all purpose flour, applesauce instead of vegetable oil, and they were super delicious! :) I didn't have any problems with baking time either, just about five minutes on each side and they were ready.

These tasted great! I did follow the advice from tat2's review and left my batter to sit for about 15 minutes before cooking. They cooked up perfectly, no extra time needed. Now I'm not the best pancake flipper in the world - so I didn't bother to make the choc. chip face while cooking but rather after cooking, by cutting out pieces of the pancake to accommodate the choc. chips. Unfortunately it only worked for the eyes and nose. The mouth, I'm not sure what happened lol - I need some carving skills! Haha. I wish it did turn out pretty but hey, I can't complain about the flavour of these pancakes! It's awesome! I was going to serve with pecan butter but it turns out the chocolate was the perfect compliment to the pancakes IMO. I think next time I may just add the chocolate chips into the batter rather than trying to make a face out of them. Thank you for sharing your recipe! It's very delicious.

Loved these! I used whole wheat flour and added a lot more of the spices, as I love the spice flavors.  I didn't even add any toppings to them! Delicious and filling!  Also note that they cook a lot slower than regular pancakes. I cooked them at a slightly lower tempature to keep the outsides from browning too much and still able to get the inside cooke.

I thought these were O.K., but my husband didn't really care for them. I followed the recipe exactly, but I did let the batter sit for 15 minutes, as suggested by another reviewer and I had no problem with the cooking time. I found the cloves to be a little over powering - I really couldn't taste the pumpkin at all. If I make these again I will omit the cloves entirely and maybe add more cinnamon. These are a very hearty and thick pancake and very filling.

I agree with the previous review that they took a long time to cook. This recipe is excellent though and I'm sure I'll make it again. I added more milk - maybe another cup (I added a little at a time until the batter was thin enough). Also, I only had old-fashioned oats and blended them up before adding them to the batter.  GREAT! - even my picky son ate the pumpkin!

These were VERY hearty.  I don't think it's really something my family will go for again, but if you you like something that sticks to your ribs this is great.

The liquid content is way way off, the batter was so thick even after I added another half cup of milk! I put some on the griddle anyway and kept flipping them because they weren't cooking through. Both sides were burnt and the center STILL wasn't cooked through! The only way I thought I could save these is by throwing them in a muffin tin and putting it in the oven. They aren't done yet so I don't know if that was enough to save them. I gave one of the non-burnt 'pancake pucks' to try and she said it was weird.  I am never making this again!!  EDIT  I pulled the 'muffins' out of the oven after about 50 minutes at 350 degrees and they were once again burnt on the outside and RAW in the center!!

Very good. The only changes I made were for some health substitutions. (Used half whole wheat flour, egg beaters, 1 T melted butter with 1 T applesauce.) I did run out of brown sugar though, so I made it to 1/4C with some sugar substitute. I doubt it made too much of a difference though. The taste was pretty good, my husband loved them to pieces. I wasn't too thrilled with how thick they were (I was just in the mood for regular pancake-thin pancakes) but they were still tasty. I'd probably add some more spices or pumpkin to get more of that flavor out, but not necessary. They were pretty tasty as is.

Beware if you like light or flat pancakes. These are hearty, thick, cake-like, moist. I used oat bran for the oats and whole wheat pastry flour. I also added a Tbsp of cider vinegar to the milk and let it "sour" for a few minutes before adding to the dry ingredients. This acts similar to buttermilk and makes for a wonderfully fluffy result. These are so flavorful..they taste like pumpkin pie in pancake format. We served them with real maple syrup and whipped cream. My hubby added blueberries to one of his while it cooked and he reports it was delicious.

These became my teenagers new favorite pancake. I took the advice of others and let the batter sit a bit to soften th oatmeal. Otherwise, I didn't change a thing. Delicious!

Made as written.  Used a pumpkin shaped cookie cutter to cut out a few and my kids absolutely loved them.  What a fun idea and a delicious recipe!

Followed the recipe to a tee, and my family agreed that it wasn't that flavorful. No spice flavor at all. We tried adding another 1/4 tsp cinnamon to the second batch and it still didn't help it that much.

I gave this 4 stars for taste and creativity, but don't expect your typical pancake, these are more like breakfast cookies! They are super thick and chewy, perfect if you are an oatmeal cookie/pumpkin pie lover. I followed the other reviewers' suggestions and let it sit for 15 mins, plus I doubled the spices and added Ginger and nutmeg for a more pumpkin pie taste. Different, but really good!

It was very good.  Kids loved it and so did I.  I added 1 tsp of vanilla and instead of 1/4 of cinnamon, I did 1 tsp.  I also did 1/8 of cloves rather than what it called for.  I used chocolate chips but then I also did peanut butter chips as I ran out of chocolate.  This recipe is a keeper.

I thought these were so yummy.  I followed it closely except from one review I decided to substitute applesauce for the oil and I used whole wheat white flour.  My kids really liked them especially my 9 month old who is just starting table foods.  Didn't need syrup and were yummy later even cold.

**Update: I have also substituted mashed banana for the pumpkin and really liked the flavor.  I also used mini choco  chips instead of making faces.  These stay good for several days if kept in the refridgerator.

I feel like I'm missing something here. I made this exactly as written and the batter was thick!! Thick like biscuit dough. Only after thinning the batter with more milk, and adding some applesauce did it thin down enough to be near pancake consistency. Then the chocolate chips burned after flipping em.   I'm not sold on this one

Overall this is a good recipe base, but I am only giving it 3 stars because I had to make some changes to make it really good. With these alterations, this makes a delicious "guilty pleasure" breakfast. 1 cup +2T milk +1T lemon juice (mix and let sit 5 min to make homemade buttermilk)-- in place of milk in place of sugar I used 1 1/2t agave syrup reduce salt by 1/4t double cinnamon add 3/4t vanilla extract in place of oil, use 2T unsweetened applesauce substitute whole wheat pastry flour instead of all purpose  This might seem life a lengthy list of substitutions, but it makes these so much healthier and delicious.  This way your "guilty pleasure" doesn't really have to make you feel guilty:)

It was okay. I was a bit dissappointed.  I did let it sit for 15minutes but mine was way too thick.  It was a bit dry.  My kids liked it but I will not make this recipe again unfortunately.

I agree that the original recipe did not "cook up in time." Try 10-12 Mins (as suggested in other "Pumpkin Recipes" on this site,) especially as this recipe calls for 1 c flour and 1 c oats!.  Mange!

"Mommy, will you make Pumpkin Pancakes like Grammies?  Cuz they are sooo delicious" my 5 year old grandson said to his mother. What better recommendation could you have than that? 
 We all love this and it has become a staple. The batter as written is very thick so I use 1 and 1/2 cups milk, and they cook up fine.  It is important to let the batter sit for about 15 minutes to soften the oatmeal (as other reviewers have noted). I also use all whole wheat flour and increase the cinnamon to 1/2 teaspoon.  I love them with sliced banana and warm applesauce, they are really good plain too.  I have never used the chocolate chips. I lighten them up by using Egg Beaters for the egg and substituting applesauce for half of the oil.  It works fine to make up the batter the evening before.

These were good, but waaaaay too sweet!  If I make these again, I will be halving the brown sugar and upping the spices, for sure.

These were tasty but my husband claimed they didn't have a lot of pumpkin taste.  I omitted the cloves and used all spice instead.

I liked this a lot, but the batter was way too thick. I added a lot more milk, and then they were great. Thanks for the recipe!

I really liked this, but hubbie wasn't too crazy about them. I used Walnuts instead of choco chips since he is a diabetic. Oat bran instead of quick cooking. Just a bit of brown sugar & a bit of Splenda. My homemade pumpkin pie spice, buttermilk for the milk. It's a VERY thick batter & hard to tell when they are done, but I loved the flavor of them. Thanks!

This recipe was quite good, but it did not cook right. The pancakes were on the griddle for a LONG time and they never fully cooked. They were chewy and wet, but delicious. I want to give it more stars and maybe I should have cooked them longer, but somethig is missing - either an ingredient, quantity, or cooking instruction.

I have now made this recipe two times and here is what I’ve learned. First, I automatically double the recipe (who uses only half a can of something. Secondly, you add an extra cup of milk of your choice (the oats will absorb the liquid making it thick. Thirdly, I used pumpkin spice because I had it on hand, you will need to add extra to taste. Finally, wait about 15 minutes before cooking (I read this in one of the other comments and it makes a big difference!)

I found the batter to be too thick and had to add a lot of extra milk. Tried to follow some of the tips of previous reviewers that add success but was ultimately disappointed with how these turned out

We really enjoyed these fall flavor pancakes.  I even made a batch with almond milk and they turned out just as delicious. Perfect for us lactose intolerant and milk allergic folks.  We had some left over apple crisp and topped with that these were sensational!

The only changes that I made were to decrease the sugar (I used 2 generous Tbls sucanat instead of 1/4 cup brown sugar because we generally like things less sweet) and I added a scant 1/2 tsp vanilla (because who can go wrong with vanilla).  I made them plain and with blueberries--saving the chocolate chips for a special occasion but I'm sure they will be good too). Kids LOVED them!

I own Porch Time Bed & Breakfast in Farmington, Iowa, and just served these pancakes to six of my guests this morning.  Although I also served several other tasty dishes, they kept asking for more of these.  Definitely five stars!  I followed the suggestions of others and used double the cinnamon and more milk (I always use buttermilk).  But lo and behold, after I opened the can of pumpkin, I noticed it was pumpkin pie MIX, not plain pumpkin.  Wondering if this would make it too spicy, I went ahead and used it anyway, and it was absolutely heavenly!  Used real maple syrup, of course, and a bowl of blueberries on the side.  It was the most lovely part of our breakfast.  Thank you so much for sharing the recipe!  Oh yes, I experimented and put the leftover batter in an 8x8 pan and baked it in the oven.  It made delicious pumpkin "bars."  To those who said they wouldn't cook properly, it is because these pancakes must be kept small, certainly NOT over 1/2 cup of batter.  I had no trouble cooking them at all.

OMG - amazing! I made mine with white whole wheat and with skim milk and they are still amazing. I didn't add choc chips - a little rich for my taste - but these were so good I didn't put syrup on them, just ate them plain! Excellent! Next time I might even reduce the oil a little to make them even lower in fat.

Yum! Loved them and will make them again!!! I gave it four stars like the others simply for the fact that it does need more milk. Also, if you add the choc. chips after you flip the pancake it turns out much better and less mess. With the modifications the recipe is a five star! I shared it with my friends on face-book too.
