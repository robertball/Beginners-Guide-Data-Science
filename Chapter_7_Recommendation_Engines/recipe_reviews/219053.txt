Had a get-together last weekend and this app was a hit. It's easy, healthy and yummy. I served it with corn chips. I followed the recipe exactly and loved it.

High expectations, but I did not enjoy this.  It was quite bland.  I followed the directions to the letter.  Not a fan.

I didn't have black-eyed peas so I used garbanzo peas instead.  I also served it over fried paunhaus for breakfast. It would be good on fried mush too.
