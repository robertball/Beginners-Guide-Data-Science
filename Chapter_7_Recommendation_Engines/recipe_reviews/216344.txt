Perhaps the individual meant tomato paste vs. tomato sauce.  Doesn't tomato paste come in that size can? It kind of makes sense, in a way, considering the recipe also calls for a can of tomato soup.  Seems like tomato sauce and tomato soup would be a lot of liquid.

We used to make this at Girl Scout Camp with mixed vegetables instead of green beans. We also used tomato paste not sauce.  We called it hamburger stew and it was well received.

I just wanted to comment on ingredients.   I have never seen a 6 1/2 oz can of tomato sauce. They are 8 oz cans!

I substituted the condensed tomato soup for a can of Manwich sauce. I also browned the meat in a pack of onion soup mix and a table spoon and a half of Beef Bouillon mix. I also added a can of diced tomatoes with Oregano, Basil and Garlic and a can of Tomato Paste. 

Oh-! Instead of White sugar, I used a table spoon of Brown Sugar. I thought it came out decent enough over Wide Egg Noodles. Add a bit of Parmesan cheese and some salt afterwards, it came out like a make shift meat and noodles.

I add chopped onion and a small can of whole kernal corn and pour into a baking dish. Top with mashed potatoes or cornbread batter. (I use a corn bread mix and then bake it according to the instructions on the box) or bake at 400 for 20 minutes for the mashed potato topping.

Added minced onion and garlic to the hamburger mixture.  Reduced sugar to 1/8 cup; still very sweet.  Served mine over potato and two over noodles.  After 3 servings still had 5+ to go, serving size way off.  Won't make again.

I made this last night for dinner and I used an 8oz can of tomato sauce which turned out to be a perfect thinner for the soup since you don't add any other liquid. I think paste would've been too thick. The only thing I added was garlic powder cause we love garlic.

This was really good.  I did not think you would use 6 oz of Tomato paste to 1 can of Soup.  I used an 8 oz can of Sauce and can of soup.  Since you add no water, the consistency was perfect for serving over mashed potatoes. Simple to make and yummy!

Wow I will definitely tone down the sugar next time.  Other than being overly sweet it was pretty good and super simple to make.  I did use non condensed tomato basil soup instead, since my store was out of condensed tomato soup.  It did not turn out runny at all.  The sauce thickened up really nice after 30 minutes on med low.

This recipe did not look good to me at first. The tastes didn't look like they'd go together but I was wrong! I have made this 3-4 times & every drop goes!
