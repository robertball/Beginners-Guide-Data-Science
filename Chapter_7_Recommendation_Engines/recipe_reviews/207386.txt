Great Smells is right!!!  The taste ws even better.  Note, that I used the Awesome Red Wine Pot Roast recipe that I found on here to make the Pot Roast with the exception that I cooked for 2 1/2 hours.  Then refrigerated the roast until the next day.  The I folled this recipe.  My husband and I loved it.  And my son the next day asked me to hold on to the recipe because it was the best beef stew he had ever had.  I could not find the Italian seasoned tomatos but found something called seasoned diced tomatoes.  I also added a 1/2 cup Sangria as well.  This recipe is definitely as keeper!

I added extra herbs (oregano, fresh basil, a bit of rosemary) and veggies (some celery, mushrooms, extra carrots). Yum! Even DS5 liked it (although he wasn't fond of the potatoes or mushrooms). Perfect on a cold and windy Northwest day!

Great smells are coming out of the kitchen with this recipe!!! My family enjoyed me cooking it almost as much as it being served on the table and eaten. Whoever has a mom like this is lucky, I had added some garlic at the end to meet are garlic addiction but i didn't want it to interupt the flavour from the stew too much. Thank you for this recipe!!

This is an excellent easy recipe!  I don't care for the tomatoes being so chunky so I cooked it longer than recommended. Next time I'm considering adding a can of vegall.  Other than that, I followed the recipe to a tee and everyone ate it all up!

Made this last night and my family LOVED it...I however think I will cut down on the stewed tomatoes by about 8 oz and increase the broth as I found it a bit too much tomato for a stew (hopefully my husband doesnt notice :) ) Also I added celery and to the flour I added Montreal Steak Spice for some extra flavor.  Will definately be making again and will add fresh mushrooms next time as well (with the little adjustment).

This was soooo yummy!  The only thing I did differently was that I used Olive Oil instead of Vegetable oil.  My husband (who does not like Beef Stew) loved it.

Tonight I was going to prepare my usual beef stew but then I decieded to go online to search for something different.  Oh my gosh this recipe is so delicious just as described.  The sauce is so tasty and the meat came out so tender.  Unexpected company showed up and and ate it all up.  No leftovers but that goes to show you how good it was.  I served it with a variety of hot rolls and butter.  This recipe is a keeper.

We gave this three stars.  It tasted fine and was easy to throw together, but my family prefers a more traditional beef stew without a tomato base.

This was just ok to me. It needed more. perhaps celery, mushrooms..etc. I don't know if it was the 'pre-seasoned' tomatoes or the thyme but something in this was too herb'y'

This was a really good recipe.  I cut back the seasoning a little as i didn't want the total Italian experience and it was really good.

One of the best homemade beef stews I've ever had.  Toward the end I was worried the stew wouldn't thicken, so I did add about a teaspoon or so of cornstarch to thicken it, other than that, I followed the recipe exactly as it is.

YUM!!!! I made this last night. It had been a cool rainy day & this was perfect. The only thing I changed was adding about a teaspoon of salt & I used Olive Oil instead of vegetable oil. I will certainly be making this again. GREAT RECIPE!!

If it's possible to be in love with a smell, that is how I felt about this stew.  And the taste was wonderful!  The only reason it got 4 stars instead of 5 is because I didn't use the tomatoes, so I'm not reviewing the exact recipe. Yum!

It was very good! However I added some corn ^ green beans to mine for some extra life to the stew. Also used a bit of Tony Chachere's to season it a bit more. Otherwise, great!

This stew is AMAZING!!! I did make a couple of changes. Added beef shank with the bone to add more flavor and also did celery as well. This is one I'll definately make quite a few times!!!

Delicious! Never heard of the stewed tomatoes but what a great addition to the traditional stew. Made a double batch so we have lot's of leftovers. Can't wait to throw it in the microwave.

This stew was good and hearty.  I followed the recipe except I added fresh mushrooms and frozen peas.  I thought the stew was a little thin, so I thickened it up with a flour water mixture.  My entire family enjoyed this meal.  It wasn't anything extraordinary, but a good, family staple.

Simple is often best. I have other tricks and enjoy al dente veggies so I add the potatoes earlier than the carrots. My recipe is similar but I use some beer in the recipe to cook the onions through. Of course Alpine Beer is best as it is the best. Enjoy

Well, I did change things a little, which I don't like reading in reviews, but here you go: I used beef stew meat, olive oil, diced tomatoes and added italian seasoning since I didn't have the italian-style stewed--whoops, I added a little bit of garlic pepper, but I doubt enough to make a difference...I also added maybe 1/4 c red wine and more salt and pepper. The second 45 min. I kept the stew at med. heat since things weren't softening quick enough. At the end I added maybe 1.5 T cornstarch to thicken and brought to a boil again. Yum, but then again, I love beef stew!

I was disappointed with this recipe, especially after reading all the glowing reviews. The main problem was the stewed tomatoes. I had my reservations about adding them...I've never had beef stew with tomatoes before. Now I know why. Bad combination. From now on I will stick to a more tradition stew.

Easy recipe to follow.  I followed this recipe for the first try but would add green beans and corn the next time I make it.  We served  over egg noodles and it was all gone!
