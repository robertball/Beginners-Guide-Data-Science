Thank you!  I have been looking for a simple and fast recipe for this.  Used to be called "Chit on a Shingle" and was served over toast (my apologies for the language, but that's what my dad called it.  Said it was a staple when he was in Nam)

Pretty easy recipe and tastes like comfort food. Peas, ham, and cheesy cream just work together. I made up a quick, homemade four cheese sauce. I don't know what the jarred stuff tastes like, but I can't help but think a jalapeño or at least some black pepper would've really helped out. Next time, I will try serving this on jalapeño cornbread or mix up some jalapeño biscuits. :-) Thank you for the recipe.
