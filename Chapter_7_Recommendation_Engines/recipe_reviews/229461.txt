Delicious! I did not measure the parmesan cheese, and was a bit heavy handed, so I had a small issue w/ them sticking in the pan, but that was my fault, not the recipe. These had great flavor, and were definitely worth the extra step of cooking the zucchini, onions and garlic first. I did omit the thyme, as we do not care for it. My little girls loved these, and even my boy who usually does not care for zucchini patties ate them up! I will def be making these again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Our family loved this recipe!  Because my husband can not handle spicy food, I left out the garlic and cut the amount of onion in half.  I added fried and crumbled bacon to part of the batter just to try something different.  We couldn't make up our minds which we liked better.  I will definitely make this one again.

Oh man these are good, and I didn't even follow the recipe to the T. I only had about 3 cups of zucchini available, so I lessened the other ingredients just a tiny bit. I also used plain bread crumbs instead of crackers and used olive oil in the mixture. They are so good. Just make sure you pack the patties nicely or they may fall appart when you try to flip them or take them out of the pan.

This was good, be sure to cook zucchini mixture in pan long enough to simmer most of liquid away. I added a can of salmon, and some dill weed. Made a sauce of sour cream, a little mayo, dill weed, lemon juice & salt & pepper. Really good! made a double batch, froze half the patties on parchment covered cookie tin til firm, then wrapped in foil, separating each patty with parchment. Have an easy meal in the freezer now!

This were very tasty. We left out the onion (hubby can't eat it) and thyme (not a fan of that spice).

The first batch was too thick and kind of fell apart.  But that being said, my ingredients were not totally zucchini.  Grocer was out of all but 3 small zucchini, So I added a squash, (cooked) for the other cup and some grated carrots and celery and onion for the other cup.  The flavor was good, but didn't stick together well, unless I formed them small and cooked them in the 2 " oil a long time before turning over.  The taste was very good.  Make sure you use exactly the amount of zucchini they call for in the recipe, cause that is what it needs.  My squash (green acorn squash) was obviously too soft to make a good solid patty.  ANYWAY, added parmesan cheese was amazingly good on top of the cooked Parmesean Zucchini Pattys!!

Since I am cooking for two, I halved the recipe.  It seemed to have way too much garlic, and the patties would not hold together in the skillet.  I added 1/2 C. flour to the remaining batter & they stayed together & tasted pretty good.   Will go back to my old recipe (which used flour for a thickener) and would not make this recipe again.

Made exactly as written and they were REALLY good!  Will make again and use a temperature controlled fryer. They came out a lot more brown than they should have been, but tasted great!

It tasted great! I halved the recipe and tried to make only 7 but it didn't work out as I planned. Use 4 eggs if making the whole batch.

Over abundance of zucchini in the summer. This is a great recipe. I didn't have enough parm cheese or saltines. I had club crackers which worked great and added enough plain bread crumbs to Make them form enough to make parties. Definitely will make this again.
