I would just like to add to anyone making this cake, that simply spreading margarine over the top when it first comes out of the oven is delicious and you don't have to make icing.
I've added this because that has how I've been eating it my entire life.

I must admit I was a bit skeptical... but a great cake it truly is, easy, quick, cheap, and unbelievable! my husband could't believe it had no butter and no eggs. I added candied cherries just to please my little girl but I'm longing to add nuts or a cup of coffee instead of water...

This is a wonderful cake and very delicious.  I was looking for a cake with no eggs because I have two grandsons who are allergic and this is a real winner.

For having no eggs and butter this cake is really quite good. I made cupcakes out of it and they turned out nicely.

I used to bake this cake 50 years ago when I was in high school. I think my grandma showed  me how. It's very good. I baked it in a loaf pan this time so I could do an Ina Garten dessert that uses melted vanilla ice cream on the bottom of a shallow dessert bowl. Add about a 1" slice of cake on top of the ice cream and sprinkle with fresh raspberries. Stupendous! It comes off as a really fancy dessert and no one will know it's melted ice cream if you don't tell them. The ice cream tastes like as a fancy cream of some kind.

One of my all time favorite recipes from my mom!  We don't grease the pan but mix the dry ingredients directly in it. That saves you from dirtying an extra dish.  The cake doesn't stick to the pan.    Everything else is done the same. I also use a different frosting for this cake.  1 c. powdered sugar, 1/3 c. cocoa, 3 T. water, pinch of salt, 1/2 tsp. vanilla, 1/4 c. soft butter.  Wait until the cake cools before frosting.

I tried this one day when I was short on ingredients, and it has since become one of my few regular recipes. It is moist and delicious, and easy to make. I only make half the icing, and it is quite adequate.

I have been making this cake for years but we always called it "depression" cake. A delicious cake even when ingredients were hard to get. This is my go-to cake when the pantry is low and I need a quick dessert. It truly doesn't need icing to taste great. Powdered sugar or a simple glaze drizzled over is fine.

Confusing recipe.  Not sure how much cocoa powder goes in cake or frosting?  Don't think ingredients are listed in proper order?

Made this yesterday to take with a meal I had made for another family. I had no eggs left so this was perfect. I made it in two 9 inch (?) round pans so I could keep one for us and give one away.  It baked around 23 minutes and probably could have baked a few more minutes, but it was super-moist, which was great.  I cannot imagine a 9 x 13 being done in 20 minutes like the directions say. It really is as easier than a cake mix (which I try to avoid) since you just measure and stir.  No mixer needed.  My husband asked what kind of chocolate I used since it was very chocolately. Just cocoa!  The frosting is a really good one.  I had doubts about putting it on the warm cake but it held up wonderfully.  I ended using around 3 cups of powdered sugar.  I will definitely make this again.  I used to write menus for senior centers where lunch was served.  I put wacky cake on the menu and it was always well liked.  It was rarely served with frosting since it's such a moist cake.  But...I like frosting!!

Tasty?  Sure.  especially since I was craving chocolate cake but did not have eggs or sweetened condensed milk.  A few notes:  1. I'd rather dirty the extra dish and mix it in a bowl.  I made a mess mixing it in the pan and my cake did stick a little.  2. The bake time was WAY off.  I ended up baking it for 37 minutes. 3. I only made half the icing (Because I only had about 1 1/2 of powdered sugar.  I think I would have liked it with all of the icing better. :D  

Over all a great cake when you're out of eggs.

This cake was very easy to make. I thought I would try a recipe without eggs in it, however, it just tasted like something was missing. I think I will try a different recipe next time!! (its good for people that are allergic to eggs) Although I thought it tasted almost like brownies. It's a good brownie cake recipe!
