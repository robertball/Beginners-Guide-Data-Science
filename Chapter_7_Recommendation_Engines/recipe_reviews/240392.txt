I found this recipe years ago on the pillsbury website. I keep pre-made pillsbury pie crust in the freezer and always have cream of chicken soup in the cupboard. I use a can of peas and carrots or a can of veg-all. Also adding garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper and a little sage will take the flavor to the next level. If you have leftover roast beef or hamburger meat, use cream of mushroom, a can of sliced mushrooms, and all the spices minus the sage, and sour cream instead of half and half and you have a killer beef pot pie!

This is a very simple recipe.  The only things I added was more thinly sliced carrots and small diced potatoes. Then brushed top crust with beaten egg. Turned out delicious.  Definitely will make again.

This was so easy to put together, and everything you want in comforting meal! I made as written but put in individual servings and brushed the top crust with a light coating of a beaten egg. I will definitely  keep this in the rotation for a quick weeknight meal!

I followed the recipe with the exception I added chopped garlic, onions and celery and sautéd in butter. I also added uniformly chopped potato and frozen veggie medley (green beans, corn, peas and carrots to the butter onion mixture. This is definitely a keeper. I will surely make it

We loved it!  I added more cream because I added sautéed mushrooms,onions and celery.  I didn’t use the frozen blended vegetables because I had glazed carrots and peas left over from thanksgiving so I used those.  I added garlic powder.  My husband is a huge fan of chicken pot pie and he said this one tops them all!  Thanks for sharing!

This was very good but I'd like a little more gravy .  Would probably use a little more soup and half & half or milk.  Made 2 pies but only had 1 can Cream of Chicken Soup  so one pie I used Cream of Mushroom Soup and it was GREAT so don't hesitate to play w/this recipe.  Also added a little onion powder which made it really flavorful.

I’ve made chicken pot pies quite often, my husband favorite.  I thought I would try a different recipe. My husband could not have enough. I had to make it again the same week. I’m keeping this recipe.

Turned out really great!  The only thing I will do next time is cook the frozen mixed vegetables before mixing with soup, chicken and half and half. I did not use leftover chicken, but baked 2 chicken breasts seasoned with Mrs Dash.. Also,  on 350, it took an hour to cook.

It was very good. I added carrots, a few peas,  chopped celery and chopped onions. 
I only had one puff pastry so I just used it on top. It was excellent.

I am not naturally comfortable with recipes that leave specifics undefined. It would have been nice to have added the size of the pie plate: I had to guess, Also, I was up in the air as to exactly what is a prepared pie crust.  So, I made my own crusts for an eight inch turkey pot pie and it was excellent and very popular with my family!  I will be making it again. Thanks  for the recipe.

This really is a simple and very easy recipe that tastes great. The only change I made was using half of the frozen peas and carrots and I added a small can of cut green beans(drained)

This turned out really yummy! I added one heaping tbs of light mayo, and sprinkled in some garlic powder, celery salt and pepper. Also, I ended needed to cook it about 10-15 minutes longer in order to get the top crust done and slightly browned.

So quick and easy. And you can season it up for more  zing. I make this in advance into 3 smaller pot pies for a quick lunch or to share with a single neighbor. Use the leftover dough to personalize it with an initial on top :)

This recipe is delicious and so simple to make. the only thing I added was I diced potatoes  and added them to the vegetables because I couldn't find a 16oz bag of vegetables so the potatoes add the extra ozs.

I made this for myself and for my sons family.  Only thing I added was leftover hash browns for the potatoes.  Very good.  My family devoured it..

Quick and simple.   Great way to use left over rotisserie chicken and get vegetables in the children.  Doctored it up by adding garlic, onion powder and chives.

It's so easy and delicious. A great way to make use of the leftover holiday turkey. With such an easy to follow recipe and short ingredients list, I made a double batch and baked two.

Easy recipe! I suggest you bake at 400 degrees to brown the crust better. Nice recipe!

Directions were easy to follow, we used a roasted red potatoes, red peppers, broccoli, garlic frozen medley with our left over turkey. I won't know how it tastes till tomorrow's lunch! :)

I added sauteed onions & celery and used evaporated milk instead of half and half.  Turned out good, but I think I'll use half & half next time for a bit more creaminess.

Very good. I used canned chicken and milk instead because I didn't have half and half ( I'm sure the half and half would have made it richer). I also added Rosemary seasoning. My husband loved but asked if I would put in more chicken.

I make this almost every time I have left over roasted chicken or turkey.  I add pimentos if I have them on hand.
