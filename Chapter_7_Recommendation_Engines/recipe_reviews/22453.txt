First of all these are great, using the exact ingredients that the recipe calls for!  WHY OH WHY does anyone give ANY RECIPE less than 5 stars when they CHANGE the ingredients??!!  You people should be banned from giving any reviews!  In fact do us a favor and DON'T give a review unless you used the exact ingredients. Shame on you.

I usually use flour tortillas, which I spread with cream cheese, then layer the ham, add the pickle, roll and slice.

What seemed like an odd combination actually turned out to be a quick and easy snack/appetizer! These were especially good with really cripsy deli style dill pickles. I secured them with toothpicks and olives  - some green and some black for a little color and flavor variation. Great with an assortment of crackers for munching!

My Version of this recipe vary's.This one is ok with dill pickles but gerkins make this appetizer irresistable.Take one package of sliced ham and cut length wise into 3 sections.Take 1 strip of ham and put a gerkin pickle at 1 end.With a butter knife cut off a piece of cream cheese and put it on the ham in front of the pickle,roll up and secure with a toothpick. I have to hide these once I make them or there will be none left for the guests.

This is a great snack for kids! They love to help make it. One of my kids dosen't like ham, but they both love this. My one suggestion-I use refrigerared Claussen mini-dills instead of spears. They roll easier and give an extra crunch! The flavor blends nicely.

I have made these before and swore I would never do it again because it was such a pain to spread the cream cheese.  Well fact is, I like them so much that I had make 'em again.  ;)  This time I had the upper hand...I bought WW whipped cream cheese and let it get to room temp and then put it in a baggie, cut the corner and squeezed it out on to the ham!  Perfect!  I pat dried the pickles and wrapped those bad boys up.  Into the fridge to chill for awhile and then to cut!  Perfect.

I ate these at my daughter-in-laws baby shower. My other two daughter-in-laws were also there and loved them. I made them at home later and my two grandchildren who love pickles and ham devoured them. Their ages are 3 and 5.

I've made these in the past and have found that they are a big hit for appetizers. My husband absolutely loves them! One thing that I do a little different is I add a half package of dry Ranch dressing and 1/4 cup mayonnaise to the cream cheese. It adds a little more to the tasty treats!

I too have been making these for years; except that I prefer to make them with big fat green onions and I make pickle ones too at the same time.  I do, however, try to use the Clausen dills because their size and crunchiness works best for this recipe.  I use a bit more cream cheese than what is shown in this picture.  Also, after I roll them up, I place them in the fridge for about 1/2 hour before cutting them.  This allows the cream cheese to stiffen up a bit and makes for easier and cleaner cutting.

I have always made these, minus the pickle, but will definitely add to the next batch. These are easy and quick to make. Great for those Tupperware, Partylite, Home Interior parties, etc.... Kids are always happy to finish what ever is leftover.  Holly Johnson-Emerald Isle, NC

This is perfect with pastrami rather than ham. I like to chop the pickle and pastrami and combine it with the cream cheese and spread over flour tortillas to make pinwheels. Add dill & garlic pepper to taste. They're always a big hit at my parties.

When I give this recipe out, I always tell people you have to use Claussen pickles (spears).  Yes, it does make a difference!!!!  I count the amount of pickles in the jar, then go to the deli & get the exact slices of ham that I need.  No waste!  I make these quite a bit for get-togethers.  They go over really well.  My husband wouldn't eat them in the beginning because they don't look very appetizing, but now I can't even get them made before he's eating an entire pickle - or two!  And my one son that's the very picky eater would have these for a meal if I'd let him!

These are sooooooo good. I take them to any kind of party. People will actually wrinkle their noses when you tell them what it is, but I take an empty plate home every time.

Easy tips:  1. You can make them with a flour tortilla as the base, spread the cheese, add the meat and pickles, roll and put in fridge for a bit...easier to slice.

2. Use a whole pickle.  It's easier to dry the pickled and not so messy as a spear. 

3. Play around, add things like salsa, ranch dressing powder, chili powder, etc. to your cream cheese.  Yummm!!

4. You can use any kind of sliced meat. Sliced turkey, beef, salami....experiment.

This is a quick and easy appetizer to whip out, however I think the measurements are off. I was able to us 12 slices of ham and a whole 24 oz. jar of sliced dill pickles along with 1 8 oz pkg of cream cheese. I cut the rollups into 3rds, stuck a olive on top and pierced with a toothpick and it was enough for 10-12 people!

My mom has made this for years.  A little tip she did was to make them ahead of time wrap in plastic wrap and freeze before you slice. This makes is much easier to cut.

I've made these for years and they are wonderful and everyone always likes them.  You can use a piece of pineapple or a green olive instead of the pickle for variety.  Can't eat just one!  Thank you for sharing Courtney!

These were a little frustrating at first because I did not dry the meat before I started spreading the cream cheese. Once I realized I needed to dry the meat, it went a lot quicker! These were a hit at a food table for teachers at lunch and they went quick. I couldn't stop eating them while making them! Will make again!

My family and friends always love these when I make them but I use pickled asparagus spears instead of the pickle spears.... we tried them with pickles and didn't like them as much.  So try using the asparagus, you might like it...just a suggestion!
By the way Costco has great pickled asparagus.

Perfect! Nothing to add, nothing to subtract. Try slicing the finished cylinders into bite-sized portions for an even better result at coctail parties!

I've been making these for about 25 years. I started by using layering Buddig ham slices with a layer of cream cheese in between. There was always tearing of that thin a meat when you layered it. (no matter how soft the cream cheese was) I started buying deli ham and had them slice it a bit thicker and it worked like a charm. Since the deli meat is a bit longer I didnt't have to layer it anymore. I don't use the toothpicks. I always let them sit in the fridge overnight and cut them the morning they'll be eaten. My children and their children line up when I cut the ends off to help me "get rid of all those scraps". It gives me joy to know they still love these treatsl.

I have recommended this recipe so many times on here, but had never actually made it myself. My only experience with these was at a baby shower about 5 1/2 years ago. I was so impressed because I could not believe how easy they were to assemble and because when you first think about this combo everyone's first reaction is....ewww. Don't overlook this recipe when you need an easy appetizer!! This recipe is soooooo worth the little bit of effort it takes. Using one 8 oz. pkg. of cream cheese, I was able to use 10 slices of cooked ham/10 pickle spears. Make sure your ham is not sliced too thin or it will tear as you try to spread on the cream cheese! The first one I sliced into 5 pieces. They were too big. Then I did 6 slices on the next one. Still wasn't what I wanted. I ended up getting 8 slices out of each spear. The pieces with the small pointy ends of the pickle didn't hold together too well, but that was ok because my son was able to eat them as "samples". I made these to serve along with some other dishes at a Pampered Chef party and they were a total HIT!! I had 3 pieces left at the end of the night and my kids took care of them!

We grew up making these for holidays and special events. The only difference is we've always used corned beef - the Carl Budding ultra thin shaved kind . Using ham makes them taste a little 'off' to me.  We also always roll the pickles in the center, slice them into bite size portions, usually eating the ends as we slice them as they're not as pretty. they present very nicely on a serving tray, easy finger foods for people to grab, and no toothpicks required. Try them with the corned beef -  you won't be disappointed!

This makes a fantastic, quick, snack (using word snack because I don't know how to spell h'orsderves??) but I mean h'orsderves.  Fantastic, tasty, and it's like using sandwich ingredients without the bread, which is good for me being diabetic, love love love this idea for gatherings.  And like another person said, only rate things if you actually make it according to the original recipe and try it, actually try it and see what it tastes like before you rate it with changes.  That would not be an honest rating.  These 'Yummy Roll Ups' are very good as is.  Thanks for the idea!

I have made this for years with many variations.  It's easily adaptable to your own tastes.  I like to use garden vegetable cream cheese, sometimes I sprinkle with garlic salt, and sometimes I sprinkle with tabasco.  I roll up the ham and the cream cheese and secure the toothpick with a sweet pickle, a cherry tomato, or a black/green olive.  Most of the time I use the whole variety, which makes for a colorful presentation at a party.  It's fun to see which one each of your partiers enjoy the most.

When I have made them I started with a whole pickle. Dry thoroughly with paper towel. Coat with cream cheese, then wrap in 2-3 thicknesses of the wafer thin, packaged meats, making sure it is entirely covered.  Secure with tothpicks and chill until just before time to serve them. Slice about 1/2" thick, place on serving tray and enjoy. (I find that it makes a nice variety to use different flavors of the pressed meat (i.e.) ham, pastromi, beef, corned beef, etc.).

I love these! especially during summer. I sometimes make them with fllour tortillas. Just smear the cheese on the tortilla, then the ham and pickle in the middle. I usually make a lot- wrap tightly with plastic wrap, throw in the fridge and when someone wants a snack they just unwrap and eat. My oldest sum likes to dip these in a hot pepper/ranch dressing mixture. The possabilities are endless with different meat and flavored cream cheese but the written recipe is my families favorite

My friend makes these for church functions a lot and they taste so good! My sister also makes them, but sometimes she will substitute turkey breast for the ham, and she'll dice up jalapeno and mix it in to the cream cheese, then she omits the pickle. Either way, they're fast, easy and absolutely delicious!

These are a crowd pleaser, though I make mine a little differently:  I start with a flour tortilla, spread it with cream cheese, and then layer as indicated here (using thin-sliced ham).

As a self described metrosexual, one would think I would recoil at the thought of showing up with a dish called "yummy rolls." But as one fellow party-goer proclaimed loudly, "I'm passing on the Pate and heading for the pickle-ham-cheesey-toothpick thing!" Bravo Ms. Mcdonald for this celebration of simplicity.

I make these all summer long!  I have found that if you remove the seeds from the pickles and pat them dry, you will not get runny cream cheese if they don't get snapped up (I take them out on the boat!).  Don't be afraid to add a slice of bell pepper, carrot, or even a sliver of cheddar cheese.  If you get the cream cheese all the way to one edge of the ham and get more than three turns on it, they will sit tight just fine without the toothpick!  A great one to play with!!!!

THANK GOODNESS for a loving, helpful mother who helped me prep over 200 of these little suckers for a reception. They are always a hit, and they flew outta the kitchen as fast as we could keep them plated. **I was SlightlY annoyed when I was trying to plan out how much to buy for 200, so it was a ridiculous guessing game. :) You can't buy a jar of pickles that have exactly the same size, and some brands of deli meats work better than others (some tear easier than others).

We've made this is my family for years, except we use green olives instead of pickles. Let the cream cheese soften, lay out the ham circles so they overlap  half way, spread the cream cheese and lay the olives end to end down the center. Roll up so you have a long log. Then wrap in foil and freeze. You can keep them in the freezer until the party, then slice into pieces by slicing the olives in half. Freezing allows for easy slicing and keeps them together on the plate without the need for toothpicks! But we put toothpicks out so they're easy to pick up without getting cream cheese all over.

I just love these.  My mom always made them for Christmas Eve snacking.  I use the dill pickles, but also use sweet pickles which are even better with the ham.  Use a paper towel or clean cloth to dry off the ham if its wet or the cream cheese won't spread well.

So easy and delicious! Made some with dill and some with Gerkins, and both rocked! Just be sure to get enough cream cheese on each one. The cream cheese ties the flavors together, so don't scrimp!

These are sooooo delicious; I make sure to always have ham, cream cheese and pickles on hand so I can whip up a few when I need a tasty snack.  Thank you Courtney!

This is always a crowd pleaser.  Another option is to use green onion instead of a pickle.  They are my fav.  Just a tip, after I roll them, I put them in the freezer for 10-15 min before slicing them.  They then hold their shape when slicing.

I do something similar. I use tender young asparagus or green onions and roll around them. I also do this with turkey slices and smoked salmon.

My grandmother served these to me forty years ago. Also with Asparagus and Bechamel sauce or for an assortment with fresh pineaple spears and rolled in coconut. There are  many ways to create a colourful party plate. Imagination is craetivity I preach to my students.

These are super yummy and definitely help you over reach your sodium load for the day.  One way of making this even easier is to use whipped cream cheese - it spreads easier and use deli thin ham.  Quick, easy and really are yummy!

I love this recipe.  The softer the cream cheese the better.  Secure with a toothpick and put in the refrigerator to regain the firmness if you desire.  I have received so many compliments--whenever I make this inexpensive appetizer!

I make these all the time for my nephew, Cory at Christmas time.  I always drain my pickles too, so they aren't runny.  I have also mixed a package of Good Seasons Italian Salad Dressing Mix into the cream cheese and spread it on.  Everyone loves them.

I just made these and they are wonderful. I used pre-packed ham and Clausen pickle spears. I substituted a garlic/herb spread for the cream cheese. I did dry the ham and spears with paper towels before I used the spread. Very good!

I have not had these with pickles...but I'm going to try them this way and I am sure they will be 5 stars. I use a green onion (mainly the green part) and roll that in there. I also put the block of cream cheese in the microwave for about 10 seconds to make it soft enough for spreading. 
Thanks for the new way.

Pickle Rolls! I've been making these for years after getting the recipe from a friend. They are SO good--one of those things you would never think to put together. and they are so easy, my young son makes them for himself as a quick snack! Glad to see this on here for sharing.

This is great! 5 stars! If you'd like to kick it up a notch, use garden vegetable cream cheese and wrap up pickled asparagus instead of dill pickles. A crowd pleaser every time! I always use thick sliced ham lunch meat. Delicious!

I've been making these for years and they always go like hotcakes! 
It's important to make sure your ham is very dry, and not sliced too thin - otherwise it will be difficult to spread the cream cheese.  I use a jar of dill pickle spears, cut them in half and remove the seeds for more crispiness. I roll them tightly, then cut each roll into three equal pieces for bite-sized appetizers - and there is no need for a toothpick. The cream cheese keeps them from coming apart. A pound of boiled ham from the deli, 8 ounces of cream cheese, and a jar of pickle spears will make a nice sized plateful of appetizers for your next gathering (you may have a few pickle spears left over if you use 1/2 spear in each roll). If you've never had these you are in for a treat!

My mom used to make these years ago, only she would use bologna and sweet pickles.  And like WENDYBURD1, I would eat them until I was almost sick.  We used to make them for Christmas get togethers, but we now do anytime we want.

This is good.  There is another version using a cut portion of green onion in place of the pickle, which is even better.  Take a regular slice of ham and roll up and then cut into thirds and use a toothpick to secure.

Like many others, I've been making these for many years.  Not having read all the review/comments, this may be a repeat, but I've used jumbo pimento-stuffed olives.  I cut the ham into strips, wrap it around the olive, then slice it in half and arrange them cut-side up.  This is particularly colorful for Christmas.

This is the classic version of this recipe; works very well IF you make sure your ham slices and dill pickles are very dry! I dry mine on both sides with a paper towel. It helps the cream cheese spread better. I get more than 5 ham/pickle rolls per 8 oz of cream cheese though--more like 10. This year I ran out of pickles and had to sub pickled jalapeno pepper rings for one of rolls. My husband said he likes that too.

I love these little guys.  I either have to eat my fair share before serving or stash some aside for later because they disappear before I have a chance to enjoy them myself!  I have often made them with Genoa Salami instead of ham and are so good both ways.

So happy to find this recipe on this website!!!  This is the appetizer that we have had at family gatherings ever since I can remember!!!  So simple and so addicting!!!  Best to use cream cheese that is soft and Kirkland brand ham that doesn't tear when you spread the cream cheese on it!!!  Can be made the  night before and then wrapped individually in syran wrap then taken out and cut up when ready to entertain!!!

We love this fabulous appetizer recipe. These are easy, quick and great for any occasion, plus they can be changed up for individual tastes. My husband is not a particular lover of ham so I can use salami for a spicier bite and use sweet gherkins for a sweeter flavor. The possibilities are endless here. When you have this basic recipe the sky's the limit!

This simple recipe was given to me about 16 years ago. My son and his friends requested them for snacks constantly. I gave it 4 stars for the dill with the ham which i like, but prefer sweet gherkins for ham, dill with roast beef.

I have made these for years.  The one thing I do, is have the ham sliced think. I find they stay together without needing a toothpick.  I also cut each one in half. They are ususally the first appttizer to disappear.

This is the BOMB!  And I am not a huge pickle fan. They are okay, but when you get pickles with a sandwich, I usually give it away. I could eat these as a lunch...not just an appetizer.

my only changes: 1) to add a little extra dill to it/sprinkled on the cream cheese since cream cheese and dill go great together....and the pickles I used didn't have much dill flavor to them and 2) 8 oz of cream cheese was a bitmuch for me for 5 ham slices: I used 1 oz per slice so I only used 5 oz of cream cheese.

I always cut the dill spears in half and remove most of the seedy part, roll them up tight, and then cut each cylinder into thirds for bite-sized treats. I've never found the need to use toothpicks to secure them - the cream cheese inside keeps them from coming apart.

Love these!  This is one of the family recipes my husband's mother passed to me. They use to make sweet dill pickles and they work best.  I pour out some of the dill juice and add sugar and top off with water to make my own.  Delish!

These may not be pretty, but they sure are good.  We use reduced sodium ham slices.  You can use any kind of cream cheese (plain, reduced fat or flavored).  We have used laughing cow (reduced fat) cheese.  The possibilities are endless!

My step mother taught me this when I was a kid and have loved them ever since as a matter of fact I have passed it down to my children and they love em also. But what she does is everything shown but each one she takes half of an olive and puts it on it with a toothpick. They are sooooo yummy as a matter of fact they are on my dinner menu for next weekends finger food dinner. She also uses beef for a choice between the ham or beef. My fav is the beef.

I love these roll ups but I don't like sitting at the table making them, so I just toss everything in the blender and serve them as a dip with crackers.  Everyone loves them that way!

Delish, but me and my daughter don´t like pickles so I used asparagus instead and that was awsome, thanks for the recipe though.

These are very good, but for a variation, roll asparagus spears. Then slice them into bite sized pieces. My family has been enjoying these at partys for years.

Any type of pickle will do, or asparagus, or green onions...but to kick it up a bit, I mix horseradish into the cream cheese. It never matters how many I make, there are never any left over.

These are a family staple for us.  We have them at every family gathering and now at every office gathering.   If you ever get the chance to go to the Iowa State Fair, these are called Pickle Dawgs and there is a stand just down from the north entrance.  They use the most delicious pastrami or you can have the ham.  Then you choose regular or spicy cream cheese.  And they use a whole pickle spear.  They are TO DIE FOR with the pastrami.  My favorite app of all time!

This recipe is similar to one that has been in our family for over 30 years...only difference is we use whole pickles and slice them about 1/2 inch thick.  I am fond of using garlic dills...the pickle is what really makes the difference in this recipe...choose the type of pickle you like...I don't buy the cheap ones when I plan to make these.

These are always in demand for family gatherings.  I've found through the years that the softened cream cheese in the little tubs works better for spreading than the block packages.

This has been my "go to" recipe for years when I need a quick appetizer.  The only thing is I have always used bread & butter pickle spears instead of dill.  No matter how many of these I make, they disappear right away.

My mom was making these for me when I was in 5th grade in the early 80's.  They may sound weird, but they are really delish.  And since many other reviewers felt they could rate this recipe after changing everything, I say shame on you.  These are the best just the way they are!

I love these. They are so easy to make, affordable, present well, and they always get eaten up as an appetizer. I was taught how to make these years ago by an aunt of mine. But, after I roll the ham and cream cheese around the pickle I cut the roll into 1" pieces and stand each piece up on a platter.

I am a well-educated, upper-middle class woman and when presented with these snacks I was greatly offended.  BUT THESE SNACKS ARE CRAZY GOOD.  We bring them to every dinner party and make them at LEAST once a week as an after school snack.  EAT THESE.

these were good... i patted the pickle spears dry as well as the ham to cut down on any runny-ness. it was quick and easy to make, however next time i'll add some seasoning to the cream cheese mixture (such as ranch seasoning or even hot sauce... whatever sounds good at the time!) because i felt like they were missing a little something. thanks for sharing :)

My family has been makin these for years, except for we use pepporcini slices instead of pickles and we sprinkle parmesan cheese on top. YUMMY! If you like a little spice try the pepporcinis!

Definitely tasty, but I spent way too much time making these, having made them as one reviewer suggested - using baby dills..what a pain! I would make them again using spears (as the recipe reads!)...that way, you know there's no "lost space" between pickles, etc. I was up until 2am making  these for a tailgate... tasty, but not "two hours worth" tasty - will try with spears  next time - and wiping ham "dry" is key to the cream cheese sticking!

I make these from time to time, except I use bologna instead of ham.  I find it much better even though I don't like bologna on it's own.  If you spread the cream cheese on well enough, you don't need to secure with toothpicks since it stays in place on it's own.

This is an excellent recipe (in my family for years - we called them polish roses), with so many variations! The one thing I do add to my "polish roses" or "roll ups" is that I mix in a packet of hidden valley ranch in with the cream cheese. It's good for an extra kick.

These roll ups have been in our family for years.  I remember eating them as a kid and grew up making them.  Instead of ham we have always used chipped beef.  Its a lot cheaper.  Its a great finger food for parties!

I love these as an appetizer because you can make them the day before.  I have made this exact recipe many times and enjoyed it.  The last time I made this recipe I used flavored cream cheese, finely chopped the dill pickles, and added a little chopped green onions for color.  I thought I was able to spread the filling more evenly and didn't have pickle ends like I do when I don't chop the pickles.

Made these for a party at work.  Co-workers loved them.  I let the cream cheese sit out and get soft before spreading on ham.  Once roll ups were all put together, I put them in the freezer for about 45 minutes.  This made cutting extremely easy and mess free!  Will definetely make these again!

I have no idea why these are good (pickles and ham didn't sound good to me), but they are! I made these a second time to get rid of some leftover ham and had no slices left. I put diced ham and the pickled on a cracker smeared with cream cheese--just as good!

Great snack for people on Atkins.  I keep a tub of the spreadable cream cheese in the fridge as well as a jar of crunchy baby pickles and make these whenever I want a snack.  I don't bother slicing them!

I have been doing these all summer. Some changes I've made are using spicy pickles ....here I use Famous Dave's. I have also used the jalapeño cream cheese and to really make calorie friendly I have used the laughing cow Swiss cheese. They are all wonderful.

I love roll ups! They way my mom & I make them is with cucumbers & turkey instead of pickles & ham. We also mix dill with the cream cheese,  its pretty delicious! I'm not a huge cream cheese so I usually spread a thin layer.

I have made these for years, they are always pleasing to the eye, and yummy as well.  I cut mine into 1/8 slices and serve it on a platter, so it is easier to eat, I also use turkey meat, as some people don't like turkey and serve them together for a choice.  Easy appetizer to make, and it makes my hubby and family happy!

WARNING: These are really addicting. I've made this recipe several times for get-togethers and just to snack on. I had to rate 4 stars for the recipe 'as-is'  because using spears proved to be a messy eat. I switched to mini dill pickles; same great taste, more bite size appropriate and less mess.

This is a really good simple recipe. I just changed it with another type of ham I had on hand, and also used pan-fried asparagus as I don't really like pickle. Picture also uploaded :)

It was great to see this recipe.  I got this recipe 25 years ago and it is one of my husband's favorites.  I have always used Claussen whole pickles instead of spears; they roll up so nice.

I love this recipe.  The only thing is, I've always heard them called Pig Eyes.  When I'm in a hurry and don't have time to let the cream cheese soften, I used whipped cream cheese, because it's easier to spread.  However, I love the texture of just the regular cream cheese.  These are great for New Year's Eve or really an appetizer for any party.

I use dried beef instead of ham. They are salty but taste fantastic and always fly off the table on holidays and football parties that I have. I also roll green onions to lay beside the pickles!!!

This recipe has been in my family for ages and is always a super hit at showers and parties.  The only difference is we use mild pickled okra instead of pickles.  Even those that hate okra (or so they thought) LOVE this appetizer!

Very easy, though a little time-consuming if you make a lot of them as I tend to do.  A variation that I use is to replace the pickles with pickled okra, which gives them more pop and a very interesting look.  Yes, the okra will kind of freak out some people but most folks who've eaten them when I've made them that way have loved them.

These are excellent! I make them for every party I host. However, when I make them I add taco sauce for a lil extra kick. Obviously, the more sauce the more kick. Be careful not to make it too runny though.

We, too, have been making these for so many years that the origin of the recipe to my family and friends is long lost.  I'm 66 years old and my grandmother made these using her homemade pickles and ham from the family butcher.  Now, I use Claussen whole dills because they taste most like what I remember.  I will try using the spears, though, because there will surely be less waste.

These are so easy to make.  Try them with Pickled Okra.  Make sure to pat dry your okra before putting them together.  Puts a new twist on a classic.

These are simple and delicious.  I also used a pickled asparagus spear instead of the pickle/a little fancier!!

Everyone loves these. I would highly recommend using the dill pickles from the refrigerator case (Claussen) and not the general kind found on the regular shelves (Vlasic)

This is a change from my original recipe and I liked it.  If you want to try something different, add some Mrs Dash to the cream cheese, parboil asparagus and follow the same directions.  DDDD

My family LOVES these. We mix it up a little and use green onions or hot (spicy, not warm) cauliflower in place of the pickles. Yummy!

These are so yummy!!  I like to add some garlic powder (about 1/2 tsp for 8 oz. cream cheese) for a little added kick.  These are also great with turkey, hard salami & dried beef.

I've been making this for YEARS!  It just couldn't be more simple, or tastier.  The classic, original version of this is made with dills, and they are best in my opinion.

I have been making these for years, and they are absolutely addictive! Girls' Night, Poker Night, Superbowl, New Year's Eve, Retreats, etc.....they are a great addition to any occasion, and they always go so fast, I have to make huge batches just to make them last for over an hour! They take a little time, but grab a partner and make it a date if you are making a bunch--they are soooo good, and you won't regret it!

We had this for lunch today using reduced fat cream cheese and I whipped in a half batch of my homemade dry ranch dressing mix before using it. I did not need as much cream cheese as called for but I'll have enough cream cheese spread to make this again for the boys' lunch tomorrow. Boy, was this GOOD! Thanks for posting such a great picture of it, mis7up, so that I remembered how yummy this is!

I made a few changes but these are soooo scrumptious. Instead of using pickle I used WELL drained canned diced Ortega Chilis and mixed it in the cream cheese then rolled it. Pure Haven. Thx.

These are such a simple snack and always a big hit. Use good dill spears and pat them dry for best results. Also, tell the deli what you need the cooked ham for and they'll cut it perfectly. Too thin and it just tears.

This is a wonderful long time recipe we've made for our family gatherings of most every occasion.  Picnics, holidays, dinner parties, movie nights, etc... You really can't go wrong.

It's best when using quality ham.  The pickle spears certainly still work well but we've been happier with small whole pickles.  
We usually use whole midget or baby dills vs. the long spears.  We found they aren't as "juicy" and the roll-ups can be easily made further ahead of time as the juice doesn't run as much.  They are also crunchier than the spears like someone else suggested.

Sometimes finely shredded cheddar and/or a little pure prepared horseradish (not the cream or mayo based horseradish) mixed into the cream cheese works nicely for a little extra kick.

I have been making these for years. They are a Christmas tradition. So addicting!  I make them with dill pickle spears (easier to roll)  and with thin sliced ham (it clings to the pickles better).    I also refrigerate them for about an hour, and then, using the sharpest knife I can find, I slice them into 1/2 inch pieces, and lay them flat on a plate. You can always insert toothpicks into them for easier eating.

I usually leave out the pickle, roll the ham and cream cheese and spear a spanish olive on top of the roll.  Simple, inexpensive and tasty.

I absolutely love these. I went to bingo night and a sweet older lady made them. I fell in love at first bite. I use buddig black forest ham. This year i started a new tradition of making a Christmas dinner for everyone since Grandma passed away. Not many people liked the polish roses/ goat peckers/ cowboy sushi. To each his own.

I can’t ding it, because really, this is a perfect & GREAT recipe! The only thing- you will probably need more than 5 slices of ham, if you are using a quality ham (which is key). So is using QUALITY pickles! And I will add, even with being generous with the cream cheese, I still went through 10 slices of ham & quartered 5 large dill pickles to complete this barely using 1 full block of 8oz cream cheese. It makes a decent amount using that- enough to feed a small crowd. And I cut mine into 1/2” pieces... they went QUICK! But seriously- make SURE to pat the ham dry & also drain excess juices from the pickles, otherwise you get a soggy mess.

Okay, I tried this tonight as an appetizer before the chicken pot pie, and my bride thought they were quite tasty. How tasty? A woman who doesn't like to eat too much appetizer because it will spoil her dinner ate two rolls... 16 pieces. The only change I made to the recipe was to substitute onion and chive flavored cream cheese for the unflavored stuff, and the combination worked very well. I tasted one with normal cream cheese, and the flavored stuff worked MUCH better.

These are a tasty and easy appetizer. I used gherkin pickles that I cut in half lengthwise since I didn't have spears. I thought they would be even better with a flavored cream cheese.

So, I agree with the last reviewer that if you changed and ingredients, don't bother rating this recipe. It's perfect as-is. I am from Chicago and had never had this until last winter when I was in Green Bay for a weekend with family.  I guess it's very popular in Wisconsin. The crunch of the pickle, the salt of the ham, the mild cream cheese. You wouldn't think that it would work, but somehow it's delicious. I could eat a tray of these by myself. The key is make sure the cream cheese is softened when you work with it and then give it a chance to chill before serving. It goes together smoothly.

Maybe it was the brand of ham or pickles I used, but neither my husband or I found this recipe as written impressive. I used some tips and switched out the ham for genoa salami. I also mixed some ranch and mayo with the cream cheese on some of them for added flavor. The substitution of salami brought it to 4 stars. Adding ranch and mayo gave it a different flavor but I wouldnt call it better. Still looking for that YUM factor on this one.

These are very delicious using the ingredients that the recipe calls for! They are extremely easy to make, and are very tasty. They look very appetizing when you are finished! My family and I would give these 4.5-5 stars. They are great for parties, or just an afternoon snack!

I actually got this recipe from my Grandma and have been making it for years.  I have tried several variations including using turkey instead of ham and think ham is best.  I sully use the oscar myer honey chopped ham because it is decent tasting, holds up to rolling and is square which makes for easier rolling.  I also make them with scallions instead of pickles which is pretty good too.  It is important to blot the ham with a paper towel because it makes spreading the cream cheese way easier.  I usually blot the pickles too.  I suggest using the long pickle slices or "stackers" because they are more uniform.

It tasted good, but I think next time I'll use cream cheese in a container and not block.  Even softened, the cream cheese didn't spread very well.

Every one loves these! I use whipped cream cheese and whole pickles.  Use a good kosher dill so you have a good  crunch.

I used prosciutto on some and ham on others. They are both delicious and very easy to make. The prosciutto looked fancier than the ham.

These are must-haves for family get-togethers.  I modify this only by adding a bit of grated onion & some finely shredded cheddar to the softened cream cheese.  Easy to make & yummy!!  (Wonder how they'd be with a bit of sweet pickle relish instead of  dill pickles??)

This an easy appetizer that I have made a few times.  It always seems to be finished off.  I have made with ham or turkey and if just using plain cream cheese I will mince up some red or green pepper for color and flavor.  Another is to use Boursin cheese... If using this after rolling up put back in refrigerator to make use it gets as cold as possible before slicing.

Easy, tasty, hearty appetizer!  I served these with potato soup (I had added a little ham to the soup so thought these would be a nice accompaniment.)  Turned out to be a great choice!  I also served deviled eggs to have the additional cold with the hearty winter soup since it is summertime :-). Yummy!!

Yummy!  These are so simple to make and always a big hit at parties.  TIP: use good quality dill pickles.  Also make sure to pat them dry for best results (and make sure the ham is dry too).

I've made these before, but had forgotten about them until I stumbled upon this recipe. I made them for our football & poker party today and they disappeared quite quickly. I did refrigerate the rolls for about an hour before slicing them up, which helped keep them together I think. Thanks!

This is a wonderful 'last minute' appetizer, which I have served several times. Not only are they quick, easy and versatile, they taste good to boot! While probably not something I would want to serve at a more formal affair, among family and close friends they are always a hit. I do agree with another reviewer that the quality of the ingredients are extra important in a simple appetizer such as this.

These are definitely yummy! I used garden vegetable cream cheese and the mini dill pickles instead of spears. I also used half ham and half salami. The salami was a lot sturdier for spreading, but both tasted great. I cut each rollup in half and secured with a fancy toothpick. Great for summer gatherings!

I would say this is my favorite appetizer to eat.  I make them either with ham or with dried beef!  Try the dried beef!!  Yummy!!  Many times I don't even cut them into pieces I just use quartered pickle spears and lay them on a tray.

Be generous with the cream cheese.  I used the garden vegetable light cream cheese and rolled the ham around half a pickle.  yummmmm.  i do recommend refrigerating before slicing for less mess.  You have to use a good quality ham.  If it's too mild it will be overpowered by the cream cheese.

This has been a family staple at parties for over 30 years!  We just use pickles and ham though.  If I ever bring them to a non family event, they get weird looks and then they get devoured.  It's hard to say if cream chees will improve them, but I'll give it a try.

My dad makes something basically the same as this and it's always a hit. Instead of pickled, he uses green onions in the middle.. it's also great with pepper turkey.

This is always a hit at get-togethers.  So simple and versatile, I like using dried beef or pastrami in place of ham. YUM

I have made these for years.  Very easy and very tasty.  Use quality ingredients, it really makes a difference.  Always an empty plate to take home.

This sounded so odd but got such good reviews that I just had to try one. Then two, then three! What a great tasting combo!!!
