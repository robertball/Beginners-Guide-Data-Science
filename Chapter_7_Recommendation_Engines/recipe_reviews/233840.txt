Came out perfect! I cut the recipe down for a smaller family and it was delicious. Stuffing was just moist enough without being soggy.

Substituted panko and some seasonings from our cabinet instead of herbed stuffing mix. Also added some cinnamon and brown sugar to the dressing. Used frozen cherries in place of dried. Omitted walnuts.  This was very tasty and we will likely make again.

Followed the recipe except for "English" walnuts. Couldn't find in our rural area.  Used regular walnuts and it was delicious. My husband  is not a fan of pork, but he really liked it. Wouldn't change a thing.

I made this the other night, as I was having a craving for a homemade stuffing (more-or-less) and was blown away at how easy this was to cook. I never would have thought that simple salt and pepper would be enough to season a pork chop, but it was great. I may alter the seasoning when I make it again. Other than that, I was not prepared for how much stuffing this was going to yield. I might have over-measured. It was still good and it was eaten up with no issues. Thanks!

Leave out the pork and it's perfect!  We are vegetarian and this is our go to stuffing recipe every Thanksgiving.  Everyone loves it!  We use vegetable broth in place of chicken broth and bake in the oven without the foil.
