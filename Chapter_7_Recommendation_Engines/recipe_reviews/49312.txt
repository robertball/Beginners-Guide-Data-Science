Really tasty recipe! The only thing I found odd was the cooking time for the gizzards --- in my experience you must cook gizzards much longer or they come out too tough. I cooked mine about an hour. Other wise great recipe I made it with basmati rice. Also tastes even better the next day so it makes great leftovers!

This is a wondrful recipe for leftover rice. I made just a few changes. I cooked the gizzards in the chicken broth. Used only 1/2 the onion mix. Didn't have canned tomatoes so I used 1 cup fresh chopped tomatoes. A stick to your ribs cozy dish.

Tasted good. Gizzards were tough. Cooked them 40 minutes wasn't enough. Should have put them in the pressure cooker for 15 minutes. I will know better next time.

this was an excellent meal. i followed the recipe to the letter with just one exception i cooked the gizzards in the crockpot for 3 hours first. i had it with cornbread and peas and carrots and my husband said he had never had gizzards like that before and that he liked it my 3 year old even at it up. so again great recipe thanks

I've been doing a version of this for years but in a crockpot since I want the gizzards nice and tender. Haven't served it to anyone who didn't like it even though they might claim they don't like gizzards

This was very good! I usually just bread and fry my gizzards but decided to try this and I am not disappointed. I used some spiced tomatoes and white rice but otherwise just as instructed. This is great if you like gizzards to begin with but wont convert those who don't. I think it has more to do with texture rather than taste. I'll probably slowly change this up over time to make it my own but it is very good as is!

Great way to serve gizzards a new way! I put everything together on a large pan cooked for 45 min. then added the rice. The tomatoes really made the gizzards tender..

So yummy! I used the broth from the gizzards and I probably used a little more than 14.25 ounce but the dish was great and I know we will have it again. I feel like if you omit the gizzards it would be an excellent side dish to chicken!

This is an excellent starting point. I got the dish simmering (before adding the rice) and it seemed a little bland. I added about 1/4 cup red wine and 1 1/2 teaspoons dried tarragon. This really made the dish.

This recipe came out very good. Only given it a 4 star because I didn't use any onio soup mix. If you read my other ratings they are either 4 or 5 stars although my husband is somewhat picky he still likes all the recipes that I've tried. And if you see I usually substitute one thing with another but non the less they all come out tasting great and this one was one of them. Was still very good the next day.

It's very good! Instead of cooking the gizzards in the water I cooked it in chicken stock. I cooked the gizzards a little over an hour. Instead of vegetable oil I used butter. Used a mix of jasmine rice and basmati rice. Added some veggies like yellow squash. And some crushed red pepper to add a little spice! I'll definitely make it again.

10 minutes cook time for the chicken gizzards? I'm guessing that you're enjoying chicken sushi here. Even though they are very good those chicken parts take somewhat longer than ten minutes to become tender and tasty.

Instead of red onion I put in the trinity of diced onions bell peppers and celery. It was scrumptious! Best of all my picky husband loved it and wants me to cook it again.

Actually only made this the 1 time and it was fantastic. I added 1 lb. of mushrooms and the entire pkg of Uncle Ben's Ready Rice (brown and wild rice) and cut up the gizzards prior to cooking about 1/2 hr or so. Even had leftovers on a baked potato...I highly recommend and will definitely make it again.
