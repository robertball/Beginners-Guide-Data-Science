I really liked this. I don't eat sweet breakfasts so this was right up my alley. I tend to prefer waffles since they get crunchier so I am going to try this batter in my waffle maker next time. Neat idea

I wasn't too sure how this was going to turn out while it was cooking but it was really good.  I'd go lighter on the pesto so it's not overkill to serve with some on top. 

I served it with scrambled eggs and bacon.  This would also make a good dinner option.
