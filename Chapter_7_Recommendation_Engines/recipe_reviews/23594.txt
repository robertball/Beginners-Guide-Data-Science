Okay, I read the reviews and went "Hmmmmmmm", so, I did it my way, and these were great.  Frist, I used canned nuts, not raw, didn't heat them, and left out the salt since they were already salted.  Then I mixed together all the sugar and spices, but not the nuts, in a non-stick saucepan.  I added 2 teaspoons of water to the sugar/spice mixture to help dissolve everything, then when it just started to boil, I put the nuts in and kept stirring for about 3 minutes.  Then, I put the nuts in a bowl and microwaved for 2 minutes, stirring every 30 seconds.  This way, all the nuts were not only coated, but glazed as well.  When they were cool, they didn't stick together at all.

This was a terrible recipe as originally written.  I wasted 3 lbs of nuts before I modified the recipe enough to get desirable results.  The spice mix needs 2 tsp. of liquid to adequately melt the sugars so the nuts will be coated.  Although the mix smelled GREAT, there was not enough flavor so I also added 3/4 tsp of cayenne to get a spicy taste.

The sugar completely ruins the flavor and they weren't that spicy.  The nuts came out in burnt globs even though I kept a constant eye on them and stirred them often.  The nutmeg and clove turned bitter in the oven.  I ended up throwing the entire batch out, because even the nuts that didn't burn had a bitter taste to them.  I'll keep looking for a better spicy glazed nut recipe.

This was an easy to make recipe, though I didn't get the mixture to spread over the nuts very well. I tried it a couple of times, b/c it was so easy. My friends weren't fans of it, but it's good for a change of scene. My friends and I are nut people, and I guess we prefer the salt to the sweet/spice.

This didn't melt well.  Also I had to stir constantly or I would have had 2 cups of burned nuts!  Next time I'd try adding a tsp or so of water to get the sugar to melt properly and it might be more like a glazed nut. Taste was good.

I recently made these for a gathering and everyone loved them! Kids loved the sweetness and adults loved the combo. I tried to figure out a way to not have them stick together like some of the other reviews said happened and I took i egg white and beat it till foamy and coated the nuts in it before coating w/ seasonings & this helped the nuts from sticking together that much. Once cooked I placed them on a flat sheet of wax paper and separated them all till dry. the one's that stuck were great though because it was like a sweet nut cluster! Great for parties!!! Thanks Karla

Sorry but,this was one of the worst recipes I have made.It smells great but that is about it.The sugar doen't melt completely and then it clumps so all the nuts do not get coated and the ones that do don't get coated evenly.Doesn't taste bad,but maybe if it had a medium to bind the spice mixture to the nut it would work better.Hopefully I can save the nuts by using them in another spiced nut recipe.2 cups of nuts is not enough for 16 servings even if its just set out in a bowl for nibbling.

Two Thumbs DOWN!  This was something I decided to try since I had some extra almonds and peanuts lying around.  My boyfriend loves nuts so he was really anxious to try them.  In the very beginning I thought the recipe sounded odd with no liquid - its virtually impossible to melt sugar without a liquid or a flamethrower!  I attempted them anyway and I smelled the sugar burning.  I hurried to the fridge to grab something fast and threw in a tablespoon of butter to loosen things up.  What I ended up with was clumps of peanuts, almonds, and lots of little brown clumps that taste like burned sugar and curry.  Horrific.  Follow everyone elses advice and coat your nuts in egg whites first, then add some cayenne to the other spices.  Forget about the clove - its overpowered by the cumin and curry.  Better yet, just find a recipe for candied nuts and add some cayenne to the mix - it worked for me and my Christmas Pecans.

Excellent - my friends rave about these nuts.  If using salted nuts - omit the extra salt in the recipe

I really like this recipe.  The idea about using egg white sounded helpful as it doesn't uniformly coat the nuts.  It doesn't interfere with the yummy taste at all though!  It is a real winner!!

These nuts taste good but the ingredients did not melt like I thought they should.  It got clumpy.  Not all the nuts got the seasoning on them.

I should have taken the time to check all of the reviews.  I spent a small fortune buying good quality nuts and they turned into a complete burnt ruin.  The spices turned bitter under the heat of the oven.  Never again will I try this recipe!

Definitely follow the suggestions of the other reviewers and add a couple teaspoons of water to the sugar mix.  I also changed the spices because I dislike cumin and I didn't think curry was the taste I was going for on these; follow your tastebuds.  I roasted almonds, added them to the melted sugar/spice mix (with water added) and stirred until the nuts were well coated and there was no more glaze at the bottom of my pan.  Then I threw them back in the oven (spread out well on parchment paper) for another 10 minutes until the glaze had set well.  They didn't stick together and they are very yummy.

This recipe sounded a little funky, but turns out great. Once you start eating these spicy nuts you can't stop. This is a perfect recipe to put out at a cocktail party!

I tried this recipe and found, although the flavor was good, the sugar/spice mix did not coat the nuts.  I found it disappointing.

These are good if you follow the advice of the first review. Sugar just doesn't melt like that. I substituted cayenne for the curry because we don't like curry or keep it in the house. Its not a bad recipe you just need something to help out with melting the sugar otherwise it will burn.

These were a great addition to the appetizer assortment preceding a spicy low-country boil. A few changes made all the difference. I started with a can of salted mixed nuts and reduced the salt in the recipe. I added a small dollop of butter to the sugar recipe, and waited until the sugar began to melt before adding in nuts. Took time to separate and dry on waxed paper, without being too picky that every single nut was separated. Both kids and adults liked these!

A complete waste of some great nuts.  All the other negative reviews are right on the money.  I honestly don't know how this came out good for other people. The nuts were a complete ruin; the flavor was weak and bitter.  With no liquid or oils to spread the seasonings to all the nuts, the sugar burned almost immediately.  Don't waste your time, nuts or money on this recipe.  Find a good sugared nut recipe and just add some spice to it.

I wasn't quite sure about this recipe as I was making it, because the sugar seemed to get quite brown and clump, but I put a double batch out at my cocktail party last night and they were such a big hit that they're all gone! The flavour was so nice! One of my friends ate about a quarter of them alone and had fun trying to guess what all the spices in them were. I will definitely be making these again, though perhaps with some modifications so that the sugar glazes the nuts more evenly.

i read the reviews and changed the recipe.  i made this with some old pistachios.  i cooked the nuts on a pan with a tbsp butter.  then, i made the sauce with the spice measurements stated, but i used 1.5 tbsp water, and used splenda instead of the sugar.  i also added about 6 light shakes of cayenne pepper (should have added more).  then, stirred sauce on nuts, and baked at 350 for 10 min.  they are pretty good.  i liked the curry spice in it that some reviewers said was weird.  just thought they were not spicy enough.

With some changes this could be a 4 star recipe. The method is missing some vital points regarding the sugar mixture melting and having coat the nuts. Medium is too high. Try low/medium and add a liquid agent to help the melting process not turn into a burning one. I added some butter. I also did not care for the sweet taste with cumin. Quantities and ratios seem to be a bit off too. Sorry this didn't work out for me.
