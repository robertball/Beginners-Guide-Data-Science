Although I have not tried these it is basically the same recipe I use. The only exceptions are I use the trinity of meat: beef, pork and veal. I also brown the patties then put them in the oven covered with cream of mushroom soup for about an hour. Great memories and great meal.

If you enjoy a plainer type of meat patty, then this is for you.  I personally enjoy things with more flavor.  I would try a recipe with a lot more seasonings next time.

The Kotlety turned out very delicious. What a great meal; it reminded me of my mom's kotlety.

Very good! I grated the onion, used store-bought bread crumbs, and increased the garlic to two cloves. Everything else was per the recipe. Tasted a lot like grandma's!
