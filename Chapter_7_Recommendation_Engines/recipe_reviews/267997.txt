Did not use tomato.  Used sweet potato rather than white potato.

I followed the exact recipe, but discovered that the cooking time was way off. I cooked it on a low heat & it took approx 2+hrs, & checking frequently & stirring, because there is very little liquid & it sticks very easily to the pot. Also I did add another heaping tsp of the red curry paste & this def. improved the flavor. Before I added it, the taste was pleasant but did not have any zip to it & I like a little zip. Note: The Red Curry Paste I used was a Thai curry paste & NOT Indian curry paste, big diff. In the end with this change to the recipe, it turned out delicious. Loved it. Next up is a recipe is a true East Indian recipe.

This recipe was easy to make and lends itself to customize to your liking.  I added a little salt when putting in the lentils instead of waiting until the end to season, and I used a heaping tablespoon of yellow curry paste.   The boyfriend is a recovering vegetarian so I like to occasionally make meatless recipes that are hearty, tasty and satisfy both of us.  I served this over Jasmine Rice with a side of Naan.   Thank you for the recipe, will definitely make again!
