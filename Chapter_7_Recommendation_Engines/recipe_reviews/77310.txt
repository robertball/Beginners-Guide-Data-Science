I have been making this ice cream that uses sweet condensed milk for about 45 yr. The only differance with my recipe is we use 3 can sweet condensed milk , 6 cup half & half, 2 cup whole milk and 3 tabl. vanilla. I creush up 1 1/2 boxes of candy canes in a food processor. You can do them fine or coarse. I mix all ingredients except candy cane and refridgerate at least 1 hour before mixing. Just prior to mixing I stir in candy cane until the candy is pretty well disolved and mix in mixer until set up. if we like the canes to be crunchy we put in mixture about half way through the mixing process. My grandchildren just love this ice cream  This recipe will make 5 quatrs.

Wow!  This ice cream is awesome!  Tastes JUST LIKE the storebought kind!  Even my picky husband raved about this one!  I even doubled the recipe, and it worked wonderfully!  
I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe, it's definitely a keeper!

This was very easy and good. The only change I would make next time is not to crush the candy as finely as I did. Most of it melted into the ice cream during the freezing process. I would do a much coarser chunk. My daughter and son loved this and it is the perfect time of year to make. Thanks!

Delicious! I also had to strain the candy out before putting into it the ice cream maker but I added more chopped candy canes to the mixture while it was in the maker. Thanks for the recipe.

Very easy and have made twice already.  If you chill the ice cream mixture before you put it in the maker, the mint chips might melt a bit and gum up your maker.  We decided to strain the mixture before putting it in the maker (eat the melty mint pieces!) and then towards the end of the freezing process, add more mint pieces!  Yummy!!

A great easy recipe - I love that nothing had to be heated and then cooled... We added a little peppermint extract to help boost the peppermint flavor and it turned out awesome.

This recipe has a little bit of a different texture, but it's still tasty. I followed another reviewer's suggestion and left some bigger pieces of peppermint candy, but mine were too big for my liking. No one wants a crunchy candy cane in their ice cream. A taste is enough. I did add a 1/4 tsp of peppermint extract to boost the minty flavor. Served with chocolate cake for a fantastic holiday dessert! Yum!

The water turns to ice crystals and makes it taste freezer burnt.
