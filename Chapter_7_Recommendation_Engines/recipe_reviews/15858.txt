Yummy salad!  I used yogurt in place of the sour cream to make a healthier salad.  Substituted craisins and almonds for the raisins and pecans.  A nice refreshing salad!

My husband loved this salad!I put more sugar and i mixed with the sour cream before mix with the apples.I didn't put raisins and didn't put the juice from pineapple chunks ( the salad was too "wet" the first time I made it).It was a hit as a desert on Christmas, everybody loved!

This is best to let set in refrigerator overnight or at least a few hours before serving.  I used dried cranberries instead of the raisins and chopped walnuts in place of the pecans.

Thank you for this great refreshing salad recipe.  Will definitely be making it again.

This recipe was a big hit on New Years day, served with a pork dinner!! Everyone asked for the recipe. I only had a small cup full left over!! I did use more sugar as others have. Thanks, I'll be passing this one around!!

I added more sugar (about 1/4 cup - 1/2 cup) to the recipe as well as some cinnamon to taste. We prefer a slightly sweeter apple salad.

This was what it says! Delicious!  I would use it more as a dessert than with dinner.  I used sliced almonds instead of the pecans and everyone loved it!  Only thing prep time took a lot longer to peel the apples so not sure would make it again so quick!!

This was a big hit for a pool party we went to.  I would cut this in half because it makes tons!  I also thought it needed more sugar so I increased it to 1/4 cup and tasted perfect. I switched the raisins for cranberries.

I must have done something wrong.  Way too creamy to be good and had to add ALOT of sugar (about 1C+) before I could choke it down.  Sorry, didn't like this one.

This was refreshing.  I used honey crisp apples because we LOVE these apples.  I also used walnuts and added a little extra sugar and light cinnamon,and 1/2 raisins and dried cranberries.  My husband said this is a keeper!  I won't go back to my Mom's old apple salad recipe.  Thanks!

Its very good!  But I must have found giant apples because I cut mine back to 8 and still only used about half (I had 2 large containers FULL)!!  I also used 1/2 sugar.  Very creamy!

This was decent. But, it made a LOT - and didn't keep well. The raisins really bloat overnight and do not taste good the second day. I also thought it needed more sugar than called for - so I increased it to 1/4 cup. Overall, I thought it was fairly good the first day, but I have made other apple salads that I like better.

made a half batch to use the rest of my sour cream, overall it was good. I like the mix of apple chunks with the smaller raisins and chopped pecans but could use more pineapples in my opinion. :-) definitely making this again.

Really good salad. The sour cream was a nice change from mayo. I used fat-free sour cream and Splenda. I halved the recipe but doubled the amount of sweetener. I'll be making this again.

I made a few changes to this. I used Red Delicious apples, instead of Granny Smith. I added 3 bananas and since I didn't have any sour cream, I used lowfat vanilla yogurt. I also only used 1 cup of raisins, instead of 2. It was good, and nice to know it's lower fat too!

I made this for my kids as they don't care for coleslaw or potato salad.  My husband said it was his favorite out of the three!  I halved the recipe and used walnuts instead of 
pecans and half granny smith, half yellow delicious apples.  Very refreshing.
