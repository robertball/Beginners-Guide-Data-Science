Nice and easy recipe.  My husband is not a big fan of carrots but he liked this.  I used more cinnamon than called for and added a pinch or two of nutmeg.

The thought of sweet cooked carrots usually makes my toes curl, but I served this at Thanksgiving at the request of my husband and mom-in-law and I had to have thirds!  The butter makes them extra delicious and the seasonings aren't too sweet or spicy.

I really liked this recipe... but without the salt. I tried the sauce with the salt (in lesser and lesser amounts) before putting it on the carrots, but I just couldn't get it to taste right. I eventually just omitted the salt, and loved it that way.

These were so good! I love cinnamon so I used more. I didn't even take the time to julianne the carrots. Subbed honey for the sugar. Thanks!

I made thes first at home for my wife and myself and loved them.  I next made the dish for a meeting of our local Lions Club. The carrots were a hit, even an ex-Marine, who dosen't eat vegies, liked them.  Feeding 40 plus, I sliced them thin on a bias and and took less time than juleinned. The combination of the salt, cinnamon, and sugar is "unique" but also a pleasent surprise.

This was great and so easy. I was looking for something a little different than the usual "plain carrots" side and this was exactly what I was looking for. 

I left out the salt.  I didn't feel it was necessary.  They had just the right amount of spice to them.  A new classic for our house!

Simple and delicious.  I might up the cinnamon just a little more and let them simmer in the butter sauce for a few minutes (3-5) to let it soak in more.

This was pretty good. I thought they were a bit too salty, but hubby disagreed. Not 5 stars because it didn't blow us away, but definitely pretty good. A nice change to have cinnamon paired with savory flavor, not just sugar.
