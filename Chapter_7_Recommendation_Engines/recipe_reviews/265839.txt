These are great to have for the morning commute breakie. I lined the pan with parchment instead of using the oil. They popped out and were super easy to cut into bars.

Very good! I have been looking for a recipe I could make at home to replace the store bough frittatas. I didn’t know if I’d like it with the hash browns since I thought it may be too many carbs because I I do count carbs as part of my diet. The changes I made were using the reg hash browns, cheddar cheese, Canadian bacon and putting in some sweet peppers.   The end result was very tasty and I will be making them again.  My husband even gave them a thumbs up and he usually does not typically like that kind of breakfast food.

LOVED THIS I used Lawry’s salt and no pepper and then I baked using jumbo muffin tins. We ate the first round for lunch with fresh corn on the cob. This is a new favorite! 
Next time I’m going to try substituting fresh cauliflower for the hash browns to reduce the carbs.

Husband wanted breakfast for dinner.  I decided to go with this recipe for the main dish.  Wanted to make sure the potatoes weren't soggy, so I put those in the bottom of the pan (with some season salt and pepper) in the oven while I got everything else ready.  Meanwhile I beat the eggs and chopped the ham, gathered other ingredients.  Sprinkled ham, poured SIX beaten eggs (per many reviews), the seasonings, and sprinkled with cheese.  I baked maybe 30 minutes, then moved closer to heat to brown for about 5 minutes.  ~~~Husband said he could have eaten all of it.  This would be good with different meats or cheeses.  I think I'd like to try with sautéed bell peppers and onions.  Husband rated 5 stars.  I will make again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Made these this morning after thawing hash browns.  I sauteed a thick slice of Vidalia onion and 1/2 of a green bell pepper first before adding to mixture.  These were golden brown in about 38 min. and tasted great.

It had too many potatoes for my taste, but I suppose that's ok for most folks.  I did increase the eggs to 6 & added a pinch of Lawry's salt, but thought it was still a bit bland.  Perhaps with crumbled sausage it would have more flavor.

This recipe is so simple and easy to make. It’s one of those “why didn’t I think of that recipes.” I added onions and extra cheese to mine and they turned out great! So delicious!! I will definitely be making these again!

I made this with 4 eggs, 3/4 c. pepper jack cheese, 4 strips of bacon cut into small pieces and Potatos O'Brien (frozen hash browns I had cooked).  I baked it for 15 minutes.  Delicious!

I really liked this recipe. I did however make some changes. I noticed that  4 eggs doesn't seem to be enough. Therefore, I added 2 more and it came out perfect. Now, it does take a bit for it to brown and here is where I slightly changed the procedure. Although the recipe calls for baking it uncovered, I did so to set the eggs and then proceeded to broil it for about 5-10minutes and that fixed the problem. Will definitely make this recipe again!

What a wonderful idea. I will be making this often to keep on hand on those days I'm in a hurry to get going. I'm adding garlic powder & will substitute either bacon or sausage at times  for a change.

If you like potatoes, this is great. It was super easy and fast to put together.  I was told by the family that it was a little dry.  I'm not accustomed to "wet" hash browns, so I don't know what they expected. They did like this with ketchup even though I did not do the ketchup route.  Personally, I thought it had the right amount of everything and is ideal if you need to throw something together fast to feed a few people at once because the effort you have to put into this is minimal.  This is also something great for beginners in cooking because they will get a good result without anything being complex.  Super fast for super busy people...and nice to reheat.   Plus, you can put your own spin on this with different cheeses, vegetable, spinach, mushrooms, or whatever because it is very easy to make it to your own taste.  I would give it 4 1/2 stars for ease of preparation and taste.   I will probably make it again, but may add some other ingredients like sauteed onions.  Overall, a great base recipe, great for those who don't have much time, and also great for those who aren't confident in more complex cooking...also great to double and make for several people if you have a brunch crowd.

I logged on today and found this just had to try it. We had all the ingredients EXCEPT hash browns so I used mushrooms. It tastes great although it didn’t come out in a bar shape. The mushroom juice killed it. So I know to use hash browns next time. Followed the recipe otherwise. No changes needed to this we didn’t have hash browns btw

Easy, quick, tastes great! Made as instructed except I used the hash browns with peppers & onions included. Don’t add  any extra salt especially if making with ham.  Tried freezing leftovers to see how they were when re-heated & they turned just as good as the day I made them....maybe better!  Will make again.

I love how simple and quick this is to put together. Since I was able to use pre-diced ham, frozen diced hash browns with peppers, and shredded cheese the only real “work” was beating the eggs. Only modification: two extra eggs. It’s cut up and wrapped in plastic in my refrigerator for breakfasts this week.

Excellent!  What I like about this recipe is that it is versatile (can suit a variety of picky eaters by changing the meats, cheeses and potatoes), easy and it is a great "make ahead and freeze option".  I increased the eggs to 6 and reduced the potatoes to 2.5 cups as the ratio of potato to the rest of the ingredients were  too much for me.  I also baked it covered for the 40 minutes.  I'm a meat-eater and rather taste meat than potato and want more protein than carbs. This recipe is a keeper for me.

I used 6 eggs, but added two more after I had it in the pan. It didn't seem like there was enough.  I used the four cheese Mexican blend since I didn't have the other mix. I used the Simple potatoes for this batch but will use the frozen ones next time. I still had to cook it for  40 or so minutes, I think because I added the extra eggs. It turned out very good, and i will make it again!

This is easy to put together, but I did feel that they needed extra ingredients; next time I will add onions and more cheese.  I couldn't find the southern style hashbrowns and so used the O'Brien potatoes, and that could have made a difference.  I will try this again.  Thanks for an easy breakfast.

Super quick, super comforting, and super easy to double for extra freezer stock! It’s a great hearty breakfast recipe that the whole family can grab and go out the door on rushed mornings, or for older kids to make themselves on the weekends with minimal supervision. Next time I’ll probably add some green onions and a dash of hot sauce for a little variety.

5.24.19  Oh yeah, we liked these a bunch!  Added a bit of chopped red bell pepper for a pop of color, and we added some sriracha at the table.  The texture was absolutely perfect, moist but still able to pick up to eat (no fork required), and great for portion control, as well.  Easy.Easy.Easy!  This is another Smithfield® breakfast recipe that I’ll be using when we have friends and family visiting.

These are so good and so easy. My kids prefer sausage over ham, so I swapped it. I added a generous portion of salt & pepper and doubled the recipe for my 3 hungry boys. Will def make these again.

This recipe was great. My entire family enjoyed it. I think it needed a little more egg to blend it better together but otherwise, we will definitely try it again soon!

I made this for my own Mothers' Day celebration, because brunch sounded good, and because I did not want to go to a crowded restaurant.  I had a "hankering" for ham, but did not want to purchase a large ham.  I found Smithfield's Anytime Favorites, which is a small quantity, perfect for this recipe.  Mine took about 10 minutes extra cooking time.  I served it with fruit and toast, and the family loved it.  DS#1 also had a suggestion, to use it as a filling for a breakfast taco, with some pico de gallo!  Next time, I'd like to try it with Potatoes O'brien!  I did not use the full quantity of salt, advised by the recipe, and other than the extra time in the oven, I followed the recipe.  Thanks for the idea!

Made it for weekend guests.  Very positive reviews. Served it as a breakfast casserole. Easy to make with not too many ingredients. 
Also good a couple days later right out of the fridge and eaten as a quick finger food snack or lunch.

Great recipe to make ahead for a Sunday morning hike. Also can use any combination of ingredients that you would use for an omelet.

I followed the recipe as stated and added a few shakes of cinnamon because I love it.  Of course, I had to tasted them tonight and they're delish. I can't wait to grab a couple for the ride to work in the morning.

I added onions, bell pepper, and mushrooms. Just mixed all the ingredients together and baked it. Then I broiled it to get this beautiful brown. Excellent recipe

This recipe is so versatile. I like to make it at the beginning of the week so my son has a hearty breakfast before school instead of cereal every morning. I actually double the eggs though. The variations I've done are adding veggies (shredded zucchini, red peppers), fresh parsley and herb goat cheese. Super easy to throw together!

I used tater tots instead of hash browns. This was really good, and also still excellent 4 days later. We got a lot less than 6 servings though - more like 3.

I made these as the recipe directed and they make a delicious on-the-go breakfast -- especially with a little hot sauce on top.  So much better than the peanut butter and jelly sandwiches I had been taking to work!  I will definitely make these again.

Pretty easy. I used 9 pieces of bacon, 2 cups of cheese and 6 eggs along with the hash browns. It did take a bit longer to cook. More like an hour. I split the portions between a large muffin tin and an 8 x 8 dish since I did not have the size in the directions.
