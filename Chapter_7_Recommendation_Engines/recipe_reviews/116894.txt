I'm not a big cauliflower fan, but I couldn't get enough of this stuff! I scaled it all the way back to 2 servings and used frozen cauliflower florets. I just steamed those in the microwave for a few minutes, then added them to the butter mixture in the skillet and let them simmer while the rest of the meal finished cooking. Thanks!

Simple and delicious, even without the chicken broth. As I poured the butter over, I left the minced garlic behind. Also added broccoli for contrast.

Wonderful! I have the original protein only grandaughter (6) who shuns most veges, but she ate two helpings of this. Now, I can't leave a recipe alone, so I used 1/2 cauliflower, 1/2 broccoli, no broth, used a couple tbsp of the vege steam water instead,  1 tsp olive oil (keeps the butter from burning) and cooked the garlic longer that 2 minutes, until it was browned, like in the picture. Finished with a light sprinkling of kosher salt. A hit!

Very good. Although you would surely need to like the flavor of vinegar..which I do!

This was easy to prepare, while I poured the mixture onto the cauliflower, I held off the garlic.  It was good, nothing special for me personally though.

This is so simple but delicious and a good alternative to all the cauliflower recipes with a lot of  cheese, cream or mayo. I followed it exactly except I used 1/4 bullion cube in water since I didn't have broth on hand. The butter and garlic give so much flavor. Even with the bullion and some additional salt it wasn't salty. Will be making it again.

I think this is delicious! I didn't use the chicken broth. I used white pepper. Thanks for the recipe!

The best.  Hard to believe such an easy recipe can yield such a wonderful dish.  I added broccoli as well b/c I didn't have a whole lot of cauliflower.  I accidentally overcooked my cauliflower and brocolli and it stil turned out wonderful.  I will definetely be making this again and again.  Next time I will keep a better eye on the steamer.  I also may sprinkle some bread crumbs next time and throw it in the broiler for a little crunch. Thanks for sharing !

If you love garlic, these are excellent.  Consider tapering back if you want less of a garlic-punch.

When I tossed the sauce the garlic bits landed more on the side of the bowl than on the broccoli, but they'd mostly imparted their flavor anyhow. Be sure to get those bits tender and pour over your veggies right away. Excellent, easy way to dress up your side!

Excellent!! I've looked for a long time for a cauliflower recipe that was healthy and had flavor.  This has it all! I have to admit, while looking at the amount of liquid/sauce, I was skeptical that it would sufficiently coat the cauliflower.  It did.  Was wonderful.  This will become part of my regular rotation for certain.  Thanks!

Easy prep for sure.  I too like another reviewer left the galic in the pan and just added the butter mixture.   The garlic flavor was a bit overpowering for us though.  I will make this again with maybe 1/2 the garlic.  Thanks for the recipe.

Thanks Teri Anne! I had some cauliflower and was looking for a cauliflower dish without so many calories, this was perfect! The only changes I made were a little red pepper flakes and I didn't want to open a whole box of broth so I mixed a little of a bouillon cube with water. Thanks again!

This was okay but definitely prefer the "company" cauliflower recipe better from this site.

Forgot to add the chicken broth, will next time. Tastes good without it, but I just added a little cayenne pepper.

I am giving this a 4 star.  I love cauliflower and thought the garlic was a bit overpowering.  Hubs said he really liked the cauliflower prepared this way and he hates cauliflower.  I made the recipe exactly.  I didn't change a thing.

Since I found the chicken broth didn't add any flavor, I would skip it in the future and just add 1 or 2 tbsp of water, if needed.  I would also replace the butter with EVOO since that also didn't add much to the flavor.  Then I'd toss the cauliflower in the pan until all is covered.  The idea was good, though, to perk up steamed veggies.

I made this using ready prepared garlic and ginger.  It was very tasty.  it is winter now in SA and the ginger added some heat.

Didn't really care for it.  The garlic and broth gave it a little flavor (very little).  Cauliflower was just too bland.
