this was yummy instead of just using it as a dip. i topped my strawberry cakes with it and it turned out awesome. i just bake a cake mix ( white, yellow or strawberry) than while warm poke holes in it and pour warmed strawberry sauce over top and let cool than top with this dip and cool more.

So rich and creamy, I could eat this with a spoon.  Change nothing.  It's perfect as is.
