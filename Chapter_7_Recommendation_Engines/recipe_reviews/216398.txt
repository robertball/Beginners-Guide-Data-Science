I used drums only, as that is what I had on hand. It was so simple to throw together. I actually forgot the final step of the syrup but we loved it as it was. We are garlic lovers so this was great. Oh, I didn't have fresh cloves so I used jarred minced garlic. We didn't get to spread the garlic over the chicken but it baked into the drums and then covered the potatoes!! YUMMY!!

Ya'll, this is totally off the hook. The only changes I made were to add two sweet potatoes and to omit the maple syrup. I would have LOVED it, but hubby has a problem with sugary-sweetness in meat dishes, but he loves sweet potatoes. It was fantabulous! I had five very picky boys in the house and the table was quiet! I know, right? That alone should speak for itself. I am putting this into my weekly rotation. The potatoes are addicting and so delicious! It was super easy to assemble, too. Thank you, thank you, thank you!

This was delicious and so easy! Thanks for sharing. I'm going to add a little more detail. I had a 4 pack of chicken thighs I wanted to use, so that's what I used instead what it called for. I only had a small square brownie type pan, so I used that instead of a roasting pan. I used one whole garlic cluster, separated and peeled, about 14 cloves or so. I had to bake it 20 extra minutes to get the thermometer to 165. I don't think it needed all that garlic, not that it hurt it at all, but you really only got the garlic taste by smooshing the cloves onto the chicken at the end, and each piece used about 2 cloves. It turned out great and the potatoes were to die for! I didn't have to add any salt once to them on my plate (which is unusual for me) and they were so buttery! I will be adding this dish to my regular rotation.

This is a very mild dish. I added a few carrots, an onion, and replaced the legs with tenders because we won't eat dark meat. Tenders also cook faster than bone in meat. If we make this again, I will try some sweet potatoes, a side of butternut squash and more spice for the meat. As an aside, this is naturally gluten free if you use GF spices, and so forth. I love recipes with simple, natural ingredients. This was quick to assemble, and I was able to make a batch of No Bake Cookies V while it baked. =)

This was good.  I cut the recipe in half because I only needed to feed three.  I did keep the butter at 1/4 cup, because there would not have been enough to coat the pan otherwise. At the end, I took the roasted garlic out with tongs and put them through my garlic press into a bowl.  I stirred it and then spread it on the chicken with a knife.  I put the potatoes in the serving bowl first and put my left over garlic in the bowl and distributed it through the potatoes with a spoon then I dished up the chicken.

I made this for the first time today and it was completely easy and absolutely delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly but left the chicken and potatoes in the oven for an extra 10 minutes to make sure they were done (I couldn't find my thermometer).  As a vegetable, I added plain green beans and I spooned some droppings over them.  Thank you for this great recipe!!

Just wonderful, not only was the chicken excellent, the vegetables were a huge hit. I added carrots like some of the other raters here and they were great! Definitely adding to the rotation.

This was quite good. My wife showed up with some chicken legs and gave up before her first Christmas dinner (I've been doing it 6 out of 6 years now.)  Live in Japan and only have a mini oven so wasn't sure how this would turn out.  No garlic cloves, so substituted for about 60 shakes of garlic powder and added some rosemary.  My oven needed about 20 extra minutes to brown it.  My picky kids ate it up! Thanks for the simplest recipe!

This was pretty tasty- I followed the recipe pretty closely just added a few extra veggies and some herbs. It smoked up my house pretty bad, but I can live with that.
It's four stars only because it was kind of greasy- a little too greasy for my taste. Too much butter I think.

Found this recipe online tonight and whipped it up for my hungry boys. It was so easy and turned out delicious. I didn't have pototoes but made up instant mashed instead which was a nice side as I used the pan drippings as gravy. They all wanted 2nd helpings!! Thanks for posting!

I made this recipe last week and hated it. The chicken didn't taste right and all I could taste was garlic. But,I decided to try it again. This time, I used only legs and thighs, no white meat and no maple syrup. I used 28 cloves of garlic and baked it for a good hour. I had peeled the garlic this time and made sure everyone got some on there plate. This time, it was fabulous! I felt it needed a few more potatos, but other then that, delicious! And no left-overs! I will make this again.

This was delicious and so easy! I also put in some onions. The poatatoes truned out so good. After the 40 minutes I took it out and brushed maple syrup over the chicken pieces, and spoon pan drippings over the potatoes. The I also for the last 20 minutes I losely put foil on it. I found that I couldn't taste the maple syrup. But it truned out really good. I will be during this one again.

This recipe makes easy, comfort food.  I am giving this 4 stars because my husband really liked it, but I thought it was a little ordinary.  The chicken was done earlier than the potatoes, so I removed the chicken and let the potatoes continue cooking until they got crispy edges.  I added some paprika and onion powder and would add even more herbs if I were to make this again.

I give only 4 instead of 5 stars because time was nearly doubled and though we did not use the maple, we found it to be quite bland. I suggest rubbing chicken with salt and pepper prior to laying it in pan, with lightly seasoned potatoes. Next time, we will do so as well as add a teaspoon of cajun seasoning.

Just got thru MAKING and EATING this delicious recipe! Husband was VERY IMPRESSED! We'll be making this one for years to come! We left out the Maple Syrup (not a fan of that taste with dinner), used russet tators instead of Yukon Gold, but other than that, I just followed the recipe! 
It was SOOOOO yummy!!! Thank you so much for a QUICK, EASY & VERY TASTY MEAL! We busy mothers need more like this one :)))

Delicious! I did add carrots and 1/2 an onion and had to leave off the maple syrup. I used minced jarred garlic and added about 3 1/2 heaping TBS, and it was great. I feel a lot of salt was needed, definitely more than a sprinkle.

I've made this a couple times already and both times it turned out fantastic. So easy and all the ingredients you probably already have on hand. I only used 14 cloves of garlic - not sure about the 24. 14 was just fine for us. Every one always gobbles it up.

So delicious!  I just love how the garlic is roasted and how the potatoes taste!  I used breasts instead and added carrots, it came out just as yummy!

Very good. I'm going to try it with boneless, skinless chicken breasts next time because we really don't care for dark meat. I just wanted to try the recipe in it's original form before modifying it :)

This is great.  I added carrots and onions and when it was done it tasted like when my dad would roast chicken and have these things below it.  I am going to make this again for sure!

Another fabulous recipe from this site. I added a chopped green bell pepper and an onion. I didn't have whole garlic cloves so I went with a couple tablespoons of minced garlic instead. I also went with chicken breasts cut into chunks. I'll double the sauce next time because everyone loved it so much.

Uh Hello! This is one AMAZING dish!! My hard-working husband found it very, very filling and that's not an easy task! The only changes I made were that I peeled the garlic and added it during the last 20 minutes of baking. I'll be making this a LOT more often.

A tasty and easy way to prepare roasted chicken and veggies. A versatile recipe that you can tweak to your taste. For example, I used sweet potatoes instead of yukon gold potatoes; added chopped carrots and sweet onion; and seasoned with fresh thyme and rosemary from my garden. The sweet potatoes were a great compliment to the maple syrum, and the house smelled great while this was baking.

Wow!  I'm late at picking up the art of cooking.  So easy recipes with "pow" taste are definitely welcome and this meets that criteria!  I never would have thought of using Maple Syrup (which I didn't have and used good old Aunt Jemima 15% maple syrup); or would I have thought of the garlic thing (unpeeled and then use the soft inside goodness for basting at the last step!)  Nice touch!  Thanks for sharing!  Recipes like these on allrecipes are making me look like a semi-pro!

This dish was yummy for an easy weeknight dinner.  Only thing I found was that the potatoes will a little bland, next time I think I would add some diced garlic and maybe some onions to the potatoes for some flavor.  Otherwise dish was great - the maple syrup made the chicken skin nice and crispy.  Would make this again!

This was really tasty!  I added carrots to the pan and used minced garlic which I spread on the chicken before baking.  I also used just a touch more maple syrup and brushed it on three times over the last 20 minutes of baking.  The chicken was perfectly done after one hour - the recipe time was right on!

This recipe is wonderful.  I added some baby carrots and Vidalia onions and they caramelized really well with the maple syrup.  I baked them a little longer than the recipe suggested.  Next time I will broil it for 10 minutes after baking to get the chicken a little crisper.

This was just ok for me, maybe I needed to let it cook longer than the stated time.  I also used regular baking potatoes instead of Yukons.  However, it did make the most wonderful dipping sauce for my crescent rolls!

Very good and very easy to make!  Added carrots and they were delicious!  Even my husband, who claims to hate cooked carrots, ate them all up!  My 2 year old, picky eater, even loved this recipe!  For sure going to make this again!

Maple syrup is not cheap or easy to obtain in my area, so I used apricot syrup instead, to wonderful results. Both chicken and potatoes were done a lot faster than what the recipe predicted, about half the time, actually. And I really loved how the garlic came out using this technique, which was new to me.

This was a great recipe! I kept it the same but I used a packet of lipton onion dry mix. Coated all over chicken and potatoes. I opted out the syrup too. It came out awesome! My husband loved it. Will make it again.

This recipe tasted amazing for as simple as it is and all the family went back for more and asked for it again.  It's great for left overs and if you don't make enough there might be a scramble for the last bite!!  :-)
I added onions which tasted great with this recipe as well.

I used this recipe to roast a family pack of chicken legs that I wanted to dissect for the meat and then roast the bones for broth.  The smell when they were roasting with the garlic and butter was heavenly and if I was a dark meat chicken eater I would have dived in at that point.  However the meat is now in the freezer and the broth is in process.  I will come back to this recipe again to actually make it as stated and eat the chicken as is.  I'm sure the potatoes are wonderful also - I didn't add any this time.  Thanks!

This was so tasty. I doubled the butter, because... butter. Also, I made it in 2 9×13 pans as that's what I had available. Turned out great, which was a relief because I'm not the most proficient cook.

In fairness to the creator, I admit I cooked in the crockpot.  I thought the flavor was a bit bland or lacking something ...maybe thyme, rosemary, onions or another herb would dress-it-up...either way, i will try again in the oven next time.

This was a good recipe. I felt like it was missing a little something or maybe i just didnt get the juices all over the meat and potatoes as well. Nonetheless still a good recipe and may try again

Delicious!!  I added carrots because we love roasted carrots.  I did not add maple syrup, but everything else was the same.  I'll definitely make this again.

This was ok. A lot of garlic, which didn't seem necessary so I cut back on it. The chicken was good. It was a switch from  bbq chicken, but honestly nothing special. I will probably use this again as a quick go to meal. The potatoes came out beautifully. I just kept basting to make sure everything would be moist.

This chicken was delicious!  It was moist and had a great flavor.  I only added about 6 garlic cloves and that worked fine.  Next time I would add some diced sweet potatoes along with the regular potatoes.

It was good, but I made it for the family so this wasn't on my "tonight I feel like eating this..." list.  I will be making this again!  The maple syrup caught me off guard but it actually tasted delicious :)

This was fabulous and so easy!  I had no leftovers!  We are not fans of chicken legs, so I used three large bone-in chicken breasts and cooked them for the same amount of time the recipe states for legs.  Awesome!

Great, quick and easy!!  I make a syrup chicken recipe that may family loves.. this was a nice change..  I used a 9x13 cassarole dish and it worked just fine...just throw everything in there and put in the oven.  My potatos came out perfect.. .i did have to cook a little longer.. I also turned to broiler on at the very end to crisp up the chicken skin...I will for make this again..

I loved how simple this was and how delicous it came out.  The chicken was tender, the skin browned nicely, and it smelled heavenly.  It's very garlicky, but I had NO problem with that.  The garlic paste that smooshed out of the clove, that I spread on the chicken at the end, was just perfect.  I had never used garlic like that, but I loved it.  I didn't have any potatoes, so I made wild rice to go with the chicken.  That was OK, but I would definately prefer potatoes, for the starch they would add to the sauce, as well as how beautifully they would brown.  I will definately make this again, next time with the potatoes.

My husband loved this and I thought it was just ok. The maple syrup is the best part which surprised me. I don’t usually eat the skin on the chicken and I don’t usually like too much sweet in my dishes. The way the maple syrup made a glaze on the chicken skin was fantastic. If I make this again I would put the potatoes and garlic in first they took longer than my chicken. Also I would go ahead and peel the garlic it was kind of hard to squish out the hot cloves.

I doubled the potatoes and added a bag of baby carrots as we wanted extra veggies with our leftovers. In an attempt to compensate for the extra food in the roaster, I doubled the butter and maple syrup. Had more than enough drippings to baste the chicken with and serve with the meal. Probably didn't need to do that much  after all. May try 1&1/2 times the amounts of each next time and down from there if needed. 
And yes, the garlic flavor comes from opening the cloves at the end which is fine as everyone could smear on as little or as much as they liked.

So amazing and super simple.

I turned this into a one dish wonder and added zucchini along with the potatoes.  I also managed to forget the maple syrup at the end, however, this dish was amazing even without.  I know going forward we will most likely purposefully skip that, based on what I know now.  Probable that we will never know just how awesome this dish really is, since we haven’t tried that and don’t really know.

The addition of the zucchini added quite a bit of water, as the zucchini cooked down.  This go-round I layered potatoes, zucchini, then chicken.  In the future, I will layer zucchini, potatoes, then chicken so the potatoes don’t end up boiled as much.

All super amazing.  Great dish...even if I did inadvertently modify the recipe.

This was really pretty good. I did omit the syrup as I had made a side dish I didn't feel would pair well with the syrup. Would probably make again. Also, had regular russet potatoes on hand so used those in place of the Yukon golds.

Followed This recipe exactly and it’s excellent. At first I was skeptical about the maple syrup but it really all comes together and it is absolutely delicious and tender. The only way I will ever eat chicken leg quarters!

I had a family pack of chicken thighs and potatoes I needed to use up...this was perfect!  I made per the recipe except for the maple syrup (we don't care for any sweetness in our chicken), and you can season ths as you like.  The remaining pieces that we didn't have for dinner, I was able to freeze for meals at a later time.  I will be making this again (no need for the recipe--easy peasy!)

This was very good, I added some chicken scratch seasoning but followed the rest of the recipe. I added steamed broccoli and brussel sprouts as a side. The next day, I took all the leftovers and pulled the meat from the bones, threw it in a pot added the left over veggies. Put in some water, canned carrots, some pasta and had one of the best chicken soups.

Amazing! My whole family, including my 9 year old, couldn’t get enough. Few changes: used margarine instead of butter, skipped the syrup, added some garlic powder since I didn’t have enough drag garlic (14 cloves instead of the 24 mentioned). The flavor was amazing!

This is first time I prepared this dish so I followed the recipe to the word, with exception of the garlic, I only had eight cloves. It was fantastic. My wife & two sons loved it. Basting is definitely key & it has an interesting combination of salty & sweet. I prepared it with red potatoes & I roasted an additional pan of sweet potatoes & turnips. I was curious to see how the glaze would taste with them & we were not disappointed. Next time around I will be trying it with that combo prepared directly with
 the chicken. I will be adding this to my regular rotation. Especially with with winter around the corner, great comfort food.

I used pre-chopped jarred garlic instead of garlic cloves, and microwaved them with the butter before pouring over the potatoes and chicken. Followed the rest of the instructions and the dish came out perfectly! My family and guests loved it!

Made this for 11 people with 24 chicken legs, 1# carrots, about 8 potatoes & 2 heads of garlic - had to put it in 2 pans to hold everything! I added some fresh thyme & rosemary that I had as well as butter, salt & pepper. I didn't add much syrup since I wasn't sure if I'd like it - couldn't tell when it was done. I liked the veggies as much as the chicken. Cooked it about 10 minutes longer just to make sure the chicken was done. Everyone loved it & there weren't many leftovers - will definitely make again - so easy! I might peel the garlic next time to make it easier to spread since it was too hot to squeeze initially.

Omg I pretty much followed this recipe as written. I did use jarred minced garlic instead of fresh and I added thyme just cause I like thyme. I double the batch making one with a family pack of thighs and one with a family pack of drumsticks. 2 packs thinking I would have left overs. Nope not one piece it was that good.

Works just as well with chicken breasts. Such a great tasting meal. Add some carrots and chopped white onion in that bad boy too, and now you're speaking my language.

Was good, but needed to cook in a larger roaster. Ended up having to seperate the chicken form the potatoes and I added  a bag of frozen baby carrots defrosted. I just drizzled a bit of maple syrup on top at end of cooking time. I basted about 3 times.

This was delicious and easy.  The change I made was to use about half a bag of mixed Sunset Fingerling Potatoes. This ensured that the potatoes were very well cooked and the flavor variations  just enhanced the whole dish.

I made this last night and it was absolutely a hit with everyone! never did I think  to put garlic unpeeled under the meat but I will forever do it that way for now on. The flavors were soaked in every bite and it was delicious. Only thing I did a little different was add half an onion to the dish. Making this again for sure!

Smells amazing as it is cooking... You might think that it would be sweet but the combination of the maple and garlic is great.  I made it without the potatoes and served it with mashed potatoes, great combo.

What's not to like? I made this on a busy night and it took me less than 10 minutes to prep. I generously seasoned the chicken and potatoes with garlic powder, to save time, and added a dash of rosemary. I didn't use maple syrup, but will next time. I also baked it for 1 hour, gently turning the potatoes once. As always, I let the chicken sit about 5 minutes to seal juices. The potatoes were perfect, the chicken was moist and the skin was brown. I thought my family was going to lick their plates when they were done.

This was so simple & such a big hit at my house of picky eaters. I modified just a bit. Used only boneless/skinless thighs. Added 2 sweet potatoes to 3 Yukon golds, added celery, minced red onions, & peeled the garlic. Seasoned with seasoning salt, thyme, basil, rosemary & some grub rub (a brown sugar based rub.) I served with some crusty French bread that I smeared the roasted garlic on. It was perfect! Will add to my rotation.

I tried this last evening and I have to say, I did not think (even with all of the reviews) it would be so wonderfully tasty and easy!  I was thrilled.  I added carrots like some of the suggestions and used red potatoes.  This did not disappoint.  I will definitely be making this again!

I was looking for an easy no-fuss recipe and voila here it is. Where have you been all these years? This was phenomenal!!!!:-D My family of 7 finished it off with no leftovers. Even I was scraping the bottom to gooble up the gooey pan drippings. I followed the recipe pretty closely except for 2 things. I used warm honey mixed with a dollop of butter instead of the maple syrup as I was out, and I added some dried rosemary 'cause that's what you do with the delectable roasted garlic. Thanks to the submitter for a great recipe.

This  was crazy delicious and super easy to make. (not to mention cheap too! Chicken, potatoes, garlic, done.) It is very much a one pan meal! I made it just as the recipe stated using a bunch of cheap chicken thighs and it was perfect! Even picky eaters will like this - at least mine did. If you want a little green at your meal, I would totally recommend microwaving some frozen peas and putting pan drippings on them while plating.  It was super delicious and easy.  I will definitely be repeating this recipe often.

I followed the recipe, except added more potatoes and carrots. The 6 six leg quarters would not fit into one 8 by 11 cake pans so I divided it into two pans with the additional potatoes and carrots. I also added pineapple rings to the top the last 20 minutes in the oven. The chicken lacked flavor, but when eaten  with the pineapple rings it was yummy. Good recipe. May make again.

Awesome - made it with chunk pineapple and carrots.  Used five chicken legs, half a 20 oz. can of chunk pineapple and about twenty small carrots.  Basted it over and over....it was delicious! Didn't do anything special with the garlic but roast it along with everything else.

I would have given this 5 stars had the directions been accurate. I did only drumsticks (not the whole leg/thigh) and had to cook the chicken for much, much longer than 40 minutes (almost 90 minutes!!!) before it was cooked through and up to the proper temp. Otherwise, it was delicious. I added sweet potato, carrot, butternut squash, a quartered onion and two sprigs of fresh rosemary. Also sprinkled the chicken with a little poultry seasoning at the very beginning. I will definitely make this again, but I'll start the chicken much farther in advance of the vegetables. I ended up having to put the chicken in its own pan and pull the veggies out, otherwise, I would have had mush.

My husband loved this.  Because he will not eat dark meat, I used chicken breast which I pounded to make tender.  I added chicken brother to the pan to make up for the missing "juices".  Instead of black pepper, I used red pepper flakes to add some spice to the sweetness of the syrup.  Next time I think I will roast some garlic separately just to make it easier to spread the garlic on the chicken. The more garlic the better is my motto.  Great recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

This was fantastic!  My supplies on hand were a little different so I had to alter it somewhat.  I didn't have whole garlic so I used two TBSP of minced added after the butter melted but before veggies added.  I used red potatoes, lengthwise sliced baby carrots, fresh portabella mushrooms and 1/4 white cooking wine.  I also had just bought a season mix and this was the perfect opportunity to use it.  It is McCormick Gormet Herbes de Provence Roasted Chicken & Potatoes. I bought it in the store where they have all the gravy mix/ taco seasonings, etc.  It is in a 1.25oz package.  I only used 1/2 package since it seamed like plenty of season and it was perfect.  I cooked it as stated in the recipe and everything was cooked to perfection!

This is probably one of the best chicken dishes I have tried from this website! It is absolutely yummy! I only had drumsticks so I used 12. Also sprayed the top of the mixture with cooking spray before popping in the oven because I couldn't seem to coat everything evenly.  After I removed it from the oven, I mashed the garlic and added some of the broth from the pan to make it the consistency of a thick gravy which I then poured over the chicken. Thank you DebiMcG for a simple, delicious meal!

I can't believe how delicious this recipe is considering how easy it was to make! I added the garlic cloves unpeeled (because I didn't realize you were supposed to keep them unpeeled) and it still turned out great. I added some honey to my maple syrup and some carrots. YUM!

Excellent chicken!! I altered it a bit by putting a pat of butter and a few garlic cloves under the skin of the chicken. Then I added a table spoon of honey to the syrup which made the skin nice and crispy. Family crowd pleaser! THANKS :)

The potatoes were delicious, the chicken was good but nothing spectacular. The garlic carmelized with the potatoes.  I cooked it 40 mins and turned the chicken and cooked for another 20 mins.  All in all an easy meal.

This was incredibly delicious!  I was a little skeptical of the garlic and the amount of maple syrup but followed the recipe nonetheless and I'm glad I did.  It all blended together very well.  I added some carrots, which also worked well.  This is a keeper!

I loved this and it turned out so good. My boyfriend loved it also. He even enjoyed the left overs and that is rare cuz he hates left overs. Instead of fresh garlic I used bottled minced/chopped. You do need to keep basting during the baking process. I am writing this after making this 2 times. And I plan to make this one night for dinner this week!

This recipe is very easy to follow and really good!  I made this chicken for my boyfriend and he absolutely loved it!  The maple syrup/butter mixture was so good that he was dipping his bread in it.  The only thing I did different was that I had to raise the temperature to 420 degree because it was taking too long and I only made it for 3 servings.

Wow, this was amazing.  My husband asked if we could have it again next week.  As he was cleaning the kitchen he asked...what is this brown liquid in a cup?...forgot to add the maple syrup.  I did make a few changes, used chicken breast with skin & bone because that's what I had, I top each with fresh rosemary, and added a couple of cubed onions.  Making it again next week but remembering to add the syrup!

Amazing!  I made this for a dinner party - double batches, should have been enough to feed twice as many people - and I had zero leftovers!  Everybody went back for seconds and thirds.  I add onion and some sweet potatoes, leave out the syrup (although I plan on trying it at some point), and add just a tiny bit more butter to the garlic when I brush it on the chicken.  My boyfriend loves it!  Great recipe!

This was a fantastic and easy-to-make dish.  I used minced garlic instead of cloves, sprinkled with sea salt and crushed pepper, and used sugar-free maple syrup to reduce the sugar content.  I also used halved red potatoes and increased the time by about 10 minutes (using a thermometer to check chicken temp is key to not overcooking).  Overall a great dish and everyone enjoyed it.  Will definitely make again!

This was such a simple, delicious recipe - thanks!  I was looking for a quick way to make dinner for 8, with what I had on hand, 2 hours and 16 drumsticks.  I eyed the butter and did maybe a little less than 1/2 cup.  Only had 6 small potatoes left, so I used Japanese yams and threw two handfuls of baby carrots in - the pickiest eaters loved it.  Should have added more carrots in!  Skipped the maple syrup altogether, as I didn't think it was necessary with all the butter going on.  Used jarred minced garlic that I got in bulk from Costco.  It's past midnight and I'm going to the fridge for the potatoes!  I liked it more than the chicken!  Awesome, quick meal that will go into my weekly or biweekly rotation!

This is the first chicken and roasted potato recipe I've made and was very pleased with it.  Next time, I will try peeling and cutting the garlic into large slices, since it was messy to squeeze out the roasted garlic.

Best chicken recipe ever. This recipe is so delicious. I almost skipped the maple syrup but it turned out to be the best part! Glad i didn't. My husband and sons who are very picky LOVE this dish. I followed the exact recipe with delicious results. It is now a family favorite. Thank you for sharing!

I changed this but I must review. I have never roasted/baked whole cloves of garlic like this. Wowza!! Truly delicious! I used chicken thighs, used EVOO in place of butter, skipped the syrup and threw in some dried herbs. BF wasn't happy with the way I smelled a few hours later but I didn't care...it was super yummy! For true garlic lovers.

This was so Amazing and I must say I had my reservations on how this would taste. My Husband went GAGA over it and could not stop telling me how good it was. Simple and so Price friendly recipe which really helps and I am so ThankFul that you shared this recipe. I used Eggo Maple Syrup because that is all I had on hand. I also skipped the salted for I used salted butter....I also removed the chicken after 40 min's of cooking and place on a cookie sheet and then added it back into the oven with the pan of potatoes and garlic with juices to finish cooking....I blended the juices with garlic afterwards in a blender and poured over Chicken...So Divine!!!! Can't believe how good till you treat it....Also, I was a bit lazy and did not cut the the thigh of the leg still turned out great.

This was absolutely fabulous!!!  I chopped some red and green bell peppers (1/2 each) and a half of an onion.  I also added some fresh asparagus that I had on hand. The maple syrup (I was a little afraid of this ingredient) browned the chicken nicely but didn't give it a maple flavor.  Will definitely try again.  Thanks for adding.

I made this recipe for dinner tonight although I was somewhat skeptical of baking chicken in butter and I do not like maple syrup (I normally use Balsamic vinegar), but with all of the rave reviews thought I'd give it a try.  My boss had given the office staff maple syrup from his tree farm that had been sitting on my shelf so used this and garlic powder as I did not have cloves on hand.  I did add onions as I LOVE onions, and the smell in the house was fantastic.  Also, when finished cooking, those of us who like crispy skin put those pieces under the broiler for 5 minutes.  Well, it was such a hit, that my kids have opted this recipe over the normal one I prepare with Balsamic vinegar, and have asked that I make it again real soon.  It was fantastic and I will definitely make it again.  Thanks for sharing!

My boyfriend and I were pretty pleased with this recipe. The chicken was moist and was slightly sweet from the Maple syrup. I love garlic so I squeezed as much of it on the chicken as I could. The potatoes were tasty, wish I would have added other veggies as well. Thank you for the posting!

Very delicious! Lots of flavor even though it was easy to prepare. My son ate it all even though the only way he would usually eat a potato was in the form of a french fry :)

This was fantastic!  I love garlic and this was very garlicky.  The only problem I had was that we didn't have very many pan drippings and everything was done way before the time given on the recipe.  I also had to add a little more salt and pepper and I even basted more maple syrup on everything after spooning it onto my plate.  Very yummy!

Really yummy and easy to make! Since I didn't have maple syrup I used agave syrup in place of it and it still turned out good. I also added onion.

This was amazing. I think I'll try leaving the maple syrup out next time. It was good with it, but I bet it's good without it too. I only had like maybe 7 cloves of garlic, so I sprinkled some garlic powder on too. This is a good, simple, hearty yet healthy meal that is pretty inexpensive. It's definitely a keeper and will be going into the rotation.

I found this dish to be very bland and lacking seasoning even though I salt and peppered it vigorously. I used thighs only and the cooking time was not right had to cook it an additional 20 minutes and the skin still wasn't crispy enough. Potatoes were also mushy and not crispy as well and no one in my family liked the dish. I have no idea what the purpose of the maple syrup was but I couldn't taste it at all nor did it help with the flavor. I don't think I will be making this dish again and I am losing faith in the rating since this is the 3rd dish I have made with a high rating and fell very short. Very disappointing

`I loved this recipe.  I did add more seasoning to the chicken and potatoes before coating them in the butter.  I cooked nine pieces for one hour.

Due to a lack of ingredients but needing to use up some chicken, I stumbled upon this recipe.  I used 2 bone-in chicken breasts and halved the butter.  As I cooked the chicken, I soon realized I didn't have maple syrup so I used honey.  Despite all of these last-minute changes, the chicken was still great.  Oh, I also didn't have potatoes either...made rice instead.  Can't wait to try the recipe the way it was intended but this fit the bill tonight - very easy to make and flavorful too!

Really good, but quite greasy with all that butter. I used honey instead of syrup and it came out really tasty. I also had trouble getting everything browned so had to stick it under the broiler for a few minutes at the end. It worked well and the end result was delicious

This was very tasty but not WOW as I thought it would be. I was rushing to make it so will make it again when I have more time.  I think if I had roasted it a bit longer it would have been better.  Very easy to make though

Loved this! The maple syrup on the chicken made it perfect!  Didn't change anything other than I cut it down a bit since it was just for me. I still had enough for two nights with fresh asparagus!

It was delicious. Forgot the maple syrup the first night, but remembered the next night leftovers, heated it up in the oven  at 200F uncovered and added the maple syrup. It was perfect and the garlic came out perfectly.

FANTASTIC! Followed the recipe with a couple exceptions - used 10 T minced garlic and used regular pancake syrup. My hubby asked to add this into our regular rotation.

definitely going on my list of easy and delicious dinners. I substituted maple syrup with a tablespoon of caramelized brown sugar and I also added a pinch of minced garlic and pepper to the butter sauce.  Dad tested, and kids approved. thanks for the recipe!

Maybe I did something wrong, but I wasn’t a fan of this. Basting was a pain, and I didn’t get much maple flavor. The only positive it is that the bone-in skin-on chicken was super cheap. I ended up cutting off the skin before cooking. I will not be making this again.

Oh my gosh this was delicious!! I followed the recipe except that 1) I brushed the maple syrup on the thighs again at the end before serving, 2) I did not squeeze out all the garlic pods since mine were large. I used one on each boneless, skinless thigh. Rather than rubbing the garlic over the chicken with my fingers, I squeezed it on then emptied the pan onto a large bowl and gently turned it over with a large spoon. Unbelievably delicious!!

It was excellent.  Not having Maple Syrup, I used very thin amounts of honey over the chicken thighs. Didn't need 42 garlic cloves, I used about 12...still yummy.  I shared recipe with a friend it was so good.  Thank you

I didn't have leg quarters, but cut up a whole chicken and followed recipe from that point.  It turned out very well, full of flavor and moist.  The honey-juices were a big plus!

This meal is easy to make and very satisfying to enjoy. I put everything in a large dutch oven after I had browned the chicken on the stovetop in the dutch oven. I filled the remaining space with small red potatoes, cut up bell peppers, sliced red onion, and a few sprigs of rosemary. The sauce this makes is slightly sweet and delicious. Next time I’m going to top with a few cashews when ready to serve.

this turned out delicious and extremely tender.  I substituted Peppercorn Melange for Black Pepper and Salt to help with the sodium.  I also used fewer garlic cloves (18 instead of 26) and I did peel them.

Again, the end result was tender, delicious, and definitely a keeper!!

Mostly followed the recipe but used olive oil instead of butter. Did drizzle some melted butter on top. Only used 3 cloves of garlic. Crushed and distributed directly on chicken.

Quick and easy recipe. A keeper. Used a whole lot of garlic powder vs fresh and no maple syrup cause we don't like sweet chicken. Lovely

Just made this and it is AMAZING! Seriously, you have to try it. Sorry, I did alter it ever so slightly but I'm sure it would be just as good if followed exactly. All I did different was add Italian seasoning, carrots and bacon then at the end I plated the chicken and broiled the veggies and bacon for a couple minutes just to crisp the bacon a little. I will be making this again!

4 out of 5 of my family members liked this meal! In addition to salt and pepper, I added paprika (for some color) and two McCormick Grill Mates spices ( Roasted Garlic & Herb and then Montreal Chicken. )My son said it was too fancy and he liked the plain chicken I usually made. My  husband suggested it be a bit more spicy.

I followed the recipe exactly and found the chicken very bland. It was Ok. I think next time I will marinate the chicken first, add some carrots.

Definitely will make this easy hearty dish again! Minor change, I used a cut up chicken. Lots of gravy, so if you want; sop it up with a good crusty bread.

I followed the recipe, had to use russet potatoes so I had to bake a little longer.  It was good but the next time I make it, I will use a softer potato and add carrots.

This was delicious! I put the potatoes on the bottom with the garlic and the quarters on top so the chicken would crisp and the potatoes would absorb the butter and chicken juices. Took longer than 1 hour, but everyone liked it! Will make again! Thanks!

Followed the base of the recipe but made a couple changes. After melting butter in pan I put potatoes in and olive oil and seasoning. I used garlic and onion powder, salt n pepper, and some Montreal chicken seasoning. Stirred potatoes to get coated in olive oil, butter and seasoning. Placed the chicken on top on that and put seasoning on the chicken. Baked it for the 40 min then stirred everything up and did the other 20 min. I did not use syrup. Definitely adding to my dinner rotation and might try to add carrots like others did next time too. Great BASE recipe.

This is SO easy to make and extremely flavorful!  I didn't add the syrup and in the next batch will probably double up on the garlic.  My whole family enjoyed this meal of garlicky goodness!

I made this for dinner tonight. I followed the suggestions of some other reviewers and added some diced onion and carrots. Otherwise I followed the recipe and it was fantastic!!! My husband loved it and asked me to add it to our rotation! No higher compliment!

Prepared as written with skinless drumsticks. Neither the garlic nor the potatoes took on any of the garlic flavour without having to combine them on the fork for each bite, so a bit tedious to eat in order to enjoy the intended flavours.

This was so easy to prep and it smelled so great as it cooked!  It's my husband's new favorite. I made it according to the recipe but would have made the potato chunks a little smaller. I can see now why you don't want to crowd the pan. The maple syrup gives a nice depth to the flavor and who knew that roasted potatoes with a hint of maple syrup could be so good!  The garlic was amazing and I think I would add even more cloves but we really love roasted garlic. Will definitely make this again, and again!

I omitted the potato (since I was roasting veggies separately). Because I had the two pans (veggies in one, chicken in the other), I set the temperature to 425, cooked it for 22 minutes, basted with lemon juice, then cooked it for 11 more minutes. Perfection!

Easy and yummy. Used olive oil instead of butter, and lots of additional spices. Also put a couple of cut squash face-down on the pan to cook at the same time. An hour at 400 (and then a little broiler burst at the end) was perfect for all of it.

I must have done something wrong, followed recipe to the T, but it turned out dry, and bland.  I did take the skin off the chicken, as the directions didn't say one way or the other. Going to try again leaving the skin on while roasting, and removing it when done, should have been great but it was blah.

I have made this several times over the years, and everyone is right, the potatoes are addicting!  I only change one thing when I make this, I use season salt instead of regular salt.  Try it like that sometime, you won't regret it!!

This is great.  I have tweeked the recipe by adding pieces of carrots, sweet potatoes and rutabaga.  I peel the garlic cloves and put them with the vegetables on the platter.  The cloves do not stay whole and I find that the flavors are better that way!  I've even made the vegetables without the chicken pieces for my daughter who is vegetarian.  We served a whole chicken on the side.  Also very good as a side dish with pork tenderloin! Thank you so much for sharing this great recipe!

It is a bit bland.   I'm not sure about the maple syrup even though it was light.  I added some more salt.  If I make this again, I make take out the syrup and do more a savory flavor with lemon or dry rub.  But this was a  very easy dish to put in the oven and be done.

I used drums only too & OMG IT WAS AMAZING!!! I mixed Brown sugar in with maple  syrup (due to the fact I didn't have that much syrup) Lol & I think it added more texture to it. I also put 1/4 seasoning salt, chilli powder & I didn't use the garlic gloves, I used a cup of garlic salt for a substitution & it came out WONDERFUL!! I basted it every 10 mins 3 times with the sauces in the pan & brushed the syrup over the chicken too as well. It took more then 1 hour & 20 mins tho, it took me like 2 hours or so for the chicken to be ready. When it was all done I sprinkled parsley & alil grated parmesan on it & there you have it!!

This was just ok for me,  UT a little on the bland side. I ended up sprinkling adobo seasoning on it. the little one looooved it. I'll make again and just add the adobo seasoning in the beginning.

Easy & quick to prepare. Taste was good and intend to prepare again for family. 

Note:  I used elephant garlic, separating the cloves before baking. The chicken was done before the garlic was fully baked. I'd recommend using the smaller garlic cloves.

I didn't have fresh garlic on hand, so I used minced Garlic, and it was fabulous!!!! I also added carrots, so yummy. Toward the end, it started to look dry and we like moist, so I covered it in foil and it so perfect! SOOOOO easy and so yummy! Thanks for a winner!

I altered it a bit (I usually do), and feel the 5 stars is accurate as it was a great base recipe, resulting in a delicious meal and my changes were only due to using ingredients I already had in my pantry.  I used russets instead of goldens, boneless/skinless chicken thighs (and lessened the cooking time), and minced garlic (about 3.5-4 T) instead of garlic cloves and felt it needed more than "a pinch" of salt an pepper. Tossed all of it in the butter (placed some thin pats on the chicken pieces) and made sure the thighs were resting on top (was worried they wouldn't cook well if buried).  I was hesitant to add the syrup, but did so anyway (trying something new is good, right?  :)....well, in this case it was phenomenal!  Just a hint of sweetness (my son asked if it was brown sugar). We served it with steamed green beans, mixing in some of the drippings.  A hit with all my men (husband, father and young adult sons) and will go in my  "keep and use often" file!

This was absolutely delicious.  The only thing that I did differently was to add about 1/2 cup of low sodium chicken broth, I melted a tablespoon of butter and poured it over the potatoes before cooking.  I also ended up roasting it an additional 1 1/2 hrs.  I also added freeze dried  minced onion.   Bravo and thank you for this incredible meal.

SO GOOD! only changes I made- I put some of the maple syrup on before baking, and then put the 1/4c maple syrup on again at the 40 minute mark. I also used crushed garlic from a jar and sprinkled some garlic powder on besides.

WOW!!! Is this chicken good! Love the flavors that come together in this dish. Definitely need a large roasting pan for this one as the chicken and potatoes fill up the space. I added two sliced shallots and some baby carrots to the mix. I also sprinkled McCormick's Montreal Garlic Chicken Seasoning over top of the chicken and vegetables. Chicken skin came out nice and crispy. Will definitely be making this again! Yum yum!!

I was very impressed with this recipe.  My son and I are dieting so I altered it just a little. I used carrots cut in chunks instead of potatoes and served it with a small amount of white rice.  The rice and carrots together were fab, and the chicken was moist and fantastic flavor even using half butter, garlic and syrup.  Thank you - will be making this again!

My family makes homemade maple syrup and I've been making this for years.  Amazing the way the garlic becomes candied with the syrup.  I sometimes add 8oz fresh mushrooms quartered.

This was really good.  Made exactly as directed using chicken drumsticks/thighs combination and new potatoes instead of the golds.  Also didn't use the maple syrup for diabetic reasons but I don't think we missed it.  It was excellent and I will be making this one lots. Added chopped carrots for the veggies so it was a one dish meal for us and leftovers served up nicely for lunch the next day. Recommended!

As a young bride, I'm always looking for new, delicious, and frugal recipes to add to my collection. This one has made the cut! I made this recipe as is and it was a huge hit with my Husband! No leftovers! WOW! He has insisted that I copy this into my recipe book and put it at the very front! I was really surprised because I normally am strictly white-meat but this was delicious and flavorful. Thanks for this fantastic recipe.

This was a good dish. My kids even liked it! I did not add the maple syrup at the end, rather I just poured a bit of chicken stock over it for a bit more juicyness.

borning flavor.  We will never add that much galic.  Think up another flavor to add.  Needs lots of salt.  Maybe marinate the chicken.

This was just okay. I added lots of herbs as others suggested, but the maple syrup just added a weird flavor. Overall, it was just average roast chicken and veg.

Just served this to company after making the first time. Everyone liked it, and my small kiddos had seconds. The only change I made was to use part sweet potato and part white and red w/ skin on. Used the syrup too. It isn't hard, just takes intermittent attention. I pressed the roasted garlic cloves w/ my press, and mixed it w/ the drippings and spread on the chicken.

I used boneless skinless chicken breast, I omitted the maple syrup.  I added sage, rosemary and thyme, I used crushed garlic 1 1/2 TBSP and added it to the butter.  I added carrots.  I baked covered for 1/2 hour,uncovered 1/2 hour.  I basted after I removed the foil and basted again after 15 minutes uncovered.   Perfect!  Potatoes were soft, carrots cooked well but not mushy.  Great recipe!  Next time I may use broth and omit the butter all together.

Had to cook a lot longer than 40+20 minutes. In all, it took about 1.5 hours to cook to temp. The chicken really didn't have any flavor even with the maple syrup and garlic added at the end. The veg (I did potatoes and carrots) were very tasty though!

This was DELICIOUS!! Added some Italian seasonings to it for an extra kick of flavor, peeled the garlic (I didn't want to deal with it later), and only used about a tbsp of maple syrup - AMAZING! This will be worked in to the regular rotation!

Went over VERY well with my family!  Even my 2-year-old is on her second leg!  She never eats that much.  We did not do the maple syrup, and I again will not.  This is going to become a regular meal at our house. YUM!

First of all I changed this up....added minced garlic, paprika and a bit of red peper flakes to the butter and pepper. Coated chicken and potatoes with mixture. Cooked for 30 minutes stirred and cooked for 20 more minutes. Have made this several time and my family loves it.

Oh my goodness. I made this and my family immediately wanted it again.
I did add carrots and they are awesome. I did skin the chicken and only used minced garlic, about 2 large tsp., as that is what I had.
I was skeptical about the maple syrup but I admit I was wrong. What a great addition. This is definitely in the rotation often.

Very easy, and delicious! I pretty much followed the recipe to the letter, I melted 2 tablespoons of margarine, added 8 chicken thighs, added potatoes, carrots, chopped up onion, 2 tbsp of jarred garlic, popped it in the oven, and stirred it a couple of times, flipping over the chicken, very yummy! my 8 year old picky eater loved it, actually I made him some mashed potatoes cause that's the only way he'll eat cook potatoes unless they are french fries!  He loved the chicken!  will keep this recipe handy for our weekly rotation!  :) thank you for an awesome recipe......

LOVED IT!!!!
I used potatoes and carrots added salt and pepper and I did add just a touch of the maple syrup.  DELISH!  Even the kids loved it - which is not always the case.
Thank you Debi!

I tried this tonight! We loved it. I too added carrots and used minced garlic. I basted them like it said, although I had a little bowl with butter and garlic on the side to do it with. I also only used drumsticks as that is what I had. I mixed honey with the syrup mixture and applied it to the drums. There was just a hint of the syrup. It was amazing. I will definitely be making this again!!

This recipe is GREAT for a quick and easy dinner. I had all the ingredients in my kitchen already. I used 6 boneless, skinless chicken thighs, like other reviewers I used 2 heaping table spoons of minced garlic instead of fresh cloves. I added about 10 minutes more cooking time to the recipe. Served with steamed corn, broccoli and cauliflower drizzled with the garlic butter sauce from the pan. AMAZING!

Fantastic!  Real maple syrup (not pancake syrup) definitely the key to great flavor.  I, too, opted to peel the garlic cloves.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

One of the best dishes I've made in years. My husband fell in love and couldn't get enough of the potatoes! For some reason though my chicken took longer to cook thoroughly; after more than an hour in the oven there were still some pink parts. Love Love Love!!!

this was very good although I cooked it for a couple hours and forgot the syrup! Oops - I was out running errands so I missed the last 20 minutes. Well, the garlic was best with the potatoes - I LOVE roasted garlic by the way. The chicken was very moist, falling off the bone, the potatoes were perfect and I even added some carrots for color, little baby ones and they came out fine, too. Thanks!

This dish wasn't as great as I expected based on the other reviews.  The only change I made was adding onions while baking.  The chicken and potatoes had good flavor, but my husband and I thought the dish was really boring.  To eat, I added BBQ sauce to the chicken and sour cream to the potatoes and my husband smothered everything with Red Hot.  The dish was very easy to make, but really wasn't all that special.

This was easy and good recipe.  I did not have real maple syrup so I used imitation. It was good, however,I could taste the maple.  Next time I will try Karo light syrup to avoid maple taste.  I used 2  serving portions for all ingredients on one piece of hinder quarter.

This was so simple and yummy.  I added rosemary to the chicken for extra flavor (and am glad that I did) and added onions with the potatoes because everything is better with garlic and onions (in my humble opinion).  Definitely going to make this again.

The recipe made so much food that I had to use two pans to bake it in but, I'm not complaining! Also, we made a half and half mixcture at the end with honey and maple syrup! It was one of the best dishes I have made in a really long time!

This recipe is a keeper for sure! I didn't have Yukon Gold potatoes, so I used russets. The pan was so full, I could not easily access the drippings for basting, so I drizzled a tiny bit of melted butter over the top a couple of times during cooking. My family really liked this! (I did not use the syrup, knowing that my DH would not like the sweetness.) Thank you, Debi for this simple and delicious recipe!

This recipe calls for a lot of butter. I usually don't use so much when I cook.  I would cut the butter in half and add olive oil, maybe.  I would also cut the garlic amount in half as well.

This was great! I just made it tonight for the fam, and they loved it! I just used drumsticks and added my own seasonings and the rest is history. My family is already asking when will I make it again.

I don't rate too much but this dish was so good. Even my very picky husband liked it! I added baby carrots, which tasted great. Don't forget the maple syrup, it made a nice taste to the dish. Will be making it again:-)

This recipe is wonderful! I didn't have the potatoes, so just used sliced carrots. So good! And the aroma! Thanks for the recipe.

A keeper!  I liked it better the second time I made it, though my family loved it the first time.  Second time I cut 2 large potatoes into roughly quarter inch slices, added thinly sliced Vidalia onion and small chunks of carrot, and peeled the garlic at the beginning.  I smooshed the garlic pieces after taking it out of the oven the final time, then sort of stirred it all in the casserole dish, and let it sit for a few minutes before serving.  I'm generally not a sweet-with-meat fan but this was delicious.

So easy and soooo good!  2nd time around I put 2 heads of garlic in whole, instead of the separated cloves...this way, none of the paper peeling from the garlic got lost in the dish when stirred.  Family fave that even the kids can make

My husband liked the chicken but LOVED the potatoes. One chicken leg took a while before the juices ran clear so I cooked it longer. Only made four.

Good recipe, only thing I did different was add some winter squash, carrots, and onions, and omitted the syrup.  Added some rosemary to the veggies, and seasoned salt and lemons to the chicken.  The roasted garlic was a great topper, used my garlic press on the roasted cloves!

Used only drumsticks and added carrots. Seasoned drumsticks before adding to butter to avoid having it be too bland. It was delicious! Hubby raved about how much he loved it (and he is a picky eater). Highly recommend this recipe, easy but very flavorful!

This was very good. I only had chicken legs, so that's what we used, as well as red potatoes for the same reason. I cut the garlic way down (I like it, but my husband doesn't as much) and also added some granulated onion and rosemary. I thought it was a little too 'buttery' so next time I will cut that in half as I think the chicken 'broth' would still be plenty for basting. Oh, I also omitted the maple syrup- didn't miss it:) Next time I will also add carrots too as that sounds good from what others say...

Great recipe!  Loved the combo of flavors...I didn't have whole garlic cloves so I used minced garlic, but it was still really good without doing as recipe suggested and putting the garlic on the chicken when done cooking.  I also used red potatoes since I didn't have yukon, and it was great

Loved it!  Made it exactly as directed except I only had drumsticks and I made less.  I kept the butter the same though.  Husband loved it too.  I was surprised, like others, that something so simple would be so good.  Will make again.

Hmmm, I am a bit shocked that I haven't reviewed this yet, as I have made it 4 times in just over a month.  Made with minimal changes, and it is fantastic.  I scale down the recipe as I am normally only making for one or two.  I don't use quite as much garlic as called for, even though I love it.  I season the chicken and potatoes heavily with a seasoning blend, and add thinly sliced vidalia onions to the potatoes.  I also have tried it with carrots. I hate cooked carrots but these come out sweet, savory and yummy.  Before I brush the chicken with the maple syrup I season the syrup with the same mix.  Great recipe, easy to assemble, and sooooo yummy!  When I was reheating my leftovers at work, someone actually came over from the business next door to ask what we were making, the garlic smell is positively succulent.  Try this and make sure to season, you will love it!

I made exactly as the recipe states and we liked it but all agreed it was missing something.  I am going to make this again but maybe next time add a rub to the chicken.  It is definitely an easy and quick recipe.

Excellent dish that is very simple to throw together.  I peeled 1/2 of the garlic in the hope that it would impart more flavor.  I also added an onion to the mix.  I'm thinking about tossing the potatoes with Lipton Onion Soup mix next time.  Definitely a keeper.

Very good!  i added a few more spices, and when the bake time was done I put the chicken legs on the roasting rack so they were out of the potatoes and butter so the skin would brown better.  I was skeptical of the maple syurp but, wow was it delicious!

Great recipe for inexpensive chicken. Its simply flexible in that you can add less starch by substituting carrots, parsnips, onions and it still tastes good. Loved it.
