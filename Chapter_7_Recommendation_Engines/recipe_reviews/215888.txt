I tried this recipe as is, because we still have so much zucchini from our garden, and then tried it again with a little more pizazz! I added chopped mushrooms and onions to the zucchini when I was browning it, plus some garlic and balsamic vinegar close to the end. Then I used a chewy foccacia loaf instead of a plain white loaf, and baked it open face in the oven Good stuff!.

My boyfriend and I loved this! I added some onions while i was frying the zucchini and i diced up some tomatoes to add.  I made quesadillas instead of sandwiches because I didn't have rolls and they came out beautifully!

I prepared this as a casserole instead of a sandwich, but I'll definitely try the 'grinder' version! I Added diced onions as quite a few reviewers suggested; also added a few cloves of fresh garlic, fresh basil, oregano and curly parsley from the garden; Left out the cheese; substituted a can of 'diced tomatoes w/   roasted garlic and onions' for the sauce, then baked uncovered in a casserole dish for 15 minutes at 350 F. I sprinkled the top with freshly grated Parmesan cheese and returned to the oven for another 5 minutes, then served it over brown rice.

I altered this a bit. I saut√©ed zucchini, mushrooms, onion and garlic. The crushed red pepper is a must! I also mixed in a meat pasta sauce and made quesadillas with mozzarella. A definite repeat in this house!!! Thank you!!!

YUM! I made this tonight for dinner and I was in heaven! I love fresh vegetables, so while the zucchini was cooking, I added fresh chopped mushrooms, green pepper, onion & garlic. I used sauce & seasoning stated per recipe. I topped my Husbands with the mozzarela, but I topped mine with Reduced Fat Blue cheese crumbled. So, so, so delicious! I baked in foil as stated, then I opened the foil for 3 min. just to crisp up a little! Can't wait for the left overs!

I modified this a little - okay, a lot.  I shredded the zucchini, shredded a carrot, and took the advice of another reviewer and added finely diced onion.  Cooked in a pinch of butter and a bit of EVOO.  Salted it and added a bit of minced garlic.  Naturally, the moisture come out and it took about 15 min to cook out.  Definitely let it brown in the pan - be patient.  The onion, as it caramelized, brought my dish to a great new level.  Oh so delish! And from here I diverge even farther from this recipe.  I just put my finished mixture between a croissant - no spaghetti sauce or mozz. added - though I'm sure that would be tasty.  To sum this all up, this is great and tasty recipe, just add some onion to kick up the flavor.

This one is a keeper. I substituted fire roasted tomato sauce for the tomato and basil sauce for a little extra kick. It was delicious.

This was amazing!  I am not a huge zucchini fan so I was nervous about the dish revolving around zucchini, but I was so impressed.  I did make a few slight changes.  20 minutes in the oven was way too long for my kids to wait for lunch so I threw the sandwiches in the microwave to melt the cheese and then put them in the oven, without the foil, just to crisp them up a little bit.  They turned out great and it was a great time-saver.

These grinders were very good.  I like a hard crust so I did not wrap in foil.  I also added onions.

Yummy, easy and a great way to use up some of the plentiful zucchini crop we grew this summer!  I spooned it onto garlic bread topped with cheese and baked.  Everyone loved it.

These were fabulous!!  I added the sauce right to the fried onion/zucchini mixture, tossed in some seasoning (salt, pepper, italian, and penzey pizza).  They were so good I'm making them two nights in a row.

I have made this several times; the rating is based on following the directions as written.  Served it on Italian rolls,  was enjoyed by all.  The next few times, I added some onion, green pepper, carrots.  Turned out equally delicious!  I did try this on the grill, also; but was not as pleased with the results.... had to watch it carefully as not to burn.  Will stick to the oven method in the future.  Thanks so much for posting a great recipe to use up my zucchini before it attacks me!!

This was quite nice... Thank you.  I used cheddar because I was out of mozzarella, but it was still really good.  My husband ate twoband he is not a big fan of zucchini or my cooking experiments.  You can use any sauce.  Mine was left over with cottage cheese inside and that made it yummy too!
