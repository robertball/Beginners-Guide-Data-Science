I had never thought of using basil with green beans but this makes a very nice and healthy side dish. The only things i made different was using a little more basil and adding a sauteed onion.

I thought these were great!  And a interesting new way to use extra basil leaves.  It needs less salt (I would say cut it in half), and a little more basil.  It was such an easy and flavorful side dish.

Good. Not remarkable obviously, because it's still just cooked green beans seasoned with basil.  But good. I used butter rather than margarine and gave it a few shakes of California Garlic Salt.

This was ok and then I ate it again on day two...  It was so much better after the spices soaked in.

This was good.  Fresh veggies and fresh herbs--what could be better?  Use less butter and more basil maybe!

Flavorful green beans. I thought this had a bit of an Italian flavor due to the basil. They were tasty and we had none left. Thanks Sue for this great side dish!

Nice flavor. As another reviewer noted, they taste better the following day when the flavors have had time to meld. I only cooked my green beans 10 mins and should have gone a few minutes longer.

I have made this twice, now, and both times it has been delicious.  The beans are just the right consistency and the basil adds a wonderful flavor.

These were ok. I thought they were missing something. I cooked them for about 20 mins but that was only because we like them a bit more tender other than that I followed the recipe exactly. maybe next time I will add some onion or garlic.

Loved the flavor, even better with fresh basil from my herb garden!  Cooked for 12 minutes.  Thanks for a new recipe!

Very tasty! We used dried basil because that was all we had. When our basil plant has more growth I will try fresh, I'm sure that would be great too.

This was pretty good.  Added onions and a little more basil.  Probably a little more salt would help as well.

I loved this recipe.  I used frozen beans since I did not have fresh and they were wonderful.

Very good!  My fianc√© doesn't really like green beans but I do so I've been trying to find good ways to cook them and he liked these.  Will make them again!
