I tried this because I had Johnsonville sausage, zucchini and tomatoes that needed to be used.  Forgetting that a box of bow-tie pasta can feed a small army, I used an entire box.  I think it would have been better if I only used half.  Overall, I think the dish was quite boring.  Perhaps if I had some wine to saute the veggies in or if I added a light tomato sauce.. but I don't think I'll be trying this again, too boring.

I added roasted red peppers, sliced green peppers and mushrooms and discovered a new addition to my GO-TO dinners. It was wonderful.

I made this for a recent family dinner, and it was definitely a hit for us!  I followed the recipe exactly, including using Johnsonville Mild Italian Sausage.  It was a quick and easy recipe that resulted in a tasty meal for us!

As written, the proportion of pasta to veggies/sausage is way off. Either do just 8 oz of pasta or double the veggies. I made a light parmesan cream sauce and tossed it with the leftovers and we liked that better.

I used less pasta than it called for and it was still a bit much.  I think next time I will add more tomatoes and zucchini.  It was an awesome dish and everyone loved it, but for us I think more veggies.

Very easy to make and delicious. However. I made the mistake of using hot sausage and it completely overpowered the dish, next time I will stick with the mild. 
I would recommend this...

I enjoyed this bow tie pasta.  The combination of sausage with vegetables was just right.  Bow ties make a nice presentation for a recipe.  I will definitely prepare this again.

Really liked this recipe.  Added cream and Parmesan to the pan at the end to make a light sauce.   Also added broccoli and left out the zucchini.  Sausage was really good- Italian flavor really made it great.

I realized that besides the tastiness of the veggies and sausage it really didn't have a lot  of flavor.   I added some balsamic vinegar and that improved it tremendously.  It's a a good base pasta to add your own flavors to but alone it doesn't have much.  I will make again because it was so easy. I added mushrooms.
