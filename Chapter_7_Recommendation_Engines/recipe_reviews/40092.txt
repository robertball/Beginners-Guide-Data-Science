This is a great drink for those tired of cola drinks. I vary this all the time. Lime seems to be my favorite, but lemon is also good. For a little added sweetness I do two jiggers of the raspberry syrup and 1/2t sugar. Thanks, Kent!

Seriously refreshing. I gave it a kick with a jigger of vodka. VERY tasty.
