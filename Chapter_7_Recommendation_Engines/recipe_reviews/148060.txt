My husband and I made this, but on the suggestion of a friend also added brewed coffee to rid the elk of any gamey taste.  It worked!  There was no foffee taste either!

Oh, this recipe is so wonderful!  I used pieces of the hams rather than the loin because that was what I grabbed out of the freezer.  Also, the pieces of elk I used were about the size of a deck of cards and about 3/4 inches thick.  I also didn't have to soak the meat to rid it of a gamey flavor (we hang the meat for two weeks before cutting it up to remove the gamey flavor).  For this recipe, I doubled everything (except the elk and bacon), placed it all in a zip lock bag, and marinated it over night.  It smelled wonderful in the marinade!  I then skewered the steaks with a piece of bacon.  I opted not to wrap each piece of meat with bacon so as to lower the calorie and fat content.  I served the meat with a side of garlic mashed potatoes and it was wonderful!  I'm going to try this recipe with our antelope next.  Just a note, I was concerned about there not being any added salt in the recipe, but with the liquid smoke, worcestershire sauce and bacon, it wasn't needed.  Wonderful recipe that I will use again and again!  Thanks for sharing!

WOW! This was delicious.  I did as another suggested and defrosted my meat in coffee.  Yeah, no gamey taste.  My son had a friend over and he was like a little eating machine commenting on how his moms never tasted this good.

Excellent!  Incredibly easy recipe, and every ingredient complements each other.  I made this for my Dad with his elk and we used the tenderloin and followed the directions exactly.  The only thing we did differently is cook on medium high for less time and it all came out medium to medium well.  In hindsight, for a good medium rare I would cook on medium for about five minutes or less each side, just until the bacon is nice and crispy. We both loved it and will make this again and again!

My family LOVED this!  They are not big on marinades or to many seasonings that mast the true flavor of the meat.  This recipe enhanced the natural flavor of the elk and added just the right amount of spices.  It's January in MN- so I broiled it in the oven.  I can't wait to try this recipe over an open flame!!  Thanks- definitely a "do-over"!!

I have done these cut as medallions also and if you can't use a grill you can pan sear them for 3-4 minutes (depending on preferred how done you like them) a side and finish them right in the same pan in a 450 oven for 4 more minutes. I like to make them even a little more gourmet by topping them with bleu cheese crumbles while finishing in the oven...nice recipe enjoy!

Excellent recipe.  I'm very new to cooking/eating elk,  and this is something I can do easily.  I served it with carrot salad and rolls, and it was a great summer meal.

This recipe was really good!  It had delicious flavor and was fairly easy to prepare.  My only complaint with it is that you have to be pretty good about cutting every piece of meat the same size.  Our pieces were all similar in size but not exactly the same and the smaller pieces ended up being too tough because we had to cook it long enough for the bacon to fully cook.  I'll try it again but next time I'll try to be very careful about making everything the same size.

1st time eating elk, 1st time cooking it, and first time leaving a comment (despite using this site for years). This recipe was amazing!  Husband, young children all agree. For ease, I mixed all ingredients then applied to steaks and wrapped in bacon. This will be our go-to elk recipe from now on!

WOW!  I doubled the marinade, used Montreal Steak seasoning in place of just pepper, and put an onion on top of each piece of bacon wrapped venison--used a toothpick to keep it all together!  By far, the best grilled venison I have ever tasted!

We made this with venison backstrap and it was delicious! I took the advice of other reviewers and marinated the medallions in coffee for a few hours which I've never tried before. I skipped the liquid smoke and onion powder since I didn't have either on hand. We used an indoor grill and had a little trouble getting the bacon to cook through while still keeping the meat medium-rare, but overall, a fantastic recipe with wonderful flavor!

Ridiculously good! I am a bit squeamish about eating game like elk and venison, and I have to say I was shocked at how good this was.  I did add coffee and marinaded the meat for a few hours before grilling.  It was fantastic! I won't afraid of cooking and eating elk any more.

Delicious, crispy on outside, tender inside! I marinated a couple hours in coffee, Worcestershire, and smoked paprika. I wrapped the elk in bacon and put them on skewers with onion, green pepper and cherry tomatoes and then grilled them about 4-5 mins. each side. Served with wild rice.

This is a nice simple marinade that makes elk easy to make. I've never had luck wrapping meat in bacon without first par cooking (a few minutes in microwave), though. And I use thin-cut bacon which gets crispier in bbq. We prefer our elk more rare, so I cut the cooking time. Otherwise good, easy recipe!

I am so grateful to have found this recipe: it's great for everyone from beginners to experts. 

My co-chef and I used venison.  We let the meat marinate in cold coffee overnight (thanks for the tip!).  Even though I only quickly marinated the backstrap in the Worcestershire sauce and liquid smoke mixture for a few minutes before grilling it, it still absorbed an amazing amount of flavor.  No gamey taste whatsoever.  I suggest wrapping the bacon around the seasoned meat before skewering the whole piece so that there's no chance of the bacon falling off during grilling.

Next time I will adhere to the original recipe completely.  We incorporated a spice rub into the seasoning that contained salt because we had it on hand, and it was too much; you don't need any more salt than what is called for (the bacon + sauce combo is enough).  Timing them is tricky because some pieces will cook faster than others.  We would not recommend doing the full 5 minutes per side because the morsels ended up being a little too crispy, maybe just 5 minutes for the first side and 2-3 after they're turned, but they were still delicious.

Despite the slight errors above, and the fact that this was only the second time I made a dish with venison, you would never know it!

Here are some reactions I got from my boyfriend/co-chef (the hunter), his housemate (also a hunter), and two never-had-venison-before girlfriends: 
"WOW- tastes just like good steak." "No gamey taste!" "Not tough or chewy at all."

I used this recipe with fresh elk tenderloin and it was amazing. I’ve been eating elk meat for about 20 years and this is by far the best I’ve ever had elk meat. I used thin cut bacon and wrapped 2 pieces around each piece, weaving them around each other. After done grilling (I did 3-4 minutes per side for 4 different sides) I pulled the toothpicks out to make them easier to eat.

Good recipe when taking advice from other reviewers: marinate the meat in coffee first and Cook the bacon a little in the microwave before wrapping to ensure it gets cooked enough on the grill.

We used this recipe for Deer meat ( Venison), it was excellent.  I have used mesquite flavored liquid smoke for a different twist, both are great.  Highly recommend.
