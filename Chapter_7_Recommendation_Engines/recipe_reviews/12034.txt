This is exactly what it says it is, a very meat-tasting sauce.  Do NOT expect a traditional/strong or fresh tomato flavor from this recipe.  I should have known from the three bouillion and beef broth, but I never made spaghetti sauce before, so now I know.  I love the simplicity of this recipe, but I would leave out the bouillion and the beef broth because I prefer spaghetti sauce with a strong/fresh tomato taste.  I love that it's a thick sauce, so I think it's a good recipe, just not enough tomato flavor for me.  I left out the pepperoni when I made this, and also used fresh mushrooms instead of canned.  Thanks for sharing this recipe. :)

THE BEST!  I was making meatballs so I made this sauce without the meats.  I basically followed the recipe; only changes I made were to add additional 1 tablespoon of minced garlic (as garlic lover), add additional 2 (15 oz) cans of tomato sauce (sauce was too thick), add 1 (28 oz) can of pureed tomatoes (sauce was too thick), add additional Â½ teaspoon of crushed red pepper flakes (for extra heat), add 2 teaspoons of soy sauce (for flavor and deep color), replace honey for the sugar and add additional 1 tablespoon of honey (for little bit of sweetness).  My husband and 8 other guests raved!  Easy, simple and delicious!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This definitely gets 5 stars! This is my new meat sauce recipe from now on.  I do make some changes:  I use italian turkey sausage instead of pork, I omit pepperoni, I use a pack of fresh mushrooms, 1 whole green bell pepper, 1 whole red bell pepper, add a small can of  extra tomato sauce, and definitely more garlic.  I freeze most of a batch and have super-quick dinners when I need it.

This is a great sauce. So meaty!  I used fresh tomatoes from the garden, omitted the mushrooms, added an extra TBS. of sugar, and added 1c. grated zucchini. Oh it is GOOD! It does make a lot. I was able to freeze 3 quart bags of sauce after we ate dinner. The kids love it too! :)

Turn this into a yummy chili:
Add a 1/4 cup of chili powder, 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper, an 8 oz. bag of cheddar cheese and 3 tablespoons of hot sauce, and you've got a great chili here.

I tried this recipe and was pleasantly surprised. After mixing all of the ingredients, before simmering, the taste was good but not great. 2 hours of cooking dramatically improves this result so don't shortcut yourself.

This really is a great sauce, it was my first attempt at doing it homemade vs. the jar. It wasn't as tomato-ey as I hoped so I didn't find it to be an outstanding sauce for spaghetti, but I froze leftovers and it made an awesome lasagna (my family raved). 
I am happy with most of the ingredients, but here are some alterations for my tastes.  I will only use 1 bay leaf and 1 beef bouillon cube next time, as well as use 3 cans of tomato sauce, 1 can of puree, use red wine in place of beef broth. I doubled the herbs and garlic, because I like a lot of flavor. 
After reading another review, I may also try adding some soy sauce.

This was pretty good and certainly quite different from my 'stand by' recipe.  The only thing I changed was I used brown sugar instead of white.  This recipe is worth the effort.

We will never buy jars or cans of spaghetti sauce again.  This was truly outstanding.  The only change I made was cooking my veggies and meat separately and adding the tomatoes and spices to the veggies.  I then removed some of this sauce to simmer on its own for my vegetarian daughter and mixed the meat into the remainder.  The leftovers are in the freezer and I can't wait until we have it again.  YUMMY!

I cooked this up and threw everything in the crockpot to simmer on low all day. I used all red pepper (noone in this house likes green pepper), I tripled the garlic (at least), I used all organic canned ingredients, I omitted the carrots and celery (I'm low on ingredients until shopping day). Because I used a double-strength canned beef broth, I did not use the bouillion cubes. I did add a glug of red wine at the last and I used brown sugar instead of white, only because that's what I always do with spaghetti sauce. This turned out really well and seemed to get even better the more it simmered in the crockpot. This made for a hearty spaghetti dinner, easily pulled together out with pantry ingredients plus this made enough for two more large meals later down the road.

very good recipe, lot's of body to it. Takes some time to make though. Started out by sauteed fresh mushrooms in butter, then the garlic and onion in olive oil. placed in a large pot with all the tomato stuff and sugar to start a simmer.  browned all the meat, including peperoni, one at a time. added that to the base. then added broth, veggies, herbs and finally the wine.  took a about an hour and a half preparing it this way.  Adders and substitutions.  added a whole peperoni stick 250gm. Used 4 links of medium hot italian sausages without the casings, and about 3/4 lb of ground beef.  Used all the spices, as per the recipe. No need to add any salt or pepper. Just great the way it is.   Added a cup of red wine, just to round out all those flavours.  This one's a keeper!

I make a sauce very similar to this and I haven't tried this one, but just wanted to add a little tip when I make mine.... I buy a jar of Classico Bruschetta and add it to the sauce.  It has all the flavors I want in my meat sauce and really adds to the taste.  Same thing when I make Chilli, I throw in a jar of Salsa as it has all the flavours and textures I want as well as all the other things I put in it.   It's a great little trick to make your sauces perfect.

Very chucky!!  Very delish.  I used fresh mushrooms and I diced fresh tomatoes.  It will soften when the sauce boils.  Thanks so much.  It was a great way to sneak in some veggies to the family.  I had froze some in a ragu jar for later.  Thanks again for the meaty formula.

Ive made this many times now. I love it but with a couple of changes. Instead of a tbsp of thyme, I use a tsp of celery salt and thyme. I dont use bouillon cubes, I just add about a cup of beef broth and a cup of red wine. I also add half a tsp of fennel and half a tsp of red pepper flakes. Other than that its the same. My family loves it. Thanks for a great recipe.

This sauce made my husband eat pasta, which he is not fond of.  I first made it for him 6 (?) years ago...he asks for it, but he picks the bits of veg out of it...go figure.  My idea is that the veg should be diced, or even grated, cooked separately in some olive oil, so the flavors meld without the chucks of veg (excluding the mushrooms), unless, you like it chunky.  The flavor is there, the technique could be changed.  Next time, I will fine dice or grate the veg.

I thought I had a packet of spaghetti sauce left and when I saw I didn't I went straight to this recipe.  I only used the spices and the broth and it turned out pretty well. Meaty, not a lot of sauce, and missed the tomato part. But its good in a pinch. Will tweak some more in the future to see if this will be my stand by recipe.

Nice sauce, Did not give me that "wow" factor. Too many ingredients @20. Would have liked it thicker. Don't think I would make again.

Wonderful, but lots of work!! The pepperoni and spices give it a slightly pizza-ish flavor. It's so meaty and flavorful that picky eaters don't even notice the veggies!

I've only made this once but it has now become my signature spaghetti which is saying a lot since I pride myself on spaghetti.  For those who say it's not spicy enough need to add in the pepperoni.  Don't forget that.  That and the crushed red peppers give the sauce the necessary kick.  I needed no extra seasoning.  Great job.

I seem to have trouble making a good spaghetti sauce, but this was the best one so far.  I left out the pepperoni and mushrooms for my picky eaters...the thickness was perfect and I think the sauce would have been too thick with them.  It had the perfect amount of pepper, but next time I will double the thyme, basil and oregano for a stronger flavour.  I will also chop the carrots smaller or shred them.  Definitely worth trying a second time.

This has to be the best meat sauce I have ever made!  No one should be afraid to try this one!  I did make a few adjustments according to what I had on hand.  I used slightly more meat than what was called for and used a hot sausage.  Omitted pepperoni, red pepper flakes, mushrooms, tomato paste and bouillon. Used 2 cans Rotelle tomatos and chiles as another reviewer suggested instead of plain diced tomatos, added about 1/2- 3/4 cup red wine and fresh parsley.  Used some leftover pizza sauce and the last of some homemade meatballs. I was a little nervous about using carrot as the recipe stated but I am so glad I did.  It was a great addition! The sauce came out so thick and meaty I decided not to put it over spaghetti but toss with elbow macaroni and serve as goulash in bowls.  The end result was slightly spicy, thick and hearty!  I can't rave enough.  Thank you, Stacey!

This is almost identical to my recipe that I concocted 40 years ago.  All except I don't use celery or carrots, and instead of pork sausage I use Italian sausage.  Also I add fresh grated parmesan to the sauce while cooking.  For that little bit of sugar, I use brown sugar to cut the acidity in the sauce. For a little spark use a few good sprinkles of chili flakes to taste.

This healthy recipe calls for 6 vegetables + tomatoes.   I couldn't wait to taste it.  It was delicious even after only 30 minutes of cooking.  It does need 2 hours or more to "marraige" the ingredients.

I modified this based on my mood - for 8 servings, I used 1 lb. of ground beef, no sausage or pepperoni (didn't have any), added zucchini and did a jar of spaghetti sauce rather than the other sauces and broths.  Thought it was super tasty!

AMAZING!!! I love how many veggies are in this too. I used fresh mushrooms, fresh tomatoes from my garden, added some good red wine, doubled the garlic and also added 1lb ground turkey. 
My mom made this for a big party dinner and I took some home and ate it for lunch and dinner 3 days in a row. Still not sick of it. I'm pregnant and can't handle any meat or veggies right now, so that's saying something! =)

FANTASTIC!  Even thought it's still 90 degrees here, I was in the mood to cook some "fall" comfort food.  Hubby works at an Italian restaurant so I don't get to cook pasta at ALL :(  He closed tonight so cooked this for my son.  It was fantastic.  I added a lil more broth than called for and more garlic, of course :)  You have got to let it simmer for at least a couple of hours.  'm thinkin it's going to be even better tomorrow!

Excellent base recipe for a meaty sauce, but for my taste it needed a couple changes. I made it according to the recipe except I used hot pork sausage (which was awesome, so I'll be including it again in the future too), but next time, I'll omit the bell pepper that added a little too much sweetness, I'll add red wine and a little more bouillion. I also had to add about 1/3 cup of water this time, as the sauce was more like a chili than a sauce consistency. Other than that, the flavor was tasty and we really enjoyed it!

Very good meat sauce. I didn't use the bay leaf and thought there was something missing and my husband knew it was missing bay leaf so I think I'll use it next time. It's a thick meaty sauce and my little boy loves it!!!!

This sauce is great!  I made it for a murder mystery party that I had and my guests LOVED it.  I loved the pepperoni and meat.  I made it the day before so the flavors could combine.  Delicious!

This sauce was ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!  I personally like more garlic, which I added.  This is by far the best sauce I've ever made.  I had a party of 26 people for New Years dinner.  This recipe made plenty for all, and was RAVED about.  I can't stress how delicious this was, and you didn't need to add thing.  Even my boyfriends kids loved it!  The 3-year-old kept asking for more!  I highly recommend!

this recipe turned out really good! i followed the recipe with the exception of the tomatoes...i only used 2 small cans of tomato paste and one large can of crushed tomatoes.  i also added almost a full can of water to the sauce because it was so thick.  it turned out delicious!  there was quite a bit of sauce left over so i made a tray of lazagna later in the week.

Didn't add the sausages, celery, carrots, and mushrooms, bc I didn't have any (and carrots sounds out of place).. but this still turned out awesome. I used this in the Baked Ziti recipe on this site and what a combo! Loved it!

EXCELLENT!  THE BEST EVER!  I made it for sunday dinner and everybody LOVED it! Due to the other reviews, I tripled the tomatoe sauce and I'm glad I did...I think it'd be too thick if I hadn't.  I also used 'seasoned with garlic and oregano' tomatoe sauce instead of the plain.  I also omitted the carrots.  The addition of crushed red peppers made it taste deliciously unique.  FANTASTICO!  BRAVO!  THis will now become our HG spag sauce.  Thank you again for the delicious recipe.  ((((hugs))))

Fantastic sauce.  Only adjustments I made were: 16 oz. fresh mushrooms instead of 8 oz. canned (sauteed them with the meat and other veggies), used a whole red bell pepper, and omitted the pepperoni.  YUM.

i gave this one 2 stars, it taste like something you would expect to be thrown together in 5 minutes at a cheap restaurant. Its way to salty, and there no need for the bouillon cubes. I will make it again but i will not be adding the bouillon cubes. they are not needed with the beef broth.

This recipe is GREAT!  I made it without meat (to add when needed), increased the tomatoe sauce to thin out, and added a little olive oil.  Made lasagna and still had three jars to freeze!

Delicious! I left out the sausage and pepperoni to reduce the fat content, and it still came out wonderful!

Almost Perfect!  Please try less BAY leaves(you can always add more later).  Either I had the worlds strongest bay leaves or it was just WAY TOO MUCH. I will try 1 Bay leaf next time & maybe abit more garlic to taste. Otherwise very AWESOME. Thanks for the recipe!
(LET IT STEW FOR 1 1/2+ HOURS BEFORE TRYING TO ADJUST FOR TASTE!)

This was a good MEATY sauce. The only change I made was added another can of tomato sauce and about 3 Tbls of brown sugar at the end..oh, I also omitted the mushrooms and pepperoni...Kids loved it and husband even commented on how flavorful it was.  I think this sauce gets better with age.  Froze enough for 2 more meals...think it will be perfect for lasagna...Thx for a great recipe!!

This recipe was fantastic. This will definitely become my signature spaghetti sauce.  I did everything as is, except I cut the pepperoni into quarters so it would blend in nicely. I also hand crushed the canned tomatoes to eliminate big chuncks. (My husband and I don't like big chunks of stewed tomatoes)The recipe does make a ton; it filled my entire slow cooker to the rim. I froze 1/2 of the recipe to be used on a rainy day. Yum, yum!

I have used this recipe for over 2 years now and I am just getting around to rating.  It is excellent just as it is with ingredients.  The best I have found!  I blend it after it is all cooked to make a smooth meat sauce but that is a family preference

This sauce is really yummy.  I substitute a hearty red wine for the water and it freezes beautifully!  Add some parmesan cheese and enjoy.  Very authentic in that it isn't a drippy sauce but just enough to cling to the pasta and hold the meat.  Great sauce!

I tried this spaghetti sauce and found it quite delicious, although I altered the recipe a bit.  I did not add pepperoni(had none on hand)and I used Sherry instead of beef broth, and trippled the spices, I like flavour.YUMMY!!

You can't go wrong with this recipe. You can add, take out just about anything, excluding the spices (there just perfect)and the tomato base.  
I have one child who never eats spahgetti sauce , but she eats this one.  5 Stars to Stacy and Thanks!

This had a very good flavor.  It is quite heavy with all the meat. Also, if I make it again, I will add the pepperoni at the end, as it is already cooked, and simmering it for a long time gives it a weird sort of mushy texture.

I'm a big fan of making my spaghetti sauce from scratch, usually using no recipe, so this was a bit of a departure for me.  But it was a great departure.  This is a very tasty sauce that we enjoyed a lot.  Very thick, which I love.  My only recommendation is to buy the bulk pepperoni and cut it up yourself so you have "chunks".  I used pre-sliced pepperoni and it got lost in the sauce.

I have to give this 5 stars as I made this a week or so ago and my soon to be father-in-law said it was the best sauce he ever tasted!  This means a lot as he is EXTREMELY picky!  He even said it was better than any restaurant and is buying me ingredients to make a double batch so he can freeze it and have some whenever he wants.  Thank you!!

This was very good! Next time I may use a food processor to cut veggies very small. My kids are not wild about onions and peppers. So they would eat this better if they could not see them. The carrots were very good in the sauce.

Excellent sauce -- made it twice, but the next time I would cut the thyme and basil in half.  Don't be afraid to make the whole recipe -- it really will only serve 8-10, not 104.

I'm Italian and this is possibly the best sauce I've ever had.  I made this sauce for a big family get-together and everyone wanted to get the receipe.  This is a great sauce not only for its taste and heartiness, but because it's versatile.

This turned out GOOD!! Mom said that she really likes it and that it has real Taste!! The only thing that I did different is that I used Italian Sausage (Mild) instead of just Pork Sausage and instead of cooking it in a stock pot on the stove for 2 hours, I put it in the Slow Cooker for 6 hours.

I've used allrecipes.com for a while and I've been looking for the "notes" section it used to have. It's where I made notes to myself on what I did to the recipe so I would remember next time. Since I can't find it, I'm putting it in a "review", but please know, I don't mean to bastardize the recipe, it's just how I happened to make it and I loved it so much I don't want to forget. I had left over roast I wanted to use in a spaghetti sauce, so I used about 2 cups small cubed roast instead of the meats in this recipe. It shredded into small bits when heated which is what I was hoping. I used three 14.5 oz cans diced tomatoes and one 8 oz can tomato sauce. Garlic, celery, onion, yellow pepper. Spices were the same, including bouillon and water, with exception of no red pepper flakes and 1 Tbs agave nectar instead of white sugar. I added 1/2 cup of red wine. Simmered for 2 hours. MMMMMMMMmmmmmmm. So good.

Loved this sauce. I let it simmer for over 2 hours in my cast iron dutch oven which I find makes a richer, thicker sauce than a regular sauce pot. I didn't add the beef broth, pepperoni or mushrooms and added mild italian sausage instead of ground pork. It was so delicious when it was done, I ate a bowlful since a spoonful wasn't enough!I would classify this sauce as an Arrabbiata sauce due to the addition of the red pepper flakes. It has kick for sure. Enjoy!

This recipe has a lot of potential with the beef base and the subtle blend of herbs. The first few bites were delicious. Unfortunately,  the red pepper flakes made the sauce so hot that after a few bites my taste buds were burned and all I could experience was the heat. I was quite disappointed. If you try this recipe, make it without the red pepper, and I think it will be delicious.

YUM! Love this sauce - so glad it makes tons to freeze for later. I prefer a meaty sauce to an overly tomato one, so this was ideal. Made exactly as written except I forgot the mushrooms (bummer) so I added some zucchini instead.

This was quite a nice spaghetti sauce, I'm not going to lie. I changed a few things though. 1. sliced beef sausage instead of the other ones listed 2. few more cloves garlic because we like it 3. no tomato paste, basil leaves, thyme, or pepper flakes 4. used "spaghetti seasoning" and an extra teaspoon sugar and zucchini 5. browned beef and sausage in a frying pan before putting in pot. 6. used corningware pot instead of kettle, but will try it in a big frying pan next time as they do better on the stove top. Not sure if I'll make it again, but it was nice :)

It is really meaty!  This is not a saucy sauce.  It is thick and does not cover your noodles in a runny sauce.  My husband and one of my boys liked it.  I thought it was ok and my youngest, the picky eater in our family, would not touch it.

Great recipe, Used a good quality Pepperoni ,a mild Italian Sausage & left out the crushed chili peppers, may add them the next time was afraid would be too much like "chili" but would of added a bit of zing to it for something different. Great !! Will definetly make this one again,, have some still in my freezer !! yum !!

Hands down, the best spaghetti sauce I've ever tasted or made. I added an extra can of tomato sauce and the consistency was perfect. A keeper, for sure!

I started making this sauce a couple of years ago and just realized that I had not rated it.  This is the sauce I always make when I serve my family speghetti.  It's spicy, meaty and hearty (I do add a bit more pepper flakes).  This is on my favorites list.

Excellent sauce.  Quite easy to prepare but the favour is awesome.  I froze the balance of the sauce in ziploc bag and the freezing enhanced the flavours.

Wow - I made so many adjustments because of what i had on hand and this still turned out to be the best sauce I have ever made.    I used ground turkey and chicken breakfast sausage (trader joes) and I steamed and pureed zucchini, carrots, spinach and red pepper then added it into the sauce (I have picky tots) and everyone loved it!  No one guessed there were a ton of veggies in it.

The beef flavor was overwhelming.  My friends and roommates though it was good, but next time I'll omit the beef bouillon and broth and use Italian sauasge instead of regular american pork sausage. Then we're all sure it will be amazing!

This was really good.  I made it to a tee exept I left out the bay leaf because we don't like.  Will add some more seasonings next time to make up for.  But overall it was really good.  I think next time I will use Italian Sausage.  Thanks for the post.  Will make again.

The best sauce I've ever made and one of the best I've tasted.  My husband, who hates most homemade spaghetti sauces, moaned the entire he at his dinner.  I used brown sugar, not regular sugar and I did not add pepperoni because I don't like it.  It you don't like a slightly spicy aftertaste, don't use all the red pepper flakes.  It is mild, but my 11 yr. old didn't like the slight hotness.  It's so thick you can almost eat it as a meal by itself.  First time I've been excited to eat spaghetti in a long time.

I burned the bottom a little so the whole thing had a smokey flavor but the smell was to die for. Everyone that ate some had seconds and thought it was so tasty! It truly is very meaty! and very hearty.

I didn't have a couple of the ingredients such as the bell peppers and pepperoni and it was still DELICIOUS.  I put the sauce in the crock pot and let it sit on low and it seemed so easy and simple.  For now on, this will be the sauce recipe for the my king.  :}

Great recipe.  I doubled this recipe and made with fresh tomatoes and homemade sauce.  I also substituted used ground turkey.  I froze this sauce and it has been great when thawed and heated!

My husband (a track coach and teacher) LOVES spaghetti... we made this sauce as a celebration of the end of the 2006 track season... it is WONDERFUL!  We had enough left over to freeze for another meal (BONUS!) .  I added some of the leftovers to a roast I was cooking and YUM- added great flavor and nice moisture.  This one is going in the family recipe box!

You really can't go wrong with the amount of vegetables and protein in this sauce (I also added 1 cup cubed zucchini).  I used lean ground turkey, hot turkey italian sausage, and turkey pepporoni slices.  I'm not sure the pepporoni adds anything to the flavor, so I may try omitting them next time and use sweet italian sausage instead of the hot.  It certainly wasn't too spicy to eat, but I enjoy a nice tomatoe-y sauce, and the spice kinda distracted from that, I'm afraid.  I will continue to make because it's such an easy way to get in all those veggies!

I have made spaghetti sauce so many different times using so many different twists and varieties, trying to create that perfect sauce, and not once did I ever thing to use beef bullion!  This is definitely the 'missing link' to my sauce. I halved the recipe because I needed enough for two people and then about a day or two's leftovers.  I did subsititue red wine for beef broth and stewed my own diced tomatoes because I didn't have any cans on hand.  I also used garlic powder instead of fresh because I forgot to buy some.  I cut the oregano, basil, and thyme in half and used 3 T. of garlic powder (love garlic!).  I also added a few t. of sea salt and added some fresh sliced mushrooms, not jarred.  This is my new sauce!

This was my first time making my own spaghetti sauce from scrach. I am convinced - I don't think I'll ever buy the ready made stuff from the grocery store again. I had to alter the recipe a bit according to what I had at home: only ground turkey for meat, and minus basil and thyme and it still came out great! The red and green peppers along with the mushrooms were a nice touch and the seasoning seemed just perfect, too. We were in a bit of a hurry to eat so I only simmered it for about half an hour but it seemed to be plenty. Eating it feels different too knowing it is your creation from scratch, not just a jar/can warmed up. Overall, great - will make again and again!

This recipe is delicious!  It says it is for 32 servings; however, my family eats left overs and generous servings.  So, the amt was just right.  I did not use any of the meat in the recipe.  Instead I added The Best Meatballs submitted to allrecipes.com by Geanine.  I added the meatballs during the last 30 minutes of cooking.  I served the spaghetti w/ garlic bread and salad.  I will be making this again.  Next time, I think I will try ground Italian sausage as the meat.

Excellent spaghetti sauce!  Thanks for sharing.  I was suprised to see thyme as an ingredient in spaghetti sauce, although the blend of spices was excellent.  This is defintely replacing my regular spaghetti recipe.  I also didn't have red pepper which I left out, and I also left out the carrot.  This recipe will be used in our house for years to come.  Thanks for sharing.  We loved it.

Used two pepperonies and added 1 soup can of water because it seemed sooo thick.  Very good, all 5 of us loved it.  The sauce didn't seem to cling to the pasta very well but no one seem to care!!!
Thanks

And I thought my homemade spaghetti sauce was very good. I saw the rave reviews and tried it because I was curious.  I'm glad I did.  Y-U-M!!!  Thanks for sharing, Stacey!

My husband loved this... I thought it needed a bit more sauce.  The carrots were great in it, and the flavor was very good.  I would just add a little more tomato sauce next time.  Good Recipe!

This was a VERY good recipe.  Those that I cooked it for are diehard spaghetti fans, and they loved it, as did I.  I sacrificed the bell peppers and only chose one carrot, but the rest was delicious.

This took longer to make than I thought it would....but it was really good! I made the entire recipe for just two people - so I have a lot left over to freeze. (I just bought a vacuum sealer, so I can't wait to get to use it!) My husband was a little doubtful of the carrots and celery in it - but they took on the taste of the spaghetti and he loved it!

Very good!! My husband doesn't care for most spaghetti dishes but really enjoyed this. Even took leftovers for lunch the next day. I cut the recipe in half and used lean ground turkey breast instead of the beef and pork. Turned out great!

I married into an Italian family, so I have had the pleasure of trying all kinds of sauces.  This one was absolutely wonderful.  My husband and I made it together and loved it.  Yes, there are many ingredients to purchase, but it is well worth it.  The recipe, as is, makes a ton....in fact, I am going to cut it in half next time.  We loved the flavor, especially the fact that it is spicy and it is even better the next day.  I would definately recommend it.

Excellent, very hearty sauce.  I made this the evening before a family "game night".  Simmered for about 90 minutes on the first night and then about 30 minutes the following evening in preparation for serving.  Flavors really blended nicely.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is truly a delicious spaghetti recipe! I don't think you could mess this one up if you tried. After I had browned the meat and sauteed the veggies, I realized I didn't have any beef broth or tomatoes. The only thing in my pantry with tomatoes was Ragu PIZZA sauce. I had no choice but to substitute, and the taste was WONDERFUL! No one would have ever guessed. I did add 1 extra beef bouillon cube and a little water. I chopped the vegs. up and then put them in the processor. My kids never knew what was in the sauce!

Great recipe and very close to my own passed down from my Grandmother. Instead of the Celery and Carrots, I pour in some V-8 juice ... saves chopping time. I also don't use as much of the beef elements, i.e. broth or bullion, but otherwise ... Yum! I personally don't like overly sweet tomato gravy. I actually add a little chili powder to knock the edge off of the "sweet".

Made it my way! Since I don't like vegetables, I placed all the vegetables in the Vitamix and chopped them very small (not juice).  I didn't include the mushrooms and reduced the celery by half.  Also, replaced the pepperoni by 1lb of ground veal.
Been doing it like this for years, very popular at home with everyone.  
Usually freeze a couple of 4 people servings for later use.

Pretty amazing recipe. I've been using this as a basis for my pasta sauce for a while now. I usually reduce the beef buillon cubes and add some sweet and sour BBQ sauce. Skip the sugar too. 5 stars, all the time.

Meaty Spaghetti Sauce Haiku: "Yum! Wow! This was great! Ingredient list scared me, but so worth the time!" The only things that I had to omit were the pepperoni and celery; otherwise, did everything as written and holy cow, this sauce blew our minds! Served over spaghetti squash w/ a sprinkle of parmesan, and I think we've found our new favorite sauce to make in triple batches for freezing!

Amazing!  Even my 16 year old son said it was the best he's ever had!  I did omit the pepperoni and I used all hamburger instead of half hamburger/half sausage.  I would make it the same exact way next time too.

I love a meaty spaghetti sauce. This one is very good but I felt something was missing. I just can't put my finger on what it is. I followed the recipe except for leaving out the red & green peppers because we just don't like them. Thanks for the recipe.

Amazing! I did mine in a crock pot and it turned out wonderful. If you have picky veggie eaters you can fry up the vegetables and then puree them to put them in the sauce, and it still tastes great. Since discovering this recipe we have NEVER gone back. We refuse to buy sauce now. Thank you for this!

This was the best pasta sauce I ever had.  Thank you!  I omitted the sausage (only because I didn't want to run to the store).   I also put all the veggies, save a few fresh mushrooms, in the food processor, because I thought my daughter wouldn't eat it if she saw the veggies (I'm guessing that was a good move).  We all loved it.  Definitely a keeper.

I thought this recipe was by the best spaghetti sauce that I have tried. I am not the most experienced cook, but this recipe is by far better than opening a bottle of store bought "sauce". I did use a zucchini instead of the mushrooms, added about 8-10 cloves of garlic, (my husband and I love garlic, plus he is half Phillipino so the more,the better). I also added 1 1/2 Tbsp dried celery leaves and 2 Tbsp dried parsley. It was a great success with my husband, who was very skeptical at first. I do think that I will cut back to 1/4 tsp of red pepper flakes, though. But it was a great success. I will never use canned ever again. Also I use about 1/2 to 1 cup red wine.

Stacey, thanks for the recipe. Followed the directions pretty much, I just went 1.5 times dried spices.  I made a double batch, ate it the next day and froze the rest.  My son eats it like chili:).  Will probably use Hot Italian Sausage next time.

Very delicious, and was approved by the hubs. :) Only tweaks I might make to it would be less thyme. The amount called for was overpowering to both my husband and me, but everyone is different. Just our opinion! Otherwise, I'd def recommend.

I purposely made this because I don't like tomato sauce. It is awesome - I didn't even make the spaghetti to go with it. My daughter couldn't stop eating it. I am definitely freezing the leftovers for easy meals the rest of the month.

This is very difficult for me to say because I always thought I made the best spaghetti sauce but this is amazing.  This will be the only spaghetti sauce I will ever make again.  I have to admit I used fresh mushrooms because I donât like caned and I didnât drain because there was nothing to drain.  Other than that I stuck to the recipe which is very difficult for me because I always think I can do betterâ¦. Well, most times I can!   Oh, one more thing to mention.  I tasted the sauce at one point and thought I had ruined it with the sugar; however, when finished it was only DELISHOUS!

Made this last week with a few adjustments for items we did not have on hand:  left out ground sausage and pepperoni and used a total of 2.5 lbs 90/10 ground beef.  Left out the tomato sauce and tomato paste, and used one 28-ounce can crushed tomatos.  Left out the canned mushrooms and red peppers because we also didn't have those.  Used 1-tablespoon honey instead of sugar just because.  Not mentioned in the recipe, but I salt and peppered the meat and raw veggies after I added them to the pot.  Did not use bouillon cubes because I didn't have them, but I used 4t. beef Better than Bouillon and 1-cup of water.  I used everything else the recipe called for.  Cooked 1 hr 45 minutes with lid on, then removed the lid and cooked another 30-45 minutes to intensify the flavor.  Adjusted with salt and fresh ground black pepper in the end, and possibly the best meat sauce I have ever made and eaten.  I usually make Mama DiSpirito meatballs with tomato sauce, but this was every bit as good as the giant Italian meatballs.  Fabulous, and I highly recommend!

I made this sauce and it is excellent!  I doubled the batch and froze the leftovers ( I have already used some of the frozen and it was also excellent - it freezes great!).  As a side note - I followed the recipe exactly with the exception that I used all dehydrated veggies when I made this and it came out perfectly.  I had to add extra water and simmere it longer (obviously) but it is absolutely delicious.  My family and I prefer it over the sauce the my MIL makes and that says A LOT since she is possibly the worlds best cook!  Thank you so much for posting this.  This is my new 'sketti sauce recipe!

Great flavor. I didn't add pepperoni or the  beef bouillon cube. I think next time I will leave out the red pepper flakes and use sweet sausage instead of the hot.

Best spag sauce! Everyone loves it. I add a bit more sugar to it now as I like it sweet but it's good even as is. I also cook the meat first and drain the fat as I feel too guitly draining all the good vitamins from the veggies.  I made it multiple times now.

This was a great spaghetti sauce.  My family loves all the meat although I omitted the pepperoni.  Next time I will try the suggestion by another member to turn it into Chili.

It is definitely a different sauce. I thought the green pepper was a bit storng, it was hard to taste some of the other flavors, I'm gonna cut back on that if I make this a second time. I had it with spaghetti and also made a lasagna with it, it was good on both. It is spicy though (which I liked, but some thought it too spicy).

After reading many reviews I was concerned about al the meat but knew that was what I was looking for was a sauce with a ton of meat! So I made these adjustmentsâ¦ I used 60 oz of tomato sauce to make it more like a âsauceâ I was not going to until I saw it all together. I only used one can of tomato paste and did not use the beef broth. Oh and fresh mushroom! It was really good!

Excellent recipe! Very thick and spicey, almost a cross between spaghetti sauce and chili. I actually had some of the leftover sauce the next day by itself. I did leave out the pepperoni because so many people said it made the sauce greasy, but I think I'll add it next time for some extra kick. This recipe takes a good bit of work, but if you have the time, it's well worth it! Next time I make it, I think I'll use it in a lasagna. It would be perfect for that! :)

Yummy!  Even my finickly 5yo who doesn't usually like spaghetti liked this one!  I halved the recipe and it was just right for our family of 6 (four of those ranging in age from 2yo to 10yo), though my oldest boy was scraping the bowl.  Because of that, I wouldn't say that this serves 32 like the recipe states -- more like 10-12 depending on the appetites.  The only changes I made were to leave out the mushrooms, red bell pepper and beef bullion/broth (replaced bullion with water).  The taste didn't suffer at all!

I'VE FOUND MY NEW SPAGHETTI SAUCE!!  What a great sauce.  I omitted pepperoni, and the beef cubes only because I didn't have any.  I added more of some vegetables to prevent them from going bad.  I doubled the recipe, and froze some, and tasted wonderful.  Thank you for sharing the meatiest, thickest, and best tasting spaghetti sauce recipe I've ever made!

An excellent, thick spaghetti sauce, I made it just as the recipe dictated, and found it *really* spicy hot!  So on the next try, I toned it down (omitted the cayenne, downsized the pepper and omitted the pepperoni) and it still made an excellent, flavorful sauce.

This sauce is very tasty and thick.  I did not add pepperoni or mushrooms because I hate both of them.  I also used brown sugar, not white.  Delicous and it makes plenty.  I freeze it in batches.

Great recipe! I've made it several times, and everyone asks me for the recipe when I do. I also think the leftover sauce makes great lasagna!

I've been making this recipe for 2 years now and am just now getting around to writing a review.  This sauce is my favorite and the only spaghetti sauce I make now.  I love all the veggies and spices in it.  I also love that it makes enough to freeze half for another meal at a later time.  Thanks for the great recipe!  Oh, and I agree with the other poster that this may not be authentic Italian, but it's still awesome!

I'll give it a four only because I used lot of creative license while cooking. I added 1 cup of red wine, an extra can of crushed tomatoes and more garlic.  Overall turned out great and was even better the next day

This is a first class recipe in my opinion...I made it as close to the recipe is, with what I had on hand, and know!! that it would have tasted even better had I had the sausage in it (don't care to have the pepperoni:) ... as well as missing the bell peppers. Thanx for the recipe! OH! and one more thing, I used the already shredded carrots (bag)~great way to get that extra nutrition in for my twins!
AND OOPS, ONE MORE THING...Have to Add this after glancing at your reviews. I DO NOT SEE THE WORD, "ITALIAN" ANYWHERE IN YOUR TITLE! :) Spaghetti is no longer just an "italian" served dish, and we should adapt it to suit 'our' tastes. Well done :)!!

i've tried many, many spaghetti sauce recipes, and done some of my own. this is THE best, and i don't use any other. i cut the tyme down to 1 tsp (my own preference)and use diced tomatoes with green chilis for a little extra kick, but those are the only changes. outstanding

This recipe was a hit with the family! I used ground turkey and turkey sausage instead of ground beef and sausage; Rotel tomatoes instead of diced; and jar garlic/basil tomato sauce instead of can tomato sauce. The Rotel tomatoes add a nice "bite" to the recipe.

Very thick and hearty sauce.  I made the recipe exactly as stated right down to the exact spice measurement.  I did think the seasoning is a little sweet for me although my Husband loved.  The main ingredients make a good combo but I think I will adjust the seasoning to taste next time around.  A good recipe to sneak vegatables into your meal.

I should have taken the name "Meaty" more seriously.  This ended up tasting like ground beef with tomato paste.  I like my sauce very savory and zesty (I usually use bacon), and the hot Italian sausage I used  was undetectable amid all the ground beef.  My bad for not taking the name seriously!

Yummy!  I needed a spaghetti sauce becuase I simply HATE that stuff in a jar/can.  Nasty!  Anyway... I didn't have any onions on hand, so I used onion powder.  I only used hamburger meat (a little over 1 lb) because we don't eat a lot of meat.  Left out the carrots and celery and next time around I'll leave out the red pepper flakes also.  It was good, and made a huge pot!  Definately what I'll use from now on!

This sauce is a nice change of pace from even your everyday meat sauce.  It is definitely thick and hearty.  I followed the recipe with the exception of adding only 2 beef buillion cubes as suggested by some others.  The pepperoni doesn't stand out so for those considering eliminating it for that reason, I would leave it in.  I wouldn't use this sauce everytime, but it is certainly a great sauce when you are looking for a hearty meal or need a sauce for lasagna.

Delish! I made this last weekend for my grandchildren and was an awesome hit!  I didn't use the pepperoni or the carrots but was great.  Made a double batch to freeze for later use.  Will never use jar sauce again. A Keeper!

This spaghetti sauce was terrific!  I made it for a dinner party and everyone enjoyed it.  I only made a couple of changes (per suggestions on this website.)  I used fresh mushrooms and added a little bit of red wine vinegar.  I didn't think it was too spicy and I thought the consistency was perfect.  Try this recipe, you won't be disappointed!

To me this sauce was more of a four star, but I gave it a 5 becasue I missing the sausage and I did not want to damage the ratings for something that I was missing.  My husband really liked the sauce, it was good, but I just thought something (besides the sausage) was missing.  Next time I will use sausage and see if this helps.  Definitely worth making again. Thank you for sahring this recipe.  :0)

This recipe takes a long time, but it is well worth it. My father, who hates tomato sauces and therefore hates spaghetti, loved this sauce. Any change I could make to this recipe would be a regret. This is perfect as it is.

This is the first red sauce recipe I've made that I've truly been impressed with.  I love the spiceiness and the chunkiness too.  The only changes I made was only using 1 can of paste as that's all I had and using splenda brown sugar to sweeten it.  Really, really good!  Try it!

Very Good!!!  I forgot the pepperoni and didn't have any bay leaves but it still turned out very good.  I added a little more sugar and another can of mushrooms.  The only other thing that I would change would be to reduce the amount of pepper.....a little to spicy for my taste.  Excellent!!!!!  I finally found a new spaghetti sauce!

This is one amazing pasta sauce!  I added some diced zucchini, as someone else suggested, and left out the mushrooms and hot pepper.  I don't like chunky sauce, so I was a little worried about this recipe, but it turned out fantastic!  I will definitely be making this again and again instead of buying jars.

Awesome - I used 16 ounces of whole mushrooms, halved, in the sauce instead of canned - but other than that made it as written.  It was wonderful!!!

This was a lovely sauce. I mixed and matched the veggies a little bit but overall followed the recipe with great results.  Freeze the leftovers for a busy evening when you don't want to cook.  Thank you!

I MADE THIS RECIPE TODAY ALTHOUGH I OMITTED THE PEPPERONI (PERSONAL PREFERENCE). I ALSO DOUBLED THE BEEF SINCE I DID NOT HAVE PORK ON HAND. THE FLAVOR WAS A BIT BLAND (I LIKE IT W/ SPICES). DID NOT PUT IN BEEF BROTH SINCE IT WAS THIN ENOUGH AS IS. IT'S A GOOD BASE BUT I WILL TRY OTHERS.

I was excited about trying this recipe after reading rave reviews but I was somewhat disappointed.  The recipe had good but not great flavor in my opinion.  Could just be that I have different pasta sauce tastes than the masses, who knows.  Will probably keep searching but thaks for the recipe nonetheless.

This sauce is out of this world. I followed the recipe to a tee and must admit I got a little nervous adding some of those ingredients but I trusted the recipe. It takes a lot of preparation but definitely worth it. This one is definitely a keeper. Thank you!

It has a very nice flavor, even reheated, but a bit greasy for me.

My kids really enjoyed this spaghetti sauce, and my husband and I have just two comments.  Omit the carrots.  Against my better judgement, I went along with the recipe, but we didn't feel as if the carrots added anything to the sauce.  The pepperoni made the sauce too greasy for our tastes.  In short, the next time I make this I will omit the carrots and the pepperoni.

I liked the combination of meats, but the strong flavor of the thyme was too much for me and seemed out-of-place in a spaghetti sauce.  Next time I will reduce the amount, or leave it out altogether.  Pepperoni in spaghetti sauce, who would have thunk it?

Love this sauce.  This was the first sauce I made from scratch (pretty new at cooking) and it turned out perfect.  Now my wife begs me to make it for everyone who comes over.

This is the best spaghetti sauce I've ever made or eaten.  The kids love the pepperoni in it but I leave out the mushrooms because they hate them (even though I love them!)  I use this sauce for the Bake Ziti 1 recipe and it's a huge hit everywhere I've taken it!  Thanks Stacey!

this was very good. I added more tomato sauce and beef stock and next time will add even more. I didn't have any ground pork so I just doubled the ground beef and we really liked it. I will defintely use this recipe again.

Ummm....WOW! This recipe was VERY GOOD. However, if you want it to be simply divine - then use Rotel diced tomatoes and green chiles instead of regular diced tomatoes add an extra can of chicken broth (I omitted the bouillon cubes)slice some sausage up to add to the meat. Chop the onion and bell pepper course so that when you bite into the sauce you can taste it. (I also omitted the cayenne, it was spicy enough and I omitted the carrots - carrots was just to wierd to include in spaghetti.)
Will definitely make again.
Have fun cooking.

Great recipe!!! My husband doesn't eat beef anymore (mad cow you know) so I used ground turkey, mild Italian sausage and found turkey pepperoni. I also used a 28 oz can of Italian tomatoes.  He LOVED it. It freezes really well too. I will be making this alot.

Really liked the idea of the pepperoni sausage. Just found this sauce too spicy. Did not even use the red pepper but did use 1 teaspoon of fresh black pepper. Added extra tomato sauce and the pepper and other spices still overpowered the sauce. Will try again - adding spice a bit at a time.

This recipe turned out great. Instead of the pepperoni, I doubled the ground beef and added 12 oz of sausage. I ended up having to use pizza sauce because it was too thick.  I also let it simmer all day instead of just two hours and it was fantastic!

Instead of pepperoni sausage we used a bit of chorizo for extra spice.  It was amazing.  But you definitely have to like meat.

This is a wonderful spaghetti sauce.  The only thing I changed was I did not use the bell peppers.  My husband hates bell peppers and can pick the taste up no matter what.  I'm glad the recipe made so much, so I can freeze the extras for later.  GREAT RECIPE.
