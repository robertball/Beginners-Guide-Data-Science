I did not have a red onion, I used a sweet onion instead. I also threw in some chopped red pepper, fresh minced garlic and a cup of chopped fresh mushrooms. I did choose to drain and rinse my canned corn. I served this soup with homemade Red Lobster-type biscuits, which the boys used to sop up the remaining broth in their bowls. Very filling and satisfying soup--the extra added vegetables made it even more so. Even my kids enjoyed it, we all thought this is most definitely a make again meal.

Excellent!  It was declared "one of the best soups ever" by my partner.  I modified a bit and used vege broth instead of chicken broth (we don't eat meat) and added some fresh basil at the end! A total keeper!  The second time I made this I omitted the tortellini and added shrimp (we do eat seafood)-- also a total hit!  Thanks, Katie!!

I have never enjoyed a new recipe this much before, I was so surprised I actually made involuntary yummy noises! I did make a couple substitutions: instead of sugar and hot sauce I added about 1/3 cup ketchup and chili pepper flakes, I also didn't have wine in the house so skipped that. I did add the corn but will probably go with garbanzo beans next time to cut down the sweetness. I forgot to add the parmesan, probably because it tasted so good I didn't think it needed anything else. I'm already excited for leftovers for lunch tomorrow!

I made this recipe as listed with no changes.  My husband liked it enough to keep a bowl for leftovers the next day.  I didn't save the rest.  I am not a tomato soup lover and this was definitely a tomato soup.

This soup is really yummy. I think that adding the Parmesan to the soup while it's cooking is the kicker for this recipe. It gives it really good flavor. (Of course I always add a little on top in the bowl too!). I used low sodium broth because of my diet and it tasted fine. Even my little guy who doesn't eat soup enjoyed a bowl and for me, that is always a plus!

I made this soup for a Lenten soup supper and it was a hit!  Unfortunately, I never got a chance to try it, but everyone else loved it! It was the first soup to go! :)

YUMM!!!!  This really is super easy and had a fantastic flavor!  I didn't have hot pepper sauce, but didn't miss it either.  I used tomatoes with basil and garlic since that is what I had on hand and that was wonderful.  Highly recommend this.  Hubby (nor I for that matter) are big on tomato-based soups, but this one is the exception!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was certainly easy enough but we just did not like it. It was a little on the sweet side with the sugar and the corn. I don't like sweetness in my soup. I think if there were more veggies it might have made it better. My family ate it but no one really enjoyed it.

This needed a LOT of tweaking to keep it from being bland. I followed the instructions pretty closely, except I added two sliced stalks of celery and doubled the amount of garlic. Substituted garbanzo beans for the white corn. When I tasted it, something seemed incomplete. At this point I had to add about a teaspoon of salt (and I had not used the low sodium broth), some freshly cracked black pepper and a sprinkling of oregano. It STILL was lacking flavor, so my husband and I experimented with different cheeses sprinkled on top (this was AFTER adding the Parmesan). We liked goat cheese on this, but I think I've tried better recipes from this site, so I won't be making this one again.

This soup is excellent!  I used tomatoes with Italian seasoning already in them.  The tortellini didn't get as fat as they do when cooked in water - but they were perfect.  I made it for just two of us.  We ate the rest of left overs the next day - it was definitely better fresh.

This recipe was so easy to put together. While I was waiting for my supper to cook I was able to throw this together. It took about 20-30 minutes. It isn't just easy but delicious as well.  I had regular canned tomatoes and decided I wanted to follow the recipe exactly so I put them in my Bullet mixer for just a second or two and they were crushed just right. I would definitely recommend using crushed tomatoes. The texture is nicer for this soup. I was tempted to throw in more tortellini so it would be nice and hearty but so glad I followed the recipe to a tea. 8 ounces is just right. More than that and it would not have any liquid left. I am loving this soup. Thanks for this wonderful recipe.

Substituted Campbell's beef broth for the chicken. Switched celery for zucchini and added a sweet yellow pepper. Held off on the hot sauce in deference to the savory end of the spectrum. Loved by all. Kids and adults alike. Ten thumbs up

This was great!  I got 6 one-cup servings out of it.  I made it exactly like stated -- except I used 70 tortellini (We just have a huge bag from costco, so I counted out 3 servings according to that bag).

Excellent and SO easy! Made this when I was tired and didn't want to be in the kitchen -- it came together quickly and was a huge hit! I didn't have zucchini but it was still great -- I followed others' suggestion and added a bit of fresh basil at the end.

I have never been a big fan of soups, but this soup is another deal. I really liked all the flavors and the variety of vegetables. The crunch of the corn is fantastic, the occasional bow-tie (which I substituted for the tortellini pasta because that was what I had on hand), and the softness of the rest of the vegetables made this soup wonderful. This is a really simple recipes to follow and really worth the try.

This is just yummy as can be.  My two teenagers loved it and even turned their friends on to it.  I love it after a day of skiing or a day at the beach.  It is so easy yet it taste like I spent all day.   The red wine and white corn made it special!!

One of the best soups I've ever made and I love to make different kinds of soup. I would highly recommend. I didn't change anything except to use chicken and proscutti tortellini instead of cheese. My husband and I both had two bowls of it and were stuffed. Very filling.

This was so good!  It's a very thick soup with lots of flavor.  I used diced tomatoes with garlic because that's what was in the cupboard.  I'm freezing the leftovers for weekday lunches.

I love to make soups and stews and am very excited to have added this one to my collection.  Very thick and delicious, at least as good the second day too. My whole family loved it, even my very picky son- he took one bite and said " I love this!"

I made this as a first course at Christmas prior to homemade lasagna.  I want to tell you that my family is composed of those who would eat anything to the world's pickiest eaters.  They DEVOURED the soup and came out in the kitchen looking for third helpings before the lasagna came out and my grown children are getting requests for the recipe.   Personally, I would have added additional liquid because I like "soupy" soup but I was told when I make it again, make it the SAME!   There were 12 at that meal.

We loved this soup!  I made a large batch and froze half.  It was even better the second time around.  A definite hit in our house.

My husband is so picky and he enjoyed this recipe. Tastes good for left overs too. I never have zucchini in the house so I always add something different like green pepper or celery etc. Turns out perfect

This soup was a hit! Easy to prepare and very flavorful. I didn’t have zucchini so subbed celery to add veggies. I used sweet onion because I didn’t have red. Next time my husband requested adding mushrooms as some other reviews suggested. Thanks for a great recipe. Looking forward to leftovers to take to work for lunch tomorrow.

This soup has been a favorite of 4/5 family members (the 5th doesn't like pasta!) for years. I use frozen chopped onion, which helps keep it easy and tear-free. I make it again and again because it's always enjoyed. And I double the recipe so we have leftovers. Definitely a keeper!

Love this soup!  The only thing I added, but didn't change the rest, was canellini beans.  Great flavor with no salt added.  I'm not a salt person and definitely does not need any!  I will definitely make this again!  Maybe add chicken to it next time.

Delish!  Will have to double this recipe because it went fast between just two of us.  I have other versions of this type of soup that include meat and other veggies, but if you need a quick and fast heart warming soup made with regular cupboard items, this is full of flavor without the meat and extra additions.  I thought the corn ingredient seemed a bit strange and would make it too sweet with the added sugar, but not so.  It is actually adds a nice texture to the soup and my soup was still tomato tart.  Use crushed tomatoes only (not sauce, or diced, or stewed, etc.).  Alternatively, crush the diced, stewed, if that's all you have on hand.  The Parmesan is a must!  I can't speak for the powdery kind, but real Parmesan was wonderful.  We used frozen tortellini and tossed in for about 8 minutes, just long enough for them to thaw in the soup but not get mushy.  Agree with others that more than 8 oz of tortellni will crowd this soup.

I literally had ONLY these ingredients in my house when I made this soup! I had just moved and hadn't done a big food shopping yet. This was very easy and really yummy.  I had no zucchini, so I just added some more tortellini. I will make this again definatly!

This soup was fantastic! I added more Italian seasoning and salt than was called for, substituted apple juice for the wine, and used fresh tomatoes.  I recommend this recipe to anyone looking for a hearty fall soup!
