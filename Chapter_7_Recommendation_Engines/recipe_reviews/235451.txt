Now I can't wait till a snowy day.  Rec. looks like t takes time to prepare.  I would use either potatoes w/saut√©ed onion & celery & chopped spinach or stuffing w/tiny pcs of broccoli & add craisinettes to mixtures.  What a perfect after snow or freezing day movie night dinner.  Sure beats the sound of pizza.  Thanks.  I'm saving this.

I really wanted to like this, but the final product just wasn't appetizing for us. I used a bread dough that I've used plenty of times, but I think it just turned out too carb-heavy with the mashed potatoes and the stuffing in the dough. Might be better if stuffing was eliminated and craisins were incorporated- give it a little more punch. I tried to save some by dunking them in velvetta, but to no avail.
