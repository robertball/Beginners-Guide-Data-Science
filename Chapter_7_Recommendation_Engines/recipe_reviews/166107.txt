This recipe sounded really good, but was really quite average.  I did change a few things.  I used fresh pinapple and fresh peppers instead of Tabasco.  I also used half the amount of onion and the onion flavor still overpowered the dish.

We loved this recipe. It is a nice twist away from traditional salsa with your chips...It looks like regular salsa, but the taste was so refreshing. No one could believe it was watermelon, the entire office wanted a copy of the recipe. We've used it on fish too with equal reviews! Would absolutley make again.

I LOVED this recipe. It sounded delicious and that's what it was! I made a few adjustments for my own taste. Firstly, I thought this recipe had mangos in it, but apparently not. So here's what I did:

I kept the watermelon. I substituted the pineapple with mango instead. I used 1/4 cup of onion, which was more than enough for me. I kept the cilantro and orange juice the same. I added 1/4 cup of pineapple juice. I used a little more hot sauce than required because I like spicy!

I also squeezed in the juice of half a lime and a little salt to taste to give it that extra punch! I chilled it for 30 minutes to really get all the flavors nice and settled in. Came out DELICIOUS. My family loved it and I can't get enough. I drink the juice! Yum! I am thinking of making a ceviche next time with this recipe. :-)

I served this for a small "appetizers and drinks" party. It was a hit. The only problem is I'm addicted to it! I wasn't even sure if I'd like it, but I love it! Yum! For presentation we did use the V shaped knife and carve the watermelon to form the bowl, this let everyone know that the salsa was NOT tomato. A+ loved it.

This is good, but I think that next time, I will use a jalapeno pepper instead of the Tabasco sauce!  This is an easy recipe, one that is worth having!

OMG, I made this for a potluck of 35 people, thank goodness allrecipes.com did the recalculations for me.  In all my years of cooking, this simple combination, which sound strange, was THE hit.  I know that all 30 people will be asking me for the link to it here.  I was truly taken aback by the hit that it was.  And so refreshing too!

this was so delicious and refreshing! i didn't have orange juice so i just used a tropical fruit juice blend, and only use half an onion or less and let it sit for awhile.

I thought this was very good.  I did not add the hot sauce and used green peppers for a little kick.  I also cut down the onion as someone suggested.  I also added cantalope.  Tastes great and very colorful!

I brought this to a cookout yesterday and everyone loved it. I did only use 1/2 c of onion as some suggested. I did add Tabasco, but next time may use jalapeno pepper. This recipe was a winner as was the Black Bean & Couscous Salad (from this site) that I also brought to the cookout.

I loved it, my husband not so much.  I left out the tabasco b/c Iâ€™m not a fan of hot salsas but may try adding it in moderation next time.  Also make sure the onions are sweet or it will over power the dish.  Great combination and fabulous with chips on a hot summer night!  I served it as a side with Margarita Grilled Chicken.

I loved this!  I decided to make this because we had a fresh pineapple that needed to be used up, along with a watermelon. I am not a huge fan of watermelon so I used more pineapple and less watermelon. The combination of flavors was a perfect mixture!

Awesome! I didn't have enough Cilantro, so I used fresh Basil, but I didn't use 1/4 cup, (just about 1 TB) because I didn't want to overpower the fruit juices.

This was a hit. We had a small barbecue last night with another couple. Two of the four of us don't like anything "weird" (I.E. salsa with fruit in it) but gobbled this stuff right up. It's a unique salsa, perfect for the summer when watermelons are in season. I followed some of the other cooks' suggestions and used a half cup of onions rather than a full cup. I tossed about a half cup of jarred jalapeno peppers, chopped. Instead of Tabasco, I gave the salsa about 6 shakes of Tapatio hot sauce. Yum!

I recently made this for my son's birthday party.  It was so good!  Several people asked for the recipe.  No one would have guessed it was watermelon.

Made this exactly as listed and it was fantastic!  The whole family loved it.  Served alongside blackened tilapia on a bed of basmati rice with a handful of coconut thrown into the rice cooker.  Would be great with grilled shrimp or with grilled chicken breast as well.

This was a very good recipe. I cut up a watermelon and had a TON left over so I was looking for something different to do with it. This recipe was very tasty, and very simple.  I had everything on hand, except the onion so had to do without. Instead of hot sauce, I added a large jalapeno, minced, and some chipotle chile powder. I like my salsa spicy, and it was easy to adjust to my taste. I also added some pepper and garlic, and the salt from the chips I ate it with was perfect. It turned out great. Thank you!

I add 1/4 cup of fresh basil.

Looks so similar to regular salsa, some people were a bit surpised. I wish the watermelon had been more ripe. I used a chipotle hot sauce which gave it a smoky dimension that was good. My nephew asked for the leftovers.

I made this recipe for a picnic this evening and everyone enjoyed it. They were surprised that watermelon was the main ingredient. Like several suggested I used a jalapeno pepper instead of the hot sauce. I also added the juice of half a lime to the other ingredients, an 1/8 teaspoon of Kosher salt to spike up the flavor and cut back on the onion to 1/2 a cup. The next time I make it, I'm going to add a little more onion and another pepper to amp up the heat. I plan to make the salsa again for at least two more picnics. It's a recipe I'll be making again and again.

This got rave reviews! No one had ever had anything like it before, and this for an adventurous and well-fed group. It is simple to make too. After reading other reviews, I used less than a cup of sweet onions. I used pineapple rings that I cut up instead of crushed pineapple because I wanted the pineapple to be chunkier. Also, I seasoned with serrano chili and cayenne because I had some chillis I needed to use up. Refreshing and delicious!

This is perfect for a hot-summer-day cocktail party. We were outside, so put the bowl on ice in a larger bowl underneath.  Stuck to the recipe. Go ahead and eat it all that day because it gets pretty soupy and not so appealling as a leftover. I used regular tortilla chips. Might try sugar/cinnamon flour tortilla chips?

Extremely refreshing with a great depth of flavor. Loved it! I added salt, pepper, and garlic powder as well as a splash of soy sauce and a few splashes of red wine vinegar. It also tastes great with some mint!
