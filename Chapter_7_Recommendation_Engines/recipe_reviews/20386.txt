Really good. Although maybe a little too sweet if the apples used are sweet ones to begin with. Basically a flat apple pie, which is nice because you get more crust this way. (And the crust is always the best part of pie anyway, isn't it?) :)

Way too much sugar!  I cut down the sugar to about 3/4 cup and it was plenty.  Next time I will also make the dough 1/2 of the recipe at a time.

Good concept, but way too sweet recipe. I cut it to two cups of sugar but it was still way too sweet. It's all getting eaten but it's way too sweet. WAY TOO SWEET! I've done the crust as is and it's good. This time I did it with 1/2 and 1/2 whole wheat and apf...the 1/2 whole wheat turned out nice but not as light....but it was a bit more nutritious.

My Aunt Margaret has made this recipe for years.  It is like apple pie, but the crust is less flaky.  A confectioner's sugar glaze is a perfect foli for this, even better if you add a bit of lemon juice to the glaze!

I had a problem rolling the dough to fit jelly roll pan but made it work.  Being from the north we are familiar with apple slices unlike down here in FL.  I will give it another try.  The slices were wonderful, 1 piece left for husband.

This was my first time to make this and I loved it. I cut the sugar to 2 cups, based on the reviews I read and I used 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white, giving this desert  nice  caramel flavour.  I also cut the cinnamon to 2 tsp, and found that to very nice too. I did not ice mine it was very delicious!!

These bars a really good...I got the recipe over 30 years ago from a friend.  My recipe though only has 1 1/4 c. Sugar and a few drops of fresh lemon juice on the apple slices.  Instead of flour sprinkled over apples, mine has 1 1/2 c. Corn flakes or rice crispies, then the top crust over that.  While it's still hot drizzle with frosting made from 1 c. Icing sugar and enough vanilla and water to make a nice drizzle.   Very yummy!

It was scrumptious- used all different kinds of apples, so used less sugar. Everyone enjoyed it, yes more pastry is good!

I had to make this for 2 apples as that was all I had and they had to be used up.  Reduced everything successfully and it actually turned out really good, albeit very small as I had to use a small rectangular Pyrex dish.  I don't like to hand peel and clean out apples, let alone slice them thinly, but I hate wasting food more.  If an appropriate occasion arose I would make it again, but there is an apple bread recipe on this site that I have used several times.

I am making this in an 12 x 18 pan. So, I'll make the crust recipe 1 & 1/2 times. I like to have enough, even if I don't use it all. I will still cut down on the sugar.  Can't wait to see if it tastes like my mom's. 
Now my sister gave me a recipe with only 1 and a 1/2 cups of sugar. I'll try that. She even adds 2T. lemon. juice. The rest is close to the same.
