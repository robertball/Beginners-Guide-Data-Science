This is a wonderfully fragrant and delicious bread.  The recipe, however, requires 3 cups of bread flour, rather than the 2 cups called for in the recipe.  (Three cups of bread flour is the standard quantity for a 1-1/2 lb. loaf).  This was likely a typing error.

I loved this bread! It baked up perfectly although I took it out of the bread machine about 30 minutes early or else it would have been over done. We ate it with potato soup and it went great with that! My husband said it reminded him of stovetop stuffing...probably the sage.  Try this recipe and you won't be dissapointed!  -- Also this is wonderful toasted with some butter, I bet it would make great crutons -- very flavorful, especially the next day.

This turned out very well, and no adjustments were necessary for high altitude (we live at about 4800 feet).  I decreased the sugar to 1-1/2 Tbs. and the salt to 1 tsp. so that the flavors of the spices might come through.  As I have learned from past experience, it takes a LOT of spice to make a loaf of bread taste like one thinks it should.  This bread is no exception.  Next time I will only slightly increase the parsley, nutmeg, sage, and celery seed, since this bread has a good start on being flavorful.  Really enjoyed this though!!!

This bread is very good.  I did heaping tablespoons or teaspoons of the spices, and I can taste them nicely.  I love the taste of clery seed and it is very prominent in this bread--so make sure you like it if you try it!  I used my bread machine to make the dough, and I think it needed about 1/8 c more flour--bit it was raining here, so that would do it.  I baked in the oven at 375 for about 50-55 minutes.  Turned out nice and golden brown yet still soft enough for sandwiches and flavorful toast.  Thanks for the recipe!

Years ago I first made this bread the first time I made Beefy Mushroom Barley Soup. Have always made them together since, probably cuz there were so many happy noises going around the table.  The soup is one of dd's favorites but this  last time she went back for another slice of bread instead of more soup.

Really tasty, but just a little dry -- I'll add another teaspoon or two of water next time.  Subbed coriander and caraway seed for sage and celery seed, and a healthy amount (maybe 2t?) of garlic powder.  Didn't measure any of the spices, but it takes a lot to really flavor bread so I did err on the generous side.    Next time I think I'll try rosemary and tarragon or maybe basil....this is a really fun recipe to play with.

I liked this recipe.  I had to make one change because I didn't have any celery seed.  It tastes great without it, but next time I will give it a try.  This bread does remind me of the Rosemary bread, which is a family favorite.

The smell was wonderful and it looked good but it was very bland which I was suprised about considering all the ingredients.  Sorry but I would not make again.

This was excellent!  I accidentally doubled the Sage, but other than that, followed directions exactly, and it turned out beautifully.  It's my first homemade bread and my family absolutely loved it.  Thank you for the recipe!

It tasted amazing but, for some reason dough wouldn't rise. I used an oven instead of a bread maker at 350Â° for 45 min. I probably needed to mix the ingredients in a specific order. Will definitely try again.

I added a pinch of clove instead of the nutmeg.  I loved the subtle flavors and texture.  I will make this again.

Served this with dinner just a few minutes after it finished baking, and we ate it all up!  Had a slice later, after it had cooled to room temp, and it was still good but not as good as it was while still steaming.
Followed the recipe, except I didn't have any celery seed on hand so that got left out.  Added about 1/4 teaspoon Italian Seasoning blend.
Very aromatic, wonderful smelling & tasting bread.  Served this with spaghetti & meatballs and they went together perfectly.  This one's a keeper!
