LOVED the filling in these. I substituted zucchini for the cucumber because I had one on hand so it was one less thing I had to buy. What I didn't love was the exterior. It never did brown up like we like them. I know the oven baked method is much healthier but I will deep fry them the next time I make them. Again, the filling in these is excellent!
