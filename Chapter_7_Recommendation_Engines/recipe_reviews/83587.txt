ok....there have been only two reviews and both five stars but ... My family just one by one pushed their bowls to the side and munched on the salad.   I think it needed about double the avacado to make it work and not so much broth.  The lime was overpowering and the wine just made it worse.  I don't mean to be so negative on someones recipe but...this will not be something I make again.  No one ate seconds and no one finished the first round and there were 7 at the table.

perfect accent for a Mexican meal!!  The avocado and lime with crunchy bacon on top was great, things you wouldn't expect in a soup (I did thicken it with corn starch 2T. cs, 2T. water, blend in with a whisk).  Perfect spring, summer meal on its own or as I did, served before a enchilada, burrito and taco meal amongst friends.  will make again and again and again :)

I made this soup in advance for a family dinner party, leaving the cream to add at the last moment.  It is a lovely soup but not a good one for entertaining - because you need to watch it like a hawk.   I accidently let it boil and it made it very bitter.  I thought the cream would be the reason not to let it boil - but in retrospect it was the avocado.

VERY good. Even my husband loved it.  The only complaint we had was it was too runny.  If there was a way to make it a little thicker, it would be a 5 star recipe!

I could eat this Everyday! I used Fat Free 1/2 & 1/2 and added one more avocado to keep it creamy! Didn't need salt or pepper.

I made this vegetarian using vegetable stock instead of chicken and artificial bacon bits instead of real bacon.  It was absolutely delicious!  My husband who hates avocados ate all of his, though he did say it wasn't his favorite.

Instead of blending all of the onion and celery, blend only half of it. This created a hearty contrast and more interesting texture to the soup. We also garnished with chopped cilantro. Skip the white wine and add more heavy cream ;)

Since I don't like onions, my husband added 2 more stalks of celery and used red onions to balance the flavor for me. He loved the soup, I liked the soup. I like a little texture in my soups so he didn't blend it completely smooth, stopping a few seconds before. Great thickness and texture.   The bacon was a little overpowering. For my 2nd bowl, I opted out of adding bacon. More bacon from my husband, he didn't complain. :)  As was said previously, it's a soup you do have to babysit so it doesn't boil. It's one of the most vile (bitter) tasting soups if you do. ~25 years ago, my mother used crab and shrimp to make her version of avocado soup, similar to this recipe, pouring the soup in the shell and set it in the oven to bake. It made a beautiful presentation at the table and smelled great. We had to throw the entire batch away. I do not recall  what we ended up eating for dinner...  Thanks for the recipe.

This soup was perfect for a hot summer day. I made some changes based on the comments, I added a shallot to the onion and a small handful of cilantro leaves before I blended the soup. In the final step I added a TBSP of tequila instead of white wine. To address the watery complaint, I used half as much chicken stock and added a tbsp of greek yogurt. It came out very creamy and not runny at all.

I only gave it four stars because I thought it could use some improvements. Over all it is a great basic recie that you can tailor to your tastes. First I cooked the onions and celery in garlic, leftover bacon fat and cumin. Once everything was cooked, I added cilantro to the blending mixture. I left the mixture somewhat chunky and only used half of the chicken broth so the soup would be thicker. I think next time I will add sour cream on top with the bacon.

I think I put in too much vegatable stock (I substituded) but I just let it simmer for a lot longer to kind of evaporate some of that extra fluid out and I think it turned out pretty good.

I wasn't sure about this the first time I tasted it, but it definitely grew on me! I used an immersion stick blender til it was the consistency I wanted. Ate it for lunch with lightly-toasted Italian bread. Really good! Thanks!

I changed it up a fair amount because a.) its in the middle of a snow storm here and I didn't have all the ingredients b.) make it more Atkins friendly.   I skipped the heavy cream and lime all together, halved the chicken broth, and added a can of water chestnuts, and substituted turkey bacon. Even my husband who doesn't like avocados, liked this soup.

I've made this recipe so many times since I found it. I've tried different variations. The one I made now used fake bacon, vit. d whole milk instead of cream & an extra avacado for thickness, so it could be adjusted as a vegetarian soup. I've also used cashew milk (which is extremely creamy) instead of cream or milk. This is a favorite that almost everyone I know loves. even people that don't really like avacado!

I can't eat dairy or wine so I used 1 can of coconut milk instead of the cream, and reduced the chicken broth by 1 cup (used 3 cups, could have used less).  No wine.  I used three avocados, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp pepper.  I didn't use the lime just because I didn't have any. It was creamy and yummy.

I was anticipating this soup to be so good considering all the amazing reviews it has. This soup had far too much of a wine taste. Underneath, it seems like it had a world of different flavors, especially when you would end up with the tiny bits of bacon. Perhaps I'll try again in the future and use less wine, but it wouldn't be any time soon.

This recipe was fantastic!! My family loved it and even one of my husband's coworkers asked for the recipe, lol. I did not add cooking wine, and sprinkled in some red pepper flakes for heat, I topped it with fresh diced tomatoes, bacon and a little fresh grated sharp cheddar and served it with warm homemade mini tortillas. Delicious!

Very Very good.  I served it with a toasted turkey and cheese sandwhich, like a deconstructed club, and it was perfect.  I may add a hint of garlic next time and a dash of cayane (But that is my taste--I love a hint of spice!) but the flavor is very good.

This is a nice summer soup, I made a few changes. The first is I did not use wine at all, also instead of celery I used cilantro. Finally, after reading other reviews I was afraid of the lime juice so I cut it in half and used lime as a garnish. Also I added 1t. of crushed red pepper. This soup is good but make it your own with a few changes

Pretty decent, but I did substitute 2% milk and Greek yogurt for the heavy cream. I only used 4 pieces of bacon and that was plenty!

I accidentally purchased unripe avocados but I also happened to buy guacamole, so I just used that! It was pretty good- not hardy at all.  I would skip the wine next time. I'm on a liquid diet so trying new soups is important to me!

This was amazing. I did not use the celery in mine because I'm not a fan of it, but the rest was incredible. The savory flavor of the chicken stock blends the flavors of the other ingredients very well. I also love the contrast of the crunch of the bacon with the smooth, creaminess of the avocado. It would go very well with sourdough bread that is very crusty. It was so quick and easy for such a delicious meal!
