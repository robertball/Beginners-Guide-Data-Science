Surprisingly good! The mashed potatoes and gravy combo add a great creaminess to the pizza toppings. As a garlic lover, I might try this with garlic mashed potatoes next time to amp it up, but, the amount suggested in the recipe is likely perfect for others.  We used Jayâ€™s Signature crust.

Amazing. I think the amount could be halved for most things as I only used 1 can of gravy, 20iz if mushrooms, maybe 1 cup of cheese. I used homemade pizza crust and it was amazing. Paired it with pumpkin soup from allrecipes for a thanksgiving themed dinner

I topped this with 1/2 can whole canned cranberry sauce and used tempeh instead of turkey - pretty good!

I made this with my leftover gravy and turkey and I just happened to make garlic mashed potatoes for thanksgiving dinner.  I skipped the mushrooms due to allergies and because of my potatoes i didn't need to add garlic or seasonings. i used mozzarella and a little sharp cheddar on top. This was a super turkey pizza.  Me and my husband really liked it.  My oldest son was not impressed but i will definitely make this again next year for me and my husband and whoever else is willing to take a try at something unconventional.
