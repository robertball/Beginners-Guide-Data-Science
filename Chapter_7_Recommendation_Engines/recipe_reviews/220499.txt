This is a good basic recipe and was a favorite of mine as a child. Over the years, I've experimented with and now I add two quartered onions and use chicken broth instead of water....Incredible!

I would love to know where I can find the pork butt..years ago in Calif we had them and they were wrapped in a red colored cellophane like package, then I moved to Oregon, where not one butcher knew what I was talking about..same here in Arizona, can't find them.

My family loves ham and cabbage. This is a great basic recipe.  The only thing I would do is add a tablespoon of caraway seed for flavor. Yum!

Thanks for sharing - this is exactly how I've been making it for years.  
It's excellent the next day (actually prefer it on day 2)! I slice the potatoes and ham and add fry it until the cabbage gets a little brown color on it.  Yummy!
NOTE to the reviewer who can't find pork butt in her state - pork butt is actually the port shoulder - so maybe if you ask for that you'll have better luck.  It's always sold in my stores here in NJ near the ham slices - but I can still get the one labeled 'butt' in the red cellophane!  Good luck!

As others suggested, I used chicken broth (& about a cup or so of beef broth, for flavor).  I also added carrots, half an onion, & celery.  Cooked these vegetables in butter, salt (~tbsp), & pepper (at LEAST a tbsp) for maybe 5 min then added chicken broth & ~1c beef broth.  I covered for at least 20 minutes to have them soft, but not mushy, stirring & adding chicken broth as necessary.
In a separate pot, simultaneously:
I heated my ham in chicken broth and water (~10 min), then pulled it out to cut it up.  I then cooked the potatoes in the same water (~15 min).  I then scooped out the potatoes and cooked the cabbage in the same water (~15/20 min).
I put it all together for the final product.  AMAZING.

I always use smoked butt on St. Patrick's Day too.

The only change I made was I used vegetable broth instead of the water and I threw in some carrots.

I like to use smoked ham shanks, and as mentioned I add about half a yellow onion cut into big chunks. I also cook the ham in my pressure cooker for 30 to 45 min. Makes the meat fall of of the bone and the bones add a lot of flavor. 
I'm looking forward to trying the suggestion of adding chicken broth!

I used a bone-in ham, simmered for an hour in about 2" of water.  I removed it from the pot, added the cored and quartered cabbage, the potatoes, a bit of black pepper, and simmered that until the cabbage was soft and had released it's natural liquid.  Then I replaced the ham which I had cut into large chunks, heated everything up again and served with crusty rye bread.  Wonderful, hearty meal at any time of year.  It's even better the next day!  (Save the bone for your next batch of ham and bean soup!)

I made this recipe all my adult life and my Mom before me. I was told the corn beef so called traditional is actually Irish American . The Irish (my ancestors) used the ham. I also add carrots to it. Not all grocery stores carry the "ham butt" Just purchased my items for St. Patrick's Day. So simple and basic. Enjoy..

Solid recipe. Tasty. Red potatoes a must and quality chicken broth. Did not have a smoked butt, so I used ham bone. Added cubed ham and cannelli beans. A little garlic herb seasoning with salt and pepper. Great winter recipe with a nice French, crusty baguette

This probably is a good basic recipe. I used some of the comments in other reviews. I cooked the butt in 32 oz of low sodium chicken broth and at least another 32oz of “ low sodium better than bouillon” chicken base dissolved in boiling water. I added two quartered onions, fresh string beans and fresh carrots. The flavor of the chicken broth was good for everything except the cabbage... I wasn’t fond of that flavor. Of course my husband was fine with it?? Also, my smoked butt was very salty so I am glad I only used the pepper that was recommended in the recipe. My husband loves ham and cabbage and he loved this recipe. Honestly, I am not fond of ham and cabbage so it was just ok for me (not anything to do with the recipe!!) thanks for the recipe! It made my husband happy and he doesn’t mind eating it a second time tomorrow. I may try frying the ham and cabbage for a change, as mentioned in one of the reviews!

Simple and delicious. I use two pork butts or one big one. I boil them for about a half hour and then toss the water out and add fresh, bringing it to a new boil for awhile before adding the potatoes and cabbage. You get rid of a lot of the pork fat that way.

Loved this soup. Whole family did, grandkids too! I replaced pork butt with ham bone  from Christmas. Also added 32 oz chicken broth,  Then chopped leftover ham & added it. Mmmm sooo good. Thank you for this simple recipe.

Simple and delicious especially for a cold, winter day. Watch how long you simmer, as cabbage will disintegrate if cooked too long.

I would have given this 5 stars but I made some changes after reading some of the other reviews.  It was delicious and is a definite save!

Going to try this one tomorrow.I went 4* as a temp measure till i try it because site made me rate it. Going to skimp on the potatoes myself to make it a bit more low card friendly.
In response to someone above the pork butt and shoulder are actually the same cut of meat(from the shoulder even though it's called 'butt' in some areas)
