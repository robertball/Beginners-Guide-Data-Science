I made this last night, and amended my rating to 1 Star - it definitely does not work - a pity because the flavors are very good.  I cooked it on direct heat for 3 hours, turning up the heat to boil for a few minutes every now and then, and the rice was still hard.  To try and figure out why, I looked at my Grandma's tried-and-true rice pudding recipe.  With hers, the rice is cooked as normal in water first.  When the water is nearly gone, then the milk is added and cooked on medium low so it bubbles, but doesn't boil.  Stir every 10-15 minutes, adding about 1 cup of milk when it starts to get thick.  Do this for about 1 hour, until the rice looks creamy and the kernels are barely there.  Add the sugar in the last 5 minutes.

I read the comments and took into mind what was mentioned. But I was attracted to the idea of how flavorful this recipe could be. So I used 1 1/2 cup of jasmine rice and used 2 cups of coconut milk and 1 cup of milk cooked and stirred over direct heat for an hour. That seem to work for me. And I did enjoy the flavors. A different kind of of spin off from Indian Keer....

I shouldn't even give it the one star; I followed the directions exactly, and ended up stirring for over 2 hours with the double boiler; after it STILL wasn't done, I put it directly on the heat.  Still not done, and after over 2 hours the rice was still hard and uncooked.  I'm not sure what went on here, but something is wrong with this recipe!!

Boiled over inside my brand-new rice cooker and it hasn't worked the same since. Not sure if it would have tasted good since the batch was ruined... that's what the second star is for, just in case it would have tasted good.

This was OK with the modifications listed by lysis' review.  But it thickened way too much, kept needing to add milk while cooking.  Wasn't quite flavorful enough for me, but it wasn't bad.

After reading the directions and then the reviews, I decided I would not use the cooking method for this recipe. I've never had any luck cooking the rice directly in the milk first (always crunchy rice). So, I used 1 cup already cooked rice and 1 cup milk. I cooked directly on the heat for about 30 min. It was nice and creamy. I really liked the crunch of the toasted coconut on the pudding. However, I thought the rice was too sweet with all the sugar and with sweetened coconut. I also wasn't really sold on cinnamon with the toasted coconut. I'm going to make this again but omit the cinnamon and use a little less sugar.  That way the flavor of the toasted coconut will be more prominent.
