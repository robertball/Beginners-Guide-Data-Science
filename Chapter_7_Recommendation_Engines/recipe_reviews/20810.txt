Nice combination of ingredients , except instead of just any 'spicy ' sausage , try Chorizo , this is a spicy mexican sausage , and for the beans , try 'Brooks' hot chili beans ... these two ingredients will put your chili over the edge ...

Great flavor and so easy too. I used 
2 lbs of pork chorizo instead of the sausage. I used 2 cans of tom sauce and 1 can of diced tomatoes. I used cannelini (white kidney beans) 2 cans, instead of the 1 can of red beans. It was thick and yummy but not to dry.

I have made this chili more than once and have gotten rave reviews every time. I love the Olives! I never thought to use them in a chili but they are delicious. Great for a crock pot dinner too.

I used pork chorizo.  My husband really liked it, but I didn't really care for it. I did enjoy the black olives, but overall the flavor wasn't Wow.  I also prefer more beans in my chili. Good for people who prefer a meatier chili with a spicy kick.

Used italian sausage as directed and followed directions to a t but honestly if you took out the beans it's spagetti sauce not chili.  If you want chili this isn't it if you want spagetti sauce this is a good base recipe.

This recipe had interesting ingredients and a fabulous flavor! I did add one extra can of beans based on other reviews but the olives, to me, made this great! We will definitely make it again...maybe during bowl season!

Made this for a chili contest and it was a winner. I added regular pork sausage and chorizo in equal quantities. I love the addition of green olives. YUM!

I made this as my first ever attempt at making chili, for a chili cook-off at work.  I made the recipe as written, and I used chorizo for the sausage, as recommended by other reviewers.  It was so hot!  I got lots of compliments on it, and people seemed to especially like the olives in it, which I guess is pretty unusual for chili.  To combat the spiciness of the chili, I added a little bit of sour cream to my serving, to cool it off a bit.  I would definitely make this again. :)
