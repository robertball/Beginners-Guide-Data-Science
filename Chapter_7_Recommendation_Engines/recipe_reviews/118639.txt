I thought the flavor was decent. I left out the mushroom and accidentally left out the eggs. I cooked it for 10 minutes longer and the outside was crisp and inside kinda mushy. We ate it tho! Very easy to make. Only thing-even with me forgetting the eggs there was too much mixture to fit in the mini muffin pan so I think with the eggs you may need two OR put them in regular muffins. Im no expert tho. I would eat this again.

I have made it for parties, my family and church and everywhere I take it people rave over it!!!  I use one diced onion and one grated carrot and stalk of celery in place of the frozen mixed vegetables and I don't care for mushrooms so i dice a can of sliced water chestnuts. Then I stir fry the onions in the butter till they're light brown and then add the carrots and celery for a few minutes then add the water chestnuts and let them get hot before adding the broth, then let it all come to a gentle boil before turning it off and adding it to the croutons.  I have used Swiss cheese and it tastes great but I don't always have swiss so I have used other cheeses in it's place (cheddar, shredded mexican, mozzarella, etc...).  This recipe easily fills 2 mini muffin pans.  Do not leave out the eggs, very important to taste and baking process.
