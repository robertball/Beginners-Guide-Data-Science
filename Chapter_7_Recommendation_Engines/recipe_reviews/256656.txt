I don't usually make this type of breakfast. But I thought I would try it and it came out fantastic. My daughter loves bananas and this yielded a few servings. Thanks.

I'd never tried steel-cut oats before, and this was fantastic! I've never eaten a bowl of oatmeal so fast. I put both bananas in the oatmeal and then topped with more brown sugar and the walnuts. So, so good! I was freaked out by the calorie count at first, but I got 4 nice servings out of this, not just 2.
