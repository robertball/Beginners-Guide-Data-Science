This was a great breakfast treat for the family. 

I used cottage cheese and dried cranberries. I had trouble dredging the cakes in flour before putting them in the skillet, eventually I got the hang of it. 

This dish is served best with berries and powdered sugar. My husband and kids put syrup on theirs, but I thought that made it too sweet.

These are soooo good! Their texture is just perfect. Every time you buy them in the store it a hit or a miss. With these you never miss.
Syrniki are the ones that used to traditionally be the weekend family breakfast...but this recipe beats even my mom's. Well done! Thank you, Kangaroo!

I didn't have enough quark made so had to base how much flour used on that. Your recipe is perfect. Instead of 2 eggs, I used 1 (because I have made Syrniki before and didn't have an egg and learned to substitute 1c of spplesauce for the egg)- and 1 c of applesauce. Best Syrniki I've made, glad I lost the original recipe for it!!! Thank you for sharing this!

I altered the recipe for my diabetic needs (no sugar and used raspberries and blueberries instead of raisins only because I didnâ€™t have raisins), but this was very good! Made it several times.
