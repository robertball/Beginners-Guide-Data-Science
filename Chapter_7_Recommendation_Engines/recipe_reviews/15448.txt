I found this recipe to be absolutely amazing! I followed the recipe exactly, but with my own cheese spread. I added together a package of cream cheese, dry chives, minced garlic, garlic powder and onion powder and blended it in the food processor until wonderfully whipped. This is one of the best new recipes I've made in weeks. I highly recommend everyone try this at least once!

These were outstanding.  I was wanting some new recipes for chicken instead of the usual and this was it!!!  It was quite rich so if you fix these make sure you don't make any side dishes that are rich themselves or that have garlic in them.  Here are a few tips for those who could use them:  If you are having trouble finding the garlic cheese spread, I found one made by Philidelphia and it is a Garlic and Parmesan cheese cracker spread.  They just came out with these and it works really well, it should be in the refrigerator isle.  I found it in Wal-Mart.  For those who don't keep bread crumbs around the house like me, you can use crushed crutons.  I used some seasoned crutons that we had and crushed them up, it adds extra flavor too.  Also, for those who said that their chicken was bland, try marinating your chicken AFTER you have pounded them thin, in a bowl of Kraft Zesty Italian dressing, it has to be the ZESTY, regular Italian doesn't work as well.  It's best if you marinate them overnight, but even if it's only a few hours, it still adds a really great flavor.  I 99% of the time marinate my chicken in this dressing first no matter how I fix it.  Hope this helps.  Thanks for a really great recipe.

These were a HUGE hit. Couldn't find the garlic cheese spread and instead used Roasted Garlic flavor Cream Cheese. Came out fine. These also work well to make ahead and freeze.

This was fantastic. Once I pounded the chicken breast, the pieces were pretty big so I only used 2 breats and cut them in half (enough to feed my family of 3). I made my own cream cheese mix with a tablespoon of fresh chopped onion, 4 tsp of minced garlic, and some fresh chives and parsley into 8oz of cream cheese. I slathered this on the chicken breast, rolled and toothpicked and then dipped in butter and breaded. It was delicious!!! I will make it again and again!!

I've used allrecipes for many meals for my family & never have rated any of them. I just made this for my family (did make a few changes) they are picky eaters as in many famly's & they just raved about it. I did make my own filing of cream cheese, montery/garlic cheese, fresh garlic, basil, parsley, salt,pepper & store bought 3 cheese blend. I used town house butter crackers instead of bread crumbs. The best part- :) strips of bacon for a visual. It came out AWESOME !!!
I love this site & all the things it has to offer & that we all can exchange our ideas & our own review's from REAL famlies. Thanks again & hope this was useful to some.

Very good chicken dish! The garlic cheese spread is excellent. However, there was too much Parmesan / bread crumbs mixture; the amount of Parmesan and bread crumbs should be cut in half. This dish compliments very well the Orange Rice Medley recipe from this website. Overall, this is an excellent recipe and I'll definitely make this tasty dish again.

Delicious.  Made this for hubby for Valentine's Day dinner.  It was nice enough to serve for the special day.  I followed the recipe to a T, with the exception of adding fresh mozzarella for the last 10 minutes of the baking.  (Hubby is a cheese lover and I knew he would love the addition...and he did.)  Thanks for the post, will definately make again.

Very tasty.  Recipe was kind of vague about the pounding out so I made mine about 1/2 inch thick and put the cheese at one end and rolled around it.   This made for HUGE rolls so I'll cut the breasts in half next time so they're more manageable.   I didn't use packaged spread (is this Boursin or Rondele?) so I mixed up PHiladelphia cream cheese (the brick) with a handful of chives and several garlic cloves in my food processor.  A definite keeper.

Delicious, I used Japanese breadcrumbs and substituted the garlic cream cheese with garlic goat cheese. I also added Pancetta which was a tasty addition.

This recipe has some weaknesses which, with a little tweaking, easily becomes a 5-star recipe. I couldn't see the point of coating both sides of the chicken before stuffing and rolling it up, so I held off on that until the chicken was rolled and secured with toothpicks. The chicken itself calls for no seasoning, explaining why other reviewers found it bland.  I had some leftover lemon vinaigrette in the fridge, so I marinated the chicken in that, then seasoned it with Penzey's Fox Point Seasoning once I had the chicken breasts pounded out. I used Boursin garlic and herb cheese spread and rolled up the chicken burrito-style to ensure the cheese stayed put. I used homemade toasted bread crumbs to which I added freshly ground pepper, some chopped fresh parsley, and minced garlic along with the Parmesan (the good stuff!). As others have noted, half the amount of crumb mixture is all you need.  To finish, I served this with a drizzle of homemade marinara sauce. The chicken was SO flavorful and tender! And the marinara was the perfect complement to the rich, cheesy filling. I served this with a side of spaghettini and fresh grean beans - a beautiful and delicious meal fit for a king!

I LOVE this recipe and it is my husband's favorite. I make it when we have company served with Tortellini Alfredo. I pour some of the extra alfredo sauce over the chicken before serving...delicious! The only thing I change is I use cream cheese and minced garlic for the filling. Wonderful Recipe!

This recipe was GREAT. I took some suggestions from the other reviews. Many claim you do not need the amount of bread crumbs suggested. I cut back 1/2 and still had too many.  That would be the combination of bread crumbs and parm cheese. Also, I added some slices of shaved ham, onlyh b/c I had it in the frig. You can make this ahead. DO NOT dip in the butter and crumb mixture until the next day. What I did was to fill them, roll them up, cover, refrigerate. Next day, dip them in butter and bread crumb mixture. Bake at 25-30 mins. 35 min. is too long as they need to sit for a few minutes and will cook a little longer while sitting. I will make this again!!!

This was so easy to make, and was declared 12 out of 10 stars! I used cream cheese, mixed with fresh chopped garlic and dried chives instead of the cheese the recipe asked for. I cooked it for 50 minutes and it was done perfectly.

My husband does not like chicken. He just doesn't.  So when he said, "This is so good" and I said, "would you want to eat it again" and he said, "Anytime", I knew it was a winner.  Instead of dipping in butter, I marinated it in homemade Italian dressing and the breading stuck great.  I also made my own garlic cream cheese, sauteed mushrooms and spinach (because I needed to use them) and it was restaurant quality.  Thanks for this easy, delicious recipe!

Delicious! Could not find the garlic cheese spread so instead I've used Philadelphia Parmesan garlic spread. (Thanks to other reviews) It was well loved by everyone. Yummy!

I made this Saturday night for my fiancé and he LOVED it!! Said this goes to the top of his favorite list! I did do some changes to it b/c I used what I had. Here is what I changed. I took regular cream cheese and added garlic powder, onion powder, and garlic salt I didn’t measure I just added some mixed well and tasted it and added whatever else I needed. Next time I will know to only use half a package of cream cheese b/c a whole package was way to much. I also added a little bit of finally shredded cheese to the mix to help with not being so runny. I used about 3 tooth picks on each piece of chicken to help close it up and keep the cream cheese mix in I think I only had one really “leak” out but it was pretty stuffed full. I took some of the other user’s advice and I used shake n bake in place of bread crumbs. I also added a thin slice of ham to the mixture to make it more like a chicken cordon blue taste and my fiancé raved about how that helped make the dish! Thanks for the awesome recipe this is a keeper for sure!! :)

This recipe was amazing and so easy! The only change I made was that i seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, and garlic powder before breading. I had some left over cheese mix so I melted it down with butter and milk and made a great cream sauce to go on top of it. It was delicious!

This recipe was AMAZING!  However I didn't follow it exactly...  I didn't have seasoned bread crumbs so I took the plain and seasoned it with onion powder, garlic powder, parsley, oregano, basil, rosemary and coriander.  I didn't measure anything either, just poured it in!  I butterflied the chicken and put 2 wedges of the laughing cow garlic and herb cheese on the bottom half of each, folded it together, rolled it in the butter and then the bread crumb/ Parmesan cheese mixture and baked at 350 for 30 minutes.  It was perfect!  My picky husband took a bite and was amazed!  Definitely will do this again, next time for some more people!

Loved this!! I didn't have a pounder so instead I butterflied the chicken and secured it with toothpicks. It worked fine as well, even though some of the cream escaped. I make this all the time!

You must try! I made these this week and they were delicious! I used recipe as a base recipe only and then modified to my liking. I pounded 2 boneless skinless chicken breasts between 2 pieces of wax paper til they were nice and thin. I then marinated them in ranch, basil, italian seasoning, pinch of cayanne, and a bit of olive oil for a few hours. I used melted butter to make the mix of bread crumbs and cracker crumbs stick to one side of each breast. Then I chopped garlic, jalapenos, and peanuts. I mixed these with  sour cream, a pinch of cayanne, oregano, italian seasoning, and italian herb philly cooking cream. I spooned the filling into each breast and rolled up, securing with toothpicks. I put into a shallow baking dish and I used the remaining melted butter on top of each chicken roll, then added more crumbs. Baked at 350 degrees for 45 minutes. They came out perfect and crispy. My boyfriend loved them. I forgot the cheese but they still were fantastic. Quick and easy to prepare. Will definitely make again.

Made this last night for the first time, was looking to make something different with chicken breasts and this was a huge hit! I used fresh flavored bread crumbs that I got from a local bakery, which added better flavor then the typical bread crumbs you buy in the grocery store. I also used "Boursin" cheese spread-it's a garlic and herb cheese that is very rich and flavorful. It was GREAT! The cheese was very creamy inside and the taste was amazing if you love garlic. I had the Boursin cheese in the house so I used that but I would def make my own cheese mixture if I didn't. Also just another little tip...use a generous amount on the dollop of cheese as it only gives you more deeelish cheese oozing from the roll-ups to eat! It's sooo good! Will make over and over again! Yay, a new chicken dish that everyone loves! Hope this helps! Happy cooking everyone!

I found this to be way too rich for my taste.  I did use onion and chive cream cheese and it was just too heavy. I will try again with ham and swiss cheese as the coating was good and it was very quick to make as I used thin sliced boneless chicken breast.

Best chicken recipe I've ever tasted!!  Definately a keeper!  I did substitute the garlic cheese spread with onion & chives flavored cream cheese because I couldn't find the garlic cheese spread at my store.

I made this dish last week for my family and have been asked to make it  again EVERDAY. It is sooo easy but is impressive enough for company. I took a previous persons' suggestion and marinated with Zesty Italian Dressing a couple hours before hand. I found you can omit the butter as the crumbs  (I used croutons crushed) covered the chicken easily with the marinade. Just make sure you don't over cook the chicken 25-30 mins was ample. A keeper!

I love this recipe, nice twist on preparing chicken. I made this for dinner and everyone loved it. I can't wait to make this again. The garlic cheese spread is a nice compliment to the cheddar.

Wow this was great, we really liked it a lot!  I used herbed goat cheese to make it this time, but other spreadable cheeses would also work great.  The only thing I would change is to make less breadcrumb mixture; I did not need all of it.

this was really good. I couldn't find a good price on the garlic cheese spread so I used whipped garlic cream cheese. I used 3 breasts, halved the bread crumbs and the parm cheese, and probably only 3 oz of "spread." It was a little difficult to roll the chicken, but overall it wasn't hard and turned out great. I'd make it again.

Sad to say I was not impressed at all with this dish. Followed the directions exactly and it was just not good.  My husband said it was "ok" and ate most of it but after two bites I threw mine out.  The texture of the cream cheese was very off putting and the flavor was just "wrong" I wont be making these again.

Thank you for this recipe. It will become my go to recipe for chicken breasts from now on. I used Philadelphia brand garlic cooking creme. I also halved the amount of (Italian) bread crumbs. This dish looks so professional to be so easy.

Yum!  This was delicious.  I used panko bread crumbs (all I had) and just mixed in some italian seasoning and some garlic powder.  I also did what others have done and made my own cream cheese mixture by combining softened cream cheese, minced garlic, onion powder, dried basil, and dried parsley.  When DH says that a chicken recipe is "Good" you know you've got a winner. :)

Such a hit!!!  I found this recipe when searching by ingredients, and WOW!!!  My fiancee told me I need to make this again...very soon (which is a HUGE compliment coming from him).  The only variation I made was using garlic butter to coat the chicken breast, used Herb and Garlic cream cheese and added a sprinkle of shredded cheddar cheese to the inside before rolling the chicken as well as a little on top with 5 minutes left to cook.    Thanks so much for the great easy meal!  :)

I actually made these with thin slices of pork loin. They turned out really well. I though the garlic cheese was a bit bland, but I used a homemade version of it. The one person that I thought wouldn't like it said they were really good. He liked the change from how the chops are usually prepared. I will use again...and with chicken!! :)

My husband said this was the best thing I'd ever made! It was pretty easy too! I couldn't find the cheese listed in the recipe, so I made a garlic cream cheese from another All Recipes. It was wonderful.

This was absolutely delicious and easy!  I used the Rondele brand.  I never really cared for it much as a spread but it's GREAT as a filler for chicken.

Wow, if there was a ten-star rating, this recipe would get it from me.  This is probably the best recipe that I've tried using chicken breasts, bar-none!  I followed this recipe to the letter but didn't have the suggested cream cheese, so I followed another reviewers suggestion to mix cream cheese with garlic, onion powder and chives.  It is simply AWESOME!  A dish fit for company without a doubt.  The suggestions that I would make is use 1/2 the cream cheese mixture that was suggested by the other reviewer and 1/2 the breadcrumb mixture because I had a lot leftover and even sprinkled extra over the top.

Excellent recipe and very easy.  For the garlic cheese, I used Laughing Cow Light Garlic and Herb cheese spread at 35 calories a wedge. Each roll up took 1/2 wedge.  I did have way too much bread crumbs and parmesan mixture, at least 50% too much.  Before the roll ups went into the oven, I drizzled them with about 2 tablespoons of melted butter and sprinkled them with 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese.  I will definitely make this again!

I've been making something like this for years. It's fast and easy to throw together. The garlic cheese spread that I use is a base of 1/3 fat free cream cheese, just a little bit of milk to thin and herbs, sometimes I'll dice up and toss into the cream cheese sun dried tomato. You can either use dried herbs or fresh. The "garlic cheese" also makes a great appetizer to top your favorite cracker

This was delicious - I felt like a fancy chef when those delicious smells started coming out of my oven!  I just had plain  breadcrumbs, so I mixed in the parm, and then some basil, oregano, parsley, garlic powder, pepper, and dried pesto spices.  I coated both sides of the chicken with the spice mix.  For the filling, I found a whipped garlic cream cheese, and that worked out really well.  It was a little lighter and very flavorful.  Definitely a hit in our house!

Very good! Used cream cheese with some minced garlic instead of cheese spread, used two chicken breasts, pounded flat and cut in half. Ton of excess bread crumbs at end that had to just get thrown away, so next time I will only use half that amount. Baked for 25 minutes and turned out very well! Served with long grain and wild rice. My mom and I loved it!

These are delicious! This recipe is a keeper. This dish is so easy to make. I used chicken breast tenderloins and didn't pound down the meat at all and they rolled up fine. Used cream cheese like other reviewers mixed with garlic and onion powder and dried parsley. Chicken turned out perfect, very moist and tender.

these were delicious!  i was skeptical because it didn't call for browning before oven cooking, but pleasantly surprised at first bite.  the filling is a great base for adding other ingredients.  i went with sliced sauteed mushrooms and minced fresh garlic, 4 slices fried and crumbled bacon, salt, cayenne, one finely chopped green onion and parsley flakes.  i dipped the breasts in buttermilk (rather than the butter called for) and drizzled the melted butter on top to ensure it wouldn't dry out.  just an unbelievable recipe.  a must do!

I don't know guys... It sounded like a rich dish that I might get at a restaurant, but it just wasn't that good to me.  The outside was dry and sandy, the chicken was bland, and the center was delicious but it tasted like it needed to be on a bagel, not in the middle of my dinner plate.  I even added some extra spices to give it a boost.  The flavors didn't blend well and nobody at my dinner table really loved it.  Maybe marinara sauce over the top would bring it all together more?  But I probably wont be trying this again.

What a yummy recipe!  It was quick and easy to make but had lots of flavor.  Made own cream cheese mixture as others had suggested. UPDATE: The next time we made this, we added a thin slice of red pepper inside the chicken & this turned out great too!

SO GOOD!!!  Definitely a keeper!  I didn't have any "Garlic Cheese Spread" so I mixed an 8 oz pkg of room temperature cream cheese with garlic/onion powder and parsley flakes...turned out excellent.  It was my first time cooking dinner for a guy I recently started dating (what pressure!!) and I was so happy I picked this recipe...he loved it!  Kudos!

excellent recipe. I wanted to cook something easy that *looked* hard for an anniversary. This dish is delicious, easy to make, and impressive.

I found this to be a little bland.  I made my own filling by using cream cheese, fresh minced garlic, fresh parsley and a little fresh basil.  I pounded the chicken thin, salted the chicken, dipped both sides in the butter and dredged both sides in the bread crumbs.  I also added a little mozzerella to the filling.  If I made it again, I would marinate the chicken overnight.

I was hoping to fall head over heels in love with this but, sadly, it didn't happen. We felt this was pretty bland. Sorry :(

Amazing! Per other reviewers, I also ended up just cutting a pocket into the chicken and stuffing it with the cheese versus pounding, rolling, etc. It turned out phenomenal! Even the leftovers were good!

I was looking for a new chicken recipe as my husband was sick of the regular chicken breast supper....this was a hit to say the least. It was so easy to make and so delicious! He said it was like something out of a restaurant! Will definitely make again...I used garlic philidelphia cream cheese and also sprinkled some grated cheese on top for the last 10 mins of baking like another reviewer added and it was sooo good!

Good.  Used The Laughing Cow light garlic and herb cheese.  Would try a different cheese spread next time to get even more flavor.

I made this tonight but made my own garlic cheese spread with 4 oz crm cheese, 1/4c parm cheese,1/4 C minced red bell pepper,parsley for color. For the breadcrumb substitute I used panko crumbs with basil,salt n pepper,and 1/8 tsp of dill. Seved it with mashed potatoes, and buttered corn. Nice change to basic stuffed chix breast like cordon blue,kiev, and reg stuffing. Thank you

This turned out absolutely delicious! I used Laughing Cow light Garlic and Herb cheese spread from Acme. I only had plain breadcrumbs on hand so i added garlic and onion powder, crushed red peppers and Italian seasoning to add flavor. Otherwise I followed directions to a T and it turned out great. Served with Garlic bread (we love garlic) and rice w/ veggies. I will certainly make again.

I'd give this one five stars if I didn't have to adjust a thing, but I DID make my own cream cheese filling from spring onion, cream cheese, a bit of minced garlic, and white pepper. Aside from that... a HUGE hit at my house and another recipe I took the time to print out and add to my old brass recipe box.

yummy and tasty! my hubby made himself sick from eating so much of it. for only 4 chicken breasts, you only need like half the called for amount of bread crumbs/parmesan. I ended up with about 3/4c. left over. alot of waste in my book. other than that i wouldnt change a thing.

Yummy and easy! I used Philly chive & onion cream cheese and added 2 cloves of garlic and some fresh parsley and blended it all together in my mini cuisinart. BF thought it was delish but something was "missing". I may wrap a piece of turkey bacon around it next time.

Very Yummy! I used Philadelphia brand parmesan and garlic herb cracker spread as the filling and it turned out great. The only problem I had was that some of the cheese came out during cooking. We spooned it over the top of the roll and it was delicious.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was excellent!! I always use tons of garlic and I added chopped parsley to the cream cheese (made my own) as well as a little basil and italian seasoning. I also just poured the melted butter (added tarragon, parsley, garlic salt and lemon thyme to butter before melting in micro) over the top rather than dip both sides in.  My husband was thrilled with this and we make it all the time now. This is a very versatile recipe and can be changed up many different ways!  Thanks for this great recipe! :)

Followed the recipe as written, except for the garlic cheese spread (couldn't find that here). I used a fines herbes spread, but I did add some garlic powder to the breading mixture. (There was quite a bit of the breading mixture left over, though.) The flavor was excellent, and the chicken was moist. Will definitely make this one again. It's good enough for company! Thanks for sharing this one.

Hubby & I enjoyed this recipe very much...will do it for company. Just to make it go a little quicker, I spread the crumbs & cheese on a piece of wax paper, generously buttered one side of the prepared chicken, then pressed buttered side into crumb mixture.....simple & clean-up is easy !.

This was really good! I bought Allouette Light Garlic and Herb. I was worried it would ooze out but it didn't. My husband doesn't care for creamy things and he liked it. I used the little container for 3 breasts and it was fine.

Wow, oh Wow, oh Wow! This was unbelievable! I followed the recipe completely except I doubled it and I'm so glad I did. My 'garlic cheese' was made by Alouette - Garlic and Herbs spreadable cheese. I did bake them about 8 minutes longer (48 minutes). Very easy and delicious!

I can tell this will be great but it reminded me of my Chicken Parmesan. I use the Seasoned Pepperidge Farm Stuffing mix with the spices....and it's just enough seasoning and I usually have some I save for these recipes.  I do run it through my processor to make the crumbs more fine or roll in plastic bag like we did before we had processors. I do that when I make Chicken Parmesan then shake my chicken pieces right in the bag.

I read the reviews and tried it; couldn't agree more, this is fabulous!  It has a very apealing yet not overwhelming flavor.  I also could not find a garlic cheese spread so I used the Philly cream cheese... worked fine!

Wonderful!  Only difference was that I used Panko bread crumbs!  Next time I will also try as another reviewer suggested, putting fresh mozz. cheese on top after the final few minutes of baking!  Great Recipe!

I made this recipe for my boyfriend's family, all pretty picky eaters, and they loved it. I changed the recipe slightly, instead of dipping the chicken in butter I used egg. I also used store bought garlic spread, Alouette Garlic and Herb Cheese, normally can be found in the bakery part of the grocery store with the other refrigerated dips. It was wonderful. I pounded out the chicken, dipped ONE side in egg and coated ONE side with Italian seasoned bread crumbs and parm. cheese then put a spoonful of alouette cheese on the uncoated side and rolled it up. It was amazing!! Definitely one of our new favorites.

Last night I wanted to grill out but it was too cold and I had some chicken to use up. I checked out this website my mom told me about and found this recipe. I used crushed corn checks instead of bread crumbs, put fresh spinach leaves on the chicken befor the cheese, and instead of garlic cheese I used fat free cream cheese and added minced garlic, garlic salt and parsley. I had to improvise because I didn't have all the things the recipe called for. My 2 girls LOVED it and so did I. I also would recomend trying a sprayable butter to get the breading to stick because the melted butter would get thick again from the chicken being cold and it fell off when I picked the chicken up to put it in the baking dish.

This was nice and delicate and very easy to make.  You could easily half the bread crumb/Parmesan mixture.  I didn't have garlic cheese spread so I used softened butter mixed with garlic, shredded jack and asiago cheeses, mayo and green onions that I had leftover from garlic bread that I had made.  This was so good and looks like you spent a lot of time on it.
12/25/11: Made this for Christmas; a very elegant presentation.  We added 8 oz. of cream cheese to the filling this time.  I think next time we'll go to dipping it in an egg mixture so the breading stays on better.  So good, though!  Thank you for sharing.

Yummy! Even my husband loved it! I made it with Philadelphia brand Cracker Spreads, Parmesan with Garlic and Herb cheese spread. I also put shredded mozzarella cheese on top of the cheese spread before rolling it up. And, I didn't have any bread crumbs so I crushed up some Butter and Garlic croutons instead. Turned out great! This recipe is a keeper!  Update: I experimented some more and made it even better! We're currently on the Atkins diet so I tried 2 new ways to reduce carbs.  For my husband I used crushed BBQ Pork rinds in place of the bread crumbs and for mine I sprinkled the chicken with Italian herb seasoning and parmesan cheese.  For the filling for both I used plain cream cheese and white cheddar garlic and dill cheese.  Excellent!

This was delicious! So easy to prepare with the little amount of ingredients I had on hand. This was spectactular accompanied by a cold pasta salad with sweet peppers, olives, cherry tomatoes, red onions, parmesan cheese and Italian dressing. I'm impressed.

I thought this was a good base recipe.  I didn't have everything so I improvised.  Instead of bread crumbs, I used crushed corn flake cereal.  The filling I mixed 4oz of cream cheese with 2Tbs of prepared crushed garlic, couple sprinkles of dried parsley, 1/4 tsp salt, and 1/3 cup of shredded pizza cheese.  I had a little bit of Ragu pasta sauce in the fridge that desparately needed to be used up so I poured around the chicken.  Yum, Yum.  Can't wait to make again. Will try adding a couple of pepperoni slices next time.

Delicious!  These were very easy to make and everyone loved them.  *Here's a tip for "beating" the chicken breast - place the breast in a large ziplock bag then pound them with a meat cleaver.  This contains the mess.  This has become a family favorite!

I made this for my family at a dinner party and it was a huge hit. The chicken breasts were large once pounded so they were packed into the baking dish which helped the cheese stay in. I also sprinkled some of the cheese and breadcrumb mix on top before baking. Really really good!

Great recipe! I work evenings so try to prepare food for my husband or kids to throw in the oven. I was running behind so put chicken in casserole pan, spread the cheese mixture on chicken then added crumb/parm mix. I left instructions to drizzle with butter and bake. The entire family loved it! Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe was very easy and quick to prepare.  It was delicious, too!  Hubby raved about it!  We used a garlic/herb cheese spread (from our grocery deli) and Italian-seasoned bread crumbs.  We also sprinkled a little extra cheese over the top, just before baking.  Served it with spicy green beans and buttered corn.  Will be adding this to our regular roation of meals!

I only had unflavored breadcrumbs, so I added dried parsley, oregano, and basil to the breadcrumbs. I was concerned there would not be enough flavor, so I added fresh minced garlic to the butter. The results were still wonderful!

I had chicken breasts thawed, and by the time I was ready to cook dinner I just wasn't in the mood to make or eat all the normal chicken dished I usually do. I happened upon this, and awesome. Since I wasn't prepared, I didn't have the garlic cheese spread, so I used cream cheese. I added garlic, rosemary, parsley, basil, and salt and pepper (normally I would have let that saturate for a while, but time wasn't on my side). I added some spices to the bread crumbs too. It was fantastic. Lots of variations you could do, to mix it up, but still the same prep. Many thanks!

Great Recipe!! Made it for family that came over and everyone loved it! Followed some other's reviews and marinated the pounded chicken breasts in Zesty Italian dressing for about 1/2 hr., used the Alouette Garlic & Herb spreadable cheese and used Progresso Italian Panko breading with some extra parm cheese on top... turned out awesome!

Wonderful, I used progresso Italian bread crumbs or garlic and herb. I also used swiss cheese instead.

I made this with Boursin garlic cheese spread but couldn't taste the cheese, probably because most of it squished out the sides while baking. But visually, it was beautiful and I think if I pounded the chicken thinner and used cream cheese instead it might work better. Also, there was way too much of the bread crumb mixture. I'll try cutting it in half next time.

This was a delicious recipes for cheese lovers! I used Boursin cheese spread since it was on sale and panko bread crumbs for a crunchier texture. I also marinated the chicken using McCormick's garlic and wine packet.

I thought this was great. The only thing I added was a little lemon zest to the breadcrumbs (which were crushed croutons) and marinated the flattened chicken in a Lemon pepper sauce for 1hr. I love the lemon-chicken taste, if you don't so much, leave out the zest. Great recipe, I will make it again!

This is pretty good, and VERY easy.  I made homemade garlic spread with 7 oz Philly cream cheese spread, 4 minced garlic cloves, and garlic salt to taste.   I was pleased that the cheese spread stayed inside the chicken and did not run out everywhere.  Would make again.

I thought this was very good.  I bought the already thin chicken cutlets, to save some time.  I followed the directions pretty much to a T.  Only thing I did differently was that I added some parmesan on top of each chicken bundle right before cooking.  I made these with the Parmesan Asparagus from this website too.  Very good meal!  Thanks!

My husband really enjoyed this, so 5 stars!  I used Rondele garlic & herbs cheese spread, but used less than a full container.  I also decreased the bread crumb/parmesan mixture by half and still had enough to coat the chicken.  Next time, I'll decrease the cook time as my chicken was slightly overcooked.

Very, very good.  I marinated the chicken breast in fat free Italian dressing and a bit of lemon juice for 2 hours before baking.  It kept the chicken very moist while cooking. My chicken only needed 27 minutes in the oven...any longer and it would have been overcooked. I will be making this again!

LOVED it!  I made 8 breasts with the same amount of ingredients and I didn't skimp at all on the mixture.  I think if you were going to only do 4, you really could use 1/2 cup of bread crumbs.  I used the Itailian bread crumbs in mine,  I didn't have to use much of the garlic cheese spread.  I found the cheese spread in the cheese case (not with all the prepackaged stuff) and a small teaspoon is plenty!  I also sprinkled some leftover bread crumb mixture on the top of each piece of chicken and then topped it off with a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese.  I didn't use the prepackaged parmesan cheese, I purchased the grated real stuff!   VERY, VERY GOOD!!!

Yummy!  I couldn't find the garlic cream cheese though, so I used onion & chive.  I also breaded both sides of the chicken.

Delicious! I followed the revies and marinated the pounded out chicken breasts in Italian dressing and made my own cream cheese spread with my food processor. Since the breasts were already covered in dressing I just poured the butter on at the end and it worked fine. I used light cream cheese. Served this with brown rice and creamed peas and onions but I would recommend a lighter veg as the chicken was very rich. I will make these again and experiment with different seasonings.

I made the dill, feta and garlic cream cheese spread for the stuffing - WOW - It was awesome!!!  I didnt change a single thing in the recipe.  My only complaint was it didnt get crispy enough.  I would somehow like to be able to fry the outside of the chicken to make a crispy coating.  I think this would have been wonderful as chicken Parmesan, which I will try next time.   For those who didnt think there was enough coating, I re-breaded the chicken after I stuffed and rolled it and it seemed to be just fine.  I cant wait to try this many different ways.  After the chicken parm, I am gonna try them adding bacon to the cheese mixture.

My boyfriend who doesn't like chicken breasts very much said I should make this again.  That's definately a hit recipe!  Per other reviews, I marinated the chicken in Italian Dressing for a few hours first.  For the cheese I used Laughing Cow French Onion flavor (that's what was in the fridge) and did 1 triangle per chicken breast.  The bread crumbs were Panko with seasonings added (red pepper, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, and black pepper).  Since I marinated it in dressing I skipped the butter except to spray the rolls with butter-flavored PAM before baking.  My oven took a little longer so it was baked at 350 for 40 minutes and 375 for 7 minutes.  Maybe the breasts were thicker? I will definately make this again and try different flavors of cheese spread.

these looked and tasted awesome! couldn't find any garlic cream cheese so i just used the onion and chives cream cheese and mixed 1/2 tsp of garlic powder into it. also 1 cup of bread crumbs is too much. i hate wasting food. 1/2 a cup would have been plenty to coat 4 chicken breasts.

Excellent recipe.  The best I've found out here.  I took the advice of others and cut the breasts in half after pounding them and it was the perfect sized serving.  Anxious to try this with other spreads as well.

This receipt has become one of my favorites.  I add sun-dried tomatoes on top of the cheese spread before I roll them up.  They're very easy to make and have tons of flavor.

These were fantastic.  I couldnt find garlic cheese spread so I used onion and chive cream cheese.  That was the closest I could find.  I added minced garlic to it though.  I followed the recipe exactly besides that and they came out wonderful.  I will definatley make these again.

I made this randomly when i invited a couple of people over for birthday, and now i make it all the time. I marinade the chicken in milk, balsamic vinegar, some lemon juice and spices for a couple of hours beforehand. I also add around a teaspoon of lemon zest to the filling. Always turns out soft and amazing.

I made this for 23 guys at our hunting camp. They loved it. I made about 8 pounds of chicken and I used different cheese shreads I will make it again.

It was very difficult to mix the cheese and other ingredients together and even 'spreading' them onto the chicken was pain. When we did cook it however, it was ok. The taste was kind of bland, just a cheesy garlic flavor on breadcrumbs, nothing special.

This was great. I would've given it 5 stars but i had to make my own cream cheese filling cause the first time i tried it with the stuff recommend by other people and it was WAY to much garlic and Parmesan for my families taste. Great chicken adding it to my list of foods to make.

These were very very yummy.  I followed suggestions for the stuffing and therefore changed several things, so I can't rate it 5 stars, even though it tasted that way when I was finished.  The changes I made are as follows...1) I marinated the chicken in zesty italian dressing overnight 2) For the stuffing I used 8 oz of 1/3 fat cream cheese, 2 tsp chives, 3 tsp minced garlic, 1/4 tsp garlic powder, 1/4 tsp onion powder, 1 tsp dried parsley and 1/4 c (3) cheese blend.  I mixed all of these in a food processor and spread it completely over the unbreaded side of the chicken.  I secured the rolled chicken with cooking string, I find toothpicks don't hold it quite as pretty as I would like. 3) I placed a pat of butter on each breast and baked as directed.  These turned out really yummy and really filling!

This was so tasty!  I used my favorite garlic herb spread - Alouette.  I did find my portions to be way too big and i think made even cooking much more difficult.  Next time will divide up the breasts and it should work much better.  But any way I can incorporate Alouette into something - YUM!

This recipe was very very good.  The only thing I did differently was in the cheese.  I wanted to make these but didn't want to go to the grocery store, so I mixed light cream cheese with garlic powder, onion salt & parsley.  Perfect!  I also used panko crumbs rather than bread crumbs because that's what I had.  Turned out great - will definitely make these again!

Very easy and tasty -- the two prerequisites for going in my recipe box!  To make an easy recipe even easier (for those of us who have trouble pounding out chicken), thankfully you can find thin-cut chicken at most grocery stores.

Easy, quick and yummy!  I also used Philadelphia's Garlic and Herb spread, it has a very good flavor.  Some of the filling oozed out during baking, so I just scooped up the stuff that came out and poured it back on top of the chicken like a sauce right before serving.  Everyone raved!  Thanks, Wendy!

This was so simple and delicious!  I'd half the bread crumb/parmesean cheese mixture, there was a lot left over.  Put as much garlic cheese filling as you can in the chicken.  I went easy on the filling and wished there was more.  Thanks for the great recipe!

These were ok but very rich and very tough to keep together.  You almost need a perfectly shaped piece of chicken for each roll-up.

I cheated and just cut a pouch in the side of the breast, used heaping tablespoon of herb and garlic cream cheese. Rolled in milk to moisten, then used 1/4 cup bread crumbs, 1/4 cup panko, 2 tbsps parmesan cheese, garlic powder and pepper to season for the crumb coat. Place on foil lined sheet, baked 400 degrees for 40 minutes. Big hit and really tasty!

Made this recipe a few days ago as written.  It was very good, but I found I needed about 1/2 of the parmesan/bread crumb mixture - the rest went to waste. I used Alouette brand Garlic Cream Cheese Spread and it tasted great.  I may try with another flavor variation just for fun.  My very picky kids liked it, so that's always a plus!

This recipe was so delicious and easy!  I used Chive and Onion cream cheese instead of Garlic Cheese Spread and it was SO tasty!  It is my experience and opinion that the amount of breadcrumbs/parmesan mixture the recipe calls for is way way way too much.  I ended up throwing so much of it away (and I couldn't re-use it since I dipped raw chicken in it).  I'd cut the amount at least in half and it would still be plenty.  Really really good meal though, we served it with rice... love it!  :)

Absolutely terrific.  Here's a little time saver.  Instead of pounding chicken breasts, I buy "thin-sliced" chicken breasts. (Purdue makes them). They are already thin, and end up being the perfect size for roll-ups.  I use them when I make Cordon-Bleu, too.  I've never been disappointed.

My family loved it. My husband asked me if I would make it again Sunday - 3 days from now! The feedback from everyone else about cutting the breadcrumbs in half and where to find the garlic cheese spread were extremely helpful. I'm going to pass this recipe on to my daughter!

Very Tasty, I used a garlic herb goat cheese instead of the spread.  I also used italian bread crumbs and added the parmesan cheese to that.  Will defintitely make again.

This chicken is always a hit!  Not only does it taste delicious, but it is so easy to prepare. I have made these several times and have always heard rave reviews!  I will be making them again this weekend, but this time I am going to skip with breadcrumbs (trying to do low carb) and instead will marinade them in Zesty Italian dressing and then stuff them with the cheese. We will see how it turns out!

Really nice and easy to make.  Pounded out four chicken breasts and had to adapt the filling as I had none of the items on hand.  I used some goat cheese, previously cooked bacon, some shredded cheese, and a little salt, pepper, and parsley.  Otherwise followed the recipe as written and it came out great.  Served it with mashed potatoes and veggies and it was well received.

Delicious!  I used Laughing Cow garlic & herb cheese wedges and also sprinkled a little feta, italian seasoning and pepper.  I stuffed the chicken with roasted red peppers, artichoke hearts and capers and then drizzled the butter and dipped in bread crumbs.  My guests' plates were clean!!

SUPER GOOD!  I used the garlic spread recipe submitted by CKBK from allrecipes (which is cream cheese, butter, parsley, onion and garlic).  I marinated my chicken for a few hours in Kraft Sun Dried Tomatoe Dressing and a little white wine.  This was by far one of the best recipes out there!

This was amazing!  My mom, the critic, was even wowed with this recipe when I made it for dinner the other night!  I used thinly sliced chicken breasts so I didn't have to pound it & Philadelphia Whipped Garlic & Herbs cream cheese...it was fast (to prepare), easy & delicious!!!!

This recipe is a keeper!  It was very quick and easy and very good.  I misunderstood the recipe when I was making it and added bread crumbs to the stuffing rather than just rolling the chicken in bread crumbs.   I still rolled the chicken in the bread crumbs, though, and it still turned out great despite my mistake.  I think the next time I make it I will purposefully make the same mistake again, because the bread crumbs added to the stuffing helped to thicken it a bit and stay inside the chicken while it baked.

I used onion and chive cream cheese mixed with garlic powder since I could not find the garlic cream cheese. After they were done, I sprinkled a mixture of mozarella and cheddar cheese on top. Very good!

This recipe was awesome! I used garlic and herb cream cheese and we absolutely loved it! My only problem was that the filling melted out of the rolls, so I think I’ll just stuff the chicken breasts next time. Great recipe!!

This recipe was excellent, but I made it in my own way.  I halved the breadcrumbs and used crushed Ritz crackers for extra crunch and flavor.  I also used cream cheese instead of the cheese spread, and mixed in my own variety of seasonings.  Also, before adding the cheese and rolling up, I added a slice of bacon, and the results were INCREDIBLE.  So thanks for the idea!

These were wonderful and moist - always a good sign when the leftovers never made it to the next day :)  My addition:  I added a 1/2 stick of string cheese to each breast just for more cheesiness (can't have too much cheese).  Wonderful - will make again.  (by the way, I highly recommend Maria's Stuffed Chicken Breasts too -completely different than these, but also glorious if you like stuffed breasts)

My husband has been craving the fancy chicken rollups he sees at BJs, but there are too many for a family of two. This was the perfect answer and he didn't even mind that the cheese poofed out the sides. A definite favorite.

Tried this recipe last night, and it was a big hit. I altered it abit, because Im a garlic nut. I added garlic powder to the bread crumb and parmasan mixture. I used Boursin garlic and herb cheese, and it tasted great.  Thanks Wendy

I made these for some out of town guests.  I thought I had made too much, but no- they ate every last bit!  My picky sister even loved them.  A tip for pounding the chicken breasts: I used a gallon ziplock bag, put the breast in there and pounded away with a meat cleaver- using the smooth side, not the bumpy side.  It worked great, and they were very thin.

Thanks for this great recipe, my boys (9&13) loved it and even asked for seconds, my husband liked it as well.
I did do a little variation though, I used 1 package of ceeam cheese added freshly cooked bacon(crumbled), shredded chedder cheese , garlic and onion powder. The filling stayed well in the bigger chicken rolls.  No leftovers here!!!

This chicken is yummy....Followed the recipe to the T and came out better than I was expecting.  Other reviews said that pounding the chicken was messy and a hassle??  Not my experience AT ALL!!!  I just wrapped in saran wrap and pounded away!!   Next time will make for a dinner party..It's that GOOD!!!

This was a big hit at a dinner party I had.  People LOVED it and several asked for the recipe.  I also could not find garlic, cheese spread so I substituted a pimento cheese spread that is very popular here in the south.  It was fabulous!

Made for my grandsons who are picky eaters but love fried chicken and cheese. These are easy to make -  a tad messy but easy. They inhaled them. I thought they came out good too but had problems keeping the cream cheese inside. It kind of spilled out during the baking process but still tasted great.

I didn’t make any real changes, but you can get away with using half of the cheese and bread crumb mixture. I had a lot leftover. I will make it again.

Was delicious! Husband, who is the cook in the family loved it and I made it lol. Does need a lot more butter to dip in before bread crumbs, I also added salt and pepper inside the chicken before rolling with the cheese. I used the laughing cow creamy Swiss garlic & herb wedges, however I think next time I will make my own with cream cheese. I thought it needed more salt but I’m also a salt addict so… Overall it was a wonderful dish and I will be making it again!

I used crushed Ritz crackers and a spinach artichoke dip that was leftover from a party. Wow was it good!

Tasty chicken breast dish.  I used the remaining breadcrumb/cheese mixture and sprinkled it all over the chicken before cooking.  I also added a little rosemary and thyme into the mix.  
Cooking time was approx. 45 minutes
Delicious!

In Mexico so used cream cheese, fresh chives, fine chopped red onion, crushed fresh garlic and McCormick Chipotle Garlic Seasoning.
Added crushed chichorones (pork skins) to breading for crispness. 
After spreading mixture on chicken and rolling up, I refrigerated them to make easier to dip in butter and roll in breading.  Excellent!

Very good. My mistake was using shredded instead of grated Parm. Served with some couscous and sautéed asparagus. Leftovers were just as good the next day. Will definitely be making this again.

This was great, my family loved it.
I made no changes to the recipe, I wanted to make it as is, and come up with my own conclusions.
I will not make this again, only because I am a cook it and move on to the next experience type of guy.
But I will definitely keep the recipe, and consider it in the future.

It's a keeper!

Phenomenal! I made this for Christmas dinner and it was delicious. Took a reviewer's suggestion and marinated the chicken in the Kraft Zesty Dressing for about 2-3 hrs before. I used the Phildelphia whipped chive cream cheese for easier spreading and a mixture of Italian bread crumbs and panko to get a nice crunch on the chicken. I kept it in the oven for about 40-45min and it was great!

I couldn't find the garlic cheese spread at the store so I used chive and onion cream cheese and brought in the garlic flavor by using garlic flavored bread crumbs for the chicken.  It was delicious, and so easy to make!  Next time I'm thinking I may add in some peppers to the cream cheese to give it a kick, although it was perfectly delicious on its own.  I will definitely be using this recipe again!

This dish is so easy to make.  The only thing I changed was instead of using garlic cream cheese I used bacon cream cheese and it was delicious.  My brother in law who doesn't care for chicken had two helpings of it.  To me that's a success.

Lots of flavor!  I used many of the suggestions made by others.  I marinated the chicken breasts in Zesty Italian Dressing for a few hours before preparation.  I found a cheese spread by Alouette called Garlic and Herbs.  I also used an Italian seasoned bread crumb mixture with the parmesan.  Prior to putting the mix in the oven, I topped each breast with marinara.  I baked the chicken for around 30 minutes, then added a thin sprinkling of mozzarella cheese.  I baked for an additional 10 minutes.  Very tender and very tasty.

This one was a winner. It was flavorful and juicy. I used Progresso Italian bread crumbs, & garlic and herb spreadable cheese, as could not find garlic spread. I also seasoned chicken breasts with garlic powder & dash of seasoned salt. Will definitely be making this one again!

YUM! Didn't have the spread so made my own with cream cheese, butter, onion powder, and garlic powder. I did marinate the chicken in Italian Dressing for half an hour after I pounded it out. Delicious, different, nice presentation; a real keeper!

Yummy! I had about twice as much breadcrumbs as I needed, but other than that thought the recipe was spot on. I had a tub of Rondele Garlic & Herb cheese spread my hubby had bought and I had no idea what to do with it, until I found this. I seasoned some plain breadcrumbs with a few shakes of garlic powder, Tastefully Simple's Onion Onion, some roasted garlic seasoning and black pepper and everything came out great. We all really enjoyed it!

I had high hopes for this recipe.. but it was not as full of flavor as I had hoped, but they looked delicious! I think it has potential though.. maybe with a stronger cheese, and I think I might try soaking the chicken in salt water.. to add a little something to the chicken. Also, I think I'm going to do egg and parm/breadcrumb mix (more like a batter) instead of the butter bc it took a lot of manuvering to get the crumb mix to stick for me. Thanks for the inspiration anyways!!

These are delicious!  I made exactly has written except that I didn't have whole chicken breasts, only chicken tenders so I used them instead (I didn't use toothpicks) but cooked for the same amount of time as it called for.  I made the Garlic Spread recipe from AR for the filling since I couldn't find it at the store.  That is yummy too!  Both recipes are so easy to make and I will definitely be making them again.

I made these last week for my family.Like many others, I made my own filling: cream cheese, garlic salt, pepper & creole seasoning. They were fabulous.I can't wait to serve them for guests. This is an awesome recipe that can be altered every time with a new creative filling

This tasted quite good. I did overcook it because I like my cheese to be slightly charred. I also added a bit more cheese on top at the end for an added effect. I followed the recipe exactly and loved it. However, I felt like the parts of the chicken that didn't get the breadcrumb or the cheese were a bit lacking. This is where pre-marinating post-pounding makes the difference. I'm still experimenting, but I feel that marinating the chicken after you get it pounded makes the difference. Also, consider this: pouring some Marsala wine around it while baking...maybe some pasta sauce on top after browned...nom nom nom. Great start to many possibilities...

Yum, we loved this! It was quite easy and the chicken was very juicy. I made my own cream cheese spread based on ideas from the other reviewers, and next time will, most likely, add more herbs to the cream cheese. (I tried it with 1TBL fresh chopped onion, 4tsp diced garlic, and parsley and chive). All in all, a delicious and easy dish!

These were great! What really makes or breaks the recipe is the type of garlic & herb cream cheese.  I used Boursin, but think I will do a homemade version the next time around.  I also marinated the chicken overnight in balsamic vinaigrette dressing.  The combo of the cheese & marinade smelled lovely while preparing although there was too much flavor mixing together while consuming.  I will definitely make again without the marinade.  I recommend checking the chicken after 25-30 minutes.  Mine was a tad dry and I removed from oven after 35 minutes.

This was very good. I also made my own cheese sauce. Instead of using bread crumbs I used unseasoned stuffing and put into the food processor with a liberal amount of poultry seasoning. It turned out quite good. The only thing I would change is to use egg instead of butter to coat the chicken; the boating didn't stick well with the butter and had to be redone after they were rolled.

Great.  I used Purdue Chicken breast, the ones that come in individual packages.  There was an italian dressing which was already marinated on them.  I didn't use the butter. I also added chedder cheese in the last 10 mins.

These were pretty darn good!! I made them a few nights ago for dinner & they were yummy!! A little work but nothing too hard. I didn't have any garlic cheese spread so as other reviewers suggested I made my own. I didn't feel I needed the whole 8oz thing of cream cheese that was WAY too much! So I used half of that & mixed in lots of fresh garlic & threw in whatever spices I had on hand & felt like using...no need to measure. The mixture was the perfect amount & I'm glad I didn't use the whole tub of cream cheese cause it would have been a waste!

I didn't have any garlic cheese spread so I used onion/chive cream cheese and added some minced garlic.  I figured trying to roll up the chicken breast after breading was going to be pretty difficult and messy, so I pounded the breast thin, dipped it in melted butter and breaded it on one side and put it on a wire rack over a cookie sheet.  Then I spread the cream cheese mixture on the unbreaded side and covered the cheese with the remaining bread crumb mixure then drizzled with the remaining melted butter and baked as directed.  It was awesome!

This was fantastic. I used "Garlic Spread" to replace the garlic cheese spread. Next time, I would like to use freshly dried bread crumbs.

This recipe is yummy!!! My sister in law loved it so much, she's requested it again...and again. I used herb and garlic cream cheese in the centre. Melted some extra butter and cream cheese and poured it on top right before it went in the oven -- added a little something to it.

This recipe was very tasty!  My husband went back for seconds.  Next time, though, I'll reduce the amount of breadcrumbs and parmesan.  I ended up with a whole plateful of wasted breading.

Super easy and went over well with my guests. I didn't even bother with the butter. Used a pre-made mozzerella-garlic mix. My household is gluten free so in lieu of bread crumbs I used crushed corn chex and seasoned with italian seasoning and seasoned salt. Great!

This recipe was amazing! I did the same as others recommended & made my own cheese spread. I used Philadelphia cream cheese & added garlic to it. It turned out incredible and I will definitely make this a weekly recipe in my house!

These were just okay. I love the sound of all the ingredients and the reviews were so positive, maybe I was just expecting more? I made it once and never again, it didn't get any negative criticism, but was never requested again.

I thought this recipe was fantastic!  I didn't feel like grating any of my romano so I omitted the cheese, and added a bit of additional seasoning (oregano, salt, pepper, paprika, more garlic) to my seasoned breadcrumbs.  I used the Rondele cheese and mixed the leftover cheese in with some mashed potatoes for an excellent side dish.  Thanks for the great idea!

My niece said this was the best chicken she has ever had.  It was very tender and easy to make.

this was very good, made it for my parents and they both enjoyed it very much.  I added some bacon to the inside and I used a garlic and herb cream cheese as that is what I had on hand.  I melted the butter in the same fry pan that I cooked up the bacon and just dipped the chicken in the fry pan rather then dirty another dish.  It gave an extra taste to it which we all liked, will make this again

This was delicious! I used half of each breast and made my own cream cheese mixture. With garlic, parsley, pepper, onion salt. Other than that, I did everything it said. It was yummy, thanks!

Both my husband and son loved this dish. I had Laughing Cow light garlic and herb cheese that I used and it was DELISH!!! I didn't have any chicken breasts so I pounded out some chicken tenders. These were perfect bite size pieces.

This is now my personal favorite way to make chicken! I don't think my boyfriend liked it as much as I did, but he still liked it okay. I didn't get the cheese spread, so I just added some minced garlic to some leftover cream cheese, as well as added some mozzarella cheese to kind of mask the cream cheese flavor (as my boyfriend doesn't like cream cheese) and it came out great! I loved it and definitely will be making this again.

I made this twice already :)  The first time I used cream cheese with green onion and garlic and the second time was even better because I used tomato basil garlic cream cheese and to the bread crumb mixture I added Mrs. Dash tomato basil garlic.  It was sooo good!!

This was very easy to make, and very tasty.  Even my picky 2 yr old and 5 yr old ate it up!  The only cheese I could find was the Philly Cracker Spreads.  It worked wonderful and will be trying the different varieties next time.

This is an outstanding chicken recipe. I used thighs rather than breasts as we simply prefer thighs. I followed what others have said and marinated the chicken. (1hr). The marinade consisted of no-fat Italian salad dressing, the juice from half a lemon and three smashed up garlic cloves.  With the other half of lemon, I put a few splashes of juice into the melted butter and then a few more splashes over everything just before putting the dish in the oven. Wow.  We will be making this dish again and again.

Delicious and such an easy meal. I use the lower fat Rondele brand Garlic and Herb cheese, and dip breasts in egg instead of butter. This is such an easy recipe to add/delete ingredients. I've tried numerous changes like adding spinach, finishing off with marinara, and adding bacon. Can't go wrong with this one!

Recipe went over very well with the family.  I took a couple of liberties and dipped both sides in the butter and pressed cheese mixture down the entire center of the breast before rolling.  Great, quick recipe!

Great recipe and very easy to do. I did take a shortcut and used thinly sliced chicken breast rather than buying fully-sized ones and pounding them down. This did make for smaller portion sizes however.

I am a terrible cook.  My husband agrees.  I still try though.  I made these, and even he loved them.  I used Laughing Cow garlic and herb cheese.  I wish I would have used 1 and 1/2 triangles instead of one.  I smashed the chicken breasts by putting them in a large freezer zip lock bag and hitting them with a rolling pin.  Much easier than I thought.  I was very proud.

This recipe is amazing!  Of course I had to use cream cheese and add garlic powder and onion powder, but it was easy to make and my whole family loved it!  My 3 and 8 year old fininshed a whole chicken breast before my husband and I got half way through!  My kids ask for this at least once a week!  WONDERFUL

This recipe is great but it's even better if you add the cream cheese all across the inside of the checked instead of just the ends.

This was a very tasty dish and pretty easy to make.  I used cream cheese mixed with garlic as I did not have the cheese mix recommended within the recipe.  I would have rated this a 5, but didn't enjoy the cream cheese filling.  Will keep the recipe but substitute another cheese next time.  Served this covered with the Chunky Marinara Sauce found elsewhere on this site and the combination was very filling.

Like many others, I didn't have garlic spread on hand, so I made my own using a variety of suggestions from others. Since we love garlic, I added more for the filling, plus some garlic powder. This was absolutely delicious! The leftovers were gone too soon, so we will make this again! Thanks for a great recipe

Words can't describe how good this is! No changes except I couldn't find the garlic spread so I made my own of whipped cream cheese, garlic powder and a vegetable seasoning blend that I had on hand. Very yummy.

I halved the bread crumb/cheese mixture and it was still more than enough. I used thin sliced chicken breast to save time, but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  My husband really liked it, and I'll make this again.

Made these exactly according to directions and they were great. Even my choosy husband loved them. I used Allote garlic and herb cheese, soo good. I think I am going to try it with the spinach and artichoke cheese next. Thanks for another easy quick way for this working mom to put a good meal on the table

I made this with Unseasoned Panko, that I seasoned myself with some poultry seasoning from a grinder and some Montreal Chicken seasoning. I used boursin and added a piece of leftover bacon to the roll-up. YUMMMMMM....I thought it might need a "dip" but once I tasted it, I realized it was just perfect the way it is!!!

Holy toledo! My husband says this is better than good -- a keeper for sure. I stuck with the recipe as written (just doubled it), & it was terrific. Best new chicken recipe I've tried in as long as I can remember.

Pretty good. Mixed up the filling with some onion/chive cream cheese, regular cream cheese, garlic powder, minced garlic and chopped green onions.

Great recipe, my husband really enjoyed this one. I used Laughing Cow Garlic & Herb cheese spread, less fat. I used one wedge per roll. I think that next time and there will be a next time, I will use 1 1/2 to 2 per roll. My husband also requested that I double bread the rolls. After I rolled them, I secured them with trussing needles (the ones you use for stuffed turkey) they worked great. I then coated them with egg/milk wash, breaded them and repeated the egg and bread crumbs. I sprayed the tops with butter flavored cooking spray and baked. I may try to make some sort of light flavored sauce to top the rolls. These will be made again. Thank you

super tasty.  followed directions precisely and only added the proscuitto as suggested by other reviews.  i also used "goldy's" brand cheese (in deli section) - it was smoked mozarella w/sun dried tomatoes.  the best part of this recipe is how easy and quick it is to make!

Really good.  I didn't have toothpicks so i did it without and while it tasted good it was messy.  SO, when i make this again i'll make sure to follow the recipe a little closer, ha-ha.

This was Awsome. My young boys could not get enough and the wife went back for more. I ended up using some cream cheese with garlic salt and oregano instead of the cheese sauce. But I did have trouble with the pounnding the chicken flat, so next time I will just cut pockets into the chicken. Definitely a do agin.....

Fantastic.  I subbed aabout a 1.5 oz chunk of cream cheese and a piece of cooked bacon (cut into thirds) as the core of this. I found I could get by with just over half the volume of bread crumbs. Also, I needed to bake a little longer (about 45 min at 350). I was the hero of lunch today with this recipe!  We'll definitely make it again.

Oh...this was good!  I used Mrs. Cubbisons stuffing mix for the breading.  I wasn't able to find the cream cheese stuff at the store, so I just used cream cheese with about 1 tsp of garlic powder in it.  Delicious!!!!

I wish there were half stars in the rating system...these deserve a 3 1/2 star rating. These were alright, but a little too rich and a little too strong in flavor (and I only used half as much cheese spread as suggested). If I make these again, I will definitely follow other reviewers suggestions and make my own cheese spread.

I have never reviewed any of the fabulous dishes I've gotten on here but this one was FANTASTIC!!!  As the mom of an infant I'm ALWAYS searching for an easy dish, just as much as my husband is looking for, what he calls, a "pre-baby gourmet meal"!  This one was it!!    I agree with a recent reviewer about the breadcrumb mixture being too much.  I had hoped to put extra in a sealed bag for another time, but forgot to separate before I pressed buttered chicken...note to self...halve next time or divide in half first.  I'm the type of cook who improvises all the time, but when making these recipes for the first time I cook according to directions. I served with whole wheat parmesan couscous and steamed asparagus.  Here are some thoughts:  To save time, I used already thinly sliced breasts that I found on sale.  would like to add lobster meat OR baby spinach with the cheese mixture & see how it fairs, as well as concocting my own cheese mixture.    This is a perfect EASY dish for company, last minute guests, a romantic evening, so versatile!

This recipe is great!  I used the Tyson thin chicken breasts and then I didn't have to pound it out.  It saved a lot of time.  I also tried it with the Philadelphia Garlic and Herb, as well as the Philadelphia Jalapeno and Pepper Jack spread.  They were both great and we will definitely make them again!

I can't believe how easy this recipe was!  When I was baking it my company was so hungry, cause it smelled so delicous.  I layed it on a bed of parmasen Couscous and paired it with a side of parmasen green beans.

Delicious! Thanks for the idea =) ..& here I go with my annoying list of "changes" lol ..but that's the fun of cooking! ..right?  Started with thin cut breasts. Used Philadelphia Chive & Onion Cream Cheese mixed in my processer with lots of fresh garlic, Shredded mozz, grated parm, a little sour cream, crumbled bacon and fresh ground pepper. Dipped my breast 1st in butter and roasted garlic olive oil then in italian bread crumbs and more parm. Served with buttered corn and Stove Top Stuffing. Very rich but soooo yummy!!

Wonderful and easy!  Next time I will use more than a "dollop" of the cheese spread and maybe chop some fresh cilantro to put in the middle also.  Instead of grated parm cheese, I used freshly shredded cheese.  I like the flavor from the fresh cheese.  I also dipped the chicken in beaten eggs instead of butter.

Awesome flavor!  I would not say it is a quick and easy recipe though.  But for me anything that is coated takes longer.  I didn't have the bread crumbs so I ended up using cheddar flip side crackers.  The only garlic cheese spread that I could find was Alouette which is always yummy.  I was actually looking for a cheddar garlic log (roll).  Maybe I will try that next time.  Anyway try it, it is awesome!  Oh yeah, my cheese ran out too, but it was still great.

I hate to say this, cause I think this could be a good recipe, but I was surprised that it wasn't spectacular..b/c of the reviews.  I would suggest not using a whole container of cheese, it was just too much.  Also, like another person recommended, I would bake it with marinara sauce over top.  I also feel like it needed something else, I just don't know what.  Again, not bad, but not out of this world.  Regardless, thank you for sharing!

I made this recipe for friends and it was an instant hit! I used the chive cream cheese and just added my own garlic. After I stuffed the chicken, I rolled the whole breast in egg and then covered in bread crumbs, worked great.

The only reason this did not get 5 stars was that the filling ran out even though I was careful to fold and usse a toothpick.  Can anyone think of something to do to keep the filling in the chicken otherwise it was awesome!

This was very good! Of course I altered the recipe slightly - I used shake n bake and coated the whole chicken, and used the laughing cow light garlic and herb cheese, one wedge on each breast and rolled them up - drizzled one tablespoon butter over them (i only made 2 breasts since its just my husband, 4 yr old, and myself) and baked for 40 min at 375 - super easy and can be modified with a ton of different things! love it, will be a staple in our house!

Love this chicken! I added Italian seasoning, garlic powder, and minced garlic to the cream cheese and I didn't even need toothpicks to secure the chicken. It came out great and everyone loved it.

This was really good. And easy. Anyone can do this and it will turn out just fine. I seasoned my bread crumbs with a cajun spice and minced a little jalapeno into the roll up :) It was great. Thanks.

i have been looking for more ways to cook the same boring chicken that we always end up eating, and this one did the trick. my husband loved this recipe. i used the garlic cream cheese and it was wonderful. even if you dont like cream cheese i would reccomend trying it, my husband does not like cream cheese. i told him it was a "cheese spread" after he demended to know what was in the middle of the chicken, and he still does not know that it was cream cheese.

These were really good.  I used Garlic & Herb cream cheese - and it turned out so scruptious.  It was very fancy looking, without all the effort that goes along with it too.  Thank you for the great recipe.  I will be making it again.

I really like this recipe. I used Borsin Garlic Cheese and it came out great. My husband who is a chef said that he wouldn't change a thing. Next time I will buy the thinly sliced chicken breasts. Thanks for sharing!

I can't believe how fast my family ate this. I definitely would make my own garlic cheese spread for the inside next time, it's just cream cheese and garlic. This is the best recipe I've gotten off this site so far.

Very great. Instead of rolling in, I stuffed the chicken breast with the cream cheese filling, and used the tooth picks to hold it together, then butter, and bread crumbs. Bake about 35 mins. EXCELLENT. For the filling I used the Phill Parmagan, garlic and head cracker spread. Very moist and tastful chicken.

I followed the instructions and just used a garlic Parmesan cracker spread for the filling. I also put a slice of mozzarella on top with about 10mins left to cook. I made these for my boyfriend (I'm vegetarian) and he loved them. They'll be in the regular rotation from now on.

Pretty good! I was being lazy and just made a garlic spread spooned it on top of the chicken breast and mixed together some parm and bread crumbs. I sprinkled the parm mixture over the chicken and garlic spread threw it in the oven for about an hour, and they were great. Coulda been better and juicier, but I didn't feel like pounding them out.

LOVED IT!! This recipe was sooo easy and my family loved it along with a few co-workers.  I couldn't find garlic cheese spread so I used plain ol' cream cheese that I added garlic powder to until I liked the taste. Fantastic!! Fast and easy a new family favorite!

I made this for dinner tonight and I used the Laughing Cow cheese.  It held up very nicely inside each chicken breast.  I place one triangle in each.  There was no problem with the cheese oozing out.

I would actually give this 4 1/2 stars. The chicken was very moist and had plenty of flavor. I used Rondele Garlic & Herb spread in the cheese section near the deli counter. The breadcrumb/parmesan mixture made way too much - next time I would have that. I used freshly grated parmesan cheese which didn't stick too well to the chicken, so I would adjust that next time.  Other than that, it was delicious. My family ate it right up!

This was absolutely delicous. All the family loved it - my husband especially jsut ate it all up. I think the next time I make it, I could get away with putting a little more "stuffing" in it because some of it seeps out during cooking. I found the garlic cheese spread at Super Target by the deli case. I thought of doing a little romano and mozzerella too so that it "sticks" better and doesn't seep out. I figure if a little extra is put in, you are still left with enough in the middle maybe, right? I also topped with some sauce and mozzerella. Very good and we will make it again. Simple to prep too which is a plus!

This was really yummy! I did use less cheese than suggested. And if anyone is having problems finding the cheese - it is usually in the cheese case near the deli.

LOVED IT and so did my guests, but they are also not used to me cooking.  :)  When rolling the chicken I was concerned about the rolls being too big and not cooking thru in the time alloted; however, they did just fine.  I will make this again and my friend even wants the recipe.

This was a great/easy recipe. I actually would rate this a 4.5 star. I used Alloutte Garlic and Cheese Spread for the filling and it was easier than making your own spread. Not very complex, but the flavor is great and it is something new. I am going to try to make ahead and freeze these.

This meal was fabulous.  I would have rated it a five star recipe if it was more complex.  However, the great thing about this recipe is that is it simple and tastes fabulous.  Great job Wendy.

AWESOME!!! I followed some other review advise and rolled up chicken first, then added the bread crumbs. The reader that said she made a sauce from the left-over cream cheese was right on. There was way too much cream cheese for the chicken, but it was a great addition poured over  baked potatoes and broccoli...YUM!

chicken actually came out a little bland.. and a lot of the cheese mixture melted out. it seemed to keep the chicken breasts fairly moist though. i'll try this one again..

Made these tonight for dinner and they were a hit! I made my own garlic cheese spread by using cream cheese, fresh chives, garlic and onion powder as suggested by someone earlier. It was delicious! I aslo dipped the entire chicken breast into the melted butter and breaded both sides as my family likes the breading. I spread the mixture thinly along one whole side of the breast so it would have a little more of the filling and flavor. This recipe was easy and soooooooo good! This will be a keeper in my faminly! Thanks!

This was SOOO good! Followed anothers advice and made the garlic spread myself, no food processor tho so i used the blender and worked just fine.I had 4 breasts and on 2 of them i followed the recipe exactly, the other 2 i spread the cheese spread all over the other side of the breast instead of just putting a dollop and the ones with more cheese were definetly better.  Also added some grated mozzarella during the last 5 minutes of cooking and Yum!

One of the best "stuffed" chicken breast recipes I have found. You can use any type of similar spread. I butterflied the chicken breasts and it came out very flavorful and moist. So easy, too. Great recipe!

This was a pretty good dish.  I make another dish that's similar - breaded chicken breasts stuffed with goat cheese (chevre), and my husband said that he liked the flavor of this dish better, as it had a smoother flavor.  I used Boursin for the filling, and filleted the chicken breasts rather than pounding them thin, and this worked just fine.  My husband's first reaction was that it was "WAY rich," but the flavor grew on him and he requested that this recipe be in our permanent rotation and that I make it just like I did.

Amazing!  I made this for my roommate and myself (I'm an admittedly bad cook) and we both really loved the recipe. I used Garlic and herb trempherbe because it was the only cheese spread I could find at Whole Foods...it turned out deliciously! Yummy!

My husband loved this! I had to improvise, since I didn't have everything. I used melted garlic butter and crushed ritz crackers in place of the bread crumbs. I didn't have enough cheese spread, so I used mozzarella cheese. We're having it again tonight! Thanks!

Few ingredients, quick prep and tastes delicious...that definitely earns 5 stars in my book!  I even used about half the amount of breadcrumbs (to cut back on the carb count) and they were great.

YUMMY!!!  I will definately keep this recipe around.  I doubled the recipe and cooked for my sister and her family, and we ate them all up.  Even the kids cleaned their plates.  I used garlic cream cheese, and besides having to pound out the chicken, these were extremely easy.

I bought thin chicken fillets - so I didn't have to pound the breasts out, and I mixed cream cheese with minced garlic for the filling. It was really tasty, and amazingly easy! I will definitely make this again!

Grand idea! The only thing I did is flash brown them in olive oil prior to baking.
