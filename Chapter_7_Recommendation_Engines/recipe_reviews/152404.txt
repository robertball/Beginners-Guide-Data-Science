Thanks to everyone who has tried & reviewed the recipe!  After several years I gave up on the site publishing it.  I guess it takes 3-4 years after a recipe is submitted.  I have an updated version on my profile page called Big Bird Chili which uses ground turkey -- 3# instead of 2#, and I've increased the amount of jalapenos since the ones available now aren't as hot as they used to be.  One reviewer here used ground bison, and that would be excellent; I've used elk with fantastic results and any wild game would be superb as well.  PS I wasn't going to rate my own recipe but the site requires it so I did... I like my turkey version better & no longer buy commercially raised beef so I'll give myself 4 stars, OK? :)

This was very good.  Great combo of flavors.  I didn't add as many peppers and it did not have the kick my husband was looking for- (if it is too hot the kids won't eat it.) We added hot sauce and it was good.  I had to boil my beans about 40 minutes longer than stated but worth it. Used ground turkey too.

Makes for a hearty inexpensive meal.  Substituted ground bison for ground beef (only needed 1.5 lbs as there is very little fat in the meat).

Pretty good but it needed a little chili powder - and I added extra garlic.

So good! Had to leave out the jalapenos so substituted a green pepper and tomatoes w/adobo flavoring for 1/4 of the tomatoes. After taking out 2 quarts fot "the wimps," added 3 Tbsp Sriracha sauce to the rest! Yimmy, This will be my new "go to" recipe for chili. Thanx so much!
