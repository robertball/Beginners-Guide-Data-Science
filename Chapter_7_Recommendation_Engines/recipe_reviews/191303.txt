SUPERIOR recipe and soooo easy!  I didn't have chocolate wafer cookies, so I just got double-chocolate OREO cookies, twisted them apart, and dropped in the bottom of the liners.  PERFECT!  Some had cream and some did not.  Some got eaten!  LOL!  THIS IS A KEEPER++++!

This is a great recipe! I hate to admit it but I am one of those people that change recipes. I did not have chocolate wafer cookies that would fit in my muffin tins so I just crushed them and put the crumbs in the bottom of the cups. I also used chocolate cream cheese, which comes sweetened so I cut the sugar in half. I did not add the cocoa powder. And instead of melting the chips, I used them to decorate the tops with the remaining crumbs. These taste great and are easy to make.
