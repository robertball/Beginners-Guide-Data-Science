Delicious. I loved the addition of pineapple. I did cut the amount of pineapple because I only had an 8 oz can of chunks, I put the pineapple chunks into the food processor and pulsed it a few times since I didn't have the crushed. Also I didn't measure the walnuts out but I used about 1/2 cup chopped walnuts. Very tasty!

I made a few changes like adding the pineapple juice and leaving out the walnuts (allergies). We don't use alcohol, so the liqueurs were not added either. It was good but, the I will increase the sugars by half again each because the taste was a bit too tart. I'm keeping this recipe with my suggested changes.

Since I didn't have the Grand Marnier, I just used brandy, and it was a great addition to the flavor.  Another recipe I use calls for just a bit of ground cloves, so I added that to this one too.  It turned out great.

I've had better.  I like a higher cranberry to pineapple ratio.
