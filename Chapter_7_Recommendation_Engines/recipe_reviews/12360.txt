This pie crust turned out simply beautifully.  Light, flaky, delicious.

I cut up the fats into cubes and then tossed them in the flour and froze the entire thing for maximum coldness (and to make sure the fats were evenly distributed).  I also added the water one TBSP at a time, dribbling slowly and stopping the processor to mix after each.

I have a feeling pie crust can be very hard to work with, so I poured my mixture into a bowl and used saran wrap to bring the mixture into a ball (no bits escaped or stuck to my hands).

After colding it up for an hour,I put down wax paper on the table and covered the ball with waxed paper and pulled my rolling pin out of the fridge and had ZERO problems rolling out a nice, thin pie crust.  I think I would have had problems though w/o the wax paper, but it made it easy to roll w/o breaks, stuck bits and super easy to transfer to the pie pan.

When I made a lattice crust, I put the rolled out dough back in the fridge for an hour before cutting and it too came out amazing.

I made a pumpkin pie and and an apple pie w/ lattice crust (my first pie baking experience ever) and my guests seriously thought they were bakery purchased b/c they looked so professional and tasted like a dream.

This is a great, basic pie crust recipe.  I found it was a good combination of taste and flakiness, and it held up well.  Even when I don't have time to chill the dough, it is relatively easy to roll (although chilling helps!).  I usually just use butter out of the fridge (already hard) but freeze my shortening for an hour.  If I can see flecks of shortening and butter when I roll out the dough, I know that it is perfect.

Finally I got a flaky pie crust! Followed the recipe almost to the letter. I put the flour, salt, and cubed fats into a bowl and put it in the freezer for a couple of hours while I took care of other stuff. When it came out of the food Processor, I put into a bowl lined with plastic wrap (idea from another reviewer, thanks!) and formed it into a ball and into the fridge for about an hour. Rolled it out between two sheets of wax paper. Easiest pie crust I've worked with but you need to keep it very cold. **UPDATE** I made this pie crust again today but didn't bake it. I just put the flour, salt, and fats into a zip lock bag and put several into the freezer. This being the beginning of the "pie" season, all I have to do now is get the frozen ingredients out of the freezer and throw it into the food processor! Almost an "instant" pie crust! Just can't say enough good things about this recipe!

Not my favorite pie crust by any means.  Part of the problem may be that it's often difficult to teach an old dog (at least THIS old dog) new tricks - I'm much more comfortable making a pie crust by hand - after 8 gazillion pie crusts you get the "feel" of them.  The crust seemed a little heavy on the fat, so while it did LOOK nice, it was neither as tender nor as flaky as it should have been.

I've always had bad luck with pie crust, I think you have to make them all the time to have "the touch". Anyway, this crust wasn't any harder to work with than the all Crisco one I grew up making, and the flavor added by the butter is really nice.

This crust is great!  It's super easy.  This was the first pie crust I made and it turned out perfectly!  Just make sure to watch the water (I didn't use the whole 3 Tb.) and work quickly.

Wow, don't know what I did wrong, but this pie crust just fell apart and was a total disaster.  I finally was able to fit the bottom crust in the pie pan, then filled it with the sliced peaches, then was able to put the top crust on (with many patches).  I was so focused on trying to make the pie crust work that I realized afterwards that I forgot to add the dry ingredients to the peaches (flour, sugar, cinnamon, etc. sitting in a bowl).  Well, I decided to bake it anyway.  It was horrible.  I think I just should have stayed out of the kitchen yesterday.

Thank-you Charlotte. This recipe is the perfect balance of flavor and flakiness. If you are having any problems with making it, it's not the recipe. Crusts are often notorious for being touchy. So many variables can affect it, but once you've mastered it- it's all down hill.  Everything is written here that you need to know in making this successful. For rolling out: I always use two pieces of wax paper. I doubled the recipe for two crusts and still came out perfect. However, my food processor was very full.  My crust search stops here. I liked the ease of using the food processor too.

This is the only way I make pie crusts. (BTW, I live in Spain and you cannot buy ready made pie crusts in the supermarket.)I never make a single recipe though. If you're going to make a mess, you might as well make it count...double or triple, wrap in plastic wrap and put in the freezer or fridge until you're ready to use. Thanks for a wonderful recipe! Love it.

Throw away your pastry blenders!  This is the best and easiest way to make pie crust.  I made 3 crusts yesterday for Turkey Day pies, chilled them overnight and rolled them this morning.  They rolled out perfectly and they browned evenly when they were baked.  As for the "water" directions, be careful and add only as much as directed in the recipe.  I opened the top of my food processor and pinched the dough to see if it held together before turning it out into a bowl.

Finally a successful, flaky crust!  My search is over.  This will be my 'go to' crust recipe.  Believe me I've tried A LOT of crust recipes.  I used pastry flour instead of all purpose flour, otherwise I followed the recipe as written.  I always roll my crusts between plastic wrap (I sometimes lay a couple of pieces together to get the size circle I want, so none of the crust touches any surface it might possibly stick to, and do the same on the top before beginning to roll), and not use wax paper, which tends to stick to the crust for me.  Take the plastic wrap off the top of the crust when finished rolling, put your pie plate on top of the crust and invert the crust into the pan.  Remove the final piece of plastic wrap once crust is in the pie pan.  Clean up is a breeze and you've never touched the crust.  This is recipe is great for a savory pie. I will probably add a small amount of sugar to the crust when making a fruit pie.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!!!!!!

Used the food processor to cut the fat into the flour, but transferred to a mixing bowl to add water. Have made this twice now and each time have need about 5 tablespoons of water before dough would hold together. Could have been my humidity, though. Much easier than using a pastry blender or two forks.

Like some things are priceless, this pie dough recipe is starless. There aren't enough stars to give it.  It is the best dough I've ever made! It is easy to work with and does not need to be chilled. I like a lttle more salt in my dough, and I like the combination of butter and shortening. This is better than the Barefoot Contessa's, which is a little too short for me. I love the speed of using the food processor. I'm afraid to double the recipe, but I will try that soon. Thank you so much Charlotte. This will be my pie dough recipe from now on.

I followed this recipe to letter trying to use my food processor to make pie crust.  I have never had so much trouble with pie crust in my life!  I left the dough in the refrigerator for hours trying to get it firm enough to roll out, but I ended up just piecing it together in the pie plate.  I even made i a second time thinking maybe more shortening and less butter would help, but it didn't.  I'm giving it 3 stars because it did taste good, but I'd give it 1 for the difficulty I had!

This was an "ok" recipe. Easy because it is made in the food processor but I found it kind of crumbly to roll out. Also...it only makes a single crust. Wish this was specified on the recipe itself!

This is it.  If you are frustrated by inconsistent pie crust results, here's the recipe to use.  Do make sure you freeze the "fat" and process as little as possible.  The result is a well marbled crust that flakes up perfectly.  Again, don't over process (the fat and flour should not be blended) or add too much water (stop while it still looks dry). Other than that, this is a fool proof way to make a perfect pie crust.

This is a great recipe. I substituted margarine for the shortening, and it turned out great.

Also, I couldn't tell what size of pie plate the recipe was for, but I assumed it was for a 9" crust. I needed TWO 9" deep dish crusts, so I changed the servings size from "8" to "20" and it came out PERFECT. In order to get extra crust to roll for the edges you will have to roll the crust out pretty thin. If you want extra for the edges with a thicker crust then I would suggest increasing the serving size to 22 or maybe 24.

Today I was making an apple pie. For some reason the crust I made did not turn out, so I was in a rush to make a quick crust. I decided on this one. I was expecting an okay crust but nothing special, this was perfect! I added some sugar in with the flour to make it sweet but that was all. I didn't have time to chill it. It baked up just fine without doing that step. Thanks for this recipe. I will be coming back to this one.

Great recipe, I have never made pie crust before.  It took me a couple tries to get the idea of pulsing to get crumbly but not too wet on the dough.  After I got that figured out, I am really happy with how flaky the crust is!!

Wow!! This recipe was really easy. I had not made pie crust in over 20 years. It turned out perfect and no mess. I put the processor bowl and blade in the fridge and all the ingredients in the freezer. I also replaced part of the water in one tablespoon for distilled vinegar.

Using plastic film to roll out the pie crust is the single best cooking tip I have ever learned.  I was dreading making pie crust all week till I came across this tip.  It works perfect and makes getting the crust to the pie pan simple.

This is the best pie crust ever! My family loves it and it's so easy. I've made it about a dozen times now and think I'll continue to do so as long as I've got a food processor around.

Before trying this recipe I had given up on making a home made pie crust! I recently purchased a food processor so I decided to search for a recipe & make a crust from scratch. This recipe is wonderful! Between this recipe & my new food processor, I made the best, flakies pie crust I had ever made. This crust was for a quiche recipe, but I can't wait to make in again for a dessert. I will never purchase the store bought crusts again. My husband loved the crust, too. He said it melted in his mouth. I highly recomment this recipe!

I made this pie crust today for the first time, and it was amazing...one of the flakiest I've ever made. I skipped the food processor altogether, just to make sure I didn't overwork the dough. I also added a smidgen of sugar, since I like mine slightly sweet. I used this for a prebaked pie shell for a chocolate cream pie and the crust was the best part. I'd definitely try this one out!

I use a stick of butter instead of shortening and this turns out perfectly.  It's easy to work with and almost impossible to mess up!  Viva la food processor!

Soooo easy and the taste was amazing! I rolled it out between waxed paper. Next time I think I should flour the waxed paper- I had a little trouble transferring it to the pie pan and it tore a bit, but nothing that wasn't fixable. I think I would get better with a little more practice. I might try adding a tiny bit more water next time to see if it would make the baked pie crust a little less crumbly, but it really didn't matter this time since I was making a single crust French Silk pie. Overall a great recipe!

I made this today and it's the best pie crust I've ever made. I followed the recipe exactly except I doubled it and mixed 2 crust at once in the food processor. I dumped my crumbly dough from the food processor into a large ziploc bag and then formed it into a ball, then chilled in the fridge. I divided it half rolled it out between 2 sheets of wax paper for 2 crust. Very flaky crust.

This recipe makes a perfect pie crust.  In addition, it was fast and easy.  I didn't use cold shortening, but did use cold water and butter and it came out perfect.  Thanks for sharing, I'll be using this recipe often!

Fantastic pie crust! It is so flaky and buttery (of course because I substituted butter for shortening).  Made a double crusted apple pie and it came out perfectly.  Thank you, Charlotte!  This is the crust I'll be using from now on!

There's way too much fat in this recipe, resulting in a too soft dough that doesn't roll out well.

Flavor was good, and crust was indeed flaky.  I liked the detailed food processor instructions, but found that I should have gone a little past the "noticeably crumbly" stage and added more water, as the dough seemed a little dry to me.  I will try this recipe again, and take my chances by processing a little longer and with more water than I used this time.

I made this a second time, and it worked great.  Used all butter for a quiche.  Pastry pulled right off the board with no sticking.  I was very happy!  Will use this recipe every time I make pies.

This is the first pie crust I've made from scratch.  It was so easy I think I will never buy a store bought one again.  It was so easy to make.  I only used half of the water.  I was amazed with how easy it was to handle.  I had no problem rolling it out and I even made the top into a lattice.  The best part, it tasted soooooooo good.  I'm normally not a fan of a pie crust and would often eat the filling and leave the crust behind.  Not anymore.

I was extremely apprhensive about this recipe because it was my first time making a pie crust. I have yet to taste it, but it looks wonderful and is very flaky. I baked @ 450 covered with foil for 8 minutes, and an additional 5 without the foil. I'm afraid to try any other recipes because they may fail, but this is always a fall-back option.

I have tried this recipe twice.  It's the first time I've ever made pie dough in a food processor.  I have to say, the crust comes out really flaky, but it is really really easy to overprocess, because the recipe says "with motor running.. add the water."  I think this should be changed to "pulse only".  Then it would be perfect!  I also think the amount of water is not quite enough- I ended up adding 5 tablespoons.

I had never made a homemade pie crust before this Thanksgiving.  Asking for help and suggestions on thebuzz, Deb C. recommended this recipe.  I made it as written and according to my family, it was "awesome".  It was very simple to make, and it rolled out very nicely.  My SIL who makes crusts was very impressed and said "it isn't at all tough".  Not sure what a tough crust is as I don't eat the crust, but everyone ate it all.  I used this to make my great-grandma's pumpkin pie recipe and a pecan pie. On day two of the pie my husband commented that the crust was still really good.  As easy as this was to make, I know I will be using this crust again.  Thanks, Deb for your suggestion.  This recipe is a keeper.

Flaky, yes, flavorful, not so much. I've been making pies for years, but cutting the butter in by hand when making multiple pastries is getting harder for my wrist. In this recipe I love that the food processor does the work. I will try this food processor procedure again using my own favorite all-butter recipe and see how it turns out.

Turned out wonderfully even thought I initially thought I had added too much water.  So much easier and faster than doing it with a pastry cutter!  I will definitely be using this recipe again.  Note: This recipe is for a single crust pie.

This is a great recipe. I was looking for a pie crust recipe, mine was lost, so I thought I would try this. I'm used to making pie crust the old fashioned way, this is so much quicker and easier. You have to be careful with the amount of water you add, a little goes a long ways. After mixing I put it in the fridge, along with the rolling pin. To roll this out, you need to sandwich it between 2 layers of waxed paper. I doubled this and it made enough to make a large deep dish pie. The pie crust was tender, flaky, and had a nice flavour. I'll never make pie crust any other way again.

After reading all the reviews and watching videos, I was always afraid of making pastry until I found this recipe which I followed to a "T".  The pastry turned out perfect and flaky and the family loved it for my strawberry pie.  Definitely a keeper and now I look forward to all the recipes calling for pastry!

The crust flavor was very good but the edges of the crust kept separating while I was roling it out. Can't figure out what I was doing wrong. Made a fresh  from our garden raspberry pie that was great. I'll try again.

Wow!  This was super easy to make and a perfect basic pie crust for my chicken pot pie.  I made this with butter and it still came out beautifully flaky and flavorful.  I plan to add just a bit of sugar to the recipe and whip up a cherry pie tonight.  A simpler and better tasting recipe won't be found!

This is the easiest pie crust and everyone thinks I am a pro at it. I make an old fashioned version just by adding 2 tablespoons of sugar which helps make the crust more flaky. You must give this recipe a try! I would rate this 10 stars if I could. Thanks a million!

This was very easy and perfect.  I didn't use cold shortening but I did use cold butter and ice water and it still turned out perfectly.  It was very fast to make and I will definitely never buy pie crust at the store again.  I used this crust for a Strawberry Rubarb pie and used a lattice cutter on the top and it was VERY yummy!

Jenn, thanks so much for clearing something up for me!  I have been making pie crust in the food processor for a couple of years, but it was always tough, never flaky because of the amount of water it took to form the ball while in the processor.  Your advice is better than Martha's and the barefoot lady!  My crust was flaky!!!  A little hard to work with, but definitely flaky! :)

This was the easiest and best pie crust I have ever made!  I added an extra tablespoon of water while in the processor and then wrapped it up and put it in the fridge.  When I brought it out to roll it was definately too dry but I was still able to add a couple of extra tablespoons of ice cold water to make it just perfect.  I thought I was going to overwork it but it was still really flaky and light.

I was able to make this work actually pretty well, for both my pumpkin and apple pie, this year at Thanksgiving!  I would maybe use a spice for flavoring next time though.

Depending on the weather and how dry the area you live in you may need to adjust either the amount of flour or water. I live in Arizona and it is very dry here so I use a little less flour and about 1/2 tablespoon more water.

I was disappointed in the results with this recipe. I followed recipe exactly but the pastry would not stay together when rolling and never became the crisp tender crust I was expecting.

The pie crust was falling apart even after chilling, but dillagence with forming a ball and rolling paid off. I suggest that when putting the dough in the shell that leaving a little extra at the top because it does shrink a little when cooking. However a little work pays off with an amazing crust!

I tried it with whole grain flour... Might not have been the best idea.  It fell apart while rolling it out, and I imagine the wheat bran interfered with some necessary chemistry going on in the white flour.  Very fun to make in your food processor!  My 4 month old was well entertained :)

I have been using this recipe for years and always get compliments on my pies.  I vary the proportion of butter to crisco based on what I have on hand, and it doesn't matter - the result is always excellent!

used all butter - used to make my 1st 2 pumpkin pies ever - thanks to the Lighter Libby Pumpkin Pie recipe here on the site - ended up freezing the butter & added 5 tablespoons of cold water rather than 3 - ended up with large crumbs - poured out onto table- pressed into dough ball with my hands - back into fridge for 3 hours until I could use it - rolled out beautifully - filled with light pumpkin pie filling and baked both - baked too long due to cracks on top but taste was awesome! flaky! buttery! utterly sinful - not good for you but can't beat the taste - cooled both pies & froze 1 for Christmas - other pie was gone in 2 days thanks to our 6-year-old who loves pumpkin pie & me too - will try to thaw pie in fridge for a day before reheating for 10 minutes - will see how it works out & report back

This is the easiest and best recipe I have ever used for Pie crust. I have tried for years to make great crust and making this in the food processor gives the dough less handling and makes it very flaky. I use 4 T of ice water instead of 3. It is wonderful. Thank you! Paula in MO.

My first time making pie crust was using this recipe. I did as another reviewer suggested and put my butter and shortening in the flour and put the whole bowl in the freezer to chill. It didn't turn out pretty, but it was freaking delicious!! I need to make this a few more times because I'm sure with practice, it'll get better! I didn't once touch the dough with my bare hands as suggested and I'm glad because I can see how it could change the dough!

Crust tasted good, and using the food processor was magic, but I had to add several extra Tablespoons of water for it to come together well.

This might be ok for savory dishes, like quiche, but the texture and lack of flavor / personality really didn't work for the pumpkin pies we made. I'll keep looking for pie crust recipes...

I made this recipe for our Thanksgiving pies.  It is fabulous!  The dough is a little hard to work with because it doesn't quite all stay together, but it makes for a light, flaky, tender crust.

I used this recipe but did not use a food processor. I did it by hand using a pastry blender. It would have taken me longer to clean a processor than to just do it by hand. ;) The key really is to make sure that your fats are very cold and work quickly. Don't over mix either.

I can cook... I can bake... but pie crusts have been my nemesis.  I'm constantly at war with my Mother-in-law over the fact that she makes perfect pie crusts and mine are more like cardboard... until now!!! Finally a pie crust that I can't screw up!!!

This is the best food processor recipe for pie dough I have found.  I tore the dough transferring to pie pan, and it patched up beautifully and you could not tell when pie was baked.  Very flaky with excellent flavor.

This was a mess. The food process part of the recipe worked fine but rolling out this pie dough was a disaster. I followed the recipe exactly. The dough formed a ball but crumbled and stuck and fell apart when I tried to roll it out. I also wish the directions stated that this is a ONE pie crust recipe. Sheesh. I don't understand the 5 star rating.

Rating for ease of prep & rollout only (as I haven't eatten the lovely thing yet).  Snap to put together - dough held together well while rolling out.  Will rerate once used.

So easy - the instructions are wonderful and so helpful.  This is the best pie crust I've ever been able to make at home. I rolled it out after chilling using a cloth and rolling pin cover.  It was excellent and so flaky.  Thank you!

This was a perfect recipe! I never thought I'd be able to make pie crust but I had no problem with this. I made 4 crusts (for 2 double crust pies). The first was a little wet and took awhile to roll out. The last ones were perfect.

Well I have made this pie crust just now, I needed 3 crusts so I made them and they are now ready for me when I make pies this afternoon, or tomorrow.  I'll let you all know how they turn out for me!  They did work up just like the directions said...Nice and crumbly, then I put in plactic wrap, patted into a disk now they are chillin:) in the fridge, and it looks to be holding together really well :) I used Chrisco and frozen butter (unsalted).  I post after I used them, HAPPY BAKING

Loved it! I've tried so many "no-fail" recipes and they have always failed. The crust is so tender,  flakey and absolutely delish!  I followed the recipe to a T and it will definitely be a repeat! I used this to make Apple Crumble Pie, also from this site. Thanks for the recipe.

Making a nice pie crust has been my downfall until I found this recipe. For the first time I made a perfect crust that didn't fall apart when I transferred it to the pie plate. Next time I'll take a little more care to make it "pretty", but my confidence has had a boost. I was careful to have the butter and shortening very cold, as well as the bowl of the food processor. I'm throwing away all the other pie crust  recipes accumulated during repeated failures.

This recipe will not give you any “extra” dough.  I doubled it and had to utilize smaller pie pans (8”). I had just enough for 2 pies with entire top crusts (didn’t have time for the fancy weaving).   I used 2T more of butter and 2T less of the shortening. The crust was very good and I got to use my new food processor in making the crust - so much easier.

My whole life, I could bake anything I tried... except... pie crust. No matter what I did, no matter the recipe (which is pretty standard) my pie crust totally sucked. Until last year at Thanksgiving when I used this recipe. I think it's the shortening, and I froze that and the butter. It's just perfect. Thank you!!!

Really good!  I use lard instead of shortening, but other than that followed the recipe to a T.   I use the low setting on my food processor (Cuisinart) and make sure to not add any more water than what the recipe calls for.  I'll not be buying any more pie crusts!

Not the best out there.  It was pretty dry, I think it needed more water added and not less if using food processor.  Doesn't make 2 crusts, more like 1 and 1/4

If you can work with the crumbly dough and roll it out, it's a very light and airy crust.

I'm glad this recipe worked for so many chefs here, but I had no luck. I tried this recipe twice...followed it to the letter. The result was disappointing. Both the quality and quantity of the pie crust dough was sub par. A real shame, as I would love to have a reliable, quality recipe for making pie crusts with a food processor.

Thanks for the video and the foundation for a great recipe.
When it comes to measuring butter and shortening, I'm a big fan of using weights. (1 Tbsp butter=14.2g; 1  Tbsp shortening=12.8g)  I just find it easier when adjusting measurements such as doubling this one to get two pie shells.
I prefer a higher ration of butter to shortening, so I went with 170g of butter and about 70g of shortening)
Definitely stick them in the freezer a bit.
It made more sense to me to add the salt, give the processor a couple of pulses then add the fats.
Good tip about adding the water cautiously near the end.  Make a good snowball :-) before wrapping it up and letting it rest.  30min to 2 hrs depending on your time available.
I'm definitely a fan of the food processor over the old pastry cutter for both efficiency and clean up.

I will definitely make this again. It was the easier pie crust I  have ever made and I didn't even freeze the butter and shortening, I just took it straight from the refrigerator and I didn't chill the dough before rolling it out. It was effortless, perfect pie crust. It's only enough for one crust, though, which is what I wanted for the key lime pie I was making.

I made this recipe exactly as written to top a homemade chicken pot pie. Like other reviewers, the dough crumbled and fell apart after being chilled and attempting to (gently) roll it out. I added a little more water which helped a little. Also, I guess that I just don't care for shortening because  I did not enjoy the flavor of it in the end. My kids didn't like it either so it wasn't just me. Next time I will try Chef John's recipe using only butter.

Used only butter. It was too crumbly to form a ball with only 3 TB of ice water. Used more water. Not much. Brushed an egg wash over the crust 10 minutes before the end of the bake. Verrrry nice results. Very pleased with this quick, easy crust. It tasted buttery, flaky and crumbly and tender, like French pastry.

I inherited my mother's deep rooted fear of making pie crust and it wasn't until I retired and my son bought me my KitchenAid food processor that I put on my big girl panties and bravely tackled making my own home made pie crust.  I found this recipe, and, after many pies that didn't look that great (my problem, not the recipe) but tasted yummy, I finally have the process down to a science. My pies are so yummy, and the crust so flaky, that  I'm thinking of entering them in the county fair pie contests. :) The family always knows there's something yummy to eat at Grammy's.

I made this and thought it was great tasting.  I used salted butter and still added all the salt called for.  I was trying to be careful about how much water to add, and I went a little short so I was glad I'd upped the servings to 20 for a double crust so there would be room for error (I am NOT a good pie crust baker).  I should make another pie soon so I can get this down pat!  Thanks, Charlotte!

I tried this recipe twice. Came out good the first time. The second time I used white lily flour. OMG. If I had put this pie in a contest I know it would have won a blue ribbon.  If you are not from the south you can order white lily flour online. It is a soft , low protein flour unlike the northern hard wheat flour I can only get in Calif. I followed this recipe exactly. My shortening and butter were put in the freezer beforehand.

Perfect! Used this to make a quiche and it was just right. I despise making homemade crust so this really was a nice surprise -- way less headache than usual.

I followed this recipe to the letter and ended up with a crust that was impossible to work with. I tried altering the amount of water but after 4 attempts with new ingredients each time, I gave up. I'm going back to making it the old fashioned way. Some things were just not meant to be done by a shortcut.

This was really easy to make in the food processor and tasted delicious. I didn't freeze the shortening or butter, but if I have time next time I"ll give it a shot.
