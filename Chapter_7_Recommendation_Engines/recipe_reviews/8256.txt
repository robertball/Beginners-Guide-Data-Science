I made this yesterday for today (today being Christmas). I know it's not a very Christmas-y dessert but I wanted something completely different from the half-dozen things we had for dessert on Thanksgiving. I made the lemon variety and it was amazing! One could make this cake in such a variety of flavors, limited only by what extracts you can find.

I do have some advice regarding the frosting though. Make this cake the day (or at last many hours) before you are going to serve it. Chill the frosting for at least an hour before putting it on the cake as it will firm up and be able to support the layers better (allowing you to put more between each layer). Frost the cake, reserve the leftover frosting, and chill. When you serve it, frost it again, using as much of the frosting as you can. Its not sweet, so don't be afraid to use LOTS of frosting. That's why the recipe makes as much frosting as it does, because its GOOD. There's no need to waste it.

This recipe is GREAT! I had never heard of an orange creamsicle cake, but when it was requested of me, I of course turned to this website. My only suggestion is to cut down the recipe for the icing...unless you plan on icing more than your cake. I would say half everything and it should be more than enough without extra containers of it left over. This is the PERFECT orange cream cake and does really taste like the summertime favorite!

I just made this cake and with a few adjustments it was perfect. It really tastes like a cream sickle you just got off the ice cream truck. The things changed are: I doubled the amount of extract in both the cake and icing (add to taste), I also added non-flavored gelatin (1 - 2 pkgs) in the icing (icing is a little thin), added food coloring to the icing to make it the color of the orange of a cream sickle and I used a white cake mix. It was perfect!! The icing is a little thin, even after setting, without the gelatin. I love the icing because it is not a real sweet icing. My daughter and I usually share a piece of cake, I eat the cake and she eats the icing. There will be NO SHARING TODAY. lol For an added twist I made a coconut cream version of this as well by: where ever it says water/milk I used coconut milk (canned of course, I'll try fresh next time, lol) and I used coconut extract (still doubling of course), as well as the gelatin, top with coconut and this is a coconut cake to die for!!!

Fantastic!!  Tastes just like the creamsicle!  The cake is really moist and flavorful, but it is the frosting that makes this cake.  The frosting really has that creamsicle flavor that is so yummy!

I chilled the cake briefly to make it easier to cut the layers. I used a generous amount of frosting between the layers and iced the top and sides as well.  The cake looked beautiful after it was cut.  The rich orange color and the creamy white - just spectacular.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great cake with a few adjustments. To the CAKE MIX, use ORANGE JUICE instead of MILK and ADD one small box ORANGE GELATIN. (using juice makes a lighter batter, but using milk is great if you prefer a more dense cake. Both methods are good) Reduce Orange Extract to 1 tsp. in cake. FOR ICING, instead of sour cream, I use CREAM CHEESE and replace the orange extract in the frosting with vanilla. This creates a dramatic taste difference for the orange-vanilla taste in Dreamsicles.

This tastes just like a Creamsicle! The frosting is delicious (hubby was eating leftovers by the spoonful) and very light. I couldn't get mine to set up firm enough to stay on the cake (even after letting the frosting sit in the fridge for 5+ hours), so I added in a packet of unflavored gelatin and stuck it in the fridge for another 1/2 hour. After letting the frosted cake refrigerate overnight, it held up beautifully, even when cut. Co-workers raved and it's perfect for the 100+ degree weather we're having! I decorated it with orange slice gummy candies so it didn't look like a white blob and people couldn't believe I made it.

Only made the frosting. Frosted Bee Lian's Orange cake on this site.  Creamy, and not runny at all.  I used 1/2 recipe for one 8x8 round cake. There was leftover, but not enough for another whole cake.  
One suggestion:  Mix the powdered sugar with the sour cream to get rid of the sugar lumps and then fold in the whipped topping. 
Leftover frosting makes a good fruit dip!

I read the previous reviews about how you can use white cake since orange cake is hard to find and many people commented on how the frosting was runny. So I used white cake instead of the orange and added orange juice instead of the milk, as one reviewer suggested. I still used the orange extract in the cake, but made a completely different frosting. I used a cream cheese frosting from this site and added a little bit more vanilla and powdered sugar than it called for to bring out the vanilla and have a good contrast between the orange and vanilla. After frosting the cupcakes, I put an orange slice gummy on each (as another reviewer had done). These were sooooooo good and everyone at our BBQ loved them. I will definitely be making these again!

This cake sounded so good I just had to try it and it came out perfect!  I used only half of the sour cream in the frosting stirring it into the confectioners sugar.  Then I added that to the whipped topping.  This is NOT too sweet.

DELICIOUS! I made this for a family cookout and this cake was gone in 5 minutes.... it was so good that I had to make it again for the next family gathering. I feel like this dessert is more appropriate in the summer..... I will definitely make this again.

Very delicious cake.  Made it for my sister's birthday.  I actually split it into two 9x13 to make it a layered rectangle cake but it worked great.  Popular and delicious!

Wow!  I made an orange dreamsicle cake many years ago and could not find the recipe anywhere (all I remember is it had sour cream).  I made this one for a family get-together, then for a work potluck, then for my boyfriend's work potluck, then again for my daughter...  It is fantastic.  The only mention I will make, do not substitute the orange cake with lemon.  It loses the orange flavor that way.  I also tried it with fresh-made whipped cream and that came out really well.  Kudos!!!

This cake is delicious!  I had a hard time finding Orange Cake mix, so I got Lemon Cake mix and added Orange Flavoring and About 8 drops of re food coloring to the batter and mixed very well.  The yellow of the cake mix and the eggs are enough yellow to make orange colored cake.  I also added cleared sugar sprinkles all over the frosted cake to give sparkle and texture. Definitely a hit!  Oh, I almost forgot!  I put Mandarine orange slice between the layers with the frosting.  It gives it an added layer of cool deliciousness!  Also, I read some of the other reviews and I am not sure what went wrong with some of the other cakes.  I have made this recipe four times at my Dietary dept at work, and it turned out beautifully!

I rated based on the exact recipe. Makes ALOT of frosting. Which could be a bad or good, based on how much you wanna eat frosting! The frosting is also very, very runny.  It would be great for a sheet cake style cake, but NOT a layer cake which I did.  I had to make last minute adjustments that saved it!  I placed skewers through the cake layers to keep it from sliding.  And keep in mind, all the layers were chilled overnite along with the frosting and it  still was way too runny!  I would advise to make a stablized whipped topping (16 oz. heavy whipping cream)from scratch, then use only 8 oz. sourcream.  I am a seasoned professional baker, so I'm not speaking from lack of experience.  The flavors are a wonderful combo!  And if you need a luscious summer dessert in a hurry, go for it!  COLD refrigeration is KEY!!

I made this today for my hubby's birthday.  He raved about it, but I'm not sold on it.  The frosting was wonderful, but the cake part needs tweaking.  It seemed dry and too orangey.  I have to admit, that it makes a very beautiful cake.

I made this for an Easter celebration at work and it went over really well. It was very refreshing and the frosting is just perfect to top off the orange cake. I made it exactly to recipe and it came out perfectly- wouldn't change a thing about it. I will certainly be making this again!

This was a very dry and flavorless cake with a goopy plastic "frosting". The only thing I can say for it is it is very easy to prepare and would come in handy for a quick bake sale or school item you would give away anyway.

I couldn't find orange cake anywhere. So I tried a white cake mix and added 4 teaspoons of the orange extract. It still had very little orange flavor. In fact, no one knew it was orange flavor until I said it and then they said they detected a small amount of orange flavor. I did like the ease and consistency of the frosting. I took the advice of another post and let it set up for about an hour before spreading. It makes a really large amount! I would probably use the frosting again but not the cake. I had no problem substituting lite whipped topping and lite sour cream in the frosting recipe.

This cake gets 3 stars because the frosting is soupy and the cake looked terrible. The thing is, it’s cake and it did taste pretty darn good. I tried adding the gelatin envelope & and letting it sit in the fridge for hours & still ended up with soupy frosting.

This is my new favorite dessert. Made it the other night for the family and used SO much frosting. They all loved it! I agree with everyone else, tastes just like an orange creamsicle. And it's the best darn creamsicle I've ever had. Absolutely make sure you chill it long enough before serving. It's best served cold anyway. In my opinion, the recipe is perfect as is and doesn't need any changes.

I am full of regrets right now...I regret that I did not read the reviews before making this cake and regret that I banked on this cake being a sure thing for my dinner guests tonight. Let me make something very clear...this "icing" is NOT icing. I made exactly as directed and it's a runny mess, even after sitting in the fridge for several hours. So after pouring it all over the cake anyway hoping for a miracle it just ran all over the place and my cake layers just slid right off. Realizing it was ruined I went ahead and tried a piece and it tastes okay...but if you are supposed to let the icing sit overnight to 'set up' then it should be in the instructions.  Now I have to run to the grocery store and buy some nasty pre-made dessert and serve it with embarrasment.  NOT HAPPY.   :(

This recipe was fabulously delicious. I would make this cake again in an instant. It tasted so yummy so yummy so yummy. My family and I ate it all up within 2 days we couldn't get enough. I did make a couple of changes, instead of orange mix I used white and added extra orange flavoring. The icing also turned out perfect but I only used half of the sour cream and it turned out perfect. Will make this again for sure.

Pretty good cake.  Our whole family enjoyed it.  I didn't make the frosting though.

This cake tastes just like it sounds.  It is absolutely wonderful.  I didn't cut the two cakes into four and the frosting was a little runny.  Besides that I will definetly make it again.

This was a big hit at a birthday party for my choir mates.  I too could not find an orange cake mix, but lemon substituted fine.  Lots of frosting , which made for a large looking frosted cake.  Easy recipe with dramatic results.

The topping came out so ridiculously runny that i had to add a lot more confectionary sugar- and it still never firmed up. Though it tasted great, it looked like a disaster and i had made it for someone's birthday.  Would not recommend this cake at all.

I made this for my nephews birthday and my entire family just raved about it. This is unusual,because they generally expect me to bring something wonderful, since baking has always been a hobby of mine. It did't seem heavy even after a large dinner.

Yummy!  My grocery store didn't have orange cake mix, so I used a lemon cake mix and just used food coloring for appearance.  I'm looking for any excuse to make it again.

This recipe is stupendous!  I also couldn't find orange flavored cake mix, so I used pineapple mix, and pineapple extract. It was so easy to prepare and heavenly flavored. I made it for my son's 12th birthday and he added "that cake, Mom!" to his list of birthday gifts. Thanks for the recipe, Neris

Not exactly like a creamsicle, but still pretty good. Orange cake mix is hard to find. I ended up using a white mix and adding orange extract and food coloring.
