Delicious and a lot less calories than the typical veggie dip. I must say it is shocking that someone actually reviewed this recipe and admitted that they didn't actually try making the dip.  Strange that such a "review" would be accepted for submission and quite unfair to the creator of this yummy recipe.

I didn't make this & gave a rating only because the review requires it . I guessed a 3 would be neutral. In step 3, she says to "Fold caramelized onions into tangy creamy cheese..." That is misleading and confusing since there is no cheese in this recipe. For search engines, better titles would be Isa's "vegan french onion dip or Isa's french onion "bean" dip. 

Recipe sounds interesting though and may taste good as a bean dip.

This is seriously SO tasty. I love how awesomely oniony—and creamy—it is and that my vegan baby sister can enjoy it with me.

For what it is, it's very good. I really liked it, but my non-vegetarian friends didn't go for more than one dip. It might be nicer if I found a way to make it less thick. Between the coconut oil and the caramelized onions, it tasted quite sweet, so it would be nice served with salty pita chips or saltier veggies like celery. Or maybe try a bit of salt? Just thinking out loud how I might tweak it for next time. But, as I said, it's nice at is it and is what it claims to be :)
