I used 1 packet stevia, and red rooibos tea instead of the black kind.  This was delicious!

This is GREAT! Super easy. Because I don't use Stevia, I used Splenda and instead of soy, I used fat free milk and cut the milk by half. The sweetness amount was perfect and honestly, I think this would be just as good with honey or agave nectar. This really helped with my sore throat this morning. I think next time, I might add a recipe and a half of the spices though I will say the recipe is very good as is. I just like my spices a little stronger.

This turned out beautifully!  I like the spice combination and the fact that it uses ground spices which are readily available and infuse quickly.  Once it had steeped, I strained out a most of the spice residue with a fine mesh strainer.  I am considering making up batch sized tea bags of the dry ingredients as party favors or office gifts.

I converted the recipe for just 1 cup.  I did not have soy milk so I used 2% milk.  Nor did I have Stevia extract so I sweetened to taste with sugar.  The flavor was just as good as the Chai Tea mixes you can buy.  I was very pleased with the taste, especially since I now live in Costa Rica and have not found and form of Chai Tea here.  (Do not expect any of the spices to dissolve, they will just sink to the bottom of the cup.  So, stir!)

tasty spicy goodness.  I think I will add one more tea bag next time as mine was missing just a bit more of that tea taste, but delicious anyway.  I did have one problem in that converting the recipe from 6 servings to 4 the stevia amounts went from 1/4 cup to 38 cups.  Lol  I can't imagine what that would taste like.  I obviously sweetened to taste.
