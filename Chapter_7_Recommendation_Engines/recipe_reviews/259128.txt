This pumpkin pie was a great hit with my family.  Made it gluten-free by using a store-bought Mi-Del gluten-free crumb crust.  

I'd made this same pie previously and it was a bit too sweet.  This time I reduced the sugars by half, using evaporated milk in place of the sweetened condensed milk and eliminating the added sugar.  2/3 c. maple syrup was the only sweetener used.  This made everything more liquid, so I increased the ground chia to a total of 2/3 c. 

Chia tends to dull the intensity of spices, so I doubled the amount of vanilla and cinnamon, and added 1 T. cardamon, 1 t. allspice and 1/4 t. mace. The clove and nutmeg amounts should also be increased for a more intense pumpkin pie flavor.  

Baking this pie as instructed at 325 for 40 minutes gives the pudding a wonderful texture, with cracking around the edges.  No one could tell that this was an egg-less filling.

The recipe as modified made more pudding than would fit in the pie crust. The pudding leftover could simply be refrigerated for an hour and eaten cold. But I poured the extra into a ramekin and baked it along with the pie. It came out great!

Does this have to be baked? Since there are no eggs, can I use this as a no bake recipe?
