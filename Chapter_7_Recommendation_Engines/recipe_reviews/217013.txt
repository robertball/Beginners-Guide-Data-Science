First time I've ever had jicama, and I wasn't too crazy about it.  Its crunchiness is nice, but it's also a bit slimy (for lack of a better word) and really doesn't have much flavor, if any.  I don't think it adds anything to the salad, and I would omit in the future, particularly considering it was expensive.  IMHO, what really makes this salad unusual is the grapefruit.  I served this with the recommended Habanero Heat Salad Dressing which was a good complement.

This recipe is good as is.  I must however disagree with a comment that jicama was "slimy"- Jicama is crunchy and watery- if it's slimy it must've not been fresh.  An easy alternative to jicama can be a green mango (NOT ripe and sweet).  It will offer the same crunchiness but with a bit of tartness at the same time. 
Second alternative can be to use pineapple.  NOT from a can but freshly cut.  Thanks for the recipe.

Outstanding! A delicious mix of flavors, colors, and textures. We used already-cut-up grapefruit segments from the refrigerator case at the grocery store, and substituted cherry/grape tomatoes for the chopped tomato. The dressing I used was a raspberry vinaigrette, but I think it would be great with a poppy seed dressing as well.

Lovely crunchy salad.  It was well received by a dinner party of 7.  I would slice the green onions very thin next time...not a big onion fan. I would add more cilantro too or offer more on the side for the cilantro fans.  I made the suggested Habanero Heat Salad Dressing (see my review there), and it is wonderful!  However, I opted to mix it with the salad just before serving and it was completely lost in the salad.  (I doubled the salad recipe to 12 and made the 12 servings of dressing (was not even close to 12).  Next time I'll offer the dressing to drizzle on top of the salad and make lots more dressing.  That should be an awesome taste hit. This salad is so moist that mixing dressing in it isn't likely to work well under any circumstances.

Ok but the combination of flavors was too odd for me. Makes a lot.
