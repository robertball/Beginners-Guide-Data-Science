This recipe was a hit at our table. It was gone the same day and I made a new cake the next morning! I made a few changes... 1/3 cup honey instead of 2/3 cups sugar and increase milk to 2/3 cup. Yummy! Seeds from grapes add a crunshy twist...

WOW! Light and moist, this cake is a winner. I loved the addition of olive oil. Not too sweet, with a hint of citrus. Mmmm! Loved it. I will definitely be making it again. Incidentally, I made this cake to share at an interview at an olive oil company (made with their oil). They loved it, too! Hopefully, it will get me a job. :)

I made it with blueberries instead of grapes and it was really good, it's a keeper, doubled the recipe, didn't use springform.

This wasn't a bad cake. But, I do prefer a lighter, fluffier cake. I also wasn't too big of a fan of the grapes. They're just kind of sour. I would prefer something else, like raspberries.

too dry, let's try a little more baking powder and less cooking time at 150 C degrees.

This was very yum and an innovative cake. But maybe here in India the grapes aren't as small or sweet 'coz the skins added a slightly sour taste which spoilt it for some people.

This cake is definitely best eaten with a cup of tea of coffee, otherwise it is rather dry and not very sweet. It also sank a lot after I took it out of the oven, but that was probably my fault as I'm not very good at making cakes. Thanks!

These grapes are in season in my part of the world and my family loves them.  The cake is rather unusual and absolutely delicious.
