I tried this recipe on a whim for Christmas day and it turned out awful! I went back and reviewed the directions and I did everything right. 
The yams didn't cook well and were still rock hard when I served it. The sauce wasn't nearly enough to cover and help cook all the apples and yams. 
Beware of this recipe, it's not a good one!

I tried this recipe because I hate sweet potatoes and everyone in my family loves them. It turned out fantastic and everyone loved it, including me!! I added a bit more juice than what the recipe calls for because it didn't seem to be enough liquid to cook the potatoes, about a 1/2 cup more. (That's why I only gave it 4 stars.) I highly recommend this recipe and I will definetly make it again.
