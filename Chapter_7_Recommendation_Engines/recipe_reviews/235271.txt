This recipe was delicious and easy to make. Took it to a pre Thanksgiving family dinner.  It was a hit..Everyone wanted seconds.  I used a gluten free spice cake mix in place of the regular yellow cake mix due to gluten intolerance in our family. The spice really complemented the flavor of the pumpkin. Other than that I followed the recipe as written.  Cooking time was a little longer than an hour.  This will be a family favorite for years to come. Thanks!

Oh my goodness!! I would give this more stars if that were possible! Rose Marie I want to thank you for submitting this recipe for the rest of us to enjoy! This is definitely a keeper & one I will be baking several times throughout the year. I prepared this recipe substituting Splenda for the sugar (hubby is a diabetic) and used a butter recipe cake mix (didn't have a yellow cake mix in the pantry) but all other ingredients were as the recipe called for. I used the toothpick method to test for doneness, and yes it took longer than the 60 minutes the recipe states to bake, but seriously people. I baked mine an additional 6 minutes and it tastes wonderful! Every baked recipe needs to be adapted for your particular oven right? Long story short, this is an exceptional recipe! Next time I bake it I will use a yellow cake mix and still be just as pleased with the outcome! My family happens to love pumpkin pie but some do not care for crust so this is a win win in my book! Thank you!!!

When the recipe submitter says this tastes like pumpkin pie, believe her.  It definitely does!  Now, that's not the greatest thing for me, since I'm not the biggest fan of pumpkin pie, but I know a lot of people are, so we can discount my opinion.  I think it's the texture since I like the taste of pumpkin.  At any rate, this used up a lot of stuff in my pantry.  I had two 15 oz cans of pumpkin so had a bit more pumpkin than called for, and didn't have yellow cake mix so I used vanilla.  Still, this worked really well and tastes like a basic pumpkin pie.  It makes a ton and I'm hoping my sister in law and nieces like pumpkin pie, since I plan to bring a lot of this to their house when we go over to give them our presents.  This is incredibly easy to make; just be prepared to leave it in the oven longer than stated.  Mine took an hour and 20 minutes.  Thanks for the recipe!

My family has been using this favorite recipe for years.  We call it Peter Pumkin Eater LOL  I think the term bars is a little misleading because it is not something you can pick up and eat.  It's moist and better than pumpkin pie!

This recipe is easy and tastes great!  I substituted 1 cup gluten free cake mix,  and left off the topping, so it was even more like pumpkin pie AND gluten free.  Yay!

Delish! I didn't have any evaporated milk, so instead used 1/2 c heavy cream and 1 cup whole milk. I also used spice cake mix. It is really good, tastes like pumpkin pie but the cake mix makes it a bit firmer.  A keeper!

I JUST took these out and have been letting them cool.   Holy smokes, are they good.  I couldn't wait to cool them completely to take a taste.  It really is JUST like pumpkin pie!!  I was skeptical about this one as I was mixing it and as it was baking.. it puffed up like a cake and I was thinking.. oh no.. something went wrong.. but after cooling.. it settles and ends up the consistency of pumpkin pie.  Like pie with the crust on top!  My son, who loves pumpkin pie and always leaves the crust will LOVE this.  I just put them in the fridge to cool all the way, I am taking them to a party later.. going to bring whipped cream to put on top.   Thanks Rose.. this is really great.  I may make this at thanksgiving instead of a pie!  For one thing, it serves more people!!  It's a HUGE pan!  I will say mine took 1 hour and 25 min to cook like the others, and it still "jigged" some when I took it out, but was set.   As it cools, it comes together.  Awesome.

This is, indeed a recipe that keeps you coming back for more!  Why not 5 stars?  I think the cake mix on the top is a bit too much because not all of it browns up nicely and there are chunks of it that fall off when slicing into bars.  Next time I will either swirl some of it down into the mixture or just use less of the cake mix on top.  Oh, and I'm definitely going to add some chopped candied pecans on the top.  Then, it'll be 5 stars!

I don't bake very often, and I don't make pies. I don't even really enjoy pumpkin pie....but honestly theses were amazing, I made them just as the recipe suggests and they were a huge hit. Only one thing is that they took at least an hour and a half to bake in my oven but i will definitely be adding them to my Thanksgivng menu! Thank-you for sharing - so easy and so good.

This recipe is awesome and so easy to make. The only adjustment I made was to substitute real sugar with Stevia for baking, sugar free yellow cake mix and sugar free whipped topping because my boyfriend is a diabetic. We had his parents over for dinner tonight and both his dad and himself ate two pieces, that speaks for itself! I was looking for a dessert to bring to the Thanksgiving Dinner next week, found it! Thank you

I’ve made this several times now and I am giving 4 stars because I think it’s a great starting point but with modifications it becomes one of my favorites! The first time I made this I followed the recipe to a T and it came out too wet/mushy and looks pretty unappealing. That said, everyone happily gobbled it up anyway. First of all, this makes wayyyy more than a 9x13 pan’s worth. So there was pumpkin mix leftover to experiment with. Here what worked best for my taste: Mix an extra cup of cake mix into the pumpkin stuff (I followed one of the reviews here and used gluten free spice cake mix). Then mix the rest of the cake mix into about a 3/4 cup softened butter to make a crumble and line the pan with it. Then top with the pumpkin stuff. Then top with more crumble and add candied pecans (another reviewer’s tip). I baked for 1 and half hours because I like bars a little firmer. Heaven!

This was a big hit with everyone at the party. I made it using a gluten free yellow cake mix due to allergies in the group and everyone thought it was great. Instead of melting the butter, I cut cold butter into the remaining cake mix with a pastry cutter and sprinkled it on top of the filling. It worked perfectly. If your using a throw away pan, put it on a cookie sheet first because it will be heavy and wobbly. This took about an hour and a half to cook thoroughly.

The picture is deceiving. What are those little things that look like seeds on top?  The instructions were confusing and there should have been a warning not to use foil store-bought pans. I was taking it to a BBQ so I used a throw-away cake pan which could not hold the heavy batter. As I put it in the oven, the cake pan buckled. I don't have to tell you what I did for the next hour!  It was an expensive recipe and a total disaster that could have been avoided with a caution to use glass or metal cake pan due to weight.   I cleaned my oven, called it a day, and went back to bed.

The taste is great. I hate to be the debbie downer here, but I'm not crazy about the sprinkling of the cake mix and drizzled butter on the top.  There were spots on mine that are still powdery, just a few, but there all the same.  This was a trial run for Thanksgiving!

I have never used a box mix until now. I followed this recipe exactly, except changed the spices to 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice. The filling was super tasty. Excellent with vanilla ice cream. However, the topping needed some work. I think premixing the butter and the topping instead of just pouring it on might be better. My topping had a lot of flour spots where it just didnt mix on the topping. Or possibly adding 1/4-1/2 cup oats for texture might be a welcome change. I also used sweet potato puree and it was tasty.

Its an excellent alternative to traditional pumpkin pie. Super  quick and easy to make. I did add more spices (1/2 tsp cinn  & 1/4 tsp ginger & cloves)as we prefer a bigger flavor and it did need to cook longer,mine for an 1 hr 15 min, I also used the toothpick method to test doneness. These bars are definitely a keeper I'll be making for years to come!

This is scrumptious! I didn't have any ginger on hand, but it tasted so yummy we didn't miss it. Also, I had only 1 can of evaporated milk, so I used 1-1/2 cups of light cream as a substitute for the second can.

My friends gave this rave reviews!!!  So delicious!  I made this last night to bring to a party today.  Just like other reviewers said, while baking it puffed up (almost looked like it was going to overflow the dish) and it took more like an hour and a half to cook. I followed the recipe exactly, after baking for 1 hour I tested with a toothpick which came out almost-clean, so I decided to let it cool and "set" because it was real jiggly.  After it cooled it was still very mushy, so I baked it another 40 minutes to get it to set a little better.  The next time I make this recipe I will probably just bake it an hour and a half and I bet it will turn out great.  The flavor is perfect.  It's like pumpkin pie, but just a slightly different texture and a thin moist cake layer on top.  Not overly sweet.  As a health nut who normally eats very lean, I can only stomach one serving of these because they are kind of rich compared to my usual diet. But it is worth it!!!  Anyways, I brought these to the party today and several people went out of their way to find me and tell me how wonderful they tasted.  They were great even without whipped topping.  This recipe is going to be added to our list of Thanksgiving and Christmas dishes.  Thank you for sharing Rose Marie!!!

Didn't change any ingredients.  I did have to bake them an extra 15 minutes and used a 9x14 pan instead of baking dish.  My mother taught me to test pumpkin pies using a butter knife.  Place in pie like a toothpick and if it comes out clean it's done.  At first I actually thought I might have baked it to long but it was fine. A nice golden brown, which gives the top crust a nice crunch.  These are pumpkin pies in a bar form. Great flavor, but I may add a bit more spices next time. Mine looked just like the pictures on the page. They can be a bit tricky to get out of the pan if you need to cut and put on a serving plate because of the pie filling is on the bottom, but can be done. I will be making these for Thanksgiving for sure.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I made it with the listed ingredients and amounts, but used a 9x13  pan.  Took out of oven at 65 minutes.  It tastes and feels like pumpkin pie.  Will definitely make this again, but am planning to add a layer of crushed graham crackers, as this came out a little soggy after 12 hours.

Didn't have a yellow cake mix so I used a white.  Just finished baking it.  I tasted it while it was still a little warm, but it tastes very salty.  If I make it again, I would either reduce the salt  or eliminate it completely, afterall, I am sure that the cake mix and the butter both have salt in them.  One teaspoon is definitely too much.  I will wait to hear what my husband has to say about it.

We love pumpkin pie, but not the crust so much.  I like that you get a pumpkin pie taste but I found it was kind of salty.  Maybe it was the cake mix I used.  We like this ok, don't know if I would make it again though.

Tastes just like pumpkin pie without the crust. Easy to make and did not stay in the house long!

This recipe is awesome even if you don't like pumpkin pie. I kicked it up a notch with a delicious cream topping. I used a 7 oz container of creme fraiche. I beat in 1/3 cup brown sugar, fresh ground cinammon and nutmeg, about a teaspoon of vanilla and a teaspoon of orange extract. Then I folded in enough whipped cream to get the consistency of soft ice cream.  Oh my!

Oh my ... This was so easy and got rave reviews from everyone! Fair warning: it's addictive so next time I think I'll use nonfat evaporated milk so I don't feel quite as guilty eating it for breakfast! ;). Since I had pumpkin pie spice I used 3 tsps of that in place of other spices but the results would have been the same - DELICIOUS!!
