I made a couple of changes based off personal preference and what I had on hand that was needed used. Lets start with corn. While hubs and I like it on its own, we are not thrilled with it mixed in with other things. I already had a bag of shredded cabbage and carrots that was leftover from another recipe and so carrots it was. My other change is that I had leftover sausage from that same recipe so I only used 1 chicken breast and subbed sausage for the other chicken breast. This turned out good and the wrappers crisped up real nice. The one thing I didn't love about this recipe was the amount of mayo and the addition of honey. I would only use 1/4 cup of mayo and would either leave out the honey altogether or either substitute sweet chili sauce (the pink kind found in the Asian section of grocery store). The cilantro in these gave them a Thai flair and I liked that.

Everyone really liked these. I made one batch with chicken and one with shrimp.  Both were great. I did omit the sugar and red pepper flakes and reduced the mayo a bit. The batch in the darker pan was read in 18 minutes. The batch in the lighter pan took an additional 6 minutes. This recipe is a definite keeper and can easily be adapted to your taste and on hand ingredients.

This is really flavorful and everyone loves it!  I agree with other reviews and use about 1/4 c mayo and bagged prepared coleslaw instead of plain cabbage.  This cuts the prepare time as well.
