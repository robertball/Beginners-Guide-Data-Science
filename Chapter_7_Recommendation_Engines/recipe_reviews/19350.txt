Everyone at my gaming group loved this with grilled chicken and steak! Nice easy and light! I didn't have green onions on hand so used Vidalia onions and some chives but it turned out wonderfully. I put this one in my recipe box!

Too bland. Needed more spices. Not enough tomato either.

I waited a little longer than recomended to add the tomato and added some fresh spinach at the same time. I also grated up a little sharp cheddar and mixed it in near the end. With the additions it was a great hit. I'll make it again.

I thought this was just okay. Not much flavor. Maybe if you add asparagus tips spinach or chicken it would fare better. Also I tend to think some herbs are in order. Even just some parsley would brighten it up.

This was very very mild. Maybe even bland. Even with the additions from other reviewers. To the sauce I added italian seasoning additional tomato salt pepper and a small amount of grated sharp cheddar cheese. I then added italian seasoned chicken. There wasn't enough sauce for the amount of paste either. If I made it again I would definitely double the amount of sauce. I would also add some additional seasonings.

General lack of flavor. Seemed to need more spices or something. Without the chicken we added it would have have lacked any substance. Don't think we will make this again.

My family thought this was really good. I served it with grilled bonless chicken breast. I did make just a couple of adjustments...I used a whole tomato and I added a little bit of Mrs.Dash to the tomato garlic & onion while I was sauteing them. We all liked this dish even my 2 yr old had seconds. Thanks for the recipe.

This was bland but the aroma it created during cooking was great. I used cooking spray whole-grain pasta & reduced-fat grated toping to make it a little more healthy.

This is ok its not great I made it as written and then tweaked it by adding more garlic and three whole chopped tomatoes. Its a decent base recipe but its no where near a main meal.

This is a great base recipe to add your own flare. I added some cubed chicken and then some sliced peperoncini's for that added zip and it was great.
