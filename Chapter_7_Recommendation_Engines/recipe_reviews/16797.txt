YUM-O!  This was excellent!  I used hot italian sausage and skipped the wine.  I also added a package of frozen corn, red peppers and black beans (came mixed together).  Also used 2 cans of diced tomatoes with green peppers and garlic instead of fresh tomatoes.  Added some red pepper flakes and used boxed cheese and spinach tortellini. Oh, and I put in a whole package of fresh baby spinach around 5 minutes before it was done.  This soup is great because you can add just about anything you like.  It was so delicious and filling.  This is a definite keeper in my house!

This is as good or better than any soups we've had in Italy.  My Italian husband loved it, and with all of the vegetables it's truly a healthy meal, even with the sausage!  Easy to modify (I added additional tortellini and vegetables to make it even heartier), and keeps well for additional meals.  Thank you, Tim, for a great recipe!

This is indeed really, really good!  I am a stickler for following a recipe to the letter the first time (I do not understand how people can trash a recipe and then go on at length about what they did or didn't do - it just isn't fair!)and I wouldn't change a thing.  Maybe add some fresh spinach or mushrooms?  Thanks Tim for an excellent addition to my recipe box!

I made this twice. The first time I used an iron skillet and hubby cooked sausage on grill. I sauted onions and garlic in pan. Then added red cooking wine and beef broth and let it boil for a while. Then, I added the sausage and let it cook a little longer. Then I put in crock pot and put in seasonings and tomato sauce. I left out the tomatoes. I let it cook for a couple hours more. Kids loved it. It got left out overnight and I had to throw it out. :(

Second batch I used chicken broth and cooked the sausage in the skillet. I put it in the crock pot again with the sauted veggies and instead of tomato sauce I just added a whole jar of spaghetti sauce! I left it thin enough to be a soup and the seasoning were enough to keep it tasting great. The second batch was a little oilier because of the cooking the sausage inside in a skillet rather than the grill. I think the flavor of sausage was better the first time, but the spaghetti sauce worked great.

Then second batch I

Delicious!  This is the second time I have made this.  First time, true to the recipe and second time, a few moderations.  Both ways, though, you can't go wrong!

This time I:
~used a can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh to save time
~out of red wine, used extra broth
~added a teaspoon of creole seasoning to bump up the flavor
~to cut calories I used turkey italian link sausage

I put everything but the tortellini in a crock pot and let it simmer on low all day while at work.  When I came home, I pulled the sausage out and sliced it, boiled the tortellini and added it, then added in 2 heaping tablespoons of cornstarch to 1/4 cup of water to thicken it up a bit.

Topped it all with a little dollop of sour cream and shredded cheddar with blue tortilla chips on the side and viola!  Dinner served with so little effort... :)

I used half beef and half chicken broth, canned diced tomatoes instead of fresh, dried pasta and I added some fresh baby spinach the last 5 minutes cooking.  This was a great soup.....and it makes a ton.  Hubby is looking forward to leftovers!  Thanks Tim for the great recipe.

The beauty of this type of soup, beside the fact that it’s incredibly satisfying as well as delicious (I dare you to stop at just one bowl of this), is that it lends itself so well to adaptation, so as to make use of whatever odds and ends of pasta or vegetables you have on hand. In this instance, I was able to add some beautiful, rich juices left after slow cooking a beef roast yesterday with tomatoes, red wine and beef broth. I also used quite a bit more sausage than the recipe directed.  Unless your tomatoes are very red and ripe, difficult in April, I would suggest using a good, canned tomato instead, preferably San Marzano, which is what I did today. I passed on the tomato sauce.   I didn’t have zucchini and I don’t care for carrots (no, I mean to say I hate carrots) so I didn’t use them, filling the “gap” instead with celery (the leaves too!) and baby spinach, which I added toward the end.  I used fresh oregano and basil because I was lucky enough to have it growing. I didn’t have cheese tortellini (Hubs hates it) but I did have some cute little mini beef ravioli, which filled in nicely.  I cooked the ravioli separately, then added it at the end, so it wouldn’t absorb too much broth.  There is no right or wrong way to make this soup, BUT…to be authentic you MUST add the freshly grated Parmesan upon serving.  I had intended to serve this tonight with a salad and Italian bread, but we found this completely satisfying without either.

I've made this recipe twice; but the 2nd time around I used about 3 1/2 Cups broth, and during the last 10 minutes of simmer, I added 1/2 Cup heavy whipping cream, and it was really, really good. Great recipe!

This soup was fantastic.  Made it as written, with the addition of a little more sausage, used bulk italian instead of link.  We made this for our daughter and son in law when they came in for christmas, they loved it.  Stuck the left overs in the fridge and after they left we had some for dinner, the tortalinnis sucked up all the juice, just took some out of the bowl, added more beef stock and reheated, was even better.  One thing I made a mistake was, went to the store to buy beef broth and grabbed chicken instead.  Didn't notice till I was making it, added that andtwo tsp of beef crystal broth, was the bomb. Will definatley make again.  Tried it cold before warming up and great flavor, could even serve it without being a soup with cheese sprinkled on top, very flavorful.

Great soup! Hubby ate 3 bowls of this last night with a hunk of quiche! I did modify a little though. I used 1lb. of hot turkey sausage browned and crumbled out of the casings, let that sautee with the onion and 3 minced garlic cloves. I used 6c. fat free/low sodium chix broth instead of the beef, added the red wine(which I loved the flavor of), 1 can(approx. 14oz) fire roasted tomatoes in the juice, 1/2 pk. of defrosted spinach, 1 can of drained and rinsed canelli beans, omitted the tomato sauce and green pepper. Used ditalini pasta instead of the tortellini and cooked that by itself and spooned some pasta in the bottom of the bowls, and added the hot soup on top. Very flavorful. Family really enjoyed this one. Thanks!

This was SO delicious!!  In place of the tomatoes and tomato sauce I used a large can of diced tomatoes with the juice.  I also didn't have green bell pepper, but it wasn't missed.  A loaf of crusty bread is all you need to go with this!  Thanks for this recipe, Tim!!!

This is the same recipe I have been using for years.  Love this soup!  For more bite-use the hot sausage.  I serve it with shredded parmesan cheese on top and hard bread to dunk.  Delicious!  Freezes well.

This recipe was great and the hubby and kids liked it.  I didn't have any red wine so I just used more water and I opted to leave out the green pepper.  I also used a can of Italian style diced tomatoes instead of tomatoes.  I served this with a fresh baguette and it was perfect.  I will definitely make again.

Fabulous soup! A hit with everyone in the family, including my very picky 6 year old. Lots of veggies, nice flavor.  I used mini raviolis instead of tortellinis only because I didn't have the tortellinis.  Will definately make again.

Excellent recipe.  I have prepared this recipe only once in my household and it is very good.  The only downside is the high price of packaged tortellini.  Other than that it is a very good recipe.

Very tasty. I used 7 cups of broth and eliminated the  wine and water. In the future, I will use a bit less broth and a bit more water...it was a bit salty. I also put in a bit more sausage. In the future, I might add a bit more vegatables. Overall...a wonderful recipe.

This was delicious! I am a newlywed and still figuring out what my hubby likes. This was perfect as he has a poultry allergy. I followed the recipe as well as I could, but did not have all the ingredients. I used a good handful of already cooked frozen breakfast sausage, and about a cup of cooked hamburger I had in the fridge for the meat. I added extra wine, and substituted tomato paste with extra water, and green beans for zucchini. The fresh tortellini was the perfect touch. I think I added extra water and spices too. It turned out perfectly and my husband asked several times, "where is that tortellini soup"! Thanks for the great recipe!

I made the imstake of using low sodium beef stock, to try and keep my family healthier.....the consensus was that flavor was lacking. Perhaps fresh basil next time? I also added extra parm and it melded well!

I used a big crockpot for this recipe. I doubled the recipe and this caused the crockpot to overflow so I had to take some liquid out. I used white wine instead of red and used 1/2 of what it asked for and it turned out fine with no hint of the alcohol taste. I used 9 Johnsonville italian brats and cut those up and I used 2 bags of tortellini (too much :) ). The tortellini really soaked up the liquid so keep that it mind. I didn't use green pepper because I didn't have one. I also used a big can of tomatoes stewed and chopped and then another 8 oz can instead of the fresh tomatoes. I poured the liquid in too. Now I have lots of leftovers but someone mentioned that this freezes well so I hope they are right. I fried the sausage and onion  and then I combined everything into a crockpot and cooked for 3 hours on low and 3 hours on high. I also forgot to drain the fat before I added the onions so I had to scoop out the fat later on. I added the frozen pasta 45 minutes before serving.

This was great!  I used a lowfat chicken italian sausage and substituted mushrooms for the zucchini (boyfriend doesn't like it), but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  A great, hearty meal on a cold, rainy night.  The best was that I threw it together in less than 45 minutes.

I made this recipe the first time as written and this was a good, solid soup!  The second time I tweaked it a little to our tastes.  I make my tweaked version frequently for a great meal, and I love the leftovers for a quick healthy lunch! I make a double batch, and use a whole pack of mild turkey Italian sausage (with a dash of red pepper flakesif I can't find hot Italian sausage).  Instead of the fresh tomatoes, I use a can of petite diced tomatoes per batch.  I have used all low sodium beef STOCK [not BROTH], or half low sodium beef and half low sodium vegetable stock (cause I ran out of beef stock in the process of cooking, but I had vegetable stock on hand), and we love both versions. I add 1/2 teaspoon of Italian seasoning to the seasoning mix, per batch (so a whole teaspoon for double).  We like fresh kale in this soup instead of the zucchini, and it ups the heartiness.  My husband always comments how great this smells when he comes home from work, and hits the pot with a spoon tasting almost immediately.   Instead of adding the tortellini to the pot, I put the frozen tortellini in the bottom of the serving bowls and ladle the hot soup over the cold pasta.  After about 2 minutes, the pasta is perfect and the soup was cool enough to eat.  Some fresh Parmesan and a little multigrain bread and a GREAT DINNER!!  If I am eating the leftovers the next day, I just measure out about 1/2 cup frozen tortellini to the bowl and microwave!  This is a great soup!

Good Stuff! I used Jimmy Dean Italian Sausage; 1/4 c red wine; diced canned tomatoes; kale instead of zucchini; no Parmesan cheese. Adopt changes to your taste; this hearty soup will still turn out great!

This is a great recipe to make on the weekend and portion out for future meals;  a couple of tips though
Used 1 lb of already ground Sausage (rather than the links) and if you want a bit of spice use half reg & half hot
We all know that fresh Tomatoes from the store are not always good, so use canned, dice, no salt added insteadh
Instead of chopped carrots, use julienne
Instead of Tomato Sause, use canned diced Italian stype Tomatoes
Add 8 oz of sliced mushrooms
Before adding tomatoes, puree them
Because I freeze, I do not add the tortellini, when I am making it, rather, I make the tortellini when I pull out the soup for meals.

Delicious!  I didn't have, or particularly like sausages, so I decided to make it without them.  To compensate for the spice of the sausages, I put in 1 1/2 tablespoons mild chilli powder, which gave it a very nice kick.  To further comepsnate for the lack of sausages, I also only put in 4 cups of beef brother, so there would be less liquid to absorb.  Then I put in twice as much tortellini, as I felt there was still far too much liquid without the sausages. Thoroughly recomended!

This was a GREAT easy dinner! I dumped it all in the crockpot (except the tortellini) and cooked on Low all day.  Added the tortellini when I got home and cooked for another 20 minutes.  Both my hubby and 5yr old RAVED about the flavor and requested that this be in the regular rotation. Any meal that they BOTH like is a keeper for me!

Absolutely delicious!  Everyone in my house enjoyed this soup.  I especially loved the pasta in it.  (Just be careful not to overcook.)  I also really enjoyed the base of the soup - it was perfect.  I will make this again and again.

So great right out of a restaurant. The wine is such a wonderful flavor. May I add that I don't even like wine. Used kielbasa sausage and just added it about 10min before it was done brought it back to a boil then simmered the last 10 min added tons of extra tortellini because i was using it as a main coarse. Mushrooms were a must in this as well. Reheats well and other reviewers were right the tortellini does soak up a bunch of the broth but still so delicious.

I made this soup in the crockpot. The only changes I made was using turkey sausage and fresh spinach. I aded the spinach at the end of the cooking time. My husband said this was the best soup he ever had. It is definitely a keeper.

Fantastic comfort food! Tweaked it a bit using what I had on hand- substituted marinara sauce for tomato sauce and threw in 3 big handfuls of fresh baby spinach.  Used chicken sweet Italian sausage, and left out the zucchini and carrots- because I didn't have either.  My husband had 3 bowls!  This is a do-over in my house!!

This is an excellent, deeply satisfying soup! I would like to offer a tip for those of us who cook for two: This soup freezes well--without the tortellini. If you throw a handful of frozen tortellini into each serving bowl as the soup simmers, then ladle the hot soup over the tortellini, then let the soup cool for a few minutes, your pasta is perfectly cooked.

I made this for a Ladies Bible study group and everyone raved about it.  It was the second time I had made it. Some changes 2nd time around:
1) made a day ahead
2) Instead of fresh tomatoes like the first time, I added 1 large can of crushed tomatoes with basil + 1 reg. can of italian diced tomates, juice and all.
3) Cooked everything but the pasta in the crockpot night before, cooked pasta seperate and added about two hours before serving.

Made this soup tonight and it was delicious.   I used two cans of diced tomatoes with basil/oregano rather than fresh tomatoes and skipped the wine.   As I like my food a little spicy I also added some crushed red peppers.  Will add a little more sausage next time otherwise perfect.

This was awesome!  I took the suggestion of adding a bag of fresh spinach five minutes prior to it being done.  Oh, and I recommend doubling the amount of sausage.  Super soup!  This one's a keeper.

I just made this for dinner tonight for the first time.  I normally stick to the recipe but when tasting the soup when making it I was worried it could use more than just a half a cup of pasta sauce.  I used a 1lb 10oz can of hunts pasta sauce and it was thicker and hearty along with the beef stock. I also added the spinage which was a nice touch too.  I am always worried when trying a new recipe, but this was very good and I will make it again.

The soup was really good. It was loaded with lots of veggies and filling... Only thing I did different was add one bunch of chopped up kale to the pot. I had some and thought it would be a nice addition, which it was.

Delicious! Made it exactly as written. Only addition hubby requested was red pepper, but he eats everything spiced up! Will make this again and again. Thanks Tim.

I used balk sausage instead of sausage links.  I also put in some red pepper flakes.  I only gave this recipe 4 stars because the leftovers degraded over time.  They were still edible but I couldn't make myself eat the final bowl.  I really should not have added as much pepper.

Pretty good! I used a whole pound of ground italian sausage to make it heartier and no carrots. I think I may add spinach or perhaps a bean next time. Really easy and delicious with garlic toast.

I have been making this recipe for about 20 years now; I change it a little every now and then but I know when I follow the recipe the taste is always consistent.  Fresh, hearty but not too filling and the leftovers (if any!) are delish :)

I would give it another star if I could! I don't like all the grease from regular sausage so I used 2 links of  the Tofurky Italian sausage with sun-dried tomatoes and basil. I sub the regular tomatoes with a can of petite tomatoes with basil and oregano. Left out the wine and the water and went with all beef broth instead. Did everything else as stated!!  Highly recommended!!

Awesome soup! I made pretty well as written other than using a can of diced tomatoes because I didn't have enough fresh ones. My only complaint is that there wasn't really enough sausage (for our tastes anyways). Next time I will use two or 3 links.

Made this the first time and doubled it.  Used canned diced tomatoes instead and some salt to taste.  Everyone said it was the best soup they ever had and went back for second and 3rd helpings.  Super hearty and perfect for a cold winter day.  This is an awesome recipe!

Just finished making and eating this soup. It tasted really great.  It was easy to make, which was a plus.. We will be making it again. I didn't have any fresh tomatoes, so I used one large can of diced tomatoes.  When I went shopping  I forgot to get a green pepper, so I put in  chopped  celery instead.  Every thing else was according to the recipe.

Good soup. You can skip the pasta and add more veggies if you want -- that's what I did. Added spinach, green beans and peas, and skipped the zucchini. Used canned tomatoes, doubled the sausage and threw in a pinch of red pepper flakes. Very yummy.

Ive made this recipe a few times. My boyfriend who hates veggies absolutely loves this soup. I also tweak my recipes so that's the only reason this got 4 stars. I don't like to rate a 5 if I have changed anything. Basically I add about 7-10 different vegetables,  whatever I have on hand (spinach,peppers,kidney beans, zucchini, carrots etc) and omit the red wine because I never usually have any. My family loves it and its a great meal on a cold Canadian day. Thanks for this recipe and all the tips that comes with it.

Followed recipe except that I used 2 sausages instead of one and will add a 3rd next time. Would also be good over bowtie pasta instead of tortellini.

Love this recipe I altered it just a bit by adding a little bit of Trader Joes soy chorizo with the sausage and a bit of pureed sweet potatoe to the broth which I add to almost everything to add a little bit of vitamins to our diet while adding a bit of richness.

Hands down, the best soup I have ever had. Beyond restaurant quality. I followed other reader's advice and added potatoes and spinach. I also added 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder and triple the amount of garlic. Also put 1 lb. of sausage in and 24 ounces of tortellini. Very hearty and filling! Perfect recipe! Thanks for sharing!

I made this for a soup and salad social and had everyone asking for the recipe.  I used stewed italian tomatoes to make it easier the second time and I couldn't tell a difference.

I was surprised at how hearty this soup was. The only problem is that 1 3.5 ounce sausage is not at all enough for a sausage soup. Aside from that, this soup is great.

We love this recipe - although we use an entire package of italian sausage with casings removed and broken up.  It gives it a great flavor with every bite.

So my wonderful girlfriend got a root canal two days ago and we decided to make this soup together.  Unfortunately while we were at our local grocer her mouth started hurting again.  After taking her pain pills, she promptly took a nap.  I began cooking.  After my girlfriend woke up and ate some of the soup we both quickly agreed this is one of the best soups we have both ever tried.  I decided to add 1 1/2 links of sausage which was just the right amount in the end.  I also doubled the zucchini and carrots, because Caitlin (my gf) and myself love veggies!  I read some of the other reviews that say they didn't add the wine and they thought it turned out better.  While I disagree completely and would question how they know it wouldn't be better WITH the wine,  I fall under my same argument; I didn't try it without.  I believe the wine gives this dish new depths which it would never reach on its own.  Finally, we used the tortellini's that you find in the cold section near the butter (as opposed to the frozen tortellini's). All-in-all I would recommend this recipe to anyone who likes a great hearty soup!!!

WOW! This was so yummy! I followed someone else's suggestion and cooked the sausage on an indoor grill. I used turkey rather than traditional sausage and sliced it rather than using it ground. I also omitted the zucchini because it's not a texture I thought my family would care for. It's all gone and I can't wait to make it again!

Amazing!  It was a cold winter evening and this soup was perfect, even without the carrots (forgot at the store) and green pepper (not a fan). I went overboard on the Italian (turkey) sausage and used a pound, and a 20 pkg of fresh packaged tortellini, so it will last us for a while.

I am a big recipe follower and don't stray too much.  I used three hot italian sausages, didn't have red wine, used a can of oregano, basil and garlic diced tomatoes, not drained, and I stuck to the rest of the recipe as is.  Absolutely delicious.  The hot sausage gives it just a little bite.  Definitely going into my recipe box!!

Incredible soup!  I used Italian seasoned canned tomatoes instead of fresh, as peeling tomatoes didn't sound like fun.  The wine is a must.

Pretty good! I forgot to buy fresh parsley and parmesan cheese so maybe that is the difference between my 4 star rating and a 5 star.

I recommend using a spicier sausage for more flavor.  I used 4 plum tomatoes, 12 oz of tortellini and 3 sausage links.

This recipe is totally amazing. Sometimes I change it and use hot sausage instead of the sweet sausage and I use 1 cup of my home made salsa instead of the tomato sauce and it is good too :)

This is absolutely delicious!  I love soups, too, and I this just became our new favorite! Other than using canned tomatoes, I followed recipe exact.  My suggestion is to drain sausage on paper towels before returing to the pot to sop up the excess grease. Thanks for the recipe, Tim!

This was delicious.  My whole family loved it.  As per other reviewers, I did put more Italian sausage in the soup and I used turkey sausage instead of regular to cut down on fat/calories.  It was great!

My boyfriend and I loved it! I altered the recipe based on what I had in the kitchen: Cucumber instead of zucchini, hot Italian sausage instead of sweet, and canned diced tomatoes instead of fresh tomatoes. I used 2C chicken broth and 3C beef broth. The broth seemed a bit salty and flat during simmering, so I added some pepper, Worchester sauce, and a Tsp of honey during simmering to add flavor. Delicious!

This is a great soup!  I did make a few changes and everyone loved it.  I used 1.5lbs of hot italian sausage, doubled the rest of the ingredients.  For the tomatos I used a can of fire roasted tomatos.  Also used a 20 oz. pkg of tortellini.  Enough to feed 4 adults, 4 kids and enough for 2 people to have lunch.  Thank you for the post!

YUM YUM YUM!!! Was even better the second and third day. My husband and I love this soup. The only changes I made were minor~used canned diced tomatoes, added a red pepper that I had, and used more sausage (used bulk instead of links). I will make this again and again. Great for a fall Sunday afternoon while watching some football.

We both loved this great soup.  It has so much flavor and is so good for you.  I had sweet Italian sausage so I added about 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes.  That was the only change I made. Thanks for sharing this great recipe as it will be a monthly soup from now on.

This is a great soup.  My whole family loved it.  I made a few minor changes: I used canned tomatoes instead of fresh, and omitted the tomato sauce because of the canned tomatoes.  I omitted the green pepper just for personal preference (picky kids).  Tastes even better leftover!  Thanks for sharing.

Wow, this turned out so good- I think the only thing I changed was i used canned tomatoes in juice rather then fresh only bc they get expensive around this time....I added more tortellini too. And I only was one cup short of beef stock so i threw in a boujion cube and w one cup water and omitted the 1/3 cup that was needed.  my husbands perference would be that the veggies cook down more and add more sausage- although i added 1.5 links which i thought was good. I also added celery bc i wanted to use it up. It was perfect! Im so going to pass this one on to ppl.  Thanks alot Tim!!!

This soup was absolutly out of this world. I followed the recipe exactly except that I used a full package of hot italian sausage, a little more tortellini (frozen), and instead of fresh tomatoes I used 2 cans of basil, garlic, and oregano diced tomatoes (drained). I will definatly be making this again :)

If I could give this more stars I would. I make this all the time and we love it. I make only two changes we use canned tomatoes and instead of tortellini we make small pasta and serve the soup over it.

I made this without the sausage and it was fantastic.  So good on a cold, winter night! Oh, did not use fresh tomatoes...used fire roasted diced tomatoes.

Italian Sausage Soup with Tor…  I made this soup for "the Parents dinner" so it was kind of risky to to make a new recipe for my parents and my boyfriends, but it was amazing! Everyone stopped talking and ate every bite- you can't really beat that. The edits I made were: -I used canned tomatoes, 2 cans of italian seasoning diced and omitted the fresh tomatoes and tomato sauce -Add an extra 1/2 cup red wine -Replaced the 5 cups beef stock with : 3 cups Veggie Broth, and 2 cups beef stock -Added 1/2 of a green pepper too This was a super easy recipe, and set the stage for an amazing meal.

Wonderfull recipe.  I did however cook it differently: crockpot all day on low.  (left casings on sausages & cut up in the end) Boiled tortellini seperate and added before serving.  I did not use wine because I had none and I used canned tomato with basil and oregano because it seemed convenient.  Had company for dinner and it was a hit.

This soup was spectacular!  Even my pick 8 and 11 year old LOVED it!!!  The taste is robust and warming on a cold night!  The only change I made in lieu of time was to use canned petite tomatoes (undrained). I served w/ cheese quesadillas!  Definitely a keeper!  YUM!

This is one of the best soups I've ever made. Fairly easy too except for the chopping of veggies. I altered slightly by adding a little more italian sausage & using pre-seasoned, canned, diced tomatoes. The broth is rich and yummy! Fabulous!!

This soup was really good. The flavors and textures were great. I only made minor alterations only because I did not have fresh tomoatoes on hand. I used cans of crushed tomatoes instead. This will be a regular addition to our menu! Thank you!

Very good!  Only difference I did was instead of a regular tomato, I bought the diced tomatoes in a can with oregano and garlic with it, so I omitted the oregano (I still put the garlic in).  Also I had regular Italian sausage because I couldn't find sweet Italian sausage.  Actually I liked the spicy of the sausage better than something sweet.  It was a wonderful soup.  A keeper for sure!

Ok... I think I may have rated another similar recipe by accident...but...if not, a repeat ain't gonna hurt! This is an awesome recipe just as it is. Only thing I added was mushrooms (baby bellas) because I like 'em; used a merlot for the wine. Excellent! Will be making again and again. Everyone loved it.. the semi-Italians in the family, the rednecks, the grandkids..

WONDERFUL RECIPE!  I've made 2 batches in the past week and half!  I couldn't find sweet sausage at our Albertson's, so I used mild sausage instead.  I also used a 14.5 oz can of petite diced tomatoes instead of peeling, seeding and chopping fresh ones-much quicker when you have little ones running around!  If you're looking for a delicious, easy meal, this one is it!

Very good and very easy to make!  I skipped the zucchini simply because I forgot to put it on my grocery list.  Followed everthing else in recipe.  Used Barilla dried 3-cheese tortellini.  Added to my recipe box...definately will make again!  Thank you!

This was really delicious! I followed the recipe but unfortunately forgot to buy green peppers so I had to do without, but it was still delicious. It is different from the sausage tortellini soup my mother used to make (more tomato flavor) but I actually liked it better. I think next time I make it I may add a little more sausage, but it was otherwise perfect. I would definately recommend!!

This is now one of my favorite soup recipes. I like to add baby spinach and sometimes some lentils. I don't care for Italian sausage, so I brown a roll of Jimmy Dean's sage sausage instead

This recipe was a tremendous hit.  Great flavor and combination of vegetable.  I will cook this ahead without the tortellini and freeze.  After thawing, I will add tortellini and simmer a few minutes until pasta is done.

This soup is AWESOME. I made it according to the directions and loved it, but my husband thought there were too many different chunks in it. So the second time I tried cooking the onions for much longer until they carmelized. Then I puree'd the carrots with the tomatoes, tomato sauce, fresh basil, and wine. I dumped that puree in with the sausage & onions, then sprinkled the oregano in. I followed the recipe for the rest. It turned out perfect. Thanks!!!!

I had a house full of teenagers the night I made this soup.  They stayed in the kitchen and all but drove me crazy waiting for this to be ready! They kept putting their noses over the pot and inhaling the "flavor explosion" and asked over a hunderd times how much longer before its ready?! Needless to say, it was all gone in minutes! Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe was very, very good.  The only change I made was to use a whole pound (4 links) of italian sausage instead of just one link.  I also used portobella mushroom tortellini.  Great recipe, will definitely use again, over and over!

Fantastic!  I've used fresh refrigerated tortellini and had excellent results each time (made this about 5 times now); so I'm not sure what problems the other reviewers are having with tortellini.  I follow the basic recipe, and have added everything from peppers to beans to corn to any other veggie I have in my fridge.  Raves from family and friends, and this is now my favorite soup.  Thank you Tim!

Excellent soup. If you go to **Italian Sausage Soup with Tortellini ** Submitted by: Mary P -- you will see this exact recipe with a half a cup of water listed in the ingredients.  Really odd how two of the same recipes are in allrecipes - hadn't noticed that before.

Oh WOW! This is wonderful! I used mild Italian sausage,which was still kind of spicy- and I forgot the bell pepper and parmesan.I also used my regular dried parsley, and Italian Seasoning. You don't need any extra salt or pepper unless you're into lots of it. It is really yummy just as written. I would say to use 16 oz. of tortellini though, maybe because we like them! I used the frozen cheese tortellini, and I did thicken it a little with a Tb. of cornstarch mixed with a tsp. of water.  Served with lots of crusty French bread and butter, Hubby ate two bowlsful!! We plan to serve this to our friends soon!!!!!!!!!!!!

Delicious!  Great flavor.  I made a huge pot full and tripled the recipe with turkey Italian sausage. I added some crushed red pepper and that’s it.  Perfect as is.  Will see how it freezes and reheats.

Delicious!  I didn't add zucchini, as the market didn't have any (surprising) and only one chopped tomato. My husband and I both loved it!  And so easy to make!

I just made this soup for tonight's dinner and had a sample spoon....which turned into a sample bowl!!! Amazing w/o the cheese tortellini I will be adding tonight before dinner. My only changes were, I use 3/4 lb mild Italian sausage and 3/4 lb hot italian sausage, 6 cups of beef stock and a chopped red pepper, because it's what we had on hand. AMAZING!! Thank you for the recipe Tim, this is a keeper.
UPDATE! I  made this again last weekend, tripled the recipe for a family dinner, served with salad and crusty French bread, not a drop was left over and I think everyone had at least two servings, including 6 children. What a great recipe!

My husband made this soup last night. Our second time with this recipe. It is one of our favorite soups. 
It is full of flavor and fills you up. 
Perfect meal for a cold rainy night.

I didn't have zucchini or bell pepper and forgot to add carrots and parsley and it came out delicious. Just finished my third bowl, so good...thanks for the great soup, just in time for the cold weather.

Fixed this tonight and it was a hit! Easy enough to throw together after work; hearty enough that no one knew that it was easy!  I did add a few more vegetables than the recipe called for--I increased the carrots and zucchini and added chopped cabbage.

I made this for several adults and it was a huge hit. Changes were small: Spicy sausage (and a lot more than it calls for), thick spiral noodles instead of tortellini because I'm lactose intolerant, and an added jalapeno.

I really liked this recipe! I found the measurements to be off and added more stock then called for. Also, I added some more seasoning and will probably add even more next time, but that's just the way I like my food. Great recipe! Can't wait to make it again!!

This soup was great! I shared some with my Mom and Dad and my mother has not stopped telling my siblings what a great cook I am. The only thing I did different based on several posts was I cooked the tortellini separately and added it before serving the soup . Perfect! Thanks for a great soup recipe.

Great soup!  Used beef broth (all I had), but also used a can of beef consomme - that really kicked up the flavor!  used 2 links sweet and one link hot sausage (we like sausage!).  And red instead of green pepper.  Also added spinach last 5 minutes (love it in soup) and kept the tortellini separate til serving.  Easy and delish!

This recipe was very good. I modified the recipe by using about three ounces of the sausage, about four cups of beef broth, 1-1/3 cups of water, and threw everything in at the same time--all the veggies, liquids, and herbs minus the parsley and tortellini. However, because I used a cup less beef broth than was called for in the recipe, the soup didn't have as much body and needed about 1/8 teaspoon of salt. The next ime I make this soup, I'll definitely cook the tortellini pasta separately, as it was dried, and throw it in about five or ten minutes before serving.

In spite fo the fact I didn't follow the method to the letter, it turned out great and would make a superb main dish.

Great Soup Recipe, the only thing I did different was throw everything but the tortellini in my slow cooker. I then put the tortellini in an hour before serving. It turned out great.

Delicious!  I made this with hot italian sausage and the spice really added a nice warming kick to this soup.  I made this with Michael's easy foccacia bread also from this site (another reviewer recommended it) and it was a fantastic and satisfying dinner.  Highly recommend.

This was really good! By the way, the recipe doesn't specify what kind of tortellini to use. I would guess since it says to cook it another 10 minutes that they mean frozen. I think fresh would cook more quickly, and dried takes a good bit longer. Also, if you use dried you might need to add more liquid.  We did change it somewhat. We've discovered we don't much like beef soups, so I subbed chicken broth for the beef. My son begged me to leave out the carrots, so I did. And I used diced canned tomatoes instead of fresh - much quicker. I also put in 3 links of hot Italian sausage - that's what I had - and a lot more tortellini - love it!  It really did have great flavor, and we'll be making it again for sure! It was really good with cornbread, but I'm looking forward to trying it with the Squash Braid on this site.

This was great! I sauteed the green pepper in with the onion and garlic. Then I deglazed the pan with the wine and then added the rest of the wet ingredients. I used half beef stock and chicken stock and 1 14oz can of petite diced tomatoes in garlic and olive oil. I didn't have totellini so I used mini cheese raviollis. I didn't use carotts or zuchini. Great on a cold Iowa winter day.

My Husband LOVED this!  He actually said Thank You!  I too made some modifications.  Doubling the recipe, I used Italian Seasoning for the Basil & Oregano, and I used a full jar of Spaghetti Sauce instead of tomato sauce.  I will definately make this again!

Made this recipe a few times!  Incredible!  This is a staple soup in our house!  I do add the zucchini last so it still has some bite!

I made this soup yesterday.  I followed the recipe exactly.  There is no reason to change a thing.  This is a very delicious soup.  I believe the fresh tomatoes and the wine are essential to the depth of flavor in the base.  My family loved it and I will be making this soup regularly.

Very good soup! I used hot italian sausage, added a package of chopped spinach and 1 cup of corn. It was very hearty. Will make again and again.

Delicious. We reduced the green pepper and added mushrooms. Also kept the zucchini in larger pieces so it didn't "melt away" while simmering.

This was delish! The only things I did differently was put in a can of diced tomatoes instead of chopping the 4 fresh tomatoes...I didn't have those on hand. And I added the green peppers along with the carrots so they would cook down a little bit more.My husband and I ate about half and then I froze the rest for a rainy day!

Simply wonderful even without sausage! I didn't add any italian sausage because I don't really like meaty soups. I followed the recipe exactly (well I added a 2 stalks of celery & corn and used stewed italian tomatoes instead)... wowza. I will make this every week! It's that good...

This is the most awesome soup!  I think we may overload on it.  If you want to make it lower fat, use turkey kielbasa and use a pound of it to make it more flavorful, we also subbed whole wheat tortellini and it was good but the regular is a nicer texture for the soup.  Fantastic recipe with cornbread, made it for book club and my family and they keep asking for more!

This is an awesome soup! I only made a couple of changes because I didn't have all of the ingredients on hand. I used spicy Italian sausage, canned tomatoes, frozen spinach and added a can of drained kidney beans. I didn't have any zucchini but it was still great. Served with garlic bread it was very filling.

I just made this soup and it's really good with a few modifications of my own. First of all I used 1/2 pkg. of Bob Evans Roll Sweet Italian Sausage.I browned it and then removed it from the pan. It had no grease to it. I added 1 tbs. olive oil to the pan and sauted the onions and garlic. I then added the beef stock (5 1/2)cups and no wine. I used to cans of chopped tomatoes instead of fresh. I simmered the first ingredients for 40 minutes cause the carrots needed it. I increased the basil and oregano to 3/4 tsp and also added 2 tbs. sugar. Also I used a whole pkg. 9 ounces of Buitoni 3-cheese tortellini. I would cook it for 9 minutes on the side then add it to the soup. It comes out better that way. I will definitely be making this soup again. Thanks Tim!

This was delicious but I made some changes:  I used 4 mild italian turkey sausages instead of 1 pork, I used 4 cloves of garlic, chicken broth instead of beef, 29 oz of diced tomatoes (undrained) instead of fresh tomatoes and I added about 1 tsp of dried red pepper flakes.  I also added about a whole 10-oz package of frozen spinach.  Very filling.

This soup was fantastic. I added red peppers with the green. Our 4 & 6-year olds loved the tortellini and managed to eat the veggies too! I would not change a thing though...recipe was perfect.

Very good and flavorful. I used Trader Joe's sundried tomato & basil chicken sausage instead of pork sausage - a bit healthier and there was really no fat from browning the chicken sausage. I forgot the green pepper and didn't really miss it!

I have made this recipe 3 times now.  It is the best.  I made it for a group of my girlfriends for a party I hosted and every one of them asked for the recipe.  

Even better, my husband loves this soup.  I usually vary it a little depending on what I have on hand.  I use white wine sometimes instead of red and I also use dried parsley if I don't have any fresh on hand.  My family doesn't appreciate spicy pepper or sausage but I add red pepper flakes to my bowl.  Love, love, love this soup.

This recipe is pretty good. I didn't like the brand of tortellini that my grocery store offered for this soup. Perhaps this would taste better with fresh instead of dried packaged tortellini or just plain pasta. I've got to try making this again.

YUM!  My kids each had 3 bowls!  I used fresh,packaged whole wheat cheese ravioli, canned tomatoes, and added fresh corn off the cob (had some left over from last night's cook out) and fresh basil just before serving.  I also used homemade chicken broth that I had in the freezer, instead of beef.  I added a dash of chili powder and crushed red pepper because the grocery store was out of spicy Italian sausage, which I wanted to use instead of sweet.  This was tasty and healthy!  Looking forward to tomorrow's leftovers! I will make this often.

This rating for my family was really more of a 3.5 star.  We prefer thicker soups, so I omitted the water 1 cup broth.  Flavor wise I honestly thought it was lacking.  It wasn't until my husband added chili powder and onion salt to his bowl that I was really wowed.  This seems more like a minestrone...if you love minestrone, you'll love this.

This is awesome. I used italian turkey sausage to make it a little more healthy, and threw in baby spinach and celery, which were in my fridge. Instead of fresh tomatoes which have been pricey lately, I used canned diced tomatoes. This is very good with a loaf of italian bread.

This is an awesome soup!I left out the peeled/seeded tomatoes and used my own homemade beef stock. I got WONDERFUL reviews, even from people who are not big soup eaters. I get a lot of requests for this. Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

This was my first homemade soup and it was great!!!!  I don't eat red meat or pork, so I used spicy chicken italian sausage and 4 c vegetable broth and 1 c chicken broth instead of the beef broth.  It was great the night I made it and just got better the next day!

My family and I really enjoyed this soup. I used ground spicy sausage. It saved me the trouble of removing the casing. I added a few extra veggies.Easy to prepare.Easy to clean up.   This is a keeper.

I doubled the recipe because of the reviews I read and I LOVED IT!  This soup is VERY TASTY.  Used fire roasted tomatoes instead of fresh tomatoes and 3 sweet Italian sausages, Next time when I double the recipe I think I'll use the whole pound of Italian sausages.  I served with it french bread and it hit the spot.  I agree with other reviewers, could easily add corn, beans or whatever else that tickles my fancy.  I will definately make this soup again.

This is a wonderful, hearty "stoup", and I love the italian flare!  I used about 1/2 lb hot italian sausage, and added all of the veggies after browning for a saute.  I deglazed that with some marsala and red wines, and added a can of stewed tomatoes and a small can of tomatoe juice in place of the fresh and tomatoe sauce.  I used low salt beef broth throughout, and used only 4 oz tortellini.  Lots of pepper, parmesean cheese on top, crusty bread, and a glass of chianti.  Now that's dinner!

Oh, my, I'm in love with this soup! Fantastic! So many different levels of flavor. I used chicken stock (I was out of beef), and switched out red and yellow peppers for green, because I like them better. This will definitely be one I will make again. Next time I'll try the original call for beef stock.

Thank you! This soup was very good. I doubled the recipe so we could have left-overs the next day. I did add extra tortellini and extra seasoning, added a can of white beans, omitted the zucchini (didn't have any), used canned Italian stewed tomatoes, and added only half a green pepper. Very hearty. Will be making again this winter! Thanks again Tim!

This soup was really good. Don't omit the wine- this adds so much delicious flavor that you can't get from anything else. We used chicken italian sausage, and cut it up very small. I noted that the recipe states 3.5 oz of sausage, but I used a 14oz package of italian sausage- and it was perfect.

excellent soup!  i added a few cups of extra water because it was so savory (and i wanted more!) it didn't dilute the flavor too much at all.  highly recommended.

This soup is absolutely excellent! I had it at a friend's house and shortly after she gave me the recipe I found it on this site. I used turkey Italian Sausage because I prefer it and I left out the green pepper. If you plan to freeze any of it or make it ahead, don't add the tortellini until you're ready to serve it, as it becomes soggy.

I served this at as the beginning course for a dinner party for 10. I cut down on the sausage and added more broth. I didn't want it to be too filling.  Even the picky eaters loved this recipe. It makes a great left over meal too!!

I got this recipe  from here in 2001.  This is by far my favorite soup.   This soup has always been a crowd pleaser.  I like to spice it up by using a hot Italian sausage instead of sweet and add extra tortellini.

This is one of the best soups recipes. Make sure you use good quality tortellini so it will not fall apart in the soup.

Very good.  I was looking for a recipe to use up some tortellini I had on hand.  I did use Jimmy Dean sausage instead of Italian sausage and added a little extra broth.

Fantastic!  Definitely 5 star.  I did follow the recipe for the most part with the exception of the following changes.  I doubled the recipe and I added more sausage, around 1/2 lb more.  I used  a 29oz can of diced tomatoes with juice instead of fresh tomatoes and tomato sauce  and I threw in a bag of frozen spinach because I didn't have zucchini.   I made 2lbs of tortellini and followed other reviewers suggestions and did not add them to the soup but instead kept them in a separate bowl so they would not get mushy in the soup. Oh, and I did add a couple of shakes of red pepper flakes because we like a little zing!
This soup is a complete meal.  No need to make anything else to go with it other than a loaf of crusty Italian bread.
 Will definitely make again but I think next time I will use 1/2 sweet sausage and 1/2 hot sausage.

Simple, yet soooooo delish! I made this to the letter and it turned out perfectly! The flavors melded to make it even better the next day! I will make this again for certain but perhaps adding more sausage and mixing sweet and hot.

I can't have bell peppers, so I omitted that ingredient, and I was out of Italian sausage, so I used chicken tortellini.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly as written - and we LOVE it!  It's a keeper.

This soup was awesome! I made a few changes but nothing that would have significantly changed the flavor: I used almost one pound of ground italian sausage, 2 cans diced tomatoes, yellow pepper instead of green, didn't have any wine so added more water, used 16 oz of dried tortellini, and stirred in 2 big handfuls of fresh, roughly chopped spinach at the very end for a few minutes. I will be making this again!

I have been making a recipe similar to this for many years.  My recipe calls for one pound Italian sausage links (someone stated it didn't have enough sausage) and two cups chopped tomatoes.  I usually replace the wine with water.  It is one of our favorite soups.

This is a great recipe and its even better as leftovers. My family likes everything with a kick so I added some chili powder and extra pepper (the hubs and kids still wanted more pepper after they tried it.) It's perfect! Totally going into my regular recipe rotation!

For the length of time it takes - really quick - it's excellent and hearty. I omitted chopped tomatoes, zucchini and parsley, used fresh basil, substituted red for green pepper, and added some coriander. Yum!

This is a great recipe! I substituted the zucchini for Brussels sprouts and left out the wine! I sautéed the Brussels sprouts with the onions and garlic so they had more time to cook and they came out just right. I also only did 3 cups of broth substituting the remaining 2 cups with additional water. I would definitely make this again!

I have made this several times, I absolutely love it!  I use traderJoe's chicken basil and tomato sausage... about 1/2 pound.  Most of the time I do not add the green bell pepper.  The wine adds so much to the flavor!

Great soup! With a salad and bread you have a complete meal. I have made with and without the wine. My husband liked it both ways, but I leave it out for company, because not everyone likes soups prepared with wine.  I have also used fresh tomatoes, canned tomatoes and a combination of the two. All provide a nice result. I do not use the zucchini as it is not a favorite in my family. Instead I substitute spinach, either fresh or frozen depending on what I have on hand.  Very forgiving recipe that you can adapt to your tastes without the recipe suffering. This soup is always well received. Thanks to Tim for posting it.

Absolutely delicious!!! I was looking for something I could make with what I already had, or close enough to just need to swap a few things out. I used frozen onion and refrigerated minced garlic, Italian sausage already ground up (can't remember the brand but it's a national name brand), canned sliced carrots, a can of diced tomatoes, and substituted dried cheese ravioli for the tortellini. 

I used the same ounce weight of dried ravioli as recommended for the tortellini, but should have only used half because it sucked up most of the broth. Other than my mistake it was INSANELY DELICIOUS!!!! Will definitely make again!

I made as directed, except, left out wine- didn't have any, and added 1 can extra broth. I also added 1 lb. of halved portabella baby mushrooms and added 2 sprigs of thyme which I took out 1/2 way through cooking. I also added a package or dried porcini mushroom tortellini. MMMMM..... was so good on a cold, snowy evening, in front of the fire....

Excellent recipe! I do agree with others that if this is being made during a time when tomatoes are not in season, using canned tomatoes is a time saver.

Hands down the best soup I have ever had. I doubled the cheese tortellini and froze the leftovers.  It was better after I took out of the freezer and reheated. My son-in-law devoured a great deal of this soup in one meal.  So happy I found and tried this recipe and thank you to whomever conjured it up. Yum!

The only changes I made, were that I used a 15 oz can of tomatoes sauce and a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes with garlic & basil. I also used about 3/4 of a cup of wine.  The soup was delicious. Will make this often.

I made this recipe for a dozen ladies and they all loved it! I added the pasta in the bottom of the bowl so that it was not over done, otherwise followed the recipe as directed. Rich broth with depth from the addition  of red wine! Will make again, thanks Tim.

Only changes made were I used chili sauce instead of tomato sauce and  canned diced tomatoes instead of fresh, and kielbasa instead of sausage, only because I didn't have them. Turned out great.

I did not use any zucchini and used a can of stewed tomatoes.  A dash of red pepper flakes gave it a kick.  Fresh grated parmesan cheese to finish.  Excellent!

One of my families favorite soups now.  I don't use wine and I don't dilute it with water either.  I use v8 juice instead of water.    Soooo good.  My grandson says it's his favorite soup.

I used scimecca's mild ground italian sausage and also added a little frozen spinach  and used yellow and zucchini squash. I make this soup about three or four times a year whether it is summer or winter and it's always a hit with family and friends.

We really enjoyed this!  I only had Herb Chicken Tortellini on hand but I'm sure Cheese Tortellini would have been better.  I skipped the Zucchini, Bell Pepper, and Parsley because we aren't fans, but I added Spinach during the last 5 minutes of cooking.  Great Meal!

this is excellent! my family doesn't like soup, but I do, so once in a while I get to make a pot. they LOVED this one! it was pretty easy, the most time consuming thing to me was chopping everything up. I used one can of slightly drained diced tomatoes instead of the 4 tomatoes called for in ingredient list. I also don't drink wine often, but found a small bottle of cabernet sauvignon so that was nice instead of buying a big bottle to be wasted. I have never cooked with wine either, but know that the alcohol cooks out. it had such an amazing flavor added!! I wouldn't skip it!!! thanks for sharing this recipe, I am so gonna make it again! :)

Best soup I've ever made! I added spinach, mushrooms & white kidney beans. I substituted tomatoes with a regular can of diced tomatoes, and still used a small can of can of sauce. And I used hot Italian sausage to give it some kick and It was simply amazing! Tons of left overs. I will be making this again!

My family said it was BETTER than Olive Garden!  I did change a few things out of necessity.  I only used 1 medium size flat white onion;4 cups of beef broth and 2 cups of vegetable broth and omitted the zucchini. I added a pinch more spices and used fresh flat leaf parsley.  I would have taken a picture but the family couldn't wait to eat, the aroma permeated the house!  Thanks for the delicious soup!

This was a very good recipe, hearty and filling. My only complaint is that the flavor was too understated for my taste. I feel like it needed some red pepper or something. Anyway, will definitely make it again.

This was a delicious soup and both me and my husband loved it!  I followed the recipe except I didn't have red wine so added a Tbsp of Worcestershire sauce and didn't have a zucchini so omitted it.  I used hot italian sausage to give it a kick, a can of diced tomatoes and instead of tomato sauce I used up some leftover spaghetti sauce.  I served this with crusty French bread and butter; it was a great, filling meal for a cold day.

Loved it! This was one of the most flavorful recipes I've ever made. I served this with corn bread or oyster crackers.

I did do a few things differently: 

I used about 54 oz of beef broth, and it perfectly fed 6 of us in regular-sized soup bowls. I dd just now realize I left out the 1/3 c of water by accident, though!

I always look at the less postitive reviews first here on AllRecipes to know what to watch out for. Because my husband doesn't like tomatoes, I left out the tomatoes and the sauce, also because I didn't think I needed them anyway. I did add an extra sausage, and both sausages were cut up, casing on, because I wanted pieces to munch on. I also used fresh everything including basil. I couldn't find fresh oregano, or else I would have used that as well.

My dad said, "Definitely a keeper recipe!" and he doesn't get excited about many things like that!

We tried this for supper tonight with spicy Italian sausage and it was fantastic. The spicy sausage gave it an extra kick. Putting the bulk of the veggies in with tortellini is great. They stay a little crunchy. For sure this is going to stay in my regular rotation of soups.

This recipe was great! The whole family loved it and it warmed us all up on a frigid night. The only thing we did different was used canned tomatoes and add more Italian sausage.

This was very good and well liked in my family. I made it according to the directions and when I tasted it at the end it felt like it needed just a little kick. I tossed in a healthy pinch of crushed red pepper flakes and some fresh ground black pepper and it was perfect. Definitely will be making it again.

This recipe is fabulous!!!!! I've made it now for over a year for multiple friends and family and I haven't heard a complaint yet. I always add extra sausage and tortellini.  You must try it if you haven't yet.

This soup is beyond AWESOME!!  So delicious!! Definitely use beef stock instead of broth. It makes all the difference in the world.  I will definitely double the recipe next time and freeze some!  Absolutely perfect for a chilly fall or winter day!!

I was concerned as I have never used Italian sausage in soup. This soup was delicious and hearty!
I used hot Italian sausage as we like spicy food and a can of fire roasted tomatoes instead of fresh. Served with a rustic bread! DELISH! Thank you!

Made this last night! AWESOME! Doubled the recipe and having leftovers tonight. Would freeze really well! Used an entire package of Sweet Italian Sausage (six links casings removed), replaced carrots with zucchini (3 one red and one green pepper, one 1/2 package frozen spinach (added with the tortellini), one jar of marinara and one can of Italian seasoned diced tomatoes including juice (replaced tomato sauce and water), for beef stock I used Better than Bullion Beef flavor and two 13ish oz bags of frozen tricolor tortellini. Topped with freshly grated Parmesan cheese... super flavorful, very filling and didn't need to add any extra salt/pepper. The only thing I might do differently next time is put cooked carrots, zucchini and spinach in the food processor with a little broth and add it to soup. I love the chunks of veggies but my son picks them out...he'll never know!

Tasty and delicious! I just used sausage that was already uncased and I also left out the wine because I didn't feel like uncorking an entire bottle. My boyfriend DUG this, he ate four bowls three hours after getting his galbladder removed. Hungry guy, I guess.

Basically good, but could be better.  DO NOT use hot sausage!!  I did and, although my husband loved it, I could hardly eat it.  Use the fresh pasta.  The dried never really tastes right in this.

Really delicious soup, but make sure you put the green peppers in at the same time as the carrots or they will not be cooked.  Also, add about 20 minutes to your simmering time unless you like your veggies crunchy.

Amazing!!!! I changed it up a tiny bit. Instead of 8of tortellini, I used a 19oz bag of frozen tortellini. I also did not use 4 tomatoes, I used 2 cans of petete cut tomatoes. Instead of 2 cloves of garlic, I added 3 and I also spiced it up a tiny bit by adding some red pepper. This is a favorite in my house!!!!

Great recipe! My husband is a very picky eater. No onions, tomatoes, mushrooms etc.. So to cook for him I make some adjustments. I followed pretty much everything, except I used onion powder instead of onions. He likes the flavor but not the chunks..I also took out the tomatoes and zuccini. I think I didn't have enough liquid or I cooked it for too long, because it came out more like a pasta dish, but my husband liked it better that way. And so did my 3 yr old. I topped it with some parm cheese and oregano, a little fresh parsley and they ate it up like crazy! Have been making regularly ever since.

A delicious hearty soup, well deserving 5 stars.  I used canned diced tomatoes for convenience,and added a couple of teaspoons of white sugar.  My daughter has made this soup without the red wine, and still found it is very, very good.  Serve with a fresh loaf of crusty bread -bella.

Awesome recipe!! I spiced things up by replacing the fresh tomatoes with medium salsa, used hot italian sausage, omitted the wine, added a 1 tsp of crushed red peppers. I would definitely make this again!!

This was absolutely delicious! Personally, I find it's better if you subsitute large seashell noodles for the tortellini, but it's great either way. Even my kids ate it!

This recipe kicked arse!  We had a vintage bottle of tuscany red we had to drink in the middle of winter.  Obviously time are not the best so we wanted to drink it with friends during the cold winter and have something that fit.  Everyone loved the wine and loved this dinner alongside.  The only audible we pulled was to use turkey sausage instead of sweet italian.

EXCELLENT! FULL OF FLAVOR! However, I used homemade beef stock. I simmer the beef bones on the stove for 3-4 days with veggies of all kinds and herbs and freeze it in 1 cup cubes for soup and different recipes. I did not use the wine and didn't miss it at all. I used 1 gt.jar of home canned tomatoes with the liquid instead of adding the 1/3 c. water. I also added about 1 1/2 - 2 lbs. Italian sausage and upped the carrots to 2-3 cups. I used fresh/frozen basil from my summer garden, about 1 3/4 tbsp. and instead of tortellini I use organic gnocchi. Oh and I also added 2 tsp. celtic sea salt. Yum! Even my picky husband and son went for seconds. I also made a loaf of "squash braid" bread (also from this site) with the leftover squash that I had from last night's dinner and it went terific with the soup. Definitely a winner! I am already starting another pot to send over to a friend that just had a baby.

Really good - I added baby bella mushrooms, corn, and baby spinach.  I used half pound of hot italian sausage which gave it some kick.  If you don't like spice, stick with the sweet italian sausage.

Delicious!! (and easy) my 2 teenage stepsons had seconds!
I added mushrooms and will probably substitute asparagus for the bell pepper next time.
I also used more sausage than called for - a whole pkg. of chicken italian sausage (from Trader Joe's) - all 5 links for 8 servings.

Love this soup! The only change I made was to use 1 lb of Italian turkey sausage instead of just the one regular Italian sausage. I wouldn't have needed a whole lb but used it because I bought a pkg. I really liked the flavors of the red wine and beef broth, and all those veggies just made the soup. Thank you!

This recipe is so good, smooth but tasty! I made a little change for my son as he prefers smooth soup. I took a portion and put it in the blender before I boiled the tortellini. All of us love it very much. Thank you!

Yummy!  I used parsley and cheese italian sausage, skipped the green peppers and red wine just for personal taste and this turned out great!  It came together quickly and I can't wait to have the leftovers for lunch.  MUST serve crusty bread with this one.  Thanks for sharing!

This soup was very good.  I used 5 hot/spicy italian sausage links, 2 zucchini instead of the carrots and extra broth instead of wine. I also added fresh ground pepper and red pepper flakes.  The tortelli that I used had a strong cheese flavor that I didn't care for initially.  Next time I will probably use bow tie pasta. Overall this was very easy to make (it's the first soup I've made) and it was excellent.

Easy delicious recipe.  I don't particularly like making soups because I find I get tired of them (there are only two of us in the house) before everything's gone, but this one is an exception.

This is a big hit everytime I make it. My husband, who never eats leftovers, will actually eat it reheated. We follow the recipe almost exactly, only substituing diced tomatoes for fresh ones and spicy sausage for mild.

Awesome Recipe! Doubled the sausage amount. Also used half a 14 oz. can of diced tomatoes with onion and green peppers in place of fresh tomatoes.  I'm sure you could throw in any fresh veggies you have on hand.  Served with warmed sour dough bread and butter.  Just Yummy!  Thanks for a great dinner!

I've made this several times now and it is always a big hit.  A couple of small changes - I used about 3/4 lb of Italian sausage, canned whole tomatoes instead of fresh and added some crushed red pepper flakes.  I also increased the amount of water and beef stock to make up for the extra sausage.  A real winner!!

This is the most flavorful soup I've ever made! The only thing I did different was to use Hot Italian Sausage (I used 4 links  because I read the recipe wrong) and it tasted great. I also used vegetable & chicken broth instead of beef, but one thing I would NOT substitute is the use of fresh veggies and herbs - YUM!

This was really, really good.  I used 2 14oz cans of diced tomatoes, ground, hot italian sausage and celery instead of carrots.  My mother-in-law couldn't stop raving about how good the soup was.

what a great recipe.  this was perfect for the cool fall days right before a high school football game.  i made a double batch for my entire family and they all raved about it till it was all gone.  my very picky and opinionated father told me i need to make this recipe more often.  I can't wait to try adding some fresh baby spinach.

I used a can of whole tomotoes instead of fresh. This was really good but I made the mistake of adding more tortellini which made it a bit too dry. Also could have used more sausage.

Very good, I did however have to add chili powder, cumin and a dash of salt, then again I used turkey sauage rather than italian sauage. Very hearty soup overall.  WIll make again.

ok... so I just made a batch of this for my husband and my lunches for the week.  I tasted a little and I am blown away!  I'm only wishing that I had some wine to put in it (used a little extra stock).  I'm looking forward to tasting it tomorrow, once its had some time to sit.  I added a fair bit more oregano and basil, and some crushed red peppers.  Wow!

My husband really liked this soup.  We aren't fans of sweet Italian sausage, so I used spicy instead.  The extra spice made this the perfect soup for a cold winter night.

I forgot the tomatoes and the zucchini and this was still great.  I increased the amount of tortellini (1 pound was a little much), but both me and my boyfriend loved this recipe.  FYI - grocery stores are beginning to carry smaller servings of wine (kind of like juice boxes or single serving bottles), so that is always a good alternative if you don't normally drink wine.  I like the heavy taste of a Cabernet Sauvignon in this recipe.  My next choices would be a Merlot or a Shiraz.  I think a Pinot Noir would be too sweet.

Very good basic recipe, lends itself quite well to adjustments depending on what is in the pantry and fridge. I used chicken sausage which had very little fat and had to add a bit of olive oil to get the onions and garlic sauteed. Tossed in leftover greenbeans and a can of white beans instead of zucchini and pepper. I chunked the sausage instead of removing it from the casing, but I wouldn't advise that, the large pieces were awkward.

Good soup. I used mild Italian sausage and added some sugar. I also used canned diced tomatoes (three cans). Instead of zucchini, I put in frozen yellow squash, otherwise everything was the same. A very hearty soup. This made a lot. Served with French bread.

This was a HUGE hit in any incarnation.  I've switched the veggies depending upon what I had (carrots were gone, for example, had rabe and tossed some in) ... even used stewed tomatoes during a snowstorm when I was out of enough fresh.  WONDERFUL pantry recipe!

Soup doesn't even do it justice, this is a meal. Like some of the others I add what ever vegies on hand, to make it really simple I use jar of spaghetti sause and one or two fresh tomatos it really is better with fresh tomatos I have tryed it without. We all so love this, even my picky 9 year old.

This was sooooo good!!  I made a few substitutions based on what I had on hand.  I used canned diced tomatoes instead of fresh.  Omitted the zucchini because I didn't have any and used a package of dried tortillini with cheese and garlic. I used approximately 1 lb sausage instead of one link.   And 1/4 cup cooking wine.  I don't think it altered the taste at all.  My husband even liked it and he is a pretty picky eater.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  I will be making this often this winter.

GREAT SOUP.  Very hearty and flavorful.  I will be making this again for guests.  Served this with crusty french bread and a salad.  The only change I made is that I used (2) sausages and 5 cloves of garlic for more flavor.  Try this recipe and you'll get many compliments.

This soup was delicious. As previous reviews said, I don't think that tortellini was the best choice of pasta. I think that I will use bow-tie next time.

This was great. My husband, who is not a soup lover, told me that I need to make this more often. I didn't have tortellini's so I used 1/2 pound of bow tie pasta instead, diced tomatoes instead of fresh, and 4 links of italian sausage instead of 1 because it didn't sound like enough. Very good. Thanks

This was great!  I did use 12 oz. of sausage (3.5 just didn't seem enough) and I was glad that I did.  Other than that, it was perfect and I will gladly make it again!

Wow! I used hot turkey sausage(2 links), fresh spinich torn, one can white beans drained instead of zucchini and green pepper.. Simmered two hours, added tortellini, 20 minutes later dinner was done. Next time i will either 1/2 or leave out wine, don't think it added that much to flavor. Did not improve as a leftover, very surprising. Very filling soup, good dinner.

This is absolutely the best soup ever.  I use beef consumme instead of beef broth.  I makes it a bit more flavorable.  Everyone who has tried this has asked me for the recipe.  Five stars for this is not enough!

broth was delicious.... but I don't think that the tortellini goes too well with it, maybe some other type of pasta.

This was an easy healthy recipe.  My family loved it. It was hearty and comforting. It fit the need on a very busy night. Served with a salad it is definitely a keeper.

Very Very delicious soup. Even my husband (who is not a soup person) loved it and wants me to make it again. This is now my favorite soup and I will make it often.

This is definitely a five star recipe.  My husband raved about it!  I did substitute two cans diced tomates with the juice in place of the tomatoes.  I also omitted the wine and carrots.
