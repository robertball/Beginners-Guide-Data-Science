Quick & Easy.  Didn't have crescent rolls so I used Grand biscuits.  I pulled the biscuits apart so I would have double the amount and layed them across the top.  Used two 28oz jars spaghetti sauce & doubled the mozarella cheese.   Also added 1/2 c. romano cheese.   Baked 30 minutes till brown.  Recipe has a lot of potential for other pizza topping additions depending on your taste.  May even try pizza sauce next time.

This recipe was absolutely delicious, quick and so easy!  I followed the recipe as written except I used lean ground turkey and reduced fat crescent rolls to reduce the fat.  My husband and three kids LOVED it and it really was yum-o! Thanks for the recipe!

Wow- what a tasty recipe that was super quick and easy to make! We added a few of our favorite pizza "toppings" like bell peppers and red pepper flakes. I think you could personalize this in many ways for a delicious dinner. Enjoy!

This was a big soggy mess. I am not sure what magic I expected to happen in the oven but it came out it was just as wet as when it went in.
This is a meat sauce with croissant dough. And because it is so saucy going in, the dough bakes and then promptly absorbs liquid from the sauce to render it just as doughy as before it was baked. 
There is nothing casserole-y about this dish, as there is nothing to bind it together. 
Disappointing but after reading through the ingredients and directions, I should have suspected.

DEE-LISH!!! My family and I loved this recipe. I didn't have any Classico tomato sauce so I just used regular tomato sauce and added basil, also threw in some garlic salt. I could do without the crescent roll topping (a little too sweet for me) but I rated it 5 anyway because I loved the meat mixture so much! Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

Crazy easy to make!  I made a mistake and didn't buy any mozzerella cheese, so I had to use cheddar.  I think kids would love this!

This was very flavorful!!!  I slivered the garlic and used a jar of vodka sauce I had on hand.  Butter flavor crescents really make a difference too!!!

Beefy Upside-down Pizza Casserole Haiku: "Well, my kid loved this. But I guess that's expected, with 'Pizza' in name." My husband and I found this pretty boring, and I made half of ours with a layer of spinach and pepperoni in between. I don't know how folks are getting their 1 lb of meat to split into 2 layers that can fill a 9X13 baking dish - I had to start over in a smaller, round pyrex instead b/c the bottom of my 9X13 was just lightly dotted w/ sauce when I tried to halve the rest for the next layer. Other than adding the spinach and pepperoni into half, I followed the recipe as written probably using a bit less than the full 2 c. of the cheeses, and in the end, it was just a yawn. On the plus side, the crescent rolls tasted really good!
