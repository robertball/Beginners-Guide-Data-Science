I loved the idea of this recipe, but wanted it to come out a bit chunkier and not so much like a dip, so I added another extra avocado, chunked largely and only about 1/4 cup of the cocktail sauce.  Also, a little fresh ground pepper.  I served in martini glasses with extra shrimp garnishing the side of the glass.  It turned out beautifully and tasted incredible.

Great base but a little bland as is. Add lime juice, salt and pepper and you'll get a terrific appetizer.

I substituted salad shrimp for large shrimp, which made it easier to scoop up.  Also with fresh lime juice, and salt and white pepper as suggested.  I took it to a party, and it was the first thing gone.

I made a slight change to the sauce. I used 1/4 cup of mayo, 1/4 cup of cocktail sauce, 1/4 cup of chili sauce, and the hot sauce listed in the recipe. I coated the shrimp and avacado with the mix (I did not use all of it - add according to your tastes), and then piled the "salad" onto toasted rolls for a sandwich. It was fantastic! Some of us added a thin slice of cheese. This was quick and easy and light for the summer.

I made this for a Cinco de Mayo party & as a side for a light summer meal.  I've shared the recipe with some friends & our advice is to add a little more hot sauce, lime juice, and some celery for some crunch.  I used 2 avocados & twice the shrimp; otherwise the cocktail sauce is a little overpowering.

Awesome dip! Few changes... I used med. shrimp that I cut in half, two avocados, and like others, used mayo, cocktail sauce and chili sauce instead of all cocktail sauce.  I plan to make again next week for a luncheon at work.  Thanks for a great idea!

thought this was good start however
I added chopped roma tomato and not as much bottled coctail sauce.
Really liked the touch of hot pepper sauce.

was good, but too sweet with the bottled seafood sauce.Instead, next time I will use low-sodium/low sugar ketchup and a Tbsp. of prepared horseradish.

I used sweet chili heat sauce instead of cocktail sauce. This was a huge hit!

This was really yummy!  The bottle of cocktail sauce at the store was only 8.5 oz and that was plenty.  I chopped the shrimp into small pieces (about the same size as the avocado) and served with "scoops" chips.  Everyone raved.

I loved this!  I made it the first time right by the recipe and it was perfect!  The second time I "tweaked" it a little just for fun. It is so versatile.  Thanks so much

This is wonderful, very light and refreshing salad, served in martini glasses, easy to do and even avacado haters(my husband) really enjoyed it.

I made this as dip for the house (I have 3 roommates + 2 guest overs).  It wasn't a big hit.  I didn't have any hot pepper sauce.  It was stated that it was too sweet, so maybe the hot pepper sauce would have helped, but wasn't a fan.

This is a family favorite but I don't use the cocktail sauce.  I use tomato juice with chopped tomatoes, minced jalapeno peppers, and diced red onion, celery, and bell pepper.  Sort of like a cocktail!

I used the suggested mayo, cocktail sauce and chili sauce on the shrimp and avocado and served it with sourdough bread.  Great dinner!

Made this as suggested by other reviewers with lime juice, salt and pepper added. I don't think the salt was needed but the pepper and Tabasco added a nice punch. I also grated the lime rind, about a quarter of the lime. It was delicious. We ate as is without chips to cut down on carbs. Very flavorful and delicious.
