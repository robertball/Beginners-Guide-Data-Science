Not bad for a very quick recipe. The dough is so thick that you can roll it into a log, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate. We cut of a few cookies to bake individually when we want a warm, sweet snack.

This dough is really dense.  I have made this a couple of times to rave reviews from the chocoholics.

Yummy, easy recipe ! I did make a few changes though. Instead of the heath bars I used 1- 1 1/4 c. toffee peices plus Ghirardelli  milk choc. chips (1/2 c.). Then I baked them on 375 degrees for 5-6 minutes. The toffee melts into the cookies better at a higher temperature and when you take them out they will look undercooked. Let them sit for 5 minutes then transfer to a cookie rack.  They turn out so much more soft and gooey inside ! Thanks for the great recipe.

These cookies take 5 minutes to prep. For the speed I would have given them 5 stars, and that is what I was looking for and they aren't bad cookies. However, and maybe it's just me that notices that chemical flavor of a pre-packaged mix, but the flavor of the cookies, is much less than OMG "raving reviews." They don't taste like anything my Grandma made, naturally. I needed these in a pinch and I knew that a mix would make them, um, sort of instant flavored. But in all fairness, we are rating the "taste" of the cookie, and they seemed salty and chem-flavored to me. I did appreciate the SPEED of this option. I wouldn't bake them for people I love. Made them for Christmas cookie-packages for neighbors, I'm tolerant of.

Very good cookie.  Next time I will use more toffee.  I also think I'll mix it by hand - the dough is fudgy, like a brownie and kept getting stuck in the mixer.

mmmmmmmmmmmm chocolate.  These cookies are about the easiest things ever and oh so good.  I just used a whole bag of toffee pieces and worked out good. A little crunch on the outside and soft and gooey on the inside.

These are very good!  My first batch turned out a little dry - baked them too long.  Definitely keep the baking time to 9 minutes.  I also had to mix with a spoon because the dough is very thick.  It made a ton of cookies though.  And very easy!!!

These cookies were to die for. It is quick and easy. The only thing I used two medium eggs. It is better to use two large eggs instead, this way the dough won't get too hard. Yummy cookies.

Easy and tasty! I subbed a whole package of toffee bits for the candy bars. Similar to another recipe I've used for choc toffee cookies that is MUCH more difficult to make. This may not be quite as good, but the ease of the recipe makes up for that.

These are really great.  I substituted Andes pepermint bark baking chips for a holiday twist.  I am sure they will fly off the plate at the office party tomorrow.

These were good but nothing to write home about. I used a whole cup of crushed toffee & I don't wonder if the toffee pieces were bigger if that would help. They were easy to make though.

They were alright...the family didn't rave over them, but they're getting nibbled on. lol I think they're good, but I don't get that "I made these from scratch" proud feeling!  But in a pinch, it's a good fall-back recipe!

My sister made this first, I took one cookie and thought it was just okay, but for some reason I couldn't get it out of my mind! The second cookie was wonderful and so addicting that I had to have the recipe right then so I could go home and make more....yummy!

These are super easy to make; however, in my opinion, the flavor of these cookies is just OK.  They don't really have a homemade cookie flavor - I assume that is due to using the cake mix.  I also don't think that this particular cookie goes well with the toffee pieces - it seems to mask the toffee flavor which I love.  I also tried using this recipe with peanut butter chips instead of toffee and my family liked those much better.

These cookies were so easy to make that I was a little skeptical about how they would taste.  But they were terrific!!  Instead of toffee bits I put in Andes pieces (I thought that would be a bit more Christmasy).  This tasted great.  With how easy they are to make-it is a winning combo all around.  Give them a try!

I didn't think this recipe could get any easier and then I found "Heath toffee bits" near the chocolate chip section of my local market. I didn't even have to crush the candy bars!  Thanks- I found this recipe just in time for the Christmas cookie exchange!

made these cookies for our neighbors and got rave reviews. the only things I did differently were to use fudgey chocolate cake mix instead of devils food and to add 1 1/2 cups of chopped pecans. this is a keeper!

I needed something easy to throw together for my grandson who came to visit & found these while searching cake mix cookies. These are the best cake mix cookies I've ever had & my grandson loved them. I didn't have toffee bits so I used Andes peppermint bits, they were yummy! I'll try the toffee bits next time as I'm sure they'll be amazing also. I highly recommend this recipe.

The mix was like paste and all the dry mix didn't disolve.  I had to add a few tablespoons more vegetable oil and an extra egg.  Turned out great after that though. Taste like brownie cookies!  They would be super chocolately if milk chocolate chips were added.

Very tasty, although the batter is really sticky.  Easy and worth having to lick your fingers.
