So good!!! ?????? Tastes just like the ones from the Chinese food places. Would maybe add a bit of onion powder next time. But these are worth the effort!!! Would definitely make again!!!

Very tasty especially with the dipping sauce! And very few ingredients so that makes it easy for me. And also I have to say I love Chef John’s videos. Mine came out crispy, but still a bit doughy so I can see where I need to be more careful when rolling out the final form. I had never tried a dough like this, but I think I will even try to make these with very different things inside like tomato sauce and cheese, or even chocolate! Because it’s such a fast snack to fry up- and all you need is some dough ahead of time. Anyway, this is a great easy snack recipe for me and the children!

I’ve never had a Chinese Scallion Pancake so I have no basis to compare these too, but I’ve always wanted to try one and these were good! Followed recipe exactly, they were fun to make with my kiddo and we really liked the dipping sauce.

These are easy to make, don't take much time to prepare at all and make for a delicious and surprisingly filling snack. They also keep for a few days in the fridge and can be served up again with a quick re-fry or a few minutes in the toaster oven. Chef John is the boss!

These turned out just right.  Thin with tender fluffy insides and tender flaky golden exteriors.  High temperature cast iron skillet is a must have tool.  These are commonly called by their other name the "green onion cake".  These are very popular up in Alberta.  Other items we like to toss in are finely chopped red pepper, garlic, and light sprinkling of Chinese 5 spice.  Deep frying is another popular alternative.

I had trouble making the pancake thin enough without having oil break through the walls of the dough.  The pancake was very thick and doughy but the flavor was great.  I need to revisit this.  If anyone has ideas on how to make this  lighter and fluffier let me know!

Mine came out really dense.  Flavor was good but I didn't care for the density.

Chef John is my "go to" man, but, even he hints at the beginning that although there are few ingredients, the process is a little bothersome - mixing, rolling, basting, sprinkling, rolling, coiling and rolling again... for only a modestly tasty side-dish.
