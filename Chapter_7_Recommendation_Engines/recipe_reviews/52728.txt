We thought this was very good.  I was a little concerned that the cream mix wouldn't set so I added an egg;  I also added a sprinkling of cinnamon to the peaches.  Don't forget to watch the pie like a hawk once it's under the broiler!  One nanosecond separates caramel glory from burnt disaster!

This pie is simple and delicious, a perfect summer pie.  I used canned instead of fresh peaches and it was still great.

I read a review that gave this recipe 1 star and said it came out a mess, I think it needs to be mentioned that you have to thaw out the peaches.  I used frozen, and alot of juice came along with the peaches.  After they're thawed you may want to add some sugar, mine we're very sweet.  Each of my bags were 10 oz and I used two bags which gave me the equivalence of 3 cups, so I used what another reviewer suggested and I added a cup of blueberries, a very nice touch!  Substituted almond extract for vanilla.  The next time I make this pie, I will add the brown sugar to the pie the last couple minutes of baking because the pie wasn't in the broiler for even a minute and the sugar started burning.  Super easy pie to make, my boys helped and loved the filling before we added it to the pie, thanks for sharing this recipe!

very good.  my husband really liked.  I did make two ajustments: used vanilla instead of almond extract[my husband's allergic to it], and added 1\4 teaspoon of cinnamon to the cream mixture.  It is best still warm!  Set up beautifully!

I thought it was great! Easy to do,too. I didn't have almond extract, so I used a little vanilla the first time with fine results.

This pie was great and has become a family favorite. Something different-- very refreshing. I didn't have any almond extract and didn't seem to miss it. Not sure what it would have added. I replaced one cup of peaches with one cup of fresh blueberries. The berries added some flavor and color.

The recipe turned out really well, the only change that I made was to sprinkle with brown sugar for the last couple of minutes that the pie was in the over rather than broiling it.  Next time I will add a little cinnamon to the peaches. Canned peaches also work quite well for this recipe but the do lack some flavor.

This pie is delicious! I didn't have enough fresh peaches, so I used frozen blueberries for my second layer. Outstanding. I can't wait to make it again!

We didn't like this that much, It just tastes bland for me, kinf of boring! Used a puff pastry sheet for the crust and as other reviewer said also added an egg to the sour cream mixture. Thanks anyway!

It's just SO good. I've made this pie close to 10 times now, and it's SO GOOD every time. I make it with canned peaches, drained. Never soggy. I've made it for my dad for Christmas and Easter for a few years, and he RAGES about it. I didn't have time to make it one year, and dad was not having it. I had to make one for his birthday to make up for it. MAKE THIS PIE; IT RULES.

I thought it was good. My sour cream mixture when baked and cooled the top layer had the texture of a dense pudding (wasn't sure if that was normal).  next time I think I'm going to put a layer of peaches on top. I followed the recipe exactly except for this change. I added brown sugar and cinnamon to the peaches.

This is my go to for a fruit pie that is way different.   I used all different kinds of fruit: blueberries, raspberries, mix of berries and peaches or nectarines.  I wouldn't hesitate to use apples or rhubarb or pears or really any fruit you might put in a pie.  Very quick and you can use however much fruit you have on hand.  Very easy basic faux cream and fruit pie.  Loveeeee it!

This was delicious and quite easy. The filling set up just fine. I was out of almond extract and substituted vanilla. The flavor is refreshing and not too sweet. The brown sugar took about a minute or even less to carmelize, so be careful!

I made this using fresh nectarines instead of peaches, but otherwise exactly as written. I did try to drain as much of the juice as possible before putting them into the pie. It tasted fine but was a soupy mess.

Followed the recipe with 2 exceptions - used graham cracker crust and had only 3 cups fresh peaches so added one cup frozen berries.  Delicious!

Followed the recipe exactly. I used peaches that I canned last year.  I drained all the juices before putting the peaches onto the crust. I also floured the  bottom of the crust before layering.
Everything , crust, peaches, and sour  cream filling , came out perfectly.  It was delicious and easy.

Excellent and decadent.  BEST with FRESH peaches. Sets fully and is NOT soggy if you follow the directions - especially the part about the 1T of flour on the crust BEFORE adding your wet ingredients!!!  I added cinnamon to the sour cream mixture AND to the brown sugar that you caramelize on top at the end of the baking time.  :)  YUM! A new family favorite!

I took this to my mother-in-law's house where many people were there to fight over my first peach pie of the season.  It really could've turned into a fight because it was loved...and my mother-in-law (94 years old) knows a good pie!  I'm wondering if this pie can be made and frozen to be baked at a later time...would it be mushy after being frozen?

This makes a very small amount of filling, and is not very sweet at all.  I feel like an improvement would be to double the recipe (double the # of peaches too if using a deep dish pie plate as I did) and increase the amount of sugar by 25%.  Add 2 eggs for a double recipe as another reviewer suggested.  Forego the brown sugar broiling step (that didn't make sense to me in the first place) and sprinkle a handful of slivered almonds over the top midway through cooking.  With thewse improvements I'd award the recipe 5 stars.
