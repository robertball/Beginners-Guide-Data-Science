Loved this recipe .... with some changes.  First of all I completely left out the pasta.  I don't see any reason for it.  Secondly, I did not grill the shrimp but as another reviewer advised sauteed it with some EVOO, garlic and about 1/4 cup of the juice from the salsa (there is a lot so it won't affect the taste of the salsa at all).  Then served the shrimp with the salsa to top it off.  It turned out absolutely fantastic!! ;O)  Definately a keeper!!

I was looking for a pineapple salsa recipe to compliment my salmon patties when I ran across this recipe.  It worked very well and tasted great.  I did add some cilantro to it.

I could not imagine cold or even room temp salsa with hot pasta and shrimp, so I made a pasta salad with it. I grilled the shrimp then chilled them. I added the shrimp just before serving. It was very good. Everyone in my family loved it. and that is saying a lot...3 of 4 members HATE pasta salad. It is not so good left over...all the citrus makes the pasta and shrimp mushy, so make only as much as you will use. Also, I used a whole pineapple and all the juices from cutting it. I added the pineapple juice with the other juices. Over all a great salad and I will make it again.

Recipe overall was very good - I added some salt and pepper to the grilled shrimp. I also added some chopped garlic to the salsa - felt it was missing this. Have recommended this recipe to several freinds. Very good!!

This was very good. I cooked the shrimp in a pan with garlic, rather than using the grill. This worked well, offering great flavor. I Then added the salsa mix and pasta to the shrimp. 

I also used fresh angel hair pasta, for a perfect light summer meal.
Easy and very tasty!

good but way too much onion unless i just happened to get a really strong one. the rest of the salsa was fantastic once you get past the overpowering onion.

I thought this recipe was okay; however no one else in my family liked it much.  I made it with a green salad for dinner on a fall night. I think it would be more appropriate as a pasta side dish at a summer potluck.  I liked all the ingredients, but the flavors just did not come together in a positive way for me.  I will make the salsa again to use with salmon.

This recipes was delicious!  We substituted pickled jalpeno peppers and used half of what it called for to give it less spice.  I also added a little cinnamon to the shrimp that gave is a unique flavor but tied in well with the dish.

Instead of using orange juice I used pineapple juice. I liked the flavor of the pasta but I feel it needed more lime juice. I also would cook the pineapple with the shrimp if I made it again.

This was an exciting refreshing turn to both pasta and shrimp. Love the citrus and spice flavors. I used tangerine juice instead of orange juice and added one more hot pepper, Results were fantastic. Would equally as good as cold pasta salad. Healthy as well.

Loved it. I put a little Old Bay on the shrimp while grilling, tasted GREAT.  Will absolutely make this again.
