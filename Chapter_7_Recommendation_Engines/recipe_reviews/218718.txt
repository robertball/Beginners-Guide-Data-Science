This was pretty good as an accompaniment to an assertive main dish. Does not have a lot of flavour of its own, but a good background. Would use veggie broth instead of water next time. Thanks!

This was great - I used Uncle Ben's precooked Basmati rice only because the regular only came in a very large bag and was very expensive....I substituted Angel Hair pasta for the fideo noodles (looked that up on-line) - the texture is great and the flavor wonderful - I used with a beer flavored shrimp scampi - would go with a tangy sausage or any variety of seafood....will make again

SORRY BUT THIS HAD ABSOLUTELY NO FLAVOUR.  HAD TO ADD FAIR AMOUNT OF SALT AND BUTTER TO MAKE IT PALATABLE.  I HAVE A SIMILAR RECIPE WHICH CALLS FOR CHICKEN BROTHER INSTEAD OF WATER AND WHAT A DIFFERENCE.  THIS WILL NOT BE IN MY MENU ROTATION.

Great.  I used angel hair pasta, broken in thirds, and it worked fine.  Next time, I will break the pasta into smaller pieces before cooking.

This is great when you are serving a really spicy main dish.  I made Spicy Bison Balls from this site and they, indeed, where very spicy.  I whipped this up to go with them and it was a perfect pairing.  I cooked the rice in the rice cooker and the noodles took no time at all.  Perfect.  I made this for the Western Region Faceless Frenzy July 2012
