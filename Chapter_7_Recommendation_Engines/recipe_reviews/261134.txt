This turned out good as written. It does thicken up quick after you take it off the heat so move fast.

I was looking for a recipe for white milk gravy and this picture looked the closest to my memory of what mom used to make. Holy cow this is WAYYYYY too peppery. If I ever make this again no way will I use more than 1 TEASPOON of pepper in it. 1.5 tablespoons is ridiculous, unless you're really into hot spicy foods.
In its favor, the consistency and thickness was exactly what I hoped for.

Way to much salt!  I wonder if they meant a teaspoon?  Nobody ate it and everything went to waste!

Tastes good. Too salty for my taste. I put in a little over a teaspoon of pepper which was perfect for us. If you make the recipe for fewer servings, I made it for four, make sure you don't heat the milk in the microwave for a full 2 minutes. I heated for 50 seconds and it was fine. Good, quick pepper gravy.
