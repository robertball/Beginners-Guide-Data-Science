Husband had a hankering for grilled cheese and tomato soup this rainy afternoon. I picked this recipe because I had all the ingredients. The soup came together quickly and was as comforting and flavorful as we could have wished. I added a bit of sugar and garlic but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.

I thought this would be sweeter I had to add some sugar. Couldn't taste the coconut milk.

I liked this a lot; I couldn't really taste the coconut though but I loved the creaminess the coconut milk gave this soup and the addition of celery. I omitted the salt and added some ground ginger in with the soup. It was pretty tasty. Thanks for the recipe!

My son and I love this soup. I added some garlic shrimp about 2 oz more of coconut milk and seasoned it a little more to our taste. Easy and delicious

We needed tomato soup for a recipe but didn't have any canned soup so I found this recipe and had all the ingredients so I made it. It is really good and easy to make. I would say it compares up to any store bought tomato soup. Tastes really good and fit what we needed! Thanks for the recipe.
