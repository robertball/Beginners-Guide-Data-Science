The recipe is good as is, however, I added 1 chopped apple, 1 orange supremed,  and zest of 1 orange,and replaced the pecans with  walnuts .    You can also use fresh cranberries, and crush them in the food processor and add sugar to you likeness.

This recipe was sort of flavorless so I made a few changes.   I saut√©ed an onion and celery with garlic, thyme, rosemary and sage. I mixed it into the salad and also added golden raisins. This made it taste like and alternative stuffing. Would be great for vegetarians at Thanksgiving!

Simple and tasty for sure. The changes I made included using red quinoa instead of regular (really yummy and nutty). I used fresh cranberries rather than dried as they are in season and so good for you! I also sauteed a small onion and garlic to add to the mix. As far as seasonings go I mixed the olive oil, lemon, salt and pepper per the recipe and then added a little honey for sweetener and some fresh sage from my home herb garden. To finish I threw in some fresh chopped parsley also. This recipe is awesome because you can really mix and match what is in your cabinets and make it work regardless. The last thing I'll add is that quinoa always takes a bit longer to cook than the package says. It's usually ready for me in 20 minutes, not the indicated 6 or 7 minutes.

Excellent recipe Sarah! Thank you for submitting it.  I only added 2 things, some chopped green onion as well as some chopped fresh parsley.  I did let mine sit overnight and had it for lunch the next day - it is SO much better if you let the flavours sit and develop.  Next time I make it I may add grated carrots or chopped apples (as others have mentioned). I used red quinoa (love the stuff!) and aside from being SO healthy, it looks darn good too! I will take a pic and upload as this is one of those 'faceless' recipes that needs a pic to be appreciated!

I make this salad all the time, except that I use wheat berries instead of quinoa (although quinoa works just fine too) and I add diced celery and minced fresh parsley. It's easy, delicious and healthy and is one of my hubby's favorite salads.

This is so easy and has so few ingredients, yet the flavor has depth.  I like simple things, and this is that.  It has a very warm and buttery flavor.  I got home late one evening and decided to try this.  I  had just this for dinner.  Very satisfying.  It's good warm or cold--I had the remainder with the next night's dinner.

Great side salad for Thanksgiving; I added 1/2 orange worth of fresh zest and served at room temperature... toasted the pecans with a bit of butter in oven for 10 minutes or so then let cool before chopping...

I just had this dish from the Southern Seasons store in NC.  It was so light and tasty!  They added chives which I also liked.  I'm going to include this in our Thanksgiving menu for sure.

I love quinoa, so this was a great recipe for the holidays.  The cranberries and pecans were delicious, I added green onions too.  Everyone raved about it.

I thought this was great.  When I make quinoa, I usually use half water and half chicken broth for added flavor.  Since I was using fresh lemon juice I added the zest from one lemon.

Made as written except I was out of lemons so I used fresh lime juice. Also added some sliced green onion tops. LOVE IT!!! Made if for a BBQ and it was nice to have a side salad that was light and not covered in mayo.

This recipe can be very versatile.  I was underwhelmed with the flavor of this dish but it is easy to adjust this recipe to suite your tastes.  This was great mixed with greens.  I added chopped dried apricots to make a tasty and healthy late night snack.

This was a pretty good recipe, enjoyed the combination of ingredients and textures - nothing too overpowering in terms of flavours.  Would make a nice compliment to many main dishes - which in my case was some baked tilapia and steamed carrots :)

Love this nutty, tangy dish.  I added orange zest and substituted one Tbsp lime juice for lemon juice and added green onion for color.  Perfect for our Christmas dinner!

This is a pretty decent recipe.  I made it as given, but ended up adding a little bit of honey just to give it more sweetness to compliment the frittata with which I was serving it.

This is okay.  I've made it twice now as a side to roasted chicken.  It is a little lackluster in flavor.

I used red quinoa and added chopped apple. I omitted salt and pepper. It was tasty!
