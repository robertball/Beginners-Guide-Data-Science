I make a very similar dip using a glass pie plate. I spread just 1 pkg cream cheese to form a "crust," then pour in one can of chili WITHOUT beans and spread over cream cheese. Top with the chopped black olives and a small can of chopped Ortega green chilis, shredded cheddar cheese, and bake until bubbly. So easy and always a hit!

My mother would make this for us when I was young.  It is a must-have for our parties.  She always put a layer of canned green chilies over the layer of chili (no beans).  I updated the recipe by making my own turkey chili, which helps with the fat and salt.

I also use the pie plate version but use monterey jack with jalapenos instead of cheddar.

This is alright, I think it would be better with taco mix, stirred together with the cream cheese, with salsa and refried beans layered on that with melted mexican cheese on top

Excellent dip recipe.  I used turkey chili in order to cut down on calories, and would have used lite cream cheese if my grocer had any.  I didn't have green onions, either, but used half a regular one, sliced thin.  I added hot sauce to the chili to punch it up a bit.  Everyone here loved it.

Very addictive.  I added black beans, which gave it some nice texture.  I used 2 green onions, and would have liked more.  Be sure to use a thick chip, like fritos, as my thin nacho chips didn't stand up.

This is a wonderful recipe! The only thing i did different was added some taco meat on top of the cream cheese and a can of Rotel on top of the meat before the can of chili (no beans). It came out wonderful!
