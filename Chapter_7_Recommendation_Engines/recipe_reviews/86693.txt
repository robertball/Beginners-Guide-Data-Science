Very nice, quick brownies. I didn't have a 9x11 pan, so I used a 9x9 pan, but I had to cook them a little longer which caused them to think about burning on the bottom. So try and use a 9x11. And I put semi-sweet chocolate chips and butterscotch chips in them. The butterscotch were lousy (they were too sweet), but the semi-sweet chips were nice. I imagine peanut butter chips would be nice in this. You don't need icing with this brownie, because it's just perfect on it's own. Not too sweet and very chocolatey. Huzzah! I'll make this one again.

I made these brownies one Saturday afternoon when I had a sudden urge for brownies.  Having no "mixes" on hand, I came here and found this recipe.  It was easy to make and turned out wonderful!  I ended making them in a 9x13 pan because I don't have a 9x11 and I thought a 9x9 would be too thick.  They turned out fairly thin, but still moist, chewy and very chocolaty!  My husband loved them, too, and he's a hard critic when it comes to desserts.  These actually remind me of a mix between fudge and a brownie, both so good!!  I will be making these again.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I didn't like these at all. I followed the recipe exactly and the batter seemed a little too pasty.  TAfter I baked them they came out too dry and I know I didn't over bake them.  They were also too chocolately for my taste. I certainly won't be making these again.

Delicious! And quite easy too. These brownies were extremely rich though, but I liked how I could find all the ingredients in my kitchen-didn't have to buy anything. I coudln't find any walnuts though, and am sure it would have been even more delicious with them. Still terrific though-definetely a keeper!

WOW...This was the first time I made brownies other than the "instant" kind, and they were SOOOO delicious! My room-mates couldn't get enough either. This recipe will be the undoing of all of our new years resolutions! So easy, and SOO good!

I love how extremely easy to make these were.  I used only about 3/4 cups of butter because that's all I had but, they turned out perfect - delicious and very chocolatey.  I will be making these again.

No baking powder and brown sugar rather than white were both tip-offs to how fudgy and moist these would be.  More cocoa powder than most recipes guaranteed these would be deeply chocolate. It was interesting to try something a little different and in this case it paid off. Good recipe!

This was the worst brownie recipe ever. It was way too pasty, had a flour like taste and ended up being way to chocolately, and I am a chocohloic. I wound not reccomend this recipe to anyone.

this batter tasted so yummy that it almost didn't make it in the oven.  WOW it is rich.  I didn't have any nuts so I used chocolate chips, m&ms and Reese's pieces.

Terrible! My husband took one bite and said,"did you forget the sugar?!" Very Dry brownie, not sweet, and like eating a spoonful of cocoa! I tried to save them with some sweet frosting, but that didn't even make them good..

Wonderful and simple. I made some changes, instead of Vanilla I added orange extract. I love Chocolate and orange and my kids loved it too. I added a couple of table spoons of molasses to add to the richness and it turned out just great

This recipe was absolutely baffling.  I read the other reviews before making these brownies, and based on those reviews, expected them to be good.  NOT SO!  These brownies are very pasty, and dense.  Don't make my mistake by choosing this recipe.

a little bit too sweet for my taste. 
I used half vanilla-infused white sugar and palm sugar in equal measurement (we don't have brown sugar or basterdzuiker here). Maybe because of that. I was also unable to stop myself from adding a bit of spekulaaskruiden (pumpkin-pie spice). LOVELY! I love the soft smell of cinnamon, clove, and a bit of ginger in it. Goes well with any chocolate cake I made so far. Btw, my partner wanted me to try it without any chocolate in it because he always prefer yellow or vanilla cakes than chocolate ones. Let's see how it goes.

i found that (at first it was on accident) adding 1/2-1 more cup of butter greatly improved these brownies. perhaps not as healthy, but come on, if your gonna make a chocolate pastry then at least make it worth the calories!!! other than that, fantastic, 5/5 stars!

Just like the boxed mixes you find in the store. A little heavy on the cocoa. Could have used a little something to help hold it all together since it was a little crumbly. Would recommend putting frosting on it.

They truly are the "easiest" but they are the "best" too. Just as quick and easy as a mix. Will never by brownie mix again. Two thumbs up.

These weren't chewy so much as they were gooey. Followed the recipe exactly, baked 20 minutes.. Still very gooey. Put in another 5... No change. Had to eat it with a spoon because it kept falling off the forks. The flavor was so-so. I wouldn't make these again.

This recipe is great for a quick fix. I only used 1/2 cup of butter and used  3/4 applesauce for the rest of the fat content. Extra moist and yummy and lower in fat

These were pretty good. Very chocolately. I added chocolate chips. I don't like cake-like brownies, I prefer them chewy. These were somewhere in the middle. That being said, my dad LOVED them and brought them to work with him until they were gone. =)

I love these brownies! So moist and gooey, just like a great brownie should be!  I have never made brownies from scratch before, and these were a great recipe to start with. I will definitely be making these again!

These were super easy and have to say very good.  I did let them cook just a little longer then it called for.  Maybe 8 more mins.  I think from reading the reviews of those who did not they must not like the strong bitter of the chocolate.  It you are a true chocolate lover you will love these brownies.

So yummy, and quick! I change and tweak EVERY recipe I use for anything, EXCEPT this one, its perfect, and everyone gets excited when they find out I’m in the mood to make these brownies!    Don’t freak out at the fact that the batter is very, very thick. The first time I made them I thought I had left out a liquid or something because of how thick it was, but they were great!

These are excellent brownies.  I made these because I didn't have any chips in the house.  They turn out almost like a fudge.  They are not cake-like brownies, if that is what you are looking for.  I didn't have the problems that others reported with being to grainy or floury.  Just made sure you cream the butter and sugar well, and stir the flour in slowly. A chocolate lovers dream.

Okay, These brownies were perfectly yummy :) I only made minor modifications due to what I had (I used 1 cup margarine instead of butter) and I added about 1.5 cups of semi sweet chocolate cups. Although the batter was more like a dough, with some elbow grease you can sort of putty it into the pan, but the end result is chocolatey, gooy chewy and overall the best recipe for brownies ive come across!!! Perfect with whipped topping, and chocolate sauce on a cold night!!!

This is my favorite brownie recipe. It's quick and easy, all made in one pot on the stove. They are moist and chewy. To those calling it "too chocolate-y", I suppose it's a matter of taste--I personally don't see how any brownie can be too chocolate-y, I can only see that as a good thing! To me, these brownies are perfect.

These brownies were awesome! I only had about 1/2 cup of Cocoa, so I used about 1 cup of hot chocolate mix in addition to the 1/2 cup of Cocoa. I used pecans instead of walnuts because I didn't have any walnuts. The brownies were super moist, and tasted just like brownies should...nice and chocolatey. Go ahead and try these!

Very interesting brownie...the batter was very stiff, which was odd, and I found I had to increase the baking time (like in everything I bake where I live). The end result however, was...different. It was rock solid when you tried to cut it, but as soon as you took a bite, it melted in your mouth-delicious! It was not your typical chewy, soft brownie, but it was very good nonetheless.

OMG!  These are PERFECT!!!  Not too cakey; not too chewy.  I made some tonight--licked the bowl like a little kid, and almost didn't want to put them in the oven (LOL).  The pan was in the oven before I remembered... I forgot to add the salt.  As it turns out, I DIDN"T NEED TO!  :)  Yummmmm...  This recipe is DEFINATELY a KEEPER!  Thanks ssooo much!

Just made these! Note: You MUST love, say, 85 percent dark chocolate in order to appreciate these. I baked mine in a 9" pie pan because my 9 in. pan was in use. I adjusted the time to 25 minutes.  I also made  a few major recipe changes: I omitted the salt (not necessary) and used only 1 stick of butter. In lieu of the remaining butter, I mixed 1/4 cup nonfat GREEK yogurt with 1/4 cup milk. I also omitted the walnuts.  This had a peanut-butter-like consistency. I made my own chocolate buttercream (1 cup powdered sugar, 1/3 cup cocoa, 3 T melted butter, 2 t vanilla and milk to make a spreadable consistency). These need something sweet to offset the non-sweet brownies...if not my icing, at least some vanilla ice cream. I am a dark chocolate freak and these are good. I'd make them again, but only with the substitutions I listed and absolutely with the buttercream icing or ice cream.  2 cups of sugar is crazy for any recipe, but understandable since this recipe uses a full CUP of cocoa. Try this is you like bittersweet chocolate!

I, like others, made some alterations; I doubled the vanilla and added several hefty shakes of cinnamon - I always like cinnamon with chocolate. These were without a doubte the best brownies I have ever tasted! Definitely an addition to my cookbook!!!

I actually made an account just to rate these brownies. They were INCREDIBLE! I fell in love with them after tasting the batter, and it just got better from there! I didn't have cocoa powder on hand, so i melted up about 3/4 cups chocolate chips with about 1/4 cup of the butter, i also doubled the vanilla (a personal habit) and added about a teaspoon of ground ginger (I am pregnant and a ginger fanatic.) They came out very moist due to the chips, but it only made them better.  Great with a scoop of your favorite ice cream! These will undoubtably become a family favorite!

Excellent recipie, good consistency, great chocolate taste, perfect texture. A couple of changes;after reading reviews, I added 2T molasses, 1T instant coffee to the batter. I also layered on 3c unsweetend flaked coconut mixed with 1 can sweetened condensed milk and 2t vanilla. This will definatly cure your sweet tooth, especially if you put a scoop of cherry ice cream on top while it's still warm. YUM!

These brownies come out way too sugary-sweet and the recipe needs some kind of leavening agent. Nice for a "chocolate emergency" because of so few ingredients, but otherwise wouldn't make them again.

I thought this recipe was great. I haven't baked in the past few years, so the short list of ingredients is what appealed to me. My boyfriend and son loved them. The only issue I had was that I do not own and have never heard of a 9x11 pan. I used an 8x8, so they were pretty thick and the surface burned a tad before the inside got fully cooked. It didn't seem to affect the flavor. I will definitely make it a staple.

These brownies are very good.  For people who like thicker bronies I would suggest using a smaller pan. The brownies were about 1/2 inch thick.

Well, I was torn by the reviews...but desired the simplicity of the recipe due to what I had on hand. Based on the negative reviews, it seemed like the butter might be the problem(?) So, I substituted oil. Now, I had to leave them in the oven a little longer and they still seem under-cooked gooey...but I think subbing the oil works and next time I'll leave them in for a solid 30 minutes before taking it out. (It may be worth noting that I have a gas oven and sometimes that can make a difference.)

I have to say, this recipe did give me the texture that I was looking for. I did follow the recipe exactly but in my opinion, they have too much of a cocoa taste. I felt as if I were eating cocoa straight out of the jar. Very bitter.

I thought it was to chocolaty tasting but my husband liked it depends on your taste. I used Crisco instead of butter and it came out just right. for those of you who don't have butter good alternative

I am in the minority but agree with the few that these are too cocoa flavored, I cooked additional time but still the texture was very odd and didn't seem right. They look amazing, flakey top with a fudgey base but the taste and texture was not even close to what I expect in a made from scratch brownie.

Great brownie recipe.  I did 1 1/2 times what the recipe called for and put it in a 9x13 and ended up with nice thick brownies.  I changed a couple ingredients because of what I had on hand.  I used 1 cup of brown sugar and 2 cups of white sugar instead of 3 cups of brown sugar.  I also added 1 cup of peanut butter just to give it a little peanut butter taste.  Doing 1 1/2 times the recipe made nice thick fudgy brownies in the bigger pan. Being thick I increased the cooking time to about 40 minutes.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Probably not a bad recipe if I had used an egg but I was out and so I used a banana mashed up. And broke up some semi-sweet chocolate squares and tossed those in. The end result was a chewy-ish fudgy item that wasn't actually a brownie at all. I'm giving it 4 stars because even though it didn't actually turn out like intended it tasted all right. I'll toss it into some vanilla ice cream it'll do fine there.

Turned out pretty dense and a bit chewy.  Maybe I mixed it too long?  Next time I will sift the flour and cocoa together first and then mix into the butter/sugar combination.
Still good with milk!

These brownies were very easy to make, and they taste great!  They are very rich, but I am not complaining!  I did have to bake them a little longer than indicated, and they still turned out moist and yummy!

Not terribly impressed with this recipe, but I think it's a 'personal taste' thing. The recipe is absolutely easy (as advertised!) and the texture is great, but the brownies are not sweet enough as a standalone, and have a harsh aftertaste. It may just be the cocoa. On the other hand, they're pretty good with ice cream or a good creamy icing on top! :o)

These weren't bad!  I was trying to find something I could make with the few ingredients I had on hand, and stumbled across this recipe.  Are they the best brownies I've ever had in my life? No.  But they are very easy to make and taste pretty good.  I made mine in a pie dish because others had said the brownies came out too thin in a traditional pan.  I cooked them about 10-15 minutes longer and they came out nicely.  They taste best warm, I think.  So, these were absolutely fine and I have no regrets about making them.

I don't know why this got a bad rap. I thought they were nice. They were more fudge like and have a nice chew. The walnuts were a great addition. I sprinkled powdered sugar on top to make the apperance look better. Not a 5 stars, but not a bad  recipe either.

I always look for recipes with simple ingredients that I can make my own and this one is perfect!  I have omitted the nuts and added various flavors of "chips" to these with great results.  The recipe is so easy that it has become my children's favorite to make.  We do use a smaller pan, though.  We use an 8x8" square and cut it into 16 servings.

I make brownies all the time, and this recipe seemed fine on paper. But I made  these for me and three 12yr old boys, we all give it a thumbs down. Pasty texture and not a very good flavor, definitely won't make again. Bummed.

Made these brownies tonight.  They are a little pasty going in the pan,the batter had to be spread a little more than regular brownies, no real pouring of any kind. There is no baking soda or powder, so they don't rise.  

I used a 9x13 glass dish and baked them for the recommended time and an additional 5 minutes and they still could have used another 5 minutes. 

These brownies are very chocolatey and very moist.  I don't know if this had anything to do with the fact that I substituted coconut oil for butter, but they were moist.  The height of these were about a 1/2".

I would recommend making these in a pinch if you are craving something sweet and chocolatey.  However, I think I would cut back on the sugar and add a teaspoon of baking soda.   

I do recommend using the coconut oil.  I don't remember brownies tasting buttery.  An excellent easy recipe for the decadent chocolate lover.
