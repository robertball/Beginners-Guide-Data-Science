I made this as written but used fresh ravioli and tomatoes in place of frozen and canned. Took minutes to make and had everything already on hand. Easy to season to taste!

I loved this!  Instead of canned tomatoes I used fresh which I sliced thick and got as much juice out into a side bowl to add later to the cooking pan to try and make up for the canned juice.  I grilled the tomatoes along with a poblano pepper, cause I had it, along with the called for veggies.  I used a mushroom cheese ravioli with this and when I added all the ingredients to the pan I added a bit of butter to make up for some of the missing canned juice.  SO GOOD!  Really enjoyed this one :)

This is really delicious! I used a cast iron grill pan with the raised grilling ridges in it and it worked great. The grilling of the veggies gives it wonderful flavor. I used tortellini instead of ravioli and also subbed homemade jarred tomatoes instead of store bought canned because my dad makes them from his garden, and I added sliced chicken andouille sausage which I grilled in the pan first also, had a little spice to it but really really good. And used organic zucchini. Would be great if you have garden fresh zucchini and tomatoes bet it would be really good with fresh tomatoes too. I cooked everything just right in this go round. Be careful not to over cook the veggies. Don't like mushy zucchini. I will definitely make this again.

This was terrific, although I made some changes.  I substituted bell peppers for some of the zucchini, and added some Al Fresco sausage slices to the sauce mixture because we like some meat.  I served the sauce over the ravioli rather than mixing it in because it seemed like the ravioli would get torn up.
