I use this recipe as a blue print BUT this is what I used:  1-14.5oz can of Swanson chicken broth, 1-14.5oz can of Swanson beef broth, 1-14.5oz can diced tomatoes with basil, garlic & oregano (to give some flavor), 1-14.5oz petite diced tomatoes, 1-15oz garbanzo beans (drained and washed), half an onion chopped, 3 stalks of celery chopped, pre-cut 1.20 lb zucchini/yellow squashed, 1 lb italian ground sausage, 1/2 lb ground turkey, 1/4 c Kraft sun-dried tomato dressing.  I cooked the meet till brown, drained grease.  Then added everything else and cooked over high heat until boiled.  Then reduced heat to simmered for 30 mins. I made gluten free penne pasta (all I could find)   ENJOY!!!!

Not a bad quick meal.  Very easy to prepare.  Use fire roasted diced tomatoes for extra flavor.  Serve with fresh bread and a glass of wine and you have a real winner!

I tried this recipe exactly how it is. I didn't like it. Next time I would not use the Italian dressing and I would add Italian seasoning, fresh pepper, onions, garlic, and red pepper flakes.
