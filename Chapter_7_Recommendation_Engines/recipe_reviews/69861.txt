I used Chinese Mie noodles, which were perfect for this.  The sauce, as it was in the recipe, was missing something.  I added ~1/2 tsp ancho chili powder, 1 Tbsp lime juice, and 1 tsp white pepper and then it was fine.  It is also good heated.  I served it with grilled, boneless, skinless chicken breast and thighs marinated in the Absolutely Ultimate Marinade from this site, which was a perfect combination.

Good flavor but the recipe as written is too dry.  Next time I'll either halve the pasta or double the wet ingredients.

This tastes great for a quick, easy summer dish! Just adjust the noodles/sauce ratio a little like the other reviewers said. I didn't have some of the ingredients and substituted with angel hair pasta, paprika powder, and Miracle Whip, and ate it with some thinly sliced cucumber on the side. Very refreshing. Thanks for the recipe!

This was eh.  I doubled the sauce and added veggies but it was kind of boring.  Or something.  It was not inedible, but I wouldn't make it again.

I made it for a barbeque, and everyone loved it.  It was easy to make,  And I am making it again for more company.

I reduced the oil by 1/4 and instead increased water. Used fresh garlic chives liberally and I thought the dish needed some tobasco in the end. Very interesting. I love vermicelli. And yes, I served warm.

I am not sure what to say about this recipe.  I love Tahini, but couldn't get this sauce right.  I used half the pasta called for, per other reviewers, but I think the full 16 oz would have been better.  This needed more of something.  Lemon juice maybe?  I am cooking more pasta tonight, to add to my leftovers to see if that helps.

Ew.  Sorry.  I've never used tahini before in anything but hummus, but thought I would give it a try.  Maybe I'm just not a tahini person.  I kept trying to fix it, but in the end just trashed the whole batch.

I liked this recipe, but found it was somewhat bland as well. There were enough wet ingredients, but I still added tons more lemon and some soy sauce. Red peppers and green onion really added to it and gave it nice textures.

I'm glad I listened to VWWOLF and doubled the sauce ingredients; he (or she?) was right.  It was even a bit dry at the double-sauce level.  Nevertheless, it definitely had a nice flavour to it and I think it's worth making again, but with even MORE liquid ingredients.

love this recipe! I stumbled on this when I was looking for a quick meal with what I had at home. I had pretty bare cupboards but I had a jar of tahini and figured I shouldn't let it go to waste. I made it with rotini pasta instead of the noodles since that's what I had on hand. I omitted the olive oil and I didn't bother with the garlic and onion salt since the recipe already had garlic cloves in it and used a pinch of sea salt instead. I also added a squirt of sriracha sauce for some extra spice. such an easy and delicious meal!

This recipe needs more of everything except the pasta! It's too dry and too bland as is.  After adding more tahini, mayonnaise, lemon juice, salt, chives, etc. it was much better.

I love this recipe!  It's quick, tastey and always a hit.  I use green onions instead of chives and angel hair pasta.  If the dressing is a little dry I just add a touch more mayo.
