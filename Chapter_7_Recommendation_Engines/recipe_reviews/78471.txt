This was very refreshing. I have never had a mojito before this so I don't have anything to compare it to, but it tasted very good and was SO simple. I would make again.

A great refreshing drink even without rum.  The flavors blended together wonderfully and i couldn't keep the glasses full.

This was a very simple drink to make.  I was skeptical as I am not a big mint fan.  I will definetly keep.  Nice on a really hot muggy day.

This recipe is perfect! Mojitos are my favorite cocktail & SBD my favorite way to eat.So that I can enjoy these everyday, I now grow limes & mint in my garden! Even when I make "real" mojitos, I use Splenda instead of sugar.They taste great!Thanks SBD!

I followed the directions exactly but used regular sugar instead of sugar substitute.  It was sweet enough, but very lime-y.  The lime overpowered the mint, which isn't what I was looking for.  Oh well, thanks anyway!

Absolutely delicious! I just put all the ingredients in the blender to mix the flavors and crush the ice. Yum! Will definitely be making this often.

Refreshing even without the rum...and I messed up and bought lemon-lime water instead of lime, and probably could have used more mint (and next time I WILL!)

this was very good...I added 1/4 teaspoon of rum extract. Nice on a warm summer evening, especially on phase 1 when you can't drink alcohol!

It wasn't bad but it tasted too "diet" like to me with the lime-flavored water and splenda. But then again, I've never been a fan of diet drinks either. I would suggest using the non-diet version of lime water (if there is such a thing!)

I am drinking this thing right now and it is delicious!!! I checked McCormick's website for nutritional info on Imitation Rum Extract and everything was so "insignificant" that I assume it has no nutritional value just like vanilla. I say that if vanilla is OK to use in phase 1 then this is, too!!! I say - add some drops of Rum Extract for added flavor!!!!
