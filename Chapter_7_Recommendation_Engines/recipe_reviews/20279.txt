This was pretty good, after a few adjustments.  From the beginning, I knew I didn't want to make the whole recipe, so I bought only one tub of cool whip.  Also, I didn't want to buy grapefruit juice (who could drink a whole container of grapefruit juice, yuck) so I used a combination of lemon, lime and orange juices.  I ended up using almost one the whole can of condensed milk and waaaay more than 1/2 the juice the original recipe called for.  My advice - plan on using 1 container of cool whip, one container of condensed milk, and add juice to taste.  I like it a little tart, this is probably why I ended up using so much lime juice.  Tastes pretty good!  Sort of like key lime pie without the crust.  I'm going to serve it to my boyfriend for Valentine's Day with some slices of orange.

I thought this was great!! I used two cans of condensed milk and a cup of key lime juice and called it key lime mousse. I took it to a luncheon and got rave reviews and requests for the recipe.

Ehhh.... This was just OK for us. I only used the one carton of cool whip as suggested & I did add a bit more of the juice (I used a sweet ruby red grapefruit juice). I also cut back on the sweetened condensed milk (I used fat free) but it was still too sweet. My grandson enjoyed his but hubby & I were ambivalent about our's. Thansk anyway Kate!

I loved this sweet (almost too sweet!) yet tangy mousse. I added finely diced pineapple to give it some texture and bring down the sweetness a bit. After I started adding the diced pineapple, I started getting requests for the recipe.

I loved this recipe, i made this mousse twice however i changed it a bit both times. The first time i added 1/4 cup extra lemon juice going by another member's review (i replaced the grapefruit with lemon juice) and added about 2 1/2 teaspoons of gelatine as i found it very runny. I suppose this might have been because i used fresh whipped cream (you dont get frozen whipped topping over here. The second time i made it i made a pineapple mousse instead which turned out great! I used a tin of pineapples and used a cup of the juice inside the tin. Then i added 5 teaspoons of gelatine with just enough water to make sure that the gelatine dissolves completely. It was lovely! Also, both times i added some orange essence as i found that the mousse smelled very 'cheesy'. It still had a slight hint of a cheesy smell but that gave a 'cheescakey' flavour which everyone actually liked quite a bit.

This is what I expected, we have a similar recipe that we've been making for years but it uses whipping cream instead of the cool whip. I've been wondering if there was a way to make it less fattening...so I tried this recipe using fat free sweetened condensed milk and fat free cool whip. I  used just lemon juice, I used 2 cans sweetened condensed milk as did most other reviewers. It didnt set up as firm as when I use the whipping cream, but the taste was there. We serve ours with fresh fruit.

I'm giving this a five because I after I modified it, it was great, and all my guests loved it.  I suggest 1/4 cup lemon juice and 1 cup orange juice.  It kind of tastes like those orange push-up pops.  I've served it with fruit, and all by itself, and people love it both ways.  Serve after a hearty Italian meal for a nice palate cleanser.

Hmmm. Maybe I did it wrong, but this was really soupy. Flavor was great, but I had to freeze it to get the texture I wanted.

This was a big disappointment, everyone just said it tasted like a big blob of cool whip. (I made individual servings) Anyway, it wasn't as good as it sounded.

This was only okay.  I kept adding juices hoping that it would get some taste, and it never really did.  I eventually had grapefruit, lemon and orange juice as well as orange and lemon peel in it.  I should have reduced the milk by a lot, I think.  I may try something like this again, but I certainly will adjust.

I really liked this recipe. It set up beautifully and I didn't think that it was too sweet or too tart.  I can't wait to try some of the modifications for our next get-together!

The mousse was very quick and easy to make.  Next time I will choose to flavor with one sweet juice and one sour juice.  The lemon and the grapefruit juice made this mousse too bitter.  I think it would be perfect with orange juice and grapefruit juice or lemon juice and strawberry juice.

This turned out nicely and wasn't bad, but as I imagined tasted sort of fake.  I don't think it would fool anybody about being a real mousse.  It was also soo rich, you won't want more than a couple of spoonfuls.  My husband didn't like it at all.

So simple yet rich.  I whipped this up while yakking to my guests.  They couldn't beleive that I just made it - no double boilers, no complicated ingredients.

It just doesn't get much easier than this.  Followed the recipe to the letter, and I thought it had just the right amount of sweet-tartness.  I used freshly squeezed juices, and the grapefruit was very, very sweet.  The texture may be just a little heavy to be considered a mousse, but it was very creamy.  I used FF sweetened condensed milk and lite whipped topping, and this still was loaded with flavor.  I think this has a lot of versatility just by varying juices and garnishing with different fruits, shaved chocolate, etc.

I LOVE IT, you should try it, I put chopped barries on the top. I did it almost every day this week.
