This cake was extremely moist.  The coconut pudding added a very subtle, rich flavor--the cake itself actually didn't have very much coconut flavor.  I also liked that the frosting wasn't too sweet.  I sprinkled coconut over the top of the cake--delicious!

Wonderful!  This cake was so moist, everyone loved it!  I did poke holes in the top of the cake before adding the topping to let it 'sink' into the cake.   I also added chopped pecans and a little bit of coconut to the topping.

Thanks mauigirl....for posting this so I could make it. It was quite wonderful, slightly rich without it being sweet. If that makes sense,my only part in the recipe that stumped me, was whether or not, I should have or shouldn't have drained the pineapple. I didn't and it took an extremely long time to thicken...which I think I should have drained the pineapple. I ended up adding some cornstarch to help, and turned up the heat just a little to speed things along. The pineapple topping is not sweet, so I added just a tsp of splenda to knock just a little of the tartness down, however, it was still wonderful. The cake was super moist and flavorful as well as the pineapple topping...I will make again. And my kids like it too!! TY
