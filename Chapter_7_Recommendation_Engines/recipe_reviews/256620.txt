1.5.17  Sure, you can buy sofrito in the can, but there’s nothing better than freshly-made sofrito.  It’s good not only in Puerto Rican cuisine, but is a staple in Cuban and Spanish food, as well.  There’s some chopping involved in this recipe, but it has all the right ingredients and freezes beautifully...I use zip-lock bags.

First time making any type of Latino food. It was very tasty in my stew I made.

Great recipe, same as what I used to make but, I found a Korean market and was very much surprised to learn that they use recao in their food and so I drive 10 miles every month to get fresh recao and now my sofrito is almost genuine. I still need the ajises dulces and the puertorican pimiento verde, not to be found in California. A great alternative to ajises dulces are the small assorted sweet peppers.
