Great recipe!  I did make a few changes, left out the sugars, butter, syrup, eggs, crust, etc.......bourbon was a great help while preparing a huge Thanksgiving dinner.

20 some years ago I came across an elderly southern lady's recipe for Bourbon Pecan Pie.  This is the exact same recipe, and I can tell you after baking this pie for 20+ years that it is without a doubt the best pecan pie there is.  If you want a fancy presentation, take your pecans and arrange them in the pie crust.  Press them down slightly.  Then add your liquid.  The nuts will rise to the top during baking leaving a professional appearance.  I have only done this a few times when I really wanted a WOW presentation.

This pie is delicious and so easy. I just used a bourbon that I happened to have on hand (Jim Beam) but I think any bourbon would do. I was worried that it might have to strong of an alcohol flavor, but it cooked right out and left it with a more sophisticated taste that was a welcome change from the same ole' pecan pie.  Everyone loved it so I will be making again soon! Thanks for sharing Kimberly

This recipe was delicious - my son said it was the best pecan pie he has ever had!!!  I did cook it for an 10 extra minutes though. People that wrote reviews that this recipe was awful or didn't turn our right should not be allowed in the kitchen to wash dishes, much less cook.....

My husband adores this pie. You can definitely taste the bourbon, so if you don't like the taste of bourbon this is not for you. After making this several times, I have decreased the pecans to 1 1/2 cups. I know it's a pecan pie, but I thought the amount of pecans was overwhelming. So glad I found this recipe. I've made it 4 times in the last 6 weeks and passed it down to my sister.

This is the exact recipe I have used every year for 25 years except for two things---a teaspoon of vanilla and I use dark corn syrup. I don't know how anyone could mess this pie up (one poster stated it was a disaster). It comes out perfect every time and if you really want to kick it up a notch, add chocolate chips. Fabulous, rich, decadent and so worth the calories.

Total Disaster.  Rating based soley on the outcome I would give this 1 star.  But to be fair, I don't know if it was such a disaster because maybe I did something wrong?  First of all, the recipe calls for a 9" deep dish pie crust.  The filling however, only filled up about 1/2 inch of the pie dish.  While cooking, it "rose" up to about halfway up the crust, but once it came out and cooled, it deflated down to maybe just 1/4 inch of filling.  And what little there was, tasted awful, very eggy and not yummy at all.  The only change I made to the recipe was that I used brandy instead of bourbon (all I had on hand).  What I am wondering is that I used egg beaters instead of whole eggs.  Would that have made such a huge difference?  I am hesitant to even attempt this again.

This was okay.  I was born and raised in Georgia and ours was much more flavorful.  Needs more butter and bourbon taste which I will add the next time I make this pie.

This was a really good and EASY Bourbon Pecan Pie recipe.  My ugly picture with my horrible looking pie crust (but, it tasted good!) doesn't do this pie justice.

I made this last night on a lark.  More of a cook than a baker.  Love anything I do not have to drag out the mixer for.  Takes 5 minutes to put together.  I like pecan pie but before this one the only kind I was able to find was sickenly sweet or hard as a rock.  This recipe conquers both problems.  The bourbon flavor mellows wonderfully during the baking so it is distinct but not overwhelming.  The filling is viscous but not too dense.  My husband loved it - I use a gluten free crust so he could eat it.  

This is going to be my go-to holiday dessert from now on.  Happy Thanksgiving!

I made this as one of our Christmas desserts.  I wasn't impressed or pleased with the result.  I followed the recipe exactly and used a better bourbon.  I had to bake it longer than stated and the pie was runny and the bourbon over-powered.  When I make my normal go-to pecan pie recipe there is never any left. After my company had left I had over half of this pie.  I put it in the freezer as we were going out of town for a week and just pulled it out last night to try it.  It did freeze well, but we decided we just don't care for this recipe. Unfortunately I will be throwing away half of a pecan pie and I hate wasting food; especially food that was expensive to make (pecans are not cheap).

Pecan pie is my husband's favorite so it's a holiday tradition in this family.  WOW, do we have a new favorite recipe with which to carry on that tradition!  The bourbon cuts down on the pie's natural sweetness and is the perfect amount for our tastes.  A winner!!

Wow!  I've been using a recipe EXACTLY like this for the past 6 years!!!  I also use the same recipe to make mini-pies to pass out as thank you treats to teachers & friends around thanksgiving.  Everyone raves about it.  If the pie is jiggly /runny,  cover the pie with foil and let it bake longer.  The bourbon flavor mellows out, and makes this pie even better the next day.

Made this pie with a few adjustments. I used dark corn syrup because that's what I had and a few shakes of cinnamon. It took much longer to bake than instructed. I continued baking in 10 minute increments until the center was firm but bouncy, the pecans were nicely browned and the center temp of the pie was 200 degrees. It was absolutely delicious. Next time I'll double the bourbon and add even more cinnamon.

Excellent. This was a super easy to make pecan pie and it was a success for thanksgiving. Hubby will never eat pecan pie from the store ever again. He loved it. It was a little watery after 35min in the oven so I let it bake for another 10mins and it was good after that. Will definitely keep making it going forward!!

Such a great flavor, but I wish it wouldn't have turned out so runny. Even after I left it overnight it was still runny. I've made it twice though to try to see if I just messed something up the first time and because I was asked to make it again. I will try it again sometime and cook it longer. That's how much I loved the taste. I used a flavored bourbon and organized the pecans on the bottom before filling it. Looked fancy. But the second time I just folded them in.

Tasted good but did not set. I followed the recipe exactly and it was still soupy. Have only made pecan pie twice and neither was successful so I'm not sure what to adjust to make it turn out.

OMG, this was so good!
I combined 2 recipes together and added more bourbon! Like a half of cup! 
Then I added half cup of white sugar, a half cup of brown sugar and some  vanilla!
I didn't bother with cooking my corn syrup and chocolate, (why mess up a sauce pan when you don't have too!) I Just mixed it all together in one bowl and then poured it in my pie crust and baked it!
It was amazing! 
It was like 3 pies into one!
One bite was full of pecans, another bite was full of chocolate, and then there was the bourbon!
Totally my new favorite!

I was worried. I've never made a pecan pie before,  I'm not great at baking, and frequently screw things up so when I saw the "disastrous" review, I was quite nervous. I carefully followed the directions and when I poured the filling into the pie crust, it only filled about 1/2 way. Luckily, as it baked, it fluffed up and looked beautiful when it came out of the oven. It got rave reviews from everyone. My husband begged me to not add the bourbon (he likes to drink it, but for some weird reason he doesn't want it in his food) but he even said it was excellent and loved the bourbon flavor. I will make it again.

This a good recipe.  I altered the recipe to make 50% more filling and added a little extra bourbon.  Easiest pie ever.

This is by far the best pecan pie I have ever made! It has turned out perfect every time I've made it!  I only cut back on the bourbon just a bit. I made it once for my in laws, who don't like alcohol so I replaced the bourbon with vanilla and it was delicious that way too!

I followed the recipe completely , truthfully not something I commonly do, it did turn out pretty and smelled great, the bourbon seemed a little strong though. I'm not sure what kind of bourbon other people used, but I had "Buffalo Trace Kentucky Strain Bourbon", perhaps a different kind would have made it better. Next time I'll most likely stick with old fashion pecan pie bourbon free. However it was worth a try.

I made this delicious pie for my husband who said it was the best Pecan pie he had ever had. I followed the recipe exactly and did not change a thing. It came out of the oven perfect. The reviewer who used egg substitute should have known better, egg substitute is exactly what the name implies EGG SUBSTITUTE not to be confused with whole eggs. No wonder it came out “soggy and nasty “ This recipe is definitely easy and most definitely a keeper. If you are going to try a new recipe why change some of the ingredients or add other ingredients ?? This does not make any sense at all to me.

While this looked great and flavor was great, it did not set up at all. It was super runny. All my ingredients were fresh.  I even put it back in the oven for 10 minutes and it still didn’t set up. I’m going to try Chef Johns recipe that’s cooked before filling the pie and see if that works out better.  I’m an experienced baker but have never made a pecan pie before. I followed the recipe to a T and am wondering if there are some tricks not mentioned.

This was so good! I haven't made pecan pies much and this one was pretty much perfect. I lined the pan with parchment just in case, but for this pie I don't think it was strictly necessary.

Absolutely the best pecan pie I’ve made. Everyone raves about it and a couple people said it was better than their Moms. We had to substitute an Apple brandy for the bourbon and it was still very good.

Cooking time is off and should be baked for 60 minutes in order to set.  I was nervous that I was going beyond the time by 15 minutes  so I pulled it out of oven and it turned out runny.  Very disappointing.

Best Pecan Pie ever! After trying a pecan bourbon tart from my local grocery store, I sought out a recipe. This is wayyy better!!  I’ve made it the last few years for holidays and my family loves it. Two Thanksgivings ago I didn’t make it and boy did I catch hell for it. Won’t forget again!!! My family thanks you, for sharing this...????

I've made this pie multiple times now, and every time I do, it comes out tasting good, but it doesn't hold together. As soon as you cut into it, it falls apart. I follow the recipe exactly, no substitutions at all, but as soon as I add the bourbon to the mixing bowl, the filling immediately becomes watery. I've tried baking it longer, but it doesn't solve the issue. I wonder if there's a way to fix this? Maybe adding another egg? Other reviews mention adding chocolate chips, maybe I'll try that.

I made this as a Christmas present for my sisters who absolutely loves pecan pie. She said it was the best pecan pie she has ever had. I’m no connoisseur like her, but I also thought it was delicious! The only difference I made was that I chopped the pecans finely for her (she has TMJ) and used only about 1 1/2 cups pecans chopped.

Ok this is going to be my go-to each year. Loved this! I used dark corn syrup instead of light, added 1 tsp vanilla. I used pecan pieces, not halves, and only used 1 1/2 cups. Might add some cinnamon next time, not sure. Love it!

I added a VERY yummy whipped topping.  Whipping cream- whisk ALOT. Add  burbon, whisk a lot more and  10x sugar to sweeten up. Whisk until you get the fluffyness you like. Taste.... add more bourbon? Taste. Add more bourbon?? Lol.  Please try it! AWESOME!!!!!

I had not made pecan pie in ages, and as a bourbon lover wanted to try this out. 2 things of note: I agree with some others, reduce the pecans to about 1 1/2 cups; mine came out a little underdone, but I think it was because I was nervous about overcooking it and I'm still getting used to my oven in my new place. That said, everyone loved it and the bourbon flavor was not at all overwhelming, so it may depend on which bourbon you use. Being an Oregonian, I used my favorite local one, Burnside Bourbon. I will definitely make this again ,with the above mentioned modifications.

I make this pie every Thanksgiving and follow this recipe almost exactly, EXCEPT for one part: soak the pecans in the bourbon overnight before baking the pie.

This pie was easy and so good. Changes I made was putting  in some Pampered Chef cinnamon spice blend and I baked it ubtil it was not runny. About 20 min more , 5 min at a time. I live in Sheridan Wyoming at about 3500 ft. Making it again for Christmas by request.

So I used Fireball Whiskey instead of bourbon on a whim.  I was pleasently surprised!  Just the hint of cinnamon from the whiskey and a dash of vanilla and it was hands down the best pecan pie I have made to date.  Looking forward to sharing it during holiday parties!

Absolutely delicious!  This was first pecan pie I ever made from scratch and it was perfect.  I didn't have bourbon, so I instead added 1 tablespoon of Amaretto.  YUM!  Will definitely make it again.

I've been making this pie for years. I made a few little changes. I add an extra half cup of pecans and an extra tablespoon of bourbon. Everyone loves it.

My whole family (extended) loved this. It was a great alternative to the traditional pecan pie. My uncles claimed (joking) they could drive because of the bourbon but I am now required to make this every Thanksgiving.
