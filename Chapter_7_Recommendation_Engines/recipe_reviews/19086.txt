This was great!  My grandma had this same recipe, but a couple of things were different, and I think it would help with some of the things that others complained about.  First, use 1/3 cup milk instead of 2/3 cup water in the batter.  Second, use 1/2 cup strawberries (undrained) for the cake.  For the icing, my grandma's recipe called for 1/2 cup margarine, 1 - 1 1b. box of powdered sugar, and 1/2 cup of strawberries, DRAINED.  That makes a TON of icing, so I halved it, and it was the PERFECT amount:  1/4 cup margarine, 2 cups powdered sugar (which is 1/2 a box), and I still use 1/2 cup of strawberries, DRAINED.  Excellent cake!!  Thanks for the recipe - now I have it online!

I took a reviewer's advice and used the 1/3 cup milk instead of the water. I'm glad I did. I was afraid the edges would burn before the center was done, but the cake turned out spectacular. I added 1 1/2 Tablespoons of lemon juice because the batter tasted way too sweet. I mashed the strawberries, then added them to the cake batter. I'm not sure if this is the proper way to prepare the cake, but it turned out fine. I used a 6oz package of gelatin; half for the cake, the rest I put in my  cream cheese frosting recipe made with less sugar and a tablespoon of strawberry all-fruit preserves. If you take this suggestion, make sure to adjust the sugar in your frosting for the sugar in the strawberry gelatin. I didn't use the frosting suggested because I thought it sounded way too sweet and bland. I cut each cake layer in half to get more frosting in the cake because the cream cheese frosting with strawberry flavor is excellent.  My family loved it.

The cake was fantastic, but the icing wasn't - too sweet for me.  I made the cake again, this time taking the vanilla cool-whip and mixing that with some of the strawberries in syrup (about five oz of the strawberries).  I decorated the top of the cake with whole strawberries cut in half placed all over the cake.  This time the cake was PERFECT!  LOL.  Had a lot of great comments on the cake the second time.

As a cake decorator I am always looking for a new recipe to 'wow' my customers.  This one gets rave reviews everytime!  I do not use their frosting, however.  I torte the cake and use a strawberry filling between the layers.  This is a moist, delicious cake that even held up to the weight of fondant!  Definitely try this recipe!

I used this recipe as a wedding cake with the frosting as the filling.  The groom said it was the best cake he has ever eaten.  I didn't use any extra liquid in the frosting.  The strawberry juice in the frozen strawberries was enough.

Yummy! Easy! I didn't have strawberry jello, so I used raspberry and it worked just fine. I've also made this recipe without the jello, it was still good, just not PINK. ;) Thanks for a great strawberry cake recipe!

This was just o.k.  The cake itself was good, but the frosting was too sweet and did not mix up well.

Excellent! I substituted real butter for the margarine because I avoid trans fats.  I also dyed my frosting a shade of pink not found in nature using some magenta toned food coloring paste I had in the house, hence the color in the picture :)

Very good cake my family and friends always request. I make a sheet cake and layered cake but its  usually too much frosting. To make the frosting the right consistency, use only a teaspoon of remaining strawberries & juice at a time until you get the desired spreading consistency. I have never had to use the milk. Also don't melt the margarine if you want frosting consistency.

AWESOME!!!  I made this for a get-together with friends and everyone loved it.  I did change a few things..... I didn't have white cake mix, so used strawberry with cherry jello.  It was wonderful!  As others stated about the frosting, the milk was not needed, nor do you need to melt the margarine.  I used the 4 Tbs margarine, 4 cups confectioners sugar, and the strawberries, then added a half tub of Cool Whip.    Thank you so much for sharing!

Very good cake--I didn't make the frosting, though.  I used cream cheese frosting.  I made cupcakes and just used the directions on the box for the cupcake time, and I set the oven at 350.  If I set a baked good at 325 it takes way too long in my oven.  The cupcakes took about 28 min--a little longer than the box stated, but I'm thinking it's due to the strawberries in the cake. I think I might defrost the strawberries a bit next time; they kind of were hard to mix in with the handmixer and a few flew out.  Nice cake, though, and it turns out a nice pink color.  thanks for the recipe!

My family loved this but I changed things based on reviews.  I cut the sugar way down and it was still very sweet.  I added more strawberries and a container of cool whip to the frosting.  (The consistency of the frosting was very thin otherwise.)  After frosting, I placed the cake in the fridge and let the frosting thicken.  I added strawberries on top just before serving.  Wonderful!

This was very good, the only reason I gave it 4 instead of five stars was because I made some changes, I took other's advice and used 1/3 cup of milk and instead of strawberries, I used about 1/2- 3/4 of a cup (I didn't measure) of strawberry Jelly, which I've only seen at safeway (and maybe Ray's??) I'll be using this recipe for my daughter's first birthday cake and I do not want seeds or chunks of strawberries in it. it tastes great, even with my modefications!

Very tasty and flavorful cake. I was skeptical at first but it turned out beautifully. I made cupcakes with it and remember to only fill the cup half full as it puffs up big. I also substituted 1/3 cup of milk for the water and I didn't use the frosting recipe I used cream cheese frosting II instead. I will make this again!

I have been baking cakes for years.  You will have to bake this alot longer than 30 min., and definitely not at 325, but 350. The icing was like water and I had to take half of it out add more sugar to thicken.  My suggestion is to not add milk, and not melt teh butter. This cake is much too sweet.

The strawberry cake has a wonderful flavor although the frosting is very sweet. It requires a longer baking time and it almost looks brownish by the time it finally tests done.  I either make two cakes and use one frosting for both or my family likes the cake with cool whip on top.

Took this to an Easter dinner and everyone raved about this cake. It was a success. I baked it at 350 for 40 min. and did not need to add the milk to the icing.

Every time I make this recipe it gets rave reviews. I do not like the frosting though. I have never gotten it to set. It is too runny and doesn't set on the cake good. I usually just use store bought frosting.

My family loves this cake they ask for on every chance they get. I even made a whole sheet cake for my brother graduation.I used cream cheese frosting and decorated it with fresh strawberries and people were to busy standing at the cake table eating cake to even talk to each other!

The cake was good (really sweet) but the frosting was way too watery. I made it and had to buy frosting in a jar to put on it. Everyone liked the cake though. I put a slice of strawberry on the top of each piece of cake after I cut it into small squares.

Got rave reviews and co-workers asking for the recipe.  I did add 1/3 cup milk & 1/3 cup strawberry juice to make the 2/3 c liquid.  I bought 16 oz. of strawberries so added about a cup of strawberries and used the remaining in a cream cheese frosting I made.  I omitted the butter in the cake and could not tell a difference - it was plenty moist.  Served with vanilla ice cream as I feel it takes the edge off the sweet.

Delicious moist cake.  Was a real hit with the family.  I used frozen strawberries that I had recently picked.  I had to freeze most the cake to keep me from eating it all!!

This recipe did not go together as stated in the recipe. The oven setting should have been 350 degrees, it needed to bake at least 45 min and the frosting came out as a glaze instead of a frosting and I didn't even add the milk. Only have of the strawberries should be added to the confectioners sugar and add more if you need a better consistency. Overall, good, but disappointing.

This is an easy to make cake with wonderful strawberry flavor!  I used a combination of fresh and frozen strawberries, and it turned out great.

This cake was amazing! I made it for my daughter's birthday. My only trouble was that my strawberries were too juicy for the icing. So I had to add a bunch of extra powdered sugar so that the icing wouldn't be glaze. I will definitely make it again.

I made this exactly as written. The icing is very sweet. And, for some weird reason, the cake layers (while very tasty) did not turn out pink.
