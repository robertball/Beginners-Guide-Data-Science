Very good in all honesty, but for a pasta salad it needs some extra goodies in there.

I was looking for something quick and easy to make for lunch and found this pasta :D It's a super cheap pasta to make (YEAY) healthy and it takes very little time to make :D Only change I made is that I used spinnach instead of lettuce :D
It's not the best pasta in the world but its a fantastic lunch dish omnomnomnom

I made this for a pot luck.  Everyone loved it.  I thought just a little bland so I will add a little more seasonings to it next time I make it.

My husband loved it. Only change I made, I used one bag of classic romaine lettuce instead  of the head of romaine.

Wonderful salad for a crowd.  I used 1 lb of bacon and 3 heads of romaine lettuce otherwise the dressing would of been too heavy.

My sister made this and substituted a small diced red onion for the onion powder. It needed a little more flavor so she added Italian dressing as was suggested in another recipe.
