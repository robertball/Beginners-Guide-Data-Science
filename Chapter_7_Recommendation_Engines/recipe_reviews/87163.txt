I prepared the marinade exactly as written. Any substitutions, in my view, would certainly impact the overall flavor intended.  We were not disappointed, although hubby thought it was a little salty, even though no additional salt was added. This was a unique combination of marinating ingredients where no one ingredient stood out, creating a flavorful shrimp not dominated or obscured by other seasonings. There is no oil in the recipe, but there IS oil in the curry paste, so if you substitute curry for the curry paste, I'd recommend adding a little vegetable oil to the marinade. We cooked these on the indoor grill on bamboo skewers. I brushed a bit of melted butter over the grilled shrimp skewers for a little richness and shine. Perfect in mere minutes, beautiful and delicious.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Stellar. The weather was not conducive to grilling, so I poured the shrimp and the marinade into a skillet and simmered until the shrimp was done. My wife, daughter and I all loved it. My son, well, he is a spice-wuss so he didn't eat, but he said he liked the flavor if it wasn't so hot.

The flavor was great on these. I used curry powder sice I didn't have paste. I am giving it a 4 star because they turned out a bit dry. No one else complained of this, so it must have been me though, and not the recipe. I'll certainly make it again though. They were still great.

Great recipe.  I used red curry paste, and spicy mustard with the rest of the ingredients, and marinated it overnight.  Then I grilled it...totally delicious, and really spicy, due to the amount of paste I used. I had it with grilled pineapple slices on the side.  Would be great over rice or noodles for the next time I make it.

This was very tasty.  I like spicy so much, the second time I made it I didn't put the shrimp on the skewers, I cooked them in a tin foil "boat".  Was way to spicy, I'll stick to the original.

hmmm The sauce was tasty, and I also threw the whole thing in a skillet for a few minutes, then put it on top of South Beach-friendly cauliflower rice and mushrooms...but I didn't taste so much flavor in the shrimp itself, and to marinate it any longer would have turned it to mush (how do you people marinate seafood for a day without that happening??)'
I'm going to work on this one, it has great potential...

I followed the recipe just as indicated. Other than a kick to them, they were alittle bland for my liking taking into consideration all the ingredients. I would do this again and modify it some what.

Good stuff! This had a very unique taste, and was much different than the normal shrimp recipes. Very easy, and quick as well.

So yummy! Just enough spice and 2-3 fit perfectly on a skewer so there is little mess for your guests! Would also be very tasty over rice. Thanks!

I agree with the reviewer who said the marinade was good, but the flavor never really got into the shrimp. I did as directed with the exception of using lime juice instead of lemon (lime seems more in keeping with Thai flavors than lemon, to me at least).  We served it with cilantro/ginger rice and edamame.  It was ok, but not a must have again for us.

5 star because this is such a versatile recipe.  I have used this recipe to marinade chicken/shrimp/fish steaks before grilling.  Great summer recipe!
Serving over cous cous is a great addition!

I couldn't find curry paste, so I used the powder, and after marinating the shrimp, I poured the whole thing over vegetables (peppers, zucchini, onions) and grilled everything, unbelievable.  I am keeping the marinade for other grilled dishes.

I ended up cooking this in a skillet, and it still had great flavor.  Add a little corn starch mixed with cold water to the pan juices to make a great sauce.  Goes well with coconut rice for a more authentic experience.

I made this with Pataks curry paste (Indian), and large Gulf shrimp. Very tasty. I marinated for barely 30 minutes as I think the shrimp starts cooking after that and would be tough. Grilled quickly on super hot grill. Shrimp was very tender. Next time I'll add more curry as I like it really spicy and serve with a cooling dipping sauce.

I made this for dinner last night and LOVED it!! I'm a photographer, I usually try to take pictures of foods I enjoyed making to add to my portfolio, but I was way too hungry and just couldn't wait. I also knew from one quick taste test that I'd be making this again. Didn't have time to marinate for an hour, so I did it for 30 mins and in that short time I was able to test and enjoy each and every ingredient in this recipe.  All the flavors compliment each other. I didn't have curry paste, so I used curry powder and it was lovely.  I will be making this again for friends (to show off a little bit)!! LOL

Really enjoyed this recipe. The marinade is tasty, husband and 2 children loved too!!  I didn’t have uncooked shrimp so I just used precooked. I marinated mine for several hours to really set in the flavor. The other thing that I did was make a separate batch of the marinade (using only 1 clove garlic) to use as salad dressing for a yummy 'spicy Thai shrimp salad' putting the grilled shrimp over spring greens adding blanched asparagus and a little fresh cilantro and a couple tablespoons of the dressing. I’m having that again today for lunch and can’t wait!!!   Thanks again for submitting this wonderful recipe!!

Hotter than the sun! But, I loved it! I only used a small squirt of dijon mustard as it didn't seem to fit here.  Very tasty indeed. :)

This is delicious, I made this for a 4th of July party and nearly everyone loved it and two people asked for the recipe.  I didn't have curry paste so I used powder mixed with olive oil... it may not be exactly as it should have been, but it was delicious!

This was very different for us, we don't use a lot of curry and can't decided how much we really liked it but since this is our preference we'll rate it a four.  Make sure you like curry, I think next time I'll just use some cayenne and barbecue sauce.  Thanks for the post.

I liked these but I wasn't sold on the whole dijon mustard bit.  Next time I will do it without the mustard.  Were tasty otherwise and I too used powdered curry.

YUM!!!!

we just made this for dinner, and it was Awesome!

I used spicy brown mustard, very hot red curry paste (by patak's), and precooked shrimp.  We used the Foreman grill to just carmelize the sauce on the outside.  Served with the sauce over udon noodles.

very hot (that will depend on your choice of curry paste) and very good!

Killer recipe. The best part about it is how many minute ways you can tweak it. It is great with curry powder in place of the paste if you don't have it. A little extra sugar gives more sweetness, half lime and half lemon juice, etc. What I found everyone likes the best is to use 1 tsp. curry paste and add 1 tbsp Thai chili oil. Gets raves every time! Thanks for the recipe!
(Oh yeah, I use the garlic press instead of mincing. It seems to work better for marinading.)

Not a bad recipe, but I have to take issue with something called "Thai" that has almost no identifiably Thai ingredients and flavors-- fish sauce, kaffir lime, galangal, lemon grass, garlic, Thai chiles, coconut milk, shrimp paste, etc. The french-style mustard and brown sugar are distinctly un-Thai; "curry paste" is way too general a term to be useful in this context-- green, red, massaman, panang, yellow? Bottom line is that this is an OK recipe, but expectations are not met due to lack of Thai flavors.

Very tasty, as promised! I've never used Curry Paste in my cooking before... and am so glad to find we love it (at $5.49 per jar... LOL) Great recipe, NEDB... and what a nice change from the "usual" scampi, fra diavolo, cocktail, etc. Will make this recipe again!

Wonderful recipe!  I just squeezed in a small lemon.  I couldn't find the curry paste so I had to use curry powder and just sprinkled it in, tasting as I went along (husband doesn't like strong curry flavor). Being that I am lazy, I used my favorite organic garlic powder instead, and added a tiny bit more of the brown sugar.  It was a hit and we loved it!  I will definately make it again!

I don't even like shrimp, but I loved this.  I try to cook shrimp occasionally b/c my husband likes it, and I reluctantly ate this, but was surprised by how tasty it was.

These were delicious.  Loved the flavor and after marinating for 2 hours, the flavor was definitely infused in the shrimp.  Followed recipe exactly as written, although I didn't put on skewers; just tossed on a grill pan on the BBQ.  So simple, yet so tasty!  This will go into my rotation!

Good taste, quick and easy. I use pre-cooked, pre-peeled shrimp for even more convenience. The marinade becomes a little diluted from the water in the shrimp but I added a little cornstarch while boiling and it made into a nice, runny paste for brushing on the shrimp while cooking. Will make this one again.

Everyone loved the shrimp!  My boyfriend is allergic to shrimp, so we marinated some chicken in it and that was just as great! I added some red wine vinegar for the chicken to keep it tender!  Definitely a keeper!

Very good and very easy.  If you don't like spicy foods, then this is not for you or you may want to use less curry paste.

These were great, my family liked them very much.  Very easy to prepare and cook.  Used curry powder instead of paste as that was what I had in my kitchen.  Serve with rice or noodle side dish.

Wonderful!!!! 5 stars and beyond!  Tryed this paired with marinated grilled Chicken Breasts.  Very nice together.  I marinated the shrimp for atleast aday in a zip-loc bag.  I wouldn't change a thing with the recipe!  My guests LOVED it and the few that were leftover the next day, were delic cold as well. Zippy and a nice change from the ordinary.

i made this (exactly as written) last night for my boyfriend, and we found it to be good, but nothing stellar.   a few things: first, a lot of people commented here said they used curry powder instead of paste. personally i think this would lend the dish and entirely different taste since the two are made up of different things (curry powder often has a more 'indian flavor', whereas curry paste has more of a 'thai flavor.') i dont think they are interchangeable..that could just be me though.  second, although im a fan of curry paste, dijon mustard, garlic, and soy sauce, i found that the shrimp tasted more like lemon than anything else in this dish, and like other users, i wished that they wouldve absorbed more of the flavor.  the acids from the lemon juice started cooking the shrimp a little as well, so marinating longer wouldve been a bad idea. next time i wont add the lemon juice until right before cooking, and ill probably take it down to 1 tablespoon or less.

This was excellent.  The only thing I would recommend is increasing the amount of shrimp.  My wife and I made this recipe based on two people so we basically cut it in half which meant 1/2 lb. of shrimp.  We ended up cooking 10 oz. of shrimp and found ourselves wanting more.  It was that good!

I've made these twice, and they are indeed incredible!  My first experience with curry.  I am not a spicy fan, so I took another reviewers suggestion and used curry powder. Wasn't so sure about it when I mixed the marinade up....had a very unique smell and an interesting mix of ingredients, but the final product was delicious and flavorful.  My husband reports a new favorite, and my 3 year old cleans a skewer full in no time!

This was excellent even though I changed the recipe.  I subbed curry powder for the paste, because my store didn't have the paste.  I think that was the reason mine was not spicy.  I also used yellow mustard instead of Dijon (because I don't care for Dijon.) It was yummy.

This was just OK. I thought the shrimp rather tasteless. I think it may have more flavor if I saute it in the marinade. There really wasn't anything in the marinade that kept the sauce on the shrimp during the grilling. Maybe more curry paste would help bump up the flavor. I will keep it in my files, but doubt I will fix again.  Just too many wonderful recipes on this site to repeat an average recipe.

A wonderful, balanced blend of flavors.  This is our favorite marinade for grilled shrimp.  I use "Thai Kitchen" brand red curry paste.

I marinated the shrimp a few hours ahead in the fridge. It was winter so I also used the skillet and found the flavour to be amazing. Careful not to overcook the shrimp.

I did not marinate the shrimp for an hr. I mixed in all the ingredient in a bowl with the shrimp for about 5 mins and I stir fried them with olive oil. (just shrimp without the sauce).  When the shrimp are cooked, I put aside in a plate and pour in the remained sauce into the pan. Then, mix in a cup of heavy cream and 2 tbsp of parmesan n romana cheese. Cook n stir the sauce until it is thicken. Pour the sauce over the pasta and serve with the shrimp!  It is delicious! =)

If I could give this 10 stars, I would. This is one of the best marinades I've ever tried. I've even tried it with chicken and it was stellar. I have one comment for the people who altered the recipe or cooking method and gave 4 stars or less... How can you give a recipe low marks or say it "has potential" when you altered it? Try sticking to the recipe exactly as written and you may be surprised.. Thanks for this recipe!!!

Awesome! I used red curry paste (but only 1 tsp as I have young children who do not like too much spice) and I subbed pineapple juice for the lemon juice. Served with coconut rice and grilled pineapple. This was a HUGE hit with the entire family! YUM!

I didn't grill, but pan-sauteed. Mistake. Weird flavor and too strong. If I make it again, I will grill and use less dijon (maybe none, the flavor stood out too much for me) and less lemon juice.

I tried to cook it on the stove like another person did, but it really didn't taste as good as it probably would have on the grill. I would suggest not even trying it on the stove, and hold out for the grill.  It has potential.  That's why I gave it 4 stars.

Yummy spicy and easy!  Since my grill is buried in snow now, I simmered the shrimp in the marinade until opaque, then I added a bit of cornstarch to the remaining marinade to make a sauce.  I returned the shrimp to the pan and coated them.  I served it with the brazilian white rice from this site for a "mild" side since I wasn't sure how spicy it would be.

I made these shrimp for an appetizer party and they turned out fantastic.  Luckily I was able to find the curry paste at King Soopers.  Next time I will probably keep the shrimp on the skewers to make serving easier, instead of just putting them in a bowl.  Shrimp were on the spicy side, but had amazing flavor!

WOW!  This was the best grilled shrimp recipe I've ever used.  Easy and mouth watering!  I only made 2 changes (didn't have the exact ingredients in my pantry). I used honey mustard and dry curry.  Came out perfect anyway.  We made this for company...big big hit!  Everyone wanted seconds.  The recipe says 8 servings, but at our house it fed 4 adults.  Will definitely be using this recipe again and again!

I used Thai Green Curry paste for this which I thought gave it quite an authentic flavor. Over all we enjoyed it but if I were to make it again, I would omit the soy sauce - just personal preference. Thanks!

Loved this simple prep for grilled shrimp.  Nice touch of heat and spice.  I prepared exactly as written and added just a drizzle of veg oil.  Hubs grilled to perfection.  I'll use this many more times.  Thanks for your submission!

I tried these shrimp, smelled pretty good but the texture was really gross, maybe it was just the curry paste that I used, the taste of the shrimp was pretty good, but I couldn't get past the texture. Thanks anyways

Way too strong of a curry flavor (and I do like curry).  If I halved the curry there would not be much flavor other than shrimp.

The perfect combination of spice with a bit of "sweet". Next time will add a bit of chopped fresh lemon grass to try.  Delicious marinade that would be nice on pork and chicken as well.

wasn't what I was thinking when you say BBQ... however it's probably named that for the grilling part which I didn't do b/c we have no grill.  And no curry b/c my hubby can't do spicy.  I'm sure the spice would have enhanced the flavor but regardless it was VERY tasty and we ate with pasta.. what are you supposed to eat this with?  btw I marinated it for 3 hrs just b/c I was busy, but if it was a shorter time I wonder if the flavor would have stuck.

Updated - I changed it to 5 stars!  We added red pepper flakes and that definitely kicked these up a knotch!  We have made these almost every weekend and they are (obviously) quickly becoming a family favorite!  Thanks again!

These were VERY TASTY and super easy to prepare and make.  I didn't give them a 5 because they were not spicy.  Next time I make these I will add some cayenne pepper to the mix.  GREAT RECIPE FIND!  Thanks!

Very good for a quick meal. Didn't give it 5 stars because it seemed to be lacking some 'depth'. Perhaps next time I will add ginger as someone else had recommended or perhaps some coconut milk. Didn't have lemons, so I used lime, did have green curry paste which gave it a bit of a kick. I agree with another reviewer, you cannot interchange curry powder and curry paste and expect similar results. They are two very different ingredients. And for those who do not think they like curry (as I had always said) there are many different kinds of curry. I realized I do not like the yellow, Indian flavor, but do like the Thai red and green. Be adventerous and try them!

I'm reviewing the marinade since I used a Basa Fillet (grabbing what was available).  I also used curry powder & a small dab of Olive Oil, and instead of Dijon I used Garlic/Ginger paste.  I put the Basa fillet on some foil like a bowl & marinated it, & put it on the BBQ - the fillet was basically boiling in the marinade on the BBQ.  It was delicious!

Fantastic sauce. Not only have we used this on shrimp, it make to-die-for baby back ribs. I triple the sauce; marinate them overnight, reserving some sauce for basting. Incredible.

My husband really liked the taste of this. I followed this exactly and let the shrimp marinade all day while at work. I then put it on skewers and grilled.

Super easy!  I doubled the sauce and cooked my skewered shrimp on the griddle indoors.  I served the shrimp over salad with tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, and avacado.  The sauce was fantastic over the shrimp and salad.

I can't grill at my apartment, so I broiled. 

Fantastic-- made it last week, and am making it again today at the request of my fiancee!

I loved this recipe. It is important to find a curry paste to your liking. I didnt buy mine spicy so it wasnt as spicy as I wanted. Now I now next time but at least I enjoyed it very much.

Amazingly delicious! I used red curry paste (which I prefer to green) and I didn't have Dijon mustard, so I used the spicy brown mustard that I did have in my fridge. A little too spicy for my husband, but I loved it! My mother is Thai and I can't wait to make these for her. Definitely a keeper!

What a burst of flavors!  Definitely has a kick.  Used green curry paste (would have been delicious with red too) and pre-cooked shrimp.

Really good and simple recipe.  I used precooked shrimp and marinated them for about half an hour and cooked just to heat them up and they turned out great.

This was easy and came out great.  Rather than skewer the shrimp, we cooked them in a grill bowl (a metal bowl with lots of holes in the bottom and handles) -- It saved a ton of prep time!

This recipe is awesome! I am giving it five stars, even though I modified it. In my house we LOVE spice, so I followed someone's previous advice about adding red pepper flakes and being generous with the curry paste. It was awesome-super easy, and I marinated them for about 4 hours. Because of all the lemon juice, I used large shrimp due to all of the acid in the marinade-that will cause your shrimp to shrink up more. All in all AWESOME, but if you love spice like we do, I would modify it.

Big LIKE!  Wow...really good and easy.  There is a suble curry flavor, so if you are not a curry lover you may not like this as much.  Hubby said it was just "okay" but, he isn't a curry fan either.  I will be making this over and over again this summer.

only 4 stars but I think it was my fault - I forgot to peel the shrimp. There was a nice flavor but I didn't find the mix itself had enough punch ...maybe more curry paste next time. And I cooked them by broiling in the oven, so that may have been a factor too.

I thought it was worth a try and went accorning to recipe... except i added just a couple drops of fish sauce and sesame oil. I tried both chicken and shrimp. There is a reason this recipe is for shrimp. WOW... don't be afraid of the curry paste. I used 2 tsp and it was not too hot. Very nice flavor indeed. Thanks

This was definitely very easy to make, but i wasn't what I was expecting.  The curry flavor was just way too strong.  It just tastes like you took the shrimp out of a curry dish.  It didn't taste bad, just wasn't my flavor of choice.

We did not like the taste of this shrimp. The lemon flavor was too strong.  Also, be careful not to use cooked shrimp or they will become chewy when cooked again, even for a very short amount of time.

Holy Cow!!!! This was awesome. My wife was scared of the Curry paste but was surprised and very pleased that the dish came out not to spicy hot but just right. Thank you

Love it. Love it. Love it. My filipina girlfriend loves when i get recipes from that side of the world (i tend to stick to more american styles), so when i made this as a suprise, she couldn't stop saying how great it was.  Serve it over rice.. after boiling the marinade, if you have some left over drizzle it on the rice. It's wonderful.

This was very tasty. I wasn't able to marinade the shrimp nearly long enough (about 10 min.), but it still turned out super-tasty. I also used curry powder, as I didn't have the paste.

I thought this was fantastic.  I was able to use curry powder instead of paste (1 tsp powder)  I also used lime juice instead of lemon and I must say I was very impressed and so was my  husband.  He put it over fried rice and i put it over a sweet potatoe/yam.  I double the sauce so I could have extra for gravy.  i will make this again.

These shrimp had great flavor. I had no curry on hand so I used chili powder instead and it came out fine. I also sauteed these as opposed to grilling. My husband couldn't get enough!

This recipe was pretty good.  I'm not a huge fan of curry so next time I think I'll do like another reviewer and use chili paste.

This was so good and so easy to make!!!  I just made a few minor changes 1) I only had time to marinate the shrimp for about 15 minutes and they were perfect that way, 2) I broiled the shrimp on low broil for about 4-5 minutes on each side and 3) I saved the leftover sauce, heated it and then had it on the side as a dipping sauce.  Served this with steamed green beans and couscous.  Loved it!

I will have to say, this is my favorite way to make shrimp.  I did not have curry paste and substituted a tablespoon of Thai Chili Sauce and it works out very good.  Be careful though, it can get pretty spicy.

It was pretty good.  I followed the recipe exactly and once I tasted it, I felt that it needed a little more curry and a tad less dijon.  Just a personal preference and still very good.  I will make again with the slight changes.  I put the shrimp over coconut-cilantro rice.  Very good.

this was perfect. i used curry powder instead of paste, and it was excellent. i wouldn't change a thing about the recipe, it's super just the way it is. it was served with couscous and broccoli. it's spicy, so if you don't like spicy food, this isn't the recipe for you!

This was wonderful. I didn't think the flavor of the marinade would stay so strong after grilling, but I'm glad it did! I doubled the marinade recipe so I could baste while grilling and still have some left over to toss with the cooked shrimp at the end. Served with coconut rice and a Thai ginger salad to start. Delicious!

This is an excellent recipe Ned and altho due to sudden downpours we were unable to cook them on the grill and used the grill pan on top of the stove instead. Everyone raved over the marinade altho next time I plan on upping the amount of curry paste as I would like it with a bit more heat. Thanks so much Ned and there will be a next time!!

WOW!  We loved this shrimp!  The spice from the curry paste was just right for us.  My husband cooked this on a screaming hot griddle on the grill so some of the marinade got alittle carmelized.  Delicious.

Keep serving number at 8 - 1 pound shrimp fed 2 people for one dinner.  Other notes: Substitute about 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper for the curry paste.  Add a dash of oil (used sesame oil).    Jason really likes the lemon flavor and the spice level is just right.  Excellent reviews from the hubby!  :)

Absolutely delicious! Added 2 t. minced fresh ginger...was a nice touch. After pouring out about half the marinade, I sauteed the mixture in a bit of vegetable oil, like a stir fry. (I don't have a grill pan and we didn't want to fire up the charcoal grill.) Will definitely add this to our regular rotation of Asian recipes.

This recipe was very good, spicy with a litte cinnamon from the curry if you don't like hot, I used a mild curry paste and it was still good.

We really liked this recipe. I did make a couple of changes since our daughter does not like "heat". I cut the curry paste in half. For my own taste I added 1 tsp of tamarind paste and tsp grated fresh ginger. It was excellent. I personally do like a little heat and it was lacking in that area, so next time I will add more curry paste but keep the tamarind and ginger. Thanks for the recipe.

This was the hit of our cookout! Since I was making this recipe for the first time, I used mild curry paste, which added spice, but not any heat. If you really want to make these shrimp hot, I'd recommend going with the HOT curry paste.

this recipe was so good that my daughters husband ate a bunch of prawns plus my five year old  grand daughter tasted them and ate about five   their mom was complaining because she thought they didn't like prawns normally she would have had her fill but not this time because the others ate them as well   my grand daughter and her dad  normally turn their nose up at prawns

Everybody LOVED this! The only change I made was using curry powder and olive oil instead of curry paste because I couldn't find paste. Wonderful recipe! We will be having this again and again!

Prepared as directed, this is wonderfully flavorful and a quick & easy appetizer or entree. I've done them grilled and I've also just sauteed them in the marinade. When the shrimp are done just pull them out of the pan and cook the marinade a few more minutes until it thickens, then pour over the shrimp.

I'm not lying when I'm saying this is my new favorite seafood recipe. I was so tired of making the classic garlic butter shrimp, so I was looking for a change. I'm quite happy and will continue making this

I left the shrimp in the marinade for almost 5 hours...definitely added more flavor to the shrimp.  Served our brown jasmine rice with some salt and soy sauce over the rice.  Lots of flavor.

Very good but not spicey enough for my taste. Will definitely fix again but add Creole seasoning. I followed another reviewer suggestion and used lime juice instead of the lemon.

Pretty good.  I didn't baste them with the sauce, but there was still lots of flavor.  Served with coconut rice and veggie skewers.

I made the recipe exactly as shown and we all thought it was just OK.  The combinations of flavors was odd - I think the dijon mustard created a weird flavor in the dish and is not a seasoning that would be typical in Thai food.  So the result did not have a true Thai flavor.  I would not make it again.

Really has a bite and easy to make.  I marinated the shrimp in the refrigerator for 8 hours and then simmered on the stove and served over wild rice with pineapple tidbits.  I didn't have the curry paste, so used cayenne & BBQ sauce as suggested by a reviewer.  Very flavorful.

Easy and tasty. Hubby and I loved the flavors with just the right amount of zing. I didn't have lemons, so I subbed fresh lime juice which I prefer. Also, I had leftover curry paste so I used all of it which was closer to 1 1/2 Tbsp rather than 2 tsp. I cooked mine in a nonstick skillet (too hot & humid outside to grill) with a tbsp of coconut oil, 2 min each side. Served with jasmati rice (2 c rice, 4 c liquid using 1 can lite coconut milk + water to make 4 c total, 1/2 tsp salt, dash of lime juice, lime zest, and splash of coconut oil). Delicious.

Very yummy. However I didn't have any curry paste. I decided to substitute a Tbsp. of cayenne pepper infused olive oil and we were pleased with the results.

This was so quick, incredibly easy, and was eaten within minutes of coming off the grill!  The flavors are superb and you can adjust the heat with the spiciness you choose for your curry paste.  We did marinate the shrimp overnight, strictly for convenience, but I doubt there would have been any taste difference had we done it for lesser time.  Absolutely fabulous!

This was fine, but nothing really special. I marinated for longer than recommended and the flavor was still a little weak. It needed something. I'm not sure what, though.
