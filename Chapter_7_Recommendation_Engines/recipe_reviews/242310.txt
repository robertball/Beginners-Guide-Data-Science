I don't use tahini often enough to keep it on hand; have bought it in the past and ended up throwing it away (a waste of $$$).   The folks at the local Asian market told me that a good sub for tahini is a little peanut butter and sesame oil, so that's what I use.  When you drain your garbanzo beans, reserve your liquid, as I ended up adding quite a bit of water to reach a creamy & smooth consistency in the food processor, and that bean liquid would have added flavor to the hummus.  Also, doubtful you'll need to microwave your sweet potatoes for 15 minutes, mine were on the smaller side but were done in 4.  This hummus has a mellow/mild flavor with the subtle sweet potato flavor in the background.   The recipe doesn't say what size potatoes to use, so if you use large ones, the sweet potato flavor may be more pronounced (that would be a good thing).  Garnished with a drizzle of olive oil and some chopped macadamia nuts and sea salt pita chips as dippers.

I used sesame seeds, I didn't want to take the time to make the tahini!  Great, smooth taste!

I needed to add more liquid so I added olive oil.  We enjoyed it with pita bread.

Liked this very much. Nice for a change of pace.  We left out the cumin and it was still good.
