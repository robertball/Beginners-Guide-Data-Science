This is good, but I made it a little different as to stay lower fat. I popped the popcorn in the air popper and sprayed it with a bit of low fat butter spray. I used Bill Echols taco seasoning (minus the salt), which is also from this site. Low in calories and carbs and solves the salty cravings I've been having since I started dieting. My youngest son didn't care for it but my oldest son and I sat and enjoyed this together.

This was SO good! To cut down on the salt I made my own taco seasoning and used lightly salted microwave popcorn. Big hit and thank you!

The recipe calls for twice as much butter as needed. Because I've done a  lot of popcorn recipes I did a little more than half the suggested amount. Otherwise I found this recipe to be a little spicy so be sure to have something sweet or bland to balance it out as you eat it. Or you can put in a little less spice. But otherwise I found this to be a good recipe, but definitely not my favorite. There are many other flavors I enjoy more. Its almost as if it needs a little cheese flavor or other variation added.

This is way too salty!  Next time I will leave out the season salt altogether.  I would also double the hot sauce.

Made this for my boyfriend, he said he loved it. We used habanero hot sauce but followed recipe other than that.

In 2019, 1/2 cup butter is A LOT of butter. Next time, I will either reduce the amount, or drizzle a good olive oil over it. The taco seasoning mix and hot pepper sauce is a winner...but, again, maybe less is more: I say, taste-test before you dump in the whole amount!

Not particularly good. The butter with the taco seasoning had an off taste. I'll have to try and rework this recipe
