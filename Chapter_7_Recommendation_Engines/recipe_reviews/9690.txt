Fantastic cookies although they are somewhat labor-intensive.  Try adding an egg then you won't need to add the extra tablespoons of water at the end.  That makes them a little lighter and the dough easier to handle.

I remember my grandmother making these when I was a child. They rolled fine for me once I added the extra water recomended, but you do get a bit extra filling. A *GREAT* addition to this that grandma used to do is to frost the top cookie with a lightly peppermint flavored frosting. Sounds odd maybe but it's a great flavor addition to the date and oatmeal!!

These were really good. The dough was a little difficult to roll, probably because of the oats. I used rasins instead of dates. I doubled the recipe of both the filling and the dough. I filled the cookies FULL with the raisins, and the ratio of dough to filling was perfect! Maybe others were skimpy with the filling, or maybe dates fill the cookie differently! No matter....these were great....thanks Gordon! Oh...I also added a little cinnamon to my raisin mixture...yum!

Little date filled delights! Once i finally rolled the dough thin enough the cookies turned out amazing! although when the dough was thicker they turned out like tiny little biscuits which were kindof good too. try to use all of the filling it really makes a wonderful cookie

I don't know what happened, but they were just okay.  I followed the recipe to a T.  I'd play around with it next time and try to tweak it.

Excellent recipe! The cookie dough is so flavorful and combines really well with the sweet date compote. I think I made mine really big, but that let me put a lot of filling in each - which turned out super. Mmm. I will make these again.  The only thing I changed is that I added some cinnamon and some lemon juice to the dates.

For me, these cookies were just O.K., but my family and co-workers really liked them. The filling was good, but the cookie itself seemed to be missing something. They were a little time consuming to make, and I also had plenty of filling leftover. Not sure if I will make these again or try a different recipe.

I made these exactly as written.   The date filling was very good, but the oatmeal cookies were hard and dry and didn't have much flavor.   I baked them at 350 degrees for 14-15 minutes.  Maybe there should have been and egg or two in the cookie dough and possibly some vanilla extract.  They were okay but I don't think I would make them again.

This recipe was a blast from the past for me, when I was little my mom made these cookies, with just a little twist; She cut the cookies out with half of them having a timble hole for the tops, then when the cookies were cool she would fill them with the date mixture.  When I came to mix the cookies, I had to add 4 more tablespoons of water to make them moist enough to stick together.
I gave these cookies for part of my Christmas presents this year, they went over GREAT!

Yum.  I think next time I'll add a bit of cinnamon to the dough and then roll out the dough and slice into squares in order to be more efficient.

This recipe is a good one, however, the dough was a bit stiff so I added some ingredients that my grandmothers rolled, filled, cookie recipe has.  It has made them much easier to handle with a little crunch around the edges and I used mincemeat instead of dates. Sour cream makes a rich, moist delicious cookie. Also try using the same amount of flour instead of the oats.

I found the dough fairly "flat" tasting and even though I rolled it out VERY thin..still baked up too thick and dry tasting..just like my Gram used to make!I'd prefer to find a way to make the dough a bit lighter and moister...these little devils could be used as weapons!Very tasty filling though.

My family loved these cookies. I however, wasn't prepared for the work they took to make.  I'm still very much an amateur with baking.  They tasted great though.

If you try this recipe, try the egg instead of water substitute.

I followed the recipe exactly, and had no problems reproducing it. I was a little disappointed with the texture of the cookies, they were a little harder than I would have liked. The taste is quite bland, I think maybe an addition of cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice etc might have been a wise choice.

Yummy! I read the reviews and tweaked a bit. I added cinnamon and an egg and cut back the flour to 1 cup. They were nice and moist. I filled up the cookies as hubby loves dates. I also added lemon juice to the date mixture while it was cooking. Definitely a keeper in my recipe box :)

The dough was blah and dry. Even tried putting an egg in it. Not worth making twice
