I thought these were fantastic! Soft, buttery, and easy to make. I used strawberry jam but will try raspberry next time. Thanks for a great recipe!

These were good, I need to roll the balls a little smaller and add more jelly.  I used strawberry and lemon preserves, both were yummy!!  You do not need to grease the cookie sheet these cookies are buttery enough.  If you have any fears of sticking cookies use parchment paper.  Thank you!

I made these exactly according to the recipe and they were fantasticly soft and buttery. I think I put slightly more jam on them than called for but I was guessing and just put on what looked good to me. I used blueberry, strawberry, and marmalade. All of them were delicious!

A fast simple yummy recipe, made with ingredients you are likely to have on hand.  A great buttery flavor.  I used apricot jam b/c it was what I had and it is my favorite--it was great.  Next time I will try to increase the jam to dough ratio.

Delicious!  These were so good and they looked so pretty like they came from a store.  My husband said no one would believe they were homemade.  I made three kinds using apricot, blackberry and raspberry.  They had a wonderful light taste.  I was a little more generous on the amount of preserves I put into the cookies so I made the center hole a little bigger.  Just make sure you don't make the indention too deep or it will fall apart later. Loved these!

tasty cookies, but batter is very dry and hard to handle. If I make them again I will add some water to batter and refrigerate before trying to roll into balls to bake.

These are exceptional cookies.  Moist, tender, and delicious.  I followed the recipe with the exception of kneading right in the bowl for easier clean up.  I didn't add the optional confectioner's sugar as they are slightly sweet and with the jam, they didn't require any additional sugar. They're amazing and my son said they were the best cookies he's had in a long time.

This was a very delicious and easy to make cookie.  I only had one egg on hand so was happy to find this recipe.  The only change I'll make next time is to make a bigger indention and use more jam.  Strawberry and black raspberry were superb.

These cookies were delicious!  I love shortbread cookies and these were good right out of the oven as well as later on after they had cooled.  I made them exactly as the recipe is written, no need to change anything!

They were pretty good.  I think rosenmunnar recipe was better.
