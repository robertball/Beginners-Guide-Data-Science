This was DELICIOUS!! I made this in my crockpot after I Browned the meat and added the rest of the ingredients!
I did adjust a few things...
I wanted to make sure I had leftovers and didnâ€™t want it thick. So, I just increased the meat by half a pound, used 2- 14oz cans of broth,  and the tomato paste with garlic and increased it by 1Tbl
Also, decreased the lentils to half a cup and added some diced carrots!
Served it with basmati rice and naan bread.
Everyone LOVED it and I had my leftovers for my family to pack for lunch the next day!
Definitely will make this again!
