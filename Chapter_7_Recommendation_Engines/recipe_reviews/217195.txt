The lasagna was very tasty. I would have given 5 stars but the pasta was too hard when I baked it for 1 hour. I would  recommend you cook the pasta halfway through in a pot and then bake the lasagna for 35 mins. Worked wonderfully when I did that.

I made this last night But added 2 extra cheeses It was Amazing there is no more left family and friends enjoyed it and loved it I also Cooked My Noodles Al Dente so It wouldnt have to cook that long and I put 2 tablespoons of Basil Pesto in the Ricotta Cheese and I used preggo Sauce n added 2 tablespoons of brown sugar to it. And I didn't reheat the meat sauce when i added the spagetti sauce because it cooks again while in the oven and i put a long alumium pan of water in the oven while the lasagna cooked at the top so it wouldnt be a mess and it was so moist meaty and chessy we Loved it will be making this dish again

I've made this recipe twice now. The first time I followed the recipe exactly, and as many people have commented, the result was dry. The second time I made the following changes and it came out perfect:
-- Partially Pre-cook the lasagna noodles. (dip in boiling water for 1 minute)
-- Double the sauce, and only add a half of a jar of water.
-- Have some extra cheese for topping the lasagna before putting it in the oven. Make sure the entire top is covered with cheese or else the noodles will be very dry.
-- Add dried oregano to the Ricotta cheese mixture.

This was an excellent recipe!  It was fairly quick.  You can use any sauce you like and it works great!  I did use two jars of store-bought sauce AND added the one cup of water.  I think cutting the liquid back just by 1/2 a cup would have been better, but nobody complained!  It depends how saucy you like your lasagna!  I will never boil noodles again!!!

Excellent! Lasagna doesn't get much better than this. Major compliments and 'licked clean plates' at the end of the evening meal. Definitely a keeper for my recipe box. WTG!

I used a roasted garlic pasta sauce. I cooked about 1/2 c finely chopped onion, 1 crushed garlic clove, and some Italian herbs to the meat sauce.  Somehow, I layered wrong and found myself having only 1/3 of the cheese mixture to cover the lasagna noodles. Sp, I grated more mozzarella to be sure the lasagna noodles were well covered and also added a good bit of Asiago cheese. Grated Romano Pecorino (we prefer to Parmesan Reggiano) on top. Loved it.

Me & my daughters loved this recipe. It was simple enough for us to make it together as a family and the reward for our very little effort was a delicious lasagna. We look forward to having this again.

I don’t know why everyone is cooking the noodles before baking. If you use “oven ready” noodles, you don’t have to! I haven’t changed this recipe and make this all the time and it’s wonderful! I do use Preggo Italian sausage and garlic sauce, it does add the extra meat but by no means have I “changed” anything. Thanks for sharing a super easy and tasty recipe!

I changed some things and used this recipe mostly as a guide. I added seasoning to turkey meat since we don't generally use red meat in my house. Added; salt, black pepper, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, and basil. I didn't have any parsley to add to the ricotta mixture but it didn't need anything extra. This only needed 45 minutes in the oven with my "no-boil" lasagna noodles. It turned out deliciously! I'm having a hard time imagining how this will make it through the night for leftovers tomorrow.

Recipe was great. The only thing I did different was letting it cook longer with and without the foil on. Plus a pan of small amounts of water.

Absolutely delicious. I make this recipe at least once a week here. Only thing is cook the noodles until done before hand. I also add Italian sausage instead of hamburger meat and that definitely adds the perfect flavor! I recommend this 100% and it's easy to make

I didn't use the ricotta or parmesan because I didn't have those. Instead I shredded 2cups mozzarella cheese and 1 cup cheddar and used 15oz. cottage cheese with wheat noodles. Still came out fantastic. My husband loved it

This is a great base recipe, however, I always tend to make some minor changes to most recipes. Hold the water until right before baking and only use 1/2 cup around the edges of the lasagna in the pan. Add a small can of tomato sauce to the sauce mix, season with dried oregano, garlic salt, pepper, and minced onion. Spray foil with cooking spray before baking to prevent sticking. Yum!

I've made this a few times now. The only thing I've changed is using more sauce. We thought it was a little in the dry side. It is very easy and very good.

Easy & Delish!  I, also, added an extra jar of sauce & only used 1/2 cup of water.  Thanks for the tips.  I also added 3 chopped garlic cloves & 1/2 chopped white onion to meat mixture.  Will use sausage next time for even more flavor!  Overall a GREAT recipe!  Kiddo's & family all loved it! Will make often!

Pretty good. Simple recipe, easy to follow. The quantity was enough for the entire week- I live alone; so it worked great! I did precook the noodle so it’s to avoid any possible problems whilst in the oven

The recipe called for no salt on beef. It was too dry. It for sure needed more sauce.

I would add more Italian seasonings, and use some ground Italian sausage with the beef next time, but overall it was good.

Delicious!! I did do a couple things different with it. I cooked the noodles a bit before assembling it. I used 2lbs of mild Italian sausage, one jar barilla pasta sauce and a can of Italian stewed chopped tomatoes. And I also used a little more mozzarella cheese and a whole 16oz run of whole milk ricotta cheese. Baked it as the recipe said to. The family devoured it!! I will be making this again!!

Tastes amazing but I couldn’t complete all the layers because I ran out of meat and cheese. I would double the recipe next time and that should do the trick! But it was easy to follow and is delicious!

I had leftover meatballs, sauce and sausages so I used that instead of ground beef.  I also cooked the lasagna noodles to al dente. Everything else I did the same. It was simply delicious and simply easy to make. Thank you for a great recipe!

Tasted great.   Misunderstood directions and blended everything together and layered with the noodles.   Not as pretty for sure, but it tasted really good and was not dry.

I would eyeball the 1 cup of water, you may not even need it. I added onion and garlic to the beef as well as the 1 cup of water this recipe calls for at the end. This recipe is easy and quick but the water masked all the flavors I had going on. I couldn't taste the onion, garlic, parsley, or the seasonings I added to the beef. Good recipe just watch it with the water.

I made only half a recipe as I am cooking for only two of us. Good the first time and also when heated for lunch two days later. Easy, too. The very first time I have ever made lasagna and I am in my 70's!

My family loved it, as did the guest we had over that evening.  I did make more cheese mixture as with any lasagna that I make, I never seem to have enough cheese mixture once I try to spread it around.  I will make it again.

I used venison. It was delicious. My boys gobbled it up!  I also pre-cooked the noodles for approx.  5 minutes to make them a bit more tender.

This lasagna was amazing! I love it! I did listen to the advice of the other reviewers and used extra sauce. I used a 45 oz jar of Traditional Prego and didn't add any water. Other than that, I just made sure to season every layer well (including onions in the ground beef, and 2 garlic cloves in the sauce), and I also used oven ready noodles. It came out slightly sweet with lots of deep rich flavor and delicate layers. Yum!

This was great.  The cheese/egg mixture tasted perfect, but I did two things that made mine kind of dry: I didn't use the whole can of sauce as I thought it might have been too much, and I didn't cover with foil as directed.  It still was good, but not as saucy as I would've liked.

This was my first time making lasagna and it was fantastic! I read all of the reviews before making so I tweaked it a little. I cooked the noodles halfway before putting in the oven and only baked it for 35 to 40 minutes. I only had 1 jar of sauce but next time will use 2 jars of sauce. I will probably add 2lbs of meat and 2 jars of sauce.  I also added 1/2 cup of water instead of 1 cup. Overall this was really good.

The family enjoyed this recipe, I personally prefer a juicer lasagna with more sauce and have never been a fan of ricotta cheese.  This recipe is dry with the amount of ricotta cheese.  I'll stick to my old recipe.

Very easy to make. I was a little concerned about it making 12 servings, but it does. The only thing it is missing is the extra spices and dimension of flavor a more complicated recipe would include. But for easy and quick, this works.

I made this recipe exactly as written except the sauce I used was 2 oz. more and it came out very, very dry.

I tried this recipe and took the advice of most of the reviewers: added two jars of sauce (two different sauces), a 1/2 jar of water, extra cheese (mixed cheddar and mozzarella) and added oregano. I sort of pre-cooked the noodles but in the future I may try cooking them all the way (the noodles were a tad doughy but I think I also should let it have cooked longer in the oven but it didn't ruin the meal at all). I boiled water and put the noodles in there to soften them not really cooked them. I used 93/7 ground beef, so the meat was not greasy or high in fat. I must admit the assembly of the lasagna was not inspired. I thought I was putting it together wrong because the ricotta mixture wasn't easy to lay down and was clumpy (I had a hard time spreading it over the noodles) however in the end, it didn't matter this was delicious. Once everything cooked it blended together like you would expect lasagna to be. I would make this again. This definitely a go-to recipe for me. Thank you reviewers for the added advice.

Amazing!! Literally all my family members ask me to make this. The tip I found most helpful was to dip the noodles into boiling water for about 1 minute. Also use 2 jars of sauce instead of one.

I added more sauce and mozzarella cheese. Baked it for an hour with foil then uncovered for 15 minutes of baking. Came out great, noodles were perfectly done ?? Made a mess in my oven though ?? Oh well, lol.

This turned out awesome! It will be my go to lasagna recipe from now on.  I made it exactly as written with the exception of boiling my noodles three minutes as other reviewers suggest.  My wife said this was my best meal I’ve ever cooked! Thank you for sharing

Actually, for the simplicity of the recipe, this was pretty darned good!  I never leave well enough alone, so I added garlic, basil and oregano to the cheese mixture, about a half teaspoon of the herbs, 1 teaspoon of garlic.  I’d think of this as 8 “right size” servings, not 12.   Yes, I will be making this again!

This is the best.  I think the water added to the sauce made it go together better!   Didn’t hurt the flavor at all.  Recipe made a huge amount of lasagna so I divided up the cooked lasagna and put some in casseroles for later meals.  Love a meal in in the freezer!

Good recipe, I just suggest making more meat sauce then the recipe calls for. I send up running or and have to make more. Other than that, everything else turns sour great

I practically doubled the recipe to make it really fill the pan but it was truly delicious.
