Alternative: after carmelizing the onions, try sauteeing the turnips in the olive oil/butter for about 15 minutes (I added another T of both olive oil and butter), and putting it all the food processor, along with 1/4 cup tahini. Makes a really good hummus-like spread.

I made this with 1 onion and 1 turnip.  It is more like a salad than a cracker spread.  That's fine because that is what I was expecting.  Great taste!

I agree with the other reviewer, it was really good, I processed it in the food processor with tahini and added lots of lemon juice. It was a huge hit at a party I gave recently.

I used one half of a red onion and one small turnip as a snack for myself. I toasted some French bread and topped it with the relish, it was amazing I couldn't stop eating it! I followed the recipe pretty exactly and am so grateful that I did! I did add a little garlic and celery salt though. Wonderful snack and I can't wait to try it on a sandwich.

Rich and so good (more caramelized than in the pic)!  Didn't try to turn this into a middle eastern spread.  Just used the ingredients listed.  Might be good both ways - we liked it as written, but cooked longer. It had a mild horseradish affect.  Great on crackers - as per sueb (thanks sueb!).  Liked it on those crackers along with meats and cheeses.  An excellent addition to a 'snackables' kind of meal......  Might be good on a sandwich (rye bread and/or etc.).

This intrigued me as a cracker topper so I made it. I could not get turnip and did not want to use rutabag, so I used Jiccama instead. Although a little messy from falling off the crackers, it was delicious and I will certainly make it again. It was so good with the Jiccama that I will always use that. Even the skeptical loved it!
