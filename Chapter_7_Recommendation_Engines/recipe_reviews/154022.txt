I love the concept of this sandwich because my family likes ham and pineapple together.  As written, the cream cheese pineapple mixture is waaaay too sweet, and I didn't add the full cup of sugar (I just couldn't do it).  I would make it again, but would decrease the sugar by half or more.  My 9 year old loved it though, but it was because it tasted so sweet.

With these changes: I used lower fat onion and chive cream cheese to make it a little savory, 5 large drops of Louisiana hot sauce and 1.5 tsp Splenda with the cooked pineapple.

I really liked the cream cheese spread. It reminds me of the really good honey almond shmear at Einstein Bagels. I think the spread alone would be really good on a bagel. My mom thought it would be really good just on ham. The sandwich may be better with an open-faced sandwich,  so it had less bread or maybe more of the insides. I'm not sure, but it was still really good.

I loved it as-is, but I could also see making this with cubed ham or even chicken for finger sandwiches!
