These are amazing! We couldn't keep our hands off of these cookies. They're buttery and crunchy and perfect. We made one minor change to the recipe. The dough was really, really sticky, so we added 1/4 cup of flour to make it 2 cups. That helped keep it together, and, after refrigerating a few hours, we were able to slice it as directed.

Very good. Though, I did have to add more flour than stated (1/2 cp.) I used a 1 TBSP cookie scoop to make them uniform in size. I then floured the bottom of a glass, banged excess flour off by tapping the side of the flour container, and pressed them flat. I got 65 cookies from this batch. Loved them! Thanks for sharing.

I followed the instructions, except I used roasted black walnuts.  I didn't get the result that I was expecting. The exterior was crunchy and the cookie had a bit of a chew to it. I always expect sandies to be light, sandy, and delicate, where they easily crumble in one's mouth.  However, that might not be what everybody is after.  I've done m-ann's pecan sandy recipe from this site and the results were more of what I would expect.

I made these, but tweaked just a little.  I used salted butter so I didn't have to add to recipe. Also I used 1 egg.  I cannot see wasting the yoke,  so I just threw it in the bowl!!!   I have made these both with delivered almonds and pecans. My father in law couldn't stop eating them, not to mention my 60 year old sweet tooth husband.  They sure didn't last long at all.  Delish delish!!

I made these for my parents. My cousin happened to be at my house when I was packing them up to deliver. I gave her some to try now that's all both my parents and cousin ask for. They were a big hit! DELICIOUS!!!

The taste was good, buttery and sweeter than I expected,  but the cookies came out flat. I double checked the recipe to see if I missed the baking powder, but no backing powder was included.  I expected a thicker cookie.

I like to bake these fresh each morning......I use one log a day and they disappear!!! I add more pecans because we like a real good nutty cookie. Everyone raves about how good they are with coffee and milk!! Love these cookies!!

WONDERFUL!  I think "dashes" should be "cups" as I ended up using a little less than 1 1/2 cups- just enough to pull the dough together into a relatively manageable log.  My whole family loves them and has gobbled them up!

These cookies are easy to make and lovely to look at however I was not pleased with the flavor. I'm not sure what it is but it might be too sweet. Next time I'll make my old standby butter balls or some people call Mexican wedding cakes.

Absolutely delicious!  Best version I've tried.  The only thing I did differently was I rounded up and used 1 full cup of pecans.  Folks raved.  I will make these again for sure.

Melt in your mouth goodness. I made them sugar-free by using a mixture of fructose and Splenda. I also add 1/4 cup of additional flour.

Did the recipe, but did increase the flour by 1/4 cup.  I used a tablespoon scoop and then flatten them slightly.  Perfect.  Family loved them as well as the friends that I gave them to.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Followed recipe as written,  except, like others, added about another 1/2c flour.  They’re really delicious, and so few ingredients!  Love that.

These cookies are absolutely amazing. I've made these 4 times already. I made a mistake and added an extra 2 tablespoons to this recipe. Thinking that it wouldn't be a big deal. But, it was. It does not need extra butter at all. It changed the texture of the cookies and butter was oozing out of the cookie. It was ok just not as good as the original recipe.  You will not be disappointed.

This Recipe was nearly perfect. I used 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar.  And I used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup veg. Shortening.  Everything else I did as is. I thought this was really delicious and surprising for how simple it is.

still not Keebler Pecan Sandies quality, but better than the other pecan sandies recipes I have tried: I think the egg yolk did it as they don't flatten out. More of a shortbread cookie than the pecan sandies.
