We could not believe how wonderful these potatoes were!! We love, love, LOVE them!! I only wished I would have tried these potatoes for the thanksgiving holiday to impress my extended family...oh well, there's always Christmas! I used half & half instead of heavy cream, a touch more butter and mixed 1 cup cheese in with the potatoes and the remaining cheese was sprinkled on top as directed.  Wonderful!! Thank you Kat!! I plan to serve these many times in the future!!

Where is the 10 star rating? This was wonderfully delicious! I can't say enough good things about these potatoes! I have made them 4 times including Thanksgiving, Christmas (where I impressed my picky parents! Hooray!) and twice since! These are NOT your average mashed potatoes. In fact, they've now become my favorite! Kat, your a genius in my book!

I served this for Thanksgiving.  It was fantastic!  Without the cheese, it's smooth and savory-sweet and creamy, absolutly a dream.  I kinda felt that the cheese actual detracted from it, gave it a tart taste that didn't seem nearly as divine as the 'plain' potatoes were.  Next time, I'll be omitting that.

My husband loves these, and at Christmas a few days ago, my (petite) 11 yr old niece couldn't get enough of them!  I've done knock offs of this recipe when I didn't have all ingredients on hand, or didn't want to add the cheese, etc.  There's just something about the combination of potatoes with the little bit of brown sugar and cream (half and half, fat free half and half, etc), that is just very satisfying.

Great recipe.  I guess taste varies widely, cause I thought the amount of pepper was perfect.  I also baked the potatoes instead of boiling them. Thanks for sharing.

YUM!  I made these a few hours in advance and heated at 350 for about 45 minutes prior to serving.  They were excellent!  I mixed in the cheese instead of topping it.  I'm not a huge fan of adding sweetness to anything that's not a desert (or egg salad), but these were great, and everyone at Christmas dinner loved them!  Thanks!

This recipe was delicious!  I thought 2 teaspoons of pepper would be a lot, so I only used one.  Next time I'll use only 1/2 tsp., and that will be very soon!  Thanks for the great recipe, Kat.

We really enjoyed these mashed potatoes. They are a nice change from traditional mashed potatoes and were very well received by all.  I think you could omit the cream if needed.  I didn't mash them to the point of being smooth - I thought the chunky texture was wonderful.  Thanks for sharing!

These are awesome!  I did not have yukon gold, so I just used regular Idaho!  This was the perfect amount of sweet.  I also did not have the boullion granuals, so those I left out.  I think next time I will mix in 1 cup of cheese with the potatoes and then put another cup on the top because it didn't really melt into the potatoes.  It didn't matter because it was still fabulous!  I also used only 1 tsp of pepper and I cannot imagine it with any more than that!

Good recipe- but WAY WAY WAY too much pepper. I've made it several times since then and everyone loves it. I used more sweet potatoes, and have used Jack & Mozzarella (both worked well). Delicious mix of the original ingredients, though- just leave out the pepper!!!!!!

These were wonderful. Three of us polished off the whole batch.  I used just half the pepper called for and next time I would add more cheese.  I wouldn't make these for Thanksgiving like others suggested because it makes more sense to me to serve them with grilled or roasted chicken rather than with a meal that includes gravy.  Just personal preference, I guess.  Thanks

My family thought these we good, but not wonderful. My family said they would prefer I didn't make them again as the flavor didn't "rock their boat"!  Sorry I couldn't agree with the other reviews.

These just tasted like regular mashed potatoes to me.  I like the idea of broiling the cheese on top.  I think I will try that on other vegetable dishes.  Thanks!

Great recipe.  Love the cheese on top.  2 Tsp black pepper is WAYYYY too much, I will use 1 Tsp or less next time.

Absolutely a 5 star recipe. My entire family raved about these all through dinner. It never even occured to us to throw a few sweet potatoes in our yukon golds! I probably only used 3/4 cup of cheese if that and  mixed it right into a potatoes to cut down on fat.

I have made this several times both with and without the cheese.  It is excellent both ways.  The mixture of sweet and white potatoe is both colorful and tasty.  I used yellow flesh potatoes because that is all I had on hand.  Very good recipe.  Thank You

These potatoes were delicious!  I will cut back a bit on the pepper next time though.  I stirred the cheese right in--didn't melt it on top as called for.  This recipe is excellent for when you're serving mashed potatoes sans the gravy!  They stand well on their own!

Cut back on the pepper, and thought it was enough, however, still felt like it was a little bland, and needed something. Not sure what...

I love this recipe- would normally never think of mixing sweet and regular potatoes. I do cut waaay back on the pepper, because the 2 Tsp just makes it too spicy for me and distracts from the taste. I also leave the cheese off, my family thinks it tastes better without it.

I absolutely love these potatoes. They have become my Holiday Mashed Potatoes. I SKIP the cheese altogether - the heavy cream is plenty.

Delicious!  Even the kids at the dinner party ate them (with second and third helpings) and loved them and they all said they hated sweet potatoes!  Boy were they shocked to find out the ingredients after dinner!

My sister absolutely loved this recipe!  My husband does not like sweet potatoes and he didn't like this variation either.  It is a great new way to make mashed potatoes for the rest of the family, though (especially now that he is counting carbs!).

These were GREAT. I didn't have yukon gold, so I used a mix of small potatoes (yellow, red, and purple). I did not peel the baby potatoes - we like skins in my house! I had to add more cream because the baby potato mixture I used was a bit dry. I will definitely make this again!

Really good, and I am not usually a fan of sweet potatoes.

This was tasty, but I found the pairing of sweet potatoes with regular potatoes unappealing.

This was just okay for us.  I served it exactly as written, to about 6 people.  We always are trying new recipes.  No one seemed overly excited about it.  Sorry :(  Easy to make though, a good quick side.

OH MY GOSH - these were heaven.  I love potatoes and have an entire cookbook dedicated to just potatoes, however my boyfriend does not enjoy them at all.  He LOVED these mashed potatoes and had serving after serving.  My new favorite mashed potatoes.  I may have goofed up, but it seemed like a little too much black pepper... so I may cut that back a little next time.  Thank you, thank you, thank you for this recipe!

Delicious! As other reviewers recommended, I cut way back on the black pepper (1/2 tsp).

If you use sweet potatoes rather than yams it will come out in a greenish shade!  But my husband and I thought they were flavorful.

Ack, I don't know what's wrong with me.  I thought these were just so-so.  The color is pretty, and the texture was fine, but the flavor wasn't anything noteworthy.  Sorry!

I made this exactly as it appears and they were WONDERFUL!! I will try next time to lighten it up by using reduced fat milk, and will use habernereo cheddar cheese instead of jack, which will not lighten it but spice it up a bit.

These were easy to make and turned out great. I can't decide if I liked the cheese on top or not. Next time I just might serve it in a bowl and have people top it with butter, because the potato part was GREAT! I loved the combination of sweet potatoes, yukon gold and cream. I think the cheese broiled on top was overkill.

Great concept, but I thought it was WAY too much pepper.  I had to throw it out and do another batch, without pepper.
