These are really delicious.  Used applesauce instead of apple butter (who usually has that on hand, anyway?).  I usually only like desserts with chocolate, but I was gobbling these up.  ALL SEVEN members of my family loved them, no small feat!

I just made these and my sons love them. They said their taste buds were going crazy! I also had to keep them in the oven 12 minutes. I made a gluten free version for my husband using almond flour, 1/4 c. extra oats and 1 less tsp. applebutter and they are great!

My husband has been absolutely raving about these cookies. I only made a half batch to test them, but I can tell I'll be making them again - soon. I used homemade apple butter and white whole wheat flour. These didn't spread out really at all. I used my large cookie scoop to make these and got 23 cookies from the half recipe, so I believe the servings might be off a bit. I did drizzle a simple glaze (powdered sugar and water) over the cooled cookies. They were great without it, but this put them over the top! Thanks for a wonderful fall recipe!

I have my own AB which has lots of cinnamon, nutmeg, & clove already. But I doubled the cinnamon in the recipe and I think these came out great. My whole house smelled awesome!

These were not really what I was expecting... they were very bland. I added icing, caramel, and cinnamon on top to give them some more flavor, but I don't think I will be making them again unfortunately.

These are good, but very cakey.  Not the best choice for a week of lunch-boxes since they get gummy - but would be nice as a treat to bring for a meeting or something.

These cookies were delicious! The only substitutions I made were the following: sucanat for all the sugar ( only a scant cup of sugar), 2 tbsp apple butter (all I had) and the rest applesauce. Because I had to sub applesauce which had no spices in it I included a little more cinnamon, dash of nutmeg, allspice, and ginger.

For all the work they were very dry and not as flavorful as i had hoped. Ok with a big glass of milk, and they do smell amazing when baking.

Cook time is off.  I thought they would be a little sweeter and I doubt I will make again.

I had hoped to have the apple crisp taste in a cookie and I didn't get that from these.  They were a good cookie but more like a fruitcake cookie.  Just not what I was looking for.

I have tried this and they came out beautifully! Everyone loved them, I gave them to all my friends and they were gone immediately. They even appealed to health freaks because they are the healthiest cookies I've seen! SOOOOO Tasty!
