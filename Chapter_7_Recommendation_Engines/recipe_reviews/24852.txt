This recipe was okay, but my soup/sauce turned out to be way too runny. I found another recipe for a pork chop and potato casserole that's nearly the same except you bake the mixture after the pork chops are browned. Baking it made the sauce thicker and the meal turn out much better.

Everyone love this recipe.  I will be making it again.  The only thing I did different is fry up the slice potatoes ahead of time, which made sure the potatoes were done.  Thanks for sharing!

I made this for my Daddy who came over a day early for Father's Day.  He really liked it....so that's the only opinion that mattered that day.  I did bake it a bit (per another reviewers suggestion)and it made the sauce a bit thicker.  Thanks for the post...delicious.

Excellent recipe, and easy, too.  I added a cup of sour cream shortly before serving to make sauce creamy and mellow.  A "keeper" recipe!

Although not gourmet. This recipes definetly works and is quick with all items usually found in someones kitchen already. I did not add as much water or milk because my pot is pretty air tight. My pork was sliced very thin but was perfectly browned and moist. Any other recipe most likely would have dried out my meat.

This was great! But since I am highly allergic to mushrooms, I used Cream of Chicken soup, I took the lid off for the last 10 minutes to let some of the moisture simmer off so it was not thin.  This is a recipe I will be saving and sharing!

Really good. Everyone really liked it. Simple & easy. My stove has been acting up so I am searching for other cooking methods. I used my electric skillet & this recipe turned out great. I did add quite a bit of fresh garlic.

Made this last night with a few changes. I used chipotle salt and chipotle pepper on my pork chops before placing them in my frying pan that I had previously saut√©ed some cut up mushrooms in butter and placed aside. I cooked over low med heat with the diced onions being added after the flip, for two minutes on each side. In the meantime I mixed a can of condensed mushroom soup with 1/2 can 2 percent milk in a bowl.  I added this mixture, after arranging my sliced potatoes and mushrooms on top of the pork chops to my pan. After the first 15 minutes of simmering I stirred this mixture. I stirred up again after the second 15 minutes. The result was spicy, so use the chipotle salt and pepper sparingly. The spicy flavor cooked through the potatoes and sauce. It was yummy with a lot of flavor and I will make it again.

My family REALLY liked this recipe!  It came out a little soupier than I expected, but the flavor more than made up for it!!  My husband asked that we add it to the basic staple recipes that we always go back to.

This was delicious, easy and quick.  It cooked faster than 45 mins.  Closer to 30 for me.  The pork chops were very moist.

I made this wonderful recipe for the 1st time tonight & my husband had a fit over it!! I loved it too!! I seasoned the pork loin chops & potatos w/Tony Chachere's Original Creole Seasoning, so it had plenty of yummy taste!! (I'm not sure if you can get this seasoning where you are--in TX we can pick it up everywhere & i use it on everything!!)...Thanks so much for a fantastic & oh sooooo easy recipe!!

this was a very simple dinner.
I used red Season Salt on the chops for flavor.
Used red skin potaoes, unpeeled. then sprinkled with salt, pepper, garlic powder and a touch of crushed red pepper.
To make sauce thicker i used 2/3 can of milk instead of half. 
And lastly, i sprinkled a couple Tbs of parmasean chesse halfway through cooking. 
I will be sure to make again ;)

My family loved this. I did use cream of chicken instead of mushroom.  The second time that I made it I used shredded chicken instead of pork chops, it was also good.

I printed out this recipe years ago from this site and just found it last night and made it again and had to come and give my opinion. It is a simple and satisfying meal which my family really liked! The chops were a little tough, however, and the potatoes were quite soft, so I think I'll let it cook over low next time instead of med-low, or maybe not as long. I found that 5 small potatoes sliced about 1/4" thick worked great! I would not add more than a can of milk/water which is probably why some reviewers had theirs come out too soupy. Even if your potatoes aren't completely covered, as long as they've had a little bit of soup touch them they'll cook up fine. Thanks for the easy, yummy recipe!

This is a very satisfying meat and potatoes kind of meal that is not boring. I had to top it off with half and half to cover the potatoes since I ran out of milk and turned out extra creamy & delicious! I added this recipe to my recipe box and would definately make it again.

Add thickly sliced carrots to the skillet with the potatoes, and you have a meal.  My daughter HAS to have peas on the side and some crusty bread.  It's certainly not gourmet, but it is good comfort food, and kids seem to like it.

This did not turn out for me. I even seasoned the pork chops with salt, pepper and garlic before browning. Then once the chops were browned I removed them from the pan and cooked the onion and potatoes in the pork juices to give them some flavor and returned the chops back to the pan.  Added the soup mixture and cooked for 45 minutes.  After 45 minutes, my potatoes still weren't cooked enough. This was still VERY bland tasting and VERY runny.

Fantastic taste for basic pantry ingredients!  Before browning the pork chops, I sliced the potatoes and put them in a pot of water to start boiling to reduce their cooking time.  After browning the chops, I browned the onions and added the potatoes slices to cook a little more and slightly brown.  I premixed the soup with 1/3 can milk and 1/3 can beef broth with a dash of hot sauce, pepper, garlic powder and Worcestershire.  I put the potatoes/onions in a casserole dish, poured the soup mixture over and placed the chops on top.  Baked for 35-40 minutes at 350 with no lid.  Perfect - chops were tender and juicy, sauce was not watery and potatoes were fork tender!  This is being added to our regular meal rotation - thanks!

My normal way of making chops is similar to this so I had to try it.  I love it!  I usually go to all the trouble of making mashed potatoes with chops and I dredge my chops in seasoned flour before browning them.  Since I am attempting to make small changes in my carb intake, this was helpful.  Since husband is not a big mashed potato man, this fit the bill perfectly.  Also, I thickened the gravy with a bit of the leftover flour mixed with milk.  Since I did not have seasoned flour for this recipe, I decided to use just a smidgeon of flour to thicken the sauce.

I have made this recipe many times for my family and every time they love it. The only problem I, and my family, have is the amount of onions and potatoes.

Having probs uploading personal photo... anyways..I'm always looking for different ways to make pork chops..ran across stovetop porkchops and potatoes.. Had the ingrediants,except for the can milk..So I had substituted for 2% milk.. Made it exactly as the recipe called for.. Since this was first time cooking this recipe.. Instead of 6 pork chops, I had 8 pork chops.. So I should have used a bigger rounder pan.. Other than that, I thought was delicious..I love potatoes an the gray it made.. Had rice but I cooked mac n cheese with it as a side dish.. only because I've eaten rice for quite a while, and just preferred to have a different taste last night. I thought the dish turned out excellent.. It was yummy..

Made this in a deep skillet (with cover) and it cooked to perfection.  The only thing I did not like about this recipe is the pork chops were sorta bland... but my husband loved it!

This worked pretty well for a quick meal.
I did add about half a cup of sour cream for a little more bite.

I was a little bit disappointed with this recipe.  I prepared and cooked it just as directed.  I used thick boneless pork chops and Yukon Gold potatoes.  I found both were over cooked.  I will try this recipe again using red potatoes and will cook it for less time.

This is excellent!!  I also added 8 oz sliced portabella mushrooms and would again!!!
  I haven't tried it yet, but I think   this recipe might also be good with chicken.

The 2nd time i made this I used 1/2 can soup with 1 c buttermilk.  Great flavor..

This was very bland.  Don't try to cook it in a skillet as suggested (too shallow) or you'll have a mess to clean off your stovetop.

I love this!  It is such a comfort food.  I add a bit of sour cream to the soup mixture and it is wonderful.  Only thing is that I need a bigger skillet since this tends to fill up to the top.

Followed the recipe mostly but substituted cream of celery soup because we don't like mushrooms and added some cheddar cheese in the last ten minutes. Really good.

Quick and easy!  Pork chops were tender and flavorful.
I added garlic to the sauce, of course, because garlic makes everything better!

Added more boneless chops and increased soup to accommodate more mouths. Microwaved potatoes about 7 minutes.  Otherwise followed the recipe as written. Everyone loved it. Thanks for submitting it!

Easy go-to meal for my family! I add a package of frozen veggies about 10 minutes prior to the potatoes being done.  I then transfer everything to a casserole dish and add about 1/2 cup to 1 cup of sour cream before baking for another 15 minutes at 350. Great comfort food!

I have made this twice. First time I sub'd  beer for the  water/milk. It was excellent. This  time  I used  1 c. white wine and a 12 oz. ginger ale, added  1 teaspoon nutmeg.  We really like  some extra 'sauce'. OMG - do we love this recipe. So happy  I decided to try it.

I used 8 small boneless pork chops. Sauce, meat and potatoes were very white and you'll need some other color on the plate. Bland to me, but extremely easy, and my family loved it.

This is a quick & easy "one pot meal" that is hearty and yummy! But it is hard to cook the potatoes through without overcooking the pork chops. The overall flavor is delicious.

I added an herbal garlic spice and sliced fresh mushrooms.  I was pressed for time, so I used canned sliced potatoes.  I did not have cream of mushroom, so I used cream of potato. I probably will used 1 can milk next time to thicken it a little more. My husband told me to Save this Recipe!

This was OK.  I made some adjustments according to others reviews.  I didn't use any water at all.  I just situated the potatoes on the bottom of the skillet so they would get cooked all the way.  This helped the sauce be thick, almost like gravy.  I also added a little garlic for some added flavor.  It didn't help much.  My family liked and ate this dish, but it just wasn't anything special.  I don't think I'll make this again.  Thanks anyway.

This was ok.  The sauce was a little thin for me.  I seared the pork and assembled everything in the skillet, then threw the skillet into the oven for nearly an hour on 350.  Sauce still didn't thicken nearly as much.  I'd make this again only after I tweak it some more and play around with a little more spice.

Good flavor.  Next time I will not cut my potatoes so thin and stir them during cooking.  It looked more like cream of potato soup when the dish was finished.  Might try again and add more veggies.

when I went to pull out my soup I realized I was completely out of cream of mushroom soup, so I decided to use the "simple beef flavored gravy recipe" from this site. The end product was not very visually-appealing but the taste more than made up for it. The sauce never thickened, I put it in the oven too, but when something tastes this good, who cares?!!!

Good - the kids liked it too!  My potatoes were sliced a bit too thin so they got mushy, but that's my fault.  Other than thicker potatoes, I wouldn't change a thing next time.
