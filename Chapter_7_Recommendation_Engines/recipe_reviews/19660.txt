This is a great appetizer. Very easy and everyone that has tried it, loves it! I usually replace the chicken with pieces of sliced deli ham--it tastes great and a little easier.

Made my own revisions based on personal preferences.  I made 'Best Spinach Dip Ever' and 'Quick and Easy Pizza Crust' from this site.  I added bacon bits (quick tip- saw on Food Network the other day cut up the bacon with scissors before cooking it, worked so well). diced tomatoes, diced red onion and parmesan cheese.  It was muy delicioso.

So simple but so yummy!  I used a tube of Pillsbury pizza dough, so I made it into a rectangle and baked on a cookie sheet.  Used more like 1 1/2 cups prepared spinach dip and topped with grape tomato slices and quartered, sliced cucumbers.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for a work food day and there was nothing left by the end of the hour.  It was easy to make and it tasted great.  I will definately make this over and over again.

I've made this recipe several times, each time changing slightly which vegetables I use. The last time I made it, I used peppers as well as tomatoes and brocolli. I bet it would take good with shredded cheese as well. This is  quick dish that I've served as an appetizer but also as a light lunch.

Made my own spinach dip to use in this recipe. It was a big hit.
