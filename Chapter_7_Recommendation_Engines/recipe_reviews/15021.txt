This is a wonderful, thick and creamy, tummy pleasing soup, but I did make a few changes to the recipe. Too lazy to make homemade broth, I used boxed chicken broth instead of the water, and added leftover cooked chicken I had in the fridge. Not a fan of vegetable oil, I sauteed the onions and celery in butter. I didn't have any wild rice on hand, but I did have a box of Uncle Ben's long grain and wild rice, and I found the accompanying seasoning packet provided a bonus of flavor. The wine is a must and should not be omitted. This is a keeper recipe, with room for personal touches and variations.

I added flavor in my preparation, hence the 3 star rating on the basic recipe which I thought would be too bland as written...I need my garlic. The end result was amazing (better than any restaurant version) and well worth the time. My significant changes: 1)Three dried bay leaves added to simmering chicken; 2)replaced fresh mushrooms with 1/2oz of dried chopped up porcini mushrooms to the soup,the flavor was amazing; 3)sauted four chopped garlic cloves with veggies, 4)added wine right after sauteing veggies rather than at end of recipe; 5)added a handful of fresh sage leaves towards end of cooking because I have them (dried sage, thyme, rosemary or other aromatic herb would be great, but added earlier); 6)increased salt and black pepper to taste.  7) I used 3 bone-in chicken breasts (plenty of meat) and substituted 5 cups of homemade stock and 2 cups for remaining water in recipe 8) butter instead of margarine.  This recipe is a great starting point, but needs your personal touch to make it truly spectacular!  I've made this with and without wine, it really makes a difference. So does the dried porcini. Regular mushrooms just don't add the drool-worthy flavor.

My husband and I LOVE this recipe!  It reminds me of the soup at Panera Bread.  I made a couple of changes.  I use boneless chicken breasts, which I cook the day before to make it less time-consuming.  I couldn't find wild rice by itself, so I buy two boxes of Uncle Ben's and cook it without the butter or seasoning packets.  I use 3 cups whole milk and one cup heavy cream, and 4 cups store-bought chicken broth with 3 cups of water from boiling the chicken.  I serve it with Pepperidge Farm Sourdough Artisan bread and salad.  It takes a while to make the soup, but it's totally worth it!

I liked this recipe, though it was labor intensive. For those who had trouble with the soup not being thick enough, keep in mind you really have to stir the milk in the flour/butter roux for quite a while on medium heat. It takes about 15 minutes for it to get thick enough, and it should get so thick that it's tiring to keep whisking it. It might not seem like it's going to thicken but keep at it and it will. I didn't use bouillon but seasoned the water that I boiled the chiken in with lots of celery, garlic cloves, salt and pepper. It was still a little bland so I added a few dashes of worcestishire sauce and it was fine. I might put a little less wine in mine next time, it was a bit overpowering. I used Sauvignon Blanc but I think sherry might taste better. Real wild rice is the key in this, I think. Very nice.

I LOVE this recipe and have made it again and again.  My friends also request this recipe when I make it.  I substitute two cans of mushrooms for the fresh mushrooms and then I cook the wild rice in a chicken broth.  I also sautee the onions and celery in butter instead of oil and add some extra salt and it is WONDERFUL!

Yum!  I love a good thick soup... and this one did not disappoint... great flavor and consistancy...I did add a little garlic to the oil...and then added the vegies. (what can you do I am an Italian stereo type) I also used fresh cracked black pepper instead of white ground pepper.  To speed up the recipe... you can use boneless skinless chicken breasts...boil those...and use 7 cups of chicken broth instead of the boullion cubes and reserved stock.

This was the best tasting chicken wild rice soup I have ever had, other than going to a fine restaurant. My family loved it.  However instead of 4 cups milk I added 3 cups milk and 1 cup half and half.  Instead of 1 cup chopped onion (we don't like onion) I added 1 tablespoon dried minced onion. I added 3 tablespoons chicken base instead of 2 tablespoons chicken bouillon.  It was truly outstanding!!!!  Thanks!

I absolutely loved this recipe! My fiance is a huge chicken/wild rice soup fan. When we go out to eat, it's his soup of choice. I tried this recipe out on him and he said it was as good, if not better than the places we eat out at. It's in my recipe box already!

Great recipe but a bit bland. I used 4 cans of chicken broth instead of 7 cups water and that absolutely did the trick. I also used 5 minute wild rice which I cooked for two minutes, drained, and added at the very end. I omitted the wine but I'm sure it would be great with it as well.

this was a great soup.  Even though at first it didn't look like it was going to be thick like wild rice soup should be.  I put carrots in it.   I think it was missing a little something, then I ate it with saltines and wa la.  Also better second day.  From now on when I make this I will refridgerate it over night and eat next day to ensure the thickness I like.  Thank you.  I love chicken wild rice soup and even though I live in MN alot restaraunts don't serve it consistantly.

Oh.my.goodness this was delicious!!!!  This was my first attempt making a cream soup so I was a little nervous but this turned out soooo yummy!!  I followed the recipe pretty closely but took some suggestions from other reviewers.  I bought a rotisserie chicken and used boxed chicken stock.  I also sauteed the onion and celery in butter instead of oil and added some freshly minced garlic.  I also added frozen carrots (chopped them a bit before adding to the soup) and a bay leaf.  I left out the mushrooms because nobody likes them but me.  I also left out the white wine just because I didn't have any and didn't want to buy a whole bottle just for the recipe.  We all loved this recipe.  Thank you so much for sharing...I'll be making it often now that the weather is turning cooler.  Oh, and this only took about an hour from beginning to end because I took the shortcut of using the rotisserie chicken and store bought chicken stock.  :o)

Great recipe!  I did add a bay leaf and 2 mashed  garlic cloves while cooked the chicken to give it more flavor.  I also added fresh ground pepper and parsley flakes towards the end. I didn't think it was enough mushrooms so I did 2 cups instead of 1.  It was delicious!

I have searched everywhere for a soup that matched the wonderful taste of Panera's Cream of Chicken and Wild Rice and this is it-- I made a few changes, though-  First, I exchanged the water with Chicken broth, got rid of the cubes, and, in place of the mushrooms and onions I added carrots & peas I had boiled for about 10 minutes before adding them (it seemed to make it more child friendly). I also found those packages of precooked diced chicken breast at the grocery store- used two packages, as well as Uncle Ben's Wild Rice mix instead of plain old wild rice. I also added Spice Islands garlic and herb mix to counteract the natural sweetness of the chicken. I wanted mine really creamy so I exchanged one of the cups of milk for a cup of cream-delish! These changes saved a lot of time and some of them actually enhanced the flavor of this amazing recipe! My friend's fourteen year old sister came back for thirds and she's the pickiest eater in the world. I will DEFINATELY be making this a lot in the future- especially over those chilly winter months! Thanks again!!!

All the people that rated this soup 5 stars were CORRECT!  I did what Cara Jean did-rotisserie chicken, store bought chicken stock, no wine.  Added carrots, more chicken, and 2 cups wild rice.  This reminds me of Panera's chicken and wild rice but BETTER!  It still took me about an hour and fifteen minutes but much less than the original and way worth it!

Pretty tasty with a good flavor. I feel like it was missing something. Next time I think I'll add some carrots and maybe some more wild rice.

This soup is WONDERFUL! I always get so many compliments on this recipe. To make it a million times easier (and tastier in my opinion), I sub shredded rotisierre chicken in. I also use 7 cups of store bought chicken broth instead of the 7 cups of water. I omit the white wine at the end. This is a sure crowd pleaser!

This was delicious!!  I live in a small town in Argentina so I didn't have wild rice but brown rice worked just great.  I also didn't have celery or mushrooms on hand but added carrots and was good without the other two.  I can't wait to share this soup with my Argentine friends....yummy!!

I followed this pretty much to the letter. I do not like celery so I quartered it and pulled it out before adding the milk mixture. That way you get the flavor not the texture. I also left out the butter. Instead I skimmed the top of the liquid from the stock. My husband and I loved this. It is in my box already. A little labor intensive but definately worth it.

I found this recipe to be a little bland and I'm not sure why but it tasted a bit too much like flour even though I followed the instuctions. After a few adjustments (add corn and two cans of broth at the end) it turned out OK

This recipe is truly as awesome as everyone claims---better than Panera!  I made with a few modifications based on other reviews: no mushrooms (not a fan)but added carrots and some garlic with other veggies, used Uncle Ben's original recipe prepared as directed but slightly undercooked, added the wine after sauteeing veggies, used butter instead of oil, used leftover chicken breast and store-bought chicken broth, added celery greens during second simmering.  I will make this often and share with family and friends.  The BEST!

My dad and I love chicken and wild rice soup so I was really excited when he found this recipe. We didn't add the mushroom or wine and it turned out well though it wasn't very soupy. We made it a second time recently and this time whisked the flour and milk together to make it more smooth, added more rice, and added more milk- it came out awesome!

My husband and I tried this recipe with a leftover smoked chicken and it was big disappointment. We also used a Minute Rice brown and wild rice blend and instead of precooking the rice, we added it at the same time we added the veggies to the broth. I didn't think it would make that much of a difference if we used the Minute Rice instead of regular rice but I guess it does! Besides that, the soup was way to bland for us. I would like to say we would try this recipe again using regular chicken and rice, but I'm afraid we won't. Thanks anyway.

I made this for my husband and he loved it. The only thing I did different was I used chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken. You don't need as much. Otherwise, I didn't change a thing. Delicious!

GREAT CREAM SOUP!  Instead of water used canned chicken broth.  Cut up the veggies real little and used one carrot.  Also, substitued butter for oil.  Oh...I don't care for wild rice so left it out. After I sauted the veggies, I added the wine at that time. I will definetly make this one again.  Worth it for sure!

Good recipe. I made my own changes of course and just used regular rice, although I admit it would have been better with wild rice.

I love Panera's cream of chicken & wild rice soup. I just made this recipe and it tastes exactly like it! I didn't use the white wine and I added quite a bit more salt and a little garlic salt. I used an Uncle Ben's wild rice, Mushroom recipe. I also used carrots. I'm so happy with the way it turned out. I halved the recipe and it made so much I'm going to have 8 8oz. servings. I can't wait to eat all of them!

This recipe was quick and easy, and as my husband says "The best soup he has ever had".  One side item.  I didn't have a lot of time, so I used rotisserie chicken and 48oz of chicken stock instead of water.  Everything else I kept the same.  The chicken granules gives awesome flavor.  I cannot wait to make this recipe again.

This is absolutely AWESOME!  I used chicken breast and an 8 oz package of whole mushrooms which gave me more than 1 cup when sliced but since we like mushrooms, I used the whole package.  I sauteed the vegetables in butter instead of margarine and for added richness I used two 24 oz cans of evaporated milk plus one cup fresh milk.  I used two packages of Uncle Ben's Long Grain & Wild Rice (without the seasoning packs).  This was definitely one of the most delicious soup recipes I have ever tried!  Thanks!

I made this recipe after enjoying Chicken and Wild Rice Soup in a well-known restaurant for the very first time.  I tried it, I LOVE it!  On a rainy day the house fills with mouth-watering scents, and it not only turned out to be better than the restaurant soup, but it is now our ultimate comfort food on a cold wintry day!

I quadrupled this recipe and it worked great.  Upon reading other reviews of it being on the bland side, I went ahead and used chicken broth instead of water.  As it cooked and I tasted, I also found it necessary to add about twice the indicated salt and pepper, and garlic as well.  It is very creamy and delicious!

Thank you for this recipe, here in Chicago some of the diners have this soup, unfortunately I never get there the day they have it and it was great being able to make it at home and my family actually like it. Didn't have any white wine, only red but the taste is amazing. I especially like that this recipe doesn't require anything crazy and has ingredients that are in everyone's pantry.

Very good! The wine is what really makes it special. I followed the recipe just about exactly, although I threw a few garlic cloves and bay leaves in the water while the chicken was cooking (and later discarded them with the bones). I also substituted carrots for the mushrooms, as my husband isn't a fungus fan! The only comment, our batch needed significantly more salt. I used reduced sodium bouillion granules, so this may have been the reason. No problem to add the salt, but it seems like 1/2 tsp. would be not nearly enough for such a big pot of soup! Will make again, though, with these minor changes. Thanks for the recipe!

Oh my gosh!  A soup recipe  that doesn't involve carrots!  (I'm highly allergic to them.)  And I love wild rice.  This is soooo good.!  I used chicken broth instead of water and bullion, added more mushrooms (brown & shitake) and wine (as did previous reviewers) and had a giant hit on my hands.  My husband requested it with spinach salad for our anniversary dinner.  High praise indeed!

Wonderful soup, very hearty.  Used boneless chicken breasts and reduced pepper to 1/2 tsp.  Recipe was easy to follow and results are worth the time it takes to prepare.  This soup will be a favorite!

This was awesome! I used boneless/skinless chicken breasts, skim milk and regular long grain rice.  This dish has such a great flavor.  My 5-year old son, who is usually not a soup fan, gobbled it up and wanted it for dinner the next night.

This soup is very tasty, but as written, takes way too long to prepare.  I buy a (cooked) rotisserie chicken for the meat and used boxed/canned chicken broth.  Like others have mentioned, it feels like something is missing from this soup recipe, and adding vegetables makes it much heartier.  I have also made it with white rice instead of wild rice and it tastes delicious as well.  It also cuts down the preparation time.

Labor of love.  Worth the effort.  Upgrades:  Used a larger whole, chicken (more like 7 #), so every bite had MMM.  Sauted with garlic.  Added half box of Uncl Ben's wild rice.  Added Carrots at end.  Made for large group.  Night 2, had to add chicken broth when re-heating.  Better reviews night 2!!!

this soup is great. i think the directions could be made easier to save some time though.  i cooked the chicken then took it out of the pot.  i then poured the broth throgh a strainer and poured it back into the pot. i brought the broth to a boil and added carrots,onion, and celery, and a cayeene pepper[w/o seeds] i let it boil for 10 min. then i added 2 boxes of rice a roni long grain and wild rice and the chicken  reduced the heat to med/lo and simmered for 25 min. while that is simmering i mixed the butter,flour,and milk to make the sauce when it was thick i poured it into the pot w/ everything else stirred it in good and seasoned to taste.

I made this for dinner tonight. I am SO glad I halved the recipe. This made enough for 2 days of leftovers. I used homemade broth and chicken thighs, added garlic, 2 carrots and added some soy sauce at the end for colour. This was so good with a perfect amount of veggies and rice. Can't wait to make this again when we have company!! (I made this again as the starter for Thanksgiving and got nothing but rave reviews. I was even impressed at how good it was!)Thanks a million!

There are no words to describe how fabulous this soup is....I would give it 10 stars if I could. I have been trying all different types of soup this winter from this site....but this one is my favorite. I did change a few things. I used cubed fresh chicken breast instead of the whole chicken...6 c. water with 6 low-sodium boullion packets to make the broth...I added carrots and the leafy green tops of the celery...used a whole 6 oz. box of Uncle Bens wild rice(made with the seasoning packet)...used butter instead of margarine...used 2 c. 1% milk, and 2 c. fat free 1/2 and 1/2...and all of the wine suggested. So flavorful....and yummy....family loved this....and it made more than 8 servings(which is fine..I will freeze some). Absolutely delicious!!

This is the new favorite soup in our house.  Everyone starts drooling after a meal of roasted chicken, knowing that this soup will follow in a few meals.  I do use leftover roasted chicken and find that it provides plenty of meat for this soup.

This is a very rich and creamy soup.  I made if for my in-laws when they were sick and they raved about it.  My children weren't as thrilled because of the mushrooms, but the adults loved it!

I thought this was a great soup as I love wild rice!  I sauted some garlic with the onion and celery.  I also added some thyme and sage for more flavor, however I still think it could use a little of something else-but not sure what.  Any suggestions??  The wine is a nice touch.

My husband loved it.  Thought it was better than his favorite restaurant version.  I liked it. It seemed a little bland, but I can't think of how to improve it.  Teen age son,  "OK, Mom, but you don't have to make it again".

This soup was great! My husband is not a big soup fan, but he ate 3 bowls. I used chicken breasts instead of whole chicken and it turned out nicely.

This was a good start to what could be an AWSOME recipe!!  The changes I made are as follows.  1.) Used 3 chicken breast, skin on, bone in.  I roasted these in the oven at 375 for 45 minutes then separated meat. 2.) Doubled the veggie amount and added 4 chopped cloves of garlic and a package of fresh mini portabella's . 3.)  Used real chicken broth instead of water. 4.) Added a pinch of thyme and 3 bay leaves with the veggies and also added the wine at that time. 5.) Used one package of Lipton Chicken rice and one package of Uncle Ben’s quick herb and butter(it's what I had on hand).  Made these as directed, but I decreased the water by a ½ cup and did not cook completely. 6.) Only used 5 cups of milk. 7.) Used butter instead of Margarine. After I made these changes, I would give this recipe 5 stars!!!  My husband loved it and said it tasted like it came from a restaurant!!

This recipe was a great start to what I was looking for. I made it exactly as directed, minus one of the cups of water. After tasting it like others, it was good but needed something more. I added a bay leaf and chopped garlic (about a tablespoon!). I agree that if you have patience, the white sauce will thicken quite a bit. I added it to the soup slowly and at this point, it is a thinner cream soup. I cooked it down for another hour and it got nice and thick. I also added some Marsala wine for one last kick. So my version is Cream of Chicken Marsala with Wild Rice!

This was absolutely delicious! I made it easy on myself and bought a rotesserie chicken & used that microwavable wild rice (didn't cook it, just popped it in the pot).  It turned out great, I will definitely make it again!

This is a great soup! I did read some of the reviews stating their soup did not come out thick enough. I did not have that problem, but perhaps that is because we LOVE rice and add a touch more. This probably helps thicken it up. If that's not an option, maybe some light cream, as opposed to milk? That has worked for me with other cream soups that were too runny.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

This recipe was great!  I absolutely loved it and have made it many, many times.  It's a bit time consuming but completely worth it.  Last time I made it I put the chicken breasts in the crock pot with a little bit of water on high for four hours and it was perfect.  It fell off the bone.  A great trick for cooking chicken breasts.

This was an excellent recipe!  I had been looking for one that was similar to the soup at panera bread.  This is even better.  I made it with chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken and left out the white wine.  It was delicious!

This is a GREAT soup recipe!  Believe it or not the key is using very good wild rice; I got mine from a small town in Northern Minnesota called Bemidji.  I substituted A good chicken base for the Bouillon as I believe it gave more flavor.  It added so much texture and flavor the second time I made this recipe I will always use it to make this soup.  Instead of milk I used a 50/50 split of Whole Milk and Heavy Whipping Cream.  I found that this makes for a much richer soup.  Be careful, as this does thicken the listed recipe quite a bit, but that is easily controlled by adding a little of the reserved stock to the cream base while it is warming.  I have made this soup half a dozen times since I first found this recipe last winter and it never fails to please.  This is an outstanding fall/winter soup that compliments any meal rather nicely.

My husband and I eat soup year round. This has become our number one choice. The only "problem" is we can't stop at just one or even two bowls. Every time we make it we take some to a friend or two and everyone one of them begs for the recipe. Our only change was to use 2 packages of Mahatma wild rice (and spices included) because we were unable to buy plain wild rice, and we add more mushrooms. We omitted the salt as it wasn't needed. Thanks so much for sharing your recipe.

My husband and I loved this soup.  I tweaked the recipe and made it in a slow cooker.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and sauted the veggies (added carrots for color) in garlic with fresh herbs from my garden.  The rice was increased to 21/2 cups for a heartier soup and I substituted the water with chicken broth (3 extra cups were needed for the slow cooker).  Will make this one again....

Fabulous after the holiday soup. Great turkey leftover soup.  I used the leftovers from the turkey carcass, made a turkey stock, used up my left over extra whipping cream from Thanks giving, used about 1.5-2x the mushrooms, slightly more wine, and a little more flour.  The "blandness" referred to in some reviews greatly improved with the addition of salt (and maybe a little pepper.  Thanks everyone for the great suggestions. I used all including garlic, bay leaf, butter, and depending on the time, Thyme, Tarragon, Rosemary, poultry seasoning and lots of pepper.

I wanted to just serve two people with this recipe, but didn't think I'd mind leftovers, so scaled it to six servings. It was so good I wished I'd made a whole batch! I'm now taking this to a family gathering on Christmas Eve and expect rave reviews.

This was fantastic.  I added a hint a rosemary on the second day (yes, we ate it two nights) and it was delicious also.  Very Thick.  I made pasta for my girls and spooned some over the top.

I will make this again.  Thanks Thomas!

What a great soup!  I make soups all the time and am always looking for more recipes.  This will be on the top of my list.  A little long to prepare but worth the effort.  My husband takes soup to work everyday and he loves this one.                                      Lorraine

Delicate flavor. I made it with leftover chicken and pre-made broth, and it came out delicious.

This was very good...I only made a couple minor alterations: I used dry sherry to deglaze the pan instead of the white wine, and had some leftover carrots to use up so I sliced them up and added them with the celery & onion sautéed at the beginning.

Everybody loved it! The only things I changed were; butter instead of oil, added garlic, used portobello mushrooms, no celery.It is very labor-intensive, so make sure you have enough time or, like I did, do your broth and chicken ahead of time.

Very bland! I ended up using a lot more soup base. Carrots would have been a nice flavor addition. Used butter instead of margarine. Seems silly to use fake butter after going to the trouble of making stock. The fat/flour ratio was wrong and should have been equal amounts. The flour made the dish gummy and should have had heavy cream instead of milk and flour. All in all needs way too much tweaking to bother with again.

I grilled my chicken breasts after marinating them in balsamic dressing on my George Foreman grill.  All drippings were added.  I decreased the amount of water to about 2-3 cups and added carrot, fresh parsley and doubled the mushrooms (portabellos).  I used real wild rice and the color is much more of a burgundy than the picture on the recipe.  I used a Reisling based on other comments, lightened and brightened it right up.  I'm the Soup Nazi and this one made in the recipe box.

This is one of the best soups I have ever made.  I made the recipe as stated except I added some chopped carrots in with the celery and onions for my toddler grandson.  (I like to make sure he gets lots of veggies.)  The whole family loved it, which is quite rare.

This is one of the best soups I have ever had. I get rave reviews every time I make it. 

I add a whole cup of wine instead of 3/4- just cause I like a little more wine flavor- but other than that I think this recipe is totally BOMB.

YUM!  I was out of milk and wine, so I used evaported milk and beer.  I also added a little granulated garlic. The result was the best Chicken Wild Rice Soup I've ever had, and I live in MN.  I'm sure the original recipe would be almost as good. :)

I'll be eating this soup for many days, with pleasure. It's definitely a meal. But I made several changes and I'll probably make more in the future. First? Less chicken, more rice. I used four boneless chicken breast halves and one box of Near East long grain and wild rice (I'm still ambivalent about the flavor packet). Next time I will use three pieces of chicken and double the rice. There was literally so much chicken that I could hardly detect the rice at all. Second? To the initial broth I added a few dried bay leaves, one teaspoon garlic powder, some salt and pepper, four cubes of chicken bouillon, and one teaspoon onion powder. The broth was MUCH improved. Anyway, a few other changes: I didn't have wine. But instead of leaving it out altogether, I used 1/8 cup vinegar, diluted with 1/8 cup water, and mixed in one teaspoon of sugar. I tasted it beforehand and it was pretty delicious by itself, like a cider vinegar. And finally, I did use porcini mushrooms (next time with additional regular mushrooms for texture), along with a few dashes of sage and thyme. I planted a sprig of rosemary in the soup for the final fifteen minutes and the result was just delicious.

The soup turned out great, everyone loved it, I will make again.  I did make some modifications.  I used boneless skinless breasts.  I sautéed the veggies, simmered the chicken once diced, then added water & chicken bouillon.  I also added several seasonings (sage, rosemary, basil, bay leaf, garlic) to the broth. I don't measure exactly, but the thickener worked wonderfully giving it the time it needed.

this is a delicious recipe! well worth the work involved.  i've made it several times.  i use butter instead of margarine and skim milk.  i add carrots and skip the wine.  if you are using a fatty chicken, be sure to skim the fat off the chicken broth before adding anything to it - this will greatly reduce the fat seperating from the broth in the final product.

Very good soup!  I do have a few little tips...I was always taught, that when you make broth, (chicken or beef), always add celery, onion (lots of them), parsley or other herbs you like to the pot, as your broth will be much tastier!  Use the outside of the celery bunch for the broth, as the inside, more tender parts, will be nicer in the finished product.  Don't worry about the size of the "chunks" as you discard these veggies.  After the broth and meat are done, strain and discard all of these veggies and herbs.  Then continue with the remaining recipe.  Also, if you can not find regular wild rice, use a box of Uncle Bens long grain and wild rice, but omit the seasoning packet.  I made half of the soup recipe, and only used one box.  It was a great soup.  I wish we would have had bread bowls, as it was so nice and thick!  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a fantastic soup: rich, flavorful, and elegant. The wine gives it a sophistication it might not otherwise have and the whole chicken gives it the feel of a complete meal. I used 1 cup of heavy cream in place of one of the cups of milk, just because I had it on hand, but otherwise followed the recipe. Don't be afraid of the long ingredient list, people -- it's not difficult and it's very worth it!

Great recipe!  I followed it to the letter and it was really tasty.  I added some brown rice to the soup to make it a bit more filling, but that's it.  I froze the leftovers and took them to work for lunch.  I'll be making this again!

This soup was very good. The only thing that I would change is the wine. I would either sautee the vegetables in the wine or omit it from the recipe. I thought there was too strong of a wine flavor when it was done.

10/24/04 -  I normally don't care for cream soups but this one is truly excellent!  I only had enough wild rice to make 1/2 the recipe.  I used homemade chicken broth with 3 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves.  I doubled the amount of fresh mushrooms, used Wondra flour, fat free milk and did put in 2 of the carrots I had used to make my chicken broth for color.  It reheated well.  1/2 recipe only made 6 soup bowls.  Next time, I'm going to try replacing the white wine with sherry as I'm sure that would be delicious, too.
01/24/05 - I made this soup again as I did on 10/24/04 except I used turkey broth and omitted the wine.  Rather, I added a tablespoon of sherry to each bowl when serving it.  So delicious!
01/19/07 - This time I only had 1 cup wild rice so I added 1/3 cup Jasmine rice.  Ok but much better with all wild rice.  I also put it in a crockpot after step 3 for 4 hours prior to making the cream sauce.  Not a good idea.  The rice overcooked and lost its appearance.  The soup still tasted good but the presentation wasn't as nice.  Thus, the 4 stars.  (Company, however, loved the soup very much!)
01/01/12 - I'm still making this soup but now tend to use turkey rather than chicken.  My friends are still asking me to make this soup...as did my DH today.  I have stock from cooking the turkey carcass and a bit of leftover turkey to use.  Definitely add a chopped carrot or two for color...and don't forget the sherry!

This recipe is delicious! I just added a little more flour ( I like it thicker) but the taste is wonderful.

Absolutely fabulous!  After working a double shift, I came home to find my husband had made this recipe.  Even though I was exhausted, I managed to eat two bowls!  Hubby said he added a little garlic with the onions, but other than that, stuck to the recipe.  It will be a constant in our home.  Thanks so much!

It was good, but not thick enough.  I like my soup thick.  The flavor was pretty good, but was missing something.  I will probaby try this again because it has potential!

This is a delicious soup!  I cut back a little on the fat by using fat free evaporated milk and only half the butter, so it was a little thin.  Next time I'll try adding some fat free half and half.  Thanks Thomas!

The soup was really good, although I thought it could use some extra spices or flavouring, but I haven't decided which ones.  Very easy, but time consuming.  Also, I used turkey instead of chicken, because my husband doesn't eat chicken, and it still turned out well.

Substitute half-and-half for the milk.  It makes a much richer delicious sauce.

I made this for my husband on Valentines Day for a special dinner (he loves wild rice soup) and it was a hit! Everyone loved it!! I made a few changes to suit our tastes and it was still great! I minced the onion and celery instead of chopping and added 1 cup of minced carrots too. I left out the wine also. I will be making this one again!! Thank you Thomas for the recipe!!!

I loved this recipe! One of the best parts is the smell in the kitchen!! I used boneless chicken instead and it was much faster to make. I also used 2% milk instead of whole milk.

VERY GOOD!

I used light soy milk so it probably was a little more bland than regular milk. I subbed grated carrots for the celery. It was good but next time I’ll use all purpose flour like it calls for. I used whole wheat.

This soup is very good.  The only thing I did different was I didn't put the wing in.  I found the best way to serve this soup.  Make it the day before.  The flavor just explodes.  It gives the soup to blend the flavors.  Try this.  It works.

This soup is addicting! I was looking for a recipe similar to a soup I found at a fancy grocery store and this was it! When I started making it years ago I used turkey, but I'm vegetarian now so I use an assortment of mushrooms instead and it's even better! I make this multiple times a year, even during the summer it's that good. Cannot get enough!! Thank you! :-)

Great recipe! My whole family LOVED it. I added carrots with the onions and mushrooms. I also added the wine with the  veggies and sautéed them for 5 min together before I added the broth (instead of adding it at the end). I used broth I had made the week before instead of cooking it right then. I also added dried thyme and seasoned salt. Delicious!

This was very good!! I made a few changes to make it a little healthier. I used ghee and coconut oil instead of margarine, coconut flour instead of regular flour, and coconut milk instead of regular milk. This had such a good flavor and tasted so fresh.

Wonderful soup.  I did make changes sauted vegetables in butter and added minced garlic. I  made roux with flour and mixed the vegetables and flour, then I slowly added broth til thickened.  I added the chicken and rice, then added milk with bit of heavy cream, added spices and bay leaf and simmered.  I did  not have any wine, but will try next time.  I did use boxed long grain and wild rice and cooked as directed and used packet for extra flavour.

I changed this from 5 to 3 stars because the next time I made it I realized how bland I found it before I added the extras. We loved this soup with the additions and I thought it was easy to make since I used the food processor for all the chopping. Instead of water,  I used chicken broth and chicken I had previously made and had in the freezer. I sauted onions, garlic, and mushrooms in some butter and then I dumped it all in a crockpot. I added more salt and some fresh,  minced basil.  I also added over a cup of minced carrots just because I try to get as many vegetables in my kids as possible, also 3 cloves of garlic..  I did not use the wine.  It made a lot but that's good because it will be eaten up quickly.

Excellent!  As is.  Added coconut oil although any coconut flavor would do. Substituted white rice for wild & pine nuts for almonds. Milk with only 1/2 cup cream.  Delicious.

This is a fantastic soup. I usually make it with diced chicken breast meat and adding 2-3 cups chicken stock instead of the water.

Thanks to all for the suggested substitutions. I followed the recipe except I used the suggested  porcini mushrooms, bay leaves and Uncle Bens w/seasoning pack. My substitutions included making the broth from backs and wings that I keep in a freezer bag. Simmered about 2 hours w/onions, celery, bay leaf. Drain, discard the meat and bones. I then cut up a honey rotisserie chicken purchased from the market and added (great flavor!). I partially cooked the rice w/ seasoning packet then added to broth. I did not use milk in my roux. I instead used the water from the reconstitute dried mushrooms and extra chicken broth. Tastes wonderful the next day. Rich, creamy and thick.

Excellent soup, but made vegetarian by using l bag Morningstar Farms chicken stips, chopped to 1/2 inch pieces.  Added 4 cloves garlic-minced, 1 large carrot-finely chopped and 2 small potatos, peeled and cubed into 1 inch cubes, added fresh flat-leaf parsley, about 3T. I also used 32 oz 'no-chicken broth' (a vegetarian chicken flavored broth) and 3 cups water along with 2 cubes vegetable broth bouillon (instead of the 7 cups water suggested). Increased salt a bit and used coarsely ground black pepper instead of the white pepper, which I didn't have.  Turned out absolutly excellent! Served with hot garlic bread and slices of soft white cheese.

Fantastic flavor, but could use more liquid.  It was great the first day, but the second day, it had little to no liquid.  However, I added some water to the leftovers, heated on med. heat, and stirred and it turned out just as great as the first day.

This recipe is wonderful! My husband rarely tells me how much he likes my cooking, and he is not a big soup eater, but he loved this (with changes). I had to use what I had on hand. I had a quart sized ziploc of the chicken I had deboned from a rotisserie chicken I bought at the store. I like to find quick recipes to use with the leftover rotisserie chicken which is already cooked and seasoned and yummy, so I always buy a big chicken and debone it that night after dinner. I had instant white rice, and no wine and it was still great. So I made my soup very quickly, less than an hour. I did not measure anything. I sauted celery, onions and carrots all cut into small pieces. Added fresh sliced mushrooms and quickly after added probably upwards of 7 cups of boiling water with dissolved chicken bouillon  cubes and then I added the chicken in small pieces. I cooked the rice with a cube of chicken bouillon. I was in a hurry, so I made a smaller amount of the flour/milk/butter thickening stuff, and added a can of fat free cream of chicken soup. I had maybe 2 cups of that when I was done. I added the rice to the soup, had everything stirred up, and then added the cream of chicken soup mixture, let it simmer for 10-15 mins or so and served. The only thing was mine was fairly salty, fine by itself but when I added any salty crackers it was too much. I would not be surprised at all if I had this in a restaurant and I would think it tasted homemade and delicious. Like I said, my hubby lov

Loved the flavor.  I shredded 6 chicken breasts, accidentally dumped the water it cooked in..so I added extra bullion and new water.  I also added Cream of Sherry, some red pepper flakes and I think I will double the rice next time.  Over all, LOVED it.  Will make this one again!

Very bland...needs a lot of seasoning up. I added garlic salt (would have sauteed garlic with vegetables if I knew it would have needed them), ground sage, rosemary, and thyme. It is a decent starter recipe.

My husband and I loved this. We made it with the San Francisco Sourdough Bread on this site. Its creamy and hearty. We did mince some carrot to give it some color but other then that followed the recipe exactly. We will be making again. My husband wants to take it to a potluck in a couple weeks at his work.

This soup is an after Thanksgiving tradition for my family. It has replaced Chook!

We also add in Rotisserie chicken from the store.

We leave out the white wine; I think it kills the flavor.

Awesome soup!!!  Time consuming - yes, but so well worth it.  I sauted the veggies in butter and added a cup of diced carrots and 2 cups of fresh mushrooms.  A few reviewers commented that it takes long to thicken the roux.  It does, but continue whisking and you will end up with a nice thick roux to add to the soup.

This was fabulous.  I have been wanting to make this for a while but just haven't been able to.  I finally get the chance and it was fabulous!  Didn't really change the recipe up much like I normally do.  Kept to the original very closely.  The only thing that I did was add chicken base instead of the boullion only because that's what I had.  It was great!  Thanks for a great recipe!  Oh, i did think it was a little thick the next day so we added some more milk and a bit of water to it...absolutely perfect the next day!

This is fantastic!  My families FAV.  I did change the recipe a bit too, I followed the advice of FOODSLAVE, but used regular mushrooms and have also used baby portabello mushrooms, YUM.  Will try porcini next time.  Also, i made this recipe with leftover turkey from the holidays, will have to try with chicken.  Great with leftover turkey! Thanks for the basis of a FANTASTIC recipe!

This is a great recipe.  I have made it several times.  This last time I took the advice of making it with a rotiserie chicken.  It added to the flavor and cut down on time.  Great idea.  My one problem is that I am impatient with the roux and the soup is often not thick enough.

Definitely FIVE STARS!!!  I loved this!  I didn't have wild rice so I used a box of Uncle Bens Wild Rice Blend w/ seasoning pk. plus 1 cup of brown rice.  PERFECT!  I also sliced & steamed some carrots in the microwave to throw in.  I wanted it herb-y so I added some garlic, sage, basil and rosemary.  I'll be making it often.  Thanks for the recipe, it was just what I had in mind!

This soup was great!  Awesome flavor and better than most restaurant recipes.  I did add some garlic mentioned by other reviews and omitted the mushrooms because my husband does not like them but other than that followed the recipe to a T.  Definitely a keeper.

Wow...I took a risk serving this to my parents who hate alcohol in anything and in fact, like things quite bland and plain.  They loved it and had seconds!  It is very flavorful and filling.  It was just right on a frigid day served with crusty bread.  Thanks.

I agree that the soup was a little bland and added extra garlic.  I put the vegetables in a food process or and minced them up pretty small.  I also added carrots and used Portabelle mushrooms.  I served it to company and they all raved about the recipe.  I will cook it again as it served all 8 of us a hardy meal.

This would be a five star soup if the amount of bouillion was doubles, otherwise, the soup was kind of bland.  The correction had all my 7 kids saying "YUM!"  Thanks for the recipe, and I will fix it again.  BTW, we used portabella mushrooms for richer flavor.

Great!  My husband loves this.  It tasted very close to a soup that I once had in a restaurant.  I did add about 1/4 cup flour at the end to thicken it.

This is excellent!  Reminded me of a wild rice soup they serve at a local restaurant.  I added a little less chicken bouillon granules.  We will definitely make it again!

I think that this soup is great!  The changes I made are that I roasted my chicken, used a can of evaporated milk, and I used a box of wild rice mix because I could not find plain wild rice.  I used everything in the box.  I would like to try the recipe again with the wild rice.  I would still cook my chicken the same way instead of boil it.  Thanks so much for the recipe Thomas.  I loved it!

I cannot give a high rating to a soup that you have to dr. up so much.  This had zero flavor until I fixed it up with chicken soup base and garlic.  I also had to thicken up quite a bit.  Not sure what everyone thought was so great about this.

Like other reviewers have noticed, this soup does not come out thick enough as written. It's a milky consistancy. I had to thicken it up on my own. I pureed some of the veggies and I let it reduce quite a bit. Like another reviewer, i used the dried porcini mushrooms which without, this soup would not had flavor. I will make this soup again with my modifications.

Flavor was OK.  I had difficulty stirring the flour into the butter.  Usually the ratio is more around 1:1.  I pulled some of the flour out, and then added more later by blending some of the soup into some flour and adding back to the pot.  The soup also separated and was watery on top after regrigeration, so maybe I did something wrong.  I probably won't make again, as I was looking for a creamier, thicker soup.

This was really good!! Instead of a whole chicken I used chicken cutlets. I cubed the chicken put it in a pot with butter, salt & pepper and cooked it. Then I added 3 cans of chicken broth replacing the stock that the whole chicken would have cooked in. I also used regular rice instead of the wild. It came out perfect. My family really loved it. My son said "this is incredible".

Wow!! I made this last night.  It was so good that my boyfriend gobbled down 3 huge bowls.  I added carrots, the celery and the onion to the chicken while it was boiling.  I used chicken tenders cut up into chunks before boiling. I used 5 cups water and 2 cups chicken broth.  I also added about 1/4 tsp of sage, thyme, and rosemary to the boiling chicken.

Thank you for the recipe, Thomas.  This soup in filling and tastes wonderful!  I used two cups of milk and two cups of half & half in place of the four cups of milk, and cut the wine in half.  Definitely a five star recipe!

Yummy! This soup tasted so good! Like the others, I used chicken broth instead of water... I used half the amount of oil, and 1/3 of the wine to saute the veggies in. I also used breats instead of a whole chicken.

This recipe was great but it makes a lot (for two adults and two kids)!!!  Cut in half for a smaller group.

This is a cold weather favorite.  Hearty meal soup.  I left out the mushrooms and added carrots.

Another winning recipe, we love soup during the winter time, I love the fact that I use an entire chicken for this soup and make the broth from scratch, haven't changed a thing

I'm not sure what the hype is all about on this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly, but it turned out kind of bland. I then added some basil, thyme, and garlic, which gave it more flavor, but I still just wasn't impressed. My husband loved it, but he's a rice finatic. For those who don't care to eat rice soup, look for another recipe.

This is an excellent soup recipe.   I love soup and this is one of the best I've tasted.  I've shared the recipe with several friends and they totally agree.  The only changes I made were using frozen chicken tenders instead of cooking a whole chicken, using olive oil instead of vegetable oil and substituting butter for the margarine.  It does make quite a bit of soup and, since cream soups don't freeze well, I might suggest cutting the recipe in half for small families.  If you try this soup, you'll be glad you did.

This was sooooo good! I did make a few changes according to other reviewers suggestions and it turned out great. I used split chicken breast instead of a whole chicken and I used chicken broth instead of water and chicken boullion. Last I used two cups of milk and 2 cups of half and half. My whole family loved it. This will definitely stay in my recipe box. Thanks

This was a great recipe! I have never made any type of soup before, and while it was time-consuming, it was WELL WORTH IT! I did buy a roasted chicken, which was easier.  I cooked the wild rice in half water/half chicken broth.  When it came to making the cream base, I used 2 C. Skim Milk and 2 C. fat free half and half.  Also, threw in a little garlic, and carrots for color.
The wine could perhaps be lessened, it was overpowering in the end, but definitely needed to give it that yummy-give-me-more taste! I used Yellowtail chardonnay, which worked perfect! 
Only had one bowl left to freeze, which I can't wait to take out on a 30 below MN day!

This soup is delicous! It does take some time to make, but is worth all the effort. I substituted "plain" soymilk in the place of real milk and instead of wine added a small amount of balsamic vinegar. Maybe 1/4 cup?  The end results were awesome!

Absolutely fantastic!! I used a 6 lb chicken instead, and use half of the meat in the soup, and will probably make chicken salad with the other half. I also used black pepper instead of white. Be sure to give youself plenty of time to prepare this soup...but the time spent is well worth it!! My girlfriend and my roommate helped devour most of it!!

Went looking for a cream of turkey soup recipe and found this one.  I just substituted leftover turkey from Thanksgiving for the chicken. Simmered the turkey bones; legs, thighs, breast for 45 min in chicken stock (instead of water and bouillion) and followed the recipe.  Other substitutions were butter for margerine and half and half for milk.  The result was fantastic. This was a great way to use up leftover turkey.  Everyone loved it, we'll be making it again and again.  Thanks and enjoy!

This was incredible.  My husband and I loved it, my mom loved it, and we're making it again for a holiday dinner we're hosting.  The only thing we did differently was half heavy cream and half milk.  Otherwise, this was amazing, and it got better each day until it was gone.

This is delicious!  Used 1 1/2 lbs. of boneless chicken breast and used chicken broth instead of water.  As always, tastes better the next day...if there is any left.

I just made this soup for lunch today, and YUM!  It's great!  A bit time consuming, but worth it!  I added real mushrooms, and no celery since I didn't have any on hand.  Instead of the butter/flour mixture, I used 1/3 cup cornstarch to thicken the soup, along with the milk required by the recipe. Everyone loved it, including my 2 year old.  Thanks for a great recipe.  Will freeze the leftovers and definetely make it again!

An overall VERY good recipe.  I used wheat flour and brown rice for a low glycemic meal.  Turned out well.  I added some fresh garlic to it and increased pepper.   What can I say?  I like it hot!
