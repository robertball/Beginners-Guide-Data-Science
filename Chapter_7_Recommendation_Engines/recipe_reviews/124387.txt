This was not bad, but not the best roasted potato recipe. I may increase the amt. of the rosemary and thyme next time. Two crucial steps left out of the instructions:
      1. Even with the oil, spray a thin coat of Pam on your baking sheet to help prevent sticking.
      2. You MUST periodically flip these over while cooking. They brown very fast and you want to ensure crispiness all the way around.

These were very good!! The only change I made was that I omitted the thyme, so I just used olive oil, rosemary, garlic, salt, and cayenne pepper. I tossed them every 10 mins or so to make sure they didn't burn, then when they were done I broiled them for about 2 mins to make the edges crispy. Turned out delicious!!

These potatoes were delicious!  My whole family loved them, including my daughter, age 4, and son, age 2.  Even after we were all stuffed, my husband gobbled the last few up.  My daughter said, "Um, can we have these every night?"  I never imagined that the kids would have more of the side dish then the main course!  Oh, I did shake the pan after every ten minutes, so they browned evenly and didn't burn.  I only used one big clove of garlic.

Excellent recipe! So simple and so good. I will be making these again for sure. I used garlic powder in place of cloves and it was great.

This is a really great side dish. I doubled the amount of thyme, rosemary, and salt. Also used garlic powder instead of minced because I was in a hurry. Once on the pan, I sprinkled some paprika on top for color. MAKE SURE you turn these every 5-10 minutes when cooking or the bottoms will be charcoal! With the changes, this a 5 star recipe. *Update* I made this again and threw in an extra large onion, sliced thick. They caramelized in the oven and it was sooo good!

I made these as written but used fresh rosemary and thyme and turned them occasionally for even browning.  Be careful with the cooking time - mine didn't even need 35 minutes, and you sure don't want to end up with overcooked, shriveled potatoes!  Hubs said these were the best roasted potatoes I ever made - must have been the (fresh)rosemary/thyme combo.

Great flavor, easy to make.  After I pulled from the oven I tossed with some salt and grated Parmesan.  Just watch out for those burn pieces of garlic!!!  It was perfect.  Will add to my recipe box.

Hubby pronounced these delish! I think I used more oil & cooked them in my round pampered chef stone. Didn't have the problem others did with sticking. Used my own Italian Seasoning Blend since we have to eat salt free. Thanks for the recipe it will be used often in the scotdog house!

A few things were off with this recipe and now I regret not having read busymommy's review.  It was right on.  My potatoes stuck to the pan.  I went to check on them and noticed it.  I tried to drizzle some more olive oil to the potatoes but by then it was too late.  The taste was saved because I added 1/2 tsp. of Greek seasoning too.  Otherwise I believe it would have turned out too bland.

A great basic potato recipe that is a little more exciting than just baked potatoes but won't interfere with the flavors of whatever else you are having.

These potatoes were so yummy! I made enough for 15 servings. I subbed Pampered Chef Rosemary & Herb seasoning for the rosemary/thyme. I used coarse salt & pepper. I had several recipe requests and will make this again!

This is such a simple and delicious recipe.  It goes with any type of meat.  You can experiment with the spices and use melted butter instead of olive oil.

These potatoes came out perfect! I'm not a huge fan of rosemary and thought I might not like them but it wasn't overpowering at all! Thanks for posting!

I made these for a family dinner the other day. Everyone loved them! I sprayed the pan with cooking spray. I also shake the pan every 10 minutes or so to make sure the potatoes don't stick. I've made these 4 or 5 times now and every time it comes out perfect. The most recent time I was out of thyme so I used oregano and they were still delicious.

Very good! I knew the jist of how to make roasted potatoes and was looking for a recipe that fit what I wanted to do with mine and this was perfect! I think next time we may add just a tad more olive oil, maybe another 1/2 tablespoon and a tad bit more rosemary. I love herbs and love an intense flavor. I didn't use thyme as I didn't have any on hand and they were still fantastic!

We have had these numerous times and it has become a family favorite.  Leftovers are great chopped up for home fries with breakfast the next morning.  I just add some chopped onions and butter to the pan.  Yum.

Easy to make, good basic recipe.  I just threw everything into the 9"x13" pan and mixed the oil and spices into the potatoes with my hands, instead of wasting a storage bag.  Kids ate them happily, even though they had visible herbs on them, lol.

I took Busymommy and Brayden's Mommy's and combined their suggestions. Added more rosemary, thyme and replaced pepper for cayenne. Wonderful meal! I also put the same seasoning on thin pork chops and threw them in the oven at the same time. This is definitely a keeper receipe.

These were a hit.  Even my father-in-law liked them, and he's a super picky eater.  I made them exactly according to the recipe, and stirred them every 10 minutes.  Turned out perfectly.  I'll definitely make these again.

Thanks to those before me who mentioned oiling the pan and turning the potatoes.  This was tasty, but I made a few changes after tasting the marinade...  Added some balsamic and extra spices.  Also did what another reviewer did and cooked a cut up onion with the potatoes... used a Vidalia.  The marinade was a little bland without these changes, in my opinion... we like more intensity of spices in our potatoes.  With my changes will definitely make again.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I substituted Italian seasoning for the other herbs and drizzled the potatoes with olive oil and salt and pepper. Then I "jump started" them in the microwave on the potato setting. I put them in the oven for the last 1/2 hour of my chicken cooking and blasted them with the broiler for a quick browning on the top. These potatoes were crisp on the outside and nice and soft in the middle. Delicious! Received rave reviews from everyone! I served these with a roast chicken and it was delightful.

Mmmm...delicious! I needed a way to use up a bag of those cute little fingerling potatoes (which I left whole). If you use fingerlings, cut the roasting time to 20-25 minutes. Extra-virgin olive oil gives better flavor than veg. oil, and I recommend kosher salt (1 tsp) if you have it on hand. Here's the surprise: I found that the potatoes actually tasted better after resting awhile. I was nibbling on them as I did dishes, and they were SO much more flavorful than hot from the oven. They were still warm after 20-30 minutes (I had dumped them into a ceramic serving bowl). Meanwhile, the flavors of the garlic and herbs had developed more. Thanks for a simple, yummy side dish.

Great basic recipe, easy savory side dish.  I used 3-4 Tablespoons of butter, melted, instead of the oil-- it was awesome.  I don't really get this line in the recipe though-- "Remove from the oven and cover with foil to keep warm while broiling the fish."  Can we serve this dish without fish??  :)

these were delicious! I didn't have any thyme on hand so i just used Garlic Plus instead, I also sliced up some onion and put it in as well, I prepped it about an hour or so before we started to cook it so the flavors could marinate a bit into the potatoes and we wrapped them in tinfoil and did them on the bbq it was absolutely delicious and a big hit with the family I will definitly be making these again!! :)

I did think these were a little plain despite the description. It seemed to lack some flavor. They are good roasted potatoes just not 5-star worthy.

I thought this was a great recipe! I omitted the thyme because I didn't have any and used 1/4 tsp garlic powder instead of fresh garlic. The flavor was just right. Highly recommended!

Excellent Recipe! This is so simple and delicious, I only made two small changes because I love garlic.

1) I substituted 1/2 tbsp olive oil with Garlic infused olive oil from Whole Foods Bulk section.
2) I tripled the amount of diced garlic.

Recipe +1+2= Yummy

Quality recipe base, but recommend doubling oil, garlic and seasonings.  In terms of spices, it seems to be lacking something.

Very nice, and so easy!  I used fresh rosemary and thyme since I had it, and I used a mix of small red fingerling potatoes and blue potatoes.  I added more garlic--I always do--and just eyeballed ingredients.  This is a pretty quick and good potato recipe.  I really like roasted potatoes, and this one was a good recipe for them.  Thanks for the recipe.

I love this recipe. I used fresh rosemary instead of dried and ground sea salt and it turned out so flavorful and fantastic. It's fast too, all you have to do is mix all the ingredients together and stick it in the oven. I will definitely make it again!

These are wonderful!!  After following the recipe I have changed it up by using all different spices and potatoes.  I have also made these on the grill in a foil pack while grilling the rest of my meal.   Put in tin foil pack and place on top rack, cook for about 20 minutes.

Really good. I didn't have any garlic, so I used garlic powder, and also threw in a little minced onion. Came out perfectly, will make again.

A wonderful recipe.  I used garlic powder instead of minced garlic so it would coat the potatoes better.  I was baking chicken at 350 degrees, so to accomodate that, I cooked the potatoes at 350 as well.  I covered them and cooked for about 40 minutes, then uncovered them and cooked for another 20 minutes.  The turned out wonderfully tender and not too brown!

Decent recipe. I like the spices and the taste of them but they weren't even NEAR moist enough. I would suggest added some melted butter over them about half way through.

Excellent flavor and very easy.  I didn't change anything.  I did turn the potatoes once during roasting to keep from sticking. I also sprayed the pan with Pam.

This recipe is quick, tasty and adds a new flavor to anything roasted.  I made them with a roasted hen and it's such a change from the normal mashed potatoes or baked potatoes.  They're so aromatic when they're baking, it's wonderful.  Such a fancy dish and takes up so little time.

perfect!  listened to others reviews and sprayed pam on the pan 1st.  also used fresh thyme and rosemary from the garden.  sprinked with garlic salt - cause i didn't want burnt garlic peices. Served as a side to the Chicken Cordon-Bleu ll from this site!  delish!

hmmmm...just a little boring. Didn't do much for me. I think I prefer new potatoes in more of a buttery herb glaze.

Hm... my potatoes turned out pretty dry.  Perhaps I just overbaked.  Anyways, they were very good, but nothing spectacular.  I'll give them another try.  Watch out for burnt garlic.

Very good recipe  - gave me a chance to use some fresh herbs from my garden. I added fresh parsley because I have a ton...broiled them for the last 2 minutes to make them extra crispy on the outside.

Sooo good!  I added 1 tsp of lemon juice to the marinade. The only other thing that I added was some parmesan once they came out the oven.  I also let the potatos marinate over night... which gave them a lot of flavor!

This is a really good and easy side dish.  I made this with my mom today for Sunday dinner.  We followed the recipe pretty much exactly.  Served with barbecued beef, garlic bread, corn and steamed broccoli.  The cooking time is right on!

I scaled this down to serve two.  Microwaved the potatoes for 5 minutes, before putting in the oven, to ensure they finished at the same time as the rest of dinner!  Worked well as the oven time was spent really roasting them to that lovely browned-edge quality that is so good!  Thanks for the recipe, Ann!

OMG... these were delicious!I added a bit of garlic powder and seasoned salt. I would suggest greasing the baking dish, as they were somewhat stuck to the bottom. Will make these again, often. Thanks, Ann.

I usually make this with whatever potatoes I have in the pantry cut smallish and tend to go a bit rogue with the spices and use whatever sounds good. I'm always happy with it!

I found that the closer you place your potatoes together the less crispy they will become. For added flavor I included 1 med onion, minced and 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper.  You can also change your oil to Peanut oil for added interest.  This is one of my all time favorites!

I used red potatoes because that was all I had. I served these with Cheeseburger Salad, which is also from this site and my Steam-Out-Your-Ears Hamburger/Fry Sauce. The boys are them all. Next time, I might add onion powder.

The other night I had talapia and some broccoli, and a neighbor had given me some fresh dug new potatoes. I followed this recipe exactly and my family LOVED it!  In fact, we're having them with pork chops tonight--special request from hubby. Yummy!

Great, easy way to make potatoes.  I thought it was a little heavy on the thyme, so next time I will half.  Overall-fantastic.  They also present very well.

These are really good. I did add balsalmic vinager to them after I took them out of the oven.  I think that they could have used a little bit more moisture during the roasting time however, maybe take out half way through and just drizzle a little more olive oil over them and toss.  Or I could have drizzled the balsalmic over them half way through cooking as well.

Love this recipe! I did omit the thyme because my husband doesn't like it. The minced garlic burns quick, so next time I'll try garlic powder.

Terrific with my new red potatoes, right out of the ground.  Used fresh herbs (thyme & rosemary) and uncured garlic (plucked from the garden). Very fine early harvest dish.

This recipe turned out very tasty, but 425 was too high for my oven and the potatoes burned.  Next time, I will keep it at 400 degrees.  But, regardless of a littel charring, they still tasted very good.  I really liked the rosemary.  We will make this again!

these were very good and had a great flavor, but i would shake the pan every 10 min or so because if you put them in the oven and forget about them they brown alittle to much on the side tuching the pan...

A quick and easy recipe that is full of flavor. I used butter instead of oil and they still came out great. They were so good infact my husband wanted to know how to make them just in case he wanted them and I wasn't around. And this is a guy that rarely cooks anything.

These were great, except VERY SALTY.  I would cut out the salt totally.  Also, I cooked them at 450 for only 10 minutes or so b/c the garlic was starting to get too brown, so I dropped it to 400 for the last 35 minutes.

I'm giving four stars b/c I followed the recipe to a T, but it needed to be stirred at least once during cooking, b/c mine stuck to the pan - not a very nice presentation.  But I will say that 35 minutes at 450 was perfect, tender and crispy (despite some being mushed b/c the were stuck so bad).  Overall great recipe, will keep, my husband loved them.

These were amazing!!!  I will absolutely be making them again.  We had them with steaks made with my favorite red wine sauce and fresh baked white mountain bread.

This is really really good - I will definetly make it again - I did add a little more spice than what the recipe calls for - but I like everything with intense flavor - even my picky husband liked it.

These were incredibly, unbelievably easy to make and tasted soooo delicious.  I used mini red potatoes as well, and they were just as savoury.  Will definitely use this over and over again.  So time saving and simple.  Love it!!

Quite nice-served them with the Burgundy Pork Tenderloin and some vegetables-they were plain and simple but nice alongside a full-bodied dish like the Burgundy Pork.
Next time I would have added real butter instead of oil and I used garlic powder instead of minced garlic.

I will make these again!

I love this recipe because it's sooo easy. If I know I have a long day then I prepare it the night before and stick them in the fridge. 

I grate some cheese on them sometimes.

Not bad,  I just thinkg you can throw pretty much any herb from your pantry on potatoes and they will taste good.

I have made this twice now.  My first batch did not turn out well at all.  I have no idea what I did wrong, my second batch turned out much better.  It was good, but not something I would crave.

This is simple, yet yields wonderful results. I tried it with purple potatoes (got them at Sprouts), and they lend a touch of sweetness to the end result. They are just too cute, too! If using the purples, I would check for doneness ahead of schedule as mine cooked more quickly than expected. Making them again for Easter dinner as I think the purple color would lend a festive touch to the table!

These were really tasty! I had a 4 lb bag of assorted fingerling potatoes from Costco....they are SO cute! So I used half a bag & cut up some of the larger ones. Added 1/3 more of all the other ingredients to make up for the extra half lb of potatoes. Perfect cook time & temp. Yummy & easy- thanks!

made these potatoes along with the pan fried steak.  The rosemary in both recipes complimented each other.  Easy and will make again.

These were really easy to make and turned out delicious both times I tried them. They make a good side dish without being overpowering (I had thought the rosemary might be too strong for the potatoes). I find the oil a bit too much and the salt slightly low (I used measuring spoons). I only used 1.25 Tbsp Olive oil the second time and it was enough.

The ease, time and taste make this dish a keeper.

My entire family (10 of us) loved these potatoes.  I just cut up red potatoes because that is what I had on hand and they were delicious.  Thanks so much for this delicious but simple side dish. We will definitely use this at least once a week.

This is such an easy sidedish to throw together. End result makes it seemlike it takes more effort than it really did. Has such a wonderful flavor when cooked.
