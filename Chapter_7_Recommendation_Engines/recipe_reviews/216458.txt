Let's start by saying this was a very interesting recipe.  I could not wait to try this, I love jerk chicken.  My finished dish was excellent, but with some serious tweaks.  I omited the sage and oregano, cut the allspice to 1/2 teaspoon, and only added juice of one lime, glad I did, more on that later.  I simmered the chicken, broth, and spices a total of 2 1/2 hrs to meld the flavors.  Tasted, and way too acidic/sour.  At that point I added three cans navy beans, and two heaping tablespoons of brown sugar to counter act the sour and add a touch of sweetness.  Worked like a charm.  Then I simmered over an hour to get this from soup to chili consistency.  The result was very tasty.  I enjoyed trying this, thanks for your submission.

Made this a couple days ago, better the 2nd day. Too many different spices/flavors!! Oregano and sage are not really "jerk" spices; therefore eliminated them and added red pepper flakes and hot sauce to make it spicier. Also added green peppers.  I will make it again making more spice adjustments.

Good, but little tweaks had to be made and it could have used more. For one, it turned out much soupier than I had hoped. When I went to taste it just before serving, it was so spicy my eyes started watering before the spoon even hit my lips. I added a good amount of brown sugar, which cut the spicy a little and added an interesting sweetness to it, but my lips still tingled after eating it.

My husband and I thought this recipe was delicious!  The only thing I did differently was cooked the chicken first and shredded it and left out the lime juice.  I also added some chopped green pepper.  The blend of spices worked wonderfully.  Mine actually cooked up pretty thick in the 45 min so I added about 8oz of water with the beans.  It still had a wonderful flavor!  Great recipe!
