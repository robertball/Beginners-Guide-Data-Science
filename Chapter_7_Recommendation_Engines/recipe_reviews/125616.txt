I made these for our Annual Family Memorial Day FIsh Fry. NO ONE KNEW; That they were eating deer meat. Everyone begged me for the recipe. The kids were my biggest testimony. Thank you so much! I made 70 kabobs they were gone within the hour. The only thing that I had changed was the tomato. I used crushed instead of puree.

I only had 1 tbsp of liguid smoke left in my bottle but it still turned out good.  Next time, I'll use the full two tbsp.  I also had no tomato puree or sauce but I found a can of tomato juice, so I use that.  Also used cider vinegar on account I had no rice vinegar.   I'll definately make it again.  It was very good with the changes and depending on what is in the cupboards, I'll probably follow the recipe more.

Excellent flavor.  And I, too, was using a venison hind quarter.  I did skewers of meat only -- I always find it's better to cook the vegetables separately.  People liked this a lot.

I've made this a couple times now with great results from different venison roasts. The flavor combinations are a great blend of spicy, sweet and smoky. Even my mother who normally refuses to eat venison admitted she really liked this meal! My prep time is slightly longer than listed here but if you do the marinade the night before and then spend 15-30 minutes skewering the kabobs before grilling, it's a quick 15-minutes on the grill (rotating once midway through).

I made this with black tail tenderloins. Amazing! Just the right amount of kick and not too sweet. I'll probably use the marinade for steaks in the future.
