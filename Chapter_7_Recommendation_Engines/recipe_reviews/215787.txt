I thought I had grilled everything that could be grilled until I saw this recipe.  Grilled meatloaf?  I made half the recipe for the two of us, but used one whole egg, essentially doubling the amount called for.  It was a good idea because had I not done this it might have been a tad dry. For the same reason, I cut back on the amount of bread crumbs by about one-fourth. I’m not a fan of tarragon, so I didn’t use it.  I used Penzey’s Chicago Seasoning, probably a good teaspoon for a pound and a half of meat, a mix of ground beef, pork and veal.  I found the mix a little dry so I added some of the barbecue sauce/ketchup mixture to the meat mixture – good call, it was excellent!   I also added finely chopped celery and green pepper and more Worcestershire than directed.  Not wanting the glaze to burn during cooking, I waited until about 20 minutes into the cooking time to spread it on the meatloaves ( I made two small loaves with a half recipe) and then a second time after 15 more minutes.  Slow to start cooking, the loaves came to the 160 degree temperature quickly after that.  An instant-read thermometer was very helpful.  The cooking method was not only intriguing, it also resulted in a perfectly moist and flavorful loaf, although the charcoal flavor was not as apparent as I had thought it would be.  All and all, a great meatloaf I wouldn’t hesitate to make again – even in the middle of Wisconsin winter!

I made this on my hunting trip and it was a huge hit! I didn't change a thing and everyone loved it. It made great sandwiches the next day too.

This is great.  What's wrong with making too much? We just love cold meatloaf sandwiches.  I cook it in my smoker and add a little mesquite smoke flavor to it.  Fantastic.

Unfortunately, my husband and I don't share the enthusiasm of others who have tried this recipe. We found the flavor of the herb overwhelming and, therefore, did not enjoy this meatloaf. I think we would have really liked this had we omitted the tarragon.

Grilled meatloaf is wonderful in the hot summer months. I only used ground beef and didn't have tarragon so used fresh Italian herbs from the garden instead. Of course I added more fresh garlic, I always do. Used a 15 inch aluminum cookie sheet to mold a rectangle meatloaf about an inch and half thickness. Topped with some grated Monterey Jack/Colby cheese, then topped with just 15 oz. can of tomato sauce (didn't want to use BBQ since my spices were Italian). Then topped the tomato sauce with sliced green bell peppers and fresh mushroom slices. Cooked on a charcoal covered grill over indirect heat for about 50 minutes, turning the cookie sheet half way through to make sure even cooking. The flavor of the charcoal makes a meatloaf to die for. We have actually been grilling meatloaves for a couple years now...hard to go back to regular oven meatloaf once you've had it charcoaled grilled.

Meatloaf is not one of my favorite dishes, but this recipe is amazing! By far the best my husband and I have had. One slight change. I added a splash of bourbon to the BBQ sauce. We will definitely be making this again and again!

Grilled meatloaf! Whoda thunk! My husband loves meatloaf but I only make it in the cool months, so this is a treat! I halved it and used just ground sirloin. I did not use the tarragon but added a bit of ketchup to make it moister. I only used BBQ sauce as a glaze. I will definitely make this again! Thank you

This meatloaf was good. The bottom of ours got pretty charred. I think would make again.

My husband didn't want to run the grill that long so I did do this in the oven, which may be why I did not think this meatloaf was anything special.  Not much flavor at all.

Really enjoyed the grilled flavor of this meatloaf. Cut meat amount in half, but left all else the same.  Used the top piece of a broiler pan over the grill grate to better support the meatloaf and grilled over indirect coals.

I didn't like the BBQ sauce. I would probably make it again but cover it with ketchup and brown sugar mixture instead.

I didn't use tarragon, just make my standard meatloaf recipe.  I add worcestershire or steak sauce and a squirt of mustard to the glaze as well. I did use the recipe's method of shaping and that worked out beautifully.  I used a small charcoal grill and moved the coals to the outer ring after heating up.  Put the meatloaf on heavy duty foil in center and flipped over/dumped grease halfway through.  My Dad and husband thought I was nuts when I said I was grilling meatloaf but they devoured it!

We are trying to find as many things to grill outside so we don't heat up the house cooking and I gotta tell ya - it's a great thing that we can BBQ year 'round because this is the most amazing meatloaf ever! I was told that I am not allowed to make it any other way anymore. Although I made som subtle changes to the original (sans pork and added an extra egg), the base recipe is pretty much perfect. We smoked it and it had a wonderful red rim and just a little crunch. Mmmmmmm....even leftovers were surperb. WINNER!

This is a very good meal.  Made triple recipe.  However, I changed it slightly.  Added mustard to the sauce and removed the meatloaves at 145 degree, covered them for 5 to 8 minutes and they were near 150 degrees when they were sliced.  Everyone loved the meal and meat was done perfectly and still moist.  Normally I wouldn't consider serving meatloaf as a main dinner, but this went over big.  Enjoy.

Awesome Recipe. I added brown sugar to the mix, and honey mustard, Worcestershire, and cajun seasoning to the sauce. Amazeballs.

This was a really good meatloaf. I did change the recipe a little, and I hate that because then you aren’t reviewing the original recipe. Anyway, I used 2 lbs of ground round and 1 lb of sausage because that’s what I had. I also didn’t put in the tarragon, instead I used Cajun seasoning. We cooked it on a gas grill, we heated up the whole grill then turned half of it off. It worked great! Best meatloaf ever!

Perhaps we cooked it too fast, there was great flavor, but it was very dry.  Most likely do this in the oven next time.

Obviously using the grill to cook you do not want meatloaf that is too wet but I did add 1/4 salsa to the meat mixture for added flavor. Meatloaf turned out awesome! However next time, after the first 30 minutes, I may flip it in order to get that crispy sear on all 4 sides, yummy!
