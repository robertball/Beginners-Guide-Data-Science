I really appreciate the attention to detail on cooking times of various ingredients in this recipe.  It's better not to cook the shredded carrot and apple as long as the kale, or the kale as long as your peppers.  It makes for good textures all around.

I changed the recipe a little bit.  Instead of olive oil and balsamic, I used sesame oil and apple cider vinegar.  For my taste, I cooked the kale a few minutes.  Also, after I finished cooking I sprinkled the recipe with chopped almonds.  

This recipe is ripe for experimentation with the seasoning.  I imagine ginger or turmeric would particularly accompany the garlic well.

This is an interesting, warm salad, that tames the springiness of kale, and combines it with sweet and savory flavors.  I was a bit puzzled by the name, but the many colors do sort of remind me of "cowboy caviar".  Using kale, instead of beans and corn, tames the calorie punch.  The sweetness provided by the apple and carrot are surprising additions, but with the balsamic, they work.  This recipe involves a lot of preparation, and since I had some leftover, I hope it will be good tomorrow, too.  Thanks for the idea!

I'd never tasted kale before. Fresh, I couldn't stomach it - it was so bitter. But this recipe got rid of the bite, and the medley of additional vegetables was a great compliment to the kale. This recipe is a keeper.

I made this recipe as written except I skipped the carrots, and it was delicious. Husband loved it too. It was a great complimentary vegetable side dish to fish. A good way to use kale, and a bunch of other healthy vegetables too.

I had to cook the kale longer than stated as it was a very fibrous variety. I would recommend using tender baby kale. great recipe!

We added a couple tablespoons of soy sauce. It tamed the sweetness just enough for our tastes! It was great!

Love this.  I used seasoned salt in place of salt and added a bit of garlic powder as we love garlic.  I used curly kale and cooked it covered about 6 minutes to make it more tender to eat. It was sweet but not sugary.
Thanks

Great way to cook down a lot of kale and eat it if you aren't feeling up to a big kale salad.

I love this recipe!  Needed to make a side dish and had a bunch if kale in the fridge. This is a great way to serve kale, it's delicious, and it looks pretty too. I didn't have green onions so I substituted a  white onion, sliced thinly.

Made as stated except used a Gala apple in place of Granny Smith. Very interesting with all the different tastes and textures. I like so many other Kale recipes so I don't think I'll make again.

This was way better than I expected! I added a can of Cannenilli white beans just to add a little more substance. Great side dish with fish!

Probably used a little less kale and just a drizzle of olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  It was good - will make it again.
