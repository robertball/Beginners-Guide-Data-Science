I love this recipe and have made is so many times with variations here and there. The first time I made it as is, it was still great though! But here is what I've learned. I prefer using chicken base (better than bouillon brand) over vegetable bouillon cubes as it is what I have on hand. I also use a 29 ounce can of diced tomatoes over the smaller rotel with chiles, although I sometimes add the canned chiles separately. I typically put the beans in from the beginning as I see no reason not to and they cook fine for the full time. My biggest stray from the recipe is that I never put the zucchini slices and garlic in the bottom as it just turns to weird mush. I love roasting a head of garlic and  the zucchini slices, pureeing them, and then putting them in the crock pot. However, that's a bit of extra work so I typically just mince about 6 cloves of garlic and shred the zucchini and throw that in the crockpot. It works so well and turns out great. I add a little salt and pepper to taste. Also never hurts to add a bay leaf and some other seasoning to taste. Really terrific base recipe.

It was delicious! I'll admit I was wary of the combinations here, but I love all the ingredients so I made it. Doubled the recipe which wasn't the best idea as my crock pot couldn't hold it all. Had to transfer to a stock pot the last 2 hours. Unfortunately my rice didn't cook all the way. I think I need more liquid next time and to cut my pork into smaller pieces before putting it into the pot as I had to cook in the crock pot longer to get the pork to shred (something I usually have no problem with). Not the fault of the recipe, just some observations. I may prefer boil the rice a bit next time. Even after 2 hours of slow simmer, there's a bit of a crunch to most pieces of rice. Good recipe and definitely different! Will make again. More of a jambalaya feel to it.

This turned out pretty well! I like the curry with the pork, it isn't something I pair together very often. I added 3/4 cup of whole wheat orzo pasta (instead of the rice) 10 minutes before the pot was ready to come off the stove. It turned it more stew-like, rather than a soup. I will prepare this dish again.

Was cleaning  out the pantry, and we like spicy, so added some chipotle peppers in adobo and some sweet pickled jalape√±os. Used boneless chicken thighs and added sliced black olives and corn. The base is good, and the curry is a nice touch. Mine wasn't very souplike, but super yummy. Could even be wrapped in a large tortilla.

I went heavier on the garlic and curry and everyone went back for seconds.
