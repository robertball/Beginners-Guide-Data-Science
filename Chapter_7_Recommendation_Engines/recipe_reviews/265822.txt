Made as written for tri-tip steaks and it turned out pretty good. Because they were steaks and not a roast I grilled them. I will definitely use this marinade again but will leave out the liquid smoke next time.

me and bf really enjoyed this even with marinating for only 4 hours.. our tri tip was on the smaller side so i cut the recipe in half.. i made a few modifications based on what we had on hand.. instead of merlot and brown sugar i used port.. also instead of using garlic powder and fresh garlic i used one whole head of garlic.. doubled the soy sauce but still think it needed a little more salt.. i left out the liquid smoke.. rosemary would've been a nice addition.. bf seared these on the gas grill using a cast iron griddle and then roasted on the top rack to finish off.. ty for the recipe.. will give this another go
