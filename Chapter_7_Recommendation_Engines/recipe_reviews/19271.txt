This is by far the best brownie in the world.....if you follow the recipe to the letter, you should not have any problems. Yes, they are rich, but isn't that why we eat dessert anyway?! I have made them THREE times this week for company and my husbands office.
Thanks for sharing.....this is going into my "secret recipe" file!!!
PS......33 INDIVIDUAL CARAMELS IS WHAT YOU NEED:)

I thought the comment by Rubenette was pretty harsh, "this recipe stinks!" Well, I don't know what she did wrong but this recipe is superb!!! Don't be thrown off by the bad comments because these are delicious. It states clearly that if you wait to cut them until they're cool, the mushiness is gone. I found this to be true but it's so hard to wait!!! Great recipe! Give it a whirl! :)

Absolutely delicious.  I was hesitant at first to make this recipe because of Karen's comments, but there are a few flaws with her review.  One, is that the recipe was too rich for her guests, and two, she does not remark if the recipe was too reach for HER.  Anyways, the brownies are delicious.  As far as being rich, what do people want?  I would rather bite into a brownie that sweeps me off my feet in one bite and satisfies enough to keep from eating them all at once, instead of the brownies that are your everyday run of the mill brownies that you can finish in one sitting because they have the average chocolate taste.  These brownies are superb.  Don't even listen to Karen.  If you do, then add a little vanilla icing to balance the brownie out for a delicious treat.  Don't pass this recipe up!!!

Paul, What kind of baker are you?  You take yellow cake mix to make brownies.  How dare you?  Yellow cake mix is an age old recipe to make cakes, and you abuse this mix by using it in a brownie recipe.  By the way, the Brownies were GREAT!!!!

The people who liked this recipe must know some secret that isn't included in the recipe directions.  These do not cook through in 20 minutes and end up being a mushy mess.  I could have cooked them for longer but was afraid to because the cake mix had risen so much it was about to run over the sides or the baking dish. (it later collapsed back down into uncooked mush) Also I would recommend putting the chocolate and caramel on top of all of the cake mix because it's nearly impossible to spread the second layer on top of the gooey caramel and chocolate mixture.  I just don't think cake mix was meant to make anything besides cake.  This recipe stinks.

I have been making bars similar to this for years.  I use german chocolate cake mix though.  I put mine in a 9 x 13 cake pan and only bake for 15 minutes after adding the top layer of cake batter.  It works best to drop by spoonful or flatten in palms and scatter out in pieces on top of the caramel mixture.  I always get rave reviews and  requests for them.

The 2nd time I made this I used sweetened condensed milk (1/2 cup) instead of the evaporated milk with the caramels and it was much creamier.  I also used it in the cake mix part (1/2 cup) and it made the whole dessert have a better texture.

You have to allow these to cool overnight or they will be very gummy, but after you let them cool overnight they are SO GOOD!

All I can say is WOW!  I made these for my husband to take to work, and they received rave reviews from everyone.  After baking the first layer, I added the chocolate and caramel.  It ended up mixing in with the rest of the brownie mixture, but that gave it a great swirl and texture.  It was so delicious!  We had it warmed with vanilla frozen yogurt to taste-test and it was AMAZING!!

I thought this would be terrific, after reading the reviews here, but it turned out just so-so.  It was sickeningly sweet, and the only way I could salvage it was to heat it and serve it under ice cream.  No one was particularly impressed.  Sorry, but I won't make this again.

Loved these! Awesome combo of cake and caramel with a hint of chocolate.  I made these a couple times and it doesn't matter what cake mix you use, they're all delicious. I do recommend using the white/milk combo chips, we love white chocolate but the bit of milk chocolate is delicious. 

The absolute key though is to add one egg, gives it a firmer texture but still gooey enough to be decadent.  Without the egg it is much more gooey and difficult to serve.

Not sure I would call it a brownie, but I do call it delicious!  It is very rich and very yummy.  I did have a problem with the top layer of batter not spreading very easy.  I may try what someone else said about breaking it up into little pieces to spread it around next time and yes there will be a next time!

My family loved these. We ate most of them straight from the oven with spoons and bowls, though they were also tasty eaten cool and solid as intended. I could see some people preferring a less cakey or more solid texture like traditional brownies, but I don't really understand how anyone would dislike these overall. The only prominent ingredients are yellow cake, caramel, and chocolate, and nothing magical happens to disguise those, so if someone doesn't like these things, I'd advise not trying this recipe. To me, the gooeyness is exactly what is great about these. I'm going to use even more chocolate and caramel next time.

I agree that this brownie is rich, but I made it in a 9x13 pan so it's not too thick.  Because of the larger pan, I used probably 2/3 of the cake for the bottom layer, the remainder was just swirled in with the chocolate and caramel.  Also, with the thinner brownie, the cooking time was fine.  I've been testing brownie recipes for a brownie bake-off, with my co-workers as guinea pigs.  This was many people's favorite--though I'm probably going to make a different recipe for the contest.

They were good. The only problem I had was I did not have a 8x10 dish and baked them in a 8x8 dish. It required longer baking time and even then they still seemed a bit too cakey in the middle. Other then that they were very rich and tasty!

Very rich and delicious! A little difficult to "swirl" the batter and caramel, but definately attempt to mix them! I also agree to chill so that the bars will harden, but also plan to leave them out so the caramel isn't too cold to chew.... Will make these again!

This is the best brownie ever.  I wouldn't use as much caramel next time, sort of overpowered the blondie and the chocolate...but overall I loved these!

I used a 13x9 inch baking pan and these turned out fantastic!!! My husband is constantly asking when I'm going to make "those blonde brownies" again and I have been asked to bring them to a few dinners/potlucks. I use about 2 tbls LESS butter because the cake mixes I get are only 16.25 oz, not 18.25.

Yikes! Did not work for me. Mushy even after 10 extra minutes. Since I had to use a different size pan than recommended I gave it 3 stars otherwise it would have been 1.

I MADE THIS AS INSTRUCTED, WHEN I MAKE THEM AGAIN, I'M GOING TO COOK THE FIRST CAKE LAYER FOR A LITTLE LONGER, I DIDN'T HAVE PROBLEMS LIKE SOME OF THE OTHER REVIEW-ERS. I DID LET THEM SET IN THE FRIDGE OVER NIGHT BEFORE CUTTING THEM. I MADE THEM FOR A BIRTHDAY AT WORK, EVERYONE WAS WOW-ED, THEY LOVED THEM! I WOULD MAKE THEM AGAIN IN A HEARTBEAT, NEXT TIME, I'M GOING TO ADD SOME NUTS.

Great recipe! This is the second time that I have made this desert and I love it. Took it to a 4th of July party with my family and they thought it was delicious, and one of my cousins asked for the recipe. The only thing that I change is the pan size, instead of an 8x10 (which I don't have), I use a 9x13 and don't bake for as long. Thanks for sharing the recipe, I will definitely make again!

What a fabulous treat!  I made this for my husband and he loved it!  It was deliciously creamy and gooey after sitting in the fridge for an afternoon before serving.  We had it warm and topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Yum-o!

The brownies are absolutely delicous.  Very rich and chocalety.  you don't even need the white fluffy frostingon top, or whatever that crud is.  These brownies stand alone and proud in the kingdom of brownies.  They are the King of the dessert world.  They are head cheese of the sweets.  They are the President of after dinner snacks.  They are the Ruler of chocolate and caramel mix.  They are a little softer towards the middle, but they still get the job done.  They are the Chief of sweets.  The end-all best.  Thank you very much for adding these to my life.  Thank you soooo much.  They saved my family from sure disaster.  We LOVE Paul or whoeve made this recipe.  Peace and love to all who come across this recipe, and death and dishonor to those who ignore it or do it injustice.

Okay, I made this today, and it turned out very well.  They key is to let it cool overnight and then its perfectly fine to cut into squares.  I added pecans to the cake portion, and served it with vanilla ice cream drizzled with a thin caramel sauce, and they were a hit.  I didn't have a 8x10 pan either, but I did it in a 9x13 and it was fine.  I just sort of dropped the top cake layer over the caramel, and it all swirled and marbled like its supposed to look.

These were good. Very rich, and had great flavor. For something made of all packaged items, I was very impressed. I do think they needed to cook longer than stated, but I ate them still half raw and loved every bite.

These are wonderful. I followed the recipe to the letter. I baked it in a 10" diameter Corning baking dish, so it took 40 minutes  for the brownies to become firm.  Because I used a circular baking dish, I served it as pie wedges; again, truly outstanding.

This recipe is super easy!  The blondies are more "cakey" than I'd prefer, but that's to be expected with the ingredients.  Definately something to make in a pinch, but not sure it's a "keeper".

Okay, I am bummed...this recipe looked great plus had great reviews, however, I guess I did something wrong because it didn't work for me.  It was like the cake batter would not cook fully.  Anyone have any suggestions?  I would like to give it another try!

Absolutely wonderful.  Like biting into a piece of heavan.  Don't pass these by.  I am surpised this man has shared such a wonderful secret.  It is nice to see people share wonderful things in the world, instead of keeping them secret for profit or greed.

Easy recipe and delicious.  Luckily a friend e-mailed me this recipe, or I might have never found it.  Easy to bake.  I don't even let them cool down.  I scoop out some of the nice hot brownie and top it with vanilla icecream and whipcream.  Definately to die for.

It’s ok. As is, the brownie has a dry hard crust. You have to microwave it and then add ice cream to make it decent. Not worth making again

I first reviewed these 10 yrs ago as chef tara....i am making them tonight for a holiday party. After all this time, these are still my "something special" that people go crazy for. As stated in my original review, 33 caramels is what ya need:)

I accidentally used sweetened condensed milk in place of evaporated milk in this recipe and it turned out DELICIOUS! I didn't add the SCM to the cake mix, though, just to the caramels.  To the cake batter, I just added a little bit of milk. YUM! I took this to a shower and received LOTS of compliments!

Looked good but didn't cook right. I believe the pan size lested is wrong. They were far too gooey, not cutting into squares and there was no other flavor other than... sweet. No dimension to the flavors.

Is it really an 8X10 pan?  That is an odd size.  I have one, but the bars seemed too thick compared to the picture.  I found these to be too concentrated of sweet.  If I made them again, I would mix in the chocolate chips.
