I used the whole can of broth and no water so I wouldn't waste the extra broth but the soup was a ittle salty. Next time I won't add the extra salt or I'll use plain cream cheese.  I went ahead and added the milk and cream cheese to the asparagus mix instead of to the individual bowls because I wasn't eating this all at once.  Also, all of the asparagus blended fine in one batch.

I usually try to stick to the recipe, but I had to make a couple of minor changes based on what I had on hand.  Basically I doubled all the ingredients, except that I used 4 cups of chicken broth.  I also did not have the cream cheese specified, so I added a bunch of scallions to the leeks and used an 8 ounce brick of cream cheese.  The bottom line is that this is a delcious soup that is as easy as it gets, but is elegant enough to serve to "company".  Loved it, thanks for a great recipe!

I made this recipe using spring garlic and green onions instead of leeks. It turned out very good. Mmm. Will make it again.
