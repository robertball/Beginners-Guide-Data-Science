I've made this recipe twice. As written, it is four stars but with a few changes it easily becomes five stars! I added celery, used 1% milk and as surprising as this sounds 98% fat free soup! It didn't taste enough like seafood for our taste so I added a can of chopped clams with the juice and that made a big difference! I love that this recipe uses imitation crab meat since it's such a low calorie protein source. Since I cut way back on fat and calories in this recipe, I might add some bacon next time for more depth in the flavor. I'll make this often in the cold winter months since it's so easy and one of my hubby's favorite soups!

For the time spent, this recipe is Legit!! One I will make again for sure.  I made mine with imitation lobster and added celery and turkey bacon.  I'm cuttin Cals so I also used fat free half and half.  I'm sure it's just as great the original way.  Very easy!!

I made this with fat free half and half and  doubled the amount of imitation crab meat. My husband loved it. It came together very quickly.  I served it with grilled ham and cheese sandwiches to round out the meal.

I don't usually try recipes that haven't been rated/reviewed yet, but I'm glad I tried this one!  Very tasty for such a quick, easy recipe. My husband and father ate 3 servings!! I added 1/4 cup chopped parsley in at the end for some color and freshness.

I love seafood/fish chowders and imitation crab and had really high hopes for this...I still can't believe just HOW MUCH I *didn't* like it! :( I found it pretty flavorless and the squishy texture of the imitation crab was very disconcerting.

Fantastic! I was skeptical but I wanted to find a new recipe for the imitation crabmeat - we loved this! I did add celery and used milk in place of half of the half-and-half (we didn't want to run out and not have any for coffee) and it was plenty thick. It had a slight sweet flavor, everyone really liked it. It was quick and easy - will definitely be making this again! Corn would go very good with this recipe too.

I was searching for a recipe to use immitation crab. Glad I came across this one! Followed the recipe with a few tweaks, using non fat half and half. Before I sauted the onions, I sauted 4 slices of bacon. I set aside the bacon and crumbled for garnish. I then sauted the onions in the bacon fat. I also sauted about a clove of fresh garlic with my onions. Into my soup I added a can of clams and thier juice, and instead of salt I used old bay seasoning. Also added a tsp of hot sauce... this probably cut down on the 'sweetness' noted in other reviews. In my chowder I used red potatoes with the peels still on (HATE peeling em!) Added nice color along with about a tbsp of dried parsley. Gotta give this one a try!

My husband wanted some seafood chowder and this looked like it would hit the spot. I had some imitation crab that I needed to use up. I pretty much followed the recipe except I only had 2 C of Half and Half. Another reviewer said she used half that and half milk and it was still plenty thick. I would've liked it better if it were thicker. It was more soupy; which was alright, but I thought it should've been thicker. I also used 2 packs of imitation crab and glad that I did. It made for a nice chunky chowder. My husband thoroughly enjoyed it! Will make this one again! Thanks for posting.

I thought this was okay.  I added a lot more salt and pepper than the recipe suggested.  It didnt seem to flavorful, there was something missing.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This was very good for a quick chowder.  I didn't add bacon, but will next time (Lent) as I like the flavor bacon adds to chowders.  It's also a much less expensive recipe to make than traditional chowders.  I'll make it again, but will try to add more depth.

This was a great way to stretch a can of chowder, but I was not a fan of the imitation crab in this soup. I sent the leftovers to work with my boyfriend. I think the soup would have been better if I omitted the crab and added some cheese.

The flavor was okay.  I added corn and bacon.  None of my family, including me, liked how squishy the chunks of imitation crab got in the heat from this soup.

Too sweet. I don't know if it was the brand I used, but the imitation crab seemed to make the soup "sweet". I followed directions and used all ingredients specified except for the white pepper. Thought that I would like this because I DO like She-Crab soup. Nope.

I had some leftover imitation crab from a wedding reception, along with some leftover half and half---searched using "ingredients" and found this recipe.  I followed advice of previous reviewers and added:  1/2 cup diced celery.  I also added 1/2 tsp of Old Bay Seasoning (I use this in almost all seafood recipes.  Once complete, I added some hot sauce and topped with bacon bits (also leftover from reception)!    This recipe is G R E A T!!!  I think I will use it to make clam chowder next time---it's a great base.  The imitation crabmeat is a bit sweet (it has added sugar), so I found it necessary to offset the sweetness with the hot sauce and bacon bits---green onions would also be a great addition!   Thanks for a wonderful recipe that I will use again and again!

Love this as a base for using up leftover salmon.  Swapped krab with salmon and added can of chopped clams with juice, bacon, celery and frozen corn.  Sometimes add shrimp too.
