This is awsome I ate so fast I almost forgot to come up for air.  The only change I made was I coated chicken in  flour before browning

This was very good!  I added minced garlic with the onion, because, in my opinion, main dishes are always better with garlic.  I took the advice from another reviewer to coat the chicken in flour before browning it.  Also, when I put the chicken in the sauce for the last part of the cooking, I covered the pan so that it would cook faster.  I will definitely make this again!

Wow...how can so few ingredients be so delicious?! I've made this a couple times and it will now be a weekly staple  because I almost always have everything I need already in the house! This is really, really good. I add garlic as well. I've made it without flour on the chicken and with flour. Both ways are great, but I prefer the flour.  Excellent recipe-THANK YOU!
