This cake is moist and delicious. I topped it with a homemade coconut cream cheese frosting, (1 8 oz pkg cream cheese, 1 stick butter, 1 1/2 cup powdered sugar and 2 tsp coconut extract.) Then I topped it with flaked coconut and refrigerated it for 2 hours to firm up the frosting.

Everybody at my office party loved it and I recevied no less than 6 requests for the recipe.

I had 12 oz of graham crackers I needed to use up so I scaled the recipe to three fourths and baked it in a 13x9 inch pan.  It was done in 30 minutes.  The cake didn't rise much, but it was moist, tender, and has a uniquely delicious taste from the graham crackers. It makes a great sheet cake and goes well with a whipped cream cheese or whipped cream frosting.

My husband gave this a 10! Delicious! Followed the review by STEVECHIN for the coconut cream cheese icing. Loved that this is something different from the norm. Thanks!

Yum!  This cake was really good!  I did have a problem getting it out of the pan, but I think if I let it cool more next time around, we should be good to go.  We hosted a Hawaiian themed party, this was dessert and everyone raved about it!  I made the Whipped Cream Cheese frosting on the site and served a dollop of it with each piece of cake, which seemed to work out well.  Will definitely make this one again!

I had high hopes for this recipe, really I did. I was a little bit worried because of the lack of flour, but because of all the other positive reviews, I thought I would give it a try. It smelled heavenly in the oven, but about a half hour before it was supposed to be done, it smelled burnt. When I looked, smoke was pouring out of the oven! I pulled it out, and even though it still seemed too moist, I tried to turn it over onto a serving dish. What I ended up with was a huge... towering... blob. The outside looked like burnt jello, greasy glisten and all. I have to admit, I didn't want the cake to be a total waste of good ingredients, so I picked out a relatively safe looking portion from the inside. It tasted only average, nothing special. After it sat for a while the tast improved, but I will not be making this again.

I tried this recipe just last night and it smelled really good (I haven't tasted it yet). The cake browned VERY quickly even though I turned the oven down to 340 or so--I wanted to make sure it would get baked through so I left it in as long as I could without totally burning it--it did get slightly burnt on the outside and this was after it was in for not even a full hour. I dusted it with powdered sugar to make it look better. It looks like it should taste good.

I followed this recipe exactly as written but the cake stuck to the top and sides and was a complete disaster.  The taste of the leftovers was lovely, but unfortunately I coudln't serve it to anyone.
