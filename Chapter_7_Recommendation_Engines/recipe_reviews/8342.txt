This is one of my favorite cakes, but I have always made it with a small box of jello instead of the sugar.  I have found using the watermelon or strawberry jello to be the best.  It just seems to give it an added kick, but is not quite so sweet as it is with marshmallows AND sugar.  My favorite is the watermelon jello.  It gives it that right amount of tartness.

Absolutely delicious!!! I reduced the sugar to 2/3 cups and the cake came out perfect; just the right tartness. The whole family loved this moist cake.

I just finished baking and eating a piece of this delicious cake! I followed the suggestion of another user and used some dry strawberry jello powder (only about 2 tablespoons, so it wouldn't be overpowering).I added that to 1/2 cup sugar and then mixed it in with the fruit. It turned out wonderfully and I don't think it's too sweet at all. I baked mine is a greased bundt pan and it looks lovely! I can't wait to share this tastey cake with my family.

This is the first time I have EVER made anything with Rhubarb. I followed the recipe, and it is delicious.  Just enough tart/sweet.
I wondered if the cake would overflow the pan, but it didn't.
I'd suggest chopping the rhubarb into really small pieces to make sure the batter fits in the pan.
This would be good with cinnamon ice cream!

This was a great recipe...for those of us who like rhubarb without the fake flavors of jello.  Didn't use the box mix though, instead i used a scratch recipe for butter cake.  Cooked down the rhubarb first, as my pan wasn't deep enough for all the stuff.

Very easy to make and delicious!  I used a strawberry cake mix instead of the yellow and it was wonderful!  My kids loved it and it was easy enough that they could help make it!

This cake is great. I did reduce the sugar and it was perfect. I tried it two ways with the jello and without and it was better without the jello. The jello seemed to mask the flavor of the ruhbarb.

This was a great easy recipe.  The rhubarb was a little tart but was great warm with whipped cream on it.  My pan was really full but everything fit in without overflowing.

I used a spice cake mix instead of yellow and strawberry flavored marshmellows with 2/3 cup of sugar in the rhubarb. This was a big hit by all. Very simple recipe to follow. I will definitely make it again.

Very easy to make and has a wonderful taste! The marshmallows just melt into the cake mix to make it such a moist dessert! I used my convection setting on my oven and reduced cooking time to about 40 minutes. Top of cake (which becomes the bottom when its flipped) was getting very dark so i did not bake the whole hour! Enjoy, its great served with cool whip or ice ream!

This recipe was extremely easy to make. I did not add 1 cup of sugar instead I only added 1/2 cup and this was definitely enough as it still was very sweet. I used a glass pan and my cake was fully baked in 45 minutes. My family loved every last bite!

I decreased the amount of sugar a bit - which I do with just about all dessert recipes. Other than that, I made the cake exactly as written and there was no need for any changes/additions. It's great as is and no mods are needed.

This recipe was ok...I made it for a party, and wished I had left it in the pan as a lot of the topping spilled over the sides when I turned it onto the plate and made a mess. I made it according to the directions and it tasted ok...but nothing special (and I'm really not sure I think the marshmallows add anything). I do wonder if people showing the photos either have different rhubarb than mine or add food coloring as mine, even the earliest of the spring, would never be that rosy red color after so long of a cooking time (or even for a shorter cooking time I suspect). I will try it again without the marshmallows to see if I find them worth going out and buying them for the recipe.

Came out great!  I used slightly less sugar, but otherwise just the same. I also didn't invert it just to make it easier and it was still wonderful that way.  :)

I have made this a few times now and really like the flavor and chose this recipe over other ones because there isn't any strawberry jello in. It lets the rhubarb flavor really come through. The cake ratio is off. There is too much cake. This would be better in a  11 x 14 and maybe increase the rhubarb. I used a golden butter cake mix instead of yellow because I like the flavor better. And I only used 1/2 cup of sugar. I only needed to cook this for 45 minutes. This is a pretty good size cake to try and flip over. I did not have a platter/plate big enough, so I just left it in the pan.

Oh my goodness! I made this yesterday and it is soooooo good! I had frozen rhubard in my freezer. I let it thaw out and I did drain the juice that was caused by it being frozen. I also didnt have a bag of mini marshmallows, but a bag a regular marshmallows. I just cut them up and the cake was awesome!

I couldn't fit that much rhubarb and marshmallows into the pan and still have room for the cake batter, which was too bad as I found it a little too sweet.  The next time I try this I will use all the rhubarb, but not all of the marshmallows.

Good cake, but wish it had a more rhubarb taste.  I followed the recipe exactly, but only baked it 50 minutes.  Next time I will cut back on the sugar and marshmallows and add some red food coloring as the rhubarb turned pale when cooked.  Everyone else loved it and I served it with vanilla ice cream.  I prefer the rhubarb crisp by Chef John.

I tried this recipe because it sounded interesting and unique, and I wasn't disappointed. I used about 7 cups rhubarb and the whole cup of sugar. It wasn't overly sweet at all. I thought a 9x13-inch pan would be too small, so I used an 11x15-inch pan, but I should have used a smaller pan. It was done in 33 minutes in my convection oven. My family loved it.
