I have made pesto plenty of times using my Vitamix machine and I thought it was pretty good. Little did I realize how unprepared I was for the burst of flavor that hit my mouth when I tasted this ground pesto sauce. It has been an hour since I ate it and I still have the full taste of the pesto in the back of my throat! This is THE only way I will ever prepare pesto sauce for my family. Thank you Chef John for introducing us to this revolutionary technique. It almost makes me want to use my mortar and pestle on just about anything...

RIDICULOUS!!!
This was ridiculously good!!  First time I've ever made pesto and won't make it any other way!!  OMG!  My 13 year old and husband gave it a "10" (we rate all of my food).
I understand that the secret to this amazing recipe is doing it a mortar & pestle.  If you do nothing else in the mortar, at the very least add the oil and incorporate it this way as oils tend to get bitter when whipped in a Vitamix or other blender/processer.  This is one of the (many) keys to why this is so amazing.  Use all of the freshest ingredients available and you'll have yourself some RAVE reviews!  I only wish I had a huge mortar!!  This was gone in one night with three people eating it.  It is amazing on fresh, toasted (wood-grilled preferably) buttered sourdough bread as an appetizer, too!  DON'T heat it as it will ruin it.  Just mix it into hot pasta or serve on buttered bread.  Indulgent!!  LOVE!!

Got a mortar & pestle just to try this with summer's bounty of basil.  Outstanding!  After my first batch I watched the video and it gave me a better idea of the technique.  Thanks Chef John.

It's really tasty. I used my usual olive oil, but I think I will try to find a mild version next time.

I wish I knew more about mortar and pestles. I have one with a rough interior as Chef John suggests, but mine seems smaller than the one Chef John was using. I had a hard time getting all the ingredients in mine.

May not have ground to a paste as in video, or used the correct cheese, but I loved not using my tiny food processor. No electricity? Make pesto! Taste is wonderful, can't wait to have it on bread!

Wow! Fantastic. It took some time pounding in the ingredients, but Chef John is right. It is absolutely worth it! I took a piece of bread to clean out the mortar bowl. Did not want to waste a drop. This is the first time I made pesto.

Wow. This was a revelation. I made half a batch because I was alone and my mortar and pestle is small; there was already a fair amount of cursing as I went about making this. It’s really not that much work, even if it feels like it at first; I was surprised at how quickly the basil leaves were pulverized. I ended up putting the garlic through a garlic press into the mortar, because I wasn’t having much success pounding it into a paste. The variety of basil I had might have been spicier than the Genovese type I’m used to--this pesto was SO sharp, and so fragrant! I even pulled the green sprouts from inside the cloves of garlic to keep it from being overpowering. I only used about 1/2 ounce Parmesan and 2 Tbsp olive oil for my half batch; my cup nearly runneth over. I put a few tablespoons of my amazing pesto on penne pasta and inhaled it. I need bigger and better equipment because I want to eat this stuff all summer long.

R EEEE DICULOUS !!!!
Wow!  Follow this recipe and you'll fall off your chair.    Definitely takes some elbow grease, but if you grow your own Basil this is a go too recipe for when you have too much and need to prune the plant back.  Thank you Chef John!

Let me tell you that I did not want to love this recipe. I love an easy food processor recipe, so I hoped the hard(ish) work wouldn’t actually be worth it. But THIS...this recipe is worth it. It’s so good. Just try it. I bought a mortar and pestle at tjmaxx for about $12. My tip is to fold a kitchen towel and place it under the bottom so that it doesn’t bang as loud. And let the tool work for you, you don’t have to put a lot of force into it or your hand will start to cramp. Then buy 2 baguettes and enjoy your life.

This is the only way to make pesto.  It's not often that I'm truly amazed by my own cooking, but using my mortar and pestle was worth every bit of effort.  And the wife loved it too.  Crushing everything together makes this magical combination of flavours.

Any recipe that lets me bust out my mortar and pestle is a win in my books! I just bought a tube of basil paste as it was cheaper, and it still ended up being delicious. A word of warning though, make sure your mortar is big enough to fit all of the ingredients. Mine wasn't, so I had to prepare everything in batches.

Chef John was right, the pestle did make all the difference in flavor.  Still, I did make the mistake of using too much sea salt in the pestle as the final product...though flavorful, was much saltier than I would have liked.  Basil seemed to take forever to grind up without more though.  Guess I will just have to be more patient and perhaps reevaluate my olive oil.  Used Bertolli as that is what I had on hand.  Still loved it and will replace the store-bought pesto I used to get with this method.

First Pesto I've ever made. Incredibly delicious, fragrant. 

The garlic does have a strong bite, and a few people were turned off by  it.

Highly recommend.

Since I am growing Genovese basil in my basement, I looked up pesto sauces and found this one.  I bought a large pestle and mortar set specifically to make this pesto. Tonight I harvested almost 9 ounces of basil leaves not including stems. I hadn't noticed the chef's note that a bunch of basil should weigh about 4-5 ounces,  and looked up the weight of a bunch on the internet that said with stems was about 2.5 ounces and without was about 1.4 ounces. I weighed out 1.4 ounces and added another handful of leaves to make it the large bunch called for in the recipe, but probably should have doubled the basil. Because it was late, I decided to pulse everything in a blender that the blades were low enough to blend the mixture once broken down.  I have never tasted pesto sauce,  but this was amazing. It was a bit heavy on the garlic, but we love garlic. I plan to make this again with the rest of the basil, but double the basil I used this time. Doing this will likely tone down the garlic.  I will freeze some of what I make since I found out it can be frozen.

This is delicious. I put it on top of a slice of mozzarella on top of a slice of tomato I grew in my garden.  The mortar and pestle are good exercise.

This was my first time ever making pesto, and my first time with a mortar and pestle. The flavor of this pesto is incredible. Well worth the extra effort and time! This is definitely one of my new favorite meals to make. Paired it with some pasta and grilled chicken.

Waiting to hear on family’s opinion but I like it.   Ideal way to use basil from the garden.   I did use almonds as suggested in place of pine nuts

Made with homegrown basil. I used three kinds: lemon basil, Genovese, and purple. It was delicious. Will use it on salmon tonight, but for now, had some on crackers (and some on fingers!) because I could not resist!

I'm a newbie at making (even eating!) pesto, but I won't be for long. This incredibly fresh and aromatic recipe is a winner for me! I'm glad I bought a live basil plant for this recipe when the prepared bunches cost twice as much. It made the taste burst to life. Loved it!

I don't have a mortal & pestle large enough for this so I used my vitamix.  Added a pinch of black pepper.  Both hubbs and I loved it!  Yum!  Thanks!!
