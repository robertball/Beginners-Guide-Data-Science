I loved it.  I did not put near as much bacon that was called for in recipe. A pound of bacon for each pound of potatoes seemed to be overkill and I really love bacon.  I used about 1/3 lb. of bacon and it seemed like plenty.  It may work better if you cooked the bacon and sprinkled it on with Parmesan cheese and lemon zest.  This will reduce the amount of grease in potatoes while cooking.  I reduced the amount of Parmesan cheese some also to about 1/3 cup instead of 1/2 cup per pound of potatoes.  The lemon zest was very good and really added a great flavor to the dish.  I loved this dish and will make it again, for sure.

Have cooked this several times and had to add more bacon because I used more potatoes (large family). Everyone loved it.

Made this exactly according to the recipe, and it simply did not taste good.  The bacon roasting with the potatoes was the culprit; the flavor was simply weird.  It would have been much better if the bacon were cooked separately and then crumbled on top.

Reduced the amount of bacon by half, since a 1:1 ratio of bacon to potatoes and cooking in the grease is a bit much. 

I cooked mine a little too long and the slivered onions charred a bit. Ideally, I'd roast for 15 minutes, stir, then roast for another 20. I did 40 minutes total and 35 would've been perfect. Lesson learned.

Very good and easy to put together. I did cook the bacon slightly before adding just to cut down on the grease a little. Next time I think I will halve the potatoes to allow the flavors to be absorbed more.

I cooked this just as the recipe called for.  It was so delicious!  I made this for a dinner party and was asked for the recipe.
