Good recipe, but the bread was too mushy. Try coating the bread with garlic butter first (or garlic/olive oil blend) and lightly toasting. Then, when you add the sauce, you will not drench the bread!

Fine pizza recipe with endless combination possiblities.  If you use the french loaf and want a little less bread, you can scoop out the centers of the loaves to your liking.  We did, and also found that provides an area to pack in more toppings like veggies!

Skip the sausage. Use pepperoni that has been microwaved between papertowels, for a non greasy dish that will draw raves from family & friends.

This makes a great quick meal that my kids absolutely loved--they were fighting over the last piece!  Next time I will toast the bread before adding toppings to give it more of a crunchy texture.

I made this as a "pizza night" alternative and we thought it was great. I used hoagie rolls that I toasted first, and added sliced green peppers and mushrooms. What a great Friday night movie dinner!

How can I not give this recipe 5 stars?  For starters it was easy and quick to make.  But the best part was it got rave reviews from my husband, three kids and my daughter's friend.  They carried on about how delicious it was for so long I was almost embarrassed about how easy it was to make.  I used a regular loaf of french bread (not a baguette) and it was plenty as it is very filling.  Thanks for the recipe!!

I have made many variations to this and none are bad.  Use any meats & vegetables that you have on hand. Very quick and easy.  My family even loves it when there are leftovers for the next day.

I made this because I used half a loaf of bread last night for garlic bread and needed to use the other half before it went bad. Because I was trying to get rid of leftovers, I didn't use any sausage (I was cooking for one and it's hard to get meat for just one person), but it tasted fine without it :) It's good meal when you want something tasty and quick.

I put a little olive oil and cooked the bread for about 7 min first to avoid sogginess.  I also added onion to mine, and next time I will only use half the sausage, as it was way too much.  But still, these are excellent!

This was a quick and easy recipe.  I work in a children's home so the conversion works well for me.  The only difference was that I got individual sub rolls for each of the kids.

This was so simple but quite tasty!  I brushed the bread with olive oil and sprinkled on some italian seasonings and then pre-baked for a few minutes before adding sauce and toppings.  The only thing I will do different next time is to add the cheese last, as the sausage got a little dried out being on the very top.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this using a mini baguette.  I didnâ€™t want my bread to get soggy, so I served the pizza sauce on the side for dipping.  I used hot Italian sausage, a mozzarella/provolone blend, the pepperoni, and added chopped green onion for a little more flavor/color.   Hubs and I agreed that this was too much bread.  I would make this again, but would pull out some of the bread, leaving about a half-inch (or less) shell.  I think that would also hold the toppings better.

These are delicious and versatile. You can mix and match the toppings: plain cheese, vegetarian, meat lovers, etc. All of my friends love it when I make these!

I made this tonight for dinner, and although I was really excited for it...it lacked something and I'm not sure what.  I may try it again with a few modifications to see if I can improve it.  I think some seasoning could help it tremendously.  I did follow some of the recommendations by others to toast the bread first and to add additional toppings (I added green peppers and onions, which I sauted briefly before adding them. My bread was pretty puffy, so I carved out about a half inch deep trough to settle the toppings in. I put a little bit of cheese in with the toppings on the bottom layer to hold it together, and then I topped the entire thing with cheese so the toppings wouldn't fall off.

I purchased store made fresh french bread from Walmart to make this receipe. I also toasted my bread with olive oil as the spread for 8 minutes at 450 before I put the sauce, cheese, pepperoni, and italian sausage on the pizza. I used Kraft pizza blend cheese and melted it with the toppings in the microwave because I did not want the bread to get any toaster then it already was. Everyone loved it even the kids. Thanks :)

Perfect as a quick snack. I like to use hoagie rolls, but that's just because those are usually what I have on hand. I also spread each roll with garlic butter and parmesan cheese and toast 'em in the oven while I gather the rest of the ingredients for an extra layer of flavor.

i am rating this a "5" the way i make it.  making as the recipes states, i'd only rate it about a "4".  i used atleast 1 1/2 cups mozzarella & 3/4c sauce per baguette.  i also used turkey pepperoni so it wouldn't be so greasy.  i also suggest toasting the bread for about 5-10min. prior to adding the sauce(this way the bread doesn't suck up the sauce & you don't end up having mushy bread).  excellent recipe!!

Very tasty and easy! I used a slightly lighter bread than baguette (which is pretty dense and firm) - it ended up being a bit flakier after baking - but it was still really good. I didn't have a ton of time to cook dinner, so I used a store-bought pizza sauce - which didn't detract from the taste at all!

One of my favorite french bread pizza! I toasted the bread first so you won't get a soggy result. I used Hunts cheese and garlic tomato sauce, added minced garlic.

This isn't really a recipe in my opinion, more of a dinner idea - It got 4 stars for it being an easy & quick dinner. Too much greasy sausage in my opinion, will scale it back or use just turkey pepperoni and some veggies next time. Also, follow another reviewer's advice about toasting the bread (french bread, don't use a baguette), and I used Green Mill pizza sauce (don't know if you can get it everywhere, but very good tasting). This dinner is good for a busy night, and a better choice than frozen pizza!

This is a very simple, yet very good recipe.  There are endless variations of this.  I use this whenever I can't think of what to have for dinner, because it's so quick and easy.

This meal has been in my rotation since college, maybe even high school.  Didn't ever consider it to be a 'recipe' but I guess it is.  Ground beef with onions and cheddar cheese is one of the variations I've done.  Any way you make it, this is always a quick but good meal.

This is a great recipe, very easy. Day-old baguettes or French bread are best, as they're slightly dry. Failing that, just slice your bread in half before you start cooking and measuring everything else--it'll air out pretty fast once sliced in half. Be sure to drain the sausage--the recipe doesn't say that, but it probably assumes you know to do that anyway.

My boyfriend and I really enjoyed this pizza!  We added chopped up green peppers and used a whole wheat baguette.  We ate the whole thing!  yummy.

I might use a thinner loaf the next time I make this, but it was a nice change to our usual pizza night.

Great basic recipe, you can customize this in about every way possible. I also think it can bake a bit longer than listed, but that's only because we like our "crust" pretty crispy.

So good. I used french bread, left out the sausage and added peppers and onions. I also pre-baked the bread before adding the toppings because we like a crispier pizza. Very easy week day supper.

These were pretty good.  I added green peppers & red onions just out of personal preference.  This could have used a bit more "umph".  Perhaps next time I'll add some extra spices.

Awesome!  I used large sized french and sourdough loaves.  I used an assortment of tasty ingredients.  This is an excellent template for quick and easy homemade pizza.  They were filling and everyone loved them.

Quick, easy, delicious! Just eating it now. Like others, I toasted the bread a bit before putting the sauce on but I think next time I'll toast a little more, still a little soggy. I'm really enjoying it right now though! Thanks for the recipe!

Quick, easy and good.  The best combination.  Can't eat sausage so I left that off but did add mushrooms.  This is such a versatile idea.  You can mix and match ingredients just like on pizza.  Makes a nice lunch.  No more Stouffers for us.  Also I never measure the cheese or sauce just spread it on!

This is a very tasty dish...most of my family really enjoyed it. Some complained that the bread got "soggy", though. I used a loaf of rustic Italian style bread, and I used bulk pork sausage instead of the Bob Evans sausage roll. I felt that the amount of pizza sauce was way off. Only half a cup for two baguette halves? I used WAY more than that. Thanks for sharing the recipe...it is super easy, and really tasty!

Yum! This is such a great and versatile recipe. You could top with whatever pizza toppings you like, doesn't have to be sausage and pepperoni. I hollowed out my bread so it wouldn't be so "bready", used a 15 oz. can of pizza sauce, and used a lot more cheese. Baked until cheese was melted (it was a little longer than 5 minutes.)

This was just stupid easy & soo tasty. We do homemade pizza a lot. I'm not sure why it never occured to me to try a french bread version. This will probably become a regular for busy school time weeknights!

This was good. I still like Stouffer's french bread pizzas a little better.... Made this tonight for my bf and I. I followed the directions to a T except for doing the following: a) brushing the cut sides of my baugette with a little melted butter and garlic powder and broiling for a minute (watch carefully!) to toast (this took care of the soggy problem that some reviewers mentioned), b) subbed a combination of mozzarella/cheddar cheese for the Italian blend called for and c) added a little bit of dried minced onion (appox. 1/2 T), Italian seasoning (1/2 t) and crushed fennel seed (1/4 t) to the sausage as it browned. My bf thought the sauce was too sweet, but that can easily be fixed by switching brands or making my own. I do agree with one of the reviewers who found this to be more of a meal idea rather than a recipe, but for what's it worth, it's a good, cheap and quick meal. I will make this again, but next time, will layer the sausage and finish with the cheese as my sausage kept falling off - lol! Great recipe!

This was very quick and easy. Any pizza toppings are good, even plain cheese. Next time I make it, I will probably "pre-toast" the bread before adding sauce and other toppings.

This was OK, not as great as I thought it would be. It was difficult to cut. Something smaller, like individual hoagie rolls, would be better. Also, toasting them first is definitely needed so it's not so soggy.
