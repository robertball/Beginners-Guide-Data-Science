I loved this recipe particularly because I love ripe olives.  Made the recipe as noted but cooked the chicken for more than 5 minutes since my breasts were very thick. One pan dinners - got to love 'em.

Love, love, love this recipe.  It is easy to make and tastes great.  My family loves olives so this is a huge hit...I add extra olives!  I always cook the chicken a little longer.

I'm a bit torn on reviewing since I improvised some, however I really liked the way it came out so I'd like to make the suggestion :)
Instead of cream of chicken I used cream of mushroom & instead of milk I used some left over cream I had on hand. I used 2-3 times the lemon and threw in a clove a garlic. It was a hit with my husband and kids! Will make again!

This was OK for the most part.  My family liked the sause more than they liked the chicken.  Next time I make my dish, I will slice the chicken into chicken stripes.  My husband especially liked the sause and he never likes most anything I make.

My whole family LOVED this. I was looking forward to the leftovers but we all had seconds and there isn't anything left! That's a lot to say with my picky eaters.

This was ok. I think it would have been better without the milk.

Very good, my family loved it.  I tripled the recipe because I have a BIG EATIN FAMILY!!!  I used one 10.75oz can of cream of chicken soup (all I had) and 2 cans 10.75oz of cream of mushroom soup.  Added lots of fresh garlic, about 8 oz of fresh sliced mushrooms and added lots of spices because thats how we roll!  I used Oregano, Basil, and a little red pepper to chicken prior to browning.  I served this dish with Angel Hair pasta and a side of fresh asparagus. DELISH!!!!!  I grilled my asparagus with a little olive oil and some Parmesean.  The sauce tasted AMAZING with the asparagus as well so we mixed everything together.  REALLY GOOD!!!  Thank you much for the recipe!!  OH and I cooked the chicken in sauce much longer because I had some very thick chicken breasts!  YUM!!
