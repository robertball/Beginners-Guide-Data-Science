This was a delicious and healthy meal.  I did not add the extra pasta water but did add freshly grated parmesan cheese.

I made this recipe for work and had to quadruple it for the size of the group I had.  I only used 6 cans of cannellini beans and 2 pounds of pasta, but it was way too much pasta in my opinion, it took over and that was all you could see and taste.  Next time, I'll only use 1/4 pound for the recipe as written or 1 pound for the quadrupled amount.  Since the cannellini beans are the same color as the pasta, I may use red kidney beans next time for a nice contrast.  Or stick with the cannellini and use spinach pasta instead.  Everyone loved the taste, but agreed that it was too much pasta.

This turned out nicely! I could not get escarole at the grocery so I used kale - it worked well. I chopped it up small. My husband is a vegan  - I am always looking for yummy recipes for him! A+

This was totally bland for us, and we are not the types to overly salt/spice. It wasn't the worst thing I've tried, but my husband & I basically rock-paper-scissors-ed it to see who would eat it for leftovers. ;-)

This was a really yummy and healthy tasting meal.  We had a bunch of mushrooms to use up, so we added extra.  We also used an olive tomato sauce, regular lettuce and served up the pasta and sauce separately, so it was the right amount of everything.  We halved the recipe too.  It was really great!

I made a few substitutions based on what I had at the house. I used one can each cannelloni and red kidney beans just to spruce up the color. I jazzed up the spices a bit, too, adding garlic salt, celery salt (in lieu of the regular table salt) & a bit of crushed fennel for the Italian sausage flavor. I used 2 cups vegetable broth in addition to the 1 cup reserved water from pasta. Finally, I cooked almost the full pound of pasta but only used about two cups of the cooked pasta in the soup to keep it from soaking up all of my liquid and taking over the dish.

Yummy however I wanted more of a soup and the recipe as written had too much pasta and not enough liquid. I added 2 cups of pasta water and a container of vegetable broth.

I love this recipe!  Great vegan dish.  I made two substitutions based on 12 servings.  I used two heads of Kale instead of Escarole because I couldn't find organic Escarole at my store and I used (1 lb. dry) homemade organic Kidney Beans instead of canned Cannellini Beans.   I cooked the beans the day before.   Awesome recipe!   Next time I'll use half the Ditalini Pasta stated in the recipe.
