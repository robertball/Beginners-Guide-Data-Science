If you like mangoes and crumble than you will like this dessert. Its very easy and simple to make and it taste good, the good thing about this recipe is that it allows for me to add more to it, to give it my own  twist. I will make this again.

I do like this dessert, but my family loved it! Normally they're the ones that like really sweet things. This was not super sweet, but very pleasant. I did have to make a change because none of the stores I went to had passion fruit at the time. I used a can of crushed pineapple. I imagine this would have tasted much nice with passion fruit. I'll make this again.

Very tasty. Due to ingredients and number of people made some changes. Used 2 mangoes and 1 large passionfruit. Increased dry ingredients by a third. Would try again!

This has 5 star potential with a few small tweaks. I think if I were to make this again, I'd use 3 cups of mango, strain the passionfruit, and use less cinnamon/more nutmeg.

Made exactly as is, I think this is a great breakfast.  I used sweet ripe mangoes, but the addition of the lime and passionfruit made it so tart, I feel it would have needed some extra sugar (mixed with the fruit) to be a dessert served to guests.  (I usually cut sugar in recipes, so don't have an unusually sweet tooth.) But the idea and mix of fruits are great and I will definitely be making this again.  (PS: Mango cobbler is another delicious way to use up a lot of mangoes.)
