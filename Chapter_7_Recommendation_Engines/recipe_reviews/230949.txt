I really enjoyed this dish! I used coconut milk instead of both the cream and vegetable stock and am very glad I did, it would have been very bland without it. Also I would recommend not putting the spices in with the garlic and butter, because they just clump and stick to the pan and don't get stirred in as well.

My husband loved it. I was a little weirded out by adding the flour to the cream. It tasted ok. I will probably make it again, with my own variations.

Really enjoyed this recipe! Followed advice read on a previous review and omitted the broth and cream, and in place used 1 can of coconut milk. Also used fresh ginger in place of dried ground ginger.
No leftovers!

Great recipe and perfect for weeknights since it is ready in 30 minutes. I added the spices with the broth to keep them from clumping and burning. The last minute or so of cooking, I added fresh baby spinach. Turned out great and there were no leftovers.

This dish is amazing! Everyone enjoyed it and ate it again the next day; including my toddlers!  We added garden fresh broccoli and tofu. This will become a regular in our household! We made it a little saucier with more broth and put it over rice.

Excellent flavor, an easy satisfying dish. I added 2/3 cup of cream, 1/3 cup milk instead of the whole cup of cream.

My family, including my 6-year-old daughter- enjoyed this dish. I used coconut milk instead of broth and cream like the other reviewers suggested and it was delicious. I whisked the curry powder and ginger into the coconut first and then added it to the vegetables after saut√©ing them in butter.

Loved this! Used the coconut milk and a little broth. Green beans instead of peas, fresh ginger. Sprinkled a little coconut on top and golden raisins. Yum!

Lovely. The only substitutions I made were because I didn't have yogurt and sweet potato. I used sour cream and regular potatoes instead.  The sour cream and lemon made a big difference in the finishing flavor notes.

this is pretty good. I used a can of coconut milk instead of cream.  I didn't have vegetable broth, so I just used water. I also used regular potatoes instead of sweet potatoes cause it was what i had on hand . I will be making this again and plan on making it with the vegetable broth and sweet potatoes.
