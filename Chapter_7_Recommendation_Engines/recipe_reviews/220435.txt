I followed the recipe exact, only using super chunk peanut butter because that was all I had on hand. They turned out absolutely beautiful, just like peanut butter cookies are supposed to look. SIDE NOTE: My issue with making cookies lately is with the heat, they get.......weird, even with how fast the family can eat them. This cookie turned out perfect and it was a small enough batch that I didn't have to worry about the cookies "wilting" in the heat. My husband called me this morning and said that not only did they hold up well in Tupperware for his lunch but his co-workers liked them, too.

Excellent cookies!  The best peanut butter cookies I have ever made!  I did change one thing though.  I used 1/4 cup of whole wheat flour and decreased the 1 cup white flour by a little bit.  Baking also took 5 minutes longer in my oven.

This is a very easy recipe. It was simple and extremely tasty! I didn't use the silicone baking mat though, i only a standard cookie sheet.

Though an easy recipe, the texture of the cookies was grainy, entirely too salty and sweet for my taste, and not peanut buttery enough. Edible, but not really enjoyable.

These cookies are easy and yummy! They are great the way they are, but I decided to add white chocolate chips and coconut. It made these cookies even better. :)

Simply the best cookies we have ever had!!! Loved by everyone in my family!!! Only change I made is that I used margarine instead of butter as I cannot have butter!!! Wonderful recipe! Only problem was that they didn't last long with my family! They disappreared very quickly!!!

Indeed this is worth the five stars. It's the same recipe I've been using for years.  No matter what kind of peanutbutter you use, it always comes out great....and never subsitute the butter!

Great cookies, my kids beg me to bake them.  To DerAvi - you cannot substitute baking soda for baking powder, or vice versa.  They are different chemical compounds.  That is why you need to use one or the other or both in recipes.

Brilliant, I took these in to work and they went down a treat!
I got 30 biscuits out of this recipe, made exactly as shown. They keep well too, if you can resist.

I made a mistake first time around - I didn't have baking soda in hand, so I substitute it with baking powder (1/2 tsp baking soda equals to 1 1/2 tsp baking powder), but that didn't turn out well. Also You really have to let it firm in the refrigerator just as the direction says, otherwise your cookie will turn out very gooey and buttery and not really good.

I've been baking cookies for years and for several years in between my baking life,  gave up as I couldn't find a peanut butter recipe that worked for me. But this one is perfect. Cookies melt in your mouth and are soft and delicious.  I didn't change anything. My family and friends love this cookie and I have to make 3 batches at a time.

Love PB Cookies and these are no exception. I added mini chocolate morsels. Using my cookie scoop these were a breeze to make. I like mine a tad undercooked when the edges are just starting to brown

A perfect peanut butter cookie, in my opinion! I made these exactly as directed, and they turned out beautiful! This made exactly 24 cookies, using a 1-1/2" cookie scoop. Baking time was also spot-on. Thanks Chef John!

These cookies are crispy not soft, personally I like them that way. If you like soft and chewy cookies you've got the wrong recipe. But these are very quick and easy I've got nothing to improve on this recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly.  I even left the dough for three hours in the frig.  When I started to work with it, the dough was so crumbly that it was very difficult to form into balls.  Once i was able to force it into balls, it crumbled completely when I used the fork to flatten it .  After a tray of completely crumbled little piles of dough, I just tossed everything into the trash.  I saw no point in trying to bake. That's the end of Chef John for me.

I just made these,  pretty easy,  I did not refrigerate them, but had to put them right into the oven,  they taste wonderful. I think they will even be better tomorrow.  Followed the recipe.

8-14-2018 ~This is a good, but typical recipe for peanut butter cookies; in fact, virtually identical to "Classic Peanut Butter Cookies," also from this site.  For more even distribution I was more comfortable using ordinary table salt rather than kosher salt, reducing the amount a little to adjust for that.  I used a heaping 1/2 cup of peanut butter to ensure they were good and peanut buttery.  Reliable recipe for the traditional peanut butter cookie.

These cookies were very good but had little or no peanutbutter taste.Made as directed  except mixed by hand as my mixer conked out.  As for the reviewer who said she made 30 I would say how? I made 12. Don't think it was worth the effort. Sorry Chef John. I usually love your recipes.

Yes! Delicious and simple. Used chunky, added vanilla and cinnamon (cuz seriously who the hell doesn't put those two ingredients in cookies??) Had to add a little extra flour to remedy dough that was very sticky. Boom

I am dreaming of these cookies right now.  At my desk, at work.  That's how fantastic they were.  I didn't change a  thing and they were the best peanut butter cookies I've ever had.  I saved half of the dough for later, because I know I would not have the willpower to not wolf down a whole batch of these.  I have a feeling "later" is going to be this weekend.  Just, wow.

I love this recipe. Just went with what I had. Had salted butter so used just a dash of salt.  I didn't have brown sugar so went with a cup of white sugar with a tablespoon of molasses.  Had crunchy peanut butter.  Added dash of vanilla but I don't know if it was necessary.  Will definitely make again.

Easy recipe that has a great flavor! I made it exactly as written. Do suggest keeping as much of the cookie dough balls in refrigerator as I find the cookies have a lighter, higher rise.

Made these in prep for a hurricane and they were perfect!  I did not have time to refrigerate them and I do not think it made a difference.  I used Splenda brown sugar and I  added an extra dab of Peanut butter to make sure the taste was really pea- nutty!  The texture was fine but the brown sugar I used might be the reason they would crumble when rolling them out but  just keep rolling.  When I smashed them down on the baking sheet, I dipped the fork in sugar and pressed them twice.    I think the Kosher salt made the difference for the unique spin on the taste.  FAB-U-LAS recipe !!

Easy, quick and delicious peanut butter cookies! I made these for a friend and he absolutely loved them. Perfect small batch recipe. I followed the directions exactly but did chill dough overnight! They were perfect. Has a request for "more", so make another batch the next week! I don't even like peanut butter cookies but had to admit they were addicting!

Excellent recipe, I did add about 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla and about 1/8 cup extra flour. And since I had some extra chocolate chips, I put chips in half of the cookies - just perfect.

We love the flavor of these cookies.  The perfect amount of peanutty yummyness for us.  I made a second batch with chocolate chips.  Hubby and I both thought they were much better without the chocolate chips. In fact, my husband...the world's biggest sweet tooth...complained that they were too sweet, and suggested that I leave out the chips in the future.   For once, I agree with him.   Why mess with excellence?
You can bet these will become a staple at our house.

Made exactly as written, except I didn't have the pan liner, so just used a regular cookie sheet. Also, I jumped the gun and added all the dry ingredients together by accident and then mixed in the PB and egg. They were still delicious.  Saving, as I will make these again!

I use this recipe for semi sugar free cookies for my recently diagnosed diabetic husband. I use 1/2 cup Splenda Brown sugar Blend in place of the brown and white sugar, and I add slightly more flour (2 TBS). The peanut butter is all natural with no added sugar.  I use a 1/8 cup ice cream type scoop to make perfect generous  sized cookies, that come in at around 11 carbs each. He loves them. So glad I tried this recipe when his nutritionist suggested peanut butter cookies. She says the protein in the peanut butter is essential for diabetic diet. I'm the one that always says "Don't change the recipes" but in this case I'm glad I tried it. Love all Chef John's recipes!

I followed the recipe exactly.  GOOD cookies, but I like the Jif Peanut Butter Cookies recipe on this site better.  I was going to make the Jif recipe but I couldn't find butter flavored shortening so I used this recipe because it didn't call for any.   Again, these are GOOD, but not the best.  To be fair, I WAS asked for this recipe which I will give, with credit to Chef John.

This was a great recipe.  I did not put the cookies on the silicone mat because the cookies picked up that flavor.  The cookies did not stick to the ungreased pan.  I will definitely go to this recipe when I want peanut butter cookies.

Excellent peanut butter cookies. Needed to make them smaller and thinner than I expected and cooked longer than ten minutes, I went to twelve minutes to get the level of doneness I wanted.

Really easy cookies to make with standard pantry staples. I used my small cookie scoop and got 45 cookies. I cooked them for 8 minutes and let them cool on the cookie sheet. Crispy outside, but soft and chewy on the inside.

I truly dislike peanut butter cookies, but I made these because my step daughter wanted some. I tried one, and was not just surprised, I was shocked. They turned out absolutely amazing! Crispy, flavorful, not too crunchy (like every other peanut butter cookie I've ever had). I actually like these cookies! Thank you for sharing.

These are perfect!  Excellent peanut butter flavor and are nice and crisp if you bake them about 10 or 11 minutes (which is how we like them)  I just mixed the dough by hand and the cookies had a more crumbly texture than if beating with a mixer.  Perfect batch size for a small family, too.

I used 1/4 C almond butter; 1/4 C peanut butter--both without sugar; I used 3/4 Coconut sugar;  1/4 c coconut flour; 1/4 C buckwheat flour; remainder unbleached flour, which I sifted; small ice cream scoop--made 34 crisp and very delicious cookies.
Thank you for this great recipe!!

I had to make a slight change of Splenda for the sugars (they make a brown sugar type now too). My husband loves these. Splenda dries them out, but my son makes them with real sugar and they are perfect.

We love this recipe and will make many times in the future. We made a few changes. The first change we made is that we put sugar on the fork when we did the criss cross, we also made a double batch because this recipe did not make a lot.

Absolutely delicious! 
However, I had to add 5 extra minutes in the oven to make them a little more golden (I baked them on parchment paper for easy clean up)

I made the first batch just as the recipe said and it was fabulous it hardly lasted 48 hours. I doubled the second batch just like it said except for I put 3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa in it that's pretty good, but not as good as the original.

Taste was good. Used chunky PB instead of creamy since I like the texture more. Cookies ended up thin and very crunchy,  I was hoping for a softer cookie. Changed bake time to 7 mins and still ended up crunchy.

This recipe is perfect. I do prefer more peanut butter so I subbed 1/4 cup of PB with the fancy PB and added an additional 1/4 cup of fancy.

I had to add more flour because the dough was too creamy. I also made it with 3/4 of a cup of peanut butter instead of 1/2 because I wanted a good amount of P.B.

Followed all steps/ingredients - a crowd pleaser of a cookie. My 80 yd old dad loved them just as much as my 11 yr old.  Can’t go wrong w Chef J.   A classic keeper of a recipe

I stuck to the recipe exactly, and the cookies baked up perfectly. I tried adding a few akoma chips to a few balls, in the middle, and they didn't change the way the balls baked up. I think the magic here is mixing the stages up exactly as Chef John describes, to achieve the proper texture and performance from this recipe. I noticed a change in the cohesion of the dough as I continued mixing. When I was finished with the dough, it had a perfect texture, not too sticky, just PERFECT.  The flavor is balanced. I used organic Arrowhead Mills all purpose flour, Wholesome Sweeteners dark brown sugar, organic cane sugar and Once Again smooth  organic peanut butter. GIDDY UP!

They turned out a bit too crumbly for me.  I prefer a creamy on the inside and crispy on the outside.  The overall flavor is very good.

Good peanut butter cookies, with just the right balance of flavors and chewy/crispy texture.  Single batch yielded exactly 3 dozen (although I doubled, as I was baking for a bake sale).  Someone mentioned a grainy texture ... I always refrigerate dough overnight, and then let it come to room temp the next day before baking, and that helps with any grainy texture, as the ingredients get a chance to meld together.

Turned out absolutely beautiful; perfect texture, nice flavor (I added some cinnamon and a tiny bit of almond extract). Soft, pretty, the perfect peanut butter cookie. Definitely recommended.

I added a teaspoon of vanilla. I baked them at 350 for 13 minutes.
The cookies were quite sweet without enough peanut butter flavor.

I didn’t have enough time To refrigerate it for 2 to 3 hours so I put it in the freezer for 40 minutes and it ended up just fine. I also couldn’t get it to stick completely to the pan when doing the crisscross with work so I decided to use special and it made it flat with a little straight through the middle and it looked really cute. They taste amazing and I would definitely do this recipe again my family loved it.

Excellent cookie and easy. I wanted to add oatmeal so I backed off 1/2 cup of the flour and added 1/2 cup oatmeal..added some fiber to it where it seemed a little crunchy. Chef John has NEVER disappointed me. Always search for him first if you want quality.

Mine turned out kind-of dry. Followed the recipe to a T. Might try again, but maybe a little less flour? More PB? We all agreed crunchy PB would be nice in this recipe.

I might have put in just a tiny bit too much flour because they were a little bit dry and crisp for my taste. The next day I put the heel of a loaf of bread in the container and they softened up nicely. I also added a bunch of mini chocolate chips to the dough. I can't say this was the easiest or best recipe for peanut butter cookies I've ever tried.

These were very good, and the texture was perfect.
Although, they were just a little too sweet for my taste. I realized afterward that my peanut butter already had a little sugar in it, I will try to find an unsweetened one if I redo the recipe.

I followed the directions given and these turned out delicious. Very easy to make. However, I found the 10 minutes a bit too long to leave in my oven. Around 8 minutes and they were perfect. Timing may depend on individual ovens.

So far, so good.  I skipped the refrigeration step because I am not that patient or organized. The cookies went flat which I think the refrigeration might help.  I would likely half the white sugar.  But tasty out of the oven.

I thought they came out good, and had no problems with spreading or crumbling. I did use chunky peanut butter, as that is all we ever buy, and did up it to 1cup, and had no issues with anything.

Absolutely easy and fail proof peanut butter cookies! I had a huge Cosco sized tub of smooth peanut butter to use up because we prefer to use chunky style peanut butter for sandwiches instead. I followed Chief John's recipe with exception of the addition of 1/2 teaspoon of pure vanilla extract. All my cookies, cakes and pies have to have vanilla extract. These cookies came out beautifully round, chewy and the peanut butter flavor was not affected by the addition of vanilla but in fact enhanced. Try this recipe its next to nearly impossible to mess these cookies up, UNLESS you overbake them! I think for my gas oven, 375 degrees was a tad too high. I baked mine at 350 degrees for 10 minutes was spot on for my oven. Whatever you decide don't overbake them.

Perfect, easy recipe, cookies have just the right crispy edges, chewy center and not too sweet.  About chilling the dough, I have made it without chilling, with a few hours and up to 24 hours in the fridge.  They  turned out a little different texture but equally yummy!  BTW I add a teaspoon of vanilla just because I like it that way,

Delicious! I added 1 tsp vanilla. Made for one of my Christmas baking marathon cookies, I was so tired by the time I got to this recipe that I forgot to cover the dough in plastic to chill. My bad! It got dried out on the top but I dampened my hands per Chef John and rolled the dough in small balls and all was right with the world. I also dipped the tines of the fork in sugar to form the crisscross pattern. Out of all the other recipes that I tried this was the best along with the 7 layer cookie bar recipe  from this site.

Liked the recipe. Any good cook knows recipes are more of a guide. If you know what you like you tweek it a little. I used more PB and flour. And used salted butter. These 3 little changes made a difference with flavor and texture.

I follow the recipe exactly, because it was my 1st time making this recipe.   These peanutbutter cookies had a very weak flavor and baked very thin.  I disliked them so much I threw the whole batch in the garbage.

My family liked them a lot. We'll make again. Had more flavor the next day. We made variations to the recipe. Used ingredients found in the cupboards. Used regular butter (not salted), used raw cane sugar (instead of white), omitted the kosher salt since the peanut butter was salted, used chunky peanut butter instead of smooth, used dark brown sugar. Recipe yielded 2 dozen and tried to use damp hands but that created a bit of a mess. Also, I used a regular baking sheet.

I made these tonight.  I followed the recipe, without changes, except, I by accident, I added a teaspoon of vanilla.  I was adding the sugars, butter, peanut butter, and without thinking, added the vanilla.. I was very concerned, thinking they wouldn't come out as most the reviewers stated.  They were wonderful.  Next time, I will pay more attention, and try without the vanilla.  Thanks Chef John.

I loved how soft and chewy the cookies were and that they were all perfectly round and symmetrical. They tasted great too! I really liked how simple this recipe was.

I was craving peanut butter cookies, and these hit the spot. I  made the recipe as written. The only step I didn't do was let the cookie dough rest for 2-3 hours. They were still fantastic. Next time I'll add pecan and chocolate chips.

These were really great.  I used margarine as that's what I had at the time ,  and added more flour until I got the consistency that the video showed.  They came out great. The  texture was absolutely perfect. :) Thanks for this awesome recipe.

These are the best peanut butter cookies ever. The only thing I changed was I didn't put the baking powder in because I didn't have any so instead of 1/2 a teaspoon of baking soda I used 1 teaspoon and they came out fantastic.

Amazing recipe! I had a favorite for years. Could find the recipe...I altered this just a tad by adding 1/4-1/2 tsp cinnamon! Tastes even better than the recipe I used to go by! ??

Awesome cookies, made them exactly per recipe except only half the dough made it into the fridge because I couldn't wait. The refrigerated ones were a tad better but not enough of a difference to keep me from making at least one batch right away!!

Grainy texture was surprising. I didn't think it was tasted very peanut-y or sweet. I think 10 minutes at 375 was too long and too hot. After the first pan came out, I turned down the heat to 360 and baked for a little less than 10 minutes.

Excellent recipe!  I made these cookies for a friend, and she thinks they are the best peanut butter cookies she has ever tasted.  I doubled the recipe and followed the directions, but used the super chunky peanut butter.  Absolutely perfect as always, Chef John.

I’ve made these a couple of times before, once with sugar and twice with Splenda. That and using regular salt rather than kosher, because that was what I had, are the only changes I ever made. I think these are the best peanut butter cookies I have ever had. I think they are neither too dry or too moist. The amount of sweetness is just right for my taste and while I definitely get that peanut butter taste it is not overpowering either. I think it is just right!

It doesn't taste strongly enough of peanut butter for me. It tastes more like butter. I doubled the recipe and used a small cookie scoop. It made 55-60 cookies. I also creamed the butter and sugar for a minute or so before I added the peanut butter and the rest as directed. If I make it again, I will either add powdered peanut butter in place of some flour or just add more peanut butter.

I have made several of Chef Johns recipes including buttermilk biscuits and hamburger buns. However, the first time I made these cookies, something went wrong.  Came out way to dry and crumbly.  Don't know what happened.  So, I scrapped the dough and started over.  This time I omitted the baking powder and added a 1/4 cup more peanut butter and flour.  375 for 10 minutes, and they came out with browned bottoms and chewy moist centers.  Great.  Was it me or the recipe?  Dunno.

By adding an additional 1/4 cup of flour, I avoided chill time. Cookies are amazing and a favorite of my family and friends!

The most delicious peanut butter cookies I ever made. Hats off to you, Chef! I have to make 4 recipes at a time for my husband to take to work and they don't last the day! Just FYI, crunchy peanut butter works as well. I only use the natural butters, so there's no extra sugar or unhealthy additives. But caution - these can be addictive!!

Perfect and super easy PB cookie recipe!  I sprinkled a little sugar on top of them before baking. Cook 10 min if you prefer them chewy and soft, 12 if you like them with more of a crunch. Perfection!!!

Turned out perfect. I added cinnamon and vanilla. Very easy to make and easy to memorize with most ingredients using 1/2 cup or tsp,  I baked 8 minutes in convection. 10 just made them a bit more crispy. Not too sweet. I also dipped my spoon into sugar prior to each hash mark. Recipe could easily be doubled for larger batch. This was perfect for 2 of us with plenty to share.

I found these cookies really hard to bake - because I couldn't stop eating the dough! Seriously, these are cookie dough perfection. When I finally persuaded myself to actually put some in the oven, I was equally happy with the baked results. A nice, chewy cookie with a great sweet & salty flavor.
I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing.

These cookies are great! I am a peanut butter person, but only in certain dishes. I am glad these cookies were not loaded with peanut butter as most recipes. Jif creamy peanut butter is the best for these cookies. Great with milk! :)

The cookies were hard. But I used an old time trick to make them soft, put a piece of bread in with the cookies and seal tight. In a coupe days the cookies will be soft. This was passed down from my grandmother. Works with brown sugar too.

Hmm... I tried to make these with Splenda instead of sugar, and Brummel and Brown instead of butter. Also used lower fat peanut butter. Everything else was to the recipe specs. Those substitutions usually work out well for me. I didn't want a big batch, so I halved the recipe.  The cookies turned out too cake-like. My fault...trying to save calories. Lesson learned.  :(

These are great as is.  The flavor is spot on and they are nice and soft.  I would recommend doubling the recipe if you have teenagers though :)  (If you like crispy, you can always bake an extra minute or two.)

These are exactly what I want in a peanut butter cookie - chewy and crisp at the same time. I followed the recipe exactly, the need to refrigerate the dough is essential so plan ahead. Upon removing from the oven, I pressed a chocolate kiss or a M&M in the center. I can also see rolling the cookie dough ball in sugar before impressing with the fork.

My dad who loves peanut butter cookies but never gets them at home (my mom hates peanut butter) loved these. I used an unsweetened, unsalted peanut butter because it's what I had, and I think I wouldn't do that again. They were fine, but a bit more salty sweetness would have probably gone a long way.

These were good, came out soft, chewy but crispy outsides. Not as much peanut butter flavour as I expected, I used all natural unsalted peanut butter. Next time I'll try adding cinnamon and extra salt to see if that enhances the flavor. But overall, a great cookie!

These are super easy to make and have great peanut butter flavor. I'm not usually a big fan of peanut butter cookies, but I'm about to move, so the kitchen is a disaster zone. I do think they need a little bit of spice, just to give them more kick. As they are, the rich, strong peanut butter flavor makes them a little TOO "earthy". There's no beating the texture, though.

Thanks, Chef John! :-)

Perhaps if the cookies were eaten earlier, they wouldn't have been so crunchy. The crunchy cookies are my only big complaint.

Oh my, so good! The only change I made was to use spelt flour instead of a/p. I do this with all the cookies I bake, because spelt lends such a wonderfully nutty flavor that a/p just can't compete with.

I noticed that there were a few reviewers who felt that these weren't peanut buttery enough. And that is what made me want to try them; I prefer a more subtle PB taste ;)

These are the best cookies I have ever made! Delicious, soft, tasty! I baked them on a baking stone.
