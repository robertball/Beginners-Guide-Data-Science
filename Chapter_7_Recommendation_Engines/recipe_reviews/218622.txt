Exceptionally good zucchini cake.   I used both green and yellow zucchini and put the chips on top.  Very good.

Good recipe as written.  Made this yesterday, and even tho I lacked the choc chips and my measurements weren't spot-on, it came out great.  Pressed and squeezed the moisture from my zucchini very well before using.  Made it into two 8X8 pans so I could share it and the amount worked fine. Hubby and I had it with some Turkey Hill special chocolate flavor ice cream - Yum!

Really good. I did increase the cocoa powder by 50%, used far less chocolate chips (a full cup was way too much for me, and next time I might use mini chocolate chips instead) and replaced both the oil and butter with unsweetened applesauce, and it turned out delicious and moist! Very satisfying for chocoholic health nuts like me. :) And a great way to sneak in a little extra veggie intake! I'm not sure why one reviewer squeezed the moisture out of his/her zucchini, because generally when you bake with zucchini the idea is that the vegetable provides some necessary moisture to the finished product so you DON'T want to press it...but I guess it depends on your moisture preference. I would recommend not squeezing your zucchini though, whether you're making this recipe or brownies or zucchini bread, but then again I love moist cakes/brownies/breads!

If you love chocolate, you'll love this cake.  As one reviewer wrote, the cake is very dense, but that's how I like my chocolate baked goods.  If you want it to be more like the molten lava cakes, put more chocolate chips.  I did also wring the excess water out of the zucchini.

Delicious. I used applesauce for the oil but otherwise followed the recipe to a T. I did NOT squeeze out the moisture in the zucchini and came out perfectly moist and fluffy.

Moist delicious cake.  Made with all butter, since had no oil, and it was great.  Added chips to the cake, as did many others, and sprinkled atop as well.  As for the comments about this being a dense cake.... no kidding.  The water from the zucchini makes it extremely moist and ALL zucchini cakes will be like this.  This is not a light fluffy cake and will never be.  Take this into mind if you are expecting a sponge or light cake. Also, do not drain or squeeze out the zucchini.  This water is needed for moisture.  I've also added more than the recipe calls for (grated extra because of the size of the zucchini) and it doesn't hurt a thing.  This is delicious.

This recipe is a classic that my mom made regularly when I was young.  I made it exactly as written with the small addition of 1tsp of cinnamon and 1/2tsp of cloves which is what my mother used to add and I threw the chocolate chips on top of the cake just before I put it in the oven.  Love this recipe!

Really moist, loved the texture-fluffy, moist, not doughy. Just the right amount of chocolate and not overly sweet. However I think it needs just a pinch of salt. Next time I make this I'll try adding 1/2 tsp of salt to the batter.

This cake is fantastic with the recipe as written. I shredded the zucchini on the small shred side of my box shredder and it completely disappear into the cake while it baked. My 6 year old daughter heard there was zucchini in it, didn't want to have anything to do with it, but asked for another piece after she tried it. My 9 year old talked about how he loved the texture - the top was a bit crunchy and the inside was so soft. This recipe is a keeper!

This is SO good. I just had a piece while it was still warm. The inside is moist and soft and the outside is slightly crunchy with the chocolate chips. I used 1/2 vanilla and 1/2 semi-sweet chocolate chips. I ate 2 pieces and will have to work extra hard at the gym tomorrow! I tried to console myself with the fact that there is zucchini in it! Great recipe that I will make again.

This was so good!  The whole family loved it, and had no clue that there was any zucchini in it.  We followed the directions exactly.  It reminded us of Chili's Molten Cake.  Perfectly done!! Will make again.

I loved the fact that the chocolate disguises the zucchini. Although I am a huge chocolate lover, the next time I will cut the chocolate chips down. The cake is so moist and full of chocolate flavor  that the chocolate chips made some areas of cake too "moist", like big area of melted chips. I think adding nuts to this would be a good idea.

I made this exactly as directed. After shredding the zucchini, I left it in a colander in the fridge to drain for about an hour. The cake was light and delicious!

I will make it over and over.  Not your typical way to use 
zucchini.  It was  awesome, moist and delicious.  I used semi-
sweet chocolate chips. All the ladies at my luncheon requested

This cake is amazing. The zucchini does act like a moistening agent, so do not squeeze the moisture out of it. I did core some seeds out of it. The recipe as it is is moist and chocolaty. It was perfect for my boyfriend!

This recipe is so, so delicious. I make it every year for my parent's birthdays and it never disappoints. If possible I try to throw together last minute so we can eat straight out of the oven with vanilla ice cream- it's HEAVEN. Also great as leftovers but nothing like warm out of the oven. I don't change a thing from the recipe, but will sometimes add a bit more chocolate chips because it's chocolate :) Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

It was moist and yummy.  I added a topping of toasted pecans and drizzled homemade caramel over it.  I think I also added pecans to the cake batter.  I didn't get to taste the finish product because it sold out at the church bake sale.

Sorry, but the pic was better than the cake. This was way too dry, falls apart when you try to cut it. Top with the chocolate chips was good but the cake needs some work.

So light and fluffy!  Kids loved it with the yummy chocolate. Would you believe that they preferred this to leftover birthday cake from a friend’s party? Wooo hoo!

I also doubled the cocoa and added extra zucchini. I haven't ever squeezed the zucchini either, I like the moisture it provides to the cake. This is the best chocolate cake ever. I got this recipe years ago before the internet existed.  I'd much rather have this cake over any other chocolate cake recipe. Yum!

Good recipe! Nice and moist. I leave a little but it the liquid from the zucchini rather than draining it all. I also mix the chocolate chips into the batter as well as put a few on top. It makes the cake a little gooey!

It didn't hold together very well, and I think next time I'll mix the chips throughout. Maybe play with the ratios of powder and vanilla some. Attempt two: one extra tbsp of cocoa righted the flavor, chocolate chips mixed throughout tasted better but a sprinkle on the top would look prettier. Used slightly less then a 1/2 cup oil and it held together worse. Next time I want to try half brown sugar.

A luscious and moist chocolate cake and my kids had no clue there was zucchini in it!  I squeezed excess moisture out of the zucchini, increased the cocoa to 1/2 cup, added a tsp of salt  and adjusted the method to alternate adding wet and dry ingredients to the creamed mixture.  I will definitely make it again.

If I could give ten stars I would! As one reviewer suggested, I left my chocolate chips on top and did not use a full cup - it hardly needs the extra sweetness. Other than that I followed this exactly and was pleasantly surprised by how addicting these were! If you've got zucchini, this is definitely worth the effort!

This was very good and moist!  I made it exactly as written with the exception of using gluten free flour (King Arthur brand).  I also used a mix of semisweet and dark chocolate chips on the top.  Did not need frosting.

This is amazing! Just like my aunt used to make. I made it in a Bundt pan and it held up well. First piece was eaten while still warm and OMG! My son loved it but I made the mistake of telling him it had zucchini in it. Excellent cake!

This is a very dense, moist, and delicious chocolate cake. This will be our go to recipe during zucchini season and beyond. Along with the semi-sweet choc. chips-3/4 cup, I had also added a 1/2 cup of white chocolate chips, and used applesauce in place of the oil. Wow! So good. This cake is good without frosting, with frosting, and my favorite, heated up then topped off with choc. chip ice cream. Yum!

I made half of this recipe in an 8” springform pan.  I used zucchini I had in the freezer and I had leftover buttermilk, so I used that instead of the milk and vinegar.  My version baked for 36 minutes.  Great way to use zucchini!

Oops, I got distracted and put all the chips in the batter, my bad.  But the results were fabulous.  I baked two 9-inch cake pans for 35 minutes.  To hide the lack of chips on the top, I sprinkled with powered sugar.  Everyone raved and raved!  Thanks H Sankey!

Followed the directions. But still mooshy even after soaking up all the moisture from the zucchini. My husband said it tasted like Mexican corn. It was to much chocolate. I won't be making this again. But thanks, it was a good experience.

Delicious, moist. Tried it in a bundt pan, but it didn't come out perfectly so will probably use 9x 13 next time. I used dried buttermilk instead of souring the milk and it worked well.
