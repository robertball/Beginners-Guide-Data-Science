These were DELICIOUS!!!! The best green bean recipe ever! I didn't have garlic chili sauce, only a popular brand chili sauce and it was still delicious. I added an extra clove of garlic to try to compensate. I used olive oil instead of canola, and I skipped steaming them. My husband and I like our green beans on the crunchier side, so I just cooked them in the skillet with the oil and garlic, then when they were about done added the rest of the mixture. I cooked for maybe 2 minutes more and it was perfect!

8 19 05 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/74350/sweet-and-spicy-green-beans/ ... The chili sauce in this recipe is not the flavor of spiced-up ketchup or a bowl of chili.  It's the ORIENTAL sauce in a jar:  chili garlic sauce.  I didn't have any, but it was still pretty good.  Not spicy at all, but that's to be expected.  I'll try this one again with all the ingredients.  (WOW, I can add to this review weeks later!  :D)  Got the right ingredient - chili garlic sauce - & it is very good.  This is one we'll use over & over.  My three stars earlier is now four & a half.  What the heck, I'll give it a five.  This one's good.

5+ I served it for dinner and we liked it.  I had made quite a bit since we love green beans. The next day I took the leftovers out and tasted it while it was cold.  I loved it!!!  I served it that way to our company and they loved it too and wanted the recipe. I am planning to make a tray of it and serve it cold as part of the appetizers for the next cookout. You can't go wrong with this recipe - either warm or cold! Thanks submitter.

this recipe is easy and quick, yet tastes incredible. i also use it on asparagus tips nad it is just as good as with the beans. i have 1 variation and 1 suggestion. variation: i had no garlic chili sauce, so i substitute the sauce with equal portions if garlic powder and chili powder, and the difference is scarce, if any. suggestion: don't let most of the sauce evaporate, if you like having sauce, it's just something simple to add right before you serve or to serve as a gravy on the side that can be added to other menu items. the recipe makes plenty of liquid sauce that you don't have to cook the beans until it evaporates.

This is so easy & tastes great! I made it once and was hooked.I like it more spicy so I use a tablespoon of the chili sauce and add more garlic.
I have also used frozen whole green beans when the fresh ones are out of season or too expensive and they work well too. If I use frozen ones, I put them right into the fry pan and start on low.

It was good but there was something missing, a depth or fullness in the flavor.  That was easily fixed with a tablespoon of sesame oil with the canola oil, which you can really replace with any oil, and a teaspoon of oyster sauce in the soy mixture.  Then this recipe was out of this world.  I had it with an asian marinated steak, which I love,and I liked this even better.  I was mopping up the leftover sauce with the steak to get the rest of the flavor.  I also added onions and red peppers.  I made the full recipe, was eating alone and there were no leftovers of the veggies but there was of the steak.  You can really do this with any veggies.  Next I plan to make an asian chicken scampi out of this.  I've never been a major veggie fan, always having been a meat eater.  This recipe has changed that.  I'll be trying this will all sorts of veggies, meats, chicken and pasta.  Try it out for yourself and you'll agree.  I had to add this.  I'm loving this sauce and using it so much I make it in larger batches, putting it in a jar and spooning it out as needed so I don't have to keep making all the time.  Tonight I sauted some onions and red peppers in it and had it on my turkey sandwich.  Absolutely amazing.

This sauce is absolutely wonderful. I've made it for all kinds of veggies! (Green beans, asparagus, green peppers etc.) Last night I had left over egg noodles so I cut up some green pepper and carrots and tripled this sauce and cooked it together. Wow - what an awesome side. You can't go wrong making this.

This is so good! I thought the  garlic chili sauce was just another ingredient to turn something hot & spicy. Boy, was I wrong, again!  The seasoning ingredients,  blended together were just so flavorful mixed in with the fresh green beans. This is a very special find here on allrecipes and one that will be enjoyed often.

This recipe was awesome!  I made it to go with some BBQ ribs.  After making the sauce, it didn't look like much, so I doubled it.  I don't think that was necessary however.  It probably would have been just as good as the recipe stated.  I'm just a sauce-crazy person!

Loved this recipe!  It was quick and really tasty.  I added about 2 TBS. of yellow onion, 1 TBS. distilled white vinegar, 2 tsp. of chili flakes and 1/4 tsp. of white sugar. I didn't have the "garlic chili sauce" at home so that's where the vinegar, chili flakes & sugar came from.  Definitely a keeper recipe!!

Made this tonight for dinner. I've been searching for something like the Szechuan style green beans in get the Asian fusion restaurants here in Minneapolis. This one just about hit the nail right on the head. It was not as spicy as I'd like, I like SPICY foods so I'll probably add a quarter teaspoon of crushed red pepper flakes but I loved the salty, spicy, sweet taste of the recipe. It was really outstanding and easy to make. 

If you do it, don't bother steaming the beans, it's a total waste of time. Just sauté them with a little canola oil, a light sprinkle of salt and Black pepper, and add your sauce mixture at the end. This was my first time sautéing green beans and I overcooked them a bit. Just remember it takes a few minutes foe the sauce to reduce and there's quite a bit of steam while it does which accelerates the cooking of the beans. Put the sauce in a little earlier than you think.

Okay - my 9-yr-old daughter HATES green beans... she will have nothing to do with them!  I had her help me make these green beans and she thought the sauce smelled SO good that she actually wanted to try them.  She LOVED these green beans - and so did the rest of our family!  I made a bunch, and every last bean was eaten up.  Thank you for such a wonderful recipe!!

Everyone I have made this for has instantly fallen in love with it! I usually slightly-less-than-double the sauce in relation to the green beans because I really like strong, bold flavors. Letting the liquid evaporate at the end is really important to get the full flavor--watch for the soy sauce mixture to start to look a little syrupy when it bubbles.

Oh, my goodness! This is so delightful! I couldn't belive all the flavor that this recipe adds to green beans. I did a few things different. I used frozen green beans (which worked well because it helped add more liquid so the beans could almost boil in the sauce). I LOVE garlic so I added a bit more minced garlic, some garlic salt and garlic powder. I let the beans boil in the juices a bit and it was AMAZING! I'm sure it would be just as amazing when followed exactly.

I loved these!  I used frozen french cut green beans and had to sub 1 tsp of chili powder and 1 tsp of garlic powder (w/a 1 1/4 lb bag of beans) for the garlic chili sauce as I wasn't able to find any at my local grocery store in a rush!  I will use this recipe over and over and over again!  I did not steam the beans, simply sauteed in the oil and then added the sauce.  THANKS for an awesome veggie side dish!

These are great! I've made them 4 times in the past week. I double the amount of garlic and I add about 1/4 tsp. sesame seed oil and I garnish with some sesame seeds. Try it, you'll be happy you did!

Tasty.  I made them as written except that, instead of steaming, I just dropped them in boiling water for thirty seconds before cooking them in the garlic and chili sauce.  Yum.

Great recipe and simple to make.  Just don't pre-cook the beans!   Over-cooked veggies are a travesty.  Leave some snap (and vitamins) by going straight from fresh (or even frozen) directly to the skillet.

The first time I made this as a side dish, my husband RAVED about it. I followed the recipe mostly, but subbed agave nectar for the honey (vegan) and used sesame oil instead of canola. I also added pine nuts to add some nutty texture. The second time I made it as a main stir fry. I tripled the recipe, added 1 scallion to the sauce, stir fried some bok Choy, green pepper, green beans, and brocolli, and then served over Asian noodles with coarse chopped almonds on top. Hubby loved it! He usually adds some extra chili sauce (siracha) to his.

What a great recipe! I fry the beans in sesame oil for a more authentic Asian flavor and since I can't ever find garlic chili paste, I just use a szechuan sauce I can always find in the international aisle of the supermarket. We'll make these beans again and again!

This was a great recipe.  My husband and I both liked it and I don't usually care for green beans.

We all loved it!  We did not have garlic chili, So we minced 3 cloves of garlic and mixed it in with sweet chili sauce.  We also did not steam the beans,we sauted them for 8 minutes with just olive oil then added the sauce and sauted another 5 minutes or so...YUM!

Wowza!  Very awesome!  Very spicy, but probably because I added red pepper flakes.  I also used someones suggestion of adding a dash of sugar and a tablespoon of vinegar.  Thank you!!!!

Really good green beans!  Definitely the best recipe I've made with them if not the best I've ever tried.  I used more honey then called for and regular chili pepper sauce with just extra garlic.  I had these as a side with with turkey meatloaf and was dipping forkfulls of meatloaf in the sauce.  Glad I found this and will be making again and again!

Fabulous Fabulous! Play around with your seasoning.  The trick is to stir like crazy while the sauce reduces so that it sticks to your beans.  Family raved!
UPDATE: I can not make enough of these to have leftovers!!  The crowd goes CRAZY!!

These are just like the ones my mom makes. She uses different ingredients and hers is more complicated, however, they taste the same. The garlic chili sauce looks like a jar of chopped and pureed red peppers.

Wow, these were simple and good.  I made them twice and the second time, because I wanted a little less Asian flair, I added some Worcestershire sauce to it, which makes it the perfect addition to a Southern/Cajun themed meal also.  Definitely a keeper.

Everyone loved them for Thanksgiving.  I used Braggs amino acids instead of soy sauce.  No chili sauce, used garlic and red pepper flakes.

A tasty change from the plain old cooked green bean. I used straight chili paste which I'm guessing is hotter than the garlic chili. I will add a little less next time. Didn't pre-cook the green beans. They turned out great!

My husband isn't a real fan of fresh green beans (which I love).  While we were eating this at dinner, he looked at me and said, "this is how to eat green beans!"  Loved it and saved it.  Would definitely make again.

Delicious! I steamed the beans a few hours earlier so I could just toss them into the pan and stir fry right before dinner was served. They were burn-your-lips spicy, which I love, but made them inedible for my boyfriend. Whoops! Oh well, more for me.

Delicious! Careful - depending on your chili sauce, this could get pretty spicy!

Also, you can use the sauce for other vegetables. For instance, last night I made Sweet and Spicy Kale.

We had this today with our roasted ribeye and it was amazing! We added extra garlic, some purple onion, and sliced jalapeno. We did not steam, but instead just sauteed it in the sauce. I put it on low for about 10 minutes and let it simmer together. We loved the entire meal. Thanks!

I am not a fan of green beans but I'd eat them all the time cooked like this. DELICIOUS! I omitted the garlic, used slightly less sriracha and slightly more honey so it wouldn't be too spicy for kids. Thanks for sharing this.

The whole family loved it. The only change I made was to boil the beans for a few minutes and then added them to the skillet. I may try this with other types of beans - should be awesome as well.

What a terrrific green bean recipe.  Loved the mild heat.  I had a 15 oz can of whole green beans and needed a quick weeknight side, and this fit the bill.  Made as written, but obviously no need to par boil canned.  Can't wait to make this with fresh green beans.  Thanks for sharing your recipe with AR, a definite do-over and over! Added 8/4/13:  made with fresh green beans, so good.  Just sauteed in EVOO, no par boil necessary.  I added a splash of rice wine vinegar to the mix, too!  YUM!

These green beans are awesome! They have a great flavor which resembles that of Asian cuisine. I subbed 1/2 tsp. garlic powder and 1/2 tsp. chili powder for the sauce and it worked great. Thank you for the fresh, great recipe!

I thoiught these were great, love the Asian flair...would pair wonderfully w an Asian meal. I accidentally had some snow peas in my string beans and I thought the snow peas worked even better for this recipe. My family was mixed on this though bc they prefer "Country Green Beans" also on this site.

These were the best I ever made, and sooo easy! I used frozen green beans slightly thawed, adding some onion to them I used olive oil and a small amount of butter. No chili sauce, so  added a dash of cayenne pepper for some spicyness. These are GREAT!!!

Good enough for a side dish but very spicy. We like spicy food in my family but the garlic chili sauce I used must have been too hot for this recipe. I had to add twice as much honey. All we could taste was the chili not the honey. I suggest using half the chili sauce.

This was absolutely delicious for my huband too. I cooked it with sesame oil and a bit of sesame seeds. Served them with rice and steemed fish both with a bit of soja souce. Next time I will mix all the three ingredients when everything is almost  cooked. Loved it.

I had to modify this (no garlic chili sauce) and it was still good.  2 T dehydrated garlic, 1 T red pepper flakes and about 1 t rice vinegar.  I liked it cold.  Will definitely make again.

This is our new favorite recipe for green beans like P.F. Chang's. I used sesame oil because I love it so much. I wish I could think of a way to make the sauce stick to the beans, though! Thanks for the recipe!

These were delicious.  I only had sweet chili sauce, not garlic chili sauce, so I skipped the honey and added garlic. 

I microwaved the green beans for 3 minutes (covered) rather than steaming.  Very simple and tasty recipe.

Well, I had to sub the garlic chili sauce for chili paste instead, since that's all I had. It was a HUGE hit(altho spicy:) Can't wait to try it as written too, if the family will let me-they loved it!!

Delicious!  Make an entire meal out of it by adding 1 lb of fresh shrimp.  In a second bowl, mix two cloves of minced garlic and two tablespoons of olive oil, add shrimp, stir, cover and set aside.  Double the sauce recipe and follow the recipe instructions.  When sauce has reduced by half, add shrimp and stir fry until cooked through (about 10 minutes).  Serve over green beans.

Oh my god - these were so good!  And I'm not even a big fan of green beans!  I couldn't find my steamer device, so I just put them in a covered dish in the microwave with a little water and cooked for 3 minutes.  And I didn't have any honey, so I used a little corn syrup.  But otherwise I followed the recipe, and the green beans were awesome!

Excellent recipe - Instead of steaming I microwaved some thawed beans we froze last fall and followed the recipe from there. Thanks so much, we'll have this again and again.

This was great! A hit at this house!  Some pepper steak was made for supper last night and today I fixed this for a side and wow! Only thing I did different was, I used two cans of green beans. The store didn't have any fresh;  and to be honest I really don't like green beans much but these! I'll make this again.

Nice green beans.  Bf's only complaint was it was a bit too salty--must be the soy sauce, I suppose, as it doesn't call for extra salt and I didn't add any.  Very quick and easy, and I love green beans so it was a good side dish to go with chicken tonight.  Thanks for the recipe!

Although not the prettiest entrant in the green bean parade, these are certainly very tasty.  I used low sodium soy sauce and found that the combination of sweet and spicy flavors was a nice complement to grilled pork chops.  This quick and easy veggie would be nice for entertaining because the green beans could be prepared ahead of time, the sauce added when you are ready to serve, and in two minutes or so they are good to go.

5+ Stars -- This recipe is AWESOME!  I modified it just a bit, doing as others did.  I didn't steam the beans first, I just sauteed them in a little bit of olive oil first (approx. 4 minutes), added the other ingrediants as directed and sauteed them for an additional 4 minutes or so (we like our beans a bit on the crunchy side).  I also added a bit more of the garlic chili sauce for more "heat".  Even my son (who strongly dislikes green beans) LOVED them.  I'll make these again for sure.

We quite enjoyed this dish.  I also did not feel the need to steam the beans first - just added them to hot oil, stir fried, and when almost cooked enough for us, added everything else.  I wouldn't hesitate to serve this to company.

Sweet & Spicy Green Beans Haiku: "Used frozen green beans, but I wish that I'd had fresh. Didn't steam either." Just plopped my frozen green beans into the heated skillet for enough time to warm them through til al dente. Used Sriracha sauce for the chili-garlic sauce - such an easy, delicious side dish! What sauce that remained the pan tasted really great dribbled onto rice w/ dinner.

My family loved this recipe! Make sure that you get the right chile sauce though. It's in the asian aisle. It's a red sauce in a clear plastic jar, with a rooster on it.
I thought that it was a bit hard to taste the sauce, but everyone else raved over it! Will be making it again!

The sauce is delicious. I substituted garlic powder and chili power because I didn't have chili sauce and it still tasted great. I eat this dish over rice.

Instead of garlic chili sauce I used sriracha. I also added a teaspoon of cornstarch to the sauce. It was great. 

I'd recommend making this in a wok instead of a skillet.

I used siracha as my chili sauce, and it was just a tad overpowering. Next time I think I'll try 3/4 the amount of chili sauce, but overall it was a great recipe! Would be great with broccoli too.

I made this as a side dish with some baked tilapia and it totally overshadowed the main dish. This packs a lot of flavor in a small package, and is very easy to make. I am looking forward to trying this sauce on other vegetables.

Very good - added a little red onion for a little more kick.  Zapped them in the microwave for 2 minutes before placing then in the skillet with the soy sauce mixture.

Husband and I loved it. I think next time we'll bump up the garlic chili sauce a bit. This would be equally delicious made with asparagus. Husband says he thinks it would be a good treatment for kale, too.

Made this as a side dish for supper tonight and it got gobbled up!  Did not have garlic chili sauce so used Heinz Chili Sauce with a teaspoon of garlic powder mixed in, as per other reviewers' advice.  Thank you for posting.

This recipe is fantastic.  The one thing I'd suggest is adding a few drops of sesame oil--it helps to bring out the Asian side of the dish.

This was really good!! I used sesame oil instead of canola oil and I didn't have garlic powder so I used fresh chopped garlic. Definitely making this again.

I made this recipe using a bag of frozen green beans from Trader Joes - I didn't even defrost them, I just sauteed them a few minutes longer. I didn't have the chili sauce on hand so I used Sriracha and added an extra garlic clove. I like that you can easily adjust the heat and sweetness of this recipe by adding more hot sauce or honey. I served this as part of an asian style meal and it was a big hit, with the adults and the kids as well (I toned down the heat). I will definitely make this recipe again and would say that you could easily make this a main dish by adding chicken, shrimp, tofu, etc.  The one thing that I did find is that it was ever so slightly salty to me so I would use a tad bit less soy sauce the next time.

In the last few years I have fallen in love with green beans. I am over the hill for this recipe! Green beans were plentiful in our garden this summer and this recipe will be at the top! I made it just as written. I'm not sure what could have caused the reviewer to think it was bitter.? I would have added a photo but before I knew it they were all gone!

Best side dish recipe I've ever tried! I make these all the time, and every time I do, they are an absolute hit! Don't try and substitute the chili garlic sauce-it is the KEY ingredient in these!

I made this tonight and it was a huge hit.  I did reduce the amount of honey by half and used tamarin in lieu or soy sauce as we cook gluten-free.  I will definitely be cooking this again!

Yowza.  These were awesome.  My only sadness is that I didn't make more of them, such that I had leftovers.  They were punchy, crisp, and deep with flavor.  I didn't have fresh garlic so I used garlic powder, and I didn't bother with the steaming, but otherwise followed it exactly.  Cannot wait to make this again!

I doubled the sauce and used it on 2 pounds of beans and it was very tasty not like I needed more sauce.  I didn't have garlic chilli sauce so I added additional clove of garlic and used Thai  style chilli sauce the flavor was great! Plan on making this again and again.

This was so incredibly delicious! We used sriracha in place of the garlic chili sauce, and doubled the amount of garlic to compensate. I typically cook with garlic and hot sauce, but the honey adds so much to this dish, and I would have never thought to add it. I can't wait to try this with asparagus! Actually, I could probably eat this sauce on just about anything! Thanks for the great recipe!

WOW!! These are awesome. I followed the recipe with the exception of adding freshly grated ginger and sesame seeds to the soy sauce mixture. These were over the top delicious. I don't think we will be eating green beans the plain old way again.

Brilliant, nothing to add. I used chopped yellow fin tuna steaks, and I did serve it over mixed greens as a salad with toasted pine nuts as previously suggested.

Very yummy! I made the recipe mostly as is, but added some red onion when I sauteed the beans in EVOO and added a tablespoon of hoisin to the dressing. A little water added with the dressing allowed me to reduce it down a little longer in the pan while plating the rest of the meal. Will absolutely do this again.

These are my favorite green beans ever!  I didn't have any of the garlic Sriracha so I just used regular Sriracha and added a little extra garlic.  I made these as written the first time and I loved them, but have also made variations that are delicious as well.  I like to add matchstick carrots and strips of red bell pepper to the saute pan and saute a few minutes before adding the steamed green beans & sauce.  Also, sometimes I double the sauce and just serve the veggies over rice.  This is definitely a winner.

Wow, I don't think I've had better tasting green beans! I had already started making this when I realized I didn't have honey and so used agave, and was out of garlic chili sauce (dang!) so I subbed Patak's mild curry paste. It's the closest thing I had!  I added some minced garlic to compensate and couldn't resist adding some fresh minced ginger that I happened to have. It may sound like I made a lot of changes but I think it's essentially pretty close in flavor to the recipe: sweet, spicy, garlicky. In any case, I can't wait to make this again. It was divine!

Yum! These are sweet and spicy and delicious all over. Next time I would steam my green beans a little longer because I like 'em soft and steamy and not quite as crunchy as they turned out. I added almonds because I'm a nut (in a good way).

Absolutely delicious. I bought garlic chili sauce a couple months ago for a recipe I saw somewhere. It may have been this one. As soon as I opened the jar the floodgates in my mouth opened. I couldn't wait to try these and they didn't disappoint. I bet this sauce would work well on chicken or pork too!

Okay, so I sent my daughter to the grocer and told her to get me two bags of frozen green beans. well, she brought home 2 bags of fresh green beans.  Knowing my two younger kids are picky I knew they would discern a difference in taste and texture with the fresh so i put off cooking the fresh green beans until tonight. Let me tell you I was surprised my 7 and 10 year old ravished these beans right out of the serving bowl before dinner.  I kept my beans long and modified the recipe slightly using butter instead of oil, lite soy sauce and more or less of other ingredients.  My whole family enjoyed this recipe and i can't wait to cook these for a church event.  
P.s. i used the left over sauce for baked chicken and it was oh so good.  I will incorporate this sauce for other dishes as well.

These were good. I did not have garlic chili sauce so I substituted Louisiana Gold Hot Sauce with some added minced garlic. I will definably be making this again for dinner.

I thought these were great!  I doubled up on my sauce, added just a little bit of crushed red pepper flake and a tiny bit of toasted sesame seed (more to make it pretty than anything else) and we loved it.  Had enough sauce that I could put a bit of it on my rice also.  Thanks for sharing!

Very nice variation on the classic green bean side dish with so little effort! By mistake, I added the oil to the mixture of ingredients and had to dump it all in the skillet and fry the green beans together-it still was excellent and appreciated by my guests.

What can I say?...WOW...made this recipe twice in a week(for 2 of us), and doubled the 2nd time..went very well with an italian dinner as well as a stir fry..2nd time added sliced almonds which gave it just a little extra flavor...shared this recipe with all family members and 2 have already made it..this will be a staple if you grow green beans like we do

These were awesome!  I will definitely be saving this recipe to make again.  I didn't steam the beans first, just threw all the ingredients in a cast iron fry pan and put a lid on to let them steam while cooking and they turned out great.  I used thai sweet chili sauce and added some extra minced garlic since I didn't have the garlic chili kind.  This was the first time in a long time that my husband ate all of his green beans and commented on how great they were.  Thanks for the awesome recipe.

Great recipe. My modification.  I made 1.5 times the recipe for 5 people and it wasn't quite enough, next time I'll double it.  I didn't have "garlic chili sauce" so I used 2 parts "Patak's garlic relish" and 1 part "Lee Kum Kee Hoisin Sauce" from the Asian market.  The soy sauce I used was Tamari from the natural foods store.  I used a bit more garlic than called for.  I have no patience for steaming so I blanched my fresh local green beans for 2:30 minutes.  Fried in the hot oil for another 3 minutes, and after the sauce added 2 more.

Super happy with how these turned out. The kids liked them and even said that they are better than the ones from the Chinese restaurant down the way. Just pair it with fried rice and it is a quick and easy meal. I did not change a thing with the recipe and it turned out perfect.

I've been making these green beans forever and just now realized this is where they came from. This recipe is awesome, awesome, awesome. It works great with fresh or frozen green beans and tastes great-one of my favorite veggie recipes and sooooo easy.

I made other beans for Thanksgiving, which were fairly plain and had leftovers. For Christmas, I made these for our gathering and had nothing but rave reviews and requests for the recipe. The only change I made was to add more of the sauce mixture to spread over the beans...Will definitely add this to my cookbook for future use!

Great!  I've made this several times, as written, and with a few variations.  It's a great recipe as is, but I typically use sesame oil instead of canola and double the garlic, soy, and honey.  Thanks!

Thought it was very tasty. We didn't have any honey so we used extra chili sauce. Seems like it could make a good sauce with tofu too.

This was not what I expected.  It's not that they were bad, but the soy sauce dominated everything.  They were not sweet and spicy at all- mostly just salty.

DELISH!!! This dish is wonderful.  We really enjoyed it!  I couldn't find any garlic chili sauce so I used plain chili sauce and added extra garlic.  As soon as we finished dinner my fiancee asked me to make this again!  I will try this sauce with other veggies.  Great recipe!

These are the BEST green beans I've ever had! One word of caution though; don't take the word "spicy" in the title lightly. They are pretty spicy, especially for wimps like me who cant handle the heat. I make these for my husband often and he loves the sauce so much he's actually started making it himself and puts it on everything! Thanks again, this recipe is going in my book!

Since I like things spicy and saucy I always use a heaping tablespoon, not a teaspoon, of garlic chili sauce and double/triple the sauce recipe. I also like to blacken the green beans a bit by burning them slightly. If you do that be sure to turn down the heat and let the pan cool down slightly before you add the sauce or the garlic will burn.

This recipe is awesome.  But I did make a few changes.  I doubled the garlic-chili sauce, tripled the garlic, and added 1tsp of ground ginger.  Also, the recipe turns out WAY better if you use real soy sauce, not the stuff at most grocery stores.  I suggest Marumata Owarino Tamari, or the thickest looking tamari you can find at the grocery store.  Kikkoman is not real soy sauce.  Also, I didn't steam the beans at all.  I threw them frozen into a pan with super hot oil and sauteed until they were done.  They came out perfectly lightly browned and crispy on the ends, but not overdone in the middle.  Hmm, so I guess I really didn't make this recipe at all, I made up a new one.

Loved this recipe. I used white soy sauce so that the color of the beans did not change. I added about 1 tsp minced ginger to the sauce and at the end I added a small handful of toasted sesame seeds. It was salty and sweet with just a hint of spice. Perfect for my family. I will definitely be making this again.

I made these last week and they were so good that they were on the menu again this week.  Great way to get your kids to eat veggies.  All my boys loved them.  A touch of sesame oil is a nice addition but perfect as written.

Very tasty flavor and a great new way to serve green beans. I steamed the beans three times the stated amount and they were still a bit too crunchy. Will try again with even longer cooking time.

This recipe had amazing flavor, without overpowering the veggies.  I added a can of drained water chestnuts to give the side a little more crunch.  It goes great with any asian style entree.

I tried this for a quick dinner today for some vegatarians and they all loved it.  I usually am skeptical about trying recipes out on folk, but the reviews for this one all seemed positive, and now I too am a believer.  :-)  

I used frozen green beans, so didn't steam them before - just went straight to the frying in oil step, and that kept them crispy.  Thanks for sharing.  I'll definitely be making this again!

These were pretty darn good. I will make this again. Flavor was fantastic. Spicy more than sweet. Low-medium sweat as far as heat. I used frozen extra fine whole green beans and microwaved them a bit first until they were tender-crisp then stir fried them. The liquid from the sauce pretty much evaporated immediately as soon as it hit the hot skillet. Very good recipe, thanks.

I never liked green beans until I found this recipe!  I steam my beans in an electric veggie steamer and then add to the cooked sauce.  Easy to prepare and delicious!

Simple, quick, good.  I dice up some scallions and add it  for the last minute of stir-fry portion.  This makes it even more like you find at a good asian restaurant.

I didn't have any Chili sauce so I used red pepper flakes and it was still delicious. Thanks for a great idea. By the way my 4 year old daughter just walked in and notified me they were delicious too. And she usually doesn't eat green beans

These were really good. I used fresh string beans and only steamed them for 3 minutes because you still have to saute them after the steaming. I added a little more chili sauce, garlic and honey than was called for and I added fresh minced ginger. Very good.

This is sooo yummy!! I actually HATE fresh green beans but when I was given some by a friend I hated to throw them out & didn't want to disappoint her. This looked good but I didn't have my hopes too high. But I am so pleasantly surprised! A bit on the spicy side for some of my wienie friends but it doesn't linger in the mouth for long!! thank you so much for this great recipe!!

I have made this for my family three times now and each time its been well received.  While I failed on the "serve immediately" instruction when we took to a friend's pot luck we still took home no leftovers.  I am using Bragg's instead of soy sauce, Sriracha for the garlic chili and I add more garlic to suit my family's tastes plus I double the recipe because we love leftovers around here and this reheats well.

My husband, a man in his mid-forties, tasted these  and said to me, "These are the first green beans I've ever tasted that I actually liked. They don't taste like green beans at all."

I don't much like green beans either, to be honest, but my CSA has been giving us a ton lately, and I'm glad to have found a pretty simple recipe made from things I always have on hand in my kitchen that we both like. 

I wouldn't change a thing with this recipe (except I always use low sodium soy sauce). Perfect as is.

Wonderful way to shake up green beans!  I didn't have garlic chili sauce on hand so I sub'd granulated garlic & chili powder and it seemed to do the trick (equal parts).  Along with other reviewers, I didn't let all the liquid evap since it's  a yummy sauce....served these beans with BBQ'd teriyaki flank steak and Jasmine Rice recipe from this site.  It's a keeper - thanks COOKOFTHE HOUSE!

It needed more garlic and more honey, so taste your sauce and adjust to taste before adding it to the green beans.  Here's a tip, make the sauce first to give  the flavors time to meld, and microwave the sauce for a few seconds to warm and give it a good stir to incorporate all the ingredients before tasting.  That way, the honey isn't just sitting in a blob at the bottom of your bowl of cold soy sauce...  Once the green beans have cooked to a point where there is still some slight crunch, remove them from the pot and cook down the cooking liquid until it's thickened and more of a sauce, about 5 minutes.  Then in batches (if you're cooking a large amount like I did), add back the green beans to the pot, stirring to coat in the sauce for a few minutes more.  This was key as the beans really then start to hold that flavor, and the sauce becomes more concentrated in flavor and less like raw soy sauce.  The whole pot was eaten up!

For a more authentic flavor use hoisin sauce or a sweet plum sauce instead of honey.  This is a fabulous way to use up green beans leftover from something else

Skipped the boiling part and used frozen. So it took a bit longer in the skillet to thaw and stir fry but boy!! were these ever good!  Added to my regular side dish rotation.  Might have used a tad more (like double) the chili garlic sauce.

I just made the Sweet & Spicy Green Beans and think they are delicious.  I have a recipe for sweet & sour beans that calls for bacon, vinegar, onion, & sugar for the sauce - I tried this recipe because I didn't want to fry a pound of bacon.  I made it exactly as it is listed but, because I had two pounds of beans, had to increase the ingredients.  I accidentally used one tablespoon of Worcestershire Sauce in instead of the soy sauce but it didn't make any difference at all.  It's still delicious.  I will definitely be making this again and have already placed it in my recipe box.

As is, I didn't care for it. I had to adjust for my taste preferences adding more garlic, honey, plus tried adding some brown sugar, a little sesame oil, and red pepper flakes. Sorry, otherwise I probably wouldn't consume it.

I made this for Mother's Day and it was off the chain good!
I always liked the ones at the Asian restaurant's and wanted to try and make my own, so good you wouldn't know the difference. I didn't change a thing except to add more clove garlic, because I love more garlic flavor. One more thing, if you don't have a steamer, just put in skillet w/water, w/top and turn while cooking about five minutes, then drain water and follow recipe..  -Charlotta, AR

Great, fresh, quick green bean side dish.  I used Dynasty Sesame Chili Oil in my recipe since I did not have the garlic chili sauce.  Thank you Cookofthehouse for sharing this recipe.

Nothing wrong with this recipe. I think I should have put a little more spice, but that's just because I like spice more than sweet.

This is very good.  I used 1/2 tsp. of a chili paste that I make for Kung Pao Chicken and that amount was perfect for me.  Thanks for recipe.

What a refreshing way to prepare green beans.  I fixed them for a family dinner and everyone really enjoyed them. As state by many others, I did not have garlic chili sauce so i just used regular chili sauce.

The boyfriend hates green beans but loved them in this recipe!  Thanks for such a great stir fry.  I didn't have garlic chili sauce so instead I used a quarter teaspoon garlic salt and quarter teaspoon chili powder to stay on the conservative side.  Never had a stir fry taste so good.

This recipe is fantastic!! I hate green beans, but I ate all of my portion and wish we had more! I put all of the ingredients in a steam bag & microwaved for 6 minutes. It was so easy & delicious! I will use this recipe for many other meats & veggies. Thank you!

These were great!  However, I didn't have Garlic Chili sauce so I used Black Bean Garlic sauce and added crushed red pepper.  I'm sure it would have been good with the garlic chili sauce too but it was REALLY good with the black bean garlic sauce too!!! :)

I liked these but my husband loved them!  I used green beans fresh from the garden, siracha as the chili sauce and agave nectar instead of honey.  Quick, easy, and great side dish with steak & mashed potatoes!

I loved it.  I substituted fresh jalapeno peppers for the chili sauce because I didn't have any chili sauce.  Otherwise, I made the recipe as written.

This was pretty good. I was eyeballing the sauce and using a Mexican chili sauce instead of an Asian one, but it turned out great, and my friends really liked it! My only complaint is the amount of oil. I wonder if I could have pan-fried them with just cooking spray. Maybe next time!

Yum. A lot like green beans I had at a Chinese Restaurant. Tasted even better the next day, when they had time to sit. Like others, I substituted garlic and chili sauce because it was what I had on hand.

Love it! I don't like spicy but I had tried the spicy edamame at a sushi restaurant and couldn't get enough. So I made this recipe with edamame in place of the green beans and it was almost an exact match! Hubby even liked it and he shares my aversion to spicy foods. Will definitely make again.

These green beans have a similar taste to ones that I LOVE from an Asian restaurant in town. They are easy and quick, and use indredients I already had on hand. Also, if you have anyone who is not up for the (mild) spiciness of this dish, it is easy to simply scoop out some freshly steamed beans and serve them as is, or with some other preparation, before putting the beans in to stir-fry with the sauce.

Pretty good. Soy sauce flavor is strong. I added 1/2 tsp minced ginger & 1/2 of a shallot. Made this as a side for seared ahi tuna. Probably will make this one again.

8-29-11:  I thought this was excellent, although Ann thought it a bit hot - next time maybe use less garlic chili sauce.

These were great.  Very easy to make and the best way to make green beans, especially since I don't like them.  But I will definitely make them this way again.

Sorry to say, not our favorite.  The garlic chile sauce overpowered the green beans and I used less than called for.  We are really like spicy foods, but the flavor was just not right in this dish.

Yum yum! I love spicy green beans! I used the real garlic chili sauce which is definitely a must. I used about 1.5 tsp garlic chili sauce and double the garlic. My girlfriend found them too hot, but she could still eat them. Perhaps if I used only the called for 1 tsp of chili sauce it would be better for her.

These are so good.  Just like you get at the restaurant.  Just make sure you don't steam the beans too long.  They'll turn out soggy.

I did not use the garlic chile sauce on this simply because I did not have it, instead I double the amount of ingredients and added a tiny bit of water. It wasn't necessarily sweet and sour. Although they were excellent!

This recipe is delicious! I make it at least once a week with any meal- not just asian themed cooking, and everyone always loves it. I was a little skeptical about how the chili sauce would taste on my beans but you can't even tell it's in there because the flavors meld so nicely with one another.

This is a great green bean recipe. Only did not give 5 stars because the sauce didn’t stick well to the beans. Made mine just as the recipe was written. Be sure not to overcook the beans!

good, but not 5 star worthy.ql Sauce was AMAZING but isn't perfect for green beans. I added mushrooms and am very glad I did because they absorbed the sauce very well. Without them the green beans would be bland since the sauce doesn't stick well or stand out on them.

These were a BIG hit at a dinner party! The perfect savory flavor where you could still taste the vegetable. I made sure I didn't overcook the beans because I like a nice crunch.

Very similar to a favorite dish at a Vietnamese restaurant we love. I used a bag of microwaveable green beans and added sliced shallots and peanuts. This recipe served two as a main dish with rice. We will definitely be making this again.

Really good. I used 1 cup chicken broth and did not use the steamer basket. I thought they were a little over cooked, but my husband said they were perfect.

Stumbled upon this while trying to figure out what to do with a bunch of green beans I had in the frig. Turned out to be delicious. Glad I stumbled upon it. The only changes I made was to add some chopped onion and mushrooms to it and served it over rice. I’ll be make this again.

These were very tasty. The flavor sticks to the beans. I didn’t have chili sauce so I substituted a pepper jelly.  I will make again for company.

Good but not great.  The soy sauce is the predominate flavor.  Next time I'll cut the soy sauce down a little bit and increase the honey.

I made this and it was such a hit I had to make it again. The serving bowl was practically licked clean both times. The chili and soy sauces are always a great combination. I suppose the honey is added to somewhat mute the heat in the chili sauce, however, I can never  really taste the sweetness of the honey (which is OK with me l like spicy foods). If you and your family/friends prefer a more sweeter taste I would suggest that you double the amount of honey the recipe calls for.

I've had a similar version of this recipe at a restaurant now closed:  been looking for a similar recipe I could make at home.  My wife and I are not real 'spicy' people and I cut the amount of garlic chili sauce in half which is quite 'hot'.  Really liked the recipe.  Next time I might try frying the beans and skip the steam pre cook.  Also might try a little more honey with hope of the sauce sticking to beans a bit more.  Somewhere between a tsp and 1.5 tsp of garlic chili sauce is more suitable to our taste.  Great recipe!  Thank you.

I did the prep work ahead of time...not necessary to do, but I just did because I had the time.  So easy and so very good! Next time I will probably add a little brown sugar for sweetness, maybe as they are simmering.  Even though my beans were dry, the sauce was still a little watery, but that didn't make it bad.  Takes little time, but tastes like it didn't.

These green beans were simple and delicious!! I didn’t steam the beans in a separate pot. I sautéed the garlic in a pan for a min then added the green beans. Put a few tablespoons of water then a lid on the pan to steam, stirring occasionally and adding more water as needed. Once the beans were tender, I added the sauce and cooked it a little more. Everyone loved them. I think they tasted better after the beans soaked in all the sauce and garlic. By the way, I added way more garlic than what the recipe called for. I sautéed more garlic in oil and topped the dish with it. Recipe is a keeper.

It was simple to make and very tasty.  I am not big on salt so I will reduce the soy sauce the next time. I will make again.

I make this a bit differently, but the result is the same...delish! I add some red pepper flakes though.

Beautiful combination of flavors!  I used fresh instead of canned and used minced garlic instead of powdered. I added five minutes to the cooking time and they came out slightly  crunchy the way my family likes them.  My children asked that I make this recipe for thanksgiving in place of my traditional green bean casserole.

This recipe is a hit. The perfect blend of sweet and spicy. My husband asks me to make extra servings as he gobbles them up. Pretty good for carrots too.

Really good.  My BF said it was the best green beans he's ever had.  He's not a green bean person.  However, in this case, I needed to put things in the oven for about 45 minutes before we could eat (at 225 degrees).  I want to make this again without needing to do that and see how they are.  I'm sure it will be different.  But good!

These green beans had amazing yummy flavor. My step daughter normally hates green beans, but said these were so yummy it’s the only way I’m allowed to make green beans from now on. The only changes were regular chili sauce instead of garlic, and sautéed the green beans in bacon grease instead of canola oil.

Turned out great. I precooked the green beans in the microwave, used regular chili sauce, and added sliced almonds.

We loved it.  The only thing I did different was decrease the chili sauce to 1/2  tsp.  It was just enough for me with a hint of hotness but my husband thought I could increase it to 1 tsp.    I might try that next time.  Also I might trying increasing the beans.  There seemed to be more than enough sauce.
This was a great recipe for my over abundance of green beans, something different.  Definitely will make it again.

We really liked these easy green beans!! I dint boil the beans I just sautéed them with the garlic in the oil for about 5 mins then added the sauce mix for an additional 3-4 mins. One pot to clean! We like beans crispy and these turned out awesome. Hubby says I should try them as written next see which way we like them. They were perfect this way we'll see how the original one turn out. Thanks for a TASTY bean green treat!!

I love that it’s easy to make with frozen green beans and it’s super quick. I like spicey so the second time I made it I doubled the chili sauce. That was a mistake this recipe is perfection as is.

Very well done!  I didn't have any sort of chili but it was still delicious!  Very light with just a little kick from the garlic and sweetness from the honey.  The family enjoyed it immensely.  Thank you ever so much for sharing this simple yet tasty treat

I had to use more honey when mixing the sauce since all I could taste was soy sauce. 
This didn't really have much flavor. My husband did not like it but I saved the left overs because I'll probably eat them but won't make it again. Sorry.

I followed the recipe at the beginning and sauteed the beans with the ingredients in the recipe. But as I tasted I added more garlic chili sauce, sesame oil and some oyster sauce as one reviewer suggested. It was still missing flavor and salt. I think it needs more soy sauce for the salt flavor. It was pretty bland even adding extra sesame oil and oyster sauce to the ingredients. But it is a great idea that needs some tweaking.

The beans tasted good but nothing fantastic. I think next time I'll use sesame oil to cook them in after steaming.

I didn't steam the green beans, and I didn't have garlic chili sauce. Instead, I added about a 1/2 a teaspoon of chili powder and threw the green beans straight into the pan. I probably would use a little less soy sauce and maybe a dash more chili powder next time to cut down the salt and kick up the spice. It was easy to make, smelled and tasted great, and I had no leftovers once my husband and father-in-law got into it! Overall, it was a hit!

This was delicious! My husband, who normally gags at green beans, said they should be put on regular rotation. I read many reviews that leave out the chili sauce and to me that'd be like omitting cheese from mac and cheese! It's the "spicy" part of the sweet and spicy. I used Korean Gojuchang and they were perfect. You could certainly make broccoli, asparagus, etc the same way.

These are really good.  I did exchange the soy sauce for Bragg's liquid aminos and used olive oil in place of canola.  They are tasty!

Flavorful and delicious! I can't find garlic chili sauce in our local groceries so I just add more garlic. I hardly measure the recipe amount and it's so good! So sometimes it may be a little sweeter and sometimes a little spicy! Every time I make this my family and friends just devoir the plate! Will probably have to order the garlic chili sauce on amazon!

It was very good and I'd probably give it 4.5 stars if that were an option.  As another reviewer did, I substituted 1 teaspoon of the canola oil with toasted sesame oil and added additional garlic.  Also used sriracha hot chile sauce since that was what I had.  
I'll make it again the same way.

Made this in lieu of the typical green bean casserole for Thanksgiving. It was nice to have a dish like this alongside normal Thanksgiving food since it was bold and spicy. Nice counterpoint. Will add this to my year-round repertoire.

Agree with other reviews, this side dish is simple yet packs a lot of flavor into a standard veggie.  I basically followed the recipe though doubling the beans and garlic and used sirachcha

I made this with one of those steamer bags of fresh green beans from the store. Just popped it in the microwave per the bag instructions, then put them in the pan and followed the recipe from there. My husband said they were the best green beans he's ever had. It'll definitely be a new regular for us!

Great recipe for green beans.  Simple, quick, and full of flavor.  I used frozen green beans.  I used butter instead of oil for more flavor and round out the taste.  Will definitely make this again.

I used 1/2 of law salt soy sauce, mild chili peppers from Budapest instead of chili sauce, added some ginger and 172 tbsp sparkling wine.  It was more crisp to the palate I guess.

So easy. So delicious. Had to sub regular chili sauce so like others, I added a little garlic.  Husband was running late so I had to reheat when he got home and he still loved them.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very good recipe!  Did not have the garlic chili sauce so I followed another reviewer's advice and substituted equal amounts of garlic powder and chili powder. In addition, I accidentally used Dale's steak seasoning sauce instead of soy and it was great!   I was doubtful as to how far the sauce would go but it was perfect!

soooo good.  I substituted chili paste and only put a half of a teaspoon of that in there.  Ive made it a couple times now.  make sure you keep them on the heat until they start to get a little black or burnt.

I didn't have garlic chili sauce, just sriracha which I'm not a fan of.
I used 1/2 tsp sriracha, 1/2 tsp teriyaki and it worked out just fine.
Needed a little salt and pep to taste but all in all was a good last minute side.

I could't find any garlic/chili sauce so I combined garlic powder and chili powder as a substitute and I think it turned out pretty good. Needed a little more spice, but overall delicious!

I made these green beans and loved them.  However, they didn't have very much flavor and there wasn't enough sauce.  If I make it again I will double the ingredients in the sauce.

This was absolutely delicious. Easy to make. I had all the ingredients except honey, had to substitute agave syrup and that worked just fine. A very nice change from the green beans I was raised on.

Very good!  I added more stir fry veggies and doubled the sauce to make a main dish, we very much enjoyed it. I did add a healthy shake of red pepper flakes to make it spicier, per our tastes, but the sauce would have been quite good without it.

very good, very easy, very fast. I didn't have garlic chili sauce so I used sriracha sauce and it was great. From raw beans to table in under 25 minutes.

Quick, easy, to die for. I didn't have garlic chili sauce, so I added a bit extra garlic and chili oil. Also, I always use Olive oil. I have made this recipe more times than I remember and the family always asks for seconds.

I accidentally defrosted 1/2 lb. of haricots verts and needed to use them quickly.  This recipe did the trick and then some.  My chili oil doesn't have garlic so I added extra fresh garlic.  I couldn't get the lid off the honey jar so used blue agave for the sweetening.  I only use olive oil.  None of that seemed to detract from this recipe at all.  Now I did have to cook the beans longer because they were rubbery when I followed the time guidelines, but that just gave the sauce more time to integrate with the beans.  I'll make this with fresh beans next time and the time after that....

Fantastic! I used frozen instead of fresh green beans, sugar instead of honey, and sri racha instead of garlic chili sauce. Same diff! This is a very sneaky way to infuse some Asian flavor into a home-cooked meal.

Very Good. A little spicy but I have a heavy hand and it could have been the chili sauce I used. It's got a lot of flavor and my family really liked it. We will have it again.

Recipe is very quick and easy. Did not have that garlic chili sauce so substituted with a small squirt of Sriracha and an extra garlic clove. My only complaint was it seemed a bit oily for our liking, so will try again cutting the oil down by half.  Otherwise, good recipe.

This was fantastic!  I added a little bit more garlic chili sauce and used olive oil instead of canola oil.  Perfet harmony of sweet and spicy.

Delicious. Easy. Affordable. Pretty. Instantly doubled our green been consumption. I don't care for them without some flavoring help, so this did the trick. A keeper!

So easy and tasty. Admittedly, I took another reviewers advice and subsituted garlic and chili powder for the garlic chili sauce (didnt have that), also cooked green beans and asparagus in sesame oil to desired tenderness, added scallion at the end. Served over jasmine rice. I'm sure it will be just as tasty with the garlic chili paste which I will try next time.

I just made this tonight and it turned out great. I didn't have the chili sauce on hand so I used a couple teaspoons of sweet chili sauce instead and omitted the honey. I then added a dash oh red pepper flakes for the extra heat it was missing. My husband loved it and I liked it even though I'm not a fan of green beans.

I was desperate for something different to do with green beans. Found this recipe. I decided to leave out the garlic chili sauce 'cause my wife doesn't care for spicy foods. Then found I had only 1 tablespoon of soy sauce! Used a bit of worchestershire and a dash of garlic powder.Probably not as good as the original, but still tasted good and gave a little different twist to dinner. Thanks.

Great recipe especially with grilled salmon and rice.  I boiled the water verses steamed and it was fine.  Will definitely do again.  I would make this for company as well.

Great base recipe when you get a craving for that Asian flavor.  I used Sriracha sauce as the garlic chili sauce and because I wanted the sauce to be a bit thicker, I added 1/2 tsp of corn starch diluted in water at the last minute.  Really tasty, thank you!

I had to improvise it with a couple things, but it still came out great! I used frozen green beans instead of fresh, I used a little extra crushed garlic from a bottle instead of a fresh garlic clove, I substituted Agave for honey, and I used red pepper powder and a tad more of the garlic because I didn't have any sauce. It came out a little salty, but I threw in some shrimp and it balanced it out.

I added chicken and broccoli to some home-grown bush beans. I didn't have the garlic chili powder either, so I just chopped some extra garlic and used ground cayenne pepper. It was so delicious! The aroma as it cooked was mouth-watering! I will definitely be using this with other veggies and meats, maybe over rice or noodles. Excellent recipe!

I don't care for my green beans to be so firm, so I'll cook them longer next time.  Also, instead of chili paste I used 3 fresh serranos.  I think habanero peppers would also work very well if you prefer a lot of spice.

Yum! Not too overpowering, just right. I used two cloves of garlic and I didn't have garlic chili sauce so I used liberal amounts of sriracha instead. Threw the beans in the skillet and added tomatoes and mushrooms. Yummy over rice!

I didn't get the sweet part, but they were really good :) Even my dad enjoyed them and he's the pickiest eater out there. I didn't steam them beforehand and next time I might consider it as the thicker beans were a littl too crunchy.

The sauce is very nice but there was not enough flavor for us.  I used the sauce for the chicken and it was wonderful just not enough flavor on the beans.

Absolutely spot on recipe! What a wonderful way to jazz-up green beans! My family won't let me make them plain anymore! (The only thing I changed was using frozen green beans, but the sauce was the same.)

I didn't have any garlic chili sauce, but I had some Sriracha in the fridge so I subbed it out, whisked it with the soy sauce and 2 teaspoons of honey instead of 1 to combat some of the heat from my substitution. Came out really great :)

I was disappointed in this recipe. The sauce is flavorful, but it is so intense that it overwhelms the more delicate taste of the green beans, in my opinion. Not a well-balanced dish.

This was my first time cooking green beans! I love garlic, so I added 4 minced garlic cloves to substitute the fact I don't have garlic chili sauce, and replaced that with Thai sweet chili sauce (1 tablespoons). I made a large amount of green beans so I added tablespoons rather than teaspoons. This game out great! It's one of my favorite green beans dishes I've had.

These are SOOOO yummy! Only change I made was to add some fresh sliced mushrooms that needed to be used up.  I ended up with about 2 lbs of green beans and mushrooms so tripled the sauce, figuring my family of four would have leftovers. Not a bean left in the pan.  Will definitely be making again!

Wonderful Asian flavor.  I cut back a bit on the garlic, as my garlic chili sauce is very strong on garlic.  Next time I will use just a bit more honey and probably double the amount of sauce so we can pour over rice.

Great dish. I doubled the amount of garlic as we like more. Instead of garlic chili sauce I used a Thai chili sauce to give it a little more "kick"! A new favorite. Thanks for sharing =)

I made this exactly as the recipe called for, and the whole family loved it!  It was a LITTLE spicy so next time I'll cut down a tiny bit on the garlic-chilli sauce and put a tiny bit more honey.  The mix of flavors was great!  For the first time ever, there were no leftover green beans!

Very, very good. I substituted honey for pure maple syrup due to availability. Added tablespoon of sesame seeds that gave good flavor. Next time I will use just a bit less soy sauce; not too salty, but masked the flavor of the beans more than I would like.

My girls (7 and 6) usually don't eat green beans, but they loved this dish!  Had 2 other dishes for dinner tonight, but didn't touch those - only ate the green beans.  5 stars for getting my girls to eat vegetables!

Phenomenal taste - beyond what I'd expect based on the ingredient list.  I did cut the garlic chili sauce in half (I used Sriracha) and that was about all I could handle.  Might reduce it a little more next time.  But completely delicious flavor.  The honey with the soy and garlic chili was a perfect balance.  I did also sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds for appearance - black sesame seeds would also be nice, though perhaps not as pretty.  Outstanding recipe.

These were fantastic!  What a nice change from a regular steamed vegetable.  Served them with some Ahi tuna burgers - great combo.  I used half of the garlic chili sauce because I wasn't sure about the heat, but next time I will use the full teaspoon.  Definitely a "keeper"!

Absolutely delicious!  I didn't have garlic chili sauce so I used another reviewers suggestion of garlic powder and chili powder and used a half tsp of each.  The sauce was delicious - just the right amount of flavor without any component being overpowering.  This is definitely going to be a staple side dish for us!

loved the flavors.  I did add an extra clove of garlic for my tasted.  Also added a Tbsp of Mirin (sweek sake) and some sesame seeds for my liking but base recipe is very good.  Served them with Beef Stroganoff and mashed potatoes which added a nice contrast of flavors.  Thank you

Super YUM.  I didn't see the need to dirty 2 dishes plus the steamer.  I just fried them up in the pan and added the sauce.  These are seriously good beans.  I will make them again- even the picky daughter liked them:)

These were very good! I added 2 teaspoons of chili sauce instead of 1 and did 1 teaspoon of canola oil and 1 teaspoon of sesame oil. These were tasty and everyone really enjoyed them! Thanks for sharing. :)

I used the real garlic chili sauce from the Asian section at the store (Huy Fong is the brand, same brand that makes Sriracha) and this dish was VERY hot and sooooo good! We loved it but it does pack a lot of heat. Yum! I think you could use this recipe with a lot of different veggies, even a mix of a few.

Excellent!  I'm dieting so this was a very tasty recipe for those low fat green beans, bringing them in at 1 point per serving so I was able to eat 2 servings to feel a bit more satisfied.  Thanks for some flavor!

I tried this with Brussel sprouts tonight and also added some onions. The mixture was delicious but I made too much of it so it was a little overpowering. I think if I halve it next time (or actually follow the directions and use the correct amount of green beans), it will be much better. But overall, a great flavor.

Yum! Yum! Yum! Yum! This recipe was fantastic! Simple to make and full of flavor. I cheated and used the steam in bag beans and then combined everything in a saucepan over low heat but WOW! This was delicious!

This was amazing. And my husband ate all the sauce even that I made a double batch based on his request. The sauce was so delicious and would taste great with other veggies as well. The only change I made is use sesame oil. Made it with the Ginger Glazed Mahi and brown rice.... This one is a keeper.

Quick update - I made this the first time with fresh green beans and the second time with frozen. The fresh ones were much better, so don't try to cut that extra step it's worth it. The frozen ones soaked up all the liquid and it made it way too salty. Both me and my husband agreed it wasn't as good. So fresh is the way to go

Tonight I cooked this along with "Teriyaki Flank Steak" and white rice. I was actually slightly let down with the spiciness of the sauce. I used Sun Luck brand hot garlic pepper sauce. It couldn't have been any hotter then medium salsa, however it tasted great so it wasn't that big of a deal. We cooked green beans separate for our daughter just to be safe, but after finishing off the green beans I'm pretty sure she could have easily handled it. This is a great variation to just steaming green beans.

My husband and I couldn't get over how good these are! I steamed fresh green beans for about 12-15 minutes (we prefer our beans on the softer side). Doubled the ingredients (except the chili sauce and I used Sriracha). What an explosion of flavor. I paired the beans with Barbeque Halibut Steaks from this site, and a cucumber salad. Oh man, was it good!

Yum! This is a nice, different way to make green beans. It reminds me of side dishes I've had at Asian restaurants. I used Sriracha garlic chile sauce and it was just the right amount of spice. I only wish that the sauce would have coated the beans more. It was thin and puddled at the bottom of the bowl. Next time I might add a bit of cornstarch to thicken it up.

I made these for a side dish for Christmas dinner.  EVERYONE, even the kids, loved these!  I used a lb. of frozen green beans,added a little more Thai Garlic Chili Paste then what it called for and used a Lite Soy Sauce to cut down on the sodium but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  I will be making this again and again!  Thanks for such an easy and wonderful veggie recipe that my whole family enjoyed!

This was really good.  I'm not much of a sauce person-I tend to steam my veg and maybe add a drizzle of olive oil or some sea salt, but I was in the mood for something new.  I didn't bother with the canola oil.  I just let the beans steam for a moment, then added the soy/honey sauce to the pan.  Since I didn't have any garlic chili sauce, I used spicy oyster sauce-I had a bottle in the fridge.  The flavor really is kind of strong, and I was about to toss them out, then I decided to chill the prepared beans like a previous reviewer did.  Fantastic!  Really!  Love them.  I didn't think chilled beans would be any good, but these were delicious.  I will make them again.  And I will always chill them before eating.  Highly recommend them that way.

Made this for our Labor Day picnic & everyone really loved it.  I usually read through a recipe a few times before I make it but for some reason this time I thought I knew what needed to be done.  Well, I did it incorrectly but it still came out great.  I steamed the fresh green beans and then made a mixture of everything else and tossed it.  It really came out very good that way -- for something a little different or quicker.  Next time I'll try it the "right" way!

I cooked the sugar misture too long and it got hard as a rock.  I put it aside and when I reheated it, it melted nicely.  It got rave reviews at my house!  (I don't usually cook things too long!)

We absolutely loved this. I even made them twice in about 6 days. These rival any Chinese restaurant that serves spicy green beans. My husband is so happy I found this recipe. I didn't change a thing - which is rare for me.

I will definitely serve these again, they were soooo good.  I love green beans but trying to keep things healthy.  I found myself tempted to increase the sauce as some of the other reviewers mentioned, but as they advised, you don't need to.  I did add an extra clove of garlic...but then, I always do when a dish calls  for garlic.

Excellent if you really let them sizzle in the oil, maybe the garlic oil would make is slightly better.

Really enjoyed this one.  Followed the recipe with the exception of using one of the new steam bags from ziplock to steam the beans.  Husband said, "make this one again"!

Really good and easy. Only changes I made were using olive oil instead of canola, added red onion to garlic mixture, and added red pepper flakes for a little extra spice. loved this recipe

I tried this recipe a few months back and it has been requested over and over again at my house. Great recipe that is quick and easy.  Also, I was missing the chili sauce on a few occasions and it still came out great.  My only addition is a little bit of cayenne and seasonings.

I made this last night and loved it.  I added water chestnuts to it and it was great.  Everything else I did the same I just wanted the crunch from the chestnut.  This was easy and a different way to do green beans!  Will make this again.

Really good.  I used frozen french cut green beans, and substituted catsup and dry red pepper for the chili sauce because that's what I had on hand.

We eat a lot of green beans, and this was a refreshing change from the usual butter-and-garlic thing.  I'm not sure the fella was won over, but I'll definitely try these again!

i LOVED this recipe.  what made it so great is the sauce.  great flavor.  i followed the recipe exactly and the only change i might make is to skip steaming the green beans because the sauce is so good, i think the beans would absorb even more of the flavor if they were cooked in it the entire time.

THESE BEANS WERE VERY GOOD BUT I DID CHANGE 1 THING. I PUT EQUAL PARTS OF SOY SAUCE AND HONEY. I FOUND THE SAUCE TO SALTY BUT WHEN I INCREASED THE HONEY IT WAS PERFECT. I WILL BE MAKING THESE AGAIN. ALSO THE SAUCE WOULD WORK WELL ON SALMON AND ASPARAGUS.

These are so yummy and easy!  I used frozen green beans, so I started the recipe with cooking the beans in the pan first, then added the other ingredients.

Very good.  A bit too salty, so I added a bit more honey than called for and I didn't have chili sauce so I used tomato sauce,
brown sugar, vinegar
cinnamon and allspice to make up the chili sauce.

My family said never fix green beans any other way again! They loved this recipe.  I doubled the sauce because I find most times it's necessary, not with this one! It was too much sauce, but still good. I also added a couple of splashes of seseme oil, which just added to the flavor. I served these with the Asian Lettuce Wraps, also on this site and had a very satisfying dinner...with no leftovers!  Thanks for the new green bean recipe!

I chuckled when reading other reviewers' "OMG"...but OMG is right! These are SO GOOD! I would not recommend using canned green beans - I skipped the first step and still they came out a little soggy but they tasted so good it didn't matter. If canned is all you have, make sure you drain them very well. Excellent!

I've been looking for a good and different way to serve green beans - this may be the only way from now on!  This sauce is so delicious, a little sweet and a little spicy, and so easy to prepare.  I will be making this again and again.

I usually modify recipes, but this one is great the way it is!  It is fast, easy, and tastes so yummy!  I used frozen green beans as another reviewer suggested and they worked perfectly for me as well.

very good if you're looking for something different to do to green beans.  or to compliment asian-style dishes.  try it on canned beans for a quick flavorful recipe.
