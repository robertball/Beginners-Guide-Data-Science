Mushroom lovers (like ME) will love this! I did substitute diced red onion for the green onions -- gave it a nice color with the green parsley.  Served it over lettuce leaves along with a grilled steak dinner. Thanks for a "keeper", Valarie!

the mushroom salad was very good and once you make it you need to eat it fast or it will go stale on you.

Family enjoyed this very much. I added some cucumber because it needed to be used and a bit of minced onion and left out the swiss cheese just because I don't care for cold cheese. Would make this again and feel free to add any veggies your family may enjoy. I think this would also make a good marinade for grilled veggies.

This went well with grilled pork chops. I went with red onion and Montgomery Jack cheese. If you love mushrooms and summer salads then you gotta try this.

I added a few things to the recipe, like a tomato & some cilantro. I also switched red wine vinegar for white wine vinegar (it's what I had), swiss for Colby & Dijon for regular mustard... but, it was a real hit even my son loved it.
