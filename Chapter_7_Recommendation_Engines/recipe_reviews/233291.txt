I made this with my granddaughter.  She is going on a road trip.  It tastes great! We did add more pretzels, m&m’s and candy corn. We doubled those in the recipe.  Everything else was spot on.  I had to stop everyone from standing around and trying it while it cooled.

Looking for a fall 'faceless' recipe, I came across this one.  The mixture is good, but it is a little messy because of the peanut butter mixture.  I doesn't "dry" quite the same as your typical cereal snack mixes.  I baked for the 1 hour, as directed and let it air dry before storing it.  I did opt to add the candy corn and the M&M® to the mixture.  This was the Girl's Night Out treat for October 2014.
