The best Spaghetti Squash, pesto and sausage I ever tasted! So easy to make too. I substituted the beef sausage for Hillshire Turkey sausage and used all natural pesto. My kids who are very picky thought this was very delicious. Doubled the recipe for two nights (for a family of 6). I will make this again.

This was an easy, yummy, dinner. Even my finicky husband, who usually just wants a salad and a burger really liked it. I’ll be making it again.

I used 6 field roast vegetarian italian sausages that I fried up first with onion, carrot, thyme, basil. I added the skillet mixture back to the oven with parmesan and nutritional yeast on top to help meld the flavors, which need more time to deepen.

I loved it.  My mother liked it but my husband says he likes spaghetti noodles not squash.  My father says it was okay.  So I guess everyone had a different opinion.

First time making spaghetti squash, and I have to say was pleasantly pleased and amazed !!! I think I would add less pesto next time, but my boyfriend and I both liked it, we were going to make a back up dinner in case we didn’t like it and after it was finished, decided there was no need. Served with hot Italian bread and a salad. Definitely a keeper !

Did not care for it. Made it as a meal prep to have throughout the week, and perhaps that was the issue. Maybe if I’d have eaten it right away? I like all the ingredients, but it didn’t work for me. Also only used the cheapie Hilshire Farms Kielbasa..but then again, that was my favorite part of the dish. I am erasing some recipes that I won’t use again, in order to downsize..and this will come off.

It was good, but my wife and I, both prefer the Hillshire Farm recipe using cabbage, instead of broccoli.

We will definitely make this recipe again.  Light and healthy with the perfect amount of zest from the sausage.

This is a great way to make spaghetti squash!  I was a little apprehensive when I read  the ingredients but, the reviews convinced me to give it a try and I'm glad I did!  I followed the recipe exactly using Kirkland Pesto from COSTCO.  It was fantastic.  And I think you could easily omit the Smoked Sausage if you wanted to make it completely vegetarian/

Made this as the recipe directed, and found it to be a good week night dinner as advertised.  Seems to need some small flavor tweak to really make it shine, but I can't think of what.

Absolutely terrific. Made it exactly by the recipe. I would not change a thing. The spaghetti squash was  very light and different from other dishes calling for angel hair or other pasta. Excellent!!!

I agree this is easy to make but the result is not satisfactory.  I used home made venison sausage (what a waste) & home made pesto.  It came out mushy & heavy.  I would cut way back on the amount of pesto & skip the cheese since there is already plenty of it in the pesto.  But would not make it again.
