I started with half a teaspoon of cloves and would only do a pinch next time. This makes a rich and tasty stock but the end result needs more substance in my opinion. The cook's notes state that potato or parsnips can be added but I decided to add celery and carrots back into the soup and didn't add them until the last 30 minutes of cook time. As written I can only give this 3 stars but it is easily tweaked and has potential.
