I made a few modifications on this one, but I believe the result was truly a restaurant-quality dish. 1) Use jumbo shells instead of manicotti - easier to stuff. 2) For the filling: use one 15oz tub of part-skim ricotta, 8oz of good quality jumbo lump crabmeat (expensive but well worth it), one egg (important for texture), 1/2 cup parmesan cheese, 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella, 2 tbsp dried parsley, 1 tsp dried basil. Season with salt and pepper to taste. 3) For the sauce, use two 10oz tubs of Buitoni alfredo (found in the refridgerated case) - simmer the sauce on the stove with 1/2 cup dry white wine and season with pepper. Follow baking directions as written, but sprinkle with mozzarella cheese 5 min before removing from the oven. This is a dish I would be proud to serve to company!

Absolutely delicious ! The only things I did differently were to make my own Alfredo Sauce (using Easy Alfredo Sauce 1 from Allrecipes), and I added about four sliced white mushrooms to the sauce. Eight minutes of boiling the manicotti shells is probably enough; much longer and they're more at risk of ripping as you're trying to stuff them. A tsp of sugar is listed as an ingredient, but not mentioned in the directions: add it to the chicken broth.

I made this for my parents for their 30th anniversary meal (along with seafood stuffed avacados & crusty french bread, both from allrecipes). It was a hit! The only change I made was sprinkling mozzerela cheese on top for the last 5 minutes of baking.

I used 15 oz. fat-free ricotta and 8 oz. surimi.  I added some dillweed to the ricotta mixture and sprinkled mozzarella over the alfredo sauce.  I only added garlic powder and 3/4 cup of chicken broth to the alfredo sauce.  Thought this was real good and rich.  I'm sure we'll make it again but probably use jumbo shells instead of manicotti since they're a little easier to stuff.

I made this recipe yesterday and it was quite yummy! I did make a few changes but nothing too drastic. I made my own alfredo sauce {1 package cream cheese, 1 stick margarine, 2/3 cup milk, 1 cup parmesan cheese} I added all the seasonings to it plus some extra garlic powder because it didn't have much taste. I added some milk to the stuffing mix because it was a little too dry for my liking. I also used the shells instead of manicotti noodles but needed an extra set of hands to stuff them. I put all the "stuffing" into a baggie and cut the corner off to make it easier. I have a big family so I pretty much doubled everything but could have made more sauce to cover it. Then added some shredded Parmesan cheese to the top of it and poured some of the chicken broth into the bottom of the pan around the noodles before cooking. The family loved it and went back for seconds and thirds. It is a very rich dish but yummy! I will definately make this again. Thanks for the recipe!

This was a good recipe. The only thing I would change next time is replacing the alfredo sauce with regular spaghetti sauce. The ricotta and alfredo were just too much where a tomato sauce would have cut some of the richness from the ricotta cheese. Great recipe though! Thanks!

Absolutely wonderful dish!!  I followed the recipe exactly but used fresh crab instead of canned.  I almost used the Alfredo sauce as it was, but very glad I adjusted it as the recipe asked.  Highly recommend with a green salad and fresh bread.  Thank you to the cook who submitted it!

I thought this recipe was great! The best part was the alfredo sauce with the chicken broth, marjoram, thyme, and garlic powder--it had the best flavor!! I served it with salad and garlic bread and it was a perfect meal.

This was very good.  I would only use real crab in this recipe.  Did need a little more sauce.  Will make this again.

This was very easy to make.....however, if like me you want to taste crab in every bite....please increase the crab amount.  When I made this dish as the recipe requested, I only tasted a hint of crab.  My second batch turned out better than the first by these simple additions...I used 3/4 amount of the ricotta cheese and I bought 1 pound of real crab legs in addition to the can lump crab......way, way, better!!!.

Pretty good, but make sure you use the lump crabmeat, or it can have a gritty texture.

I made this using shells and stuffed them with the cheese and crab mixture. I added about 1 cup of the broth and accented the onion and garlic and parsley omitting the other spices. Added mozzerella cheese as well. LOVED IT!

I love this receipe! My spouse has heart issues so fat free ricotta cheese, and omit the chicken broth. I add two cloves of garlic and fat reduced four cheese blend cheese to the crab mix without the thyme, but add black pepper instead. I use Catelli cannelloni express shells that you don't have to pre-boil and stuffing them is super easy and they bake to perfection. Add a little of the Alfredo sauce to the pan and then add the stuffed shells cover and bake. For the last ten minutes I add the rest of the four cheese blend with one large diced tomato. Wow!

Very good. Its important to spend the extra money on good crab meat and I think it needed some lemon juice on top to balance everything out but very good.

Great recipe. Doubled the sauce and used 8 ounces fresh crab meat + almost 2 cups of ricotta cheese. Filled 12 manacotti shells perfectly! Very rich, but very good.

loved this recipe. I got a lot of compliments when I made this. I used fresh basil and thyme, instead of the dry kind. The only thing that was suggested from my guests was to use more sauce. Other than that it was a HIT!

The first time I have used fresh crabmeat and I am sold!!  I had a dinner party where one of the guests was a vegetarian.  So, instead of using chicken broth, I used vegetable broth.  Everyone cleaned their plate.  I doubled the shells, cheese & crab, but not the sauce.  It makes plenty.  YUM-O!

Truly delicious but extremely rich! Haven't had the opportunity to experiment yet, but I would like to try some substitutions and/or adjustments in ingredients to make this recipe just a bit more subtle. Using the recipe as is, i would suggest as a tapas. Great recipe!

This is a great recipe!  I messed up, and bought crab meat that was like pulp, rather than lump crab meat.  I will try it again in the future with the corrrect meat.  Even so, it still tasted pretty good.  I think adding some white wine to the alfredo sauce would be devine!  I also used shells, rather than manicotti.  That worked out very well.  All in all, this recipe is a great idea, and a great building block!  Thanks for sharing it!

This was a fun recipe to make!  I used 1 live cooked crab (took awhile to shell, but worth it).  I replaced the garlic powder with 1 clove of minced garlic, and omitted the basil and marjoram.  It was really rich, but really good.

Do you like crab? You will love it.  Great recipe- I made it exactly as it's written.  You could substitute other sauces for the alfredo and it would be excellent too.  For as easy as it is, people will think you spent all day in the kitchen.

I absolutely loved this! The only changes I made were using the starkist (sp) packaged crab meat instead of canned, it tastes so much more fresh. I also used 2 jars of alfredo sauce, one regular and one mushroom garlic we love by Classico. The manicotti shells are always a challenge for me so maybe next time I will use jumbo shells as suggested by others. Definitely a wonderful dish.

very tasty but very rich dish.  Good as a side dish but may be too much as a main dish for some people

Pretty good stuff. Took the advice of others and used the easy alfredo sauce from this site. I used two cans of crab and was glad that I did. A lot of work but, it was good.

Excellent Recipe! I chopped green onions instead of the grated onion and added a little fresh romano the the filling mixture and to the alfredo sauce. When I was at the grocery store purchasing ingredients, I  spaced out and got jumbo shells instead of manicotti (maybe I was looking at the photos for this recipe). I think that the shells were perfect in this recipe. I will make this again and probably use shells again. Thanks!

I went middle of the road on this one because the crab stuffing was excellent, but the alfredo sauce with it was waaaay too rich to go with it (my little one even gagged as he ate it, but said it was good).  I would suggest making the shells with maybe a lighter garlic sauce instead.  Or even a vodka sauce.

This is deliciously rich! My boyfriend proclaimed this as 'awesome' promptly after finishing his plate, so it's well deserving of 5 stars. Especially since he doesn't consider himself a big crab fan. I did use 8oz of surimi in place of the crabmeat. I omitted the onion, basil & marjoram, and upped the parsley. I made 'Alfredo Sauce' from this site and it went very well with this dish. Just one question... where does the sugar go? It's not in the instructions... I skipped it and it didn't seem like anything was lacking any sweetness, so I'm not sure what the purpose of it is. Very good, thank you!!!

What a unique way to do manicotti! My kids liked this dish and my hubby raved, too. I didn't have any fresh crab on hand, but had a fish filet leftover that had a crab stuffing in it and so I chopped that up and used it with the filling. Also, didn't have big shells or manicotti noodles so layered it like a lasagna. Was great tasting! I'll make this again.

Tried this once, exactly as writen, was good, but was missing some stuff.
Next time I tried it, I doubled the sauce so it completely covered the pasta - used jumbo shells instead. The more sauce kept the shells from getting dry while baking. Also added some sherry to the sauce and some more spices to crab/cheese mix: more basil, little oregano, anything to taste. Turned out very good! I used Phillips brand claw crab meat, no shell pieces in it! Very tasty!

This was awesome! My husband thought we were at Olive Garden. I followed the recipe almost exactly adding more crab than called for as I love crab, and I made my own alfredo sause. This will be on my next dinner party menu.

I've made this recipe twice, both times using west coast dungeness crab. The first time, I made it as directed with the alfredo sauce. The filling was very good but I didn't particularly like the flavor of the sauce with it. The second time, I made the filling the same but used marinara sauce instead on top. I liked this second version much better. In my opinion, the marinara sauce compliments the creamy filling much better than the alfredo sauce does.

I made this dish and it was really good.  I added my own twist to it.  The crabmeat and cheese I added some spicy seasoning (not too spicy) garlic powder and onion powder.  And with the Alfredo sauce, I used Bertillo w/mushrooms.  After stuffing the shells I had about 2 tablespoons of crabmeat and cheese left over so I added it to the Alfredo sauce along with some shrimp.  It was very good.  Will make it again.

OMG! So very delicious. I gave 4 stars only because I made some modifications based on others' reviews and don't think it would have been as good without them. I doubled the crab, used 15 ounces of ricotta, added an egg, added about 1/2 cup of mozzarella, and also topped with about a cup of mozzarella during the last 5 minutes of baking. Restaurant/fine dining quality!!

This recipe is so easy and tastes like something you would order from an authentic italian restaraunt on the 'Hill' in St. Louis.  The only change I've made is instead of using canned crab meat (because I can only find minced)I use the frozen imitation crab meat, and cut it up. It's sooo yummy!!

Good recipe.  I definitely add some sort of fresh Romano or Parmesan cheese to it whilst baking.  Also, I love mushrooms, so I take the saucepan and cook some mushrooms that have been quartered in the residue, sometimes adding a little butter.  It's a nice side.  Fresh garlic was good too, in the original sauce.

We didn't use the shells, but actual manacotti rolls and we substituted chicken since the company did not like crab.  WOW- I love this recipe.  It was a bit difficult working with the noodle itself, but the rest was pie.  YUMMY!

Yummy!  My fiance and I both really liked this recipe.  I think it would be much better with fresh crab (although more expensive).  I didn't get much of that seafood taste.  I will also use more sauce and more flavoring in the stuffing next time.

Great recipe that's not too diff from the ordinary but a nice change of pace.  While the Manicotti was baking I took the pan I heated the sauce in and added butter to saute some mushrooms in.  Was a nice added touch.  Also ten minutes before it was done I topped it with an italian cheese blend I picked up at Sam's Club.  A bit strong but also was a nice addition.

Excellent dish! I actually skimped & used imitation crabmeat (I know..). But it was still absolutely delicious! 
Pair it with a crisp chardonnay spritzer and you have a go!

Very Good - we actually used fresh crab legs left over from dinner the night before (every Sunday is Steak night).  I changed the spices in the sauce to white pepper, lemon pepper, and a little cayenne (we like it spicy).

This is a good recipe, but it won't fill 8 manicotti shells even when doubled. This is also very time consuming. I used the alfredo sauce form this web site called- Alfredo Sauce. I also omitted all the herbs for the sauce, as it was good enough the way it was.

My boyfriend and I thought this was absolutely delicious and very filling! I followed some of the advice from the reviewers and used jumbo shells instead and made some extra sauce. I also added some mozzarela in with the ricotta along with some frozen chopped spinach and chopped red bell peppers and it was delicious! Fresh garlic is a good idea too! I highly recommend this recipe.

It was a really great dish and very fun!! I unfortunately didn't have manicotti shells so I just used manicotti!! It turned out great and after I followed this recipe I started to get creative... like replacing ricotta chz with mozzarella and a little mayo!!  My boyfriend is a big garlic lover so I even mash in some fresh garlic ;) It's a great dish if you have some time on a lazy Sunday! Thanks for sharing :)
