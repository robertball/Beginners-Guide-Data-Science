I have been searching the net for a good Tortilla Soup recipe and have finally found it.  I highly recommend this recipe to everyone.  It's delicious.

This is very good and easy to make.  I left out the bell pepper and cayenne pepper to make it more kid friendly.  Everyone loved it.

I used canned vegetable broth to make this recipe vegetarian, and it worked well.
