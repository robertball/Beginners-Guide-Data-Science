For a lower fat version of this recipe, substitute frozen whipped topping (like cool whip) for the whipped cream, but don’t use fat free (frozen topping or sour cream), it won’t set up. Make sure to store the cake in the refrigerator before serving.

I liked the taste of this dessert, but the presentation was awful! The cake sort of melted and slid into a messy, un-attractive blob. I would suggest cutting the cake into serving slices, THEN top with the fruit, and cream.
