The cookie part tasted similar to a brownie and baked up fluffy (perhaps due to the sour cream) rather than flat. The chocolate frosting that goes with it tasted strongly of coffee so I would suggest decreasing the amount of coffee or tasting it as you add more. It tasted pretty good but I'm not a huge chocolate fan. My husband said they're unique.:)

These were just okay. I got 61 teaspoon-size cookies. Since there were no photos when I found this recipe on here I was expecting a smooth round ball-type cookie. However these spread out on the sheet (an inch apart was way too close!) and they had a rough texture similar to a drop biscuit. They also did taste sort of like a biscuit but with some chocolate flavor. There was not a very strong chocolate flavor at all which disappointed me... especially after using expensive Ghirardelli 86% baking chocolate on these. I chose not to waste any more ingredients by frosting them. So the kids are eating them as is. I will not make them again though.

Baked these cookies following the recipe. I did not frost them. Found them too cake-like with a tangy/sour aftertaste. Sorry I won't be making again.
