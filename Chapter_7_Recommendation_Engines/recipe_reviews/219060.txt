Delicious and easy to make.  I let my cream cheese set out to room temperature and added a little extra pumpkin spice.  I also used a regular sized muffin/cupcake pan and made my own crust with graham cracker and butter.

Great recipe!  I cut all the ingredients in half, and was able to make 48 mini (bite size) cheesecakes using a graham cracker crust.  Lined my mini cupcake pan with mini liners, combined one cup graham cracker crumb with 4 tablespoons of butter and 4 tablespoons of sugar, and pressed into the bottom of each liner.  Spooned pumpkin cheesecake mixture into each cup - filled almost to the top.  Then baked for 15 minutes.  Came out perfect!

Awesome recipe!  Very easy and the mini pie crusts are super convenient.  Made these for my hubby to take to work for this coworkers and he deemed them "too good" to take in - he wanted them for himself!  If you want to make something unique for a potluck or bake sale, this is an excellent choice!

Very tasty and simple! My co-workers who do not like pumpkin anything loved these! If you're on a budget then I recommend using cupcake tins and putting a gingersnap, vanilla wafer, or some other homemade cheesecake crust in the bottom. The Keebler mini tins run around $2.50 for a pack of 6, making it about $10 for the crust alone (you could make a whole other batch for less than that).

Great recipe, and so easy!  The only thing I did differently was use a gingersnap cookie as the base  for each cheesecake - quick, easy and added extra flavor.

A vanilla wafer cookie can also be used as the crust.  How easy is that?

This is by far the most delicious pumpkin flavored anything! I too let my cream cheese sit out for about an hour, sifted the dry ingredients together before adding to the fluffed cream cheese. Also, I made my own graham cracker crusts and baked these in a muffin pan. They got RAVE reviews!!

I made this recipe last night for Thanksgiving today. I followed the directions exactly except I made a miniature one with a mini vanilla wafer cookie for the crust, and a cupcake size one with a gingersnap cookie for the crust just placed them right at the bottom of the cupcake  and mini size paper cups, added whip cream, drizzled with caramel sauce, and sprinkled with cinnamon. Both turned out great! the best part is it was really easy and I didn't spend the time making the crust. Try it! You won't be disappointed!

These were a hit at work and home! I used gingersnap cookies as my base -just plopped them in the bottom of the muffin tin (I used paper muffin cups but baking spray would work too). I left out the cloves and the pumkin spice since I didn't have any. I just doubled the nutmeg and cinnamon and added some ground ginger (about 1/2 to 1 tsp). I beat the cream cheese for at least 2 minutes and beat really well after each egg -this made it super smooth and creamy. Made waaaaaaay more than 24 muffin cups. I'll be making this again for sure!

I couldn't find the mini graham crusts so I used mini (appetizer-sized) pastry crusts. I made 36 mini cheesecakes and still had about 2/3 of the batter left over, so I made a quick shortbread crust (because I had those ingredients on hand) and made a full-sized cheesecake, as well as 12 small cakes in a muffin tin! The cakes tasted good and weren't super-rich. All in all, good and easy recipe. And they freeze well too!

Huge Hit! Perfect in the mini muffin pan for a bite size sweetness when you are stuffed on turkey and side dishes.   I actually used the mini- muffin pans and it made >100.  I would half the recipe if I made this again.  Since the gingersnap cookie didn't fit, I crushed it and added just enough butter to make a crust.  (I did 1 1/2 cups crushed cookies and 1/3 cup of butter ~ I will do half of this next time.)

So Yummy! It was my first time baking a cheese cake, and for a first timer, this receipt I find very easy to follow! Made them for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it! Made my own graham crust and also substitute canned pumpkin with fresh pumpkin puree.

I scaled this down to 6 servings. It made 6 Keebler graham tarts and 12 mini tarts that I used crushed finger snaps in the bottom of mini muffin wrappers. I followed the recipe and the results were fantastic!  Thank you for the tasty treats!

This is a delicious cheesecake recipe that is a little bit lighter than normal cheesecake. I cut the recipe in half and made this as a regular, full-size cheesecake using the larger size Keebler graham cracker crust instead of the mini graham cracker crusts. It was the perfect amount of filling for the crust. I baked it at 350 for 35-40 minutes, let it cool and then refrigerated it overnight. To serve it I topped it with whipped cream and a sprinkling of ground cinnamon.  It turned out great and looked pretty on the plates!

This recipe is great! But beware: like another reviewer said, it makes wayyyyy more than 24 servings! I ended up making double that with this recipe. I didn't have any more graham cracker crusts, so I just made some crustless.

So yummy!! I made these with my swerve sweetener (zero sugar) omg sooooo good!!!  And for my crust I mixed almond flour and melted butter,  cooked the crust first .  So delighted it came out yummy!!!! Go Keto!!! You can turn pretty much any desert into Keto with using swerve sugar instead.  It’s the best one on the market that tastes like real sugar.  I also didn’t add the flour they called for.   I took a bite so you can see what the inside looks like.  Light, buttery and the spices make you feel like fall has arrived.  I just made the whipped topping with heavy cream and swerve confectioners sugar for some sweetness and a dash of cinnamon on top.  Enjoy

I cut the recipe in half, and somehow ended up with an extra pie, but no complaints here! This is perfect.  Everything is well balanced,  and not overpowering. The kids are swooning over it. I'm honestly not sure how long these are gong to last,  lol.

Just made this and it smells great!  I used cupcake liners and made my own graham cracker crust.  Based on other reviews, I thought I would have tons of batter but I really only had enough for 30.  I guess I filled the liners up pretty high.

I followed the recipe exactly and these came out really good. I will definitely make these again :)

The cream cheese is easier to work with if it's at room temperature.

These were good.  I only made 6 so I scaled it down as I was just cooking for my family.  I've had better cheesecake but for what they are they worked.

So easy and delicious!  Tasted like a richer pumpkin pie, not too "cheesy."
