I did  slightly brown the brats (for appearance sake) before simmering in the beer mixture.  This was pretty good, but in the future, I would reduce the brown sugar to 1 tsp and maybe even throw the brats on the grill briefly to get some grill marks on them.  In my opinion, the sauerkraut will yield 4 servings, not 6, particularly if you serve the brat on the top of it.  Certainly was quick to make, and will be made again.

What an amazing recipe! I had everything I needed for beer brats but the buns, so I decided to make a casserole of sorts. The beer glaze is fabulous. I, like the author, was always looking for beer brats with more of a beer flavor, and this is definitely it! The only changes I made was omitting the onion powder for grilled onions and browning the brats for a few minutes. I also transferred everything to a foil pan and baked it for 10-15 mins. at 350 degrees to let the flavors meld a little. Served it with a little jalapeno mustard on the side and it was a huge hit with the guys that came over for football. Will file this one away for future use.

This was a hit with my guests, but I did make a couple of changes to it, which is why I felt it deserving of 4 rather than 5 stars. I skipped the brown sugar altogether as others had suggested, omitted the caraway seeds since I had none and in step #3, I added a big healthy squeeze of spicy brown mustard. Also, use a hearty beer, not a light beer, and you should let it sit open for awhile before cooking so it gets flat.

Terrific recipe.  I made this recipe for a dinner party and all of my guests loved it!!  I did make some changes to the recipe since I had to make it to serve 20 people.  First, I did not find caraway seeds at the grocery store but the flavor turned out amazing without it.  I also just browned the brats on a large skillet and transferred them to a baking dish with the beer sauce and baked them.  In another baking dish, I added 2 large ladles of the beer sauce and the sauerkraut and baked it for 10 minutes.  I just served the sauerkraut and brats together.  The sauce was not thick like a syrup but it had a great consistency and it was delicious. Everyone raved about it and wanted seconds.

These were wonderful.  My sauce didn't get syrupy but it did reduce.  I pushed the brats aside and put the sauerkraut in the pan.  Placed the lid back on and stirred the kraut with the brats.  FANTASTIC!

found this recipe on Pintrest as my husband wanted brats and kraut for father's day.  based on other reviews, browned them first, used real onion other than powder.  No one here likes caraway, so left that out, but brats and kraut were so flavorful!  Paired with my grandmother's German potato salad recipe and supper was a WINNER!!!!  This recipe.....definately a keeper.

I just use the beer, black pepper, brown sugar (slightly more than called for), dill weed, brats and kraut.  I throw in a couple cloves of minced garlic.  Love these with cheddar, diced onions and mustard.   I used Mikey's Malt Liquor for the beer.

Just made this recipe for an Oktoberfest party and it was marvelous.  I browned the brats first as people recommended and left out the caraway seeds because I didn't have any.  I cooked the brats the day before, slightly underdone.  I let them rest in the refrigerator overnight in the liquid.  I am glad I did this because they were covered with fat.  I skimmed off the fat; cooked the room temperature brats for another 30 minutes(more if you just removed them from the refrigerator)  in the liquid.  Removed the brats onto a warmed serving dish; put the liquid in a gravy boat;  wow, amazing.

Braten ist the German word for a roast or roasting

. Wurst ist the German Word for sausage !

Bratwurst means litterly "frying sausage" which means one fries the sausage. But please don't just boil the bratwurst. Then they would be called "Koch-Wurst" :)
p.s. Extra seasonings are not necessary. Just make sure they are nicely browned.

I made this for my family as we had a German dish project we needed to do to complete our study on Germany.  My family  enjoyed this dinner with a side of Fries.  I'd definitely recommend this recipe to others.  I caramelized my 3 onions and sauerkraut  in Salt, cumin, onion powder, brown sugar,dry mustard, butter, apple cider vinegar and plain mustard.  I soaked my Bratwursts in beer for an hour then simmered them on the stove top (in beer) covered for 10 mins. and finished them in the oven for another 15 mins with the french fries while they baked, In the last 3 minutes I topped with Cheddar cheese.  I served hot on Hawaiian buns  topped with onion and sauerkraut. Delicious!!!!  If you boil brawts they tend to split out of the casing, thus the reason for my method of madness with simmering and baking(browns).

We often have brats in my house but no one will usually eat sauerkraut...until now.  My 6 and 10 year old sons ate every bite on their plate.  I did make two small changes, omitted the caraway seeds (didn't have any in the cabinet) and added another t of brown sugar while the kraut was simmering in the pan.  This is definitely one we will be making again!

Followed this exactly, except I browned the brats first. I used Hopsy Dazy for Great South Bay (a New York brewery) and the high hoppy flavor and bitterness was perfect as opposed to a lager. Would definitely recommend this recipe to everyone!

I had to make some changes, but overall it was good. It would not thicken for me so I ended up placing all the ingredients in the crockpot and cooked all day. I added a chopped apple and baby carrots and we did not use buns, rather served it with mashed potatoes!!

Simple and awesome.  Hands down best sauerkraut I've ever had/made.  The brats were great too.  Followed the instructions exactly and it came out terrific - served with homemade pretzels (Papa Drexler's Bavarian Pretzels also on All Recipes) and it made for a great casual dinner.

This is so simple, yet the flavor is wonderful. I'm made no changes and my family, even those who don't normally care for sauerkraut, love the blend of spices, sugar, and beer.

Very easy to make. I didn't have the sauerkraut on hand so the brats were just a tiny bit sweet but very good.

5 stars for the idea, but after 3x trial and improvements for my palat, I have some changes that, to me, make this more flavorful and now a staple in our house:

- double the caraway at least
- double the celery seed
- chop up 1/2 to 1 whole white onion and put in the pan with the brats and beer+seasoning in the first step during 10min simmer. Leave them in the pan for the rest of prep. Adds some extra texture to the kraut and absorbs seasonings. Delicious.
- IMO, no need for sugar. I personally dont like sticky sweet food at all. This recipe is AMAZING without any sugar. You can still brown and crisp the brats with some extra time after the beer evapirates. But to each their own, of course!

Great recipe especially if you tweak the seasoning to suit what you like! Thanks!

My only recommendation would be to use a dark beer rather than a lager.  I used Yeungling Black & Tan, and it was fantastic.  The Black & Tan really gave it a more intense flavor.

Great recipe!!

This is like the  combination of two old family recipes. Zeli - Czech sweet sauerkraut, and brats cooked in beer and onions. I cook the brats separately for 1 1/2 hours in beer and onions. The onions carmalize. You have to add beer while you do this. The fat is cooked out and the flavor is fantastic. Old Milwaukee way of cooking brats. Been doing it like this for generations

Thank you! This was wonderful. I would mention that the Pre cooked brats don’t get the full flavor of the sauce as the uncooked do. I also added whole mustard seeds and it has been delicious every time. My husband likes it with roasted potatoes, Swiss beer cheese, and curried ketchup for dipping... the best leftovers ever!

Used what available spices I had in the pantry, added grolsch beer in the cooking and turned out real nice. Great with a good potato salad. Will make again.

I used elk brats and sometimes these can be dry due to the lack of fat, cooking them with this recipe resulting in very tender and juicy brats! The flavor was perfect, not too overwhelming, just right. Reheated for dinner, just added more beer to add liquid to warm in same pan prepared and it was delicious

I followed the recipe (though I did brown the outside of the brats in a skillet) and found the meal to be good but not great. The sauerkraut has an unusual taste, different from any other recipe I've tried. It is not a bad taste, or a great taste, just a good and very different taste. The brats, however, were wonderful.

Delicious! I browned the brats first and didn't crush the caraway or celery seeds.  Served with mashed potatoes,  very good naturally gluten-free meal.

I doubled the sauce after everyone said it didn't make enough.  I think it would have been better maybe 1.5x the original amount because 2x made it a little soupier than I would like it to be. I also did less sugar than it called for (4 tblsps) and thought it still had a good sweet/sour balance.  I loved it and would make it again, my husband hated it (but he is not a huge vinegar fan).

I brown the brats for a good while before adding the mixture, and use a little less brown sugar, sometimes leaving it out entirely, and add a good amount of spicy brown mustard. Love how it turns out and tastes!!! Great recipe!

I made this exactly as written in ARMagazine.  We did not care for this recipe.  I will not make again.  The brats might have had more flavor if browned first.  We love sauerkraut but not in this recipe.  Seems like a waste of beer also.

very easy to make. I took some advice from previous reviews-browned the sausages and omit brown sugar, but want to try with a bit of brown sugar next time.

I'm ABSOLUTELY making this again. We used Yuengling for the beer and it was perfect. We did use the maker's suggestion and put it on rolls with Swiss cheese and a sweet and hot mustard.  We also crisped the rolls. No need to make changes. Fantastic.

Love this recipe. Very flavorful. I browned the brats before the spices and beer went in and used fat tire amber ale to simmer. I dont know how much different beers would change the flavor but this was amazing

I saw Hannah Hart make this on *My Drunk Kitchen* and I thought I would give it a shot. It was pretty good, but the glaze was a little thin, so it really just tasted like brats (not a bad thing), and I'm not sure it was necessarily worth 45 min. of cooking and prep. If I try it again, I might let the glaze reduce a little more to thicken it up.

Yes, Yes Yes!!   What a great recipe.   I did brown the brats first before simmering.  Didn't have celery seed so I used celery salt.   I added a teaspoon of minced garlic to the beer mixture, and I suggest that you start with 1/2 teaspoon of brown sugar and then add to taste.   I probably ended up with  a little more than 1/2 tablespoon.  I plan on increasing the servings and putting in a crock pot to keep warm at the next party.

I made this exactly as written and it was way too sweet. It may have been my fault however, for using a porter beer. It was delicious beer, but NOT in this dish. I'd probably cut out the sugar altogether if I made this again. Sauerkraut has a good flavor typically, but this recipe it's the sugar and porter beer destroyed that :/ Maybe I'll try it again one day. Oh, and I served it on toasted potato rolls, but they just turned to a soggy mess after the sauerkraut was added to them.

Left out the celery seed and fennel seeds because my husband has problems with seed digestion. I added 1/4 cup fresh apple cider. The recipe was a hit!  Definitely will make again. I recommend serving with either spatzle or mashed potatos.

Just made this & it's really good. I cut brats (turkey) lengthwise then browned them before I put the liquid mix in. When I took out the brats, put in the kraut, some thin sliced Vidalia onions & thin sliced cabbage. Tossed in the sauce & let heat thru. Added the brats back. Served with some thick Pretzels I bought & of course mustard. Great Oktoberfest dish!
