Very good. Had a wonderful texture and didn't feel filling at all. When making the custard, you didn't say wheather or not to stir while cooking. It seemed to take forever without stirring. Also, do you stir in the ice cream or just let it melt in? Do you cool the filling on the counter or in the fridge before pouring into pie shell? Overall the pie was delicious. Instead of a regular pie crust, I used a chocolate cookie crust. Tasted just like an OREO>
