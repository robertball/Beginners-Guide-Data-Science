I have made this recipe a couple of times now.  The first time I subbed cream cheese instead of the half and half.  It came out delicious.  Second time I made it as the recipes reads and it was just as delicious.

Take my review with a grain of salt since I made a major change.... I had about 4 C of broth leftover from the Slow Cooker Apple Cider Pot Roast recipe. Since the broth consisted of beef drippings and apple cider, this seemed the perfect recipe to utilize the broth. I halved the recipe, which meant I needed 5.75 C of liquid. I felt like the leftover broth had a strong enough apple flavor, so I added 1.75 C of beef stock instead of chicken stock or apple cider. I didn't add the cinnamon or cloves, since the leftover broth already had both in it. I also forgot to put the garnish on when I served it. This was really different. 7 people tried it: 4 really liked it, 2 thought it was okay, and 1 didn't care for it. I'm giving it 4 stars since most liked it (including me!).
