I substituted all of the oil for 1 cup of unsweetened applesauce and it was FANTASTIC. This bread is moist and tasty.

This is a delicious bread--the only change I made was to use 1/2 c. brown sugar in place of 1/2 c. white sugar, and I left out the nuts but will add them next time. I will use this recipe as a nice change from zucchini bread.

Delicious! I replaced half the oil with applesauce, half the white sugar with brown, and half the flour with whole wheat flour.  I also doubled the vanilla.

Everyone loved this.  I left the pear pieces a little on the large side & it made the bread a litle soggy the next day- next time I'll either cut the pears into smaller pieces or use less ripe pears.

I baked this recipe in a bundt pan, and it is just 
good as in a loaf. It's a really nice brunch
bread.

This bread is EXCELLENT!  I omitted the pecans and reduced the fat with 
applesauce.  I was so impressed with the first loaf that I made three more 
today to freeze.  Thanks for a wonderful fall recipe.

This was a very tasty way to use up some extra pears from a friend's tree.

I did not have to bake mine an hour - only about 45 minutes did it.  Delicious!

Very good bread, moist and easy to make. I made it as written and I give 4 stars since I thinkk it was a bit to much oil. Which is great to keep the bread moist for a longer period of time, but the end result was a little too oily. The bottom of my finished bread was glistening and semi-wet from oil. I will do 50/50 oil and applesauce next time or reduce oil to 2/3 cup. Be careful not to use overly ripe pears that are running with juice or else you'll get a soggy bread. I used ripe but still firm pear, 2 pears are plenty, and coarsely chopped them. Great Fall bread.  Will make again.

I cut this recipe back to ten servings. I made an omelette with egg whites which means I had an egg yolk to use in another recipe. Not really a halved egg but it worked with what I needed without any waste. I also did not have any pecans on hand. To make up the half cup, I added in one half cup of ground oats. I just threw the oats in the mini food processor and pulsed until it was a fine consistancy, almost like whole wheat flour. Those were the only changes I made. I actually got 12 bigger-sized muffins out of this recipe. I baked them at 350 for 20 minutes. They turned out nicely--moist and the right amount of pear. I'd like to make these again but I think I'd increase the spices next time.

I had the idea to make a pear gift basket for Christmas Gifts. (Pear bread, preserves, fruit and a candle)  I have been searching for a great recipe.  I found it on my second try!  I will definitely keep this recipe in my box permantently.  I did make a few substitutions based on recommendations I had read in other reviews.  
1c sugarfree applesauce instead of oil (makes it moist), 1c brown sugar sub for 1c white sugar, add 1/2 tsp ground ginger.  When trying this recipe, I baked 1 loaf in a glass pan and 1 loaf in a stoneware pan.  Definitely go with the stoneware pan.  It baked more evenly and retained moisture better.

I followed another reveiwer's advice and baked it in a bundt pan instead of loaf pans.  I was worried that the batter wouldn't all fit in the bundt pan, but it worked fine.  I added an extra 10 minutes to the baking time.  I sent it and a stick of butter to work with my husband.  He said that it's so good that it doesn't need any butter on it.  People who wanted "only a small piece" snuck back in for seconds and thirds.  Nice, easy, tasty recipe.

This is one of my favorite quick bread recipes; the flavor of the pears and nutmeg with pecans is perfect.  I have used walnuts, but it just isn't the same.  I love the crisp, sugary crust that bakes on the outside--I've thought about reducing the sugar, but didn't want to mess up that crust!  Great warm, out of the oven, with butter.

When I made this bread, it did not taste like pears AT ALL!  The texture was nice, moist...the flavor nice,sweet but not like pears!  I may use this recipe again with barlett pears instead of the bosc pears that I used and I would add some pear extract or pear nectar if I were to try it again.

Very sweet bread, next time I will only use 1 1/2 c. sugar or less. I probably will make this again tomorrow due to all the pears we have, and I'm going to add some brandy to the batter also, I'll update my review when I'm done.

Wonderful bread recipe!  It took 3 diced pears to yield 2 1/2 cups.  One of my pears was overripe and resembled a thick applesauce once diced.  However, it seemed to have the same effect as applesauce in a bread too...it turned out a very moist and delicious loaf.  I was worried about us being able to eat two whole loaves, since it's just the two of us and we have limited freezer space, but my boyfriend keeps going back for more and it's going FAST!  Thanks for sharing Anna!

Great.  I did modify a bit to my preferences (less sugar, more cinnamon, etc..) The major difference was that I grated the pears, which made it a nice and moist texture even though I decreased the oil by 1/3 cup.  I also grated in a little fresh ginger.

This was a good recipe to help me get started with my own version.   I took other people's advice and substitute applesauce for the oil; used 1/2 c brown sugar in place of 1/2 cup of sugar (I actually used 1 1/2 c of splenda instead of sugar).  I also used 1c whole wheat flour in place of 1c all purpose flour and threw in a tsp of flaxseed.  Also used 1 tsp of almond extract because I didn't have any vanilla and I didn't use any nutmeg as I didn't have any on hand.  Turned out great, and healthy, too!  I will try using bananas and other fruits in place of the pears with this recipe from now on.

I found a container of need-to-eat pears for 50 cents at the market today and thought I'd use them up on this recipe. I wanted to make it healthier though so I changed a bit around. I didn't peal the pears and kept the chunks a decent size. This made about 4 cups. I mixed them with 1 cup Equal for baking then let them sit in a strainer for an hour. I added an additional 1/4 cup Equal when mixing the batter, replaced the oil with applesauce, used 1/2 cup oat bran and 2.5 cups of whole wheat flour, didn't use salt, and added 1/2 tsp of ginger. I made mini loafs and they are delicious! The only problem is that I ate 4... so much for being healthy!

This was really good. I had some pears that needed to be used so I was looking for a way to use them. I actually made it as muffins because my kids will eat muffins better than slices of bread. They only had to bake 20 minutes as muffins. I subbed 2 cups of whole wheat flour for 2 of the cups of flour and used 1/2 c. coconut oil and 1/2 c. applesauce in place of the vegetable oil. I also left out the nuts because my kids don't like them. I mixed a little brown sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg together and sprinkled it on the top. Very yummy and very moist.

Had 3 very ripe pears, which helped turn this into a very moist delish cake.  Used half apple sauce and half oil and half brown and half white sugars as recommended by others, and baked in a bunt pan.  My office will delight in this!

I made this a 2nd time, but used almost over ripe pears this time.  They were really juicy so I only used about 3/4 cup of oil.  The bread turned out awesome.  I also made a cream cheese frosting for the bread.  My husband ate 6 muffins by the end of the night!

My bf absolutely loves it. :) I used unsweetened applesauce instead of the butter, cut down on the sugar and skipped the nutmeg, and it still turned out great. Yummy when toasted.

Very versatile recipe!  I had four very ripe pears and couldn't use all of each pear because some were too ripe.  So, like another reviewer - another recipe (?), I added a finely chopped apple.  I used 1/2 brown sugar, 1/2 white sugar.  Also substituted 1/2 cup margarine and 1/2 cup pumpkin for the vegetable oil.  Didn't have nutmeg, so used 1-1/2 tsp. allspice with the cinnamon.  Fearing that the batter would be too watery from the very juicy pears, I added 1 cup raisins to the batter in hopes that they would absorb any extra moisture.  Baked in 2 pans for about an hour and it came out perfect!

I think this bread is wonderful! I cut the pears a bit big the first time so it was a bit soggy but after that it has turned out delicious every time!

Delicious!  Substituted 1 cup applesauce for the oil and added a bit of allspice.  Very tasty. :)

This bread was FANTASTIC! Probably the best I have made yet. I cut the recipe in half and made 1 bread, so due to the fact that 2 breads called for 3 eggs, I choose to use 1 egg because I upped the pears to 2 cups (that's what I had and didn't want to waste them). I subbed the white sugar for sucanat and everything else was the same. The baking time was right on, to the minute! This bread was VERY moist, but not gooey, just perfect with a crunchy top. Even my husband agreed that this bread was GREAT. I will definitely be making this again. Thanks for the recipe!

Minus the pecans I baked as written.  It took the exact 60 min in my oven.  This is so moist and delicious.  I will definitely use this again and again, thanks!

Very good, and easy. Used 1 1/2 cup white sugar, and 1/2 cup brown sugar. Also did 2 tsp Cinn. and 1/4 tsp cardamon. And added a light streusel topping.

I live across the Columbia River from the
'Fruit Loop,' the region in Hood River, Or. where a majority of Northwest fruit originates. I am always on the lookout for great recipes using pears, cherries, and apples.  This is one. The only minor changes I make are to toast the pecans and grate some of the pears and chop some fine, depending on how hard they are.  My mom gives me huge guilt if I don't make it often enough for her to have it in the fridge.

I make a lot of quick breads and this is a good recipe.  The only thing I would change is to use brown sugar as some of the sweetner.  It really adds to the depth of flavor.  Great bread and a good way to use up pears.  Keeper.

I used very overripe (soft) pears leftover from a Harry & David order, and self-rising flour rather than all-purpose+baking soda/powder+salt.

The result was much more like a cake batter than a muffin mix.  I think a whole cup of oil might be too much.  But, they were tasty.

I never liked pears, but my man kept bringing them home. This bread is excellent and made me decide I really DO like pears. Halved the recipe and made a few changes, and the result was really good (NEAR perfect). Used 4 smashed or cut into small chunks d'anjou pears. Drained some of the liquid out of them, as they were very juicy. Used self-rising flour (have no plain) and baking soda but left out the baking powder and all but a couple of shakes of salt. Used Splenda brown sugar subs for half the white sugar and unsweetened applesauce for half the oil. Used one large egg instead of one and a half. The bread was very moist and almost cake-like. I had used just a small amt of salted butter to grease the pan, and part of it stuck to the bottom of the glass pan. I didn't care, as we were eating it, but for guests it would have been unsightly. This pear bread was great, right amt of spice for me, still had that slightly gritty pear texture, just complex enough to be really good. The nutmeg really is great with the pear, in my opinion.

Per other reviewer suggestions, I substituted 1/2 cup applesauce for 1/2 cup of oil to make this healthier.  I also subbed 1 cup brown sugar for 1 cup of the white sugar.  Fantastic!

Banana and zucchini breads do nothing for me, but this one is another story.  Substituted sweetened applesauce that I had on hand for the oil, reduced sugar to 1 cup, used 1 C whole wheat flour & 2 C regular.  Oh, and forgot to add the nutmeg (next time).  Delicious!

Tried it, loved it!  I used half whole wheat flour, half all purpose flour and used my homemade unsweetened applesauce instead of the oil.  I used half white sugar and half brown sugar.  I also sprinkled flax seeds all over the bread before it went into the oven for some extra crunch.  Fantastic recipe!

We have a pear tree in the backyard, and I have made this bread 4 times this season.  I make it exactly as written. Sometimes I put it into regular sized loaf pans, sometimes switch to 4 smaller loaf pans and reduce the cooking time.  Everyone loves it!

I thought this was a good recipe, but it almost tastes like apple bread to me. I made some with cinnamon and some with just nutmeg. I felt the cinnamon covered up any pear flavor and preferred the nutmeg only version. I did add more pears than called for - about 1/2 cup more.

Amazing! Substituted natural applesauce for the oil and only used 1/2 c brown sugar, 1/2 c sugar and it was still delightfully sweet.  Diced the pears pretty small.  Definitely keeping this one!

Fantastic recipe - only thing I changed was replacing 1 cup of sugar with brown sugar.  The bread was moist and delicious.  We stored 1 loaf in a brown paper bag, which helped retain the life of the bread, and froze the other loaf.

This recipe uses about 5 good sized pears. I read all the reviews and substituted (like others about 1/2) brown sugar, whole wheat flour, applesauce. Couldn't wait till it cooled 10 minutes on the wire rack...we ate it warm....yummy!

Very good recipe. Even my nine-year-old liked it. I did not have enough pears and I thought I had walnuts but was mistaken, so I cut the recipe in half and left out the nuts and used 2 eggs. Still turned out great. Baked in amount of time called for.

I left out the pecans and kept the pear chunks quite large. The pear flavour is quite subtle but blends well with the spices. We had this toasted for breakfast this morning. I was planning to freeze the second loaf but there's only half a loaf left. Many Thanks.

I followed this recipe as written.  The only thing was I had to turn the oven down to 320 degrees for about 10 minutes as the outside was getting brown to fast.  I took it to work with a loaf of banana bread (which I thought was the best I've ever had) and the pear bread disappeared first with rave reviews!

I used Splenda instead of sugar and aplpesauce instead of oil.  We all loved it, especially my 4 yr old.  I've never thought to use pears for bread before!

This bread came out really moist with a great taste. The only thing I was disappointed in was that the pear flavor wasn't very strong. I think I'll try a different type of pear next time.

Have now made this a couple times lately as friends tree gifted me with a lot of pears...have made it as per recipe & then followed others advice & had some homemade apple sauce that I used... since not all of my friends can eat nuts I used chocolate chips instead & added ground ginger & cloves ....wonderful... this is a great recipe that can be changed & still comes out great...

I had a LOT of pears to use, so I doubled the recipe. I did one big load in a 9x13 and one normal size loaf. I did lower the cooking temp to 325 since I was making the larger loaf and cooked the larger one a bit longer. After making it, I think I would have turned out fine if I'd left it with 350. Both loaves turned out WONDERFUL and I will definitely be saving this recipe for later :)

Very tasty, but very sweet. I substituted 1 1/2 cup brown and 1/2 white, used applesauce and 2 tablespoons of oil., add 1 cup of pecans. Will make again but less sugar. Thanks for sharing.

I made these to use up some pears that my kids wouldn't eat. Personally, I thought it was a bit bland, but my children enjoyed them. Next time, I will double the spices to see if it makes the flavor pop more.

Very disappointing. I followed a few of the recommended tweaks (1/2 cup applesauce, 1/2 cup oil, 1 cup brown sugar, 1 cup sugar, and an extra 1/2 cup of pears), plus I made an oatmeal pecan streusel topping, and I was extremely unimpressed with the bread itself. It was very bland and definitely lacking something....not quite sure what it's missing, but with all the other amazing recipes on this site, I will not be keeping this recipe.

Even my husband like this one, and he does not care for pears. It is very moist and the pear pieces give it a nice flavor. I followed another reviewer's advice and cut the pears as small as possible. Was out of nutmeg so subbed ginger. This one is a keeper.

I used my frozen pears and split the sugars, 1/2 brown and 1/2 white.  Used canola oil rather than veg oil. Made 5 mini loaves. Turned out great.  Will use this recipe again for sure.  I'm freezing two of the the loaves, so I will let you know.

Wonderful bread. I ended up making 4 loaves with the first 2 being by the recipe and the second 2 I added two very ripe bananas. Yes, it's true you don't really "taste" the pear but pears don't have a strong taste, just very subtle. We thought both types were great. It will be made again in this home.

This bread is SCRUMPTIOUS!! I substituted walnuts for pecans and added a bit more cinnamon than called for.   I happened to have three very ripe pears I needed to use in  a recipe before they became over-ripe.  I chopped into 1/2 inch pieces, which was just right for the recipe.   What a treat!  Thanks so much for sharing!

I made this bread twice.  The 1st time following the directions exactly.  The 2nd time, I used 1/2 oil and 1/2 unsweetened applesauce, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp ginger.  I did not peel the pears and this was fine.  Both ways,  the bread came out delicious.  Great recipe, I am making again tomorrow.

This recipe is super easy and really good.  As others suggested, I used 1/2 cup unsweetened apple sauce and 1/2 cup vegetable oil. I also increased the spices (2 tsp. cinnamon, 1 tsp. freshly ground nutmeg, and 1 tsp. ginger) as that is my personal preferance. I used pears that were still a little hard, and it turned out great.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was good but not great. I used 2 cans of pears, drained. Substituted unsweetened applesauce for oil. Used 1/2 white sugar, half brown sugar. Also, 1 cup whole wheat flour and 2 cups regular flour. It was good, but not one of my favorites. Not really a fan of the nutmeg flavor.

I liked the flavor a lot, but I found it to be a bit too oily.  I made one loaf of bread and some muffins, and the bottoms of both really leave your hands messy.  Next time, I will puree another 1/2 cup or so of pears and substitute for some of the oil.  I used half whole wheat flour, and could not even taste that flavor that sometimes comes with using whole wheat flour.  Next time I will use all (or almost all) whole wheat.

I really liked this.  But I cut the oil down to 2/3 cup and added 1/3 cup of cinnamon apple sauce.  It was just as moist and I didn't miss the extra fat.

Delicious! I didn't change a thing w/this recipe. What a great way to use up pears when they get too mushy to eat. :)

This bread was gorgeous even if I use toasted hazelnut in place of the pecan nut) ( we are not real fans of pecan nut). However, next I will try to put less cinnamon it has  overpassed the taste of pear.

followed recipe exactly, but used a few more pears & didn't cook the entire time.  My pears were not completely ripe & the bread was still delicious.  Very Moist.

Wonderful!  I took the advice of others and substituted applesauce for oil, used half brown sugar and half white, and added a half teaspoon of ginger.  I omitted the nuts, though I used coconut in one of the loaves.  Amazing!

This was a wonderful bread! Thanks for sharing it. I hate when people say "oh I made this change and that," but the fact is we all modify recipes to our own tastes and nutritional requirements, so with that said, I changed this recipe a bit to fit my needs.I used Splenda indstead of sugar(cup for cup) but also added 1/4 more of oil, another egg, 1/2 c. apple sauce, 2 bananas (I always have them lying around), 1 c. milk powder to boost protien content and bulk up the Splenda, and 1 tsp. baking powder. I omitted the nuts, but that is a personal preference.

This is a very easy recipe to follow especially when your pears start going bad - I subbed the sugar with 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar.  Very moist and tasty!!

i added chunky applesauce (instead of oil) and more pears (with the pears cut into decent sized chunks).  this assured a terrific pear flavor in the bread.  wonderful!

This bread was delicious, although the pear taste was a bit subtle. If you don't have a crowd, I recommend halving the recipe becuase the second loaf was very soggy by the time we got to it.

I made this recipe using 1/2 oil and 1/2 unsweetened apple sauce after reading other reviews.  I also used 1/2 light brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar.  I left out the nuts according to my own preference.  I made muffins and topped them with streusel before baking, then baked them for 35 minutes.  They came out perfect and I do believe the streusel was a nice touch.  I also made a 9x5 loaf, and due to the extra baking time required I would not recommend the struesel for the loaf, as it got a little bit dark (it also is a bit messy, too, when the loaf is removed from the pan).  It is a great recipe and I will definitely use it again!

I was very disappointed in this recipe.I used several recommended substitutes like the apple sauce instead of oil.  Pear flavor never came out. It was moist and had great texture but the flavor was not as impressive as I expected.  I used fine quality ripe bosc pears. I think perhaps the apple sauce diluted the pear flavor.  I think next time I will try half the recommended amount of oil and leave out the apple sauce altogether...

I received a fruit basket for Christmas?  What to do with all the fruit?  Search Allrecipes!  This bread is excellent.  I took some suggestion I found here, like substituting 1/2 cup brown sugar for white, substituted 1 cup of wheat flour for all-purpose flour.  I used 2 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice, omitting the other spices, and used 1/2 cup juice from mandrin oranges (had just opened the can for another recipe) and cut back on the vegetable oil. I had to extend the cooking time 10 minutes, perhaps for the orange juice.  I will definetely make this again.

I think this is an awesome recipe. I  replaced 1/2 cup of the white sugar with brown sugar, used coconut instead of pecans and used applesauce. I used apple/mango/peach applesauce as it was all I had on hand from kids lunch treats. The bread turned out awesome.Lots of flavor and very moist.I still have lots of ripe pears and I will definetly be making this again...and again...and again.

A friend gave me a bag full of pears, and I had never really cooked with pears before, but I had to do something, as she gave me so many!  This recipe was awesome.  I made it twice within 2 weeks, following the recipe exactly.  The hubby and kids liked it better without the pecans, but I loved it both ways!  This recipe is a keeper!

I used this recipe for Christmas brunch. Great flavor. As suggested by other reviews, I made some changes to the recipe which I suggest: I substituted applesauce for the 1 cup of oil(this made the bread very moist), increase the pears to 3 cups, substitute coconut for the pecans though I am sure pecans would be great also, and added 1/2 tsp. ginger.

Delicious!! I was feeling lazy so I just threw the pears in the food processor and grated them and it turned out great. I did have to bake for an extra 10 minutes due to the extra juice it created.

This recipe is wonderful.  My in-laws sent us a huge box of pears and I'm not crazy about pear preserves.  I signed on the allrecipes and pulled this up.  It is tremendous. Every year at our church Fall Festival my pear bread loaves sell out first. This is a great fall recipe.

We weren't crazy about this bread. I used barlet pears. I didn't think it was very flavorful and thought it was rather bland. I thought it could use more spices and maybe more pears. I think adding some applesauce as others did would be a good idea, it was missing somthing. Thanks for sharing though.

I used applesauce instead of oil, and because my pears were verrrry ripe, I reduced it to 3/4 c applesauce so the bread wouldn't be runny (per other reviewers comments).  I also reduced the sugar to 1 1/4 cups, and added 1 tsp ground ginger. Otherwise, I made the recipe exactly and it turned out great!  

I baked in an 11x8 glass pan for 25 minutes at 350F.

Thanks to Anna for a great taste treat that combines pears and pecans in a dense, sugary loaf. The All Recipes photo shows it as muffins – and we like it that way – but we are especially fond of it as bread. It makes two 4 X 8" loaves. It's a treat to find pieces of pears embedded in the bread, which can be done as long as they are not too finely or too coarsely chopped.

Unique recipe. I didn't include the pecans cause I'm allergic, still came out fine.  It is a little bit dry might want to add a little more oil. I added some melted butter and cinnamon sugar on top, tastes great!

This turned out very moist and flavorful. I followed some of the other reviews and used 1/2 cup applesauce 1/2 cup of oil and 1 cup of brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar. I baked in my individual bar pan and placed a slice of pear on top of each before baking. It made 24 bars. Yum!!

Changed out the pecans for chopped walnuts and lessened the sugar by 1/2 cup.  Absolutely delicious!

Delicious!  I followed this recipe to the letter other than sprinkling on some course sugar before I put the pans into the oven.  (I highly recommend this!) Will definitely make this again.  Moist, sweet and well-spiced.  Thank you!

Exceptional. I had all the ingredients on hand (although I did tweak it slightly), and it was  rather simple to make. I may make it again, I haven't tested it on the family yet but I'm very pleased with how it came out. 
Tweaks: omitted oil, substituted with  1/2 cup applesauce, 1/4 cup non fat plain greek yogurt and 1/4 cup pure maple syrup. Did half white half brown sugar. One of the three cups of flour I added was wheat. Also added a pinch of clove.

I read numerous reviews and substituted a few items to make the recipe healthier.  Applesauce for the oil, 1-1/2 C sugar (1/2 white and 1/2 brown).  Extra pears. I would add raisins next time.  Made cupcakes instead of bread.  Reduced cook time by 10 minutes and they were a bit over cooked.  I will only cook 30 minutes next time.  Husband and grandkids loved them anyway! I will make again.  We had a bumper crop of pears and this was a great way to utilize them.

The only change I made was putting a few chocolate chips on top a few muffins. These muffins were the Bomb!! I have never baked anything so delicious before..
I cut my pears in big chunks, I use walnuts instead of pecans and put more nutmeg.... Yummy!!!!!!

Tastes like pear,  moist and a nice change.   I pureed the pears like apple sauce consistency.   Definately will make again.

I made this gluten free by using 3cups of King Arthur Gluten free All Purpose Baking Mix for the dry ingredients except the cinnamon and nutmeg.  I used 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon since I was out of nutmeg.  Substituted 1cup applesauce for the oil and used half brown sugar and half white sugar, using scant side of the 1 cup each.  The recipe made 12 nice muffins and a loaf of bread.  Everyone loved it.

I made this, but substituted unsweetened applesauce for the oil, and 2/3 cup maple syrup instead of the sugar. Delicious!  I used a bunt pan and it did fine.

Turned out fine. Tastes fine. But not much a pear flavor. I used 4 Bartlett pears and all the measurements in the recipe. I omitted the pecans simply because I didn't feel like buying them. (haha)  When it came time to mix in the dry ingredients, I got quite the workout, fyi.

I used half brown sugar for a deeper flavour and subbed half of the oil for applesauce. It was so moist and delicious! This is a true treat!

This is a delicious recipe! Three friends have asked for it, as it seems pear breads are unusual and a welcome change from the usual apple or banana bread. I reduced the sugar to 1-¾ cup, and used muffin tins to bake individual servings. Just adjust the baking time. They turned our great!

My husband declared it the best bread ever! Took the advice of others and used combination of white and brown sugar. Used unsweetened applesauce in place of oil. Will definitely make again.

Very good.  I used 1 c of white sugar and 1/2 c of brown sugar.  I don't like things too sweet, so cut back 1/2 c on sugar.
Also used 1/2 c of oil and 1/2 c of vanilla yogurt rather than one c of oil.    For nuts, I used pecans and walnuts half and half.

This is a great recipe. I made it just as written with one exception. I didn't have enough pears and already had everything else started so I added some sugar free applesauce. Bread is yummy.

This was really good. I altered a lot because I was making it for my 87 y/o grandmother who has a lot of dietary restrictions. Replaced 1/2 of the vegetable oil and sugar with homemade no sugar added applesauce. Also, I had homemade pear butter so I used that for the pears. Really good! Can't wait to eat it for the first day of Fall.

Turned out great! Shredded about half the pears and diced the rest. I didn't change anything else and it was very moist and flavorful! Yummy pear chunks in the bread are a treat! Will make again. Great way to use the over abundance of fresh pears from our trees!

My Family loves this bread !!! - I gotta oh yeah you gotta make this again response,  I did do some adjusting tho * I used 1/2c. Cinnamon applesauce & 1/2c. oil instead of a whole cup oil *3 cups pears also *1 1/2c. chopped pecans *a little more vanilla & cinnamon and only cooked it 50 minutes everyones oven is different so toothpick test needed. I chopped some pears smaller & some larger. It came out very moist & delicious  I  will definitely make this again it's a definite winner :)

I made this recipe as is and thought it was delicious!  I find it funny when people change the recipe and then rate it poorly.  Stick to the original and it will be moist and yummy!  (maybe my pears were more flavorful or ripe, but I could taste the pear flavor and loved it!)

Someone gave me a bunch of green pears, so after letting them ripen a few days in a sack, I grated them. I followed the rest of the recipe exactly, and it was wonderful. I agree, it doesn't taste strongly of pear. Perhaps the nutmeg overpowers the pear flavor. Nonetheless, it was a delicious loaf. I can't wait to experiment with wheat flour, and less sugar... Maybe even substitute honey. Thanks for the recipe. My family loved it! This is definitely a keeper.

Don't double recipe unless you have a really big bowl. I added a little more vanilla and baked it a little longer. Next time I will add chocolate chips.

Yum! This was so moist, sweet and comforting...and I don't even like pears! I used 1 1/2 cups of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar to make it a little richer. So good!!!

Made this today!! I made it into 12 large muffins though. I did as others suggested and used apple sauce instead of oil and half white sugar half brown sugar. Will definitely make again if friends of mine have too many pears from their trees! Perfect use for them!!

Excellent! Reduced serving size to 10, which made 8 mini tea loaves. Changes I made were subbing applesauce for oil, used 1 cup white/1 cup whole wheat + 2 tablespoons whole wheat flour, and 1 cup brown sugar with 1/3 cup + 1 tablespoon white sugar. Topped each mini tea loaf with chopped pears and sprinkling of pecans before putting in the oven, and after baked, dusted with confectioner's sugar. I was headed to a family reunion of eight, and the mini tea loaves made a wonderful gift for each person!

I made muffins from this recipe - 350 degrees for 22 minutes.  I substituted 1/4 cup of applesauce for 1/4 cup of the oil and they came out very moist and tasty.  Going by what recipes usually call for in quick bread/muffin recipes, I mixed the wet and dry ingredients just until combined.

I've made this a few dozen times as jumbo muffins instead of loaves. A single batch yields 10 jumbo. Reduced sugar by 1/2 cup depending on how sweet the fruit is already and did an even mixture of brown and white sugars. The amount of fruit depends on how ripe it is. I find 3c is a minimum. Also replaced 1/2 cup oil with sour cream for extra moisture. I have done pears and pecans as well as apples and walnuts. I top them with a crumb mixture of equal parts sugar, flour, oatmeal and cold butter cut in with a pastry blender then sprinkle in 1t cinnamon . I bake muffins at 400 for the first 10 minutes to get that big bakery-style cap, then bump down to 325 for a remaining 15-25 minutes or until done.

I hate when people change recipes on their first try .....but... I made some modifications because I didn't have the ingredients. So instead of all vegetable oil ( I ran out exactly half way) I used 1/2 vegetable oil and half coconut oil... As well I used half brown sugar and half coconut sugar ( are u getting an idea of what's in my pantry?!) I also skipped the nuts because my kids can't have them.....although I think they would be yummy. The recipe came out these smooth molasses-y breads super yummy! I did teduce the time a little and the batter when mixed is very thick. I'd definately make them again, I'll try just a is next time with the right ingredients... But this way worked.

Wow!!! Family loved it. Said it reminded them of comfort and Christmas. I did trade half of the oil with applesauce and half the white sugar with brown sugar. Another winner!

We shred our pears instead of chopping - they tend to get a little gooey when left in chunks (after the bread has been baked).  We leave out the nuts, just a preference, but a great and different quick bread to switch up the same old same old.

Awesome! I didn't have any nuts but it still turned out wonderful. I was also a bit short on oil but it was still extremely moist. Brought it to a study group and it was devoured! Wonderful recipe!

Made a couple of recommended changes.  Used applesauce in place of 1/2 of the oil and used Canola oil and used 3/4 cup light brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar.  Very moist!  One loaf was gone before dinner!  So good when warm.

I subbed the oil for cinnamon applesauce, white sugar with brown sugar (a little less), and 1/2 cup flour with flax seed meal.  This made me add a tad of grape seed oil because batter seemed a little thick.  These are great for breakfast!

Have made this recipe a number of times now and find this is best with just one cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup of white, and then I sprinkle some cinnamon and sugar on top before baking which gives the crust an even nicer texture. I have a mix of apples and pears that were picked and frozen from my friends' trees, and just chop them (still frozen)in the food processor until they are still pretty chunky but fairly even in size and the loafs bake up perfectly. Doesn't last more than a couple of days in my house, a perfect Fall treat.

We've enjoyed this so far, I did as another suggested and used all the batter to fill a bundt pan.  Baked it for 70 minutes and it was perfect.  The pears I used were fresh, but still pretty hard, so they stayed together well.  I did add about a 1/2 t ground ginger, think next time I'll try fresh.  I replaced half of the oil with applesauce, mostly because I had an almost empty jar taking up room in the fridge.  Last thing I did was to use about one third whole wheat instead of the all-purpose.  I think next time I'd like to try adding some cardamom too.

I followed it exactly! Loved it!! The pears are not over powering but not understated. I only prepared my pears differently. I halved and cored them and shredded them in my food processor. I also let them sit in my sieve for as bit bc there was as lot of extra juice. I did this bc I wanted a more all over pear flavor, not just a "Ooooo I got a pear in that bite" bread lol. Just a great, tasty, moist bread! (also my pears were fresh from the orchard)

I didn't have shredded pears but I did have homemade "pear sauce" (steamed pears then strained). I omitted the oil and used 3 cups total of the pear sauce. Used homemade candied pecans. Turned out beautiful! Nice and Moist...my boys love it!!!

This is  a great recipe!...for a lighter version I used 2/3 of a cup of brown sugar and 2/3 white rather than 2 cups of white sugar, 1/2 oil and 1/2 apple sauce rather than 1 cup of oil, doubled the vanilla and 2 cups of whole wheat flour and 1 cup of white and 1 cup of walnuts! Will try Greek yogurt next time rather then oil, this will cut back on the kcal a lot!

Really good, I too substituted 1/2cup applesauce for 1/2 cup of oil, also 1 cup of brown sugar for 1 cup of white sugar.  Along with this I folded in 2 cups of chocolate chips just before baking.  Wow what a hit this bread was to my family!

This is a nice breakfast bread.  I used a cup of applesauce in place of the oil.  Since my applesauce was sweetened already, I cut the sugar in half.  The bread is moist and delicious.

Good recipe. Made as followed, with the exceptions of replacing oil with unsweetened appleasauce, and using whole wheat and ultragrain flours in place of the white.  I made them into muffins-- 350 degrees for about 18-20 minutes worked for me. Very good.

updated from my other review, the bread was amazing! The changes that I made, made the bread turn out amazing. I will be doing this recipe again, but experiment with different baby foods. Thanks for this recipe. And, someone mentioned it having a nice sugar crust, and even nocking down the sugar down a lot, there is still a lovely sugar crust!

These (I made the recipe into muffins) were a huge hit with the whole family. As other reviewers suggested, I used applesauce in place of half the oil and brown sugar in place of half the white sugar. Next time I'd only use about 1.5c of sugar, as they were a bit on the sweet side. No need to peel the pears. 375 for 20 minutes for muffins.

I had some super ripe pears to use, so I gave this a try making muffins, and loved them. I did double the vanilla and cinnamon, halved the sugar (and did brown and white sugar mixed), and used half cup oil, 3/4 cup applesauce.....yummy!

This recipe is so moist! There aren't a lot of recipes out there for pears and this is one of the best ones I have ever found. I only used 1/2 cup of oil and it was still so moist.

I used 3 cans of pears and left it chunky. Delicious!! I also went light on the sugar (maybe 1 1/2 cups) and it was still nice and sweet.

LOVE! I made one loaf and one dozen muffins. Loaf took about an hour and the muffins took about 45 mins in my oven. I cut the sugar to 1 1/2 cups, but instead used half brown sugar and half white sugar. Used 1/2c oil and 1/2c homemade applesauce. Though super yummy, I didn't get the carmalized top cause I cut down the sugar. Next time, I'll use full 2c of sugar to get that special top. This recipe would be good with a variety of different fruits. I can't wait to make it with apples or bananas!

Like others, I made some substitutions/additions:

1 cup applesauce for 1 cup vegetable oil,
2 cups brown sugar for 2 cups granulated sugar,
3 cups pears instead of 2 1/2 cups pears,
1 teaspoon ground clove.

I suggest using fully ripened pears (this is standard for most baking recipes).

Really moist and delicious - a tad sweet, but great as a coffee cake.  I made two rounds and froze on for a month, and it tasted just as great!

This bread turned out great.I doubled the cinnamon and added a cup of shredded zucchini which I thought was really good in this bread.I also added about a half cup of frozen blueberries to the second loaf just because I love blueberries.I used applesauce for half the oil and it still turned out extremely moist.The pear taste is very subtle in this but I really like the spiciness of the bread.Great recipe!

I made this recipe once for a potluck and never got to taste it because it was eaten so fast, so I made it again for myself and I was glad I did because mmm this bread is SO DELICIOUS. Following some other reviewers' advice, I replaced the oil with applesauce. The pear flavour is really subtle and the applesauce can overpower it, so don't be timid about overdoing it with the pears. I used quite a lot, and the bread took a bit longer to cook, but it was worth it. I also omitted the salt and the pecans (because I never have pecans around), and the bread was fine without them.

Wonderful! This is a great way to use pears that are becoming ripe to fast, and a great quick bread recipe. I did make a few substutions-1/2 cup brown sugar for white sugar, 1/2 cup butter for vegetable oil, and I added about 3/4 cup chopped fresh cranberries for color and flavor. I will definitely be making this again soon.

This recipe was really good, my husband and kids can't stop eating them.  I did alter it a bit though.  Instead of 1 cup of oil, I used 1 cup of unsweetened applesauce and walnuts instead of pecans (I was out of pecans).  Plus I put the batter in muffin tins instead of a bread pan.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks!

I really liked this bread. I did change a couple of things. Instead of oil I used same amount of chunky applesauce and the sugar I used 1 cup white and 1 cup of brown. I made mini loafs for Christmas give away.

This recipe was lovely. For the flour I substituted half the amount with whole wheat, and I used applesauce for the oil.   I made one loaf and baked the rest of the batter as muffins, and they were perfectly moist and very, very tasty.  I thought they were a tad sweet, but that is probably because of the applesauce; I'll try to take that into account next time.  They smell wonderful while baking!  Overall, excellent recipe!

This bread is yummy. I could not stop eating it straight from the oven. I used 1/2 c. applesauce and 1/2 c. oil and I left out the pecans. I baked it in a 9x13 pan and it was ready in 45 minutes. This is a great way to use up pears that no one wants to eat!

This tasted good but took a long time to finish cooking. I used 2 loaf bread pans as stated but for some reason the middle was not getting done. I ended up having to put foil over the top to keep it from getting burned while it finished cooking. It took over an hour to bake, my guess is about an hour and 20 minutes.

This bread was delicious! I did substitute white flour for whole wheat, applesauce for oil & some brown sugar for white sugar and it came out perfect. The recipe made 2 9x5 loaves so I took one in to work and it was instantly gone. Even my boss (who doesn't like sweets) gave it rave reviews. I will definately make it again and would recommend it to anyone looking for something different.

This is real good.. a little too sweet, but I blame that on my very ripe, dripping sweetness pears. I think next time I'll hold back on the sugar a little depending on their ripeness. This was worth the time and effort and it used up some surplus of extra pears from the tree, If I were to have a choice of my sweet bread recipes, I would stick with the zucchini bread. That's my favorite.

Super delicious and VERY popular among my coworkers. Made a few healthy changes: Used 2 eggs, 1/2 c veg oil and replaced the rest with fresh applesauce I made using 2 apples.  Used 4 pears, small chopped (instead of measuring w/cups).  Reduced the sugar by half.  Used allspice instead of nutmeg. It cooked in an hour and tasted amazing. Thanks so much for the idea!

I made this tonight with my daughter, half of it in muffins. It was easy to make, and the consistency of it was wonderful. I added more cinnamon and a little bit of ground cloves to it, and I've already eaten three of the muffins! Looking forward to having it for breakfast, too!

Very satisfying and moist bread.  To cut calories and fat, I substituted half of the oil for applesauce, 1/2 cup of the flour for ground flaxseed, half of the white sugar for Splenda brown sugar,and used 2 eggs instead of 3.  Came out great...will definitely make it again.

This is very good bread. I subbed 1/2 cup of applesauce for half the oil and i also cut the sugar by a half a cup. I used one cup brown sugar and a half white. I also would have used half whole wheat flour but i forgot!! Next time, i will add the flour because after tasting this bread with all white flour, it can totally handle it!!!

I think this is a great bread.  I loved the pear flavor and the texture.  I made a few changes.  Substituted 1/2 of the sugar with raw sugar, 3/4 cup applesauce and the rest oil, added more cinn. and nutmeg.  I also left the pears bigger which I like.  Definitly will make this again with excess pears!

This bread is GREAT! We make a loaf or two of dessert bread a week for our students but have never tried this one. We had some extra pears and thought we'd give this a whirl. It's a hit! Excellent taste and texture. I think you could use apples in it with similar results.

I didn't read the reviews until after I made the bread. My neighbor gave me a bag full of great tasting hard pears. I didn't want to make jelly so I looked up fresh pear bread and made this recipe exactly as stated, excluding the nuts because my husband can't eat them.  I made three large loafs and three small loafs.  I passed these out to the neighbors, a large loaf going to the man who gave me the pears, and kept one for myself.  Everyone absolutely loved this bread and asked for the recipe.  I have printed your recipe Anna for everyone. This is one of the best breads I have eaten.  I didn't think you could make pear bread.  I did chop the pears really fine.  Thank you again for this recipe.  I will make it again.

This recipe was very good. I kept some of the pear slices in larger pieces, and I liked this very much in the bread. I used walnuts instead of pecans. I will make this again.

This is pretty good.  I used applesauce as suggested by another viewer. It made 5 mini loaves, which I like to freeze and pull out as needed.

I substituted the oil for 1 cup of unsweetened applesauce, the sugar for splenda and the eggs with egg beaters (trying to eat more healthy.) Did not add pecans because my kids would not touch it and left the other spices alone.  All I can say is that it was gone by morning.  Thanks Anna

This bread is sensational.  I have given the recipe to at least 2 people who have tried it.  I did make one change.  Because of my children wearing braces we replaced the nuts with coconut.  It is truly spectacular!!

You won't find too many pear recipes straying from this one. However, I used 1/2 cup more pear and 1/2 tsp. ground ginger which gives it a fresh spiciness. As a rule, I cut down on the sugar (-1/3 cup) so to taste the subtlties of the flavors (pear is a very subtle fruit), and did not use nuts. Also,  I used an 8x8 pan and baked it in my toaster oven. And I would say that it was nearly perfect.

This was very good!  Very moist and wonderful, subtle flavor from the pears.  I gave it 4 stars b/c it has so much sugar and oil... if it was a little healthier I'd give it 5!  Next time I make it I will substitute applesauce for some of the oil and see if I can use 1/2 as much brown sugar as white.
