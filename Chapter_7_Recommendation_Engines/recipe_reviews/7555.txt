I have been making this recipe for years. I think some of these people should re-read the recipe. It does not say to melt the butter ~ just make sure it is at room temp. And I also suggest that the milk and flour mixture be pretty cool before adding to creamed mixture. Try it again you will love it. PS try using a tsp. of   almond extract when frosting a chocolate cake. Its delicious.

A 1/4 teaspoon of corn starch in with the flour/milk prior to cooking will help alleviate the lumps.

I was really disappointed with this recipe.  

I definitely do NOT recommend it to anyone who does not have a stand mixer- I have one, and finally had to turn it off because I thought it would overheat. If I had to stand there with a hand held mixer, I would have given up much sooner.  I mixed & mixed & it still did not all come together.  It looks curdled to begin with, which is normal, but after 20 minutes of mixing, it still looked a little curdled and the sugar had not dissolved.  

As far as lumpy flour other people mentioned, you really need to stir constantly as it thickens. I did not have any problem with that at all. Also, this is not nice and cream colored- it is definitely yellow, with the butter and vanilla.  I was hoping it would look lighter upon beating.

I finally had to give up on this.  I have very little time to find a new recipe now to frost my friend's birthday cake.

This recipe tasted awesome!  Love it!  I halved the recipe for a batch of chocolate cupcakes, which was just enough for 18 cupcakes.  But next time, I don't think I will half the recipe, because it was so good, I want to add a huge mound of icing on each cake.  This was not too sweet and it had a great flavor.  When I bake, I always "substitute" healthier ingredients.  So I did use whole wheat pastry flour and sucanat with honey (which I ran through a coffee grinder, that has never had coffee in it, to get a finer sugar - closer to confectioners).  This was great with the healthier substitutions.  Will be making this again today and will try adding a twist with strawberries to get a strawberry icing.  Hope it turns out just as good!

***UPDATE***  I did make this icing by adding strawberries, delish!  I divided the icing into 3 parts, one part stayed the white vanilla (as the recipe), second part I whipped in 1 Tlb. of cocoa for chocolate icing, the third part, I added about 1-2 Tlb. of pureed strawberries (strawberries had sugar on them, left over from shortcake).  Then I iced cupcakes and had 3 different icings.  These were great!  BTW - this recipe "Simple White Cake" from this site makes excellent white cupcakes.

I use this recipe to fill my homemade Twinkies, the flour should be 4 tbsps not 2 though. A stand mixer works great for this as it should be beaten for at least 5 minutes to lose the graininess, sometimes closer to 10.
***Update, I read somewhere that it was recommended beating the sugar into the warm paste mixture, I did that and boy does it save tons of time! I beat my butter until fluffy then put in the fridge, then I beat the paste with the sugar and put that in the fridge, when the paste was cool I added it to the butter, added the vanilla then only needed to beat it for about 2 minutes until it was nice and fluffy, no graininess at all.

Great if you are in a pinch with no powdered sugar! I have never made frosting before, and needed some for kid's cupcakes, very easy to make! I did cheat a little by cooling the milk/flour after thickening in the fridge, and it didn't affect it at all- good yeild amount.

Delicious. Exactly what I was looking for. Incredibly thick, but with a light taste which melts in your mouth. If you want the perfect piping icing, I recommend this recipe! You won't be disappointed.

At first I was kinda shaky about it, but once I made it, it really did look like whipped cream. And my grandmother, who's always looking for a good frosting recipe, LOVED it. Used it to frost a red velvet cake...complimented it very well.

First, when you take the flour and milk off of the stove be sure to chill, not just cool, as it needs to be cold. I put mine in the freezer for 20-30 minutes to be sure it is well chilled.   DO NOT MELT THE BUTTER.  It says to cream the butter, which should be room temperature, not refrigerated, not melted.  This is an excellent, easy frosting IF YOU FOLLOW DIRECTIONS.  If you make changes, don't expect it to turn out the same as the recipe!

I don't know what these other cats are talkin about, lumpy and goat-like texture? Pssshh nawh you aren't making it right, you're in a  hurry and you aren't appreciating the time it takes with making frosting like this from scratch! I just made banana blueberry pan bread and topped it with this creamy frosting, and boy howdy! The frosting is spectacular, buttery, YUMMY! Next time y'all make this frosting, you gotta take your time with it and make sure it blends together right. Don't just mix it for 1 minute or somethin, and then frost ya cake or whatever. I took like 15 minutes on this recipe. It's my first attempt at making frosting from scratch, and it's bomb diggity

this is a great recipe. You need to let the milk and flour mixture set about an hour or two also it is easy if you have your butter at room temp. I will use this recipe forever thanks. Also this is good for those people who don't like frosting.

This WONDERFUL!!!  Light and fluffy and scrumptious without leaving a "sugar-coating" on your teeth.  Oh.  It's a definite keeper!  I also followed Justme's recommendations about the creaming:  Butter and sugar - 4 minutes, add vanilla - 2 minutes, half flour and milk mixture - 4 minutes, add remainig half - 4 minutes.  I used 2% milk.  Thank you!

This is the best icing I have ever made.  I also made it in chocolate by adding 1 cup chocolate chips to the milk mixture after removing the mixture from the heat.  Amazing.

I followed the recipe exactly plus followed the suggestions JustMe wrote below. It turned out PERFECT!!! I love this recipe because it's like a whipped cream frosting, yet not too sweet. I used Lactose Free Milk, so for those of you with an intolerance, you must try it! I frosted 3 dozen cupcakes using the "Simple White Cake" recipe from this site. OH MY GOODNESS, are these CC good! I will most certainly make again. It's worth the time it takes to make.

Total flop. Because the sugar was not specified in recipe, I used granulated sugar. I should have made the obvious catch that unless the sugar were dissolved with heat, it would continually dissolve once the frosting was made. Also, the recipe was oozing with butter, so I added at least 4 cups 10x sugar to help dissolve that. Still utter disaster, but we made do because it was so much butter and sugar that would have been thrown away otherwise.

To the reviewer below me: I've tried several variations of this recipe today and found it to be great. Using the exact ingredients in the recipe are key to getting it right. Use real butter (I've had success with using 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup shortening, but I wouldn't recommend margarine AT ALL if maybe that's what you've been trying). Also, use at least 2% milk; whole milk would probably work best, and I haven't had luck using lower-fat milks. Also, after adding the milk mixture to the butter mixture, beat it for at least 5-10 minutes to give the sugar crystals time to dissolve (a stand mixer really is best for this recipes, if you have one). Keep trying.. it really is a fantastic frosting!

This frosting has a nice 'cool whip' type texture and it has a lightly sweet flavor. I would suggest that if you plan to color the frosting that you add the coloring to the milk mixture before mixing with the butter mixture. I added color at the end and it did not mix well and gave it a curdled appearance. I also would not recommend this frosting for cookies but it works really well for cakes.

This recipe likely has potential but DOES NOT work unless you use specific ingredients such as listed by another reviewer - BUTTER not margarine, WHOLE MILK, make a PASTE rather than just thickened milk. A lot of extra steps are needed to make this recipe good.

Sorry but this is disgusting. Tastes like pure butter and looks all curdled.  I followed the directions perfectly.  Next time I won't be so lazy when I run out of confectioner's sugar.

I found this recipe while looking for a butter cream that is not grainy, I have followed many recipes and I always get a "toothpaste" like texture. I have to say that this was fabulous!! I did add my own "tweak" to it. I added the sugar to the milk/flour mixture and increased the flour by 2 Tablespoons. Let the mixture cool completely. Beat the butter and flavoring for 4 minutes, added half the cooled "batter" and beat for another 4 minutes. Added the remaining flour/milk /batter and beat again for 4 minutes.  Very smooth, very fluffy.  NOT GRAINY to my amazement!!!! I will use this over and over again.

I wish I'd read the first review ahead of time- sadly I only had skim milk, I cooled it down mostly, but I don't think it was cold, etc. I wouldn't rate it down since it's pretty much my fault that it looked odd, but I did NOT like the taste of it. Hmm. I dunno.

****UPDATE--DO NOT refrigerate it over night to use in the morning.  I let it warm up a bit and re-whipped it.  It looks a bit like cottage cheese now. Frost your cake and THEN refrigerate it, no matter how tired you are!!**************I made a few mistakes, but still awesome!  Very forgiving!  I didn't have a ton of time, so I took a few shortcuts.  Less than 20 minutes start to finish.  I think it's a little bit granular from the sugar, but VERY tasty.  As it sits, it's getting less granular tasting.  I'm going to frost the cupcakes tomorrow morning--so maybe it will be even better then!  1) I didn't heat the milk/flour till boiling, but evidently long enough.  Tip--toss the flour in the saucepan 1st, add milk little by little and stir.   Make a very thick paste first, then add more and more milk, stirring  each time.  I used an old fashioned egg beater (rotate the handle to spin the 2 beaters.)  It didn't take very long.  It was thicker, but definitely not Elmer's glue thick or anything!  2)  I cooled the mixture in the freezer, mixing with a fork a couple times.  Maybe 10-15 minutes?  It got much thicker as it cooled.  3) I took the butter from the fridge and microwaved the 2 sticks 15 seconds, flipped them and 10 seconds more.  They were very soft, but I guess that wasn't a problem. All's well that ends well! Thanks!!      PS--I used SALTED butter and WHOLE milk.  I did NOT sift the flour NOR blend the sugar to make it finer (maybe that would help make it less granular?)

I find this especially good on dark chocolate cake or cupcakes. This recipe whips up very light, fluffy, and not too sweet. In addition to the other tips, I recommend you use castor sugar or baker's sugar, both of which are more fine than granulated, so they dissolve more rapidly. I use the whisk attachment of my stand mixer and after incorporating the cooled, thickened milk, whip on medium-high speed until the frosting has the consistency of stiff whipped cream. I add liquers along with the vanilla extract for extra flavor - raspberry and orange liquers work well.

great recipe!   Lots of beating, but it does taste great and has a very whip-cream like appearance.

This is the frosting recipe I have been searching for!! It is awesome for piping and tastes SO much better than traditional buttercream frosting. I took all the suggestions of "JustMe" (including subbing almond extract for vanilla) and it turned out perfectly! My advice: if you think it isn't the right consistency, just keep beating on high, mine took about 10 mins before it was a nice whipped consistency - I was a little worried along the way because it was looking quite curdled, but just be patient and hang in there - it will turn out! This will definitely be my go to recipe from now on.

Update: I tried adding 1/4 cup pureed strawberries to use on vanilla cupcakes - DELICIOUS!! You need to whip quite a bit longer after adding the strawberries as it will look curdled and gross - but just let it whip away and eventually it will come around.

This recipe failed for me. My little sister and I were excited about making cupcakes until we made the frosting. I turned out to be extremely liquidy and yellow. It tasted like icing, but looked more like yellow cinammon roll icing. Nothing like whipped cream like the recipe promised. At first I thought I messed up the recipe or directions but I reread it several times and couldn't figure it out because I did follow the directions. I do not recommend it at all.

First off, I get that this isn't an easy recipe, but usually, when things are this difficult, they are worth it.  This wasn't.  At first, I followed a previous poster's instructions to keep boiling the milk until it was super-thick.  I had to throw that part away.  Tried again, just boiling the milk for a minute and it was great.  I couldn't wisk constantly because of my nonstick pan and there were a few flour lumps, but once I added it to the butter mixture, it was fine (lump-wise).  I creamed the butter for a good 8-10 minutes.  You want to cream it so that the sugar dissolves (so the frosting isn't grainy), and that takes beating for a while.  I added the milk mixture and it came together pretty quickly after that.  I was worried about over-beating b/c you can do that with whipped cream, but I'm pretty sure that wasn't a problem.  The end result was more greasy than creamy.  It looked like whipped cream, but didn't taste like anything good.  The mouthfeel is almost slimy--not my idea of good eats.  I wanted to make this for some sandwich cookie cream, and it was okay, but I'll prbably lease the rest of the cookies unfrosted and toss it.  I suggest you stick with a traditional cooked frosting or a buttercream.

I began making this frosting years ago when I found a recipe for whoopie pies that included this as the filling.  It was so much better than the marshmallow cream or shortening ones usually used for the pies, and I became instantly smitten.  It has a fabulous texture and a wonderful flavor.  Love it!

This is a great recipe! Reading the reviews, I chilled my flour-milk mixture, but first added the sugar and stirred it in. This was a great tip because it absolutely eliminated graininess. I did add an extra half-cup of sugar, and flavored it with peppermint flavoring rather than vanilla. We tinted it green and put it on dark-chocolate cupcakes, and they were FABULOUS! So much tastier than our usual powdered-sugar buttercream, fluffier and lighter tasting, sweet but perfectly sweet, really. I've been baking and frosting cakes for fifty years, and I have finally found the perfect frosting recipe! LOVE THIS RECIPE!

My only problem I had today with this recipe is that I should have doubled it. I layered and frosted a cake and ended up needing more. I used my Kitchenaid mixer... be sure to beat this well. (read custom version of this recipe.) Loved it!

I followed the directions exactly and the frosting was not usable and did not even taste ok. I must admit, I was a little hesitant to use this recipe since it just didn't sound quite right calling for a whole cup of milk but I decided to give it a try. The finished product was a soupy mess. I will NOT be giving this a second chance and I don't recommend this recipe for anyone else. Also: this is the first recipe from Allrecipes that I have tried and not liked or been able to find something redeeming about.

I loved this frosting. It was so sweet and very light. It didn't feel heavy as if it was setting like a stone in your stomach like some frostings that are heavy and overwhelming.
I would just recommend using a very simple and not so sweet cake because the frosting really does have a lot of sweetness by itself.
I found it easier having someone else in the kitchen also to help stir the milk and flour so it wouldn't stick to the bottom of the sauce pan while heating. 
I started heating the milk and flour when I put my cake in the oven, so it only needed about 23 minutes to get thickened well and of course about the same time for it to cool. It wouldn't be a frosting I would use in a major rush because it does need time to thicken and cool.
It was one amazing frosting. Very sweet and very light. I will definitely use it over and over.

Sorry, this fell flat for me. I tried it exactly as written, added red food coloring at the end, and had to add cream as it was too stiff - it wouldn't pipe well. It ended up tasting like store bought cupcakes frosting which is what I was trying to avoid. I'm going back to grama;s old standard. It wasn't nearly sweet enough for me.

This frosting took FOREVER to make. I had the milk and flour mixture on medium/low heat and stirred it for about thirty minutes for it to form a paste. The butter, sugar and vanilla mixture took a while too. I thought I followed the directions exactly and took advise from a few of the reviews. With that I thought it turned out average. Although, I did use 2% milk and salted butter so next time (if I have that much time to put into frosting) I will use unsalted butter and whole milk.

I LOVE this recipe!  For those that have had issues, here are some tips, as I have now made this several times over the last few weeks with a couple of variations. The butter or margarine should be room temperature at the most. When whipping the butter/ sugar mixture, whip until it lightens in color. I found marg hold shape better, but butter tastes better. It will still be grainy from the sugar, but that will go away when the milk & flour mixture is added. Mix all together for 1 to 2 minutes before using. This will get rid of any grainy-ness I always put the milk/ flour mix in the fridge & use it cold. This should be the consistency of custard. To avoid getting a skin on top, place plastic wrap directly on the mix when cooling.I do this the night before.  I piped 96 cupcakes with this recipe, & they held shape for 2 days before being eaten. 
I tried subbing cream cheese for the butter(1/2) and it would not hold its shape but tasted amazing! I will keep that in mind for a fruit dip.  
One additional note: I have now made this with butter 3 times, and they did not turn out nearly as well(a mess, really). I adjusted my rating slightly to reflect this.
I hope this helps!

OMG. I can't stop eating this stuff! I had to hide it from myself!! I like it so much better than regular buttercream frosting. I always thought it tasted too powder-sugary. I followed "JustMe's" instructions. The only thing I did different was use skim milk. It was all I had. I ended up adding another tbsp of flour to the milk mix to get it super thick and pasty. After it was cooled it was very rubbery. I was worried that it wouldn't work, but it was perfect! The only suggestion I would have is to make sure you use the right sized mixing bowl. I think my bowl was too large, so it was harder to get the butter and sugar to mix till the sugar wasn't grainy anymore. I can't wait to use this frosting for my daughter's birthday cake and hear what our guests will think!

It tasted great, but It didnt fluff up. I have tried this recipe twice and it didnt work out either time. They were both too soupy. I think maybe it is because I used 2% milk. If I try again, I will try to use whole milk.

I really wish this frosting would have turned out as the other reviewer's finished product. I followed the directions exactly and the hints from other reviews, but my frosting came out gritty and butter tasting. I had to throw it all out and go to the store to buy frosting to frost my daughter's school cupcakes.

Was not a "frostingy" texture at all and was a very strange consistency.  I ended up throwing it all away and going with my standby recipe. (a very expensive experiment - with all of the butter)UPDATE: I did use about a cup of this so all wouldn't be wasted and I added about 1 1/2 lbs confectioners sugar and about 1/4 cup whole milk. It was ok to use with this modification, but I still would not make again.

What an awesome recipe!This came out great and I had no problems whatsoever.  I doubled the recipe for frosting cupcakes because I go kind of high with the cupcake frosting. I made this more like a roux and added two tablespoons of butter to the flour. A helpful hint and a fail safe when making a roux, add flour to the pan first, then butter and whisk together until smooth over low to just med heat,  then add the milk a little at a time and all the while stir, stir, stir using a whisk.  It's tedious I know, but if you want a smooth frosting then you have to put a little effort into it, this helps to avoid the lumpiness that I have read from the disappointed reviews. Also, DO NOT and I mean DO NOT add to the butter mixture until completely cooled. Butter, hot roux..not a good combo. The helpful hints from the most positive review are also spot on. I didn't notice it until I sat down to write my review and all I can say is "Ditto!" This is a great lighter taste to a straight butter cream frosting, not lighter in calories, but lighter in taste. Since I doubled the recipe, I added a tsp of vanilla extract and a tsp of vanilla bean paste. So happy I found this recipe, I even posted a pic.

Excellent recipe! The comments about needing to make sure the butter was room temperature before beating(and not to melt it) and to keep whisking the milk and flour combination while cooking were spot on. And the milk/flour combo does need to be room temp before beating it all together. Nice and fluffy and sweet; my daughter told me that we'll be using this on all our cakes now instead of the store bought stuff:)

We used this recipe to frost my DH's birthday cake. It was very time consuming to make. Had to make 2 batches for a 9" two layer cake. Even though I followed the directions and more tips from my sister, the cake decorator, the first batch was very grainy. Used the suggestion from another reviewer of adding the sugar to the milk/flour and it came out much more creamy. It was difficult to use for piping on the cake because it was so soft but tasted good!

I had already made the milk/flour mixture with the stated amounts, when I decided to only use 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup sugar, because I only had a sheet cake to frost; but came out very good and fluffy and good tasting. Sweet enough for my taste.

This recipe has fabulous flavor and texture if you give it the time and attention that it needs.  I have made it twice.  Once in a time crunch and it turned out horribly, and once with plenty of time to let things cool and set between mixes and it turned out fabulous.  Make sure you let the milk cool completely!  It makes the frosting so yummy and fluffy as long as the butter doesn't get melty at all.  Melted butter completely ruins the consistancy of th frosting.

I wasn't too sure about this, but wanted to give it a try.  Came out excellent, just like whipped cream, but nice and sturdy for icing my cupcakes.  Tasted delicious. This recipe is a keeper.

Made for cupcakes for my daughter's Brownie Troop.  Easy to use and more than enough for 40 cupcakes.  Sprinkles applied well, and the flavor was great without being overly sweet.

This was the best frosting I've ever made!  Thanks to JustMe's posting I was able to follow her directions and make an excellent textured frosting.  I made it for carrot cupcakes.  *One note* a reviewer suggested using almond extract instead of vanilla.  It was tasty, but a little too powerful - suggest using just 1/4 or 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract.  Also we didn't like almond extract paired with carrot cake - should have used vanilla.  Will definitely make this again, though. Mmmm mmmmm.

This is a receipe that has been handed down for generations, but the variation that I was taught was using crisco, instead of butter. Very tasty, believe it or not, but not one bit healthy. I think the crisco version was derived by necessity for those who couldn't afford butter.

I was concerned when I read the ingred. however after I made it following the recipe I was very surprised on how much it looked like cool whip and it has a very light taste to it. This I will make agian as My HB hates super sweet frosting and he had thirds on cake with this frosting. Easy to make and light and airy frosting, also I spread my but would be easy to pipe also.

CAROL CAROL CAROL !!! WOW This is wonderful. I can't imagine why anyone would have trouble with this "easy" recipe. Beat and beat this lush frosting and it will be perfect. I just made it and added 3 teas of orange extract to it as I am going to put it on an orange cake (Beat & Bake Orange Cake-allrecipes.com) and decorate with segments of Mandarin Oranges.  This is so yummy, so simple to make. Don't use margarine folks it will flop for sure. Thank you Carol ! UPDATE I am waiting for my cakes to cool. If that soon doesn't happen I am not going to have any icing left. This is so delicious Carol it should have an extraordinary name, creamy frosting does not do this justice. Thanks again.

texture was very nice to work with, held its shape well when piping.  not so sure about the taste though.  might be because I used proper butter and therefore had a slight salty aftertaste.  next time i will use unsalted butter.

I thought this frosting was fantastic! I did not find this recipe too difficult to make and this is the first time I made frosting from scratch. I just cooked the milk and flour until it was thick & creamy. It kind of balls up as it sits to cool. Everyone loved the taste and texture and all said it reminded them of whipped cream. Oh, I did constantly wisk the flour/milk mixture as it cooked. Don't know if that made a difference.

I JUST made this frosting and I'm SO glad I did.  I tried something similar before and it was a total bust.  However, this recipe was great, easy and my frosting came out super fluffy and creamy.  I followed the directions exactly (because I'm new to this) and was really excited that I was able to make it.  *clapping*  LOL

My grandma used to make this frosting for my dad and called it "Pope's Frosting". We all love the fluffy, buttery flavor of it. It's a lot less sweet than your typical Buttercream one. This past time I made it I used caster sugar. I have never heard of it before moving out of the states but it's a british product and just means super fine sugar. It's nice so that you don't ever seen the granules in the frosting.

I too, was out of confectioners sugar and needed to find something that didn't call for it. I found this recipe and was nervous to try it because I have never made frosting before but I was pleasantly surprised. I had an issue because I was out of vanilla and couldn't find any other flavors around to add. I finally got really creative and while mixing the sugar & Butter, Added one small tube of yellow writing icing. Yellow because the mix already had a slight yellow tint so it would blend, and also because I knew it would add that sweet vanilla tang we needed. I was desperate and it worked actually wonderfully. I also ended up having a slightly more whipped consistency before I was going to add to the cupcakes I made, so I just chilled the frosting in the fridge a few minutes before using my cake decorator tips to put over the cupcakes. It helped a lot and I ended up with beautiful almost professional looking cupcakes when I was done. very pleased!
I also mixed blue & red coloring for a pretty purple frosting color. 
Thanks for a great recipe, I think it has saved a lot of us in a pinch!

OH MY GOODNESS!! This was the best frosting I have ever made!! You need to have a good hour to make it though, and it would be a lot harder if I didnt have a standing mixer. But I was also baking the cupcakes and was in no hurry to finish, it the absolutely worth the wait. I put the hot milk mixture in the freezer and covered it with saran wrap to prevent a skin from forming on top, that shed a lot of time off the recipe. I left the butter to whip up, while I cleaned up the kitchen. The icing spread to well, and piped even better. My family loved it as well!!!

Pretty Good! Has a very buttery taste to it. That could be my fault. I subed huney for the sugar and wheat flour for reg. I also added extra vinilla to give it more flavor. Tasted very good on carrot bars, which I tinted it orange. Everyone seemed to like it! Thanks

I had a hard time getting the right consistency and had to add a bunch of flour but overall this was a great recipe. I added pureed strawberries to make a strawberry whipped topping. My husband loved it.

I don't know what other folks are saying about it being clumpy, soupy, and gooey, but I will NEVER buy a frosting in the store again! Everyone  in my family loved this recipe. I halfed my recipe and changed it up a bit after I found another way of doing on youtube. First I put the milk and flour in the pot and began whisking AS SOON as i turned the heat on. I kept stirring quickly and never got any clumps, because i kept WHISKING. I had it on medium- high heat. I let it get thick and let it sit for about an hour. When it's cooled, it looks like a clump, but that's ok. I then put vanilla in the COMPLETELY COOLED flour/ milk concoction, i beat it for about 5 minutes with an electric mixture. When you do this, it gets really smooth again. Then i took the SOFTENED butter at room temp and i beat it with the sugar in another bowl. I beat it for about 10 minutes. It is important to beat it till it is REALLY FLUFFY AND WHITE. When the butter sugar is creamed till it's white and fluffy, then it's ready.

Next, I put the butter sugar in the whipped up milk/ flour mixture. I beat for about 5-7 minutes until it is light and fluffy AND BOY.. IT WAS DELICIOUS! The sugar grains dissolved on their own!I put it on my vanilla cupcakes. It tastes like sweetened whipped cream, but BETTER!

If you follow directions and HAVE PATIENCE, this will come out right.Most people that screw up probably  did not take their time and was rushing it. Or even worse, the butter and sugar was NOT mixed properly.

Love it! I am not remotely talented in the culinary sense and I nailed this. I chose this recipe because it looked simple and I had all the ingredients. I left the butter on the counter for a couple of hours. It wasn't completely softened, but had a slight give when squeezing. I used a combination of whipping cream and 1/2 & 1/2 instead of milk.  I used a $10 mixer I picked up at the grocery store. I don't understand the other reviewers who had a problem with this recipe. I think an 8 year old could probably out-cook me and if *I* pulled this recipe off without a hitch, then anyone can. I only wonder if a chocolate or cream cheese version of this icing is possible?

This is similar to a recipe my grandmother made for years to go on "red cake" (red velvet, this is the only frosting that should be put on red velvet, cream cheese is good for strawberry or carrot cakes but terrible on red cake). My grandmothers version uses 2T cornstarch instead of flour, and powdered sugar instead of granulated. I have never had it turn out runny like some reviews here. Make sure that the milk mixture is THICK, my daughter describes it as being like pudding. Then make sure it's cool (room temp) along with room temp butter and you are good. This frosting is easy once you get the hang of it and sooo much better then the over sweet store bought stuff. It also stays creamy instead of getting crunchy.

My friend slept over one night and we had a bake sale the next morning for school so we decided to make cupcakes. I picked this recipe because it was the first result, and it looked delicious. I didn't use food coloring, but it was an amazing hit! When we first started mixing it, it looked like a brown egg yolk..we thought we messed up. But I didn't want to completely scrap it so I just let it keep beating, and oh my gosh was I right. It started to whip after 5-7 minutes, it got fluffy, white and big. Not to mention it tasted DELICIOUS. I put it in a normal plastic bag, cut the end off and we squeezed nice swirls on the cupcakes, they looked amazing, and tasted even better. It literally melts in your mouth, and it's not rich, its so light and fluffy. I use it whenever I'm looking for a sweet tooth, which is why I'm on it now, going to make a few to satisfy my cupcake desires :) Would definitely recommend!

Not sure why other had problems, light creamy texture and good flavor.  I used 2% milk and butter (not margarine).  Just be sure to beat the butter and sugar thoroughly and that the milk mixture is completely cool before adding.  I did have to beat it for about 5 minutes after adding the milk mixture to make sure the sugar was completely dissolved, but the texture was great!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

This is hands down the best frosting I've ever made for decorating cakes.  I always follow JustMe's instructions and it comes out perfect.  I get rave reviews every time.  
From personal experience, don't try to refrigerate it before frosting your cake.  It loses the texture and I had to start over.  LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe!!!!!!

This is the same recipe that I got from my mother for what we call Bakers Frosting.  It's SOOO good!  Light and not too sweet like the grocery store frosting that you get when you buy a cake - you know - the kind that feels like your tongue is coated with shortening!  I've used this also to make filled cupcakes.  You can also use 2 T. of cornstarch in your milk instead of flour.  I cover the bowl then with waxed paper to cool it.  Keeps it from getting a film on top.  The thing with this frosting is you really have to beat the sugar and butter a long time!  For the ones who complain that it's not white - try using the Wilton clear vanilla instead of regular.

I make this all the time and it always turns out great. It is light and fluffy and not to sweet or rich. I add cocoa powder for chocolate frosting and I have made it with dark brown sugar in place of the regular sugar and it was awesome on a plain white cake or a banana cake. I recommend you try it, but follow the recipe exactly the first time and then add your own touches to change it up. This is my go to recipe for frosting.

I love this recipe! It never really reached the consistancy of whipped cream, but I thought the flavor was really good and I definitely will be using it again.

It was okay. Probably not going to use it again though. It didn't go very well with the cinnamon rolls at ALL. So, I would not recommend this to anyone, 'cause it just kinda sucked. :l.

I really love this recipe.  I found it last christmas and have used it ever since.  Unlike another post I used 1% milk and it worked just fine, just make sure to whisk the whole time and it comes out wonderful.  I use this frosting all the time and everyone loves it my 10 yr old sister begs me to make it. Just made halloween orange frosting. Well good luck.

I don't know what you guys are doing wrong, but I am horrible at baking and cooking, and I made this without any problems. I took all the shortcuts too: I used tub margarine, which I half melted. I didn't wait for the flour/milk mixture to cool completely, and I cooled in in the fridge. I didn't mix long enough with either mixture, because I am impatient, and despite all of this, my frosting came out just fine. I was even able to put in a bag and write Happy Birthday with it no problem. The only thing I can say about it is it's not white, its yellow. Other than that, realllyyy easy recipe.

I needed a recipe for icing without confectioner's sugar since I was out, and I found this. I cooled my milk and flour mixture for about 45 minutes before I mixed with butter that had been sitting out for about an hour. No lumps -- good consistency. It is very sweet. Used a star tip to decorate mini cupcakes with the icing -- they look good and taste good. I couldn't eat a lot of this icing -- the mini cupcake with a swirl on top is just right.

Easy to make and turned out fluffy and smooth (the trick is to beat the  out of it with your KitchenAid), but I'm not sure I liked the flavor.  Very buttery, but rather mild (dare I say bland?) compared to the powdered-sugar-based buttercreams I'm used to, and I could taste the flour/milk mixture as a weird aftertaste.  (I cooled the flour/milk mixture in the freezer for 25 minutes; and used barely softened butter.)

I did not like this recipe! It takes like sour milk and butter because you have to cook the milk, and 1 cup of butter is way too much! Also, when this frosting is placed on a cake it does not look appetizing at all!

Super easy and fast.  Helped me out in a jam; i was out of confections sugar and cream cheese so I need a recipe not needing those ... lol.  I was worried about the cooking and time needed for cooling, but I cooled it in the sink with ice water:)  This frosting is super sweet in case you don't like that...

I was skeptical about this recipe.  But I must say I loved the flavor, tasted buttery, but still light.  I didn't give 5 stars because I wished it was just a little more stiff.  Otherwise, wonderful!   I will use it again very soon!

Was totally skeptical but yum! I used this frosting on the Lazy Daisy Cake. I also followed JustMe's advice for the frosting. I only had fat free milk, so I used 1/4 cup fat free milk, and 3/4 full fat French vanilla creamer. And I didn't have vanilla extract, so I used a little creamer there, too. Mine didn't make 3 1/2 cups, but it was enough to cover the top of a 13x9 pan cake. Turned out sweet and awesome!

I added 8 oz of cream cheese to the mixture and heated it over medium heat for 10min to thicken it up (I had wanted a cream cheese frosting recipe but couldn't find one with the ingredients I had). I also had to put 1/4c flour and 1c extra sugar in to thicken/sweeten it up. Turned out great! Put it on a spice cake :-)

Not impressed. Did not turn out the way it said. Always turned out way to thin. More like a liquid. Tried changing slightly to make thicker and never worked. Would suggest looking for a different recipe.

I love the outcome of this frosting, it takes awhile to make it properly but it is worth it. all i can say bad for it is that it easily melts but that can be really good on a fresh muffin or cupcake. This would go amazing on cinnamon rolls.

Made it many times and it always turned out perfect. I sometimes add different extracts and/or food coloring while cooking the milk mixture.

Used with soymilk to top on cupcakes for my friends' son who has severe milk allergy.  make sure to put butter at room temp first! I also cooled soymilk/flour in refrid after I boiled it before beating into the butter/sugar mixture.  It was excellent!

I cannot believe I just produced this in my own kitchen- it tastes like wedding cake.  I won't be needing frosting often, but when I do, this will 100% be the recipe I use.

I have tried making this recipe at least 7 or 8 times.  EVERY SINGLE TIME it ends up separating/curdling so that it is a slimy mess.  This recipe is the recipe from my husband's great grandmother's birthday cake recipe, which he insists upon every birthday, so I'm stuck with it. It always makes me so angry because it ruins the birthday cake, IMO, and looks just terrible.

easier than the reviews say, mine came out fluffy with the exact consistency of whipped cream frosting.  I couldn't seem to get the word Paste out of my head, but I kept dipping into the frosting for more, it had a very nice light butter cream taste.  I hope it holds up, like others say it has.  My first try, would definately think about adding some flavor to it on future uses.

I'm lactose intolerant...I used vanilla soymilk in place of milk and followed the rest of the recipe to the T.  It came out perfect! As many people have said, do NOT melt the butter in any way.  ALSO, make sure the mixture of flour and milk is fully cool....should almost be gel like.

This is the one and ONLY recipe for icing that our family has used for generations for the Waldorf Astoria (or, Red Velvet) cake. I cannot imagine a yummier icing in the world!   For the person who stated "do not melt the butter!", there's nowhere in this recipe that states that butter be melted! Just bring to room temperature. I agree with JustMe about bringing the 'white sauce' (milk & flour mixture) to cool completely. It does take a lot of beating and and it will come out white and fluffy and absolutely delicious every time!

If you don't love LOVE this icing, you are not doing it right!  It's really easy and only takes a few minutes to come together.  Just mix the fats and sugar for 2 - 3 minutes then add the cooled flour mixture.  It is not overly sweet and holds up well.   You will never want to make cream cheese icing again.

I've made a variation of this recipe for years but this is much, much better.  It is the best frosting you'll ever taste if you just follow the directions carefully.  It pipes nicely from a pastry bag, making it very easy to frost cupcakes.

very creamy - but frosted beautifully!  followed  tip about waiting until milk is really thick and then cooling it before mixing in - sped up the cooling process by setting the thick milk in a bowl and then putting that bowl in a larger bowl of ice water.

I rarely give 5 starts - LOVE this frosting. It DOES NOT taste like flour, so don't worry about that. It is light and fluffy and just a little bit grainy, but that's pleasant. I am not a butter cream fan because it's always so sweet. This is not overbearing. I made it according to "JustMe"s suggestions. I will say, though, that this frosting is *bouncy* if you follow her advice. The closest thing I can compare the texture to is marshmallow fluff (though I promise it is not that extreme!). BUT I'm POSITIVE that it had this texture because (as directed by the other reviewer) I cooked milk and flour mixture until it is difficult to mix, which yielded a VERY viscous mixture. Next time I will not cook it so long, and I have no doubts that the consistency will be better.

Here's a suggestion: Use 2 sticks of Imperial Margarine (must be Imperial) for the butter and one snack pack size pudding - vanilla flavor - in place of the milk and flour. (Can also omit or reduce vanilla flavoring according to your taste).  Has great consistency every time!

After reading and following "Just Me"s instruction--please don't think they're just suggestions--I made the following changes and got a less buttery product.
Decrease real butter to 3/4C. and increase whte cane sugar to AT LEAST 1 1/4c. and I have the frosting I had been searching for these past 23 years--VOILA!!  Also be advised--heat causes it to mealt and refrigeration causes it to harden--so serve at room temp.

Very very good.  Just a quick suggestion... I put the sugar and 1 TBSP dried lavender into the food processor and processed it for a minute or so.  It makes the sugar have a really fine texture and added a nice lavender flavor.  I was using this to top some lavender cupcakes...  MMMM!

Wow this recipe is great!  We really made it a point to follow directions, ie mixing the flour and the milk first then boiling and mix for a long time.  Anyways, was wondering if we can use half the butter called for in the recipe since we found it was too buttery in the taste?  Has anyone tried this or used Crisco instead?  Just wondering if it still would have the same softness like whip.  All in all I am very happy. Thanks for a great recipe.

Very good frosting. I made it twice and both times came out good. I was nervous about trying based on some of the comments but with the help of other reviewers tips, it was fine. It's less sweet and more buttery than other frostings which I prefer. It's soft at room temp but becomes very firm once refrigerated due to the quantity of butter.
1. You do need to stir the milk/flour mixture constantly--don't rush the process. I used white whole wheat once and then I used all purpose--both worked fine.
2. Butter needs to be softened at room temp, not melted and then
3. Beat, beat ,beat with the sugar and vanilla. I think it's impossible to beat this too much. I have a stand mixer and I pretty much let it go while I did other things in the kitchen. Stop and scrape down the sides periodically.

Mine was thin...and watery i used a standard handheld mixer and it still did not fluff up...i did taste it...flavor was there...dont know what i did wrong...will try again with the helpful hints of others!

Wonderful!! This is what I've been looking for. It is a great compromise for those who love frosting and those who don't like frosting. It has a more delicate, sweet flavor similar to whipped cream frosting, when granulated sugar is used. Powdered sugar works too, but gives it more of a buttercream frosting taste, a little richer and heavier. Although, powdered sugar is not as sweet as granulated sugar, it is richer since you must use more than the amount of sugar the recipe calls for. Granulated sugar takes a long time to mix in - you must mix and mix or the frosting will have a gritty texture- but it is worth it. I whisk the flour and milk in a frying pan instead of a sauce pan and it takes less time to thicken. I'm so happy to have found this recipe.

This was my first time making frosting from scratch. It was so easy and it's absolutely delicious. I don't think I'll ever buy pre-made frosting from the store again! I did follow some tips from others such as whisking the milk/flour CONSTANTLY over low/medium heat then letting it cool COMPLETELY before adding to the butter mixture. I had no problem using a hand mixer. The one thing I will do next time is use confectioner's sugar. It was a little grainy but the more I mixed it the smoother it was!

I'm really giving this 4 1/2 stars because I think the problem was not the recipe's fault but mine.  The taste was absolutely to die for!  It was soft and creamy, had a great mouthfeel and aftertaste, but...uh...I got tons of teeny tiny lumps from the flour/milk mixure.  I used a whisk continually during the cooking process, even sifted my flour ahead of time.  I did scrape the side of the pan, perhaps that was the problem.
Still, this frosting is out of this world delish!  I *will* figure out what I did wrong, and this recipe will be permanently fixed in this household.  Thanks Kristen...good stuff!

PERFECT both times I cooked it!  As other reviewers indicate, butter must be room temperature and you must allow milk concoction to cool completely.  This is the only frosting I have ever made and it was easy and so good.  I put it on cupcakes.  I colored it pink with the gelee food coloring by Wilton (just mix it in at the end) and it was so beautiful piped onto cupcakes with sprinkles on top!

my 4 stars is only because i added a tad too much butter by accident, so it never acually "came together", but OMG it was so delicious that my family ate it anyway... i put it in a jar in the fridge and frosted my sugar cake cookies w/ it... sooo YUMM. thanx for a great recipe!

Wooo Hooo!!!  I followed the directions exactly except I mixed the milk/flour mix with the butter/sugar mix while it was still warm, I added a cup of peanut butter as I wanted P.B. Frosting, then I chilled it in the fridge for about 2 hours and then whipped it with my hand mixer.  The sugar was completely dissolved and it was so creamy I wanted to eat it before it ever got on the cake!

I used to make this recipe all the time when I was growing up. I am thrilled to have found it again!

I think the main trick is to get the milk/flour mixture to the correct consistency. It should end up being like pudding once it has cooled. Also I found that cooling it for approximately 30 minutes worked great. Mixing into the butter mixture is the easiest part and I never need to use a stand mixer at all -- I use a hand mixer with a whip attachment and it turns out perfect.

I was so excited to find this recipe here!  It was my favorite with chocolate cake when I was growing up.  It is not as sweet as some frosting, and it is very fluffy and looks great on a layer cake.

I loved this recipe.  It was light and fluffy and had a great creamy color.   I didn't have any problems getting it to come together, nor with it being too thin or lumpy as some others have had.  I will definitely be using this frosting more often.

I had my doubts when I saw the consistency of the milk/flour mixture but the end results overcame my hesitation! This frosting not only looks like a bakery frosting but tastes almost as good as one too! It is quick and easy, has few ingredients and I think it makes more than the recipes states. I frosted a batch of cupcakes and still had quite a bit left over!

Very easy to make, and took almost no time at all (except waiting for milk mixture to cool)  I would make this again.

I tried the recipe with a chocolate and peanut butter twist, and it worked well for me.  After the milk and flour mixture thickened, I added semi-sweet chocolate chips and a two spoon fulls of peanut butter, and I let it cool.  After mixing it with the creamed butter, I put it on a chocolate cake, and it was great.  It looks as though the milk base it pretty versatile for a lot of variations.

Also, it sounds as though the negative reviews didn't allow the milk and flour mixture to cool.  If you add it while it's hot, it going to melt the butter.

I am not a big frosting fan but this one I love. I have made it many times and always get rave reviews for it. It only takes 2-3 minutes of mixing to whip it up into a whip cream like frosting. The trick is to have a very firm white sauce. To do that it is  best to start with whole (3.5%) milk and I add 3 rounded Tablespoons of  flour. Let the white sauce cool completely before adding to your butter and sugar mix.

I will state this BEFORE I give my review.  I am an experience baker and decorator and make icing ALL the time.  I have tested my own buttercream and perfected it over the years so I know how to make icing.  I also have a stand mixer, makes no difference.  I followed the directions to the tee and my icing separated.  Now the taste, from what I could tell, was very good.  But I couldn't even serve this to my own family.  I even refrigerated it and tried  to fix it and I still ended up with a mess.  Then I added whipped egg whites and cream of tartar thinking I could fix it that way.  Nope.  This recipe is just BAD.  This should be able to be used as a decorator's icing and it can't.  I put some in a bowl after it failed just to see what happened and five minutes later I had about an inch of pure liquid on the bottom.  My advice is find another recipe because I am not inexperienced and it still failed me.

I made this for an order because I ran out of powdered sugar. This recipe really should never be used. Horrible. No where NEAR the consistency of the first picture. Doesn't taste like frosting either. There is no way you can make frosting with more liquids than powders.

This recipe is awful. I used real unsalted butter at room temperature as directed and added a pinch of salt to make up for that. Creamed it up nicely with the sugar. Cooled the thickened milk, added it to the creamed butter and sugar and it just turned into an oily disgusting mess. Super nasty. No thanks. Will NOT make again. This is the first recipe I've done with such positive reviews that's turned out this poorly. :-(

Absolutely terrible! Thought it would work because I had no powdered sugar, but this was a terrible waste of time and food. I followed it perfectly, and the texture was alright. The flavor was flat out disgusting though. DO NOT TRY! Even store bought frosting is better, and I hate that stuff.

So sad. Made this intending to use it with a cake. I followed the instructions exactly. Let the milk mixture cool all the way. Room temp butter. Used a stand mixer. But it turned out looking like curdled nastiness. No idea what the heck is up, but maybe needs better instructions? I folled them to the T! And I got a nasty looking curdled mess. I feel so bad that I had to throw it out. But it had absolutely no use. :(

I made this because I was deciding to test this recipe because I didnt have powdered sugar at home, I used this recipe and it was chunky from the start, then I started beating it all together and it  was still chunky, after about 20 minutes of beating it together, I tasted it, and you could really taste the butter and sugar and it tasted really oily, I do not think you should try this.

This frosting tasted great, the butter flavor really comes through so if you aren't a fan of that you may want a to look for a different recipe. The milk/flour mixture makes this frosting so much fresher and lighter tasting than traditional buttercream, and it really does look like whipped cream. I ran out of powdered sugar and needed to find a recipe that uses granulated sugar, and this recipe blows away any frosting I have made before. I don't know why so many people had lumps, but if you follow the recipe by constantly stirring the flour mixture and cooling it completely before adding to the butter, it will be fine. Also, DO NOT MELT THE BUTTER. This recipe calls for softened butter. 

If your butter stick is too cold, while you are making the flour/milk I suggest heating a glass in the microwave for approx 1 min, then put the butter stick on a plate and place the glass over the butter, being sure to make sure the butter does not touch the glass. The warmth from the glass will soften the butter super fast!

Listen up, my dear reader and fellow viewers of this all recipes dot com page. How can we begin to describe to you the outcome of the recipe? It's simple: stomach-turning. Imagine eating smooth, creamy, delicious frosting. BUT WAIT. There's a LUMP. And then ANOTHER LUMP.  And then MORE AND MORE lumps emerge from the icing. But wait. Hold on. The frosting WASN'T EVEN smooth, creamy, OR delicious in the first place!! How to put this delicately, dear reader? It tasted, to be frank, vaguely of glue. Actually, it tasted exactly of glue. Old, chunky glue left in a supply closet by some forgetful teacher all too long ago. The taste evoked, not distaste, not disgust, but something approximating revolt in all who tried it. And that's without even mentioning the lumps. Before you make a fuss, dear reader, the icing was beaten thoroughly. In fact, we removed our Multi-Mix brand electric mixer from the dishwasher on three occasions to continue beating the foul icing long after it should have been done. We felt like Michael Jackson. And yet, the lumps remained. These chunks were unfortunately made up of boiled milk. All who braved the icing received a mouthful of boiled milk. The squishy, globular, repellent blobs from hell permeated every inch of the icing, and made it frankly inedible. We advise you, dear reader, not to try this. For your sake.

My recipe turned out looking exactly like it is supposed to but the taste and mouthfeel is subpar. When I eat it the frosting is extremely oily/buttery, like an oil slick coats my entire mouth.

Bomb! Used half the amount of the flour/milk mixture and used heavy cream instead of milk also added some heavy cream to the frosting after I whipped it for a while because it was still a little grainy but after I did that PERFECTION! Perfect consistency and went perfect with my chocolate cupcakes.

Best Frosting recipe EVER!!!

Beat sugar, room temperature butter, and vanilla together for ten minutes. Meanwhile mix flour and milk in small saucepan until thick and starts to bubble. Cool milk mixture till room temperature then add to butter sugar mixture and beat on high for 5 minuets till nice and creamy... so simple and delicious!

This frosting is delicious, creamy, and easy to make
for chocolate I add a few spoons of cocoa powder
a few tips: add a pinch of salt while mixing because this can be a little to sweet. When I'm done mixing everything I put this in the blender for a minute or so because there are (what I'm pretty sure are) little milk lumps that my mixer won't get rid of

I tried making with eggless cupcakes, and my cupcakes turned out great. I loved this recipe. At first when I added the thickened milk, my perfectly smooth, frosting-like mixture turned all soupy. When I beat it some more, it turned out to be a little better, but at the end I still had to add more sugar, and scrape up all the extra butter and sugar I had. When I finished making it, it was creamy but still too thin. After frosted on the cupcake, I tasted it, and it tasted badly like butter. I followed the recipe exactly, but it still tasted buttery. Luckily, the extra sugar made it a little better but I wouln’t reccomend this to picky families. It was OK.

I was given this recipe many years ago by my grandmother as a topping for our family favourite chocolate cake recipe. The funny thing is that I never had the instructions to cook the milk and flour. I always just threw all the ingredients in a bowl and whipped it until it was creamy. It always turned out great that way!

This is seriously the best frosting ever. My family is super picky about frostings and doesn't care for classic buttercream at all but they go nuts over this frosting. I usually use 1 1/2 cups cream instead of milk and  4 tbsp flour because I find this makes it fluffier (milk still usually works fine, but cream is just a little bit superior). I've made a butterscotch cupcake with this and used brown sugar instead of granulated sugar and it worked amazing!

I halved the recipe since I made cupcakes. The frosting just tasted too much like sweet, fluffy butter. It wasn't terrible but I will probable never make this again. I'll wait until I have confectioner's sugar to make real icing.

I wanted to my mum some cupcakes yesterday evening, but realised I was all out of icing sugar and as it was after 4, shops was closed. so I found this recipe. I was a bit unsure at first but I decided to go for it. for all of you saying this recipe didn't work, you are obviously doing something wrong because I loved it. I used granuled sugar and 1% milk but it didn't affect the taste at all. I even added cocoa powder to make it chocolate and that working. It was just like whipped cream, soft and delicious. like heaven on a chocolate cupcake! my mum loved them. this had def been added to my recipe book. thankyou for a great recipe!

It was way too buttery and lacked flavor. It just tasted kind of greasy in my opinion and although the texture was very light and fluffy to work with, eating it was a very different story.  I followed the recipe to a T but it just was not something I could use or would make again.

I first made it on a horribly hot, humid day and didn't cream the butter and sugar together until the crystals were very small.  I ended up beating it for over 1/2 an hour! (My mixer at the time was a wimp.) Since then I have learned to cook the milk and flour until it is stiff, make sure the butter is room temperature and cream it with the sugar for a good while, then add the paste. If I do all this, it mixes quickly, even in the humid Mississippi summers! This is our favorite recipe, so good you want to eat it plain!

This is amazing when prepared as written, but you can change the flavors to suit your tastes.  The kids prefer vanilla, but the adults like when I substituted the vanilla with almond extract and then topped it with toasted coconut.  Mmmmmmm.  I'll never use another recipe for frosting!!!

This recipe is so delicious.  I added a bit of lemon juice because I was putting it on a white cake and I wanted some refreshing flavor on it.  If you have a Kitchen Aid mixer it is a breeze to make.

The taste was great.  The consistency was good but it did not sit at room temperature good.  It became 'weepy' and started sliding off the cupcakes.  I did like the taste but I needed it to 'sit' longer.

Good!! I'm still a LITTLE on the fence with this one though... there's no doubt that it's a good frosting, but it doesn't have much flavor. Basically if you pair it with a cake with lots of flavor, it's perfect... but if you are hoping to get sweetness from the frosting, this might not be the best choice. It is very mild, not too sweet at all. Really unique frosting though and it's SO SOFT! Thanks :)

This is the best frosting I have ever tasted! I hate most frostings because they're grainy and far too sweet. This was incredibly smooth and had a full, but not overwhelming, flavor. It'd make a great base for flavored frostings also. This is the only frosting recipe I will ever use again. It's amazing and I love it!

I guess I should mention that I used a blend of whole flour and unbleached all-purpose. It didn't seem to affect the flavor or texture. Also, after reading a number of reviews I decided to do half granulated and half confectioners' sugar, as I had no caster sugar, and ground the granules down as I creamed the butter mixture. The butter I used was unsalted, my vanilla was pure rather than imitation, and the milk was whole.

I hope that helps. I'm glad this recipe is so forgiving considering some of my more unusual ingredients. I can't say enough just how well it came out!

So wonderful. I was looking for a new frosting to use that doesn't harden like a buttercream frosting would. This was just the ticket. It does take quite some time to make even with a standing mixer.

For those who said it came out runny, the recipe was not followed at all. If it is done as said, it comes out thick and creamy. Amazing recipe. I use it ALL the time. If followed properly, it WORKS. I have added Mascarpone or Creme Fraiche to  it. I have refrigerated it overnight, and the next day you have to let it come to room temperature, and then whip again. Important it must be warmed a bit. Set bowl in warm water if you want to go faster. Tried and proven.

This wasn't the best icing, but it sufficed in a pinch. Definitely don't use anything less than 2% milk unless you want a runny mess!

When I made it I did it wrong. DO NOT MELT THE BUTTER! Trust me. Just let it sit at room temp to soften. And it may take a while to form so be patient. I give it 3 stars because the directions were not clear. I had to have my moms help on this one.

Very tasty!  Used skim milk, but needed to add mixtures over ice and then used mixer.

A very tasty frosting... even better after two days in the fridge! However, my frosting came out a bit lumpy, which is likely my fault. I will be a little more careful next time when I heat the milk and flour together.

This was a very good tasting icing, but when I put them on my cupcakes they were a bit runny. It may have been I did not let the milk cool long enough. I gave this recipe 4 Stars because it was sort of runny. I will use this recipe again.

I did not like this at all. Tasted very bad, didn't get a great texture and not good for decorating. I would not recommend this. I have made plenty of frosting before and this is by far the worst.

I followed the review marked ***IMPORTANT**** and am so glad I did!  I almost used my usual tub-butter and think I would have been disappointed.  One note of advice, use the electric mixer and whip the heck out of it! Be patient because it takes a bit to "look like whip cream" but it will get there.  Also the flavor was great!

increase the flour to 5 Tablespoons, and make sure to whisk like crazy to prevent lumps! Also, cook until really really thick.

Thanks to Carol's recipe and Justme's tips this is my go-to frosting recipe - I wouldn't use anything else!  It's light, creamy and not too sweet/sugary.  Definitely a frosting you could eat with a spoon and not feel ill.  

I rushed the process once and got a "skin" on the top of my cooled milk/flour mixture which didn't blend in to the rest of the mixture and made it lumpy.  My fault.  

Follow justme's tips and this will be your new favorite frosting, too!

Holy cow!  I just made this frosting and followed the directions posted by JustMe in 2007 and it is extraordinary!  Beat the daylights out of it, make sure everything is the proper temperature.  It is so light and fluffy, perfect for frosting and piping.  I hope to be able to incorporate cream cheese somehow.  Has anyone else already done this?

This was really good I did have lumps but still good. I added a bit of icing sugar I felt it needed a bit more sweetness to make it less buttery tasting. Will def make again.

I am not a big fan of icing, but it is needed at times.  I made a batch to try it out, not expecting anything special.  Boy, was I surprised!!! This is an amazing icing, and it keeps its shape, even at room temperature.  I love the fact that it's not overly sweet, and that it's fluffy in texture.  Overall, I would say this is one of the best icings I've worked with.  Make sure you mix the flour with a bit of milk and mix really well.  This will help you avoid the "lumps" some reviewers encountered.  I also added the ¼ teaspoon of corn starch someone mentioned, and my icing turned out great!  Another trick is not not over cook the flour/milk mixture, get it off the heat before it gets too dry -- it's tough to explain, but it should still look like a custard.  I love this recipe!

Followed recipe straight up. I added the milk/flour combo spoon by spoon. Family and friends loved it. I had enough to frost about 36 cupcakes. Piped real easy. Recipe made look like a star. Thank you.

WOW - this is just wonderful. I am not an icing person as it is way too sweet for me, so I usually stick with whipped cream and a little icing sugar. I followed the instructions as suggested by "Just Me" and it came out wonderful. I must admit I did use room temperature tub margarine (Flora) and it held well and was not slimy at all. Everyone loved the creamy taste and was surprised when I said there was no icing in it! Absolutely the best try ever!

I think this was just an average frosting, I used all butter and tried just 2 cups of confectioner sugar and thought it tasted too "waxy" so I add the whole 4 cups of sugar and I didn't find that made it too sweet. I was making a cherry frosting so I added cherry juice and chopped up cherries and still found it kind of bland.  Overall not bad just average.  Definitely easy too make though.

this is a butter cream frosting if you replace the butter with shorting  then you get what almost every store uses on their cakes (shorting makes it thicker)  turned out amazing but its vary butter tasting  not a fan but still good also i didn't have any white sugar so i used brown and that worked just the same

Delicious! I put this on Rainbow Cupcakes. :) The frosting is pretty rich. The milk and flour mixture takes a good hour or so to cool, so be sure the make it early if your in a hurry. This is a really easy frosting to put in a pastry bag.

I only had 1% milk on hand and it still turned out perfect.  Great vanilla taste and extremely light and fluffy.  I will use this recipe again, it is less sugary tasting than store bought tubs.

I don't know what all the fuss is about this recipe. I wanted to try something new because I love to bake.  This frosting was way too runny.  Although the taste wasn't bad, I wouldn't make it again.  I followed it to the t and it still didn't turn out.  Big disappoinment

Best frosting EVER!!! I've been making this for years, it was passed down to me by my Grandmother. The only difference is that I use 5 tbsp's of flour....  The longer you beat it the better it tastes!

I did not care for this. The texture was fine and I didn't have any issues with sugar being grainy or the frosting being lumpy... but it tasted like sweet lard! I really felt like when I licked the spoon I was licking sweetened Crisco! It was extremely thick and personally- in-eatable!

This was my first attempt at making frosting, and it came out absolutely delicious!  I followed JustMe's advice, and although the cooled gelatinous milk/flour mixture creeped me out a little, it was pretty simple.  The frosting tastes like a mix between a cool whip frosting, and a butter cream, which makes it creamy and not too sweet.  I will be making this again very soon!

Great tasting, creamy frosting.  Recipe does not yield enough to cover and fill a two layer 9" cake.  Does not hold up well for extensive piping (esp. if you have "hot hands".)  When cooling flour/milk mixture be sure to place plastic wrap directly on top or it will form a skin that WILL NOT beat out.

i think i did something wrong, because it ended up very runny and it separated, so there is white chunks floating in a syrupy clear liqiud. i think i microwaved the butter too long.

I made this because my daughter does not like how sweet most frostings are. This tastes great, no one minded the grainy texture. The only change I made was to use 1 tbsp Mexican vanilla.

I was a little skeptical about this recipes because of some of its bad reviews but it turned out perfect. I found the tips that "justme" wrote in their review. This recipes takes time and patience for it to turn out. I used it to frost a two layer jello poke cake. It has a silky texture and does look like whipped cream. It is nice for a change from overly sweet icings. Just remember you do have to beat it for a long time for the sugar to dissolve and become fluffy.

I've made this frosting a few times. When it turns out, it is fantastic, but when it does not, it is terrible. Make sure the milk and flour mixture is really thick before you cool it. It also must be COMPLETELY cool before you add it to the sugar and butter mix. Make sure to add the milk and flour mix to the CREAMED butter and sugar. Do not add the butter and sugar to the milk and then whip; it will not turn out. I used tub margarine when I made this tonight and it turned out fine.

I knew I should have read more reviews on this. I did everything that the directions said, but it turned out a little runny. Left it in the fridge for a while, and it was better. It's more like a buttercream frosting because it had a really buttery taste, but still good. DO NOT heat it too much 2 minutes on medium should be ok.

If you haven't read JustMe's advice for this recipe - go do that right now.  I wish I had before making it...  This turned out really tasty, but looked wretched and didn't hold up well at all.  When sitting at room temp, it would become a melty, greasy mess.  Upon refrigeration, it would look all curdled. I'm definitely gonna try again, but strictly follow JustMe's tips.

This is the only frosting recipe I will ever use from on now, I did'nt have any confectioners sugar-so I tried this and they all loved it-loved it! I put it on cupcakes-but, bet it's great on cookies too. Just make sure really do wait for it to cool down, I was impatient and the warm milk kind of melted the butter but, after a few mins. back in the fridge it was great. THANK YOU!! P.S. What's a good way to turn this into a chocolate frosting? Then I'll be set!

It was good but way too much vanilla.  Next time I will use half the vanilla or none at all, because it was too sweet.  I used all organic ingredients to make it and it did turn out good.  I guess maybe because I was using it for sugar cookies that's what made it seem too sweet, maybe it would be delicious on a cake.

I thought that the frosting was great and I had no trouble at all getting it to a good texture following the hints of other reviewers. It was a very light, fresh texture and taste. The only change I would make is to use caster sugar next time (or superfine) to eliminate the very slight touch of graininess.

This recipe didn't turn out to great for me. I made it to put on chocolate cupcakes and it didn't taste that good. The frosting never got fluffy like whipped cream. It was real runny and tasted too buttery and not much like frosting.

Didn't work for me. Followed the directions but it never got to a frosting whipped consistency. Even tried doing it manually with a whisk for awhile didn't work that way either. My Kitchenaid stand mixer was on for most of a one hour long tv show, this frosting would not form, it just looked curdled and runny. I put it in a frosting bag and tried my best with this, I ended up doing thinner swirls with gourmet dark chocolate topping to distract from the frostings appearance, and I topped it off with orange zest (I had made orange cake cupcakes) and crushed raw almonds. The frosting tasted good nonetheless but how can butter, sugar and milk not taste good? Will look for another recipe.

Good frosting, very buttery.  Followed the advice of the first reviewer and consistently mixed the butter/flour mixture until thick.  No lumps, nice consistency when completed.

This recipe is great.  Ifollowed all the tips in the prior review and it came out awesome.  Nice and creamy, great flavor that is not over sweet like most frostings.

I really like this frosting. It was easy to make and it is easily colored. It was a clean white when I was finished. The flavor is good but not the best. Definitely let the flour/milk mixture cool completely before adding to the rest of the ingredients and make sure your butter is room temp.

It tasted great and never curdled or anything like that but thickening on the stove took forever, I know it's supposed to but I hate that part.  Totally worth it for this yummy icing.  I followed the "extra" directions from JustMe and it was perfect.

I was looking for a frosting recipe that didn't require powdered sugar (since I was out).  This recipe was great!  I loved the whipped cream texture.  It was so yummy!!

This recipe is delicious.  This is the first time I made it and it turned out fabulously.  You made want to increase the amount you make if you like a lot of frosting.  Use unsalted butter softened at room temp.  Make sure the thickened milk is room temp cool.  When this is all whipped together it tastes like the whipped frosting on cakes from Sam's Club.  Totally awesome frosting!!!

This was delicious!  I needed an easy recipe b/c my 3yr old decided at supper that he wanted to make cupcakes for dessert!!  I had a boxed cake mix, but needed icing.  This did the trick perfectly.

This recipe is hard because it is just like making gravy and it is hard to get the lumps out, but if you can master that it really taste great. Also an alternative to the 1 cup butter, use 1/2 cup of margarine and 1/2 cup crisco. Make sure the flour milk mix is completely cooled and the butter is at room temperature.

This turned out wonderful on my daughter's first birthday cake. At first taste, right after icing the cake, I could taste the flour, but as the cake set for a few hours, I thought the flavor improved and I could not taste the flour any more.

I was a little scared to try this recipe due to the mixed reviews, but it turned out as promised - looking like whipped cream.  It's really more of a buttery frosting than creamy frosting, though.  I recommend using superfine sugar instead of regular granulated sugar.

This recipe whipped together just fine (make sure the milk and flour mixture cools completely), but it is extremely rich, very buttery, and might be best suited for a cake kept in the refrigerator.

It was good but i would not say it was the best.  It is one of the better frosting recipes I have tried but the texture is not as good as the store bought kind.  The flavor is better than packaged frosting but the texture is not as good if you are looking for a frosting to truly decorate a cake.

This frosting tastes good, but takes some time to make.  You have to allow enough time for the milk and flour mixture to cool.  It definitely looks fluffy, but it also glistened and looked as though it were melting.  Neat if you want something to look like snow or you can't refrigerate a whipped topping.

This was the perfect frosting! Not too sweet like store bought, like a lovely buttercream.
We added a few drops of red food coloring to make it pink, other than that followed the receipt as is

I would definitely make it again! It was delicious, it was smooth and creamy, and easy to spread. I added 1tbsp cocoa and that worked good, tasted just as good. I also made another batch and added food colouring.

I had the same problem, curdled and I couldn’t get it to work without more flour - which I did add more but if I added even more it would have taken all the sweet taste out.  I think it was my fault because I only watched the video and it didn’t look all that thick in her pot so I thought when it cooled it wouldn’t thicken more.  I think this was my problem- (the flour mixture ).  I’m giving it a 3 because it tastes just like my moms and she cannot make it for us anymore.  She always used a recipe that had to be very close to this for coconut cake - she LOVED coconut cake! And this tasted very much like it- that alone will bump it up to five.   I want to try it again and hopefully I can find this post and rerate it!  I figure 3 is average and good enough for now.  But again, I don’t think it was the recipe.    It wasn’t until it failed that I was able to find the written recipe - I thought it was weird it wasn't available in writing, I should have known better

Overall disappointed. My fault though mostly because I didn’t have stick butter and used margarine.  Huge difference!  I haven’t tried with regular butter so I’m not  sure but definitely don’t use margarine as a substitute!  It makes the frosting really really soupy. . I was hoping to use this as a cupcake topping but it just drips down the sides leaving a naught looking cake........  I’m sure it’s due to the margarine though. I’m going to try and refrigerate it to see if that helps any. The color was a pale yellowish and I find it hard to believe that the photos/videos of it are this recipe mostly because it’s shown so pure white. Unless it’s edited. The taste is AMAZING though! It’s  like ice cream! What’s not to like about sugar, butter and vanilla though, right?

I was unsure because it was gross and gritty before i added the smooth, thick mixture simmering away on the stove, but when i added it, it was all i could do to stop from eating it. Loved it so much! Also, add a bit of sugar at the end for a nice tasty spice.

Hi Carol! I’m thirteen years old and as a boy with near non experience in the kitchen I was able to easily Frost the cake I made following your instructions without my mom! It looks great, tastes great and anyone can make it easily unless they use improper ingredients!

Thank you Carol!

followed the directions exactly, i didnt melt the butter like others did. this does not come together. i mixed for like 1/2 hr and it stayed liquid with whipped cream texture on the edges. it was better before adding the thickened milk. i should have just made buttercream

This recipe is just perfect as is.  I think some people may make the mistake of not completely cooling the milk mixture . I sit my pan in a sink of ice water, and stir frequently to release any steam.  I'm not sure why some people would melt the butter as the recipe says softened butter.  The butter should still hold it's shape.  I've been using this recipe for years and always get a lot of complements .

This was excellent! I added 1/4 c cacao powder (but no extra fat) and it was perfect! The sheet pan brownies said to add frosting while the brownies were still hot, so the butter did melt. Just let it cool completely before I served. It was great!

I cooled the milk/flour mixture in the refrigerator.  Will make again.

I love cream cheese frosting and never related that I loved it because of how similar the flavor and texture of it is. I just make half the recipe and 2 tbsp less of butter (by mistake because the stick was smaller). It was my brother who made the relationship of the flavor. This is a keeper for me now!

I loved this recipe! This is that melt in your mouth buttercream texture.  The only change was to add just a few drops of almond extract to the vanilla.  You have to use the real thing in your butter and flavorings to get the best results.

As much as I bake, I constantly forget to pick up icing sugar. This recipe has saved me so many times!! At first I wasn't sure about it, especially the taste, but I've found that I much prefer this to a traditional buttercream.

I followed the directions closely and was highly disappointed. The taste was right, but it was too runny. I'd try 1 cup of milk instead of 2.

Followed the directions exactly, except adding 2 drops of food coloring into the flour mix, and this was a lumpy, gross mess. Maybe I'll try again, but right now I'm just going to wash out my mixer and try another recipe.

Takes entirely too long if using a hand mixer, tastes like whipped butter and that's with vanilla and almond extract added. I would not make this again even if someone paid me to. Also is not easy to spread at all.

When I first made the frosting I assumed that it would be ready to use right away. It defiantly was not. Right after I made  it I tried it out and there were sugar crystals in it . Once my sister came home (about 2 hours later) she tried it and it had next to no crystals at all. Then after mixing it one more time they dispersed almost entirely but the icing had weird little clear pieces inside. Later I realized it was because when boiling the milk and flour I set the temperature to high and instead was supposed to cook it longer, at a lower temp. When making this for a second time it turned out fantastic.

Conclusion: If you are going to make this let it set after mixing for a few hours and then mix again,and cook the milk on low for 15 min or so, instead of 2 min on high. (Don't forget to keep stirring the whole time ESPECIALLY the lowest level of milk , as to not create lumps)

I halved the recipe and it was very sweet. I'm thinking next time I'll put a little less sugar in. Other than that, I really liked it. Tastes like buttercream with added cream. Yum.

I get migraine headaches if I have powered sugar frosting. This creamy frosting made right is super delicious.  It's made of milk, all-purpose flour, butter, white sugar and vanilla extract. Try it 
I highly recommend it.  It does come out like whip cream.

I wanted a "cooked" frosting because I don't like the cornstarch taste of confectioner's sugar.  The reviews were correct -- commit to doing it right, and it turns out delicious.  Here's my own version:  Before I got started, I pulverized the sugar in my mini-cuisinart to make it more like castor sugar.  In place of regular flour, I used Wondra flour and the milk thickened up quickly.  I don't own a standing mixer, I have a "sit down mixer" (meaning I was going to be there a while with my little hand mixer, so I pulled up a chair.) In addition to the vanilla, I added a scant drop, maybe 1/16th of a teaspoon of almond extract.  My only regret was that I made a half-batch because I only needed to frost the top of a 9" x 13" cake.  It was just barely enough.

Love this recipe!!! I was a little nervous at first making a frosting without powdered sugar but I like so much better. Add the flour super slowly to the milk and increase heat incrementally to avoid scalding and lumps. Make sure it's completely cool (I put mine in the fridge for 10 minutes) before adding to cream. I used a hand mixer for the cream and final blending and it turned out great. It became smooth almost instantly and tastes great.       1/2 tsp lemon extract if you like lemony flavors,  Never buying frosting again :)))

I added cocoa powder to the frosting so it wasn't as plain. However, I don't think that putting that in was the cause of what happened. When I stirred the icing together,  it was fine, but when I left the icing it started to separate. To give an analogy of what it looked like, it looked like canned dog food. This might of been my fault, but there were booger like chunks of thickened milk in the frosting. So basically it looked like dog food with boogers in it, appetising right??

Horrible.  Made according to directions, whipped butter and sugar into a fluff, thickened milk until a spoon would stand up in it, put them together and got a runny mess.  Tried to whip it for a long time and got the same runny mess.  Put it into fridge to firm up and got something useable but not at all what I was hoping for.  Going back to traditional frosting with powdered sugar, there is no substitute.

I made this recipe and I couldn't get it to become creamy like in the pictures. I tried again but I got the same results. I tried to mix it for a while but had to stop because I thought my mixer was going to overheat. I'm disappointed because I even added in powdered sugar to try and fix it but to no avail. I had to wash everything I used for 20-30 minutes because the butter was sticking to them and would not come off. My work area was a mess after and everything was coated with butter. I would DEFINITELY never try this recipe again.

Why did it turn out all gooey? I think there should be a way to whisk it without having and electric mixer and not have to use a stove. And I lost all my butter.

Worked great!! For me I personaly didn’t really like how you had to wait for it to cool??. But I put in freezer for about 10-15 mins and it worked out great! I didn’t use stand mixer I don’t know how it works with a stand mixer ? But with a hand held mixer worked great!

This tastes great; if it looked half as good as it tastes, we'd be golden. 

I followed the recipe to the letter, but the consistency was soupy, and the vanilla extract turned it this murky brown colour. Definitely not the fluffy whipped-cream look I was promised.

I'm hoping  some time in the fridge will salvage this mess, but I'm not optimistic.

ETA: went out and bought icing sugar. Could not save the sludge, so went with my standby recipe. Serves me right for not having the right supplies in the first place.

This was great kind of did somethings my way like poured everything into one bowl but DO NOT MELT BUTTER while you are baking the main part have your butter sitting out if it was in the refrigerator, I used a little corn starch to help the process go a little faster and you need 4tablespoons of flour and I also poured everything into a pot and boiled it all at once mixed until I thought it was good let it sit in the fridge for a little and its great!

Well I unfortunately had to make changes due to what I have and allergies in the house. I used coconut flour instead of regular flour (ran out making the cake) and I used vanilla soy milk instead of milk as my little guy has a milk allergy. I also used margarine (I know) instead of butter because I didn't have any. 
Had the margarine at room temp and whipped it with the sugar and vanilla.
Cooked the soy milk with a pinch of cornstarch as a reviewer had mentioned and let it heat up and added in the coconut flour. About just over 1 tablespoon. Cooked it for a bit whisking. Then let it cool. When I added it to the sugar margarine mix I noticed it was a little runny so I added a bit more cornstarch and it thickened amd fluffed right up. It tasted like a mox between marshmallow and whipped cream. My kid even told me it was the best ever. 
Even though I had to tweak it I would see no reason the original wouldn't be just as delicious.

I’m not a baker. But can usually fake my way through with a good recipe. Not the case here. It looks like I made a batch of sand. Tastes like sweetened condensed milk. Definitely not for me. This isn’t a dessert topping. The consistency is awful and there is no fluff to it. This is more of a loose pudding.

Without a doubt, the BEST icing that I've ever made. The secret is in the (thorough)cooling of the milk/flour mixture. Also, I used another reviewer's suggestion of adding the sugar to the cooling mixture which not only aided the cooling process but also eliminated any grittiness.

It would be fine for a cake, but not fluffy like it said it would be. I mixed mine for around 40 minutes and it never got fluffy.  Very flat and not sweet. Never going to use this recipe again.

After reading some of the reviews I procrastinated about making it.  After a few days I just went for it, since I don't like the taste of store bought powdered sugar in homemade frosting.  If your frosting isn't creamy and thick enough you either didn't thickening the milk right or you added the milk before it was cooled off.  If you messed it up don't throw it out!  Just store it and wait til you either have a lil powdered sugar to add or add some cream cheese.  The color of your frosting will depend totally on your butter.  Some companies add food coloring to make it yellow, as we all know cream is white.  I used a hand mixer and had no problems whatsoever.

I was looking for a recipe that did not require powdered sugar and this seemed like a good one to try.  I am picky about my frosting.  The end result to this tasted like a mock buttercream made with shortening instead of butter.  When I spend a lot of time AND use "real" ingredients, it should not end up tasting fake.  Not a fan.

I love this recipe! I have used it about four times already. I too add the sugar to the warm milk and flour mixture until the sugar dissolves, then add it to the whipped butter.  Then you don't have to mix it for as long. It's so light & fluffy and not too sweet.

This recipe did not work at all.  I followed the recipe perfectly, but the mixture stayed the same texture no matter how much I mixed it. In no way did the "frosting" resemble whipped cream. It was too runny to even think about putting it on top of cupcakes . The only good thing that came from this recipe was the taste.

It, at first, was a bit soupy, but after a reasonable amount of whisking, it was marvelously light, fluffy, and sweet. I highly recomend  it for people who would like an easy, tasty frosting. I will definately use this recipe again. I suggest, if you find it a bit too runny for your taste, to continue mixing it. It makes a considerable difference.

I've known this recipe as Ermine Frosting / Boiled Flour Frosting . Nice creamy light flavor. I made mine using 3.5 tablespoons flour + 0.5 tbsp corn starch. Turned out wonderfully even with keeping milk/flour mixture just below boiling point (due to additional flour addition to avoid scorching). Definetly necessary to allow thickened roux to cool prior to incorporating into creamed butter/sugar combo. When done correctly - adding cooled roux slowly while beating butter/sugar everything comes together with no problems- the constant whipping helps blend the sugar crystals and when done right there is no graininess or flour taste. For the whitest color I would recommend imitation clear vanilla and you could always add a slight amount of white gel food color . I'm considering trying this using heavy cream and 1/2 shortening 1/2 unsalted butter to see if the change would add a little more depth to the flavor and increase overall whiteness.

Usually if I am all out of confectioner's sugar, I just do a glaze or I give up on the idea of icing.  Despite my initial skepticism (cold gravy + whipped butter = icing???)...I just tried this recipe, and it worked out just fine.  I used it for oatmeal cookie sandwiches.

I've used this recipe several times and it always turns out great! It's light enough that you can still taste the actual cupcake which is great if you don't love super sweet frosting.

This is a good recipe but the milk and flour definitely needs to be cooled, and I suggest adding flavoring since the vanilla didn't show through

It came out very creamy and rich. It tasted almost like whip cream... my problem with it is that it tasted so much like butter it kinda ruined it for me. I would make it again and try to find a suitable alternative to make up for half the butter.

Looking for a recipe that didnt need powdered sugar. I had my doubts it could be done. This recipe was quick and easy. It was very light and fluffy, very buttery. Tasted like whipped cream frosting. I will keep this in my recipe box for the next time I  run out of powdered sugar. Used a hand mixer, no problems, whipped up quickly. Very white and fluffy didnt separate. Used softened real butter not melted. Used clear strawberry flavor from watkins.

Super easy & delicious. Really handy if you don't have powdered sugar on hand. However, I failed to read the part about letting the flour/milk mixture cool... I quickly realized I messed up when I poured the hot liquid into my butter & sugar. So be sure to use some common sense and let the flour/milk cool, otherwise you'll have a melted-butter mess!

The second time I made it, I added 1 tablespoon of cocoa powder along with the 2 tablespoons of flour. I let that cool in the freezer for a while. It didn't take long for it to become a whipped-cream like texture, maybe 3 minutes in my standing mixer. Super fluffy and delicious - it melts in your mouth and that 1 tablespoon of cocoa powder really makes a difference.

Just what I was looking for! It took a while with hand beaters (we're currently at a vacation house without a stand mixer) but it was definitely worth it. Thanks!

Great recipe! I didn't have any problems making this. I didn't even need to use an electric mixer, I just whisked it by hand. I didn't have to soften the butter at all. I blended it in as well as I could with the sugar and vanilla while the milk and flour mix was heating up. This recipe is great because my little brother doesn't usually like the cake or cookies that I make because he says that they're not sweet enough. I just added some of this to one of the cookies and he loved it!

This frosting is terrible. This is the second time I've made it and both times it came out looking like cheese curds and tasting like a mouthful of sugary oil. In the time it takes to boil the stuff, cool it and whip it (and whip it and whip it and whip it), I could've just run to the store, grabbed some powdered sugar and made decent frosting! So not worth the trouble.

Perseverance is key. 

When I first mixed the milk mixture with the creamed butter mixture (I had let it cool slightly first) I was having trouble mixing it and it was maintaining a gritty texture. I was about to give up on it when I decided to put it into the refrigerator for about 20 minutes or so. 
When I took it out again and mixed it more it came together very nicely and does quite take on the taste of whipped cream. 

Great in a pinch where I had no powdered sugar. Would make again.

This is my go-to base for perfect, buttery frosting!! It is to die for. Sooo good!! I have modified this with lavender, and also with vanilla powder for a perfect "vanilla bean" version. Use unsalted butter, and have lots of patience. It's worth it!!! My butter was room-soft and not liquid, and overall it absolutely required a long mixing time to really dissolve the sugar. But the flavour is far beyond what an icing sugar-based frosting would offer!

This came out so delicious.  I have been trying to find a recipe that does not use powdered sugar since it is hard to find in Manila.  This was perfect.  After reading a few of the suggestions, I tweaked the recipe to make sure it came out smooth and with the right consistency. I used 4 TBSP flour and instead of adding the sugar later, I heated it with the milk and flour to dissolve the crystals. Cooled it in the refrigerator and added the butter.  It was light and fluffy after 2 minutes with a hand mixer. Definitely a keeper

I did not like this recipe at all. It left me with chunky vomit-looking pudding. I can't even look at the frosting because I am so disappointed and might throw up just by gazing at it. Everything went well until the very last step. I had followed the recipe exactly how it stated but it left my enraged. Now I have to eat unfrosted cupcakes. You ruined my day! I hope your happy. Good day sir!

Update- I pushed myself to taste the abomination and it taste like sugary play-doh. no one wants to eat sugary play-doh. Would you? I thought so. Instead i had to use nutella (not complaining but I was really hoping for some delicious non-vomit-y frosting)

Btw- You should read my comment but in an angry British accent just emphasize my anger. Thank you. I hope you live a happy life except the person who made this recipe.

If chilled slightly between mixing and fluffing it's just like buttery whipped cream, super yummy.

I am so glad I have found this delicious recipe. Instead of using Vanilla Extract, I use Chambord which is a Raspberry liquor and it taste wonderful. Everyone loves it and I do recommend this to anyone. This recipe is so much better than the ones using ice sugar in their recipes. Give this a try, you will not be disappointed.

I just finished making this and it was easy and turned out delicious. I added that 1/4 tsp of cornstarch suggested to smooth it out and on the last step, used a standard mixer for arnd 3 mins. This was my first time making any kind of frosting, it's very encouraging when you find a recipe that turns out so well at first try. The butter mixture was yellow, but it shouldn't be after you put in the cooled milk mixture. Am definitely gonna play arnd with it, probably make it less sweet and color it pink.

This recipe turned out perfect! The real trick is to make sure that the heated portion is fully cooled before its added to the rest... All together a great frosting, I'll definitely be making it again in the future.

I was all out of icing sugar and had no time to run to the grocery store, so I thought I'd try this recipe.  I loved this, soft and light, I dumped mini chocolate chips in the flour mixture after it was cooked, they melted easily, when cooled I then whipped into sugar/butter mixture. Awesome on my brownie recipe.

I expected the frosting to be a more of a white color, it turned into a more of a yellow/beige color. The frosting turned out delicious and I do not regret making it. ?? I put it on banana cupcakes and it tastes very very good!!!

I made an account for the sole purpose  of telling you how to save this icing if it's curdled.  You take 1/4th of the icing, sometimes less sometimes more, and you heat it in the micowave until it's liquid, not hot, doesn't have to be hot, but until it's a smooth liquid, then beating your remaining icing on high, slowly add in the liquid. Beat until smooth, this will save any curdled home made icing. This recipe is exactly what I've wanted for years. Not too sweet, good flavor, isn't thick and gloopy, wonderful.

I love this recipe! It is an easy frosting recipe by definition. However, the description of "Easy" does not necessarily mean "Quick". The only changes I made were to add 1 Tbs of flour ( 4 Tbs might actually turn out better), about 1/4 cup more sugar and I never measure my vanilla but if I had to guess I'd say I used around 1 Tbs or a little more. After thickening the milk/flour mixture I set it outside for 15 minutes ( it is chilly out but placing in the fridge would work as well). Following directions really is a must! I used butter from a tub so I didn't need to get it to room temp. It mixed/creamed well with the sugar and vanilla. Adding all ingredients together I then let it sit for an hour while my cake cooled. I made an extra moist classic yellow cake with pudding in it to give it that extra moist consistency.

It was really good i do suggest that if you pour the thickened milk in while its still hot so then it gets liquidy add 3 egg whites and just keep beating them (an electric beater works best) until it gets thick again thanks worked really well

I read the reviews, took some of the suggestions but followed the recipe pretty much. The mixture seemed to curdle, and even after letting the butter sit out overnight, I found butter in the bottom of the bowl. I wouldn't make this again, nor recommend it. Unfortunately I ended up using it, but it was really bad.

Fluffy but waaaayyyyy too buttery. Next time I'll try with 1/2 the butter.  Made us sick to our stomachs...I guess we're not used to eating entire sticks of butter with sugar.

Initially it was kinda coagulated but I just left it mix on high with my whisk attachment and voila some yummy icing. I will use this again and it's amazing with white cake. So much better than prefab .

The recipe itself was easy to make and came out exactly as stated.  I did stir the milk and flour continuously while cooking and let the mixture cool completely before adding it.  I used a hand mixer and the consistency was perfect with little effort.

However I  found that it tasted too much of butter and left a greasy feel in the mouth.  This recipe is not something I would make again, but if you love butter this ones for you.

I followed all the instructions and it turned out to be a clear, custard kind of paste. I was disappointed because even though it was sweet, it was definitely NOT frosting. When I first saw the picture, and how normal the frosting looked, I was excited that the frosting could be made without special sugar. It turned out very bad. Next time I am going to use a real frosting recipe with special sugar. This can be used as a sweet dip.

I didn't have enough powdered sugar to make a traditional buttercream... This ended up being a great solution! I substituted almond flavoring for the vanilla, and put it on chocolate cake. Delicious!

This frosting is a great alternative for those of us who don't like the powdered sugar filled ones. It needs to be made properly, however. If you don't know how to cream butter and sugar, this is not the recipe for you. I know, because luckily I was expecting to need a double batch, and the first one I whipped up willy nilly and ended up with bumpy butter clumps. The second time, I realized the error of my ways and made a nice smooth batch and then was able to cream the two together. I didn't have any problems with the milk and flour - although I have found that if you use half heavy cream and half milk, you'll get a better consistency to actually frost with. With both steps, you need to slowly add the ingredients and slowly mix it together - and then know when to stop mixing.

It took me two batches to get right as the first lot of milk wasn't thick enough. Even the second time when I began to combine the milk with the butter and sugar it looked curdled but after reading other reviews I decided to perservere and it turned out great eventually! So my advice is persist and keep mixing even when you think it might be curdled because it's worth it!! I swapped vanilla for orange extract and it was delicious!

Love it. Not real sweet. Looks just like whipped cream if you follow the directions exactly. Someone said add more flour to the milk NOT SO! Follow the recipe.Make sure your butter is room temp. Cream well before adding milk mixture. Use a wire whip when incorporating milk into flour and beat beat beat to get every last lump out before cooking. After cooking til thick, throw in fridge for a bit to quickly chill. If it gets to solid, whip whip whip back to smooth before adding to butter mixture. This is a keeper. It pipes from pastry bag to make impressive swirls.

This frosting turned out great! I followed the recipe for the most part. I made the milk/flour mixture while I was making dinner so it had plenty of time to cool. I did not have a lump problem (I whisked it almost constantly). I followed another reviewers suggestion of how to mix it all together. Creamed butter and sugar for 4 mins, added vanilla then mixed for 2 mins, added half the milk/flour mixture then mixed for 4 mins, then added the rest of the milk/flour mixture and mixed for 4 mins. I did scrape the sides of mixing bowl half way through each step. I was worried about it being grainy (I used granulated sugar because that is "white sugar" to me), but it turned out super smooth. It was a little butter heavy for my taste, but my husband loved it! I'm excited to add strawberry puree next time. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I learned the importance of following directions carefully today while making this. The recipe didn't call for melted butter which I did and it was very liquid y. I tried it again after reading the reviews and getting some suggestions...I didn't use vanilla extract as I didn't have any but I did use a vanilla syrup and that worked maybe even better. It never did start to solidify and thicken into whipped cream texture but it was more than good enough for what I needed it for. I made some homemade cinnamon buns and this icing was the icing on the cake ;)  I also didn't have any powdered sugar which is why I was looking for an icing recipe in the first place...this worked perfectly!
Great recipe! Would definitely use again.

Much too thin, which was disappointing. I don't like wasting ingredients, especially 2 sticks of butter for something inedible. I followed directions, even letting the flour/milk mixture get cold before mixing everything else. It just didn't work.

Exactly what I needed when I ran out of icing sugar and needed a recipe for icing. This is a nice creamy buttercream that uses granular sugar. Follow the directions and make sure you whip it for a while so the sugar dissolves completely.

I was looking for 'flour frosting' that my mom used to make.  I had no issues with lumps.  I used my wire wisk while it was on the stove and never had one lump.  the taste is really good.  the problem comes with the texture.  it was not pipe-worthy.  I wish I had superfine sugar on hand.  I would suggest using this to get the look of a whipped frosting.  i cooled the flour/milk mixture completely and placed it in the fridge.  actually did that portion of it before I even baked my cake so it was completely cool first.  It was whippy tasting but it didn't look whippy and light at all.  I'll keep on looking.  I was fearful that the butter portion would fall out and just be a greasy mess but it didn't.  if the texture of this was to my liking, I'd use this again.

This is more like a glaze then a frosting! It literally has the consistency of pudding. I refrigerated it for over and hour and still didn't thicken. I know I did the milk right because I had to spatula out of pot it would not pour. End product was runny and not cake worthy.

Lol I have actually made this twice. My first time I completely wasn't paying attention and rushing and didn't cool the milk mixture. It turned out fantastic! It's a really creamy and buttery glaze. My kids actually preferred it over frosting. I made it again today completely skipping the cooling process. It pairs great with a chocolate cake.

For those who have the grainy issues : I've added brown sugar in the milk and flour mixture and cook it until it thickened well. Then let it completely cool before adding the soften butter. I whipped it with electric beaters on high for 5 mins until peaks like. Excellent icing!

I was a bit disappointed at first, it looked... interesting. I think because of the granulated sugar. but the texture and taste are absolutely AMAZING. The only thing I didn't like was that it didn't mix well with food coloring.

Do not use Becel margarine.  Too soft. Needs to be the stick kind or butter.  This is the one I have used for 45 plus years.  My daughter asked me to make the chocolate chiffon cake with this frosting  that I used to make for her birthdays when she was little but I misplaced the recipe.  I googled it and Voila;  have found it again.  It is a fabulous recipe.  I think it needs 4 tablespoons flour though. Cut recipe in half for chiffon cake but still used 2 tbsp flour.

I loved this frosting. Light and fluffy. I put it on and between a chocolate cake which reminded me of a Suzy Q if anyone remembers those. It was very easy to make. I have already made it twice and will continue to make it.

I took a chance and without doing this previously made it to frost cupcakes for my twins first birthday. It was great! I did let the butter come to room temperature even though I'm not at all patient and threw the milk mixture in the fridge to cool before adding to the butter. My family loved it and in total I made about 8 batches in one day.  also it took the colors nicely when I used the Wilton colors. I would do this recipe again.

It had the right taste, but the texture and thickness were off. It ended up all lumpy and runny.  Almost got there, but I only had a tiny bit of powdered sugar to begin with.

Horrible recipe. Tried it with my best friend and it turned out terrible. Gooey, Gross and SUPER sweet. Too much butter and sugar, and it didn't whip up into icing. Wouldn't try it again, ruined my entire wedding cake. Would give it 0 stars.

Disappointed, it came out similar to a glaze rather than a whipped cream. I will be using it to frost sugar cookies later on... but i will probably never make this frosting again.

I will make this again!  Make sure to mix the two tablespoons of flour separated in a  bowl with a little bit of the milk until creamy. 

 When heating to a boil make sure to start on medium heat stirring constantly and then let boil  for a minute that doesn't stop when stirring. 

Store in fridge covered with plastic wrap until cool / room. Temperature and add to the butter cream mixture.

I didn't have any cream at home and wanted a nice creamy frosting and this one turned out awesome! Thanks for sharing.

It just broke on me. I followed the recipe and directions to a T, no substitutions or otherwise. When I went to whip, it didn't take in any air, and just broke and looked disgusting. Had to scrap the batch. I have naked cupcakes!

My relationship with this recipe is a love/hate. It tasted fine but I just couldn't get it to whip. I tried for hours! This may not be 100% the icings fault because I had to adjust it to be vegan for my sister (Cashew milk and vegan margarine). I added extra flour but couldn't even get soft peaks. Tasted fine and still went on the cake but very soup like.

Recently found out my daughter is allergic to corn products. It was wonderful to find an icing recipe that didnt contain powder sugar. This one did not disappoint. It was amazing! The only thing I would change is to use fine granulated sugar next time. Mine was slightly gritty because the sugar wouldn't desolve all the way, but was perfect for the cinamon rolls we used it on.

I love this rcepie and something I recommend is let the milk and flour mixture cool completely before adding to butter, sugar, and vanilla because it will melt it and you can't really fix it. But this is a amazing recipe once you master it

This recipe is fantastic! It's perfectly sweet, creamy and a beautiful white color.  My only complaint is that the sugar wasn't completely Incorporated into the icing. It was a bit grainy. But I may have not beat it long enough? Not sure.  Either way I suggest using this recipe if you like an icing that's not made out of mostly sugar.

I read quite a few reviews before making and I followed the suggestion of mixing the sugar into the warm flour/milk mixture. Then chilled it in the freezer for about 1/2 hour.  I was in a hurry and forgot to cream the butter before mixing and it was turning into a nasty clumpy lumpy mess once I added the other ingredients, even after mixing for about 15 minutes. Just before I threw it away my husband suggested that I try the food processor and magic! Within about 3 minutes it turned into a beautiful fluffy icing! I took most of it out and added about a tablespoon of peanut butter into the remaining icing and whipped it some more for the filling of the cake. Chilled it all for about 15 minutes and then spread it on my cakes it turned out great! Those of you who try it and it doesn't blend, try a food processor before giving up!

Really great frosting to make if you don't have cream cheese / icing sugar. (which we didn't) Works super great to add chocolate, or peanut butter, to make other kinds of icing!

I killed it! Should have looked at reviews before making it, i didnt follow the recipe to the letter and it turned out as sweet purple liquid. It tastes really good but im out of butter so ill have to try this again later. Make sure you follow recipe to letter, there is no saving it once youve messed it up!

This recipe was amazing. I used it on a chocolate cupcake and the flavor's were great together. I was looking for a recipe like this, because in my household we don't have any powdered sugar (but we do have just plain granulated sugar.) The only con to this recipe is when you heat the milk and the flour, you will later find clumps in the frosting, so i think you should remove the flour clumps before you mix it in with the butter. I would recommend you too use this recipe.

This recipe reminded me of the italian butter cream frosting I use, except it took half the time, only a third of the butter, and it tastes and looks as good as the other recipe. 
One thing I recommend is you might want to have either a second person on hand, or mix the butter and whatnot before you boil the milk and flour. You really have to keep mixing the milk mixture before, during, and after the mix boils. And then keep mixing while it's cooling to make sure it fully cools and doesn't congeal and get lumpy.

It probably would've worked for me, but I didn't let the milk cool completely. Make sure the milk mixture is cold before adding to the creamy mixture!

I liked this recipe since I didn't have enough powdered sugar to make my usual frosting. The only thing is,  the frosting started to separate so i wound adding about half cup of powdered sugar to get the right consistency.

This is now my #1 frosting for any cake that I make with buttercream.  If you whip the flour and milk mixture till it is slightly cool it makes the mixture rich, smooth and thick. You must refrigerate it to cold.  You can make it ahead of time;  best used cold.  After refrigeration makes the addition of softened butter a perfect butter cream not too sweet.

Very light and fluffy. If it's grainy keep beating it as the sugar works into it. It's so light and not super sweet that I wish I had doubled it. Hubby liked it.

First time making frosting, first time using this recipe.  I used only 1/2 of the recipe asked and decorated 24 Easter cupcakes.  It was easy and delicious!  Not too sweet, so it is perfect for us!

This was fantastic! Very creamy and delicious! I added chocolate chips to the finished milk and flour mixture while it cooled the chips melted. I wanted chocolate icing :) I also used a hand held mixer with no problems.

I followed the direction to a T and it came out tasting like butter flavored Crisco..the texture was ok but the taste was awful! I'm really disappointed because it's a lot more time consuming then other frosting recipes and was just a waste of time and ingredients. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS RECIPE. I will never make this again..

I made this as described and it turned out perfectly. I hate an overly sweet frosting and have never  liked one with powdered sugar, this is neither of those. A light, fluffy frosting that reminds me of the whipped icing you get from store bakeries. You do have to whip it for quite awhile, but it is well worth it.

Came out perfect - light yet creamy and not too sweet. Was worried about the colour but it was pale not yellow at all. I used duo colours - original and pink; original and blue and both came out very pretty. Used it on chocolate cupcakes. I took it to a friend's place and all the guests loved it! So happy, using it again but with vanilla sponge cupcakes this time.

I thought this frosting was okay. It was the right texture, but I thought it was a bit too buttery. Maybe I should have used unsalted butter or margerine. I enjoyed eating it because I love eating, but I would have rather not used this recipe. Sorry! :(

I was impatient, and added my milk/flour mixture without letting it cool completely and my mixture separated. But it was easily  fixed by adding half a cup of melted chocolate. I also added about 1/4 cup mashed raspberries and it came out beautifully. Like a chocolate raspberry moose.

Great recipe! I was making sugar cookies and ran out of frosting and powdered sugar so I couldn't make icing or more of my regular frosting. I used softened sugar as the recipe said and was easily able to hand whip this. It tastes amazing, however, it isn't the prettiest (in my opinion) I might've needed to mix it more... well I'll definitely use this recipe again.

This is so good. Made a layer cake and had plenty to ice it with! I even accidentally ended up with leftover icing, because I wasn't generous enough while icing it! I did half whipping cream and half milk, and next time I will do all whipping cream, just to up the thickness and creaminess factors a bit. I also iced my cake right after I finished the icing, and it worked fine, but I bet if I had put it in the fridge for a few minutes, it would have been a little more firm and even more perfect for icing! Thanks for the great recipe!

I just made this frosting recipe and I also found the consistency to appear curdled and very thin. Was wondering if the sugar is supposed to be confectioner's rather than white sugar. Will have to try something else for my coconut cake.

Looked a little granular, but tasted INCREDIBLE. Just like vanilla ice cream but even smoother and more creamy.

This recipe is AWFUL. I've made it twice now first time I thought OK I can't cook apparently second time I made it with a friend who is a chef and he could even get it to work it's a runny lumpy garbage mess. It took half a bag of icing sugar to make it workable and even the it melts like frosty in a green house. And yes to all you snooty pants I ready the recipe and followed it exact. Thanks for ruining my friends engagement party I hope your happy.

This was my first time to make this and  I really LOVE this frosting! (and I'm one who scrapes frosting off cake most times) 
I followed tips from other reviews,  such as beating butter ??& sugar 4 minutes till fluffy,  then adding vanilla &  beating 2 more minutes.  Then added 1/4 of the very thick milk/flour combo (that was cooled &  chilled for 15 minutes), then slowly adding remaining milk/flour,  beating well after each addition. 
 I used 3 Tblsp  flour & half a Tblsp cornstarch (sifting them together until I whisked it into milk) .  I used Superfine sugar and there was no graininess at all. 
 If you follow the directions and don't try to rush,  it will turn out great!

It was delicious. We needed to add a little more vanilla, maybe a teaspoon, because some of the butter taste lingered. Loved it and will definitely make again!

This is the most aggravating thing. I got the milk mixture PERFECT. Somewhere between letting the milk cool and creaming the butter and sugar together, it went absolutely pear-shaped. Ended up sifting in a bunch of flour and confectioner's sugar trying to thicken it up to make it passable. Frosting shouldn't require a practice run.

Once I finished whipping this up, I had to take a taste. To my delight, it was delicious! I used vegan butter and soy milk as replacements. Yes, you need a mixer for this - but it was worth the effort. I've put it in the fridge and will mix again before putting on the vegan cupcakes. Light, fluffy and not too sweet. Just what a cupcake lover dreams about! Make and pass the love. This is worth trying. (I whisked flour and milk mixture all the way through heating until I set it aside. Let it cool for an hour. Let vegan butter come to room temperature before I started mixing. If you do this, then you will rate it 5 stars too).

This frosting was great! And quite easy as long as u follow directions! It takes about 8-10 minutes with an electric mixer to get it to the consistancy you need it to be, but worth the time! I used a few drops of almont extract and it was wonderful!!

This did not turn out for me after following all directions.  It was too runny so before I tossed it I added flour and food coloring to get the right consistency and help the color.

I'm the dummy who made nighttime cupcakes without checking to make sure I had *all* of the ingredients first. Typically I love icing with confectioners sugar. But I had none, hence my google "frosting without powdered sugar".

I followed the recipe as written- except I wasn't sure if "white" sugar meant powdered or granulated.  I went with powdered, since that's what I've used in most frosting recipes before, and since lots of reviewers had complaints about granulated sugar not setting up properly.  The texture was great, it was fluffy and easy to spread.  I think it had a pretty overpowering  butter flavor- it would be great on cinnamon rolls or sweet breads, but it's not my favorite cake frosting.

I made some modifications to this recipe, instead of milk I used baileys (because I was out of milk, the last of it was used in the cake) which gave it some nice flavour and I used brown sugar instead of white granulated sugar. I skipped the vanilla cuz I was out of it but I didn't miss it and I decided that I didn't need the flour so that was omitted as well. Kept the measurements the same and just whipped the mixture in the stand-alone mixer until the sugar particles disappeared and it got to the texture/consistency I desired which was smooth and nice! Absolutely loved my baileys irish buttercream frosting! :D

Thank you for sharing Ms. Carol; light fluffy butter plus milky sweetness, best of both worlds! I tried 1/2 the recipe and full; both came out wonderfully (using granulated sugar, 2% milk, +50% flour (3 tablespoons instead of 2) and hand-mixer). A few changes I made in steps: 1. Used microwave to make milk/flour mixture: Put milk and flour in thick small microwavable glass bowl and mix till you can't see flour (less than 30 sec). Microwave till bubbles coming out from the edge (1-2 min, depends on amount and temperature of milk) > quickly take out > smooth out with mixer > scrape down on the side very well – repeat this process but microwave shorter each time to avoid lumpiness. Once done, smooth out with mixer so it'll also help cooling down fast but still warm at this point. Scrape down inside and put aside. 2. Beat about 2/3 of sugar in room temp butter: When you finish making butter/sugar/vanilla mixture (beat at least 4 min - the bottom of the bowl becoming strangely visible, still grainy), mix the rest (1/3) of sugar in milk mixture till very smooth, shiny, and looks a little sticky. If still warmer than room temp, put in refrigerator for a few min. Beat all together for 4 min, scrape down well on the side then another 2 min with hand-mixer - completely smooth texture (not grainy at all). Refrigerated leftover can be used easily – bring it to room temp and beat into fresh batch of frosting until smooth.

I made this as frosting when I ran out of powdered sugar. 

This is quite yummy, so long as you make absolutely certain that 1. your butter is not melted! It just has to be softened to room temp and 2. your thickened milk is completely cooled. 

When I first made it, I melted the butter in the microwave, and the milk was still warm. Result was soup. I put soup in the fridge til it thickened, and whipped it. It was great. Next time, I used cool ingredients, and had no problems :)

I did not care for this recipe. At first, it was going great. No lumpy flour/milk mixture, butter and sugar creamed nicely. When I mixed the two, it looked kind of curdled, which I read was normal from other reviews, so I tried to push through. I mixed and mixed for over 20 minutes with no improvement. I didn't care for the flavor, either.

Love this recipie not too sweet. Tip to avoid those pesky lumps is stir the thickened milk periodically as it cools. And it helps the milk cool faster.

This is lovely frosting! light and creamy, i mixed it by hand and still came out perfect! i would just say made sure everything has cooled down to room temp before mixing together, and whisk continuously the flour and milk while its thickening. Also mix sugar and butter very well, as much as you can! then whip them both up its perfect. If you refrigerate it for half an hour or more it hardens and easier to pipe.

I think it tasted good but I don't know where I went wrong. Maybe I didn't let the milk mixture cool enough because when I added it and mixed it with the other ingredients it has a watery consistancy.

The texture is great, easy to work with but I found the taste a bit too buttery and not sweet enough. I'm sure that there is a better frosting recipe out there!

iused the recipe as is and it came out fine the sugar was dissolved fully after i added the paste. my butter was melted a little bit and the flour mixture was still warm after i added it which made it nice and fluffy. for this frosting i do recommend putting liquid colouring instead of gel colouring as it will look weird

I LOVE this recipe. I make experiments with every recipe I use and I solemnly warn you to NOT use coconut oil instead of butter. Its a mess and it slides off every cake. So don't melt or soften the butter either. Other than that it is a GREAT recipe.

Tried make gluten-free and vegan... results were "interesting." LOL But not inedible and definitely NOT the recipe's fault! Was snowed in and made carrot cake before I realized I didn't have confectioner's sugar. Google brought me here!

I had low expectations for the GF/V versions so I halved the recipe. I substituted the wheat flour for tapioca starch, having subbed that successfully in other recipes. I made the paste and walked my dog while it cooled, then came back to finish this insane experiment. Used pure/solid coconut oil instead of butter, which works beautifully in vegan buttercream. I think the lack of protein in the oil made it more runny than it should've been. Similarly, the tapioca did not give it quite as much structure as I think wheat flour would have. I creamed the coconut oil and plain white sugar for ages, and the sugar wasn't breaking down; I got impatient and decided to go ahead and see what kind of disaster would result from trying to finish. To my surprise, when I added the tapioca goo, the sugar started to break down. The end result was shockingly edible. DEFINITELY NOT my ideal cake icing, but not bad for a "snowmergency." The icing is kind of thin, oily, and slightly runny, but better than I expected, LOL. It'll likely firm up if I refrigerate the cake though, which I'll probably try out. What a fun experiment. I probably won't make this recipe again due to dietary constraints, but I wonder how it would've been with some protein powder...?

Okay, so this recipe was AMAZING. I ended up getting a frosting with a pudding like consistency which is real different than typical frostings and far better than store bought ones. This was a real simple and easy recipe and wasn't too sweet and tasted so real like not artificial like store bought frosting.If you're looking for a simple and different frosting that's not overly sweet and takes you home, this is it.

Amazing recipe! Couldn't see how it would work but it does. For those who found it runny or curdled, that is either down to not using enough flour or not letting it thicken enough-mine was so thick I could barely stir it! As far as it being yellow,  it just needs to be whipped for longer until it turns a pale creamy colour. I think the key is creaming the butter and sugar well before adding the batter-it comes together really quickly if you do that. Definitely worth having another go if it didn't work the first time-it's delicious!

If you follow Justme's helpful hints at the beginning of the reviews it comes out wonderfully. I even adjusted the recipe because I only have unsweetened almond milk in the fridge so I used 3/4 cup almond milk and then  finished it with 1/4 cup half and half and it still turned out delicious.

This was the best frosting I've ever had.  I'm not big on too sweet icings and this just melts in your mouth without being overly sweet and it does have the consistency of whipped cream.  Wonder if chocolate can be added somehow.  Any ideas?

I have tried to make frosting three other times and they all turned out horrible. This recipe, however, was the first time that my homemade frosting was actually good. It didn't taste better than store bought frosting, but it was still delicious. I will definitely be working on this recipe though

Made it last night. Absolutely perfect. Definitely saving as a winner, especially because I generally don't keep confectioner's sugar in the house - and with this recipe, who needs it?

The whole milk and flour thickened quickly over high heat (stirring constantly), and cooled quickly sitting on my air conditioner vent (I'm sure fridge would have equally sufficed).

I softened the butter first by sitting it (in its paper) on the hot stove that was baking the cake - this made a mess, so I plopped the butter (no paper) in the mixing bowl and microwaved for 15-20 seconds.  Creamed butter, sugar and vanilla all together using the electric hand mixer for about 6-7 mins total (kept having to stop to tend to other food preparations).  Added cold flour/milk mixture in halves, mixing for 3-4 mins each time per JustMe's direction. The extra mixing seems long, but it does make the icing lighter, fluffier, yummier.

And wow - the icing was amazingly perfect and was more than enough for the chocolate cake I'd baked in a 13x9" pan - have about 1 cup leftover; we'll see how it holds up in the fridge and can be used for something else... 

Yum! Thanks for a perfect white icing with no confectioners sugar mess, Carol!!

I literally just made this recipe. I didn't read it properly, and although the recipe is vague it still came out tasting great!. Mine came out more like a glaze, but I now know what TO do and what NOT to do. 1. Definitely make sure the butter and sugar are whipped well. It's possible you just have to moved quickly and be patient (switch hands if you must) Trust me I can beat egg yolk and sugar into a thick custard like form with a fork so beating sugar and butter into a whip is just simple, but demands a lot of patience. 2. You have to watch the milk ad flour carefully mix it well and I can make mine on medium high heat. It should be super thick and nearly hard to stir and then you still have to let it cool. Honestly I'd say give it a good 8-15 minutes. Then whip it all together.

I used this recipe for  the first time and I'd say the icing was sweet but I didn't get mine to look like Carol's frosting. My frosting still had sugar in it but it was really light and easy to spread. If my mom had a blender then this would probably would've been much nicer. The first part was interesting to make the thick mixture. Mine didn't burn thanks be to God, and it was sticky like melted marshmallows. I think what went wrong was I had sugar that could've been added to the butter and vanilla mixture but I didn't use it all and forgot I had it until after adding the milk and flour mixture which caused it to be a bit crunchy. I really wish that I'd whipped it more, which would've been a lot. More tiresome but also worth it.

No I didn't change anything! If I did I wouldn't be writing a review for this recipe! Perfect frosting first time, if not then you screwed up, not the recipe. Give yourself 2 stars. One thing that hung me up was the white sugar. I was concerned that without powdered sugar it would be grainy, but I used granulated sugar anyway, and it turned out perfect. I doubled the recipe and piped 36 cupcakes with none leftover. Thanks for the great recipe!

No need for powdered again! I tried this after I ran out of icing sugar. I mixed by hand for a smooth, silky white, and delicious icing. I do prefer a firmer glaze, and placing the frosted cakes in the fridge helped.

I thought this was great! I made sure I really took my time with each step, especially the flour and milk to get a nice smooth creamy thick base.  I actually used 1% milk and it turned out fine.  I came across this recipe because I made a cake and then realized I was out of confectioners sugar.  I may just use this instead next time, lovely!

I made this recipe today.  Great results!  You do have to mix the butter/sugar with the milk/flour for about 10 minutes on high.  Well worth the wait.  I substituted lemon zest and juice for vanilla.  Just what I was looking for with no powdered sugar in the cupboard.  Will make this again.

So easy! Nice, smooth texture. I live overseas and it is hard to get ingredients because there are shortages. This is the first time I've made icing without powdered sugar. I added cocoa powder and coffee extract to go with the cake I was making. I just added extra milk to offset the extra dryness. Don't over-cook the milk/flour or it can leave lumps. (Though after I frosted the cake and let it sit for a bit, I no longer saw lumps.) Thanks!!! (BTW, prefer the vanilla version but the chocolate went with my cake)

No tips or tricks needed - frosting was great even with fat free milk.  My only complaint is that it really wasn't enough for a two layer cake as stated, so I made a filling for the cake to make up the difference.

Looked like frosting but didn't taste much like frosting. The texture looked nice and fluffy, but it just tasted like eating whipped butter and was greasy in my mouth. Followed the instructions exactly.

I liked this, but I honestly made a lot of changes to it. After reading reviews I adjusted a few things: 1/2C butter and 1/2C cream cheese (or neufchatel) instead of 1C butter. 2/3C 2% milk with 1/3C half and half. Constant stirring while thickening milk-flour mixture, then cooled in the fridge for 30 min. Mix the milk-flour into the whipped butter mixture, half the total amount at a time, beating for several minutes each time. I added 1/3C cocoa powder to make mine a chocolate cream frosting. I also doubled the vanilla extract. This is not thick like the picture, but it is creamy, and not at all soupy as some reviewers had issues with. It stood up nicely on my cupcakes, but it should be refrigerated for best results (especially since I used cream cheese). Overall, I would use this again in a pinch, but I will not be my go-to frosting.

i made it today n it turn out really ausome , i must suggest to those who hv flour flavour in it , you have to cook milk n flour on very slow heat so that you can cook the flour n i cconstantly keep stirring n taste it until i donot taste the flour :) so cool it down completely n i infact use salted butter but still the taste is veryyy good ,btw i add i table spoon of cornflour as well but i think it will be as good with only corn flour as well bcz it just like the vanilla custard you make for some recepies. so will again try obviously n for those who taste flour keep stirring n very slow heat n cook till you dnt taste flour :) happy baking

Followed the recipe exactly, and came out great. I did have a stand mixer. Used this on cookies for Valentine's, and it worked well, although it's obviously not a normal cookie frosting.

After throwing together a box cake for a Valentine's day treat, i realized I'm out of powdered sugar! Ugh! Holy moly am I glad I did! This icing is fantastic.  (I guess I should mention I'm a pastry graduate with lots of love for frostings!) I followed this recipe to a T with the help of the first review.  I will say at first it was very grainy and I was worried, but just let her rip on the mixer and it's fluffy and perfect.  I cooled the milk mixture till cool to the touch, used all butter that I softened in the microwave (hey we all use shortcuts!) and whipped the daylights out of it.  Give it a go, it's def delish. Fluffy, sweet, melts quickly, no filmy residue in your mouth and is snow white.

I love this recipe and have a tip for people in case it's just not coming together after whipping it forever, as happened to me (my fault, I added cocoa powder to create a chocolate version).  While you're whipping it, you can add flour, a tablespoon at a time, until it comes together.  Doing this saved my batch of frosting.  It came out delicious and fluffy, and the 1/4 cup of cocoa and tsp of almond extract instead of vanilla was amazing!

SO DELICIOUS.
I absolutely hate 'American buttercream' made with icing sugar that crusts, and this was a great alternative.
I followed one commenters advice and used 1/4 cup flour, also added the sugar in with the milk & flour mixture to melt it. 
I chilled the flour/sugar/milk mixture until it was cold, then when I added it to the whipped butter, it appeared to curdle.
The mixture was too cold, which made the butter harden and form lumps. I wrapped a wet, warm towel around the stand mixer bowl which brought the mixture up to temperature, causing the butter to slightly melt into it and form an awesomely smooth icing. 
It was not overly sweet, I love it.

I love this website, you can type in ingredients that you DON'T have and find a recipe. I was out of powdered sugar and eggs, so that nixed a lot of frosting recipes for me. This frosting was great just make sure everything is cold before you whip it all together.

Loved this recipe...only gets 4 stars because I wish one batch made more. It is so light and airy with just a hint of sweet. I actually added almond extract with 1/2 a tsp of vanilla...yummo!For beginner bakers here's a hint or two: 1) cool the milk and flour completely 2) cream the butter and sugar until smooth and fluffy-this means you will have to scrape your mixer several times.

This frosting in a nutshell is...meh. I followed Justme's directions and the consistency was decent. You do need to be patient and having a kitchen aid mixer was definitely helpful. I covered a 2 layer cake and I had a hard time making it look good because the consistency wasn't working well. I can see why some people said this works better if you pipe it on cupcakes. The cake would've looked much better if I piped stars (or the like) all around it. As for taste, it's very butter-tasting. I even added some more milk and powdered sugar, but that didn't change it. I decided to use this because my family doesn't like sugary frosting and this recipe is definitely NOT super sweet.

So glad I tried this! I made my stepdaughter's cupcakes last year with swiss buttercream and she WILL NOT let me forget she doesn't like the not sweet frosting! I was hoping to find something between swiss and regular buttercream and this fit the bill. She loved it andI don't think it's cloyingly sweet. I didn't think it would be good for decorating, but it held up well. I made a few roses to test it out and they've held up well. Thanks for this recipe!

I really liked this recipe and would like to give it a 4.5 if possible, didn't give it a 5 because I had to add 3x the vanilla to make it taste less like butter and the milk/flour mixture, but that really improved the flavor.  Next time I may add less of the milk/flour mixture, because I found that although it did provide a great texture, it did impact the flavor quite a bit.  I left my butter sit for ~1hr 15min at room temp until it was easily pressed down by a fork, and let the milk/flour mixture cool almost the same amount of time, and the texture was fabulous, very creamy and melt in your mouth :)

I am making a cake from scratch for my school project and I was looking for a frosting mix that doesn't taste like vanilla. I added a pinch of cocoa to both the milk and flour and I didn't use the 'white sugar' I used regular sugar because the white sugar tasted foul. In the photo you will see my cake. The icing tasted a bit chunky but it tasted better than it looked. Just the butter and sugar tasted great.

Way too much butter!! I also didn't like the consistency and it was very sweet. I followed everything perfectly, but it just didn't taste very good.

I did not like this recipe at all. It tasted like flour with milk instead of frosting. I was really upset since it took me forever to try and blend it and it never came together at all.

I followed this exactly and it was so greasy and runny it was unusable. I tried to salvage it by adding powdered sugar but to no avail. Will definitely NOT be using this, or any variation of, this recipe again. Going to stick with a traditional buttercream.

I was very disappointed with this recipe. I expected it to be good. In reality, it tasted like a stick of butter with sugar in it. Disgusting. It definitely  was not worth all the time it took, with boiling the milk and beating forever to get the sugar crystals out. This is the first negative review I've given a recipe on this site.

This  frosting never did get thick enough to use, it just seperated and was very liquid.  I finally added alot of powdered sugar and beat it until I could finally use it.  I kept reading the recipe over thinking I forgot something but didn't.  I will not use this again.

So it looks like an average butter cream frosting. tastes a bit softer and I can't tell the sugar grains- I used icing sugar and not regular sugar. However, I added more sugar as I could taste the butter- was definitely not sweet enough. Again, not sure if its worth it.

I've never liked frosting until I found this wonderful recipe! I use it on every cake I bake and everyone LOVES it! My brother told me I have to make him a cake every week with this frosting because he's so in love with it. If you want to make this into a delicious chocolate frosting add softened chocolate chips, cocoa powder, and if I'm frosting a chocolate cake, I like to cut off the uneven top of the cake and mix it in as well (sounds weird but it is REALLY delicious) I've never used a different recipe and I don't ever plan on using any other. FIVE STARS!!

I made this frosting to frost cupcakes for a b-day party and it was FABULOUS! I am so going to stick to this recipe. One person told me that she doesn't normally like frosting, but she loved this one. The only reason I'm rating this as 4 stars (I would give it 4 1/2) is because it starts melting. Which is why I suggest to place it in the freezer for about ten minutes before frosting your cake (or cupcakes). It will harden though if you leave it in too long; if you do, just beat it with a hand mixer before using.
     If you want to make a different flavor-this recipe works! I omitted the vanilla and created my own flavors. Add peppermint, orange, lemon oils or extracts! Puree fresh fruit, even. Cocoa powder makes the most creamy and light frosting EVER-yum!!!!!
Thanks for sharing! :)

It's a little bland for my taste and really soft!  I like it better than others because it's not too sweet, but it could have a bit more flavor.  I had the issue of it having that curdled look as well and I mixed for quite a while.   I was surprised not to see confectioners sugar in the recipe... perhaps a bit of that next time will thicken it up.

This was excellent!! My very first successful attempt at a fluffy frosting. Very easy to make. Takes a bit of time but you need to be patient and let the paste come to full thickness then cool. Will come out perfectly. I used evaporated milk and it was great!

If you like a creamy, dreamy frosting that is not overly sweet, this is the recipe for you!  I followed the review recommendations written by "JustMe" that were submitted on May 30,2007.  I have made this frosting 2 times within the last couple weeks.  I used a strawberry cake mix for the first cake and then topped each serving with fresh sliced strawberries.  YUM!  Husband and kids loved it!  I used a spice cake mix for the second cake and then topped each serving with homemade candied / spiced walnuts.  I brought the second cake to a dinner at my sister and brother-in-law's house and everyone really enjoyed it.  This frosting can transform a cake mix cake into something extra special.  I highly recommend it!

Yummy in my tummy! The frosting was sweet and buttery, but delicious! But it didn't yield as much as we thought. We chilled the milk and flour in the fridge for about 25 minutes or so. That was a long enough wait until we added to the mixture. :)

Just made it for the first time.  It has a great flavor - very creamy.  I don't think that I creamed the butter and sugar enough - the sugar was not totally disolved.  I would make this again.

The only homemade frosting I've ever made was cream cheese, so I'm not very experienced at making frostings.  I wanted a simple recipe made with basic ingredients that I always have on-hand.  I don't always keep confectioner's sugar, so I tried this recipe, following recommendations by JustMe.  The result was perfect:  creamy, light and airy frosting.

I tried this recipe when I found myself without a can of frosting for a batch of school-party cupcakes.  I accidentally made this with HALF the butter because my kids were helping (read: distracting!) me.  I didn't realize it til after I was done and you know what?  I was perfectly happy with the results!  Piped it onto some cupcakes (used clear vanilla extract so as not to affect the color) and it set up nicely.  I was afraid it would have a whipped cream texture and be running all over the place by the time I got them to school for the party, but they made it without a problem.  I will have to try these with the correct amount of butter to get the full effect, but I have a feeling I will be going back to my lower-fat version!

great tasting and easy. Only 4 stars because of the thickened milk ends us lumpy easily if you're not careful. Maybe using confectioners sugar would eliminate the grittiness of the sugar.

Tastes AWESOME!  Light and fluffy, but rich and buttery!  I had texture issues, was a little grainy from the granulated sugar (also affected how well it accepted food coloring), and I accidentally let the milk mixture cook a minute too long without stirring, so it was a little lumpy... but all in all, once it was on the cupcakes, I couldn't stop eating them!! Next time, it will be 5 stars I'm sure!

My mother and I have been making this recipe for years.  It started out as a favorite on Red Velvet Cake, now I have made it for cupcakes and many other flavored cakes.  I usually use 4 tablespoons of flour to make the milk paste.  It doesn't seem to dissapoint when I make it.  The key is to beat th butter and sugar for at least 5 minutes...I usually beat for 7 minutes.  Then I add the paste 1 tablespoon at a time, beating well after each, then beating an additional 5 minutes after all of the paste has been added.  My personal favorite icing!

Have used this recipe for about 20 years now and never had it fail!  Your butter should be softened but not mushy soft. For us, 20 minutes out of the frig does it. Also make your thickener and COOL it COMPLETELY. This recipe won't fail you if you follow directions.  For a lilly white frosting, use white vanilla extract and not the brown.    This is an amazing recipe, not to sweet, just right. If you want greasy, commercial Sam's Club or Walmart frosting, this isn't for you. If you want quality icing that makes your mouth water for more, this is it.

This is absolutely my go-to icing.  So fast, easy, and delicous just FOLLOW THE RECIPE! Do not use melted shortening for the softened butter, milled polenta for the flour, and boiling water for the milk.  If this is anything less than delicious (ie: tastes like "Sam's Club" frosting, you DID IT WRONG!)

Really good but not very pretty. I had to add purple coloring because it is kind of a wheat colored frosting.

I really love this frosting, it's different from the usual confectioner sugar recipes.  It's lighter & seems healthier since it's made with 1 cup of milk.

Recipe tastes great, but does NOT thicken as advertised. We're eating our cake without icing, because this stuff is just runny.

This has to be the best tasting frosting I've ever had. I do not love super-sugary "typical" bakery frosting and was looking for something different. I followed the recipe exactly, taking cues for timing from JustMe. In all, I probably spent about 20 minutes with the handmixer (wasn't at home with my standmixer, but it wasn't too bad). The frosting was sweet enough but not cloying and so pretty and fluffy. I piped mine onto cupcakes and the frosting performed beautifully. It's not very warm or humid here yet, so I'm not sure how this will hold up in the summer months.  I made the flour mixture as a white sauce, with a whisk, stirring over low-medium heat until quite thick--until the swirls from the whisk didn't disappear right away. The cooled product was a pudding consistency. (I also cooled mine in the fridge)   I highly recommend this recipe!

I had to double the recipe to ice the cake I was making.  So that is four sticks of butter, and two cups of sugar.  Maybe it was better when I didn't know that. :-) Now all I can taste is butter and sugar!!  Really, it tastes too buttery and too sweet to me.  But I am not exactly sure how to change that, after all it is made of primarily those things.  Maybe it is psychological.  Anyway, this frosting whipped up fine the very first time.  The best part is that it spreads like A DREAM.  I had some store-bought frosting on hand for an inner layer and it was a pain to spread that tacky stuff. But this frosting was an easy glide.  I used unsalted sweet butter.  Was I supposed to use salted regular butter?  Details people...

I first tasted this recipe on cupcakes at a Baby Shower and fell in love with it.  I found the recipe on another web site and tried it and it came out perfect.  The difference between that recipe and this one is the amount of flour.  I mixed 5 Tbsp flour with 1 cup milk and whisked it over Medium heat until it got really thick and then I set it aside to cool and mixed the rest of the ingredients (Which were exactly the same) in a separate bowl.  Do not let the butter get too soft.  I was a little worried that the sugar would not blend, but after I added the cooled flour mixture and beat it for about 4- 5 minutes it came out light fluffy and smooth.  I added Almond extract along with the vanilla and it was wonderful.  Everyone loved it and I won't be making any other icing again.

I tried this recipe to frost yellow cake. I thought that it tasted ok, but I thought that the recipe was a little hard to follow. I also liquified the butter when I was suppose to soften it, so that probably made quite a difference in the ending result.

love this icing have one suggestion - my recipe came from an old friend and neighbor.  It calls for 1/2 cup of oleo not butter and 1/2 cup of crisco. Everything else is the same. Corn starch helps, cooling completely helps, last line of my recipe says the more you beat the better the icing. My recipe is called "Fluffy Wonder Icing" it always is a wonder how great it tastes.

This recipe, tasted great, I did'nt get the grainy taste, I did use an suggestion, and made the flour milk mixture while the cake was baking.  I used 1% milk with no problem, and followed the recipe.... tasted like I thought it would.  This is not a recipe for someone with time restraints.

This set up beautifully and only took about one-half hour to make (cooling time inc). I followed the tips from the first reviewer and had no clumping, no problems and my arm wasn't tired from whisking - it thickens quickly, even on low heat. And, spreading this frosting on a cake is so easy! Will use again, and maybe change the vanilla extract to lemon or something else for a different flavor.*One tip - to cool faster, transfer milk paste from the saucepan to a bowl and stir every few minutes - worked for me!

This was my first attempt at this recipe and I followed the instructions that "justme" put on here EXACTLY and it turned out great.  16 total minutes of beating.  It didn't taste right on a chocolate cake, so next time I'll use it on a yellow cake.  Overall, a great tasting, easy to spread frosting.

For the time this took and it's flavor, I cannot give it more than 2 stars.  I followed the directions, supplemented with the comments, am an accomplished cook and still got a few small balls of the flour/milk mixture in my frosting (I covered this up with sprinkles so no one would know).  I took them to a potluck (usually my things are the first to go) and only 2/24 cupcakes were eaten.  I will not make this recipe again.  It was not delicious or anything special.  I will agree with another poster that it was close to Sam's club frosting in it's consistency.  This one was not a winner.

Great taste! I did add 1/2 of a package of softened cream cheese to it at the end and it turned out great. I also found it a little greasy so I ended up adding about 1/3 c powdered sugar to make it thicker.

I loved the light, whipped texture of this frosting but found it to be really, really buttery. I don't know what I was expecting since it's mostly butter anyway. It took me forever to heat up the milk and flour mixture. It said low/med and I put it on 3 and it never thickened. After turning it to about 4 1/2 it thickened but never to the point where I couldn't whisk it anymore. I put that in the freezer to expedite the cooling and it seemed to work fine. My initial reaction to the flavor was basically whipped butter. I added more sugar and vanilla and it still tasted buttery. Overall, I still like it because it definitely complimented the confetti cupcakes I made. Very time consuming though.

Absolutely fantastic!  This is now my go-to recipe for frosting.  It is very creamy and silky, sweet but not cloyingly sweet, and rich without being overly so.  It's wonderful!  A perfect balance.

This is the absolute BEST icing I have every tasted, and the ONLY icing I use!! I have been using this recipe for years, and mother used for years before that. 
This receipe will not work unless the cooked portion is cooled completely. (It shouldn't even be warm. - must be COOL). Butter works best as margarine will make it come out runny.
I love the light taste and it is such a universal recipe - trying adding a different extract instead of vanilla. My favorites are almond or rum. 
P.S. I tried strawberry extract once...didn't work.
Good luck! This recipe takes a little time, but once you get it down, you won't go back.

This was so simple and elegant! I added a touch of unsweetened baking cocoa for my grandaughter's birthday cake. It was an absolute success and the best icing I've ever made!! I am not a baker by any stretch of the imagination, but this was the "icing on the cake" of my baking experience!

I give this 4 stars because it is a bit time consuming, but otherwise it is beautiful and yummy!  I whisked my milk mixture for awhile (~30 min)  and also whipped well the mixture each time I added a new ingredient. I also added 1/2 t. almond.

This recipe was really good! I did have some issues with the milk and flour as even though I mixed it continually it still came out lumpy and I had to strain the milk in order to get out the lumps. I also added a little extra sugar and a half teaspoon almond extract. It came out wonderfully.

This was the first time I have ever made my own frosting and it turned out really good. The recipe was easy and I got lots of compliments. I will definitely use it again.

Even though this took a little longer then some frosting recipes I still liked it.  It was a little to sweet though.  I microwaved my butter so it was extra soft.  It did have to be whipped a long time and I would highly recommend having a standing mixer for this recipe.  I halved this recipe to put on wacky cake for a small birthday cake for my husband since it is just us two.  We really enjoyed it!

This frosting has a very good texture but only after mixing it for about 20 minutes, which is very time consuming.  The flavor was very milky and I found that I had to add way more vanilla extract then it called for to try and cover up the milky taste

This frosting recipe was decent, but I am still looking for the perfect buttercream frosting recipe.  Maybe I should have whipped it more, but I thought it was not the "whipped cream" texture that the recipe claimed it would be.

This is a great frosting if you have a serious sweet tooth (which I do).  I drizzled this over the Gramma Bertha's Banana Cake recipe from this site and got a lot of great compliments (even after I substituted light margarine for the butter and used 1/2 cup sugar & 1/2 cup Splenda).  I did cook the milk/flour mixture for a little too long and it was lumpy, but I put it in the blender on "cream" which worked like a charm.  Would make again.

This is a great recipe if you are looking for a frosting that is not too sweet and has a smooth whipped texture.  (I did add 1/2 tsp almond extract.) One problem, there were very small lumps of butter and, possibly, cooked flour in the finished frosting.  Nonetheless, it got rave reviews.
