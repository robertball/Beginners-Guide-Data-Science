I use Marie’s all the time.   Great blue cheese dressing, as good if not better than most high end restaurants.  This is a great salad. Bacon just makes everything better!

The only things I did differently were to cut the dressing in half  (from 4 tbsp to 2 tbsp, which is actually one serving) and replace it with a quarter cup bleu cheese crumbles for more flavor. I haven't eaten iceberg lettuce in years because it has so little nutritional value, but I'll definitely make this again!
