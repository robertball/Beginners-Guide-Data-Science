Ah, I should note that my family makes it slightly different. We pour half of the jello and cranberry mix in an 8x8 pan and let it set in the fridge for an hour or so. Then we carefully spread a layer of light sour cream on top ( fat free is too thin and the full fat has a weird texture for me) and carefully ladle the remaining mix over the top. Then set in the fridge. It's amazing.

I made this for a luncheon following a memorial service at church. Everyone loved it and it was so easy to make. I did add a small can of drained pineapple to it but it would be just as good without. It's sweet and tart at the same time. It's one I will continue to make!

Had this at a potluck at work, and LOVED it.  I started making it without the recipe, and had made the jello following the package directions.  When I looked it up, saw that it was supposed to have less water, I went ahead and finished.  The extra did not seem to be a problem.  The only other difference was by adding walnuts.  This is delicious, thank you for posting it!

My mother made this every year for Thanksgiving and Christmas. This may seem strange to others during the holiday season... but, is the only way that my mother served cranberry sauce during the holiday season.

Did not like this. Made it exactly as written and it tasted just like fruit on the bottom yogurt. Definitely did not go well as a compliment or side dish for ham or turkey as I was hoping.

This was so easy and a huge hit. It is great as the recipe stands. At Thanksgiving everyone wanted seconds.
