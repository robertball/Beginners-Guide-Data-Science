I scaled this recipe for 12 and put it into a roaster in the oven at 325 for 2 hours and warmed it up the following day for another hour.  It did not need cornstarch for thickening as it thickened on its own. I reduced the carrots to 4C, reduced the tomato paste to 1 1/2 cans,  and increased the beef by a pound.  I added a few more potatoes and a small spoonful of brown sugar.  My family raved about it.  It was a very pretty dish and exceptional in flavor.  The beef was extremely tender.  I am sharing it with friends!

DO NOT USE GUINESS EXTRA STOUT.  I made the mistake of allowing my husband to pick up the beer and the Extra Stout makes the sauce way too bitter. I really want to try this with the regular Guinness next time.  However, to fix this I increased the amount of broth and sprinkled in about a tablespoon of sugar and in order to counteract the bitterness.  It's a very thick, hearty stew and reall pretty simple!

I made this but used a crock pot - cooked it most of the day.  Served it to a table of hungry poker players and there was barely enough left to soak a piece of bread.  good stuff.

I really like the taste of this stew.  It has a different flavor than the stews most of us are used to so this may not taste good to everyone.  For me it was nice to taste something different, especially when it tastes good.  I did take heed to other reviewers comments and added and subtracted some things to make the taste more "palatable", but nothing that would turn it into a different recipe.  It still has that "special" taste which comes from the beer.  NOTE: I doubled the recipe.  I used 9 cloves of garlic 3 large potatoes, almost 4 lbs of stew meat, 3/4 of a 2lb bag of baby carrots (cause I didn't want to cut carrots), 2 small onions, 2 12oz bottles of Guinness, as much oil and flour as needed to brown the meat, 2 6oz cans of tomato paste, 3 cups of Mushrooms and 4 cups of beef broth.  ADDED: My additions were a result of reading the reviews. I added twice the meat and more potatoes than carrots. I added sea salt and pepper to the flour that I used to brown the meat.  I have found in my limited cooking experience that seasoning meat before it is cooked is never a bad idea.  I also added a little sea salt to the stew. To bring in a familiar taste, a little thyme, a little basil and a couple of bay leaves. To curb the bitterness of the Guinness, two teaspoons of brown sugar.  SUBTRACTED: Corn starch and water as I had planned to cook it all day and others mentioned that the sauce would reduce/thicken over time.

My family and I loved this stew!!
It's thick and very filling
I didn't have a stout beer on hand- so I used a lager.It was good, but I think I'd like stout a bit more so, next time I will definitely use a Guinness and a bit of sugar. I also added rosemary, thyme, basil, sea salt and pepper. I think that the spices added just a little kick.

very good. my only complaint is I followed the recipe but it never said when to add the garlic? I ended up adding it at the end when I found it was the only ingredient left. It probably needed to be added with the onions to bring out the full flavor. I used Killians beer and did add some salt.

This was a great beef stew, I love the deep flavor the beer gives to it (I used Guinness). I'm not a big fan of tomato flavor in my stew so I left out the tomato paste. Also left out the mushrooms since I don't like them, and didn't use nearly as many carrots. Overall, this is probably my favorite beef stew recipe.

I thought this stew was way too tomato-ey.  It just tasted like bitter tomatoes.  It would've been better with just beef broth and the beer.  We threw the leftovers away

The recipe was very easy to make, but not salty enough and a little too bitter from the beer (my kids who will eat almost anything didn't like it).  I'll probably try the recipe again, but add some salt and reduce the beer a little.

My husband and I love this recipe!  The recipe is perfect the way it is, but I don't add an entire bottle of Guiness.  I start with half of a bottle and then add more as needed after the stew has had time to cook.  I've done this on the stove and in the crockpot.  The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that my potatoes and carrots seem to always be hard even though I cook it at least twice as long as the recipe calls for.  Next time I'll boil the potatoes and carrots for a bit before adding them to the stew.  We also serve it over a bit of white rice.  A yummy Irish stew!

I tried this at home but i made a few substitutes.  Not big on shrooms,  so i added a can of corn.  Also,  i made 16 servings,  i added 3 12oz Guiness beers plus a cup of red wine.  I can actually say it turn out better than ever.

Delicious. I was tempted to make it my own by adding other veggies but it truly doesn't need anything else. The gravy in this stew is outstanding.

My boyfriend and I lived this recipe. I added peas, thyme, a dash if ground cloves, 2 bay leaves, salt and pepper to taste, some worchestershire and red wine. It was awesome for a cool winter's night. Can't wait to bring it for lunch tomorrow!

I made this exactly as written using Guiness Draught.  It came out good but both my husband and I agreed that it is a little too tomatoey and it overpowered the flavor of the beer.  Next time, a little less tomato paste and more beer.  Also, I used London Broil as recommended by the meat dept.

This recipe was bland.  If you notice there isn't even a call for simple salt and pepper (which I added myself), but it still did not save the dish.  I searched the net and found a recipe that added Worcestershire sauce, bay leaves, thyme, and red wine.  Now that is what saved the stew!  This is a good base recipe, just has no flavor at all!  I'm going to be going off the other recipe I found if I want Irish Stew again...this wasn't special it was just disappointing.

extremely yummy, but I found that it needed to cook MUCH longer than the 1 hour stated on the recipe for the veggies to soften.  (and I diced them quite small actually!)

A friend and myself made this stew for St. Patties Day this year, and we had added some steak seasoning as well as half and half. The half and half made it so smooth and creamy, and yet the steak seasonings give it a good kick. I will definitely be making this again!

Hearty stew, hence the one star. However, it was horribly bland.  As you can see in the recipe, there are no spices in this, and you can really notice it in the flavor (or lack thereof...).

I was freaking out a little because I hadn't planned anything for St Patrick's Day dinner and I decided to find a recipe today. FYI, you cannot make corned beef in a few hours if your beef isn't already corned. This recipe was a life saver and my husband loved it. My son didn't like it very much but he doesn't like very many things. The only changes that I made was I only used half of the beef, 1 cup of carrots and Leinenkugel Creamy Dark instead of the Guiness because the liquor store was out of it. I know that it is German instead of Irish but it really made it taste great. I was just ready the reviews that some other people left and they said that the beer made it taste bad, this beer is dark and has body but it isn't sharp in a bad way.  I served it with a Soda Bread recipe that I found on her along with my German beer and it was great.

I was excited about all the positive reviews for this and I wanted to try something different for a 'special' dinner. I followed the recipe (but used a milder beer, per a few of the other reviewers suggestion) but it was pretty bad.  There was a very bitter aftertaste that permeated the vegetables - nothing was salvageable and we ended up doing take-out.  2 stars for creativity, ease of preparation, and spelling, though! ;)

Made this for my husband's bday dinner. He loved it and I did, too. The Guinness makes it delish! Will definitely make this again. Excellent!

This was superb. The only change I made was to add two teaspoons of sugar to counteract the bitterness of the stout and put it over mashed potatoes, because I don't care for potatoes in my stew.  I gave the other half bottle of stout to my friend after she tasted mine and gave her my printed recipe. This is in my permanent collection.

This was an excellent stew! I made a double batch since I was serving 12 (mostly hungry young boys) and I still had a good bit of leftovers. I served it with from-scratch cornbread and fruit salad. Everyone loved it. My changes: I used only one can of tomato paste (all I had), added a handfull of chopped fresh basil, a tablespoon of sugar and a can of stewed tomatoes. The cornstarch was not needed so I didn't use it. I also accidentally used Guinness Draught beer instead of the stout. Oops. It smelled marvelous while it was cooking but I didn't taste the beer as strong as I thought I would. Next time I'll make sure to use a stout. My only complaint is that it wasn't near salty enough. A salt shaker at the table fixed that. ;) Next time I'll salt and pepper the stew before simmering. Thanks for the recipe!

I would give my final stew a 5, but the recipe only a 4 because I think it would have really been lacking flavor without some of my changes. I didn't use mushrooms (don't like them) but I did add turnips. I did as someone else suggested and I did potato wedges instead of cubes - not sure it mattered at all. I used Guinness Draught and only used about 10 oz as some people said the flavor was too much - next time I'll add the whole can (mine was a tall can that was 14.9 ounces) cuz the flavor was great from the beer. I added about 1.5 tsp of thyme and 3 bay leaves and kept adding salt and pepper to my liking. I think next time I won't saute the onions with the meat cuz they basically disintigrated in the crockpot. I did cook it on high for about 5.5 hours - next time I'll turn it down to low after a couple hours or cook on low for 7-8 but the meat was perfectly tender. I also meant to add peas at the end but forgot. I will definitely make this again with my adjustments. Family all loved it.

Happy St. Patricks Day! We made this last night with awesome results, and all of the leftovers are officially gone! Per other reviewers I only used a cup of Guinness Extra Stout and a little extra beef broth to make up the rest. I did add salt and pepper to the flour to coat the meat. I boiled the meat, onions, and mushrooms for about a half hour before adding the veggies and cooked another hour. I used two carrots, and added two celery sticks along with a few handfuls of cabbage. I didn't need to use the cornstarch because it was perfectly thick enough for us. The end result was delicious! i would guess that if you didn't use the full amount of tomato paste your stew might be bitter from the Guinness Extra stout, but mine was perfect. Thanks for this recipe!

Wonderfully flavored stew.  I did take some suggestions and added an extra cup of beef broth (I used Progresso all natural), kept the beer to one bottle, and added 1 tbsp. of sugar, 1 tsp of thyme and two bay leaves.  I let it slow cook in a dutch oven for 1.5 hours.  Definitely a remake!

I followed the instructions for searing the beef and cooking the onions and garlic, however I followed up by putting it all in my crockpot to slow cook all day.  I did make a few additions:  1 heavy tablespoon sugar, 1 tsp. red pepper, 1 tsp. black pepper and 1 tsp. rosemary.  I used 2 10oz. cans of beef broth, so roughly 4 extra oz.  and a can of Guinness as my choice of 'Irish stout beer' (in our house, there is no other choice).  After 9 hours on low, this was the perfect meal to end a long day of running.  I excluded the cornstarch and water by the way... the stew was just right without it.  Due to my adjustments, I only gave the actual recipe 4 stars, but the final product was terrific!

I quite enjoyed this stew, although next time I will use more beef stock, as I felt there was not enough gravy for a good stew.  I only added 3 cups of carrots, then added 1/2 cup of garden peas and a cup of rutabaga.  Just wanted a little more vegetable variety.  Added lots of salt and pepper, to suit my families tastes, as otherwise thought it a little bland.

Loved this stew. This came out as good as I hoped for ( restaurant quality ). I did tweak the quantities a bit, but stayed pretty close to the recipe. I Will do this one again.

If you want some hearty country cookin', this is it.  I've made a few times and these are my changes after reading reviews. I added salt and pepper to to the flour that coated the beef. Cut the amount of carrots in half, otherwise, you are eating carrot stew.  I did use the Extra Stout Guinness, even though some people complained about it.  I had no issues with it (but I am a Guinness drinker).  I did add a wee bit of sugar, probably a tsp. or two.  I also doubled the broth because I found it too thick otherwise, and who wouldn't want to stretch a good thing?  Because I doubled the broth, I also doubled the cornstarch/water mix at the end for thickening.  I also added these spices:  salt, basil, rosemary & thyme.  Warning -- its kind of addictive.  POSTSCRIPT:  After I made this the last time, my boyfriend added some Hatch roasted green chiles and that was a nice addition if you are craving some spice.

This was great, but I had to make a couple of changes (had ideas from another very similar recipe) to make it more flavorful.  First, toss the beef in 3/4 tsp. pepper and 1 1/2 tsp. salt before cooking it.  Use 1 Tbl. olive oil instead of 2 tsp. vegetable oil, and add a bay leaf to the onions, garlic, and mushrooms, cook until onions are wilted (not brown), THEN add the beef and brown it.  Pour the beer over the tomato paste in a small bowl, let the foam subside, stir well, THEN add it to the beef mixture (no beef broth needed at all).  Cover and simmer for 15 minutes, THEN add potato wedges (not diced - or they get too mushy) and baby carrots.  Continue cooking for 45 minutes.  Follow the cornstarch step as written.  Perfect!  Now I have the recipe online.  Thanks for sharing yours!

This was excellent. Altho I altered it a bit. I added, small piece of Polska Kielbasa, 1/4tsp of red mole, small rutabake, thyme to taste. Also I didn't have dark beer of any kind but did have CoorsLight so used that and it still gave great flavor. No beef broth, chicken broth works just as well.

Someone noted that the recipe called for diced garlic but didn't say what to do with it. I sauteed the garlic along with the mushrooms and onion. Had lots of time to cook up the meal so started the stew 4 hrs before eating, (used Guiness draft) and only added the potatoes and carrots 1.5 hr prior to eating (so they wouldn't be over cooked). Got a lot of compliments about the stew.

We made this on a whim...my husband wanted something for the cool weather.  It was really easy to make.  I might use a little less carrots and a little more stew meat next time.  You will also want to add some salt.  Thanks!

Ok, I used Guinness Extra Stout, and this stew was great! Can't say that I followed the recipe exactly. I took other reviewers' suggestions and reduced tomato paste to 3-4 oz,omitted mushrooms, added some exttra spices (don't remember which, sorry:))). It was pleasantly thick without adding cornstratch, so didn't add. Also it took me smth about 1 h 40 min to cook until beef become tender (on the stovetop), so I added potatoes and carrots later then recipe called for (I guess stew could be a mess otherwise)... But the finel result... OMG!

Quite possibly the best beef stew I've ever made and/or eaten.  I did utilize the corned beef I had prepared and frozen a couple of weeks back and chose to throw Harp Lager in instead of a stout because really, I just can't stand Guinness or the like.  With a Harp in one and and a heavily buttered piece of bread in the other, this stuff can't be beat.  Thanks!

I thought this recipe was excellent. The beer flavor could have been a little stronger for me but it was still very good. I put everything in my crock pot on low for about 4 hours and it turned out great.

This is truly the best Irish/beef stew recipe I've ever had.  I added salt and pepper when browning the meat and some oregano later on.  I used Guinness, which added a great substance.  My husband said it was 'fantastic' and 'gorgeous'.  He's English and loves his Guinness.  Even the dog licked the plates over and over.  I never thought it was bitter at all, but found it very smooth and rich.  Instead of tomato puree, I used tomato sauce (tinturada) and rather than cornstarch (we live in Portugal) I mixed flour and water to thicken the gravy.  The result was a very rich, thick and delicious stew.  Thank you for a great recipe, which I will use again.

If you like stout beer, you'll probably love this stew.  My husband and I do not, so we weren't impressed with the stew.  However, my friend thought it was WONDERFUl (and she loves stout beer).  I may make again someday but definitely with a different type of beer.

My family really loved this recipe!  The only changes we made were the exclusion of flour (since I have celiac disease) and mushrooms (our family doesn't like them). Also, used a honey beer instead of stout. We practically licked our bowls clean!  Yum!

I made this for a big St. Patrick's day party and everyone loved it. I was a little apprehensive putting that much tomato paste in it. When I first introduced it and tasted the result, it was overpowering tomato. However, after letting it stew for a few hours the flavours blended and it was great. I'll definitely do it again.

Tried this recipe for St. Pat's dinner.  I followed recipe, except I simmered it about 1-1/2 hours so I did not have to add anything to make gravy thicker.  Although beer was a little pricey, it was worth using.  I will definitely will make it again.

This is a great fall/ winter meal.  I use a local micro brew dark beer, it makes the recipe a real novelty.  I tried it with Guiness the first time and found that it overpowered the other flavors.

This was very bitter, and my kids wouldn't touch it.  I followed the directions exactly except that I used my slow cooker.  I had to stir 3 CUPS of brown sugar into it to reduce the bitterness.   I will not make this recipe again.

By the instructions of other reviewers, I added Basil, Thyme, and a Bayleaf, and also put salt and pepper on my beef. I also added turnips and parsnips to my stew at the same time as my carrots because I love me some root vegetables.   As per my Irish father-in-law, I marinated the beef in Guinness extra stout for a little less than an hour before draining the beer and coating them in flour, and then when the recipe called for stout, I used Guinness draught. I found that it was still too Guinness-y for my family's tastes, even after the addition of brown sugar, so maybe next time I will stick to my father-in-law's method of making Guinness stew.  The stew also took probably a half hour longer to cook than the recipe stated it would. I served it with "Irish Soda Bread in a Skillet" here on Allrecipes.  After we ate, I baked the remaining stew in a low, low oven overnight, to to soften up the meat

We really enjoyed this. We traveled to Ireland 2 years ago & ate this stew in a pub. This tasted just like I remembered it. I basicly followed the recipe. I only left out the cornstarch & added thyme, seasoning salt, & bayleafs. Next time Im going to leave out the Potatoes in the stew & serve it over mashed potatoes. Thanks Kim!

I didn't have time to brown the beef so I just put it in a crock pot and tossed with flour, salt, and pepper.  I used Killians Red Beer which isn't as strong.  I added all the remaining ingredients and cooked on high for 4 hours.  It turned out really tasty and was even better the second day.

This was a disaster! I followed the recipe to the letter (except for using extra stour which I'll talk about in a moment).   The vegetables did NOT get done after an hour of simemring like the recipe said to do.Prep Time is WAY over twenty minutes unless you buy vegetables that are already prewashed and precut.  And...someone else warned on here about using Guiness Extra Stout --- I repeat the warning - DO NOT USE GUINESS EXTRA STOUT. Horrid, horrid bitter taste if you do!!!! Really awful and brown sugar did NOT help!

Really a great recipe. I searched HIGH and LOW for Stout Beer and ended up getting Guiness Extra Stout. I am SOOOO glad I DID!! It tastes amazing!!I followed the recipe exactly ( adding the garlic to the mushrooms) and I wouldn't change a thing. Well, I did add more potatoes but other than that, this recipe is a keeper. I cut my carrots, potatoes, mushrooms and garlic ahead of time and it made for an easy quick prepration of this meal. Quick tip.... Find and use Stout beer, it made it so worth while.  ENJOY!

GREAT STEW!!!  I followed the recipe EXACTLY.  The only addition was salt.  It was perfect.  Highly recommended.  I used extra stout beer and it was not too bitter at all like one of the reviews said.  The directions left out the garlic (very important) so I added it with the onions and mushrooms.  It was easy and delicious.  It will be my stew of choice from here on in.

This was an excellent creamy stew. Made it a day ahead of time and served it for St. Patrick's day with the Irresistible Irish Soda Bread, also from this site. I used Smithwick's Irish Ale for the beer and about 6 small red potatoes instead of 2 large baking potatoes. The husband had two huge bowls!

This recipe turned out perfect. I made very few changes. Used 5 potatoes and half bag of peeled baby carrots, and 8 oz of baby bella mushrooms sliced. I seasoned the meat and flour pretty well and mixed them together, browned it in my cast iron enamel dutch oven. I added a bay leaf and a few dried herbs. I used a Sam Adams Black Lager because that is what I had on hand, it was not bitter at all and added a lot to the flavor. Mine started to go a little dry because I baked it for almost 3 hours so I had to add some extra broth halfway through and turned the heat down a bit, but the gravy was very thick and rich and meat was so tender. I served this with boiled cabbage on the side and fresh baked bread, we thought it was better than any stew we have had in restaurants. I will probably use this recipe often.

I used only half a can of tomato paste and only about two cups of carrots. I also added salt and pepper. Everyone said they liked it, but it did taste a little bitter. Will make again but probably with a little less beer. Very filling and even my finicky 7 yr old ate it.

This is an excellent recipe!  I made this tonight for St. Patrick's Day and everyone loved it!  I followed the recipe exactly except I used a 12 oz. bottle of coors light and did add 2 more potatoes (we like a lot of potatoes!). It was fantastic!  The meat was tender, the veggies were perfect, the taste was awesome and it looked terrific, especially with the parsley sprinkled at the end.  My dad is Italian and my mom is Irish and they both LOVED it!!!  I am making it again next week for my sister and brother in law.  Thank you Kim for a terrific, delicious recipe! This one's a keeper.

Sweet.  This looks like what my mom makes.  Serve in bowls with a pepper grinder and tons of bread.  Drop dumplings go great with this, about half a dozen or so.

As others have stated, this is a REALLY tomato-y stew recipe.  I countered it by adding a second can  of beef broth.  I used 2 lbs. of meat, a little less carrots and a little more potatoes than called for.  Also a touch of oregano and basil.  And it definitely needs salt and and pepper.  My husband loved it and this will be our keeper stew recipe as I've been looking for a good basic one for quite some time.  Thanks!

I made this almost exactly as it is stated.  I used Killians Red because I was afraid if I used stout, it would be too bitter.  It definately needs salt.  I would start with 2 teaspoons and go from there as you're cooking.  I also added a teaspoon of basil, oregano, thyme, and two bay leaves.  Really yummy!

Great recipe! Lovely thick dark sauce. I doubled the recipe, added some parsnips (because I like them) only used one can of beer but used Guinness instead of the Stout. I then simmered for about 3 hours. It was a big hit.

great recipe! I don't know much about beer so I ended up buying Killean's Irish Red instead of a stout beer like the recipe calls for and didn't have any of the bitterness I later saw was common. I  also used corned beef and added a cut-up, small head of cabbage. It tasted wonderful and I will be making this again.

I was a little worried about the bitterness as I started sampling, but after I added the sugar and italian spices that others have mentioned and then cooked the meat for 2+ hours, it turned out great!!!!!  I added the carrots and potatoes after that because we don't like them mushy.  Used only half the carrots mentioned.  Next time will add more mushrooms?  Great stew!!!!

This was my first attempt at making an Irish stew. I used 2 bottles of Killian's Red beer (I like the beer flavor not stout/bitterness); added a "little" extra beef broth; 1 packet of raw sugar and reduced tomato paste to only 4 oz. I added 2 chopped parsnips after 45 minutes. of simmering then simmered for another 35-40 minutes. My husband was dying to try it because the smell was permeating the whole house. He LOVED it! It was really tasty and robust with flavor. *If you use a full-bodied Irish beer like Guinness, I would use only 1 bottle. I would absolutely make this again.

Made this without the beer, so I could serve it to my children. Instead I sub'ed beef broth and a beef bullion cube. Overall, an excellent stew. Next time, I will add a bay leaf or two.
My only real complaint... the directions don't tell you when to use the garlic! I assume you saute it with the onions.

This is essentially a regular stew with a bottle of Guiness tossed in to give it   the "Irish" feel. I made it for St. Patrick's Day and liked it, but my wife is not fond of thick gravies, so she described it as "pasty". I followed the recipe, but added three bay leaves. I served it with the  Irish Brown Soda Bread recipe (also a disappointment). Probably won't make either again.

This soup was very bland.  I browned the meat in bacon and added V8 juice.  After adding pea's and corn and a bit of chili powder it was much better.  I would use the beer again.

This was great.  I added some horseradish and horseradish mustard for some kick.  As well as some worchestershire sauce.  Lastly I forgot to get tomato paste, but sliced up a one tomato and added a slash of tomato juice (not V8)

This was good, but hard to thicken. Next time I might use a little less liquid. Ended up putting it on some rice.

This had a really good flavor to it.  I chose this recipe from all the other Irish stews because it could be made in 2 hours.  The meat was just as tender, and the flavors were melded even though it only cooks for an hour or so.  I used a lighter beer than a stout and added a little sugar, since I didn't think my family would like a stronger beer flavor.  But you definitely need some kind of beer in this recipe.  I also left out the potatoes, because I made this on St. Patrick's Day, and we always have green mashed potatoes on St. Patrick's Day ;)

thanks very much for this recipe. I'm a vegi but wanted to make something special for my Irish boyfriend on st. Patrick day. this recipe had basic ingredients which I had in my cupboard and didn't take 6hours to cook like many others. I halved everything so could make a vegi version for myself, unfortunately, as quorn is so dry,  it soaks up the yummy sauce. the beef turned out beautifully tho and my boyfriend was well impressed. bonus points for Me and a tasty, hearty dinner for us both :-)

NO flavor!  Like eating a can of tomato paste.  I have added so many ingredients to this stew to try to give it flavor that I've lost track of what I've added!  And it still tastes like a can of tomato paste! Reading the other reviews, I see I'm not alone.  Wish I would have read them first.  I gave it two stars for concept only. This recipe is bland, bland, bland!

I made this stew because I had a lot of veggies to use up from holiday cooking.  I just used a random dark beer I had in the house.  Also, I added celery with the carrots and potatoes.  I will echo what others said about the need to simmer longer than an hour.  At an hour, the stew was edible, but the meat was still pretty tough and the potatoes were not cooked through.  It was much better after 2 hours.  I omitted the cornstarch-it seemed thick enough to me.  All in all, I really enjoyed the flavor and heartiness of this stew, and will definitely make it again.

This dish was delicious, very hearty for a good German winter's meal! Next time I will probably cut the Guinness from 12 oz to about 6, as it overpowered some of the other flavors. I also added cracked black pepper to taste at the end. Overall, very delicious.

This was a very hearty stew.  I don't have a crock pot, but I left it simmering on the stove for about 3 hours and everything was so tender by the time we sat down to eat it.  I made the mistake of using the Guiness Extra Stout so I added about 2 Tbsp of brown sugar and it turned out fine.

I thought that the stew needed  additional liquid so I added at least 2 cups of water.Also, the recipe doesn't state when you should add the garlic-so I added 4 cloves of minced garilc after the onions and mushrooms were tender-as not to burn the garlic!  The next time I make this stew, I will make it ahead of time! It was much taster the next day at lunch! The beer taste mellowed out a lot.

Kim, I'm sure this recipe as written deserves 5 stars, but since I changed and omited some of the ingredients, I gave it 4.  First, I agree with other reviewers who say they think 'Irish Stew' is always made with lamb, so I used 1 lb lamb being as I was preparing to serve 4. I did not use any beer as I did not have any, but did increase the beef broth and when it was done, it did not need cornstarch.  Also, I think the broth, even though low sodium, had just the right flavor so that additional salt was not needed or used.  I have always made 'Beef Stew' but without any type of tomato added for that flavor.  I do intend to try your recipe with the beef just as written, as using it as a base for the Lamb Stew was so delicious we know it will be worth the try and by the way, this is very easy to prepare, which I appreciate.

Kim, Although I made some minor changes, this was the best stew I have ever made. I must admit I was a bit leery at first. Some of the things I changed are as follows:  1) After browning the beef in the pan, I added about a cup of white wine to deglaze all the goodies stuck to the pan. After loosening those bits up, I then added the onions and mushrooms.  2) I swapped the Guinness for some good ole' Texas beer. Shiner Black....Yumm  3) I added a small can of hunts diced tomato bits.  4) And I also added a small bag of "Baby" purple onions.  I did doubled the cooking time. I like to simmer things for awhile to get the flavors blended. I wasnt in a hurry. I've frozen the leftovers for when my Daughter comes to town in a couple weeks. I bet it will taste even better by then. YUM YUM  Thanks Soooo much.  Big John (Pearland, TX)

definately a good stew but I would make a few changes the next time to suite our family a little better.  I would definately listen to other reviewers and add more meat and less carrots.  It is a very yummy stew and easy to revise for your family needs.  I also put dumplings on top, that made for a special treat:)

Everyone raved about this except for the person who wasn't a big beer fan.  So I guess the flavor of the beer comes out enough that it would bother a non-beer drinker.  Otherwise, though, it was perfection!

Irish stew should be made with lamb not beef.  Any self respecting Irishman would know that.  This is an American take on an Irish favorite.  Not bad but 100% better if you use the lamb.

This had an aftertaste none cared for. Maybe was the nasty beer we used or one of the other ingredients. Would try it one more time with a better beer. Tony jazzed it up with gravy. That really improved it.

This stew is great, even cheaper cuts of beef become succulent and tender. It's a tiny bit bitter to my tastes so I serve it with sweet petit pois or sweetcorn to balance the flavours. It's my boyfriend's favourite stew!

I am a beginner chef but I made this for my family and they LOVED it! The beer really makes this recipe great, but like the others I did add about a tablespoon of brown sugar to balance out the beer, and after simmering for an hour I added a fourth cup of milk and it turned out wonderful. I only put in one carrot though, as my family is not too big on carrots. You really have to double the amount of meat though, one pound is not enough! I will make this again for sure!!

This was delicious!  The only thing I did different was add some hot sauce at the end to give it a little "kick" because we like spicy food.

Finally a beef stew recipe that my husband and I enjoy - thoroughly. Only change: I used the Miller High Life he had at home instead of buying the Irish stout. Yummmmm!

The stew had a good flavor. I added 2 cans of beef broth and left out the cornstarch because it didn't need it. It did however need a bit of salt.

Since we always have large quantities of venison on hand I used the tenderloins in this recipe.  Found it took a little more flour than called for to coat the meat cubes and that I did not need the cornstarch and water at the end.  Overall, absolutely perfect!  Made a batch of Diane's Colcannon and placed a small mound in the bottom of individual large shallow bowls, then ladled this stew around the Colcannon.  Very Irish and it made for a delicious and traditional St. Patrick's Day dinner!

Great stew!  I left out the mushrooms to save on cash and scaled down the potatoes since I paired this with Diane's Colcannon (also from this site) for the perfect Irish St. Patty's Day dinner.  Didn't even need the cornstarch; it thickened nicely on its own.  Will definitely make again -- thanks!

I didn't have Irish beer so used reg. beer, forgot the garlic, had to sub tomatoe sauce for the paste, and chicken broth for the beer.  I also added 16 oz of peas.  In spite of the changes-stew was delicious.  Would definately make again.

I'm surprised this is called Irish Stew,although I suppose "beef" in the title legitimizes it.
I come from Australia and Irish Stew was always made with lamb and potatoes; I must admit it was rather colorless, but tasty.

Liked this recipe, substituted buffalo round steak for stew meat and added a bit of sea salt and pepper. Great for a cold evening and tastes even better the next day.

Good stew! Scaled for 12 and made in the crockpot.  I also used less carrots (about half) and two bottles of Guiness.  Thought it tasted much better the next day.  Still think I prefer the red wine stew better, but loved the mushrooms-never put those in beef stew before, yum!

This stew was grea! Everyone loved it.  I used Guinness, and added some fresh kale in the last 10 min of cooking.  The kale added a nice touch for those of us who like a little bitterness.  Great with Irish soda bread.

package of stew meat from Costco (~3.5lb), seasoned the flour with s&p, browned in two batches, used abt 3 c broth, 12 oz tomato juice instead of paste, added a little brown sugar and some rosemary and bay leaf, doubled the corn starch. Next time I will not try to sauté the onion & garlic, the flour paste stuck to the bottom of the pan and burned. Will try simmering the meat for maybe 30 mins to an hour before adding the carrots etc, to make it really fall apart.

Excellent stew! I adapted it for the crockpot by browning the beef and cooking the onion, mushrooms, and garlic as directed and adding those and all the other ingredients to the crockpot. I cooked it on low all day while I was at work and it turned out beautifully!

I made this using a crockpot and letting it cook all day. The only change I made was that I used mini carrots instead of slices. My family loved it. My husband is a very picky eater and has asked me to fix it again. I have been making stew for over 50 years and this recipe is by far one of the best..

Delicious! I used a few more potatoes than called for, and substituted venison meat for beef.  I used Guinness as my stout.  This turned out to be wonderful, and I will definitely be making it again!

I was excited to try this recipe.  I was careful to make it according to the recipe (as I always try to do the first time I try a new recipe).  I'm sad to say that this recipe is the WORST recipe I have ever tried. It was bland to the point of being tasteless. By the time my husband and I doctored it, the stew was edible.  I added more beef stock, seasoned salt, pepper, Worcestershire sauce, paprika, lemon juice, and a sprinkle of cayenne pepper.  I ended up cooking the stew once I had added the potatoes and carrots for several hours and still they did no get done.  Would I ever make this again.  NEVER!

Omitted mushrooms (allergy) but otherwise followed directions.  Husband thought it was tasty, however the beef could have been more tender.  Think this would work well, maybe even better, in a slow cooker and next time I make it I'll try it in my slow cooker.  Also there is a discrepancy between the on-line recipe and the one in the February/March 2019 magazine (p. 38).  On-line says 1 (6oz.) can tomato paste; magazine says 2Tbsps.  I suspect 2Tbsps. would be sufficient and more might result in the "too tomato-ey" of one of the reviews.

Did make a few changes, had a sirloin tip roast that didn't turn out too well so it didn't need to be browned & started out with the onions and garlic.  Kept carrots the same but 4 x the potatoes.  After reading reviews, left out the tomato paste, but did add rosemary and thyme.  Simmered in a cast iron  dutch oven on the stove top for 5 hours before adding corn starch.  Next time, I'll use stew beef and brown it.

After tasting several Irish stews all around the Emerald Isle, I searched for a recipe to replicate my favorite version, and this it! Everyone gave it rave reviews, even the 5 year old.  Three things to do: make it a day ahead, use Guinness, add thyme, a little paprika, celery salt and Worcestershire sauce.  I also served it with a big dollop of mashed potatoes right on top and a sprinkle of fresh parsley.

Followed the recipe ingredients mostly as written but added in a few dashes of Italian seasoning, added in some celery and green pepper I had on hand, used a can of diced tomatoes instead of paste and served over mashed potatoes.  Very good the first and second day but not my favorite recipe for beef stew.

The nicest I can say about this stew is that it is edible and makes a lot!  We just didn't like the sweetness of the tomato mixed with the savorynesss of the meat and beer.  I tried to jazz it up a bit with thyme, ground black pepper and cayenne, but it just was not what I was hoping for.  I think I will stick with the Irish Stew recipe I found a few years ago

Not bad, not bad at all. This stew has a good flavor to it, the only thing I added was a few bay leaves. It all got eaten, so I'd say it was a sucess.

This stew is a little on the sweet side. It might have been the beer we used but I didnt care for the tang the stew had. Definatly needs all the mushrooms, maybe that would help mellow out the bitter after taste.
