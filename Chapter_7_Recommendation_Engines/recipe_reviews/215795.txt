Excellent, particularly the sauce.  I easily could see adding chicken or shrimp and serving over rice or noodles for an entree (double the sauce).  The sauce is fantastic and would complement so many things that it makes my head spin.  I had beautiful, fresh heads of baby bok choy, and they were overcooked at two minutes.  When I realized they were overdone, I plunged them into a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking, but next time I will check at 30 seconds.  I'll probably steam them the next time instead of cooking in a pot of boiling water eliminating the water draining out of the bok choy.  Didn't add salt or oil to the water, and I used cornstarch to thicken the sauce.  I think the  presentation should be the whole bok choy with mushroom sauce on top, but I just sliced mine into large pieces this time around.  If you like Asian food, give this recipe a try because it's a winner.

Very good. Goes well with meat. I didn't have potato starch; I used corn starch. I used rehydrated dried, sliced, Portobello shroom's. Have everything prepared and ready to go; there is no time to follow this recipe in 1, 2, 3 fashion without preparation.

Even better with fresh shiitake mushrooms!! And add a splash of sesame oil to the oyster sauce mixture. Baby bok choy really only needs 30-90 seconds minutes in the boiling water or else it gets chewy and limp.

Delicious, but it’s not the bok choy.  It’s not the mushrooms.  It’s the unique and richly flavored sauce along with the bok choy and mushrooms.  This requires a couple of extra steps but you are rewarded for the effort. The flavor just can’t be beat.   I don’t use potato starch, but cornstarch worked just fine.  I served this with “Beef Yakitori” and “Garlic Fried Rice”, both recipes also from this site.

This was phenomenol! I cut the oil in half to make it healthier, and I only boiled the white part of the bok choy. I added the green leafy part to the mushrooms and sautéed them the last 1-2 minutes. I also added shrimp for a complete meal. All 6 of my kids gobbled it up, and they hate veggies!

I made this for dinner last night and added two sliced chicken breasts and was VERY pleased with the results.  I doubled the sauce as well and think there wouldn't have been enough without doing so.  This is a great base recipe and next time we will try added red pepper flakes or hot sauce, asapargus and perhaps sliced steak instead of chicken.  Surprisingly, my meat and potatoes boyfriend LOVED this even without the chicken.  Also, only boil the bok choy for no more than 90 seconds.  VERY TASTY!

Mmmm...this was great, but a bit salty.  I will not sprinkle salt on the mushrooms next time.

Wow!! This is excellent!  I used cornstarch instead of potato starch since its what I had on hand. I also used 3 large cloves of minced garlic because we love it.  Made no other changes.....healthy and so flavorful. Sprinkled mine with hot pepper flakes for a kick. Wonderful recipe!

I have never seen potato starch so I used corn starch instead. I doubled the sauce but only because I added shrimp to the mix to make it a more hearty meal. We do not have baby bok choy in my neck of the woods so I used regular but I can only imagine how much better this would have been with it. Wonderful recipe and one I will make often. Thank you!

Made this for me and my husband.  We loved it.  Did not have potato starch so I used something called arrowroot, according to the bottle its actually an asian thickening spice.  Found it in the spice isle at my local Winco.  Turned out great and was nice and thick.  Not too salty as I did not put very much in the water or the mushrooms.

Nice.i used button mushrooms coz thats what I had handy. I also cut the bok choy into small chunks, coz the recipe didn't state anything with the bokchoy.came out fine. I think chopping it into pieces is anyways much better than whole.

I used baby bella mushrooms and my Chinese mother-in-law raved about it!  I steamed the bok choy in the microwave.  For the sauce,  I used cornstarch instead of potato starch, as many other reviewers reported doing.

Yummy. I steamed the bok choy which kept it crisp.  Be careful of the salt though, the soya sauce is probably enough.

This was easy and very tasty. The mushroom sauce was a little too strong for me... Might  try with crimini mushrooms next time to tone down the flavor a little bit. And the bok Choy was well done after one minute.

Really liked this - I didn't add extra start and didn't have potato starch so I used about 1/2 tsp of flour. Super good served with rice noodle.

I only had fish sauce on hands, so I used that instead of oyster sauce and added a teaspoon of sugar. Next time, I'll go get some oyster sauce. Also, as some other reviewers said, no need to salt the mushrooms! The flavor of the sauce is fine to stand on its own. It would have been oversalted but the baby bok choy helped balance out the flavor. This came out rather good.

This was super easy, and delicious!! I didn't add any extra salt, and I added some ginger. I used half cremini and half portobello mushrooms. And, of course, cornstarch ;). It was really, REALLY good! I'll definitely be using this as a staple in my household.

This was very good even without the oyster sauce (I just added a little extra reduced sodium soy sauce).  I have also made this with shiitake mushrooms.

Fantastic recipe!  I used corn starch instead of potato starch and used sliced button mushrooms instead of portobellos.

Great dish.  I could not find baby bok choy so I had to use the regular. I boiled it for 3-4 min then cut it in 1" pieces and added to mushroom mixture at the very end.  Will def make this dish again.

Excellent as written. I would recommend cutting the mushrooms into thicker rather than thinner pieces so they don't fall apart in the stir fry. The sauce is good as is. I did add some whole chili pods as well as some chili flakes to the stir fry at the beginning with the garlic and onion for a little zip. 

The bok Choy cooks in about 4 minutes if you leave them whole and intact in a bunch. Great presentation.

Made these for the first time.  Only modifications that I made was to use shiitake mushrooms (because I had them on hand) and white balsamic vinegar (same reason).  Everything came out perfect.  My non-veggie eating son was visiting and tried it.  He liked it so much that he took the entire dish back to his apartment. So I guess I should be happy he has at least some vegetables, but now I have to make it again....for me!! LOL.

Very Nice Recipe! I made it for two separate dishes as I eat chicken & my husband loves his beef ... & Yes you must be very quick! I had my meat sizzliing by the time I was ready to have the baby boc choy put into the steamer, and 2 minutes in there was almost too much (no one likes it when the greens get slimy!) Put the ingredients with the meat, add the bok choy & sauce, simmer 1 minute & serve....

This was amazing.  I doubled the sauce recipe based on other reviews.  Also used cornstarch and steamed the bok choy.  I also added shrimp in the last 5 minutes of cooking.  The shrimp added some water to the dish that I didn't allow for in the sauce.  I'll just add more cornstarch next time.

Sauce was fantastic.  only had one baby bok choy so I matchbox 1/2boneless chicken breast in salt and garlic granules brine. added 1/2 cupcarrots finely diced and sauteed with the mushroomsand chicken.  When the bok choy was done, I removed from the water and splashed with a reisling(only white i had) then in water I boiled some shell pasta.In the final step I added the bok choy and the pasta.  also cut back on the mushrooms. If I hadn'had thirds would of been enough for 3.  Okay so I'm not a vegan.

I cut the baby bok choy into thirds, steaming the bottom third and stir frying the top portion.  I used low sodium soy sauce which helped a bit to keep the dish from being too salty.  I added 3 sliced chicken breasts, which, with the addition of rice, made it a great meal.

I probably did something wrong, but this was WAY too salty!  I didn't add the salt to the mushrooms because I know how salty oyster and soy sauces are.  i wish I knew how to reduce the sodium but maintain the thickness of the sauce.

This was excellent!  I didn't have green onions, so I used half a yellow onion.  Instead of oyster sauce, I used the same amount of fish sauce (anchovy based).

This was a nice enjoyable side dish, healthy too. I used cornstarch instead of potato as I did not have that. We had fresh cod with this and rye bread and it complemented very well. Bok Choy is hard to find in the Midwest but I found it and glad I did.

Added a bit of ground ginger along with the minced garlic.  This is now my favorite veggie stir fry recipe.  It's nice and subtle so it doesn't overpower whatever you're pairing it with (ginger beef in my case).

Very nice flavour-authentic tasting. I didn't have oyster sauce but subsituted 2T fish sauce and put in extra soy sauce. Can't wait to try with Oyster sauce. Only boiled the Bok Choy for 60 seconds and was purfect and didn't add the extra salt. I am going to add beef or chicken to this next time for a one dish meal.

I substituted King Trumpet mushrooms, and they were fabulous.

I've been making my own version of this that have never compared to this recipe that I tasted in China. My biggest mistake was sauteing the bok choy instead of boiling it. This was perfect!

This was excellent! I followed the exact recipe and although I wondered if there would be enough sauce, the amount was perfect. The only thing I would change next time is to decrease the cooking time on the bok choy. It needs more of a blanch than a boil.

Great and simple way to use some leftover baby bok choy and baby bella mushrooms I had that were starting to spoil in the fridge. The sauce is tangy, sweet, and savory, and you can maybe fool yourself into thinking this side dish is healthy for you.

I used regular bok choy. I read the other reviews about it being too salty, so I didn't add any extra salt and used low sodium soy sauce. The only other big difference I made was this: I cooked the stems in boiling water and set aside. Then I added the leafy parts and cooked stems in about half way through the mushroom saute. I would make this again.

Excellent but too salty (and I didn't salt the mushrooms or bok choy). Will play around with proportions on soy/oyster sauce/water to reduce salt, but it's definitely worth making again with tweaks (it was also a little too sweet for me).  

I didn't have enough baby bok choy so I made up the volume with onion, a little red pepper, some very mild-flavored baked tofu, and mung bean sprouts. I lightly steamed the other veggies and did use the mushroom mixture as a sauce on top of steamed veggies, tofu and brown rice.  I also decreased the oil, though I added a bit of sesame oil to the sauce.  I highly recommend a steamed mix of veggies, though it meant I chopped the bok choy instead of serving it whole - a less pretty presentation but a delicious dish!

We loved this recipe!  We're going on a vacation, so I cleaned out the fridge.  In addition to mushrooms and bok choy I added a small zuchinni, then celery and red bell pepper at the end.  The celery was especially nice 'cause it added some crunch.  I covered about 6 baby bok choy and zapped for 3 minutes.  They were perfect.  My honey wanted some heat, so he added his own.  I will make this again soon!

Wow!  Simple and delicious.  We had some porcini mushrooms on hand, so I used those and it turned out wonderfully.

This is a great recipe -- many thanks for sharing it.  I followed other reviewers' suggestions about not adding extra salt -- and that tip was appreciated.  Though I otherwise intended to make it as the recipe directed, I discovered at the last minute that I had not gotten home from the grocery store with the mushrooms I was sure I had put in my cart.  Instead, I substituted lightly blanched fresh asparagus, cut into 1" lengths -- and that turned out to be a great variation.  To me, this is the mark of a really good recipe -- the  basic ingredients and techniques serve as a springboard for variation.  Next time, I'll be sure to try this with mushrooms, but even the "Plan B" result was so good, I wanted to say thank you to the reader who shared this recipe with us.

Awesome! I fried the white part of the bok choy with onions and mushrooms and an orange pepper instead of boiling and it turned out great! I doubled the sauce and added a bag of steamed noodles (cooked) and it was SO good! Definitely a keeper!

This was very easy and tastes wonderful! I used left over bok choy and mushrooms from another dish I had made the day before. It is wonderful making something other than the standard vegetables. The mushroom sauce is beautiful and I had better luck with the bok choy this time around...not slightly over-cooked...lol! I did not add the salt to the boiling water because the soy sauce and oyster sauce are salty enough to me. Definitely going to make this again!

This turned out great! I tweaked it a bit (added baked tofu, and used General Tsao's sauce instead of Oyster). I also added a splash of sesame oil to the sauce since another reviewer recommended it. The sauce was awesome! I'll be making it again for sure.

As recommended by others, I reduced cook time for bok choy to 90 seconds to retain some firmness. Transferred sauce and stirred to coat. Very tasty.

Outstanding!  My bok choy was a bit bitter, I bet brocolli would be a good substitute, I was easy on the salt per other reviewers who said it was too salty.  So good, my whole family enjoyed it.

As others said, boiling the bok choy  takes less than a minute. Did not add salt to the mushrooms. Used Golden Dragon oyster sauce and found the sauce too salty. Added more chicken stock and another tsp of sugar.

I didn't exactly make this as written.  I am rating it a 5 because I used it as a base.  What I did different was I used Hoisin  sauce since I didn't have Oyster sauce.  I added a little bit of fresh ginger to it.  I also added a yellow bell pepper.  I was originally fixin' to boil the bok choy as stated in the recipe however, I decided to slice it and make this into a stir-fry.
Thank you so much for the recipe.

Absolutely delicious! Per recommendations I only boiled the bok choy 30-60 seconds, used cornstarch vs potato, and added red bell peppers, peanuts, and chicken and served over a bed or brown rice.

I loved this.  I served it with crispy sesame tofu and rice, and it felt like we were eating at a Chinese restaurant!  As others have mentioned, the sauce was fantastic.  I don't usually like to make changes to a recipe the first time that I make it, but I didn't have all the ingredients on hand, so I did make some alterations, as follows:  didn't have oyster sauce, so subbed green onion teriyaki sauce, and cut the brown sugar to one teaspoon.  I used low-sodium soy sauce, and omitted the salt.  I used corn starch instead of potato starch (since I don't know what potato starch is).  

Other than those things, I pretty much followed the recipe exactly, including serving the baby bok choy whole with the mushroom sauce poured over the top.  I had some shitakes as well as cremini, so added them to the mushroom sauce.  It was a wonderful presentation.  

In the future I would try to find the smallest possible bunches of baby bok choy, because I felt the smaller bunches absorbed the flavor of the sauce better.  This is a great recipe that I will certainly make again!

Excellent recipe.  I have an abundance of eggplant so I added some.  I also cut the sugar in half.  My husband and I really enjoyed this and will be making again tonight.

I doubled the sauce, as having enough sauce is important - yum! I didn't have oyster sauce, so I substituted fish sauce.  I used corn starch instead of potato starch.
I saw the recipe for Chinese Almond Chicken Stir Fry and fried some whole almonds in butter, which I added as a topping to the final dish. I sliced chicken breast, which I fried with a little salt and pepper, then added about 1/2 cup leftover vegetable stock and let simmer. 
I added this chicken and juices to the mushroom mixture before serving over jasmine rice with the almonds. I took the advice of other reviewers and did not salt the mushrooms. I also used low sodium soy sauce. The sauce is highly flavored as is.

This was amazing!  We doubled the sauce, used more baby bok choy (it came in a large package), added shrimp, ginger, snow peas, and served over rice noodles.  The extra additions were to stretch it out a bit and add protein.

This recipe is versatile but always delicious! Even my skeptical parents loved it (after asking what they were eating)! I often use shallots or red onion instead of green onion, and add a little ginger to the oyster sauce mixture.
