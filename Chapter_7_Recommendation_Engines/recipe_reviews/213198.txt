Oh my goodness! I was so glad to find this recipe! I was born and raised in Pittburgh,PA and this was my favorite childhood recipe that my Mom made for lunch. She died a few yers ago and I never knew how to make them.  Now if I could tell the people at the deli counter how to "chip" the ham I'll be in business. Must be an east coast thing a I'm in CA. now and no one knows what "chipped ham" is!  Thank you so much for this great recipe!
