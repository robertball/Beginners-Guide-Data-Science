10.9.16   Mixed in some toasted pine nuts to add an additional texture to this dip.  The cream cheese is sweetened when the pomegranate seeds burst in your mouth.  Served with sea salt and olive oil flatbread crisps.  Thanks for sharing, this is indeed an easy appetizer to get out on the table quickly.

Delicious! Liked the idea one reviewer had of macadamia nuts, so I also added in some about 1/3 c of chopped macadamia nuts. The burst of flavor from the pomegranate seeds is delicious. I had to remind myself, that I can't just eat a plate of cream cheese on butter crackers.

I recently bought something similar but the pomegranate was dried and it had roasted macadamia nuts chopped into it. Served it on some really thin rosemary crackers and it was fabulous. I'm going to try to make it to save money because this is one of my new favorite snacks with my Merlot.

I was surprised at how good this tasted! My guest were apprehensive and I think hesitant to try this. It makes a lot, next time, I would cut the recipe in half. Serving this with flavored crackers is key to enhancing the dips natural sweetness from the pomegranates. Who would have thought 2 ingredients to a delicious Christmas festive dip? Thank you!
