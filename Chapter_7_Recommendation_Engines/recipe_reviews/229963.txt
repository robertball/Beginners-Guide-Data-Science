Excellent recipe! I am glad that I grew buttercup squash this year. It means that we can have this again. The flavors are very good as in the recipe. I think if I were to make any changes they would be to salt the squash before stuffing, and to add a bit of sage to the stuffing as well as to replace the stock with white wine (pinot grigio or sauvignon blanc). Seriously, it is great the way it is. My wife is looking forward to the next time I make this.

Made as written. I used a blender to chop dates and bacon together.

Wonderful flavors!  I used butternut squash which is impossible to stuff per recipe, so I peeled and cubed it and added it to the skillet with the cooked bacon.  I increased the chicken broth to 3/4 cup, put a lid on the skillet and cooked it for 40 minutes.  I had leftover rotisserie chicken which I tore into pieces and added, turning the oven to warm until heated through.  Great one pot meal.  My hubby loved it.  Will definitely make this again.

Excellent recipe!  butternut squash... acorn squash...  doesn't matter.  I would add some rice to it though, or potato.  But, nice flavor!
