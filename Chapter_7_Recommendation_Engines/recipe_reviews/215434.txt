The relish taste in this dish was really strong.  Better half loved it, wee one and I not so much!

Sounded like a great idea for a recipe but I wasn't really impressed. Made it as directions stated minus relish cause I didn't have any... I felt there was something missing but I can't put my finger on it. I did give 3 stars because it does have potential to be better and also because the crescent rolls are such a great tasting food. 
I would attempt to try again but with modifications for the meat filling.

I made this for my friends at college, and they LOVED it! I took the advice of the person who reviewed this before me about the dill relish and I'm so glad that I did. Super easy and tasty. It really does only take 30min.

This was just okay.  Hubby liked it more than I did.  I followed the advice of others and added some onion to the meat and decreased the amount of relish.  I give it 4 stars for ease.  I may make it again when I can't find anything else, but it probably won't be very frequently.

We added onion, garlic and some cooked jalapenos and made them into empanadas with the crescents. Put a little egg wash and baked. They were excellent!

very good. I put the crescent rolls on the bottom like a pie crust. I also added 1tsp. mustard, and 1 tbs. bacon bits. I left out the relish because we don't care for pickles. Then I topped it with about 1 oz. bbq chips. Very good, my family enjoyed it.

sorry but imo it would be just as quick to make cheeseburgers and they would taste so much better than this. I like ketchup but this  tasted very ketchupy and I did not care for the texture.

Pretty good, hubby really liked it....I will be making it again.  I added onion into the meat when I cooked it and also only had sweet relish on hand, so I used that.  It was tasty, and easy to whip up on a Monday night!

What a fun recipe for kids and adults!! My family just loves this. I've made it three times already :) I only made a few changes, I added 2 tbs of yellow mustard, 1/2 of an onion. I didn't add as much ketchup and relish bc they took over the dish (if you love ketchup and relish then I would keep it the same) so I did 3 tbs of ketchop and 3 tbs of dill relish. My family asks me to make this every week

It was pretty good. Nothing too spectacular, but different. I did use less ketchup and less relish, but it still seemed like a bit too much. I also added onion and extra cheese. My two year old wasn't a fan. It just seems like it was missing something...

I made a bottom crust and baked it off for about 7 min. I substituted some yellow mustard for ketchup so it wasn't too sweet and chopped pickles instead of relish. I'm not a fan of relish. My family went nuts! I've made it three times and make at least 2 at a time. It's always gone. Lol
