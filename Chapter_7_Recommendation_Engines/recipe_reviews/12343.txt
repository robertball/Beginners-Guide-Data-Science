I am french canadian and meat pie has been a family tradition for years, made by my Memere's, but is a long lost art as we have americanized our traditions. I made it this thanksgiving with the help of my Aunt and she says leave out the cinnamon but use more allspice in it's place, do not add water, and add the potato after you cook the meat, little by little until you feel it is perfect for you. I did 2 pies, one this one way and one her way, and she was right. But both were very tasty and did not last the night. Will definetly be making again for Christmas Eve. Thanks!

UPDATE: TO THE REVIEW WHO'S PIE HAD CHUNKS OF POTATO, SAVE ONE POTATO FOR DICIING BUT USE THE REMAINING POTATOES FOR MASHING INTO THE MEAT. THE POTATOS IS THE TRICK FOR KEEPING THE MEAT FROM BEING CRUMBLY..UPDATE #2, USE HALF PORK, HALF GROUND BEEF. YUMMY!

This is an excellent tourtiere recipe.  I have been making tourtieres for 46 years and this is great.  I have always added some garlic and I don't think the egg and paprika are necessary because the fat in the pork makes the crust brown.  I make these pies in batches of 3 or more.  Wrap well and freeze.  When needed unwrap and bake unfrozen at 400 F for 30 minutes.  My mistake I reheat it from the frozen state ---so it is very handy for a quick meal.

I cooked the potato in the microwave to save time. I also used Pillsbury pie crusts. I cooked the pork, then added the other ingredients until well mixed. I didn't simmer it for 1 hour and it turned out great. I would make this again. My husband and 12 year old son loved it. Great flavor.

Fantastic!  Tasted like someting right out of the 18th century Scottish Highlands! I made this last night, taking into consideration some of the suggestions from other reviewers.  I made a few modifications.  I used 1 pound of ground pork and 1 pound of very lean ground beef and did not drain it.  I used instant spuds (Idahoan) instead of a baking potato but making them a coarser consistancy like the inside of a baked potato and I used some of the meat "juices" in place of the margarine in the spud recipe.  I used a medium onion and one whole shallot minced.  I used half the amount of cinnamon but doubled the allspice. I reduced the 1/2 cup of water to a 1/4 cup water and added 1/4 cup red wine to it.  Finally I used refridgerated pie crusts.  I made the instant spuds and added them to the simmering meat mixture during the last 10 minutes of simmering.  This thickened it up nicely.  While it was baking I had 5 hungry guys from 48 to 16 years old asking when it would be ready.  They polished off the entire thing but not before I got my piece out of it.  This pie made the most delicious crust I've ever had.  Next time I'm making two pies.  The flavor was just amazing and one son thought it tasted like something we would have for Christmas, so I'll keep that in mind. This recipe is a keeper!!!!

This recipe is the exact traditionnal French Canadian tourtière that I've grown up to eat Christmas after Christmas.  My grandmother's tourtière tasted exactly like this, except that she never used potatoes, starch or bread crumbs in her tourtière(which she found diminished the taste of the meat and the spices).  She simply wasn't puting much of the broth in the pie to begin with.  The result was a very tasty tourtière that wasn't runny at all.  As for the suggestion of adding other spices and herbs, such as ginger and savoury, well that would perhaps create a different meat pie with a different taste, but that certainly would not be a traditionnal French Canadian Tourtière anymore.

This is the best recipe for tourtiere that I have encountered. It brings back memories of the post Midnight Mass meal and Christmas morning breakfast that my momma would create. (Try a thin slice of tourtiere with 2 eggs of your choice. Delicious.) My only problem is the use of cinnamon. In my mind this spice should be reserved for moles or desserts. A suggestion: Use cooked potatoes cubed 1/4 inch (rather than mash) and saute with the onion and pork until all ingredients are well browned.(This is my own twist). It provides a much nicer texture and flavor. Save and use the fat in the recipe sparingly (that is where the flavor is and the final product won't feel dried out). I give you 4 because of your use of cinnamon, otherwise it wiiuld be 5.

Perfect!!  I too used 1/2 pork & 1/2 hamburg.  Hubby said it tasted just like the pies his grandmother used make. (He even called his mother to tell her!)  Thanks for the post!!

I love making this!  My Aunt makes it every year for our traditional Christmas meal.  I can't imagine Christmas any other way.  I'll also make the meat filling as another form of stuffing for Thanksgiving.
We usually make the recipe with half pork and half beef.  And I know this sounds crazy, but if you don't want to make the potatos, to save time, I use instant to get the consistancy that I need for the filling.  No one ever knows the difference.

Very good recipe, it would have been nice to know that it can be served hot or cold.  As a child we always had it hot before midnight mass Christmas Eve, and cold with cheese and fruit in the morning while we opened selected gifts while parents slept in.  I added 1 cup of Pinot Noir red wine to the simmering stage and it all turned out delicious.  I remember there being grated morrel mushrooms so I added those too.  Merry to all.  Emer Dubois

I love this recipe! I have grown up on meat pie during Christmas (baked 2 different ways by each of my Memere's) but this is one of the closest recipes I've had to either of them. I do have a couple of recommendations to people who are doing this for the first time. Peal /boil/mash your potato separately and keep to the side. Also, sauteing the onion a little bit before you add the meat helps. I only use about 1/4C of water and it is usually more than enough. Once the water has boiled off, I add the potato and the spices (I use only 1/2tsp cinnamon and 1/2tsp Clove).   Like others, I leave out the egg and paprika, but that is because that's how my grandmothers did it.   Merry Christmas!

I really liked this tourtiere recipe.  I made a double batch and used 1/2 pork, 1/2 veal (just because I had some to get rid of).  I also used chicken broth instead of water, and omitted the egg wash and paprika (I don't care for paprika).  I will make this again but I will increase the cloves a bit.  I too thought that the cinnamon dominated, but shouldn't have.  Still tasty, and my 3 year old ate some!  Next time I will also try to brown the meat first so that I can drain away some of the fat.  The calorie count is atrocious for this recipe, but it is good!

This had fantastic flavor.  I made individual pies for Halloween since I was Mrs. Lovette and my husband was Sweeney Todd.  I used a glass to cut the pie crust into the right size for muffin tins and put dough in the tins, put in the meat, and then topped with another piece of dough.

This was a HIT with my family! From reading the other suggestions I did use half pork and half ground chuck. I left out the cloves as I know my family, especially my picky kids, wouldn't care for that taste. I did use the all spice which did give it a nice flavor. I cut up about 2 or 3 nice sized potatoes into cubes and added it to the meat mixture per my husband's request. He wasn't keen on the mashed potatoe idea. I also added Lawry's seasoning salt and garlic powder to the meat mixture for added flavor and seasoning and I used chicken broth instead of water and added a little more than the recipe suggested so I wouldn't have a dry pie. As a last minute idea I added a few dallops of sour cream to the meat mixture for a creamier texture. The family didn't notice it but I thought it was a nice touch!  I will make this pie again! It's perfect for our cold winters and it's  a nice all in one meal. I think I may add a little shredded carrots the next time too.

I felt my memere looking down on me while I attempted to solo making Tourtiere on my own for the first time.  I followed this recipe and it turned out awesome!  A huge hit with my northern California holiday guests!!  I omitted the cloves under duress of my significant other...but wish I had included the cloves.  I went light with the cinnamon but a bit generous with the allspice so the pies had that soulful twang.  I went with half ground beef, half ground pork...just like Memere used to do!  Totally yummy!!

I wasn't sure what to expect. The flavor was a bit unusual, but my husband and I loved it. I froze it - nice to have on hand. I will definitely make this again.

Just yesterday I made 4 meat pies.  Today this recipe shows up on Pinterest! I'm having company for supper tonight and am serving meat pie with a salad, cranberries, jello and strawberry shortcake.  These people have never had it,  so should be fun to see what they think.  I am French Canadian and the recipe I use I got from making these pies with my grandmother many years ago.Similar but we use 1/2 beef and 1/2 pork.  I cook the meat, drain it good and then add the chopped onion, then water, spices are different.  We use a heavy dose of sage, a little garlic, salt, fresh ground black pepper and some minced onion bits.  I simmer all of this, then start adding the instant potatoes to thicken to the right consistency.
I also sneak in a few dashes of cayenne pepper for my Scott Irish husband. Just to give it a slight kick.  I am wondering why we use sage and others are using cinnamon and allspice.  There is supposed to be a spice jar sold in Canada that has a mixture of these spices for the pie.  Does anyone know what this is called?  I also whip up an egg and 'frost' my pies with that and they are a very nice brown when they come out of the oven.  I will try some cinnamon and allspice next time instead of sage, just for fun.

My husband is French-Canadian and LOVES French Meat Pie. I lost my recipe when we were building our home and I couldn't quite remember all the little detail. This recipe is as close to perfect as you can get if you want authentic flavor! I tend not to measure a lot, but I added a little of this and a little of that from teh listed ingredients (also reading the many great reviews and getting some additional ideas) and made two pies. Well, there may  be enough for three....I haven't finished assembling...but the meat filling is wonderful. I mashed half of the potatoes and cubed the other half, hubby's preference!

I have made this pie twice and it's very good.  The only change that I made to this recipe was adding an extra 1/4 water the second time I made it.  This was because the recipe is just a little dry....but it's extremely tasty.  I will keep making it...my family loves it!!

This meat pie was pretty good. Note that you should let the pie cool for 15 min to settle, otherwise it will crumble when you cut it into slices.

This is a fairly traditional Tourtiere.  I make mashed potato with just a little milk and butter.  NO cloves, and more cinnamon and allspice.  The trick is to keep simmering the pork and onion, gradually adding the spice until the flavors meld and water to keep from browning.  This can take an hour or more. Taste, taste, taste.

Very good!  It just is not Christmas without this wonderful meat pie.  I lost my own recipe and was very upset, then I tried allrecipes, yeah!!!!  We will now have a great Christmas Supper.  Instead of baking a potato, I grate a raw one right in with the meat mixture, 1/2 pork and 1/2 ground turkey and added more of the spices.  Just great!

I love this stuff, and this recipe is very similar to the one my Mom used to make.  The only difference if that she used crumbled soda crackers to thicken the meat mixture.  I makes a very smooth filling.  Great at holiday meals!

Tried this recipe for the first time, made this for my son in law and he said it is a keeper, have made others before but this one we will keep. One thing I did different was that I made the mixture the nite before and let it sit in fridge over nite, made my pastry in the morning, then baked it.

Tourtiere has become a traditional dish at our quite international Christmas table. I have been making it for several years. I don't like pork, so I use 1/2 beef + 1/2 turkey - comes out just as delicious. One can also use pumpkin spice since it has a perfect blend of the required spices!

Used to have this as a kid in Quebec and decided to try my hand at making one.  This recipe was perfect and we were happy with how it turned out-tasty and very filling! Didn't have cloves (and live a million miles from a store) so I just left them out but will add next time.  This is a keeper, thanks!

This recipe looked beautiful coming out of the oven, but it didn't have much taste to my family and my husband was not fond of the cinnamon. I used half pork and half beef but the mixture inside didn't have much taste. I reviewed the recipe to make sure I didn't leave any spice out and I didn't. I think perhaps based off of all of the good reviews, this just wasn't our preference. I think I might try again sometime but I will season the meat mixture differently. I did like the texture.

Very nice Tourtiere.!!..I'm am French-Canadian, and this recipe is close to my moms. I would suggest adding ground beef with the ground pork.
Also bread crumbs can be substituted for the potatoe, and to add 1 tsp curry, 2 tsp ginger, and 3 tsps savoury...this gives it that extra flavour.

Very good. I browned the ground pork with the onions before adding the water, so I only had to let it simmer for about 20 min. I only added a dash of cinnamon, but also added some thyme and summer savory. I was out of white potatoes, so I mashed a sweet potato instead.

I've made this twice now and it has been a big hit both times.  I did modify a few things- I left the cinnamon out (well, I put just a dash) and in its place put almost a full teaspoon of allspice.  I also used pound of ground beef and a pound of ground pork instead of just pork.  Also I ony used half a large onion.  The first time I made it i used a 1 lb. seasoned ground sausage and 1 lb. ground beef.  I found that while it was good this recipe is much better with the ground pork/ground beef combo.    Even with modifications I give this recipe 5 stars.

I substituted ground beef for the pork and I cooked and drained the fat from the meat, but otherwise it was pretty much the same. I think baking the potatoes really made a difference. I didn't have too high of hopes for this recipe; I thought it would just be something different to try, and I was really surprised at how good it was! I will definitely make this again.

Wonderfully easy and beautiful taste. I followed the changes as recommended by @lynmarie: using no water or cinnamon and adding the potato only once meat was cooked. I used puff pastry to save time -awesome! Thank you for the recipe :)

Followed the recipe, except used instant potatoes. Was almost temped to not cook the mixture on the stove for the full hour. So glad I chose to do so! It made all the difference. Even my hubby liked it. Pie was even better the second day.

This was easy to make, looked beautiful & tasted pretty good.  The only thing I did was salt it at the table.  Prepared according to the recipe, the flavors were there but needed the "umph" of that dash of salt at the table.  The kids enjoyed it, too.

I made this last night but halved the cinnamon and put in 1/4 teaspoon of allspice. Also put in 1/2 ground pork and 1/2 ground beef. I drained it after frying and then added spices and water. It was perfect although as I omitted the potato, it didn't stick together. Next time I'll add the potato cooked in the microwave. I also cheated and used pillsbury pie crust - I don't like it for sweet pies but for savoury it is fine. Will make again and again.

This is an excellent recipe! My grandmother used to make meat pies when I was young but sadly she passed away (1991) when I was young and I was unable to memorize the recipe or find out if she ever wrote it down. After making this, I was reminded of her meat pies! I was so happy! It isn't exactly the same but VERY close. Thank you for sharing and bringing back memories of a great time in my life!

delicious! but, as suggested by other reviews, I greatly recommend doubling all the spices. I doubled them all, and the flavours were just right. I'd also replaced the pork with grounded beef and turky. tastes wonderful!

My husband's family is french Canadian and this is a traditional dish at Christmas.  I have been getting raves ever since I started making it.  I usually make it with half pork and half ground beef and I brown the meats and drain the fat off before I do the next steps.  I also always double the amount of cloves because to me that is the flavour that should be the most dominant in this pie.

I was a little thrown off by the spices, but they work beautifully.  This is better than meatloaf, and cheaper than the store bought meat pies.  I make it a couple of times a month.  I don't use the egg and paprika, because I find that the pie stands by itself very nicely.

I followed the recipe pretty much as listed and my family really liked it.  I doubled the quantity to make 2 pies and I opted to add cinnamon as if only making 1 pie due to the comments about cinnamon I read.  Everything else was the same and it was lovely.  I would make it again. It had a nice flavor!

I tried this recipe out last year for mother's day for my Canadian mom-in-law. She and her family LOVE it and ask me to make it regularly. She says that it tastes just like, if not better than, the meat pies her family had every year during the holidays. Thanks for helping me score points with the in-laws! =)

Tourtiere is a Christmas morning tradition at my parents house.  My great-grandmother, Mimi, used to make it when I was younger.  She lived to be 105 years young and then my mom took over making the breakfast pie.  Our family recipe calls for the meat to be ground 3 times by the butcher so that it is very fine.  This recipe, made by my mom, is very, very close to our traditional recipe and it is a lot less work.  I have only ever had this delicious pie for breakfast and we always serve it with eggs over easy and fresh fruit.  What a pleasant surprise to find a recipe so close to our original that can be made in half the time.  This will be made again, thank you for sharing.

Thanks for the recipe! I lost my old family recipe and happened upon this one. The only difference was I cubed the raw potato and simmered it with the meat (1/2 pork/1/2 ground beef) and spices.I will have to get the ingredients and make some pies for Thanksgiving. My family will be thrilled!

Made this last night for my kids. Made one change do to time.  Instead of the potatoe, I added a can of diced potatoes and then it cut the time in the first steps.  Drained it and put in the the pie crust.  It was so good.  Both my kids and I loved it.  Oh and I did add shredded carrots to this for more veggies.  There was nothing left on any of there plates.  My daughter went back for a second helping.  So good.  Will be making this again.

Great recipe!    I used half beef/half pork.  I also used instant real potatoes to thicken and I upped the amount of spices as well as used 1/4 cup water and 1/4 cup red wine.  I chose to not brush the crust with egg and paprika.   It turned out beautifully!  I will definitely make this again!  Thanks for the recipe!  It's a keeper.

I made this with half beef and half pork, as other reviewers suggested. I also made the spice measurements heaping spoonfuls, and didn't bother with the water. Amazing! I will definitely be making this a Christmas Eve tradition.

I loved this, my son liked it and DH thought it was just ok.  My mother made something like this once in a while, and it was similar to how she made it. I thought the flavor was just great. I followed the recipe exactly, but I did microwave the potato to save time as another review had mentioned. I'll make this again, but probably not too often since DH isn't crazy about it :)

Delish!  Recommended changes; half the amount of cinnamon called for.  Cook the pork and onions separately then drain off some of the fat (there will be a lot).  It said to simmer for 1 hour or until very thick - mine simmered for 10 min. and was as thick as I wanted it.  It turned out very tasty and the entire family enjoyed it.  I served steamed asparagus on the side.

This one tastes like my memeres from when I was a little girl. A very good base recipe... I have switched it up a little by adding some red wine and a little moe spice.

I made this for a family party and everyone loved it. I decided to double the recipe at the last minute so wound up using half beef and half pork. Left out the cinnamon-after reading reviews and used more allspice. I also microwaved my potatoes and didnt wind up doubling the water just added enough to let it simmer. Did not use egg or paprika and the top was beautiful.

Tastes just like my Memere's pork pie.  Thank you so much for this recipe.  I do have my Memere's recipe however a lot of it is according to her taste buds.  The women in the Marquis family get together before the holiday season to make about 12 of these pies.  But sadly my family is in New England and I am in Illinois so it was nice to have a taste of home here.

I loved this recipe! I have never had/made meat pie before, so I was very excited to make this. I made the meat filling the night before, and refrigerated it over night. Then I only had to wait an hour before it was ready tonight. It was very good, except next time i am going to add more potato, and maybe carrots.

This is the second time I have tried to make this dish.  I think it really must be a regional taste as it just doesn't go over well at our house. If I were to try it a third time I would leave out the cloves as that is the flavor that just turns us off of this dish. It was also a little dry so I would try to make a light gravy for the meat (without going overboard on it).

Made this for my French Canadian BF and we loved it!  Will be making for a Christmas brunch party.  Used half beef and half pork and whole wheat crust.

The flavor on this pie is to die for. It is the exact flavor that pork pie should have! I only simmered the ingredients for about 30 minutes then made it in mini sizes in large muffin pans! Great idea for company!

I too have been searching for a recipe like my Memere use to make.  The issue that I'm having is keep the meat pie together without mashing the potatoes.  My Memere always cubed her potatoes and did not use any type of cracker/instant potato flakes to keep it together.  This recipe has all the ingredients minus the cinnamon,paprika and onion which my Memere did not use.  I did double up on the spices as suggested by another review--other than that it was good--I'm going to continue to try and get my pie to stay together just like my Memere's Tourtiere.

thanks Maggie!

I made this wonderful tourtiere twice over the Christmas season. I used frozen pie crust because pastry scares the bejesus out of me. The pie is absolutely perfect, however I do recommend going with the 1lb of pork to 1/2lb of beef ratio that others have reccomended. I tried it both with this mix and with all pork, and we preferred the flavour with the beef mixed in. Everything else should be left exactly as is. A bit time consuming, but totally worth it for the holidays. By the way, it makes more like 6 servings, not 8, unless you are making it as part of a buffet. Thanks for the new Christmas tradition!

I was advised to use half pork, half beef so it wouldn't be too dry and it worked out well.  I thought the spices were a bit too mellow but it seemed that after the pie sat overnight that the flavors improved.  It was really easy to make and well worth it.  I plan to make this on a regular basis.  Thank you!

This was a huge hit at dinner.  I tried the half pork/half ground beef variation others recommended and I also browned the meat and simply added the water instead of simmering the ingredients for an hour and I got a perfect moisture level in the end product.  I paired it with Corn Chowder I, a watercress salad and some nice wine.  Excellent for a cold fall/winter night.  Thanks for sharing!

My husband would give this 5 stars, I would give it about 4, so we will go with 4 haha. It was super easy to make, and I liked it, just not as much as he did.In fact, he liked it so much he ate 3 servings and ate the rest for lunch today, and he never ever eats leftovers. I did not add celery or carrots since I had neither, and I microwaved the potato for a couple of minutes so it wouldn't be undercooked when the pie came out of the oven.

I've never had Meat Pie (Tourtiere) before, but thought it sounded interesting.  Well let me say this was delicious!  The only changes I made was to increase the allspice and add a little nutmeg and omit the egg wash and paprika on top.  My husband said I can make this again next week it was so good. Thanks for a great recipe, Maggie Rogers. I'll be making this again soon.

I made this for a Christmas day buffet and it was a huge hit with the family. It reminded us all of my French Canadian mother in law's recipe that she made many, many years ago. I am now wanting to pass down these recipes to my grown children and this is one of them. Only thing I changed was to add a bit more salt to taste. I had 2 pounds of ground pork so adjusted the rest of the ingredients accordingly. I used a store bought pie crust for convenience, but remember my mother in law saying a lard pie crust is best for this recipe and to use a bit less than normal since the crust absorbs some of the fat from the pork. This was delicious!

Had French meat pie only a couple times since I met my Canadian husband.  Made this exactly to the recipe since I wouldn't know how to put my own spin on it.  It passed the taste test by the in-laws!!

I have made this as written, it's a five star for sure! I just made one with all beef cause I didn't have any pork. No worries folks. Not the authentic pie, but still oh so good!

My mother and both of my grandmothers were French Canadian. It was always a treat to Have Tourtieres. They were not just for Christmas. They were for any time my mother wanted a rib-sticking plate or finger food for supper at home or for our school lunch boxes. Al the other French Canadian kids in our old country school also brought the same lunches. The tourtieres were all similar except for the herbs and spices. This one is very close. The next one I make, I will tinker with a bit looking for that elusive mother magic taste.

First time making tortiere. Very easy to follow. Didn't have the cloves, so I used a half teaspoon of allspice instead. 
My French Canadian family loved it!

So good! I have used the recipe in pie crust , and also stuffed it in a gutted loaf of Italian bread with bacon strips over the top and baked it yum.

Very good. I make it with rice instead of potatoes and just salt and pepper to taste. Smother with homemade ketchup. Tastes like Saint Georges du Beauce

I made this recipe and it was a huge hit when I made is for Christmas 2011.  It was my first time ever making Tourtiere.  I had my great aunt's family recipe, but wanted to find my own.  Instead of using 1 potato like the recipe asked for, I used one package of instant mashed potatoes.  I found that this helped bind the pie together.  As you know, traditionally using 100% pork is what helps bind the pie together because of the high fat content.  I use a 50% beef 50% pork mix.  I really loved the spices for this recipe.  Each family has their own combination, but I loved this one.  I had my in-laws over and they are from Quebec.  They said it was the best they ever had.

I make toutiere every year early in december and then freeze.  Christmas Eve I thaw and bake until warm. I thought I would try a new receipe  and I am glad I did.  I use half lean ground beef and half pork, double the recipe and make 2 pies.  I also use a pastry cutter with the baked potato, gives it a little twist as compared to mashed or diced.  The spices were perfect although my allspice dash was a bit more.  My family loves this meat pie and it will always be a Christmas Eve tradition.  I serve with HP sauce and/or spicy rhubard relish, and a salad.

YUMMY! Even my picky-eater husband loves this recipe. I've done it with one pound each of ground beef and ground pork and did it tonight with three pounds of ground beef (doubled spices). Each time I did with instant potatoes for convenience more than anything. I don't measure the potatoes, just add till I like the ratio (adding more water or milk as needed for consistency). I've always use store-bought crusts (again, convenience). It is AMAZING! With the three pounds of ground beef, I had enough to fill three store-bought pie crusts so I now have two in the freezer. I did use half the cinnamon and a bit more allspice...I might use a little less clove next time, too, but that's a personal thing.

This recipe works great! I traditionally make tourtiere with 1/2 pork and 1/2 veal, but I think this is a matter of personal preference.I think the only change I would make is less cinnamon.

This recipe is amazing, so so soooo good. And it fills the house with the best aromas! I've made it a few times now and I follow most of BKBishop's changes - use half pork, half beef; don't drain it; sub in red wine; less cinnamon, more allspice and I use boxed mashed potatoes.  I make it really easy on myself with the potatoes by adding the dry flakes straight into the meat mix - during the last few minutes of simmering add 2/3 C potato flakes & another 1/4 cup red wine. Mix it up and let it thicken for a few minutes and you're ready to go. (You can add a bit more potato flakes if it needs more thickening.) Overall this recipe is so easy to make but tastes like a gourmet meal. Seriously delicious - thanks Maggie Rogers!

This was an easy recipe and was as good as I any Tourtiere  I have sampled before.  At the last minute, I decided to use just a top crust, in order to ease my health teacher's conscience. I also used the filling to make two pies: one to eat for dinner and froze one for later.  My husband (my biggest critic) and I were surprised at how much we didn't miss the second crust and will do this again.

Very good.  I used already cooked and shredded pork and still cooked as directed.  I added the potato in near the end as I used mashed potatoes.  It smelled so good while simmering with the spices, but I didn't taste much of the spices after baking.  I didn't top with a crust as I ran out of it, so just folded the edges over.  It still worked, just didn't look as pretty as it could have.  This is relatively easy and it turns out well; just would like to taste the spices more.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a fabulous and flavorful dish! I have received many compliments on it! Even my Canadian friends (who know what a good Tourtiere should taste like) love this recipe! I do use half ground beef and half ground pork to add a little more flavor, but no other changes are needed!

We thought this was a great recipe.  I didn't have ground cloves on hand, and am not usually too fond of the flavor anyway, so left that out.  Worked out just fine, I just added a little more of the other spices.  Very tasty change of pace, and easy to do!

Baked it yesterday evening and ate it straight from the oven with company. Next time I'll bake it, I may mash a larger potato or add some cornstarch, for filling was very runny. Would also try 1/2 ground pork + 1/2 ground veal. Otherwise, excellent, made even better with a dollop of sour cream or some apple sauce.

Excellent! I've been looking for this for years. My grandmother used 1/2 beef and 1/2 pork so I just changed that part. It was a HUGE hit!

The next time I make this I will add more salt, it also came out dry for me as well. I love the flavor though, thanks.

I used 2lbs of venison with beef fat for the ground meat and instant potato flakes to adjust for the extra moisture from the venison. Ven releases a lot of liquid when cooking and I should’ve realized I didn’t need the 1/2 cup water.The rest was “by the book” and it came out great!

I was trying to recreate what my mother used to make and her cooking was very uncomplicated so I left out many of the spices. I was very pleased because with the first bite I was transported back to her kitchen. It wasn't true to the recipe but it was just like her's.

This was very good! More trouble than I'd take on a weeknight, but fine for a weekend. We used mashed potato flakes instead of baking a potato, and browned the pork and onions before simmering them in chicken stock. We also used store-bought pie crusts. I used a bit more allspice than the recipe said and added some garlic powder, but otherwise kept the spices the same as the recipe. It smelled delicious in the oven, and tasted great. We'll definitely make this again some time.

Had great flavor. I followed some of the other viewers suggestions and was pretty happy with the results. I plan to mix in 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar cheese, 1/3 cup frozen sweet peas,  1/3 cup of julienned fresh carrots to the filling before baking my next pie for added flavor and texture.

Great recipe! Super easy just a little time consuming. But was able to cook while taking care of my 4 month old. I used a lager beer instead of water and it gave it a little extra flavor and boiled the potatoes to make it a little quicker. Also I boiled carrots as well and mashed them together for some extra veggies! So yummy?? freezes well too!

Wonderful! Every year or so I make foods from a different country for Christmas. This year I chose France. I never expected a spiced MEAT pie to be something I would love. It made me think of minced meat. But, it came up in my search for French foods and my husband and I thought we’d give it a go and did a preliminary test drive. Definitely will repeat this one and make double for when the kids come! Thank you Lynmarie for your suggestions!  We ground a pork loin for the meat, cooked the potato in the microwave, left out the cinnamon and used 1/4 teaspoon allspice. However, we did add the water because the meat was so lean there was almost no fat. We kept adding water all along to help the cooking process, but, I’m not sure I’d suggest doing that next time. I think I’d just turn down the heat some. However, it cooked down pretty quickly and we took a potato masher to the mixture as it cooked to help it mix together better. We cooked it on medium in an iron skillet and it took less than 40 minutes for it to thicken and be ready to place in the pie crust and bake.. I’m glad we didn’t include the cinnamon and didn’t add garlic as someone suggested. I think both would over power the subtleties of the dish. Very good and worth the time.

Good but needs more salt and more spices I think. Next time I would use instant mashed potatoes to save on time. The paprika at the end is not necessary.

Have been looking for a french meat pie recipe to try. I haven't made this yet but will try it the way a french co-worker told me she makes it .  She uses oatmeal instead of potato & I love the sound of that.

I found this an easy recipe to follow and, although you had to cook the mixture for quite a while, I thought it went pretty fast. 
I followed the recipe as it was written, except I halved the amounts as there were just two of us. Even so we only ate half of the pie and so have another opportunity to enjoy it. 
I don’t buy pie crusts, so made my own, but as I said otherwise it was as written. 
The pie was very tasty and easy to serve, meaning it held its shape when serving it from the pie dish.  I would definitely make this again.

Emploer loved this.  Turned out very nice.  Cook on bottom rack to ensure crust browns well.

It’s been a while since I made this and I forgot how tasty it is! I cooked the potato in my instant pot (about 20 mins depending on the size of the potato) and mashed it. When I waited for the pressure to release I started browning the meats (I used 1/2 ground pork, 1/2 ground beef). Added all the spices (doubling allspice, halved cinnamon; added garlic powder) and water and let it simmer. Then I added the mashed potato and let that thicken, on low, for about 20 minutes. Then I added everything in the pie crust, sealed with top crust, and sprinkled on smoked paprika (didn’t use the egg). The finished product was awesome!

This recipe is very good. I substituted chicken stock for the water and microwaved the potato and mashed with a fork. Also I used a combo of pork and ground beef and cooked in a saucepan for a half hour instead of an hour.  Otherwise I followed the recipe.

I made a few changes to this great recipe.  I did not use allspice and I used half pork and half beef.  Excellent meat pie.  I will make two more for Christmas.

Excellent. The only change I made is I boiled the potatoe instead of baking it which was quicker.

This was quite good. I did make a few changes: half ground pork/half ground beef. Used sage and fresh garlic in addition to the other spices. I also found this needed extra salt and pepper. I layered my pie: first half-baked sliced sweet potatoes, meat mixture, peeled and sliced pears, and more meat mixture. 

DO microwave your potato instead of baking it. 15 mins on high and you're done. Life saver.

Québec me manques! I made the filling the night before and refrigerated it overnight so the fat rose to the top and hardened so I could easily remove it. It felt like I was back in Québec! Delicious!

This is the type of recipe I like to make, minimal ingredients, maximum flavor.  Like others, I used the Pillsbury prepared pie crusts and combined about 75% ground pork and 25% ground chuck.  I also used 1/4 cup red wine in addition to 1/2 cup water, and added one minced carrot for a bit of sweetness.  I sautéed the onion and carrots for about 3 minutes in olive oil, then added the meat mixture for a few minutes, then added the rest of the ingredients while the meat was still pink.  In all other aspects, I prepared exactly as the recipe was written, and the mixture was ready in about 45 minutes to fill the pie shell.  The pie came out great, and made four generous servings.  I will make this again.

I used 2 large pork chops baked to render the fat, Used old-fashioned crank-operated meat grinder to grind the meat, baked potato and raw onion. Did not cook anything in water but mixed ingredients together and baked in two-crust pie. It turned out exactly like Pork Pies made by Canadian French cooks I have known.

I will not  rate this.  Forget you saw the one star rating. One reviewer said, " it must be an acquired taste". I think for me, that statement rings true. I think every style of cooking  and regional cuisine has beloved recipes that require being brought up on spice combinations indigenous to that cuisine. The flavor of this recipe was not one I could like initially, and I will have to admit I won't try again.

This was pretty good and quite easy to make with a frozen pie crust. Next time I would use a smaller potato and reduce the amount of meat to 1 or 1.25 lb. I felt that the ratio of filling to crust was too high with the proportions given in the recipe. Thank you for the recipe!

I really liked this meat pie. I made it for New Year's, and my guests loved it as well!! Making it is a bit of a task as it takes a long while. I'd recommend baking the potato in the microwave as opposed to the oven, as it will cut down the prep time a little bit. But I have to say, I wasn't expecting the spices to add such a delightful mix of flavor to the dish. They tied together very nicely and I very much enjoyed the whole thing, and I'm also glad I didn't butcher it, as it was my first time making a meat pie!!

My only qualm with this recipe is the consistency. I followed it exactly, stirred the mixture until thick, and baked, but when we took it out to serve, it crumbled quite a bit. I recommend adding a little something to glue together the filling a little more. Still rating five stars, because there's always the possibility that it was an error on my part (I don't cook very often). And of course, regardless of crumble, it was scrumptious. I'll probably make it again, if I can set aside the time required.

Turned out beautifully! Sautéed onion and bit of garlic with a pound each of ground beef and pork. Cut cinnamon down to 1/4 tsp. I boiled my peeled potato and used ricer which made it easy to mix and also used 1/3 cup low sodium chicken broth instead of water. I did use the egg wash because I cut out a fleur de lis  dough decoration and also omitted the paprika.

EAT THIS WITH KETCHUP!  My wife's grandmother used to make this for her.  I ate it plain without her.  But then she told me to eat it with ketchup, and it made a world of difference.  The sweetness of the ketchup, matches with the spice flavoring.  Awesome!  Also, I used a lot more water.  While it's simmering, keep it to a thick paste consistency.  Add more water as necessary.

Loved this!  Used combo of ground pork, beef, veal. Worked well.  I was a little shy using the spices. Will use more allspice next time.  Anxious to try it cold.

Will definitely make again, family loved it.  I played with the spices a bit since I didn't have ground allspice I added 1/4 tsp of mace and 1/4 tsp of nutmeg Plus I increased the salt and pepper.  I simply boiled and mashed some potato to get 1 cup mashed. This is the key to the perfect consistency.  Very good

This is super good. I used around two pounds pork, a little over a pound of ground beef (Did not drain).  Added 4 cloves garlic. Cooked onion, garlic and meat together with 1-1/2 tsp salt and 1 tsp pepper. Then added 1/2 tsp allspice, 1/4 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp cloves, 1/2 tsp smoked paprika into filling. 2 mashed baked potatoes, and no water! Taste and adjust seasonings as needed. Baked one pie in a 10 inch cast Iron skillet and also made a second 8 inch pie. Would make two 9 inch pies beautifully. You must do an egg wash and sprinkle with paprika. Gives it such beautiful color. Love this. Going to reheat it for breakfast and top with a runny egg. Oh man, Super excited.

Doubled the spices, added 1.5 tsp of savoury and had to add a splash of Worcester sauce for some added depth. Also used ground beef only and diced a few raw potatoes into tiny cubes and threw them in with the meat as it was simmering in 1.5 cups of beef broth (vs water). 

Great recipe!

As a base recipe for a pork pie, I loved it.  I never make the recipes as written.  I read the reviews and adjust accordingly. My dad loved it.  I usually make beef pie.  This was a nice change.  i shredded leftover pork loin.

Used 2lb of pork, refrigerated pie crusts, half the cinnamon, and double the allspice. With some sour cream on top this is DELICIOUS! Boyfriend and I both love it. 

I cubed three gold potatoes as that's what I had on hand, and roasted them in the oven. I do NOT recommend this method. They wouldn't mash properly. Not sure if that really affected the texture of my pie, but it was pretty crumbly. 

Definitely will make again!!

I use lean beef instead of pork  (I don't care for the taste) and think it comes out really well. I add in more garlic and spices as well, but my husband and I think you can never have too much garlic. This is really good for a filling and basic recipe, especially when you have picky eaters visit.

Great recipe.  This will be my definitive recipe for tourtiere from here on out.  Meat held together perfectly - using a potato is a good idea.  Loved the touch of brushed egg and paprika on the pie crust (before baking).  The pie was beautiful to look at and fabulous to eat.  Thank you for sharing.

Long time tourtiere lover, first time tourtiere maker. This tourtiere was delicious. I loved all the spices, I made sure to add them to the hot pan of browning meat so that the heat brightened the spices. I boiled the potatoes for 5 min only so they acted like bread crumbs and soaked up all the meat juices and flavors. I added garlic of course. Used my own pie pastry recipe. ***my only suggestion, I think I'll add some wine, a fully bodied red perhaps, next time to the browning meat. It adds a greater depth of flavor. C'est Manefique!

When I was a child my Uncle Joe would make this on Christmas Eve. Now he's gone and so is his recipe.... however this one is just as memorable as his. Now everytime I think of Uncle Joe I make this Tourtiere.
Thanks for the great recipe and the memories

Very good recipe BUT when I make Tourtiere, I use a modern twist. Instead of bread crumbs or mashed potato, I use instant mashed potato flakes or buds (DRY, not reconstituted) and stir until the pork mixture is stiffened but not too dry. The volume of instant potato flakes depends on how wet your meat mixture is. I also increase the Allspice to 1/2 teaspoon and often add 1 clove of garlic, finely minced.
Another addition is 1/2 tsp. dried Thyme.
We always served our Tourtiere with green tomato ketchup or relish - home made, of course.  This pie is good hot, at room temperature or even cold.

I didn't change anything except I didn't use the egg/nutmeg at the end and added spices. When I tasted the meat at the end of the hour of simmering I was shocked at how bland it was! I could barely taste the cinnamon. Based on the reviews I thought the flavor would be stronger. I added tons more spices and salt including cayenne powder. I wanted bold flavors, to taste like a meat pie I remember from years ago.

Like many people who have a family history of this recipe, I do not, so I do not have anything to compare this to. I have made this twice now, once with all ground pork and once with lean ground beef. Both were excellent. The first time I followed directions as written. The only difference the second time was that I reduced the water to a third of a cup, a compromise between those who said it was too much water and those who said omit. I used pre-made pie crust both times and omitted the egg wash and paprika. This was a hit in our home with no leftovers. Thank you Maggie, for a wonderful recipe.

Ultra yummy!  I didn't tweak the body of the recipe at all.  The texture is perfect!  I did tweak the spices a lot though.  I used garam masala, cumin, paprika and crushed pepper flakes instead.  It made a very exotic, spicy meat pie.  Using a half butter, half lard crust made it perfect.  Thanks for helping me impress my date. ;)
