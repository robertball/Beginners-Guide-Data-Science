I had a beef heart in my freezer from our purchase of a 1/4 cow from a local organic farm. I had no idea what to do with it. It was kind of daunting, I was afraid to cook it, until I found this recipe. All I can say is WOW! This is so good that I might buy another heart just to make it again. I did not tell my family, what cut of beef was in this dish when I served it in order to avoid the drama of thier reaction, and everyone ate seconds on it. It will be my little secret. Now I just need to figure out what to do with the tongue and oxtails!!

I didn't put all of the vegies and beans in the recipe.  The heart was cooked all night in the crock pot, drained, then stewed in my own mole.  We had it with rice and beans.  Got rave reviews from all!

I'm making this recipe without the mole sauce, i.e, I don't know what mole sauce is and never heard of it, Can you buy it in the grocery store and is it known by another name.

this is my first review though I have been a member for years. This is the most flavorful dish-I followed it to the letter. My husband complimented me all through the meal of which he had thirds! The sweating of the vegetables gives this dish it's savory, rich flavors and complements the beef. Do not fear the heart!

Glad you tried/were inspired by the recipe.  I just wanted to mention that this recipe's nutrition information is off because it serves way more than 4 people.  It will easily feed 8 to 10 people.  So cut the nutrition info by half at least.  To reduce sodium use frozen rather than canned limas. Ruth

Great recipe! My only suggestion would be to not crowd the heart in the pan when browning. If you do the meat will steam rather than sear.  I made this with grass fed beef from my dad's ranch.  It was excellent. I snuck in pureed spinach and kale for extra nutrition and it was great!

I used black beans instead of lima beans for the full Latin concept and INSTANT CLASSIC! Superb use of mole...

Excellent--a great way to get more organ meats into our diet!  Mine wasn't exactly the same--I thought I had a parsnip, but I didn't, so I substituted sweet potatoes for all the root vegetables, and I made my own mole.

This is very good. However I did make some changes,I added 2 onions, 2 celery ribs and 4 carrots.I also used low sodium beef broth instead of the bouillon and water. I used a slow cooker on low for 8 hours,add black beans brought it back to temp, and put it over rice. It was a hit !  Next time I'll add a 1/2c mole,just not quite enough for my taste.

This was delicious!  I made a few modifications: Sweet potato used instead of parsnip; 2 cups beef broth used instead of beef bouillon and water; 2 stalks celery used; 1/2 c. water mixed with 21 g mole powder I found on Amazon.  I'll definitely make again!

I had a beef heart in the freezer from purchasing 1/2 a beef.  I had never cooked one before and didn't know what to do with it.  Thankfully I found this recipe!!  I followed it step by step except did not include the wine and mole sauce.  It turned out so flavorful and was a wonderful stew!!   My family thoroughly enjoyed it.  Thanks for sharing!

Just added some leftover grilled corn. Kids loved it even knowing what it was!
