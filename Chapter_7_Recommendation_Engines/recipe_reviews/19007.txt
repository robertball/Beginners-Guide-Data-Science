This was a lovely dessert that my dinner guests really enjoyed. I was a little nervous about getting them out of the ramekins but they slid out no problem. They did seem a bit on the small side but they are so rich that they proved to be the perfect size. I garnished with strawberries and whipped cream and they looked very pretty when I served them. Thanks.

This is my first time ever writing a review but this recipe deserves it! The modification I made was to use dark chocolate chips and simply melted them in the hot butter over low heat on the stove top. I also put these in cupcake papers and baked them in a cupcake tin rather than ramikins still baking them in a water bath. They turned out perfectly!!

This recipe was pretty good. I made it twice, Thanksgiving and Christmas Eve family dinners. Next time, I would like to experiment with adding a couple tablespoons of flour and maybe a little coconut to give it a little more body.

Baked in a 1/2 size coffee mug and topped with blackberries, raspberries and a light dusting of powdered sugar.  I used about 1/2 bittersweet chocolate and 1/2 semi-sweet.  Everyone (including 2 yr old) loved it.

This dessert is wonderful. I enjoy trying new recipes, so I rarely make the same recipe over and over again, but this is so good I can't stop making it. Its absolutly delicous. Smooth and chocolaty.

These were easy to make, however, when I tried to unmold them, they stuck to the ramekins.  I was planning to top them with fresh raspberries and whipped cream, but my kids ate the raspberries before I could finish the dessert.  I don't think I'll make this one again.

I've made this Valentine's dinner for years now and my daughter requested for her 13th Birthday dinner...had lost the recipe and spent way too long searching.  So glad I finally remembered the name.
