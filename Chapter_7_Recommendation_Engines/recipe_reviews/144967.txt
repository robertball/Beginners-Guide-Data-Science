Great recipe..I agree you cant go wrong with Jello & cool whip!  My only change to this cake is to sometimes use cake!  I use any kind of white, lemon, or even pound cake.  You can 'frost' the top with cool whip then add the berries or as I do, making the cake into 2 layers, putting a down 1 cake layer, adding thin layer of cool whip then berries, then the 2nd cake layer; this time arranging the berries over the cool whip as the USA flag :-)

OH MY GOODNESS!!!  I made this recipe when Cool Whip came out with it when I was a little girl, with my Mother's assistance, of course.  This is very simple and tasty.  Great for kids to make with grown-up help.

Since we were having a July 4th party this year, I decided to try this, and it was great - everyone at the party loved it, and most had seconds. Personally, I wasn't sure about the jello mixing with the cake (I thought it made the pound cake too mushy, but no one else seemed to mind), so next time I may leave out the cake, or I'll let the jello harden more before I layer it in (or maybe mix the jello with some cool whip and layer that). Overall, a big hit, and very festive and pretty - will make again!

My workplace had a Memorial Day lunch yesterday and we all contributed a dish...this was what I chose to make and bring. I did use an extra deep 9x13 pan which required more jello. (I used an additional 4 serving sized box). I used sugar free jello, and extra creamy Cool Whip. I GOT RAVE REVIEWS and more than one request for the recipe!

Very simple, fun, & festive!  I brought this cake to a Labor Day party & it was a huge hit... there was almost none left.  I did use the sliced pound cake but next time I'd like to try cutting out some of the unneccessary calories (using a white cake mix - though that wouldn't save any time -, Sugar Free Jello, and Light Cool Whip).

I've been making this cake for a couple of years for different occasions and keep forgetting to give a review. Anyway, love it, love it, live it!!! Sometimes I use sugar free whipped cream and fat free cream cheese to make it lighter for those who is on diet,  everyone loves it and no left overs ever. Thank you very much!!!

I made this for this years past Fourth of July and it came out perfectly. It didn't come out as pretty in slices as I would ahve liked, but I think that was my fault:)

This is a simple, light, delicious cake.  It is perfect for a hot Fourth of July party!  I made it last year and I am making it again this year because everyone loved it.  People said it tasted fresh and summer-y, not overly sugary and weighed down like a regular cake would taste.

This is a bit of a different take using Jello. I've made something similar.. I bake a chocolate cake and then use cool whip as frosting and decorate using the berries is the same way. The people at work look forward to it towards July 4th!!

Made this for a 4th of July BBQ.  Looked great, but tasted just OK.  Nothing spectacular and the pound cake seemed to dry out.  Next year will look for a different patriotic dessert.

This cake was easy and fun to make. So festive for the holiday.  It is a great make-ahead dessert.  I made it on Friday, served it on Saturday and it was still beautiful to slice and serve on Sunday, even though there was very  little of it left.  I used 1/2 recipe of the 50% reduced sugar cake mix (made cupcakes with the rest), cooked the cake in the 9x12 pan, popped it in the freezer to cool while I was making the jello and then assembled it.  I also used sugar free jello and cool whip so it was practically guilt-free.

The recipe on the cool whip site now has a cream cheese layer.  If you decide to use that double the amount it suggests.  My family said it got lost between the jello laye & the cool whip layer. Made this using suga free everything & a low sugar cake mix still turned out GREAT!!!

This was a very easy, light recipe.  Went over very well at our 4th of July cookout.  All my guests loved the cake, however, I personally would've preferred doing a jello-poke-cake instead.  I like the idea of the jello being incorporated into the cake rather than forming a different layer on top of it.  The textures didn't appeal to me as well seperated.
Again, very easy and received well by guests.

Impressive cake for 4th of July!  I opted to make a butter recipe vanilla cake mix and added 3 ozs cream cheese with a couple tablespoons sugar to the Cool Whip to give it more body. It was a hit!  A definite 5-stars with the modifications I made. Sharing my pic.

I loved this recipe.  I tweaked the jello a bit though.  After I added the 1 1/2 cups of hot water to wild strawberry gelatin, I substituted the cold water for 10 ounces of stoli strawberry vodka, and the remaining 6 ounces was ice.  Leave the gelatin in the fridge for approximately 10 minutes instead of 5 because the alcohol slows the setting process a bit.  This was absolutely delicious.  Great 4'th of july cake with a bit of a kick.

Not a huge fan of Jello, but made this for my husband's family and they loved it! Cake got a little bit soggy, but it was really easy and fun to make and I loved decorating it like the American Flag! Definitely a great holiday treat!

YUM! I made this today for our July 4th BBQ and it was a hit :) I sliced up the extra large strawberries for the jello, and saved the smaller strawberries (that are closer in size) for the topping, so the stripes were more uniform in size. Great dessert!

It was fun putting this cake together, I added 2 pkgs.of 8oz cream cheese and 1/3 cup sugar to the cool whip which gave it more density, flavor and made it easier to decorate.  Everyone loved it, I thought it was just OK.  Next year I will make a jello poke cake with red & blue jello and use the topping I made for this one, I think I will like that better.

It looks great but it tastes very blah! The cake itself is very festive and fun looking but the taste is really lacking. It is a twiste on strawberry short cake. I think regular strawberry short cake tastes much better.

This recipe is good except that next time I would use 2 containers of cool whip or better yet real whip cream. Its very light for a hot summer day in Arizona.

The cake ended up looking amazing but I was not too impressed with the cake itself.  The jello and pound cake combo just didnt do it for me, but I had friends over who enjoyed it.  I don't think I will make it again without making some changes.

I liked the cake, a lot! I made this yesterday for the Wednesday night service at my church. We celebrated the fourth of July two days early and the cake was great. Everyone who ate it had seconds and some had thirds. Like I said, I liked it, but it seems to me their could be another substitute for the jell-o because some of the people there did not eat it because of the jell-o...any who, great cake, great recipe :)

Pretty, but bland...definately needed cream cheese or something.  The jello took a LOT longer to get to egg-white consistency.  If I made it again, I would blend half cool whip and half cream cheese.

Didn't like the pound cake in the recipe. Next time I make it I'm leaving out the cake.
