I have to admit that I didn’t measure anything.  I just estimated the amounts, added some dried cherries I wanted to use up, and also a little wheat germ as a personal preference.  The honey was from a farmers’ market and was incredible so I knew it would be perfect for the granola.  It's very good.

I didn't have apricots or golden raisins so I substituted cranberries and regular raisins.  Didn't have all the other nuts I needed either, substituted slivered almonds and crumbled up walnuts.  It was excellent.  I think that so long as you have approximately the same measurements of other nuts and berries this is a can't fail incredible granola.

Good as a basic granola recipe; it is easy to substitute nuts & fruit and add more grains (chia seeds & quinoa). I added almond extract to the honey/butter mixture.  In the future I will double the honey & butter, as I prefer my granola a bit "stickier".

I made a few changes. I added coconut oil instead of butter and dried coconut. I didn't have any walnuts so I left those out and have had to to put whole almonds, which I chopped. I made it a few times and have used both honey and agave nectar with similar outcomes. I like this recipe because it lends well to the adaptions. I tried using tinfoil to line the pan and that did not work. Parchement paper works the best.

I wanted a purely vegan granola, so I replaced the honey with 1/3 cup maple syrup and 2 tablespoons brown sugar; the butter with an equal amount of melted coconut oil. Great crunchy texture.
