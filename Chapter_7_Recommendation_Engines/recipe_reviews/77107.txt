Basically very good, however I also felt that there was something missing.  I added 2 very finely chopped chipotles and feel that the taste improved.  Comparing it to a cookbook of very traditional Mexican recipes I noticed that it is more authentic to use dried ancho and guajillo chiles, all pork (pig head or hooves to be exact) and no cumin....but really there are as many ways to make a good pozole as there are cooks in Mexico!  To avoid kind of tough chile skins in you soup, strain the blended chile & chicken broth into the soup pot. Thanks for the recipe! It is traditional to have Pozole on New Year's Day so enjoy this great soup and..Feliz Ano Nuevo to you all!

Very good basic recipe.  Pozole is eaten with shredded cabage, diced onions, lime, sliced radishes, and sometimes cilantro or oregano sprinkled on top and tortillas rolled up in the palm of your hand to dip in your soup.

This recipe is very good and can feed a lot of people.  I used pork shoulder roast and I left out the chicken.  I also added one can of Red Chile Colorado sauce.

Cheryl B stole my thunder..... I signed up just to leave a comment about how lame everyone is that changes the recipe and then rate it badly ("I couldn't find hominy at my local store" or "I've never heard of chicken in pozole before"......really?!). There are many different pozole recipes and the taste varies greatly. I was looking not for a "traditional" recipe, but for one that did not require a 2 part cooking process and could cook unattended. To that end I found a very good base recipe. Will I make changes? Absolutely, but only because of my personal taste and will not penalize the author of this recipe with a bad rating. For everyone that finds that this recipe is, "missing something" that they, "can't figure out".....it's probably the marrow flavor that you're missing because this is a boneless recipe.

Very good! There was something missing in the recipe that I just couldn't figure out, but we really enjoyed this dish. We added some roasted jalapenos and anaheim chilies into the blender to give it a little more spice. We used chicken breast only, white hominy only and reduced salt broths (salt to taste at the dinner table). Poured the pozole over mexican rice in a bowl and ate with corn tortillas - YUM! Not greasy at all. Will definitely make again with a few more tweaks. Couldnâ€™t give this 5 stars since we altered the ingredients.

This recipe was great after I added and deleted some ingredients.  It is so easy since it is done in a crockpot.  Instead of the chile negro, I used a small can of chili colorado sauce.  Instead of chicken, I used all pork (1 1/2 lbs. boneless country ribs).  I only used ONE tablespoon of cumin and didn't add the green chili's.  I also added more hominy.

I liked this pozole. Although I do prefer red chiles. Someone said this was like a soup. That would be because it IS a soup.

I made this new years day and it was soooo good! I used all chicken, and i couldn't get the chili's in time, so i used about 14oz can of red enchilada sauce. everything else i pretty much followed the recipe, except i used hot diced chilis and it was so spicy i had to add more broth (because we had kids eating too). We served with diced avocado, cheese, crushed corn chips and sour creme on top to cut the heat. we also had all the fixings suggested. everyone loved it, even the kids!! and this recipe went a long way. Im making this over and over again!   **update** made again, with all pork tenderloin. used a can of chile colorado sauce instead of grinding chilis, added more garlic, fresh & ground, cumin & mexican oregano. Again a huge hit w/ the crowd! made enough for a med/lrg bowl for 12 people. excellent!

I used a whole pork shoulder for my Pozole and all white hominy.  I added carrots and black beans just for more substance.  Also, it's great if you top with Cotija cheese if you can get it.  Put crumbled tortilla chips, sour cream, and lettuce on top for an awesome dish!

Very good crock pot recipe.  I made a few changes as well such as lessening the cumin and instead of dicing up 2 onions which seemed like a lot, I quartered the onions and removed before serving.  I used a pasilla chili but will use guajillo next time for a bit more kick.  I also added some ground up de arbol chilis in my serving bowl for some spice.

Excellent pozole! Very easy to make. It's important to serve with cabbage, limes and cilantro. Corn torillas, radishes and avocado optional.

This recipe was a hit!!! I had never made pozole before this & am not a big fan of pozole but my husband is Hispanic and it is his favorite meal so I decided to try it out for him..... He loved it and even said it was better than his mom's recipe (shh, don't tell!) & my husband never raves about my cooking!! I did everything that this recipe calls for, I think I added a bit less cumin as suggested in other reviews & used all white hominy but that's it, Next time I make it I might put a bit more broth though. I would also like to add that you must put out all the traditional toppings so that everyone can add their own final touch.... Cilantro, limes, cabbage, diced onions, & dried oregano. I will definitely make this recipe over & over again!!

My husband LOVES Pozole, and he liked this recipe.  For our tastes, the next time I make it, I'll cut the meat in half, double the hominy, and maybe add a bit more broth to make it even more "soup-y"

I added a little extra water, and used only chicken but  the recipe was pretty great for a slow cooker pozole!  And to the "this is more like a soup" comment.... that would be because pozole IS a soup!! :)

This is a very good recipe, a bit different tasting than other Pozole Soups that I have had, but tasty none the less. 
I cannot figure out why some change the ingredients, and then say something is missing or that it doesn't taste like what they know and give it a less than fair rating. Each recipe is what it is, and should be rated as such, then play with the ingredients if you wish.  This is a great tasting recipe and I will make it again.

This was a homerun recipe! Substituted a can of red enchilada sauce for the dried chile/broth combo.  Added a small can of salsa verde instead of the chopped chiles.  I used all drumsticks (about 5 or 6) and I put them in frozen.  Cooked it on 6 hours high and the meat fell right off the bone.

I have made this several times now, with and without the slow cooker.  The soup is yummy just as it is written without any changes.  However it adapts to well to vast amounts of personal changes accounting for personal taste or whatever you happen to have on hand.  For example, last night I made it with these changes.  Instead of pork tenderloin, I browned up 1 lbs of breakfast sausage with onions and drained the grease.  I pressured cooked a couple of chicken breasts and used the broth and the meat from those.  Then I added chopped jalapeno peppers from the jar because I was out of chiliâ€™s.  I added some of the liquid from the jar to give it more of a kick, I added both kinds of hominy but also added a can of chick peas just because I love chick peas.   Then  I added some fresh sliced carrots and left over steamed potatoes and served it to company.  They LOVED it.  It made a tasty hearty soup got rave reviews again and I gave out this recipe with the same advice I am giving here.   Try this recipe, it rocks!

Yep, this does make the house smell great!  Just be cautioned that it needs salt.  Also, I had to buy this huge bag of peppers, and they seemed to be rather small even when hydrated.  I put in three rather than one.  Also some white wine, just because.    Drop in some fried pork skins before eating.  They make a great snap-crackle-pop sound!

This is one of the most satisfying soups I've ever made. I asked a couple of dear hispanic ladies I know at our local farmer's market how they made it, and got a couple of different versions. The result was that I added a some chopped cabbage, corn, and some processed tomatillos. Also took another reader's suggestion and ran the ancho chile with some broth through a food processer & strained it. A little labor intensive, but, well worth the effort. Thanks for a really good recipe.

I thought this recipe made decent pozole with very little work. I found all the ingredients in my local Safeway (of major importance to me)including the pasilla, which I found in the produce section with all the dried fruits and stuff. The main thing I would do differently next time: Use regular broth, not low sodium broth, because this recipe ends up needing salt in the end.  It defeinitely needs a hot sauce to go with it as well.  I prefer a green sauce (used the green tobasco a couple times, which was okay), because I feel it just goes best with the pork.  To extend the recipe a little (I'm a student) I served it over rice a couple of times.  It made the meal just a little more hardy without any real added expense.

5 stars because I love the spicing! My boyfriend made a great batch on New Year Day and served 8. He used 2.5 lbs of cubed pork loin and no chicken (he said he's never seen chicken in Pozole!). He added two sliced pickled serrano peppers and a 2nd can of beef broth. He added a smidge more of the oregano and garlic too.
In Mexico City, the Pozole was much SPICIER. There, you dipped a salty tortilla chip in unsweetened whipped cream to cool off your tongue. This is great on any table with spicy Mexican food!

Awesome Pozole! I made this for a new years party and it all was gone before midnight. It made me feel I was back home in Mexico. Insted of using canned chicken broth, I made my own broth. I did not add the diced green chiles and it still came out wonderful. My husdand loved the Pozole.

Did anyone notice the can of beef broth mentioned in the ingredients list, but forgotten in the directions?  I'm curious of those who reviewed this recipe how many added the beef broth.  Since we're missing boiled bones the beef broth might help with some flavor.  I was hoping to find some direction before I make mine but will proceed with beef broth.  Thanks for a pozole recipe that a white girl like me can tackle!

This recipe was greasy and more like a soup. 

I had great difficulty finding the correct peppers.

I believe the missing ingredient is tomatillos - puree 1 pound with pasilla chili to create sauce in step 1.

This is a very good soup.I made it like the recipe except for the peppers. I left out the green chile and added two chipote peppers. This makes it a little hotter.

I had to improvise a bit because I didn't have all the ingredients. I used a dried guajillo pepper and some ground ancho and chipotle powder.
I also used only white hominy and all pork. But the basic recipe is one that can be modified with delicious results. 
My version may not be authentic, but it sure tasted good.

When do you add the beef broth?  I just put it in with all the other ingredients.  I just put it in the cockpot, so I haven't had a chance to try it yer.  I gave it four stars, just because it smells so good preparing it.  Here's hoping for the best!

I made this recipe for my ex's family.  They are from Mexico and they LOVED it.  Especially the boys, they went back for seconds.  It was so easy to make, especially with the crockpot, I could just leave it cook and finish other things around the house.  Just make sure you get Mexican oregano, it has a totally different flavor than the typical oregano.  Top it with shredded lettuce, red onion, lime juice and dried red peppers(chile piquen) if you dare.  :)

I startled this in the crock pot on a cold snowy day, and when we walked in the house a few hours later, it smelled so good!  It tasted really good too!  The only change I made was to add an ancho chile to the pasilla chile.  Next time I make this, I will brown the pork first for some added flavor and color, and maybe follow one of the suggestions to add some chipotle chile powder.

First time making. Pretty good, but I was surprised and then sort of relieved to see so many people say "it's sort of missing something and I can't figure it out". Me too! I thought it was just me. I am also not understanding why we don't brown the meat beforehand? Chicken doesn't have much flavor & I don't like the texture it turned out to be. After tasting 1/2 dozen times in it's original state of the recipe,  I ended up adding more Mexican cilantro, white pepper,  salt... still missing something....

Fantastic! I've made this pretty much as is 3 times now, and it's always a huge success. The only thing I change is I only use chicken meat, because I prefer not to eat pork. I love it.  Thank you!

Super easy to make...this was my first try making Pozole, the Family loved it and needless to say nothing was left after dinner.
