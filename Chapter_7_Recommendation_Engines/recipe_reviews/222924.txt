This was a pretty good mango salsa, but not the best I have ever made. I used all of the ingredients, but did change the amounts of two. I used only about 1 1/2 tbsp. of sugar, and I think that was more than enough. If  made it again, I would omit the sugar all together. Also, I used a whole jalapeno instead of 1/3 of one. There was a lot of salsa there, and even with tripling the jalapeno there was very little heat. That may have been just the particular jalapeno I got, as they vary widely in hotness. A little olive oil would have been good, lime instead of lemon, maybe some pepper sauce, would all improve the complexity of the salsa. Thanks!
