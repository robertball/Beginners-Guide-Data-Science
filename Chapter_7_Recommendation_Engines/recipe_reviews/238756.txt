I made the cupcake part of this recipe, but I used a different frosting. I didn't have the ingredients to make the frosting. But, I made a Lemon Buttercream frosting instead. I made these for my daughter's birthday, as carrot cake cupcakes are her favorite cupcake. As far as the cupcakes themselves go in this recipe, my hubby & I thought that they were just ok. We didn't think they were anything spectacular. But, once I added the lemon flavored frosting to them, that took the cupcakes from ok to really good. We had NONE leftover from her birthday party, because everyone took multiple cupcakes home. I would recommend this recipe, if a lemon flavored frosting is used. Unfortunately, I can't recommend this particular frosting as I couldn't make it. I do plan on trying it though, so don't let my review discourage you from trying the frosting in this recipe.

These should be called the disappearing cupcakes.  I wouldn't think that lemon goes with carrot, but man does it! Made them for Easter, and everyone loved them. The only thing I would change is to maybe use grated (fine) carrots instead of shreds. Also, cut down the baking soda - some of my shreds turned green.
