WOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOO!  This was terrific.  The taste is unique, and a refreshing change to typical food combinations like apple crisp, more like a strawberry-rhubarb cobbler than anything else.  Our family loved it.  With respect to the "goopyness", I ended up being able to cook it a little longer and evaporate a little more of the moisture out of it, which produced a "saucier" dish.  The factors contributing to this were 1)I used a larger dish so it lost more moisture from the surface and 2) I think my oven cooks a little cooler than it should.  MAKE THIS DISH, you'll love it.  PS. It works even without the cloves, I added a bit of cinnamon instead.

Bananas make this too sweet. I substituted one tart apple and also used fresh pears. Squeeze the juice of the orange over the fruit, and it won't be too runny.

This had an amazing taste to it. It did get a bit gloopy and runny so maybe next time I will put in a splash less orange juice. I did use dried cranberries instead of fresh as fresh cranberries are not available here.

This was amazing! It took me four bananas. I used a 9x9 pan. I will use a little less OJ next time. I used three fresh (small)pears. I will also make using strawberries and peaches along with the other fruit next time.

This is excellent! A perfect blend of flavors.  I used two very ripe large pears instead of canned as we needed to use them up, frozen cranberries and whole wheat flour instead of white all-purpose.  I also doubled the topping as we are topping fans. May try some cinnamon next time too. Super good. An easy one for young children to help out with.  Mine loved slicing up the bananas. We will definitely make again soon! Thanks Shannon for the easy and tasty recipe!

Good stuff! Didn't have plain oatmeal so used cinnamon spice, added some chopped pecans to the topping. Also added an apple because I had it on hand. A keeper!

Loved it- I added blueberries and it was mildly sweet instead of sweet like pie.  Might make it again this week!

This recipe was surprisingly good.  The combination of fruits seemed a little odd, but it turned out delicious.  I followed the recipe as written except substituting 2 fresh pears for the canned ones, and substituting the second 1/8 tsp of cloves with cinnamon instead.  The end product still tasted of cloves, and I think if I had used cloves the second time it would have been too strong for my liking.  I used fresh squeezed juice from one orange for the orange juice.  My kids were looking for the leftovers this morning, but their dad had already taken them to work:)

Used about 2C of chopped fresh pears, honey instead of white sugar on fruit, and a little less than 1/4C OJ.  The topping took a little longer in the oven to brown up for me.  Really great flavor.

I made this tonight to use up a lot of pears and bananas I had going bad. I don't actually like pears, bananas or cranberries so I didn't expect to like this too much myself....but I LOVED IT. I used a bit more fruit than called for and thought I should compensate by adding a bit more orange juice - I was wrong. I ended up with more fluid than I wanted but it was otherwise delicious, I did leave out the clove and add cinnamon instead.

I ended up changing things a lot to accommodate using up all my sour grapes; I only made this to get rid of them.  

 For the fruits: 
4 cups of grapes (halved) / 
4 cups of sliced banana / 
1/4 cup of lime juice  / 
1/4 cup of white sugar / 
1/2 cup brown sugar / 
1/8 tsp salt / 
1/8 tsp cinnamon / 

For the topping:
1/4 cup of brown sugar / 
1/4 tsp cinnamon / 
1.5 cups all-purpose flour (tripled original) / 
1.5 cups rolled oats (tripled original) / 
6 tablespoons butter (doubled original) / 
1/2 tsp grated lime zest.  

 The fruits ended up being a lot, so I used a 2QT pan. Ended up needing to be in the oven for about 20min (and even then the top wasn't that brown yet- I think I made the topping too thick) and then I left it in there while cooking dinner. 

 It came out a tad runny due to the juice from all the grapes, but mostly delicious. I think double the topping might be better for this amount of fruits (bc triple made the topping a bit thicker and needed longer cooking time), but I'm happy with how it turned out. If I were to do it again, probably do maybe 8 or 9 tablespoons of butter instead, to make the topping a bit richer, but I was trying to go for healthier since there was already so much sugar in this.
