WOW!  Having never tried bison, I was very excited to prepare this recipe.  A little prep work, then it cooks in the slow cooker all day?  Sold!  The flavor was mild, and the ribs were extremely tender.  Ginger was left off of the ingredient list, so I added 2 tsp of freshly grated ginger, and I wish I had added more.  The vegetables were wonderful too, and next time I'll add more carrots.  My family devoured this meal, and it will be perfect for company.  I'll definitely make it again!  Bison is very lean, and very good.  Thanks for such a terrific recipe.

Loved it! The meat were falling off the bones when it was done! I added some red baby potatoes and it turned out great! Will definitely make it again!

We enjoyed this, but I think it would have been better with a more flavorful seasoning mix in with the flour.  That being said, very impressed with the bison itself!  Lean, tender, and flavorful.  I'll definitely be trying out more recipes with it in the future!

I used boneless beef short ribs, not bison, however I really enjoyed this recipe. It's my first time officially "braising". My only other differences were that I used chicken broth, and for the rice, I boiled it in chicken broth and some butter. I served it with asparagus and butternut squash as well.

Made it 2 times now. Having a good size family made a double batch using Angus beef Short Ribs. My entire family including picky eaters enjoyed them. Fell off the bone good.

I agree with Sunnydaysnora that it lacked in seasoning. The meat did fall off the bone but it should after that long in a slow cooker. I wouldn’t go so far as to say I didn’t enjoy it but I was looking for more with respect to flavour. Even the sauce was a bit simplistic.  I think some other ingredients could have made a difference but I’m not sure what they would be.  I don’t want to fall no a sauce that I just pour over the ribs but I will keep looking.
