I omitted the meat and used frozen mango chunks and this was a great recipe! I also served it with the Brazilian rice (you saute the rice with onion and garlic before cooking it) and a spinach, cilantro, pineapple salad and it made a delicious meal.

My husband and I absolutely LOVE this recipe.  I have made it for my cooking group, too, and froze the stew in 6 cup batches, and it turns out beautifully.  You can just pop the frozen stew into your crockpot and lunch/dinner is ready in a few hours.  The colors of this stew are also amazing.  I like to use one can of petite diced tomatoes and one can of diced tomatoes with green chilies instead of the hot green chili pepper.  It just saves me from having to dice a spicy pepper myself.

This a absolutely and BY FAR the most delicious stew I've ever made. I thought initially that my family wouldn't like it because, well, mango + beans + ham + cilantro? But I got compliments all around for the absolute amazing flavor! This collection of tastes are fantastic, I couldn't believe it. Now I am throwing a little dinner party JUST so I can serve this and soak up all the compliments! SO easy to make too.

This was super yummy and easy to make. The only thing missing is seasoning. When I first tasted it, I panicked because it was bland, but as soon as I added some paprika, pepper and cumin, it really brought out the flavors and was fantastic! This is definitely a keeper.

This was excellent. I used Italian sausage for the meat, but think this would be just as good vegetarian, or perhaps with chicken broth instead of water. I also added cumin to give it a bit of a flavor kick. I also used 3 mangoes instead of one. I'll be making this again!

great recipe! I'm not a sweet potato fan, but my husband is. didn't really matter because all the flavors blended so well I couldn't tell I used a sweet potato. I didn't use meat substituted broth for water & added cumin, pepper & more garlic & doubled the mango. I think next time I'd reduce the liquid to 1 cup. definitely a keeper recipe!

Amazing!  This is the fourth or fifth time I have made this stew and it never fails to impress.  Used sweet italian sausage this time instead of the chorizo (pregnant dinner guest with heartburn) and it was still wonderful.  

Only thing I can't understand is how someone didn't love this recipe!

This has to be one of my most favorite dishes!  I love the unusual mix of textures and flavors.  I added some butternut squash and used andioulle sausage instead of the chorizo.  I think it would also taste really good with a smoked sausage if you need a more mild soup for a family with young children.  We have to serve Gluten-free meals and this is a keeper (make sure your choice of sausage is GF)!

I have made this a couple of times and I am finally getting it where I want it to be. By the books this recipe is very very bland. The texture is fantastic, but the lack of flavor makes this meal seem only halfway there. The problem is that you need to add flavor without upsetting the balance of texture. I have decreased the water to 3/4 cup, upped the garlic, added cumin, added black pepper. This has resulted in a recipe that tastes as good as it looks.

This was quite tasty. My hubby and I do not eat pork, so I substituted a raw chicken chorizo sausage which I browned before I did anything else. I also used the large 28oz can of tomatos rather than the 14oz. The cilantro is a must for this recipe in my opinion, as it really ties the flavors together. I imagine that the left overs will be even better than the first night.

The note I added for my info was that I went lighter on the meat portion.  Low fat is better.  Also, I added a diced eggplant for more moisture and fiber.

This is an AWESOME recipe.  My husband not only downed several bowls of this, he took all the leftovers to share with his fellow graduate students the next day!  One of the students lived in Brazil for two years and said this tasted just like something he would have eaten there.  Since then I've had more than a few requests for the recipe :)  I followed the recipe as written, using a tad bit more ham and chorizo than called for so I wouldn't have leftovers.  I also used frozen mango added during the last ten minutes of cooking since my fresh ones were unripe.  If you're tempted to skip the fresh cilantro or the chile pepper, don't!  The cilantro pairs beautifully with the mango to give what would be a hearty, traditional stew, a very fresh, lighter, sweeter flavor.  The Chile adds just the right amount of heat without detracting from the other flavors.  Will definitely be making this again.

This recipe was absolutely delcious..I don't even like Sweet Potato's.. My husband wants  me to add a little whole kernal corn to it the next time..    This one is a KEEPER..

This recipe was excellent!  I made a modified version with the following substitutions:  1.  Omitted ham and chorizo, used 2 links of smoked turkey sausage.  2.  Subbed a 15 oz. can of pumpkin for the sweet potato 3.  Used a large can of diced tomatoes and a small can of diced chiles. 4.  Used stock instead of water. 5.  Added paprika, cumin, and black pepper. 6.  Garnished with lime.  While I agree with a previous reviewer that it needed more spice, I suspect that had I used the chorizo from the original recipe, I probably wouldn't have felt that way.    If you're expecting to have leftovers, I would not add the cilantro to the pot of chili, but rather would use it as a garnish (with lime... yum!).  That way, when you reheat the leftovers, you still get that fresh cilantro taste.    As good as this was, I think next time I will be adding the chorizo and ham in, though maybe in lesser quantities.  As good as this is, I can see how the spice from the chorizo and the smokiness from the ham would really give this dish much more depth and complexity.  If you're avoiding these ingredients to make the dish "healthier," I think you'll still find it very satisfying, but adding it a small amount of the meats is worth it to take this dish from GREAT to WOW.    This pot is going to be my lunch at work for the week.  Thinking I'm going to make a pot of brown rice to serve it over.  Delicious!  This one's a keeper!!

This surprised me as I do not tend to like sweet potatoes or black beans. I made this for a class project for my Brazilian Portuguese class and it was a hit! (even with the native Brazilians there for our oral conversation exam)

I am always looking for new and different.  This recipe was totally awesome.  I even made it for our end of the season tailgate and it was a huge hit.  I've shared this recipe with many people.  You must TRY IT . . . you won't be disappointed.

I have made this stew twice and it is delicious!  I omitted the ham and used al fresco chipotle chorizo with mango and adobo.  The second time around, I also took some shortcuts, using frozen mango and a frozen southwestern vegetable mix which took care of the onion, beans, and pepper and rotel's diced tomatoes with lime and cilantro.   Easy and yum!

Delicious.  All the flavors I love. My husband actually found this recipe and made it for dinner tonight. I was so impressed. We will be making this again and again. He couldn't find chorizo, so he used light Jimmy Dean sausage & it turned out fine. I would like to try it with chorizo, too.

Love this recipe, and so did my husband. I ditched the ham and used an entire 12 oz package of vegan soy chorizo, plus I only used 2 tsp of oil. Thanks to another reviewer, I tried frozen mango chunks, and that worked nicely. Will definitely make this again.

I made this for a recipe group of 6 women who have met for over 9 years.  It was a hit.  I thought the taste was so unusual and so wonderful I will cook this often.  My husband was not crazy about it for the lack of meat so I will add more meat to his portion.  One of the best recipes ever.

Loved this one.  Used a 10 oz bag of frozen mango, thawed, omitted the ham, and used some Italian sausage I had on hand instead of the chorizo, and it worked great- very adaptable.  I think chicken would also work well in this recipe if that's all you have.  I strongly recommend saving the effort of dealing with fresh mango as the frozen worked quite well.  I'll make this recipe again!

I made this for dinner (and dinners all week!) last night, and I couldn't think of a reason to rate it less than five stars. Here are some things I did a tiny bit differently:

-A tiny bit of EVOO (instead of Canola)
-I bought Habanero and Green chile turkey sausage
-Did not use ham
-Used fresh roma tomatoes from a friend's garden, instead of canned (tried to reserve as much juice as possible)
-Added a diced, seeded habanero and red chile pepper (it actually didn't end up too spicy, although my nose was running a bit!)

The stew was so yummy, and so colorful and pretty to look at! I noticed someone had trouble with the sweet potatoes softening fast enough -- just make sure you dice everything in small, bite-sized pieces and you won't have a problem with that.

This was SO GOOD. One of the all-time best recipes I've made from this site.

Oh my!  This was such a wonderful combination of flavors.  We absolutely loved this.  My husband said "this is so good" about 10 times while eating it and he rarely comments on food.  I would suggest adding one extra mango.  We did and it really even could have worked with 3.  My only slight complaint was that the prep time (chopping) is long and that the sweet potatoes take much longer than stated to cook until soft.  The recipe says it takes 15 minutes to soften the sweet potatoes but it took us over 30 minutes.  Still, it was well worth the wait.  We will make this again and again!

This is a seriously surprisingly fantastic recipe. It was actually bursting with layered flavor which is something my family loves! I made my own chorizo for this recipe, which also added flavor and texture, and I served it over basmati rice. The ONLY change I would make is to add more mango.

I made this without meant and it was so delicious!  I had a ton of sweet potatoes left over from Thanksgiving and thought this looked interesting and it was suprisingly much better than I thought it was going to be.  Now a staple dish.

When I make this recipe my and tell my friends about it, they think it seems like an odd combination of ingredients/flavors.  Then I bring them some to try.  Everyone I've made it for, loves it!  It's one of my favorite things to make in the winter months and I'm really glad I stumbled upon it here looking for more creative things to make with black beans.

This stew has a great taste and wow'd everyone that tried it.  My one knocking point is that it didn't have much of a kick.  I added some Cumin, Tabasco, and Paprika and that did just the trick.

I used chicken andouille sausage instead of chorizo and omitted the ham. The flavors in this stew are great!

Loved it! Though I made some adjustments. I had one can of diced tomato on hand so I used less liquid. Used a bit of water and one can of chicken broth. Skipped the mango and cilantro. With these moderations I felt there was a bit too much liquid so next time I will use two cans of diced tomato (love tomato) and will drain one of the liquid. skip the water and use half a can of chicken broth. I felt the stew was more soupy than "stewy". It was like a chunky stew. Otherwise I will definitely ABSOLUTELY make this again. Oh and I will use beef next time see how that turns out. Thanks for a wonderful recipe that you can make anyway you choose really.

Great dish. For large gatherings, I make two batches simultaneously, one with more meat, the other without any. Vegetarians and kids who don't like anything spicy are happy with one, meat and spice lovers the other. Cut up everything in advance, buy some bread, make some lemonade, and you're at the table stress free in no time.

Great recipe. Found it during an ingredient search of this site. Scaled it to 3 servings. Used Italian turkey/chicken sausage, leftover ham slices, chunks of yellow, red and orange peppers equivalent to a single bell pepper. Added another small chile pepper, another chopped garlic clove and about 1/2 can of rinsed red kidney beans. Took off heat and sprinkled with the juice of 1/2 lime just before serving. Added additional cilantro. Served this with warm tortillas and fresh fruit. I will be doing this one again, whenever I can get mangoes (difficult to get in rural Saskatchewan!)

I have never used chorizo before but I have been seeing it in a lot of recipes recently - time to give it a try! I was able to find an authentic looking hispanic brand.  These sausages were in thick casings with metal clasps on each end. The normal grocery store brand looked nothing like this.  I sauteed the sausage meat with the diced ham without adding additional oil, though it did seem like it needed a few teaspoons.  By the time I added in the potatoes, veggies and beans, the sausage seemed to totally evaporate, leaving only the spices.  Without those spices (similiar to the canned adobo sauce with the chipotle peppers), this stew would have been very bland.  You could definitely leave out the ham, as I could not taste it at all, but if you leave out the chorizo, you will be throwing in some additional flavorings.  My health conscious husband loved this as it was loaded with veggies, and light on the meat.

I've been using allrecipes.com for years and this is the first review I have ever written.  I thought this stew was absolutely DELICIOUS.  I omitted the ham and replaced the chorizo with soyrizo to make it vegetarian.  I also added a little cumin and upped the green chile pepper because I like my food spicy.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly and thought this was amazing.  It's not for everyone (my sister doesn't like sweet mixed with savory), but if the ingredients sound like something you'd be interested in, definitely give it a try!  So good!

This stew was excellent. My roomates are veg so I added soy chorizo instead of meat... it was excellent. I had to add in another can of diced tomatoes because I think my sweet potatoes were a little over a pound. I also needed to let the stew simmer for an extra 15 minutes to make sure the veggies were cooked all the way. Excellent recipe, I can't wait to make it again.

So yummy! Made it without the meat and it was still very hearty. Had to cook it for about 30 minutes to get the sweet potatoes done.

I thought this tasted very good. I wish i could give it a 4.5, since it tasted great at the end.  I gave it a 4, because I pretty much followed the recipe (minus the meat, since we don't like to eat too much meat in this house, and the review says it can be made w/o meat and still taste good).  When it was done, it had some good base taste, but was really really really needing spices.    Usually if I have to just add a few extra spices, I give it a 5.  But this time, I felt like I had to take a lot more time adding more, to make it taste really good.  OK, what I did:  I used some chicken broth instead of water (i had some leftover broth lying in the fridge).  I added extra fresh garlic.  I put in extra chili pepper.  I put in extra mango & cilantro.  I had to add extra salt & pepper, garlic powder.  I added some lemon juice and cumin.  I really felt it needed all of the extra spices.  But the end product, after all these additions, was a very yummy & healthy dinner.  I used fresh made black beans.  And I served it on top of cooked barley.  I will definitely do this recipe again.

I was hoping for a taste sensation when I made this, but it needs a little work in the flavour department. I bumped up the salt, I added some more heat in the form of tabasco, and I also added some cumin. It is a very eye catching dish, but as written a little on the bland side.

10 Stars!! Beautiful and Yummy!! I followed the recipe very closely - used 2 cans of Mexican tomatoes (diced tomatoes with diced jalapenos)in place of tomatoes and green chile peppers separate.  I also doubled the mango, and so glad I did.  Yes, this could be great vegetarian, but the few bites I had with the ham were even more delicious - I'll double the ham next time.  I used ground chorizo and can't imagine making any substitutions like some others have (bought it at Kroger and have bought it at Walmart before, as well). If you use the chorizo,there is no need for chicken broth, there is enough flavor and spice in the chorizo and water is fine. If you have any doubts about this recipe, don't - it's sooo good!

Yum!  It's been pretty hot where I am so I was hesitant to try this out thinking it would be better suited for winter.  I was wrong.  Served        luke warm it was suprisingly refreshing.  Hubby loved it, too.  Followed recipe almost exactly but took lid off pot early cause I wanted less liquid than what I was seeing.  Made some simple cheese quesadillas on the side and for dipping, too.

I really loved this stew. It was easy to make, and if you substitute regular pork for the ham/sausage it's actually very affordable. The recipe does lack spices though, so I added a mixture of black pepper, paprika and allspice. I will be making this again soon!

I made my first batch for the fire line during fire season.  The firemen ate every drop; there just was not enough.  I then made this at a family reunion camping trip.  I used a big canning pot; enough for 26 people.  There was no left overs everyone from the oldest to the youngest grandchild ate every bite.

Delicious and different.  I think people who called this bland may have used a can of diced tomatoes with mild green chile peppers instead of a can of tomatoes with hot green chile peppers.  I didn't think any extra spices were necessary.  But then again, I didn't try to replace the chorizo with anything--and chorizo has some wonderful spices in it.  I think the amount of mango in the recipe should be increased if your mangoes are not super sweet.  I used three semi-sweet-tasting mangoes, and I could have used more.

I added cumin (1 tsp) to the recipe and 2 tsp of sea salt.  Without the extra spice I feel it lacks a little flavor.  With the extra spices it's dynamite!

This is a gorgeous stew!! We have small children, so I omitted the pepper, but my husband and I added sriracha to ours and agreed that it needed the heat.

I loved this.  It was so simple to make but had tons of different flavors.  It was a great escape from my usual chili.

I probably should not review this stew, since I made a lot of changes.  However my husband loved it and I wanted to thank CRVGRL for the inspiration of this dish.  

I was looking for a pantry meal, a way to use up what I already had on hand so here are my changes:
I used smoked sausage instead of chorizo or ham. Acorn squash (instead of sweet potatoes) + one russet potato.  1 can dice tomatoes + 1/2 rotel (tomatoes w/ chiles). 1 can black bean (I would have like two cans if I had them on hand) Omitted  the water, to keep stew thick.  And left out the mango, since I didn't have anyone on hand either.  Add Lots of cilantro.  

Still turned out DELICIOUS.  I will try to make the recipe as written and revise my review at a later date.

This was interesting, but I didn't love it the way I thought I would.  It is healthy (I did not add the meat and cut down on the oil.)  Maybe it just really needed the meat to give it more flavour.  Not popular with my family either.  Perfectly ok soup but didn't wow me and I wouldn't make again.

This was outstanding! The flavor of the sauce it makes is awesome.  I had a big bag of frozen sweet potato fries I needed to use up.  I made the following substitutions: chicken broth and sherry instead of water, ham & bacon for the meats, a can of ranch beans instead of black (this gave it the little zing that some reviewers missed), I did not use the chili pepper, I simmered it for over an hour. Delicious.

I wanted something with black beans, and this caught my eye. My 1 year old loved it! My 3 year old loved the liquid and beans, but wouldn't touch the vegies. Got to love kids.  I used chicken stock instead of water. No ham, chicken chorizo, and frozen mango.  I loved it, thank you.

Hmmm - at first, I thought - its good but .. hmmm ... being all critical and wotnot. Are you kidding me? This is sooooo delicious. I was thinking it was the weirdest concoction of ingredients ever. But it is soooo good. I have given 5 stars - have rated a few things on allrecipes but don't know if I've ever given 5 stars. Not to be missed!

This is a great stew!  It is one of my husbands favourites.  We tend to double up on the chorizo sausage and leave out the ham, it makes the dish a bit spicer... just the way we like it!  We all tend to add more tabasco sauce that suggested.

I am intrigued by unusual food combinations so I was eager to try out this stew.  I found identical recipe in my Vegetarian Times cookbook except that it obviously omitted the chorizo.  I made the recipe using vegetarian chorizo and it came out great, but the chorizo was not noticeable and I will just omit it next time.  Since I like my stews more chunky than soupy I took the suggestion of some earlier reviewers and used only one cup of water.  I also misread ingredients and thought it called for one pound sweet potatoes TOTAL rather than two sweet potatoes of one pound each.  I used a one-pound yam, thought the balance was fine and indeed, I would not want more sweet potatoes than that in the mix.  Having said that, I ended up with about seven servings at 1½ cups per, so if you use two pounds of sweet potatoes you will either end up with more than six servings or six very large servings!

This dish was flavorful, pretty, hearty and almost exotic!  I loved it!  Just a few pointers:  Make sure you don't use Mexican chorizo that falls apart (I've made this mistake before, you are better off using this kind in scrambled eggs).  I used Portuguese linguica and this kind of chorizo added such a wonderful, slightly smoky flavor-a flavor I've never really tasted before.  I accidentally opened a can of red kidney beans (I just glanced at it when I took it out of the pantry!) but it was still good and made the stew a bit heartier.  I made sure to dice the sweet potato even though this was the laborous part of the process, there really is no way around it but don't leave it out.  I used one mango, next time I might use two.  I really couldn't taste the mango the next day.  Finally, I added about 1/2 a cup of finely chopped cilantro and it quickly brightened up the stew, however the brightness only lasts the day you eat the stew.  This is a wonderful recipe and I'll be experimenting with Spanish chorizo next time.

Wow!!  This was awesome, and super easy to make.  I left out the meats because they are not readily available where we live, and only used 1 can of black beans.  I also used grilled (over the gas burner) green chilies, and frozen mango because that is all I had.  VERY good.  Even better as leftovers over the next few days.  I was worried that the mango would get all mushy after sitting in the fridge, but it hasn't affected the taste at all.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I followed almost everything exactly except I used a beef sausage and omitted the ham as we don't eat pork. It was delicious - but next time I think I will make it without any meat at all, it is hearty enough without it and the flavour is tasty enough to pull off a vegetarian dish. I might suggest a little more garlic and mango though.

I was a little apprehensive about this one (especially the mango part), but I LOVED it. The only change I made was using a pound of Hot Italian sausage instead of the chorizo, as I'm not a fan. It was so easy to make and tasted fabulous!! I paired it with cornbread made with vanilla soy milk and it was perfect!!

We omitted the meat and I think it really would have been better with it.  If you do omit the meat, though, it needs some spicing up.  I see that another reviewer added some pepper and cumin-- that would have helped for sure.  We used two mangos and more cilantro.  Next time we might even use another mango-- the mango bites are the real treat!

Even though I never heard of anything like this when I was in Brazil, this stew is to die for! It's hearty, meaty, and flavorful, and I absolutely love the low burn from the chile pepper that warms you from the inside out. Highly recommended!

Seriouly people, soy or chicken chorizo? You have hit the WRONG recipe my friend! Do not... Repeat... Do NOT omit the chorizo or ham from this recipe. This is where the flavor is! There are plenty of recipes from the "Moosewood Lodge Vegetarian" cookbook that will please. Just don't mess with this sweet baby. 
If your sorry mangoes (ahem, southern US) are all you have, simply double the hard mangoes and stew with the sweet potatoes.

I was so looking forward to this stew but in the end it is bland and surprisingly lacks flavor.  Kick up the spices (garlic, cumin, chili powder, S/P) on this one and add a little acid such as a squeeze of lime juice.

I made a vegetarian version and it was delicious!  My substitutions: pinto instead of black beans; frozen instead of fresh mangos; and fresh tomatoes instead of canned.  I also added chili powder.  You get a lot less calories without the meat and it tastes great.

OUTSTANDING DISH!!! As a vegan, I left out the Ham and chorizo and used meatless chorizo (soy-based) from Whole Foods, and used coconut oil instead of canola. This is a keeper!!!! Was wonderful on a chilly 30 degree night like tonight...served with crusty garlic bread...To die for!!!! Thank you for this outstanding dish. Will be saved in perpetuity in my recipe box!

Followed the advice of others and added frozen mango when no fresh mangoes were available.  The mango was very good with it, we were glad we added the whole bag.  We used 10 oz. of soy chorizo, ommitted the ham, and replaced the chilie with a small can of green chilies.  It was a bit on the spicy side for us with these changes, but we prefer mild food, so others may like it that way.  We'll definitely be making this again, and will be sure to try it with ham next time.  This also made far more than six servings for us-we had to switch everything to a big stock pot partway through, but we had a large sweet potato, so that probably changed the portions.

I used Mexican chorizo... and it was spicy!!! So be careful of the type of chorizo you use. While this was really tasty, it overpowered the stew. I also forgot the cilantro which would have been amazing. :( 

This is a fabulous recipe and I can't wait to make it again!!!!!

Fantastic! This seems like an odd combination of ingredients, but you must try it!! The only changes I made were to use veggie broth instead of water, frozen mango, added a tsp of roasted cumin and some fresh ground pepper.

Very tasty stew! I was looking for something different using our leftover Easter ham, and this fit the bill perfectly. These are the changes I made: I had no sausage so doubled the ham. Only had 1 sweet potato. Used jarred jalapenos. Added pre-boiled diced turnips (about 3 small). The biggest change was to substitute fresh lemon thyme for the cilantro (which, alas, I did not have). Soooo good! I cannot wait to make this again with the correct ingredients. Thanks for the post.

Looooove it!  I used red pepper flakes instead of a hot pepper, and only 1 can of tomatoes because my husband doesn't like his food too acidic.  I also skipped the ham, but added smoked turkey neck bones instead for flavor.  I think the smokiness is key - I would used a touch of smoke flavoring if I wasn't using a smoked meat.  I cheated on the onions and green peppers and just used frozen ones, but I don't think it took significant flavor away.  I tasted the stew for flavoring and it didn't need salt, so I skipped it.

Very good, but I agree with other reviews that it  does need more seasoning. I also agree it needed more mangoes as well. I cooked this in a slow cooker and served it over plain couscous with a salad of greens topped with blueberries, sliced strawberries, crumbled blue cheese, and poppy seed dressing to keep the fruit theme going. The presentation was fantastic. I will definitely keep this is my recipe box.

Was a great soup.  I made it vegan by not adding the chorizo and ham and using vegan broth.  Seemed like an odd mix with beans and mangoes, but it has a great tropical yet substantial taste.  I brought it to a south american party and everyone loved it and asked for the recipe.  I will put this in my regular rotation.

This was fantastic!  I love the fact of so many fresh ingredients.  I used turkey sausage links diced, because we don't eat pork.  And I did add some cumin, paprika, and some chili powder to spice it up.  Was wonderful!

This was incredible. I skipped the ham, used a Serrano pepper, 1/4 teaspoon of cumin and served it with fresh flour tortillas and pan fried cotija cheese. I crumbled a little cotija cheese into mine too. Can't wait to see what the leftovers taste like. I bet it will taste even better! Thanks for the recipe!

Completely, utterly, 100% delicious.  I used jarred mango, all my store had.  The fresh mangos were rock hard, take forever to ripen and are soft about 15 minutes before they rot.  Next time, I'll use frozen mango for a little better texture.  Why is it someone always feels the need to give a recipe 1 star for not being "authentic?"  I have no idea about the intracies of Brazilian cuisine, but don't miss out on this one.

Very similiar to a Vegetarian Times recipe, minus the meat...it was a tad too sweet for me with the sweet potatoes and mango, but the crowd I served it to enjoyed it immensely. Next time I may use beef broth instead of water to help make it more savory and use a smaller mango. Thank you CRVGRL for posting this recipe! I did take your suggestion to serve it with a spinach salad...the Bermuda Spinach Salad (on this site) minus the meat, yummy!

This recipe turns out great every time. We don't eat much meat so I just leave it out - still yummy. I use two mangoes, and always put hot sauce on the table for people that like extra flavor.

Easy to make.  Very tasty.  I have made it with and without the Mangos.  Both ways are very good.  I replaced the ham with bacon once and it was delicious.

a  good stew. make sure to use spanish chorizo, not mexican, or else it'll disintegrate. i used more meat and less beans, because that's what was available. added paprika, comino, and black pepper to taste. i also replaced the water with broth. this one was a winner; good for a cold night!

This has become quite the family favorite! It is so colorful and really qualifies as a healthy comfort food. Great for leftovers! My changes: Light turkey Italian sausage instead of chorizo, 2 lbs of sweet potatoes, 2 mangoes.

This was awesome (however...I made a few changes based on some of the other reviews and my own additions).  I used boneless ham (leftover from Christmas dinner) and polish kielbasa (cubed) I took 3 cans of drained black beans, 2 cans of rotel, 3 cups of water, grilled onions (chopped) garlic (from jar), big cubes (1-1.5 inches) of regular russet potatoes - uncooked but peeled) 2 cubes of chicken boullion (I had the kind mixed with tomatoes), and I cut up 1 mango into slices. After grilling onions...throw everything in a big pot and cook until potatos are DONE.  OUTSTANDING.  My kids loved it and it was so easy.

I made this recipe exactly as written and found all the flavors to go incredibly well together.  The only thing I would do differently next time is increase the cook time by simmering on low for an additional hour to give time for the flavors to meld a bit more.  Otherwise, you may find the reheated leftovers are actually better than the first serving. We will definitely make again, and again...and again!

This was very delicious!! I made a lot of little changes because of all the other comments which I'm glad I did! I did use chicken broth and I adde more than it called for. I also simmered it a bit longer. I really don't think the ham is needed. Next time I will try to balance out the sweetness of it by adding a bit more spice to it. I have a huge sweet tooth so nothing really is ever too sweet for me, but even I thought this was a bit sweet.

What a terrifically easy thing to throw together -- and it tastes like you've spent hours! Next time I might leave out the ham and double the chorizo, which really gives this a nice punch. I used a just-ripe mango. It was easy to peel and held together beautifully after cooking.  Just loved the sweet/hot contrast in this delicious stew.

This was really good, and I'm glad I tried it (it's a bit out of my comfort zone).  The only way it could be better would be with some seasonings; it was a little bland if you got a spoonful that didn't have a variety of things in it.  Unfortunately, I have no idea what seasonings would be good to add.

I was searching my cupboards for something to make without having to go to the store and typed in black beans and sweet potatoes into AR and this is what came up.  I didn't have Mangos but I did have Hot Mango Chutney so I went for it.

I ommitted the meat, sauteed the onions in EVOO.  Ommitted the hot pepper since I was serving this to my kids and knew I would be adding the spice at the end with the hot mango chutney. 

I thought it was very good.  I can't think of a healthier meal.

Great stew! I made it in the slow cooker, and it turned out great. I did use dried bean instead of canned, and I used vegetarian sausage, since I have vegetarian roommates, which was just fine. While it smelled amazing and tasted great, I did feel it was missing a little something, but couldn't quite put my finger on it (maybe it was the meat!)... I look forward to making it again and experimenting in the future!

I was looking for a way to use up some leftover ham and a mango that was getting ripe.  I love sweet potatoes, so this recipe looked very intriguing.  I have to agree that the flavor combination, while surprising, is quite good.  I omitted the sausage and used fewer black beans and more potato.  I also added some paprika and garlic powder.

Seriously one of the best dishes ever. I wasnt sure about the mango but it blended REALLY well and made the dish in the end (and I dont really even love mango!) We used Chicken Chorizzo and it came out magical. My sister made it with Soyrizo and the same results. This dish rocks, and the left overs are even better!

So good and so easy to make.  I left out the ham and just used extra chorizo turkey sausage because I don't like to cook with pork.  It was great the night of, and great to heat up as left overs for days afterwards.  I served with hot fresh bread the night of, but later we added leftover brown rice to it and that was extremely good.

Really Good!  (4 1/2 stars).  My wife was crazy about it and it was even better the second day as leftovers once the flavors settled.  Depending on your taste, I'd add a bit more chorizo next time and some hot sauce.  ps-this serving size will feed an army.

A very good substitute for traditional chili if you want something with a little ethnic flare.  I used Farmland type sausage, sliced, instead of chorizo, powdered garlic and dried cilantro instead of fresh, and fresh roma tomatoes instead of canned.  Wonderful and unusual.

I was very skeptical with the various ingredients that went into this recipe, but it was great! Thanks to another review, I used Soyrizo (12 oz) to reduce the fat and make it a true vegetarian dish. I love real chorizo, but it's so bad for you, so I tried healthier. I also used 3 cans of diced tomatoes and green chiles (10 ounces each), added some red pepper flakes for heat, a few shakes of cumin and served over white rice. For those of you using Italian sausage, chorizo is completely different and gives this stew a nice zing!

Fantastic recipe.  I used Italian sausage, but only half of what the recipe called for. I didn't have a hot pepper so I just used red pepper flakes, and it was lovely.  I think next time I'll go the vegetarian route, a little healthier.  Excellent flavour.

This was so delicious. Unfortunately, I had to omit the chorizo because I couldn't find it at the store, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. What a delicious combination of flavors. Thanks so much!

I followed this recipes as written. I was hoping for Brazilian feijoada and what I got was a bunch of sweet potatoes and mangoes; the black beans are an afterthought. There's sweet and spicy here, yet the two never seem to take a hold of of each other.

Excellent dish.  I made mine without the meat and added some GOYA "Refrito" (in the Mexican cooking aisle)and extra cilantro.  I served it with rice and chicken, sauteed with garlic and lime juice.  A beautiful meal with plenty of leftovers which my boyfriend ate twice a day until it was all gone.

This was spectacular.  I changed the recipe just a bit.  I used frozen mango, dropped the chili pepper and used 1 can mild Rotel and 1 can chopped tomatoes.  I also seasoned the stew with cumin and pepper.

This is in regular rotation at my house.  I found that adding some diced mango and fresh cilatro  into the individual bowls rather than mixing it in the stew gives a much better and more dramatic flavor contrast.   I also love how I can adjust the spiciness by changing either the type of sausage or using Rotel.

I made it without the meat.  I did brown Italian Sausage in a separate skillet for my husband to add to his stew.  He absolutely loved it.  Other than the meat, I followed the recipe exactly.  Will definitely make this again.  Very delicious.

Delicious and very different! I skipped the ham but will use turkey ham next time because the chorizo alone is too little for protein, although I used 2 chorizo. I also used 3 sweet potatoes and added an extra 2 cups of water.

I did a little variation of this, but it was super delicious--great combo of flavors. I used a slice or two of bacon and a diced chicken breast rather than the chorizo and ham. Added chili powder and chipotle chili flakes instead of the green chile (but used diced toms with chiles) to add a little flavor. Used frozen mango like others and that worked well. Increased the garlic and added a spoonful of better than bouillon (chicken). Very yummy and warming on a cold winter day!!

Really delicious.  Made without meat.  High school kids liked it very much.  I used frozen mango, canned chopped green chilis (mild) instead of chopping a chili pepper, added 1 can of vegetable stock in place of 15 oz of the water, and added cumin, chili powder, and a bit more salt. I quadrupled the recipe for a carnival and used 2 six quart stock pots to prepare.  To serve at the carnival, I kept the soup warm in 2 large crock pots.   It made about 100 servings and it was completely gone.  Thanks for a delicious recipe.

Holy cow I think this is my new favorite soup!  Great blend of flavors.  I make a few modifications only because of what I have (or rather, don't have).  I generally don't have ham so I just omit and double the sausage.  I also generally don't have a green chilly pepper so I just substitute 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper.  I know it's probably not quite the same flavor but it seems to work.  I use frozen mangoes also.

Loved it! I tend to be a bit generous with my garlic, and added a dash of cumin as well. Since I was low on ham, I added extra chorizo. Smells wonderful - my coworkers were jealous walking into the break-room when I brought it in for lunch.

This is not a recipe I would make again. It was beautiful to look at and ok tasting for one meal, but I ended up throwing the leftovers away. There was just too much sweetness with the mango and sweet potato and not enough complexity of flavors. It needs more spices and would also probably be better without the meat, which doesn't add much flavor and takes away from the freshness of all the veggies.

This was absolutely delicious!  For those who said it was bland when they left out the chorizo and ham, all I can say is DUH!  The chorizo and ham make this dish.  I purchased "Denmark Chorizo" from the butcher at Safeway. I was confused by the "chopped" chorizo, as chorizo tends to be a bulk sausage, so it's more like crumble instead of chopped. I browned it first and then added the ham.  I don't think you need a tablespoon of oil, as chorizo has a lot of fat in it. I just loved all the flavors in this dish, even though I was skeptical of the mango.  The sweet potatoes took much longer than 15 minutes to soften, but it was well worth the extra time.  I followed the recipe, but I used a Serrano pepper as the "small hot green chile." Next time, I will try the frozen mango as some reviewers suggested, as  peeling and cubing the mango was quite time consuming.  I did add some paprika and cumin, as some reviewers suggested, and I left out the salt at the end but added Mrs. Dash Southwest Chipotle seasoning instead.  This is definitely a keeper!

I did not use the canola oil, because the chorizo has enough fat.  Also, I added cumin and a lot of paprika, per another reviewer.  This is like a chili, perfect for this cold snap we're having.

Recipe was delicious. And I do not think there was a problem with the seasonings. The Key is to make sure you don't substitute another meat for the chorizo sausage as it is almost solely responsibly for the flavor of the stew. Salt and pepper to taste. I did add one 16oz can of chicken stock and only added enough water to make sure there was enough liquid to cook off as the stew thickened. I believe the chicken stock added a tad more flavor. other than that,loved it!

The photo of this recipe is what intrigued me.  I didn't have all of the ingredients on hand so I improvised.
 I adjusted the serving size to 4.
I used 1 can of black beans. I didn't have canned tomatoes on hand so I used a 10oz can of tom w/green chilis. I used one link of apple cinnamon chicken sausage and 2 links of spicy andouille chicken sausage. I had some mango in the freezer that I threw in the pot and I used 1 1/4 cups of water (didnt use broth)  
The mixture of the sweet potato with the mango and spicy as well as sweet sausage made my palate dance!
Thanks for sharing this recipe!

For full flavor, you must use chorizo and I used a little more; did not use the canola oil, just cooking spray and used some green bell with the red to add color and for the hot pepper used 1 serrano and a very small home-grown poblano that had some heat.  I also added a little more salt, black pepper to taste and about 3/4-1 tsp cumin and a spice blend called Magic Dust.  Noting another reviewer's comment, I also opted for frozen mango.  This is a very flavorful stew that I liked a lot!

This black bean stew is absolutely delicious. I was attracted to this recipe because of all the colourful fruit and veggies. The flavour is unbelievably fantastic!  Apart from the chorizo sausage, garlic and hot pepper, I put no seasonings in this stew, yet it had a very satisfying complex flavour.  It really didn't even need salt. The colour of the dish made it feel like a celebration!  Appearance is everything to me and this certainly didn't disappoint. My husband enjoyed this too. This recipe is a keeper!  Thanks for sharing this.

I loved this.  The only changes I made were to increase the chorizo to half a pound, used diced tomato with green chilies, and diced a jalapeno.  It turned out too spicy for the kids but we thought it was great!  Next time (and there will be a next time) I may increase both the chorizo and the ham.

Delicious, could possibly use more chorizo, it kind of gets lost but some great flavor combinations.  My son was a little intimidated by all the colors in the pot.  Overall, a hit.

I made this for my book club, and everyone loved it and wanted the recipe.  The only change I made was using bacon instead of cooked ham, only because I already had some leftover in my fridge.  This was so easy to make and so delicious with a hint of sweetness from the potatos.

It was really bland. I had to add, pepper, cumin, adobo, cayenne pepper, and more salt just bring out all the flavors of the ingredients. This recipe got alot of great reviews, however, Im part brazilian and part spanish, we prefer our dishes full of flavor and life!

I make this all the time, but I make it meatless. Meat is expensive when you are paying off law school :-) I use chicken broth instead of water to give it a bit more flavor. It's cheap, easy, and freezes well!

This was amazing!  Changes I made: slow cooked a pork roast with paprika, cayenne pepper, cumin, and apple cider vinegar.  Added the shredded pork and a little of the juices instead of the ham. The spices were perfect.  Also used 1 jar of mango salsa as a sub for 1 can of tomatoes and the mango.  Served on lime cilantro basmati rice.  Absolutely divine!

This was a very tasty and filling stew, but as written it is a bit bland.  I am a vegetarian so I left out the meat.  I had some veggie broth I needed to use up so I used that instead of water.  Adding 3/4 tsp. of cumin to this dish really turns it into a 5 star recipe.  I love how easy this is to put together and the fact that I can serve this on its own with a small side salad for a healthy lunch.  Thanks for sharing!

This made nearly 5 quarts and was quite satisfying.  I really like that it uses so many veggies and even fruit to boot!  I didn't use any salt since the sausage had plenty in it.  I usually use chicken broth in place of water, but I did not do that this time and it turned out so well.

This stew was fabulous! I served it to my child care and most of them ate it up. I did not use the chili pepper, I needed it to be mild. I used frozen mango, so the mango was a bit squishy which my husband didn't like. He also doesn't like canned tomatoes, so I used a can of pasta sauce instead. Will make it again.

This was wonderful.  I didn't have black beans or mangos, so I substituted using kidney beans and a small can of cubed peaches with no sugar.  It didn't seem to matter because the stew tasted absolutely fantastic!

Great recipe. I used diced tomatoes with chiles instead of using the chili pepper. I also topped with sour cream which really added flavor and omitted the cilantro.

Delicious! Skipped the ham and used extra chorizo (about 1/2 pound total). I'm not good at chopping, so I needed extra time for that, but once I got past that it was smooth sailing. Keeps pretty well as leftovers, too.

Great combination of flavors.  Even my picky eater ate it.  It looks great to just serve with the mango and then cilantro sprinkled on top.  I used turkey chorizo to cut the fat and didn't add any salt at the end.

this was really good food!!! i am so glad we have leftovers!!!! the only thing i changed was the meat. Instead of using sausage and ham i had pork rips and beef roast. I cooked everything in the slow cooker, added sweet potatos 20 min. before the end and mango, beans and cilantro 5 minutes before the meal was done.

This was excellent. I was trying to find a kosher version for Brazilian Black Bean Stew and had no success. I used chicken chorizo and turkey ham, and it was delicious.

Fresh, easy and nutritious. I replaced the chorizo with free range turkey sausage.

This was awesome. Loved it. I really had my doubts too. Used chicken broth instead of water and a ton of red beans (trying to get rid of them). It still tasted fabulous even without the meat.

I used authentic, fresh Mexican chorizo but had no mango, so used a nectarine instead. Let me tell you, this dish is sweet and spicy and delicious.  Everyone in the family liked it.  I didn't add any additional spice (just cilantro) not even the salt and it was perfect because of the highly spiced chorizo! I did simmer it another 15 min after adding bean to cook down the tomatoes. Try it!

Wow this was really really delicious! I used vegan chorizo sausage, omitted the ham and used frozen mango.  It was so good and filling - perfect for a chilly evening.  Thanks for this recipe!

A friend of mine made this for me the first time I tried it, it was great!  I've made it for many friends and family, and have never had anyone not love it!  I usually substitute chicken and turkey sausage instead of the meat in the recipe.  Also, I add any colored peppers, and usually two or three!  Looks great and tastes great!  Serve with brown rice for a real treat!

When I saw this recipe I thought to myself "I have to make this."  Not because I thought it sounded delicious or because it was the perfect recipe I was looking for but simply because the combination of ingredients seemed so strange.  I was definitely skeptical but trust me this recipe is fabulous!! It was even better the next day as leftovers for lunch.  I didn't use the ham just because I didn't have any but other than that for the most part I followed the recipe.  I highly recommend this recipe, don't let the mix of ingredients scare you off you will be pleasantly surprised.

great one!  had to change quite a few things, kidney beans instead of black beans, and herby sausages instead of chorizo. but turned out great!  really cheap way of cooking, made loads and will last for ages.   and great to ate when you have a cold!

I've tried this with and without meat and I think it is so much better without the ham and chorizo.  I added an extra can of black beans and used canned tomatoes with chilis already in them.  I usually hate cilantro, but I love it in this stew.  So easy to make and it has a wonderful and unusual flavor.

I left out the meat and added in another mango, as well as substituting the pepper for green onion. I was dubious about this going in, but I'd promised to try something new and exotic - and this was it! It looked and smelled amazing, with all the colors and veggies, but that was nothing compared to the taste. Soft and sweet, with a tiny bite every now and then. Even though I'm a vegetarian, I'm a sucker for sausage - I can only imagine how great this would be if made as is! My all time favorite stew. :)

I only once used the chourico,and I found the smokiness to be too much. If you make it meatless, you end up with a fresh-tasting, very hearty meal which (i think) is low in fat. I make it again and again. My rating reflects the meatless version.

I left out the meat and this was still great!  Next time, I'd probably add more mango and cilantro.  I agree with some others, it's a bit of chopping for a quick, weeknight dinner, but it makes a lot, and the results are worth it.  Great combination of flavors!

I don't know why I'm incapable of following a recipe...but, I still ended up with a really awesome creation. I actually did have mango but with the advice of my family who didn't want to eat sweet potato and mango together I decided to leave it out. I wish I hadn't, just to see how it would have tasted. I scaled the recipe for 4, omitted the ham and used beef sausage, and didn't add cilantro either because I didn't have any. I didn't use any oil...why would you cook sausage in oil? The sausage releases oil when it's cooking, enough to cook the onions in. If eating with rice(the best way to eat it) I would add another 1/3-1/2 a cup of water or so for more of a sauce to eat with the rice. Also make sure to add 1/2 ts of paprika, 1/4 ts chilli powder, and 1/4 a ts of black pepper. I didn't try it with the cumin, but I'll do it next time. Jalapeno is a fine substitute for the green chilli pepper if you're out. To thicken up the sauce and give it a really great mild sweet and sour flavor, I added a TB of ketchup. I love adding ketchup to beans cooked with spices because it gives them addicting taste. Oh, another note...unless you absolutely can't eat a meal without meat, I would suggest leaving all the meat out. The sausage didn't seem to add any flavor at all the stew and the flavor of the sweet potatoes and beans together were so hearty that the sausage was just overkill. And if you do happen to have a family of carnivores like mine, then add more sausage, as mine complained the

I made corn bread on the side. It tasted like chili with a twist.  It was too sweet for my boyfriend.  Next time, I'll add 2 hot chilis with the seeds and add the meat.  I like it hot!

Very good!  Left out the mango cause I didn't have one, but we didn't need it anyway.  This is what my husband and I consider soup though, not stew. Make a salad and you've got supper!

Oh wow.  Didn't have to alter it one bit and it came out amazing!  I can't believe how well all these flavors complemented each other! I made a lot and had left overs for 3 days afterwards, and every once got sick of it!  Would taste just as good vegetarian. :)

What an awesomely unique recipe!  I love all things mango, black bean, and veggie, and while my husband does not, I thought I'd be able to appease him by adding a little extra meat.  I used hot Italian turkey sausage because we don't eat pork, olive oil instead of canola and chicken broth instead of water.  I also added a teaspoon of cumin like another reviewer suggested and tomatoes with mild green chiles to spice it up a bit. I was also pretty liberal with the salt.  The result was delicious!  I had expected to love this and for my husband to eat it because it was there, not because he genuinely liked it.  He ate it with chips and actually scraped his bowl clean!  Thank you for the great recipe!!  This is a keeper! : )

Very colorful, great mix of flavors. Warning: prep time is way off.  Look at the list of things to be done.  Maybe someone who does this for a living could do all that in 15 minutes.  It took me almost an hour.

Would never have tried this recipe had it not been for all the wonderful reviews.  Everyone was right!  It is a definite keeper as well as being easy and economical to make.  I did not use the hot pepper as indicated, but instead used one can of diced tomato with chili peppers and a second can of Rotel.  I also used Sweet Italian Style Chicken Sausage which was low in fat and tasted delicious! Thanks for a GREAT recipe!!!

What a unique twist of flavors and ingredients. I am a vegetarian so I omitted the meat but cooked up the sausage separately so I could add some to my husband's dish. I also added celery to the list of ingredients and put one pablano pepper instead of the jalepeno pepper to decrease the spice level. 

This is a recipe that will be on my top 10 list! 

Thank you for submitting this!

This is absolutely the best stew/soup I have ever tasted.  I increased the linguica to 1/2 pund, and the ham to 1/2 pount.  I also used a large oni9on, 3 cloves of garlic and may increase to 2 mangoes next time. WOW!

This recipe was truly delicous. I added double the mango, but followed the rest of it as is.  Very colorful and tasty.  Used canned tomatoes with jalpenos for extra flavor and zip!

This was fabulous! I cannot say enough about how flavorful this is. It is a bit labor intensive, but well-worth it! I added liberal amounts of paprika, sea salt, and ground cumin to really amplify the tastes of all the ingredients. Pair this with a crusty baguette and a salad with a nice shiraz and you will please the whole crowd!

Rico!

I substituted olive oil and chicken apple sausage in my version - Not only is this a delicious and healthy dish, but it's also a beautiful colorful one.

Mmmm.. Tasty.. I used Tomatoes with Green Peppers (rather than tomatoes, and fresh green peppers).  Didn't add any salt or oil (it didn't need it).  Used soaked beans and  Andouille sausages (had no Chorizo).  The mango was SUPER!

This was excellent!  I followed previous reviewers suggestions and added extra mango and cilantro.  Unlike some reviewers I didn't think there was too much liquid - it was good for cooking the sweet potatoes, and I just simmered it a little longer to cook off the liquid. Finally, I replaced the chorizo and ham with about 3/4 pound of Italian sausage, which was just the right amount.

We absolutely loved this dish.  I've made it at the request of my family 3 times in two weeks.  Very easy and really amazing.  Didn't have ham so we used sausage yesterday and it came out really good.  Great recipe, thanks :)

This stew was perfect! It looked great and tasted great! I only used one sweet potato (it was really big) and cut the water down to 1C. I also used one can of regular diced tomatoes and one can of rotel. I topped mine with avocado (yum!) and my husband topped his with corn chips. We will definitely be making this again!

Wonderful stew. Very filling, very tasty. As a vegertarian, I omitted the ham and substituted the chorizio with "Soyrizo" a meatless soy chorizo. Simply wonderful! Served mine with a green salad and crusty bread.

This was fabulous!  I used a medium serrano pepper, and it wasn't nearly spicy enough.  I will go with a spicier pepper next time.  Also, it turned out too "soupy."  I will probably let it simmer uncovered next time.  I omitted the chorizo and just used ham.  It would be good without meat also.  I served it with a dollop of fat-free sour cream, and next time I think I will bake some cornbread to go with it.  This was truly fabulous though!  Try it, you'll love it.

This is ABSOLUTELY the BEST recipe I've ever tried from AllRecipes!!!  For lack of black beans, I used canned chickpeas 50-50 with black beans.  For lack of tomatoes, I used a jar of Barilla Rustica pasta sauce (my personal favorite mass-produced commercial pasta sauce).  I speak Spanish and Portuguese but couldn't find "chorizo" sausage at the grocery store, so I just used hot/spicy lean Italian turkey sausage and didn't bother with the ham.  AWESOME!!!

Easy to cook and delicious!  Even a non-cooking, single guy like myself could make it and enjoy it!

Had to substitute Bob Evan's Spicy sausage for the chorizo (grocery didn't have any...) but it was wonderful.

Really good!  I found some really good chorizo at the store and that came through. Left out the green chili pepper, so we could season to taste. Added more water to make it more of a thick soup. Served over rice.

My husband and I really enjoyed this. I left out the chorizo and used a 1/2lb of ham instead. Also had to turn up the heat to medium for about 30 minutes to get the sweet potatoes to cook through. Otherwise I followed the recipe as stated.

Liked it a lot.  I made two ingredient changes and substituted smoked sausage for the chorizo and omitted the spicy pepper because I didn't want anything spicy, just flavorful.  I also increased the meat by half.  I changed the process a little bit.  I sautéed each of the ingredients (except the cilantro and mango) and then added them to the crockpot.  I completely omitted the water then cooked it on high for four hours.  I don't think you need water for the crockpot because it cooks down differently than on the stovetop.  And I wanted a stew, some liquid but not as much as soup.  I added the mango and cilantro and gave it a few minutes and served.  It was delicious. I made a larger amount so I'm freezing a bunch.  Saved this recipe to make it again.  Very pleased.

I did not have ham but had most of the other ingredients so I used 1 lb of chorizo sausage and added a can of Rotel along with  2 cans of diced tomatoes. I also used frozen mango. My family loved it also. My 6 year old asked for a second serving. I plan to make it again using ham. I used a large skillet to make it in and it was close to spilling out the sides.

This is the most delicious stew.  The fire from the chili and the sweetness from the mango make a great combination.  The only thing that I changed and it was an accident is that I added a can of black eyed peas as I only had one can of black beans.  Made no difference in the taste to me and everyone that I fed.  I had to give  out the recipe about 10 times. I have to make more as it is so addicting.  Thank you for sharing

Oh WOW - Made this a couple of times now.  I love it. Add Butternut Squash with the Sweet Potato now.  The output is a bit larger and I adjust the rest of the ingredients accordingly.   Frozen Mangoes are easier to process.  I entered this in a 'Crock Pot Cook Off' - Got an Honorable Mention and the Dish Got a new nick name - "Sweet Jesus Stew". (Maybe I'll add a few more peppers if I enter this again)   The Crock Pot was empty when it was all over.  I'll be making this again as soon as we finish off the "Spicy Black Bean Soup" found on this site.

So this can most certainly be made in a crockpot as well. I threw all of the ingredients in a crock pot set on low for 8 hours and oooowee! I didn’t have any canned tomatoes on hand so I diced up three tomatoes and added water. I puréed a second mango to give the broth a sweet “Kapayow!” I also excluded the meat. You’re right, excluding the meat did not compromise any flavor at all. This is definitely a new house fav!

Made it just as described except being from New Orleans I used Tony Chachere's instead of salt. Amazing! A little spicy, a little sweet and so good on a cold night.  One of my favourites so far!

A big hit! I skipped the ham and used 1/2 lb. of the sausage instead. The mango was a lovely addition.

Love this stew with a few changes.  Eliminate chorizo, mango, and cilantro.  Use center-cut bacon instead of ham.  Add 3 leeks, 4 splashes of Worcestershire, 4 splashes of red wine, chicken broth, extra water, 2 tsp cumin, 3 tsp thyme, and juice from 1/2 of a lime.  It's nice and tangy.

I've made this stew with ham, sausage, beef, and vegetarian, and each time it is delicious! We hate cilantro in this house, so I have always omitted that ingredient and do not find the recipe lacking any flavour as a result. 
Bonus: You can pop the base ingredients in a crockpot for 4+ hours, adding the beans near the end and the mango just prior to serving, to make your meal prep easier for those busy days (or life with little kids)!

I made this, modified only slightly to fit what I had on hand, and I left out the ham (why have two porks?) and mango because they're tough to find in my area. I did kind of short cut things a little by using up some mashed sweet potato I had on hand, and I bumped up the spices a bit after reading the reviews. I cooked it to the "mostly done" point and then put it in the slow cooker to stew for three and a half hours on low, just cause I think dishes like this are better with a longer cook time, and I'm too lazy to babysit them on the stove. We haven't had it for dinner yet, but my tasting so far gives it a thumbs up. With cornbread and salad, dinner's done. I think it will be a hit with the hubby. Thanks!

This seemed a little bland, so:  I used 6 oz chorizo, added 3 cloves garlic, 1 tsp cumin, 1/4 tsp adobo chili powder to the onion & chorizo as I sautéed them.  Then added the sweet potatoes  & red bell pepper, one 14 oz can diced tomatoes, one 10 oz can tomatoes w/ green chiles and one 10 oz can water.  Simmered all for 20 minutes, added the beans, mango & cilantro and about 1 tsp salt.  My family loved it!

This is a great recipe base. It's a little bland, but I seasoned to taste using the other commenters' suggestions. Next time I also plan to add an additional mango because the flavor didn't come through as much as I had hoped. Otherwise love it, and will be making again.

I really have no idea how anyone could say this is bland. If that's the case, you did something wrong. So: 1) Use the full amount of chorizo and ham, though you can easily go up to 1/2 lb of each. The meats are a big part of what gives this dish its flavor. The recipe poster says you can leave out the meat, but you really can't. 2) I gave four stars because the recipe calls for a lot of water. Instead, use just 1 cup and make it beef broth. This deepens the flavor too, and means you should not add any salt. 3) Because some people said it was bland, I added a 1 cumin at the end, but I've made it without and it really isn't necessary. It is very good with cumin, and just as good without it, just in a different way. 4) I used one green Jalapeno pepper and it was  perfect. I dashed in some black pepper at the end, but again, it turned out it was not necessary. 5) Do not leave out the cilantro. It makes a huge difference too. Don't stir it in until you serve. When I make this for the week, I just toss in the cilantro after I've reheated my portion in the micro. 6) I used about 12 oz of frozen mango chunks, not thawed, thrown into the pot the last 10 minutes of cooking, along with the black beans. 

This is so good, and healthy with the yams, mangos, peppers, tomatoes and black beans. I've also stirred in 3 cups of baby spinach and they wilt down so you barely taste them but they add a ton of nutrition and the pretty green break up the colors in an attractive way. You can serve thi

This has become one of my favorite recipes.  So good and unusual.  Maybe that's because I'm not Brazilian.  Even my kid likes this one.  I've made with regular potatoes instead of sweet because that was all I had on hand and it was good, but not as good.  This recipe is perfect as written.  I will make over and over.

I made this because I was looking for a way to use up sweet potatoes I had before they started to go bad. The result was SO good I will absolutely make it again. Differently I am sure, as I start with a good thing and alter according to ingredients I have on hand.  My changes were coconut oil not canola, NO ham (none handy), doubled the garlic,  chicken broth instead of water, Rotel tomatoes for the diced, chipotle tabasco for the chile pepper, 1 can Bush black beans and 1 can Bush black beans in chile sauce, and a bag of frozen mango. I also added 1 can Mexican corn, chile powder, cumin, paprika, black pepper and Garlic Chipotle Lime Rub from garlicfestival.com. Super delicious and chock full of healthy ingredients. Although I altered so much I have to say thank you to CRVGRL for the fantastic starting point.

I LOVE this recipe! I don't care for chorizo so I switch it out for sweet Italian sausage. I add an extra can of beans and top it all off with some Tapatio. It's great served with corn bread.

Everyone loved this. I followed the reviewers' recommendations and added cumin, garlic powder, black pepper, lots more minced fresh Chile peppers, and used chicken broth rather than water. I  reduced the amount of broth/water and more than doubled everything else. I didn't have fresh mangoes, so substituted chopped peeled peaches. My crowd of hungry friends included a spice wimp and a cilantro hater, so I served the cilantro on the side to be added at the table, and also passed around a small bowl of extra minced chile peppers. It makes great - and filling - leftovers for work lunches. I look forward to making this again.

Followed recipe exactly.  LOVED IT!    Slightly sweet, definitely spicy.  I'll add 3/4 tsp. salt next time.

Love this recipe! I have made it several times and used chicken chorizo to cut down on fat! I add some paprika, chicken broth instead of water and cumin and black pepper too! Delicious!

Awesome stew! Best on the next day. Swapped water for chicken stock, added 2 tsps. of cumin, (a must!) and 1 tsp. of smoked paprika...One tbsp. of brown suga to sweeten the deal. I also used fresh, skinned, diced, tomatoes instead of nasty ol' can. Cooking time was longer than recipe, cuz I wanted my sweet potatoes nice, and soft. Had some parmesan romano garlic bread the first round with this tasty goodie dish, & made some pepper jack quesadillas to go with round 2 the next day. This recipe will be added to my playlist! ~Good Eatin!~

I love this soup. I've made it many times. The only thing I change is this--instead of 1 1/2 cup water,  I put 1 cup water and 1/2 cup soy sauce.

Sneaky chili but that's not Chile - it's from BRAZIL. Same concept but with mango, what could go wrong? 100% delicious.

I didn't have any mango or chorizo sausage- I had sweet Italian sausage.  I added cumin - about 1 teaspoon, chili powder about 1/2 teaspoon because I didn't have any chilis and some turmeric (about 1/2 teaspoon).  I also used frozen sweet potatoes and this turned out yummy.

This was a very good soup.  I left out the chorizo, though, since we don't like it.  And I left out the chile pepper, since the kids don't  like things spicy.  I upped the garlic, added cumin, used homemade black beans, and used frozen mango.  It was tasty.  We eat a  lot of soups, and while this was good, I expected something out-of-this world, based on the reviews.

The base of this recipe is awesome and the flavors really compliment each other.  I made the following modifications:

Used 3/8 lb Mexican Chorizo 

Used spicy black beans and spicy rotel diced tomatos with chilis
Used enough broth to cover the stew--approximately 3-4 cups.
Added about another clove of garlic and 1 tsp cumin.
Used one jalapeno and two serrano peppers (a little spicy for me but my husband loves it so I'll add sour cream to mine in the future to cut the heat)
Added more salt to taste.
My husband ate it with tortilla chips.

This was SOOOO good.  I bumped up the sweet potatoes to use up what we had on hand.  Also, it makes a BIG batch.  Froze half of it, and found that it's just as good after being frozen!  Did I mention Yum?

Made a few changes with a chorizo veggie option and roasted tomatoes all put in a pressure cooker after cooking the onions and garlic. Wonderful meal with rice.  This is a new family favorite.

I substituted a kombucha squash for the sweet potatoes, and it came out even better (imho). I added about a tablespoon of chopped fresh sage leaves and one of fresh chopped oregano. I left out the mango because, well, I forgot to get one. Still turned out fine.

Made a half version to try. I had tomatoes that needed to be used, so I subbed those for the canned. I used chicken stock in place of the water. I also added a peeled, chopped carrot. No mango on hand so had to forego that. Not much thickness to the broth, but after a day or so in the fridge, it was great served over rice. Also, I had some turkey kielbasa on hand which I pan-fried and served with it. Yummy! Thanks CRVGRL, a very good and healthy recipe!

I just omitted the chili pepper and my 20-month old loved it! So did everyone else in my house! It's a perfect mix of sweet and savory. Thank you for the recipe! It did take an hour to make, however.

My in-laws went away on a South American Cruise and I wanted to throw them a party. This stew was a hit! Everyone loved it and it was gone faster than any of the foods that I made. The sweet and savory blended together beautifully. I put in a little more sweet potatoes 10 a little less black beans. Also, I used frozen mangoes and frozen cilantro. Other than that, I made it exactly the way the recipe breeze. Highly recommend it!

Delicious. Made a few tweaks. No oil, no salt. Added 1tbsp cumin. Frozen mango. Jalepenos. Crowd PLEASER! Served with flour tortillas and cilantro lime rice.  Sautéed kale and collards to round out the meal.
I've made this recipe about 5 times now. I don't understand how people think this has no flavor.... they must not be using meat? Any way, I now use a ham bone (from thanksgiving or christmas) and buy spicy chicken chorizo (3 links) from Whole Foods. I take the chorizo out of the casing and break it up in the pot like ground meat. I still add the 1tbsp of cumin and sometimes shake a little Mrs Dash and Smoked Paprika. I have not had a bad pot yet.

This was a great recipe.  I used Hillshire farms smoked sausage (turkey) and ham.  Actually, you did not really need any meat.  I doubled to tripled the spices.  I brought it to a work pot luck and everyone loved it.  It will definitely be in my rotation.

I enjoyed this stew very much. Even my picky wife enjoyed the stew. I did not add enough ham and my ham was cut to thin. I will change that for the next time.  Also, I used cheap chorizo and it tasted a bit like Italian sausage.  I will correct that for the next time.  Over all, I was very impressed with the flavor of this stew.

This is an OK recipe... I know I cooked it properly (better than as described in the recipe, in fact, as I took time to properly brown my meat and onions) but it just doesn't have that much flavor. Maybe if I had used cured chorizo instead of fresh it'd be better?

But, I'll probably make it again, as it is quite different from the stews I typically make.

This is a yummy, versitile dish, with or without meat. I'v made this multiple times, and even substituted Portuguese sausage for Chorizo.  The flavors blended perfectly....it was WONDERFUL!  

(P.S. you could even substitute Okinawan Sweet Potato, and have a Brazillian-Okinawan fusion dish that looks and tastes incredible as well).

1. Any recipe that calls for chorizo should specify Mexican or Spanish, because they are two very different things. Spanish chorizo is dry-cured and does not need to be cooked. Mexican chorizo is moist and must be cooked - and you wouldn't need oil to cook it in because it is very greasy. From the context I would say this recipe uses Spanish chorizo. 

2. The number of servings is way off. I halved the recipe and did not add any of the meat, and yet it still made 5-6 servings. 

3. If you are using a good, spicy chorizo sausage, this might not need any extra spices, but if you are making it with no meat, it does need more spice (I added cumin, black pepper, extra cilantro, and chipotle pepper.) 

4. To make prep easier, I used Rotel tomatoes rather than separate canned tomatoes and chile peppers, and there is no need to peel sweet potatoes (lots of vitamins in the peel.) I can't speak to the authenticity of this recipe as a Brazilian dish, but without the meat it was quite healthy, tasty, easy, and different. I served it with quinoa cooked with beef broth, onions, and garlic. I will be making this again - would give it 3 1/2 stars, if I could.

Really Good! Definitely took longer than 1/2 hour to chop all the veggies and meat, but that could just be me! I added the mango and cilantro to my dish at the end and offered my guests, but did not mix in once cooked. 
Also at end, I added salt, pepper, garlic powder, and oregano. It was too bland without it. 

Fantastic the next day- will make again!

This was a nice switch to the typical beef stew.  A lot of different flavors coming through.  I thought the only negative was there was maybe too much diced tomato flavor.

I love this recipe.  I've made it several times and it always turns out flavorful and beautiful.  Last time I made it, I had leftover chicken to get rid of so made substituted the chicken for the ham - still delicious.  this is a great stew to make if you want something warm and cozy but will still impress.

I can't believe I forgot to rate this earlier. The first time I made this I didn't add any meat. Meatless Monday you know. It was excellent didn't even miss the meat. I made this this time for my Husbands game dinner, and added venison instead of the sausage. from what he told me everyone really liked it, and talked about how well the tropical fruit blended with the chili peppers and hotness, for a truly unique flavor. Thanks so much for posting.

This is a great recipe! My picky husband, who doesn't normally eat sweet potatoes loved it! I tried to cut calories so I used a little Pam instead of cannola oil, drained the sausage grease and wiped the grease out of the pan with paper towels before returning it and adding the onions. The stew is so flavorful and the mango and the cilantro at the end add a freshness and pop the flavor. Also, I cooked my beans rather than using canned beans. Just boiled them in plain water again to minimize calories and to avoid canned food whenever I can.

This recipe is near perfect, but it needs a bit more flavor. I added a tablespoon of cumin and used chicken stock instead of water. I brought it to a dinner party and everyone loved it!

This recipe was excellent and SO EASY! I omitted the mango because I didn't have any, but didn't miss it at all. I also added a little cumin to the stew. This was great plain, over rice, and as a burrito filler. Made closer to 8 servings for us.

We loved this - great flavors. I skipped the ham and used about 2/3 lbs sausage. i also opted for frozen mangoesinstead of fresh. I think next time I will add an additional can of beans. Will definitely make again.

Absolutely fabulous! Such an interesting mix of ingredients. I served it with some cornmeal biscuits, and we topped the stew with some Parmesan cheese. Hard to stop eating it!

I'm American, my wife is Korean, my relatives are from Ireland and Germany, and this is the only dish I can make to please everyone in my family.  It's great.  I started adding beef broth and 1 tbl. cumin to kick it up a notch, and it works.  I sometimes have to substitute Cilantro with Parsely to please my father in law, but it's just as good.  I've made it with no mango (not in season) and it was great.  Sometimes I use fresh tomatoes instead of cans (depending on what's in the house).  I peel and seed 4 tomatoes for this serving size.  That works either way.  This seems to be a can't fail recipe no matter now you change it.  Thank you for this.  It's my family's favorite.  :-)  ^.^

Delicious and easy. I used a 12oz. package of pork breakfast sausage, plus a tablespoon of chili powder to substitute the chorizo and ham. All other ingredients used as written. I'm a big fan of cilantro and mango. A great way to sweeten it up!

Wow - I don't know what else to say to this recipe!  It is fabulous.  I was unsure about mango, chorizo, and sweet potatoes together, but it works!  I cut the fat in this stew way down by using vegetarian chorizo.  I'm certainly glad I found this recipe...it will be a regular meal in our home.

Delicious!! I was looking for a recipe to use some chorizo I picked up from a local meat company. As written, the sodium content is super high, so I used low sodium, organic canned beans and tomatoes and omitted the extra salt. Also omitted the oil, and it was perfect!

Excellent flavor. The combination of the tastes of the diverse ingredients, particularly the mangos creates a a wonderful flavor without any additional seasonings other than the garlic and salt. I backed off on the chili pepper and added the mangos and cilatro at the time of serving. Good reviews by all who tasted it. Highly recommended.

I doubled the sausage (omitted the ham), used fresh tomatoes (2 large), reduced to 1 can of beans (all i had, but i think it would have been too many beans anyway), frozen mango (cooked for 10 minutes more). I didn't have a chile pepper so i used 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper. I used chicken stock in place of the water so i didn't worry about salting it at the end. Flavors came together beautifully!

Just tried this yesterday. It was incredibly good, but I made a few adjustments. I used 1 1/2 cups dried brown lentils instead of black canned beans. I added them after frying the onion and garlic in oil. I increased water to 4 or 5 cups and boiled the lentils about 20 minutes, adding the diced green pepper and red pepper, fresh tomatoes instead of canned and spice and salt to the mix. After lentils were done, I added sweet potatoes and added a bit more water and let cook until done. I did not add meat or the mango due to finicky eaters, but it was still amazing! We loved it and made this way made for a great low fat meal served over long grain rice! Can't wait for lunch and leftovers! Thanks for the recipe. Will use again and again!

This stew is AMAZING! I have made it multiple times for birthday parties, family events, potlucks - every time people RAVE about it and want the recipe. Its incredibly delicious - I love how the different flavors come together. Its best if you can make it in the morning and let it just sit all day, then reheat for supper! This is a winter staple for our household - thanks! :)

I absolutely LOVE this stew!  The last time I made it, I decided to puree everything in the food processor add a little milk at the end and made a bisque. It is great either way.

This was an okay recipe. It definitley isn't bland or needing spice, as some others reviewed. I think if you start with a good quality chorizo it's a good flavor base. Fresh mango could almost be used as a generous garnish, just to not lose the freshness of it. But overall it's very tomato flavored and it really overpowers the other flavors. I am hoping the leftovers will have time to mellow out and it will taste more balanced tomorrow. Especially because it made a TON of food!

Fun, fresh flavors!  The stew is good until you add the mango / cilantro -- then it's awesome!  I would double the mango / cilantro.  Put in 1 deseeded jalapeno and it wasn't spicy in the least.  Guests loved it.  I can't believe this is healthy.  Also, makes more like 10-12 servings and prep time about 1 hour for chopping.  Pair with simple spinach salad, sour dough or Italian bread, and light, fruity white wine.  Attractive dinner party meal.

This is for sure a grown ups dish....my kids didn't care for it at all, it was too spicy for them. As far as my husband and I say it was awesome!! I took some of this into the UpScale Restarant that I work at and the Senior Chef LOVED IT!!!

I was a little leery when I read the ingredients, but was in the mood for something different.  WOW!!!!  Awesome recipe. Everything worked together so well.  I'm planning to make it this week-end for super bowl. Definitely 5 stars.

This recipe was excellent.  My husband isn't a big fan of sweet potatoes so he told me next time to add a little bit less but I thought it was great the way it was.  The chorizo adds a lot of flavor to the sweet potatoes so even if you are someone who doesn't normally like the taste of them you can still get the nutritional benefits from them by eating them in this stew.

This is a perfect recipe for novice cooks, or in my case, Dad giving Mom the night off. We could not find a ripe mango and instead used diced canned peaches - drained and rinsed. The end result was perfect. You can actually taste the "layers of flavours." Being that the tomatoes were watery, "Dad" used a potato masher and mashed apx one quarter of the stew then mixed it with the rest of the pot to get that more stew like consistency. We also found that the longer the stew sat, the more the flavours incorporated. You may want to consider making this ahead and letting it set for awhile before serving. It is very filling and a meal in itself. Being that the flavours are very complex, we recommend eating with a crusty / Artisan bread and forego any type of sides. We will DEFINITELY be making this again.

So delicious!  I was skeptical at first but the combination of flavors is amazing!  My changes - used only chorizo (3-4 links) added an extra jalepano pepper (sauteed one of them with the onion and chorizo and added the second with the tomatos).  Added one cup water and one cup chicken broth.  For extra flavor added 1/2 tsp cumin and 1/2 tsp cayanne pepper at the end.  Soooo good!

We love animals, so we omitted the meat, but wow this was delicious anyway. I wouldn't change a thing! The flavors and colors are just amazing. I served it with homemade cornbread, which was just right...

It seemed like a strange concoction on paper, but boy was this a delicious stew! The colors of this dish were just beautiful and the wide array of flavors just pop withe very bite. I served it alone with a side of peppered cornbread - a meal we will definitely be making again at my house.

This is now a favorite in my house.  I use diced tomatoes with jalepeno already in there and I leave out the cilantro and even the mangos sometimes.  It's always good.  A keeper!

My boyfriend and I both really liked this recipe, and that's saying a lot since he typically doesn't like sweet potatos or mangos, and I don't usually like ham or chorizo.  I added a little cumin and ginger to give it some flavor, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  If I make it again, I'll probably substitute pepperoni for the chorizo and green bell peppers for the red, just to save a little money.

It tastes as good as it looks and sounds.  I omitted the chorizo only because I didn't have any on hand and added some Goya Adobo seasoning.  Also I topped my stew with sliced avocados.  One of my dinner guests wanted rice so I made rice with Sazon Goya and she mixed it in with her soup.  Was told that was a delicious combo as well.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Loved it!  Used a frozen bag of mango instead of fresh and a can of chili's to save time.  Also used an entire link of sausage so I didn't have to weigh it.  Increased garlic to 1 tablespoon.

We loved this and have frozen several helpings. I think that freezing it has helped to meld the flavors even more. Next time, I may even add another mango as this seems to have made this recipe special. Family loves this!

I give this 5 stars because I loved it, but my husband would only give it 4 and the kids would probably give it 1 because they couldn't handle the texture of the sweet potatoes and mango. I enjoyed every bit of the leftovers and they got better each day.

Besides adding extra chorizo and cilantro and substituting the sweet potato with yam, we followed the recipe as is, and it turned out to be super yummy. It was amazing with butter garlic sourdough bread! It's like nothing I've ever tried before!

You look at all the ingrediants in this recipe and think how can it really be good but let me tell you it is just wonderful! So colorful too!! I used green pepper for a different color in it and added maybe 2-3 times the amount of water. Also used garlic sausage seeing I couldnt find the one in the recipe. I will definately make this again, and again and again.........

Loved this recipe!  My family went crazy over it, too.  I left out the chili peppers, but other wise followed it as called for.  Kept fairly well for the following day (mangoes were best in it on the first day), but really great overall!

Looks great and tastes like you are eating candy! To cut back on sodium I used dried black beans that I made the night before.  Left out the ham and used 1 link of Mexican chorizo.  Served as a side dish next to crock pot browned (gravy master) turkey drumsticks.  Thank you CRVGRL!

This was very tasty stew.  I omited the pepper and added more ground cumin AND as suggested by another reveiwer I added about 2/3 cup of merlot, which gave it a little kick.  This receipe reminded my husband and I of chili but less heavy.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, it's a keeper!!

I've tried this recipe once, and I will use it over and over.  What a great combination of flavors!  The only alterations I made were to add a rounded teaspoon of minced fresh ginger root with the garlic, and, because I had forgotten to buy the hot green chile pepper called for, I added some crushed, dried hot red chile.  If I ever get my hands on some linguica (which doesn't show up in the stores here) I will use it instead of the chorizo, though I have to say the chorizo I bought was excellent.

AWESOME!  After reading the reviews of those who thought "how could this taste good?" (I was one!) I gave it a shot and am SO GLAD I did!  I even had to run to the store (1/2 hour delay) for mangoes cuz mine were off...so I was in the "this BETTER be good!" mindframe by the time the meal was ready!  It was a HUGE hit with the whole family, loved the "kick"...I omitted the ham & used some other kind of sausage (Anda..somethin'er'other).  Great blend of flavors, if all food in Brazil is this good - it's on my list!  Thanks for sharin!

Ooooooh! I loved this stew. Although it takes a considerable amount of preparation time, it is worth every minute. I only had one sweet potato, but it still tasted awesome. Can't wait to have it again.

A great skillet dinner.  I halved the recipe but used the full amount of sausage and ham.  I put in a splash of red wine which added to the flavour.  A keeper.

Oh so yummy!! It's very simple to make - the most time consuming part is the chopping. I used mild Italian sausage, but I think next time I'll use the hot in order to give this dish a little more zip.

Delicious!  We added more cilantro and some sour cream at the table.  We served the soup with tortilla chips and a green salad.

This has been a staple recipe of mine for years.  I just tried it with dried beans and fresh tomatoes (trying not to eat much out of cans) in my new pressure cooker and it turned out great!  I soaked the beans in the morning and then in the evening I got the beans started in the pressure cooker while I started chopping the veggies and browning the sausage (I used soy chorizo).  I pressure cooked the beans for 10 minutes and by that time my sausage, onion, garlic, pepper, sweet potato and chili pepper were sautéed and ready to go in with the beans.  I diced the fresh tomatoes, cilantro and mango while the bean mixture pressure cooked for 8 min.  I manually depressurized it so it wouldn't overcook and added the tomatoes, then cilantro and mango a bit later.  I seasoned it to taste, I had a lot of liquid from my beans so I ended up using 2 Maggi bullion cubes, a packet of Goya sazon and a packet of Badia sazon tropical.  It was amazing, my 3 kids loved it, I have leftovers to freeze or bring to work for lunch, and best of all it was fast enough to make on a weeknight after work.

REALLY good stew...I used hot italian sausage instead of the other meats, and I added extra cilantro and some cumin.

I used the Italian Sausage and I thought it had good flavor but the family did not like it. Not very kid friendly.

With some personal adjustments (like chopped up beefsteak instead of sausage or ham) this has been a permanent crowd please. And who doesn't love mangoes?!?!? :)
