I'm going to rate these muffins first based on MY taste as a non-vegan, and then when my vegan niece comes and tries them, I'll make an addition to this review as to her viewpoint.  This was my first experience with spelt flour, and it tasted grainy to me.  However, the flavor of the muffin itself was very good.  I took the liberty of using the addition of sweet potato and dried plums since the submitter suggested possibilities of additions to this basic recipe.  There is another recipe here submitted by the same person using sweet potato.  The twelve muffins cooked up perfectly and took exactly 18 minutes to bake.  I do think adding nuts to these would be wonderful.  Thanks, Mandi!

Really really good recipe. :) I made a double batch and swapped a 1/2 cup of honey out for the white sugar. Thanks Mandi!

Absolutely love it gave it to my kids and they didnt notice it was vegan. I swapped out the sunflower oil for grapeseed oil and added chia, hemp, nuts, and dark chocolate.

Pretty good! I used softened butter instead of sunflower oil, and added chopped pecans and chopped carrots.

Definitely added to my favorite list, and will make again. Thank you for the yummy recipe! I swapped avocado oil instead of sunflower oil, added 1/4 teaspoon of salt, a dash or two of pumpkin pie spice, coconut sugar instead of white sugar, and 1/2 cup applesauce.

I didn't have any spelt flour and used all purpose flour. I also add chocolate chips. My husband said they were good and I have to agree. I want to try spelt flour next.
