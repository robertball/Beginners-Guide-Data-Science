I made this dish exactly per the recipe, and like a previous poster, I felt this dish is very much lacking in the taste department- very flat and bland.  Not wanting to toss it, I experimented by adding about a cup of good red wine, some parsley and Italian seasoning and leaving it cook a little longer.  Much better!

Consider using top sirloin and add a few shakes of Worcestershire sauce and you can really kick this recipe up.  I followed the cooking instructions exactly and the dish had a great consistency - tender beef in a deeply flavorful brown gravy.  Served over Mrs. Dash's recipe for Garlic and Herb Mashed Potatoes and a side of steamed broccoli with Velveeta on top.

This was great.  Will make often.  The beef stays so tender, not chewy at all.  I will add more fresh mushrooms next time.

Very good. I used I whole onion, extra fresh mushrooms, 1.5 lbs of meat, 5 garlic cloves, a teaspoon of worcester sauce. I also used parsley instead of basil.  I am using the leftovers in a wrap for lunch.  I think I will add some veggies next time.

made this tonight with a few suggested reviewer changes: added about 1/2 cup red wine, a few shakes of Worcestershire, some Italian seasoning and thickened the gravy with a mixture of cornstarch and water. The beef was so tender! I served it over white rice. Hubby rated it 5 stars!

Quality meal but I would like to add more seasoning.  Also added cornstarch to thicken the sauce.

We enjoyed this meal very much, especially my husband. I only had 3/4lb meat ad used whole can of broth. Except that I follow rec. The meat was tender and sauce had a nice consistency. The thickness of your sauce depends on how much flour you allow to stick on your meat. So you may need to adjust your sauce by adding flour at the end or adding more stock while cooking. However it doesnt affect the final outcome.

YUM!!  The only change I made was to add 1 tsp. of corn starch (with about 1 Tbsp. of water) at the end to thicken the sauce. As stated before, this can also be done by adding a little flour at the end. The flavors were fantastic and the meat was very tender. We will definately have this again soon!
