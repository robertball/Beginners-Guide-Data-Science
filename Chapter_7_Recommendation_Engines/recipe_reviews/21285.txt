This was a very east dish to prepare, but if you're going to cook it in one layer of cubed sweet potatoes, like the recipe says, be prepared to use two pans, or get only three sweet potatoes. I must have chosen enormous potatoes, because I could have filled two dishes. I would probably use less water to make the syrup thicker, but it was still extremely good. Not as rich as some of the sweet potato dishes I've had in the past.

Perfect holiday side dish because it's so easy to make and delicious.  I used sugar-free maple syrup to lower the calories and it still tasted great.

This was so easy and great at thanksgiving. Was asked at dinner to make it again next year. Doubled the recipe, and put into a deeper baking dish (wasn't in a single layer) and baked 1/2hour longer.

The sweet potato fans at my Thanksgiving dinner really liked this dish and told me to give it a five-star rating.  Instead of baking the potatoes, I cut them in small chunks and boiled them until they were tender but still firm (only because I spaced out about the time it takes to bake them), then put them in the oven with the turkey for 30 min.

This was pretty good.  I used 5 potatoes and had to layer them.   I baked them at 375 for about an hour and they were perfect.

This dish was TOO good!  I ate the whole thing myself and spent the rest of the night feeling guilty!  If there was anything I'd change it would be to use a little less water, so that the syrup would be a bit thicker.

After playing with this I found that by removing the cover 10-15 minutes before being done and raising the oven temp (or not depending...) allows the sugars to caramelize nicely and enriching the flavors.  Or you could just pop it under a broiler. I think it makes it even better.

I made this dish for Thanksgiving dinner this year instead of my usual sweet potato casserole and really enjoyed it so much more. I was growing tired of my sweet potato dish tasting more like a dessert, and really just wanted to enjoy the sweet potatoes by themselves without all the fluff. This recipe was exactly what I was looking for. It is sweet enough, but you are able to appreciate the sweet potatoes for what they are. It does only take 3 large sweet potatoes to cover bottom of dish in a single layer. I cut the potatoes in half rounds instead of cubes, as I think it makes for a nicer presentation. I sprinkled a little bit of cinnamon over the potatoes b/f adding liquid. I also used pure maple syrup, which I think is key. Incredibly easy and delicious.

Awesome. I cut sweet potato's into long spears instead of cubing. Also added sliced apples on top. A crowd pleaser. Buy small long and slender sweet potato's.

This dish was so, so, so easy and there aren't many ingredients, so it's cheap too.  It took no time at all except to peel and cut up the sweet potatoes.  Just throw it in the oven and it's done in 55 minutes.  It went over very well at the potluck dinner...they ate it all!  It was sweet, but not too sweet.  I highly recommend this dish if you're cooking for a lot of people (or even for just yourself) because it's easy and delicious.

I made this for Turkey day, everyone was expecting the usual sweet pototoes with marshmallow wich made me a little nervous. Well everyone loved it and they didn't seem to miss the traditional overly sweet stuff at all.

A very simple recipe that was a big hit with the family who don't eat sweet potatoes! I used 4 rather that 5 sweet potatoes. They fit nicely in an 11 x 7 pan. I sliced the potatoes about 1/2' thick then cubed. Recipe says single layer. Mine were not technically a single layer but the pan was by no means filled.

Great recipe!  It has a wonderful blend and contrast of flavors and textures.  I made it with ham for Christmas dinner and everyone raved -- said it "made" the whole dinner.  Also, I added more pecans and raisens to mine, because the amounts called for seemed a little skimpy.

Wow!  This is good... I used raw yams and cooked them until they were about half done, then continued with the recipe and added a bit of brown sugar and used golden raisins.  Since I didn't have pecans, I used walnuts.  Sadly for me, there were no leftovers!

Really yummy!  The liquid wasn't as thick/syrupy as I'd imagined, and it wasn't the nicest looking dish, but it was tasty! Not too sweet at all, even with my brown sugar addition at the end!  I also sprinkled cinnamon on it.  It was a perfect accompaniement to Mary's Pecan Crusted Chicken, from this site, and Corn Pudding, from this site, too.  The "syrup" from this was perfect on the chicken.  Thanks, Kathleen!

Yummy!  So easy and so good.  I used light syrup and it still was wonderful.  I made for Thanksgiving and my chef son-in-low thought it was good too.  We will have this often!  Thanks for submitting the recipe.

I'm not a huge sweet-potato fan, but this was very good - although, I added extra pecans.  I made it for Thanksgiving and everyone asked for the recipe.

My family did not particulary like this dish.  The kids usually like sweet potatoes but we ended up throwing most of it away.

We LOVE these potatoes.  They are special but not difficult.  Next time, to free up oven space, I am going to prepare this dish in the slow cooker.  Should be easy to adapt!

I made this last year for Thanksgiving, and I made sure to find the recipe again for this year's dinner.  My family loved it!  It is the perfect sweet potato recipe for the Thanksgiving table.

Easy to make and tastes wonderful. I like a thicker sauce for this dish, so I added a little corn starch at the very end so that every drop can be scooped up! (follow the corn starch directions!)Thanks for a great recipe!

This was excellent!  We just added a sprinkle of brown sugar on the top and it went perfectly with the Stuffed Pork Chops III on this site for a delicious Fall dinner!

These reminded me a little of canned yams but better.  They aren't too sweet and they are easy to make.

Followed most of the recipe, but since I love ginger I added some grated ginger. I did buy 5 potatos as indicated, but only used 3 and still had to use a larger pan. Very tasty.

Loved it but I added more pecans and raisins.  I also soaked raisins first before adding to dish.  I  added some cinnamon and nutmeg as well as a slurry of cornstarch and water to thicken the glaze a bit.  I topped it off with a touch of sea salt.  I could eat this as a desert.

Delicious! I halved this, and experimented with a little cinnamon and nutmeg, but neither added very much to the finished dish. So, this is perfect as is.
