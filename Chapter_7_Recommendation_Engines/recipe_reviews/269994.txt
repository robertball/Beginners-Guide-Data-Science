Usually cauliflower rice is rather bland, so I made a couple of changes to the recipe.  Used steam in bag cauliflower rice. Used 1 tablespoon of butter instead of 2 and 1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil.  A whole onion instead of half and about 4 cloves of garlic. Instead of serving it in a bowl, I spooned the mixture into muffin tins and baked for 20 minutes. It was marvelous.

I found it a little bland. And dry. Kind of boring. With lots, lots more Parmesan, I managed to eat it all, but I won't make again. I followed the recipe to a T.
