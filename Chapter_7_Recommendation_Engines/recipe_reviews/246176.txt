Made as written except I added carrots and asparagus in the end because they needed used and because I wanted that extra texture. I liked this a lot! I'm not much into the blended soups but this was good. I added some smoked paprika after tasting it but that was it. Good recipe and very versatile when it comes to using up veggies that need used.
