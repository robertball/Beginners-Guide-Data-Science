Delicious - I'd have a couple of suggestions for some other reviewers.  If this tastes bland or you feel it needs 4x the spices, you probably are using jarred spices that have been sitting in your cabinet since the Truman administration. 

I think by and large crushing cinnamon sticks is a risky proposition - most cinnamon sticks in the US are for dipping in punch or decoration for some coffee drink - they are usually just awful.  Ground coinnamon isn't perfect but a teaspoon will more than do.

I have been cooking from scratch for 20 years and have NEVER seen a fresh chickpea at any market. I assume that this reviewer meant canned as opposed to dry...I hope.

I never add the canned liquid from beans, it has some starch, but a quick blend with the immersion blender or mashing some of the garbanzo's against the side of the pan with a fork will thicken it up nicely and you don't risk the tinny flavour of the canned liquid....obviously add as much or as little liquid as you prefer.

Of the new recipes I try, my husband and I agree that I should repeat some of them, but with A. Rahman's Chickpea Curry, we both wanted it again the next day! I scaled the recipe (for which I'm now kicking myself) to 4, used 1/2 tsp of ground cinnamon instead of crushing the stick, omitted the salt, added 2 cups of diced left over turkey, and 1/2 cup of vegetable broth (from a  cube) to add extra sauce and replace the omitted salt. Served it over jasmine rice and called it a day. This (with or without my turkey addition) will become a regular menu offering in our house. Someone else wrote that it will satisfy your craving for curry- and they are totally right. Cheers!

I've already reviewed this recipe, but it's become such a favourite of mine that I had to review it again. The last time I made it I added a large can of diced tomatoes (drained) and doubled the spices- it was wonderful!! Plus, once you've got all the spices, it's the easiest thing to make! Yum!

Pretty good, and so easy.  I usually let it simmer for forty minutes to   
let the flavors blend, and served it over a bit of rice.  For reference, 
2/3rds a teaspoon of ground cinnamon is about equivalent to one 2-inch
cinnamon stick.  Also, don't use the enormously large onions you find in
some supermarkets -- use normal medium-sized onions (or else you'll have 
almost as much onion as chickpeas!).

This was very quick and so easy to make, and tasted very authentic.  I added kale to the curry so it wouldn't have just chickpeas in it.  Spinach would taste really great in this dish, too!  This tasted even better the next day, and would be great eaten with Indian bread.

Good basic recipe for chickpeas or "cholay."  You can also top with chopped tomatoes, onions, and green chiles, or diced boiled potatoes.  For more flavor, try adding a teaspoon of tamarind pulp or paste and/or a teaspoon of an Indian spice mix called "chaat masala" just before finishing.  To thicken the sauce, try potato flakes.

Wonderful side dish for an Indian-themed dinner! I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and drained the chickpeas while adding a 14.5 oz. can of diced tomatoes, undrained. I also used ground cinnamon and ground cloves. Be sure to stir in the cilantro just before serving and to save some to sprinkle on top. The cayenne pepper made it spicy hot but not too much so- be adventurous and leave it in. Indian food has to have a nice bite to it! Serve some raita on the side to cool the palate if needed. Thanks for one of the best ways to cooking chickpeas I've experienced!

This came out quite well. I added a can of diced tomatoes and doubled the ginger, cumin, coriander, and turmeric. I also threw in a little curry powder I had. I also added a diced baked potato with the chick peas. It ended up being a bit dry, but adding some water worked just fine. It also ended up being a tad bit spicy with just the rice but combining with some plain yogurt from the supermarket works really well. Also, for reference: 2 tsp fresh ginger root = 1 tsp ground ginger; 6 whole cloves = 1/2 tsp ground clove, 1 inch cinnamon stick = 1 tsp ground cinnamon

I am a big indian food lover, I have tried so many dishes, and it seems almost impossible 
for me to find an indian dish that I do not like, until now.  I thought that this dish was
very poor, I threw it all out while it was still hot.  Way too much cilantro for my taste.

My whole family is hooked on this recipe!  Wonderful and easy to make.  I have also substituted and added other ingredients such as white beans, carrots, cauliflower and peas.  The base is delicious and versatile!

We really love this recipe.  I make a big batch and freeze it with some rice so we can take it for lunches.  This is a staple meal in our house!  (I haven't got any kids to test it on.)

Sooo good. Recommendations: You can omit the coriander (its basically cilantro, assuming you DO have cilantro). I also recommend adding a can of diced tomatoes (with juice) rather than the garbanzo bean can water. Also, eat over rice (even a little is worth it). Instead of using cayenne pepper, a few dashes of hot sauce works really well without making it too spicy. Also lime juice adds a nice kick. I'll be making this many more times!

This came out delicious, but I made substantial changes so I'm giving it 4 stars. I used garlic oil, 1 red onion and three tablespoons of minced garlic. I used dried ginger, dried cinnamon, turmeric and dried cumin - and I doubled the spices. Sauteed together for about 5 mins, then added 1 can of garbanzo beans and 1 can of diced tomatoes, both in their juices. I added a small can of coconut milk (for creaminess), a dash of fish sauce, some vegetable broth and vegetable bouillon, and fresh chopped cilantro and simmered for 30 mins. Oh yes, and I added a dollop of red curry paste I had left over, as I had no garam masala. It is an excellent base for many different types of curries. I was very pleased. Thank you!

This is really tasty and easy to make, but next time I will use less turmeric.  My Indian roommate says it tastes authentically Indian.

This was pretty good, but it could just be because I'm really hungry? I used 1 tsp. of cinnamon in place of the cinnamon sticks. I didn't find this to be bland like others did, so like another reviewer suggested, maybe your spices are just really old. The cayenne added a nice kick. I used 1 small onion, 2 would be too many. I found that even though I cooked this a little longer than the recipe indicated, I still had crunchy bits. I think I'll throw in the ginger with the onion to make sure it gets cooked and then I'll let the whole thing simmer covered for 20 minutes or so to soften it. Also, I liked another reviewer's suggestion to mash up some of the beans to add thickness. Overall, good and would make again.

This made my house smell AMAZING. Modifications: drained the chickpeas, doubled the spices (used 2 tsp ground cinnamon instead of sticks) except the cayenne pepper, which I reduced to 1/2 tsp, and reduced the cilantro to ~1/2 cup. Additions: 1 (14.5 oz) can of diced tomatoes, a handful each of kale, frozen peas, and cauliflower, and a diced boiled potato (added in the last few minutes). I simmered everything together for about 40 minutes and periodically added splashes of chicken broth to prevent things from getting too dry. I used a wide saucepan (kind of like a half-stockpot); a frying pan would not be tall enough to contain all the ingredients.

I was always intimidated by Indian cuisine (making it not eating it) because of all the unfamiliar spices, but this recipe is a great one to start with - simple with really good results. I didn't follow the recipe exactly though. I added some cubed potatoes between the onion and spice stage. I doubled all the spices except for the cayenne pepper and cinnamon. I accidentally drained the chickpeas liquid away so I used the equivalent amount of chicken broth, which was a nice addition. Finally, I added fresh tomatoes at the end. We enjoyed it with plain (Greek) yogurt and nan. I will definitely make this again.

I just loved this dish!  I added one tbsp of chicken bulion powder to make it a little more savory (which is the way I am used to it at my favorite Indian restaurant) I also cut the cayenne down to 1?2 as tsp because I was serving this to my kids as well.  It was a hit!  Thank you for this recipe, I will use it again and again!

I cooked up chickpeas and mung beans to use as the beans, then I used 1/4 tsp. ground cloves and 1 tsp. ground cinnamon instead of the whole spices, and cut the amount of cayenne pepper down.  After all that, I found that I didn't have cilantro!  But, the taste was OK!

Amazing. This was the first time I've tried making curry, but it was very easy and VERY tasty.
I followed other reviewers' suggestions and used diced tomatoes instead of the chickpea can broth, plus 1 tsp ground cinnamon instead of 2 sticks, and 1/4 tsp ground cloves instead of 6 whole ones. 
The tomatoes (and the cilantro!) really added to the flavour, but even before I added them, the fragrance of the spices filled up the kitchen.
This was a big hit with my housemates and I'll definitely be making it again!

We really enjoyed this!  I used 2 tsp of garlic ginger paste and a little bit of dried, minced garlic. I also substituted ground spices for the cinnamon and clove. I rinsed the two cans of chickpeas and added a whole can of diced tomatoes! Honestly, this recipe can call for two cans. We added one large chopped potato. Also, I threw everything into a slow cooker and came home to a beautiful aroma. Next time I think I'll add cauliflower and green peas.

I wanted to make this a meal so I added fresh spinach, tomatoes and prawns.  My husband loved it, but it was way too spicy for me!!  The flavor was really delicious, I just couldn't eat it.  I made rice to eat it with left overs and that helped some with the heat.  I didn't notice any other comments about it being too hot, so maybe I did something differently and didn't notice.  Will try again with tweaking to reduce the heat.

Great recipe.  I followed the advice of others.  I added 1/2 tsp of both ginger and cloves and 1 tsp. of cinnamon.  I added only a dash of cayenne pepper and omitted the cilantro.  After adding the beans (drained), I poured in some chicken broth to cook and soften the beans.  I simmered it all for about 15 minutes.  We heated a few slices of naan bread on the grill and dipped it in the curry.  A really good meal.

The recipe was good as a base, but was fabulous with a few tweaks. I added a can of coconut milk, a handful of raisins, 2 tsp tamarind pulp, a couple handfuls of spinach, about 1 cup of diced tomatoes, and didn't have cilantro so I omitted that. It was perfect! One of my favourite recipes!!

Delicious.  I doubled this recipe, maybe added a little extra cilantro, and added ground cinnamon and cloves instead of whole (1 tsp of each).  It turned out the perfect spice level for people who like spice.  Beautiful over rice.  Will make again and again.

This makes the kitchen smell like an Indian restaurant. While the onion is cooking, I measure out all the spices into a small bowl to add all at once. I use crushed ginger root and ground cinnamon and add a can of petite diced tomatoes. Also I drain the bean juice and sub in water. This is a simple cheap meal and once you have all the spices together it is easy to make.

My husband and I are always in search of recipes with the following qualities: quick, easy, budget friendly, and healthy.  We also try to eat vegetarian at least once or twice a week.  We like trying new flavors but do not usually cook a lot of curry-based dishes.  We both found this recipe to be delicious and very filling.  We served it over jasmine rice as another reviewer recommended.  Now that we have all of the spices in the house (we only had to buy one or two items, I believe) then the only ingredients we will need to pick up to make this in the future will be the chickpeas and an onion.  We will definitely be making this again soon.

This was great!!  Instead of oil, I used vegetable broth (about 1/3 cup) to cook the onions.  Also, I only used half the cayenne pepper called for and it was still VERY spicy, so be careful adding your spices.  Great, authentic taste.  This was my first Indian dish, and I'm really glad I chose this one!!

This is really really good, and even better when you add bite-size raw apple.  I prefer a sweet varity; it has a nice contrast to the curry.  It gives the texture a nice bit of crunch too.  And as I like apples, I put a lot in mine.

This was delicious.  I used 1/2 tsp. of ground cinnamon instead of the crushed cinnamon sticks and have added extra vegetables like spinach, sweet potatoes and white potatoes.

This was an excellent recipe...I did make a few modifications: Like a previous reviewer, I drained the chickpeas and added a can of diced tomatoes (this really adds to the flavor, especially if you don't have a lot of the spices on hand like me). I also didn't have cloves, cinnamon, cilantro, or ginger root on hand. I cut out the garlic as well. I did add a tsp of garam masala powder, which you can find at an Indian grocery, and doubled the cumin (my own personal taste). You'll probably have to play with the amount of spices added to suit your tastes. But it's a quick, delicious, and easy recipe. You can modify the recipe quite a bit and it still tastes excellent!

This was pretty good.  I wish I had made some roti or naan to go with it, the basmati rice left something to be desired.  Also, a note to those who have never cooked with cilantro...don't chop the stems up, just the leaves!  Like a lot of indian food, it tasted better the next day.  Indian food is hard to cook, I think, especially when you try to make it somewhat healthy and not use much fat.  I'm trying to recreate dishes from our favorite restaurant, Nirvana (in New Orleans) but I'm not having much luck.  I'm beginning to get desperate and may even try cooking with ghee next time -- although I'll have to work out extra hard the next day!

Very quick & easy recipe. If you have a stocked spice rack already then this one probably won't cost you more than $10 and it'll last for four-five meals :) Highly recommend, I liked the slight kick it had too.

This was great!  I used canned chick peas and included the water from the can in the recipe.  I may use veggie or chicken broth next time.  Used 1 teaspoon of cinnamon as I did not have the sticks.  Cut the cloves down to 4 as I don't really like them and cut the cayenne pepper to 1/2 teaspoon because I'm a wimp.  I didn't use quite as much cilantro and used dried as that was all I had on hand.  The flavor that resulted was wonderful meld of a sweet cinnamon start with a peppery bite at the end.  My husband, who specifically hates chick peas, was savoring these one by one.  I served it with the Curry Stand Chicken Tikka Masala and chipotle lime rice here on the site.  Possibly the best dinner that I have ever made.

This was very tasty and super easy.  I didn't have the coriander, so I skipped that.  Substituted ground cloves and cinnamon with no issue.  I cut down the cayenne a bit, and it was still quite spicy.

This is just excellent, my family and I love it. I do leave out the cayenne pepper, as I’m not a big fan of spicy food. One piece of advice: In the unlikely event that you have leftovers, remove the cinnamon sticks before refrigerating, as they will completely overpower every other flavor by the next day.

This was awesome! I made it pretty much as is...
I omitted the ground coriander and cilantro, as I don't like the taste.  
Also, I used about 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon as I didn't have a stick.
With the chickpeas, you can also drain them and add the liquid as needed to control your consistency.
It has some kick with the cayenne pepper and my husband, who was reluctant, loved it.

I only had a bite of this, was instantly hooked, and made sure to have my friend send me the recipe.  I will definitely be passing this one along to my brother too since he doesn't like to eat any meats other than seafood and is crazy about Indian spices.

I was excited to try this recipe as I love chickpeas and all curry dishes.  Unfortunately, I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out way too spicy!  I would suggest only used 1/3 or less of a teaspoon of cayenne and then taste it before adding more.  I wanted to throw the batch out after having one serving.

Great, tasty--perfect to satisfy your Indian cuisine cravings...just a few tips to share:  if you're using dry chicpeas, you'll probably need to double your spices if you end up with a lot more than the equivalent of two cans as called for in the recipe...also, add that cayenne a half tsp at a tiime, or else you'll have a runny nose while you're eating this, 1-2 tsp of a good cayenne can knock your sinuses right out...if this does happen, as it did to me, add a half can of lite coconut milk, this helped...a bit.  And DEFINITELY add a can of diced tomatoes in place of the liquid from your canned beans...it adds to the flavor and consistency...and it's still great and yummy even if you're out of tumeric or don't like coriander, instead add a dash of curry powder...That's about it, with a dash of salt...yum, yum, yummy.

I made this with double the seasonings and a can of diced,drained tomatos as recommended by others.  I simmered the beans longer hoping they would absord more of the flavors, but it didn't do it as much as I'd hope.  This dish was  good nevertheless.  However, the day after - this dish is awesome.  It really taste great the following day once everything has had time to meld together.  This was noted by many other commentors and I have to totally agree.  I will make this recipe again, however next time, I will make a day in advance.

I just finished making this recipe and I thought it was delicious. It is quite spicy, however, (which I love) so if you don't like spice I wouldn't recommend this dish. I used 1 large onion (instead of 2), 1 tsp ground cinnamon, 1/2 tsp ground cloves since I didn't have whole and I added 1 diced potato because I thought it was too liquidy when I added the chickpeas. I let it simmer for about 45 minutes. I ate it with naan bread. Will definitely make this again.

Made this and added part of a butternut squash and half a cauliflower head. Pretty good, next time I will add a little more cayenne or cumin- something spicy.

Delicious!  I followed the recipe to the letter, except I substituted 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon for the sticks.  It is pretty darn spicy, though, so you may want to halve the amount of cayenne pepper if you like things mildly spiced or leave it out altogether if you don't like spicy foods.  I served it over rice and we really enjoyed it.  Thanks for this recipe!

Ever since first trying this recipe in September, it has become a regular dinner in our house.  Its a favourite when we are all a bit broke, and only have a few dollars to buy a few ingrediants.  So its very economical!

A few changes I make:
I use one can of chickpeas (drained)
I add one can of crushed tomatoes.
I add one chopped birds eye chilli (for a bit of bite)

If I want to make the curry a bit bulkier, I add some par boiled sweet potato or pumpkin.

This is a great dish that is so easy to make.  I have two small children, so I used only half the cayenne pepper, but it was still too spicy for them so I had to add yoghurt to cut the bite.  (I love the spiciness so I added crushed red pepper to my portion!)  I used ground cinnamon and almost double of the remaining spices.  YUMMY!!

This recipe was great. I added a can of tomatoes and some indian eggplant and let it simmer for about 40min. Indian cuisine is the only food where I don't miss the meat. Fantastic!!

Where's the flavor? Neither I nor my husband cared for this at all. I offered to try and make it better next time, but he said not to even bother.

i thought these were absolutely restaurant quality, and my husband too thought they were delightful.  i cant believe anyone thinks they are bland!  i made them without turmeric, couldnt find any...used 1t cinnamon and 1/4 t cloves and drained the chickpeas and added a mostly drained can of diced tomatoes.  i did use a hand blender to puree about half of it, and i couldnt have been more pleased with the results.  it will definitely stay in the rotation.  thanks for the recipe.

We love chickpeas and this is just another wonderful way to fix them!!  I used ground cloves and cinnamon also w/ good results.   I did use some of the liquid from the chickpeas.  1 tsp of cayenne pepper is a bit much.   I was sweating while eating this!! (I liked it none the less)   Will decrease the amt of cayenne a bit next time.  High ratings from my husband, too.  He also agreed to decrease amt of pepper!!!

this recipe is a good starting point. very filling. i didn't use the cinnamon or cloves and i doubled the other spices except for the cayenne. i also added a tsp of hot curry powder. i drained the chickpeas and i added a can of diced tomatoes. didn't use all the juice though. i also added about 1/2 cup of chicken stock. i used a little cornstarch at the end to thicken the sauce.

Honestly, I used this recipe as a loose idea for a chickpea curry - I sauteed onion, garlic, and peppers in olive oil and spices, then dumped in some canned chickpeas.  I found I had quite a bit of liquid left in the pan and it was kind of runny for my taste, so I sprinkled in some couscous to soak it up.

Very tasty and easy.  A few minor modifications:  Instead of crushing 2 cinnamon sticks, added 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon.  Added salt and a little sugar to round out the flavors.  Mistakenly, I doubled the cumin, but everything was good anyways.  We liked the spice level very much and the recipe was really easy to put together.  The dish simmered about an hour after adding the chickpeas, and I liked how the flavors blended after stewing a little while.  I did, however, have to add some water half way through, because it was dry.  Thanks for the great recipe for one of my favorite channa dishes!

By far, one of my favourite recipes from AllRecipes so far!  I only used ½ tsp of cayenne (thankfully), used 1 tsp of ground cinnamon and added 2 diced tomatoes and a bag of baby spinach.  This was so delicious!  I served it with basmati rice, and it made a perfect meal.  I can hardly wait until lunch tomorrow, so I can finish the leftovers!

My family loved it!  I halved the oil and sprinkled on a tsp or two of ground cinnamon.  We ate it in warm pitas and substituted green chutney (recipe on this site) for the cilantro.

Delicious - I made it twice this week!  I used a little less coriander and cinnamon the second around (2 sticks of crushed cinnamon is VERY strong - one whole stick was sufficient).  I also added asafetida, fenugreek and lime juice, which brought out the flavors and definitely enhanced the dish.  The cilantro is nice but, if you don't have any on hand, you can still make it - the curry will stand on its own.

I am Indian and this tastes great. Once I did not have ginger and left it out and still tasted very good. Often I leave out the cinnamon as well. As a variation, I have added a diced up tomato for color but be careful because it can make it too thin. As another variation, I have added about 1 and 1/2 cups raw cauliflower after the chick peas (having added a little extra 1/2tsp cumin, coriander, turmeric and chili) and let it cook in the liquid - my picky (Indian) dad loved it.

I make Indian food a lot and I have been looking for a simpler chickpea recipe than the one I have been using for years. The ratings and reviews seemed to suggest this was the one. I was a bit disappointed.
It was lacking in a some flavor. When reading over the recipe, I was surprised at the lack of tomatoes, and also the large amount of turmeric (cilantro as well, which I love but as many do not, I have been in the habit of just putting some in my bowl instead of the whole dish). Still, I thought I would make it as the recipe states first to try it. I was surprised to see that the onions were only to be briefly cooked before tossing in the chickpeas and liquid. This leaves the onions crunchy and undercooked. To those attempting this recipe, cook the onions more thoroughly before adding any liquid. These kinds of recipes should also be allowed to simmer for a while (around 30 min) to let the flavors permeate everything. If you are using 2 onions, make sure they are on the smaller side. Mine were large so I just used 1 1/2 and there were still probably more onions than chickpeas. Use half the turmeric or less.
As the end result was a bit lackluster, I had to add a few things: a can of tomatoes which I pureed, extra ginger and garlic, garam masala, and ground cinnamon. I also mashed some of the chickpeas with a fork to thicken the sauce. Another thing is I used dried chickpeas which I cooked earlier. Along with some of the liquid, I put in some chicken bullion for flavor.

My husband and I really liked this dish. We have a few suggestions: grind all your spices in a coffee bean grinder before adding them. This way you're not having to pick through pieces of cinnamon or biting into a whole clove. Also, I would cut the cayenne by 2/3 - our dish was so spicy! Skip the fresh cilantro, I did.

Easy and good.  I soaked 2 c. dried chickpeas with water to cover for 5 hours, drained them,  then pressure cooked them with 4 more cups of water for 45 minutes.  I will reduce the cayenne next time for my grandbabies and let my husband add Tabasco to his liking.

I guess its not right to rate this recipe, because I made a few changes, but I used it as a base. I didn't have cloves or cilantro, but I added some curry powder, and potatoes, zucchini, and what really made it for me, was the addition of some fresh squeezed lime juice. It was delicious.  And because I was sharing with my 9 month old baby girl I left out the cayenne. We both LOVED it. next time i will add cauliflower

Wow! This is delicious!! I made this as an easy lunch and had all the ingredients on hand. I added a bit of garam masala, halved the cayenne and added a diced potato to the onions as they sauteed. I also added some spinach and halved cherry tomatoes at the end. Will definitely make again. Thanks for posting!

Nice healthy recipe to get chickpeas in your diet. Thanks for uploading. Changes I made: As suggested by others, added a tin of chopped tomatoes and a handful of spinach. Also added some sultanas (may try honey next time) since the dish to me seemed to be lacking sweetness. Served with some toasted pita bread.

decent i guess. a dry curry- not a liquid chickpea curry like i have had at restaurants. be aware it's quite spicy. i added only 1/4 tsp cayenne. used 1 tsp ground cinn & 1/4 tsp ground cloves. added a can of diced tomatoes as suggested by other reviewers. it was definitely edible, but not as good as I had hoped. this recipe has gotten such rave reviews. i was disappointed. this is a good base recipe but not quite what i was looking for i guess.. thanks anyway.

very easy, and tasty.  I doubled the dry spices except for the red pepper (by the way, I used 1/4 tsp ground cloves and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon), I used one large onion, and I used the liquid from only one of the cans of chickpeas and drained the other can.

I did not like this at all. I put half the amount of cayenne pepper in and it was just right for the hot part. But somehow, the it tasted bland. My spices are fresh and I love curries. This is not worth the effort. I will try to fix this dish as i feel bad to throw it out...

This is coming from a person who makes curried chickpeas in a lot of ways and has been eating since childhood. Try lime juice to add tartness to this and yes, please add some more spices.

Ok, I feel bad giving this a 3 but It's just not very good without adding your own alterations.  I made the recipe "as is" and was NOT happy with the flavour.  After adding Curry, potato, sweet potato, salt, and a couple Tbl. of heavy cream.  It was good enough to eat.  Still not mind blowing.  Great base though.  Thank you  Served with "Indian Saffron Rice" & Naan both recipes found on this site as well... TRY THE NAAN!  It's easy and TASTY!!

Delicious!  I agree with those reviewers who said this is the right amount of spices if you use fresh (and freshly ground.)  Highly recommend buying a $20 spice grinder, makes a big difference for dishes like thsi.  I also added a couple potatoes (steamed and cut into 1"-2" cubes) and it added some nice texture alterations.  Only weird thing was biting into a whole clove or piece of cinnamon - I'd recommend crushing the cinnamon to the point that the pieces are quite small and taking the cloves out after cooking.

I followed others suggestion and added canned tomatoes.  This is excellent with the Kiwi Raita recipe, which is a complement to the spiciness.

I love curry and the combination of spices in this recipe made for a very nicely spiced dish.  I added two small tomatoes, a thinly sliced Yukon Gold potato and the only other thing I did differently was to rinse and drain the chickpeas (only 1 can!) but add a 5.5 oz can of tomato juice to substitute for the liquid and lend some additional color and flavor to the dish.   I let it simmer the 20 minutes that the rice was cooking. No additional thickener required.  When I reheated the leftovers, I added more liquid (just water), about a tsp of purchased curry powder, and a handful of raisins.  The more this simmers and the flavors blend, the better it is!

This is absolutely spectacular. I've made it numerous times for friends, potlucks,and just myself. When I make it for myself, For those who like the spicier side of things, just add more, especially cumin. Even more importantly for me, it's easy!

This was a GREAT healthy recipe!!  I followed the recipe exactly to form a base for the rest of the dish.  I allowed the curry to cook for the 20min it took to make the rice.  I added chunks of carrot, and some tomato wedges for the last 15min.  Served with fresh tomato, which was seriously necessary because this was insanely HOT!!  Next time, I'm going to start with 1/4tsp of cayenne, then add to taste.

This was very tasty.  I did not have onion, so used a combonation of carrots and celery.  I also did not have the cilantro, so used the celery greens.  I served this over brown rice.  The next time I think I'll add a can of diced tomatoes and a dollop of plain yogurt on the top.

This recipe is a very good base.  I think next time though, I'll add some tomatoes and potatoes.  I love chickpeas, but it just seemed to lack something.  Also, I like things spicy, so I'll probably increase the heat a bit.  Thanks for sharing and thanks for reading!

so yummy! I added chopped green apples and a pear as well; the tartness and sweetness of the fruit brightens up the chickpeas. I also usually add about double the cinnamon and the curry. I second whoever reviewed who said the cilantro is a must. I add it just before I serve the curry, and the one time I didn't, a layer of flavour was definetely missing. This has become a staple recipe for me. Inexpensive and so tasty!

This is amazing. I was skeptical at first, but both my husband and I were like "wow!" I recommend using less pepper unless you like REALLY spicy food. I think about 1/3 t is perfect for us. I did slightly modify it- only one can of ckickpeas and I added one large chopped chicken breast as well as one can chopped tomatoes. I'm going to make it again this week! Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

I used ground ginger, cloves, and cinnamon as other reviewers recommended. I also drained the chickpeas and added some water. My spices were all fresh from the store, too. After tasting and finding it bland, I added some smoked salt and chicken bouillon. I would have added fish sauce, too, if I could find mine- it’s disappointingly lacking in umami.

This is quite good.  I followed the recipe exactly with a few minor changes...I used Extra Virgin Olive Oil instead of Vegetable Oil; 1-Tsp Ground Ginger instead of Ginger Root; 1/2-Tsp Ground Cloves instead of Whole Cloves and 1-Tsp Ground Cinnamon instead of Cinnamon Sticks.  Let it simmer for about 45 minutes.  Served it over White Rice.  This dish is definitely a keeper.

Very tasty. Different and special, but "friendly" enough that my 89 year-old grandmother took seconds too! The smells it fills the house with are wonderful also. If you'd like to try using the cinnamon sticks, break them up a bit and then put them in a pint mason jar and add your blender attachment. Whirl until fine. The aroma when you do this is incredible. I also agree: fresh spices are a MUST for this. If you don't regularly cook with cumin and turmeric, it's very likely that yours are too old.

Soooo delicious!!! I'm not sure what some of the reviewers are talking about when they say this has no flavor. I made a few adjustments. I added 1/2 cup of coconut milk, and I added 2 medium sized potatoes and it was excellent. I didn't have coriander salt, but the recipe still came out very delicious. Also, I added a little of bit of brown sugar because the cayenne pepper was a bit overwhelming. Next time I would cut back to about 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper, I love spicy food, but this was just too much, but the brown sugar helped tone it down. Thanks for the recipe!

I subbed carrots for 1/2 the potatoes, used crushed tomatoes and coconut milk (as suggested by other reviewers) instead of soup. I had half a bag of peas in the freezer and threw them in... finally, I doubled the spices! YUM! Everyone loved it. Best curry at our house yet.

While frying the onions, I added a package of fresh sliced mushrooms that I needed to use up.  When the curry was done, I still was not completely satisfied with the ingredients or the flavor, so I threw in a can of diced italian style tomatoes.  The tomatoes seemed to add a ton of flavor and color, and "held" the beans together better.  I served it over brown rice cooked in chicken stock, with naan bread and baby greens as sides.  Yummmmy!.......

While I loved this recipe, my boyfriend  raved about the flavor but told me he didn't love the consistency of the garbanzos, and would enjoy it more if they were mashed up.  Has anyone ever tried softening or mashing the chickpeas in this recipe?

Wonderful recipe!  This was my first attempt at Indian cooking.  I did use the ground cinnamon and cloves, as suggested.  I also used some ginger-garlic paste that I purchased at an Indo-Pak. grocery store instead of the ginger and garlic.  It tasted even better the next day!  Great with a salad and brown rice.

These taste great, but chomping down on big pieces of cloves or cinnamon is not so fun. I recommned just using ground cloves and ground cinnamon, or going to the trouble of removing the cloves and cinnamon stick pieces yourself. Also, you might want to drain some of the chickpea liquid to make it thicker. But again, tastes great!

It's good. I added some yellow curry powder, which I think improved the taste a lot; made it "warmer." I didn't love that this recipe used the chick pea can liquid, as it's so high in sodium, but I think using water instead would make for a much runnier dish. However, because of this, I completely avoided adding any salt, and still found it pretty salty. In my opinion, the recipe "Cholay" on this site is better, but this is pretty good. The fresh corriander really makes this.

This recipe is excellent.  I used a whole chopped jalapeno pepper to kick it up.  I also used ground cinammon.  I don't like cilantro so I used regular parsley.  I also went on the web and found out that the two cans would equal about 2 cups of fresh chickpeas which I found to be better since I like to avoid the sodium in the canned beans.  Absolutely delicious and I will make it again and again.

Loved it.  I took most of the previous suggestions - omitted chickpea can water, added a can of diced tomatoes with juice, used ground cinnamon instead of sticks.  Next time I'll add a little more water or tomatos to make it saucier.  I also only used 1/4 tsp cayenne.

I found this was really really dry. I don't know what went on here. For overall flavour it was lovely, but as far as texture goes, it was a flop. I think I would have to serve it was something saucy to compensate... or maybe add a lot more water or liquid... I think I drained the beans, and replaced the bean water with normal water to avoid the canny flavour, maybe that's where i messed up. Still, great taste!

This is an extremely easy recipe to make.  I drained & rinsed the chickpeas however, because their "liquid" looks just nasty.  It tastes much better on the second day, as the flavors have time to really saturate the food.  It's excellent with a dollup of plain yogurt (or sour cream) mixed in!

This was my first attempt at making anything even remotely Indian. In place of the ginger, cloves, coriander, and turmeric, I added 1 Tbsp. of curry powder. I also added a cup of raisins during the last five minutes of cooking. This came out AMAZING! I will make this again and again!

Delicious and I'm rating it five stars with the following changes - for us it was too salty - will cut back on salt and I also added a can of drained diced tomatoes.  I ended up boiling it to reduce the amt of liquid.  Next time I will add a little less of the juice from the can of beans.  Thanks Aminah.  Update - we had some leftover and when I went to taste it cold the next day - I couldn't stop eating it.  It's good hot but a keeeeeper as a cold salad too!!!

Very good!!! Tasted like indian food at the best restaurants.
I used dried chickpeas, and when cooking added 4 medium tomato, spinich and 2 cups water (since beans were drained after cooking and I love a saucier end product) to copy my favorite dish at a restaurant.... it was identical! If adding water I suggest simmering for 25 minutes until sauce thickens. Went well served over basmati rice and the naan recipe submitted by "mic".

This was such a wonderful dish!  I would never have thought that I could make something that tasted so much like it came from a restaurant. It was so simple - don't let the list of spices make you think that it is more difficult than it is!

I added defrosted & drained chopped leaf spinach at the end with the cilantro.  Very tasty and filling over rice!  Will make this over and over!

This is lovely!  But, two onions???  I used one and it was the perfect balance.  Two seems overpowering.  I also let it simmer for about 20 minutes.  This blends the flavors and the sauce thickens, especially as it cools.  It's so simple!  This is one I will master and I will please all my dinner guests from this day forward!!!

Great recipe, simple to make and wonderful to eat all week for lunch! I cut the cinnamon sticks amount in half on the advice of a reviewer and I still thought it was a bit much, especially when I came upon the crushed pieces of cinammon while eating. Would ground cinammon be a reasonable substitution, and does anyone have a suggestion on how much?
Thanks!

This recipe is fantastic!  Easy to make, delicious, and filling... with a couple of cans of chickpeas and a well-stocked spice rack you're ready to go.  My boyfriend is a spice wimp, so I halved the cayenne pepper to temper it for more mild tastebuds.  This dish will definitely curb your craving for curry.

Very delicious.  Indian food does require an aquired taste to mose Americans though.  Definately use fresh chickpeas if at all possible. I serve it with naan or roti.

Quick and easy for this busy mom. I’m always on the lookout for healthy recipes that take less than an hour. I’ll be adding this to my rolodex. My husband loves coming home to the smell of food and as soon as he walked in he said “something smells great”.

This is so good! I did add chicken with the onions and served it over rice. I ended up using home cooked Garbanzo beans. Be sure to add the liquid you cooked them in so the dish isn't dry. Otherwise, I didn't change anything. I will be adding this quick yummy meal to my weeknight repertoire!

Gave this recipe a try last night, and I am very pleased. I made it for my mother. I drained most of the canned chick peas liquid. From both cans total, I'd say that I only used about 1 cup of liquid. I did this to cut back on sodium. I also used 1- 1 1/2 tablespoons of curry instead of turmeric. I used one dash of cayenne pepper. And I also added fresh cherry tomatoes into this dish. And I didn't use an coriander or salt. Recipe was good :)

This is a a easy, quick recipe but I found it to be on the bland side. I'm used to Indian food so maybe I just need more spices in my food - that is a very individual aspect.

I made this recipe with a few differences due to what I had on hand.  I soaked a pound of dried chickpeas in water overnight, then cooked in water on low in the crockpot the next day while at work.  I drained most of the water off them, then followed the recipe except I didn't have stick cinnamon or whole cloves.  I used the following conversions:

1 tsp ground cinnamon for each stick
1/2 tsp ground cloves = 6 whole

Given that I used a whole pound of chickpeas, I doubled all spices.  I did omit the cayenne and used a slight sprinkling of some ground red pepper (which may be the same a cayenne, but it's old so not as hot lol)  I also added one can of petite diced tomatoes in juice.

This is one of the most amazing recipes I've ever used.  The smell and taste is amazing!!!

I liked this recipe, but did make a couple of changes.  I used white kidney beans when I realized I didn't have any chickpeas.  I found it a bit too spicy for the kids so I added half a can of coconut milk and a cup of peas.

My husband first made this a few months back and now we have it almost once a week! It's super easy once you have all the spices on hand. I do add a can of undrained tomatoes to make it saucier.

A huge hit with us!  My husband and I loved it.  The only change I made was I substituted whole cloves and cinnamon with their ground counterparts.  I also added 8 oz of tomato sauce just to give it another layer.  I might add potatoes next time.  Delicious!!

I was looking for something simple, tasty, cheap, and would last me a good amount of time (I'm a left over person). I read way too many reviews but bunched together what i thought were the best and created something fantastic. I doubled the coriander and cumin and used a little less than 2 tsp ground cinnamon instead of sticks. I also added 1 tsp chaat masala and a 15 oz can of diced tomatoes (with sauce) with the garbanzo beans. I threw in potatoe flakes at the end to thicken the sauce. Put it on top of my curry rice recipe. Wonderful.

This recipe is great.  The spices for the curry flavor can be used on a variety of other foods and vegetables as well.  Generally speaking, I only use about half of the turmeric.  Otherwise, it has too much of that chalky taste.  Also, feel free to add other vegetables when you add the chickpeas.  Chopped fresh green beans works well.  You might want to add 1/4 cup chicken broth to give it more liquid if you do.

It turned out beautiful looking with the perfect liquid consistency.  But, the red pepper was completely overpowering.  I used some sour cream to tone down the heat and ate it with Naan bread. I also agree that there is something missing.  I will probably try it again using a different recipe.

This was my first go at making an Indian dish and I was not disappointed. As per other reviews, I drained the canned chickpeas and subbed in a can of diced tomatoes, and I threw in a couple handfuls of baby spinach. I also used 1/2 tsp of cinnamon as opposed to crushing sticks. Next time I may use ground cloves instead of whole. I picked out all but one before I served it (I found the last one in my bowl halfway through eating it). Since other reviewers commented on the level of spiciness, I cut the cayenne pepper in half just to be safe. I asked my husband afterwards what he thought and he said that next time I should use the full amount. We both enjoy spicy food, so it may not be for everyone. I served the curry over basmati rice (I also found that recipe on this site) and it was delicious! My husband is a picky eater and he really enjoyed it, and he even got to the leftovers before I did!

I give this 4 stars with the addition of fresh chopped tomatoes. The liquid from the tomatoes also helps the chickpeas cook longer and stay moist. Doesn't even really need the fresh cilantro. The broken up cinnamon stick is spicy! I also like the addition of the whole clove. I used ginger powder because I didn't have the fresh ginger but will use it next time. I added some mild green chilies from my garden although it doesn't really need it, with the cayenne pepper giving it heat.Thanks, a good curry base I can use with other things. I like to eat Indian-style chickpeas with store-bought tandoori naan that I heat up on my gas stove using the open flame and tongs, then spread with butter. Trader Joe's has a decent naan,and even our Safeway imports a decent one. Our best naan-type bread is homemade (secret recipe) from our nearby Lebanese restaurant! They call it pita but it tastes like naan.

Unfortunately I am really not a fan of this one...it is so dry! I kept looking back at the recipe thinking I missed an ingredient or something but no.  I will not be remaking this.

This was a very tasty base recipe for a chickpea curry. I wish I would have read these reviews first so that I would have omited the crushed cinnamon sticks.  Im not a big cook but either I didnt crush them enough or that was just a bad suggestion. I keep picking tough pieces of the cinnamon out of it as I eat it. Besides that this is super yummy! I will try it again and next time will not be using the cinnamon sticks.

As much as we like spicy food, one teaspoon of cayenne pepper was too much for this recipe.  It overpowered the other spices.  I would make it again by using 1/2 tsp.

I really love this recipe. I leave out the cilantro and add all the other spices powdered.  Today I used allspice instead of coriander, and accidently used a sweet onion.  It was really good.  With a food processor to chop the onion, and canned chickpeas, it's easier than pasta!  (I also serve over rice.)

Very good and simple to make but SPICY!  Next time I will halve the cayenne.  It's deceiving though... it doesn't smell spicy while cooking.  My youngest doesn't like spicy food but ate it well by adding a spoonful of sour cream.  I mixed my leftovers well with rice and that helped the next day (either didn't have enough rice with it the night before or didn't mix it well enough).  Loved the flavor and ease of preparation.  Will probably make it again since I have enough of bulk purchased seasoning left over.

This is so simple and outstanding. I added two roma tomatoes from our garden chopped up. Used three cans of chickpeas. Doubled all the spices except the cayenne (1/4tspn). I've made it three days in a row! It's that good. Would be great with spinach, cooked potatoes or paneer too!

This dish was very tasty and pretty easy, even for someone like me who had never made curry before. However, I didn't get it perfect the first time. I didn't taste any clove flavor, except when I accidentally bit into one. (I'll use ground cloves next time.) I thought the cilantro was a little too strong, although nobody else seemed to mind. And I left out the chickpea "juice" per a suggestion here, but that made it too dry and not saucy enough, so I had to add water. Other substitutions worked quite well: instead of 1 tsp of cayenne, I used 1/2 tsp of chili paste, which was enough heat for me, but a fire-breathing pepper fiend might want a full teaspoon. I substituted 1 & 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon for the cinnamon sticks. I also added a bunch of ground black pepper to enhance the flavor, a modification I strongly recommend.

Just finished making this! I didn't know one of my favorite foods would be so easy to make! I found it a bit too spicy for my taste, but I just mixed in some sour cream and was fine.

I will be mixing all the spices together and placing in a small spice jar for ease of making next time

Definitely need to double the spices in this dish.  I used powdered ginger instead of fresh and cardamom as well, cut the cayenne pepper way down and added green peppers and fresh mushrooms.  Made this one a ton of times; it's quick, it's easy, it's versatile, and it's nutritious!

I liked it. I served it with potatoes which is a mistake since the chickpea has the same consistency as potato. They just soaked all the flavor up. So next time I'll serve with rice.

This is by far one of my favourite recipes of all time!  After the first time I made it I wondered how I spent so much money on Indian take-out!  The only changes I make are to leave out the cilantro and to add 1/2 can diced tomatos.  We have this regularly now and the ingredients are a staple in our house!

Simple, easy, and delicious. Subbed ground cinnamon and coriander seeds, because that's what we had. Also, I cook dried beans, so I added the equivalent of two cans and some water. Served with plain yogurt and whole wheat pita. Thanks!

I like this recipe. I am a big indian food lover. So I fix this every chance I get. I add tomatoes and serve this over brown rice. I also, add some chicken broth to the dish to give it some liquid content, so that it is not so dry.

Yum! My sister is a vegetarian and doesn't cook, so if she ever wants something home-made.. she comes to my home. We all liked this, even us meatier types... I did take the advice others gave though, and added tomatoes and their juice instead of the canned garbanzo liquid.

I would rate this as good.  Had very good flavor!  I didn't crush the cinnamon, but just broke up and took out the pieces when we ate it.  Were we suppose to eat the cinnamon sticks?

I make this close to once a week and it's easily my favorite dinner. I use 1 tsp ground cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of ground cloves as other reviewers had mentioned. I usually leave out the cayenne for my 4 year old and will add it at the end on my plate only. Also add a can of diced tomatoes. I keep some ginger in my freezer just for this recipe. It's pretty cheap and keeps forever in the freezer. Thanks to Alton Brown for that tip. This is absolutely delicious!!

I LOVE Indian food.  Its my favorite food and I have been making Chana Masala myself with my own recipe for a few years now.  I thought I would try somebody else's recipe.  Honestly, this was not good and I thought it would have to be better than mine as so many people have reviewed it with good remarks.  I will say the flavors are ok, but standard.  The real problem is its too dry.  There are no tomatoes in the recipe which you usually find in Chana Masala.

Big fan of this recipe!  Had an intense craving for Indian this morning, and I love chickpeas, so this was the way to go, and I don't regret it!  I didn't have coriander or tumeric on hand so omitted them, as well as the cilantro at the end (I was so eager to try it, I forgot till I was already halfway done with it).  Added appx. 1/2 tsp yellow curry powder, which gave it an extra nice kick.  Warning: Use the cayenne to taste - everyone's preferences for spice are different.  I probably would have used 1/2 the amount: my face is still burning.

It was ok...maybe the beans should stew for a big longer. I also had to add a lot more spices and about 4x more garlic.

To use dry chickpeas instead of canned you will need to boil them for about 5 mins, discard the water, soak overnight, then cook in a pressure cooker for about ten mins.    1/2 tsp of gauram masala added just prior to serving makes a nice touch.

I'd give this a 4.5, really.  It was very good, even my hubby ate it, and he's most definitely NOT into beans of any sort.  I served it over Jasmine rice, since that's what I had on hand. (Basmati rice would be more authentic).  I did have to change the spices, since I didn't have all of them.  So, I skipped the seasonings from the ginger on down, and used about 2 Tbs. of Rogan Josh seasoning from Penzey's Spices. (check them out!!)  It's a blend of paprika, garlic, ginger, cumin, coriander, black pepper, cayenne pepper, cinnamon, cardamom, cloves and saffron.  It was a very authentic Indian taste, and a nice bite to it. (not something I could give my kids, unfortunately)  I'm sure, looking at the ingredient list, that it was pretty close to what the original recipe would taste like.

This is delicious!  I made half the recipe because I didn’t think my kids would like it.  After eating their food, they devoured what was left of this dish.  My daughter asked me to make it again tomorrow.  I ate this with a salad and it made a filling meal.  This will become a regular in our home.

My rooommate and I love this recipe. It's fast and simple. I cut down prep time by mixing the spices together first. I've made this for an every day meal and for a dinner party. We can't get enough.

If it were possible, I'd give this recipe 4 1/2 stars because I thought the flavor was was great, but I added alot of extra ingredients. Baked sweet and Yukon gold potatoes, a can of diced tomatoes, green and yellow peppers and some red pepper flakes.  It was delish, but not exactly the same recipe anymore...

This is my 3rd time making this curry and I think its great!  I followed everyone elses recommendation to double, if not, treble the spices used(to tell you the truth I sprinkled spice til it acquired enough for my taste). I added half a vegetarian vegetable bouillon and also added some garam marsala just for the extra "zing".  Another recommendation for all the vegetarians out there that aren't keen on chickpeas.  Try soy chunks!!  It works!

Great and easy recipe. I have a channa masala recipe that is similar in taste to this but requires many more spices (and is therefore more expensive to make). I made no changes to this at all, but I do suggest grating the ginger instead of chopping it. Using a parmesan cheese grater works really well. And if you're looking for this as a main dish (great served over brown rice), it won't be enough for 8 people, so you'll want to adjust it a bit.

Just made this curry! Finally a recipe that comes out good..even with using canned garbanzo beans. This dish truly was a delight! Easy to make and tasted great with white rice or naan.

Following the other reviews, I added a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes and doubled the spices. It always impresses! I serve it with either rice or naan. A dollop of yogurt cools it just enough for those not used to the spice.

This was really good, and really fast, great for a week night. The only thing I did differently was to double or more the spices (as a matter of preference) and add a little garam masala towards the end. I will definitely be making this again soon!

I've never made a curry in my life before, until this one, and I have to say, it tastes great. Exactly what I think a curry should taste like. It's probably very easy to add meat to it as well.
I do like spicy food, and this one really was.

OMG, this was really spicy!  I'm usually pretty tolerant of spicy food but this was a bit much, even when served over rice.  Adding 1 can of diced tomatoes really improved this dish, adding more depth and texture to it.  Next time I'll try to add more veggies.  But overall, a very good base that can be easily built upon.

I just made this and it is THE best!!!  SO much flavor and SO inexpensive to make.  A great addition for any starving students who want something delicious and easy.   I will DEFINITELY add this to my favorites.  I loved the spices just as the recipe called for.  If you're not sure for yourself, do smaller amounts and then add more according to your own taste.  It's a keeper!

This was great!  It is very spicy, I would recommend cutting back on the cayenne.  I also don’t think I crushed the cinnamon well enough.  We didn’t like the texture of the cinnamon pieces.  I think next time I’ll just use ground cinnamon and ground cloves instead of whole.  Since there are only two of us I made a ½ recipe but I wish I would have made the whole thing and frozen half for a quick meal down the road.  I served it over rice and it was great.  It would also be good with naan or pita.  I also thought it would be great mixed with rice and served cold as a salad.  We definitely loved this and will make it often.

Update: I just tried this again with 1/8 tsp of each ground cinnamon & ground clove and now it's a 5 star!

This is a great recipe for Chickpea curry allthough it is very spicy, I added some plain yoghurt to tone it down a tad.  I also added some left over cold chicken to the dish.  Served with Nan bread and brown rice.  Plenty for the next day which I thought had a better flavour.

Great recipe!  I subbed curry powder (Javin Brand...the best!) for the spices, skipped the ginger, and added fresh carrots and canned peas.  A good vegetarian recipe that even my carnivorous fiance devoured over rice.  Surprisingly, this was also good cold, as I brought it to school but didn't have a microwave to heat it up!

Excellent vegetarian recipe that even my children enjoy. Friends have commented that it brought them back to their childhood and reminded them of "Mom's cooking". I decreased the amount of onions and added bell peppers, eggplant and zucchini. Also added a teaspoonful of Madras curry. Will definitely be making this again.

This recipe was so good that after I finished it up I decided to make it again.  My only complaint is that it's a bit on the spicy side, and I love spicy food.  It was too spicy for my boyfriend to eat, so he wasn't able to have any.  The second time I made it I used ground cinnamon rather than grinding my own.  Even though I put the sticks in the food processor to crush them, they still had chunks of stick in them.

I made this recipe exactly as stated with the exception of using 1 tsp cinnamon in place of the cinnamon stick. I'm not sure what I did wrong, but it didn't come out very good. The spices were so overpowering that they canceled each other out and it tasted very bitter over all.

Very tasty. Based on suggestions from previous reviewers, we substituted a teaspoon of cinnamon for the stick, halved the cayenne pepper, and minced half of the chickpeas to give the meal a bit more texture.

Served with brown rice, and quite tasty! This will definitely be on our rotation.

Delicious and SO EASY curry!!  As one reviewer mentioned, try to use spices which have not been in your cabinet for eons for maximum flavor. Try adding a can of drained tuna, a can of drained diced tomatoes, or a can of diced potatoes (or any combination of those) for some extra weight!

This is a quick and healthy meal that tastes great.   I added finely chopped potatoes with the onions, and added some chicken to make it more hearty.  The potatoes give a nice texture and flavor.  Also, if you don't have all of the seasonings- some of them are less common for the average American cook, and I can't find them in Taiwan- you can just put curry powder in place of the tumeric, coriander, cayenne pepper and cumin and it still turns out delicious (although I'm sure using all of the fresh seasonings as the recipe calls for is better).

I made this recipe exactly as written minus the cilantro and we just loved it! I served it over plain rice because that's all I had, but I'll try another variety next time. I need fresher spices to give this more taste, and will buy some now that I found a good recipe to use them in!!

Will definitely be making this again!  I've been looking for an easy curry recipe, and this one really is good.  I blended about half of the garbanzo beans with a hand blender towards the end of cooking for a creamier texture.  I even cheated on some of the spices and it was still delish!  Thanks!

I thought it was ok. My boyfriend really didn't like it at all. I thought the flavors needed more depth, it was hot but there was no layering of flavors. If I made it again I'd add a tablespoon of sugar, potatoes, and some meat to make it more interesting.

I made this last night and it was very, very tasty, and pretty. I added some tomatoes to it like someone else said they did. It was so good, I'm making some more for potluck at church tomorrow! Its a keeper!

My husband and I are big Indian food fans, so we had to try this. It was pretty easy to make, and tasted great. We doubled most of the spices though; the flavor of the original recipe was a little subtle for us. Delicious over basmati rice!

First of all, let me say that this was a good one overall, but I couldn't find chili paste anywhere! I used chili sauce instead and I do not recommend it.  The sauce tasted like ketchup with a tiny bit of kick to it.  To make up for the lacking paste, I added some red pepper, chili powder and cumin, probably 1 t., 1/2 t. and 1/2 t. respectively.  The sauce smelled so good, but I was disappointed at the lack of flavor.  I'm sure the chili paste would have remedied that a bit.  I pressed, froze and pan seared my tofu before adding it.  Also, I cooked all of the other ingredients together for about 15 minutes so that the tofu could soak up the flavor and added the bok choy for only about final 3 minutes.  It was still a tad crunchy that way.  This is a keeper, but next time, I'm going to spice it up!

WOW! What a great recipe! I substituted 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon for sticks, ground ginger for fresh and added dried coriander (sprinkled to my liking) as these are what I had on hand. I let everything cook together for approx. 10-15 or until most of the liquid was absorbed and served over white rice. Will definitely be making this again - thank you for sharing.

This was really good for a quick lunch, but  it seemed to *need* something.  I even added cumin seed and extra garlic to give it more depth of flavor.  It was pretty thick too.  I may add some water to the leftovers, and simmer it covered for an hour to see what happens.  Also, the recipe calls for WAY too much cayenne IMO, I used about half the recommended amt, and it was a tad too spicy when eaten with rice.  I'm not a weenie when it comes to spicy food either!

Way too much cinnamon and chickpeas for my personal taste. Cut back to 1/2 tsp. Next time, will only use 1 can of beans but keep the rest the same. Took the advice and drained the liquid from the beans and substitute with approximately 2 cups of water. Added already cooked chicken. For some reason, my turned out a bit watery, so added a bit of cornstarch to thicken it up. Otherwise, tastes very similar to what i get in a resturant!

This is so delicious and EASY! I like it with chickpeas or with petite green peas. It's a good meal to make when we're tired of meat. I always reduce the amount of cayenne pepper to taste.

This dish was good. Even better on the second day as leftovers.  I think I will cut back on the cayenne pepper next time.  I like spicy but it was a little too much for me!  Would taste good with potatoes!

Tried to crush the cinammon sticks and ended up having to pick them all out while eating...would not crush them rather cook them whole and pull them out at the end. This was very good though! I enjoyed the spice! Will definately make again and maybe add some chicken or broccoli.

this was delicious. i only used some of the liquid from the peas, using mostly vegetable broth instead. also, i substituted ground cinnamon for the cinnamon sticks, and omitted the cumin because i forgot to pick it up at the store. everything turned out just fine. i'm definitely making this again.

The flavors in this have great potential, but it does need a few changes.  I scaled it down to four, and used 1/2 tsp cinnamon (instead of a stick) and 1/4 tsp ground cloves (instead of 3 whole).  This turned out to be too much cloves - the entire kitchen was filled with the smell of cloves which sent my boyfriend and me to the other room until we opened a window and let it air out a bit.  Also, instead of using the liquid from the can (gross!), I added about 1/4 cup tomato sauce.  It still ended up a little bit dry, so I'll probably up that to 1/2 cup next time.  But the tomato was a great addition - I highly recommend it.  The dish was *really* spicy too, so next time I'll only use 1/4 tsp cayenne (instead of 1/2).

This was very good.  I made it with the Chicken Mahkani from this site.  The only thing I did different was before I added the cilantro I put about half of the recipe into the food processor and processed into a thick puree which I added back to the other half of the recipe and then added the cilantro.   This gave it more texture than just whole chick peas.  All we were missing was some naan bread! Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is pretty good, but when I was done with it, I didn't feel like it was totally authentic.  I added a couple tablespoons of crushed tomatoes & a couple tablespoons of plain yogurt...and a dash of garam masala...that gave it the consistency and flavor I was looking for.

This recipe was a big hit with the friends I had over for dinner, and I thought it was great.  It could have had a little more of a spicy kick for my taste, but all in all it was mighty tasty. Also worth mentioning, I have a few friends that don't like cilantro so I left the cilantro out of a portion of the curry and those friends still really seemed to like the recipe even though it was missing a seemingly vital ingredient.

Excellent. I didn't have cloves, but other than that it was made to the recipe. Very good! Next time I would use powdered cinammon rather than the cinammon sticks.

My husband really liked this.  I thought it was good- but not great.  I don't think it was the recipe, I just really don't like chicpeas.  I rinced the peas and added chickenstock.  The fresh cilantro was great.  Maybe add more garlic.

I really can't rate this recipe as its written because I just used it to see what kind of spices should be used. That said I used 1/2 tsp dried ginger, 1/4 tsp ground cloves, 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon,2 tsp cumin, 1 tsp coriander,1/4 tsp cayenne, 1 tsp turmeric,1/4 tsp curry, 19 oz can of chickpeas drained, a hand full of chopped cilantro, an undrained can of diced tomatoes, 2tsp of thai chili garlic sauce, and a squirt of ketchup (was out of tomato paste) let it simmer until the juice had reduced.......and it was heaven

Was a little disappointed in this.  It was allright, but not something that we would clamor for again.  It tasted a bit flat to us, not sure why.. But added some lemon juice which really helped.

A good simple meal! I halved the recipe, didn't use cinnamon because I didn't think that I would like the sweetness, and added a can of diced tomatoes.  One thing I did not like was that I had to watch for the cloves...it wasn't pleasant biting into one.

Awesome recipe, tastes very authentic. I drained chickpeas and used a can of diced tomatoes and halved cayenne pepper as others suggested. Took this to a potluck and received great reviews there! Quick to make. Great all around.

The recipe is good as is.  Its better with a tomato added.  Also, if you render the liquid down and thicken it, it makes an incredible sauce.

I loved this curry but changed it slightly. I halved the recipe and used water rather than the liquid from the can. I also added 1 very ripe tomatoe, 1 cup of mixed veg. and some raisins. I really liked the raisins in it.

This was good, but felt like it needed something. It was spicy, yet bland, which I'm not sure how that can happen. I didn't have turmeric, but had all the other spices (used 1 tsp of ground cinnamon instead of sticks), including the fresh cilantro. I used just one large onion. I drained most of the liquid from the beans and added a can of diced tomatoes. I served it over brown rice, and it was good, but not something I'd rush to make again. My husband thought he made his portion better by adding barbeque sauce, but I don't know about that!

This is easy to make and tastes excellent !!Recently I've been to an Indian grocery shopping and happened to have a variety of spice.(If you live NYC, go 29th street at Lexington. There are some good Indian grocery stores.) I added caraway seed which added even deeper aroma to this dish.

This is a great recipe! I added the cinnamon sticks cut in half and removed them before eating, but otherwise followed recipe exactly. Perfect blend of spices. Will double recipe next time.

This was a great, quick recipe that I made a few changes to.  I drained the chickpeas and added a can of chopped tomatos, instead.  It really added to the flavor.  Plus, I added more cayanne and cumin.  In all, it came out great and tasted just like the curry that is served in an English pub.  Yum.

This was really good, and great for leftovers the next day. But I recommend not adding all the cayenne pepper! Half will do, unless you want it reallly spicy!

Had great potential with all of the fragrant and tasty spices.  Unfortunately it was especially spicy to the point of excess and was too soupy.  Went well with rice though.

this was really easy and fast.  i used quite a bit less cayenne, and i think 1 tsp. is too much salt.  i'd use 1/2 tsp. salt next time.  but it's a good recipe.  the cilantro should definitely be included.

Was delicious even using canned chickpeas, dried cilantro, and omitting the tumeric and coriander, neither of which I happened to have on hand.  Try it on a bed of basmati rice alongside chicken tika!

Overall I thought this recipe was pretty good! My partner loved it, and it's a great option for if you're trying to cut back on meat a little like we are! I used a lot less onion than what was called for, and added half a bell pepper. I also used ground cinnamon instead of crushing up cinnamon sticks.

I didn't follow a lot of reviewers' suggestion about omitting the chickpea water, and I wish I had. It was really thin and runny, although cornstarch thickened it slightly and the rice soaked it up. I might experiment with coconut milk next time.I would also suggest leaving out the ground coriander if you choose to mix in the cilantro- way too much coriander taste with both! Despite being overpowered at times by coriander, I thought the rest of the spices were balanced out nicely.

The cloves whole is not a good idea because you bite into it and it tastes horrible. The Cayenne pepper they called for was too much for this dish it made it spicy. Well try to make it again but without cloves and cayenne peppers.

Found this pretty bland, i often cook curries and have a good source for fresh spices. A bit like eating just a tin of chickpeas. However i liked that it can be cooked as a very quick snack.

Yes, I made this dish, but I did not follow the recipe exactly. Here are the modifications I made:
1. The recipe does not call for curry powder, so I added 1 tbsp of it.
2. The recipe calls for 2 onions. I would not recommend using 2 onions for only 2 cans of beans, it would be too much. I only used one onion and that was PLENTY.
3. I would never use the juice from canned food for anything. I drained the beans, rinsed them, and peeled the outer layer off before putting them in the pot to cook. Instead of using the can juice, I used 1 cup of vegetable broth.
4. I used 1 tbsp of ground cinnamon instead of 2 sticks. I'm not a huge fan of cinnamon.
5. I did not use cloves because the store didn't have them.

With these modifications, the dish came out absolutely delicious!

This was great! I like a soupy Chickpea curry, so added a can of chopped tomatoes and I also like it spicy, so did heaping measurements of everything. Served over Basmati rice and it was perfect. I'm trying to have more meatless days, so this is satisfying and filling and healthy! I'm used to Indian meals taking hours or even days, so this is an awesome recipe for me. Made in after a long day at work at it was easy and delicious. Will be on regular rotation. Thank you!

I make this dish often. 
It is quick and delicious and easy to modify spice levels depending on who I cook it for. I don't love using the water that the chickpeas have been sitting in so I actually rinse them and put a little plain water at the end and cover, which works well for me. I serve it over basmati rice or potatoes.

Super easy & super delicious! Full of flavour! Came out a little too spicy, maybe a tad bit too much cayenne pepper & I added curry powder. I also used canned chickpeas. For me finely chopping the onions was the most time consuming. Will definitely make it again!!

Love how quick this is to put together.  I followed some other reviews, but the versatility of this recipe allows for personal touches. I added broth to allow for a sauce. I did not add the cayenne for dietary reasons and the cinnamon because I was out of it. Who runs out of cinnamon!? It was still very tasty. I cant wait to try again with the cinnamon.

I made this for my vegetarian teenage daughter & she loved it!  I love that is is so high in protein which is something I worry that she doesn’t get enough of.  The only change I made to the recipe was to add 8 ounces of canned tomatoes.

With the exception of the cloves, I doubled the seasoning and added a can of fire roasted tomatoes.  It was good, but it needed something to mellow it out or balance it.  Like maybe some plain yogurt or cream?  Any thoughts?  It was great with rice and naan bread.

didn't like it at all. I love curry (although I have been wondering where the curry in this recipe was), but I guess I am not a big fan of most of the other spices. ill keep it simple next time and just use curry, salt, ginger, garlic and onions

This was excellent and so easy! Followed the recipe except I used ground cinnamon and clove. Going to try it again in the next day or so and add a bit of chicken/vegetable broth as we both felt it could use a bit more liquid (just a dash). Will try some of the other variations mentioned in the future.

Tastes great, and has good flavours. Personally, i like my curries quite hot and this wasn’t. But of course once everything’s mixed, it’s easy enough to taste test and add more cayenne if you wish. Just a note for spicy heat lovers.

My husband liked this. He said though when he thinks if curry he thinks ’saucy’ and it wasn’t hit enough (I went light on the cayenne, didn’t know where to stop!)  he did like it though and he’s not a big fan of chick peas. I thought it was pretty good.  Maybe I’ll try some tomato purée or some coconut milk next time to Sauce it up?

I have made this twice now. The first time it was not very curry like; I used too much of the “sweet” spices. This time it was spicier and I liked it much better. I didn’t use cinnamon sticks or fresh ginger either time; instead I used the dried version of each. Both times I dumped all the liquid out of the cans bc I didn’t read the directions through. So I used 1.5 cups of chicken broth. I will continue to make this recipe !

Used cannellini beans when I discovered I didn't have chickpeas. Also didn't have cilantro, so added a lot of finely chopped fresh spinach. The flavor was very good.

A bit too spicy for my family, but otherwise fantastic.  Very aromatic and pleasing to the eye.  Next time I will reduce the cayenne pepper. by at least half and maybe add paneer for some protein.  I added a dollop of greek yogurt on top to cool the heat a bit.    Also, as I did not have whole cloves, I used about 1/4 tsp ground and substituted about 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon in place of the cinnamon sticks.

I though most people taste their food as they are cooking.  If you start out with a small amount of spice and then increase it to your taste, then you will have a successful dish.  Frankly, 1 tsp. of cayenne pepper is way too much for us.  Hubby does not like really hot foods.  Also, I recommend Kashmiri Mirch chile powder for heat and flavor.  It is somehow better than cayenne.  Put in a small amount of asafoetida for real Indian food flavor.

I made this as directed and thought it was really good. I will double the amount of spices next time. Don't forget to add the cilantro. I served the dish without and realized that I forgot it half way through dinner. It really changed the flavor and made it so much better.

This curry recipe was fantastic.  The curry powder I used was an Indian mix that I purchased in a huge bottle from our local Chinese specialty market.  This turned out very creamy.

This recipe surprised me. I left out the cinnamon but the cloves were such a surprising flavour. It's not too dry as is, but you can add tomatoes to it to give it more substance if you wish.

Very tasty curry base.   I used vegetable broth in place of the chick pea juice.  Cut the cayenne pepper in half and it still had some heat.  Used only one can of chick peas but added equivalent volume of stir-fried cauliflower  then ~1/4 cup frozen peas at the end to add colour.   Served with yogurt {forgot to get naan bread}.  Excellent for lunch the next day too.

I am what one can say a lazy vegan and all I can say is that not only was this dish simple and quick, it was delicious. I am not a professional in the kitchen, but being new to veganism has given me the opportunity to find treasure recipes such as this one...it's rich and all the spices went perfectly together. I added peas to the mix for some color and it was a good choice. One thing I did differently was to use 1/2 tsp of ground cinnamon rather than what the recipe called for. I felt like a was at one of my favorite Indian restaurants. 5 stars for sure!!

Turned out pretty good, served it over rice. Definitely on the super mild side of Indian food, but if you tinker around with the spices then you can fine tune it to the taste you prefer. I ended up adding 1.5x the ginger, cloves, and coriander, and doubled the amount of pepper and cumin. Added a tablespoon of corn starch to help thicken the sauce a bit, and skipped out on the cilantro entirely (my roommate and I are both part of the genetic subgroup that just thinks it tastes like soap). Overall, I'll definitely make it again, it was quick, easy, and tasty.

Made this one and loved it! Added zucchini to it and went lighter on the cayenne (probably half of what was called for). I paired it with a red/wild rice and quinoa. Yummy!

Easy  and quick. I added diced tomatoes for extra flavor and texture. Next time I would reduce the cinnamon by half, it was a bit overwhelming.

Flavor was totally amazing. Been looking for a way to make chick peas that I can really get behind.

As I'm trying to lean towards vegetarian cuisine, and this was a last minute attempt. I added steam carrots as a side. The flavor combination was really surprisingly cohesive. I'd implore you to try it.

This is one of my favorite recipes of all time, and I have been making it for years for my family.  Sometimes, though, the spice as written can be a bit too hot for younger members of my family, so a tablespoon of mild curry blend actually was a better fit for my family than the turmeric, cumin, and coriander.  All other spices I kept exactly the same.
I would wager that those who argue that this is not flavorful enough are being impatient and throwing everything into the pot at once.  Dishes like this need to have the flavored layered.  Don't skip steps.  Also, cilantro takes on a bitter flavor when heated.  I wouldn't add it to the pot at all.  Finally, in our house, this is a complete meal served over jasmine rice and topped with cilantro and a dollop of yogurt.

2015.07.12 - Per other reviewers:  6 whole cloves = 1/2 tsp ground clove, 1 inch cinnamon stick = 1 tsp ground cinnamon, added one can undrained diced tomatoes to 1/2 recipe and drain (homecooked) chickpeas, crushed 1/4 to 1/3 of the chickpeas with a spoon as they cooked.

Left out the cilantro for DBF's sake.  Served with turmeric rice (1.5 cups rice sauteed on medium in 1 Tbs butter for two minutes, add 3/4 tsp turmeric & 1/2 tsp salt, add 3 cups water and simmer approx. 10 minutes (still medium)).

This was okay, but it was a little bland with a good aftertaste.  (No, my spices aren't old.)  Maybe double spices next time and accumulate them in a small bowl as the onions cook.

2015.02.29 - Doubled all dry spices except cayenne (used 1/2 tsp cayenne).  Used 1 tsp salt.  Used butter instead of oil.  Added one can diced tomatoes with juices.  Cooked in ceramic skillet.  Still no cilantro for DBF.

It was too spicy for my tastes, and not enough sauce. I used chicken broth instead of the liquid from the chickpeas, added some cooked chicken and some canned diced tomatoes, which added to the sauce.  Not bad to work with, will tone down some of the spice perhaps.

This is a great curry. I added an extra teaspoon of cayenne pepper since we love spicy food. I also added 2t of Greek double yoghurt. Some ground channa thickens the curry.

Great easy recipe!  I added stewed tomatoes to my mix as I felt it really was missing that something extra.  I also ground my cloves instead of putting them in whole and used ground cinnamon instead of the sticks.

Very flavorful l, however I would ex the whole cloves and use ground cloves, as they can be unpleasant to bite into.

This was very tasty!  I too added fresh tomatoes, drained the chickpeas, and just added a bit of water.  I may use a little less cinnamon next time as it was slightly overpowering (for half the yield I used 0.5 tsp, as recommended by another reviewer).  This will probably be even better tomorrow!  Thank you for posting!

I added extra spices and it didn't turn out right. I added spinach to add some greens. Will try again with vegetable stock and more vegetables.

Delicious!!  I’m new to cooking with curry.  This is my 4th or 5th recipe.  All the others called for curry powder as opposed to adding all the ingredients separately like this one.  What a difference!!  This had way more flavor.  This is my favorite curry recipe so far!

I am definitely going to make it again, but this time, I'm going to rehydrate garbanzo beans, instead of using canned. Somehow, this didn't taste like much and had to add more spice. I'm not counting this recipe out, but if I find it didn't taste any better with fresh chickpeas, I'm done with this recipe!

Plain without the curry powder. So use a dash of it. Cut down the cinnamon & cloves (not a fan).

Found this recipe easy to make... It does need a bit of chilli powder. A more realistic number of servings is about 6. My grad school room mates enjoyed it!!

Whoa. This recipe sounded great to me, but I was a little worried about the entire teaspoon of cayenne I was told to put in. I was going to just cut it to half, but after reading through the other reviews and essentially feeling like I was being called a chicken if I didn't put all the spice in, I decided to show them what's what. Ouch. Maybe it's that my cayenne came fresh right from the organics department, so it had some zing to it, but I ended up adding an extra 15oz of garbanzos to try and soak up the spice. No luck. I'm still hurtin'. So if you've got quality ingredients, and a fainter heart than a Bengal Tiger, you might want to ease off the cayenne just a tad. Otherwise, great!

Great recipe.  we do 'meatless Mondays' and this is perfect! Note: for those in the US (we live abroad) they do sell dry/fresh chickpeas in some parts of the world, so the recipe poster is probably drawing from her own experience.

After all the positive reviews, I was very disappointed in this. The dish had heat but very little flavour. In the end I had to add extra garlic and ginger, a tin of tomatoes, a couple of cardamoms, black pepper and a couple of spoonsful of tikka masala paste I had in the store cupboard for it to be edible.

Easy, tasty, and will make again. Followed the advice of others and used ground cinnamon. I omitted the ground coriander salt as I did not have it, and decreased the amount of cayenne pepper. Next time I probably will add spinach. Planned to take some for lunch, however my family ate it all.

This is such an easy, cheap and fast recipe.  We ate it with rice and salad, and it was delicious!  I also like to make extra, keep in refrigerator, and then serve in a tortilla as a wrap.  Wonderful!  Thank you for this recipe!

I have loved this recipe for years... This version, using individual spices, is the best. I rely on a jarred curry powder like McCormick's - but it is still delicious. The only thing I would add is a diced green bell pepper; I fry it up with the garlic and curry powder.

This came out really well. I modified a few things based on the suggestions from the reviews such as adding tomatoes, adding some curry powder, and using half the cayenne (it was still spicy, but much more tolerable for my taste).   I let it simmer for about 20 minutes so the chickpeas would be really tender and the liquid could reduce and thicken a bit and then I thickened it a little bit further using a cornstarch slurry so the sauce wouldn't be so watery.   As a few others suggested, I prepared the chickpeas tonight to be served tomorrow. If it's yummy today, it will be awesome tomorrow. If you like exotic spices and flavors, then you should definitely give this a try.

I am on the South Beach diet and as near as I can figure this totally fits even in phase 1.  It is so tasty and satisfying that it really helps as one of my diet staples :)

This dish was amazing. Made it into the recipe box in my kitchen. I did have to add chicken b/c my husband freaked a little when I said I was going to make it. But I just sauted the onion, garlic, and I added a little red pepper. Then added the chicken and slow cooked it, and followed the rest of the recipe. Wonderful!!!

Good basic recipe that lends itself to all sorts of variations. My husband does not like chickpeas, but he asked for seconds. I used beans I had soaked and pre-cooked, and added a few scraps of turkey and some sweet corn, but it would have been good even without the additions, I think.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  I used ground cinnamon instead of sticks, I added a tin of tomatoes and some fresh spinach that cooked down.  It was so delicious and tasted very authentic.  I will make this again for sure!

I would cut back on the heat a little. Also, we didn't have coriander, so we used curry powder. It was DELICIOUS.

I love the complexity of the flavors in this recipe! It's easy to prepare and tastes super authentic. As per some other reviews I left the liquid from the beans out and simply pureed some of the chickpeas. Serving it up with a dollop of plain yogurt was a hit with the vegetarian colleagues that I made it for and controlled the spice levels for those who's tastes preferred a milder option.  Thank you for this recipe! :)

I made this a few weeks ago for the family. Everyone loved it! I served it over quinoa and it was super tasty! The spice mixture was PERFECT! One can alter the cilantro or chili content for individual taste and it will still create a lovely dish. I am making this again for tomorrow's dinner!

This recipe was great and easy to make. I made a large batch and served over brown rice. The leftovers were just as delicious. I can't handle cilantro so I omitted it - the curry was still wonderful.

This is pretty good!  I made a smaller batch for myself since I'm the only one home for lunch this afternoon.  I agree that this recipe needs some veggies--I'd definitely add a can of diced tomatoes next time, and maybe add some garam masala to it, but otherwise I find it delicious.  Very easy and quick too!  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this recipe as directed, but added four cooked cubed potatoes and a can of diced tomatoes, just to give it something extra and make it stretch further. I left out the chickpea juice and added chicken broth instead. I made it at night and intended to make rice the next day to go along with it, but it was so good I never got around to making the rice! It tastes better the next day when the flavors have had a chance to blend. Will make again and again, and will try to make the rice at the same time!

Delicious!  I drained the chickpeas before I read the entire recipe.  I added chicken broth for liquid and then a little cream at the end to get more gravy.  It was flavorful, easy to make and my Indian family members loved it.  I served it with rice and Trader Joe's Garlic Naan.

I made this recipe with just two servings, added a diced potato, and a dash of curry powder. I also didn't use the can juice and instead I used 1/2c of vegetable stock. This was sooo amazing! I wanted to eat the other servings, but when my dad saw what I was cooking he stole the rest! I'm definitely making this again later this week.

Didn't measure up to my fav indian restaurant but it was pretty good.  Be careful how much cilantro you use!  Yikes, that's a lot!  and YES, this is SPICY.  I like spicy though.

I love this recipe :-)  However, I do have my own spin on it.  I use the same spice ratio but use only one can of chickpeas.  Then I add one sweet potato, one or two carrots (depending on the size), and a can of crushed tomatoes.  I cut up the root veggies into bit-size pieces.  I also add the starchy liquid from the chickpeas to thicken it up.  I serve the dish over couscous.  We love this dish and eat it about once a week.  It's full of good veggies, nutrients, and very little fat.

Good curry that satisfies my cravings for Indian food. However, when I make it it seems like the beans don't seem to absorb enough of the flavors.

This recipe was ok, I give it 3.5 stars as is (with no modifications). I will make it again though. Next time I will use fresh ginger instead of the powder ginger... I think this is key.... something was missing though, I don't know what it was... the chickpeas were way too dry and I had to add water.... also the cayenne pepper is REALLY HOT and SPICY!, next time I'll add way less than what the recipe calls for... My chickpeas were soooo hot that I added some coconut milk to make it more mild... I also added some sugar, perhaps 2 tablespoons... At the end of the day my recipe was totally different than what I intended to do. It turned out pretty good though!

We made this after making 'Spinach Chick Pea Curry' also on this site. I recommend this recipe instead!!  The cinnamon in this is overpowering, this tasted more like cookies than curry.   Also, this recipe is doubled from what to me would be a normal size. My boyfriend made sure that I would give this rating the lowest possible. We will never make it again!

This recipe was pretty good but I would give it 5 stars had it been a little saucier and more reminiscent of the Indian chickpea curries I love. I did follow the directions except used non canned beans so for the liquid I added a little veggie broth. I used ground ginger and cinnamon instead. Next time I might try same spices but add tomatoes and potatoes to it.

The dish was so-so, but not very fun and not worth the effort. Lacked complexity in flavor, which is odd considering the number of spices. We added spinach and a chopped tomato but it didn't help much. Other modifications included: using a cup of water instead of the bean liquid and not adding salt until the table.

This had the potential to be really good.  I followed the recipe, except for adding a little bit of heavy cream and served it over jasmine rice. The end result was just WAY too spicy. I would make it again, but next time I think 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper would be more than enough. I couldn't even finish a small serving and my mouth is still burning.

Thank you for this recipe! Very quick and perfect for introducing someone to curry (as I did last night)! Added quite a bit more spice and thinly sliced carrots, celery, mushrooms, and green pepper, though. Brown rice works very well!

An okay recipe.  I added cream to the mixture to make it more saucy.  Omit the cilantro.  Good blend of spices with flavors at the beginning and the end of bites.  I think that there would be better recipes to try that wouldn't take the adjusting that I needed to do to get a good flavor

I was back in the US for a bit and was missing Indian food, so I made this for my mom for lunch. We both absolutely loved it!
We used ground cinnamon in place of the stick and mashed up the chickpeas a bit, like another reviewer said to do.

Used frozen kale instead of cilantro at the end.  And added large shrimp, halved lengthwise for protein.  On brown rice. There was enough chick peas left over, so I made a hummus with them...gorgeous!

My husband really liked this; my 3-year-old, not so much. We ate it with naan and mango chutney. I halved the recipe,  and added 1/2 cooked chopped sweet potato. I also followed the recommendation of another reviewer and drained the chickpeas and added ground cinnamon. (I also used whole cardamon, well-smashed, because I was out of ground.)

I didn't have cinnamon sticks so I just added about a tsp of ground cinnamon. Excellent dish. Couldn't stop eating it.

Great recipe! I didn't use the liquid from the chickpeas because canned liquid is usually tinny. I substituted about 1 1/3 cup homemade veggie broth. I did mash up a little bit of the chickpeas right at the end for thickness. I also simmered for about 25 minutes to let the flavors mix. I had some Thai lemon basil I needed to use so I threw that in with the cilantro. Good but not necessary. It had a great spice - for those who don't like spice I would use less than 1 tsp. red pepper. Overall - I loved it and would definitely make it again! My boyfriend, who thinks Indian food is horrible, loved this! I'm trying to ease him into it! Thanks for the great recipe!

Very good recipe, though a little hotter than I was expecting.  To make a meal I added boiled potatoes, peas and a can of tomatoes.

Fantastic!  I followed the recipe as written, but rinsed the chick peas first and added a 1/2c of stock to simmer and thicken.  I served it over brown rice.  The next time, I'll make a double recipe it was that good.

This recipe was AWESOME!!! I took others advise and added 14.5oz diced tomatoes which in opinion is a MUST for this recipe.  Also I doubled the spices but left out the turmeric (didn't have) & cayenne since I was serving to my 5yr old.  I also used ground cinnamin/cloves and added 1-1/2 tbls of curry powder. I rinsed the beans and added 1 can of vegi broth to make a gravy and served over white rice.  Hubby wasn't too keen on all the spices but I absolutely loved this and will definately make it again albeit just for me :D

Good and easy to make, other than measuring out all the spices. I took other reviewers' suggestions and used 1 tsp ground cinnamon instead of cinnamon sticks and added a can of tomatoes (I might add some potatoes next time). I used one can of water instead of the chickpea juice. I used 3/4 tsp cayenne but wish I would've gone for the whole 1 tsp (I like spicy). I didn't add salt until the end (I have a low salt tolerance) and served over basmati rice. It made the house smell really good! I would make this again.

I had to throw this out. I made the recipe exactly as the recipe says, and it was awful. It tasted flat and did not have the high amplitude flavor that I enjoy in a curry.

This was just what I was looking for.  But definitely better the next day.  I took other reviewers' advice and added 14 oz canned diced tomato, 1/2 tsp of cloves, 1 tsp. ground cinnamon.  I also added a bit of garlic salt and some curry to taste.  I love, love, love, cilantro so that made all the difference in the end.  My hubby is not a fan of cilantro so the dish wasn't not his favorite.  Too bad for him.  He can eat steak!

Wow!  I would love to give this 5 stars, but as written the recipe was way to spicy.  I would recommend the following adjustments, use only 1 tsp. ginger root, 1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper and 1/2 tsp ground turmeric.

this was very good, and satisfied my curry cravings. It was pretty easy to put together, and I served it over rice. I used ground cinnamon, as other reviewers suggested, but otherwise I followed recipe exactly. Next time I might put in some veggies, to give it more variety.

Lovely, and made the kitchen smell delicious! Drained the liquid from the can by accident, then added 3/4 cup water with 1 tsp. cornstarch and chicken soup base in the last five minutes of cooking, for liquid and texture.

The first time I made this, I didn't have any ginger, onions, or cilantro on me and it still turned out EXCELLENT.  The second time I made it I added onions and it was still very good, but I prefer it without the veggies. I also like to let the sauce thicken a lot by evaporation.

I think it took a day for the flavors to really blend.  It was a tad bland after I first made it, but the leftovers were tastier.  Thumbs up, though!

First time I've done anything Indian....never tasted so many flavors in one dish - number of different spices is the reason. We all loved it. Didn't change anything in the recipe other than not putting all the liquid from the chickpea can into the dish - just a couple of ounces. My 14yr old son even enjoyed it!

This was a pretty good recipe for chole/chana masala.  Different than the kind in the restaurant, because it has much less fat, but still yummy!  I didn't change much - added a can of diced tomatoes (for color and a little sweetness), and added 1/2 tps more of each spice to compensate for the additional volume of the tomatoes.  I also added 1 tps of cinnamon and boiled the 2 cinnamon sticks whole.  Fresh spices are a must!  Will definitely make again.

I love curry and Mid-East cuisine...but this recipe was not at all what I expected.  It wasn't terrible, just not exciting in any way.  I think there is just too much Garbanzo and too much onion and the wrong blend (amount-wise) of spices...Nothing that I did seemed to help it.  I probably won't make it again.

This was amazing! I was very nervous to try this. DH and I have gently been trying more vegetarian meals, and I have never been a garbanzo bean fan. This was great! And spicy, which we love! I did drain the beans and add a 14 oz can of diced tomatoes. A little vegetable broth may be in order as well.

WOW this was spicy!  I didn't expect it.  I'm going to cut down the cayenne pepper to 1/4 tsp next time.  I also thickened it with corn starch.  The blend of spices was excellent and reminded me of my favorite Indian restaurant.  Delicious, but for the heat.

My only change was to use powdered ginder, however it became clear I wouldnt have enough liquid following the recipe exactly. I was able to achieve a good consistency by adding a can of condensed tomato soup and 1/2 cup heavy cream (from Butter Chickpea Curry Recipe from this site). I substituted spinach for cilantro since I dont like cilantro, but the main problem with this recipe was that all the spices clashed with one another resulting in a strange spicy taste in which no one flavor won out. Ive had chickpea curry in Pakistani homes and this did not simtulate me. My spices were not old either.

This was okay.  This dish turned out really spicy.  I let it sit at least a day before eating it to let the flavours melt together.  I'm biased in this review, because I eat authentic curries regularly from great Indian/Pakistani restaurants.  If you're looking for a western-style curry, this recipe would be good for you because it is a good, simple, recipe.

VERY HOT.  I had to add some yogurt and honey to take some of the heat out.  I love spicy food but this was borderline unpleasant.  This would be better with maybe 3/4 teaspoon cayanne and a little honey.

Amazingly easy and wonderful.  I added 2/3 a teaspooon cinnamon and added cilantro that comes in the tubes at the grocery store.  We'll make again.  Is a little hot, cut back the cayenne if you don't like the heat.

Kinda spicy, and I only used 1/2 tsp for the cayenne.  I served it on rice and it was ok.  Not the best but it was really easy.  It tasted like it was missing something, but I couldn't figure out what it was.

This recipe needed more spice for flavor and also needed to cook longer to get a better consistency.  I also added two cubed potatoes to increase the density of the curry and add to the flavor.

This was very different from most Indian chickpea dishes I have had. More of a sidedish. That being said, I really liked the subtle sweet flavour of this dish. Will probably make again.

It was a passable dish but definitely room for improvement on the spices. I wasn't a bit fan of the cinnamon and if I try this recipe again, I will have to remember to put the cloves in a cheesecloth or something.  Biting into one of those isn't the tastiest thing ever..

Great Curry Dish without the Curry!

My wife even liked this dish and that's saying a lot. The only problem I had was that I didn't crush the spices enough and there was crunchy pieces (might use bottled spices next time, or just use more arm strength).

Even better the next day, and the day after that.

This is my second time making this.  I would give it five stars if it weren't for the cayenne pepper.  The first time I put in 1 teaspoon and our mouths were on fire.  The second time I put a dash and it was perfect.  I never use the liquid of the chickpeas so I used my homemade chicken broth instead.  Served on couscous... delicious!

it was a nice change from what we normally have. i did deviate a little though, i added some leftover rotisserie chicken and mashed potatoes to help thicken it up some. also added some chicken broth. needless to say, i had to pretty much triple the spices called for. it was good, i thought it could have been a little spicier still though!

I felt like this was over-spiced and didn't allow much of the taste of the ingredients to come through.  It needs some tweaking I think.

I normally like this combination of spices but I wasn't happy at all with the curry, had to add coconut and curry powder to make it edible. Sorry maybe just not my thing.

This was good, but in our opinion it needed much more flavor.  We are big fans of indian food, and really enjoy the flavors.  We found it a bit bland (it had enough spice, but just not flavor for us), but we know it has huge potential for us if we add additional spices.  Thanks for the recipe!

Made this for husband and two friends, and it went over very well.  Added potatoes, (undrained) canned tomatoes as mentioned by other reviewers, and I mashed some of the chickpeas.  I didn't have coriander; I'll buy it before I make it again.  Used ground ginger instead of fresh.  The curry ended up a little dry for my taste -- that's the reason for 4 stars, and next time I will add more water.  I served it over basmati rice, but hubby and I prefer jasmine (although I know that's not as authentic).  Ooh, and I made the chapati bread - it smoked up the house, but it sure added to the meal!

I am not a huge fan of Indian food, and I’ve certainly never attempted to make curry on my own, but this stuff is delish! I used only one can of drained chickpeas, and added one big red potatoe (cubed), 2 big sliced carrots, half a green pepper plus one can of broth. As suggested, I mashed up some of the chick peas and halved the pepper. This is easy to make, tasty, cheap and not bad for you... What else can you ask for. Plus considering that many reviewer has adapted this recipe to suit their personal tastes, it’s also flexible. OH... I didn’t have any cumin! Will definitely make again. My husband will never eat, but it’s perfect for me for lunch! THANKS for sharing.

I often double or triple spices in recipes because I like a lot of flavor, but didn't find that necessary with this recipe.  It packed a lot more punch than I expected!  It was tasty, but I think I'd like to mash the garbanzo beans a little bit next time.

I love this! First curry I ever made, and it tasted just like my local indian place. 
I just added some walnuts for crunch, but otherwise wouldn't change anything.
Gets better overnight. :)

This was my first experience with Indian food and I am not impressed.  More than likely it is my unexperienced palate, but this was very spicy to me.   I found myself picking out the bits of cinnamon sticks.  Maybe this cuisine just isn't for me.

I love chickpeas and I have tried making chickpea curry using various recipes. This one is the best so far. I added lesser cayenne pepper than the recipe called for. So, the curry tasted a little sweet (from the cinnamon). I will add the full amount next time. I also added a fresh plum tomato which added to the flavor. I am going to try making the curry by adding cauliflower to it next time.

I LOVED this recipe!!!  It really had the curry flavour I've been looking for.  Even my toddler ate it up (but I mixed yogurt with his to lessen the spice).  I did add potatoes and tomatoes as others suggested and garam masala for more spice and it was a hit.

Loved this recipe, and can't believe some people find it bland.  It is definitely hot and there is quite a strong ginger and cinnamon taste, so cut back on these if you don't like these flavors. We just cooked it as is and thought it was great.

I never follow recipes exactly... just taste them a lot and keep adding things until it tastes good!  To this recipe I added:
- 1/2 can coconut milk
- doubled the cumin
- 1 teaspoon Splenda (some mango chutney is nice for sweetness too!)
- 3 teaspoons lemon juice
- a few extra cloves... 10 total.
- 3 heaping teaspoons tomato paste
- 1 teaspoon Garam Masala

I DID use the Cayenne this time, but I think I'll substitute crushed red chillies next time... still get the heat, but more flavour... might need more than a teaspoon though!

It was good, but didn't have an outstanding flavour. I rinsed and drained my garbanzo beans (always!), and added a can of diced tomatoes. I will try this recipe again though, but tinker with the spicing.

Needs salt!!  I thought the recipe was too ginger-y also.  I don't like to be mean, but it was only okay.

This recipe was really great.  The flavors were a rainbow and rollercoaster for your mouth.  The cinnamon was a bit big - didn't really crush up well and not fun to eat big chunks - I need practice.  Also picking out the cloves may not be up everyone's alley.  You can add more heat and saltiness if necessary.  Definitely a keeper!

Indian food is one of both my partner's and my favourite types of food -- we have become quite the connoisseurs over the years, having tried countless restaurants all over the country (with only a couple living up to our high expectations).  This was the first time I attempted to prepare a curry dish from scratch, and was I ever impressed!  I can’t believe anyone thinks this dish is bland!  I prepared as instructed, although I added a green pepper and some halved grape tomatoes.  While cooking, I mashed the chickpeas a bit with a wooden spoon.  I also used much less cilantro than called for (as per my personal taste).  Also, I removed the cloves before serving (over brown rice).  A healthy and delicious meal!

Yum!  I used ground cinnamon and I sauteed mushrooms with the 1 large onion I used in butter.  Also, I substituted diced tomatoes for the garbanzo bean water.  I used much less cayenne than called for so my kiddos could eat it.  YUM!  Loved this recipe.

We tried this dish last night and it was delicious!  In fact, I can't stop thinking about it.  I went right out to the store and bought more chickpeas so we can make it again soon.  We substituted Sauer's brand curry powder for all the spices (used about 4 tsps), and the result was out of this world.  Also, we didn't have quite as many chickpeas as the recipe originally called for, and it worked perfectly.

very good. I used home made ginger garlic paste instead of the separate ginger and garlic. Omitted the cilantro at the end, cuz I did not have any. Served with basmati rice, really good! thanks for sharing!

i drained all but a tiny bit of the chickpea juice and used a 1/2 drained can of diced tomatos.  that cinn stick was HARD i couldnt even cut it, so i threw one into the mix whole and used a tsp of ground cinnimon.  also after i mixed in the beans i started the basmati rice and simmered the dish till the rice was done.  everything else was the same (no salt since the chikpeas had salt in them)...came out great!  watch out you dont bite into a clove though!

I substituted ground cloves for whole, and ground cinnamon for crushed cinnamon sticks.  When it was done, it didn't really look like dinner...so I cooked 6 bratwurst sausages, sliced them and added them, along with 2 heads of chopped broccoli, and then simmered, covered, for another 20 minutes - it was a delicious all-in-one meal.  Oh, I also drained and rinsed the chickpeas first, and used water instead of the liquid from the can - it is full of salt and preservatives.

I agree with those who have said that this recipe is spicy, yet bland.  I think it needs some sugar in it, I like the ideas that others have about adding apples and raisins, I think that is what this recipe needs.  As is, there is too much cayenne and not enough flavor.

We found this recipe to be very bland, which was surprising, given the variety of spices that went into it.  My spices are all fresh, so it wasn't because of poor quality spices.  To be fair, we didn't put the full amount of cayenne pepper in while cooking, as my 2-year-old was also going to be eating it, but I did put the container on the table and my husband and I added the extra cayenne pepper to our own plates.  But this just made it spicier, not more flavorful.  I'm disappointed that this wasn't to our liking, especially after all of the good reviews that this recipe received.

This recipe had a great aroma, color and flavor...BUT..it was a bit too spicy for my taste. I think next time, we'll add just a 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper. We also added a touch of heavy cream and used  parsley rather than cilantro. Pretty tasty over a bed of rice. We also served this with Mic's Naan recipe.

Very very tasty, though very spicy. I still had heartburn when I woke up the next day! Next time we'll go with our gut feeling that 1 tsp is way too much cayenne!

A very good curry, but could use another ingredient -- chicken, spinach, something to make it a bit less chick pea-ish.  I also found it VERY spicy, although that may be because I used good cayenne.  If you're a bit of a spice wimp, be sure to have plenty of plain yogurt on hand.  Made this with Indian Chapati Bread from this site, which we also loved.

Fabulous. I love the taste, texture, and ease of preparation. I made this dish first and then prepared a couple others, so it had plenty of time to simmer on the stove and the chickpeas really absorbed the flavor of the spices.

Like others, I used ground cloves and cinnamon and it was still great.  My 14 year old son is a vegetarian and he makes this dish all the time now.

This recipe was a great hit in our family, both the vegetarians and the carnivores. We added a bit more cayenne as we like it hot and it was just perfect. MMMMMMMM

Fantastic! My husband is a hardened carnivore, and this was a breathe of fresh air for me, and he loved it as well. Easy to prepare, I served it with Jasmine Rice, baked chicken and steamed veggies. One caveat, if you are sensitive to spicy food, serve some yogurt on the side. THANKS!

This is really HOT!  I served it with Tandoori Chicken and it felt like we were at an Indian restaurant-delicious!

Amazing!  The two whole onions may look like a lot, but when everything is added, you can't even notice them.  Also, when crushing the cinamon sticks, I recommend you crush them *really* well - the pieces don't soften very much, so the smaller, the better.
