Tasty and moist.  I couldn't find butterfinger bites so I used 1/2 cup of skor chips and 1/2 chocolate chips.

This has big banana flavor. Yum! Very simple to make, but people will think you spent more time adding the flavors.

Wow, that was delicious and easy!  The only addition was I added to put some banana (one) and some of the crushed Butterfinger in the frosting too to jazz the frosting itself up!
