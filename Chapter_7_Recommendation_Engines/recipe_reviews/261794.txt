I doubled this recipe and it made enough dough for 4 houses.  Used meringue powder for the frosting.  Will use this recipe again!

This is a yummy and simple recipe to make. Perfect for making gingerbread houses. Gingerbread is delicious, soft inside but sturdy outside. It holds up well when putting up the walls. I made royal icing with meringue powder, instead of making icing with raw egg whites.

This recipe was lovely. I especially like assembling the gingerbread the night before we decorated!   I doubled the recipe and made a large gingerbread house, three small and several 3-d trees.  My house has smelled amazing for a solid three days!   Do me a favor and make your own gingerbread.... it is SO worth it!
