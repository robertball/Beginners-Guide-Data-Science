we really liked them.  you have to like coffee.  i added about 1/2 cup more flour so they weren't so sticky, when you roll them out.  and instead of using a fork to mash them down, i waited until they came out and put a hersheys hug in the middle, like a peanutbutter blossom.  turned out very good will make again!

This is a very basic recipe which can be modified in many ways. I personally like more of a coffee flavor, so I doubled up on the coffee measurement, using powdered espresso rather than instant coffee. The flavor was good, but the dough was very sticky to work with.

These weren't that crispy unless I flattened them, but they were really good!  I ran out of coffee, so I added cocoa after the 1/6 cup mark.  Thanks for a great recipe!

The first time I tried it with hot chocolate and they tasted fine.Though I do put them in the refridgerator because they are a little sticky when rolling into balls. My husband loved these cookies.

these came out lovely! followed others' suggestion and added a bit more flour and a bit more coffee; also added 1/2 tspn of cocoa for a hint of chocolate. i have also made them with real coffee in a pinch when i didn't have instant; they are definitely passable like that as well, although the texture obviously isn't as nice.

I agree with the others who said this needs  a few small changes. This is what I changed on my second time making them: 

 I like mine chewy in the middle, so I made them a little larger and didn't flatten them with a fork. 

I also added double the coffee, and I added some luxury hot chocolate (didn't have any cocoa powder in) 

I also added a little extra sugar as I preferred them sweeter.

I just threw out the entire batch... very disappointing. I used instant espresso powder instead of regular instant coffee and I still could not get a good coffee flavor out of these. What was left was bland with a burnt-nut aftertaste and not at all crispy. In no way do these taste like a "cup of coffee" like one reviewer said. My hopes were dashed! Most people who like this recipe and have reviewed it have added chocolate it to it... it needs help.

I doctored this one up because I'm not a big coffee fan.  I added 3/4 cup of cocoa and lessened the flour to 2 cups only.  Yum Yum.  I wish I had a big cappuccino to go with them right now!  These bake up so pretty too.  Too bad they're going to the school for the teachers!

Nothing special. It was very easy to make and wasn't overly sweet. I got what I expected.

I loved this recipie. However i did add 1/2 cup of extra flour, 3 packages of hot chocolate mix, and topped the uncooked cookies with cinnamon and sugar. Baked for only 8 minutes. Came out GREAT! Thank you for this recipie.

It's a very good recipe.  Next time I think I'll add cocoa powder to give it a chocolatey kick!

These came out great! I'm usually not a fan of cake-like cookies, but these have a wonderful taste and texture. The dough was awfully sticky even after I refrigerated it for a bit, and I was afraid they'd melt as soon as they went into the oven. They held up just fine, no adjustments necessary (though I did use regular finely ground coffee because I didn't have instant).

These are yummy. I add chocolate chips and walnuts to make them extra crunchy.

I love these cookies.  I took the advice of others and added a bit more flour, more coffee granules and about a tablespoon of cocoa.  I tried to flatten with a fork, but found it worked much better to flatten with my fingers, washing my hands off once the dough started to stick. Watch carefully so the bottoms don't burn.

I had some white chocolate left over from a previous recipe, so I melted it and coated half of each cookie. I took them to a dinner party and everyone loved them.
