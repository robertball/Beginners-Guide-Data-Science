Not the biggest fan of this sauce. I made it exactly as the recipe suggested and I was not impressed. After tasting it and not liking it I added ginger and garlic to the sauce and it was better. Probably will not make this again.

I made this recipe exactly as written. My family did not prefer the taste of the tomato soup.  The soup coated the veggies so that everything appeared red.  I will not be making this recipe again.

Great recipe. After reading some of the reviews, I was a little leary, but it worked out well. I used a combination of frozen stir fry veggies, and cut up peas and carrots, and cut up some fresh onion too. If the flavor bothers you, or you want some kick, pump up the amount of soy sauce, and add some extra garlic powder and ginger. The one can of sauce was just barely enough - mostly because I used lots of veggies and big strips of chicken. The recipe is a great starting point, and I will definitely make it again.

i didnt add quite as much tomato sauce as it called for and added some extra spices like red pepper flakes and paprika. my family loved it but you probably wouldnt like it if your not a big fan of tomato sauce based dinners.

We liked this a lot. I used a tuscan frozen veggie mix (broccoli, onion, mushrooms and peppers). I served it on ramen noodles (actually, added the cooked noodles to the meat/veg/sauce), and added one ramen seasoning packet to the mix.

This was easy and delicious. French beans was the veggie of choice which worked great with the tomato sauce. Threw some raw almond slices in at the end for added crispness. Used chicken boneless chicken thighs instead of breasts and cooked it with canola oil and a tbsp. of butter to brown the chicken. Definitely would cook this again.

I usually like anything made with tomato sauce but I didn't really care for this recipe......I even added a lot of other spices but it still tasted kind of bland because of the sauce.

My husband and I were pleasantly surprised at how good this recipe turned out to be.  We are not big stir fry fans, but we thought we would try it as it seemed different than typical stir fry recipes.  It is different, and it is delicious!  We both loved it, and will make it again.

This recipe was really yummy. The veges soaked up the sauce so my kids had no complaints about eating them. Very impressive.
