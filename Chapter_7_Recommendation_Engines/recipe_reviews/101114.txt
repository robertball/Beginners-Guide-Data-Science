This is easy, delicious and versatile.  I did make a few changes however.  I used 2 cups chicken broth and 1/2 cup of water in place of the water, to add more flavor.  I also used a can of sliced tomatoes and broke them up a bit.  I also added 2 stalks of celery and 3 slender carrots to the garlic and onion.  The last 5 minutes I threw in 2 cups of chopped fresh spinach.  Also, one 6 oz. can of salmon was enough for my taste.   This can go in an Italian or Asian direction depending on how you season it.  I will make it again.  (Fresh salmon and basil would really knock it out of the park.)

Great and easy to make stew! I used chicken broth instead of water.  I also used less broth..more like 1 cup and 1/2.  I prefer stew consistency vs. soup.  Added 2 tablespoon of brown sugar as well.

Loved this stew! I read the reviews and added celery like someone else did.  The only thing is that I didn't add the optional ingredients because I didn't have them.  Next time I make this I think I will add more tomatoes because I love them.  I am so thankful for this receipe because now I have a new way to cook salmon, and I love soups and stews.

this was the first time making this meal, it was 
simple, and very delicious.  I have added this one
to my recipe box, and will be using it often, as I love
pink salmon.

I LOVE THIS! Ironically, I added similar ingredients as another reviewer did before I read the reviews. To make it more hearty, I added celery, carrots, spinach, and even a little cabbage and cauliflower because I love vegetables. Next time I will add some cubed potatoes as well. I also used chicken broth instead of water, and added half a can of diced tomatoes with chilies. Delicious and so healthy!

This is a wonderful 5 star salmon stew. Iâ€™m not very big on fish but really enjoyed this dish. Thank goodness I decided to open my mind and try it. It has a mild salmon flavor, not overpowering at all. This was also a very simple and neat recipe to prepare. Loved the way that all the flavors came together. Using the liquid from the canned salmon made the broth so full and delicious. Adding fresh cilantro at the end completed it for me.  Very healthy and good salmon stew recipe, this one is a keeper!

I also cut the liquid to 1 1/2 cups of broth but it was still too soupy for my liking. I made 1 cup of quinoa to serve it over so I dumped it in the mixture which thickened it. A few drops of lime juice and tabasco sauce and voila. Super easy prep and will be a staple go to for us. Good clean eating!

I made the recipe as it calls for with no substitutions or additions. As is, the recipe is a bit bland. I served mine over rice which was really good and helped to bulk up the stew. If I make this again, I would make the following modifications: Decrease water to just 1 cup for a thicker, stew consistency. Add about 1 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp pepper. Lastly, I would add, either directly to the pot or individual bowls, sriracha.

Yummy stew! I used leftover Atlantic salmon. I doubled the tomato and substituted the basil with cilantro. I didn't have any fish sauce so I used 2 teaspoons of oyster sauce.

Great Recipe!  I took the advice of other reviewers and used Chicken broth instead of water, added one can of Lobster bisque, and veggies (sliced carrots, and cubed sweet potatoes).  I also simmered it for a couple of hours, mostly so the carrots would be cooked thoroughly.  I served it over rice pilaf, instead of plain rice, also.  Delicious!

Very tasty!  Never worked with canned pink salmon before, and was a little grossed out because of all the little circle bones, but the flavor of the stew was excellent!  :D
