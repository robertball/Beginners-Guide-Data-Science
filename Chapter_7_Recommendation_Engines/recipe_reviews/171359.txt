Just made mine and added Linda's toasted pine nuts which made it even better.  Great as a snack in scoops.

I thought this recipe was good, while other people loved it. After it sat overnight the raisins kicked in and made it pretty sweet. I might omit the raisins the next time.

This was really fantastic.  It was different palette for us, but it worked so well.  I did not have V8 but I had extra tomatoes and carrots and celery.  I added 4 cloves of garlic, a jalapeno, and for the anchovies, I used one 2 oz can in olive oil.  My raisins were not sweetened so my dish did not end up being too sweet.    We skipped the pine nuts and parmesan.  Overall excellent dish.

I made several minor changes to the recipe. I would rate the recipe as I made it only three stars, but I believe that had I followed the recipe more closely, it would have been 4 stars, hence the 4 star rating.  I used tomato sauce instead of V8, white vinegar, used a sweeter red wine, garlic stuffed green olives, all zucchini instead of yellow squash, omitted celery and forgot the parm. It was good and we all liked it, however, it was a bit too sweet. And, as Oliversmom noted, it got sweeter as it sat longer. Next time, if I use a sweet wine again (we tend to drink sweeter wines in my household), I'll reduce the sugar and/or raisins. I'll also make sure to use the red wine vinegar, I think that is probably a fairly key ingredient. Also, hubby is not a pine nut fan and he believes that it would have tasted better without the pine nuts.

Used crushed canned tomatoes and tomato paste in place of V8 since I didn't have any at the house.  Also, I omitted the cheese as I am lactose intolerant and didn't have any pine nuts on hand,but this recipe was still AWESOME!  The raisins and brown sugar help balance the acidity of the tomatoes, vinegar and olives.  I didn't microwave the eggplant as the pieces I made were so small, little to no water was reserved in them.  It didn't taste oily to me.  Served it with pot roast and crostinis.  Everyone scraped their plates!

Far too many ingredients and mostly what I tasted was wine mixed with brown sugar.

After three tries I just can't get this to more than a fall back for eggplants on clearance.  Good and worth trying but just don't hit home for us.
