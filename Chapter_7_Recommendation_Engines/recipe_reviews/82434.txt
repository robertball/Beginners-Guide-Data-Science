I actually served this to my sister who's n ever had escargot and she liked it very much. I know some people have an aversion to snails just on hearing it. It's a very good dish.

We absolutly loved it.  I used more garlic and more butter than the recipe called for because we like it very saucey. It was quick elegant and so very easy.

This is good, but I can see this recipe tweaked into something even better. First time cooking escargots, and they turned out quite well. I wasn't content with the breaking up of the pollock- When you toss it all up with the pasta in the end it breaks up so much that you barely taste it and makes the dish paste-y. I used less butter, more garlic, caramelized the onions and added some homemade pickled cauliflower/carrot. This may have detracted from the original taste, but we felt it needed veggies and that was our only solution. Looking back, I would rinse them next time before chopping and adding the mix. I potentially foresee a remake of this dish without the fish, changes to the sauce and adding veggies. Thanks for the inspiration!

I made this as written, but used "Homemade Spinach Pasta" (also from this site). I didn't care for the pollock in there. I think this would have been much better with just the escargot. We ate it, but it's not something I'd make again.
