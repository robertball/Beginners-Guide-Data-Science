I so wanted to have pizzelles this year and so I tried this recipe.  It was wonderful! I made the vanilla version.  Even the family members who eat gluten liked it!  I made no changes to the recipe. It's hard to believe that no one else has tried and rated this recipe.  Try it you'll be glad you did.
