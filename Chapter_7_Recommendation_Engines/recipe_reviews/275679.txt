Made a similar dish when the in-laws were here for a visit last week but I did it in a skillet on the stove. Wish I would have discovered this recipe before that. The mushrooms absorbed more flavor in the air fryer and also got a better crisp on them. I added some chopped snap peas that I had leftover from that same dish. Not necessary but they added nice color and worked well too. This will be my go to from now on. Excellent recipe and 5 stars all the way!
