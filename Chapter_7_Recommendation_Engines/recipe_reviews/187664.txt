I love making these! I don't like to use chocolate chips - as the liquid firms up too quickly. Chocolate chips have an added agent in them to keep its shape - I use regular melting chocolate instead which melts to a thinner consistency and remains "wetter" longer than melted chocolate chips. I dip the marshmallows 1/2 way in the chocolate and then sprinkle them with rainbow sprinkles. It is always a big hit! Sometimes I also add some pink marshmallows.

I just made these for my daughter to take to a party ( 10 year olds girls night).  I used pretzels for the sticks and dipped the chocolate in crushed Butterfingers for a totally edible treat!

What could be better than chocolate and marshmallows!  Fairly easy recipe, I did need to add a little shortening to my chocolate chips because they weren't wanting to melt smoothly.  I only dipped half the marshmallow into the chocolate and found that the 2 cups of melted chips was plenty to dip the whole bag of marshmallows.  I also sprinkled the end of each marshmellows with colored sprinkles.  Fun and yummy!

I thought these were great! It was a little too much marshmallow for us, so I cut them in half. I melted chocolate bark in the microwave (stirring every 30 seconds) and dipped the marshmallow halves in the melted chocolate. Then into graham cracker crumbs, like Jeannette H. suggested. They were like little smore bites! We'll definitely be making them again!

My kids and I were looking for something fun to do with Kraft's new Vanilla-Caramel marshmallows. This was an incredibly simple cooking project we could all do together to make everyone happy. We doubled the recipe easily and dipped the chocolate-covered marshmallows in chopped peanuts. The kids are WAY happy and think I'm a total rockstar. All with minimal ingredients. Thanks!

Good and simple.  Place the bowl of melted chocolate over a pan of simmering water to keep it at a good consistency.  Using a deep Pyrex bowl to dip in worked better than my shallow double boiler.  I also used the edge of a rubber spatula to even out and smooth sides and bottom of the marshmallows . . . it only takes a second. . .

Fun-a-licious!  Kids and I made these for a school bake sale.  They were the first thing to sell out and did so in less than 2 hours.  People came back looking for more!  We made the smore's version rolling in graham cracker crumbs.  Will be adding this to my permanent list of bake sale items!  *****have made these a few times now and I use the skinny pretzel sticks as the "handle".  Cheap, easy and no waste.  All edible!

I made these for my son's scout troop and they loved them!  I did half semisweet and half milk chocolate chips and then dipped them in rice crispy cereal for some added crunch.  I also used the giant marshmallows, which I think were a little too big but a fun visual.  =)

Can't wait to try this with the enormous HUGE GIANT marshmallows!  For the reviewer who thought marshmallow and chocolate don't balance well, Ummm....S'mores, pinwheel cookies, chocolate covered marshmallow Santas....etc. etc.  I'm thinking it's more a matter of your personal preference than a problem with the recipe.  What's not to love about chocolate and marshmallow?  The only thing I can think that would make it better would be to add caramel!

I used milk chocolate but I decided to skewer mine by placing three large marshmallows on a lollipop stick and covered the entire skewer of marshmallows in tempered chocolate. This makes a nice treat.

I made these for my daughter's Easter/Holiday party.  I used melting chocolate, dipped them half way and used sprinkles.  I let my 3 yr old put the marshmellows on popsickle sticks before dipping and she also dipped them in the sprinkles.  We had a lot of fun making them together and her class LOVED them.  Great idea!  Thank you.

Cute and tasty! Made these for a quick addition to my Valentine's Day goodies for friends and neighbors. Dipped about 1/3 of the marshmallow into semisweet chocolate, then sprinkled nonpariels on some. On the others I added some strawberry extract to the chocolate, allowed the chocolate to harden, then drizzled pink-tinted white chocolate over them. Cute! Thanks :)

I also added a small amount of vegetable shortening.  And I used chocolate bars instead of chocolate chips.  I will be making these again but next time I think I'll top them with sprinkles or mini candies to make them more of a "party" food.

My four-year-old and I just made these using stick pretzels instead of toothpicks to dip.  (One of the pictures in the gallery showed that, and it makes for a nice sweet/salty combination!)  Sometime, we're going to try dipping marshmallows into melted caramel before the chocolate layer!  There are so many possibilities...

This recipe was just ok. I made some marshmallows covered with crushed cinnamon hearts, some with coconut, and some with coloured sprinkles. If I make this recipe again, I will cover more of the marshmallow with chocolate and perhaps flavour it.  The cinnamon hearts were pretty good, so I might top them all with them next time.

These are a great project to make with little kids. My four year old niece and I used (tinted pink) white chocolate and rainbow sprinkles. We called them "princess marshmallows" and she loved them.

Very Fun and Easy to make. Not to mention, they taste great. My neighbors daughter and I made 2 batches of these. One batch with white marshmallows and milk chocolate and the other with strawberry marshmallows with white chocolate. The white chocolate gives you more of an opportunity to decorate with different colored sprinkles. All the kids that were here last night loved these. Oh, and the choc chips didn't really melt very well. The bark on the other hand melted perfectly.

Wow, I really wasn't expecting to like these. They were really tasty. I only had Ghiradelli melting chocolate so I used that. These taste like my favorite cookie when I was a kid, the Pinwheel. Next time I'll try & get the graham cracker bottom on it somehow, yum!

What a great and quick dessert! Took this to a friends house when I really didnt have time to make a complicated dessert.  Instead of semi sweet, took a regular milk chocolate bar and melted it in the microwave.    Dipped marshmallow into the chocolate and then coated that with crumbled graham crackers that I crushed in a food processor.  Refridgerated overnite- and still looked great the next day!  Was a huge hit at the party!

Simple, pretty and delicious!  I tried dipping the whole marshmallow in the chocolate, but that was so messy and difficult to get the excess chocolate off.  So ulitimately, I found that dipping half of the marshmallow in the chocolate was the easiest!  I then set them upright and sprinkled colored sprinkles on top.  I used Christina's suggestion of using strawberry marshmallows and they are fantastic!  The perfect little bite-sized dessert.  I love the idea of using graham cracker crumbs, so I will have to try that next time!

Didn't have any chocolate chips in the cabinet so I used butterscotch chips instead and WOW! These are great! I even rolled a few of them in crushed cinnamon graham crackers and they were great with the added crunch. Some may find it too sweet, but I found it delightful.

So easy and really nice looking. I used strawberry and coconut marhmallows. I let my daughter soll them in sprinkles. We also put three mini marshmallows on a toothpick and dipped those (that's the one laying on top of the other in the picture). I would make these again for a kids party.

I just made these today for my grandchild's "Princess" Birthday Party for her Little Guests. Very simple to make, and you can get very creative with these. A little cello wrap, some ribbon, and personalized gift tags make these an adorable yummy treat!

I just made this for my fiance to take to work, and he adored them. We used cooking chocolate instead of chips, and I covered them with coloured sprinkles, like other reviewers have. The best thing about these is that you can experiment with toppings! Would be great for kids, or a romantic occasion.

Outstanding!  I set the ingredients on the table during a 12 yr old's birthday party and let the kids make their own.  The cake's only purpose was to hold the candles, as none of them touched it in lieu of the marshmallows!

Made these for my daughter's valentine treats for her to hand out at school.  Put the marshmallows on a popsicle stick dipped them in melted chocolate and sprinkled them with valentine sprinkles.  They set up nice and I was able to bag them, add a ribbon and her valentine card.  So simple and the kids LOVED them!

I love these! I usually use the Kraft Strawberry flavored marshmallows, when I can find them, but if not, the regular marshmallows are just as good. I let mine dry and just drizzle with more chocolate. YUMMY! :)

I wasn't that impressed.  They are pretty but keeping the chocolate melted is a pain.  We used chopped peanuts and crushed graham crackers.  The kids ate them but most of them went to the trash.

My 18 yr old son LOVED these! I used the pretzles ,as sticks as someone suggested. My sprinkle variations were: coconut, chopped pecans,candy sprinkles and then I left some plain chocolate. I am not a marshmallow fan but the ones with nuts were pretty good!

Easy recipe. I make these around the holidays.  However, I dont just stop at graham crackers. In the past, I have used crushed Oreos, nuts, holiday themed sprinkles, and mini M&Ms. (not all at the same time).

Delish and so easy. Trying out simple treat recipes in preparation for the holidays.  I used chocolate candy squares, which I already had,  instead of the chips. I melted the squares and followed the rest of the recipe and they came out just fine. Very reasonable on the budget.

Didn't use sprinkles on top. Had so many my daughter put 1 on a graham cracker, put it in microwave for 8 seconds, put another cracker on top and we had s'mores. Delicious.

Such a fun treat to make! I made them on a stick for my grandchildren for a Valentine's Day treat. I also used the heart shaped marshmallows, dipped them halfway, let them harden up a bit, and then drizzled white chocolate on top.

Really easy! I rolled the dipped marshmallows in finely crushed graham crackers to give it more of a s'more affect.

Very simple to make and allows for creativity. I used a glass cup, kabob sticks and had different types of sprinkles to make these for my family on valentines day one year. I also made the pretzel turtles, chocolate dipped pretzel sticks and the chocolate covered strawberries. (also on this site) It made for a nice presentation. We make these every now and again for special occasions.

These are the perfect "kid cooking" project. My kids (6 & 3) made these for their friends today and they were fun while being not too messy (we used skewers to dip the marshmallows). We used milk chocolate chips and topped with crushed m&m's and graham crackers. :) Thanks!
