I made this recipe just as directed with only two substitutions: I used lime juice since I did not have any fresh limes on hand and I cooked the shrimp in olive oil, garlic, and finely chopped onions.  The taste was great and the recipe was so easy.  I recommend this to anyone who loves shrimp and avacados with a spicy zing!  :-)
