I used this brownie recipe for a class I am in.  I needed a brownie recipe that includes water, because my class experiment is replacing water with a different ingredient (a nutraceutical) to add healthy benefits to the food.

THis recipe was EXCELLENT for what i needed it for.  They came out moist and cakey (I took them out 5-10 min early each time).  I have made them at least once or twice each week for this class and they are very consistent.  However, they are VERY dark chocolate.  Anyone in my class that likes dark chocolate LOVED this recipe.

If you are a more milk chocolate person, use semi-sweet chocolate instead and I think you'll enjoy the recipe more.

Its deffinitely for Dark chocolate lovers.

These were absolutely delicious!!  I had no walnuts, so I omitted those, and I only baked for 20 minutes. The brownies are somewhat dense, very chocolatey and not too sweet. Just how I like them! Thanks!!!

I had no idea chocolate could taste this awful! I'm not sure where this recipe goes wrong, but both the flavor and texture are very bad.

These brownies came out horrible.  They were very cakey and rubbery.  The chocolate gave it a dense taste but the consistency was not good.

These brownies really did seem to melt in your mouth which i thought was a nice difference.  But I thought they were too cakey instead of the rich and chewy texture I prefer.  I would also leave out the salt beacause it tasted pretty salty.

i personally loved this mixture! I love brownies but ive always found them too sweet. This however tasted slightly sweet but not over powering. i agree they were more cake than brownie but only just. so light yet chewy. i would say dont bother with salt and if you like it sweet just go for a sweeter chocolate. Thanks for posting this up! my partner will love them too.

I would rather eat leftover cocoa wheats. These are not brownies. The cocoa and butter taste good but I was too ashamed to let this out of the house. I thought it was going to be like a flourless cake but it is not something that should be made.

My kids loved these brownies but I think the unsweetened chocolate squares and relatively small amount of sugar gave it a slightly bitter, dark-chocolate taste.  Nevertheless, with a few tweaks I think this is a great recipe!

A little more cake-like than I prefer, but good chocolate taste, and made of ingredients that I have in the house all the time.  Which was important, because I was snowed in today.  I used Hershey's Cocoa and oil instead of the baker's chocolate squares and they were still good.

They don't resemble brownies in anyway. They are flat as a pancake and bitter. There is no levening in the receipe to make them reise.
