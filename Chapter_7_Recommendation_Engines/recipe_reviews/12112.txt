I love this pie crust recipe and I use it every time I make a pie. I do mess with it a little to suit the type of pie I am making. for fruit pies I like to add a couple tablespoons of sugar, and for savory pies I like to add black pepper and sometimes some dried herbs.

I've made this twice now, and it works, but I docked it one star because it does NOT take 6 tablespoons of water. The dough is WAY too dry that way. It uses more like 8 or 9 tablespoons.  Also, there's ALMOST not quite enough dough for a basic 9 inch pie.  Maybe I'm doing something wrong, but I'm rolling it out pretty darn thin, and I find it dosen't quite reach the edges of my pan.

The best pie crust I ever made.  I used it for a rhubarb pie that one 1st prize at a rhubarb festival.  I freeze enough water until it has ice crystals before starting the crust, then roll it thin.

I really liked how easy and non tiring to make.  I made the crust for a apple pie recipe.  I made 2 pie crusts just like the recipe calls for and i used the top portion of the crust and sliced it in long peice and criss-crossed the top of the pie.  I then brushed a egg yolk on top of crust for browning.  It looked fabulous, it looked better the store bought.  I was so proud of it I took digital pics of it.  But the bottom crust was all soggy and doughy, even after a few day refridration.  The apples filling was not one bit soggy to cause the bottom of the crust to come out like that.  I will use this recipe again but maybe bake it for a while before I continue filling it.  Thanks Brenda.

This crust was easy to make.  I chilled the dough before rolling out.  I was able to roll it very thin!  Great recipe, I'll use it again and again and . . .

Amazing flavor;  we used this for Blueberry Pie from this site, and the crust was just right even without any added sugar.  I had some trouble rolling it without the dough sticking to the pin and the countertop, probably due to my inexperience, but even pieced together it looked beautiful and tasted light and flaky.  Per another review, I used a light egg wash and a little sugar on top before baking, which added to the appearance.  Baked for 50 minutes, covered with foil the last 15 minutes, and the results were perfect!

The hubby loved it, but i felt it was to salty. Next time i will cut out the salt all together.
BUT i gave it 4 stars because the bottom wasn't soggy and i was even able to warm it up the next day!

Good recipe.  It doesn't say how long to cook the pre baked pie shells.  I used a 350 degree oven and baked for about 20 minutes.

Excellent piecrust. I used it for a lemon and chocolate pie. Simple ingredients can be made anytime. Comes out nice and flaky. I used Imperial margarine, make sure its cold, not too cold though.

I made the mistake of deviating away from these proportions today and the resulting pie crust turned out horrible. I then realized that I should rate THIS pie crust - my go to proportions that taught me how to make a proper, flaky crust. I don't think there is a better pie crust recipe out there!

This is the pie crust that my mother makes and she is THE best pie maker! It's so simple and tender.  I've tried venturing out to "fancier" pie crusts and really, you just can't beat this crust.  It's perfect.

okay im giving this recipe a 3 star because of 2 reasons. 1 it didnt appear to be the flaky melt in your mouth crust I was hoping for, and two although it is a good crust for pot pies etc, for fruits and others its just not that great... will keep looking sorry.

My mom's crust recipe, and Gram's before her. Of course, Gram used lard, and you can too, if you want the ultimate in pie crust. :)
I cheat and use my electric mixer rather then a pastry blender- it's faster and easier- just blend on a low speed till the mixture resembles...corn meal? Sort of like that. It only takes a minute or so.
This recipe really should make enough for 2 crusts, but if you're using deep dishes, you may want to add a third to it- 3 cups flour, 1 cup shortening, etc. And definitely add your water a tablespoon at a time- different types of flour, differing humidities, and so on will all affect the amount of water needed. 
The less you handle it after adding water, the flakier and more tender it will be.
My sister now uses half butter, half Crisco, and swears by it- I'll try that today.
Happy baking!

First time I have ever made a pie crust from scratch. The crust was almost like a bread-y cracker, if that makes sense! lol Followed the recipe to a T and it is ESSENTIAL to mix the water one tablespoon at a time and wait until its fully incorporated before adding the next. I put it on my pie plate and let it sit in the fridge while I worked on my filling. Will use this recipe again!

I used butter rather than shortening.  Otherwise, it was exactly what I wanted - a basic crust.

Awesome and easy pie crust for either dinner pies or dessert! For apple pie and cobblers, I add two tablespoons of sugar and 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon. Delightful!

I used my food processor to make the crust. It was made in 5mins. The crust was flaky and very tasty, I used butter flavored shortening. I refrigerated the crust before using it and it rolled out nicely after. I will be using this recipe over and over. Thank you

I love this crust!  I have used this crust for both sweet and savory pies and it works for both.  However, I like to replace the salt with sugar for sweet pies.

This is the first crust that worked for me, with a bit of experimentation.  I make the following changes.  1, Use 3 cups of flour, 1 of shortening, 1.5 spoons of salt for 2 9" pie crusts.  2. Mix the flour, shortening and salt in a food processor, then turn the mixture out into a bowl before adding water.  3. Start mixing the water in with a fork, then mix the last water in using hands.  4. Roll out with a rolling pin.    Use this for apple pie. Bake for 375 degrees for 40 mins, then 15 mins at 400 degrees, brushing the top crust with beaten egg before baking.

Good pie crust recipe.  Make sure the shortening is cold and use ice water.  If the crust turned out tough that means you overworked it.

Great texture, very flaky yet it maintains it's shape. I love it. I may have added double the amount of water by mistake, but still came out great. Actually it was really easy to roll out and didn't get crumbly. I also used organic seasalt.

This is a favorite pie recipe. The secret to a tender crust is not handling the crust. You can see in the background the pie crust was rolled using a pastry cloth (& rolling pin cover.) I also use a slightly rounded amount of shortening by adding 2 Tablespoons butter at room temp. After cutting dough together, I add liquid, scoop together with a rubber scrapper. Don't handle, warmth of your hand melts shortening making crust tough. Dump on lightly flowered pastry cloth, pull dough into ball by using opposite corners of cloth and cross your hands over & pulling across dough till ball is formed. It may take a few pulls to accomplish. Cut in 1/2 with large knife & push 1/2 aside with knife for the top, again not touching dough. Roll out & place in pan. Crimp & poke with holes. If I'm making a pumpkin pie I pre bake with top edges covered with foil for about 5 min. & than pour filling in pricked crust. No, it won't leak & the bottom doesn't get soggy. I remove foil the last 15 min. baking time so the edges won't over brown.

This was a great pie crust recipe. Though the amount was just barely enough for a thin crust. Maybe try increasing the recipe a little.

A bit bland and I could taste the shortening. Kids didn't like it. Next time I may add a tablespoon of sugar and maybe use butter flavor shortening.

I had the hardest time rolling out this crust.  I used 7 tbsp of water, as it was very stiff with 6.  It kept tearing, and the edges frayed, and I ended up piecing it together best I could.  Not the most user-friendly pie crust I've ever tried.  However, I used butter flavor Crisco and the flavor was excellent and very flaky.

I used the multiplier to make crusts for 6 pies, beware the amt of water you use when doubling this recipe better to work by tablespoons when adding. Also bagged up the dough and refrigerated over night then rolls out each crust while keeping the others in the fridge - easy as pie! Stuck to the rolling pin only a couple of times out of 6crusts - I'm saving this recipe!

I loved this crust.  I use it now for all my pie baking.  One reveiw said they only got one crust but they must have done something wrong because I have always gotten two crust out of it.  This is the best I have tried and I have tried many.

This was such an easy recipe to make!  I added one teaspoon sugar in addition to the salt and it tasted great!  I made the entire batch and froze one by putting it on wax paper and laying wax paper on top and folding in half twice and placing in a freezer bag.  It froze and thawed and was even great after freezing!

Take my advice: Do not use this crust for a pecan pie. Maybe it would be better for a fruit pie or a pot pie, so there is juices to give it flavor, but not with pecan. The crust had no flavor whatsoever. Sorry, I won't ever make this again.

Had to double the recipe to get the amount needed for my pie.  I also had to add more water to keep it from crumbling.  It tasted delicious but the directions and measurements as written seem off to me.

Wonderful recipe! It gets only 4 stars because I actually modified the recipe a bit... because I never cook with shortening. Instead I used 1/3 cup butter and 1/3 cup coconut oil. I only have to use 5 tablespoons of water and don't have to put it in the fridge. My mother-in-law just said it was the best crust she'd ever had.

Very basic pie crust that anyone can make, even if for the first time.  However, I have a real problem with pie crust recipes when they use ONLY shortening.  You HAVE to use a little bit of butter for a good tasting pie.  Now I'm not saying don't use shortening at all, shortening is good at making the crust flaky, but if you just use shortening, it's going to have a funny chemical taste to it.  Some reviews here mentioned this crust was too salty, but that's actually the shortening they're tasting.  If you're butter conscious, then at least use butter flavored shortening.  Real unsalted butter is a LOT better, of course.  

One other tip might be to add vinegar or lemon juice to the water that you use.  Do this especially if you don't use shortening at all so that you can still get that flaky texture.

Easy recipe that stood up to my terrible technique. I felt too lazy to roll out dough for a quiche that was only for me, so I just used my fingers to press it into the pie pan and up the sides. Despite the heat from my hands it still turned up great--and easy enough that I put it together while I was frying the quiche filling!

Great recipe!  (I used it for Apple Pie.) Not having sugar in the crust was a nice balance to the sugary applie pie! Normally I buy premade crust at the store.  But my husband (an apple pie connoisseur) likes this much better than store bought.  It would be perfect for a quiche too!  This recipe is a keeper.

I had never made my own pie crust before, but when faced with a pile of rhubarb and a deadline for dessert, I had no choice but to whip one up! This crust was really easy to make, and tasted great. I will use this recipe every time I bake a pie.

Its a good recipe. A simple recipe. However, if you are using  Gluten Free Flour, I suggest you add at least one egg to the mix. Otherwise, it's hard as hell to work. (crumbles in your hands). Also refrigeration before hand, kind of helps.

This was very easy to make, I, however had to add 1 more cup of flour and another 1/3 cup of shortening to make two pie crust for an apple pie. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla.

Added 2 tablespoons of sugar and I needed 2 extra tablespoons of water for the pie crust to come together, otherwise a good recipe for those who don't have vinegar for the other flaky pie crust on this site.

This is now my flagship crust. From chicken pot pie to apple pie, it's always great. Flaky yet moist, even when the pie is a few days old..

This was a very easy recipe.  It was my first time making pie crust from scratch and it turned out great!  I added sugar to it just because I was making an apple berry pie. I also cut the recipe in half because I only needed one crust.  Even my mom, who doesn't like pie crust,  said it was good.

I have been battling pie crusts for many years and have finally bowed down and started to buy the pre-made stuff. But, for some inkling wanted to try making a crust one more time because I had some terrific peaches and wanted to make a pie. Well, I DID IT... finally made a beautiful pie and it was delicious as well. Easy recipe, bakes well... happy pie maker now

I wanted an easy pie crust for my first solo pie-making attempt and this one seemed to be just that. It was quite easy, simple, and tasted wonderful. Since I'm not a big fan of super flakey crust, this was just what I wanted. Shortbread-esque you could say.

I will use this again and again!  I had yet to be successful with a homemade pie crust, but I killed it with this recipe!  It was SO easy to work with, I ended up using an extra tablespoon of water, but I don't know that I even needed it.  It wasn't "the best" pie crust I have ever had, but don't let that deter, it was very good and came out beautiful when brushed with egg whites and sprinkled with sugar.  Thank you for giving me the confidence to do homemade pie crust!

This pie crust is wonderful!  I had never made pie crust before, and this one is easy & has always been very flaky & tasty!  I followed directions exactly, and used lard for the shortening.  I also made sure the lard was cold.  Very good, will not be buying pie crusts in the future, definitely a keeper!

Made this exactly as written.  Light and flaky yes, but no flavor.  Looking at the ingredient list will tell you that.  I think it could be improved with butter flavored shortening.

Made it with potato-cheese filling (mashed potatoes, generous amounts of cheese, onion, milk, pepper and salt) and ended up eating the sides before the filling! Nice and flaky, suitable for savory fillings.

I really liked this recipe. I used 1/2 tsp salt- but everything else was the same, and my pie came out soooo delicious. It is the perfect pie crust with just the right flaky texture and savory taste. It went great with cherry filling.

This is definitely the only way I will be making pie crust from now on.  I used the crust for a chicken pot pie and the crust was so flaky and tender. I have never been able to make good pie crust and have always hated doing it.  Not anymore. Thanks so much for sharing your recipe!!

Decrease salt to 1/2 tsp.  Nice and flakey.  Good flavor.  A keeper.

I have never been able to make a pie crust in all my 55 years that actually turned out.  This one is a winner.  It has turned out perfectly every time.  I've used it with chocolate cream pies, chocolate chip cookie pies, pumpkin pies and a strawberry pie (which flopped and the filling instead of setting up turned to liquid).  This pie crust stays flaky and never has become soggy in all my attempts.  I purchased some 8 1/4 inch deep dish aluminum pie tins at Dollar General - and 2 recipes will make crusts for 5 of these.  Using my Mom's old glass pie pans, getting 2 is a stretch, they'll be super thin.  Leftover dough gets rolled out, cut and sprinkled with sugar and baked.  Great little treat.  Thanks for the recipe!  I now am the pie crust maker for myself and my 81 year old aunt.  I feel honored.

Bravo! I had a failed attempt at one of the other pie crust recipes and this recipe came to my rescue! I liked the idea of not having to chill for 4 hours. When I want pie, I want it now, not 4 hours from now! :) The crust was perfect and flakey. I would definitely reccomend an egg wash prior to baking.

This was the easiest pie crust I have ever made, and tasted fantastic.
