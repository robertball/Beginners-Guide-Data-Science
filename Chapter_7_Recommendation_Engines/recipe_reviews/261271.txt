I originally didn't change anything but as the potatoes were baking there was a big layer of grease on the top.  I ended up having to add instant potatoes to it to soak it up.  Next time I would cut back on the cheese or butter and bake more potatoes.

I cheated and used instant potatoes (time thing). Everything else the same. Easy and delicious. Family loved it. I will try it again with real potatoes. I know it will be fantastic!  Thanks for sharing

I took the easy and fast way to bake my potatoes, I nuked them.
I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt and added salt and pepper to taste. I didn't measure the cheese so I'm sure I added more than called for, but we're cheese fanatics. Casserole was very tasty and next time I will leave the potatoes chunkier because of personal preference.

I really enjoyed this recipe! Only change I made was that I left my potatoes in bite sized chunks, and that I made it with a homemade cheese sauce because Iâ€™ve tried this recipe before and felt it needed a small and minor tweak!

Made it like the recipe said except I did take one short cut.  I cooked my potatoes in the microwave instead of in the oven.   8 minutes was a lot better than 50 minutes.  everyone liked it and I will definitely make it again.

Made this for Christmas dinner.  Added crumbled bacon.  Will make this again.   Left out garlic...don't like garlic.  I also did the potatoes in the microwave....much faster.
