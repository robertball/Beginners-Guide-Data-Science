This was an extremely simple recipe to use, and the scones turned out tasty. I didn't have quite enough cream, but it was very forgiving when I added extra milk and butter to make up for it. Will definitely make again, and I'm thinking of adding dried cranberries and orange zest so my coworkers don't go to starbucks for scones anymore :D

I've used a similar recipe for years (mine has 2 eggs and 1/4 cup butter). If you increase the sugar to 1/4 cup you can add the zest of an orange and a cup of dried cranberries, frost when cool with orange glaze - and who needs Starbucks!

I added 3/4 cups of sugar instaed of the tablespoon. It was very good and, doing it my way, would be great with a cup of black coffee.

I had no all purpose flour so I used self-rising! it came out very good! I also shaped the dough into a circle instead of a rectangle! Made cutting the scones so much easier! I used my pizza cutter to cut the dough into pie shaped wedges! This is a great tasting scone!

Quick. Easy. Yummy! Instead of melting the butter, I chopped cold butter into very small pieces and cut it into the flour mixture, and I also added a bit more cream. Very good with real British Clotted Cream. The result was a flaky scone. Brilliant!

I made these scones one night for dinner when my kids wanted pancakes but I didn't have any eggs.  I too used 3/4 cup sugar and added a big handful of dried blueberries.  This made a fantastic meal with some hot cocoa.  I made much more than 6 though - maybe I cut them smaller.  They turned out great!!!

Very good recipe. First time I ever made scones and it was very simple. I made two batches-one regular w/choc. chips and then another with cinnamon, brown sugar & allspice. With both recipes I used 3/4 cups sugar like other reviewers did-you have to watch the consistency on the brown sugar ones-make sure they don't get too dry. I've found you want the consistency to be very palliable-kinda soft-kinda like play-dough-you don't want it to be so dry it crumbles-easy to work with-not dry. You could easily modify this recipe in so many ways!! Good recipe!

Love recipes that are easy and leave room for improvisation. I made Blackberry/Raspberry scones with fresh fruit instead of dried. The dough was sticky but it all worked out well. So tasty! Might make a glaze to go over top :)

Good recipe! I had to add more liquid to make the dough stick together though. Light and flaky results!

my first time making scones and these turned out great!  they were a little crumbly, but that is an easy fix for the next batch and definitely my mistake.  i made them exactly how the recipe called and i liked mine with a little honey drizzled over the top and my husband loved them as is with a cup of tea.  i think next time i will experiment with chocolate chips, but this is a fantastic recipe as is!

One 29-oz can of peaches, drained well with the back of a spoon and 1/2c of white chips (and I used buttermilk instead of milk and cream- 1/2c + a bit) and you have peaches and cream scones that I think I'll be making every week for a while. They're wetter than scones, like drop biscuits, but yummy - I bake at 375. They got a great rating at hubby's work, and the recipe was requested.

I did not care for this recipe at all. It was just sweet biscuits with blueberries, not even close to a scone in texture. It was way to fluffy. I might modify the recipe to use for biscuits. It was an easy recipe but just nothing that resembled a proper scone.

I loved it! the scone wasn't too dense, and it had the perfect amount of sweetness. I added a little more milk than called for, and some cinnamon.  It is good with clotted cream, and Apple butter. Not everyone may think that this recipe is awesome, but my baking skills are perfectly mediocre, so these turned out really good for me. All in all, loved the recipe, will use it again

These were nice; they tasted more like a biscuit than a traditional scone, though. I added 1/2 cup chopped fresh strawberries, and made a glaze using powdered sugar, strawberry jam and milk. Next time I will add more sugar to the dough.

Perfection. I made these exactly per instructions, except for size. I used a 2-1/2" cookie/biscuit cutter and it made 12. To have them look like the photo, I'd suggest rolling them out to 1/2" thickness since they rise quite a bit. They were done at 10 mins., although I might check them at 9 in the future. Excellent scone, very tender and not gaggy-sweet and I'm pleased with myself for this first-ever effort. Thank you, MirrorMask for a treat that reminds me of a trip to the UK. I'll definitely make these again!

These scones were  easy to make and tasted very good.  I did use more sugar, 1/4 cup, and added some dried cranberries. Next time I may use a different dried fruit, maybe raisins or dried cherries.

Loved it, made several different types & it adapted well. I made sweet ones & savory ones for work & home. They were a hit. I made them into flat rounds & but into quarters for a couple bites for them.

This has been a favorite of mine for awhile!  (In fact, I pretty much made an allrecipies account just so that I could comment on this one recipe.  :)  )
When I was sent a link for this recipe, the suggested variation was to double the sugar, and add 2 tsp of vanilla and 1/2 to 3/4 cup of chocolate chips.  They come out so nicely!

This scones are very yummy. I did use 3/4 cup of sugar instead of the 1 TB called for.
