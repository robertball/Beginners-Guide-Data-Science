Delicious! The curry powder in this is genius! I had to leave out the pecans but I bet they add a nice texture. I roasted in my convection oven at 350 and it took only 30 minutes. Next time I will use a casserole dish though; I used a jelly roll pan (I scaled the servings to 3) and all the delicious sauce flowed to the edges of the pan and burned, instead of caramelizing on the potatoes. The sauce, it's so good!

Would give this 5.5 stars if I could. Complex flavors, ease of preparation, and the aroma while cooking--all play into this score. The hint of orange in the fresh cranberry sauce is divine. Definitely a "keeper."

I loved it!  I made a double recipe and took it to work for our annual holiday potluck and took home an empty container!  I switched the pecans for black walnuts.  I like their richer flavor!

One of the best sweet potato recipes I've ever made. I try a new yam recipe every Thanksgiving, and this was fabulous. I really enjoyed the orange and curry. Also, I agree with the others that 30 to 35 minutes is plenty of baking time. More than that and the pecans will burn. Hint: I fully prepared this the night before and stuck it in the fridge, so the morning of all I had to do was stick it in the oven. Worked perfectly!

The flavors of this dish were fantastic, but too sweet. We will be making this again, but omitting the brown sugar. Really liked the curry powder addition.
