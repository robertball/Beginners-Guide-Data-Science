Not a bad maccaroni salad. I used low fat mayo as I thought 18 grams of fat per serving was way too much for a "healthier"macaroni salad. I also added paprika. Brought this to  a bbq.Not a great hit. Most people did not like the whole wheat maccaroni. Next time will use white.

Made with white shells, skipped the carrots and red pepper for a "white and green look" only.  Substituted half or more greek yogurt for the mayonnaise and added 2 Tbl. dried tarragon.  Tasty for our hungry work crew in hot weather ... complimented pulled pork sandwiches.

I have made this very basic recipe for years, and have never added or needed to add either sugar or vinegar. The quality of your mayonnaise should be more than adequate for the recipe. Too much sugar already used in too much of our food these days, and this one certainly does not need such add.

As a diabetic, I'm all about making healthier choices. So I omitted the sugar, the vinegar and reduced the Mayo to 1/2 cup making up the other 1/2 cup difference with poppyseed dressing.

I only used 3/4 cup of mayonnaise but added about 2 tablespoons of Italian dressing. I used less sugar, around 2 tablespoons, since the dressing has a little sweetness to it. I also added a crown of broccoli with stalk for crunchiness. It was fast, easy, and had all the ingredients at home for a last minute party dish. People were fighting over leftovers at the end of the night.

Substituted Splenda for sugar.  Substituted Hengstenberg Vinegar w herbs (white) for white vinegar.  I did not have fresh peppers, but always keep frozen pepper strips and used them - a melange of yellow, green, and red peppers.  Followed recipe amounts exactly.  Used Barilla ProteinPlus elbows.  Absolutely delicious!!!

First of all, I agree with the various reviewers who say no vinegar is necessary, which also makes the added sugar unnecessary (in my house, white vinegar is a cleaning product, not a food, although I do use other vinegars - occasionally). Since I make my own mayonnaise, that was enough of that. But, my goodness, how can you make macaroni salad without seasonings? I use a variety of herbs, depending on what smells good the day I cook; more so now that my doctor tells me to reduce sodium. And I would NEVER leave out the garlic! I've come a long way since my mother taught me that "seasoning" consisted of salt and pepper - and the pepper was optional.  Oh, and healthier or not, I cannot abide whole wheat pasta, so I used regular semolina. I also appreciated the reviewer who used corn instead of carrots, and the one who suggested green onions. I always have those!

The only change I made was to eliminate the sugar entirely. Just as tasty without the added sugar, especially with the carrots added to the mix.

When I make a double batch for pot luck dinners at church, I triple the dressing to make it a little juicier. I also add 2-3 fresh jalapenos. Everyone seems to like it!

Thanks for this recipe.  I make it often during the summer.  Slight variation though. I took out the pimento and added diced cucumbers.  My kids gobble it up.

Actually to make this a healthy macaroni salad, just cutting the sugar and using wheat elbow macaroni doesn't cut it!!  Ya gotta cut the fat!!   So I used low fat mayo.   NOW it's a healthy macaroni salad and still tastes wonderful and still creamy!!  No one could tell the difference!!

I made it for my party last night and another lady wanted the recipe so bad that she wants me to bring it over to her house once I get it printed out.  She has a party that she will go to and she wants to bring this dish with her . 
Love it so much., thanks! :))))

This was the best macaroni salad I've ever made. Everyone loved it. I will definitely be making this again, and probably claiming it's a secret family recipe ;-)

I found this delicious but it's not the traditional creamy type but for me a good alternative.  I skipped the mustard on mine and later some one added some condensed milk to it creamy.
