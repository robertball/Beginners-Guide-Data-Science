I thought this was great for a fat free recipe.  I did tweak it to reduce calories by substituting the sugar with no calorie sweetener.  I used a relish that had Splenda in it.  Also, I would recommend using apple cider vinegar (if that's your preference) instead of white vinegar.  Another can of kidney beans would be fabulous, and you could easily change this to a more traditional three bean salad by using regular canned green beans and canned waxed beans.  Garbanzo beans would be a great addition as well.

Two stars because the quantities needed changing.  I used fresh green and yellow beans, that were cooked tender-crisp.  One cup of chopped sweet onion is enough and if using sweet pickle relish reduce quantity to 1/4 cup.  I increased chopped peppers to 1 cup and used red and green. Alter the quantities of white vinegar and sugar to taste.  Some enjoy tart and some sweet.  The bones of this recipe are good; nice combination but it needed, for me, adjustment.  It's worth making and different.
