I hate uncooked spinach. I am also not a big fan of strawberries. However, I am addicted to this wonderful salad. I could eat it everyday. 5+

The only change I make is using olive oil instead.

It is that something different you are looking for... Sweet and tart with a pleasant hint of dill. I have made this salad many times, for those informal dinners after work and those formal dinners with friends. Every time it has been a huge hit. You can never fail with this recipe!

Such a light and refreshing salad ... BUT the dressing has TOO much vinegar for the sweetness of the fruit.  I added 1/4 c fresh raspberries and used bottled raspberry dressing instead.

I really liked this salad, but used more toasted sesame seeds than called for in the recipe, and also threw some sugar in with the dressing, as I thought it was a bit bitter.

Very easy and delicious!  I ended up not using all of the dressing, but I put it on the table if anyone wanted extra, which no one did.  This leaves me some so I can make up a salad for lunch tomorrow....an added bonus!

I selected this one for the lower calories. It was nice. I did add about two tablespoons of sliced almonds to the pan when I browned the sesame seeds. I also minced fresh onion instead of using powder.

I made this delicious salad for a pot luck and came home with an empty dish.  It was a huge hit and I passed the recipe on to several people.  I chose this recipe over similar ones as it uses less oil and sugar in the dressing.  Highly recommended.

I have been making this salad for years now and it's always a hit, especially at Christmas dinner. It's very festive with the green and red colors of the spinach and strawberries. I do not add cayenne pepper and I highly suggest using fresh baby spinach. I used canola oil one year, but strongly prefer vegetable oil. There is never any left no matter how much I make.

This salad was not only fantastic but made a beautiful presentation when featured with Aussie Chicken (also from this website).  Our homecooked meal could have easily come from a restaurant!

YUM!!!!  Followed directions exactly.  A BIG hit at the neighbor's swim party too.  I was glad that someone posted that it was also good with mandarin oranges.  It turned out the host of the party didn't like strawberry's, so I got some mandarins and made a special bowl just for him.  EXCELLENT!  It's good without the toasted sesame seeds, but the sesame seeds make it go from good to AWESOME.

Bland. I felt the oil took over in this recipe.  I didn't toast my sesame seeds and scaled this back to 3 servings.  Added mandarin orange slices and left out the dry hot mustard.  If I try this again, I will cut way back on the oil or use EVOO.

Woa! This was a *great* salad! Since we are not very salty people, I halved the salt, and even that was a tad too noticeable for us, but all in all, it is a super salad! Thanks so much for the recipe, Karen!

Amazing! Sesame seeds add so much. I modified using equal parts olive to canola oil so as to up healthy factor and reduce the (overpowering) flavors of both. Also, I reduced the oil by about 1.5 Tbs to make the dressing thicker to coat the salad and not so oily. Perfect for what I was seeking!

I added dressing and seeds just before serving. Yum!

I am always time and ingredient challenged so I simplified the recipe and it was great.

For the dressing I used:
1/2 cup vegetable oil 
1/3 cup red wine vinegar 
1/3 cup white sugar 
2 tsp minced onion
pinch of salt 
1/4 teaspoon dry hot mustard 

(twist lightly toast pecans in the oven and toss with the salad)

I Whisked the dressing ingredients together for better blending and absorption of flavors. It helped to minimize the separation of the oil and vinegar and also thickened the mixture. 

Fabulous. Cut down on the sugar a bit, if you're worried about the calories.

Really simple and quick to put together. I left out the sesame seeds as we didn't have any in the house. I really love the dressing and have been using it on other salads as well.

I made a couple of changes: omitted the mustard (just forgot to put it in!), and cut the sugar in half!  I also added cukes and mushrooms.  Served with sirloin tips and crusty bread - really good!

After trying the spring strawberry salad (and not being satisfied by the sweet but not interesting enough flavors of the poppy seed dressing, berries and spinach)I decided to try this recipe for a more robust flavor. This savory, flavorful dressing combined with the dill tossed strawberries and spinach was the perfect combination of fresh, light, spring flavors and the savory interest that my palate prefers.  Good enough recipe to serve as a small part of my Easter dinner for a large gathering & loved how easy it was to mix up with all the spices I already had on hand.

This is my absolute favorite salad to make and eat!  Everyone loves it!  The only alterations I made is to use sliced almonds instead of the sesame seeds, and I add about 1/2 cup (or less) of Crumbled Goat's Milk Feta Cheese (PC Brand).  Mmmmmmmm!!!  Thanks to my husband, I have an empty Grolsch bottle I use to keep my salad dressing in - thanks to the swing top bottle, I always have fresh dressing at the ready!

We really enjoyed this!  My husband loved the hint of spiciness with the sweetness of the fruit.  I added strawberries and mandarin oranges to our salad and used honey roasted sliced almonds instead of sesame seeds.  We also grilled some chicken breasts and sliced them on top of the salad.  YUM!

With a couple of changes this salad was perfect & everyone loved it. I left out the dill weed simply because I did not have any and wasn't sure everyone would like it. Also, I put extra Cayanne pepper, not too much, in the dressing and also added poppyseeds. It was great!
