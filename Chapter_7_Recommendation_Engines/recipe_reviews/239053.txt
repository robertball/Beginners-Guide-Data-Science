Excellent! I kept the ingredients the same but changed the toasting method of the bread. I placed the olive oil tossed bread cubes on a cookie sheet in a 400 degree oven for approx. 5 min. Stirred and sprinkled with the Parmesan, then continued to bake until nicely browned. This recipe doesn't disappoint.

Very tasty salad!  I've had it before YEARS ago (maybe 30?), & it was, as Chef John says, a little less pleasant because of the sogginess of the bread.  I wonder though, if you could use a high quality basalmic vinager instead of red wine vinegar?  I purchased some from Italy when I visited my Daughter.  It's a 5 year, wooden cask cured Basalmic (which I use ONLY on something that it "really" matters on, like this salad (the longer it's cured, especially in a wooden cask, makes it FAR superior to what you get at the grocers.  It's expensive, but what Heavenly flavor!!!  I do confess though, I've made croutons this way since I was a girl, & my Dad would make his favorite noodle dish, croutons, parm., cottage cheese and noodles.  I have the recipe for "that" dish in my A/R Recipe box, again, thanks to my friends the "Buzzers" on the A/R site (The Buzz).  It's a great resource for all of us on A/R. It's complimentary with membership, AND there are a boatload of nice folks on there who can answer almost any question or recipe request you can imagine and seem to love doing so!

This recipe looked simple and fun. It was! I made it even easier by using bagged Cheese & Garlic Croutons, and hot house tomatoes. Also used fresh basil from my garden and added shrimp that I'd cooked in a garlic, red pepper flake, olive oil & butter mix. Turned it into a meal rather than a side. My husband went back for seconds!

Huge hit! Thought I would burn the bread. I didn't. The cheese did stick to the bottom of pan and I had to run outside to avoid the smoke detector going off but I actually used the scrapings in the salad and it was yummy. I didn't use any sugar and I only had balsamic vinegar handy so that's what I used. It was really tasty. Thanks once again Chef John for another keeper

Wow! Once again Chef John has come up with a great recipe.  I was tempted to bake the bread cubes but I followed the recipe and am I glad I did.  This was delicious!  The bread was not soggy at all.  The only change I made was to add fresh chives. When I went out to pick the basil leaves the chives just called out to me and I couldn't resist. This was wonderful now I can't wait for the grape tomatoes to come in.

I was looking through my stash of recipes looking for something inspiring to make. I came across this and instantly remembered how much I loved this salad. I didn't change a thing then and I won't this time either. Why mess with perfection? This salad along with some hot sausage just off the grill, and you have a great meal for a hot summer evening. Ahhh, life is good!

This is an amazing salad. I've made it before, but never thought to fry the bread cubes. It makes all the difference. If you've ever experienced crunchy soaked bread, you'll understand. This is so easy and so wonderfully tasty, you'll want to make it every day. So delicioso!

Best panzanella I EVER had. The frying of the bread with generous amounts of olive oil and coating the croutons with Parmagiano Regiano is key and the very best technique! Love the way Chef John judges the amount of dressing needed, too. This is a huge favorite with family and friends!!

I made this recipe exactly as written.  Deep down in my heart I knew that I didn’t like the 50/50 ratio of the oil and vinegar, but the recipe had such great reviews, that I went with it.
For our taste, it was too acid.  I usually use  3 to 4 parts oil to one part acid.  
Everything else was great!  For personal preference, I will change the dressing slightly.

I've never had panzanella before today, and I think I would have liked even soggy bread cubes with really great summer tomatoes. However, I trust Chef John and was ready to risk the time and tomatoes to his recipe. I liked Chef's  idea to fry the bread cubes and also cut them in 1/2 in. cubes. I just used my pre-sliced sourdough bread from the freezer to cut cubes. Cherry tomatoes are not my favorite, but I bought  some grape tomatoes at Raley's, but locally grown. Living in the Central Valley in August is really an advantage in this way, at least. I followed the recipe exactly and was amazed at the deliciousness! Thanks, Chef!

The key to this recipe is “to taste.”  I used too much garlic and tried to dilute it with more vinegar.  It was ok, but the next time I make it, I’ll have a clue what to taste means for this recipe.

Chef John's trick for frying the bread with parmesan for Panzanella is genius! I have been frying croutons with parm for years for caesar salad. Why did I never think to do this for Panzanella? This was the BEST Panzanella ever. I used half red wine vinegar and half olive with a little sugar and salt, just like he advised,  and that was perfect. I used the toy box tomatoes, too, but I digressed slightly and added a little crisp-roasted asparagus (because I needed to use it), a little thinly sliced salad turnip (because they had come out of the ground that day and I couldn't resist) and about a half of a minced shallot, in addition the small amount of garlic and basil (I used a little more basil). But the tomatoes made up the bulk of the vegetables and they were certainly the star. Everyone loved this and I can't wait to make it again!

Made this during the winter and used Roma tomatoes and dried basil (what I had on hand) and it still tasted superb! Wow, nice and tangy with a crunch. I was going to have it with some chicken but I ended up just eating the salad all by itself. Great vegetarian dish too. Any time I have stale bread, I'll be making this tasty dish.

This was the first salad to go at the party.  People couldn't get enough.  I followed this video exactly and used Sourdough bread.  Hours later, even sitting in the vinegar, the croutons were still crunchy.  This is my new favorite.  Thank you, Chef John!

Definitely will make this again!!  I used heirloom tomatoes because our plants have PRODUCED!   And I added minced green onions.  Next time I'm going to bake the bread and make it whole grain.  And add cucumbers.  And no salt.  It will make it better for my husband and myself.  I can't wait to use another Chef John recipe!

I followed the recipe and the results were fantastic! I had leftover salad and was a little reluctant to have it for lunch (afraid it would be soggy) the next day...surprise, it was actually better the next day!

My family and friends love this recipe.  I love it because of the tomatoes and everyone else because of the croutons.  I follow CJ’s recipe as closely as possible except for these minor changes: 1) wok instead of frying pan because I make at least a gallon of the croutons at a time, 2) I cook them way past the perfect golden brown shown on the video since this keeps the infidels wondering through the kitchen from eating too many, too soon, 3) hide the finished bowl until it is time to eat or the bread thieves turn it into a marinated tomato dish.  Since I am the tomato lover in the family I try to only use the “toy box” tomatoes shown in the video since they add greatly to the appearance of the dish.

The method of toasting the bread in olive oil and then adding the parmigiano is genius! I've been making panzanella for a number of years now, and that really took this one over the top. I did add some bocconcini (mini mozzarella balls), red onion, Gaeta olives and fresh parsley from my garden.  We served this with grilled ribeye steaks, and it was delicious!

This was so simple and so great.  I never thought of frying the bread chunks before.  Who knew?  It was so excellent.  Please make this salad exactly as described and you won't be sorry.

This is the best panzanella salad ever!  The hardest part is not eating all of the croutons before you mix them with the tomatoes.  I make a bunch of croutons in advance and keep them in the fridge, so I can make this salad any time I want with little effort.   It's really important to stick to John's technique - seemingly small things like cutting the tomatoes in half vs. using them whole makes a huge difference.  This recipe is a keeper!   Thank you, John!

This was great.  I made it exactly as directions said except that I placed my cubed bread in the oven at 200 degrees to make it "stale" and I was very happy with the results.  It was a little tangy so I think next time I'll cut down a bit on the vinegar, but I will make this again for sure.   Great way to use up old bread.

No changes. We have been looking for a recipe that didn't  have soggy bread. This is the one. Just perfect especially with our own tomatoes. The viniagrette was well balanced also. Congrats to Chef John

Excellent! I made it exactly per Chef John's instructions and this tasted so good I had to keep grabbing a piece of bread from the salad as I walked by. This is my first time making Panzanella but it will not be my last. This stuff is so good!

The great thing about a panzanella is, you can tweak it to your liking as much as you want. I rated this recipe 5 stars for the Parmigiano idea. Great! But then I also added some olives and mozzarella. And I like making it with a dash of Balsamico thrown it, but that's just how I roll. ;-)

I made it according to the recipe--"it's excellent" says my husband, who is very fond of "real" Panzanela salad, hard to find in restaurants. The browning of the bread cubes really is the secret,  esp. once the cheese is added. A keeper for sure.

This is such an easy and delicious side dish. I have made it several times, always to rave reviews. Always the first thing gone at dinner parties. Very easy to make, and it's great to toast the bread ahead of time, then the tomato mix, and just throw together right before you serve it. I love garlicky so I up the garlic. And I throw in a lot of basil fresh from the garden.  Otherwise I serve as is. Such a great summer dish!

Another delicious recipe from Chef John! (His many recipes on this site as consistently excellent.) I had not done bread cubes this way before and I loved how crispy they stayed!
