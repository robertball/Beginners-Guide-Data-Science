I am giving this recipe 5 stars. Even though I made some minor changes. I used italian turkey sausage and a package of chili seasoning. Just like chili should taste like. And of course on my sering I added hot sauce.

I had hot Italian sausage on hand, so I left out the separate amount of chili.  My diced tomatoes didn't have garlic in them, but I had fresh garlic on hand so I chopped two cloves in with the onions.  It was a tasty hot dinner; quick to the table and used up my leftover spaghetti sauce and pasta in the bargain.  I didn't use the sour cream or green onions toppings, just the mozzarella cheese and some grated parmesan.

Contadina Italian Chili Haiku: "Very, very rich. Had to eat over noodles, then it's more like sauce." Other than the addition of kidney beans, we felt like we were eating a very chunky tomato sauce over rotini; that's not to say that this wasn't delicious, but it was hard to spoon it into my mouth and think, "mmm chili!" to myself. Followed the recipe as written, altho I think my beans were Great Northern, not Cannellini - close enough, they're white.
