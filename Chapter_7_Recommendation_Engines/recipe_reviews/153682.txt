Very good recipe, and simple to make.  I thought it was very different than our normal pasta dishes.  I will definitely make this again!

I had found a couple of packs of prosciutto in the fridge that I need to be used up and I came across this recipe.  I did have to change a couple of things due to what I had available.  I had to use some dried basil and left out the mint.  Everything else I did leave the same.  It was very easy and something different.   Thanks!

This recipe is great; Creamy sauce yet not a heavy sauce, very tasty & light. I made it last night and even though I didnt add mint, since I'm not a fan- everyone loved it! the prosciutto it' s a bonus. Great recipe

Simple recipe and fairly good. For my family I had to double the liquid ingredients and the cheese.  It appears to be dry without the extra sauce. I used parsley and basil from my garden, nice and fresh.

Loved this dish; truly one of the best pasta dishes I've had - such a treat when you're a fan of creamy pastas but sick of the eating either them with either chicken or shrimp all the time. Only changes I made were doubling up on the liquid and adding some extra of the fresh herbs, and lightly sprinkling some red pepper flakes on before serving (only because I'm really into spicy food; I wouldn't suggest adding the red pepper flakes unless you like to add heat whenever possible, because you don't want it to overpower the delicate flavor. A definite 5 stars.

This is a great quick meal if you  have the ingredients on hand. I added some petite sweet peas which go nicely with the mint. I've made this several times now and my husband loves it!  Will definitely make this again.

I ended up using whole wheat linguine, and didn't have mint on hand, but I really didn't think this recipe was all that great, as it was  a little bland, but perhaps it's because I didn't follow the recipe to a T.
