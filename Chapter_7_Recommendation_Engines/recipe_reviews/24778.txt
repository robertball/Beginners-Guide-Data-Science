The chicken is very crunchy and has a nice coat to it. At first I was going to give it 3 stars but that is only because I believe the chicken could use alot more "seasoning" my usual fried chicken is very flavorful and has a great amount of spices which is usually the case in African American households. However since different people have different palates I would have to say the chicken is pretty good. I did season the chicken before I started the recipe, but none of the pre seasoning came through. I would suggest to heavily flavor the flour cornstarch mixture if you like a fried chicken with more spices.
By the way mix the soup with the egg and seasoning salt in a small bowl, have the chicken in another bowl, after your done mixing the soup with the other ingredients just dump it on the chicken and mix it together then put it in a ziploc bag wih the flour/cornstarch mixture and shake, same principle less mess.

I've made this several times now, the other night we had my mom over (who makes excellent fried chicken!) and she loved it and asked for the recipe!  I do add some extra spices to the flour mixture, depending on my mood of the day.  I don't find it all that messy to make, probably because I'm a messy cook at the best of times.  I usually use a whole chicken cut up instead of just breasts, and toss the pieces in a bag to coat with the soup, then put on a rack over a cookie sheet to drain the excess for a minute or two before the flouring step.  Maybe that saves a little mess, but it also works quickly for me.  I'm usually cooking for 7 to 10 people, so I'm doing large batches.  The bags go in the trash, the rack and cookie sheet go in the dishwasher, so the little mess is no big deal.  Use tongs to handle the chicken, you can rinse them when the dough builds up on them and keep your fingers clean at the same time.

Excellent fried chicken recipe!  I used cream of mushroom w/garlic soup and instant mashed potato flakes instead of cornstarch.  Also added garlic and onion powder, paprika and a bit of chili powder.  Let the chicken sit in the soup mixture for about an hour, then breaded it, let that sit for about 20 minutes.  I did not find this messy at all.  All batter stuck to chicken and it was delicious.

Very good!  The breading was crispy and tasty.  Just be aware that you need to let the chicken sit for a while in the breading to get to the right consistency.  I waited almost an hour and probably could have waited longer if my family wasn't so hungry!  
I used chicken tenders and fried them in a deep fryer.  They came out delicious.

I think it is a good idea to *always* make a habit of reading reviews before you make a recipe here. People who have made the recipe will always give you good tips on how to make it even better. 

I modified this recipe by marinading the chicken breasts in chopped garlic, salt, freshly ground pepper, a bit of olive oil and a touch of white wine for several hours. I used cream of mushroom soup with 1 chicken bullion cube added and then made the recipe as it was written. It was very very tasty and I will be making it again.

Loved this recipe.  I doubled the recipe & used Skin on Chicken Thighs & legs.  I added a pint of Buttermilk to the soup & let it soak for about a half an hour.  The skin really plumped up & the chicken inside was very moist.  Wondering if you could freeze them afterwards?

What a fantastic recipe! Being an Englishman I looked across the Atlantic for the best way to produce fried chicken. I have certainly found a winner in this recipe. Everyone loved it. I followed previous advice from other responses and added other spices to the flour mix. I let the mixture sit for an hour before deep-frying. The end result was golden brown, crunchy and delicious! Well done Candy.

Allright, people, what did you expect?  Fried chicken is never easy to make and always messy!  Get over it!  All in all - the recipe was decent. It was great as far as crispness goes, but a little bland.  I've made it twice and the second time, I really added a lot of spices.  Turned out great the second time around!  Served it with mashed potatoes and fried pickles!

At last -- chicken that has a crunchy, delicious coating that doesn't come off in the pan!  After reading some of the reviews, I decided to spice it up a little by adding some Italian dressing mix to the flour mixture.  Loved it!

Made this tonight for myself and husband.  (the kids were asleep).  I found it to be pretty good.  Obviously NOT kfc, but I don't have the pressure fryer or MSG.  But it was one of the Best home recipes I have had.  I was worried because we discovered that we didn't have any pepper. (pepper make the spice),  I fried it in butter flavored crisco.  (I was out of oil too.  IT was wonderful and juicy.  Another note, I let the chicken stand in the soup mix for like 30 minutes in the fridge while I looked for pepper.  Awesome.  Will make again.

*** READ REVIEWS BEFORE MAKING THIS RECIPE!!  As many others have said, the technique for this recipe is great- soaking in condensed soup (I thinned out the soup with milk) does help the flour and cornstarch coating stick well to the chicken. I made this with bone-in chicken legs and waited about 45 minutes to let the flour coating become "doughy". The result was a beautiful and crispy coating with tender and juicy meat (that was done in about 15 minutes of frying at medium-high heat in my wok).   While the technique is good, the spice level for this recipe is WAY off. The first time I made it, I followed the recipe and it was a bland disappointment. I CAN NOT STRESS HOW BLAND IT WAS!!! The second time, I doubled the garlic and paprika, then added a half teaspoon each of: oregano, rosemary, thyme, Montreal chicken spice, celery seed, seasoning salt, regular salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning. This was barely enough- in fact, the spices still could not be really tasted. Next time I will add even more.   Since the fat content of this recipe is off the charts and I won't be making this more than once or twice a year, I would recommend those trying this recipe read through reviews and add WAY more spices to the flour mix (as many here have suggested).  With these changes, it is a great recipe. However- it only gets 3 stars as written.

After reading the reviews, I decided to double the garlic powder and the paprika.  I also added 1/2tsp of onion powder...it was still not enough flavor in the breading, in my opinion.  Next time, I plan to add a few dashes of hot sauce to the egg/cream of chicken soup mixture, and add a tiny bit of cayenne pepper to the flour mixture.  And a touch more salt - I found myself wanting it to be more KFC style, and I definitely did not add anough salt for that.  The crispiness is great - I was pleasantly surprised!  :)  Good recipe.

This was the best fried chicken I have made to date. Used legs and thighs rather than breasts and added 1 can of buttermilk to the soup.  Couple of changes for next time. Legs take about 8 - 9 minutes to cook and thighs 11 - 12 minutes. Needs way more spice for the seasoning. I doubled the flour and corn starch. I put in 1 tablespoon of kosher salt, 2 tsp garlic powder and 1 tsp of cayenne pepper along with about 80 grind of fresh black pepper. Still could have used more spices and maybe salt and pepper the pieces after coming out of the oil.  Kept the oil at 350 - 375 degrees and kept warm in 200 degree oven on baking pan with cooling rack inserted.   Leftovers stored well in the fridge and just popped them in a 350 degree oven while the oven came to temperature to reheat. They were just as crispy as if I had made them that day!

This is good!  I added 1 tsp. of poultry seasoning and used tenderloins b/c it's what I had on hand.  I had a hard time getting the dough to stick, even after letting it rest.  But great flavor. HINT:  If you let your chicken "drain" on cooling racks onto paper towels, you will have crispier chicken than just patting dry, which will lead to soggy chicken.

THIS ONE IS GOING IN THE PERMANENT RECIPE BOX!  I THOUGHT GOOD FRIED CHICKEN CRUST MUST BE A SOUTHERN SECRET BUT THIS IS IT!  I THINK NEXT I WILL TRY THE BATTER ON DEEP FRIED ZUCCHINI OR GREEN TOMATOES WITH CREAM OF CELERY SOUP INSTEAD OF THE CHICKEN AS A VARIATION!!!

I never knew how much better just letting the chicken rest until doughy would make them once fried. Great chicken recipe!

I'm over 50 and have NEVER made fried chicken.  For some reason, I tried this recipe all by myself and LOVED it.  I have since tried it out of my friends from church (Baptists in Tennessee, and you know they are fried chicken experts) and my parents and sister.  They all raved about it.  It's crunchy on the outside and juicy on the inside.  It's PERFECT!  I even drop some of the coating without any chicken inside it just to get some crispies.  My guests kept going back to my the plate on which I was draining just to pick up the fried coating! Thank you so much for this recipe!

I really liked this chicken but I did make changes. I used sour milk instead of the soup (1c milk and 1tbp vinager), 1/2c flour, 1/2c corn starch, 1 egg, salt and pep to taste, 2tbp season salt, 1tbs poultry season, 1ts garlic, and 1tsp paprika, mix together and add chicken let stand 1 hr. in fridg.  I used 1 cup flour added salt and pep, then rolled the chicken in the flour before I fried it. Was super crispy and tasted great. Being from the south old habits die hard, crispy well seasoned fried chicken is a must for me. Thanks for the recipe I will make again.

Very crunchy outside.  I added a bit more spices to the flour mixture and added a pinch of cayenne pepper and onion powder.  Kids loved it.

I was originally going to give this 2 stars, because it most certainly is not better than my best fried chicken. This dish is very unlike fried chicken in fact, and I gave it three stars because in the end it is probably the best result for frying boneless skinless breasts in the hopes that it will turn out as fried chicken. Boneless skinless breast don't deep fry well because there is no skin to keep a breading on and they tend to dry out.The soup/cornstarch batter forms a thick crust on the chicken, which keeps the breast moist, but it is also heavier than fried chicken skin would be. I would never use this method for frying regular pieces of chicken (legs, thighs etc.) and would only suggest this recipe if you insist on deep frying boneless, skinless chicken. (Be sure to heavily season your cornstarch/flour mix).

I made this and it was good.  However I din't think the extra effort of the soup was worth it.  I have been trying to emulate my G. ma's recipe which is superior.  After frying, put all chicken in a baking dish filled with enough chicken stock to barely cover the bottom.  Cover with foil.  Bake at 275 degrees (higher if you want it done faster) for 1 1/2 hours.  It falls of the bone.  This was how my Grandmother-in-law sold it at the Rosauers Deli for 45 years!!!

My family and I love this recipe. Each time I mix it up a bit and its awesome every time. To make it crunchier, add crushed corn flakes. I end up using cream of mushroom soup most of the time and it tastes just as good as if you used cream of chicken. I use chicken strip tenders in place of breasts to cut down on cutting,cooking time and mess. I also use peanut oil and it gives it more taste than using vegetable oil. I also don't use a plastic bag for the coating. Instead I use a baking dish and roll it and spoon it over it. It keeps your flour mixture from getting too chunky and moist. Very good recipe, we enjoy it at least twice a month!!

I've had chicken prepared many different ways.  But when I tried this recipe, I was amazed at how crispy and juicy it came out.  Instead of chicken breasts though, I used cut up leg quarters and it was delicious.  The only real work was in skinning the chicken.  Great recipe!  I don't have to go to the corner restaurant anymore.

We followed the recipe exactly.. waited till it was doughy and cooked it for 7 minutes. Not crunchy at all, in fact hardly any of it stuck to the chicken. Im very disappointed

Awesome chicken - I found that I had to have my gas burner on full blast to get the temperature right but it was amazing! I pounded boneless skinless chicken breasts... super good.

this recipe was JUST OK!  THe crust was super thick and for me...maybe because i can already make great/seasoned fried chicken. The cream of chicken soup did nothing but made everything so much messier.  THe key to good chicken is...buttermilk, a generous amount of garlic POWDER, onion POWDER, paprika, Season salt,  salt and pepper, all purpose flour.  Taste a little of your flour (just a tiny bit on your finger) and season to your preference. Honestly, to get the perfect seasoned chicken, you have to practice making your special floured batter...(do measurements and write it down)...and one day...you will have the perfect batter recipe for you.

I used a whole chicken, cut up.  After 45 min., I had to start cooking the pieces even though they weren't completely "doughy".  Next time, I'll prepare at least 2 hrs. prior to frying.  Also, to get the right temp. on my stove, it was a little hotter than medium (dial at 6).  My first batch took almost 20 minutes to brown and were a little tough.  The second batch, fried at the right temp., were much better - crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside.  Does need a lot of extra "spicing up", but overall a good recipe.  It probably requires a few times to perfect.  (I also found it easier to blend the soup mixture in a large bowl, throw in all chicken to coat, and then allow the chicken to drain for a few minutes on a wire rack placed over a baking pan.)

This is a quite a spin on regular fried chicken.These chicken tenders where so flavourful and juicy.However i did let the cream of mushroom mixture and spices marinate for about 3 hours and i did splash a little red wine vinegar on it.I took the chicken out of the mushroom mixture add the flour and the potatoe flakes a little complete seasoning, a little red pepper and let it coated in marinated for 1 hr so it could stick to the chicken.And fryed them and the deep fryer and i cooked the fried french fries from this site.My kids and myself really enjoyed it.the chiicken was so moist and juicy and oh so flavorful this will go my top list.

Good chicken, but the recipe could use some help. The people haveing trouble with the batter falling off, TURN UP THE HEAT and get a thermometer! Chicken should be fried around 350-360 degrees. Spices such as Old Bay or seasoned salt added to the flour would be a plus also. All in all pretty good.

It's really good! My picky husband really enjoyed it, so much so that 15 mins afterwards he said so! I did make some little changes.  I used chili powder instead of the papricka and I used boneless, skinless tighs. They were nice an juicy.

Messy to make, the crust made turning the chicken difficult.  I found it a little on the bland side even after adding extra spices, but hubby has requested it as a 'do-over'.  What crust stayed on the chicken was good, similiar to fast-food.  I think a pre-coating of flour before the soup will help the batter stick better, plus some extra spices.

Very good recipe. I like that you don't have to use buttermilk because I never have that in the house. You definitely need to let this sit after you bread it....for a half hour or hour, the longer the better. Next time I may bread it in the afternoon, put it on wax paper and put it in the fridge until I'm ready to fry it for dinner. I added more spices too....some cayenne pepper gave it a little kick =).  Over all, very good, yes messy but so what! Thanks for the recipe! I forgot to add that I made it in chicken strips because I thought it would be faster. It was, but also even messier =)

I think this is  one of best recipes for fried chicken ive ever had. I do use whole chicken pieces, 100% peanut oil deep fried in a dutch oven over a burner out in the garage. No mess or lingering smell in the house, although I like that smell. The only thing I change is I shake a good amount of my secret fried chicken seasoning on it right after it comes out of the oil. I make this 3 or 4 times a year and is always a big hit.

I made this chicken for a house full of teenagers, They Loved it!! So crispy and Flavorful. I used boneless skinless chicken legs that was marinated. I omitted the salt in the wet mixture and used smoked paprika in the dry. I will be making this again and again Thank You for making my kids happy campers:)

I gave this 5 stars because I had no leftovers.  The coating was nice and crunchy, but like many other reviewers I added alot of spice to the flour mixture.  I don't know all the things I added, but I did add Tony's Cajun seasoning, lots of garlic powder (not salt), onion powder, poultry seasoning, Emril's, and a dash of chili powder.  I'm from the deep south and we love flavor.  It was really tasty!

Yummmm, This is the best fried chicken recipe that I have ever tried. The crust is perfect. I have found that it takes alittle more of the flour mixture than it calls,for almost double. I have made many times and everyone always raves.

I would like to say, that for as much trouble as this recipe called for, the chicken should have been absolutely wonderful, and it wasn’t.  It was very bland, and it cooked too quick, burning very easy.  I will not make this chicken again.  I followed the advice of others, and added more spices, and that didn't help, I couldn't taste the differnce.  Although, the second batch I cooked, tasted a little difference, because I added the seasoning to the chicken after I placed the flour on the chicken, and it was ready to fry.  I didn't taste any difference in this batter, and using plain flour.  It wasn't crunchy. I will not make this again.

My kids & I thought that this mixture was good, however my husband said it tasted "funny" (but then again, he really doesn't like cream of chicken soup, so he was on to that flavor).  It worked well with chicken tenders, the "batter" was crunchy & actually stayed on the chicken.  It was ALOT of messy clean-up.  Thanks Candy.

OMG, unbelievably great!  I tried fried chicken before but the batter never stuck.  This was so yummy!  I followed other reviewer's suggestions and used a dry rub (salt, pakrika, thyme, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder) to marinate the chicken overnight.  This is definitely a keeper!

The kids loved it (so if you're making for kids I'd give it 5 stars!) But I found it bland, even after following advice of super spicing. But I give it 4 because the crust texture was fabulous and the chicken (tenders and boneless thighs) was very juicy - just as promised.  I never was able to make fried chicken because I burned it or the batter fell off, but now I can!  Will use batter to coat veggies, etc.  I'll just have to play with the spices.  Oh, and I used cream of mushroom soup, onion powder, garlic powder, poultry seasoning, paprika, pepper and parsley.  I think the leftovers will be really good heated up to top a salad.

I don't know where the 10 minute cook time came from!  I fried the first batch for about 30 minutes and it was still pink in the center.  I'm baking the rest and will try to "flash fry" after they're cooked.  I'm agreeing with the rest of the group, too... needs way more seasoning.

My husband told me 3 or 4 times that he really enjoyed these - and he's a very picky eater.  My two year old also enjoyed them.  I added a little more seasoning to the flour/cornstarch - but these were very moist.  I will definately add this to our meal rotation.

Made this as written.  Outstanding! let my chicken soak for an hr. I cut the chicken breasts in thirds. FYI dont go by the color of the breading while frying, go by when the float add 1 minute the breading still crisps up more as they sit. also  I let them sit on a wire rack as in a photo above to keep the heat from making them soft while on paper towels.  you have to try these.

YUMMY! True to it's name, this stuff was good. The chicken almost got in the way of the coating. I could just eat fried up balls of cream of chicken soup (...I did too, only one!). I used chicken tenders instead of the breast. The only bad thing was after letting it dough up on a plate, the good stuff stuck...thats where the fried dough balls came from so I wasn't to heart broken. Thanks Candy, great recipe!

It was scrumptious even as I used chicken wings instead of boneless and I deep-fried them.My fussy hubby ate one wing at first and immediately told me to discard other coating flour.Even my little hero loves it (kinda of fussy like his dad).I love the crunchy coating especially.Only that the appearance after deep-frying was pale.I'll intend to add in a bit of tumeric powder for colour & flavour.Fresh garlic & some black/mixed crushed peppercorns are additionally great too.One of the best fried chicken wings I've ever had. Thanks alot, Candy..oh yeah, thanks to other helpful reviewers as well..

We loved this chicken!  It was worth the goo, breaded fingers and the wait (for the magical batter to appear).  I did add more seasonings to the flour/cornstarch mix.  I wish I knew KFC's 11 herbs and spices, but since I didn't, I added poultry seasoning,dill weed, beau monde, celery salt and tons of black pepper along with the garlic powder and paprika.  It took a good 45 mins. for the batter to appear.  I made double the flour mixture to be sure I had enough with the same seasonings and dreged the chicken in the bag instead of shaking. When I shook them the soup would fall off and clump up the flour. I used chicken tenders and deep fried them for about 5 mins.  Yummy dipped in your usual dipping sauces.  This would be a great dish to serve at a children's party.

I really enjoyed this recipe. The soup really added to the flavor. I added some bread crumbs to my flour mixure and it turned out crispy (which is a huge plus). The flavoring was a little bland so I would suggest adding more spices. I usely make sure that the flour mixture has a nice strong aroma. When Candy says that it is critical to let the breading get doughy before frying she means it!! So make sure you have enough time to let the chicken sit it took about 50 minutes to an hour for mine to reach optimal doughiness.  Next time I am going to make Cajun Fried Chicken! Yum! Thanks for the great recipe!

This is a great recipe for chicken strips! I used more seasoning in the flour/cornstarch mixture and cut the boneless chicken breasts into strips. They came out very crispy and my husband and kids loved them! I will be using this recipe for chicken strips from now on.

You know, it sounded so good.  The only way I modfied the recipe was to add more garlic powder, because we really love garlic over here.  Other than that,  I followed it to the letter.  "bland" doesn't even begin to describe how bad this tasted.  Definitely won't make it again.

My husband wanted fried chicken for dinner tonight.  The problem is I have never made fried chicken before.  I found this recipe and it was a hit!  The only change I made was using cream of mushroom soup since that was what I had on hand.  The level of seasoning was perfect for our tastes.  Definitely must let the coated chicken sit until the coating gets doughy before you fry it up, as the author suggests.  Will absolutely make this again and again!

Great Fried Chicken. I have been looking for a dependable recipe that provides great crispy crust, and has a great flavor. My search is over. I did not change a thing from the recipe although I did use chicken with the skin still on. This is my new standard for fried chicken.

This is the best fried chicken recipe and I've made several. However, I would suggest a couple things that make it better. Instead of putting the seasonings in the flower and corn meal mixture add them all to the soup batter. It makes the flavor better, cause they tend to get lost in dry mixture. Also, I was out of cream of chix soup so I used cream of mushroom. It was fabulous :)

This recipe is FANTASTIC! I am so picky about my chicken, I buy the boneless tenderloins then strip the tendon out and take any fat off.  I used 2 pounds of tenderloins instead of the breasts.  I instead of salt, pepper, paprika and garlic powder, I used garlic salt and cayenne pepper.  I also put a little cayenne pepper in the soup mixture.  My family likes a little kick in their chicken.  Anyway, this was my very first time making fried chicken.  When my boyfriend walked into the kitchen, he was very skeptical and turned his nose up at the way I was making it. He thought the soup idea was ridiculous.  Let me tell you, he could NOT stop eating it.  He said, and I agree that it is the most juicy fried chicken he has ever had. I have made it twice and this last time, I let the chicken sit in the soup mixture for a full day. With the rest of the chicken I was going to freeze for our next meal, I prepared the soup mix and poured it into the freezer bag with the chicken and froze it all together.  I also put all the dry ingredients together in a ziplock and stored in the pantry. When I go to make it again, all I have to do is thaw, batter and fry. Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!

WOW! This was delicious! The cream of chicken soup really helps with the flavor. Ok I did make a couple of adjustments as far as seasoning goes that make it even better than it already is. To your flour mixture add 1 packet of Good Seasons Italian dressing mix and 2 T tomato boullion...this will give you a very robust, flavorful chicken! I will definitely be making it like this from now on!

Tried the recipe yesterday and was delicious. This was my first time frying chicken. I took some other reviewers suggestions too which added to the flavor. I marinated the chicken fist in olive oil and garlic, salt n pepper for about an 1 1/2 hours. Also I used some buttermilk with the soup (1:1) because I was worried about it being too salty. I let the chicken sit in the mixture for a 1/2 an hour. I added a salt free herb blend liberally to the flour/corn starch mixture and some adobo. This really enhanced the flavors. I let the chicken rest for 1/2 an hour before frying. I used boneless thighs. The chicken was crispy, tender and juicy with a nice background of garlic from the marinade. The family loved it and all was eaten.  I gave it 4 stars since I never made fried chicken before and have no prior recipe to compare it to. Thanks for all the tips everyone.

I used golden mushroom soup and chicken legs (14).  I had to add to the flour mixture toward the end but beside that I used all the spices it called for but doubled them per the other reviews.  I kept it crispy while cooking other chicken by putting the cooked pieces directly on the oven rack in a 200 degree oven with a baking sheet under them on a lower rack for the oil drips.  Very good!  I would add more spices but it wasn't bad considering true southern cooking is usually on the blander side of the scale.

I used wheat flour instead of white and didn't use cornstarch but otherwise this was a delicious recipe! I added mine to a bed of lettuce with avocado and honey mustard but this would also be great as chicken tenders.

This is absolutely the BEST fried chicken I've ever had.  My kids love it and request it ALL the time!!!!  I found it much easier to put the soup mixture in a large ziplock bag as well as the flour mixture.  It made it much easier to handle and faster!!!

I marinated the chicken with minced garlic, olive oil, salt, and pepper for 5 hours. Then I double coated the chicken because my 3 year old daughter did the first time and I the second. After waiting 1 hour for the chicken to get "doughy" and frying and then finally eating it, it came out bland. Very disappointing and messy but my daughter had fun making it. My daughter liked it because she dipped it in ketchup too. This is the only reason why I rated it 4 stars and not 3 stars. I might have another go around with this recipe and add some saltine crackers just to up the ratings to a 5.

Let me first say I'm going to try this recipe again soon because I was not completely happy with the results. I followed the recipe *exactly* without reading the views.  I figured with the title and all those high star ratings it would be okay....not! My chicken breasts lost most of the bottom breading stuck to the plate *before* frying!  Also, my chicken did not cook in the time stated..they took longer and really needed to be pounded thinner to meet the required cooking time. I will say the chicken was moist, the remaining batter was crispy but not flavorful. I will add dried herbs, garlic and onion powder next time. I think this has potential to meet my *better than the best* with some minor adjustments. I may try use chicken tenders and/or chicken legs when I make this again.

I'm so sorry to have to rate this recipe so low; here is why: Medium heat was not hot enough; I increased my heat to Med-High and had better browning results. I found this recipe to be very bland. The recipe cautions to be careful with the salt – advice I unfortunately heeded; it needed salt. Southern fried chicken is SUPPOSED to be salty. It definitely needed Thyme.  Tarragon, Chervil, Chives, Parsley and maybe even a smidge of Sage would have enriched the flavor as well. I used wing pieces instead of breasts and found that the cook time suggested was not nearly long enough (I actually would have expected wing pieces to have taken less time than breasts).To its credit, it did produce a VERY nice crispy crust, and is absolutely deserving of a second go.

Everyone RAVED over this Chicken! I used bone-in thighs and fried it in an electric skillet at 300 degrees for about 40 minutes. Turned the pieces every 5-10 minutes. Oh... don't forget to BRINE your chicken overnight! It cooks quicker and is sooooo flavorful. Thanks for a terrific recipe!!!

This was very good, except after letting the chicken sit and and the coating to get gooey, its impossible to get it off the plate intact! I have tried using platic wrap, non-stick foil and oiling the plate but it still sticks! any suggestions?

I thought this was great.  This is the first time that I have ever tried to make homemade fried chicken. I did not think it was hard or overly messy.  I used chicken legs for my kids and used a deep fryer at 300*.  It of course took longer to cook but I expected that. I thought the flavor was great and the meat was very juicy.  I will definitely cook this again.

I really liked this recipe.  It gave boneless,skinless chicken breast flavor and that crunch without skin.  I did use more seasoning and I did rest it awhile in the fridge and then again after putting the flour/cornstarch coating on.  Next time I think I'll marinate in Buttermilk too.

This is the best fried chicken recipe that I have ever used and I been making fried chicken for years!!
I did add more seasonings (Mrs. Dash, Cavenders seasoning, and  "shakes" of plenty of others).  Thanks for a great recipe.

I always read the reviews before I try something new. I like getting the input, so I can make any adjustments I feel needed. After reading the reviews, I marinated the chicken in the soup mix for about 3hrs and I added every spice I could think of and the measurement of each spice was 1/2 tbs. I put salt,pepper,cajun,cayenne,italion,oregano,and garlic seasoning. I probably put a few others that I can't think of. I recommend adding as many spices and possible and a lot of each. Mine turned out great.

I brought this to a picnic the other day and all my friends loved it. I did read many of the reviews prior to making this so I did put extra seasoning in the coating (1/2 or 1 tsp of the following: Lawry's seasoned salt, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne pepper, Tony's creole seasoning, garlic and herb blend; plus 40 grinds of black pepper). I pretty much put seasonings in until the coating was fragrant enough for my taste. I also marinated the chicken overnight in the cream of chicken with garlic cloves, cayenne pepper, black pepper, the seasoned salt and onion powder added to it (I probably used 1/2 teaspoon of each of the dry spices). Once coated with the dry coating, I placed the chickens on my cookie rack with paper towels underneath for 45 minutes, turned them over and let sit for another 45 minutes before frying. I used boneless skinless chicken thighs and deep fried them in peanut oil for 8 minutes. Results were perfect! Chicken was juicy and flavorful and the coating had a great crunch on it.

Absolutely the best fried chicken...next to my dad's. He passed several years ago and I have been trying to find one for years. I spice it up with a light touch of cinnamon, seasoning salt, oregano and onion powder. The one thing you must do is eqaul amount of flour and cornstarch. This is one of my go to finds here.

I apologize in advance for the poor rating, as I know many ppl love this recipe.  I am a hopeless fried chicken snob and this recipe just didn't cut it.  It's incredibly messy and I wouldn't mind that if the results justified it, but they don't.  The soup did not to flavor the chicken and the spices are lame.  My quest for perfect fried chicken continues...

Good crispy batter. I'd be inclined to add more season for  fuller flavour... perhaps even some lemon zest!

Delicious chicken breast recipe!!!  I made this for my kids and they enjoyed every bite of it.  I added Cajun season in addition to seasoning salt and served it with macaroni salad and baked beans. After reading other reviews, next time I will use chicken thighs and drumstick.   Thanks Candy

Pretty good recipe I just made this tonight the breading tastes really good! I thought the meat needed to be marinated though. Really good recipe! I will make again.

Probably  won't make this again.  I waited until the chicken was doughy and then put it in the pan to fry and all of the crust fell off of it.  It never stuck to the chicken at all.  Was very disappointed.  I ended up serving "bald" fried chicken to family.

Very good chicken recipe!  It takes a bit of preparation, but it's worth it.  In the end, you get crispy, juicy chicken.  This one's a keeper.

This recipe really is better than the best fried chicken. It's my family's favorite fried chicken recipe! You can also use chicken legs for the kids.  Be sure to let the chicken get "doughy" as stated in the instructions. This makes a HUGE difference! You'll LOVE this recipe!

I'm giving this 5 stars because I have been looking for a fried chicken recipe with LOTS of crispy crunch to it and this recipe is IT! I've done the plain flour breading and while that can be really tasty it has never had the "skin" crunch to it like this. But in regards to taste I would have to give it a 3 though. Make sure that when you make your flour mixture to add lots of spices. Maybe double up or marinate the chicken the night before. Other than that this recipe is delicious.

this was my first time making fried chicken by myself...now that i'm married and on my own. this was easier than i thought and wasn't at all that messy. i did add a few things from what other reviews said to add more flavor. i added a packet of chicken flavor similar to a bouillon cube, lots of garlic salt w/ parsley, and a little bit of onion powder.  there was so much flavor it didn't need any dipping sauces. i would definitely make this again.

It was very good, and I will definitely make again. But I did add my own spices as well to make it a little better. I can't help it I always do. But to others trying this even if you don't add other spices you will need to add more salt (I use Lawry's seasoning salt) because it doesn't have enough even with the soup mixture. But I will definitely make again. Thanks

This is an excellent recipe, and now one of my family's favorites! They always ask for me to make it! The key is to let the chicken sit for about 45 min so the  flour mixture gets doughy. Thanks so much for submitting this recipe!

This chicken was wonderful! I made the following changes: I used legs instead of breasts, added a few spices to the soup, creole seasoning, paprika, garlic powder and let the chicken marinate most of the day. I coated the chicken as directed and fried on a medium heat turning the chicken every 8-10 minutes...Wonderful!

I ASKED MY HUSBAND HOW HE WOULD RATE THIS AND HE SAID 5 STARS. HE'S REALLY PICKY!  I SLICED THE CHICKEN BREAST INTO FINGERS, SPRINKLED THEM LIBERALLY WITH OLD BAY, AND ADDED A *LOT* OF CAYENNE, GARLIC POWDER,AND ONION POWDER (NOT SALT!) INTO THE FLOUR/CORN STRCH MIXTURE.  NO SALT NEEDED.  REALLY GOOD, THANKS.  WILL MAKE THIS AGAIN.

I did two things wrong. I did not spice it enough (too vague in the recipe) and I made the coating too thick on the meat. I suggest you read other recipes to get the right "spice" ratio and the thinner the layer of batter the yummier. Live and learn!

I used bone in chicken legs and cream of mushroom soup that I strained the mushrooms from because that is all I had.  I marinated the chicken in a zipper bag with the egg and soup mixture and had to put a ton of spices in it. Then I dumped the highly seasoned flour and cornstarch mixture on and let it sit until gummy.  There was way too much soup.  I fried 8 big legs with half a can of soup. We fried ours in a deep fryer.  My husband loved the tender texture and the smell, the crust was crunchy like tempura batter, but upon cooling,  got gummy again.  Kind of bland as the recipe goes, because I had to add a few teaspoons of seasoned salt and pepper and poultry seasoning, before it smelt good to me, but a good change from the regular fried chicken.

I would really try to thicken the siup mixture because it needs to hold the dry mix A LOT BETTER, it flakes right off in the fryer. Either that or use dry mix then cover in beaten egg and re-batter with dry mix. I probably wouldn't use this again, though. sorry! :(

Picky cook here and this was great....   I made chicken strips with this and none were left for me...BLAST!!!!  That makes it a hit here... I used a Bravetti Platinum Pro flash fryer with a basket..  One word of advice:  Drop the basket into the oil, then add the strips or pieces slowly... the first ones adhered to the basket bottom and were hard to remove a little bit.  Other than that, all thumbs up

This is one of the best recipes for fried chicken I have found. However, it is very messy to make it (the egg and cream of chicken soup mixture got all over the place). Also, it's hard to tell when it's ready to be fried-"doughy" is a vague description. Overall though, if you like fried chicken, try this!

I consider myself an above average cook, but crispy fried chicken with crust that didn't fall off during frying was my Achille's heel until this recipe.  I saw cream of chicken soup and cornstarch and thought this must be some kind of crazy messed up recipe. Then I read the reviews and no real mention of the soup or corn starch not working so I made this almost exactly as written except I used chicken legs and doubled the recipe to accommodate the amount I was making. Per other reviewers, I upped the amount of spice. I was so pleased with the outcome I nearly cried. After years of failure I can make good fried chicken! Hallelujah!

I don't think it lived up to its name. We tend to like more flavor then what this had. It did come out nice and crispy just needs more favor. I'll definitely try it again but will add more spices to see if we get 
better results.

I tried this recipe tonight with chicken tenders and loved it!  I upped the spices a bit as others suggested, and added some onion salt, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  The tenders needed to fry for about 6-7 minutes with oil at 375 degrees, and they were perfect.  I've never been able to get a crispy crust on chicken, and have it actually stay on the chicken.  This did the trick!

My sister and I made this and it was delicious, moist yet crispy. I didn't have corn starch, so replaced that with a cup of crushed croutons (Fresh Gourmet Caesar croutons). This added extra flavor and crunch. We also fried it in sunflower oil which made it all the more delicious. Next time, we are going to add a little cayenne or crushed red pepper for some extra kick.

I added a ton more spices and also put 1/2 Cup of franks red hot sauce in the wet stuff. It was awesome. Made it for my boyfriends birthday dinner, he LOVED it. We had a great time making the dinner together. clean up was easy too.

I thought this was great and reminded me of Chick fil A. I will make this one again for sure. It could use more spices though.

This is wonderful way to do chicken! I added 1/2 cup of Japanese bread crumbs and ghost pepper powder to give it the kick it rightfully deserved.

I followed the recipe, but omitted the garlic and added poultry seasoning in it's place. Still turned out really good.

The reviews are accurate, this is awesome! I made a double batch last night and the wife and kids LOVED IT! Like other reviews seasoning was an issue. I solved this issue by brining the chicken first for 4 hrs before letting it soak in the "marinade" for 2 hrs. Then dredged in the dry ingredients and let stand for another hour. It sounds like a lot of work be given that these steps are spaced out, it gives you time to prepare cole slaw... boil your potatoes, etc.. Great Recipe!

I hate to rate badly but this recipe did not work out for me. I am rating it 3 because the batter did taste good. I did everything the recipe said and I have made fried chicken before and have never had a problem. The second I placed the chicken in the oil ALL the batter fell off. I have no idea what went wrong. I let the chicken marinate with the ingredients for over an hour it looked ready to fry. The second it touched the oil it started to fall apart. I won't waste my time with this recipe I will stick to Chef John's buttermilk fried chicken it is definately a keeper.

Wow!  I do have to say this really is better than best fried chicken!  I was intrigued by this recipe using chicken soup base to coat the chicken.  It really does work well with the seasoned flour to give a nice crunchy and thick coating to the chicken when fried.  We went pretty much by the recipe and made it with the chicken breasts and made chicken strips.  Next time Im going to for sure use this with chicken pieces instead of strips.  I could tell this coating is the real deal to making good fried chicken!  My husband keeps asking to make this again.  :)  Thanks so much for this great recipe!  I will be making again and again!  UPDATE:  I can not tell you how many times my husband asks me to make this for him.  It is his favorite!  I do season the breading a bit more and doing the double dredge method always helps with the breading to stick even better before frying.  It is just always the perfect breading each time!  I thank you so much for sharing this awesome recipe!

This was definitely crunchy. I read other reviews saying the flavors were bland. I added more seasoning (my own mix, not seasoning salt) to the soup mixture and flour mix, plus I seasoned the chicken itself. I guess I was being too liberal with my seasoning, it really needed more. My kids love it as is and devoured it. If I were to make it again, I won't be afraid of MORE seasoning.

The family thought it was ok, but I didn't care for it at all. I followed the directions and didn't cook it until the coating had all soaked through. It mostly all came off in the oil and what did stick was really light and flavorless even though I added lots of extra spices in each step. Won't be making this again.

I wanted to double this recipe, since I was frying about 14 legs and wings.  However, I didn't have 2 cans of the cream of chicken soup. I used one can and doubled the eggs.  I had plenty of the liquid coating. My husband said it was the best fried chicken I've ever made.  It's a keeper!

This chicken turned out very good.  Frying with cornstarch is new to me, but makes the chicken super crispy, which is how fried chicken should be!  I agree with other reviewers that the breading is just not seasoned enough.  I thought that I really upped the seasoning, but even with a tablespoon of each paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, pepper, and a teaspoon of salt and chili powder it still tasted a bit too 'floury' for our taste.  Next time around I think I'll certainly season the chicken a bit and up the seasonings in the flour even more.  Overall a wonderful recipe, and my husband absolutely loved it!

This is not worth the work, the "coating" does not stay on as you place it in the fryer. You need to adjust this to include a wire rack or something that will not remove the coating.

Good fried chicken.  Could have used a bit more seasoning in the flour.  Important to let the chicken pieces sit and rest after you flour them so the flour appears closer to a batter.

this was a fabulous recipe. the flavor was amazing on the chicken, but it was so messy to prepare!!! i wound up skipping the bag part, i tried it with one piece and it was a mess so i wound up just transferring the pieces into a bowl of the flour mixture and that worked out a lot better. 

also, i used chicken thighs which were pretty thick i guess. i fried the chicken in a pan on the stove for about 15-20 minutes in total, flipping the pieces halfway through but when we sat down to eat they weren't cooked through! so i had to put them in the oven at 425 degrees for about 30 minutes. it was not a recipe issue, it was mine for having chicken thighs! ha ha. but overall great great recipe, and even better the second day i think!!

This is an AWESOME recipe...I agree with everyone else though that you must add a lot more spices, however the base recipe is great.  I used cream of mushroom soup instead of the cream of chicken and it turned out wonderful!  The chicken came out so crispy on the outside and moist and juicy on the inside...YUMMY!!  This would make the best chicken fingers also...I can't wait to make this again!

I agree with others about this being so bland in flavor.  And it was very messy.  I apparently was not experienced in frying chicken enough to know when it was done either.

I think it was great . My 9yr old was not told what the ingrd. were or she wouldn't eat it. So I dindn't tell her and she raved over it and said Mom never cook it any other way,Thank god NO more Mc Donalds nuggets. But I did add 1/4 can water to it the mix was a little to thick.  I put all together at 1 time and floured chk. before putting in the mix to marinate. I am 68 and been cooking chicken for years. Where was this when my other kids were at home? If in doubt don't be just try it oncw and you will be hooked.

Fried Chicken has never been my thing but this came out perfect! I would add more seasoning next time though. I prefer a little spicy kick.

Very good.  I followed the recipe exactly (I used 1 tsp salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper).  It certainly was crispy and the chicken inside was very moist and juicy.  The flavor of the batter was quite good (I used Lawry's), and I didn't have any problems with it sticking.   I can't say it was the best chicken I've ever had, but it was quite good and I would make it again.

After reading all the great reviews, I had been eagerly anticipating trying this recipe.  It was very disappointing.  The chicken turns out crispy (as long as you don't try to keep it warm, while making several batches.  Also, the coating stuck to the platter and not the chicken, which I remedied by reapplying the batter to the chicken prior to putting it into the pan.  And though I added a generous amount of spices, it was still disappointingly bland.  I had counted on this being "the onee," but I'll keep looking.

Well I think this recipe has potential but I did this recipe exactly how it reads and I thought that it didn't have that much flavor and way way to much corn starch. It made it to crispy and thick as soon as you bite the chicken all the coating falls off but it's very crispy. Next time I will cut the corn starch in half and add more spices to the flour mixture. I will make it again

Fantastic fried chicken!  I agree more spice would be better, but its also pretty good following the recipe.  Very juicy on the inside and crispy and flavorful on the outside.  I use this every time I make fried chicken.

Really good. I did add a little more seasoning to the cream of mushroom soup (1 TBLS minced garlic, pepper to taste,onion powder to taste and a little milk) put chicken in a bowl and leave in frig. for an hour or more covered. I also added a little more seasoning to the cornstarch and flour mix (flavor to your pref.) I also put the flour mix in a bowl and used a fork to coat the chicken with out making a mess. This came out really tender and juicy after frying it. Thanks will make again.

My first real attempt at fried chicken. I would say this was successful. The coating could of been a little spicier. However I read the other reviewers tips and added some extra prior to frying. I didn't have much time to wait before frying so I let it sit for half hour. It came out crunchy and fine.   I would recommend kicking up the seasoning. I might try a version where its dipped in buttermilk next to compare the 2 and see if I'll stick to this one in the future.

This turned out to be the best fried chicken I ever made!  Here are some suggestions for success...  1)  Take your time.  It doesn't have to be overly messy, but with the cream of chicken soup, it can be thick and goopy!  2)  I would recommend double coating as one reader said.  With the cream of chicken soup, the coverage can be a bit spotty - the mixture can slide off.  Double coating should help that.  3)  I love this recipe because you can fine tune your chicken however you like.  I'm a garli-holic.  I used a LOT of garlic power and salt and have to admit that the result was heavenly!  You can do a lot with pepper and other spices to make it just how you enjoy.  Like others, I did keep the oil at medium high.  If it comes out dry, a person is doing something wrong.  Don't over cook the chicken!  (I'd rather accidentally undercook and then bake a few minutes!)  Have fun.  I plan to use this recipe for potlucks.  It's that good.  :)

This was a nice change from my regular fried chicken coating. My only complaint is that the recipe as written is a little bland. I suggest to season the actual chicken and not the flour as the flavor doesn't permeate the coating to get to the chicken. Will make again but will only use this recipe for fried chicken breast sandwiches.

I have a finicky household and I was trying to find a new and delicious recipe for fried chicken...I found it!  Although I didn't use the garlic powder or paprika, I followed the recipe to a "T".  It was so good!  Even the next day, the cold chicken for lunch was still crispy!  I'll make this many times in the future.

Candy, marry me!!  ha!  just had dinner and this was fantastic!  ok, I changed it a bit as I was missing an important ingredient: chicken!! no, joking.  Went to the pantry and had cream of mushroom and cream of celery soup.  I have no idea how the cream of celery soup got there and I live alone.  So, I used the celery. While I make darn good fried chicken, this was better.

For those of you that burn their fried chicken, hint, oil is to hot.  There's this new invention, measures heat, try around 360 degrees.

anyway, this was GREAT.

I was not sure how this would turn out using cream of chicken soup in a fried chicken recipe. What a great surprise. I used my deep frier and cooked the chicken for about 9 minutes. As long as your frying oil is at the right temperature the coating should stay on. I stuck to the instructions and ingredients as written and was satisfied with the flavour. Some reviewers have mentioned how terribly messy the prep. was. I used tongs and a fork and didn't find this to be a problem ---but hey part of the fun in cooking is getting your fingers in the mix! I served this with a Caesar salad and asparagus. My family really enjoyed this chicken. I was scolded for not making enough for a late night snack. I'm sure I will make this again. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I was disappointed, I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of adding more spices as others had recommended. It wasn't the messiness of the reciipe that bothered me, it was the overall result, most of the batter fell off ( I did let it dry as the recipe indicated) and for my family it was just way too greasy and unhealthy, I think I will stick with baking/broiling chicken as this has heart attack written all over it. Also, I had to cook the chiken much longer than recipe stated.

This was a messy recipe.  That's why the 4 not 5.  But the coating, with a little tweeking, did taste good. I added old bay seasoning, more garlic powder, paprika, poultry seasoning, and season all.  I used the zip lock bag, but will try a plate or wax paper next time.  I didn't wait more then 5 min. after coating before I fried the chicken and if the oil is hot enouch the coating doesn't come off....at least with me it didn't.  I also took the left over bits of soup and flour mixture and made little dough pieces to fry.  The kids loved that!  Over all I will make this again I think.

This turned out great and was very easy to make.  I followed the recipe exactly as directed and used vegetable oil for frying.  I also used soup with 50% less fat.  Next time, I think I would add some more paprika, more garlic powder and maybe some onion powder to increase the flavour!  It tasted great with honey mustard for dipping!

This is hands-down, THE best recipe!!  I tweaked it by adding Season All salt, Lawrys garlic powder, paprika, pepper to the flour mixture and just a little to the soup.  It's messy but oh-so-worth-it!!!  I also used chicken breasts and thighs no bones and cooked in olive oil.  Thanks!  Will make again!

I made this exactly according to the recipe; it was wonderful!  My 6 year old is a very picky eater, but we both enjoyed this one!  It's a keeper!

Had to play a little with the ingredients to get it to have enough flavor. When that was succesful,it came out nice and juicy. I cooked mine in the the deep fryer for 7 mins. If your boneless chicken is thick,cut length  wise. I also let the chicken set for about 15 mins. after coating it. This seemed to make it alot crisper when deep fring it. Thanks for this recipe. My family really enjoyed it.

This was better than the fried chicken my momma used to make!!! I follwed directions exactly and most importantly let the batter get doughy on the chicken-my husband raved about the chicken to all his friends and now everyone wants to come over for fried chicken. Excellent-best fried chicken EVER!!

This recipe was fantastic.  My sister found it first and told me how much her family liked it, so I had to try it.  Everyone in my family wanted more.  I fried the chicken in a fry daddy which made this recipe a cinch.

This is wonderful. It was very easy to make, and yes you do have to wait a while for the coating to turn 'doughy' but it's worth it. I just cleaned up the mess in the mean time. I think for people who didn't do well with the recipe just didn't follow the directions correctly. I give five stars!

This turned out wonderfully!  I put the flour mixture in a bowl and the soup in a bowl and dredged the chicken in each.  It only took about 7 minutes for the chicken to become "doughy."  It was crispy and delicious!

This chicken is really, really good.  Mine took about 40 min to get doughy.  The dough stuck to the chicken and it was crispy.  Next time I may add a few more spices to the flour mix.  I did not find this recipe any more messy than other fried chicken recipes either.  Definately a keeper!!

Easy recipe, tasted excellant. Very moist chicken.  I only changed the flour mixture, didn't seem like enough to coat the chicken.  I used 1 cup of flour and 1 cup of starch, 2 teaspoons of each, paprika, sea salt, garlic powder, and onion powder.  I did not salt the soup mixture.  Cooked in Fry Daddy instead of skillet.  Was delicious!

this is really good.  I "double dipped" the chicken repeating the chicken soup and flour/cornstarch step and found that the breading stayed on much better.  A little labor intensive but the best fried chicken recipe I have found!

This recipe has great 'Bones'.  I was a bit disappointed, it was dry and the batter was rather bland.  However I think that these are both easily remedied.  I probably cooked mine too long (all 10 minutes suggested), and I'm sure I can add additional seasoning to give it more 'umph'.  I do have to give kudos as this is the first fried chicken recipe I've tried that the batter actually stuck to that chicken during and after frying.  We'll give it another try and see how it goes.

This was a really good recipe! It was a little messy to make, but what the heck - that's what soap and water are for, right?  I'm not a big "garlic" lover so I may leave out the garlic powder next time. The cream of chicken soup gave it a very different, but delicious taste. Thanks, Candy!

We really enjoyed this recipe.I have had trouble making fried chicken, so decided to give this a try. I will try pounding the chicken thin next time. Would also like to make with chicken strips.After coating with flour mixture, I let sit at least 20 minutes, and this made it stick wonderfully. I made in deep fryer and came out good, will make again for sure. Thanks!

This is great!  Comes out very crispy.  Just be sure to put lots of spices in the soup mixture and the flour that the soup coated chicken is rolled through.  I even put a bit of hot sauce in the soup mixture.  If you are going for buffalo chicken I'd suggest making the hot sauce seperate and just use it for dipping.  If the crispy chicken is toss in hot sauce the crust absorbs the hot suace and turns to mush.

This was okay. As many reviewers mentioned, this chicken did not have a lot of spice to it. I added additional pepper, as well as lemon pepper, and it was still a little on the bland side. I liked the crispy outside (although a lot of the coating fell off, but I think that was my fault since I stacked some of the chicken breasts before they were fried). I might make this again.

I didn't have any cornstarch, and it still turned out great. I also put in a little tempura mix, cornflake crumbs along with the other dry ingrediants. When done I sprinkle a dab of garlic salt on the chicken. This is a great recipe - my normally-chicken-hating boyfriend begs for it all the time!

I just made this recipe. I found it extremely easy to prepare. I cook daily for my 90 year old Grandmother who NEVER eats chicken skin. She absolutly devoured the chicken skin and all.  I told her to stop eating as she was sucking on bones. She loved it. She thought it was the best chicken she had ever had. She told me to make it again and again and never to make fried chicken any other way. I found the crispness wonderful, however next time I will spice it up a lot more. Thanks Candy!

This is really good chicken. I've made it twice, the second time I had no cream of chicken so I used the cheese soup as in another review.  It was still awesome.  Had to season it up a bit to our liking, but I will never cook fried chicken another way again.

This was messy and although not that bad tasting, it was not the best I've tasted.  For all the messiness and clean-up, it's definitely not worth it.  I've had frozen chicken fried up in my fry machine that's tastier than this.

All my life I have tried to fix fried chicken that was really good, crispy and the coating stuck - this recipe met all 3!  It really is better than the best - very flavorful, extra crispy coating and very tender - my whole family loved it - better than any we have eaten out (including fast food chicken).  The people who thought it was bland or not flavorful - must not like old fashioned home cooked fried chicken. The only thing I did differant is I defrosted the skinless chicken breasts in salt water.  I deep fried the pieces for about 15 to 20 minutes.  Thank you for giving me a truly GREAT recipe.

This recipe was great.  My very picky children loved it.  I used cream of celery soup because it was on hand and I did not put in any additional salt.  I took another reviewers advice and flattened the chicken first.  I especially love the fact that this is quick and easy.

I didn't think this recipe was a flavorful as promised.  In fact, I thought it was pretty bland.  I don't think it'll be a repeat in our house.

Everytime I've tried to fry chicken, the batter comes off.  However, not this one!
It was so simple to do, and the batter stayed in tact and had a great flavor.  My
13 year old didn't even have to put ketchup on his, he said "This is delicious!"
Will definately serve this to company.

The family enjoyed this recipe. I used "Slap yo Mama" seasoning directly on the chicken and in the flour/cornstarch mixture. Simply awesome!!!

I loved that this recipe had ingredients easy to get, was simple to follow, and was very specific on what to one had to look out for.  As a person who is usually clueless in the kitchen, I made lunch which looked good, smelled good, and tasted good.  I also read the other reviews before starting, and doubled the garlic salt.  Not one of the kids asked for ketchup or gravy.

The coating that stayed on the chicken had excellent texture, though as other reviewers have noted, it was a bit on the bland side.  Tossing the soup-coated chicken in a bag with the flour worked remarkably poorly - much more soup stayed in the bag than stayed on the chicken.  The next time I try this recipe, I'll just mix all of the coating ingredients together and use this as a batter-fried recipe.  If that doesn't work well, simply dredging the soup-coated chicken in a bowl of the flour/cornstarch mixture should work better than the bag-toss technique.

I tried this recipe for the first time tonight.  I have tried unsuccessfully in the past to make a good, tasty and crispy fried chicken.  This recipe is amazing!  I followed the recipe like it was written; the only thing I changed due to some suggestions was I put the spices diretly in the soup marinade.  I also added more spice than was suggested.  I deep fried the chicken until golden brown and then put it in the oven for a few minutes just to finish it off.  I paired it with ranch dressing as a dip.  My husband and I both loved it and I will definitely be making this again.  Thank you Candy!

This was really messy but fried chicken always is however you make it. It came out really tasty and crispy,and the batter stayed on good. I made it with a family pack of drumsticks in my kettle cooker (deep fryer). I will double the spices in the dry mix next time,but it's a great recipe!

I thought the chicken was fairly delicious.  It had a nice crunchy crust and seasoned just right.  I also seasoned my chicken with a little pepper and garlic powder, leaving out the salt since the soup will be salty enough.

Yummy! As usual, I don't know the best way to let the chicken sit before frying without ripping the batter off when I pick them up. I compensated by doing a quick dab in the flour again before putting them in. Will definitely make again!

Made this last night for my 6 and 4 year old's and they loved it!!! My husband came home after work and ate some and he RARELY likes anything I make and he LOVED this chicken! The batter turned out super crunchy.  However the only thing I did differently was add much more garlic powder, paprika, pepper and salt.  I also used half a can of cream of chicken and half a can of cream of celery. ALSO let the chicken soak in the soap egg mixture for at least 30 minutes!!! Totally making this again!

Excellent! I added more spices to give it kick. I added chili flakes, chili powder and more paprika. Also let breaded chicken rest 1.5hrs for crispiness.  So easy!!

Excellent recipe. The whole family loved it. My in laws have even asked for the recipe. Its not the quickest/cleanest thing to make but its well worth the work. Have made this many times. The only reason it didn't get four stars is because I didn't think it had enough seasonings.

This is just the best way to make fried chicken! Actually, it is the ONLY way. The only think I changed was added more spices. My husband likes things spicy, so also added cayenne pepper! The chicken always comes out so crispy on the outside and moist on the inside! Fabulous recipe!!!!

This is a good recipe.  I was surprised by messy it was but since I read the reviews I know how to work it.  It did not have as much flavor as I thought it would using the soup, I will add more spices to the dry mix next time (yes there will be a next time!).  Another comment:  it does not take 15 min prep time and will not be ready to eat in 45 min.  If you let the chicken sit til it's doughy it will take at least an hour for that to happen.  Also, I pan fried it and feel it would be better if deep fried.  May sound like I don't like it but I really do.  As the Englishman said "Well Done Candy!"

excellent---don't even miss the bones from traditional fried chicken! the exterior is nice and crispy...they're even good cold! definitely do in a deep fryer if you have one.

Very easy to make and really crunchy and delicious! I used cream of brocoli soup, and worked perfectly as well. Thanks so much, the kids and I loved these a lot. Yummm!

Excellent recipe, and helpful reviews.  Added more salt and paprika.  Do sit for a least an hour. To make it extra crispy I added crushed Frosted Flakes cereal to the batter which made it a thousand times yummier for my teens and hubby.  This is now a family favorite and will be used for many many dinners.  Deeeliiissh!!

Best fried chicken I've made! Meat was very tender and juicy and very tasty. My husband agrees that it was great. I used Cream of Mushroom instead, as that was what I had available.

Made as directed using lard instead of oil and cooked it in cast iron.  Fab.  My family scarfed it down in no time (next time, I'll make more).

This was really good and a nice change for skinless chicken breasts.  I used 2 chicken breasts that I cut into tenders and marinated it for about an hour in the egg and soup mix.  BTW, I used a can of cream of mushroom soup because that was all I had on hand.  To the flour/cornstarch mix I added lots of seasonings to punch it up including chipotle chili powder and Adobo, but I also added cornmeal for extra crunch.  After breading, I let them sit for about 1 hour.  I then fried them in 3 batches in my wok and for some strange reason, the last batch came out light and looked the best.  The first two batches looked like the picture for this recipe and the last looked like regular fried chicken.  I can't explain that because the oil was hot enough prior to frying.  Regardless, it was a hit because it was moist on the inside and crunchy on the outside.

This came out very crispy, but a little bland. I also brined my chicken before putting in the soup mixture, and it was very tasty and juicy.

This actually came out better than I thought it would. I wasn't sure about the soup but wound up merinating my chicken in it over nite (it was late and I realized to late that I didn't have corn starch). The chicken really took on the flavor from the soup and was very tender and juicy. As far as the flour mix, I added more seasoning to my liking and added cayenne pepper and onion salt. This was pretty tastey, I think I'll keep it.

This was amazing! I used chicken tenders & before frying them they looked pretty bad. The breading didnt look like it was staying on, BUT, I fried them up & they were fantastic. Super crispy on the outside & nice & juicy on the inside. Awesome!

Absolutely the best fried chicken recipe I have found. This is the only recipe I will use from here on out. Letting the chicken get doughy is a must. It just turns out perfect. Great recipe!

I LOVE how deliciously crispy the chicken comes out! I used chicken tenders. To the flour/corn starch mixed I added 1.5 tsp of adobo (I imagine you can use poultry seasoning), 1.5 tsp of paprika, 1/2 tsp pepper and 1 tsp of salt. Flavor wise it was perfect for us! I'll never make fried chicken any other way.

I made this for dinner and it came out so nice...crispy and tender/juicy inside.  I didnt have cream of chicken handy but I made a substitute by melting 1tbsp of butter and adding 3tbsp of flour until smooth then added 1/2c.chicken broth and 1/2 skim milk and mix together( low heat), salt pepper to taste.  I then added the egg...perfect ;-).  It took almost 45 mins to get doughy and it fried perfectly.  This one is a keeper.  I also added lots of spices to the flour. Thanks

Amazing recipe! I added a little bit of hot wing sauce to the soup part, and added my own spices to the flour. But do watch the salt, my mother-in-law found it very salty, so I wont be adding my own salt again. Used chicken tenders and my trusty deep fryer, and it turned out exactly as I expected!!!

This is fantastic!  I just added a bit more of all of the spices and it tasted terrific!  I cooked thick, boneless, skinless chicken breasts for 10 minutes and they came out crispy and perfectly cooked.  This is one of our new favorites!

I made this last night for dinner. Of course I read through the reviews and added a lot of spices to the flour mixture. This definitely helped with the flavor as my chicken was not bland at all. My only problem was the breading fell off most of the pieces.. I cooked it at 350 degrees in my deep fryer. Other than the breading falling off, it was really good. Will definitely make again, but will let it sit out longer to get more "doughy" maybe that'll help?

I added ALOT of extra seasoning...garlic, season salt, oregano and some secret stuff. My family loved the taste. This chicken wasn't TOO messy, the overall outcome was well worth it, although the wet mix never did become "doughy". I pan fried the breasts and added more dry mix to the top while the bottom was cooking. Then I took a large spoon to scoop oil onto the top of the chicken. This ended up creating a crisp that you would get from KFC. Very good recipe, will definetly do this again.  *****not too often, since fried food is NOT the best for my husband or growing kids!****

I always thought my mother made the best fried chicken, but I have now trumped hers.  I made this for my family and they loved it.  My husband said it's the best fried chicken he has ever had. I seasoned my flour mixture instead of the soup and used more seasoning than suggested.

I am only giving this 3 stars, because as usual, I burn not fry. I don't know why but I can not fry chicken for anything, it burns every time. Even burnt this had a good flavor. So since I can't fry fried chicken, next time I am going to try baking in the oven. I will do every thing the same then bake it. I am not sure if any one has tried that. To many reviews to read through.

I didn't have enough oil to coat the entire chicken so I fried one side and then flipped and fried the other side. It came out really crispy. It will be a recipe I will use again.

I have never even attempted fried chicken but gave it a try last night with this recipe... Yeah, super messy to make but WOW! It was just wonderful! I cut the chicken breast up into smaller pieces and they were crispy, juicy, and super flavorful. My boyfriend said to rate it a 10!

My family LOVED this fried chicken.  I wasn't sure about it.  I'd never heard of frying chicken using soup, but it was awesome!!

This recipe was just ok. I was somewhat disappointed after reading the reviews. I tried adding more seasonings, but it was still bland. The taste was not worth the messy glue.

Great recipe! I used a deep frier and it made perfect chicken...the dough stayed on and was nice and crispy.

This is the only way I make chicken tenders or nuggets.  This is a very simpl recipe and very tasty as well.  You can add your own spices as it fits the theme of the meal.

It's a toss up between a 3 and a 4 star.  It is messy - I ended up brushing the soup on with a basting brush.  Make sure your oil is hot enough, this helps with keeping the coating on the chicken. DEFINATELY needs more spice in the coating mixture; pretty bland as written, though the crispiness is certainly A+.  I'll try this again but am thinking of ways to infuse flavor into the soup mixture. Some hot sauce?

Very yummy! The cream of chicken soup is a great idea. I let it sit for about 20 minutes before frying..I didn't exactly notice it being 'doughy' but the coating did stay on and was nice and crunchy. Thanks!

It was so messy my kids were teasing me, but hey it cleans up!  I told them if they didn't quit laughing at me I'd make them clean it up =)
This chicken came out awesome!  It made the mess and the clean up worth it!

WOW!! This chicken is AWESOME!!  Thank you so much for the recipe my boyfriend and I enjoyed it very much.  I followed the recipe to a "t" I only used a deep fryer instead of the skillet to fry the chicken.  Again, thank you!  This one will be saved in the recipe book!! :)

Flavor was OK.  Needed more time to cook. Breading fell off chicken easily. Will make changes to the recipe if I make again.

SPECTACULAR! This is the best breading I have ever used for frying. Even though the recipe doesn't call for many spices or seasonings, it's fun to play around and make your own.

Was not too fond of this. Maybe should use a moister piece of chicken or something. We used breast tenderloins.

When I tried this recipe the first time, I felt it only deserved 3 stars but with a few modifications it deserves at least 4 stars.  The coating was crunchy, but the flavor was too bland for my family's taste.   Taking the advice of several reviewers, I added extra seasoning to the basic flour mixture.  I also marinated the chicken with shoyu, garlic powder, a pinch of ground ginger and pepper before coating it with the chicken soup and egg mixture.  I don't recommend the plastic bag method (WAY TOO MESSY).  Another piece of advice that I took from another reader was to use a plate to coat the chicken in the flour mixture.  (still messy, but not as bad as inside the plastic bag)  Have decided this recipe is now a keeper, thanks Cindy.

I made this last night for dinner. INCREDIBLE!! Moist and juicy inside, flavorful and VERY crunchy outside. My husband loved it. It has definitely become a favorite in our house after it's first appearance on our table. We gave it six stars!

This was very dissapointing.  The coating was very messy.  I ended up putting the flour mixture on a plate instead of slopping the soup mixture down the inside of the bag.  The coating came off in the pan and I had to take it out of the grease and put it into a grill pan to finish up so it had some color and the inside was cooked.

I have tried several fried chicken recipes and this is the first one that has actually had a crispy coating when I oven fried it.  I did not add any salt (trying to cut back), just let the salt in the soup do all the work.  It was wonderful, even my two picky sons loved it.  This ones a keeper! Thanks!

Wow.... I have tried to fry chicken for years and it was always ... yucky. This is the first time I fried chicken and my husband didn't give me "please don't try to fry chicken" look. He loved this recipe so much he even called his mother to tell her this was the best fried chicken he had. Thanks Candy.  I did add a little Lawry's seasoning to the soup mix and the flour and I used wing dings but besides that I followed the recipe.

The kids' absolutely loved this recipe.  I cut up the chicken in strips (fingers & popcorn size)and added 1t Old Bay Seasoning; 1t black pepper to the flour mixture.  The kids' dipped the 'fingers' in their favorite Kraft Sweet & Sour Sauce.  After this dinner, I guess I'm going to have to invest in a deep fryer.

We weren't too crazy about this recipe.  Instead of being crispy chicken, it was hard and almost too crunchy.  I thought it was a fluke, so I tried it a second time with the same results?? Sorry, Tayben

This was good and I will probably make it again. It is very important to wait until the coating gets doughy before frying.

This recipe was great.  I only had cream of mushroom soup so I used that and it turned out great.  Thanks!

I thought this recipe was very easy to make. I did have trouble keeping the coating on. I added lots of LaMar's Famous Seasoning (available at 800 941-2889)to both the soup and the flour mixture which really added to the overall flavor. Without the seasoning I think it would have been very bland. I also added fresh minced garlic to the soup. Overall my family thought it was pretty good.

This did have a very tasty coating, but like others have said before me, the chicken could have used some more seasoning.  Overall, I can't say this tasted any better than chicken coated with only flour before cooking--ie, I think the think the egg and cream of chicken soup mixture is a bit much to do every time I make fried chicken.

Tasty, but not the best. Incredibly messy to make, that's for sure. I'd make it again, but it won't be my mainstay for a fried chicken recipe.

This was definately made the chicken nice and crunchy. I use chicken tenders then tossed them in hot sauce and they were just like some restaurants boneless buffalo chicken wings. It was so delicious.

This recipe turned out very good.  I didn't have any chicken soup so I used Cheddar, but it didn't give it a cheesy taste.  I think any cream soup could be used.  However, it was too much trouble for me.  I guess I'm just lazy.  I'll stick to my easier recipe.

This was "okay", nothing fantastic and I probably would not make it again because the end result (flavor and texture) just does not justify the mess of making the dish.  I was EXPECTING a KFC type crust and was sorely disappointed when the chicken turned out no different had I simply dipped the chicken in water, then in a simple flour/salt/pepper coating.  Like a few others who have left reviews here, my kids seemed to like it (they ate it) but my husband and I found it quite bland and unappealing.... I even added some onion power to the coating mix...

Very easy and quick to make. There is room for creativitivity to add your favorite spice
to increase the flavour. Due to its bland taste I can see why picky kids would like this recipe.
Marinating the chicken in lemon, soy sauce and garlic before the whole cooking process increases the flavour 
dramatically. Let's just say I'd use this recipe again.

This chicken was delicious and had a great crust.  My husband and kids loved it!  One note - after soaking the chicken in the soup mix, I realized I probably could have used 1/2 a can of soup since I just threw the rest away.  Also, I recommend pounding the chicken breasts thin- I had a little trouble getting them to cook through since mine were a bit too thick.  Definitely will make this recipe again! A+

I seasoned my chicken with a little olive oil and salt, pepper and garlic and McCormick Montreal Chicken Seasoning before dredging in soup and flour. The chicken was very moist on the inside. I like the outside too but probably should have let it get a little crispier. I loved the way it tasted and it reheated the next day wonderfully.

I love this recipe and so does my family! I have used it for chicken and pork chops, by switching from cream of chicken to cream of mushroom soup. I also added an equal portion of crushed pretzels, for extra crunch.

This was great!  As is, my picky husband thought it was great.  I was really intimidated to make fried chicken - having never made it before - but was myself pleased with the turn out.  I did buy a special oil thermometer to make sure I had the oil at the right temp and I think that was helpful.  My one critique is that it was almost kind of bland.  I am making it again this weekend and will use more seasoning.  I will probably also be using up my cream of chicken with herbs, so maybe that will add a new flavor.

My third attempt ever at making fried chicken and it was a success, finally! This was such a simple recipe and turned out great. The only change I made was that I used gluten free flour because 3 of the 6 of us in my family cannot eat wheat/gluten. Only thing I may change is to add more salt and seasonings next time. Will definitely make this again- it was so moist inside and golden on the outside and only took 7 minutes to fry. The family loved it. Thank you for a great recipe!

These were great.   Made strips but added crushed generic corn flakes.    It was a hit with my teenage son and his friend.   Will make these again.

This was excellent! I didn't have any cornstarch so I threw in some Wondra and some season salt, basil, garlic salt and powder, cayenne pepper and some other stuff I forgot now. lol  I let it let sit for about an hour and put in the deep fryer for 10-13 minutes. seriously the best fried chicken I have ever made. thank you!!!  :)

Having made this recipe twice, this is the go to recipe my husband ask for.  We have enjoyed it both times.  The only change I made was by accident, not having enough time to finish the cooking at one time.   I began with using  chicken breast cut into strips.  Placed the strips in the soug/egg mixture and placed in the refrigerator until I had more time to work with it.  They turned out great, really  moist and loved the batter.  Great recipe.

Excellent recipe.  I actually mixed all the ingredients (wet and dry) together to make a batter and let it sit for a few minutes to get thick.  I rolled the drumsticks around in the batter and then dusted them with panko crumbs.  Best fried chicken I have ever had.

Delicious! The chicken was moist and crispy. Following the advice of other reviews, I added extra seasoning, garlic and onion powder, salt,  pepper, season salt and poultry seasoning, and yet it still could have used a little more seasoning. I also used buttermilk with the egg and soup mixture. I also added the above spices in both the wet and dry mixture. My advice is to use a heavy hand when seasoning your chicken. This recipe will definitely go into the family rotation.

I got the family sized can of soup and added two eggs. Doubled the flour/cornstartch/etc mixture to make sure I had enough. This was amazing! I have tried a few other fried chicken recipes and they never turned out. This was delicious!

I loved it! I've tried many other fried chicken recipes & this one is my FAVORITE! My family seems to agree with me too. I doubled the recipe & used it on chicken legs & it was DELICIOUS! Just the right amount of seasoning & so flavorful. Definitely worth a try, you'll LOVE it too & so easy to make, enjoy! :-)

While quite a messy recipe (lots to clean up after, especially when the flour and cornstarch decide to wander) it is well worth the effort. This was my first foray into fried chicken (usually my dad does it) and this turned out WONDERFULLY! Nice crisp breading and moist, tender chicken. I did do one small change, I had 4 breasts so I sliced them into three strips each to make "tenders". The listed amount of coating and breading worked out perfectly for the twelve tenders!

Best fried chicken I ever made!!! My family loves it so much that we stop buying fried chicken from Churches.  It's simple, crunchy on the outside, tender in the inside and fast. I cook mine in a deep fryer. Great recipe, thanks!!

Amazing on chicken legs and thighs. Crispy and delicious. But I find the batter didn't stick well when using skinless chicken breasts.

Delicious. Made it with chicken breast and did not use shortening but just regular oil and butter. Used garlic powder instead of garlic and put some in the gravy.

I made this recipe and doubled the seasonings measurements due to all the comments that it was bland.  I also added adobo seasoning.  Before I coated the chicken with the egg and soup mixture, I lightly coated the chicken with flour so the coating would stick better and then placed the chicken in the bag with the seasonings and flour mixture.  Everyone loved it and I will definitely make it again

I have to say I was skeptical of this recipe, and it was a bit messy and there was a learning curve, but we loved the chicken! Like many I added a lot more spices to my mix, we like a spicy fried chicken with lots of flavor, and I partially boiled my chicken in heavily salted water (your chicken gets done all the way and the meat gets seasoned as well!). Other than that made it exactly as directed! It was super crunchy and absolutely picture perfect.

Wow! This chicken was better than the best. Crispy outside and still nice and juicy inside. Awesome!  
 I used 20 chicken tenders. One can of the Cream of Chicken Soup worked well. I do not add salt to anything. I did have one change. I used Mrs. Dash Garlic and Herb along with all the other spices. This made 3 batches of yummy goodness. The last batch I sprinkled a dusting of cayenne pepper over prior to frying. Every batch was delicious. The photo I added really shows the crispiness.  I will experiment with different soups and maybe even Ranch dressing next time.

This was really good!  I soaked the chicken overnight because I didn't read the recip until right before I wanted to cook it.  So I did all the prep work the night before and cooked it the next night.  I just used two breasts because that's what I had.  I still had enough leftovers for later after two people ate.  My husband doesn't care for garlic, but didn't notice the garlic in this.

I think this was one of my best attempts at fried chicken. I used about 2T 'Better than Bullion', in place of the cream of chicken soup, along with some milk, and increased the amount of the spices. I double dipped/battered the chicken tenders and fried until they were a deep, golden brown. I also made sure to keep my oil hot and to space out my batches, so the oil didn't cool too much. It was very crunchy and delicious this way.

Great recipe easy to follow. I added some Louisiana Seasoning to it for a little kick, but it was flavorful as is

This is a GREAT recipe. It is NOT over the top, very good flavor, in fact it could probably use more flavor if anything, but it is good the way it is.  Stronger on the seasoning salt.  I used the Cream of Chicken Soup but am anxious to try Cream of Mushroom and some garlic.

Mmmmmmm good!   Turned out perfect. I don't like a lot of salt so I omitted the salt and just used season all for the paprika and garlic. It was crispy and so easy to do. Thank you

Yes, I read the reviews before making this, and YES, I knew that most people found this chicken to be bland.  Well, I obviously STILL didn't use enough spices because this chicken was incredibly boring.  It's true, the chicken came out moist and the skin was nice and crispy.  But we literally had to shake salt on it before EVERY bite.  It concerns me that fried chicken requires SO MUCH salt in order to be palatable.  I guess I will stick with broiled chicken.  I should note that I used chicken that did not have any salt added before packaging. Maybe the people that "love" this recipe are using the kind that has had salt added?

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out horrible. The batter didn't stick to the chicken and instead all came off in the pan! I read other reviews that had this problem but most reviews rave about it being so perfect. I want to know what I did wrong! I was looking forward to this recipe and after following it exactly it did not turn out how I had hoped.

How do you keep the batter from sticking to the plate or sliding off, whats left of it, when cooked.  I tried this and my chicken looked like a balding man.

I was very disappointed with this recipe. I refrigerated the chicken soup mixture with boneless chicken pieces an hour or two before frying. Not sure if this was the problem, but the batter did not stick when I fried it. I tried dredging the chicken a second time in the flour mixture but it didnt help. I am not sure if it was a problem that the chicken was skinless. My son in law has lots of experience cooking and suggested I dredge the chicken in flour before I dip it in the soup mixture. Not sure I will try this again. I think I'm hipper with over frying.

You have to try this method -- don't get impatient with the batter setting time -- but definitely spice the chicken and batter until it smells right to you. So much better than drive-thru!

This is a bit messy to make, but oh, so worth it!  We live in a land with no fried chicken (and I'm a Southern girl!), so this was a fabulous alternative.  Will definitely be keeping this one!  YUMMY!

5 stars by far.  I bought a pack of party wings and used this recipe to make fried chicken wings.  They were excellent!  Quite possibly the best friend chicken wings I ever had.  I encourage anyone to try making chicken wings with this recipe.  The only thing I changed was I didn't add any salt.  other than that, great recipe.  I will definitely make again.

This wasn't too bad. Like others said, not alot of flavor, so I'll make again and play around with it. I didn't find it to be too messy either. I used tongs and my fryer to cook them up. They were very crunchy!

I've made several fried chicken recipes before, but I like this one the best. It is really messy, but well worth it. I added some chili powder for a little "kick"

These were very flavorful I will say that but VERY dry. I cut the breasts into strips and I think maybe they should have been pounded a little thinner. I would maybe try this again because the cream soup did lend alot of flavor. I even soaked them in wet mixture for 2 hours and let them sit in dry for 1 hour. I used alot more seasoning as well.

I did what one of the reviewers said, marinate the chicken in chopped garlic, salt, pepper and olive oil. Then I followed the exact recipe, except that I used cream of mushroom soup, and chickens cut into quarter pieces. I used a wok to fry the chickens, and I set the temperature to more than medium high, and cooked each side for about 15 minutes. Then, I served the chicken with corn,red pepper and simple fried brown rice. Hubby loves it! And, I don't mind it at all (seeing that I am in my first trimester of pregnancy with baby #2, and bad nausea)!

We just made this for the first time tonight and LOVED it!  I was out of my usual seasonings to make chicken tenders, so I was kind of worried what the family would think when I made this!  It was SO good!  They ate every last piece of chicken and asked me to make it again soon!  It was a bit messy, but that is part of the fun of making it at home.  The kids really love helping me cook and this was another great one to help with.  Plus, if they help they tend to eat more!  :)  Thanks for a great recipe, definitely will be used again!

I'm always trying to make fried chicken where the coating actually sticks! This did! I found that I had way too much soup, so I used half the can to make chicken gravy to serve with mashed potatoes. Great meal!

i read many reviews and implimented more seasonings(paprika and garlic)like they said. i used chicken legs instead of breasts, left them in the soup mixture for maybe 20mins before coating with flour mixture, let that set until doughy and made sure the oil was very hot(only had 2c. veg oil) the breading still fell off and chicken wasnt very flavorful. was moist and tender though. prolly Not going to make this again, my boyfriend mentioned the breading was "weird lookin"

This chicken was fantastic. We deep fried it and it came out a delicious, golden crispy texture. I've fried chicken before but it always came out a little dry or burnt, and always had issues with the batter falling off, but this one was perfect.

It was pretty good.  My kids loved it (7 & 11), but I thought it was just a bit better than OK.  I added some extra seasoning because we like a lot of spice.  I may have overcooked it a little (I cut the chicken into strips, so I didn't know how long to cook it.) 

One hint for cutting down on the messy fingers is to use one hand to pick up the soup-coated pieces and place them on a paper plate filled with the dry mixture, then use the other hand to roll the chicken and put it on the next plate.  Both hands get messy, but at least they're not GOBBED with batter.

My family loved this recipe.  Like others suggested, I added etra seasoning to the flour mixture and I added about 1/2 cup buttermilk to the soup.  The gooey fingers were worth it. Thanks!!

WOW!! WOW! WOW!!!! This is by far the best fried chicken recipe I have ever made!! I didn't have corn starch so I added bread crumbs instead and it was still amazing! I added a few more spices, we like things a little spicy. Thanks so much for sharing!!!

Best fried chicken EVER..hands down! My kids loved it, my boyfriend who never eats the skin loved it! Hours after dinner he was still raving about how wonderful it was! 
I did let the chicken sit in the soup mixture for about half an hour, then let it sit after shaking in the flour mixture for about 40 mins. I cooked this in a deep fryer and the only problem I had was that it wanted to stick to the basket! Still worth it, though! This will be the only fried chicken I make from now on!

UpDated to add: My boyfriend is still raving about this chicken two days later. He requested that this be the only way I make it from here on out!

I wasn't sure how to rate this because the end product was a hit with my family but the recipe alone was a mess.  It completely fell apart while cooking so I added a couple of tablespoons of the flour mixture to the oil and then added milk to make gravy.  I served the chicken and gravy over rice and my family loved it. The flavor was really good.

This was so good!  The only reason I gave it four stars is because I don't think it was seasond enough.  I made some changes that worked out well, and they were-used herbed cream of chicken soup, replaced garlic powder with fresh minced garlic in wet ingredients.  I started this early and cleaned my whole house before cooking [about 2 1/2 hours] and this was just enough time for the batter to form correctly, so not really a throw together meal.  Delicious and extremely crispy.  Also used my deep fryer.

My family really enjoyed this recipe!  Especially the kids.  I used chicken legs and they took much longer to cook.  They came out beautifully crispy brown and flavorful.  I agree with other posters who have commented that this is a good recipe to experiment with your spices and add them to your liking.

This fried chicken recipe is great.  Extremely juicy results.  The 2nd time I made this chicken, I added cayenne pepper to the flour mixture and what a  spicy treat it was!  Definitely a keeper.

This chicken turned out wonderfully. I will refer people to this page. Otherwise regularly made chicken didn't have enough flavor for me.
And any fried chicken recipe is going to be messy but, this one is well worth the trouble.
Defintally give it 5 stars. My kids husband and mother loved it.

I am not much for frying chicken, I generally don't like the flavor. However, by following this recipe to the letter, I found that it was easy, and very tasty

I was in such a rush preparing dinner tonight that for some reason I had "cornmeal" in my mind rather than "cornstarch". After mixing all of the dry ingredients (cornmeal added instead of cornstarch), I then realized the mistake I had made, but instead of making a new batch, just added the cornstarch to what I already had. I thought that I may have botched the recipe, but it turned out great! Thanks for the recipe!

I thought that this chicken was excellent.  Crispy on the outside, tender and juicy on the inside.  My husband however thought there was too much crust, but I like mine extra crispy.

Chicken was moist and delicious. After cooking once I could see how I would alter the recipe a little to suit my style, but a clear winner in my book! In the future I think I will try to make the coating a little thicker. 8 minutes in the deep fryer at 350 degrees was great.

I usually try a recipe out before I serve it to company.  But I am a gambler by nature.  I followed the directions to the "t" and added some extra seasonings.  I deep fried the chicken at 350 degrees, and it turned out great.  The gamble paid off.  It was alittle extra work and time involved, however the chicken was a perfect compliment to my families Easter Dinner.  Thanks for the recipe, I will use it again!

The flavor was good but I think it would be easier to not put the chicken in a plastic bag. The chicken breasts lost a lot of the chicken soup.

I don't usually do fried cooking, but this was very easy to do in a pot with cut up chicken breast.  I used thin chicken breast so my only suggestion would be is to lower the cooking time, or you will end up with rubbery chicken.  The chicken was very good with a honey mustard sauce for dipping.

This turned out really well. Just make sure you give yourself enough time to let the breading get soggy, mine took almost an hour. I didn't think this recipe was any messier than others, as other reviewers complained about.

It is a must to add more spices. I added more garlic (and lots of it)and onion powder. Very tasty and it is nice and crisp, but very very messy to make. I was cleaning soup/flour mixture from under my nails for hours.

I added quite a bit more spices and it was still fairly bland.  Also the soup didn't hold the flour mixutre stick onto the chicken so it didn't properly.

WHAT A MESS!!! Fabulous chicken but not worth all the mess.  You wait forever for the coating to soften.  I'm rating this a 3 just because of the waiting time and the mess.  If you've got alot of time on your hands and a knack for cleaning the chicken is good.

This recipe was a good base, but I think that maybe there should be some kind of extra flavors in it.I liked the cream of chicken soup thing because it held the coating on when fryed, but  the coating itself is missing something.

I usually try to feed my family lighter fare, but sometimes you just have to splurge.  This was SCRUMPTIOUS!  Everyone liked the great flavor that the soup imparted, and the result was not greasy.  When I make this again, I'll try to get my oil hotter, as it wasn't as crispy as I was expecting, but even then the bits of batter were wonderful tasting. This is very simple, yet very tasty.

Pretty darn good chicken.  Had no problems with preparation.  I added a teaspoon and a half of Lawry's seasoned salt to the flour mixture.  Instead of using garlic and salt I used about a teaspoon and a half of garlic salt.

Pretty messy, pretty good.  I used wheat flour and campbells 98%fat free soup.  Turned out great.  The amount of flour and cornstarch barely does cover it for four boneless skinless breasts.  May want to up that a bit.  I will be making this again.

This is a very nice way to make fried chicken. I had no cream of chicken soup so used cream of mushroom instead.  My family agreed that is was not bad at all and I found it a nice alternative to frying chicken then other ways I use. All my chicken parts were 'bone-in' so cooking took of course much longer then the 'boneless' variety. This recipe could be tweaked in several ways for a more personal taste such as different cream soups, different spices added for the coating, etc.

We love this recipe...we usually cut chicken into tenders before dipping.  A bit messy prep work but worth it!  My kids love with dipping sauce like blue cheese or sweet and sour sauce.  Thanks for such a family friendly meal.

I tried this last night...WOW.  This chicken was very good.  It was crispy and had just the right amount of flavor in the coating. Letting it set and become "doughy" does seem to be critical.  It takes alittle patients, but worth it. I think it is my new fried chicken recipe!!

I have made this a dozen times since I discovered this recipe. With two teenage sons, and a perspective mate in two, I go through TONS of chicken with this recipe!  It's wonderful and worth it every time!

This was the best chicken I have had in ages. Even better than the chicken my "southern" family makes! Very easy to make.

This chicken is excelent. As other reviews suggested, I added more seasoning to the soup mixture as well as the flour mixture. Still needed a little more salt, other then that the chicken came out juicy and the "crust" was awesome! I cut my chicken into strips and made a pan gravy, my kids loved it.

Oh my - Oh my!  If I could give this recipe 10 stars I would.  I can't believe how awesome this chicken was.  I don't know if it was the recipe or the cast iron skillet that I stole from my grandfather, or both, but this will be the only fried chicken recipe I will ever make again.  I've been looking for a recipe like this for a long time and have tried so many with no luck.  I used chicken pieces instead of boneless breasts and I salted the chicken after I took it out of the oil.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was the best fried chicken we have had yet. My husband loved it! We used a deep fryer, but the chicken turned out so tender and juicy while the outside was nice and crispy. Would change nothing and will be making this one over and over again!

Chicken was light and crispy, although it lacked flavor, spices and seasoning.  I would make it again, but add more spices.  My husband and son liked it but also would have appreciated it more if it more spices were added to the flour or soup.

Wonderfully crispy, crunchy chicken! Very much like fast food chicken. Definitely a keeper. I also found it abit bland, (compared to kfc etc)
but added lots of spice and it was fantastic!!

This came out very tasty. Although the batter made it a little hard to turn the chicken it was still very very good.

I really enjoyed this recipe, I did not find it bland at all but I suppose it depends on if the person cooking follows the recipe correctly.  I did not modify anything.  The cream of chicken suop gave it a wonderful flavor, I will definatly make this again

Simple and plain enough.  Nothing really bad to say about this recipe.  However nothing grabs you about the taste of the chicken.  Overall though everyone cleared their plate.

Guests really loved this fried chicken.
It thought a little dry and salty, Next time will use smaller pieces for quicker cooking time and will  skip seasoned salt. After shaking let chicken sit on a cold plate for 30 minutes and the coating did indeed become goopy/pasty, seemed to keep the oil cleaner and breading did not fall off.

I really liked this recipe.  I cheated a little though -- I browned the chicken in the skillet and finished baking it in the oven.  It turned out great!  It was a little messy in the coating process but was worth it.  Great crust!  My husband,parents, and I loved it. :)
