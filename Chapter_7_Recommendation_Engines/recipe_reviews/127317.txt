This is the first time I've made rum balls and this recipe is very easy. Here is my experience:
First, I ground up more (about 70-75) vanilla wafers and pecans (heaping cup) than the recipe requested. Then, I mixed in the sugar and cocoa before I added the liquids. In a glass measuring cup, I poured about a 1/3 cup of rum and a heaping teaspoon of espresso powder. I also added a cap-ful of vanilla extract.
Next, I placed the stick of salted butter and corn syrup into the same pot to melt together. I felt the corn syrup would combine more smoothly with the dry mixture when melted. I poured the melted butter and corn syrup into the bowl and mixed well. Then, I added the rum mixture and mixed very well again. Because my mixture was wet due to the amount of rum, I placed the bowl into the refrigerator to set up for about 15-20 minutes. I used a 1/4 cup ice cream scoop to mold the mixture into 1 ounce balls. I then rolled them in toasted coconut, powdered sugar and cocoa. The balls absorbed much of the cocoa and powdered sugar so a second rolling right before presenting was necessary. They received good reviews from party goers. I'll definitely make these again.

This is the best rum ball recipe I have ever tried.  I used International Coffee flavored coffee instead of instant coffee.  I divided a third into chai, french vanilla and dark chocolate.  I also make mine with a little more rum, as I like mine moister.  I then use them as the cores for truffles and dip them in melted white chocolate and sprinkle nutmeg on the top for the chai, milk chocolate with powder sugar for the french vanilla and dark chocolate with cocoa for the dark chocolate.  They are absolutley amazing with this recipe.

No words can describe HOW AMAZING these rum balls are!  I made a few changes, since it's very difficult to find wafers in Japanese supermarkets :  I simply used 1 box of butter shortbread cookies and a few Sweet Marie cookies.  The Sweet Marie cookies gave them a bit of a soft crunch throughout the ball, that went really well with the walnuts.  I also added more cocoa powder than recommended ( around 50 grams - rather than 20 grams ), to make it more " chocolatey ".  Also, these rum balls are A THOUSAND TIMES BETTER after a few days.  The alcohol of the rum is less sharp and it settles in nicely all over the rum balls, thus flavouring it well.  These rum balls are definitely a DANGER to keep around the house!  So sinfully good!

Delicious but after following the recipe exactly I found that the mix was too mushy to roll into balls. I fixed by adding about 10 more crushed wafers and a handful of chopped nuts. I also used Captain Morgan's Spiced Rum. I rolled some in coconut, some in a mixture of the crushed wafer/pecan mix and some in candy cane shaped/flavored sprinkles. Perfect!

These were a hit!  Fabulous. I did substitute cocoa powder for about 3 baking squares of semi sweet chocolate AND and threw in some more rum, more nuts and a few more wafers!!!  A great recipe.  I also rolled half in coconut and half in sugar. YUM! This is a keeper!

These are great! I rolled mine in chocolate sprinkles instead and they were very easy to work with.

At first I made exactly as written, but they seemed a little gooey to roll into balls, so I added an additional 10 nilla wafers. They were the perfect texture after that and they taste fantastic!

This recipe is a hit (and prone to make you addicted to rumballs). My husband said he didn't care for rumballs. He has changed his mind. Even though I htough my old recipe was good - it turns out there is a big difference with this one and he loved it (and me too).  I add twice as much coffee powder. I put some in with the dry mix and then again dissolved in the rum.   What is cool about this recipe is that the rumballs taste good at first, but with each day they taste better.

These rum balls are AMAZING! I made them for my family's Christmas party last year and out of the thousands of desserts my cousins brought, these were the first to go! (Figures, who could resist rum right?) Anyway.. like everybody else, I modified this recipe a teensy bit. I added more rum like some of the reviews mentioned and my teaspoon of coffee turned out to be almost a teaspoon and a half. I guess it was too watery though because the mix was so sticky! It was really hard to get them into a circle shape since half of it would stick to my hands. Then I tried rolling them in shredded coconut, powdered sugar, almond slices, and sprinkles and hardly any of them stuck on for longer than a minute.   Either way, this recipe definitely deserves 5 stars. Will make again ASAP! :)

I replaced the Nilla wafers with Oreos, a 50:50 mix of white and chocolate varieties (all chocolate is too much chocolate) and added more rum (additional 3 or 4 tbsp after the 1/4 cup). I usually let them sit in the tin for several days. They are always well-received and people ask for more.

This recipe is very easy to change around. I try crushing different kinds of cookies/nuts to see what different flavors will come out. Also, I use honey instead of corn syrup.
