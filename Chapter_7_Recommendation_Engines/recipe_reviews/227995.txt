Great muffin recipe - nicely spiced and delicious!  I love the combination of textures and flavors.  I did use the optional walnuts and added a heaping handful of raisins.  I used a Texas sized muffin tin and got half a dozen huge muffins.  Before popping them in the oven I topped them with a little turbinado sugar for that nice added little crunch.  These baked up beautifully at 400 for a little over 20 minutes.  Perfect with a cup of hot tea!

I used pecans instead of walnuts and I added a heaping quarter cup of organic raisins. I did bake my muffins at 350* for 20 minutes instead of 400*. Chewy, dense and packed with a great mix of add-in's--my family really liked these muffins. They remind me a little of Morning Glory Muffins.

I make these muffins all the time and my kids and I love them.  I don't use raisins or nuts b/c of family preferences, and cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup.  They are excellent as is, but even when I make modifications (substitute milk with 1 Tbsp vinegar for buttermilk, increase or decrease sugar, replace some of the flour with WW flour) they turn out very well.  They are moist for the first 2 or 3 days in a bag at room temp, but then get stale, so I freeze half to pull out later.  Definitely worth a try if you want a yummy, healthy muffin recipe.

I really liked this recipe. I was looking for a carrot apple oatmeal muffin so I used cup each of flour, oats and bran buds cereal. I didn't chop the apple finely, but did use small pieces. I didn't exactly measure the apple or carrots, went by what I thought looked good. I probably added a cup of each.  I baked for exactly 15 minutes and they were perfect!

Really good.  I think it needs a streusel topping or a glaze but they are good as is, too.  Used pecans instead of walnuts just because I prefer them.   I used milk since I didn't have buttermilk.  Be sure to chop the apples extra fine. Mine were too big.

Amazing ! I added a handful of blueberries and a handful or dried cranberries. Like all the other reviews said I reduced the sugar to half. I also used wheat Flour, and milk/vinegar instead of buttermilk.. This recipe deserves all five stars !

These were SO GOOD. I didn't change a thing and they came perfect. The second time I made them I omitted the raisins on request from the kids, and still thy were amazingly good.

The only changes I made were to use bran flakes from the bulk section instead of bran cereal and I added raisins. They turned out wonderfully.

This is the recipe I have been looking for.  I did swap the apple for raisins because I love them and I also added 1/2 tsp of ginger and 1 tsp of cloves to go with the cinnamon.  Sometimes I get a little over zealous throwing in ingredients so if the batter is a bit thick I add some more buttermilk to get the consistency I want.  Nice moist muffin with a great flavour.

Wow!  I made these because we received lots of carrots and I didnt know what to do with them...I paired with apples we already had, along with the "staples".   They turned out like something from a bakery , like Panera or something.  Just perfect.  The only thing different I did because I didnt have cinnamon, I used allspice, and instead of buttermilk I used almond milk with a little butter melted and mixed in.  PERFECT AND DELICIOUS!!  Kid approved!!

Awesome! I whipped these up tonight to eat for breakfast for the coming week. I didn't crush up the bran flakes all the way (they mostly disintegrate when you combine them with the wet ingredients anyway). I didn't have buttermilk on hand so I subbed a milk/lemon juice combo - works just as well. I had no nuts or raisins to add, so I omitted them, but I did add a chunk of fresh ginger which I pulsed in the food processer with my carrots. No muffin tin liners, so I just lightly greased with Crisco. Even with all of my changes (curse me for being ill-prepared!) they cooked up perfectly in 20 minutes at 400 degrees. Moist, flavorful, and not too sweet! 
I especially liked that this recipe was *exactly* enough to fill 12 standard-sized muffin tins - no more, no less. I will definitely be making this one again!

Just pulled these out of the oven and they smell amazing! Was a bit concerned they wouldn't firm up because my batter looked very wet, but I think they'll taste great. Instead of bran cereal, I had some wheat berry cereal with flax seed on hand, so I used that. (It's called Uncle Sam Original Wheat Berry Flakes.) I also added a tsp or two of maple syrup to the wet ingredients, and a couple handfuls of raisins. No nuts, as my toddler wouldn't abide :) I had enough for 15 muffins. The first 12 were done about 3 min early (so 17 min or so), and after reading another person's comment, I'm trying the final 3 muffins at 350 just for comparison. The 350 degree bake was my favorite  -- they are softer and moister.

These muffins were delicious! I used whole wheat flour and brown sugar. I also used plain greek yogurt with a bit of milk instead of the buttermilk. They are really really good!

I don't know what I did wrong - I did substitute Splenda for the sugar which I've done in other baked goods with no problem. The muffins didn't rise at all - I've just got cooked lumps the size of the raw batter!! Doesn't taste too bad but I don't think I'll try this again.

Healthy and delicious. I used the bagged matchstick carrots and half whole wheat flour. I even reduced the sugar just a little.

These are fantastic! First, I love that the batter truly makes 12 regular size muffins. I left out the nuts b/c of allergy issues. I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar. I used plain old bran flakes. I wasn't sure if I should crush the cereal or not, so I did just a bit and the texture was great! I added 1/2 tablespoon of nutmeg and 2 tablespoons of apple butter because I wanted a very apply muffin. I also sprinkled with a bit of white sugar before baking. These are simply wonderful.

I shouldn't rate these 4 stars, as I kind of changed the recipe a little bit, and they might have been 5 stars according to the original recipe.  Don't know, but I added a little more raisin bran, more apples and more carrots.  They seemed a little too bland tasting to me.  Think I'd up the sugar--I'm a sugaraholic--, but weren't quite sweet enough for me.  Also probably needed to double the salt and the cinnamon.  Will try again with those changes, but still add the additional apple and carrot.  Might use brown sugar, too.  I like this recipe, though, as it's got some healthy things in it.  Good way to get some vegetables in the kids.

I did make a few changes: I used Raisin Bran cereal, reduced the sugar to ¼ cup, added dried cranberry and then used strawberry yogurt instead of buttermilk. The muffins came out a bit dry (but that was totally my fault).  I do love this recipe, it’s healthy, fruity and filling – and I love a convenient grab-n-go breakfast.  I’ll make these again, but I’ll adjust the moisture in the batter – I’ve used bran cereals for baking before, and they can sometimes suck-up a bunch of moisture… so be careful.

These muffins were delicious. We followed the recipe to a T with exact measurements and they came out just perfectly, exactly 12 muffins and baked at 400 for twenty minutes. We did crush up the bran flakes ahead of time. Would make again!!

Very dry ! There is something off in the proportions of this recipe. The dry ingredients did seem too much. But I decided to stick to the recipe. The batter was so dry that I ended up adding about half a cup of milk but they still turned out dry and with hardly any flavor.

These were tasty, but the carrots in the muffins turned green overnight.  I read that this has something to do with a reaction with baking soda.  The kids thought they looked to weird to eat.

This was perfect!  Filling and lightly sweetened... exactly what I was looking for!  I used whole milk, and added a quarter cup of wheat germ, and two tablespoons of flax seed meal.  They turned out fabulous!

I thought these were very good and healthy.  I skipped the oil and used applesauce instead to make them a very healthy choice.  They weren't real sweet, but had just enough sweetness.  Ian and I liked them.
