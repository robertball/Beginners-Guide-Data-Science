This was really surprisingly good. I couldn't find blackberry syrup at the grocery store, but I found boysenberry, which seemed close enough. We were all a little skeptical about the addition of the syrup, so I served it without it and let people add at the table, but after trying it both ways we all agreed that it was much better with it. Next time I make this, I'll just top it with the syrup as written.
