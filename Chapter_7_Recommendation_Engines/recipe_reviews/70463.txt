I absolutely loved this recipe!  The only thing I did differently was to dredge the pork steaks in seasoned flour before I put them in with the garlic and butter. It gives the steaks  a nice silky texture and thickens the butter just a tiny bit.  I didn't have green onions so I used 1/2 large sweet onion and it was wonderful! The pork steaks had a delicious flavor and they were so tender! I will definitely use this recipe again - it's easy and quick to prepare after a day of work. THANKS!!

tonite i found myself in a bit of a hurry to come up with something to with the wife's mashed potatoes and came across this recipe.  i did modify it as such:  subst. 2 small/med vidalia onions for the green onions, added a dash of worcestershire to the soy, pressed in 4 cloves of garlic instead of 2, and used 4 steaks instead of 6.  quite simply it was phenomenal.  next time we make this the plan is to use the pan leftovers to make gravy for the mashed potatoes.  i can't recommend this recipe enough, especially with skin-on mashed potatoes!

I've made this twice, once with pork steaks and once with pork loin chops and both times it was great!  I did use more soy sauce than the recipe calls for.  The sauce was great over rice and I'm using the leftovers to make pork fried rice.

This was delicious! I also added a dash of Worcestershire and used regular onions instead of green. Perfect! NASCARBABY, you made a COMPLETELY different recipe and then gave this one 3 stars. How is that acceptable? I see this a lot, actually. It's one thing to tweak the recipe, but to do things that change it completely? Ridiculous. Just because you used the same meat, doesn't mean you have the right to rate this recipe.

5 Plus stars for ease and deliciousity.  I didn't have green onions, and I only had 3 loin chops, bone in.  Otherwise, followed the recipe.  I cooked each side, covered, for about 8 minutes (maybe less) on medium low, and they were done.  Very good and fast.

This is the first time I've even made pork and your recipe is fantastic! I dredged the steaks in flour first, like another reviewer suggested. They were very tender. I loved the combination of flavors! My husband shares my taste for this recipe as well. :-)

I put a twist on this,recipe. I used Ken's Lite Italian dressing.Marinated  for 30 mins. Mean ~while, I cut up carrots,yellow & white potatoes & celery.
 Put in a roasting pan.Drizzled Olive oil over the  vegetables. Then baked at 375 degrees in the oven.After 1 hour, turn the meat over then bake for a half hour more. Took  cover off  for the  last 5 min. to brown the  meat more. Tender & juicy. My husband  loved it.

Yummy! This is sooo good! I used a small regular onion instead of green onions, and I added about a tablespoon of Teriykia sauce. I also used the reduced sodium soy sauce instead of regular. I will make this again, and I think I will also try it with chicken breast.

Yum!  I don't usually favor pork steak, but this recipe is really great.  The sauce reduced down to a beautiful gravy and the meat was very tender and delicious.  Definitely a keeper!

This is SO easy, and SO good!  I used some tenderized pork chops (like minute steaks) that I bought at the local grocery.  I'd never seen pork like that - it must be a local thing (I recently moved to Illinois from Alabama).  Anyway, I followed the recipe exactly, except I was out of minced garlic and used garlic powder instead.  I would never have thought so few ingredients could make something so tasty, but it was delicious.  I served it with mashed potatoes, which were delicious with the sauce over them.  This has earned a permanent spot in my recipe box!

I followed directions exactly including using green onions, but also dredged it in flour mixture of garlic powder and black pepper like another reviewer suggested.  No heat level was directed in the recipe so I cooked them in a cast iron skillet over medium low heat and they turned out real good and the sauce turned into a nice thick gravy.  Served it with rice which did help with the saltiness of the sauce.  Will definitely make again!  Thanks, BabyLove1222 for posting this

Tender, flavorful, very very good! I didn't want to stand at the stove and cook so I popped this in the oven at 350 for 45 minutes. I literally cut the pork with a butter knife. It was tender and juicy. Wonderful, thank you so much for sharing.

I doubled the soy sauce and butter. I also added a tablespoon of teryaki sauce. Per other's suggestion, I dredged the pork chops in seasoned flour. I added garlic pdr. & pepper to the flour. I browned the pork chops a little in a cast iron frying pan before adding to the ingredients. I cooked for 5 minutes on each side and kept covered. This is a delicious meal. Thanks for the recipe.

I have made this many times, and have always "meant" to add a review. it is delicious! I have used green onions and regular onions, and though I prefer green onions, regular onions are also good. I do like to dredge them in flour seasoned with garlic powder and pepper. Great recipe!

This is a great recipe! It's quick, easy and the sauce is amazing. Perfect for a weeknight meal. My fiancé asked if I could make it again tomorrow night! I made a few modifications: I patted salt and pepper on both sides of the pork, then dredged it in flour. I sautéed garlic in the butter for 1-2 minutes, then added 1/4 C soy sauce and 1/8 C Worcestershire sauce to the butter, then added the pork. The sauce was so good, we were scraping the bottom of the pan!

I used this recipe as a base for putting 2 large pork shoulder steaks in the crock pot so it would be done by the time I came home.  I browned the steaks in 1/8 cup butter & 1/8 cup olive oil.  Then added a few good squirts of soy sauce on both sides, took it out of the pan & added the green onions & 4 chopped cloves of garlic to sautee until I could smell the garlic and then removed it from the burner.  I put 1/2 can of undiliuted fat free cream of chicken with mushrooms on the bottom of the crock pot, then the steaks with the onion mixure on top and the rest of the soup on top of that.  Put it on low for 6 hours.   

My oh my, it came out restaurant quality with a perfect delicious gravy and I served it with mashed potatoes.  The flavor of the green onion as opposed to regular is a welcome surprise and I'll make this again in the future.  We loved it!

This was delicious.  My husband and I truly loved it.  We too dredged the steaks in seasoned flour and were very pleased with the presentation.  Oh this is a keeper and truly easy peasy for a quick meal on a work night.  Thanks so much.

This recope works fine and my family enjoyed it. I however felt that it needed something and I found it difficult to pinpoint so I tried to make it more Asian fusion so I used sesame oil for butter, lemon grass instead of the scallions and a hot Ginger sauce for the soy and a half tsp of cream of tartar. All match to the Pork complimented each flavour.

These were very quick and easy to make. I also used a regular onion and they were fine. We ate them with mashed potatoes, broc & cauliflower. They were very tasty, my husband and son loved them. Thanks for a twist to the way I cook pork. FYI, no need to season the chops, the soy sauce and butter definitely has that covered.

We weren't in love with this recipe, although it was very easy to throw together and the pork steaks came out very tender.  It was a little salty for us (even me -- a fish sauce, salt, & soy sauce lover), so good thing we had steamed rice to go with it.  Next time, will use half the butter (the pork tends to have enough fat & juices to still have a good sauce at the end) and half the soy sauce.  I think reduced sodium soy sauce will be the way to go.  I did add some sliced yellow onion with the green onions and would do that again.  Also, I think 1 or 2 tsp of hot chili garlic sauce would be a good addition if you like a spicy kick in the pants.  Thanks for sharing!  I'll give it another go in the future with the modifications and see what happens.  :)

I'm a single guy.  I love to cook and it's so easy to run out of ideas.  When I shop, I buy cheap and I coupon.  Today I bought 2lbs of pork blade steak for $3 and I got some soy sauce for free after a great coupon.  This recipe was perfect for what I had.  Like many others, I substituted green onions for what I had.  I cut one yellow onion in big chunks and used pre-minced garlic.  Because I like heat, I also added a bit of Sriracha.  (If you don't know what that is, you're missing out!)  Everything turned out great!  Thank you for the idea and instructions.

It looked familiar so I tried it, and agree to use teriyaki instead of soy to cut back the saltiness.  I scoop the green onions out while the meat is cooking and then add them back at the end, to warm them up and swirl them through that flavorful sauce. They are so delicate they can't stand being in the pan that long!!   When my mom made this dish, she used oil to brown the meat first, and then tossed in the onions with a splash of apple juice and covered it tight for about 10 minutes. Great results, both recipes.

I don't eat Pork but I made this one night for my husband and he LOVED it!! I bought some more pork steaks so will be cooking this again tonight for him to enjoy. Just a note, that I didn't have green onions the first time, nor will I be using them this time. Instead, I am substituting cooked sweet white onion for some extra flavour and texture.

WOW!!! Having made this 3 times I've changed until perfected. I used teriyaki instead of soy -- reg. onion instead of green -- and I cubed my steak. A major hit with family and friends. This is good enough for church dinner!

A nice alternative to the bbq pork chop! I added 4 cloves of minced garlic, a dash of worcestershire, a couple tablespoons of sweet chili sauce (that I typically use in oriental dishes we make) and some corn starch to thicken the liquid as the meat cooked. The result was very flavorful meat that was a little salty and a touch of sweet.

I hate pork chops!  But I made this recipe and really enjoyed them.  I would add Indian Relish on top the next time I serve this. Update:  Made this again with the "Indian Relish" and it was wonderful.  It tasted like Sweet and Sour Pork!  Love, love, love it!

Fantastic!  Too simple to be good, but then it is.  The only change I made is to greatly shorten the cooking time.  The 10/10 was already more than enough the third 10 was not needed at all.  I'd shorten it some more actually.

I made this for our dinner tonight and it is so good!! I used pork sirloin with bone in, at first i thought after i melted the butter and added the soy sauce and began cooking the meat i thought maybe it would have too much of a salty soy sauce taste so i also added in some water as it cooked, it wasnt too salty afterall and i also want to add that toward the end of cooking, the sauce does thicken up some and it makes a wonderful gravy, also along with the green onions i added sliced onions too, i love this and will make it again for sure

I've tried this twice now.  I didn't care for it the first time, but with all of the wonderful reviews I decided to try it again.  Didn't like it the second time.  All I taste is soy sauce.  Sorry.

I halved the butter & used chives because it was what I had on hand, bit a week later my Hubby is still talking about it. Will definitely put this on the rotation. So simple but so delicious.

This dish is really good and smells good while its hot :) I always double or go 1 1/2 time the sauce for the number of pork steaks I'm making because the sauce cooks down a lot. The first time I didn't double and the sauce ran out and started to crisp on the pan bottom.

The pork was tender, however it was way beyond salty even with just the soy sauce and using unsalted butter.  It really needed something sweet added to it to offset the salt.

Absolutely delicious!!  We were looking for a different flavor than the same ol' seasonings, and WOW does this pack a punch in flavor!! Saved the green onions to sprinkle on top of pork when finished cooking, to me they have better flavor when they are fresh. You could easily use this recipe on just about any type of  protein. Thanks for the share

Easy, quick, delicious. I didn't change a thing. Tried it again the next day with boneless skinless chicken breasts. I was surprised that this recipe is better with chicken. Next time I'll try it with bone-in chicken thighs.

I really liked this method of cooking pork steaks. The meat was very tender, and I was able to make a good gravy after they were done. I used a yellow onion, instead of green. I also didn't use the soy sauce. Instead, I seasoned the meat with seasoned salt, pepper and garlic powder instead of minced garlic. My husband enjoyed it. Turned out tender and tasty. Served it with potatoes and green beans. Yum!

I made this recipe and did not care for it! I love cooking with soy sauce, but it is too strong to use as a sauce that is simmered down. I think if I try this again I would add some sugar to balance the salt in the soy sauce. Not sure...maybe a splash of some kind of broth or wine? Clearly I am not an expert, but highly disappointed.

So Simple and yet so delicious. 
I make pork steaks about 4 times a month and really needed a new good idea, this was it for me.
the steaks were so tender!!!!!!!!!
And delicious. I'll be using this recipes many times, in fact I am cooking it again today.
This would probably work great for pork chops too.

Made this tonight for my husband, 2 children, and myself. It was very good. The sauce left over in the pan was excellent on the fried rice I made with the pork steaks. I didn't deviate from the recipe other than using a little extra butter and soy sauce to have extra "gravy" to use on the rice. YUMMY as is and will defiitely make again.

I just made this recipe for the first time. I used the same amount of butter/soy but seeing I didn't have green onions, I used 1/4 of a white onion. I followed another reviewer and dredged the pork in egg white & flour (seasoned) before putting into the sauce. As the pork cooked, I used some white wine so the sauce didn't reduce too much. It came out very salty but tasty. I served it with a green salad and brown rice. Next time, I will add ginger to the sauce and an asian style salad. Great easy recipe to toss together in a pinch.

WOW!!! This was so easy, quick and tasty. thanks for sharing. I doubled the sauce and added more garlic and onion. I also used up some baby portabella mushrooms I had in the frig bec. I didn't want them to go to waste. Meat was tender and juicy. Everyone loved it. Thinking of using with crockpot in future and with chicken and pork roast. Thanks again. Served with Sally's Spinach Mashed Potatoes (from this site), fried cabbage (using some of the meat sauce) and corn on the cob, and a plate of sliced fresh veggies (cucumber, tomato, lettuce wedges and radishes). Can't say enough, its a keeper.

My husband was saying mmmmmmmm after the first bite. He always likes what I cook but usually doesn't say anything until we are done eating, so I know if something is said before that that he really liked it. Didn't change a thing, it was easy and delicious just as written. Thank you.

Excellent recipe,  I, too used a regular onion (no green on hand).  I reduced the butter and soy sauce as I only had 2 pork steaks.  Turned out just great.  I have added it to my favourite recipes.

I like the basis for this recipe because found out that boston butt steaks are a real bargain and VERY tasty. I don't like to fry so I coat them in poultry seasoning, granulated garlic, and sliced Vidalia onions (in season) and drizzle with olive oil. I cook in the oven at 375 unil golden brown turning once. Not only is this great, but it is also a Cuban dish called Lechon Asado!!!

This was very good. I used regular onion and sliced it up since that's all I had. Also, I only had pork loin so I did 4 pork loin chops. Otherwise I followed the directions exact. Very very good. I loved how the onions were kind of carmelized. They added great flavor to the pork. Will def. be fixing again.

Great recipe and very easy!!! I used regular onions along with the garlic and it turned out wonderfully. To give it a little punch I added hot pepper jelly.

We love pork steaks cooked this way!  Great recipe!  When I have a few minutes, I like to tweak this one a little bit.  I spank a light seasoned flour into the steaks, then brown them in a pat of butter and a little olive oil.  I sit them, covered on a platter, to rest when brown.  I then add some sliced fresh mushrooms, chopped sweet onion, and fresh garlic to the pan, and sauté a couple of minutes.  I season that with salt and pepper, sprinkle with a little bit of flour and cook that another minute or so, then add 1/4 C of chicken stock, the soy sauce and the butter, stir in, add the steaks back, cover and cook in oven.  Tasty, moist, and delicious either way.  This is my husbands favorite food lately!  Thanks so much for the inspiration!!

Excellent flavor! Made this tonight with the following changes. Mixed some flour, pepper and garlic powder in a ziplock bag. Added the steaks and shook to make sure they were fully coated. Melted one stick of butter and browned the steaks on each side. Took the steaks out and added 1 small onion (minced) and 4 minced cloves of garlic. Then added another stick of butter (cubed), a little over a 1/4 cup of low sodium soy, a few splashes of worcestire, some powered ginger and vermouth (I don't measure, probably used about a 1/4 cup). Then I put the steaks back in, lowered the heat to simmer and cooked the steaks covered for 15 min turned them and cooked for another 15 minutes. My family couldn't get enough of the sauce. I was blown away at how good it came out!

awesome!  I mixed teriyaki in with the soy sauce.  The sweet and salty combo was great.  I also used sweet onions instead of green onions.  My only challenge was I used thick pork steaks so the cooking time was much longer.

I altered it a bit and was very tasty. Yum! I marinade 2 pork steaks with our favorite pork rub for 30 minutes in fridge. Minced 2 cloves of garlic. Chopped up some red onions, red bell peppers and green onions. Turn stove on to medium-high heat. Put olive oil in oven proof frying pan and cook the garlic until fragrant and browned. Put the pork steaks in and add the soy sauce. Seared a couple minutes on each side. Preheat the oven to about 400 degrees. When it reaches 400 degrees, throw the red onions, red bell peppers into the pan and about 2 tablespoons of butter. Put in oven for about 3-4 minutes. During the last minute, throw in the green onions and turn the pork steaks over. Take out frying pan from oven and served right away. I like it with brown rice and hot siracha sauce. It was moist, juicy & delicious!

I also dredged in flour and used sweet onions instead of green onion. Family said they were good! One word of advice, I cooked this in a calphalon pan on med high and the soy/butter mixture really carmalized the onion and garlic to the point I thought my pan was ruined (it came out with a short soaking) so be sure to cook on a lower temp.

I changed this a little;  I used the recipe and marinated the pork steaks for 8 hours.  I then grilled them, pouring the extra marinade over them until it was gone.  EXCELLENT flavoring!  I'll definitely be making them again, soon!

Excellent!  I took the suggestions of adding thinly sliced white onions to the green onions & garlic.  Then coated the pork chops in flour seasoned with pepper & ginger.  Deglazed the pan with some chicken broth once the chops were done to bring together a great gravy to serve with mashed potatoes!!  So tasty & so easy!!!

This was like eating a plate of salt and pork. The pork was ok - a little over done, you can eat pork pink these days, it has more flavour. I think this recipe should be revamped.

Terrific recipe as is and is quite adaptable if you like to change things up. Have made this many times now and have always meant to review. It is perfect as is, although I personally prefer to use reduced sodium soy sauce (less salty flavour at the end so that the delicate green onion flavour is more pronounced) and have found I like to dredge the chops in a bit of flour and pepper before cooking. Sauce is easily doubled and does thicken nicely and is great over potatoes, rice, egg noodles, or cauliflower rice. The chops are always tender due to the soy sauce.

These were really good!  The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because there was no temp listed so I kinda had to wing it.  And for someone that needs the specifics to cook anything (usually) these still turned out good, but I had my heat a little high

This dish was very good.  Actually I made two batches- one unfloured and the other floured on both sides.  The ones that were floured were much more tender, tastier and the family liked those more.  It was a tad bit salty from the soy sauce so next time I think I may add a little water to it to dilute it a little.  Overall, my family and I loved it and I will make it again!

I started them in the frying pan then baked in oven while I finished frying the others. I was feeding 10 people. It was delicious and well received.

This was my first time making pork steaks and it will not be my last with this recipe. I put a little flour on the steaks like other reviews did. Great dinner!

Wow.
Used sweet yellow onion and is still great.  I have made it three times in as many weeks.

This was really good.  I didn't have any green onions so I used a red onion.  Mixed everything together in a big skillet (except the steaks) and began cooking.  I thought I turned the burner off but when this wonderful fragrance permeated the air I knew I burned the onions.  A good thing, as Martha says.  My husband and son loved it.  I did too.  Thanks Babylove, this is a keeper.

Even if it didn't taste great (which it does), this recipe deserves 5 stars for the easy factor.  My son is super picky/plain so all I could include was the oil and the soy sauce (and even that was a risk).  We both loved it!  I had only 2, bone in, pork steaks.  But they took up the entire pan so I used the measurements for 6 as in the recipe.

I wasn't sure about this, but decided to try it after reading the reviews.  We were pleasantly surprised.  I used low sodium soy sauce and maybe a T. of Worcestershire.  A regular onion only because I didn't have any green ones.  We really liked it a lot.  Thanks!

I made this recipe exactly as stated. My steaks were a bit lean and I was worried they would be tough but they were so tender. I tenderized with a mallet to thin them out a bit therefore the cooking time was also reduced. This is a keeper for my family as even my picky  9 yr old ate every bite. Great minimal ingredient quick recipe! Kudos to you AND mom!

I made it exactly as written. I hate to complain, but I honestly hated this. I love soy sauce on white rice, but I am not sure why this was so bad on the pork. I had to scrape off the sauce and add some honey to get some flavor back to make it edible.

The recipe was super easy but the flavor didn't agree with my palate. I don't know if it was the combination of soy sauce and butter or the green onions but just was not appealing to me taste wise. I am giving it 4 stars because of the simplicity of the recipe and because my mother loved it. Next time I will try it with Worcestershire sauce instead of soy sauce. And yellow or white onion instead of green.

I made it for myself tonight.I didn't use a  pork Butt steak,I used a Pork shoulder steak bone  in,not sure if that makes a difference,it  was on sale.I wanted to eat a pork chop but this looked good and cheap for the size of it and I like bone in and all they had other then this was boneless.I didn't know how to cook it.This seemed different then pork chops I cooked before and recipes warned about cooking it wrong and makies it tough.I just happened to have all the ingredients.I just bought gr onion,because they were also on sale.I don't have them here a lot.I used the same amount of everything(except pork steak,I had 1 ) and just 3 gr onions.The recipe came out delicious,easy and very tender.I still have half left.That sauce was delicious and so simple.Thanks for the recipe.

Brown steaks in sesame oil. Take out of pan add butter, soy sauce and ginger, onion, garlic powder. Once blended return steaks to pan. When steaks have finished cooking take out of pan. Add to pan 1T flour. When mixture thickens return steaks to pan. Put excess sauce on rice.

Was very good.  You must use a pork steak from the pork butt to get the flavor from the fat

I don't cook pork very often and I found myself with some center cut pork steaks today. So I decided to try this recipe. Surprisingly it is very good!!! The meat was juicy and tender, and it doesn't smell "porky" at all. That's my other thing with pork, I don't like the smell. I love the onion and garlic combined with soy sauce. I also dredged the meat in some flour as the other commenter suggested. Lovely recipe, thank you!

Quick and easy!  I made a couple of adaptations based on other reviews and it turned out beautifully.  I didn't have green onions but used a chopped onion, chopped garlic, soy, and a little worcestershire.  I made a pan sauce after they steaks were cooked with white wine, whole milk (didn't have cream), butter, and a little flour to thicken.  It was my first time having pork steaks and it was fantastic!

I changed mine up a little while the original I'm sure was great too. Mine came out excellent. Instead of using soy sauce, I just used Worcestershire sauce. I also used a regular onion and only made a few changes because I had neither, but also not a big fan of soy sauce (I know, I'm crazy). I also used the advice of another reviewer who stated that she drizzled hers with flour prior to cooking the pork steaks. So 1, I melted butter, 2, added 1 white regular cut up onion (any will do) 3, sprinkled onions with garlic pepper seasoning and sautéed. Temp was at a 5 on my stove, I'm all electric, so medium heat...don't overcook or get too too hot, may cause onions to burn once the steaks are added if too hot, so watch out there. Next add your Worcestershire sauce and give it a little stir. While that is simmering, mix up some flour and garlic pepper seasoning, I shake mine in a bag, but to each its own. I then put them on top of hot onion mixture and cook on each side covered for 6-8 minutes. While that is cooking, preheat your oven to 350. When both sides are browned, flip them before putting them in the oven and keep them covered. Cook for about 15-20 minutes in the oven. Everyone in my family loved them. So juicy and tender, you're in for a real treat!!

I've never had cooked pork steak before and this was tasty and easy. I can see how easy it would be to over cook and make them tough. I did dredge the meat in seasoned flour before putting it in the skillet.

My family adored this meal. I did change up the recipe a bit. Used 1/8 cup of Soy sauce and 1/8 cup of Worcestershire sauce. I used chops instead of steaks. I also seasoned the chops before placing them in the butter sauce. This recipe will be added to my weekly dinner rotation. Quick & delicious too. Very tender dish.

Great recipe! I used a yellow onion instead of green because that's what I had in the kitchen. The only other thing I did was to add 1 cup beef broth to the pan drippings after removing the meat to a plate and thickened it up a bit to use as a gravy over mashed potatoes. My entire family loved it and will be making again!

We loved this recipe. I made it with no changes and the meat was tender, juicy and with the perfect balance of flavors. My only complaint was that there is no information about the temperature to cook the pork at. I didn't want the pan to hot because that would burn the onion and garlic but I needed it hot enough to brown the pork. I decided the best way was to cook it all at once on med. to med. high, it all came out perfect. I served it with rice and sliced tomato. This recipe is a keeper. Thanks....Andrea

I just made this for dinner and was pleasantly surprised how good it was.   I dredged in flour as others recommended.  I didn't have green onion so used half of a sweet onion.  The left over sauce was delicious on mashed potatoes.  I can't imagine using 6 pork steaks for this.  I only used two large pork steaks and we needed all of the sauce because it cooks down.  Very delicious and will definitely make again.

First time seeing pork butt steaks at grocery. Picked these up and found this recipe in the search. Followed exact recipe, it was quick and came out really good. Kids actually loved it. Made with steamed rice and broccoli.

I make something similar but leave out the soy sauce and add a can of evaporated milk (mixed with a couple of tbsp of corn starch) to the pan after sauteeing pork chops with green onion, (in olive oil). A dash of white pepper and a touch of salt, and you've got pork chops and gravy to serve with mashed spuds. YUMM.

I've used this recipe for pork steaks over and over and it's delicious, my boyfriend and I love it! Super easy dinner, I serve it with rice and steamed veggies or toss some vegetables in the same pan as the steak. The steaks I get (about half - 3/4of annual inch thick) cook much faster than the recipe so they're pretty much done after the cook while covered process. I cook them on medium low heat. Definitely worth trying! (: I'm definitely continuing to use this recipe for pork steaks ?

The only pork steak I could find was at Whole Foods-one of the least expensive meats they carry, ha ha! So I removed the bone and cut it into medallions. Therefore, it cooked a lot faster than 8-10 min each side. I kept stirring the meat around--I'd say it cooked in 8 minutes total.
I also substituted Tamari (gluten free soy sauce) for regular soy sauce. Yes, I'm one of those gluten free chicks ;)

For beginners at cooking,  be sure to cook the pork and the vegetables both at a reasonable temperature. I failed to do so and burned the green onions and the soy sauce evaporated. I would say cook between low and medium (between 3 and 4) . But even with the green onions burnt (in which I had removed them after cooking lol) the pork was still very good!

This was awesome!  I made a minor change of adding a dash of Worcestershire sauce per another reviewer's recommendation.  I used dried chives instead of fresh green onions, because that is what I had available.  I used pork shoulder steaks.  Fantastic!  I'll use this recipe again.

This recipe is so simple and delicious, a bit salty will definately cut back on the soy sauce next time.  Did not have green onions so I used a sweet onion and it was just fine.  Served with mashed cauliflower and definately would not salt next time.  Thickened the sauce and served a gravy on top of the dinner.  I did brown the steaks first.
The 3 rating-who writes their own recipe on a review and rates the recipe, just wrong.

It worked very well.  I substituted purple onion for the green onion and garlic salt for garlic clove.  When I do this again I will not cook it as long.  It was a little dry. Using a cast iron pan might have made the difference.  Great recipe!

Pretty tasty. I did not love the green onions. Next time I'll just use some yellow onions and cut them into rings. Was really fast too. Definitely a weeknight meal.

This dish was phenomenal!!  I forgot fresh garlic, so sprinkled a little garlic powder on before baking and it was so delicious.  I had to bake for 30 minutes (maybe a little more) as my frying pan wasn't big enough for all 4 pork steaks, but, I bet frying will make the meat even better!!  This will go into our rotation with pork chops.   I can't wait to cook pork again!

This was everything it was touted to be, and more!
The pork was so tender that I almost didn't get the "steak" onto the plate before it broke up. This will go into my personal recipe box, and I will make it often.

this was a delicious easy recipe to make.  I followed others suggestions about dredging the pork.  I did this in flour and bread crumbs.  it really sealed in the flavor.  Next time I think I'll cook this on a lower heat.  the onions started to burn at the end.

While I thought the taste of the pork steak was very good I was not real taken with this recipe.  The onion garlic and soy sauce pretty much cooked away almost to the point of burning.  I am going to try it again just because the flavor of the meet was so good but I think next time I will cook the meat almost all the way done before adding the other stuff and also I think I will use regular onions; the onion flavor was really lacking.

Came across this recipe while looking for a quick way to cook pork steaks. I used wild pig leg steaks and overall they came out really nice. I followed the advice of some other reviewers and dredged the pork in flour first. Glad I did because the steaks came out with a nice silky texture. Didn't have green onion, so made it without. This recipe was surprisingly flavorful for having so few ingredients! My only complaint is that it was a tad salty for my liking, but not enough to keep me from making it again. Maybe next time I'll try with low sodium soy sauce.

This is a great recipe for such an odd and not very good cut of meat.   Best one I've tried so far for pork steak.  The only thing I would do is increase the sauce so you could have more to put on mashed taters.  Yum yum!

I gave these a five since they were so easy to make and I and 1/2 of my family thought they were really great. A couple kids ate them, but were not awfully impressed, but so easy and I thought they were a 5.

I followed this recipe to the letter.  It was quick and easy, yes, but it the meat was also gray and tasteless.  I don't get it.

This was a hit! I used boneless pork chops and took the advice from other reviewers and dredged the pork in flour before adding to the pan. The sauce thickened and was absolutely delicious!!

A very good weekday evening recipe. I found it a little too salty, but others in my family thought it was fine. I did deglaze the pan with 1/3 C. of sherry and pour that over the steaks, and it made a very good gravy.

I tried these first, as I always do, exactly as the recipe is written.  They were very good and tender.  The next time I added a little brown sugar to the pan and they came out with a wonderful glaze.  I recommend both ways.

Delicious! I was looking for a fast and different way to cook my porkchops tonight and this was it! Unfortunately, I was very limited on supplies and didn't have any green onion or any sweet onions for that matter. The soy sauce and butter makes the pork so tender. I added lots of black pepper to give it more flavor though. Quick. Easy. Delicious. And you can customize this in SO many ways. Great pork recipe!

I did what a previous writer did and put the three boneless loin chops that I had in seasoned flour before putting them in the pan. I did not use butter, I used light olive oil only. I followed the rest of the directions and they were very good. The amount of soy sauce was too much for my husband, so I used less of the low sodium brand and put in more Worcestershire which made it taste very "beefy". Probably won't make this too often.

I used a tbsp of minced ginger additionally, let them marinade for 30 min, and broiled them for the last 5 min for a nice dark brown colour.

I made these pork chops for supper, and they were absolutely delicious. I made them with butterfly chops instead of steaks, and  I used regular onions and a bit of  Montreal steak spice on them.  They were so good that my husband said I can make them at anytime for him.  
I will surely  make them again and again.

Okay....my pan wasn't large enough, so I cooked half on top of the stove, and the other half in the oven. The one on the stove seemed to overcook my green onions, which left a dark coloring on my chops. The oven chops were okay, but I have had better. Oh well, better luck next time.

This was a delicious recipe despite the simplicity of the ingredients.  I followed some of the earlier reviews by adding a dash of worcestershire sauce and varied the spring onions with brown onions.  The aroma while simmering was great.  I used pork chops because that was what I had but I would use a more tender pork cut the next time I cook this.

This was great, I did make some adjustments to the sauce (with the exception of a few more cloves of garlic), but only after the steaks were taken out. While cooking I did everything as per recipe: it worked great. AFTER I took the steaks out of the sauce, I added sugar and flour to make a terriyaki sauce out of what was essentially the component parts in the pan. It was great! The original didn't -need- the sugar but I would suggest it as a nice flair.

Made this for dinner tonight. Used thick boneless pork chops. Definitely have to agree on the light soy sauce, wasn't salty. The family loved it. The only thing leftover was a little bit of rice and the gravy I made from the sauce. Husband is taking that for work tomorrow. Definitely a keeper!!!!

Loved this recipe! The only changes I made were to use onion and garlic powder, and added about 1/4c. pineapple juice. We loved how the sauce thickened into a glaze. Just a little salty, so next time, I'm going to add 1 Tb. brown sugar. Low salt soy sauce might help too.

Excellent as is!  Love it.  I have made this recipe 5 times.  Family loves it.  Easy and tender.  Will make again.  I have tried it with green onion and regular onion.  Either way is delicious.  I use pork steak.  I will try chicken sometime.

Excellent! Used 1/2 a yellow onion, 2 green onions, and 1/2 a sweet onion. So good, my kids even ate it! It is so quick, it was done before my noodles and vegetables! Would be really good over rice as well! A Keeper for sure!

My husband is not one to try new things.  He always buys pork steaks at the store and we bake them EVERY time.  Boring....so I started dinner before he got home and the look one his face was not a very interesting one.  I asked him what he thought after he took his first bite and was amused when he didn't even answer me until his 3rd bite when he finally managed to say it was wonderful before devouring the rest of his dinner.  So I would say this was definitely a big hit!!

This was a good recipe for pork steak.  I used lower sodium soy and added some Worcestershire.  I didn't have green onions so I used some of the leeks I had out for the yummy potatoes gratin I made to go with steaks. I cooked the steaks to well done 180 (I'm prego)and they were still mostly moist and had good flavor.  Would be really good if you could pull them at 170. Will use this recipe again. Thanks

Great recipe. Very simple. My girlfriend said it tasted very much like a recipe she sometimes make, except this one leaves out the lemon juice.  If you're feeling punchy, through in some lemon juice, she says.

My husband loves his pork steaks breaded and fried, but I'm not supposed to, especially the bread part.  He hates onions, I love onions. This was a great compromise and he absolutely loved these, not even commenting on the onions (for the first time)!

I've come back and editied my review.  I origionally said it was too salty but I've made it again with reduced salt soy sauce and that's solved the problem. The reasons I'm giving it 5 stars is because my husband loved it, it was really easy to make & quick to prepare.  Usually when I make pork it always comes out dry but this recipe came out nice & juicy.  I'll definitely be making it again soon.

i made this tonight and loved it! i also made quite a few changes. my bf doesnt like onions so i used a half an envelope of onion soup mix,combined it with flour and dredged the pork steaks in the mixture before browning. i also added about 1 1/2 cups of beef broth and a few tablespoons of worcestershire to the soy sauce. after the pork was done i thickened the sauce with flour to make gravy. i will definately make this again, so simple and yet so tasty.

This recipe is great. The steaks come out so tender and flavorful. My kids cleaned their plates of this and were raving about it. The "only" change I made was to use Worchestershire sauce in place of Soy sauce (only because I didn't have Soy sauce on hand plus its cuts the sodium content down considerably). I was concerned, when I started to cook the onion and garlic that it wouldn't work, since the smell was a bit off, but in the end the meal was great.

Absolute perfection!  Based on some of the other reviews & my own intuition I changed a few things:  I doubled the soy sauce/butter & dredged the pork steak in flour prior to adding.  I also waited until the last few minutes before I added the garlic & onions.  I also added some red, green & yellow bell peppers for color, as well as a smidge of crushed red & sesame oil & seeds as garnish when I plated it.  It was great.  My super-picky kids even asked for seconds!

Simple, fast and delicious.  The meat came out wonderfully tender and juicy, the onions nicely carmelized.  Would probably make wonderful gravy, but didn't want to add more calories!  My family loved it, even my toddler!

These were barely edible. It was the first time I've ever made a pork steak.  I don't know if it was the cut of meat I got from the butcher or if I just don't care for pork steaks. It may not have been the recipe itself.  I may try this with chops and see how that goes.

Very good.  I omitted the green onions and garlic, and used pork loin chops.  Cooked about 7 mins on each size covered, uncovered for 5, beautiful.

So simple. First, I cut the meat into cubes and also dredged mine in flour. I used garlic powder and a bit of honey to sweeten it up.

10-3-2019 I made this tonight and I can't see myself eating pork chops any other way.  This made them so delicious.  I made it with pork butt blade steaks.  I dredged them it flour that was seasoned with paprika and seasoned salt.  I think that helped it have a gravy  like consistency.  I also marinated them in buttermilk for an hour then dredged it directly in the flour, no drying off. This is definitely my go to recipe!

Other than adding a bit of fresh ginger in with the garlic I made no changes to this recipe. To the people saying it has too much soy sauce, I think you should try cooking it a bit longer. The soy sauce will cook off if you give it more time. I will definitely be making this again.

We loved this recipe!!!! I added  a little low sodium broth so the soy sauce wouldn't concentrate as much and added 1 1/2 TBSP of sugar to balance the saltiness of the soy sauce. I also microwaved some quartered fresh brussel sprouts for 4 mins and added to the pork when I turned the pork loin over. OMGoodness this is a keeper!

Great recipe! I've made it a few times now and have followed the directions exactly and they've come out great. This last time I made it though, I realized a little too late that I did not have soy sauce :( so I cooked the pork the same way except with double the butter and I coated the pork in flour with seasoning (as another commenter mentioned). I took out the pork steaks once done and added 1/4 cup of marsala wine (the only thing I had) to the same pan with 1/2 cup of heavy cream.  It came out tasting like an onion sauce so it was good alternative.

I usually try a recipe as written first before I change anything but this was an exception . I made the following changes: 1) I did not have green onions so used a regular white onion. 2) I used low sodium soy sauce, and 3) I used half butter, half olive oil.  I used 1 whole onion for 2 steaks and wished I had double the onions, they tasted wonderful having caramelized in the oil. The recipe is easy, quick, and the pork came  out tender and with good flavors , it may be a bit too salty for me if I used regular soy sauce but that's just personal taste. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Good starting point. Added onion powder, garlic powder, and smoked paprika. Loved the idea of everything in zip lock bags;  throw out what doesn't get used of the eggs and flour mixture  bag and all. Best part, no extra dishes to wash. Cooked these in a heavy stainless steel pan. Watch closely as heat needs to be adjusted so pork cooks through and doesn't burn.

This recipe is absolutely spot on. The ingredients are so basic and can easily be upgraded with mushrooms or really anything else you're in the mood for. Perfectly delicious as is, and cooking times are on the money. This is really a no-fail recipe for preparing a delicious inexpensive cut of pork.

I made it according to directions, but took a couple of suggestions from others, and lightly breaded and fried the pork steaks first, then added some hot honey in to cut the bitterness of the soy sauce.  It was a huge hit at my house, and I was asked to make it again.  I put it in my keeper file.

Made as directed.  There was only one issue.  There's NO way I could fit 6 steaks in a skillet, to brown them at once. :)  
The chops were delicious.  I will use low sodium soy sauce, next time.

These turned out great!  I added some coarse black pepper at the start, then some sliced baby portabellas at the end. I used an iron skillet to cook 3 at a time. I kept the lid off a bit more than the recipe called for. Just needed to evaporate some liquids and get a nice sear on the meat. Served with garlic mashed potatoes and Brussels sprouts.  Great flavor!

I tweak this recipe and add sauteed vidalia onions and mushrooms half way through the cooking of the pork, and add the green onions fresh and at the end.  it's cheap,  easy,  and definitely a family favorite.

I like salt, but buy reducing soy sauce in a pan like this, it becomes super super salty. I knew this because I've done it before, but I tried this recipe anyway. I think this would work much better if the soy was diluted, at least by a third, with water and also to add a bit of sweetness to it, like a couple table spoons full of agave. Had too much of a none note flavor (soy) to where I didn't even taste the onions. The steak was pretty tender though - I was surprised.

I bought some pork shoulder blade steak on sale the other day and was looking for a recipe when I came across this. After reading all the reviews, I decided to try it out with a few adjustments: I doubled the butter and soy sauce, substituted a small purple onion for the green onion because that’s what I had at the house, plus I added 1/4 cup Worcestershire  sauce, 1 tablespoon of red wine vinegar, and about a tablespoon of sugar. After sautéing the onion and garlic in the butter, I added the remaining ingredients (minus the pork) and let simmer for about two minutes. Then I poured the sauce over the pork in a baking dish and baked for 45 minuets at 350. When the pork was done I poured the remaining liquid back into the sauce pan and let it reduce before adding some cornstarch and making it a gravy that I topped each pork shoulder blade steak with before serving. I paired it with rice (which everyone chose to top with gravy) and sweet corn. It was a big hit at my dinner table and I will definitely be making it again.

this is an awesome recipe. I used teriyaki sauce in place of soy. i added it at the beginning of the first steak and it got sticky and over cooked. on the second one i added it when i flipped it and it came out perfect. The steaks were super tender and cooked twice as fast as oven baking.

I made this and the meat had a wonderful flavor!  My green onions did get done too fast.  How have you guys prevented this?  Did you take them out and put them back at the end or am I cooking it on too high of heat?  Thanks for the help!

Added an apple, s;iced, at the saute stage, with the other ingredients.  
Beautiful!  My wife wants me to make it again soon.

Cooked this as directed, but ended up calling it quits just a couple of minutes into the "uncovered" stage, as it was in danger of being overcooked. We were wondering how "Asian" it would taste, but it didn't at all - it was just deliciously savory.  Restaurant quality, tender and delicious, we ate it with some mashed potatoes, and I used some dissolved cornstarch to thicken the sauce a bit. This is a keeper at our house.

Delicious! I definitely didn't cook the pork steaks as long as the recipe said though. My steaks were 1-1 1/2" thick so they only needed about 4 minutes per side.

Used low sodium soy sauce and a red onion since that was what I had on hand. Turned out great! Awesome flavor and very tender. I also threw in some chanterelle mushrooms for the last 10 minutes or so.  Yum!!!

We loved this. I used red onion instead of green onion and towards the end of the cookin added some left over roasted potatoes from the previous night. I will definitely make this again.  I just realized I didn’t cook the steaks for that last 10 min. without the cover. They didn’t need it though.

This was a super easy super, fast way to cook some delicious pork steaks. My family gobbled it all up. Although it didn't have any juice i was hoping to spoon some over my steak it was more like grease. But that was probably my fault. I will be making again!!!! And again, and again.

Very easy to follow with simple ingredients and a great result.  Like others, I floured the steaks lightly and the gravy was really thick and adhered to the steak.  Very tender.

Turned out excellent. I worried because of the soy sauce that it would be too salty but it was perfect. Only thing I did differently was dredging the pork in flour.

Admittedly I was hesitant to cook meat this way...steaming...could only imagine it being tough.  As another reviewer suggested I used a whole white onion since I didn't have any green onions and made a rice/orzo side dish to use the sauce on.  It was so good.  I followed the recipe for time of cooking and will make this again.

I browned the meat and then put it all in the oven for 24 min.
Would also consider marinating and grilling. Husband loved it.

Wow. Delicious. Loved it. And so simple. Perfect flavours to accompany pork - slightly sweet bitter salty taste of the soy, richness of the garlic and sharpness of the scallions. Complimented the meat rather than overpowering it. Covering the dish keeps the meat very succulent but still nicely coloured from the butter and soy.  I added cooked baby potatoes right at the end to crisp up and accompany. Will definitely be cooking again. Thanks!

Very easy recipe. And delicious. I did add the Worcester as well. I also put in the oven for an additional 30 minutes to steam and make sure the meat is fully cooked. Family loved it. Will cook again

Too much of a rainy Pacific NW evening to grill so I made this with my pork steaks. Excellent, in a word. Followed exactly except I did flour my steaks (little salt and pepper with the flour). Otherwise followed the script. I used my cast iron pan and that always makes food taste better. I would have preferred to have more green onions than I did (I only had three). Next time I will have more on hand. For tonight, we enjoyed them as-is watching the Mariners.

Love this recipe.  I've added onions and red peppers and serve over rice.  Sometimes I add a little flour to thicken the sauce.  Sauce is so simple, but awesome.   Occasionally we add mushrooms too.

I was a bit skeptical of this when I first saw it. But it was amazing! I didn't have a green onion, so I used a yellow onion I had on hand and I did flour the pork steaks. Definitely will be my go to for pork steaks. Thank you for sharing the recipe

I've been making my pork chops similar to this all my life but don't use soy sauce in them.  This recipe had so many good reviews that I thought I'd try it for something different. I liked the taste but hubby didn't like the soy sauce taste. Like a lot of other reviewers I always dredge my chops in flour for the added flavor browned flour gives most any fried meat. I will be making this again and again but will do it my grandmas way.  She always coated her chops in flour then browned them in a mixture of both cooking oil and butter and added salt,pepper and garlic powder or minced garlic whichever you have on hand to taste on each side of her chops after she turned the so the seasonings will stick and stay put on her chops. Once your meat has all been browned sprinkle your diced green onions on top, pour in (about a forth of a cup of water or more if using more chops) to your skillet but don't drain your cooking oil off.  Cover and turn your heat down to med/low.  Cook until meat is tender turning often so your chops don't get glazed and hard on the side in contact with your skillet. Very good southern cooking!  Then make gravy from your pan drippings for your mashed potatoes. Yum!

Followed the recipe using white onion instead of green, added a dash of Worcestershire sauce, and seasoned my pork first. Came out delish. Used the leftover drippings to make gravy. I only used 1 steak and 2 pork chops and barely had enough drippings so I would double it. Fast, easy, and the family loved it.

I made it exactly as recipe & it was AMAZING!!!! So easy & simple & SOOOOO delicious!!!!!  I made it for myself but made tiny plates for my kiddos to “try” & they asked for more & I barely got any for myself.  I had leftover mashed potatoes & some mushrooms I needed to cook & I served with both with the sauce over all & it was like a meal from a 5 star restaurant. Next time I will make more!!! Please let me know your recipe for the pork fried rice just in case I have leftovers next time

Really delicious! I used sweet onions and chives. Then covered with foil and baked in oven for 45 minutes so that it would be tender. I had to double the liquids because it dried out. otherwise, I followed the directions and some of the suggestions I.e. flour. I will definitely make again!

Made this for the boyfriend last night and it was delicious! Made it how the recipe said but added mushrooms in with the green onions and garlic. Made quinoa for a slide and once the steaks were done I mixed the remains with heavy whipping cream for a gravy on top! So good!!

I had 2 huge pork shoulder steaks and used my biggest stainless pan and they fit great. I found the sauce dried up on the last 10 minutes of open cooking, but overall this was delicious! I also didn't have green onions, so used a yellow one. I'm going to try others' trick of adding a dash of Worcestershire sauce and maybe a little water at the end, or stock.

Flavorful and quick. Should mention that you need to cook the steaks in batches. On the second and succeeding batches the onions go past carmelized into burned. Still tasted pretty good, though.

Followed some of the advice from others - thank you! 

Added additional soy sauce, and Worcestershire sauce. Included a good amount of mushrooms. Delicious over rice and will be making the pork fried rice for leftovers.

The cooking concept and flavor combination sounded fabulous, but after cooking it exactly as the recipe called for,  it was SO SALTY.  I even used low sodium soy sauce.  I will experiment with different liquids in the future.  The pork steak itself was tender and juicy.

Absolutely delicious and so quick & easy to make!   I made the recipe exactly as written.  However after reading several reviews, I too lightly coated the pork steaks with flour prior to putting them in the skillet.  It gives it a thick-like smothering gravy. The pork steaks were tender and tasty!

Three stars for easy cooking. A little bland for me. Pork was tender just didn't  have much flavor. I will try making it again but will modify ingredients.

I didn't cook the pork as long as stated (I also seasoned them with salt and pepper before adding them to the pan)- I did 10 min one side and then 4 min on the other then I turned off the stove and let them sit for 10 minutes. My super picky boyfriend and his son both loved it- the onions were excellent along with the sauce. Easy and delicious.

I made it as written but wanted to cook it longer because I had a larger thick pork steak. Kept adding a little chicken stock and it was amazing! I am not a pork fan, but loved this. Will happily  make this again.

Love how easy it was and especially that it's only 4 ingredients and one pan. Super easy clean up. Tasted great but fell a little bit flat and salty. Next time I will throw in some Sprite and or pineapple

Omg, I was pleasantly surprised at how delicious this came out. My doctor has me on a low FODMAP diet and this fit the bill, I just didn't use garlic in mine. So simple and easy to make too.

Good recipe, but some of the proportions of ingredients are a bit off. Overall though, a great combo and concept that can make some delicious and inexpensive pork!

Very good.  I used Pork Shoulder steaks, bone-in.
They were a little chewy but delicious.  I thought the sauce was a little too salty so I would cut down the soy sauce by maybe a third.  I would make this again.

This was good and easy to make. I didn't give it 5 stars because it wasn't up my alley, too much soy sauce for me. I was surprised the sauce went well with the potatoes though, but I do like salt on potatoes, so that's probably why. If I were to make it again I would probably add shredded carrots or maybe serve it with sweet potatoes to add some sweetness

This is a very simple recipe to make but it has such a full flavor. I first dredged the pork steaks in a bag with flour (as recommended by others) and was very pleased with the results.

I grew up with my mom making pork chops/steak in a mushroom soup gravy with fried onions. Nothing ever compared with this, but now I have another way of preparing pork steaks that rivals even my old favorite recipe.

This was good.  The only change I made was to flour the pork steaks like one comment suggested.  I also used less steaks because I didn't have 6.

My adult children rated this a three. But they sure devoured it like If they had rated it a 5. My husband on the other hand rated it a four/five. He said the meat was tender and flavorful. I confused the Worcestershire sauce with the soy sauce (oops). I don't think it really made a difference though. I'm totally making this again! Thanks for the simple quick full of flavor recipe.

I cooked the pork steaks exactly as called for in the recipe except that I used 1/2 of a yellow onion.  It was delicious.  I will definitely make this again.  Quick, taste and easy to make.  A great recipe.

It made it exactly like the recipe but it was way too  salty even though I used low sodium soy sauce. Maybe adding some brown sugar can balance the saltiness out a bit?

Made this for supper tonight! I wasn't sure how it was going to turn out, but we loved it. I didn't have any soy sauce, so I improvised. I mixed a tablespoon of molasses,  poured some liquid from a jar of olives (green), and then two beef bouillon cubes in a very hot cup of water. After sautéing purple onions and minced garlic, I poured the substitute soy sauce mixture in the hot pan, floured the pork steak , plus season for taste, then cooked as directed.

My husband is the better cook and pork steak is one of his favorite foods - he unexpectedly had to work so I had to fix them and was terrified. Thank you for the recipe because he RAVED about them!~ Not only was the flavor FANTASTIC but they stayed so juicy... The only change I made was the onions - didn't have green, so used some sweet yellow and red.

I only made a steak for myself. I used yellow onions instead of green. Steak was tender but needs more flavor. The combinations of the soy sauce and garlic does take away the soapy taste that pork can have. I used a little worcestershire sauce too. I used the soy sauce packet that you get from the Chinese restaurants. If you use grocery store bought soy sauce it probably won't taste too good. This is a nice recipe for a quick easy meal. I wouldn't serve this to guest though.

So easy and fast, I have no complaints. So little to do but a lot of flavor. I added a little black pepper on top and used a little extra soy sauce and butter to have that extra sauce. This is a keeper.

it was awesome!  i made 4 servings but used 1/4 cup soy sauce along with adding 1/4 to 1/2 chicken stock. it cuts the saltiness of the pork and sauce by a lot.  i also added about a cup of baby portobello mushrooms and it added a very nice texture/flavor. to help thicken the sauce a bit i also used about a tablespoon of cornstarch diluted with a little bit of water.  perfect!

This was really good and I loved how easy it was.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I didn't have green onions, so i substituted dried chives and it worked great in the recipe.  The sauce tasted great over mashed potatoes.

OMG this is good! This was probably my least favorite cut of pork, now every time pork steak goes on sale I'm grabbing them up.  I make them a bit different, only using 3 steaks because they're HUGE  (I would definitely double the sauce if I did 6).  I make the sauce and pour it over the steaks already laid out in a pan, then cover them with foil and cook them  in the oven until done.  They come out tender and juicy, and everyone is drooling waiting for them to come out of the oven.

Absolutely Delicious!!!! I followed the recipe, but used two pork shoulder steaks, white onions, and dredged in flour as a few others have mentioned. This has become my husband's and my new favorite way to make pork steaks! Extremely tender and flavorful. Just the right amount of seasoning. Thanks BabyLove for the recipe!!!!

I changed it up a little bit.
Didn't have soy sauce or green onions.
Used garlic powder instead of minced garlic.
Spread Burman's Original Barbeque sauce mixed with brown sugar and a little bit of the garlic powder then battered it with flour.

I made this last night.  We loved it!  It's super simple with only a few ingredients.  I didn't have green onions on hand so I used red onions.  I only had 2 steaks but didn't change the recipe.  There was plenty of yummy sauce with chunks of sautéed onion and garlic.  It made my kitchen smell like a 5 Star restaurant!

Easy and Delicious.  The only thing I did differently was I used a yellow onion instead of green onions, only because I didn't have any.

I used low sodium soy sauce, and these turned out flavorful and not too salty. I think the green onions get lost in the cooking process--they are completely dissolved into sauce; they still taste OK though. Also, the recipe doesn't state what temperature to cook them at. I basically kept them at medium, and they really only needed about 5-6 minutes on each side and then another 10 to finish up. I may try this again but use regular onions to stand up to the cooking better or just add the green onions later in the cooking process. Maybe the green onions weren't supposed to be chopped... it doesn't say how to cut them. We did have a nice meal with these though-- I served with sweet potato fries and Romaine lettuce salad.

Used half the soy sauce (ran out) and it was plenty seasoned/salted. It may have been too salty with the full amount. Easy, no-fuss recipe. I'll definitely be making again!

We really liked this recipe.  Followed directions except used thinly sliced white onion instead of green onions, and used low-sodium shoyu because that is what was on hand.  I can see how it might be too salty if using regular shoyu, so I would recommend the low-sodium variety.  Served over hapa rice (mixed brown and white) and we devoured it.  I only made two pork steaks but made the whole amount of gravy, and cooked on med-low heat.  I will definitely make this again, super simple and super tasty.

This is how you do it. Don't forget the maulls bbq sauce. Believe me that the vinegar add minimal flavor but cooks the meat tender and juicy.  Anyone from St. Louis would know you don't braise your pork steaks in sauce in the oven. You let the fire die down a little and liberally cover with maulls the last half hour of grilling. This cooks the sauce in and creates a thick layer on the outside.

Awesome! I've made this four or five times now And my family can't get enough! Like another reviewer, I dredged in seasoned flour first. Be sure to watch your liquid or the onions will burn. Half way, I added some cooking sherry. Omg yum!  I also added more garlic and served with garlic mashed potatoes and a green veggie. Simply amazing! Thanks for sharing!

Very good but too salty.  Will use low sodium soy sauce next time.  Used a combination of Maggi, Worcestershire and mostly soy sauce   Also use diced sweet onions, not green

JUST CAME ACROSS THIS RECIPIE TONIGHT, IT WAS VERY GOOD. I ALSO USED 1 SMALL ONION IN PLACE OF GREEN ONIONS CAUSE THATS WHAT I HAD...ALSO ADDED A FEW DASHES OF WORSCHESTER SAUCE AND ADDED ABOUT A TABLE SPOON OF BROWN SUGAR...COOKED UP GREAT...TENDER FLAVORFUL AND I LOVED THE FLAVORED CRISPIES...WELL MAKE AGAIN. I ALSO TAKE KITCHER SHEERS AND CUT THROUGH THE FAT ON THE EDGES TO KEEP IT FROM CURLING UP WHILE COOKING.

Reason why I'm giving this a 5 star is because my husband said,
"These are the best pork steaks I've ever had from you"!
Won't make them any other way from now on!
Also, I made Asian fried rice (Which I got from AllsRecipe) to compliment this yummy soy sauce pork steak.

I promise you! You won't regret it

I LOVE this recipe!  This is the 3rd time I've used it and it is delicious - my husband can't get enough of it.  I use Bragg's liquid aminos instead of soy sauce and a little worchestershire but otherwise this is perfect.  Thanks for contributing this recipe!

Needed a quick week night recipe for pork steaks.  I had bought them because they were on sale but I had never cooked them before except in the crock pot.  This recipe was so fast, and I was happily surprised by how delicious and tender the meat was!  Even my non pork eating heathen liked it!  I will definitely be making this recipe again!

This recipe is awesome. Very easy and fast, just what I needed. Ps do not add salt to the garlic if you are crushing them the soy sauce adds plenty enough. Thank you very much for this delicious recipe, I will definitely try it again. :-)

Great! I did not have the soy sauce but went ahead and made it anyway, as directed. I added  some fresh bell pepper ( green ) and as suggested dredged in flour. The end result was fantastic. This recipe leaves a lot of room to make it your own. I will be keeping this and I will most defiantly make again.

We felt it was too salty.  It may be that its from cooking it in all the soy sauce and I even used low-sodium soy sauce.

I doubled the recipe, dredged the meat in some flour, used 1 sweet onion, added mushrooms, and a little worchestershire sauce. The sauce was a little too salty for our taste, so I added some water. This recipe is definitely a keeper, and for sure I will make it again.  Thankyou

SUPER fast, super easy and super tasty! Great for a weeknight dinner. I took the advice of 2 other reviewers and dredged the pork in flour first. I seasoned the flour with black pepper, garlic powder, cumin and a pinch of cayenne pepper. I thought it was a tad to salty for my taste using the regular soy sauce. I would normally cook with a low sodium soy sauce but, my husband and daughter loved it as is. Awesome recipe!

I also dredged in flour - gluten free flour, browned in a cast iron skillet, added the rest of the ingredients, covered skillet with foil and then baked in a 350 oven for about half an hour.  SO VERY DELICIOUS!

This was just ok.  I wouldn't make it again.  Soy sauce over powering.  Ill stick to grilling and basting them with French dressing or baking them in basic cream of mushroom soup mixture.  Pork steaks are cheap, tender and full of pork flavor.  Love 'em .

Easy to make and really tasty.  Followed the other suggestions of dredging the pork in seasoned flour.  Definitely a winner!

Loved this recipe & how easy it is to make! I added Leeks from the start instead of green onions & mushrooms for the second half & it was delicious! This is definitely part of our regular dinner schedule now!

I could not believe how tender these were! And I used regular onions instead of green, but I will try the original way when I have some fresh green onions from my garden this spring! Thanks! :)

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe. I didn't have any green onions on hand so I used half of a yellow onion. I added a splash of unsweetened apple juice when adding the onion/garlic to prevent it from burning (which was a problem some other reviewers said they'd had).

So This gave me an idea on what to do with my boneless pork steaks. I seasoned the pork in blk pepper,cayenne pepper, garlic pepe and parsley flakes and then lightly covered with flour. Then I cooked them in the pan with the onions and butter with a pour of cooking wine. It was GRRREAAATTTT!!!!!

Not too much of a fan.  Pork steaks are so fatty and this made the pan juices super fatty and the whole dish was just 'pork fat' tasting.

Unbearably salty, so use low sodium soy sauce. We enjoyed this, and it was easy--my husband selected the recipe and made it with no problem. The meat was tender and flavorful. We'll do it again.

My hubby bought a huge family pkg of pork steaks and we cooked a couple on the grill, in the oven and they were tough and I was just about to give up and toss them thinking it was just a bad batch of steaks. I saw this recipe and decided to try it. WOW is all I can say they turned out fabulous! SO SO tender and the combination of the soy sauce, onion and garlic are amazing! Thanks BABYLOVE1222

I made this recipe for dinner last night and it was outstanding. Even my picky eating 3 year olds enjoyed this. I made it according to the recipe (with white onions because I was out of green) and put it over rice. There is absolutely no reason to "tweak" this recipe as others have done, except maybe to dredge the steaks in flour. It'll help with the "gravy", which was really runny and oily, but still yummy.

I love this recipe! I don't change a thing except dredge the steaks (boneless) in flour first. I also have added snow peas or green beans + mushrooms chopped on top of the steaks and loved the way the entire dish came out.

This was a surprisingly delicious and simple recipe. I was so worried that it would be too salty but it really wasn't! Excellent flavor. Like others, I did not have green onions so I used half of a yellow onion and it was great! I also added some fresh ground black pepper! I did not need the 10 minutes of uncovered cooking time. Great recipe and will definitely be making again.

This is delicious! I added a pint of sliced fresh mushrooms w/the garlic & green onions; used low sodium soy sauce; added a pinch of thyme; also  marinated the chops in about 1/4 cup of teriyaki sauce before cooking to give it a little sweetness. Served w/mashed potatoes & green salad. Next time will try dredging the pork steaks in flour.

5 stars for its simlplicity. A quick and tasty meal ready in mere minutes. I used only the ingredients listed but I did brown my chops in the butter first. Removed them and sautéed my garlic in even more butter before adding the soya sauce. Dredged the chops in the sauce while it bubbled scattered the green onion, covered, cooked a few more minutes and, voila. A tasty quick meal that even my finiky eaters had 2nds of! Thanks for posting, baby love

I wanted something simple to make for dinner and this nailed it! It was really flavorful and the meat was still tender after cooking.  The only changes I made was adding a little Worcestershire sauce, some salt and pepper, and a little steak sauce. My husband loved it and said it is added to our menu. We served ours with some brown rice and mixed veggies, kind of like a pork steak bowl.

These were good. I couldn't find pork steaks at my store but bought some pretty big/thin chops that I used and turned out good. The chop was moist and had just enough flavor. Will make again. Simple and easy for a week night meal.

I guess I made this wrong or something.  The meat wasn't awful, but I did burn it a little.  The soy sauce burns easily.  It wasn't fully cooked by the time stated either.  The onions burned too.  I guess I just didn't get the recipe and it wasn't for me.

I usally do not rate anything.  But, this recipe is excellent!  I have made it four times in the last 2 months.  Yesterday I experimented with my pressure cooker and this recipe.  15 Minutes and 1/2 cup more soy sauce.  OMG The meat fell off the bones and the flavors mingled intensely.  Thank you for sharing this with us.  It is a new goto.

I loved this recipe my husband and I had a good time cooking it together and we made it for his parents and they were very impressed! I also coated them in a seasoned flour mixture and it made the soy sauce mixture stick better!

Followed how it was cook. However, I didn't have green onions so what I used are sweet peppers and it added a little kick. Also I added half a lemon. It was delicious. I like mine a little burnt so the heat was at 7 to pan fry it, then added the remaining sauce.

This was great and fun to make!  I used red onion instead of the green onion. I used thin pork chops, it's what I had on hand.  Served it with wild rice and the tangy broccoli.  Hubs thought it was great also!

Used sweet onions, instead of green, more garlic and butter, less soy sauce (all about what you and your family likes). Pork was super moist and had tons of flavor!

This was really delicious, I added kale and mushrooms to the soy sauce/butter mixture and simmered this concoction while the pork was cooked in batches.

I too am not a huge fan of pork steaks, but these were amazing!  I followed the recipe however I substituted raw coconut aminos for the soy sauce.  They were SO tasty and tender!  I am going to follow someone elses idea about making pork fried rice with the leftovers!

I just tried this recipe.  However, because I hadn't grocery shopped in a while, I had to substitute somethings.
Green Onions-----> Onion Flakes
Garlic ----------> Garlic Powder
Other than those two I followed the directions exactly and just ate the most exquisite pork steak ever! I'm sure it would have been better with the called for ingredients, but I don't see how. LOL

I made this recipe in a hurry and it turned out so moist and flavorful even though it was in the marinade liquid for 45 minutes it was just as tasty - my son wants to add this to his rotation of meals!

Great loved the recipe quick and easy. We loved it nice and tender steaks. Next time I think I will try regular onions. Was great over mashed potatoes. Definitely a keeper.By the way  I  used a Jamican thick soy sauce.

Sorry, we just weren't a fan.  WAY too salty. I might try this again with teriyaki instead of soy because the ease of the recipe was great.

I made these tonight and my 13 year old son kept commenting how good they smelled. He mentioned frequently how yummy they were DURING the meal. I followed the recipe except I used regular pork chops instead of steaks. They were delicious. I wouldn't change a thing!

This was a pleasent surprise.  I was skeptical but it turned out amazingly well.  I used a small yellow onion and I dredged my pork steak in seasoned up flour. Hubby really enjoyed his dinner tonight... :)

SO YUMM! I've made this a few times for my boyfriend & he loves it (as do I)!! I did as some other reviewers suggested & dredged the steaks in (wheat) flour first. One of the times, I didn't have green onions, so I just used a yellow onion I had - still so good. I also use "I can't believe it's not butter" instead. We usually pair with the Cheddar Mashed Potatoes from this site or just some grilled asparagus. I've also tried the same idea with beef steak but instead used A1 sauce in replacement of the soy - so good! Great, easy recipe for our softball nights...thanks for sharing! ***UPDATE*** I now make this at least once every other week....made it last night for my parents, my 7 year old sister & 4 year old cousin, & they loved it! Even my little sister who is a PICKY eater (didn't let her see green onions in the sauce). Great, easy weeknight meal for busy families.

Hate to give a less than stellar review but this recipe was very marginal for me.  Was it edible?  Yes it was, but pork steaks/chops deserve the Southern Fried treatment at my house.

This is a great recipe, I wouldn't change a thing except to cook it until the pork is well done instead of medium.  I know it's the "in" way to cook pork now, but I can't stand the taste of undercooked pork.  I love the flavor of butter and soy sauce in cooking, I forget what it's called, but there is a name for it. I also use butter and soy sauce when I cook fresh spinach or baby bok choy.

Awesome flavor, very tender.  Followed directions except that I also dipped in seasoned flour before frying.  It was a fast, delicious meal that had my  guests exclaiming it was the best pork they'd ever had!  Cheap cut of meat and the results were great!  Highly recommend.  Thanks for posting!

Super easy to make and soooooo tastey! I did change the meat to regular steaks because the store didn't have what the recipe calls for, but they still turned out wonderful.

It was sooo easy to make this dish. I used pork loin instead; it was tender and delicious. I pared it with 'Rosemary Rice' that I found on this website. They surprisingly went together and were quite satisfying. This recipe will stay in my family a long time.

I was looking for a different way to cook pork steaks for my hubby when I saw this recipe.  It looked good, simple and fast.  I did modify like "Pete" did and it turned out great!  Husband said the recipe was a keeper!  Thanks to both of you!

This was really good!  I didn't have any green onions so I finely chopped a shallot and it was wonderful.  I can see you much better it would be with green onions and will use them next time for sure!

My husband and I both loved this recipe, but our children, who are not picky eaters, didn't like it at all.  It might have had something to do with the fact that there was soy sauce in the ingredients, and neither one of them are huge Chinese food fans.

These steaks were amazing! I will deffinetly be making this again. The whole famiy loved it. I also substituted regular onions for the green onions and it was still great. I usually only eat pork steaks on the grill because I don't like them any other way, but thanks to  this recipe, I can eat them from a pan as well.

These were OK. It sounded good, but the flavor I was hoping for wasn't there. Might have been the cuts I got though, so still giving this one 4 stars and will probably try it again.

I only changed it a little.  I used garlic powder (quite a bit), since i didnt have fresh.  Maybe next time use the lower sodium soy sauce. My husband eats everything, so the true testers are the kids. Tryed to lick their plates!!!

I am not a huge pork fan so I use chicken instead. I have had it with pork and the chicken is just as tasty! I make a serving of rice to put the chicken and sauce over and it is by far one of my favorite meals! I think my boyfriend will eventually rebel and tell me he won't eat it anymore since I make it almost once a week! Sometimes I double the sauce if I am serving more than two people since my friends like to drizzle it over left-over rice. Yum! Great recipe!

This has become one of our favorite recipes.  So nice to find a quick, wonderful stove top meat recipe that doesn't include flour (which my son can't have).  The juicy gravy is fantastic.  We serve it over brown rice to enjoy all of the juices.  Perfect for week nights.

Wonderful!  I served over jasmine rice with asparagus on the side.  Very oriental, and you can certainly add your favorite fresh veggies into this and just cook until tender.  Hubby & I both loved this!

this is amazingly simple to do & taste equally great... i added onions on top of green onions. personally i would feel that green onions are best eaten raw or as a garnish without sauting.. but either way, the pork still taste good!

I made this for dinner tonight, & my husband, who usually does the cooking, thought it was great. So did I. I think I may have cooked it on too high a temp, because the garlic started to burn. I did flour the meat first, & since I ran out of liquid, I added water. It really turned out great & I would definitely make it again.

I just finished making this one...In the end, it ended up being an entirely different dish, which is nice about this kind of dish.  You can add or take away anything u'd like to it. 

If u like something different, try adding a table spoon or so of minced ginger.  Ginger complements the garlic and the pork really nicely.

This was pretty good, except the sauce kind of burned on the bottom of my pan.  I'm not sure what I did wrong.  It became a bit of a charred mess...so beware of that.  Maybe I should have scooped the onion sauce on top of the steaks while cooking, rather than leaving it in the bottom of the pan.  Still, my husband gave it a 4 out of 5, saying the flavor of the steak was very good!

This had good flavor except it was WAY too salty!  Maybe if it was made with unsalted butter it would have made a difference, but for us it was too salty.  Good underlying flavor though!

I loved this recipe!  The pork steaks were very tender, and full of flavor.  I plan to make these regularly!

The pork was okay.  I didn't find the flavor to be very enjoyable, not that it was bad.  The soy sauce burned onto the pan because of the long cook time which left a punjent smell in my house.

I doubled the garlic and used a lite soy sauce, cooking time was right on, even my finicky 16 year old daughter thought it was great.  Will definitely make again.
