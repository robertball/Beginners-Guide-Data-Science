Since I can't find a place to submit a recipe, I'll add it here.
My green bean saute` uses:
1 can green beans, drained and rinsed
1 Tbsp olive oil
1 Tbsp minced onion
1 Tbsp finely chopped red pepper or pimento (if available, for color)
garlic powder or minced garlic to taste
Salt and pepper to taste

Saute lightly, medium heat, until all flavors are well distributed. Quick and easy and lots of flavor.

Very yummy!  I didnt have red pepper on hand, but it was still good.  I used fresh green beans instead of frozen.

I made this with canned green beans, and it was still very good.  I want to try it with fresh next time.  I did make a few changes:  I sauted 1 can of mushrooms in 1 tbsp of butter until browned, then I added a few sliced onions and 1 can of beans.  I sauted on medium heat until slightly browned, then added the cooked crumbled bacon and 1/2 tsp of fresh garlic.  I did not use any bacon grease to cook the beans.  Thanks for a very good recipe for me to experiment with. :)

I thought these were really good.  The only things I did differently were that I steamed them first, then added them in with the garlic and oil for about 5 min and added the bacon.  I also didn't use the red pepper flakes - didn't have any.  I loved the bacon in them.  Next time I will add more garlic - my husband and I are huge garlic fans!  I will definitely make these again.

Followed the recipe to the note, but it didn't really work for me. Garlic tends to burn quite easily in the last 10 minutes, and really overpowers the taste of the dish. I will try again, but fry the garlic separately and mix it in just before serving.

This was really good.  I only used 5 slices of bacon, mainly because I didn't look at the recipe to see how many to use.  I also couldn't find any frozen whole green beans so I used fresh but blanched them first. Very simple recipe.

I made this for Christmas with absolutely no changes and it was great!  I received compliments right and left! A hint of spice with every bite and when we had leftovers, there was always some on my plate!

This was a good basic recipe. I blanched my fresh beans for 3 min, cooked the bacon and  the chopped onion (like other reviewers suggested) ahead of time. The bacon cut into 1/2 inch pieces fries up more quickly and is perfect for a crumbled consistensy with the beans. Threw everything together with the garlic for final saute just before meal time. I also added about 1/4 cup of good balsalmic vinegar at the end of the saute which made this side even better! 4 stars for basic recipe and 5 stars with the added onion and balsalmic vinegar...Yummm I will serve this again!

This had wonderful flavor and a little heat too. Loved it! I used precooked bacon so there wasn't any grease left to cook with. I added 2 T of unsalted butter to do that with. I used a wax bean/string bean/baby carrot blend and it was so delicious. Thanks Cheryl for a great side dish.

I halved the recipe and used fresh green beans. Turned out great, would make it again. 8-9 minutes was probably long enough, too.

This was very good with a few small tweaks. I decided to add some leftover rotisserie chicken and basil. I also substituted peanut oil for the bacon grease, then drained and tossed with italian dressing... It was a hit with the whole family!

This is such an easy recipe, but very flavorful.  Of course, bacon can only make things better.  I might omit the red pepper flakes next time simply because some people were fearful that it would be too spicy and did not even try it.

Many people don't realize fresh green beans are at their best when fully cooked, not crispy crunchy.  Their sugar is released and they have a better taste.  I made this recipe but cooked the green beans separately, then tossed them with the rest of the prepared ingredients.  Yummy.

Very tasty.  It was similar to the beans you get at any Chinese buffet.  I also sauteed a little diced onion in mine.  My oldest at it without complaining.  The middle kid did so under threat.  So it did pass the kid test...sort of!

Fixed these tonight and all 4 of us loved them. Will definitely fix again, the bacon added a nice flavor to the otherwise plain jane beans we normally have!

I used fresh green beans and steamed them first.  I made with a bit of garlic powder and skipped the Red pepper.   It was good, although I could have cooked the beans a bit more.  Everyone liked it.

Awesome.
Used fresh v. frozen green beans and had rave reviews from all family members. Super easy, flavorful -- I served it with the Pork in Olive oil Marinade (from this site) and cous cous flavored with an olive oil infused with persian lime.  rockin!

I used fresh green beans in a skillet and by the time they were cooked to my liking, the pepper flakes and garlic were a bit crisp.  Regardless, this recipe was scrumptious and I will do it again and maybe slightly nuke or parboil the beans before adding them to the pan.

I've tried this recipe three times and cannot get it to work.  Love all the ingredients, but cannot get them to meld.  I tried the recipe exactly as written.  Beans were still to crisp and the garlic almost burnt.  Tried with fresh green beans with almost the same outcome.  The final time blanched the beans before tossing with the garlic.  That probably worked the best, but the flavors just didn't cut it.

Edible, a little greasy and a tad spicy.  I like spicy but don't care for grease in my vegetables.  I'll try it again sometime and see if I get better results.

Here's how good these beans are.  I put them on the table, turned around to get one more thing, and when I came back, they were gone!  I got one bite off of my daughter's plate, so now I have to make these again.  I did leave out the pepper flakes because we are very wimpy at my house.  We also used fresh beans, just cooked them a little longer.  Thank you, Cheryl!

We really liked these but steaming the green beans first should brighten the flavor a bit.  That said, my husband and I each ate way more of this than we should admit to...

WAY too spicy, and I followed the recipe exactly. Such a disappointment, as I served these beans for a special dinner to guests, and none of us could eat them!

These were a great twist on traditional green beans. I went a little easy on the bacon compared to the original recipe. I only diced three pieces of bacon instead of 10. (that just seemed like a lot once I got started) I also used canned green beans rather than frozen, and I omitted the red pepper flakes. I did add a few spices to the beans a dash of onion powder and chili powder really helped the flavor of the beans. Give these a try, you'll love them!

Wonderful side dish. Added some onions and a tad bit of olive oil to help saute because the bacon used was pretty lean. Used fresh cut green beans and about  1/4 cup of water to help steam cook them in the pan.

I give credit for being a new way to prepare green beans.  It was pretty good.  Not fabulous, but pretty good.  I use nitrate/nitrite-free bacon, which takes some of the scare out of using bacon.

This was so easy to make and my boyfriend, who is a chef, raved and raved about it. Okay, I did what others have done, and replaced the bacon with diced pancetta cause I don't like bacon. It wasn't as greasy as bacon would be so I threw in a tablespoon of extra light olive oil. I am so thrilled with the results and so thrilled that my boyfriend loved it.  Thanks!

Chinese style of this version: Omit the red pepper and bacon - 4 tablespoons of canola oil, throw in the garlic and brown it, add in the french beans, add in abit of water maybe about 7 tablespoons, Add half cup mini or medium sized dry scallops (you can get it in Chinese marts maybe Chinatown?), 2 tablespoons of soysauce (Optional: 2 tablespoon of Hua Tiao Chew) and salt to taste!

I used fresh green beans - big bag from Costco, so I doubled the recipe.  Also, sautéed mushrooms with the garlic.  And because of such a large amount of beans, had to cook about 15-20 minutes on the stovetop.  This recipe was a HIT with the family BBQ!!

Made this for Thanksgiving and it was wonderful.  I followed the receipe exactly but eliminated the red pepper flakes, certain family members aren't fond of them.  I used one 16 oz. bag of whole string beans but didn't crumble all the bacon as it would have been too much.  I couldn't stop picking at the leftovers, LOL Will be making  again.

I used fresh green beans instead of canned and did not use the red pepper flakes. Turned out really good, and I have made it multiple times to go along with my meals. It has been a huge hit every time and would recommend to anyone who has not yet tried, to go ahead and do it! It will be well worth your while.

My hubby liked it, but I felt it lacked something. I didn't have a problem with the garlic burning and it wasn't too spicy for us. I had at least 10 slices of bacon but that was all I could taste which I love. Something was missing to me.

Wonderful.  Everyone loved it.  I put a little bit of water in bottom of pan once I added green beans to  let them steam easier.  Loved the red pepper because I love spicy food but it may be too spicy for some.

Made this for my hubby. He loved it. Said that he could eat just this as a meal. I also added onions sauted with the bacon grease and garlic and crushed pepper flakes. 2 thumbs up!

Our family eats a lot of green beans so this was a nice change to our regular ones. Will make it again (just not often, not so healthy)

It was good.  We used garden fresh beans and blanched them instead of using frozen.
Tasty recipe our kids liked.
