Not too shabby for a quick weeknight dinner. I marinated my steak tips for several hours in Teriyaki, Soy Sauce and Worcestershire and seasoned my veggies with salt, pepper and a bit of garlic powder. I think it might have been a little bland without it, but it was pretty good as I prepared it.

this was delicious. we used kikkoman stir fry sauce and it was very flavorful. I used a little more meat and sauce than required but it was amazing!

This was fine. It was a very quick meal so it would be a good one for folks on the go. I used thinly sliced tri tip steaks, Yoshidas teriyaki sauce and my own steamed jasmine rice. This is more like a teriyaki with vegetables mixed in and not the traditional beef broccoli. The sweeter flavor may help you get some vegis in your kidlets too.

This was good for a quick weeknight meal.  I did make my own white rice and used Soyaki sauce from TJ's.  I didn't have beef so used chicken.  Taste was not bad at all but I much prefer fresh veggies over frozen in stir fries.

My husband and I really liked this. It's a good base to start with. I made it pretty much as written, except I added some garlic salt & pepper to the meat, as it was browning. I doubled the stir fry veggies (bought 2 bags) and added a jar of mushrooms at the end, along with the sauce. We served with brown rice and some crunchy chow mein noodles on top. My husband raved about it the whole time he was eating it. We will definitely eat this often.

This worked very well a a quickly thrown together meal, definitely nice recipe to have around when running short on time. I did let the meat sit in soy sauce and sriracha for a couple of hours before cooking. Ground fresh black pepper over meat while cooking.  Served over drained ramen noodles because my daughter begs for them :-)

Not a bad meal for the family. Ease of having a frozen selection of veggies already prepped and in the freezer, ready to go. It was rather quick, easy and ready in no time to fuss over. I've never bought stir-fry sauce and have made it myself in the past, so the ease of taking that step out, made it a lot quicker for me. I had to use the whole grain brown rice steamer pouch due to the availability of what the grocery stores offered. However, it was a decent recipe, totally on the fly...and quicker then making a hamburger helper. It was light and fresh. TY will make again

This was OK. Not bad, but nothing to write home about. I used seasoned, pre-cooked chicken along with 1/2lb of sirloin. The chicken and broccoli were the best parts. The steak definitely needed more flavor and some of the other veggies were a bit limp for our liking.
