I had some ricotta cheese left over from  baked ziti that I made a few days ago so I made this without a crust. This is comfort food. I will make it again. I also shaved chocolate on top for those that wanted it.

Used amaretto liquor (a bit too much) and cheated with the crust, but overall, it was very good.

I varied it a bit...like previous reviewer, I did not use a crust.  Instead, I used about 1/2c skim ricotta with 1/2c reg ricotta, 1 egg, 6 tbsp sugar, and a dash of whiskey and placed in 2 ramekins.  I cooked them at 370 for 20 minutes. Turned out pretty well - probably will try 15 minutes next time and more sugar.  I will also try more ricotta (to make 4 servings) as I think the whole egg for 2 servings was a bit much.    All in all, it tastes good but needs some tweaking!

This is an excellent quick and easy dessert pie. I added an extra egg and used Kaluha instead of whiskey. I'm thinking of trying it with Bailey's Irish cream next time and maybe another with Rum and a 1/4 cup of almonds. That's what makes this recipe great is you can do so many different variations with it.

Wow.  I added an extra egg and used half ricotta and half cottage cheese (both of which needed using up from my fridge), and a mix of vanilla & lemon juice instead of whiskey.  I also put sliced almonds on top instead of lattice crust.  It turned out like a light fluffy version of cheesecake.  And not super-sweet.  Next time I'll add a tad of ground cardamom for fun.  I sense a savory version of this coming up in my future!

This pie was very good, but needed more sugar.  I incresed the sugar to 1/2 cup
instead of 6 tbs and when cooled, dusted the top with confectioners sugar.

So easy! For the amount of effort, it sure was delicious. I soaked some strawberries and pineapples in whiskey to put on top. Great for Easter!

Fantastic and easy!  Just don't care for the piecrust part of it. The filling is great and easy - light and cheesecakey!  I'll do this one again - I'm sure it's great on it's own w/out a crust - but I'm getting talked into a pecan/graham cracker crust for next time.

This was definately a disappointment. Neede more sugar, and a little flavor, maybe vanilla. Top crust looked pretty but wasn't necessary.

So quick, simple, and easy!  Looks and tastes like hours worth of work when it's really 10 minutes plus one hour baking.  Love it!  Taking it to my brother's for Easter tomorrow. Thanks.
