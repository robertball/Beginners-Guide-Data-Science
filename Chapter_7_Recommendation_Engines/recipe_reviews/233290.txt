Delicious! Definitely a must try if you like either hot dogs, Philly cheesesteaks, or BOTH! I've made them exactly as directed, and I was not disappointed. My friends and I enjoyed every delicious bite! I had been wondering if it would taste any different if you added the hot dog between the steak and cheese. Success! Now, I must try it with peppers! JOY!
