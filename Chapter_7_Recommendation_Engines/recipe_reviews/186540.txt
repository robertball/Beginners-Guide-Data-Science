Not bad!  As much as I LOVE tomatoes, I generally don't care for tomato-based soups, but the thought of apples sounded fun, so I thought I'd try this.  I used a Granny Smith.  I ended up adding the whole apple, extra carrots, & only 1/2 of the tomatoes.  I also like a bit of crunch in my veggies (and fruits, in this case!) so I left out some of the carrots & apples until just before pouring everying in the blender.  Will definitely be making this again.  Thanks!

The flavors were delicious! I think the apple added a nice sweetness to the soup. The pureed texture was not my favorite. My husband gave it a 3 based on the texture. It is a "refined" soup so to speak. My 9 month old and 2 1/2 year old loved it! I knew going into it that chunks would be nice, but I wanted an easy meal to feed my little boys. It worked out nicely and I would definitely make it again!

Delicious! I used water instead of vegetable broth and topped with mozzarella cheese.  We had no leftovers!

Really, really good! For the people who are complaining about the texture being over-blended just don't blend it as much, or reserve some chunks to add in later. I have a stick mixer and this really was no work at all. I served ours with the Crusty French Bread recipe by Deanna and it was delicious. The only thing I did was use the whole apple, triple the basil (fresh) and top with crumbled cotija cheese. Thanks for the great soup idea!

Just okay. I thought the apple flavour would be more evident. In the end it just seemed like more work for a soup that was just okay.

I used chicken stock and a whole apple.  I love how the carrots and apple enhance the tomato flavor.  This went together very quickly and made an excellent warm lunch on a cold, blustery day.  I did garnish with a bit of grated Montery Jack, which worked well.  This will be a repeat feature on our winter menu.

I followed the original recipe with these exceptions. I used an entire apple, 4 oz can of tomato paste and chose to not blend ingredients. About 20 minutes prior to serving, I added 1/4 cup of cream sherry. The soup was thick, chunky, and delicious. I'll definitely make this again.

This needs more apples. As it is, there is not a taste of the apples in the soup, which I would have liked.
