My family loves this recipe!!  The only thing  I do differently is to add 2-3 cans more of chicken broth, otherwise it is extremely pasty.  It is pretty spicey but you can adjust that as well to your own tastes.  It's easy and makes enough to freeze for later use.

I have been using this recipe since I found it on allrecipes.com a couple of years ago.  This is a wonderful recipe by itself or used as a base. In the numerous times I have made this, I have added tomato sauce, extra garlic, and shrimp.  My only suggestion, is if you have a tough time cooking the rice without making it sticky (a problem I always have), cook the rice separately and add it to the other simmered ingredients when it is done.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was great! After getting everything cut up, it was really easy to put together, and it was so yummy! I made just a few changes. I added about one and a half cans of diced tomatoes. I also used half green onions and half white onions. And I added about a tablespoon of cajun seasoning. It turned out great. I'll definitely make this again!

WooooWheee Dat's Goot!  Very Excellent/Accurate Base  Some minor changes after trying it the original way the first time.  First off, add a can of Rotel Tomatoes with Chili's, and cut back on cayenne pepper just a tad  to make up for it.  Cut back the Broth To 1.5 Cups and cook your Rice separately using chicken broth/shrimp broth or both, lastly and imo most important, add, 2lbs of shrimp to the pot just as you take it off the heat, give it a stir, put the lid on it and turn the heat off,  (This will guarantee your shrimp turn out perfectly cooked and not rubbery.) Stir once or or twice every 2-3 minutes and and after 5 minutes have passed stir in your cooked rice and let set  5 minutes so the rice can soak up all them flavors,  Now taste, and adjust seasoning.  If your going to err,  do so on the side of mildness, people can always add a bit more hot sauce or creole seasoning.  NOTE: Cajun food is not about heat, it's about great robust flavors. Yes, it usually has a little kick to it, but rarely a bite.  I'm sick of people throwing in a ton of cayenne and calling something Cajun.  It's Not!  A GREAT RECIPE and had tons of flavor, I let mine cook about twice what suggested though before throwing in the rice as I really wanted to let them flavors meld. I also took the tails and shells of the shrimp and boiled them and used the stock to make rice along with the chicken stock, I got rave reviews.  I thought I was N.O. again.  Laissez les bons temps rouler! 
Pass the Beer!

Delicious and just the right amount of heat! I added a 14 1/2 oz. can of diced tomatoes, and used 1 1/2 tsp. of Tony Chachere's creole seasoning in place of salt & pepper. Omitted hot sauce as I don't like it too spicy. For my first time, this turned out to be fabulous...didn't use celery and it turned out just great! My fiancee went back for seconds, something he's only done a handful of times in 6 1/2 years. So that's really saying something! I hope this is as good the next day, this makes a ton of food, too much for just two people. I will be making this again for sure!

This is a great jambalaya base...to this recipe I added a can of drained red beans and a can of diced tomatoes w/green chiles.  I also added more cayenne pepper because we like it hot!  I'll definitley make it again!

Although not jambalaya fans, this recipe was pretty good for us.  We skipped the green pepper & celery, but added some ground thyme, as well as increasing amounts of worcestershire & hot sauce.  This is very much a rice dish, so as long as you like rice you should be fine.  When reheating you definitely need to add more chicken broth or it would be too pasty.

Easy, good and inexpensive to make.  I used to live in New Orleans, and actually prefer this recipe to the jamba's I had down there.

Honestly the only thing "cajun" about this is the cayenne & hot sauce.  I made this dish for my bible study group in NEW ORLEANS, my first time ever making jambalaya - and it wasn't until I was half way through that I realized this looked nothing like real jambalaya because of no tomatoes...but I continued on anyway and ended up with basically a chicken & sausage rice dish (I used andouille).  As many of the others said, the rice turned out mushy so I would suggest cooking it separately also.  This overall taste was good, nobobdy complained and some had compliments but I was just a little embarrassed to call it jambalaya ;-)

I feel like I found a family treasure with this simple recipe. I am giving it 5 stars for "overall terrific recipe". No, it may not be authentic Jambalaya... "yall". And it isn't gourmet... but it uses ingredients that I usually have on hand, is very quick and easy to put together, it's not too spicy or too many ingredients that kids wouldn't like,  AND it made my small amounts of meats go far enough to feed an army! Taste is VERY good as is, and it would be very easy to impart your personal tastes to it (ie: spicy: add cayenne or... love garlic:add more garlic or... love lots of flavor: add worstershire etc... or love veggies:add different veggies). Again, I feel like I found a treasure with this easy, delicious, inexpensive and flexible recipe. Thank you, for sharing!

First, I am from South Louisiana, about 10 minutes from the coast, and I DO know good Cajun food.  This caught my eye because there was no tomatoes in it. I combined this with Bubba's Jambalaya from this sight.  First I used cast iron skillets to cook the meat, which will give it a blackened look and taste to it.  I cooked maple pepper bacon, (6 strips) crumpled it up, drained the grease.  Then I cooked a link of sliced hot sausage in the same pot.  I cubed a turkey ham (boneless) because it looked like the rice would be a lot and we have meat lovers around here.  I followed the recipe except for adding 1 tsp. cayenne, 1 tsp paprika, and ommitted the salt and pepper and used Tony Cachere's Creole Seasoning (a staple in South Louisiana)  If you can't get Tony's, Slap Ya Mama is a great second .  I probably used a good 2 tablespoons of Tony's shaking it in the pot before the rice was to cook.  I also used brown rice because that is healthier.

I've tried a few different jambalaya recipes before but they never turned out that good. This however was really good! I added one can of diced tomatoes and a tsp of sugar. The result was a really flavorful, spicy sweet jambalaya. On it's own I think it would be 4 star but my additions made it 5..yum!

Rinse your rice thoroughly before adding to keep it from becoming pasty, or, cook it seperately, (after rinsing first,) and add at end, then, simmer a little longer to get some of the stock flavor into rice.

That was very good. I made it 3 times differently. First, I followed the recipe without making any alterations. It was good but the next time I cooked rice separately and it was better. The third time I added 14 oz diced tomatoes and 1 1/2 tbsp creole seasoning instead of salt and pepper and it turned out great. It is so quick and easy! Thank you very much for the recipe!!!

Made this last week and it was P.D. Tasty!  Made Jambalaya Burritos out of the leftovers and they were even better! 

Followed the general recipe but used 3 Chicken Breasts, 16oz of Kielbasa, and about 1lb of med/large Shrimp as we like our meats ;).  Also added 1 pint of canned Tomatoes from my garden.

For seasonings, I used about 1-1/2 Tablebspoons of the following great, make-it-yourself Creole Seasoning recipe I found on the Net.

Creole Seasoning

2 tablespoon Kosher salt (you may use less salt, folks in south-east Louisiana are notorious salt fiends)
2 tablespoons black pepper
2 tablespoons dried onion
1 tablespoon paprika
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon cayenne
1/2 teaspoon chili powder
1/4 teaspoon dried thyme 
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano

I can't imagine jambalaya without shrimp and a tomato based sauce, so I added a half pound of shrimp and a can of diced tomatoes.  Ahhhhhh....  Also substituted brown rice and turkey sausage to be on the healthy side.  I cooked the rice separately in chicken broth and then added it to the gamesh at the end.  I substituted cajun seasoning for hot sauce, and it was just right.  One suggestion if you're going to have leftovers: add a healthy splash of chicken broth and that teaspoon of hot sauce right before you put it in the fridge.  The heat and moisture continue to be absorbed by the rice, so these adjustments will kick start your leftovers for perfection.

Delicious and much better than the box mixes available. Doubled the onion by personal preference, and per reviews, added 1 can kidney beans, 1 can diced tomatoes, and 1 tsp Old Bay seasoning. I cooked the (brown) rice separately and added it to simmer for 30 min. I used 2 cans chicken broth and thought it was rather liquidy, but simmering with the top off for 30 min with the added rice thickened up the jambalaya nicely. Crusty bread and hot sauce, and you've got a delicious meal in no time!

This was the easiest, yummiest jambalaya I have ever had! Since my husband doesn't like food that is very spicy, he loved this version and I just added some hot sauce to mine for the "kick". Also, I've discovered that adding a can of diced tomatoes and some shrimp really make this recipe GREAT!

Easy Cajun Jambalaya Haiku: "Holy cow, this rocked. I made several small changes, but still, man, so good!" I dumped everything in the crockpot on low b4 work in the a.m. (less chick stock, no rice), and we served it w/ rice at dinnertime. I also added about 1 TB of AR's awesome "Creole Seasoning Blend", but the heart of the recipe remained the same. Husband enthusiastically proclaimed it a "keeper" after 1 bite, and I couldn't agree more. Fan.Tas.Tic.

My family loves this recipe! I add 2-14 oz cans diced tomatoes, green onions if I have them, and 1 Ilbs shrimp. This recipe does lack a few key ingredients that a true cajun flavor has so you can either purchase the ready made seasoning and add it (prob about 1 TBLS) or add the missing spices to round out your Jambalaya. Missing Ingredients: Garlic Powder, Chili Powder, Thyme and Sweet Basil. You'll need to play around with the measurements as I have not taken the time to do it myself. Good luck and happy eating!

I loved this recipe, this was my first attempt at Jambalaya w/o a box start and it turned out great!! Everyone loved it, I did add shrimp to it and just cooked the rice separately all together. The rice was not mixed in until plates were made, so NO problems w/ soggy rice! Will definitely make again. After you chop up everything it's pretty simple from there...

My kids hate anything spicy but did tolerate this.  My husband and I enjoyed it a lot.  I made two changes: I mixed in a can of black beans with the rice after cooking, and kept the rice/bean mixture separate, using the chicken and sausage mixture over the top.  We like to have control over how much meat or rice each of us gets.  I liked it that way.

Very easy and super delicious!  It was not spicy at all.  Perfect for families with small children.  I put some Tony's Creole seasoning on the table and some hot sauce, too.  That way people could spice it up to their tastes.

This is fine, although I added many things other reviewers suggested as well.  Old Bay, more garlic, 2 cans of diced tomatoes, 4 cups chicken stock... there was WAY too much rice it's like a casserole.  Could use less rice or more liquid.  Also cooked rice in advance still could use more liquid.  Also after it was done, added the other half of the kilbasa and REALLY needed more chicken I used 3 breasts initially.  Not sure I would make again.  Although easy enough for a weeknight. Unless you want to feed an army I'd cut it in half.  I have a large dutch oven full of "jambalaya".

Made as is, loved as is.

I did cook sausage and chicken separately, concerned both would overcrowd the pan and not brown.  Sausage first and then chicken.

Just to sample it with tomatoes, in a saucepan, added diced tomatoes to a small portion of the finished product.  Brought to a simmer.  Didn't care for it at all.

If I'd change anything in the future, it'd be the addition of shrimp, because my boyfriend exclaimed "WHAT'S JAMBALAYA WITHOUT SHRIMP?!"... and then proceeded to eat 3 servings.  Haha  ...and took a heaping container of leftovers for lunch today.

Great recipe!  Bonus:  One pot, less mess!

I LOVE this recipe!  I make this every year for Fat Tuesday... perfect as written but I add a can of red beans and a can of kidney beans and I leave out the Worcestershire, hot sauce and cayenne pepper and substitute with "Slap Ya Mama" Cajun seasoning.  Delicious and always turns out...Thanks for sharing!

This was easy and yummy! I used whatever I had on hand for meats ie; 1 small ham steak, 1 chopped chicken breast, 1# sweet Italian sausage and 1/4 lb hot smoked sausage. Then followed the advice and added the 14  oz can of diced tomatoes , Cajun seasoning instead of salt and pepper, and chipotle Tabasco ( my new favorite hot sauce!) , oh and brown rice. I only had fresh bay leaves, so I used those, and celery seed just because it felt New Orleans~y... It was FANTASTIC! Thanks so much for sharing !

Tried this recipe for the first time. Quite tasty!

I added some mushrooms and shrimps (I have so much that I don't know what to do with them), skipped celery (too late to make a 2nd trip to the store), and used steamed rice..didn't mix as it would get sticky (I'm Asian, rice expert).

This was a 4 or 4 1/2 star recipe. I follow the directions exactly, and while it was finishing cooking I realized, "This doesn't have any color." Having never made jambalaya before I didn't realize that it is supposed to have tomato something in it. Well, I added a 6oz. can of tomato paste, and tinkered around with the spices (personal preference) and it was AMAZING!! Adding that can of tomato paste brought it up to a 5 star recipe.

Super easy and full of flavor! I added a small can of tomato sauce and used turkey sausage (already cooked), and brown rice instead. It was still delicious and i was amazed how much flavor i was able to cook up in such a short amount of time. I cooked the rice in a rice cooker while the veggies were cooking and then added it at the end with the bay leaves, tomato sauce, hot sauce, and Worcestershire sauce. if you are looking for a quick and easy but exciting recipe, try this one!

I have already reviewed this once, but I wanted to add that I use zattarians (sp?) jambalaya rice mild and original mix.  One box of each.  Rather than plain white rice.

Love this recipe! We add shrimp to make it a three meat masterpiece. I often find 4 cups of chicken stock is a bit much. Three cups also works. I also leave the hot pepper sauce out and make it available at the dinner table so the kids can eat it too without it being too spicy. This is a family favorite. Oh, and we use turkey kielbasa which is delicious and healthy.

Pretty good.  I followed some of this recipe and a Johnsonville's Sausage recipe I found while clipping coupons.  Seems pretty tasty following both recipes.  I did cook my rice separate from other items.  I wish I had some chicken or shrimp to add but next time.  I made beans and rice on side anyway for meals later in the week.  I am going to make something with sweet potatoes to offset the spice of the jambalaya and beans.

This recipe is really good! I also added a can of diced tomatos with chilis. Be careful doing this as it can make the rice seize up and not get totally soft. Be sure to add this after the rice is mostly already cooked!

The jambalaya had a nice amount of spice, and generally I liked the taste, but even though I increased the amount of the meats, I still thought there was too much rice.

I used lower-fat turkey smoked sausage, and agree that it definitely needed more liquid as it tends to be pastey.  Otherwise good flavor.

This tastes soooo good! I loved it..I made a few changes after reading other reviews, I added a can of diced tomates with green chilis (drained) and made the rice separate and added it added it at the end so it wouldn't be gooey or sticky...other than that I followed the recipe and it was fantastic!

I added/changed some things, which made it 5-star: added one can of fire-roasted diced tomatoes and added some shrimp, as well as a bit of dried thyme and oregano. Without these things I think it would have been lacking a bit in flavor.  I also used andouille sausage instead of kielbasa. . It was my first time making jambalaya and my husband said it was one of his favorites!

Very good! My picky 6 year old son ate off his plate and mine! I used a spicy Conecuh sausage and Tony Chachere in place of the other spices. Also added an undrained can of diced tomatoes and a tad more rice since it seemed like alot of liquid. I didn't have Worcestershire sauce, I wonder what difference adding this makes?

This turned out so good! We've never had jambalaya before and we were pleasantly surprised. I'm only giving this 4 stars because I did make some modifications that I read from other reviewers. I added 1 can italian stewed tomatoes w/ juice, cajun seasoning instead of cayenne pepper (I didn't have cayenne), low fat smoked sausage, and about a handfull of medium shrimp (added at the last 10 min.) It took about 1 hr 15 min. for preping and cook time though...A little longer than I was prepared for. I will absolutely make this again!

I am a big fan of Cajun cooking! I bet that I made this a half a dozen times. Every time I made this it was different every time. Great base like a blank canvas. Very easy and I would recommend to anyone.

THIS RECIPE WAS SO SIMPLE. THE ONLY THING I DID DIFFERENT WAS I ADD A LITTLE KITCHEN BOUQUET AT THE END JUST TO GIVE IT MORE OF A BROWN COLOR. THIS IS MOSTLY USE AS A THICKENING AGENT, AND DOESN’T REALLY HAVE ANY FLAVOR TO IT. SO IT WORKED PERFECT. I DOUBLED THE RECIPE AND MADE IT FOR A FAMILY REUNION. EVERYONE IS STILL CALLING ME ABOUT THIS RECIPE. EVERYONE SAYS THAT I AM A GREAT COOK BUT I AM MY WORST CRITIC, BUT I HAVE NO NEGATIVE THINGS TO SAY ABOUT THIS. I ATE IT FOR 4 DAYS STRAIGHT AND IM STILL WANT MORE.

This was pretty good. I added a 15 oz can of plain tomato sauce and about half a cup of extra rice. Though I am not a huge jambalaya fan, my husband seemed to like it.

OH YEAH!  Great recipe!  I added a can of diced tomatoes, which I would definitely recommend.  I used chicken garlic sausage and also free-range chicken, and it was wonderful.  For the rice, I used Texmati, which cooks in about 20 minutes, perfect for this recipe.  Do not use Minute Rice!  And don't even think about skipping the bay leaves - they add a delicious flavor to the mix.

VERY GOOD!  My husband and I loved this very much!
I added an extra cup of chicken broth, a cup (or so) of crushed tomatoes and about 2 dozen large shrimp.  I also added a little more cayenne pepper and a few tablespoons of this Garlic Hot Sauce that I have...It was Awesome!
THANKS!

This was a great recipe. I thought it was a little colorless so I added an 8 oz. can of tomato sauce which made all the difference. Thanks for a great recipe.

This was really good! My husband is always asking me to make Jumbalaya, but I really don't want to fuss with the preparation of the shrimp.  This was perfect for us!  I added more spices and garlic, as well as cut the keilbasa into larger pieces.  It was great!

ok.....YUM!!!!!  I married into a family from Baton Rouge, and learned how to make Jambalaya from my sister in law.  This version is my new favorite!  Just a few things different from the one I usually make, but they make SUCH a difference in the outcome..really flavorful, not just "hot", and just as easy.  Thanks for this great recipe, Grant!

My husband and I loved this recipe.  I did cook the rice separate and used brown rice, used 1tbsp of homemade Cajun seasoning and a 24oz can of diced tomatoes so I cut back the chicken stock to 2 cups. Oh, and added about 2 cups shrimp, it was so wonderful ??

Great, easy recipe! I add shrimp and use a cajun spiced sausage as well as the chicken. I omit the bay leaf. It's a very adaptable recipe and I have used it many times.

I've made this dish several times over the past couple years, I've tweeked it a little to fit our taste.  I cook the rice separately  in the rice cooker with a couple bay leaves(we use brown rice). I also use anaheim chili pepper instead of the bell pepper because I don't care for bell pepper.  Oh & I always add more meat & creole seasonings. Family loves it, so do I!  Leftovers taste great too.

Made this as is except for adding a can of diced tomatoes and omitted the hot sauce at the end. Perfect spice. Not overwhelming but a nice authentic flavor with the perfect kick. A favorite with every person here, all 8 of us.

I have no idea if this is authentic (how is it I've never tried jambalaya before?!) but it sure is delicious.  I added a can of tomatoes as suggested by others.  Perfect amount of heat and the texture was great (no issues with pasty/sticky rice; I used jasmine rice).  Definitely going into the regular rotation!

My husband is Cajun and I find it hard to please him with some recipes I have tried.  This one NAILED it!  Easy to prepare and very flavorful.  If you want more heat, I suggest more Tabasco.  Otherwise, for those of us who like flavor, but not the heat, this is perfect as is!  Thank you for sharing!  This is now a go- to recipe for me!

I was looking for a recipe to use up some cooked rice I had leftover and a package of kielbasa. Had never eaten jambalaya before and wasn't sure I'd like it very well. I was very pleasantly surprised! Our food budget was extremely tight, so I omitted the shrimp and chicken and added another bell pepper (and some diced green chiles). Couldn't get over how awesome this tasted! Will definitely be making this again, and probably very soon. Next time I will do as others suggested and add a can of diced tomatoes with chiles. Can't wait to taste it with shrimp in it!

Wow this was so good!  I used 1 tb Tony Chacheres creole seasoning in place of the salt and pepper and omitted the hot sauce (the kids).  I only used turkey kielbasa as that is all I had on hand.  I cooked the rice (brown rice) separate and added near the end.  I also added a can of red beans and rotel tomatoes.  Turned out too spicy for the kids but the adults loved it.  Will def make again and again.

This is an easy and very flavourful jambalaya.. It would be a great base for many versions of this classic dish. We added the cayenne, some 'Cajun garlic' we had bought in Charleston, SC at the market, and liberally splashed tobasco all over it. There was a bit of heat, actually a nice bit of heat!  I think tomatoes would add to this, otherwise, it's perfect. I couldn't believe all that flavour came from a few basic ingredients.  Again, I think recipes need to be adaptable to the cook's tastes and moods. This recipe fits the bill!

Very good recipe, I did a little different things, I used a red ( purple ) onion, whichever word you prefer and a red bell pepper. And I used a pure beef sausage. Other than that, I did it all as written. My mother wasn't crazy about the use of Worcestesshire sauce, she said it made it "weird". Mothers!
Oh yea, I used brown rice.

Added cooked rice seperately and it really helped.  It had a great slow heat that my husband loved!  I added a can of diced tomatoes and some shrimp.  Very good Jambalaya for my first time making it.

A total hit with my family including 6,7, and 8 year olds.  I used chipotle chili pepper instead of cayenne pepper, red instead of green pepper, and added corn and peas. I also used my food processor to mince onion and a cup of spinach (to sneak it some more vegetables). We used the hot sauce on the side to add more heat for only those who wanted to. Will definitely make this again.

Love this recipe! This is the 2nd time I'm making it in 3 weeks. Had to tone down the pepper for my family, and left out the Worcestershire sauce. Used a really nice quality chicken andouille sausage for this and it added a lot. I also grind some black pepper in because I think it adds a lot. Had some fresh thyme this week and so added a few sprigs with the chicken - I'll take it out at the end.
It's funny that so many people comment that it has too much rice - I guess we're just rice lovers, because we were glad we finally had a recipe with enough rice!
When you don't add as much hot sauce, the flavor of whatever sausage you use really comes through, so pick something that has a good flavor.
this is definitely a go-to recipe for mid-week! and I love all the leftovers - it's enough for a 2nd meal.

I had to make a huge pot of jambalaya for a fundraiser today. I used this recipe and was shocked at how good it turned out. I did alter with using instant rice. For every 1 cup of liquid, use 1 cup of instant rice. Mix it in at the same moment u mix it in according to the recipe. Turned out PERFECT!

Made this for the second time last night; it's perfect for those who cannot eat tomatoes. It makes enough to feed a family of 4 twice! I made the rice separately (using chicken broth) and I used a whole carton of chicken stock in the jambalaya; let it cook down a little bit, and the rice was still perfect. I doubled the celery and sausage, using half boudain and half kielbasa, and I also added a cubed yellow squash, fresh mushrooms, and a cubed small zucchini to add some veggies to this one-dish meal. Even though I forgot to add the last 2 ingredients, the family still enjoyed it; hubs had seconds. Served with large biscuits. I have now deleted the other jambalaya recipes from my recipe box, and this is the only one I'll use. Thanks for the post, Grant Michel!

made as is, except added the Worcestershire sauce to the chicken stock and added another cup of broth. for those that have sticky rice issues, i learned long ago rinsing the rice until the water is clear(2 or 3 times) before you cook it removes the starch that makes it sticky, doesn't change the taste.

This recipe is really great.  I went with other reviewers' advice and added a can of diced tomatoes.  I opted to skip the chicken and used 14 extra large shrimp which I added after cooking time and let steam up, stirring after 2 minutes, another 3 minutes, and another 5 minutes (10 minutes total elapsed time).  I substituted turkey kielbasa.  I also used brown rice so my cooking time was 40 minutes.  I'm confident that this is a 5 star recipe based on the flavor of the dish, despite the changes I made.

Followed the recipe exactly but did add a can of tomatoes and cut the recipe in half because it is only my hubby and me. I also had to cut back on the cayenne and hot pepper sauce because my husband can't take spicy food. I did douse mine with a generous portion of hot sauce. This was very good. My only complaint was that the rice was a bit mushy, but that is probably my fault because I added the tomatoes. Good, cheap and filling.

Never made Jambalaya before and used this recipe with some of the recommendations (add shrimp & tomatoes) and it was AWESOME!

This was a good "kitchen sink" recipe. I used what I had on hand to throw into the jambalaya. I used chicken, but not kielbasa. I used only 1/2 an onion and 1/2 a green bell pepper. I omitted the celery. I used Sriracha as my hot sauce. Overall, the dish was okay. The leftovers weren't eaten, which tells me a lot. Very filling, though! I think next time I will add a can of diced tomatoes.

My family loved this recipe!  I did make the addition of adding Shrimp, and a dash of Tony Chachere's Cajun Seasoning.  Also, if you are looking for the best hot pepper sauce, I recommed Franks Red Hot Sauce.

This was really easy to make and tasted great.  I will definitely only use 1 1/2 cups of rice next time, this recipe calls for way too much rice.

Really similar to the one I make--same proportions of  rice, broth, and approx. veggies, which I love dicing very small.  To spice it, I use a heaping tsp of ground thyme and cayenne ( I use the olive oil here--but more like 1 tbsp), a tbsp of garlic while sauteing the chicken, and then I also I add about a quarter cup of sweet vermouth and one bay leaf, but next time I make it, I'll try putting in 3. No worchestershire sauce for me. Perfect with a Manhattan.  I have this on hand in my freezer ALL the time.  It freezes great, so I freeze it in little containers and thaw the night before taking it to work.  For work, I drop the Manhattan.

This is great for an average dinner with your family.  My husband said it came out well.  I followed the recipe except I took reviewers suggestion and cooked the rice separately.  I also used brown rice, shrimp and turkey Kielbasa because I prefer that for health reasons.

If you use shrimp cook them separately and add them at the end.  I made a rookie mistake and added them in early on and they got a little chewy. 

I thought it could have used a little more heat but I like a lot of spice, next time I would add a little more hot sauce or some red child pepper flakes.

I liked this recipe.  Instead of celery I put in a can of green chiles, and a little basil and oregano to spice up flavor.  I doubled the recipe and had too much left over.  It was better the second time but too mushy to freeze.  Next time I'll make just one recipe.

This recipe is ok.  I used andouille sausage instead of keilbasa.  I thought the chicken was pretty bland.  You need to add a lot of salt.  I also added tomato sauce for some flavor.  I also did not have any bay leaves so that may be why it lacked some flavor.

This is quite good!  I used turkey smoked sausage and left out the chicken (only because I didn't have any).  I also used brown rice, but that doubles the cook time, and added more liquid (probably 1/4 cup).  I like tomatoes in jambalaya so I threw in a can of diced tomatoes.  Excellent recipe!  Thanks!

I followed the recipe exactly and by the time the rice was done, it was a gooey, pasty mess.  I had to add Cajun flavoring to even make it presentable.  My normally "likes everything" husband gave it a big thumbs down.

This recipe is perfect as is. More characteristic of southwestern and south-central Louisiana, is Cajun jambalaya, which contains no tomatoes. Creole jambalaya uses tomatoes.

This was a big hit at my house last night.  And so easy to assemble, too.  I took the advice of some prior reviewers and modified it just a bit.  I added a can of diced tomatoes, and used 1lb. of lite kielbasa and 1 lb of chicken tenders, cut bite sized.  I used a big box *and* a 14 oz. can of chicken stock.  I also probably tripled the garlic, because I love it so.  Yummy.

This was a real good dinner.  I used a fill pound of sausage and pretty good sized chicken breasts, so it was nice and meaty.  Rice cooked up very moist.  I think I would like more vegatables in in next time.

I make this all the time and everyone loves it.  I even made it for my fiance's family.  And since it was the first meal that I made for them, I was a little nervous but all of them loved it.  I try not to make it too spicy but that's hard since I love spicy foods.  Depending on what I have in the pantry, I use brown or white rice.  Both are good but the brown has to cook a little longer.

This recipe is delicious. I added Southwestern dry rub to the chicken breast to give it some flavor and I also added a 14 oz. can of diced and peeled tomatoes.  I used turkey kielbasa instead of Andouille sausage and it still tasted great.

This was a great and simple jambalaya. I used shrimp instead of chicken and omitted the hot sauce. I also added some Andouille sausage. It came out perfect.

This is by far the best jambalaya recipe I've found. I did change it a bit though. I used a small pinch of the ceyenne pepper because I don't do spicy foods. I used 1Tablespoon Tony Chacherie's cajun seasoning because it wasn't flavorful enough for my taste. When all was said & done, it was great. Will make again & again.

This is very good and so easy to make!  I ended up doubling the amount of kielbasa, just so I could use up the whole package and we didn't mind it being more meaty.  I also added a can of diced tomatoes and some carrots for extra color.  My 2 1/2 year old son will even eat this!

This was great. I halved the recipe (since there was just two of us) and used turkey kielbasa and a leftover (cooked) porkchop from the night before instead of chicken, and some tofu.  I left out the celery (because I don't like it) and doubled the amount of bell pepper instead. I threw everything in the crock pot and added a can of chopped tomatoes with some of the liquid drained for 3.5 hours. Easy, spicy, delicious. Will make again! Thanks!

This was good. I added a can of crushed tomatoes which added to the flavor and color.  I prepared this dish too early and the end product turned to paste, the vegetables wilted.  I added water and that depasted the rice.

My husband is a "born and raised" cajun from southwest Louisiana, and he LOVES this dish!  It is one of the few things he has asked me to make week after week.  My 10 year old son enjoys it as well.  A tip for the sticky rice problem some people have mentioned - use parboiled rice.  It is a little more expensive than regular rice, but does not clump.

I'm really glad we tried this recipe for Fat Tuesday! All the ingredients were readily at hand, it was incredibly easy to fix, and it had a depth of flavor that I didn't expect!! I was especially surprised at the smokiness that the kielbasa brings. Also, the author is modest about the heat. It's not scorching, but it does warm your mouth considerably.

I wasn't bowled over with this one as I had expected to be.  My main complaint:  way too much rice.  (In fact I also take exception to the "serves 6" notation -- it was more like 10 at my house!)  I would have given it three stars, except 1) it was better the next day after the flavors had time to meld, and 2) my 14-month-old really really liked it!  I think I'll keep looking for a better-proportioned recipe, maybe one with some tomato in it.

I LOVED this! As did my family! I added Creole and Cajun seasonings as well as the seasonings it asked for in the recipe. I served this with my sweet corn bread. I also added double amounts of both meats...and a can of diced tomatoes drained. It was fabulous and will definately make this again as it was quick and EASY!!!!!

This is the recipe I always turn to for a "starting point".  It is really tasty as-is, but it's also great to "experiment" with the ingredients.  In the several times I've made this I've added fresh hot peppers, red peppers, roma tomatoes, shallots, spicy sausage, and more.  I've made this dish even when it's just me at home- the leftovers freeze very well and re-heating this dish at work makes my lunch the envy of my co-workers. 
Whether you're a new to jambalaya and want an easy recipe to try it, or a vetran cook who likes to experiment w/ ingredients, this recipes is sure to please.

This was very tasty. I added a can of diced tomatoes w/chilies. Didn't have any bay leaves but it turned out well anyway. Also I cooked the rice by itself until it was halfway done and then added it to the chicken/sausage mixture. Excellent!

Tasty. Having never had jambalaya before, I wasn't sure what to expect. This was easy to make, and had a nice taste. I usually can't handle foods that are very spicy, and the level of heat was just right. I used half the onion called for, as my husband doesn't really care for it. Didn't make any changes other than that. Thanks for the recipe!

pretty good recipe, except I added 16 oz kielbasa instead of 8 oz, and glad I did! A little colorless, so maybe use red pepper instead of green.

We found this recipe to be very bland.  The rice didn't cook well; I think the rice should be cooked individually first and then added.  My kids picked the meat out and said that it had lost its flavor.  We found something else to eat for dinner that night and threw the rest of this out.

I have used this recipe a lot. I prepare it as written, but I sometimes put a little more peppers, onions, and celery. It’s delicious and my son gets so excited when I tell him that’s what we’re having for dinner. Thank you for a great recipe!

A great base recipe. next time I'll only add 3/4 cup of rice. Too much rice, the final result was just rice with stuff cooked inside it. not really a stew or soup

I will say that I have only had jamblaya once before, so I am no expert on this. I read several reviews before making this. This is the changes I made to it. I made rice separate as others suggested. I used only 3 cups broth after mixing altogether. I used one can of diced tomatoes. I used half green onions and yellow onions. I did add a good extra actual Cajun seasoning as well. It turned out so very good. I have no doubt that I will do this one many more times.

I made this for someone who doesn't like spicy things.  This seemed much less spicy than most other recipes and it went over well (I added some tabasco to my dish!).

I added a red pepper and a can of diced tomatoes because I like more of a reddish broth. I also added shrimp and made a seafood stock from the shrimp shells, green onion and garlic.  Just throw the shrimp in about five minutes before you take it off simmer.  Very easy recipe to spice up or spice down.

This recipe is definitely not Cajun and it's definitely not jambalaya, but I guess it wasn't bad. It was missing something, though. Overall, this recipe received an 'okay' rating at my house. 

I made mostly as directed. I cut back on the garlic by half, because 2 tablespoons was WOO HA too much. I also used some leftover hot Italian sausage links (to try and replicate Andouille, which I didn't have) instead of kielbasa, because in no way, shape, or form does kielbasa belong in Cajun cooking. =) I also left out the hot sauce at the end, because my teen son has NO tolerance for heat (the cayenne gave it just enough kick for me and hubby). Those were the only changes. 

I didn't realize until everything was simmering away that there were no tomatoes in the recipe! As written, I don't think I'd bother making this again. Not very much flavor for a bunch of ingredients. I WOULD, though, try it again using some added tomato sauce or a can of crushed tomatoes, or maybe a can of Rotel. I really think it would be excellent with just one or two more ingredients for one more layer of flavor.

Good base recipe - I used andouille sausage instead of kielbasa and added diced smoked ham (tasso). I also added a can of Rotel diced tomatoes for color and more kick.  Cajun seasoning to taste and my South Louisiana friends would have been proud of me!

Lifesaver! I made this last night for five friends and it turned out great. I don't know much about cooking and definitely don't know much about cajun cooking, but even I could follow this recipe, and it was delicious! Thanks for posting.

Fantastic!The hardest part of this was just dicing everything, literally that easy to make. I personally prefer things on the spicy side so I diced up a dozen Cayennes and added that in. Also my local store didn't have andouille or kielbasa so I used Italian sausage which was good also. Overall great recipe.

Really good recipe - I read a number of reviews and settled on the following modifications....followed it all but added in a 14.5 oz can of diced toms with green chile, 1 can of rinsed and drained dark red kidney beans and about a 1/2 TBSP of Cajun seasoning. It was superb. Will definitely be making again as an easy/quick one pot spin up!

Too thick and gluteny.
I have tried many different recipes and have found if you use basmati rice instead of normal long grain rice the dish is lighter, healthier and above all tastier.  The rice doesn't stick together in one big mushy lump as its basmati which has less gluten content. For a more traditional jambalaya you need to add 1 x chorizo sausage cut into bite size pieces, 1 whole chilli & 5 to 6 pieces of garlic minced in a crusher, 8 x mushrooms, 2 x celery stalks, 1 x red onion, 1 x red pepper, 1 x green pepper and 1 x yellow pepper.  You also need 1 can of chopped tomatoes and preferably several cups of dry white wine along with a good chicken stock for the rice to absorb, homemade stock is even better.  Once you have fried the vegetables right at the beginning you then need to add in the rice and fry for 2 mins so the rice absorbs all the flavour otherwise putting it in at the end is a bit pointless really. Then add in 1 x bay leaf why you ask??? I don't know ha ha but everyone puts one in so why not though I don't feel it adds anything to the dish anyway.  Keep stirring is the trick with this dish otherwise it will stick on the bottom.  Best utensil to use is a large wok as the heat penetrates better than a normal saucepan.  Treat this dish exactly like a risotto and you won't go wrong!!!

I really liked this recipe!  It was super fast, easy steps, and convenient ingredients we can all find in the pantry.  Two little complaints:  It was pretty bland as is, therefore once it was doctored up with Louisiana Hot Sauce & Tony's it was much better!  And - using white chicken pieces (breast meat) is just too dry.  It would have been much improved if it were dark meat (maybe thighs).  Maybe even a shredded rotisserie chicken would have been better.  Otherwise - a definite winner, and will repeat in my house!

Oh man this was a great recipie. I normally don't like Jambalaya but this one had just the right amount of spicy for me and the hubby. I used Siracha garlic pepper paste for my hot pepper sauce and next time I will take out a serving for my daughter before I stir in the last ingredients. Thanks for this great share!

Made this tonight for supper and it was an instant hit! The kids and my husband agreed that it needs a place in the recipe file. I did make some slight changes. First I added a tad bit more cayenne pepper and a 1/2 tsp of Cajun seasoning. About 5 minutes before it was done I added 12oz of precooked medium shrimp. I did end up adding more broth to help keep it slightly loose. The only thing I will do differently next time is to par-boil the rice and add it part way into the cooking time. While perhaps not the truest jambalaya with the omission of tomatoes we did not mind as I am allergic to them.

I love this dish and so does my family. Just the right amount of spice. Nothing too hot. I did leave out the celery and bay leaves. I also added 1 can of diced tomatoes. By making sure I use the same brands everytime I make it, the taste stays consistent! My father says this is the best thing I've ever made and loves it!

I used red, orange and yellow bell peppers since I don't care for green.  Added a can of diced tomatoes and a can of kidney beans.  I also added a heaping tablespoon of Cajun seasoning, as I felt it was needing a little extra something.  Turned out to be a hit at my Mardis Gras dinner party with crusty bread and crab cakes with mixed greens.

This wasn't terrible but I don't think I'll be making it again. The flavors were good but weird. I added a d can of diced tomatoes & used shrimp in place of chicken per other reviewers suggestions & also added a can of red kidney beans (need more fiber & iron in my diet)

Love this easy recipe! I add an extra Green Pepper and extra celery along with a diced medium onion instead of onion powder to give the meal a bit more substance. And I also use a local butchers Andouiee sausage to get a bit more heat but still this is a great recipe and always goes fast around here!

Great recipe!! Finally one that doesnt call for tomatoes!!! I come from southwest Louisiana. Creole jambalaya has tomatoes, cajun does not. I prefer the cajun version, as do all in my family. I also like to use  cheap cuts of pork in place or in addition to the chicken. And any kind of smoked sausage works well. yum yum!

This was so easy to make and tasted good too!  I left out the bell pepper and celery and added a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles.  I also added a teaspoon and a half of Creole Seasoning and an additional two cups of chicken broth.  I might try a different jambalaya recipe next time though this one was good.

I took a risk making this as my wife and youngest daughter are not into spicy food. I reduced the tabasco by 1/2, added some cajun seasoning to make up for it, and they loved it! 

The second time I made it, i realized towards the end I was out of rice, so I served it over pasta bow ties and added cooked shrimp at the end (not while cooking as they get rubbery)  What a FANTASTIC recipe! This is one of those recipes where you never have to worry about leftovers!   

Thanks Grant for a real winner

Added a can of tomatoes and green chilis as suggested by others. Gave it a nice color and zing, plus the acidic tomatoes complement the cayanne reaaly well. Will definitely make again.

Great tailgating dish!  This was a big hit with my friends tailgating at the Steeler game.  I cut the vegetables the night before.  Grilled the kielbasa and chicken in the parking lot.  Then put in a pot on the side burner.  Followed the recipe for the everything else and it turned out excellent!

My wife loved it so much, I made it at home the next day.

I used less rice and added tomato juice. It was really good. My family doesn't appreciate overly spicy foods and found this really delicious

Modified this recipe, but it was great.. I added carrots and crushed tomatoes, and omitted celery since I forgot to buy it.. Hubby liked it, but wanted celery in it next time!

Very good for a "quick and easy" version.  The only difference is that only used half the chicken and threw in some fresh shrimp in the last few minutes of cooking

Excellent and simple. I made this once and loved it. I thought it could use a little more heat so I added a haberno pepper. and a little more pepper sauce (I recommend Cholulu sauce, very tasty. While at the grocery store buying ingredients I thought "what the hey" and added some shrimp and mushrooms. Leftovers stay great and microwave up wonderfully for lunch.
Good food!

This made for a really tasty dish for Fat Tuesday.  I substituted shrimp for the chicken and andouille sausage for the kielbasa, which I think is a must for authentic New Orleans cookin'.  It was very yummy!

really good filling meal!I did leave out the celery b/c I happen not to have any and only used one tbsp of chopped garlic and used onion salt instead of onion powder b/c I didn't have any of that either and it was great! I will probably leave out the green peppers next time and add more chicken! it was very flavorful and will be preparing it for the family again! The hubby loved it!

Great recipe! Instead of white rice I used spanish rice made by Knorr... I cooked it separate. The spanish rice added the tomato flavor with out the chunks it also added and extra hint of bell pepper.

I left out the hot sauce, and it was still a bit spicy for my scandinavian taste buds, but this is by far the best recipe I have found on allrecipes.com.

I added chili powder and fiesta mix from Tastefully Simple instead of cajun powder.  Also, I mixed the rice with both brown and white.  It was so delicious.  It didn't take long at all!!

We love this recipe, but have done some customizing to it also.  To cut the heat for our little ones I added sour cream to theirs.  It makes it creamy and they love it!  We did add tomatoes and shrimp to it too, plus sometimes we also add cubed Gold Yukon potatoes with a bit more chicken stock.  Our large family devours it every time!

One day my husband requested that I make some jambalaya, thinking we had some of that boxed stuff. I didn't know he thought we had some, I thought he was requesting a homemade dish. I came on here and found this. Looked simple enough and I knew my hubby would be happy to get what he asked for. I made this dish. And now I am no longer "allowed" to make the boxed jambalaya! Simply amazing and easy to make. I make changes here or there, but this is a great recipe as-is, too. Thank you!!

I had never made jambalaya before and not only was this recipe easy, but the taste is completely awesome! I followed the recipe to a T and then incorporated the advice of some of the other reviewers and made the following changes for a completely fantastic meal:  *added 1 lb of shrimp (threw it in to the pot to cook when I added the chopped veggies so it didn't get too hard) *used 3 tbsp of chopped garlic *used 1 tsp of all the spices (and then some) *used 2 8oz can of tomato sauce and 2 cups of chkn broth (instead of the 4 cups of broth) *used 3 tsp of worcestershire. EVERYTHING ELSE I kept the same - as it states on the original recipe. I LOVE THIS MEAL!

First, I want to say that I am definitely a beginner when it comes to cooking but this dish was easy and delicious.  I do not agree, however, that it is a "cajun" jambalaya. Though the cajun seasoning definitely made the recipe. I am a true cajun, born and raised. This wasn't anything close to authentic cajun jambalaya but still worth cooking when you are looking for something quick and easy.  However, I would not use as much chicken stock as it calls far (not sure if that was the exact problem). I thought it was a little to "gooey" or oily and I automatically thought it might be the chicken stock. I even used 3 cups instead of 4 and it was still too much.

Really good and easy weeknight meal for the family.  I add a can of diced tomatoes and serve with extra hot sauce on the table so that my hubby can add as much as he wants and our toddler and I can still eat it.  Excellent the next day for lunch too (sometimes I will sprinkle with a little bit of cheese for the next day).

Simply the best! I did make just a few minor changes, but really tried to make this just as written.  I used Andouille sausage instead of kielbasa... just more Cajun!  I added only 2 cups chicken broth since I made the 2cups uncooked rice separately in my steam.  I also added can of diced tomatoes just 'cause I love 'em!  My wife said it was the best thing I have ever made!  WOW!  The taste explosion in your mouth can't be beat!!!

Awesome!  We really enjoyed this jambalaya! Great flavor with that taste you only get from good jambalaya.  I did miss having shrimp in there, so i'll prob add that next time.  I did add about 2/3rds of a 28oz can of diced tomato, i think that is a must with this recipe.  & with that you should maybe scale back on the chicken stock a tad, maybe 3 cups b/c of all the juice from tomatos.  But other than that, i give this recipe 5 stars all day long.  The prep work is the hardest part.  After that its pure jambalaya goodness.

very tasty.  I added a few things like shrimp sauteed in butter, white wine, creole seasoning and 2 tsp of sugar.  I added the shrimp and the sauce to the finished jambalaya and it made it very tasty.  Also added creole seasoning while cooking and a can of diced tomatoes pureed in the food processor.  This was so quick and easy and tastes like a lot of effort went into it.  The creole seasoning gave it a great zip.  My kids loved it.

Easy and so yummy! The hubby and I like things spicy so I added 1/2 a jalapeno also and it was fabulous! We also used Turkey Kielbasa to cut down on the fat. Thanks for a great recipe!

I used 1 lb of chorizo sausage and no chicken, used vegie stock and added 1 28 ounce can of tomatoes and 1 can of water the rice really sucks up the fluid, left out hot sauce as my son doesn't like but my husband added to his.

Very good.  Flavorful with just the right amount of spice.  My only complaint was that some of the rice did not fully cook.  I don't know if it needed more broth or if I should have stirred it while it was simmering.  Maybe both?

Excellent and very simple.  I did a few of the steps in a different manner just because of my old habits. (& because I roughly doubled the recipe)  I always like to brown rice in a bit of oil so to accomodate this old habit, I did actually use an extra pan for browning and seasoning the chicken & sausage.  In a bigger pot, I set to browning the rice in a bit of olive oil.  Once it got the nice smell & color, I added in the "trinity" (onions/peppers/celery) & cooked those until tender.  THEN I dumped everything into the big pot and watched it simmer beautifully. :)

This was super easy and super good!  I took another reviewer's advice and cooked my rice seperately.  I had brown rice so I wasn't sure about the cooking time.  I used shrimp instead of chicken and I added some canned jalapenos.  Since I added the jalapenos, I didn't add any more heat with the cayenne or hot sauce.  It was awesome the night I made it and the leftovers I'm munching on now are even better today.  Great recipe!

I don't feel I can give this 5 stars because I didn't follow this recipe exactly (no chicken, used diced/frozen veggies, precooked rice, half the chicken broth) but it was still amazing! I will make this again!

I've never had homemade Jambalaya.  I always make it from the box, so this recipe was a little different than I expected; and IT WAS FANTASTIC!  I didn't have any chicken, so I just used kielbasa.  This recipe will definately be made again!

This turned out amazing.  Now, I did use shrimp instead of chicken & also replaced all the other spices w/Zatarain's Creole Seasoning (I did add just a bit of salt).  Those were the changes I made, and it turned out so great.  My husband & my 11 year old daughter ate it up.  Oh, since I did have my daughter I had Louisiana hot sauce on the side (just added a bit before it hit the table and we could add more).  Wonderful.

So good. I used chicken broth instead of stock because that's what I had and I omitted the bay leaves and hot sauce because I didn't have any. It was still very tasty. Hubby and I enjoyed it very much.

Very good.  Whole family loved this.  I altered the seasonings however and used a Cajun seasoning.  Because of the kids I skimped a little and it turned out a little bland.  I need to try again and follow the recipe as written on the seasonings.  Everyone still loved it.

I'm not a big rice lover so I didn't enjoy this dish as much as my husband and son did.  They loved it and I think I'll probably be getting requests for this one again.  I used red peppers instead of green (I find green peppers to be bitter) and I added half a pound of raw shrimp during the last five minutes of cooking. I will definitely add more cayenne pepper the next time around.  Thanks!

I made this recipe exactly as the directions said to, and it was so delicious!  AND...bonus...it is safe for my toddler to eat, he has dairy & egg allergies.  He had three helpings, he loved it.  I wonder...does this freeze well?

This was the very first time I've tried Jambalya from scratch! Coming from the south I love my Cajun food. Now that I live in Scotland its hard to come by. My brother in law has never had it before. He had two large helping and took the leftovers home!! I added two large spoonfulls from a can of diced tomatoes with chillis and a packet of extra large prawns. The taste was beautiful. Thank you very very much for this recipe! I will use it this one time and time again!!!!!

Mmmmmmmm! This is pretty darn satisfying. I held to the recipe pretty closely except I used Italian sausage instead of kielbasa and added shrimp too. I recommend it.

My husband absolutely loved this recipe.  He is not a fan of tomatoes and was thrilled to find a recipe without them.  I am not a fan of spicy items and this had a little kick but was still tolerable.  I added shrimp and loved the taste of that in the recipe.  I will try turkey sausage and brown rice to make it a little healthier next time.  Thanks!

It WAS an easy recipe but it came out too "doughy". I think it was too much rice but not enough meat. The flavor was okay, just felt like it needed something...

This was some of the best jambalaya I've ever had. I loved that it didn't contain tomatoes, the right way to make it! I didn't add the hot pepper sauce because the cayenne was enough spice for us. I also used italian sausage since thats what I had at the house, turned out wonderful.

Great recipe. I only changed a few things. I used soysage (yummy for vegetarians and no chicken. I also have small children who don't like anything spicy so I ommitted the cayenne and hot pepper sauce. I had no celery either. Even omitting and changing half the ingredients in this recipe it still turned out so delish. This is great no matter what you use!! I served it with homeade cornbread from this site. Will make again!!!!

I'm loving you  for this jambalaya recipe without tomatoes. I am from Louisiana and the only time I have seen tomatoes in jambalaya, it was made by someone from somewhere else.  Very authentic, except for the keilbasa.  I subbed smoked pork sausage for a true Louisiana classic taste.  Thanks again!

Not quite what I was looking for, but definitely not terrible.  Relatively quick to make, and uses a minimum of pots and pans if you are quick with a knife (don't have to take time to prep all of your ingredients before you start cooking).

If you are looking for something similar in flavor to (but better than) Zatarains, this is not it.  I used chicken and Andouille sausage, and tomatoes...  I don't know what flavor was missing, but it just wasn't right.

Luv, luv, luv it.  Made a few changes though.  Instead of using oil, I crisped 6 slices of bacon, removed them from the pan, cooked the veggies and meat in the bacon fat and then added the crumbled bacon at the end.  I didn't have enough chicken stock, so I used half chicken stock half beef stock.  I like my jambalaya with a little tomato flavor (what can I say?  I'm from Connecticut, not the bayou!), so after adding the rice and before adding the stock, I added in a couple of tablespoons of tomato paste.  All in all, excellent and will make again (and again, and again...).

This is a very easy and quick  one pot meal to prepare.  As written is it very good and has a great taste.  We like our food very spicy so we had to add alot of extra spice and jazzed it up with a bit of creole seasoning.

This meal has become a favorite in our family. It is very kid friendly and mild. For those who like a little kick, just keep a bottle of tabasco handy. We often add 1/2 lb cooked shrimp to the pot just before putting the lid on

I made some adjustments based on our preferences (we like our Cajun food HOT) and this came out perfectly. I substituted andouille for the kielbasa, added some of my homemade cajun seasoning, went nuts with the cayenne and black pepper, and much like everything else I cook, doubled the garlic. Absolute perfection - it tasted like we were in the French Quarter again. Thank you so much for this recipe!

Made this for my husband and he really enjoyed it, however next time a may cut back a little on the hot sauce/cayenne, it was a liitle too spicy for us.

I thought this was delicious.  I made it for a group this summer, and people raved about it.  I am not a Jambalaya fanatic, so I don't now how it compares to others.  It's not as good the next day, so don't make too many leftovers.

What a kickin' recipe!  I replace the chicken breast with precooked turkey breast from my local deli, and just shread it off the bone.  I also add a chopped carrot for extra color.  What a GREAT recipe!  Very tasty!

Excellent and not difficult, however it took me about an hour to complete the meal (rather than 45 mins).  We will definitely be making this again!

This was the first time I make Jambalaya and now I love it. Okay for all those bay leaf fans, don't get upset, but I didn't use any. Not because I didn't want to but because I didn't have any on hand. Anyways I used smoked sausage which gave the food an awsome smokey flavor and I used Frank's Red Hot Sauce. This dish was the best. Even my picky 3 yr old ate all her food. We had this for 3 days straight it was soooo good. Thanks for the recipe! Btw, it is good without the bay leaf, I promise!

I had serious doubts about this recipe but for how easy it is to prepare it is absolutely amazing.  I added 2 cans of diced tomatoes with chiles to the soup mix and I made the rice separately using 2 cups of the chicken broth.  I then served the soup over the rice.

Tasty meal and it serves a lot!  It is a bit time consuming to cut all of the veggies/meats but its very easy to make.  We like it a little spicier so we went heavy on the cayenne and hot sauce.  I also used brown rice and it came out great, thanks!

I have never made jambalaya before but this was actually pretty easy to make.  It took a bit longer to make than what it says but it was worth the wait.  I did make it spicier than what it calls for but it ended up being so good! I am already planing on making this recipe again.

This recipe is great.  I doubled the recipe and added tomatoes.  I  took 1/2 and added more chicken broth and some okra and made gumbo soup.  Both were delicious.

i LOVED this recipe, and so did our guests and my family. I felt there could have been more flavor added to it, but it was still great. Also, instead of white rice, i used brown and it came out just fine. thankyou!

This was terrific!! I was leary about making this as we had never had it before, and I am not really fond of sausage. Am I ever glad I tried it!
I made enough for two meals so the first night we had it on rice and hubby couldn't get enough. The next night it was on fettucine and we both agreed that it was better on rice. I didn't even attempt to get my picky eater to try it, but I might next time. I added cajun spice and shrimp like other reviewers posted and copied everything else exact. We are going camping this weekend and I plan to make it for the trip. I can't wait.

My husband loved it ~ he even had seconds!  I followed the recommendation of other reviewers and added a can of diced tomatoes.  At the last minute I decided not to add the hot pepper sauce and it still had a nice kick.  I cooked the rice separately as was suggested and served the Jambalaya over it.  YUM......Thanks Grant

Everyone that I have served this to has loved it.  I fix cornbread with it and there's nothing left on anyone's plates!!!  The only thing I did differently is added more of the meats the second time around, but it is absolutely delicious.

I added a red bell pepper, 1 can of diced tomatoes and used brown rice instead of white. I was a little disappointed with the flavor - found it to be bland. However, this dish improved with age and the following day the reheated leftovers were great. I'll make it again as a make-ahead meal.

This recipe was great!  The whole house smelled like the South.  The best part is it's easy to kick up the flavor by just adding some more worcestershire sauce or hot sauce in the end.  Great one!

Per other reviewers suggestions, we added 1 can of diced tomatoes. Also added 1 small bag of frozen, cooked shrimp. We like spicy, so we doubled the cayenne pepper, added some cajun seasonng, added 1/2 of a small can of diced jalapenos, and doubled the hot sauce. Delicious- will make again.

This was a delicious dinner that was fairly easy to make. I substituted turkey sausage for the kielbasa, but I'm sure kielbasa would have come out great as well. I should have taken the advice of other reviewers and added some kind of canned tomato to this. I will next time.

We had this for dinner tonight, and we thought it was great. I used frozen, diced green peppers because I realized I was out of fresh ones, and they held up wonderfully. I also added a can of tomato sauce, just because I like the color and flavor it adds. Cooked the rice separately, all I had was minute rice and I was afraid it would get mushy in the pot with the rest of the stuff. Not too spicy, crucial because we have a toddler who eats table food. :-)

I loved it! I changed the recipe to suit our tastes and it turned out great. I used 2 small bay leaves, 4 tsp of hot sauce and 1 1/2 tsp of cayenne. I didn't have the sausage, celery, or the rice as it turned out. I replaced these items with ground beef, celery salt, and fetticine noodles. By then it wasn't really like Jambalaya but more like speghetti. Best speghetti I've ever made! Thanks!

This was good but I had to doctor it up and ended up using my usual recipe. Used Emeril's Kicked Up Smoked Sausage.

I tried the recipe tonight! Not Bad! I have never had Jambalaya before.. I think next time I will kick up the heat a little bit :) Also, I cooked the rice separately and added it at the end.. and I didn't have fresh peppers or onion, I used some frozen red/yellow/green peppers and onions that came in a bag (it was what I had on hand). I might use a little less chicken stock next time too... but Thank you for the recipe! I did enjoy it :D

Delicious!  Easy to make.  I also added 1 can of diced tomatoes and shrimp, b/c that is how I remember jambalaya to have.  Would definitely make again - oh, I spiced it up a little to accomodate my husband and I.

The whole family loves this.  My husband likes it enough to make it regularly.  He spices it up and I spice it down...but everyone always eats it.  Never any leftovers in our house.

Made this for lunch and the results were pretty tasty. It isn't my favorite Jambalaya recipe but it is quick and easy. We love Kielbasa but I think shrimp may have worked better had I used that instead. But then again, I can't really identify exactly what it is about this recipe that we didn't like or that I would change for next time but it is lightly spiced (perfect for my boyfriend) and overall "pretty good." I may try this again.  Overall = a 4-star recipe Grant!  Thanks.

This was a great basic recipe to start with for my first time! We followed it step by step but also adding what our family likes. Our first addition was adding Portuguese linguisa with the rest of the meat. We then added a can of diced tomatoes after the veggies and seasoning. We allowed the onions to translucent before adding rice and chicken stock with bay leaves like stated but added the chicken stock slowly as the the rice cooked in the remaining grease from meat! We cooked shrimp in a different pot with other hot spices and vinegar to add to the main dish for those who like it spicy.

Excellent recipe.  I used andouille sausage in place of the kielbasa cuz I had no kielbasa.  Also added shrimp at the end as I always do. (I’ve made jambalaya quite a few times before).  I also cooked the rice separately.  Each recipe I’ve tried prior is a bit different in ingredients and taste but I must say, this is as good as any jambalaya I ate when vacationing in New Orleans!  I will definitely be using this easy recipe again!

Very easy and pretty tasty.  I forgot to add the diced tomatoes as mentioned by one reviewer,  I think that would have made a difference.  You definitely need to add way more flavor, extra onion powder, garlic powder, salt pepper, Cajun seasoning etc.  People will need to taste test and season according to your liking.  Great recipe.  Oh....and I also added shrimp.  Next time I will try to add spinach as well.

It was not bad if you follow the recipe I am sure. We changed it up a little and used red and yellow bell peppers instead to add color and a little different flavor.

I stuck with the original recipe but did add a can of diced tomatoes with peppers and a half cup of mushrooms. 
The beauty of jambalaya is that you can toss in just about anything that strikes your fancy.  A great recipe when you’re pressed for time but have a hungry horde to feed.

I love Louisiana cuisine! This recipe is simple yet full of flavor. I did tweak a few ingredients and added  a touch of Creole to this recipe. I do cook my rice separately as not to end up with mush, just add it about 10 min before you serve to allow the rice to soak up the juices and flavors.

This recipe makes a very tasty Jambalaya in general. I substituted 12 oz shrimp for the chicken, and used 14 oz of kielbasa. I recommend using 4-1/2 to 5 cups of chicken stock because the rice will use all of it before becoming tender. Add the shrimp with the last two ingredients and cook 5 minutes longer.

Jambalaya calls for tomatoes, so I added a can of fire-roasted tomatoes.  I also added 1 lb large shelled shrimp.  With a few minor adjustments, it turned out to be a good jambalaya.  The tweaked recipe is a keeper.  We're having this today!

This was super easy to make and my husband even ate it when he was sick.  I add a little more hot sauce than called for and more celery and peppers to make the rice to everything else ratio a little less.

Tried this tonight, stayed true to the recipe (except I let people pepper sauce to their liking, cuz I'm a wimp.) It was a hit with everyone, from the 8 year old all the way up to dad! We are definitely adding this to our rotation!

I found this to be exactly what I was looking for.  I needed a recipe with low heat for my first attempt at Jambalaya.  The changes I made:  I used Hillshire Farms smoked andouille sausage instead of kielbasa.  It has a mild heat.  I added two tablespoons of tomato paste to give it more of the red color. At the end of the cooking, I added a pound of shrimp and continued to cook it until the shrimp were just opaque.   I served it with a baguette and a side of sour cream (especially for my daughter-in-law who cannot take very much heat in her food).  I found the heat to be very acceptable and this is now one of my favorite recipes which I plan on making again.

I added a can of diced tomatoes and cajun seasoning based on other reviews. Glad I did as it made it taste a lot better than what it would've been.

This recipe is amazing!!!  It is so quick and easy.  I usually make it with sausage, chicken thighs and shrimp.  I also use brown rice instead of white rice.  I think it helps it keep some body and texture.  It is also very easy to spice up to your desired level.  I have made this several times and it is always a hit with the whole family (including a 6 y/o and 3y/o).  I have even had requests to make this for get togethers with friends!!

Never made jambalaya before, but I desperately needed new ideas for dinner. I noted the lack of spice in this recipe, so I just looked up Cajun seasoning recipes. About 1 tsp per spice. Everything else I kept the same. Keep in mind the spice recipe I used gave the jumbalaya a good kick.

I was really afraid of trying to make Jambalaya.  But, I did using this recipe and it was awesome!  I read the reviews and did a couple of recommended modifications to be sure it wasn't too spicy, the rice wasn't gummy and the shrimp weren't overcooked!  This is my go to recipe for Jambalaya now.

Too much rice for the other ingredients. Next time I will greatly reduce the quantity of rice.  But without the rice the dish had a good flavor.

Made it as is, I agree not enough water for the rice, but easily fixed. Not your standard jambalaya recipe. Needed more cajun style ingredients like thyme but if you want a different twist on jambalaya this could work.

This is delicious.  I used hot sausage and chicken and that gave it a pretty hefty kick.  Next time kielbasa.  This one is a keeper!

I'm giving this 4 stars.  Not bad, but A Lot of rice.  If I do make this again (which is a strong possibility later in life), I will make the rice seperate.  The rice cooked fine, just was much more than my family likes.   And we Like rice.
I didn't add the hot sauce (cause I don't do spicy at all).  But without that "something" I found it bland.  So maybe next time I'll get some mild chilies to put in it.

I have made this dish multiple times and it is always a hit...but I make a few tweaks, I use 6 cloves garlic (chopped), 2 tsp. Cajun seasoning, and extra 1/2 c. chopped celery, 2 (14.5 oz.) cans diced tomatoes, with liquid and add 1/2 lb. shrimp just as it boils before I put the lid on. It always comes out amazing! Good luck!

I think this is very solid recipe, for a quick Jambalaya! I had to  substitute Old Bay seasoning for the bay leaves  in the recipe (not by choice but because it's what I had). I also added a little extra chicken broth as another reviewer suggested. I think this is very good, for the time invested. Will definitely make again, thank you for the recipe.

This took me about an hour, so I wouldn't really consider it "easy".  But, it turned out AMAZING without having to do any adjustments to the recipe.  It still has kick, but is milder than traditional jambalaya.  That combined with the freshness made this a winner for me.  Thoroughly enjoyed!

I made this recipe for dinner tonight.  It was really good.  Really, really good.  My husband cleaned his plate.  The kids didn't touch it, but that's normal around here.  lol.  It was spicy and flavorful.  The ONLY change I made was to add 1/2 can tomato purée and another cup of chicken stock because the rice was still crunchy.  I will definitely make this again.

This was a nice, simple recipe that was easy to make in about an hour.  It is a great starter if your family is only just getting into spicier dishes and it doesn't take much to amp it up.  Very happy with this and I will be making it many times over.

We loved it.  It was not too hot for my picky husband.  I followed the recipe exactly.  My only mistake was that I should have adjusted the  servings.  It made a huge amount.  I enough to share with my adult son.  He liked it so much he asked if I had any more left.

This was delicious and a huge hit with my little family. I added some Cajun seasoning as well as creole red beans (creamy style). I always go heavy on the garlic too. It was fantastic! I'll definitely be making it again.

I added diced tomatoes, shrimp and used andouille sausage, also made rice separate using half of the broth and other half in the pot.

I made this. It was fantastic. I did make a couple changes to the recipe. I like it spicy, so I did this:

1. 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne. (Doubled the amount)
2. Added 1/4th of Tony's creole seasoning
3. Was generous with the salt and pepper.

All in all, a great recipe. thank you to the person that shared!

My family said this needs to be a staple meal around here. It was awesome! I did less hot sauce than it called for because of the kids and then my husband and I put extra on ours on our plates. I love how easy this was. Especially since I already had diced peppers and onions in the freezer from a meal the week before. I also used plain rice that was left over from a meal a few days before. I cut down the chicken broth by about 1 1/2 cups because of it. Easy and tasty! Thanks for the great recipe!

My kids and I loved this!  I made a few changes.  I used butter instead of olive oil, omitted the chicken and substituted shrimp.  I added smoked paprika to taste and left out all other  dry spices  and substituted  it with 2  tsps. of Weber of N Orleans Cajun Seasoning.  I loved that it was broth based instead of tomato based.  We will make this again!

I have no idea what a genuine jabmalaya is like. I followed most of this recipe using chorizo sausage and adding a few extra cajun spices such as oregano. I also added a few mushrooms. The result was fantastic. One of the best meals I've cooked in a long time. I cooking it again this weekend. Thanks.

It was an easy and quick recipe. I had eft -over peppers - both red and green - from a veggie platter. I even used left-over roasted chicken! There was enough heat to please my husband, yet  mild enough for my sensitive tummy. I will definitely make this again, maybe adding some shrimp and okra. Thanks for sharing.!

Made as written.  Found this to be simple and tasty however, adding the uncooked rice and broth to the already cooked chicken and then cooking for 20 minutes or so leads to an overdone boiled chicken taste.
If I made this again, would cook rice separately!

I am giving this 4 stars because is a pretty good recipe but kielbasa in a jambalaya? No way. You need andouille. And to the people who think it needs tomatoes, that's not Cajun.The difference between Cajun and creole cooking is creole dishes use tomatoes and Cajun dishes do not.

Delicious! Due to not having celery, I used peas and cubed zucchini instead. Instead of boneless chicken and kielbasa I used jalapeno chicken sausage. Dish still had enough meat and provided a great spice level. My husband and I both give a double thumbs up!

This was my first time making a jambalaya and I was very impressed!!
I didn't have any celery on hand and it is bursting with flavor without it.
I did add an extra cup and a half of chicken broth to the recipe, as the rice was too sticky for my liking.

This is definitely going to be a regular for my clients!

Great recipe! Very easy to follow and fairly simple. It had a perfect spice and I thought that all of the flavors blended in perfect harmony! My sister said it was way too spicy, so if you aren't in to heat this is not the recipe for you. Overall great recipe that I will definitely use again.

Great recipe.  I include a red bell pepper to go with the green.  I also add a pound of shrimp right before I'm finished.  During the last 20 minutes I stir every few minutes.  Found that it can thicken which can cause the rice to burn.

Delicious with the right amount of kick! Like many others I decided to cook the rice separately and then added it to the rest of the ingredients. I also decided to add some diced tomatoes in there, with more worcerstershire and sriracha sauce than what the recipe required. I also added some chili powder for extra kick ;)

Only 1 1/2  stars, only for sauce, when made with rice, too starchy and pasty,so I changed a few details, I added more chicken broth, and hot or mild ( your choice) italian sausage sliced and cooked separately instead of sausage listed in recipe it was too dry and greasy,  made all ingredients but as a sauce, and simmered, then made linguine, ( but any pasta your preference) separately , then rinsed when done, and added to sauce, tossing till completely blended and simmer 15 minutes to blend flavors , ive made this so many times for church potlucks, or neighbours fire department, etc never ever had a crumb left , and thats with 2 big dishes I love it! Best part is you control the heat you want and exclude the heavy pasty starch and the taste it create,try it you'll love it everyone says the same thing and want recipe

you also can do sauce overnight on low in slowcooker, and at dinner prepare pasta blend simmer and you have a wonderful fast delious meal for hungary kids, and family completed in half hour!

This was pretty good! This is my first time making jambalaya. I did 2 things differently: added red beans and added some cajun seasoning.  Like many others have said, I found it interesting that this didn't contain tomatoes. Next time, I will probably add a can of rotel or a can of diced tomatoes. I also agree with several of the other reviews saying it was a little pasty. Next time I will cook the rice separately and add it in after the other ingredients have simmered.

I like the no fuss recipe.  I made variations with the peppers, rice, and broth. Very versatile recipe.

Easy and awesome, definitely a keeper that will be added to the rotation! Noting others' comments about the rice sticking, I used a dutch oven and converted rice (Uncle Ben's) and it came out perfectly. It did need a bit more liquid at the end so I may start with more liquid next time as another poster commented.

This really is a great base recipe, you can make it as hot or mild as you want by adjusting the hot sauce, add beans to make it heartier (although it is already plenty hearty!), add shrimp just at the end of cooking, all sorts of things.

I always swear I'll try a recipe exactly as written and submit a review from that perspective, but I must admit I used the Cajun spice mix I had on hand rather than the onion powder and cayenne called for, and it gave it a nice depth.The Worcestershire sauce and hot sauce added at the end are a brilliant touch.

Execellent! Everyone loved it. I added one can of stewed tomatoes and one teaspoon of corn starch to thicken the sauce up. 
  I though I would of had some left overs but that was not the case. Even my fussy outlaws ( inlaws) loved it.

I have this almost once a month. 

I add a half to a third more of cayenne as well as half to a third more of hot sauce.  Also at 18 min mark during simmer, I throw in about a cup of peeled and diced shrimp.  They cook during last 2 mins and with all the heat from rice

I left out the celery because blech and I cooked the rice separately; those are the only two changes I made to this recipe. This was good but still too harsh for my SO's extremely sensitive palate (big baby), which means more leftovers for me! Yay! Will make again and I'll leave out a bay leaf next time. Thank you for sharing!

I made this in a Dutch-oven for the adults on our Boy Scout outing.  I added another tsp of 5 pepper spice mix, a 14oz can of diced tomatoes and a 1/2 lb of cleaned and peeled raw medium shrimp (5 mins before serving).  Awesome!

I had no cayenne pepper so I put in chili pepper, and before covering it, added some thyme and oregano. Otherwise, this was prepared as directed and the entire family loved it.

i was really hoping for something more and i couldn't put my finger on it until today.. i was missing the tomato.. looking around on google this morning i found out that typical cajun jambalaya doesn't have tomatoes but creole does.. who knew? i tried adding some old bay but it still didn't taste right to me.. either way.. bf enjoyed this.. i didn't care much for it.. so i'm splitting the difference.. ty for the recipe b/c now i know the difference between cajun and creole styles

I can not eat tomatoes, so I was looking for a recipe without tomatoes, and this was the first one that popped up. What a great recipe! We used shrimp and chicken; easy  to make and very delicious. We used brown rice instead of white rice (gluten-free). We made it spicy with fresh jalapeno peppers. I will continue to make this recipe, we ate the whole thing.

Very good recipe.  Only gave it 4 stars because I never made it exactly as it is outlined in the recipe. Don't care for celery or very spicy food, so I made sure it was more tame for my tastes and used chicken & beef stock instead as well.  Basically, I used this recipe as a base for my own version.  But it was a great recipe base to start with and to add your own flavors to suit your needs!

This was delish! I added about a half a pack of chopped bacon to it! You can never go wrong with adding bacon to something. I left out the celery as we aren't fans of the flavor, and added some (about a tablespoon) creole. I will for sure save this recipe for another day.

Oh my!  This is one fabulous recipe for jambalaya!  The only thing I changed was that I used andouille sausage instead of of kielbasa.  Being Polish, I believe that the kielbasa changes it all because of the seasoning & smokiness.  I think I will add tomatoes next time for more tanginess & a tomatoey flavour.

Really enjoyed this. Added a pinch more cayenne, one can of chopped tomatoes, pre-cooked the rice,added about four cups of broth then the rice. Let it simmer for five eminutes to reheat the rice, Used asian chili sauce instead of tabasco...but, it was all still good. YUM.

Made the recipe as directed except I used 1 tsp cajun spice instead of hot sauce b/c that is what I had. I cooked the rice as directed and it came out fine. We all had seconds. I will try the base recipe with beans and tomatoes for a twist next time. Is a keeper!

The way that this recipe is by itself is definitely good, but not quite what I wanted. However, using the same base, and adding in the stuff I wanted, this came out PERFECT.

I like to use hot Italian sausage, andouille sausage, and chicken; and add more cayenne and hot sauce than listed, because I like mine spicy. This makes a HUGE amount of food, and I can eat it for a week straight without complaining.

Great recipe! I made this for the second time tonight and it turned out great. I think I will exchange shrimp for kielbasa next time. I didn't use the last 2 ingredients and just added more cayenne, which made it more spicy.

I used chicken polska kielbasa for the meat, used brown rice, and added squash, zucchini squash, and diced tomatoes for more veggies. Loved it!

Never had jambalaya before and wanted to try it.  We liked this dish, and ate it with saltines.  Made as written except I didn't add celery as I didn't have any.  Very good, but needed to add extra hot sauce to kick it up a little.

Love this- easy and delicious!
I've made this many times and often make adjustments to increase or decrease spices depending on who's coming for dinner.  Also prepared with tomatoes with chilies to increase the zing and often throw in another pepper.  Freezes well- thanks for this one!

My husband and I made this with a few modifications and loved it!!  We added a can of diced tomatoes with the sauce and used shrimp instead of chicken and beef stock instead of chicken stock.  The consistancy was perfect and we didnt need to add any more liquid.  We will definitely have this again!!!

If I had my camera ready when my boyfriend took his first bite of this, the photo would have been priceless! His face lit up, his eyes wide open! He loved it!
Although, I added more ingredients than called for I am still giving this recipe 5 Stars because it would have been good if I didn't add anything. We like it spicier, so added lots of spiciness. Spices I used: chili powder, garlic powder w/ parsley, onion powder, ground red pepper, smoked paprika, ground cumin, thyme, and cinnamon. I used more hot sauce than called for and I used Pace Picante Sauce Medium. I added more chicken broth, some yellow mustard, and vegetable oil.

Excellent flavor. Not great color though. Needed tumeric and red bell pepper instead of green to make it look a bit more like jambalaya. I would like more veggies and meat in mine; there was a bit too much rice, I thought. Next time I plan to add some diced tomatoes, shrimp, and tumeric. Definitely will make again!

Had some leftover sausages so I used them. Everything else in the recipe left the same except for not using the cayenne and just a few drops of hot sauce. Filling, tasty dish. Even with minimal hot spices, sure warmed us up on a cold winter nite.

Hubby and I loved this!!  I made this exactly as written,except I cooked the rice separately, and I made the creole seasoning blend from this site and used 2 T to flavor this dish.  Kids thought it was a bit too spicy for them.  Hubby added his habanero tabasco sauce, but the heat was just right for me!

I had never made jumbalaya before because I thought it would be too hard, but this recipe was really easy and tasted wonderful!  The only substitution I made was using sweet italian turkey sausage instead of kielbasa.  I will absolutely be making this again and will share this recipe with my family/friends.

Fiexd this dish last night.  My family loved it.  I substituted the chicken for shrimp and it was awesome.  I did decrease the rice and the broth as my family only consist of 3 and we still had leftovers.  Loved it and saving to fix again and again and again.

I thought "without the heat" would mean "flavorful, but not spicy", and I guess the translation is my fault.  The 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne didn't seem like much.  The was certainly edible and even tasty, but just a bit too much for my family.

Not ever having jambalaya before, I can't say whether or not this was authentic to the flavor of New Orleans jambalaya, but that said, my husband I and thought this was good, but not over the top in flavor.  Based on other suggestions, I prepared the rice seperately and mixed it into the dish about 10 minutes before serving, added a can of rotel, some shrimp and some creole seasoning.  It was plenty hot and we didn't add the hot sauce called for.  I served this w/ a crusty french bread.  I'm looking forward to having the left overs for lunch tomorrow, but am nervous about how much hotter it will get after sitting over night :-)

This was fantastic!  Per others' recommendations, I added a can and a half of diced tomatoes and some cajun seasoning because I like a red jambalaya.  This would be great for a party, served instead of chili.  I will definitely make again!

Good recipe. The only downfall was the rice was overcooked in the jambalaya. Next time I will add rice very last or make separate. Great flavors!

This was great!  I did add a can of diced tomatoes per other reviews.  I also used a little more stock then what was listed.  Next time I will not be using celery-I didn't like the crunch that came with it.

We liked this because it wasn't too hot.  I did forget the Worteshire, but it was still good. I made it with double turkey kielbasa, omitted the chicken and used the cajan seasoning had on hand instead of the cayenne pepper also added a can of tomatoes.

A good start, but there was too much meat and too little flavor for my taste. Since the Keilbasa is where the flavor lies, I'm going to try subtracting the chicken altogether. Great texture and flavors though.

I have never tried making this before.  It was great.  I did add a can of tomatoes and cooked the rice separately like others suggested.  Will make this one again! thanks!

Simple is always best. A little more stock and a little more heat ties this dish together to please the whole family. Yes this recipe will be used again especially during football season

I loved this recipe, the flavor was excellent.  I used brown rice instead of white and added a large can of diced tomatoes and cooked for 45 minutes.  Very good and easy.

I loved this recipe. The only substitution I made was to put in scallops in place of the chicken breast. We just ate chicken the last few nights and wanted something different. This dish did have a kick to it, but not overly so. Jambalaya is supposed to be spicy. I meant to add a can of Rotel, but I forgot. In the middle of dinner, I told my husband I forgot it and told him I could add it in, and he said to just leave it. He liked it the way it was! I highly recommend this recipe. Very easy and good.

This was easy and tasty.  I followed the recipe exactly except I upped the cayenne pepper to a teaspoon!  Not sure that was smart it was really spicy!  I was just thinking with all that rice it might suck the spice in.  If you don't like spicy I would keep it to a 1/4t.  I used turkey kielbasa instead of regular.  Thanks for sharing.

I didn't make any alterations except to add shrimp that I cooked with Cajun seasoning. It was really great, and it makes a lot of leftovers.

Doubled the recipe for a family gathering.  Because there were several youngsters in the group, I didnt use quite as much garlic or cayenne pepper as the recipe called for and a did not add the hot sauce at the end, let everyone add their own - but it was a big hit.  Next time I think I will add some tomatoes and maybe if just us and no little ones, some chili peppers but this will definately be served again...and again.

I wasn't crazy about the flavor of this, as compared to other jambalaya recipes I've tried.  My husband liked it better than I did.  I added 2 handfuls of small cooked shrimp, and he really liked that addition. Otherwise followed the recipe closely.

My family loved this recipe and kept going back for seconds aand thirds! I used chicken thighs instead of chicken breasts and added a red bell pepper. As some other reviewers suggested, I added a little more cayenne and also some tomatoes (fresh romas) near the end of cooking. Yum Yum!!!! I will make this recipe again. Thanks for sharing!

We really enjoyed this recipe - added a bit more chicken broth - we prefer a bit thinner sauce. Was a little too spicy for some folks, so we'll tone it down a little next time - this will become a family favorite!

This was awesome! I followed the recipe except that I probably added a LOT more cajun seasoning than is called for (because we love it) and I added some diced tomatoes - also I ended up cooking the rice separately just out of convenience and it turned out just fine. Once it was cooked I threw it back into the rest to get some of the tomato juice to simmer off for awhile. Served it with cornbread, and my boyfriend added a bunch of nasty red pepper flakes to his to make it super-hot:). It was about at my threshold of spicyness, but very delicious! We'll make this one a lot, I can tell already.

Made this in honor of Mardi Gras and fat Tuesday. I have 3 small children so I used only half of the called for cayenne pepper. We also threw in a couple handfuls of shrimp and any jambalaya I've ever had used tomato paste so I threw in a 6 ounce can. The broth / rice ratio is off. 2 more cups are needed to have it cook correctly. Always 1 part rice to 2 parts water. This resulted in an extremely tasty recipe that all my kids and my husband loved. Serve with cornbread for true Louisiana fare. I also added to hot sauce in the end straight to my bowl. I had plenty of zip for me with that and was very mild for the kiddos.

This was very good. I didn't change anything in the recipe. My family loved it. My rice did take a lot longer to cook about an extra 15 minutes and I started to get worried that it would burn so I kept stirring it after the 20 minutes that the recipe called for which could be why it took so long.

I am giving this 5 stars even though I did that Thing were I barely made the recipes the way it was presented.  I used red peppers instead of green, used beef stock in stead of chicken, and added a packet of Uncle Ben's Cajun rice and brown rice instead of white.  I didn't do this on purpose, I just used what I had on hand.  At any rate it was SO good.  We all raved while eating it.  It was delicious!

He really means what he says about it not being spicy. I'm not particularly good with spicy food and even I need to add  considerably more Louisiana hot sauce, but that can be done at the end to your taste. I make this with shrimp instead of chicken and have tried it with water instead of chicken stock and it comes out just fine.

Great starter recipe.. I added another 32oz of chicken stock (it is much needed unless you want a pasty Jambalaya.) I also seasoned my meat before hand, with a pepper blend and a generic Cajun seasoning. I added a can of dice tomatoes as well. Came out well, I'll use again and make some more changes to fit my tastes.

Family loved this recipe.  We love Jambalaya but with kids don't like the spice so I did not add the pepper and I put tabasco on the table for the adults.  I also grilled a few shrimp in garlic, butter, and cajun spice to add to mine which really gave it that southern taste.

I have made this several times and our family absolutely LOVES this recipe. I make it 2-3 times a month. The only things I do different are to use turkey sausage, decrease the cayenne pepper by half (we can't handle too spicy stuff), and omit the hot pepper sauce. It turns out perfect every time and is great for leftovers. Thank you for a great recipe!

This was good, but I still thought it was pretty hot and spicey.  Considering that it was supposed to be a mild jambalaya, the real deal must be smokin'!  It was very easy and quick.

This was very good gave it 4 stars just because of preference. I like a bit of tomato in my Jambalaya, so i added petite diced tomatoes with garlic and peppers which then gave it 5 Stars for me!! Husband and Neice loved it so its a keeper!!

Love this quick and easy recipe.  My kids love it as well when I use the little smoky cocktail weiners instead of kielbasa.  I also have made it with carrots and peas- any veggies I have in the fridge.  Awesome!

We loved this recipe. I used beef broth and brown rice because it is what I had on hand. Using the brown rice ups the cooking time to 40 minutes. This will become a staple in our rotation.

My husband LOVED this recipe, I did not use the kielbasa, I used a pound andouille sausage instead.  It added to the heat and it was terrific.  I bet shrimp added would be good, too.

Awesome recipe! I cut the rice in half and used a brown rice medley from trader joe's instead of white rice, used chicken turkey andouille instead of kielbasa. also added a roux because it turns out that i thought i was making gumbo instead of jambalaya, it was super fantastic, hot and delicious on a cold and stormy night. thankyou!!!

I had never had Jambalaya before this so I didn't know what to expect. That being said we thought this was great but like others had mentioned it was thick. It had great flavor. Thanks

I made this a couple of times now experimenting with the amounts of pepper and adding different spices. Altogether, the original recipe is just as good, but I enjoy adding tomatoes and just making it a little bit spicier. My friends loved it.

Good recipe, didn't change a thing.  It isn't knockout fabulous, but definitely a good family pleaser.  Not too hot, no weird vegetables and super easy to make.  Thanks for the good weeknight recipe, I will hold on to this one!

The ingredients really make a nice, fresh-tasing jambalaya.  I added a can of diced tomatoes with green chilis, as we don't mind the kick, some cajun seasoning straight from the shaker, and a handful of small shelled and deveined shrimp.  A hit!

This was my first time making Jambalaya and overall it was a success.  I embelished a little and added red pepper to it.  It had just the right amount of heat. I may try using different types of rice next time.

I doubled this recipe and served it at the fire station.  This became an instant favorite.  We used deer link sausage,added a can of diced tomatos, and not quite the amount of chicken stock that was called for.  This is a quick, easy crowd pleaser.

OK, so I am not a Jambalaya aficionado, so I can't say how good this compares to "real" jambalaya, however....this is GOOD STUFF.  I added red bell peppers and extra celery.  I also added about 1c more broth.  I also added 1 can stewed tomatoes.  Oh, I only had one can of chicken broth so I used 1 c chicken broth and 2 cups beef broth.  It was just perfect, so I believe tomorrow I may need to add some extra broth or something to make it not pasty. This dish is delicious.

I thought this recipe was pretty good and easy to make. I added a can of diced tomatoes and changed the seasonings. I left out the hot sauce, cayenne, garlic, and onion powder and I added some creole seasoning and garlic powder. It wasn't my husband's favorite, but he isn't that fond of rice. I thought it was great and made great leftovers too.

This is really good, and is truely a one dish recipe which is fantastic.  The reason for only four stars is that I feel like it is missing something, but I am not sure what.  I was thinking about a can of rotel tomatoes and chilis next time.

I will absolutely make this again; however, it will have some slight modifications.  Oh yeah, I added extra worchestershire sauce, and doubled the cayanne as I like it spicy.

This was the 1st time I've made jambalaya and it was so good and easy!  I  substituted smoked sausage since that is what I had, and added a can of diced tomatoes & chiles.  It made a huge amount, I'd say closer to 8 servings.  I also left out the celery since I didn't have any.  I will be making this again!

We sautéed the onion, garlic, green pepper & celery for about 5 min. before adding the chicken & sausage.  We also added ¾ can of diced tomatoes w/ green chilies w/ juice when adding the chicken stock for extra spice.   Very easy & delicious.  Will definitely make again.

Tasty.  Definitely worth making again.  Not overly spicy.  I made with brown rice.  Next time I will add more green pepper, more chicken broth, and some shrimp.

Loved this recipe, but if you enjoy spicy food I suggest at least doubling the pepper sauce.  Added a can of chopped (drained) tomatoes at the end and next time I will use the juice as part of the stock.  Only other changes were that I used Chorizo sausage and added large shrimp (took tails off).  Thanks for sharing this wonderful, easy recipe which could be used for company fare as well.

Wonderful taste.  Never having had this before, the consistency surprised me. It is a much more hearty and substantial meal than I anticipated. I needed much more liquid than was called for.

We love this recipe!  I use spicy smoked sausage and brown rice.  Prepare the meat veggie mix on the stove and then put it all in the rice cooker.  The extra time it takes to cook the brown rice just gives all the flavors longer to develop.

This recipe is really easy and my whole family enjoyed it. I did add twice the kielbasa and 3 chicken breasts because we are meat eaters. Next time I am going to try it with a red bell pepper as well to give it more color. Thanks for the recipe.

This is a delicious, hearty meal.  I skipped the celery, used only 1/2 cup of rice, and added 1 cup water instead of the chicken broth.  I will definitely make this again.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. We actually omitted the chicken because we didn't have time to thaw the chicken. We loved the great taste of jambalaya without the extreme taste of the seasonings that you would get from some the packaged brands. Next time, we will add chicken tenderloins in place of the chicken breast.

This recipe was excellent - I omitted the celery just because I didn't have any on hand.  I also didn't use minute rice just regular uncooked brown rice and it took a lot longer to cook then 18 minutes.  Overall it was delicious!  Thank you!

Wonderful! I substituted canned chicken breast because I didn't have time to thaw my chicken breasts, and it became just shreds, but it was kind of a nice effect that way, gave the dish texture. I also added more chicken broth (I used broth instead of chicken stock, it worked fine) because the rice was soaking up all the moisture.

This was tasty and easy.  I added a can of tomatoes and some shrimp.  We like heat so I shook in some Tobasco.  I cut back on the rice because if you save leftovers (it makes a huge quantity) the rice will absorb every bit of liquid.

I'll go with 4 on this one.  I scaled it up to 40 servings for a large crowd and added some shrimp, ham and crushed tomatoes.  They were happy and it met my expectations.

I thought this was really good, and I am a really picky eater.  I took the advice of some of the other comments and added diced tomatoes with green chili.  Also, I didn't want it too spicy, so I did not add the hot sauce.  I also cooked the rice in a rice pot.  This was great and I had it again the next day.  I had company over as well and they do not like vegetables, so they just picked out the chicken and sausage and poured juice over their rice and they loved it.
Thanks this was a great recipe.

Great flavor & consistency.  I followed the recipe exactly and the ONLY thing I would change is to add some sort of tomatos...maybe with the chilies in there.

Awesome!! This is going to be a family favorite, I can tell!  There wasn't any leftovers!!  The only thing I did different was instead of the cayenne and the onion powder, I used 3/4 tsp. of Cajun Seasoning.  WOW!  My middle daughter (the pickiest of the three) even cleaned her plate!

this was very easy, and it turned out perfect.  I used brown rice instead of white, added more sausage and left out the celery.  My boyfriend went for two helpings.  We had this and king cake last night in celebration of "Fat Tuesday".

Flavor was great, I also added 1 lb of shrimp. Next time I will add alot more hot sauce and will cook the rice seperately.  Was a little too thick for my liking, but everyone else loved it!

This was good. I don't think there's any "easy" recipe out there for homemade jambalaya but this was easier than some I've tried. My husband liked it and ate two helpings. I used smoked sausage rather than kielbasa and added some creole seasoning and a can of diced tomatoes. That was perfect. Yummy. Will save this recipe. Thanks!

I really love this recipe.  It's quick and easy for a weeknight but tastes great.  I added about a tsp of thyme because I like it and it worked well.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this last night for a potluck dinner my husband and I went to. Everyone loved it! I did make a few changes. I added jalapenos, okra and shrimp! I also added lots more spices and hot sauce. It was more like a gumbo than a traditional jambalaya but oh so good. I will add this to my list of must makes! Thanks Grant.

This was a great recipe.  It's very easy to make and my husband loves it.  I have made it several times and have added shrimp to it a couple of times.  I've never had a problem with it.  Great Recipe!!!

This is a quick and easy meal that can feed a large group of people.  We love it and have added it to our regular dinner rotation.  If you don't have a large group, it keeps great as left overs to heat up the next day.

I followed the recipe to the letter. The jambalaya however was very bland. I use this website for recipes very often and they are usually incredible. This is the first one that disappointed me. By the way there's a lot of dicing involved and the prep time was closer to 30-45 minutes.

We made this last night, 7/7/04, and it was wonderful. The only thing that we did differently was that we left out the cayenne so our son whom is very sensitive to spice could eat it. We added hot sauce to our own bowls and it was wonderful. It was much more flavorful than the other recipes we've tried for Jambalaya. We were first introduced to Jambalaya from a friend of my hubby's who is in the USN. This particular person was from La and he made us his style and we've been hooked ever since. He's not around to cook it for us so we had to find a recipe we liked and this is it!

While I wouldn't call this a kid friendly recipe, the adults who ate it thought it was very good. I followed the recipe almost exactly except for a few alterations. I left out the celery because I was out, I used the breasts and broth off of a whole chicken I cooked and used turkey polish keilbosa in place of regular to trim some fat. The dish was very flavorful, overall a very good recipe.

This was a simple recipe.  I seasoned the chicken with poultry seasoning before browning it with the sausage.  I added red bell pepper because I didn't have green.  I also thru in some diced mushrooms...which added ALOT of juices and made it a bit mushy.  But in all, it had really good flavor and my neighbors and I enjoyed it.  Mahalo! (thank you in Hawaiian)

the whole family really enjoyed this.  for the most part, followed the recipe.  i used wok oil (wok oil is flavored with garlic and ginger) instead of olive oil.  i did omit the hot sauce and left it on the counter for anyone who needed an extra kick...i did add a can of diced tomatoes as suggested previously.(i used  diced tomatoes with garlic and olive oil.)  the recipe really made the house smell good....

This was a great recipe. My husband likes things spicy but I don't so this was a good compromise. I used brown rice and it worked fine, just needed to cook a little longer. This is something I'll make again.

excellent base recipe.  i've never been able to get a second helping of this because i usually make it when i have company.  i've used hot links for a spicer dish and i use a can of tomato sauce or diced canned tomatoes, whatever i have on hand.  thanks for a great recipe.

This recipe was quick and easy, and turned out fabulous.  I added a lot more spice to it (red pepper flakes, garlic powder, doubled/tripled the cayenne and onion powder) because we like a lot of spice, but I'm sure it would have turned out really well as written.  A new favorite in my house.  My boyfriend and I fought over who would take the leftovers for lunch today.  He won.  :(

We loved this recipe.  It is delicious and so easy to make!  It is a good base, and ingredients can be played with.  I added our own homemade "Cajun Spice Blend" in place of the dried items, because we like our food on the spicy side (hence the 4 stars, not 5). I also use Chicken Andoulle sausage in place of the kielbasa.  Definitely a new favorite in our home.

I really enjoyed this.  My husband can't handle anything too spicy, so this was a good alternative.  My 5 year old son picked out all the sausage and gobbled it up.  My daughter ate everything but the sausage (go figure..).  Will make this again.
