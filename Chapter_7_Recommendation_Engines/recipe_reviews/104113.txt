This pie is EXCELLENT!  We have several diabetics and Weight Watchers in our family so the chance for pecan pie with less sugar made it possible for many of us to have a small piece of this Christmas favorite.

I rate this pie 5 stars because it is the closest to the Pecan pie I have always been known for. It is wonderful.
