Delicious! I love root veggies so this was perfect for me. I did make everything in one pot (a martha stewart cast iron pot-the best!), so it was easy to go from the stove to the oven. Next time I would add more garlic, but it was great as is.

I loved this as a basic recipe to work off of.  I changed up some of the vegetables to ones we had on hand.  We had lots of meat eating company, so I double the recipe and cooked up Italian sausage separately as the vegetables cooked and put them all together in the baking pan (no lentils this time around).  I forgot to add the cheese with the biscuits, but with the extra spices on the meat that was fine.  Everyone really liked this dish.  Looking forward to making it again soon, with the lentils!  (Won't forget the cheese with that one.)

My favorite part was the biscuits and cheese.  The veggies had an ok flavor, but mostly you could only taste the spices.

I made two deviations from the recipe: used 1.25 C parmesan instead of Colby and I used a pie crust that I latticed over the top of the pan instead of biscuits. I think the parmesan top and the pie crust were by far the best parts. We are not big fans of rosemary or thyme, so it is possible we would have liked it better if other spices were used. My husband said it was too "busy" with so many different veggies and that it tasted "weird". 15 month old, who eats just about anything, ate only 3 bites.
