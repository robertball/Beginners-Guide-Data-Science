This recipe is quick and delicious. I added half a stick of butter for flavor and to minimize sticking.

I hesitate to even give this recipe one star!  This is an absolute waste of money and ingredients.  The dish is very bland and dry.  What a mess. Surely someone tests these recipes before they are offered to your website users. It taught me one thing however: I will read reviews to see what other people say before I waste my time and money.

YUCKY!  Something was missing in this dish.  My husband ate it only because he was hungry.  Do not waste your time with this!

Tasteless mass of dry cabbage and dry potatoes. A waste of time and money and a good package of chicken.

Good but bland. It needs something else.
