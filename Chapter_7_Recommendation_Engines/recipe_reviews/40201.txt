Beautiful presentation.  My braiding skills were not the greatest with this but the dough was very forgiving and looked very nice after baking.  I did divide this into 2 loafs which make it easier to handle.  Subbed broccoli for the green beans (yuck) but that does not affect my rating.  Cut way back on sour cream as I wanted to use mozzarella and cheddar.  Microwaved potatoes, carrots and broccoli to save a step and on dish washing.  Will make again, but with my adjustments.

This took me about 15 min to cook the chicken and get everything mixed, then another 11 minutes to bake--26 minutes to make a delicious, cheap and filling meal. The only thing I changed was the seasonings. I favor onion powder, garlic powder and pepper.

very good but id use another package of rolls, it took forever to get that thin. also took quite a bit of time to make. but for something so good it's worth it I think.

This was great!! I had a problem with the braiding, but it turned out well. Also, I made a few smaller "pockets" for easier dividing.

This recipe was very time consuming and in the end got bad reviews from the family.  The mustard was over powering and the sour cream seemed to curdle during baking.  It looks appealing but the taste did not deliver.

Very pretty.  I used this for turkey leftovers.  I would like to try a condensed soup next time instead of the mustard and sour cream.

I almost think this would be better without the potatoes, but my guests loved it.

I really enjoyed this even though it is time consuming.  My young kids thought it was great too.  My husband thought it was just ok.

So easy  substituted shrimp was my fav but use any meat.  Also did breakfast egg and your choice. See if can buy the dough sheet roll instead of crescent roll. Just unroll only thing crescent are more even as far as thickness goes
