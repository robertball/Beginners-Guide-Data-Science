This made perfect chicken balls, that were not too fluffy, and were crispy enough once I got used to how long they needed to be in and how hot the oil needed to be. They were very easy to make, a great comfort food.

OMG! This was amazing. Sooooo crispy. Definitely better than any restaurant chicken balls. The family put it on their top 10 list!
