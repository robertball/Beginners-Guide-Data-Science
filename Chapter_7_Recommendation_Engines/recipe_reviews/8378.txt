The cake is beautiful, moist, and delicious.  The cream cheese frosting is used only for piping (perhaps with a star tip) around the top of the cake, outlining a pool for the whipped cream.   My suggestion is to halve the recipe for cream cheese frosting if you don't want lots of leftover frosting.  It's a beautiful cake and if you're traveling with it, easy to take the plain layers with you, then add the berries and the whipped cream and assemble it when you arrive.  Frosting comes in decorator tubes now so you could purchase that, attach a decorator tip, and then make the well for the whipped cream.
Voila', easy and impressive cake!

I made this cake for some people I work with and it was a big hit. But instead of making it totally from scratch I used a yellow cake mix and substuited buttermilk for the milk and butter flavored crisco for the butter. I also used only 1/2 cup of sugar. I also used a dash of almond extract in the cream and frosting. and used 16 ounces of cream cheese in the frosting with just a dash of buttermilk to lossen it up for pipeing. The cake was awesome.

I baked this for my dad's birthday last weekend, and it was very good!  One thing to note, the cake itself is pink, which was sort of funny at the birthday.  The cake would be perfect for Mother's Day or a little girl's birthday.  It's bright and very sweet.  Put as many strawberries as you can into this--the strawberries offset its sweetness because they are tart and make for a well-balanced dessert.  I didn't know exactly what the whipped cream was for... I put it around the outside, and it worked, but wasn't particularly necessary.  The cream cheese frosting was divine, however.

This was better than your average strawberry shortcake.  The cake part was very moist and dense.  Although the cream cheese frosting on the sides was yummy, it was a little hard to ice with the whipped cream oozing out from between the layers.  If you are short on time or want to cut the richness of the cake, you can easily skip on the frosting.  I also should have listened to my instincts and used nonstick cooking spray instead of greasing and flouring the pans per the recipe.  The cake layers stuck and I had to piece them back together.  For anyone who hasn't tried it, I've never had a cake stick when using Pam or Mazola.

I did not see the rubbery texture everyone was talking about.  Nor did I find this too sweet.  I was a little reluctant to make this cake because of some of the reviews, but this was a fantastic cake.  I should have only used 2 pans instead of 3 because each layer came out about a half inch thick.  I would have given this recipe 5 stars, but I found the whole cake to very slidey.  Two layers definitely would have cut down on the sliding.  The taste was great!!! My husband loved it.  It is very simple to make and assemble.  The red strawberries can be formed into a maple leaf over the white icing to be even more aesthetically pleasing!  This is a wonderful summer-time cake for in season strawberries!  I will make it again for sure!

This cake was one of three that I took to a church dessert buffet. I didn't get to taste it until it was almost gone, however, when I did I felt embarassed to think it came from my house. It made a nice presentation and all, but the texture was tough, almost rubbery. I don't know if its the recipe, or if I did something wrong. I checked the recipe again and felt that I had followed it verbatim. The flavor and appearance were good enough, but the texture pretty much ruined it for me. Sorry JJ.

This was amazing cake!  I made one with the cream cheese icing, which was a little two sweet for us, but it was still great.  The next one I made with just whipped cream instead of the icing and it was awesome!  Great recipe thanks for sharing!

This cake took alot longer to make than I expected - i.e. practically all day! The pink strawberry cake mix was VERY moist and filled only 2 nine-inch cake pans. To make it 3 layers, I made the centre layer from a store-bought chocolate cake mix. I decorated that top with sliced strawberries and chocolate shavings (see photos of this recipe). I think that a filling other than whipped cream would work better - the whipped cream seems too light and is somewhat absorbed by the cake - a stickier vanilla icing might be better. All the trouble was worth it - it got rave reviews at a family birthday party!

I made this for Christmas dinner- it was great.  The layers needed to be cooked about 5 minutes longer.  I used 2 pints of frozen strawberries.

I made a little extra whipping cream and omitted the cream cheese frosting.  The sweetness of the cake and mildness of the cream complimented each other perfectly.  I will make this again, addding a lot more thinly strawberries in between the layers.

This cake was dense, chewy, rubbery and plain gross.  The cream cheese frosting did not go well with the whip cream filling and the batter did not make 3 cakes, it only made 2.  I am an avid baker and I can't believe all the great reviews this cake got! GROSS!

Super yummy! Okay so like another review said you need the strawberries to tame down the sweetness of the cake and the whipped cream helps too.  I am using the recipe to make a princess castle for my daughter's birthday so I made it in deeper pans so it took quite a bit longer to bake, almost an hour for the deepest one (about 4 inches deep).  The sides got a little brown but after tasting the "brown" parts it doesn't taste at all burnt so don't worry if the sides turn brownish.  I did cover the tops of the pans with foil for most the time though so the tops wouldn't burn.  Love this recipe!  Thanks again!

This cake was incredible! Everything turned out perfectly. It was a little time consuming because everything, including the whip cream and icing are made from scratch but it's not all the difficult and definitely worth the effort.

This was top notch! It only made two layers for me (as it did with other reviewers). I used 1 cup of sugar instead of 2. Next time I will change this to 1 1/4 cup sugar and 1 cup of puréed strawberries in the batter. I would prefer more of the fresh strawberry flavor mixed in. I did not make the whipped cream as I didn't want to hassle with it melting and dripping between the layer. I used cream cheese frosting (a different recipe that I prefer) between layer and around/on top of the cake. It was a real hit. A very very dense cake, almost like a pound cake. It was not at all dry like others complained of.

Very good.  I did not have any problems with the wipped cream being absorbed.  I used heavy whipping cream and very well cooled cakes.  I did need more sugar in the whipping cream, though.  Make sure you taste test it for sweetness.

Have made this cake a few times, and it's delicious.  However, I think the frosting is a bit heavy for this cake, so I always use a whipped cream frosting instead.  I made it for a friend's baby shower (can you guess the sex of the baby), and it received RAVE reviews... with the whipped cream frosting.  There's absolutely nothing wrong with the cream cheese frosting; in fact, I've used it to frost red velvet cupcakes.  It's just that I prefer a lighter topping for this cake.  And it's excellent cold, straight out of the refrigerator.

This cake tasted pretty good and strawberry-y, but there was a texture issue, and it didn't rise much. The texture was way too moist, so it was difficult to cut. It stuck to the plate I put it on to cool and the layers cracked, and a chunk of one came out. I probably won't make this recipe again in cake form, but I'll try them as cupcakes. ~Bae

The caske was delicious, but I am not a great baker so the presentation was HORRIBLE.  My cake did not bake in the center so the center caved in.  I wouldn't try this receipe again.

Absolutely fantastic!  I used strawberry applesauce instead of pureeing fresh ones . . . worked wonderfully (a snack cup is the perfect amount)

The presentation was beautiful and the birthday girl (my aunt) absolutely loved it. I did notice that the cake absorbed a lot of the whip cream filling so it is best to assemble the cake right before serving. Will make again!

Not something I would do every day, and I'm definitely not a cake maker.. lol.  But loved the flavors.  What I would do next time though, once I realized that I was basically making cool whip for in between the layers, would get the cool whip to use, rather then make it.

Another cake that I guinea pigged people at work with. It was a huge hit and the biggest compliment is coming home with an empty cake plate. The only thing I can say was that the frosting was very sweet. Someone even thought it was store bought :( So, I think next time I'm going to add less powdered sugar. Other than that, 4 stars!!

What a great combo!  I didn't have time to make the cake portion, so I used a boxed strawberry & white cake.  Since people commented that it was too sweet, I used the cream cheese frosting as the filling with strawberries, used a light skim coat on the sides to fill any gaps, and used the whipped cream to frost the outside.  Decorating the top with strawberries and shaved chocolate!  What a hit!!!  Thank You!!

This cake looked very nice when it was finished, though the taste was just all right.  The favor seemed to be more with the cream cheese icing and whipped cream.  The cake itself was a nice pink color, but the jello did give a bit of a "fake" taste, and a slightly fake aftertaste. I made it for my boyfriend and he liked it a lot.  If I made this again, I would cut the sugar down to about 1.5 cups because this was too sweet.  Also, I would look for all natural jello or try pudding instead.  Good and fun to make, but not great or excellent.

I like the concept of this cake, however, the cake itself was not that great. If I was voting just for the cake recipe, I'd give it a 3, maybe. It tasted floury and had an odd artificial strawberry taste. I loved the cream filling and the cream cheese frosting though, that kind of saved it.

Good, but not quite what I was expecting.  I wanted more of a natural strawberry flavor to these.  The Jell-O, though providing a gorgeous color, gave it a slightly artificial taste.  I did cut the sugar to 1.5 cups, could probably go a little less still.  Frosted entire cake - not just sides - with the CC Frosting (still had a bunch left, definitely cut that in half!).  And, only made it a two-layer cake.  Pack your layers with berries.  I didn't and really wish I did.

This cake was amazing, not too sweet at all.  After reading the reviews, the only change I made was to pipe the cream cheese icing around the layers so I could pack in the whipped cream! Will definitely get a page in the recipe book

I made this for my daughter's Birthday and the family really enjoyed it.  A lot of reviews said the frosting was too sweet so I used a whipped cream cheese frosting recipe from this site to frost the entire cake.  It called for much less sugar. I would make this again.  A good summer cake.

In presentation I would rate this 5 stars but in taste, I was not impressed. I found the texture and taste dense and artificial in taste.  If I were to bake this again, I would add double strawberry puree in the cake. This was a lot of fuss to create though it was appreciated by the children and their parents for the occasion- Birthday cake. I am saddened by the outcome but will attempt it again and tweek it to my liking.

This recipe has been a favorite for quite some time. It was in one of the many recipe books from the grocery store checkout. It was called Blue Ribbon Recipes/Cakes. The first time I tried it, it was a hit and now people beg for it. It's a Great Cake . Very elegant.

It's a lot of fuss, but well worth it.  For reviewers who mentioned the aftertaste, it is the baking powder you are using - try Rumford.  I've made it twice and the baking powder makes the difference.

Excellent recipe.  Extremely easy to make and beautiful presentation.  I made this cake for a friend's birthday and she thought I bought it.  It tasted wonderful, too.  (I used Cool Whip instead of the whipped cream, 'cos I over beat the cream and didn't have time to get more. :))

This was delicious!  I made it for my husband's birthday and he said it was the best cake ever.  He had wanted Strawberry Shortcake, but I thought that was too simple.  He had two huge pieces and he honestly rarely eats sweets.  He used to love Golden Rum Cake from this site, but I am afraid Strawberries and Cream Cake topped that one...although both are fantastic!  Thanks for the recipe!

I baked the layers 30 minutes and they came out perfect.  The cake was very moist and light tasting.  I skipped the cream cheese icing and used more whipped cream.  Beautiful and delicious.

I made this for my Church (I will post pics).. It came out beautiful! I didn't taste it, but people loved it there, and it gives a simple but beautiful presentation. I was worried about some of the reviews of it being rubbery and someone said that it made small layers. I sifted my flour and baking powder together, and like suggested, I halved the cream cheese icing just to decorate a bit and it was still too much. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. It was wonderful! Thank you!!

Made this cake for my parents' 50th wedding anniversary.  What a fabulous cake!  It was easy to make and delicious.  The icing was a little sloppy - hard to pipe for decoration.  Other than that, I give it a thumbs up!  Everyone loved it!

the strawberry cake was fairly dense but moist...i cut down the sugar to 1 1/2c, only used half the gelatin and increased the amount of pureed strawberries...also, instead of making the cream cheese icing, i matched the cake with a chocolate mousse frosting....it turned out great and we really enjoyed it :)

Okay so I am not completely sure what the person below me was talking about with the cream cheese frosting only being for piping, but the cream cheese frosting is used to frost the entire cake except the top and also for decorations if you want piping on your cake.  But other than that, this cake is absolutly delicious and i have made it quite a few times and a strawberry boxed cake mix with the pureed strawberries tastes exactly the same! Happy Baking!

I talked my friend into making this cake for her daughters birthday party, and it came out embarrassingly bad. It looked beautiful and a lot of effort was put into making it, but it had a really strange taste and texture. The kids ate it.

Okay, can you say "PARCHMENT PAPER." Please use it or you may end up with a trifle instead of a cake like me! I used non-stick pans, and greased them. None of them came out. Well, all at once that is! I was making this for my neighbor and it looked pathetic. I ended up making a trifle out of it. The components were simple and good, but "maker beware." :(

This cake was pretty good.  A very pretty color.  When I saw no salt on the list of ingredients, I assumed that something in the gelatin took care of that.  But after tasting the cake, I think it would benefit from a little added salt.

One of the best summer cakes I have ever made!  It's very moist and pretty!  My family loved it.  I did spread the cream cheese frosting over the entire top of the cake and then dolloped the remaining whipped cream in the middle.  I didn't have enough of the whipped cream left to cover the top.

This did not turn out well for me.  I'm not sure why. I followed the recipe exact. There wasn't enough whipped topping filling either.  Thanks anyway.

This was arguably the best cake I ever made, and I have made many.  Since I had enough cream cheese frosting to frost the whole cake, I used that on the top insitead of the whipped cream.  A terrific cake, and a great hit with the friend for whom I made it, and with the other ladies who shared it with us.  I will definitely make this again, especially whenever strawberries are in season (now).  Thank you for a great recipe!!

Delicious. I like the texture of this strawberry cake verses the other strawberry cake from scratch recipe here. It was spongey and easy to work with (as opposed to sticky and soft). The cake itself was a little bland for me (even though there is tons of sugar in it), but good cream cheese frosting made up for that. In addition to a 9X13 cake, I made cupcakes using all purpose flour and they were just as good. I did not a difference in taste or texture.

This is really a good cake. Everyone at my relationship bible study loved it. I do suggest that you leave out the heavy cream, and just use strawberry cool whip, and add strawberries.

I thought that this cake was very easy and fun to make.  I entered it in the Poteet Strawberry Festival "Taste of Texas" Food Show and won 1st place in the adult cake division!  I am putting this one in my recipe box for sure.

Deliciious!! Will make again, but may use more strawberries in the cake & between the layers. I didn't use the cream cheese frosting as others suggested because it really isn't needed. I'd like to try with raspberries also. May try using a bundt pan: cut in half, scoop out center & add whipped cream & berries for filling.

This was a wonderful cake, although I wasn't sure what to do with the cream cheese frosting; it didn't seem to work for me. I had to add some milk, and I was left with a LOT of frosting! This was a delightful cake, though, and I will definitely make it again!

Flavor was ok but next time I'll skip the filling and just use icing all over. The filling only made the cake wet and heavy.

This cake is really good, but I've made it twice now and it keeps falling apart on me. It seems fine if you do it in a 13 x 9 instead of layers though.

If you want skinny layers, use three 9" pans and watch your time.  It doesn't take as long as the recipe says.  When making  it again. I'd use two 9" pans.  Am afraid these will be dry the way they are now.

I gave this recipe 3 stars because the filling did not turn out thick at all.  I had to a scoop of store bought frosting just to make it thick.  Also, it only needed 2 nine inch round pans.  Cake tasted great and the frosting was a nice touch as well.

PERFECT KIDS CAKE! I made a few alterations to this cake and used a vanilla butter cream frosting instead of cream cheese and then I added a layer of marshmallow fondant.  I made it one day in advance (kept in a fridge of course) and it was so perfectly moist and sweet for the party and a big hit with kid that usually forgo the cake.

Ok.  I had quite the incident with this cake.  Previous to making this cake I made a brownie cheese cake and part of the brownie mix had dripped in my oven and without thinking I put this cake in and it came out tasting terribly burnt but the bite my husband tried he did mention it tasted  extremely chewy.  I had read the reviews from others about it tasting rubbery but I thought that maybe they had used all purpose flour instead of cake flour (but apparently that wasn't the case).  Anyway,  I was just going to do away with this cake because I had enough dessert planned for my party but being as nuts as me I couldn't sleep thinking about it haha.  So I ended up using a yellow cake mix and prepared it as instructed on the box then added the strawberry gelatin and the pureed strawberries.  The cake was FABULOUS!  The frosting was great too.  I will definitely make this cake again!

This cake is A LOT OF WORK.  It is expensive to make.  Mine fell all apart, but I did try to make it in 2 layers because I didn't have 3 pans.  I loved the frosting....but wasn't wild on the taste of the actual cake.  My stepdaughter, who I made it for said it was delicious....so that is what matters.  But, it was the hardest cake I have ever made.

I brought this to work.  Everyone thought it was wonderful.  I followed the recipe as is.  I would pipe the cream cheese frosting on each layer of cake so that the filling stays between the layers.

The cake was pretty easy to make and was beautiful when finished.  The taste as others noted was a bit artificial because of the jello.  You can cut back on the amount of jello.  I did when I made it a second time.

I made this cake for a family gathering.  And even though I haven't cooked many cakes, this one got rave reviews.  I made a few variations. Instead of making the cake from scratch, I used strawberry cake mix; also instead making the icing according to the recipe, I substituted cream cheese and strawberry icing.  Delicious!!  I will definitely be making this cake again and again!  Thank you for this great recipe!

Wasn't too big on the cream filling. But the flavor of the cake was great. The only thing I would do differently is bake at 325 for maybe 30-35 mins?

This was a very delicious cake. I made it for my dad's birthday party and it was a hit. The only thing is the cake was a little dry.  For the frosting, I pureed the strawberries and added them into the frosting mix. Also, I only used 2 layers of cake instead of 3 and it was easier to frost and put strawberries in the middle.

This recipe was amazing! I told my friends that I wanted to bring something beautiful to the picnic and this really did the trick.  Not only did it look gorgeous but it tasted fabulous.  I used Wild Strawberry Jell-O instead of the normal Strawberry and thought it tasted great.  The only problem was that it took me HOURS to make it, much longer than expected, but it was totally worth it.

I made this cake for our Memorial Day party and it was a HIT!  Very appealing visually and very tasty.  I only wish I had made two. Easy to make.  My father came over at 11pm last night looking for another slice, it was gone and now he is demanding another cake asap.

This is a great cake! I have made it several times and have received rave reviews!  I love the fact that it doesn’t call for a boxed cake.  Real homemade cake recipes are hard to find these days.  I did make it with strawberry cream cheese in the frosting which was only needed for a strawberry obsession of a friend.  Beautiful and moist, this cake has made to my favs!

I baked this cake for my hubby for v-day and he loved it! I used a different frosting though- just heaving whipping cream with vanilla and sugar- made for a light sweet treat!

As a rule it is generally accepted in my family that I CANNOT BAKE A CAKE!  However, this one turned out wonderfully (presentation AND taste) - I heartily recommend and intent to make this again for one of our summer time get togethers

This is a great and fun cake to make!  I made this cake twice and the first time I made it I greased the pans with butter and flour which was a huge mistake, the cakes stuck to the bottom and came apart even after the 10 min I let it cool.  But the next time I used pan grease for the sides and bottom and then I used parchment paper on the bottom and the layes came out perfect! And to frost the cake I first crumbed the cake with a crusting buttercream icing to keep the whipped cream from running out of the sides and the with the creamcheese frosting.

This cake turned out wonderful.  It was so moist and delicious especially with the strawberries being so sweet.  It was also very easy to make, and took a lot less time than the hour prep.  The longest amount of time was waiting for the cakes to cool.  Also, because I was serving it that night, I put it in the freezer for and hour and a half to give it a chill.  Great Cake!!!!

I think this cake is o.k.  Everyone I have ever served it to, thinks it is the best strawberry cake ever. I frost the entire thing, not just the sides with cream cheese frosting.  Otherwise follow the recipe exactly.  Of course the sweeter & juicier the berries the better the cake.

Very tasty cake, made it for a co-workers birthday...everyone loved it!! The only thing I might change would be the amount of eggs, maybe one less so the cake would turn out less dense and a little lighter? Otherwise it was great!! Will definately bake this one again.

This recipe is time consuming and takes a lot of prep, but it's so worth it!  This is one of the best cakes I've ever made!  I got rave reviews, but it doesn't travel very well because it needs to be refrigerated or the whipped cream in the middle will melt and cause the layers to slide.

The last reviewer advised against putting this cake in the fridge, and when I got to read that, the cake I made was belatedly already chilling for a couple of hours in one. The cake itself is delicous and fragrant, but it is a bit dense, so I will make this again and not chill it next time and see if there is a difference in texture. Did not frost nor fill it, topped each layer with a strawberry glaze before stacking them. Thank you for posting.

This is one of the best cakes I have ever made!  We absolutely loved it!  Those who say it turned out chewy did something wrong - it was very moist and delicious.  Saying it doesn't require a lot of fuss is a stretch though - it took a long time to make this.  On accident I used all the filling for the first 2 layers and did not have any left to put on top.  That worked out fine because there was enough frosting to frost the entire cake.  I'll probably make it the same way next time.  Well worth the amount of work it takes to make!

What a wonderful recipe.  Make sure you pipe the icing on top first before the whip cream filling or you'll have it all slide down like I did. Because of that reason it didn't look like a masterpiece but tasted like one.

did I do something wrong?  I thought the cake was horrible...not much of a taste but there was an aftertaste.  The cream cheese frosting was great and the parts of the cake frosted with it tasted yummy, the whipped cream was also good.  Sorry, I wont be making this one again

I made this cake and it came out great.  For the frosting I used 1 and 3/4ths cup a sugar, and it wasn't too sweet at all.  I made it for Easter and everyone loved it.

My husband said this cake was in the top three he's ever eaten.  I have to say that I agree.  I made it for company last week that we hadn't seen for quite a while.  I wanted to cook something that would impress them, and it certainly did.  I'll definately be making this again.

I made this for a co-worker's birthday and it got rave reviews - I didn't even get to taste it because it was gone so fast!  The layers were very moist and dense, and easy to work with.  I used purchased whipped topping and frosting (the whipped variety) to save time and effort, and was very pleased with the results.  I plan to make this again soon!

Great cake recipe!  My father said it was the best cake he's ever had.  I made it without the cream cheese frosting and increased the whipped cream filling to cover the sides.  It came out excellently.  Smells great while baking too.

I thought this cake was very good. The only reason I did not give it five stars was because in the directions it does not instruct you how to "puree" the strawberries. I personally know how to puree food but I was using this recipe for a class and I can't assume that everyone knows.  A lot of the reviews said there was not enough batter for three cake pans but I did not have an issue with this. I used cake flour and was sure to sift it based on some reviewers saying the cake was dense. I did wait to assemble the cake until just before serving.  I whipped the cream until it was very stiff and had no issues with the layers slipping or sliding . The following day the cake was still standing tall! Based on other reviews I cut back on the sugar (1 1/2 cups) and there was still plenty of sweetness. I used real butter and full fat cream cheese for the icing. As recommended by another reviewer I also used parchment paper to line the cake pans.  For a little added pizzazz I added a small amount of strawberry puree to the cream cheese icing. I had to add a small amount of powdered sugar to account for the puree being added. The puree gave the icing a pretty pink color. Oh, I used Rumford aluminum free baking powder and didn't use all of the jello flavoring (a little more than half of the pouch).

The best and most beautiful three layer cake! I omitted the cream filling and used 1 1/2 the frosting called for since I used the frosting for the layers instead. I also subbed one half of the vanilla for almond flavoring. One tip in decorating this cake is  to bake it the day before and frost only the layers. Then frost the top and the sides the next day. Very moist and festive! Perfect for Mother’s Day or a shower!

I used this recipe for the cake only and turned them into cupcakes as well. I had an idea for a strawberry cheesecake cupcake.. so I crushed graham crackers and made a crust of the bottom of the cupcake. I also added chunks of fresh strawberries on top of the puree to really make the strawberry flavor pop. Filled the cups with cream cheese frosting (used another recipe from the site), and topped with the 121 Whipped Cream recipe (also from this site), the remaining crushed crackers and a slice of the fresh strawberries! STRAIGHT DELICIOUS! I will say, that at times the cream cheese frosting/filling recipes are too sweet. I have learn to "temper" the powdered sugar, and not just dump it in the bowl, so I can control the sweet level.

Amazing! The cake is light, moist and absolutely delicious. Everyone raved about how good it turned out. Made this cake for a family event.. as my cakes were cooling on the rack, I was looking over the recipe and realized I only added 1 cup of sugar instead of the 2 cups the recipe calls for.  Doh!  It turned out to be a wonderful mistake.  Everyone who ate the cake felt the extra cup of sugar would have made the cake too sweet, especially since the cream cheese frosting is so sweet.  And my family isn't shy about giving an opinion.

I made this cake for my Mother-in-Laws 60th Birthday cookout. It was a huge hit! Everyone raved and I have request to make it again for other family members Birthdays next year. I made it the day before and kept in the fridge until ready to serve. It was nice and refreshing since it was a little warm out. I also only used the whipped cream in the middle layers but covered the whole outside with the cream cheese frosting. I am telling you making this will be the best thing you have ever done!

I used the cake part of the recipe, and turned them into cupcakes instead. Filled the cups 2/3 full, baked at 350 for 25 min. The cupcakes came out wonderfully. Moist, flavorful, and my co-workers loved them! I've wanted a good strawberry cake since forever. Thank you JJ.

This cake came out perfect. I did make a few changes for my own personal tastes, but this is a great recipe that I will be sure to use again. I used cornstarch and white flour instead of the cake flour (only because I didn't have any on hand). I cut down the sugar for the cake to about 1.5 cups, and  I used all whipped cream instead of the cream cheese frosting. I also added more strawberry puree, about 3/4 cup. The cake had a very nice texture and subtle flavor plus makes an impressive display at the finish- Thanks for sharing!

Was so excited to make this for my sister in law's birthday!  Looked really pretty! Was VERY VERY DRY!  Threw half the cake away. Will try again, but maybe next time I'll just by Betty Crocker strawberry cake mix cause I have made that before and it's yummy and moist.. I would also make my own recipe for cream cheese frosting. The one that came with this recipe was too sweet and melted by the time I got to my destination. I learned a very important lesson...... Read all reviews before going out and buying everything you need for this recipe.

made this cake for a friend's birthday and it was a huge hit! Great for welcoming spring!  I had to put the cake in the fridge for a couple of hours after layering it with the "cream" as the icing and cream would mix together and not look very pretty. Cake looked GREAT with 2 coats of icing - I ended up making a batch and a half of the icing but didn't really need that much.   Great cake!!!

This was delicious, I made it in a heart shape for Valentines.  Everyone loved it and weren't afraid to tell me they wanted to take some home.  Even though this cake makes quite a bit but it still wasn't even enough!!!:)  I didn't even have strawberries which probably would have been even better. One of the best scratch cakes I've made and it turned out beautiful...impressed everyone!

I made a smaller brndt cake by cutting 1/3 out of the recipe, and used even less sugar (1 cup). I didn't use the whipped cream filling and went straight to the frosting, where I cut the frosting recipe in half (and used less powdered sugar - 1 cup) in order to cover the bundt cake. Everyone had 2 servings, and a few 3! The original recipe has too much sugar for my personal taste, but I liked the changes I made and would make it again. Thank you!

this cake made a beautiful presentation and everyone loved it. I thought the flavor was just o.k. The icing was very sweet and the cake itself tasted like fake strawberries. Maybe next time i'll use some strawberry extract to enhance the strawberry flavor.

Was a really good cake- made it for our daughter's 4th B-Day.  Had to make a couple of adjustments... My husband is allergic to wheat, but can tolerate spelt flour.  Converting from cake flour to all-purpose flour to spelt flour was a little difficult, and the result was good.  With a little more tweaking w/ the spelt, it would be great (that's why I rated 5 stars).  I used 6 T. cornstarch + enough white spelt flour to make 3 c. total and a little (2 T.) less milk.  Also used greased parchment to line the pans.  The result was a little more dense than others had noted, next time will add more cornstarch, maybe 1/2 c. total, to cut down the amount of protein in the spelt.  When I checked the cake at the earliest time, it looked really moist, so didn't test it.  Five min. later I checked with a toothpick and was almost overdone.  Next time will check early w/ toothpick.  Also, I made 2 9" cake pans and 8 cupcakes.  Extra treats for my husband- they went into the freezer after cooled.  Oh- anyone who has baked w/ spelt knows the liquid to dry ratio always needs some adjustments, so I have to say I got these results in Washington State (but not that humid this time of year) and at sea level.

Wanted to make this for hubbies b-day but ended up getting a store bought cake instead. Sounded good but end result is this recipe is a waste of time & money  - never got the whipped cream texture so I had to sub for canned whipped cream (only thing on hand), cake was so moist it stuck to cooling racks and middles fell out and they could not be salvaged so I ended up throwing away before I even got to cream cheese icing. At least I have a bunch of strawberries left for the kids.

This was a good cake....I used cisco and all purpose flour.  No stick and make sure everything is dry.  

Next time I will double the cream cheese and put over the entire cake them decorate with the whip cream and strawberries.  My husband wanted more strawberries in the cake itself.

This was a hit and the huge cake was almost gone.

The cake tasted fabulous.  If you are making it, make sure you have time.  I was in a hurry and probably didn't let the cake cool enough.  Between the moisture of the whipped cream and the strawberries, the layers slid and the cake cracked in three big pieces.  Tasted great though!

I love this cake! It's moist, flavorful and pretty. I added a layer of buttercream icing over the cream cheese for decorating purposes and it was wonderful. Thanks for posting. Great summertime dessert.

A little messy when it comes to the frosting oozing out of the sides, but besides from that this is a great cake. Everyone raved!

Oh my gosh. This cake was practically flawless. The cake itself was very moist and the cream and frosting both had a well-balanced sweetness. Absolutely amazing, I'm definitely making it again.

Everyone loves this cake!  I have started using a mix (oooh!) for the cake itself, because I don't like the thin, dense cake,tasty cake but sinks in the middle.  This could be my high altitude.  Everything else about the recipe always turns out perfect

I found this recipe to not be as easy as I expected. It took a lot of time. Make sure the cake is COMPLETELY cooled. To touch my cake was fine but as I was putting the frosting and filling on it became runny. I made the filling and frosting immediately after putting the cake in the oven. don't do that! the filling lost it's fluff and the frosting became warm from the heat in the kitchen. The cake looked nice but the flavor wasn't incredible. I would put a lot more strawberries between the layers and include the frosting on top as well. I had a lot of leftover frosting.

This cake was a hit at Moms-Night-Out, but a suggestion for any layered cake, is to slice across the top of each layer to make sure each layer is flat.  It will make the cake much easier to frost.

This is just way too good. I'm not a big "baker" but this is so easy to make. It's absolutely delicious. So far this month (July) I've made this 5 times and as a matter of fact, I'm in the process right now (the oven is pre-heating!) in making it again!

I used vanilla pudding instead of gelatin, which helped. The cake itself was still kinda chewy though. I also added raspberry pieces into the filling which were delicious! The cake tasted a lot better after letting it sit in the refrigerator overnight since the whip cream mix soaked into the cake and made it a lot moister. Overall it was pretty good. Next time I'll probably use more whip cream mix and see if there's anyway to make the cake a little fluffier and lighter.

The filling & frosting were delicious, but the cake was too dense & tough.  I put the dry jello into the cake mix.  Should I have made the jello for it to be better?

I made this cake for my husbands birthday.  This was the first time that I have made a cake from scratch.  It was easy & tasted great!  I will definitely use this recipe again.  Instead of topping it w/ quartered strawberries I used chocolate covered ones and then forked melted chocolate all over the cake.  It looked awesome!

this cake was very impressive to look at and tasty as well. I used pam to grease the pans and lightly processed the strawberries for the filling. it is very sweet and im wondering if vanilla pudding might work instead of the jello

Very sweet, not for the faint of heart!  Very tasty though!  I decorated it with strawberies and blueberries on top, and also added them to the filling in the middle.

I did make changes after reading the reviews. I only made two 9” layers, which was perfect. I didn’t use whip cream in between the layers-just a ring of cream cheese icing (my own recipe) and fresh strawberries with some seedless strawberry preserves. Everyone enjoyed it, but I wasn’t thrilled with the texture of the cake-too heavy & the color looked so fake. Next time I would make it without the jello, as some others had recommended. It was good...just could have been better...??

Even though I made a mistake, mixing the whipping cream into the cake batter, (I grabbed the wrong cup),  this is still one of the best cakes I’ve ever eaten.  I made it for my daughters 32 birthday. 
I can’t wait to make it again. Everyone raved about it.

This is the best cake I've ever made, I'm now known as the "cake lady" by the seniors in the area.  This cake is very light and  fluffy, and delicious. My daughter loves it.  I had a previous printed version of this cake and use 1 cup of softened butter for the frosting.

I have been looking for a good strawberry cake recipe for a while this, however, is not a good recipe it is a GREAT recipe.  I was a bit concerned after reading that some reviews calmed it to be rubbery.  I followed the recipe for the cake to the letter and it was perfect. Thank You

The strawberry  jello killed it, in a bad way. I tasted mostly jello. Everything else was delicious. I made 3 9 inch rounds 25 min and it was a bit dry... could have done maybe 20 min as the layers were not tall.

I found the cake too moist and sweet. It was really hard to cut and ended up a mess. A plain cake with the rest would be much better.

Thank you for sharing this recipe.  It did not turn out as I had hoped.  There was not enough batter to make three nice layers so next time I will increase the batter.  I am sure it will turn out better.  Thanks again.

This cake was delicious and very moist. I reduced the sugar to 1 cup based on other reviews. I baked mine at 360*F for a nice even top. I added some extra vanilla to the frosting and filling. I only made two 9" cakes, which were done in 20 minutes. I froze them, split them and alternated the filling and frosting with strawberries for layers. It was a very easy cake to assemble and will definitely be making it again! My boys loved it!

Everyone LOVED this cake!  I followed the recipe exactly, but changed how it was put together. 
I put the cream cheese frosting with the strawberries as the filling, then refrigerated it for 30 min before covering it with the whipped cream and additional strawberries.
I also put the finished cake in the freezer for 30 min - doing so "sets" the whipped cream but doesn't freeze the cake.
Both of those changes kept the filling from ooozing out and the cream from sliding off. 
Excellent recipe!

I definitely found this to have a gummy texture.  More like a dense pound cake than a traditional cake.  I did not make the whipped cream filling but I did make the cream cheese frosting.  I used only 2 cups of sugar in the frosting and found it to be plenty sweet.  I think it would have been inedible with 4 cups.  Overall though the texture was really off-putting.  I wouldn't make this again.

I thought the cake was delicious and appreciated that it had a TON of fresh strawberries in it (puree in batter, slices between the layers, decorative quarters on top).  
For some reason, my girls did not like it so much.

Looks great when done and easy to make.  However, this cake was so sweet, my kids didn't finish one piece.  I think if you go with sugar-free cool whip in between the layers it may help.  I don't know.  The cake itself was awesome, too bad.

The cake itself turned out okay, but even though I followed the instructions on how to make the frosting TO A TEE (I even threw mine out and had my mom remake it in case I was just doing something wrong).....  the frosting turned out liquid-y, not thick or fluffy like frosting is SUPPOSED to be.  I had to POUR the liquid "frosting" over the cake instead of spreading it on with a spatula.  The cake ended up looking really weird!  The "frosting" pretty much just splashed off.  What gives??????  Does anyone have any insights?  It looks like plenty of other people were able to make the frosting "correctly".  Someone email me at Elisa_Smith1@hotmail.com and let me know what's up.  =P

I really liked the frosting but I did 1 1/2 times the frosting and also used it instead of the whipping cream recipe for the middle layer. I also only did two layers. There wasn't enough mix for three. Then I pureed some strawberries and added them to the middle layer. That way my cake didn't slide. The cake was too dense so I will either sift it the next time or use a box mix. It was too much sugar so I took off 1/2 cup of sugar and only used 1/2 the amount of gelatin. Next time I will probably use the whole gelatin and take off 1 cup of sugar. I also used vanilla and almond in the cake and frosting. It gave it a very good taste. The cake still turned out very good.

This cake was well worth the time, money & energy I put into it. I am not a baker, but I figured if I was going to make a cake from scratch I was going to do it right.
I used 3 Wilton 9" cake pans and Wilton Cake Release (in the baking aisle) and the cakes came out beautifully, no problem whatsoever with sticking. I also used Wilton 10" cake circles to let the cakes rest on. Again, I'm not a professional, but I figured paper would be the best thing for the cakes to cool on. 
I did not do a cream cheese frosting, like a lot of the others I thought it would be too heavy for the cake. Instead of the 12 oz of heavy whipping cream I used 16 and mixed in a bit of Cool Whip to make it stretch even more. 
All recipes are not cut and dry, mix it up a bit and add your own personal touches. I guarantee if you tweak any recipe it will turn out great ;)

This cake was a disappointment. It had a terrible, tough texture that ruined what decent flavor it had. I think it must have been the strawberry flavored gelatin. If I make this again, I will try using a teaspoon or so of strawberry extract and omit the gelatin.

I made it without the frosting as well. After tasting the batter and realizing how sweet it was I desided to use whipped cream instead of frosting.  The cake is really moist and a pretty pink color, which worked well for my little girls birthday party.  Sifting the flour and using quick dissolve sugar makes the cake light and fluffy.

Fabulous recipe. I was a bit dubious about the gelatine, but the cake was really delicious. I did cut back on the sugar in the cake, only use 1 1/2 cups instead of two. And I never used any butter in the topping. I used cream cheese, icing sugar , vanilla paste and a dash of ideal milk in the topping. I think next time I may leave the gelatine out  so that its lighter and less dense.  But all in all a really nice cake. Thanks

I made this cake exactly as is written, except 1.5 x the whipped cream, which I stabilized with gelatin so it would stay firm longer. I also piped a ring of cream cheese frosting around each layer to keep the cream from oozing out the sides. It was amazing, and I wouldn't change a thing. Brought it to Bunco, and everyone raved about it. Makes such a lovely presentation. The cake was very moist, and the cream cheese frosting coupled with the whipped cream made it perfect.

I give this cake only 2 stars for the presentation. Followed the recipe to the T for the cake portion and the cake came out heavy and dense. I had opted for a light and refreshing frosting and made a whipped cream frosting. I did some research about dense cakes and many sources had cited that perhaps the leavening powder could be old, but I had baked another cake a few days before that for Mother's Day and that cake was extremely light and fluffy. I was excited as this cake got such high ratings but in the end it didn't turn out as I had hoped.

This was my first attempt at a cake from scratch and I think it came out well. It was easy to follow directions but it really was a bit much. I will make it again and I think  it will be even better. I could not find Strawberry puree in any of my local stores so I had to settle for pie filling.I think this did make the cake a bit heavier but the taste was not bad at all

I made it by request for a friend's birthday.  Over 40 guests were served and the accolades were unending.  A very good cake!  I followed the instructions accordingly.

Definitely better with fresh berries.  I used frozen and it didn't seem to mesh well.

My daughter wanted a special strawberry cake for her baptism dinner so I picked this one from the Internet just because the picture looked so good. I did not know how good the cake would turn out. It was delicious, beautiful, and it was gone very quickly.  Now I have friends asking me to make it for them.  It was soooo good.

I did a half batch in two 8" pans and the layers were thin (as expected) but it did work. The texture and taste weren't that great the night I baked them, but since it was for a group of four year olds I figured they wouldn't be that discerning and would mostly appreciate the pink colour. Turns out that once it was layered and frosted the next morning with the 'Sturdy Whipped Cream Frosting' from this site, it actually was pretty good!

Delicious and moist. I made it with Ener-G egg replacer and Blue Bonnet Light due to allergies to egg and dairy and it was still amazing. I used regular flour and  I can't imagine it being any better with cake flour. I put a strawberry puree in-between layers along with the frosting recipe (I used dairy-free cream cheese for the frosting). I used strawberry store bought frosting for the outside. I did not use the whipped cream due to the food allergies, but the strawberry puree/frosting mix was amazing. It didn't really even need frosting on the outside. I will make this again.

I made this cake for my hubby for his birthday, he always has strawberry cake. This year I wanted to make him a homemade one. This was by far the best strawberry cake we've ever had. It was moist and the flavor was delicious.

Made this for a birthday party but used the Heavenly White Cake from this site so I wouldn't have a pink cake(mens birthday cake). I did use the cream cheese frosting and the whipped cream and strawberries filling. I didn't have any but the recipients loved it!

The cake itself was awesome, but the directions weren't exactly clear. Wasn't quite sure how much sugar to use for the cake itself. Ended up using 4 cups of powder sugar for the cake before realizing that the powder sugar was for the frosting. Either way the cake turned out awesomely terrific. Still need clarification on how much sugar is needed for the cake itself.

This cake took quite a while to bake. However it was really amazing. It was very sweet but instead of cream cheese icing I made buttercream just because we didn't have any cream cheese. But I think that's why it was so sweet. I love how pink it was it was very cute. And I read the reviews before I baked the cake and I made two layers as opposed to three and im glad I did. It took a lot of work to icing just the two of them and even cutting the cake it was really moist and literally fell apart in my fork. It was AMAZING. definitely saving this recipe.

I have to be honest.  I did not like this cake at all.  The flavor was underwhelming and the texture was unappealing.  I have decades of baking experience and I know I followed the recipe precisely.  So it wasn't baker's error.  In the future I think I will try a recipe without the jello component (maybe strawberry Kool Aid instead to avoid the gelatin?).

I made this for my boyfriend's birthday. He and his family LOVED it! It was delicious. I think my favorite part was the frosting; it was divine. His family loved it so much that his sister asked me to make it for her birthday too! This cake will not disappoint. Definitely make it.
The only change I made was that I made it two layers instead of three. It seems to work better as a 9-inch two-layer cake.

Wow...I could not stop eating this cake.  I made no substitutions.  I had a hard time putting the icing on the outside, but I almost always do.  The cake came out slightly dry but the strawberry and whipped cream filling in the layers and the cream cheese icing on the outside took it to the perfect moisture level.  I think if the cake was any less dry it would have turned out soggy once it was assembled.  I do not normally like cream cheese icing and only made it for my husband but, I loved this icing.  I can't wait to have an excuse to make this again.

Everyone loved it!  My son asked for Strawberry cake for his birthday.  Although it is pink on the inside I had white frosting and I put a few super heroes on the top.  I'd never made it before.  It turned out great.  I used 3 8" round pans.  It was really tall but pretty.  My father-in-law requested it for his birthday.

This cake is delightful! I made a fourth of the frosting to pipe the top, cut the sugar by a third (I ran out), and thought it was divine. As I had a lot of strawberries, I added extra.  The cake turned out dense, but fluffy. The only problem was that it was extremely rich; you certainly can't comfortably finish a regular slice of this cake.

I was really happy to find this recipe again!  I'd made this cake many times, then lost it.  It is a great crowd/kid pleaser and makes a beautiful presentation on a pedestal cake plate.  Well worth a little extra effort!

I absolutely love this recipe! It takes a little time to do, but its pretty simple. It went over so well with my boyfriend's family, that they want me to make it again for their birthdays!

This was a wonderful cake!  It looks beautiful.I only wish there was a way to make it lighter texture.  It is a very dense cake but very good.I will make it again.

This is a Wonderful cake. I made this for my family and gave some to a friend and now she wants me to make it again for her family, You can't find very many cakes that don't call for a box mix,I have been looking for a scratch cake and I'm glad I found this one.

This was my first homeade cake and it was absolutely delicious! This is a very easy recipe to follow and it is fun to make. My family thought I must have bought it from a bakery, they still don't believe that I made it!

Everyone was impressed with the presentation of this cake.  It's not much work to get the result.  My kids, aged 10, 7, 6, all loved it.  I did not add the pureed stawberries to cake because I knew the kids wouldn't like it.  Obviously, it's great without it and it cuts down on one step.
