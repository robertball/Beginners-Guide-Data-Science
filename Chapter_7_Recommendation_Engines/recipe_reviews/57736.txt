Always trust your instincts! A TABLESPOON of garlic powder?  For two cans of peas?  The result is inedible; and we like garlic.  I'm trying to salvage it by adding more ingredients, but I have a feeling I'll be throwing it out.

My family loved these. I left the rice and cheese on the side for so that people could add them if they wanted too.

Actually made this last week just for something different-turned out pretty good! I used a chuck of leftover ham instead of the jowl but that was the only change. Will try adding cabbage next time.

I made this recipie and just loved it!!  I am a Southern gal and needed to make my Black-Eyed peas for the New Year.  I used Bushes black-eyed peas, less butter and added a little cream cheese...not too much.  It was great.  I am not a fan of bell peppers, so I left them out. I highly recomend this recipie.

Usually, we have black eyed peas left over.  Today we did not.  I used the butter, 1 onion, 1/2 of a green pepper and a bag of frozen black eyed peas.  We had sausage left over from our trip to our favorite barbecue place last night, so that took the place of both the sausage and the hog jowl.  After reading the reviews, I used a teaspoon of garlic pepper; it could have used 2 tsp.  But otherwise, was very tasty.  We didn't use the rice or cheese.   The directions on the frozen black eyed peas said to boil for 3 mins and simmer for 40 to 45 mins.   They were perfectly cooked at that time.

My husband is not a fan of black-eyed peas, but he ate every bite on his plate.  Thank you for sharing a wonderful recipe to start the new year!

This recipe was a hit on New Year's Day since we have to serve Black-Eyed Peas for my Texas family.  I did not have sausage or a "ham hock" but used thick sliced cooked bacon and that was awesome.  I did not add rice or cheese since we have so much other food to serve that day (pork roast, mashed potatoes, green beans, etc.)  I cooked it for a long time and the beans got very soft and tender.  By the way I used a whole big bag of FROZEN Black-eyed Peas, easy!

I loved this!  I used 12 oz. sausage to make up for not having the hog jowl, used 3/4 c. rice, and added garlic and parsley.

I never ate black eyed peas before but wanted to start the year with good luck. I had to omit the bell pepper. I substituted diced leftover Christmas ham for the smoked sausage and a smoked pork neck bone for the hog jowl, I also added a bay leaf. Last, I used chicken broth instead of the water and brown rice instead of white. My husband and both agreed this "was perfect". I realize I made a lot of changes from the original recipe but without the original, I never could have made this wonderful dish. Thank you I. Tucker.

This was a good and quick recipe!  I ended up using a third can of peas, added a bay leaf and left the rice and cheese to the side so you could add as much as you like.  We ate the whole pot!

Well, I found this recipe and thought it looked interesting and tasty, so I decided to give it a whirl. I did make some slight modifications, however. Since I have a larger family, I doubled the recipe...(except for the garlic. I too thought 1 TB was plenty, even for the larger portion and I LOVE garlic!!) I was given a turkey for Christmas, but since we went to the family's house I didn't make it till the other night. So, I used the leftovers instead of sausage. (I'm not a fan of sausage) and since I have NO IDEA how I could get a hog jowl, I just used leftover pork chops that we had in the fridge seasoned with some BBQ rub and Tony Chachere's. I did add the cabbage since I was looking for a black eyed pea and cabbage recipe and I cooked the peas instead of using canned. Other than that, I added the rest the ingredients in this recipe. I didn't add the rice and cheese to the meal, I made the rice, added the cheese to that and had it on the side. I'd have to say that it was a big hit at my house. With 3 teenage boys, a pre-teen finicky girl, a 26 and 22 yr old son and daughter-in-law and myself, it was something I'll have to Pin to have again!

Made this tonight and it was just OK. The proportions of the ingredients seem off to me and definitely NOT 1 tablespoon of garlic powder.  Seasoned cooks would know this but novices would not.  Hope someone will change that. IF I made it again, which I probably won't, I would use frozen peas, a bit more rice and cheese and definitely more liquid i.e. chicken broth with the water.  Also the directions are not well written - do you cover or not? It is best to saute the onion, sausage and green peppers before adding the rest.  Just not a well written recipe in my opinion.

Easy recipe and very good.  I added more water and uncooked rice the last 20 minutes because I didn't want to wash another pot!  Turned out fine.

I made this as written but without the hog jowl because I didn't have any. It was still great. Will make it next New Year's Day.

My family loved this! I added more rice, chicken and shrimp so it was more like a jambalaya type recipe. It is now our family's traditional New Years Day Dinner.

I didn't have bell peppers.  I reduced the garlic powder.  It turned out really great.  I will make this again :)

Made this with a few changes. Cut the butter to 2 TBSP, used andouille sausage instead of smoked. Used 4 ounces of ham instead of ham hock. Used 1/2 cup habanero shredded chesse instead of cheddar. Still a little soupy so we served over more rice.
