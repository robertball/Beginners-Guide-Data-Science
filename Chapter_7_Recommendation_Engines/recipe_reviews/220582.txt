This is an interesting recipe.  My hubby liked it more than I did, probably because I thought the texture was just a little different than what I am used to.  It was all eaten up, so I can't complain at all!  I made half of what was called for, following the recipe otherwise.  I did add a touch of Tajin to the finished product.  I would make this again.  Thanks for the recipe!
