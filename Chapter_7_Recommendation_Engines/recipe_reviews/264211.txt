Needs salt and garlic powder! Will add 1/4tsp salt (at least) and a tsp garlic powder, a little onion powder and a little fresh parsley next time.

I have made this recipe several times now. It is the best Keto bread I have found. I have tried muffin shape, small tart pan size (which works great for hamburgers or sandwiches) and wrapped the raw dough around hot dog and baked. It has been great every time.

This recipe was really easy to make and delicious. I did add some garlic and onion powder, salt and a pinch of black pepper.  I also replaced the half-&-half for heavy cream. Biscuits came out perfect and very tasty.

Not to bad once I added granulated garlic, bacon , and sea salt. I also cooked them in a cupcake pan sprayed with olive oil , they were perfect. Thanks for the base.

It’s a bit eggy, but that can happen with these things. I added a lot of garlic and Italian seasonings to try and mask the egg flavor & made slightly bigger portions to use my muffin top pan.

I've made a regular version of cheddar bay biscuits and these are really close.  I added a half teaspoon of salt and garlic powder then brushed them with melted garlic butter when they came out of the oven.  they were really good!

This is a fantastic bread substitute. I make a batch of these every week and put them in the refrigerator. I take one out a day to eat with breakfast-one is big enough for me and my husband. I also add a chopped green onion and a different season mix each batch. They're delicious and filling and look, feel, and taste like bread. This is a great Keto recipe.

Very good biscuit.  Definitely needs more seasoning.  I think I will add more salt and garlic.  I may need to try some Cheyenne pepper as well.

I made it as stated, but used a muffin tin. I used muffin papers, which was a mistake. Need to use a spray next time.

this is a straight forward almond flour recipe. I used mozzarella and gruyere cheese, it was ok. Next time it will be sharp cheddar and more of it. I want it cheesy

Definitely easy and worth making. Needs salt and possibly garlic and/or onion. After two years on the Keto diet I've finally found something I'll be making on a regular basis, thank you!

I was skeptical as we’ve tried a lot of terrible bread, but these are good!
I only made half a batch to see if we would like them.  I made them as is, but I did add salt and pepper.  These would be very versatile to make savory, with roasted garlic or even sweet with some honey or maple syrup, nuts  and/or  dried fruit.  Thank you Valerie for sharing your recipe!

Good base recipe. I made a few changes that turned out great. 
Replaced the half n half with heavy cream and added salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Also made sure to use a sharp cheddar. Ended up with a yummy garlic cheddar biscuit.

I usually make  cheddar biscuits with AP flour, so I was nervous about trying these with almond flour. Well, they came out delicious! To the dry ingredients, I added a dash each of salt, pepper, and garlic powder. I used 3 duck eggs instead of 4 chicken eggs, and heavy cream instead of half-and-half, because I had those ingredients on hand. I also brushed the warm, baked biscuits with a little bit of melted garlic herb butter. I will definitely make this again!

I made these and only added a tsp of garlic salt. They are delicious!  I wondered what is the best way to store them?  Also, I can’t figure out the net carbs listed for the recipe because I just count 16 carbs of almond flour and 7 carbs in the baking powder.  23/9=2.6?

I made this today but added a little garlic powder to the recipe. They are kind of bland and were much better if I put butter on them. My batch made more than 9. Also, I'm not sure how to store them, in the fridge or just on the counter.

Loved this.  My husband loved it and so did  my 12 year old.  I did read thru reviews first so I did add some garlic salt and a half a lb of sausage.  It made 12 biscuits.  This is such an easy recipe I will be making this again!

This was so good! Non-Keto guests loved them. I added garlic and a touch of salt like other reviews suggested. Will make again!

For Keto biscuit, this is the best I've found.  I did make some changes 2nd time around:

1.  Added 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
2.  Added 1/2 teaspoon salt
3.  Added two finely chopped jalapeño peppers

And third time around I added 1/4 teaspoon cajun seasoning, which I think added a bit more depth.  

Fantastic with sausage and eggs for breakfast.

I make half a recipe for my husband and I and get 4 muffins when using a muffin pan. Remember to spray pan first. I also add Italian seasonings to mine.

I added crisped fried ham to the recipe.  Hubby said it could use a little salt and some pepper.  I think this recipe is versatile enough to use with any ingredient substitutions.

Based on other comments, I added about 1/2 t of salt and used cream. They were terrific!  I topped with with sausage gravy, which made a wonderful cheesy slight eggy breakfast dish.

I added some breakfast sausage, garlic powder, and minced onion.   I bet mushrooms would taste good also!  Great recipe!

I made these hamburger bun size. I added salt and pepper, garlic powder along with a little dill.  Brushed with butter after baking.  They were great!  Making biscuits this morning to eat with eggs, added salt and pepper...

Very bland with a strange aftertaste like burnt eggs. Needs salt and probably onion and garlic powder.  Might work as a sandwich bread but not great solo. The texture works though, and it's fairly fluffy for a flourless biscuit.

I didn’t have half and half so I used whole milk since that’s what I had on hand. Also substituted most of the almond flour with coconut since I was running low on almond flour. I thought they came out a little dry but husband loved them, especially with butter. They looked a little crumbly but held together really well. I was surprised on all counts.

I had made a delicious beef stew and needed some biscuits to go with it. These were a HUGE hit. I even forgot to add the half and half and they turned out crispy and delicious and 9 was not enough.

Instant of wheat flour  ,I used gluten free flour and added flax seed flour.  Next time I will use one kind of flour.  They were good for the first time making them.
