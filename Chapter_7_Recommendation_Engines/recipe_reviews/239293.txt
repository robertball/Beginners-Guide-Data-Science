The cookies are very tasty but they are a little too gooey (I realize that gooey is in the title) but they fall apart and stick to whatever surface they are on. I'm going to try it with less butter to see if it helps.

I chose to cut the caramels into tidbit pieces (1 square =8).  I reasoned that such a large batch of cookies, there wouldn't be enough caramels to go around! It was a success. I also found the batter too salty so added 2/3 cup extra sugar. First batch just oozed into each other. 3rd batch I accidentally overcooked (11 min) but were better. I baked next 3 batches (it DOES make a lot!) 9 minutes. Not every cookie had caramel in it. Those that did, caramel oozed out, scorching onto bake sheet. Parchment paper is a must use! It's the ONLY  way to prevent sticking to bake sheet, to each other & everything else. The cookies in the tin softened overnight resulting in pretty much an eat-with-a-spoon giant cookie. And they didn't rise & could've used more cinnamon flavour. Not happy with this recipe.

After reading other reviews and taking a look at the original personal recipe, I attempted to make these cookies. I will note that I did use gluten free flour.  The batter was very wet so I added an extra 1/2 cup of flour. I also used 1 and about 3/4 large honeycrisp apples. For the caramel, I used caramel bits (that I also froze) instead of cutting up the caramels. My cookie dough was refrigerated overnight. When baking I did need to add extra baking time. The final cookie resulted in a moist cake like cookie with chewy caramel bits when cooled. The flavor needs help, I can agree it could use more cinnamon. We were not huge fans.

I have to say these are beyond yummy but, they are also a hot mess! I got so annoyed with them that I threw the rest of the dough on a sheet and I am hoping for the best. These will not be added to my fall recipes that is for sure.

As suggested by another review, I diced the caramels into 8 pieces each.  The cookies were yummy and only a little gooey.  I will definitely make them again, but next time, I will try substituting margarine for 1/2 of the butter to reduce the flattening.
