Excellent! Made a few changes though- Added 1 peeled, seeded and chopped cucumber and a 14 oz.  can of artichoke hearts in water. Looks gorgeous as well as tastes good! Very recommended!

This is as delicious as it is healthy.  It also tasted even better after a couple of days.
Try it.  You'll like it!

I bought pre-cut cauliflower & broccoli crowns & omitted the olives.  I think this would be nice to bring to a picnic as a change from a lettuce salad or coleslaw.  You probably could add other vegetables, like zucchini, etc. too.  I'm going to look for a light, zesty Italian dressing, next time I make it & see which version I like better.

Had this for dinner tonight and my family loved it.  I didn't add as much dressing and added cucumber as well.  Just the same it was very nice and healthy!

One of my guests loved it, everyone else was lukewarm. If you are a feta lover, this is a good recipe. Since my husband and I are not, we probably will not make this again.

I added marinated artichokes to this recipe. It was an interesting, unique addition to our pot luck. Left overs didn't stay great in the fridge for long (maybe a day or so).

Great salad.  I am always asked for the recipe.  I also have added artichokes, cucumber, zucchini and yellow squash.  I use greek dressing when I can find it.  Any veggie addition would be a plus.

This was awesome!  I cut the broccoli and cauliflower up in small bite sized pieces and blanched it.  I used kalamata olives, added some diced seeded cucumber and red onion.  I also used a greek salad dressing.  Got rave reviews and there wasn't any left!

I really like it. I did cook the broccoli and cauliflower a little first, so they were tender and added cucumbers and artichoke hearts. And instead of Italian dressing I used Mediterranean vinaigrette,Tuscan Romano Basil from wish bone......very good choice.

Pretty tastey! This is a nice side salad. My only suggestion is to chop the veggies small enough. I will make again.

I love this recipe!  I make two changes though.  I blanch the cauliflower and broccoli and rather than zesty italian dressing, I use "Absolutely Fabulous Greek/House Dressing" from this site.

This is a great beginning!  I am from Greece and I MUST add red sliced onions and cucumber cubes along with oregano to taste.  Also, there is a brand of Greek dressing available (SOMETIMES BY INTERNET) called "Gazebo Room", favored by Tipper Gore, which is so pure that it needs no refrigeration.  It is the perfect dressing for this recipe!  Enjoy!

Used sundried tomato basil dressing instead of Italian and just enough to coat.  Next time, I think I'll blanch the veggies for just a minute or two.

A very visually appealing salad!  I blanched the broccoli and cauliflower by pouring boiling water over them because I enjoy the vegetables more that way.  Kalamata olives were my choice. I tossed with Italian Dressing Mix from this site, using far less than 16 ounces of dressing. This would be a star at a potluck!

Like some others, I threw the broccoli and cauliflower in some boiling water for a minute or so and then rinsed with cold water.  Dumped them out onto a towel to drain well.  I also added a zucchini.  (didn't cook it.) It just looked as though ithe salad needed the zuke.  I made the Greek dressing from this site, but will try next time with bottled Italian.  I made it 24 hours in advance.  Even though my vegetables were well drained, there was a lot of liquid in the bottom of the bowl at the end of the meal.  Also, the broccoli was no longer bright green.

I love to make this salad when I am doing a simple entree, such as a rotisserie chicken. I find the broccoli and cauliflower a bit overpowering unless I steam them very quickly before making the salad.

Full of flavor!  I added more Feta and only used 1/2 the dressing. Kids and Hubby loved it so you know it's gonna be a repeat recipe!

This is a delicious recipe! I was trying to get more veggies into my diet and this recipe was just perfect. I had it for an afternoon snack every day this week. The only change I made was to use Greek dressing instead of Italian.

Delicious and healthy dish, but I would recommend using Kalamata olives in lieu of regular black olives. Will give a zestier flavour to the mix!

This was very good and marinating over night is a must!  Really soaks in the flavor and softens the veggies up just enough...I did add fresh basil.  This is a keeper...thanks!

Excellent. I did blanch the cauliflower and broccoli for about a minute as my husband doesn't like them completely raw. I used Italian Dressing Mix from this site for the dressing. One guest kept going out to the kitchen after we'd finished eating to just have a little bit more. Definitely a repeat. Many Thanks.

Very good, and healthy!  I used Lite Italian, and have never used feta cheese, so I used shredded tomato basil mozerella...it is wonderful, and I'm having it today for lunch!  Yummy!

My family said this was like a great chicken potpie without the bread. We do a lot of low carb foods and this is a good recipe for that.

I made this salad today to take to a barbeque and I can't wait to see what people say!!!  Unlike some, I did NOT cook the cauliflour and broccoli but chopped them fairly fine.  I also added a can of artichoke hearts, although next time I will add the more flavorful jarred artichokes.  I added one bunch of green onions to the recipe,  You could use oil and balsamic vinegar dressing to this instead of the Italian dressing, which is what I did.  Cucumbers would be delicious, although I didn't have any.  Make sure you cut the seeds out first so that they aren't too mushy.  Finally, Kalamata olives are a MUST!!!  I LOVED THIS!!!  Let's hope the dinner guests do too!!

This is a great and refreshing salad - simple and easy to make.  If you purchase the pre-cut veggies, this is a throw together side for any occassion.  Since I am not a fan of olives, I omitted them.  Next time, I am going to try making it with the new Greek Vinagrette salad dressing.  I will defintely make this again.

Absolutely wonderful. Be careful on adding the zesty Italian salad dressing. It’s easier to add more than to take it out once added. ;-)

Great blend of flavors!  My family didn't even notice all of the veggies they'd normally never eat!

This was good, and it fit for the bill for a salad using broccoli and cauliflower.  I did omit the olives, due to personal tastes.  I used a lot less Italian dressing.  I only used enough to 'wet' the salad.  Served this with 'Summer Seasoned String Beans' from AR and garlic bread with sliced tomatoes, popped under the broiler.

The recipe mostly depends on the quality of the dressing used.

It was just ok.  Did not like the broccoli or cauliflower in it.  Best to not mess with the real thing.

I used a Greek Vinaigrette dressing, though I didn't need the entire bottle. I love this salad!

It was OK. I think it tasted fine, but it wasn't a real hit with the guests.

Very good.  The feta cheese somehow rounds out the flavors.  I tried using ranch dressing and it was still good.
