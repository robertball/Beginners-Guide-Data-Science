Although I made some changes, I am rating this more for myself.  I used miracle whip, personal preference.  Also mixed in some garlic powder, pepper and dried basil.  I then rolled the chicken pieces in the parmesan cheese.  I left out the bread crumbs altogether.  I had sliced the chicken breast into 4 pieces to have more coating so the cooking time was good for me.  Very nice flavor, quick and easy.  A keeper.

This was so much better than expected.  I am nervous about serving rare/raw chicken so I cooked for 45 min at 350 degrees (accurate for my oven, at least) and my husband loved it.  Loved it!  I was a little weary about using mayonnaise but the finished product really was delicious.  I added some salt & pepper and served with peas & carrots, and a dinner roll.  Delicious!  Makes a great, balanced meal and can be calorie controlled for those who wish.

I’m generally very impressed with Hellmann’s recipes, but this time not so much.  So I changed it up big time I guess.  I salted and peppered the chicken breasts, then spread them with mayonnaise to which I added fresh minced garlic.   I mixed panko bread crumbs and the grated Parmesan in a ratio of 2:1, and added fresh oregano, parsley and rosemary, topping each of the chicken breasts as the recipe directs.  I gave them a drizzle of  olive oil before popping them in the oven.  I much preferred that method and those fresh ingredients rather than mixing the cheese in with the mayonnaise and using Italian seasoned bread crumbs which I don’t think I would have cared for.  I sliced the chicken and served it over “Spinach Ranch Salad,” also from this site, and “Broccoli Cheese Soup V.”

This is such a great recipe! My Mom used to make this all the time when I was a kid. I usually go an egg wash, but I thought I'd give the mayo a try just for old times sake and to see what my husband thought. I used more bread crumbs and added more seasoning to to them (parsley, oregano, basil, rosemary). I also opted to use Hellman's light mayo and light Parmesan cheese. I sprayed the bottom of the baking dish with Pam so nothing would stick and these came out moist and delicious - perfect with a side of twice baked potates and a salad.

Tastey recipe.  I used exact ingredients in recipe) but prepared a little differently because of lack of time.  I rolled chicken in mayo and dipped them in mixture of parmesan and bread crumbs.  I then cooked it on a george foreman grill.  I've never tried anything breaded on my GF grill, but it turned out perfectly and took less than 10 minutes cook time!  By the way, I used PANKO Italian seasoned bread crumbs which have a much better texture than regular bread crumbs.

Omg! This was to die for! I always read the other reviews and many times revise the recipe based on the other ones, but I didn't change much on this one. I added some spices (oregano, parsley, garlic, salt & pepper) my husband loved it, I loved it too, and I'm not a big fan of meat, but this really was amazing! It's a keeper!

Wonderful! I added more seasonings to the Mayo mix: seasoning salt, garlic powder, dash of cayenne and some lemon pepper.. coated chicken in mayo mix, and tossed them in a ziplock with bread crumbs. Sprinkle some paprika on top for a fancier look.. baked on rack over cookie sheet so the bottoms didn't get soggy- there are none for leftovers! will be making this again.

This was delicious. I put the chicken and mayo mixture in a bag and coated, then put the coated chicken into another bag with the bread crumbs (I used more than it called for, for a thicker crust) so the chicken was evenly coated, not just on the top.
My husband (who hates mayo) loved it, didn't even know it had mayonnaise ;)

I added parsley, oregano, and garlic powder to the cheese/mayo mix. I cut the chicken in half, then salt and peppered the chicken. I rolled the chicken in the cheese/mayo mix, then coated in Italian bread crumbs. For thick breasts, it took about 30 minutes at 425. Perfection!

wow...i've been seeing this recipe on t.v. commercials lately, wanted to try it.  didn't want to go to grocery store today, so used what i had on hand.  had chicken tenders thawed out so used them.  i didn't have italian bread crumbs, so used my plain ones and added italian seasoning.  i pat dry the tenders and did brush the mayo (ONLY HELLMANN'S IS ALLOWED IN MY HOUSE! :D) and parmesan cheese on both sides, topped with bread crumbs and baked.  served with scalloped potatoes and green beans. WOW THIS RECIPE IS SO EASY AND MOST DEFINITELY A KEEPER!

Excellent!!   Made as is, but as a personal preference, I breaded my chicken completely with panko bread crumbs then added topping!

We LOVED this recipe! It was moist and flavorful - and my usually picky husband had nothing but praise to say. :) I followed the other reviewer's suggestion and dipped it in the mayonnaise mixture and then the cheese mixture to coat the whole thing. Excellent! I will definitely be making this one again! :)

I enjoyed the taste of the seasoning, but the amount of mayo actually made the breading quite soggy.  Definitely going to add less Hellmann's than the recipe calls for.

I buy hard boiled eggs. The kitchen is that room with the big sink. I just tried this and it was amazingly easy and I've never had chicken this good anywhere! I'm so proud of myself, this is definitely my go to dish if I need to impress

I made this recipe last week from the Hellmann's site. It was so simple, easy and good. Definitely a new addition to the BSCB book. Dinner in 20? Yes!

Great for a busy week night meal.  Easy, quick, and very tasty.  The mayo does not overpower at all and my whole family (picky eaters included) loved this.

Everyone loved this one! They already want me to make it again. I probably used a bit more mayo and parm than the recipe called for and I sprinkled Italian herb seasoning on as well. My kids thought it was the best chicken EVER!

Honestly, this was just ok. It really tasted just like Shake n Bake. Pretty cheap tasting. I followed the recipe to a T. I'm not sure how so many people thought this was so amazing. Go buy a bag of pistachios or macadamia nuts, crush them up, add in the parmesan, some italian herbs and spices and coat the chicken with that. So much tastier and about the same price!

Very good, I changed it up a little bit. I left out the bread crumbs. First I wrapped the chicken in bacon then I spread the mayo parm mixture on top. So yummy, my husband says it's his favorite meal.

Disgusting. I like mayo and salad dressing on chicken sandwiches so I thought this would be a good recipe. My husband, my 7 yr old (who's not a picky eater at all) and myself all thought this was just gross. BEWARE!!!

I made this recipe & it turned out GREAT, it was tasty, easy & fast to make. Even though the recipe doesn't call for it, be sure to season your raw chicken breast before you add the mayo mixture & bread crumbs or it may taste a bit bland. I seasoned my chicken w/Lawry's, garlic powder, black pepper & a little thyme. I also cooked it for 30 mins, instead of 20 as the recipe states, doing that made the crust crispier & less mushy.

Yum! This was sooooo easy and very tasty. My 1 and 4 year olds loved this chicken. I couldn't get enough. I rolled the chicken in the mixture (lightmayo, parmesan). I added garlic powder, sea salt, pepper, dried basil and dried oregeno to my plain bread crumbs then sprinkled it over the chicken. 20 minutes at 425 was spot on, but I left it in a few minutes longer because I'm so afraid of undercooked chicken. I think it was fine at 20 minutes though. I will be making this for my family again and again. Thank you for a GREAT recipe that takes no time to whip up.

It was really good.  I used 2 pounded out to make thinner breasts and just eyeballed the amount of ingredients to use. Next time I will use a gravy or sauce to put on them.  My hubby thought using cream of chicken (or mushroom) soup and add lemon juice to the soup would be nice and fast.  That's kinda of a staple in his family (Greek) for dolmades.  I probably used about 1/4 cup parmesan tho.  I also added garlic powder to the mayo/cheese mix. Used paper plates, for the mayo mix on one and crumbs on other (can throw away those those plates instead of washing them).

This concept works really well on fish filets, too. I added a little lemon juice and garlic powder, spoon on tilapia and baked about 20 minutes. Delicious! I make this often with rice and a green vegtable for dinner, and it takes so little time, and is very impressive.

This is a good basic recipe for parmesan chicken. However I did have to change the recipe a little bit to have my family eat it. I added garlic powder and black pepper. I used quite a bit because my family loves those two spices. Make sure you use mayo not mircle whip it changes the flavor completly! I used about a cup and a half of bread crumbs instead of 4 teaspoons because that is just not enough.

I can't say that it was a particularly eye-appealing dish, but I can say that the taste is delicious.  Moist, tasty chicken which is so easy to get on the table.  We definitely will be having again.

This was incredibly TASTY! No revising done either. Normally most Parmesan chicken I make REALLY takes on a strong flavor of the cheese but this was just so beautifully flavored I would give it more than 5 stars if I could. We will definitely be making this one again for the family. It felt like we were eating at a nice restaurant:D Thank you so much for sharing this!

this is really good chicken!  I cut the breasts in half just for quickness in cooking.  I spread the mayo/parm mixture on both sides of the chicken & put the bread crumbs only on the top.  I did end up baking it for 27-28 min, but only b/c I wanted the crumbs to be a browned a lil more.  This will be a keeper for our menu box.

Super easy and very flavorful....I will admit I added a bit of onion powder, garlic powder, and italian seasoning into my mayo mix. I covered with foil for the first 20 minutes and then took off the foil and let it bake some more for the last 15 minutes and it was quite crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside. Yum

All I can say is WOW!  This was SO good I couldn't believe it!  The chicken was really moist and the flavor was great!  I did prepare it the day before and let it sit in the fridge with the may/cheese topping over night, adding Panko bread crumbs just before baking.  You could also add some seasoning this to jazz it up, but it is really good as is!

5 stars really isn't enough!!!  Instead of seasoned bread crumbs I used Panko seasoned with various spices .  Instead of measuring the mayo, I just eyeballed and rubbed it sparingly over the chicken.  Enough though to cover and hold the Panko.  And I baked it on my cookie cooling rack over a baking sheet.  Everyone loved it and it was so, so moist, tender and crispy!!!!!  Thank you!!!!

So delicious!  I used fat-free mayo and a reduced fat parmesan to make it healthier.  The dish turned out moist and full of flavor!  An added plus is there aren't a ton of dishes to clean up by following the preperation method given!

I add alittle garlic and cayenne to mine as well as a crushed cracker/pretzel crust in place of the bread crumbs (using pretzel and crackers helps use up food you already have and limits unneccesary additional purchases) .  Andt really gives it a special touch and crunch. I also lightly coat mine in mayo then coat in the parm/pretzel/cracker mixture. basically same recipe just alittle different assembly style.

This was delicious!  I did season the chicken with powdered onion and garlic, kosher salt and fresh ground pepper.  Instead of Parmesan cheese I used fresh Le Gruyere cheese I bought from Costco.  This was an excellent, easy recipe.  Thanks!  I forgot the bread crumbs the first time I made it and it was still delish.  The second time I made my own crumbs and it was superb!

This recipe is great as-is,  though I find that I always need more of the mayo-parmesan mixture and especially the bread crumbs to fully cover the chicken. (That is probably because most of the chicken breasts sold where I live are bigger than 5 oz.) 

A couple more tips: Be sure to pat down the bread crumbs so they stick well and don't fall off. Use a thermometer to ensure that the chicken is done - big chicken breasts can take 30 minutes or even longer to get done. Really big, thick chicken breasts can take so long to cook that the bread crumbs start to over-brown or even burn. So if you have whoppers, you might want to cut them in half horizontally before coating them.

I like this recipe even better with a 1:1 ratio of mayo to Parmesan, but then I love Parmesan. Freshly grating good Parmesan off a block, rather than using the pre-grated stuff from the store shelf, makes this recipe even more awesome.

Also, taste your bread crumbs before using them. If their flavor is weak, your finished dish will taste bland. Don't be afraid to add more Italian herbs, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and/or pepper until the bread crumbs' flavor is to your liking.

If you add a tbsp of lemon juice to the bread crumbs before topping the chicken, it adds a little zip :)

I thought this was great. I made it exactly the way the recipe says, and it was so moist and delicious.  My family loved it too!  Made it for a food auction as well, and the person who bought it said later that she LOVED it! She said it tasted like it took me a long time to prepare!

I crush up croutons if I don't have bread crumbs but this recipe is delicious either way. So simple. As a bachelor, I only bread my chicken like this, other recipes have too many ingredients :)

I made it as directed and it is absolutely delicious!  In my opinion it needs no other spices, the parmesan has just enough salt and flavor.  And DON'T overcook it!  The cooking time is right on.  Overcooked chicken is dry and tastes nothing like tender, juicy chicken.  This recipe is one of my favorites and I've cooked it 3 times in the last month :)

This was super quick and easy.  Per an old recipe I used to make with Miracle Whip, I added oregano and a dash of paprika to the mayo mixture.  Came out tasty, but I think the chicken needs a little s/p (or maybe garlic salt?) before the mayo topping.  Also, may try Panko next time, though regular Italian bread crumbs were fine.  I buy the big bags of Perdue chicken breasts at Costco. I can walk in the door, throw one or two into a knotted plastic bag (from Wal-mart, cheap twist tie bags near Ziplock items); float it in lukewarm water and it thaws in about 30 mins.  Then proceed with a recipe like this.  So easy.

This has been a favorite in our house for years, made exactly according to the recipe. I do pound the chicken breasts to make sure that the edges don't dry out while the thicker parts get fully cooked. I recommend you try it as written before you start making changes!

EXTREMELY easy and tastes good too. I hate mayonnaise so I was a bit skeptical, but you can't taste the mayo at all and the chicken comes out very moist.

This was great. I accidentally got shredded cheese instead of grated but it actually turned out really good. I think I may do that again. I covered them in jarred sauce and mozzarella when baking. It was great. i made leftovers for lunch that my boyfriend ate that night.

Excellent!! My husband does not usually like new recipes... but he LOVED this! It was so quick and easy to make! I used italian bread crumbs for more flavor and added them to both sides of the chicken. Yummy!

I really enjoyed this chicken, although I didn't end up using all of the mayo.  Since I had already dished it up, I used the extra mayo with Parmesan for artichokes.  Will definitely make this again.

super easy and super moist. the only thing i did differently was use the mayo for a 'wash' and the parmesan cheese as the 'crumb', rolling the entire breast in the mayo followed by the cheese and baked!

This chicken was really yummy. I did add my own touches. I seasoned the mayonnaise (I used Lite)  with some  pepper, garlic, and onion powder. I also made my own topping with crushed butter crackers. I then added garlic powder, pepper, onion powder, and Parmesan cheese to the topping. After I put the mayonnaise on the chicken, I dipped it in the topping. My family loved this! I'll be making this again.

There is no better way to prepare chicken.  I suggest pounding the pieces to get them even and adding about a tsp of mustard to the mayo---or a squeeze of lemon.  Absolutely salt & pepper and spice the chicken on both sides.  A little cooking spray on top helps the breadcrumbs brown nicely.

I had seen this recipe several places and determined to check it out on my go to site. Glad I did. . .got some great hints and was able to make changes according to our tastes. 
1. Butterflied breasts into 2 pieces then pounded them flat. 
2. Cut up some slices of deli ham and Swiss cheese. 
3. Mixed equal parts panko and parm along with pepper, garlic powder, Italian seasoning, and parsley on a paper plate. 
4. Mixed a little parm with mayo on another plate. 
5. Laid a piece of chicken on the first plate. 
6. Flipped it over onto the second plate. 
7. Laid 1 slice ea. Swiss and ham on one end of the up side. 
8. Folded the chicken over (it should now be covered in mayo) and rolled it crumbs/parm.
THEN I ran out of ham/Swiss. So I squeezed a package of chopped spinach DRY and added some parm/mayo to it and put a dollop inside the remaining pieces. Then put it in the mayo, folded and flipped it into the bread crumbs.
I sprinkled the remainder of the crumbs over everything and cooked it at 400° for 45 min.
Served it with broccoli/craisin/pineapple slaw and cooked carrots. Thumbs up from the whole family - aged 10 to 70.

Really easy and amazing. I bought chicken tenders instead of breasts because I do not like cooking them. I put on italian seasoning, salt, pepper, and lemon juice before the mayo and parm. Definitely gonna keep this recipe for the future. Easy and very tasty.

Have made it several times in the past. One of my favourite chicken recipes! This time I added pepper, garlic powder, and dried basil to the mix, as suggested by one of your reviewers, and just as delicious. Served it with a side of broccoli and pasta. Quick, easy, and yummy!

Made this recipe just as stated, but I cooked at 375 for 45 minutes.  I had some smaller chicken breasts and was just afraid they would dry out at the higher temp.  The breasts all turned out moist and flavorful.  Easy and very good recipe.  This will be a "go to" in my house from now on!

I'll be honest, I gave this a try because I had leftover mayo. Neither my boyfriend and I eat mayo, or a lot of mayo based dishes, we just don't really dig the taste. But here I am, after a party, where I made a sauce that involved mayo, and I have a whole jar left... what to do? I decided to try out this recipe.

My boyfriend, who usually won't touch mayo, LOVED the chicken. I actually had to go out and buy more mayo because he liked it so much. I added a much of spices, because I was afraid it would be bland. It was also super simple to make. I love simple during the week.

I used bone-in skinless chicken breast as that's all they had at the store.  They were slightly frozen so I baked at 350 degrees for an hour and fifteen minutes.  Served with rice and corn.  To be updated after tasting.  Update: Turned out pretty good even with the bone in.  I think next time I'll make more of the mayonnaise parmesan mixture.

Very good when in a rush. Butterfly and then pound the chicken, then proceed with the rest. Keep an eye on it though as this will speed up the cooking time.

I'm really not much  of a cook - my husband does most of the cooking in our family.  I needed something simple and quick. I wasn't too sure about the mayonnaise but this was a huge hit with my young adult son!  It will certainly be served again!

This was so good - and easy! The chicken came out juicy and the flavor was great. I sprinkled the top with Italian bread crumbs for a little extra zing. The leftovers were chopped up and tossed in with a salad. Yum!

I changed it up a bit.  I never have bread crumbs so I crushed saltine  crackers and mixed in garlic salt, oregano,  basil, and dried crushed tomatoes for the topping.  So easy, and took no time at all.  I was surprised  at how tender it was, I recently  had my wisdom  teeth  pulled  and I had no trouble  eating  it.  My daughter who's  two said yummy after every bite!

Super quick and easy to fix.  My boyfriend, who insists he absolutely "hates" chicken, can't get enough of it this way.  I use less mayo, more parmesan (and sometimes some Romano) and add lots of Italian herbs.  Season to taste and it's a crowd pleaser!

Not only is this recipe good on Chicken, but I've made it with Tilapia and Pork Chops. I've just added applicable spices to the mixture, like some Old Bay with the Tilapia. Such a delicious recipe!

Simply delicious.  I use Panko seasoned breadcrumbs, nice and fluffy and add a squirt of lemon juice.  The breadcrumbs act as a binder for the Mayo and grated Parmesan. Then just spread on 1/4" thick ea. No need to due the underside.  It won't stick there anyway.  No need to spray or grease the pan.  As it cooks the oil from the Mayo will drizzle down and keep them from sticking to the pan.  I cook as stated and then turn the oven down for ten min. while I cook the sides.  Great with garlic mashed potatoes and the veggie of your choice.

We make this dish many times since first discovering it.  What is so nice about it is the versatility it can have.  I recommend what j03sugar says about butterflying and dipping the breasts, most def. is worth the extra 2 min it takes.  After parties we often will have veggie dips (i.e. Beau Monte dip, spinach, etc.) left over and we will use these in place of straight up mayo to help clear out the fridge and give the cook a break from being in the kitchen so long the night(s) before.  Excellent classic. Recommend to anyone. (psst great one for kids to make up!)

Great recipe that the whole family loves and very easy to make.  Plus I always have the ingredients on hand.  For my family's personal taste - I find that there is too much mayo so I use half the amount called for.  Still comes out perfect and I taste the chicken instead of all mayo.

I find it slightly too salty, but it's still a nice treat with a side of pasta. The salt taste could possibly be from the breadcrumbs, so I may use plain next time and add my own italian spices.

This wasn't bad. It just wasn't spectacular. I'll keep the recipe on file because it was quite easy to make, and I always have the ingredients on hand, but I dont think I'll make it often.

The chicken came out very juicy and the outside was nice and crispy! I first cooked the chicken for about 30 minutes at 375 and then removed it and seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, and garlic powder and then rolled it in the mayo and then the breadcrumbs. I put it back in the oven for 25 minutes at 350. Very good, my boyfriend devoured it!

Instead of mayonnaise, i just dipped the chicken into beaten eggs and then into italian seasoning and sprinkled parmesan cheese.  Super tender.

This recipe is DELICIOUS and VERY EASY to make!  This is my "go-to" recipe when I want something that tastes great and flavorful, but I don't really want to cook.  It only takes 5 minutes to mix the mayo & parmesan, spread it on the chicken, sprinkle with breadcrumbs, and then pop it into the oven.  I do flatten out the chicken though, that way it cooks evenly faster.  You can not go wrong with this recipe!  Unless, of course, if you use Miracle Whip.  (My parents used this recipe but with MW instead, and I thought it tasted awful!)  Stick with Hellman's Mayo!

This was the easiest, most delicious chicken recipe ever.  I hope my husband does not get sick of this, because I plan on making it all the time now.  I coated each piece of chicken very well with the mayonnaise mixture before sprinkling each side with bread crumbs.

My boyfriend absolutely hates mayo.   I was a little worried he'd taste it but ... he didn't notice a thing.  In fact, he said it was some of the best chicken he'd ever had!!   Love this!!

Loved it. I didn't have any Italian seasoned dry bread crumbs so I used crushed saltine crackers. I added Hidden Bay seasoning to the mayo to give it an extra punch.

I used this recipe because I was out of eggs for chicken parmesan and it worked pretty well. Very easy to make which is why I gave it 4 stars.
I would recommend separating your chicken in the pan so that the crust can get crispy. Mine was too close together in the dish.

Our family did not like this at all! Typically, I "doctor" recipes, but on this recipe, I actually followed it! I thought the chicken was too "tangy" - the kids said it tasted like vinegar. I served it with tortellini and Alfredo sauce and it was passable, but I won't make it again.

I think that this is a really good recipe. I did do somethings differently though. Instead of using mayo, I coated the chicken in eggs. I also seasoned the eggs so that the chicken was well-seasoned and was tasteful.

I used mayo w/ olive oil and a little bit of Miracle Whip.  Mixed that w/ the parmesan cheese.  Butterflied the chicken breast and "dipped" them in the mayo mixture.  Then coated all over w/ breadcrumbs (seasoned w/ garlic, onion powder, paprika, s&p).  Very good result however thought they could use a little more seasoning.

This is very similar to a recipe I got from a friend a couple of years ago, the only differences being that we have used an egg wash instead of mayo and a package of dry Good Seasons "Zesty Italian" salad dressing with - or even instead of - the bread crumbs (surprisingly good crust without crumbs!). Always comes out moist and tasty and it's a nice quick option.

This wasn't bad, but it certainly wasn't good.  Made exactly to recipe specifications and it was not appetizing at all.  Will definitely not make again.

Really easy to make and very yummy.  I spice up my mayo though.  Add some garlic, pepper and whatever else sounds good a the time.  With 2 very picky eaters, I never make enough.

I really enjoyed this recipe! I hadn’t added the Italian bread crumbs and instead just used Italian seasoning since I’m on keto. I’d also added garlic and onion powder. In the future I’m going to add some dijon mustard and maybe a little bit of paprika and some hotter seasoning. It’s good, it just needs more flavor.

Easy and Excellent!!  I did place the chicken in a ziplock bag and rubbed it with a dry rub greek type seasoning in the morning.  Just before cooking that night, I removed it from the bag and patted dry with paper towel and proceeded with the directions.

I would think you could season with your favorite spices to rotate flavors if making this often.

One of my favorite things to chicken dishes to bake, I substitute Pork Rinds instead of the bread crumbs. It keeps out the grains if you are keto/NSNG.

Although I have rated this one before, I make it regularly & have more of an accurate opinion now as I’ve adapted & discovered how to make this a 5-star! As written, it needs some help. First- I find that making smaller cuts of the chicken ensures a better overall result of even flavor. The larger breasts/cuts can leave you with a very DRY center with little flavor. So, smaller is actually ideal, and it allows for more consistent baking of a moist, tender inside & crispy outside as overall result. I make a modest mix of the Parmesan & mayo, then place each piece in the mix, coating entirely. You don’t need excess, so keep a thin, even layer. Bread crumb coating should be consistent, and also generous. Oil from the mayo will otherwise soak during baking if the crumb layer is too thin! I also used Italian flavored bread crumbs, but before coating the chicken, I season w/ salt, pepper, garlic powder & a bit of Adobo. This way, the chicken, itself has flavor underneath the coating.

Very good. I, like others added a little seasoning. It was very tasty and easy to make. I did also cover the entire breast and had more bread crumbs than it called for. This would be good as strips or “nuggets” and finger type food.

My husband is a beef man and only eats chicken because I make him, but he loved this! I put the parmesan cheese in the mayo as directed. Then I seasoned panko crumbs with black pepper and a little basil. Next time I will add garlic powder, but I was out this time. I rubbed the mayo mixture on the chicken breasts and coated in the panko. I cooked it at 400 because I was afraid the panko would burn at 425. I cooked it for 25 minutes, and it came out perfect. The chicken was juicy and coating was crunchy. I told my husband he might see this again, and he said "No argument here!" Winner, winner chicken dinner! Thanks!

I didn't use Hellman's, I used the Aldi's brand and I didn't use seasoned bread crumbs.  The cooking time for mine was 30 minutes, not 20, possibly due to the thickness of the breasts.  Overall, it was moist, tender and tasted pretty good, if a little on the bland side.  If I make  it again I would season my plain bread crumbs more with salt and pepper, garlic, paprika and dried parsley to try to add a little kick to it.

It was fabulous.  I tend to shy away from chicken breasts because they so often come out dry BUT this recipe gives the juiciest most flavorful chicken ever. If the meat has not been given time to come to room temperature, 20 minutes may be a bit short of enough time.
Great dish, thank you !

As a quick and easy dinner, this is a true winner.  My husband loved it.  The Mayo keeps the chicken moist and the Parmesan crust adds nice flavor.

Made as directed. Was good. A little dry, but that was my fault for making them too thin. So don’t make them too thin.

This is a great recipe that I have used often. It makes skinless chicken moist and flavorable and is simple to make with ingredients you have on hand. I use chicken strips instead of breasts. It is good cold too.

We sometimes use chicken tenders to speed up cooking time.   The best, however, is to hammer down the breasts into thinner cutlets.  This recipe is so reliable and always a hit!

Easy to make and quick , but oh so bland.  Followed the recipe with the exception of seasoning the chicken with Lawry's seasoning salt and adding garlic powder to the mayo/parmesan mixture.  It didn't even look appealing.  May try one more time using some of the variations mentioned in other reviews.
Updated: 6/13/2018
Made a couple of  small changes which made a big difference 
Reduced mayonnaise to less than 1/2 cup but more than 1/4 cup.  Added 1 pressed clove of garlic to the mayo/parm mixture.  Lightly seasoned chicken with McCormick Montreal Chicken seasoning.   Much more flavorful!!! Will make again.

This was amazing.  My husband and I absolutely loved it.  It was so juicy and tender.  I followed the recipe with the exception of seasoning the chicken breast with garlic salt before I put on the spread and I used panko crust instead of Italian bread crumbs.   I also used Costco’s Foster Farms chicken breasts which are larger then most. 
Thank you for this great recipe!

Super easy and yummy! I used Miracle Whip and dropped the heat to 350 for an hour. Really simple and fast--my mom loves it so I'm glad it's something I can make when we don't know what else to eat. Yum!

The fastest, easiest way to make a great Chicken dinner. Punch it up with Asiago cheese instead of Parmesan and a side of fresh salsa.

This is the most delish recipe for chicken breast/tenders/thighs.  I like it so much that I tried it on cod loins and it is super good too. 
Last time I made the cod I put Italian seasoned bread crumbs on the underside of the cod and for some reason it was even better.  I use the non stick foil when I prepare this and it is an easy cleanup. I would rate this recipe a 10 if I could, it is that good.

I made these into nuggets and they were delicious! I did as others suggested and dipped the chicken into the mayo (I put a little garlic powder and parsley), then put on the Parmesan and lastly breaded. I baked them for the full 20 min and they turned out wonderful! I will definitely be making these again!!!

well I'm one of those "look at a recipe and do my own thing" types so here's what I did.  I used a 3lb bag of thawed chicken beasts and cut the bigger ones in to smaller pieces and arranged them in a 13x9 Pyrex pan.  I mixed 3/4 cup of mayo with a heaping spoonful of minced garlic, garlic salt, (we love garlic lol) a fair amount of the red chicken seasoning spice, a few dashes of cayenne pepper and I used grated cheddar cheese instead of parm. I spread the mixture on the chicken and topped with buttered Ritz cracker crumbs instead of bread crumbs and baked for 25 minutes on 425. my husband and I both really loved it!!

I made this tonight for dinner and it turned out pretty good, I did change it up a bit. I used panko bread crumbs and to that I added  parmesan, oregano, chilli powder, onion and garlic powder and salt. I just eyeballed the amount of mayo that I added to each chicken breast it was a thin coat but enough to make the panko mixture stick. The chicken came out very juicy and crispy I think the next time I make this I will add some Dijon mustard to the mayo to give it a bit more of a bite

Such moist chicken.  I usually find chicken breasts dry but this recipe is great.  I flattened the breasts and covered in mayo cheese bread crumb mixture.  Served with Southern Fried Cabbage Yummm.

Ok. I made this but substituted Panko bread crumb instead of itilian and put a dash of cavenders and tony chacheres in the mayo. Was delicious! I made it by the recipe 1st but liked it with the Panko much better. Also used on boneless pork chops and actually liked better than the chicken.

Made it tonight and it was a hit...  I did change it a bit...butterfly the chicken breastfeeding and I put mayo and the Italian bread crumbs on both side..   also added a bit of pepper, onion powder and garlic powder.   
Husband said it was a keeper.

I actually tried this recipe, only I added seasonings to the mayo as well as the bread crumbs, and I used Oil Mayo instead of traditional mayo, Among a few other alterations, but it turned out incredible, It was so moist and rich, I highly recommend this recipe. If you want to see the seasoning I used you can check out my blog at pantryexperiment.wordpress.com I think the extra seasonings really gave it a huge punch of flavor. Check it out.

I followed the recipe exactly. My family liked it but they didn't rave over it, "It's chicken" they said. It was tender and juicy and had a great flavor.

I didn't want to like this recipe. Mayo, parmesan cheese and bread crumbs? That's it? But I've seen it in various forms for a while now and finally tried it last night. WOW! It's delicious! The only change I made was seasoning the chicken with a little seasoning blend prior to putting the mayo/cheese mix on top. Turned out GREAT. The only change I would make would be to pound the chicken to an even thinness. New regular in the recipe lineup.

4 ingredients = Fantastic.  Kids were telling their friends about how good it was.  I couldn't imagine this to be 5 stars, but it easily is.

The only deviation I made to this recipe was adding a little salt, pepper, onion powder and garlic powder to the chicken then followed the recipe as instructed. I sauteed fresh zucchini, tomatoes, onions and garlic in a little olive oil with some oregano and bay leaves, served over whole wheat pasta. Simple salad of greens and what a delicious dinner!  Pretty quick too!

Tried it and loved it. Made it almost exactly as stated but added a little more seasonings to the chicken: basically salt, pepper and a little Sazon.  Came out great!

This has been a family favorite for a long time . I have tried it with Miracle Whip and Hellmanns Mayo. Both are good but I find the Mayo can be a little rich sometimes.I generally combine the Miracle Whip with the cheese and add garlic ( powdered or fresh ).A sm amount of Italian seasoning is also a nice compliment. Bone in breasts also work very well just remove the skin and top with the mixture before baking.Havent tried it with the breadcrumbs though might be a nice addition for the next time I make it .

I make this all the time; so easy and yummy!  No mayo taste, which initially freaked me out.  I do use a little more cheese & spices in the coating, but the idea came from Best Foods!

My entire family loves this, even my husband who does not eat mayo. I usually add some garlic powder and dried thyme but it is delicious as written. Thank you!
