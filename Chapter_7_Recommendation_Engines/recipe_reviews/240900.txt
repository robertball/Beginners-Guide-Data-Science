I feel a little guilty rating this a 4 because this recipe has so many possibilities with just a few additions but just as written that's what I would give it. I would definitely add chopped green onions and maybe some chopped artichoke hearts or maybe even green olives! I served this with Uncle Ben's Brown Rice & Quinoa which we thought was a perfect complement to the chicken and I opted to use chicken breast as suggested by the submitter of the recipe. I have a little left over chicken that I added to the rice and I'm thinking I'll LOVE it cold tomorrow as a salad-type dish for my lunch. I'll add in the green onions and I just know it will be perfect. Thank you so much Michael because it gives me something to look forward to tomorrow!

This is a very simple and easy recipe to make but turns out so well. The combination sounds weird but it turns out like a sweet and sour chicken

This is a great recipe and the cook time was very reasonable! I added a few things. First I cooked my chicken a little longer than 10 minutes. Second I added small pieces of green bell pepper cayenne pepper (because I am a Southern girl) parsley and honey dijon mustard along with the honey! Last I served it over yellow rice! YUM!!!

This recipe was quite a surprise. We had all the ingredients on hand and it was quick and easy make. Tasty too! I added a couple of pinches of dried cilantro for eye appeal more than anything else. Otherwise I followed the recipe with perhaps a little more cooking time. Next time I'll try fresh cilantro.

It was very easy and tasted good. It doesn t make much sauce. I used all the ingredients except only 1 lb chicken. I would have liked much more sauce and next time will double the sauce ingredients.

I love making this recipe. Quick easy and tastes delicious. I usually make it with chicken but am trying pork tonight. I make a little extra sauce and serve everything over Jasmine rice. Everyone loves it!

I would never have thought to use maple syrup with mustard but it is a match made in heaven.

It wins lots of points for fast and easy. I made it tonight for the first time and I will likely make it again but expect to make some additions - perhaps something crunchy like fresh snow peas and/or nuts. I also think it would be delicious on pork.

This recipe is very good but just needed a little more jazz for us. It still made a very tasty meal and I ll just adjust it a little the next time to our tastes. Thanks for sharing!

My son, also a Michael, is going to explode eating this. Weâ€™re both impressed with how yummy it turned out. I am generally not a very adventuresome eater?, so I was pleasantly surprised when this turned out as good as it did.
