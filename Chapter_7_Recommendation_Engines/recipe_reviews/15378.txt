This was fabulous! I changed it up a little bit by substituting the olives for canned, diced green chiles and sauteed onion. Also used red enchilada sauce. Easy to make and extremely tasty! I will definitely make this recipe again!!

This recipe was very good. I added 1 lb. cooked ground beef seasoned w/taco seasoning in the middle layers. Also used a Mexican Blend cheese and red enchilada sauce, and some refried beans(canned kind)in the layers. The top layer of enchilada sauce I covered with more of the mexican cheese. It turned out great! Even my picky 5 year old ate it! We did like it a lot better with extra sour cream on it while we were eating it though.

I'm just a girl of 13, but I L-O-V-E cooking. When my history teacher assigned my class a Mexican cooking project,
I didn't know what to do!!! I looked all over the 'net, and found some recipes, but they were almost a mile long. This recipe 
is short and easy to understand. More cooking websites should have simple recipes like this one.

I love this recipe. Instead of using the real cheese and Sour cream you can sub it with the soy or non-dairy stuff and it still comes out yummy. My parents loved it. You can play around with it and make it your own. I'm a college student and it helps to have one basic recipe that you can change as needed. It's also good the next day if there's any left over.

Delicious! Our store didn't have green enchilada sauce, but we sufficed with red.  In the middle layer I added chunky salsa with diced chipotle peppers.  I also added some garbanzo beans that I had sauteed with onions, garlic, green peppers, cumin, chili powder, and cayenne.  This was so good!!! We like things a little more spicy and the addition of the chipotle and cayenne was fab!

As much as I hate to say it, my family liked this dish more than the enchiladas I slave hours over. They ate the whole pan in one sitting, and were disappointed I didn't make more. I have one picky eater who hates sour cream, so I omitted it on half of the casserole. A fabulous and QUICK meal!!!

Surprisingly tasty and full of authentic Mexican food taste.  The cheese and sour cream mixture blends wells as it cooks to make a creamy filling.  The recipe does leave out the final steps.  You must sprinkle the remaining cheese and olives over the top layer of enchilada sauce.  This is a good pot-luck dish, as it makes a large cassarole dish full and a very pretty presentation.

One of the few highly-rated recipes from this site that have been a complete disappointment.  Very bland and heavy.  Didn't care for it at all.  Made the mistake of making it for guests the first time I made it.  Ended up throwing out most of the pan.  Definetely will not make again!

It was very dry.  The filling tasted really good if you added beans, and some jalapenos, but the way the recipe says to add the sauce leaves the middle really dry.  Next time, I'd flavor the sauce some more and put more sauce bewteen the layers.

Very easy and fast.  I needed to double so I made 4 layers of 6 tortillas, and used probably about twice as much sour cream and cheese.  I used a mixture of Jack and Colby cheeses.  I didn't put in the olives, but did mix in chopped green chilies, as well as some garlic powder, salt,  pepper and chili powder into the sour cream mixture, just to spice it up a little.  Topped the whole dish with extra grated cheese.  Yum - will make this again!

I doubled the Ten Minute Enchilada Sauce also from this site.  As I was assembling the dish, I dipped each tortilla in the warm sauce before layering it in the baking dish.  We also added a partial (left-over) can of Rotel, a large can of olives, and two cups of cooked chicken. It was wonderful!  Not dry at all!  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Made exactly as written. It wasn't horrible, but it was fairly flavorless, which I think was due to the green enchilada sauce. Also, the corn tortillas turned to mush. If I do try this again, I will try it with flour tortillas and red enchilada sauce, and possibly a sharper, more flavorful cheese.

I made it the first time as written and it was very easy and yummy.
The second time I forgot my grocery list and so had to buy the ingredients from memory. I ended up with all the core ingredients but also added a can of black beans, rotel and ground turkey. It was even better!

Not the enchilada for my husband. They were easy to make but basically needed to make husband another meal that night. My 6 year old agreed with him wholeheartedly unfortunately. I thought it was allright at best, but will not try it again for the family.

I was searching for an easy and quick recipe for a huge church dinner that I do once a month.  (This month's theme was Mexican).  We feed over 100 people, but I usually only have an hour for prep and cooking time.  I quadrupled the ingredients, added some cumin and fresh cilantro to the sour cream mixture, and voila!!  It was a HUGE hit - with kids and adults alike.  I garnished the top with cut green onions....everyone kept coming back and asking for more.  Fortunately we had it!  Two nights later, I made the same recipe for my family, but added fresh crab meat in the layering process.  Very successful!!

I thought this was OK but my hubbie said it was really good.  I added some refried beans and salsa to the inner layers for added flavor.  easy weekday dish and something that you can throw together quickly and cheaply but not something Id make for company or anything

This was just ok. It would have been very bland had I not used spicy enchilada sauce and a can of green chilies. I also added a layer of cheese on top.  Won't make again.

Loved this recipe! Four of us ate almost the whole pan... I'd rate it 5 stars, but I made some major changes so to be fair I'll give it 4. Instead of green sauce, I made my version of the 10 minute enchilada sauce on this site. I added canned green chilis. And I shredded 4 cooked chicken breasts and tossed with 4 or 5 tsps of taco seasoning. Used slightly less cheese and replaced the full fat sour cream with fat free plain yogurt. Made the night before. Will definitely be in regular rotation and I think it would be great for potlucks.

I wish I could give 3 1/2 stars.  This was a good and easy recipe, but it is missing the final step of adding the remaining cheese and olives to the top.  I did add a bit of extra sauce between the layers, right on top of the cheese mixture and I think it really helped to add to the overall flavor.  I also substituted black beans for black olives because otherwise my husband would not have gone near it.  Next time, I think I may add a garnish of shredded lettuce and diced tomato at plating.

Well, this was just cheese and more cheese. I need a killer sauce, ample seasonings, and, some vegetables aside from a smattering of olives. I took the basic concept of this but made a nice and easy enchilada sauce using tomato paste, chili powder, corn flour, and spices. I filled half the tortillas with a smashed potato and turnip mixture, and the others with cheese, spinach, and mushrooms. Didn't use the sour cream. I have also thought about trying a lentil mash in place of the potato mixture. Next time I'll add some TVP (textured vegetable protein) for bulk. Top the casserole with just a scant handful of yellow cheddar cheese.

Wow, was this good!  I used the same ingredients in mine except in different proportions because I didn't have access to the internet when I was baking it and had to guess.  I'd imagine it would have turned out pretty much the same though.  The only major differences were I only used 8 gordita sized flour tortillas, half the sour cream that I put on in dollops over the cheese and added two cans of chili beans.  Then baked 40 minutes.  It was so very tasty , my boyfriend really liked it too and I'm happy to have an easy, yummy, healthy meatless recipe that's relatively inexpensive to make!

This was wonderfully fast and easy. I added ground beef browned with Taco seasoning to the layering, and gave it a little more substance. Shredded chicken or shredded beef would work great as well. I'll make this again; next time using mild or medium enchilada sauce, instead of hot.

Excellent recipe. I have added 3 breasts of marinaded chicken as well as 2 cans of drained black beans.  My fiance and I love this recipe and have tried it on several people who also love it.  If you choose to add the above ingredients, I would encourage using a larger (28oz) can of green enchilada sauce.  The tortillas can seem be a bit dry if not.

I made this in an 8x8 pan, using half the ingredients. I used red enchilada sauce rather than gree. I also added some salsa to the middle layer and some ground beef because my husband doesn't really like meatless dishes. It turned out great and everyone liked it. I will make it again.

This is really good. We added about 2 cups of pinto beans and some green onions to make it more substantial. Easy and fast.

This is a great dish for cheese lovers, like myself.  I did not find enchilada sauce-green or red-at my supermarket.  I substituted green salsa for enchilada sauce.  I wasn't too sure about it, but it was good.  I would recommend cooking it 30 minutes instead of 20, since it was cold in the center when I removed it from the oven.  This dish reheats very well in the microwave, so I'll be freezing the rest!  I will make this again.

Great for quick, easy cooking, and definitely flavorful. I used a red sauce (personal preference) and it worked out nicely.

Delicious, easy to prepare.  An excellent recipe as is or varied with red enchilada sauce and sliced green onions.  Definitely a keeper!

The recipie was awesomely fast and easy and definitly a cook with your kids meal.  I just thought the cheese/sour cream was a bit too rich for my taste.  It was also much yummier the day after.

Easy, fast, and yummy!!! What more can you ask for?  I made it first just like the recipe then decided to add shredded chicken for when I made it for others.  It was GREAT both times!!!...I prefer the orginal recipe, but some eaters MUST have their meat!!! :-)

Good... but I'm not running out to the grocer any time soon to make sure I have the ingredients on-hand to make for company. Perhaps a better rating should be 3 1/2 stars? Added refried beans and scallions to the sour cream and cheese goop to make it a more robust side dish instead of an appetizer snack. Perhaps adding chicken or turkey the next time...

Love this recipe. I do however add a little more cheese to it and throw in a couple chopped up tomatoes just for some extra color. But overall it is great just as it is.

Easy family pleaser!  That is how I would describe this dish.  I adjusted slightly to accommodate my smaller family.  Therefore I used fewer only 9 tortillas, 8 oz. sour cream and added some left over chicken to the sour cream mixture.  Also, I added a little of the enchilada sauce on each layer.  With a light salad it was a fantastic meal.  We can't wait until tomorrow for the leftovers!

I like using this recipe for a base.  The original one is a little bland for my family's taste but it's great because you can add whatever your family likes to it.  We add onions and whatever else we have or are in the mood for that night.

Super easy, but I did not care for this.  After 2 bites, I couldn't eat any more and my husband, "the disposal," only ate i piece.  I don't think the people who add to this recipe should be rating it.  I followed it to a T, and it lacked a lot.  If you are going to make this, make sure you add something, anything, to make this edible.

Not so good!  My daughter who usually LOOVES everything couldn't even finish hers- she is the least pickiest child you can imagine!  My husband said it "wasn't bad"- and my 5 year old agreed. I followed the recipe as is- except used less sauce because it looked way to soupy- and it was.  Thanks for the idea-  just not our style I guess!

These were excellent! I made a few changes, left out the olives as I don't care for them, and added shredded chicken mixed with a packet of taco seasoning. On the advice of some other reviewers, I added extra enchilada sauce in the middle layers to keep it from drying out, and it worked great. We had leftovers only because with all the extra I added it filled my 9x13 dish to the brim! But I bet by the end of the week there won't be much left. Thanks for the recipe!

We always have lots of leftovers when I try a new recipe, so I cut this recipe down when I tried it!  No leftovers, and everyone loved it!  Next time I will have to make more :)  I did use red enchilada sauce to please my little brother, who would have made a face at green sauce though!

First time we tried this we werent sure we liked it, but it was so easy I HAD to try it again.  I added some sauted onions (I know I know the concept is ease) but the overall recipe is so easy that adding this step is simple and is worth the extra effort.  We like it and it re-heats great.

I'm suprising my boss with a Mexican Fiesta for her birthday. This will be easy to re-heat at work. 
She doesn't like olives, so I added some rice and some diced Ortega chili peppers. I modified the recipe to a 9x9 pan. I also thought red sauce would be more nuetral for the workplace. 
Since I used a 9x9 I got a little bubble where the corn tortillas overlapped. I just threw some cheese and chili peppers on top to even it out and make it the perfect little mexican enchilada lasagna. I'm sure it'll be a hit!

This was an excellent recipe!!!  I LOVE Enchiladas and was happy to find a recipe that didn't call for meat.  You don't miss it!
  I couldn't find the green enchilada sauce and used a mild salsa verde (Herdez) found in the Hispanic food section.  I also added black beans (rinsed and drained) along with frozen kernel corn (reheated for 2-3 minutes in the microwave). I used authentic corn tortillas...
So very good...A KEEPER!

My family loved it!!! The kids ate every bite. I added a 1/2 pound of ground beef. We used flour tortillas because that's what my husband bought from the store. We like flour better than corn tortillas anyways ??. I will be making this delicious simple meal at least once a month.

This was okay.  I don't think I used enough of the enchilada sauce.  It seemed like to much when I was layering it but I should have used the full amount.  The kids and husband liked it.

This was very yummy! New cook and easy to follow. I used red enchilada sauce and added some taco seasoning. I will add maybe ground meat or chicken next time. Everyone who ate it loved them, lasted more than one meal. Will add in the meal rotation. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I live in Korea and there is no green sauce here.  There is also no red sauce but I made one from scratch, and then used that instead of the green sauce.  Everything else per the recipe.  The black olives were very nice in it. Nice, easy recipe and it smelled like an authentic Mexican dish coming out of the oven.  Thanks.

really good but i added a few things. i think enchiladas just have to have meat, regardless of what the recipe calls for, so i added ground beef cooked w taco seasoning and this turned out so delicious!! also i believe this called for green sauce? i used red although i think either one would work nicely and would not effect the quality of the enchilada. this is a nice recipe to use as a base and add any other mexican style ingredients that you want to enhance it.

I used pepper jack and cheddar cheese mixed. Made my own red enchilada sauce. Also, we added a can of pinto beans. My 9 year old daughter made this with me and liked eating it too. My husband and I thought the sour cream was a little over powering. We all enjoyed it though. I will try it again sometime in a new way.

This was fabulous! My husband ate half the dish by himself and there were no leftovers.  Its so easy to put together too.  I used red sauce instead of green and added some shredded chicken to the cheese mixture.  I already have requests to make it again. This one's a keeper!

I love cheese enchiladas! These are as good as the ones I've rolled individually in the past--actually they are better as they are less work and are easier to serve. I did modify them a bit as  I subst. sliced ripe olives for the chopped olives. And what's a cheese enchilada without onions? I added approx. 2/3 c. diced onion to the sour cream/cheese mixture. For the sauce I mixed one 9 oz can of Old El Paso mild enchilada sauce with one can of cream of chicken OR cream of chicken soup. If folks want more "heat," I have a bottle of hot sauce on the side.

I have been searching for a simple enchilada recipe for a long time. This was excellent. I cut it up like Lasagna and if there are any leftovers they freeze well for future references.

What a delicious and enjoyable way to put on weight!  I made this recipe as-is and enjoyed every bite.  This one's going into permanent rotation at my house -- although we'll only eat it just once in a while because it's got so much fat in it.  Which, BTW I wouldn't change for the world.  Yum!

Very good...I also used ground beef.  However, I used a round Corningwear 8 inch or so baking dish, kept the tortilla's whole, and layered just like the recipe including the taco beef.  So good, my 2.5 year old tore it up, as long as there was a lot of added shredded cheese!

Loved it! I made a small addition to it and added taco meat to the layers (1lb ground beef & 1 packet taco seasoning). Super easy to make and delicious!

This recipe went over really well with my family, even the picky eaters loved it! I altered the recipe slightly to suit me, a little extra cheese and a little extra spice.

This is a great recipe, and easy to follow... more importantly, it is easy to adapt.  I saute anything I have around the house to make a filling and just put the filling in a corn tortilla and roll it up then cover the enchiladas in enchilada sauce and cheese.  Bake for the recommended time and POOF! Eat 'em up!

I really liked this recipe, but to be fair I changed a lot.  My family doesn't like olives, so I took those out, and I added a mixture of rotel, refried beans, and green chiles (one can each total) to each layer to bulk it up.  It was a great, easy vegetarian meal.

I could not find Enchilada sauce so I used taco sauce. I also used 1/2 the amount of sour cream, 1/2 the amount of tortillas, more than what was called for cheese [8oz of Monterey Jack and a sprinkle or two of some "Mexican" on top"] and double the olives. My family really enjoyed it and said it was better left over!

I prepared this after Christmas for my daughter who eats vegetarian.  The flavor is nice but we all agreed -- way too much cheese.  Probably the cream cheese.

This is fantastic and sooooo much quicker and easier than rolling up the enchiladas. I used red sauce, and added some diced green chiles to the layers and sliced green onions to the top, and it was just delicious. My daughter added shredded chicken to her section of the pan, and said that was really yummy. I'm eating the leftovers right now (the next day), and they are just as good if not better! Thanks, Koolmom84!

I thought this was good but my daughter absolutely hated it, she put it at the top of the foods she hates list.  It does not look very appetizing or smell very good...but it tastes better than it looks or tastes.  I'll probably make it again someday but it won't be a frequent recipe.

This is a wonderful quick and easy recipe.  I add about twice as many black olives, and I use the ones with jalapeno when I can find them.  I have also done an extra layer of tortillas on the top with extra cheese to make it a thicker dish.  This stuff is great!

I think this recipe should be more appropriately named, "enchilada lasagna."  Its not bad, but does not reheat well due to the sour cream and tortillas - the tortillas become mushy and slimy.

A great, quick recipe! I ate this with blue corn tortilla chips and it tasted exactly like a chili cheese dip my mom makes. I loved the crunchiness of the chips with the smooth, gooey cheese. Thank you!

Thought these were really good.  I used wheat tortillas and I added cumin, red pepper and a touch of chili pepper to the sour cream/cheese mixture.  This gave it a little kick.  Be careful on how much sauce you use, but it does thicken up when you cook it. I cooked it about 5 min. longer than suggested, but do watch with the sour cream.  Thought it was very good and next time I may add some beans, but again, as is was a hit (with a little spice).

This recipe was delicious, and is highly customizable.  I've tried it with flour tortillas and red sauce too, both variations were so tasty.  You can also add things, like onion, chiles, etc.  Thanks for a quick and easy dinner that I will use time and time again!

I had such high hope for it, but it turned out soupy even though I used less enchilada sauce than the recipe called for and the cheese/sour cream had this nasty curdled texture.  I couldn't even bring myself to finish what I served myself.

I loved it but the kids (7 & 2 years) wouldn't even touch it!  Husband thought it was ok.  I added hamburger seasoned with taco seasoning like someone suggested and I put a layer of rice seasoned with salsa.  I used a 15oz can of red enchilada sauce and added some salsa in with it.  I also put lots of cheese on top.  I might make it again when the kids aren't around...but my normal chow hounds looked at it with crinkled noses and said it tasted "weird".

This was good and the whole family liked it but I am the one eating the leftovers. I used a 24oz jar of green enchilada sauce (I like it wet), diced cooked chicken, and a little salsa in the second layer. The next day it was still good but it really dries out. I just ate it with extra salsa.

This was okay.  The only change I made was to add a small can of green chilies.  It was just dry and tasted like it was missing something.  I won't make this again, we didn't even finish eating the leftovers.

Kinda like enchilada lasagna or enchilada casserole. This was an allright recipe if you're feeling lazy and you don't want to put uch effort into a meal. Next time I won't use as much sour cream.

Yumm!  These are really good and so easy.  I did make a few alterations.  I used flour tortillas and rolled them up instead of layering.  Oh and I added some shredded chicken and topped the enchiladas with cheddar cheese in addition to the jack.

I added cooked diced chicken, and cut the green chilies in half.  Wonderful, and easy way to enjoy enchiladas!!
