We call these BB&C, a family treat.
A couple notes to making the best BB&C sandwiches.
This is key... after the bread is medium well toasted in the broiler, flip the bread over, toasted side down.   Place the beans on the un-toasted side of the bread, then place the cheese on top of the beans.
Another tip. pre-cook the beacon (the microwave works great for this) about half cooked before putting it on the cheese and back into the broiler.  Pre-cooking the beacon takes some of the grease of of the beacon.
Notes from: Tunes in the Kitchen...

A no-frills dish - not gourmet but tasty.  I fried the bacon, heated the beans, and toasted the bread before assembling and broiling in the toaster oven until the (cheddar) cheese melted.  More work and more dishes, but the final product came out better.  This way there wasn't bacon grease all over everything, the cheese didn't disappear into the beans, and the bread  didn't disintegrate - my husband was able to eat it by picking it up.

My eight year old rated this.  I would have given it one star.  The bread turns out soggy and the bacon doens't crisp. You do need to keep a close eye on it the last minute or two.  I would recommend this for teenage boys. I can see why they would like it, but I'm deleteing it from my recipe box.

Very good!!!  I was skeptical about my husband liking this, but he did.  He said he wouldn't want it every week or anything, but every now and then.  It was so simple and FAST to make.  I will use this recipe again when I am in a big hurry.  Thanks.

Turkey bacon may also be used to make it more healthy. I agree with some of the reviews here. I like the taste of precooking the bacon and toasting the bread before assembly. Great suggestions!

Another variation is the use of sliced smoked gouda cheese.  (Although harder to melt, so let it warm up to room temperature before broiling.)

I have not made this recipe yet but I did a search because I was craving what my Mama used to make. She called these by the same name but ours had a whole slice or three of onion on them (three on mine because I love onion). So glad that someone posted this and that I am not the only one eating them.

I took the suggestion of cooking the bacon and toasting the bread first because I like crunchy things. I always drain pork 'n beans.  I liked the combination of ingredients.

This recipe brought back memories of my childhood.  My mother made these often but used hamburger buns.  She buttered the halves before putting the beans on--helps to keep the bread from getting soggy!

I would make this again. I used whole wheat instead of white bread, since that's what I had. Next time though, I will cook the bacon prior to putting the sandwiches into the broiler.

Sounded gross at first, but I looked again and tried it. Simple but very good.

The taste of childhood.   I was actually writing this out for the family recipe book and searched to see if I could cheat!   Yippee, less typing for me!

I also toasted the bread, and microwaved the bacon first. I made one sandwich with American cheese slices, and another with extra sharp Cheddar; I was surprised that I liked the cheese slice one more. Thanks!

Pretty darn good.  Will use real cheese next time instead of the plastic stuff.  It was made even better by the fact that I had a big pot of home made baked beans all ready to go!
