Great salsa! For a different spin on it, try oven broiling the tomatillos, peppers, onion and garlic until slightly charred. Then puree. I usually add some chopped fresh cilantro and a couple squeezes of lime juice too!

This is my salsa verde.  I noticed the amount of water need in this recipe is missing, you should start with 1 cup of water, it shoud be absorbed by the time the tomatillos are golden brown.  Also some people like to add 1 bunch of chopped cilantro, and a squeeze of lime.  But I like mine just how it is.  Also if you want a smoother version you could put it through the strainer after you blend it to get the seeds out.  Also if you dont want it that spicy you can use different chilies.  Jalapenos work well.  Also, do not drain the water, it should be mostly absorbed by the time your tomatillos are browned.

I made the recipe as written, and I thought it was bland and salty. That's why I'm giving it 3 Stars as written. It wasn't spicy, which is how I like my salsa. It's how I believe it should be. I've been eating salsa since I was a kid, and put that awesome goodness on almost anything, lol. 

I thought it had potential, and after the changes I made, it's now a 5 in my house. I increased the amount of peppers, added cilantro, and reduced the salt. This salsa had way too much salt. I add about 1.5 tsp, sometimes 2 tsp.

Pretty good recipe but poor instructions. This recipe does not say to drain the water, which you have to do before you put the cooked veggies in the blender. I sauteed the garlic separately since I knew I wouldn't be able to strain it out of the water.   As another reviewer suggested, I added lime and some cilantro to mine once everything else is in the blender. Lime makes everything better. I probably used 3/4 of the salt.  This salsa is very spicy, in fact I don't think I've ever made one this hot. I'm a bit disappointed since I made this for a party and it might be too much for some people. I used 16 tomatillos, 1 1/2 onions, and 8 serranos, and it was still very, very hot. Next time I would only use 4-5 serranos, but I like my verde salsa relatively mild to medium.

Saw this recipe this morning.  I made it this afternoon.  I just had a couple of spoonfuls right after I blended it.  It was still hot, but I have a theory.  Anything good hot will be good cold. I know there are exceptions like oatmeal.

This was delicious.  It made quite a bit, and since I was the only one eating it, I had quite a bit left over, even after a couple of days of snacking.  I added the remaining salsa to chili I made later in the week, and my husband loved it.  I also roasted the tomatillos, over my gas burner, to add smoky flavor to the salsa.

This was my first experience cooking with tomatillos so I wanted a nice and easy recipe.  I liked this a lot but I found the salt (only added 1 tbls) to be overpowering.  I made a second batch because I have everything available from my garden and omitted the salt and combined the two batches - perfection!  Also used a combination of jalapenos and serranos and added the juice of a lime.  Thanks, SB, for sharing!!

Yummy - not the best hot sauce ever, but I was so pleased I'll put it in the pantheon of 5-star recipes. This was only the second time I'd ever cooked with tomatillos, and (I think) the first time I'd ever used serrano peppers. I made this exactly as written, while cutting the "salt, to taste" down to 1 T. instead of 2 - that sounded like way too much. Also, I used a middling cooking time of 25 minutes. Hardly any water cooked off, and though it was unstated, I drained the vegetables after cooking (but saved about 2 T. of the cooking water to add to the blender).  I was happy that this made a decently hot (but not blazing) salsa, and that it had a decent thickness. I may just make this again soon - it was so easy and tasty.

This was very good and quite easy. I cook almost everything on the grill so I tried this in a skillet over med-hi heat and it worked good but not hot enough to cook off the liquid.  I split it up into three portions and tried it 1.as written, 2.with some cilantro and lime, and 3.mixed with some sour cream for a wet burrito "gravy". I used 4 big serranos and it was just right for me and lacking a little heat for my husband. This'll be my 'go to' recipe, thanks.

Great recipe! Like how easy it is to make. Except that when I tasted mine, it was a little bit too sour. I had to put in some sugar to mellow out the sourness... but I think that is just the tomatillos that I got. Overall good and easy recipe!

We loved this. I didn't know it was so easy to make. My water didn't boil off, so I used a slotted spoon to dump everything in the blender. I added cilantro, lime & granulated garlic. I didn't have serranos so I used jalapenos. My husband isn't supposed to have salt, so I cut that way back. Thanks for sharing this great, easy recipe.

I wasn't sure how much water to use so I did as instructed, enough water to cover. I found this seemed to be too much, after simmering there seemed to be too much liquid -maybe i cooked too long i dont know. Anyway, no problem, I scooped the mixture out with a slotted soon and kept the liquid in the pan incase needed. After blending, I decided the salsa was perfect consistency without the water so poured it away.  I also used jalapeno peppers, sliced with the seed and pith removed in place of serranos -husband likes it hot! I also added in 3 tbsp fresh chopped cilantro before chilling, the recipe made enough to fill a 1 lb or 10 oz spagetti jar, that is what i am storing it in. If you do remember to wear gloves!  Great recipe!

Really good stuff, we used different chilis that the recipe called for and even added in an extra jalapeno for heat. We also added a little cilantro and blended that in, will make again for sure

This recipe beats the one I've been using from Paula Deen's show with a Mexican woman/guest chef a few years ago, and that was a really great one.  This one is the absolute best!  Added one bunch of cilantro becuase I LOVE it, forgot the lime.  This is the best green sauce I have ever tasted!
I plan to make a larger batch and put some boneless, skinless chicken thighs in the crock pot with the sauce then shred for tacos plus lots of extra sauce on the side.  You simply cannot get enough of this sauce, goes great on EVERYTHING!! 
I used 5 serranos the first time and it wasn't hot enough for me.  If you like heat, 8 would be perfect.

I cut this recipe in half.  My store did not have serranos, so I used 2 fresh jalapenos, removed the seeds and pith.  I used less salt at the beginning, but then found after I blended the ingredients it was too acidic and added more salt to cut down the acid.  I did not need any of the cooking liquid, I strained the ingredients before blending.  It was not spicy enough for me, so I added about a tablespoon of pickled jalapenos and a splash of the juice from that jar and blended that.  This was pretty good!

This one is a bit hot for me.  I did not remove seeds and membranes from serranos, maybe I will the next time.  Instructions say to add water to just cover.  This is too much water.  I had to cook it down for an hour to reduce volume because it was way too watery.  Good learning experience.

for heat and best flavor I add zest of 1 lime or 1 lemon, 2 jalapeno,1 habanero,1/4 yellow onion, 2 cloves garlic and 1/4 cup finely diced cilantro. Precook the peppers and tomatillos and onion and garlic over mesquite for more flavor.

I have made several types of tomatillo salsa and this was one of the most fun.  I cut back on the Serrano Peppers to 3 and added a couple cloves of garlic instead.  My parents and friends loved it.  I some times get it too hot for "normal people."  Lots of flavor and a perfect thick sauce to use o9ver many dishes.

I used the recipe as a guide and made a portion that suited the recipe I needed the sauce for.  I used 4 tomatillos, 1 green long hot pepper (instead of serrano peppers), and as much garlic, onion and salt that I felt would suffice.  It came out absolutely perfect.  Very flavorful.  I used this green sauce for a chicken enchilada recipe.

we really enjoy this recipe, although we've played with ratios a little bit to reduce the bitterness of the tomatillos. for enchiladas for two, we halve everything except the number of serranos (we like it spicy!). Great flavor and you really can't beat the simplicity of this recipe. Thanks!

Good, but I add poblanos and cilantro to make it even better.  Also, I do not cook the ingredients,I just put the ingredients in the blender with chicken broth.

Try adding a little pineapple - may sound odd,but balances out the heat.

Love this!  I add a tablespoon or so of white wine vinegar which gives it a kick I really like.

I wish I'd had fresh cilantro, as I like what it adds. Used less serranos (scared of them!) and added the optional lime juice. I don't know if it was the tomatillos or the optional lime juice or what, but I wound up having to add some sweetener to take out some of slight sour taste. My tomatillos were not prime, either, so that may have been it. This was much easier than previous salsa verde recipes I've made where I had to roast the onions, garlic & peppers, and to me tasted just the same. Thanks for the recipe!

I can't believe I made something this good and authentic tasting and it was so EASY.  A huge hit with my entire family!  I also mixed it into other dishes to boost their flavor and it worked wonderfully!  Great recipe!

I prefer the recipe I located about 5 years ago on the all recipes website.  Cook the tomatillos and salt, leave the remaining ingredients raw.  After the tomatillos have cooled, add all ingredients to a blender and blend to the consistency you prefer.  If too dry add some of the water you boiled the tomatillos in .  If you like mild hot sauce, eliminate the jalapeno peppers and use 4 Serrano peppers, Spicy use 6 Serrano peppers, and if you like it hot use 8 Serrano peppers

This recipe is a very good, authentic recipe, but I did make a couple of adjustments.  SB, you said you could see adding cilantro and limes and I did that.  I boiled the tomatillos (whole), onion (cut in large chunks), garlic (whole) and chilies (serranos cut in large chunks) until the tomatillos turned brown, about 20 minutes.  I scooped the veggies out of the water and put them in the blender and blended them smooth.  I added a handful of the cilantro (leaves only, no stems) and lime juice and blended some more.  I only added the veggie water after blending to get the right consistency.  After tasting it all I decided to add a large dollop of sour cream to make it a creamier salsa and it was perfect.  I have been looking for the perfect salsa for chips and nothing in the store comes close.  Thank you for posting this recipe.  It is now the only recipe I will use.

It turned out very bland.  It smells great, but has no flavor, and certainly was not hot.

Great salsa, but extremely hot. little goes a long way. The only change I made was adding cilantro. My family used on the rice, 
chips everything. My son loves it as relish on hamburgers and hot dogs.

this was a great recipe. simple yet good. I've never made my own before. this recipe called for 8 peppers which I thought was a bit much so I added just 2. it wasn't weak yet not overpowering butt burning hot.

It tastes AMAZING cold. I made it for the Super Bowl party we had but it was still warm so it was barely touched but the next day it tasted really good. Eat with tostitos hint of lime chips.

I made a large batch and canned it up for use during the Fall months, when a good Mexican meal hits the spot on a cold dark night. I added a couple Ancho chillies and three Arbor chillies to give it a smokier, fuller flavour.

This is a terrific recipe!  I added more serranos just because I like things hot. The only thing I would do differently next time is not to blend it so much. I think it would be better with a little more texture to it.
