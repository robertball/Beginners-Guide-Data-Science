This is just what I was looking for I did add 1/2 tsp double strength vanilla & 1 tsp cinnamon,which required me to add addl flour, also  instead of rolling logs which was a little hard to do I made them about 1/2 inch think by 1 inch wide flat logs I used a fork to decorate.  The dough was still sticky so I did roll the amount I was working with in flour.  Also I found if I cut them before they dryed over night  it was a much harder cookie.  Thanks!

I made these last night,very easy recipe.  The dough was sticky even after the extra cup of flour.  I added a tsp of vanilla for flavor.  After waiting over night I ended up blackening the bottoms of some. On the up side my 9 month old really likes them and so did the 2 year old I baby sit.  So I'll make it again. I like the taste of the batter,so I was a little disappointed in the taste after cooking,but then again I was not cooking them for me,and thank God I am not teething,because those cookies live up to their name.

These are great! However, instead of messing with the very sticky dough, I just used a ziplock/pastry bag to make the cookies individually, then let them harden over night.
Really tasty, and perfect for coffee!

This recipe is great. However, to avoid giving my baby eggs, I used a vegan egg substitute. You use 1 tablespoon of flax seed meal and 3 tablespoons of water per egg. Boil it and it makes slimy, egg-like substance. It worked great! The cookies were tough and didn't break off into my son's mouth. He loved them!

Bones of the Dead, as these are called, are much improved by the addition of ground cloves and almond or vanilla extract.  Also, though some reviewers show signs of paranoia, of course babies can eat egg whites!  They've been doing it for millennia!

My child loved these.  I am only giving it a four because it includes eggs.  I didn't realize until later that my five month shouldn't have egg whites.  Luckily, he doesn't have a problem with them!

I didn't like them, baby didn't like them, they got moldy in 2 weeks.  So they definitely don't last a month in an airtight container.

This is a super recipe for teething babies. I experimented using Splenda and it still turned out fine. I used cookie cutters for shapes before setting out overnight. Can also lay the soggy cookie to dry and it will be hard as new again!

Great for teething!  My 7mth old loves them and so do my husband and I!  I added some vanilla and a pinch of salt for flavour.  The next time I make them I'll try cinnamon in them as well.

Can you add bananas or other flavouring to these cookies?  Maybe some applesauce, bananas or blueberries?  Has anyone tried it?  My daughter doesn't like things that are plain... but she LOVES bananas, so adding some might make her more inclined to eat these.

Great!  We call these "baby biscotti" and we all love them dunked in coffee or cocoa, while the baby has hers!  You do have to watch for the tip to break off when it gets soggy but that's true of any teething biscuit. 
Thanks for the recipe!

You can replace the egg with banana or some other fruit if you are concerned with egg allergies. 1/4 cup banana is equal to 1 egg. My daughter is lactose intolerant so this recipe is great. Other teething cookies upset her stomach.

These are so good! Baby loves em! I followed the advise of another viewer and put the sticky batter in a large ziploc bag, cut the corner and squeezed them out on the cookie sheet that way.

I rolled and cut these before leaving them over night as someone suggested and they did turn out pretty hard. Not the most glamorous looking cookie but that will come with multiple tries (I didnt want the flat cookies in the photo as it was to fit in the baby's mouthand grasp!). The baby, my 12 year old and I love these. They taste like the sugar ice cream cones. Added a teaspoon of vanilla! The dough wasn't sticky or hard to work with at all maybe it is all about beating it longer? A+

I am a new mother (my son is 8 months old), and he does not have a problem at all with the eggs in the teething cookies. The Gerber teething cookies that I give him have eggs in them too. the only thing I don't like is how sticky the dough is.

i added one cup of flour and i think that was to much to add,(also 1 TSP vanilla extract) they turned out hard on the outside and fluffy on the inside, not what i was expecting. so ill just wait and see what my baby thinks. also maybe when you put "add more flour when sticky" you should put HOW MUCH FLOUR.

It took several attempts because the picture looked right.  Didn't add any additional flour as I did once before.  Didn't bake at the recommended temp as I did twice before.  My oven works pretty accurately on all other recipes but for this one I had to set it at 325 and bake the cookies for 10 minutes.  I'm reverting to childhood and dunking them in milk and I'm as happy as can be.  Just brought a little bit of NYC closer to MD.  Thanks soooo very much,  Lee

I,like a previous reviewer, added a tsp of vanilla for flavor.  They are very yummy and taste like super crunchy sugar cookies - but not quite as sweet.  They are fabulous dipped in coffee or cocoa.  I gave them 4 stars because of how difficult I found it to roll the dough into "logs."

This is a good recipe. I gave it 3 stars because of the adjustments I had to make. I ended up adding 3 and 1/4 cups of flour just so I could roll the mixture into logs. I also added 1 tsp of vanilla and 1/2 tsp of ground cinnamon just for flavor. I also lowered the baking temperature so they didn't burn. I lowered it to 325 degrees and baked them for 15 minutes. They turned out great! My little guy loves them!

Our 15-month old grandson luvs 'em.  He sucks on them and chews on them.  His mouth is erupting with all sorts of teeth right now, and he really isn't liking his usual favorite foods.  I did add some vanilla.
