This is a classic recipe.  One can substitute rum or brandy for the bourbon, or any of many other liquors or liqueurs! These spirit balls are awesome!

I've used this recipe for 2 years now, and I keep getting great comments on them.  However, I roll them in granulated sugar instead of confectioner's sugar.  That is the way I remember them from my childhood, so I kept it the same way.

these balls were not up to my "ball" standard, if you will.
