A simple enough recipe. Basically, it's another variation on the classic grilled cheese sandwich. Nice addition of pickles and hot dogs. Loved the selling point, but I have to point out that this dinner wasn't really as 'super' as the name suggests. I was hoping to find some added directions as to how to 'Mitch' up the recipe (as the author's wife would call it) to 'suit the more refined taste buds of adults,' but none was found. Still, a decent enough recipe, and not too difficult to produce. The best part was that the kids can help.

I tried this as written & then I boiled some dogs & tried it that way. The boiled dog was MUCH better because pan frying or grilling, even, bring out all that saltiness in the hotdogs, overpoweringly so in this case. Probably won't make again but it was a fun try. Thanks!

I freely admit I made this for the novelty.  That being said, it was still just "ok", at best.  It was super salty (and I LOVE salt) and kind of a PITA to assemble/keep together.  Hot dogs are meant to be grilled or roasted over an open fire (though, I didn't go into this recipe w/that frame of mind).   I didn't eat more than a few bites and even Mr. LTH left quite a bit behind.  While it bears no impact on my rating, I also find the tagline semi-offensive (have MOM make you....).  I appreciate the novel approach, but it wasn't for us.  THANKS for the recipe!
