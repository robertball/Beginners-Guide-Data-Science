I ran thru all the cream puff recipes here and found that they are all the same. What makes or breaks the puff pastry is the way you make them. I use a turbo roaster for baking and I find that the puffs would stay in shape better if I bake them at 450F for the first 20 mins, then 350 for the next 5 mins, then 250 for the last 5 mins. This way the puffs are cooked inside (it taste less eggy, if the insides aren't cooked they look and taste like scrambled eggs). As for those who said that their pastry didn't puff, i think you better check the temp, lower temp won't help the pastry puff, it also causes you're dough to be soaked in butter (deep fried dough as my brother called it)as i've experienced.

I only used the filling from this recipe and it was perfect!  An old-fashioned custard flavor.  I used the recipe for the shells from Shellie Wendel's Cream Puff entry and the end result flew off the serving tray.  Wonderful cream puffs just like my mother used to make!

these were so yummy, although I didn't like the custard recipe. So, i just replaced it with a boxed pudding and used that as a filling. Came out well, but 25 mins. at 400 degrees was too long, about 20 mins should be fine.

This is a great recipe, but will sure wear ya arms out mixing!!!  I found these cream puffs to be the perfect.  However, I think next time I will pipe them out.  They rose perfectly, and was NOT to moist or to dry or flaky.  This is the best recipe for cream puffs I've tried in a long time.  I can not comment on the custard filling as I used a cream filling, but will surely try the custard filling next time with these cream puffs.

Excellent recipe - the best cream puffs I've ever made. I followed one reviewers advice and cooked for 20 minutes at 450 degrees, then for 5 minutes at 350 degrees, and then for 5 minutes at 250 degrees - they came out perfect!  Thanks!

Fantastic Recipe and so easy,  I didn't use the custard though. Instead i mixed Cool Whip, a package of lemon Pudding mix and a brick of cream cheese together for the filling  and then i topped them with a raspberry each and then sprinkled with icing sugar! They tasted fantastic and looked good too! I wish i had taken a picture!

These were easy to combine, but the baking part was tricky. I talked to a friend of mine about why the insides were still sticky and the outsides were the right colour and she said the trick it to cook them until they are the right colour and to turn off the oven so they dry out in the middle. Leave them there until they cool off.

I made my puffs about the size of the store-bought frozen ones and I got 24 plus I threw out a bit of dough. the pastries turn "golden" WAY before they are ready to take out of the oven. dont get freaked out and take them out too early! 25-30 minutes is necessary to cook the insides. the custard is lovely, but about twice as much as I could possibly use even with filling them as full as I could. that's ok, it was good to eat alone! I topped with melted chocolate and then refrigerated for a couple of hours. refrigeration is necessary to really make these perfect. good recipe. time consuming, but good.

I made these cream puffs for the 4th of July and they were gone in no time.  The filling is absolutely delicious and the puffs were very good. Very easy to make.  I was asked for the recipe several times that day.  The puffs come out so golden.  I will be making these again this week for friends coming over.

I guess I had high expectations for this recipe.  Right after they came out of the oven, with the custard inside, they tasted totally disappointing - but after a few hours in the fridge they were very tasty.  I'll probably try this again but I'll put less sugar in the custard, or I'll simply replace the custard with something different - whipped cream perhaps.  Now THAT would be yummy!!

These were terrible!  They didn't "puff" at all, and they were SO high in fat that I wound up draining melted shortening off the baking sheet when they were done cooking! (total for 1 1/2 recipe: about 1/3 c melted shortening!)  They tasted all right if you dipped them in the lemon curd I made to go with them (istead of filling them).  The custard part never set up and it didn't taste all that great anyway.

My cream puffs turned out nothing like the ones in the pictures.. They turned out very eggy, and not at all like what I thought they would be. The custard was great, but the puffs didn't turn out well at all...Won't use again.

Didn't like it. It's a custard fill not a cream fill, so it needs to be called a custard puff instead.

I was making cream puffs when I realized I was out of pudding mix.  So I went out searching for an easy filling.  I absolutely loved this cream filling.  I will never go with boxed again.

everything went well. the taste is why it gets 4 instead of 5 stars. the pastry itself wasn't all that good..it was plain. with the filling it tasted better. the filling wasn't "to die for" either. i think i'd rather put vanilla pudding or something..something from those jello cups. i had to add extra sugar in it. it still didn't turn out that good. the texture of everything was great! overall it's pretty good. i'd make it again.

This recipe took me back to my childhood and my Aunt Donna.  Everytime I went to visit her in Michigan she made these for me.  I love to cook, but my wife does most of the baking.  These were easy and they turned out perfect!  I added a bit more vanila and put whipped cream on top of the custard.

These cream puffs are good and easy to make but the cream could be better. It's a fairly standard custard but I find that you can taste the flour and it a bit bland.

OH MY GOODNESS!!!  VERY impressive recipe!  I've made this several times, I did make one minor addition, we mixed up some instant vanilla pudding and put a few tablespoons of that in the custard, and then put it in the puffs.  Just a little kick to it!!!!

These were absolutely fabulous! Maybe there was more mixing involved than some people would like, but it was an easy recipe to follow, came out great! and the flavor of the custard wasn't too sweet or too bland. Thank you very much for this wonderful recipe!

I strongly advise making this, though i am young and inexperienced the shells had no flavor and were so dense they couldn't be filled. Find a different recipe, and believe me this review is 100% applicable.

I live at 5100 ft of altitude and these cream puffs baked up light and fluffy (which is hard to do up here!).  The recipe was spot on and they make amazing little desserts.  Highly, highly recommend.

Just finished baking these. The custard was pretty good, though a little bland in my taste. I think I expected something more vanilla flavored or sweet.  The pastry was a bit tasteless and bready. Also, I think something went wrong because they came out without any bottoms. Over all not that bad.

This recipe gets ten stars!!!! I have made this recipe several times and each time they come out better. Although I am surprised by some of the reviews about the puffs. Mine always rise and they arent fully hollow in the middle but I think that makes them even better. I use whole wheat pastry flour for both the custard and the puffs maybe that has something to do with it. If you dont like the grainy-ness of the whole wheat pastry flour give it a sift and you lose some of that texture!!!

I tried this recipe for the shells because I was out of butter and couldn't make my usual ones. I don't know what happened, but I did not care for this recipe. The did not rise or even cook through after being in the oven 20 minutes longer than called for. They were very greasy as well. Sorry for such a low rating. If this was my first time making the puffs, I would have thought I did something wrong, but I followed the recipe to a T.

I tried this recipe--and the puffs turned out great---instead of beating by hand I used the electric mixer--I also added dill to flour mixture--going to use crabmeat salad for the filling.  I baked them for 20 minutes at 450 then 400 for 10 minutes, 5 minutes at 350 and last 10 minutes at 250--they were so light I could not believe it--I was always scared the puffs would fall(my first ones years ago did and tasted !!!) but this time they were perfect--I will certainly do this again--a regular soup spoon makes them too big (for what I needed) but a heaping teaspoon was just the right size.  I used spoons that are for the table not measuring spoons--

The cream puffs were excellent, and I was amazed at how easy they were to make.  I didn't like the filling.  Not that it wasn't good, it just wasn't the type of filling I like on cream puffs.  It was more like what you would find in a long john or bismark.  It tasted good, though, and if you like that kind of filling, you will love this.  I will keep trying to find a filling I like, to go with these excellent cream puffs!!!

I think the temp is to high and even though I altered it like some of you said to bring it down to 350* then 250* my dough was still not cooked and did NOT rise at all don't know what could have gone wrong. Very disappointed to say the least.

Wow. Just wow. I used butter instead of shortening and 3 eggs instead of 4. These were absolutely amazing. The custard was thick, creamy, and delicious. The pastry was extremely easy to make and came out perfect. I filled a plastic bag with the custard and piped it into the pastries. I didn't have to cut them or anything. I just opened up a little crack on the tops of them and squeezed the custard in. I put a chocolate glaze on half of them. Next time I make them (there will DEFINITELY be a next time) I will frost all of them.

Very disappointed!  I have made cream puffs before, but lost my recips, so I figured I woul dtry this one.   I just made the custard and the puffs... the puffs came out more like fried pastry, and were not to my liking.  I did make the custard, but its still chilling so I haven't tried it yet.  I am hoping it is ok, but I'll be trying another recipe now for my puffs.

YUM! I used half a vanilla bean instead of vanilla extract. So pretty with the little vanilla seeds and makes it even more special with your guests knowing tha tyou splurged on the vanillla bean pods. Its VERY creamy a smooth! not too sweet which is great coz you want the cream to come through as well as the pastry. I used a different cream puff shell recipe that I know is tried and true with a hollow inside. THX!

Made this recipe at my job at the University of st.thomas. I quadrupled the recipe, and thoughout the week the residents personally came over and asked if they could see that this recipe is baked more often! I also baked this for my co-workers at a perkins and they were gone just like that! A FAVORITE!

These turned out ok. The filling tasted great. They hollowed out in the middle and rose really well. I'm not sure if I did something wrong, but they had a really strong egg flavor. Maby next time I will try using just two eggs.

These were really EASY to make and tasted amazing! I let the dough bake at 450 for longer than 25 minutes then lowered the heat to 400 for 10 minutes, then 350 for 5 minutes and then 250 for 5 minutes. They turned out great and was a huge success with my roommates :D

The recipe is a little eggy, I found I could use just 3 large eggs and have it work just fine. Only half of my first batch rose, specifically the half in the rear. To others like me with a window on the oven, push this tray far to the back, otherwise the first row will not get hot enough, at least on mine. Also, while mine puff, there is still a little too much meat to these puffs, I find it better to slice them open and scoop out some of the excess rather than just fill them as is. Overall, this recipe was very clear to me. Follow the instructions and you'll have a workable (albeit eggy) puff that's perfect for a variety of fillings. I have yet to try the custard filling listed here, but I felt adding more egginess would be too much.

As I'm already very happy with another shell recipe, I tried making the custard from this recipe to fill my puff shells.

The problem with this custard recipe is that the custard came out too sweet and stiff.  I'd probably reduce the amount of sugar the next time I try this; otherwise I'll look for another custard recipe to try out.

Made this as written (ingredients) when told to add egg to soft dough I transferred mixture to my kitchen aid mixer added each egg as instructed. Putting in mixer saved me hand mixing this by doing so. I also Cooked at 450 for 20 min then turned down to 350 for 10 min. The puffs came out perfect. Golden brown on the outside and soft but puffy on the inside. The  filling was great as well.

The Cream Puffs were time consuming to make. But overall the recipe is easy. After reading the other comments, I have to say, the Cream Puffs raised. I followed the heating temps. Mine came out hollow and slightly crispy outside and tasted great. I used Whipped Cream instead of the custard, No complaints. I plan on using the recipe again in the future.

Only used this recipe for the custard, which came out amazing! This is not my favorite cream puff pastry recipe. But if you're looking for a recipe for a plain vanilla custard, this is the recipe to use. Perfect texture and flavor. And my other baking friends LOVED the custard, says it's one of the best they've ever had.

Tried another filling recipe from a cookbook I had on hand and it flopped.  Went to Allrecipes for help and found this recipe.  This filling came out perfectly and saved the day!  Thank you!

These turned out great. First time making cream puffs and world-traveling, tough critic dad gave it "restaurant quality." Definitely a keeper! I made a chocolate ganache to drizzle on top, and I also took half the pastry filling and mixed it with some ganache to make chocolate ones. Super delish!

I followed this recipe by the letter (except I poured chocolate sauce over them at the end) and they hollowed out beautifully and tasted delish.

The custard was a little bland.  The cook time for the puffs was WAY overestimated.  They were burnt at 25 minutes and I really wish I'd taken them out much earlier.

The pastry. I always use butter, not shortening. (thats why I gave it 4 stars) The custard is great, basic, old fashioned filling for the puffs, like people used to make that way years ago. When the custard is ready I add 1/2 cup of cooked sweetened condensed milk (boil a can for 2 hrs) and 1/2 cup of lemon pie filling. You may add other flavors or creams. For example, add coffee instead of lemon cream. Play with it and enjoy.

I followed some of the suggestions left by others for baking: I baked the pastry for 10 minutes at 450 degrees, then 10 minutes at 350 degrees and the last 10 minutes at 250. They turned out perfectly-nice and fluffy and hollow on the inside. The custard, on the otherhand was not good. It had the right consistency, but the flavor was bland and unappetizing. Next time I'll probably just used a boxed pudding mix.

These were so easy, and super delicious! I followed the cooking times/temps recommended by some reviewers, lowering after 15-20 (15 seemed better) minutes to 350 for 5 minutes, and then to 250 for the last 5 minutes. When cooled and filled, I brushed a mixture of melted chocolate/butter on top, then put them in the fridge to harden. Absolutely delicious!

This is the best custard recipe I've come across.  The pastry is pretty much the same from one recipe to the next.   Made these for dessert with dinner when we had friends over.  I served with chocolate sauce, and they got rave reviews from everyone.

First time making it, and it tasted great!! I would be careful to make tiny dolps of dough, because I had MONSTER CREAM PUFFS! I also liked the 450 degrees for 10, 350 for 5 and 250 for the last 5

I used a different recipe for the pastry but didn't like the custard on the other recipe. I found this recipe for the custard so I decided to make it and I was not impressed. I followed the recipe exactly and the custard had a very unpleasant doughy texture. I ended up throwing it out. I would not make this again or recommend it.

Love this recipe. Definitely use the cooking suggestion of cooking them at 450 for 20 minutes,then 350 for 5 minutes,and 250 for 5 minutes. Will definitely make these again.

This recipe is much easier than it sounds. if you've done any kind of cooking or baking, this is recipe is simple and almost foolproof. You can use it for cream puffs or with a few minor changes, for eclairs as well. The only thing is, I made them a bit smaller and came out with 24 instead of the 10 it shows. I like my cream puffs rather bite sized, Of course, this also altered the baking time, but if you thump them on the bottom and they sound hollow, you know they're done.

This came out perfect! I love the custard as it is not too sweet nor is it bland.  I followed the advise of another reviewer who baked it at 450 for 20 minutes 350 for 5 minutes and 250 for 5 minutes. In my batch I tripled it and it made about 80 cream puffs with way too much custard left over. I used a teaspoon to measure out the puffs and then again to fill with the custard. I also melted chocolate and put it into a sandwich bag, cut a small piece of the corner off and then squeezed the chocolate on top of them in a zig zag pattern. I put them pack in the fridge to harden.  I then took them out and dusted with confectioners sugar. The chocolate makes it!!! This is something to definitely hand on to!

I loveeee itt and it was really easyyyy to bake but I don't know why it had a really stong flavour of eggs. On the other hand the custard was amazing but I believe it lacked a bit of sugar .

I am only rating the custard as I used my own cream puff recipe. The custard is awesome, simple to make,quick and has that great taste that the cream puff needs. I dusted with confectioners sugar,with swirl of chocolate syrup.

Love this recipe! Only thing I did different was add a little more real vanilla to the custard. Came out perfect and will continue to use this recipe. Thank you so much!

It worked!  I was so afraid but this was so simple and so good.  Took to a party and they were the hit.  Several people had more than one.  And I made them larger than the recipe called for!

The pastry didn't work for me. The custard is great though.

Great custard worked really well! I used pepperidge farm sheet if puff pastry cut out circles and baked them-they came out great and shortened the recipe in half!

These turned out great, I used about 3/8th cup coconut oil and 1/8 butter instead of vegetable shortening.  I also added some sugar and vanilla to the pastry dough.  They were delicious, couldn't stop eating them!

The custard was really good. My puffs did not come out right at all. The burned... Maybe it was my fault...I greased my pans. After 10 minutes of baking at 450, they were burned. I found out from another review on a different recipe that you should poke them with a toothpick after about 20 minutes of baking. Just finished baking my last batch and followed all suggestions, they came out better, but still stuck to the pan. When I take them off the pan with my spatula, they tear off the bottoms. Therefore, I have holes in the bottoms. I will be trying the recipe again, maybe. But first, I will read more reviews on different recipes. 5 stars on the custard :-)
