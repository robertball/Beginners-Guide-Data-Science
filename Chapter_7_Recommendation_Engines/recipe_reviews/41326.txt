The flavors of this recipe intrigued me, but I used them somewhat differently.  I opted for a very fruity extra-virgin olive oil instead of veg oil, increased the lime  juice to that of two whole limes, added some fresh thyme, rosemary, salt and pepper.  I then marinated the salmon in the mixture for 5 hours and grilled it.  I removed the onions (thinly sliced, not diced)from the marinade then sauteed them , added butter, cream, black pepper and a squeeze of lime juice which made a terrific sauce for the salmon.

This was a wonderful quick and easy way to cook Salmon. However, the broiling distance was a little too close, this caused the onions to char. But other than that, we had no complaints. The young kids enjoyed as well. Highly recommended when in a rush.

Very good!  next time I would reduce the amount of oil, probably to about 1/3 cup, but besides that it was very delicious.

This dish turned out nicely.  The salmon was moist and flavorful.  I added a little white wine to the lime and garlic.

Fantastic! I changed the proportions a little and it still turned out great. I didn't have any limes and I'm trying to watch the fat intake, so I doubled the lime juice and only used 1Tbl. of olive oil. I also added an extra clove of garlic. The key to this recipe are the onions - they are wonderful once infused with the lime and garlic. I served them with the salmon!

My boyfriend rushed home with a fillet and insisted I make it for him at 10 pm. Needless to say I was in a hurry, and this was quick and easy to prepare. It turned out perfect, with a nice uncomplicated taste.

Very nice! I cooked this in a foil package for about 15 minutes, and then broiled it. I used only about 1 tablespoon of oil and omitted the onion. The seasonings didn't overwhelm the fish, and the texture was just right. I served it with rice and asparagus and everyone loved it. I will certainly make this again!

Tasty, tender and DELICIOUS...this is a definite favorite.  I also baked this in a foil packet for about 15 minutes before broiling, and it made it incredibly moist.  This way, the lime juice impregnated the onions, creating an incredible sweet-and-sour, tangy topping that melted in my mouth!  This is being served for guests the next time around, and I'm anticipating a hit!

Even though I marinaded the salmon steaks overnight in the oil/onions/lime/garlic, I was quite surprised that the salmon didn't have more flavor. We ended up squeezing half a fresh lime over each steak as we ate them. Even so, we really enjoyed them. The salmon steaks were rather thick, so I ended up cooking Husband's for 30 mins and mine for 40 mins. Thanks!

too midly seasoned for my taste.  It doesn't have much flavor.  Even with adding additional spices, still too bland for my taste.  I was disappointed b/c the recipe sounded good, but did not live up to my expectations.

Great recipes if you're using the salmon in a salad, but only okay by itself.  I used more garlic and lime juice and it still didn't have much of a punch

There's just no flavor to this dish.  It's beyond mild.  That said, it was easy to prepare.
