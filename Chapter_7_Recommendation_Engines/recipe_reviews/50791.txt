Great twist on a tuna  sandich!  I used roasted red pepper in place of the tomato and garlic powder instead of minced garlic.  The flavors of the mustard and pesto didn't overpower the tuna.  It was a nice blend.

Made a half recipe with albacore and a little extra mayo to moisten a bit more, then served in pita halves with chopped tomatoes and a bit of shredded mozzarella. (Didn't have lettuce.) Excellent taste. Thanks for the interesting, delicious idea!

I was pleasantly surprised with this recipe.  I forgot to add the mustard and it was still delicious.  I served on toasted whole wheat bread and put just a bit extra pesto (I really love pesto).

Garlic Pesto Tuna Sandwich Haiku: "I owe you, Carrie! Your tuna is inspired! Made a great sandwich!" I was craving a tuna sammie this afternoon and after poking around the fridge in an attempt to liven up my ho-hum mayo-tuna, I stumbled upon Carrie's recipe, and loe and behold, I had these ingredients on hand. The only change that I made was to toast my bread, adding a slice of provolone near the end of its ding, b/c that sounded like a nummy compliment to the pesto flavor. What can I say except yum, as I wipe the last crumbs away from my keyboard.

Really good way to make a lowfat sandwich filling with lots of flavor. I actually found pesto on the cheap at my local Grocery Outlet so it really wasn't super expensive to buy it to try. I used a lowfat mayo and used whole grain bread. My youngest boy took a couple bites and refused to eat anymore.  Very yummy.

I'm going to give this 4 stars because I think with some adjustments, I'll like it better.  I think the pesto is great, but I don't think I'll use mustard again.  A little bit more mayo instead...maybe some dill?  Capers?  Also, maybe the extra garlic is a little much (the pesto I used was pretty garlicky itself).  I put this on ciabatta rolls, topped it with a slice of Fontina and put it on the panini grill.  Husband liked it, so there's another reason to give it 4 stars.  Will try again with some tweaks...

I really like the idea of adding some pesto to the tuna.  It added a very nice flavor.  Next time I might try leaving out the mustard...we're just not used to putting mustard in tuna salad.

Very tasty!  Used Dijon mustard and ranch dressing when I ran out of mayo.  I have also substituted the tuna with drained and mashed garbanzo beans for a meat-free version.  Thanks!

Excellent!  We loved this.  Added red onion slices and used roasted red peppers instead of tomato.  Also left the garlic out as my pesto had plenty in it.

Made this recipe as is and it was okay.  I didn't like the flavor the mustard added to it.  I love pesto and it's a great way to jazz up boring old tuna, but I will leave out the mustard in the future.

Excellent variation of tuna salad.  We omitted the garlic, lettuce & tomato, and used sourdough bread & American cheese.  Toasted them in our George Foreman grill, and they were delicious!

Really fantastic. This just turned my lazy dinner idea into something really quite delicious. I added sunflower seeds, a little dill relish and some diced cucumber and feta to it. Really tasty.

These made for a yummy lunch, I really liked the pesto in this. I left out the garlic (I used homemade pesto w/ enough garlic in it for me). I also added some shredded cheese and toasted the sandwiches before I put the lettus on. They were delicous, I can't wait to make this again.... thanks for sharing!

This was great! I really enjoyed the pesto flavor.  I added garlic salt instead of the minced garlic.  I also added onion for crunch.  I left out the mustard because I don't really like mustard and didn't add the tomato and lettuce. It was still really good though!

This was spectacular! I was quite suprised that the mustard, pesto and garlic all worked so well together. I made the tuna mixture using three cans of tuna for my family of 4 for supper (so mom and dad could have 2 each). We didin't have any rye so I used mini bakery sub buns (whole wheat) which I toasted and buttered. I put lettuce and cucumber on top and I had no tomato unfortunately. Yum!

So great and easy - I doubled the recipe and kept it in tupperware in the fridge for sandwiches for the week. I added a bit more of the sauce (mayo, mustard & basil pesto) and also smeared some of it on the sides of the bread for extra moisture.

I really enjoyed this.  I'm always trying to add things to tuna w/mayo for flavor and to reduce the amount of mayo but am rarely successful.  This was so flavorful and I will make it again tonight.

These had a unique flavor that was "good", but not what our preferred for a tuna sandwich.  Will stick to the standard tuna salad recipe in the future.

I always like practical ways of cooking tuna, and with pesto this seemed easy and definetly practical . . . I also dressed it up with some spinach leaves and it left our family wanting more.  Yummy!

I really enjoyed this recipe. A great change for the boring tuna sandwich. Love making these for lunch. I put this on multigrain bread with fresh spinach.

LOVED this! Used the exact same ingredients and measurements as listed. I like mayo, though, so I may have used a little extra. Unlike others, I really liked the mustard - adds a unique flavour. I was going to make this into a late night sandwhich with cheese, and I ended up eating it was tortilla chips!

I was randomly searching for recipes with pesto because I wanted to try something different. Never would have thought tuna and pesto would go together. This was really good. Omitted mustard, added a little (fresh) jalapeno for a kick, and toasted in the toaster oven. The 7-year-old and his friend seemed to like it more than I did!

Great combo, I used about a tsp of pre-minced garlic. Can't wait to make this again. Thinking about trying some sort of Tuna Melt with this.

I HATE tuna.  I am 35 years old and have never tried anything with tuna in it that tasted good.  However, since you always hear how good it is for you and how cheap it is, i wanted to try again.  Thank God I did.  This mixture is awesome.  I added a little more mayo because it was a little dry. I also rinsed my tuna (albacore).  Thank you so much for sharing.  Oh and I added a piece of swiss cheese.  I think this would be heavenly served warm or made into a pasta salad. Delicious!

I really enjoy this recipe. Nice, simple, and nutritious. I typically just make the tuna spread without garlic and serve on top of crackers, or as a dip with carrots, cucumbers, etc.

This was the best tuna salad I have ever tasted. I made my own basil pesto and toasted the rye bread.  The garlic made this a winner.  I use Pregresso tuna in olive oil. I drain the oil, but it leaves a great taste on the tuna.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was fantastic!  I varied it up a bit by using dijon mustard, adding cucumbers to the sandwich (not in the mix), and serving it on a sub roll.  Having it again for lunch tomorrow!

I wasn't sure if I'd like the combo of pesto and tuna, but it actually works well.  The amount of pesto is fairly light and subtle.  I added celery for crunch and roasted red pepper.

Husband gave it a 2 I gave it a 4, split the difference, good idea, next time I would eliminate the mustard entirely, overpowered and I used less than called for, added an odd flavor that seemed out of  place with the other ingredients and no additional garlic, the pesto added enough flavor.

While traveling to NYC recently I stopped in a deli that had a pesto-tuna-mozz sandwich similar to this.  I loved it so much and this variation is great too.  I never liked tuna sandwiches very much, so plain and all that mayo, but now I am not an official tuna-pesto sandwich lover!

We made this on toasted wheat bread. It was good, but it seemed like something was missing. Next time we make this we are going to add a slice of mozzarella cheese.

I was expecting this to turn out better.  I love tuna and pesto but marrying them in this dish didn't seem all that impressive. I used grape tomatoes and that seemed to pick up the pesto flavor and brought this dish to two stars.

This was pretty tasty! Instead of making it into a sandwich, I put the tuna salad on top of a slice of tomato with some mild cheddar on top. I put it in the oven on broil for a few minutes to let the cheese melt. Delicious!

I made this just the other day and it came out great. Real easy to follow directions. I will definitely make this again.

I've made this recipe several times & I love it! It never lasts long at our house. We use it for sandwiches and as a topping for salads.

It's a different take on tuna salad.  I like it, but still prefer a more traditional version.
