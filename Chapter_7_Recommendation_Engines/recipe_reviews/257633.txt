The only change I made was to add about a 2 cups of cabbage  sliced fairly wide when I added the cauliflower and ham.  My son is fairly picky and his bowl was licked clean.  Will definitely be making this again.

Delicious combination and surprisingly quick and easy to make.  Good last minute dinner if you have some leftover ham.

Quick and easy. More of a hearty soup than an stew but the ham was delicious. Will make again.
