My husband and I really liked this. My grown son didn't care for the heavy honey flavor. We used just under a teaspoon of the crushed red pepper, and it was still very spicy - my husband would like it better with even less. I used 2 zucchini like someone else said in their review and more ginger but other than that I did everything else according to the recipe. We served with whole wheat pasta. We'll make this again with some slight modification.

This was very good!  My husband loved it.  I used two zucchini and only 1 tsp. of red pepper flakes.  I liked that it was a pretty quick and easy meal!  i will definitely make this again.

This was okay but definitely not something that I would serve frequently. I cut red pepper flakes to 1/2 tsp. and the heat level was just about right.

I love spicy, but this recipe is waaaaay past spicy! 2 teaspoons of red pepper flakes?  We couldn't eat it.  It would have been good with a pinch or less - or the red pepper flakes could have been left out completely.

The 1/2 c honey plus the cornstarch made this very gloppy. 1/2 tsp - 1 tsp of red pepper flakes would have been adequate. I ended up adding chicken stock, lime juice and white wine to get some liquid into it.

I thought this recipe was excellent. My only words of advice are to definitely have everything pre-chopped and the honey and corn starch mixed before you start so that everything can be added quickly. Everything cooks pretty fast so it is really great if you are wanting a quick dinner.

I adapted this slightly based on comments from others and to reduce to two servings. I halved 6 shrimp (lengthwise) used half a larger zucchini and about 5 mini portabella mushrooms that I had on hand, along with green onions. Instead of raw garlic, I used garlic chili paste in the sauce which I think has a more balanced heat than chili flakes. I thinned the sauce with chicken broth. Great recipe that is adaptable to your personal taste.

this was very good! my husband is very picky about vegetables so i have to be creative in how i introduce them to him. needless to say - he ate all the veggies in this dish. i did make the following changes - i used green onions instead of the yellow onion and i definitely decreased the amount of the red pepper flakes - about two small pinches - it was still a bit strong and i'm not a wimp. i also used a mixture of zucchini and yellow squash. i will definitely make this again! thanks for sharing!!

I only put in 3/4 tsp of red pepper flakes because I didn't want it to be too spicy for my kids .... added an extra 1/2 tsp of ground ginger  & I also added 2 TBSP of soy sauce and an extra TBSP of minced garlic to the honey mixture. Served over pasta. It was ok, a little bland still ... would probably add another TBSP of soy sauce next time and only 1/4 cup of honey mixed with 1/4 cup of water. Kids loved it though.
