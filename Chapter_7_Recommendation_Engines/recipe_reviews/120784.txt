I would suggest boiling them in 8 cups water and 1/4 cup baking soda for about 15-17 seconds,set them on a paper sprinkle with salt.This is what puts the signature skin on the soft pretzel.I also use brown-sugar instead of white sugar,this recipe other wise is perfect.

These pretzels are very good! I, too, brush them with butter instead of the egg before baking. The recipe makes a lot, so I usually freeze half. To do this, shape the dough, then freeze the unbaked pretzels on a cookie sheet. Once they are frozen, you can transfer them to a freezer bag. When you want to make them, just take them out of the freezer and put them on a lightly oiled cookie sheet and cover them loosely with  lightly oiled plastic wrap, and leave them to thaw and rise. You can also thaw them slowly in the refrigerator the night before you plan to bake them.

I cut these in bite-size rectangles like we got at the mall.  More fun to eat them this way.  I turned the oven on warm and let it rise there 25 mins.  Then I baked 16 mins at 400 degrees.  I buttered and coated with cinnamon sugar and placed in sealed container (while warm).  It keeps it soft when stored this way.  My family loves them.  If you leave it out in the open, it will get hard.  This is a keeper recipe.  I used half the dough one day and the other half the next day.  it still came out perfect each time.  microwave 10 secs if you want to warm them up before eating.

I haven't made actual bread items in years, but I wanted to give the dough hook some use from my Kitchenaid. So I followed this recipe except changed a few things. Instead of cutting dough into 32 pieces, I cut into 16 which made bigger pretzels. This is perfect for using these as rolls for pretzel sandwiches. I also brushed with egg mixture and salt, but once they came out of the oven I also put melted butter on top. Make sure you store these in a airtight container/bag and you can easily store or freeze them and warm up in mixrowave for about 15 seconds. Super moist and chewy. I'll make these again!

Great recipe! just did something different, after combining all the ingredients, I cover and put on a warm place (on top of the refrigerator will do the trick) and after one hour the doug was ready to use.

WOW! These were great! The kids loved them! I cut the recipe in half (don't ask how I got half an egg...), and took the advice of another reviewer and omitted the egg wash and used butter. The best part is, I just put everything in my bread machine on the dough cycle! After my machine did all of the hard work for me, I just followed the rest of the directions, except the refrigeration time. They turned out great, and everyone said they were better than the ones you get at the mall. We did have a few left over, and they are still pretty good the next day, if you microwave it for about 10 seconds. Next time, I will probably cook half, and refrigerate the dough, and bake the rest the next day. Thanks for a great recipe!

Even better than the mall pretzels. I changed the toppings too with butter plus cinnamon and sugar for my daughter, garlic salt for my son, and sea salt for my husband. Served with sauces like cheese dip, and different kinds of mustard. This is a favorite snack for all, before and/or after dinner.

These were fantastic, Just like you get in NY/NJ, after shaping them and let them rise for a half hour, I then boiled them in water with some baking soda for 25 seconds, I then made two variations for toppings, For the salt I made the wash from a 1/4 stick of butter melted, 1 egg yoke and 4 tbls of water brushed on and sprinkled coarse salt, I also pan fried garlic, butter, oregano and basil and brushed on and topped with parmesan cheese, everyone loved it

Not that these tasted bad, but I didn't think they tasted any different from regular homemade breadsticks--they weren't really soft pretzels.  I took reviewers advice and brushed the dough with butter instead of egg and made half with cinnamon sugar and half with garlic basil.  The oven time was off too--mine were done within 10 minutes.

Mmmm, quite a good recipe. I recommend brushing the top of the pretzels with melted butter after they are baked, then sprinkle with course salt. SO good!

These were very very good!  Followed the recipe as written and followed the advice of others to drop in boiling water with baking soda for 15 seconds.  They came out perfect!  I made these into hamburger buns and got rave reviews.  A word of caution...  they are very addicting, you can't just stop at one!  Thanks for sharing..

This is a terrific recipe!  But I don't make pretzels with it.  I use this dough to make stuffed pockets.  I have used pizza fixings, and ground beef, onions and cheese.
It is GREAT!  I still use the egg wash and sprinkle the salt.
same cook time.  I brown ground beef and italian sausage, but veggies cook in pretzel.   make up your favorite!  Enjoy.

We love making this recipe. Our 3 year old daughter asks to help make them. They are delicious and oh so much better than the ones you can get at the mall. We make the whole recipe and freeze them, but they never last too long in our household. This recipe is a keeper!

This recipe made great pretzels...a whole lot of them...however it was quite a process to make them and I never did get the shape right. I fully recommend boiling them in the baking soda/water. It really helps with the outer color and texture.

I don't know what I did wrong.  Like Brandi, mine did not come out shiny or chewy or anything like a pretzel.  They were more just like bread.  They still tasted good but not what I was expecting.

I used Brown sugar and also did the baking soda wash. They came out perfect. Great recipe! Also dipped a few in beer batter and put in the fryer and received rave reviews on both.

The pretzels turned out pretty well for my first try.  I took some reviewers' advice and used the melted butter versus the egg wash.  I only wish they were as good heated up the next day.

They were okay.  I didn't use the entire amount of flour recommended, but they still ended up tasting very strongly of flour.  They didn't have the pretzel texture, more of a bread texture.  I'll probably look for a new recipe.

These were easy to make and tasted good when eaten warm.  As they cooled, they got kind of dry.  When they came out of the oven, I sprayed them with spray butter and dipped them in cinnamon sugar- yumm!

These were delicious and difficult to walk away from. Made more than my wife and I could eat and they really lost their quality when reheated, but fresh from the oven they were amazing!

Great pretzels but next time I will reduce the sugar by half (the salt covered pretzels had a little too much sweetness for me).  I made half of the pretzels sweet by brushing them with butter (instead of egg) and dusted them with brown sugar and cinnamon.  After they cool put them in a zip lock and they'll stay soft for you!!

I was at first worried that the pretzels wouldn't turn out right; I have found it a bit tricky working with yeast in the past. But wow, this recipe was so easy and the taste was incredible. I will definetly be making these again... really soon!

These were great!!!! The dough was perfect....easy to roll into as thick or thin a rope as you want, very strechy and pliable.  I'm a baking newbie so I wasn't sure about refrigerating the dough. Would it rise? Yes it did! I did boil the pretzels in water, baking soda and half a bottle of beer for about 20-30 seconds and placed them on the baking sheet. Then I basted in melted butter (I used the egg wash and butter methods...didnt really notice a difference as far as outer color/crunch between the two, so stuck with butter for the flavor) then sprinkled kosher salt, garlic powder on top. 
Finally, baked at 400 for only 13 minutes since the boiling water bath seemed to jump-start the cooking process. 

P.S. I cut the recipe in half and got about 18-20 medium sized pretzels.

Just ok. Mine came out chewy and pretty good on the inside, but the outside was all wrong. Not shiny or chewy or anything like what I've come to expect in a pretzel.

These pretzels are very good.  I had to keep on adding flour because the dough was really sticky at 1st.  But once I got the right consistency, I was able to form them into the pretzel shape.  
After they were done baking, I brushed the pretzels with melted butter and sprinkled them with garlic powder & a little bit of salt.  YUM.

So easy and so perfect.  I just wish I could get mine to look like the picture.  They were delicious.  I think this is one of my favorite recipes for this.  Thanks for the post.

I added half a teaspoon of cinnamon to the batter and then sprinkled brown sugar on top instead of salt. They made a great dessert/snack and my family loved them.

These pretzels had good consistency but were too sweet for our taste. They were difficult to roll and shape. I will continue to look for a recipe that works.
