This was amazing. I served these on buns with Spicy Hot Garlic Chutney (also found on this site) and the Raita recipe from this submitter. I fried the patties in ghee in a cast iron skillet, pressing down with spatula when placed in pan and when flipped (to keep them nice and flat) and topped with cheese. The only change that I made was that instead of adding plain raw onions into the meat mixture, I used lightly pickled red onions instead.

A huge hit in my household and definitely a keeper and will be making many, many times in the future in place of plain American burgers.

This was great! I did make a couple of changes. One by choice and the other due to a miscommunication on directions. I'll start with the one by choice. Tomatoes. Hubs hates them. While I would have liked the tomato in the center of the patty, sneaking in the chopped ones was as far as I felt comfortable with. In his defense, I love tomatoes but cooked ones go a long way. Change #2 was simply an error on my part with the directions. I bought a red onion but used it for the quick pickle the recipe mentions. Once I realized the onion was supposed to go in the patty it was too late. I sprinkled some onion powder in the mix and called it good. While this was a mistake and error in my part, I think the onion powder worked just fine. Just don't skip the quick red pickle step and you have yourself a winner!

the recipe was easy, it turned out great. No breaking while frying or anything. For best taste, serve with handmade roti/chapati and raita
