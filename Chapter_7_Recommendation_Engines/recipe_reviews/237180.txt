I altered the recipe,
1 tsp of baking powder
1 tbsp of water at a time until the dough was the right consistency
Approx 3 tbsp of extra Nutella
It turned out a much better consistency!
I also baked for only 12 minutes then checked to see if they were done

Just OK. I think I would increase the sugar to 3T or even 1/4 cup. I followed quantities exactly & produced not a dough but a batter which I dropped by spoonfuls onto a greased cookie sheet. The recipe made about a bakers dozen. Yes they were quick & easy but my family & I thought they were mediocre at best.

The dough was a sticky mess impossible to roll into balls.

I could not get the right texture or consistency out of the dough, and it wouldn’t even turn into dough. I put a ton of flour and a ton of baking powder into it and nothing happened. It’s a bad recipe and you can’t make anything out of it, personally I would not advise anyone to use this...

This looked good so my students made a batch each so that was 8 batches couldn't pay them to eat them.
