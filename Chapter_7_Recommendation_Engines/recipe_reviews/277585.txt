12.29.19  I only had one can of crescent dough, so I halved the recipe and baked in a 6-1/2”x8-1/2” glass baking dish.  Obviously, the texture will not be like a danish you’d buy at the bakery, but it also doesn’t taste like biscuit dough, and the cheesy filling is spot on delicious!  And so darn easy, the perfect choice for a lazy Sunday morning breakfast. Replacing the cheesy filling with lemon curd also might be a nice variation. Thanks for sharing your recipe, enjoyed it.
