Made as written except that I eliminated the liquid smoke due to the ham I used was leftover from one I smoked. This is really good but if you don't have all of these different beans on hand you could just buy one of those 16 ounces packages of mixed beans. I want to say they call it 15 bean soup? Anyway, use whatever dry beans you like or whichever ones you have on hand. I made as written but any dry beans would work nicely as long as you use 16 ounces. Note I also used Rotel with diced green chilies for my tomatoes and I did  not drain them.

Yes, I used each type of beans, but the canned version. Used much less garlic & Liquid Smoke. Turned out extremely well.
