This was yummy Helena.  My grandmother and I made 2 cakes for our vacation and they were very well recieved.  I can see where adding some chocolate chips in the batter may make it extra yummy!

The cake was O.k. - but dry - I only baked it for 55 minutes (like I do ALL of my pound cakes in loaf pans - would have been totally burnt if cooked for the full time).

this recipe is good, but mild.  if you're a chocoate lover...look elsewhere.  my husband prefers the other chocolate poundcake on this website though.  i think it's just too mild for him. it did make 3 loafs though.

This is good but it's not quite what I expected.  I ended up baking it for 65 minutes, and it was a bit crunchy around the edges but tender and moist on the inside.  I used White Lily flour which made it a bit lighter than it would have been with AP flour.  It's not a heavy chocolate taste but I liked it.  For those who say it didn't have much chocolate flavor at all, be sure you're using dutch processed cocoa - it's darker and has a deeper chocolate flavor.  Overall, it's good but I think it'd be a good companion of something else - whipped cream, ice cream, maybe raspberries.  It just seems to need a little something.
