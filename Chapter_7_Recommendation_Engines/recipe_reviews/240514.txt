I hate to rate a new recipe even averagly, but this was just too hot for me with the cajun spice. It also seems like it just needs something. Even meat chicken or sausage might do the trick. I followed recipe, just doing 1 less can of beans. I might see if I can save this by turning it into a soup or something else. It did make quite a bit for just 2 of us. Having had a meal plan in college I am surprised this was served in the cafeteria at the dorms. 20 years ago we paid 800~1000 a month for a meal plan. I would have been pretty displeased if the main dish was cooked white rice and a can of beans.

This is a good base recipe but bland as is.  I plan on making this on New Year’s Day for luck. I would recommend adding a bell pepper, 1 carrot, and celery diced very fine along with onion and garlic (to taste but 2 cloves minimum). Also add 1 can of tomatos (or fresh diced or Rotel) reserving juice. I add the juice then top off with the veggie stock in a measuring cup. Along with Cajun seasoning adding some smoked paprika, or liquid smoke to taste, Mrs. dash and a bay leave. I will also use brown rice, for added nutrition. Increase liquids a half cup  and cooking 10-15 minutes if using brown rice. Finish dish with salt, pepper, squeeze of lime, and/or some chopped parsley or cilantro to add freshness to dish

I was looking for some healthy meals as my son has high cholesterol. This is so easy and so good, just as is. No need to add anything. Both of my sons (18 and 21) really like this. I didn't have Cajun seasoning on hand, so I did substitute with homemade taco seasoning from this site. I've made this twice now, and I will definitely be making it again. Thanks for s great recipe!

This is really good!  I added red bell pepper with the onions.  Upped the Cajun seasoning to 1 tsp.  Perfect for Vegetarian guests or would work nicely as a side dish or healthy lunch.  Thanks!

We are diabetic and I make rice all the time.  If you roast the rice in the pan you are using to cook it in, the starch is converted and not such a problem for the blood sugar.  This also makes the rice fluffy so I do it for all rice dishes except Japanese where you might like sticky rice.  You could use minute rice or Uncle Ben's otherwise but I like to convert our own rice.   Hubby hates beans.  His mom served them all the time because there were 9 children and a small budget.  I would love this recipe but I think I will make it with the barracho (drunken beans made with beer) beans which are a little spicy.

it sounds great but i cant stand black eyed peas-can i substitute rinsed black beans or any other kind of bean besides black eyed peas-or does that ruin the whole new years mystique -i dont think it would harm the taste

Yum! I didn't have onion so I sauteed celery, tomatillos,  and tomatoes instead and added onion powder. also I put in chopped fresh spinach and chives at the end. It came out creamy and flavorful.

It was actually good, but only after I added two cloves of garlic, carrots, and some Cajun mirepoix as well as a bay leaf to the rice.

I couldn’t find black eyes peas so I used cannellini beans. Also added carrots, peppers, celery, and ground turkey to make it a full meal hitting all the food groups. Instead of Cajun seasoning just used whatever I had on hand. Flavorful and def easy and cheap.

It seemed ok but a bit bland, so I added a can of tomatoes and upped the Cajun Spice mix to a full teaspoon. Wow! This is so easy and quick. I will make this again and again. Thank you!

The recipe is very good! I'd suggest following the rice bag's recipe for drier rice. I also pressure cooked black eyed peas for 1 minute on low and let it natural pressure release. I should have released it manually bc it ended up being a little mushy.

Super quick and easy - a good meal for weeknights when you're in a hurry.  When my vegetarian daughter isn't home, I put a little cooked meat in there - whatever I have on hand. It's good with or without meat.

Sorry, I think this recipe is bland as it is written. I had to add lots of seasonings to be able to eat it. It’s a good base though and if you like black eyed peas adding tomato helps it’s flavor.

Tasty and filling meatless casserole.  I added roasted okra and poblano chiles to give it a little more umph.

I made this with what I had on hand and changed up a bit. The only thing is, I didnt want a vegan recipe but this was closest to how I wanted to work it. I had jasmine rice so I cooked that in chicken broth. I substituted leeks for onions, added some crumbled bacon and used a bit more cajun spice mix. The family pronounced it delicious so its going in the dinner rotation.

Delicious and gluten free! I made a few changes- I steamed my long grain rice in my rice cooker with chicken stock rather than cooking on the stove. I added 1 diced green pepper to my onions. I added a can of diced tomatoes (undrained) with my 2 cans of black eyed peas. I served on a bed of baby spinach/arugula. Great dinner.

I made the recipe,  it turned out to be very delicious and easy to make I used Ol bay seasoning ,  I did add red pepper flakes
To heat it up,   My wife doesn’t like black eyed peas so her opinion doesn’t count. Ha Ha.

I read the other reviews and made the following changes:
I added 1 diced red pepper and 1 stalk of diced celery to the onion.  I added 1 can of diced tomatoes with chili peppers including the liquid. I only added 1 can of black eyed peas. I made it for a gluten sensitive relative and it was delicious.

Tripled recipe and used one can each seasoned chili beans and red beans with 2 cans blackeyed peas. Used half white half brown rice, 3+ tsps creole seasoning and threw in some leftover chopped ham and sausage. Delicious. Next time i will add chopped veggies to the onions. A keeper!

I'm one of those people who cares without making, as I'm diabetic and rice is poison. But my mom grew up in Low Country South Carolina and said Hopping John HAD to have crushed or stewed tomatoes! No wonder people think this is bland. I personally think it needs more hot sauce as well. Ours was a bean and tomato stew served over rice.

Think I was  a little heavy on the vegetable broth in the rice. Definitely will make again. But I'll add carrots like in your photo.
