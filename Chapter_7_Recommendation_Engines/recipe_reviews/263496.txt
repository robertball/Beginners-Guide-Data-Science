I have a bacon lover at my house, so cooked some bacon and used a bit of the grease for the shrimp and onions/garlic. I also sauteed some garlic for the shrimp and added a bit of Old Bay. It was good!

No flavor. If you make it be sure to add any kind of Italian seasonings that you may like. I added Old Bay to give it a seafood flare.

I cut the portions back to 3 and made no other changes. This would have been so much better with the traditional bacon but I understand that the submitter was aiming for a low fat dish. Thanks for sharing.
