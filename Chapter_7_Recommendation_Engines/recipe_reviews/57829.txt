Best jerky recipe I have found so far! I left out the hot sauce because I don't like anything very spicy and wasn't sure. Still turned out excellent. I used elk and deer.

My dad brought some ground venison down over Christmas and him and my husband set out to make jerky. They did not use MSG and added some jalapeno for some heat. This turned out pretty good. If your dehydrator does not come with a jerky gun I recommend investing in one. It makes things so much easier. I think this could use more seasoning and heat but overall a good recipe for ground venison jerky.

I am allergic to MSG  so I left it out and it tasted fine. The curing salt is sufficient to cure the meat, especially if you cut the strips first and leave them in the mixture in the refrigerator overnight. Remember that, with meat curing, the goal is to cure all the way through, not just the edges like smoking. And unless you want to dry your meat until they are like potato chips, I am afraid this might be unsafe the way it is presented. Two hours is not enough time for the curing salts to penetrate, so eat it quick!
