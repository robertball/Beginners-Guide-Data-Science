I made this recipe and I loved it.  I love all kinds of salsa with many different ingredients.  This is good with chicken or pork, I also put some on top of my salads for a refreshing change.  I like hot spicy food so I used more hot peppers.  I will definitely make again!

Made for Recipe Group. I used parsley instead of cilantro, as I am not a fan of cilantro. A little too much melon, but nice flavors overall. Paired well with the grilled Unbelievable Chicken! Thanks for the recipe.

Thank you everyone for trying this.  I made this again yesterday and substituted a diced red bell pepper for the Roma tomato.  It added a wonderful crispness and sweetness to the salad.  Enjoy

We thought this was Fabulous! Served it over a spicy-grilled white fish and it was the perfect accompaniment. Word to the wise - this makes A LOT! So unless you're feeding a crowd, consider halving the recipe.

It was just OK.  Somehow, the flavors just didn't meld somehow to my taste. Won't make again.

I halved this recipe in an attempt to salvage what was not a very flavorful melon.  Great results!!  Since my cantaloupe was not very sweet, I added a small squirt of agave syrup.  Also, a sprinkling of cayenne for more punch.  We ate the salsa with tortilla chips and served it on homemade chicken/spinach burgers.

Recipe Group Selection:  27, July 2013 ~ Once again I am behind on making the recipe group pick - but so glad I tried this one.  Loved the combination of the fruits, veggies and spiciness of the jalapeños.  I served this this flour tortilla chips and guacamole tortilla chips.  It was great with both, but I can see where this would lend excellent flavor for chicken, pork or fish dishes.  With fresh cantaloupe still in season, I will be making this recipe again.  Thank you Theresa787 for sharing your recipe.

Recipe Group selection for July 27, 2013:  I couldn’t agree more with Theresa787’s description for this salsa as light, fresh and delightful.   It’s also addicting.  For me, it could use a little more acid, so I would add a smidgeon more lime juice.  This is a keeper.

Excellant recipe s definite keeper! Made some small changes: 1)  decrease the cilantro to 1/2 bunch (size depends on where you buy a bunch). 2) Add 2 "small" limes instead of 1 "medium/large" 3) Use 3/4 Tbsp of Avocado Oil instead of Olive Oil....

Really liked this. Used it on salmon but plan on also using it on chicken.

Made for recipe group but quartered the recipe. It still made a good two cups. A bunch is relative, but I used nowhere near the amount of cilantro called for. I served this with grilled chicken and the marinade on the chicken was a little too strong and overpowered a bit so I would  use a plainer chicken recipe next time to get more of the salsa flavor. I used one small jalapeno (about 1.5" long)

Nice and light for a hot summer afternoon. I'm not sure the one roma tomato added much except color.
