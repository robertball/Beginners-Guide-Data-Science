I was divided between this recipe and French Dip Sandwiches by Giselle from this site so I sort of combined the two and it turned out incredible!  All I added to this was 1/2 c. of soy sauce, 1 tsp. of minced garlic, 1 tsp. of rosemary, and 1 tsp. of thyme.  During the last 4 hours of cooking I also added a large onion sliced into 1/2 inch rings.  I broiled the rolls with swiss cheese and these were some of the best french dip sanwiches ever!

Awesome and easy recipe:) I made a roast for lunch and it was too tough so I threw it into a crockpot with all of the ingredients except the Fr.Onion condensed soup as I did not have any, so I just added a 1/2 packet of Lipton Onion Soup Mix with 1 can of H2O and 6 hours later, I had wonderful French Dip sandwiches. (the meat was finally tender) I took the advice of some others and toasted the steak rolls and that was perfect, THANKS!!! Next time I will saute some mushrooms and put some cheese on them also!! THANKS AGAIN!!!

very good. make sure to use a crusty roll, I suggest lightly toasting the rolls under the broiler and melting a piece of mozzarella or provolone on top. make sure to use the au jus for dipping, it makes the sandwich.

UPDATE! I was the first to review this recipe and thought I'd share, I didn't have time for the crockpot so I browned it and cooked it in a pressure cooker and it was still fantastic.  A little bit different flavor, so now I brown it before I put it in the crock pot -- WONDERFUL-- some Mozzerella cheese and of course MAYO on the toasted buns YUMMY
This hit the spot!!! Fantastic flavor and super easy!  I'll be making this on a regular basis, my husband raved about it.  OH -- don't forget to put mayo on your bun after it's toasted!!  YUMMY!!

Yummy to the max, with a couple of substitutions I made. I subbed the consomme for red wine and used French Onion Soup from the carton, that is ready to eat. Worked wonderfully, I used a sirloin tip roast and cooked it until it was tender but not falling apart. After letting it rest for a bit it Sliced for the sandwiches excellently. Definitely will use again.

Easy Easy Easy and delicious French Dip. Followed directions exactly and everyone loved it.  Had leftovers and fixed them this way.  Julienned green peppers and onions and sauted in olive oil on stove top grill.  Then added shredded beef to heat.  Divided into portions and topped with pepper jack cheese.  Heat until cheese melts.  Transfer portions onto toasted hoagie rolls.  Cut on diagonal for dipping in remaining au jus.  I'm craving these again just writing about them.

this was really good. i would not recommend just putting the meat on the bread. i broiled the buns til they were toasty and then i put a slice of american cheese on it to melt. i put mayonaise afterwards and then the meat. it was very tasty. otherwise if you dont add anything else its pretty plain.

Yummy ! Keep in mind that it shrinks when you cook it in a slow cooker. I wish I would have bought more meat. Toasting a roll w/ butter and garlic powder and then throwing it back under the broiler w/ pepper jack cheese made it extra tasty !

Yummy! The whole family loved this and it was so easy.  Like some other reviewers, I broiled some split hoagie type rolls first, after that I added the beef, topped off with some swiss cheese and back in the broiler a minute to melt the cheese.  This is going to be a regular at our house!

This is a really great recipe.  It is really easy to make.  Toasting the rolls makes it a lot better though.  I also added swiss cheese and sauteed mushrooms.

Wow! What a wonderful recipe.  We cut our roast in half.  Used 6 oz of red wine. and 2 oz of water, (we didn't use beef broth) and 3 teaspoons of boiullon granules and cooked our roast for 8 hours on low.  followed the recipe and served on home made italian bread.  It was fantastic.  We will definetly use this recipe again.  My husband and I plan to eat the left overs on Sunday.  We used provelone cheese slices.  We will toast our bread and melt the chees first.

So good! I don't have a slow cooker so I browned  the roast in a pot added the liquid ingredients except for the onion soup, I added extra beef stock instead. Put a lid on and baked it in the oven for 3 hours at 350. Toasted a roll, sliced the roast added some swiss cheese and dipped it in the au jus. YUM! UPDATE: I brown the pot roast in my dutch oven, add 2 cans beef broth, 1 can beef consomme and simmer on the stove top for 4 1/2 hours. DELISH!

This is an awesome recipe....instead of the beef granules, I added a package of dry onion soup mix in addition to the canned, and 2 tsp of minced wet garlic and it was good enough to eat as a soup when done......

This is incredible!  So easy to just put in the slow cooker, and hours later it's done!  I don't change anything, but I toast the bread (french roll) in the oven for 5 minutes wiht some provolone atop, saute some mushrooms and DELICIOUSNESS awaits!  Thank you!

Wonderful!  I just used a can of beef broth, french onion soup, and a packet of beef onion soup mix.  I also sliced my meat and then put it back in the crock pot with the juice for about thirty minutes.  The sandwiches were great!

This was incredible. Instead of a slow cooker I first seared the meat in a dutch oven then placed all ingredients in the over at about 200 degrees and let it slow cook about 6 hours. I can't wait to make it again.

I LOVE this and was sooooooooo easy!!  I added a Tbsp of instant coffee to the broth.  And broil toasted the inside of the roll in toaster oven and added a slice of provolone cheese--gave it  crispy texture.

Our family really enjoyed this last night. I will be making again. I will say I had no idea what consumme was and ended up in the soup isle for my other ingredients. It was right there with the broth and other condensed ingredients. (just incase others are also as confused as I was)

Cooked this for 8 hours on low and it was perfect.  The kids even ate it, and this is way outside of their comfort zone.

tasted great! I had leftover pot roast from the night before, and just reheated that and heated the soups on the stove. Added swiss cheese to the rolls. Perfect!

My husband LOVES this.  The au jus is so wonderful.  I used a rump roast--don't know if that matters.  It was very tender and good.  I also toasted the rolls and added provolone cheese under the broiler.

This recipe was very good.  Tasty and easy to make.  The only difficulty I had was trying to skim that fat from the gravy, but that could just be me not doing something right.

Easy, Easy, Easy...This was very good. I did as others suggested, used toasted poboy bread, mayo, and provolone, with lettuce and tomato. I would suggest adding some more seasonings while it cooks and...ONLY thing I did to this recipe, those I was tempted, to do moare, was add was a little salt and pepper to the meat and gravy after beef was shredded and returned to the cooker. Thanks :)

This meat cooked up truly - fork-tender.  It was in the slow cooker on high for 5 hours.  I lifted the meat out, trimmed the fat layer and shredded with 2 forks and returned the meat to the juice until I was ready to serve it.  We had this with 'Slow Cooker Creamed Corn' and 'Cheesy Ranch Potato Bake', both recipes from AR.

This is a great, easy recipe the whole family will love!  I have made it several times and used both a chuck roast and a rump roast, and each time it turned out perfectly.  I usually butter and toast sub rolls then add the shredded beef with sauteed onions and top with provolone cheese.  After a few minutes under the broiler they are ready to serve!

This was SO good! And quick and easy too! All I had was condensed beef broth, so I used 3 cans of that, a sliced onion, and I had some no sodium French Onion Dip Mix, so I added a couple tblsps of that too. I let it cook all day long, and made some fresh buns to serve it on. Very tasty!

This is now a regular in our menu. I found that it is easier to trim the fat before cooking instead of skimming it later. instead of condensed soup I used my old standby Lipton Onion Soup mix and substituted beef base for the beef bouillon. It was very salty and savory, YUM! And I didn't know what consumme was, but after I bought it and smelled it I knew it wouldn't be good. It has a tomato base that would have totally messed up the flavor. I served it with toasted buns, sauteed mushrooms and onions, tomatoes, lettuce, provolone cheese and horseradish mayo. It was a huge hit. It was even better the next day, and after the meat is gone the juice made a great condensed soup for one final lunch!

This was so beefy and delicious. I used 2 cans of consomme since I didn't have broth. Very simple and it made enough for 6 sandwiches. I used wheat submarine rolls. My husband wants some cheese type sauce so he can make it like Arby's beef and cheddar. A great use for an inexpensive chuck roast, thanks!

I absolutely screwed this recipe up.  I bought the wrong soup, opened the wrong soup, used the wrong soup and then forgot the bouillon.  That kind of day.  However, it turned out great and the meat was tender.  I toasted the bread and melted provolone over the meat.  I then used mayo and horseradish to finish it off with a side of the aus jus.  Great recipe and I'm excited to try it the way it was intended.

Great flavor and so easy to put together. I used 1 can progresso french onion soup and one can beef broth and let it cook for about 8 hours and it was delicious and tender. Served on toasted rolls. Next time I might add some provolone or swiss cheese.

These were great! I seasoned my chuck roast with Emeril's Essence and black pepper and browned it in olive oil before putting it in the slow cooker. I added minced garlic, sliced onions, Worcestershire sauce, lots of black pepper,a pinch sugar and a couple bay leaves. So tasty! I served them on toasted hoagie rolls with melted provolone. We ate these for two nights, once with french fries and once with onion rings. There isn't a crumb left! Thank you! Thank you to the reviewer who suggested straining the juice through a mesh strainer and coffee filter. It took awhile, but I had my hubby do it and it was worth it. The juice was delicious and not greasy at all!

Good but the juice was too salty to us. May be my fault though because I didn't follow this recipe all the way. I added a pkg of the au ju mix and ommitted the consumme and beef bouillon. I also seasoned with salt, pepper and garlic. Added 3/4 cup of water. Toasted buns and added provolone cheese. We dipped in sauce. My husband was impressed. Thank you.

According to my husband, this is the best beef I ever made!  The only change I made was out of necessity, I didn't have a can of french onion soup, so I used an extra can of consumme and a package of dry onion dip mix and it seemed to substitute just fine!  Would recommend this recipe to everyone!

Yeah!  I made these for my sister's birthday because she loves french dips.  She was totally happy with them!  I doubled the recipe because between us, our kids and hubbies are big eaters.  I also sauteed some onions, green peppers, and mushrooms for the ones that wanted that kind of thing.  I buttered and toasted the deli rolls before assembling the sandwiches and after, layered on sliced provolone and stuck under the broiler until the cheese melted.  As for the broth...I wanted a clear broth with as little grease as possible.  However, I didn't think of making these far enough in advance to stick it in the fridge to solidify.  Nor do I have a seperator.  I DO have a hand-held mesh strainer (I would guess it's about 2 cup size or so).  I placed a coffee filter inside it, placed it over a saucepan, ladled in some broth, and let it strain through.  When all of that broth was through and just sludge was left in the bottom of the filter, I changed to a clean coffee filter and repeated.  It took about 20 minutes and 10 coffee filters to strain a double batch of the broth, but it was SOOOO worth it.  I just placed the saucepan over low heat and let it stay warm while I assembled the sandwiches.  I am definitely making these again!

This was easy to make and the whole family loved it.  We followed the recipe as written except we added mushrooms just because we like mushrooms on our beef sandwiches. All we did was throw them in the cooker near the end. I don't think they changed the flavor of the recipe overall, they were just an added bonus that suits our particular tastes.  I can also see other great possibilities using this recipe as a base, too, but it's so good the way that it is that I would be hesitant to tinker with it even though I generally tinker with recipes a great deal. 

When I asked my husband for a review of this one he said "the only I problem with the recipe was that I had to remind our son to swallow before stuffing his mouth again".  Our entire family from age 4 to 44 was pleased with this one and we will definitely make it again!!

I didn't follow the directions 100%, but I will next time.  I rushed it by cooking it on high for four hours rather than on low for 8.  The meat wasn't as fall-apart as I thought it would be, but it was plenty tasty.

I served it at a potluck with provolone and horseradish cheddar on the side.  It's such a versatile recipe - thicken the juice with a little cornstarch and you have a really good gravy.  You can spoon the mixture over a baked potato or make an open faced roast beef sandwich.  Or add some mushrooms, a little sour cream and sherry, and serve over noodles as beef stroganoff.

This was great I shredded only 1/2 of the roast to serve with the dip and sliced the other half for roast beef sandwiches the next day for lunches. Enjoyed by all.

Excellent!  I put this in the crock pot around 9am this morning and we had dinner at 5pm.  The roast was so tender and it tasted fantastic.  I added some oregano and garlic powder.  I didn't add the beef bouillon.  I also toasted the rolls in the oven for a few minutes.  My husband thought this recipe was great also.

Such a great recipe for game day...I served it with Chicken Wing dip.  Just make sure you trim the meat really well and skim any fat off of the au jus.  I used angus and it was better than when the meat was not high quality.  Thanks so much for sharing this one!

I love French dips & this was a great recipe! I served the meat on toasted hoagie rolls (no cheese) and the family loved it - my husband ate until he could eat no more (there was none left!). This was so easy and yummy - I will use my fat separator next time to remove some more of the fat from the juice.

We will never buy deli roast beef again for French Dip!  This is so good!  I didnt have time for the crock pot so just browned the beef and put it in a covered pan in the oven at 425 for two hours.  Delicious au jus and plenty of it.  Thanks!

We loved this.  I could not find beef consomme, or the condensed French onion soup where I live, so I used all beef broth and a package of dry French onion soup mix and just added the water called for by the soup.  YUM-O!

This was an easy and delicious meal.  The au jus created in the pot is better than anything you can buy at the store.

Amazing!  Servings says 8, but this recipe feeds our family of 4 (with 2 kids under 12) perfectly!  We all love it so much that it has become our weekly Sunday night dinner.

I did things a little different on this one, I used stew meat put it in the crock-pot with 1/2 can of onion soup(campbells) and 1/2 can of beef broth, left it overnight for about 12 hours on low. I then drained most of the juice out let it simmer ofr another hour, then took some out for sandwiches. I tiasted the rolls, put cheese on the and mayo and they were fab!!! Thanks for a great base recipe!!!

I made this tonight and it was so good.  My Mom visited and she loved it too.  My roast was about 2.5 lbs. and it was on low for about 10 hours.  We also topped our sandwiches with swiss cheese.  It was just great...thanks!

This was outstanding!  It delicious, easy, and all of my "picky eaters" loved it!  My husband put barbecue sauce on his, my daughter ate hers with ketchup, and I tried it as stated, using the dip.  It was spectacular!!!!  I am making it again this weekend!

Trust a fellow Nebraskan (where we have the VERY BEST beef!) to come up with a great recipe!! Carla - this was so yummy and so easy to do. Leftovers are great for quick lunches during the week. Hubby loved it. Great recipe for any time of the year. Thanks!! We will be making this all winter long.

Excellent recipe...we loved it.  I just added a little garlic and some thyme to boost the flavor.  The meat just fell apart and the au jus was excellent.  I broiled the buns with a little butter and some provolone cheese.  A definite keeper!

I made this once exactly like instructed!  Great!  The next time I used a packet of onion soup mix  and beef broth because that was what I had and it was great too!  I toasted some frozen garlic Texas toast in the toaster over for about 4 min turned it once and put some mozzerella cheese on top then add some of the shredded beef on top of the cheese!  Took about 10 min. tops!  And it is now a new family favorite!  Thanks for the recipe

This is definitely a keeper.  The au jus is fantastic for dipping the sandwiches in.  My only problem is I think I left it in the crock pot too long and it got a little more dried out than I'd like but the au jus kept anyone from really noticing.  Will definitely make again.

Excellent. I have played with it a few times and even if you only have chicken broth and french onion soup just add some extra beef bullion and it still tastes awesome.

This is a wonderfully delicous and easy recipe to make.  I use this at least once or twice a month.  I serve it on toasted keisers with provolone cheese and serve the juice on the side.

Very good!!  I even was told that it was the best french dip my father in law ever had.  I added salt and pepper to the meat itself to spice it up a bit and toasted mozzarella cheese on some flaky rolls.   I actually have another one cooking in the slow cooker right now for the Superbowl.  I'm planning on using fairly small rolls for more of an appetizer feel to it. Thanks for posting this recipe!

This gets 5 stars for ease and for flexibility.  Taste wise, I had to add some garlic to spice it up a bit. My husband ate it on a toasted french roll with provolone cheese and peppers. I ate it as is. For leftovers, I stirred in some sour cream and had stroganoff. Yummy!

Very good, I cooked it about 8 hours, added a extra can of beef broth because I could not find beef consomme. This was easy to prepare and tasted great.

I have seen this recipe before in my Simple & Delicious hardcover cookbook and flagged the page b/c I wanted to try it. I was plesantly surprised to find it on Allrecipes.com! Made this for my bf and I (halved the recipe). We both liked it, but not enough (at least for me) to make again. I followed other reviewer's suggestions to toast my sub rolls and spread with a mayo/garlic spread. I liked the mayo, but my bf didn't : ) Served wtih three-bean salad (from a can) and curly fries (which are good dipped in the juice). Leftovers went untouched. A real bummer, especially b/c this is INSANELY easy to prepare. Thanks for sharing anyways.

Very good!  I've never had french dip before so I have nothing to compare it to.  I used a two pound roast just because I didn't want leftovers for a week.  Also used a leaner cut of meat than called for.  Other than that followed directions.  Probably left it in slow cooker for 8 hours.  the meat shredded great.  The first time we had it we served it plain on the rolls. When we had it for leftovers, we added sauted mushrooms and cheese and made garlic bread ro serve it on.  Oh yum!  Will make the beef as written and serve with these changes.  Loved the beef and sauce!  Thanks for this great and super easy recipe.

This was so great.  I made it exactly as the recipe said, and it was perfect.  We toasted some French bread rolls and melted Swiss cheese on them before serving.  I will make this again and again!

Fantastic!  The meat was extremely tasty and spiced perfectly.  I broiled the buns with some provolone cheese and then topped with meat.  Will make again and again!

This was delicious--especially since you have the change to get all the fat out before serving!  I doubled the amount of sauce since we all love a lot of juice for dipping, and it's a good thing I did because without the juice the sandwich would have been a bit dry.  Very yummy with toasted buns and swiss cheese!  Thanks!

This was very easy to prepare in the morning before I went to work and I came home to a pretty easy to fix supper.  I broiled these on submarine rolls with swiss cheese and also prepared horseradish sauce to put on them.  The au jus was delicious.  My only dissapointment was the meat was not as tender as I expected but I think this was due to the meat itself and not the preparation.  Definitely a keeper.

Thought this made a really good beef for sandwiches. Tender and well seasoned. I put it in the pressure cooker and it turned out great.

My daughter loved this and she usually does not like roast beef sandwiches, her only request add more onions other than what is just in the french onion soup.
