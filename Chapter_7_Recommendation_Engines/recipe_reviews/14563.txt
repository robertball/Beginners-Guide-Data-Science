This recipe is a fine addition to my 
collection.
My kids are a bit more adventerous in
the kitchen (where ever it is) than most.
They have been cooking with me since the
age of 3.

Only average, you got to go more than that to claim the "worlds best".

These ribs were very good, I think the success of this recipe really depends on the barbeque sauce you use. I used Blue Ribbin Sweet Sauce that I received as a gift. The sauce was flavourful and I really liked the onion taste that came through from the sliced onions, but I think I would use my rib rub next time when using this method or try with Sweet Baby Ray's Hickory flavoured sauce.
