This is truly one of the BEST baked BBQ chicken recipes ever!!! I don't know how I lived without it. Here's how I altered it, based on our tastes and the other reviews: (1) used 6 thighs, not 12, (2) doubled the sauce, (3) halved the water (will omit completely next time), (4) omitted the salt, (5) added cayenne. WONDERFUL!!!!!!!! One further note.... The second time I made this, the baby started crying just as I was about to start cooking the sauce, so I threw the uncooked sauce and chicken in the oven and went on my way. We didn't notice any difference! So from now on I won't be wasting time cooking the sauce.

Very tasty!  I threw it all in the slow cooker on low for 6 hours (as opposed to the oven), and it turned out fabulously!

Thanks for sharing, this was excellent.  For those who complained the sauce was too runny there is an easy fix.  I poured the sauce over chicken breasts and baked at 375, covered, for approximately 45 min.  I removed the cooked chicken to a platter, then poured the remaining sauce into a saucepan, over med-high heat,  I added about 1/2 tsp. of cornstarch and stirred constantly.  Within minutes it was thickened & bubbly.  I then basted it over the cooked chicken and then put the chicken on the outdoor grill just to crisp it up and give it that authentic "barbeque" feel.  Everyone loved it.

Great recipe for BBQ chicken! However, I turned this into a marinade for grilling vs. baking this in the oven. I left out the water and used Heinz chili sauce vs. ketchup for a little extra kick. I also added a tsp. of liquid smoke anad some minced garlic. I put everything into a ziploc bag and let it marinate overnight. The smell was downright heavenly on the grill and the taste was fabulous!

This has GOT to be my favorite chicken recipe of all time, and my family of 5 agrees!  I used 12 boneless, skinless chicken thighs and followed the recipe to the letter.  The chicken was oh-so-tender and tasted great.  Unfortunately, there were NO leftovers!  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was so good!  I made this last night with boneless skinless chicken breasts, and it was so delicious, and also very easy.  I had never tried making my own BBQ sauce before, but this is so simple I will use this recipe from now on.  Also, the chicken was so tender it fell apart.  Wonderful!

Excellent, delicious, easy-to-make recipe. I made five changes in my preparation: soaked the meat in a salt, sugar, and spice brine for an hour, covered the pan bottom with onion slices, used honey, threw in a dash each  of cinnamon and cayenne, and I added a couple of minutes broiling time to the cooking time. While it is a "runny" sauce, it was very tasty; however, one could simmer the sauce longer and thicken it with corn starch. Some of the best chicken sauces I've had have been thin -- it's a common style where I live, Western Kentucky.

Great Recipe for BBQ chicken!  I used boneless/skinless thighs and just baked a little less time at 300 deg. Yes, sauce is thin, but very good combo of flavors (only thing I added was some garlic - Everything's better w/the big "G") Overall: Easy, used common ingredients and tasted wonderful!

We prepare this recipe using a measurement yield for 24. We like this thinner style sauce that much. We use 12 thighs instead of 24 or 6 skinless breasts or combination of each. Again, using the ingredient measurement yield for 24, reduced the water to a 1/4 cup. Add 1/2 Tsp of red pepper, 1/2 Tsp onion powder, 1/2 Tsp garlic powder. Super tender recipe. Excellent dinner to freeze leftovers. Tangy vinegar taste. If you like sweet, add more brown sugar and reduce the vinegar. A keeper recipe.

I double up everything for my family of 6 & toss it all in the slow cooker. I use boneless skinless chicken thighs & serve over rice. Leftovers are great as shredded BBQ chicken sandwiches the next day.

I'll be honest, the only reason I rated this so high, is because the recipe for the BBQ sauce is so darn good.  That's not to say this is bad, it's just that for me, I prefer BBQ chicken on an actual barbecue. As other reviewers have noted, while the chicken does indeed come out "fall off the bone" tender, it comes at a cost. Namely, it is swimming in the sauce, and in my opinion tastes more boiled then barbecued. Speaking of the sauce however...it is an EXCELLENT sauce. I've never made a homemade BBQ sauce before...I usually buy Sweet Baby Ray's bottled sauce, which is also excellent. This sauce compares VERY well with a store-bought sauce, AND it's easy to make. I only made three changes/additions to this: 1) I doubled the recipe, as it wasn't very much, and next time I may triple or quadruple it. 2) I only added 1 TBS of water, as other reviewers mentioned it being runny. 3) I added 1 1/2 TBS of Tomato Paste. I did this because I noticed most bottled BBQ sauces contain this ingredient. I then followed the original directions and cooked it on the stove for 15 minutes, and the sauce came out AMAZING. I think that's one of the keys...a lot of reviewers are skipping the cooking of the sauce and putting it right on the chicken, which I think is a mistake. As for the chicken itself, I personally like a crispy skin on my BBQ Chicken, so this did not turn out well. I do however think this sauce would be AMAZING on an actual barbecue. I also think that if you used this cook

I think everyone agrees the sauce is too thin.  I read the reviews before making the dish, so I changed the recipe to try and help.  Therefore, the original recipe is not a good one, but even the modified recipe was only so-so.  Of course the meat falls off the bone.  If you bake most meat with enough liquid for an hour and a half, it's bound to be tender.  Sometimes I wonder who writes all of the reviews because I have found only a handful of recipes online that I would truly rave about.  Many are disappointing.

I was impressed by this recipe - delicious! Taste was on point, but only thing I did different was double the sauce (for 8 chicken thighs) and omit the water. I did, however, add about 1/8 cup water mixed with cornstarch to the sauce to thicken it. I poured about half the sauce over the chicken to begin with, and during the last 15 minutes of baking, (when the cover is off), I basted the chicken with the rest of the sauce. This gave it the PERFECT touch and was a crucial step to having great BBQ chicken. I will definitely make this again!

Have made this many times as is.  Yesterday I played with it.  Cut water by half, upped ketchup to 4 T and added 1 t each of onion and garlic powder. Instead of cooking sauce  I put chicken and sauce into a ziplock  and let it marinate about 5 hours.  Dumped it into baking dish and baked.  I baked uncovered and by the time the chicken was done the sauce was just the right thickness. Flipped the chicken quite a few times during cooking . Will try adding a bit of liquid smoke next time. Great as is but fun to play with too. Update: I doubled sauce and as I was cooking (this time) it I decided to simmer the chicken (4 thighs) in the sauce stovetop instead of using the oven. Worked great. I strained the sauce after removing chicken and reduced till nice and thick. I love playing with this, today I added 1 t. liquid smoke and 1 t. molasses. Try using the BBQ sauce as a gravy on whipped potatoes. On my short list of last meals.

I make it with boneless/skinless thighs and just reduce the cooking time. I also add a tiny bit more brown sugar since we like it sweet.

This recipe was one of the easiest I've ever made! I made a few adjustments with the sauce, I doubled everything and added 2 tablespoons each of smoked sweet paprika, white pepper and black pepper and added 1 tablespoon of dried thyme. I also substitued apple cider vinegar.  The sauce was pretty runny and greasy from the chicken when it was done so I simmered it in a small sauce pan for about 30 mins and added cornstarch.  Next time I think I will omit the water all together. I also added some julienned onion to the bottom of the baking dish and it turned out so good the onions themselves could have been a meal.  Unreal!  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  It will become a staple in my kitchen.

SOOOOOOOO GOOD! Seriously the best bbq sauce I've ever tasted. And so unbelievably simple and quick! I used 2 tablespoons of water instead of 4,  and I'm happy I did because it came out perfect! Next time I'll double the recipe because it was just so delicious. I poured on chicken breasts and baked in the oven. Can't wait to make again, thank you so much!!!!!

Excellent.  Loved it.  Very easy.  I discovered I didn't have any ketchup so I used Heitz 57 sauce.  Was verygood.  Next time I will use half ketchup half 57 sauce.

Doubled the sauce ingredients and mixed it directly in the Pyrex dish that the chicken baked in (skipping the stovetop step). Came out very tasty!

This recipe is delicious! I didn't use the dry mustard as I didn't have any. Also, I used chicken leg quarters but changed nothing else about the recipe. The meat is so tender and delicious. I don't have a grill, so this is my fallback when I get the taste for barbecue. Simply wonderful! Two things that really make the recipe are the baking temp/length and skinning the meat. It takes a while, but it's really worth the effort.

was very good. will make again. made as follows, but omitted the water, and added a bit more brown sugar than was called for as I felt that it was VERY vinegar-y beforehand! suit your taste! also made in the slow-cooker= 2 hours on high, and 3 hours on low...fell off the bone tender. : )

This sauce turned out absolutely delicious!  I used it on 5 boneless skinless breasts and it was just the right amount.  I would make double the amount of sauce for any more than that.  I'm not sure how that sauce is enough for 12 servings!  The baking directions are perfect, i did exactly as it said and it was thoroughly cooked but not overdone.  Had with green beans and creamy rice, yum!

I loved this sauce but here's what I did. I simmered the sauce with a teaspoon of cornstarch as some of the previous comments said. I used all of the sauce to cover the chicken before tightly covering and baking for 45 minutes at 350. I made a second batch of the sauce and after 45 minutes brushed it onto the cooked chicken baked for 5 more minutes and then broiled for 5 to get a nice crispy skin.

Here's another twist if you're cooking for a large group function.  I bought skinless, boneless chicken breasts and cut into nugget size pieces which I dredged and fried in a little oil until golden brown.  Repeat until you have sufficient quantity, and adjust the sauce recipe to accommodate.  I placed fresh onion rings in the bottom of the casserole dish which I had sprayed w/a nonstick coating, placed the fried chicken nuggets on top, poured the sauce over, covered, and refrigerated overnight.  The next morning, I turned the nuggets so that they were all well coated.  I then cooked in the oven.  To say that these were a hit is an understatement.  I like the thinner bbq sauce, and I particularly like a tart (vinegar-y) sauce as opposed to a sweeter sauce.  This bbq sauce recipe is definitely a keeper for me.

This was really good. I didn't have any worcestershire sauce so I made a mixture of A1 sauce, chilli sauce, and soy sauce and substituted, and it came out great! However, I don't think it need to be in the oven as long as its listed to, maybe 20 minutes less at least.

I gave this 4 stars because we ate up every bit of it...but sauce was a bit too tangy for my taste.  Next time: less vinegar and/or lemon, and more sugar probably.  Thanks, Rena

I made this for dinner tonight, and it was really good. I mixed the ingredients up (only made half the recipe) and just put it on the chicken without simmering it and put it in oven covered. Turned out perfect. Thanks so much for sharing, RENA R.

Excellent recipe for baked bbq chicken. I made a few small changes, like some of the other reviewers I halved the water. I also added 2tsp of honey and 3 minced cloves of garlic.

The BBQ sauce itself was really good but I found that the chicken did not really absorb the flavour.  Maybe next time I would marinate it in the sauce for a while before cooking.

Wonderful sauce.  Omitted all the water, using split chicken breasts that I have brined overnight.  Cooking slowly in the overn for 1.5 hours and then charring on the grill.

BF loved this. I had to make extra sauce for him to dip in. I left out the water and vinegar and added a bit of tabasco. Marinated in fridge for a few hours and then threw on the grill. Really good!

So good! So easy! What's not to love? I used varying proportions of ingredients to match our personal tastes, and I added onion powder and Heinz spicy ketchup in place of regular, which gave it just a little bit of a kick. I also added in a little bit of honey. I made this recipe with half tenderloins and half skin-on thighs and baked at 450 for 20 minutes, then reduced to 300 for about 35 minutes, uncovering the dish for the last 20 minutes or so. The step about simmering the sauce is completely unnecessary as the sauce simmers with the chicken as it cooks. The sauce is quite thin as other reviewers stated when it comes out of the oven, but 1) it will thicken as it reaches room temperature, and 2) the stuff is so good you could drink it, so I'm not complaining! Will make again. Thanks for sharing!

I used the full amount of sauce for 3 chicken breast pieces. The only thing I changed was only using 1/2 tsp of salt, added 1 drop of liquid smoke, and a dash of cayenne pepper. After it was done baking (40 minutes was plenty) I removed it from the oven, added cornstarch to the sauce and thickened it nice and thick and brushed it on the breasts before serving. An easy, tasty meal!

Delicious.  I used the suggestion to put everything in the crockpot.  It came out tender.  I prefer spicy so I added some Chipotle Tabasco to the mix.

First time making this recipe.  This recipe turned out very good yielding three very good chicken drumsticks with a nice BBQ flavor.  I did add some extra kick to the BBQ sauce via 2 teaspoons of an extremely hot mixture of habanera, Thai hot red, cayenne, serrano and jalapeño peppers plus an extra teaspoon of Louisiana Hot sauce and a teaspoon of granulated garlic.  Other than the extra kick, I followed the recipe.  The next time I make this recipe I will probably double the sauce recipe and save some for the drumsticks after cooking as I did not have any extra after cooking with the recipe as given.  The drumsticks were done nicely, maybe a tad over cooked, and the remaining sauce had thickened to a consistency slightly thicker than a standard BBQ sauce.

Pretty good. I de-boned a chicken and used it. The breasts got a bit over-cooked and I need to thicken the sauce (which is GREAT by the way.) I will be doing this again. Maybe actually grill it next time.

W-O-W this sauce is so tasty. Mine came out hot and sweet (I used quite a bit of cayenne pepper). I followed another reviewer's advice and used no water at all, and doubled the rest of the sauce ingredients. After making the sauce, I garlic and onion powdered the chicken thighs, and put everything into a slow cooker for 3h on Medium High. Tender, tasty, AMAZING.

This was awesome!!! I followed the recipe except I poured the sauce over the chicken and then cooked more sauce to add to the chicken half way through cooking it, I also flipped the chicken half way through. It didn't really need the second sauce, but oh well!! I used drumsticks and thighs  ( I took the skin off only the thighs ).  Will make this again, but only in the winter time, my whole house was super hot from the oven being on 500!!!!

This was just OK.  I think the Carmelized Baked Chicken is much better.  Didn't love the overall flavour but the chicken did come out very tender.  I used skinless, boneless chicken thighs.

This was a great recipe - I modified a bit. I tripled the sauce (my preference), used boneless chicken breasts, dredged in flour lightly before adding the sauce, and baked for about 1 hr. After baking, I pulled the chicken apart and served it on premium buns with pickle and onion. It was amazing. My fiance said it was the best thing I've made yet!

So moist & delicious! The only substitution I made was to use boneless skinless breasts instead of thighs. So I also had to adjust the cooking time: 15 min. at 500 degrees then 30 min. at 300 degrees (taking the lid off for the last 10 min.). The sauce had just the right amount of spice & sweetness. Thanks for a great dinner idea!

I'm rating 4 stars because of the issue with the sauce becoming too runny after cooking.  Here's how I dealt with it.  I omitted the water from the sauce but put it in a measuring cup and mixed it with about 2 Tbsp. corn starch.  After cooking I pushed the chicken aside and stirred the cornstarch mixture into the sauce in the pan and, spread the chicken back out and placed the pan back in the oven for about 10 minutes.  This thickend it up.  I think another way to deal with this is to double the sauce and only pour half over and save the other half to pour over the chicken for the last 10 minutes it's in the oven.  The flavor was great and the chicken was tender and really good.

I didn't use the recipe for the BBQ sauce - I am a working mom of two very small kids - so I cheated and used a store-bought sauce. However, I followed the cooking directions to the letter. My husband, who insists on fried and grilled foods most of the time, gobbled it up! And it was practically a fork-fight for the last piece! The chicken was SUPER moist and tender! Delish and we will definitely use again and again!! THANKS!!!!

Good.  As others have noted it is more of a barbeque broth than a typcial BBQ sauce.  The flavor is good and the chicken is nice and moist.  (I, too, used chicken breasts.)  The broth goes nicely with mashed potatoes if you make a double recipe of it.

Wow! This was yum. My hubby and I only cooked 6 thighs and doubled the sauce recipe. It was the perfect amount for leftovers the next day (just him and I). We followed others advice and omitted the water. To help cut back on calories, we used Splenda brown sugar mix (just don't forget only to use half of what the recipe calls for). We went ahead and shredded the chicken after cooking it and put it on buns. The sauce was the perfect consistency (I'm thinking that cooking it over the stove helped.)This actually tasted better as leftovers! Will def make again!

I cut back the H2o to 1TBSP. Used Chicken Thighs and it was floating by time it came to bake it without the foil. Not even close to a sauce more like a very thin marinade. The flavor of the chicken was okay, Just not what I was expecting, My search for really good baked bbq chicken continues...

Yummy!  I didn't change much, just added another tablespoon of brown sugar and ketchup and held back on the chili powder.  I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs and removed as much fat as possible.  It was very tender and tasty.  The sauce is runny, but that keeps the chicken from getting dry.

I made it as is and the sauce was too thin.  Next time I will leave out the water.  I think it could use some garlic for flavor and cornstarch to make it thicker.  By doing that I think it will turn out perfect.

Tasty but much too runny. Take it out of the oven when there are 10 minutes left stir in 1 tablespoon of cornflour that has been mixed with a little water, this thickens the sauce and makes it nice and sticky as it should be. Jan

The chicken was very mosit. I missed the crispy skin that I am use to having with baked chicken. I would cook it without the cover for longer if you are looking for crispy skin.

Quick and easy. Doubled the sauce, left out the water and salt. Put it in the slow cooker. It tasted great. This is a keeper. I have used the BBQ sauce more with smoked sausage, cooking them on top of the stove.
It is VERY good.

The sauce is insanely good. So much so that we've made it three times in the past week. Twice with chicken and I have pork chops cooking in it as we speak. Only changes? I added a little more brown sugar because I felt it was a bit too tangy at first.  I also used apple cider vinegar, just because. First two times, I didn't thicken it, but tonight I did.  The flavors just all come at you. Mouth watering!

And the recipe for baking the chicken couldn't be more perfect. I had best results with bone-in breasts and thighs.  My husband can't get enough.  When he asks for me to make a recipe again during the first time he's eating it, that pretty much makes me grant 5 stars.

Real good chicken...  If you want a thicker sauce, just cut the water and double everything else.  We also drizzled a little honey over the chicken and seasoned with some herbs and pepper before putting on the sauce.

This was very good, but I am not sure it warrants the extreme praise it has received. I also omitted the water. I cooked 4 thighs in sauce. I didn't bother trying to thicken the sauce, just plated the thighs. They had a lot of flavor.

I am going to do a review on the baking method:  The chicken was so tender. The recipe says to stir the meat before the last 15 minutes of cooking time! I tried to stir it and the bone fell off. Chicken was so tender! The Bomb!! Thanks for great tips will definitely try your recipe for BBQ sauce. For now I just used what I bought at Costco.

Very easy to make. We only made 1/2 the recipe, and it worked very well. I thought at first we would not have enough sauce, but it was just the right amount.

Super easy super delicious recipe!!!! I doubled the sauce, didn't bother cooking it just threw it in the crockpot with the chicken on low for about 6 hours. After that was done I took the chicken out thickened up the sauce on the stovetop put a little over the tops of the chicken and broiled to crisp the skin up. I then put the sauce on the side cause it is delicious!!!

I followed the recipe as written and ended up with a small amount of sauce on the chicken which was sitting in a 1/2 inch of liquid.  The chicken was fully cooked after 20 minutes at 350 degrees.  To rescue the chicken I reduced the liquid in a sauce pan and added corn starch to thicken.  Poured the sauce over the chicken and broiled it for 5 minutes.  The chicken was overcooked...

delicious! I marinatedthe chicken in the sauce for 3 hours. I reserved some to baste half way through the uncovered process. Perhaps the sauce was a little runny?

Made this tonight exactly as presented with the exception of dry musturd.  I was out so I substituted approx. 2 tsp. dijon.   We LOVED it!  Moist chicken with a flavorful glaze and sooooo easy.  Great make ahead recipe for entertaining.  Hint: used Perdue thighs from costco, 4 thighs to a blister pkg, VERY economical dish for a gang.

GREAT! I made this according to the recipe with no changes.  I had planned on grilling chicken thighs tonight when a thunder storm hit.  I quickly did an ingredient search and this recipe saved the day.  It was so easy to make and did not tie me down to the kitchen.  I threw in a bulb of garlic and made roasted garlic mashed potatoes as a side dish.  The smell of the barbeque chicken along with the garlic had our mouths watering.  Nothing beats chicken thighs on the grill but this recipe sure saved the day and was GREAT!  Thanks you RENA R. for sharing such a GREAT recipe!!

THIS WAS THE BEST BARBEQUE CHICKEN I'VE EVER HAD! and I actually messed up a tad bit! Instead of seasoning the chicken with the dry mustand and salt i added it to the sause mix. I added more brown sugar to off set the salt and it was still delicious!! absolutely wonderful! This will be a super keeper! I can't wait to get my left overs at lunch. I did double the sause as suggested by other reviews and that worked out perfectly.

This was wonderful! I followed some other reviewer's advice to doubled the recipe (not the water) and used 6 boneless skinless chicken thighs. I also added a tablespoon of honey and a pinch of cayenne pepper. 
I turned the temp down to 375 instead of 300 and only let them cook covered for about 20 mins at that temp. 
They were perfect. My fiance LOVED them and was baffled as to how I made my own BBQ sauce. This one is going in my recipe binder!

This was just so-so for us. It seemed to be missing something. It really didn't taste barbequed compared to what I'm used to from the grill. Not a keeper for us.

I thought this was good but a bit to liquidy may leave out water next time or add cornstarch. Used two tbl lemon juice instead of vingear and prepared mustard since no dry in the cupboard.

This was the first recipe I ever tried with chicken thighs, having been up to this point in life, a die hard chicken breast fan. Everyone, kids, husband, me LOVED this, licking our plates to prove it. Any recipe that makes everyone happy is a keeper and worthy of 5 + stars!

This recipe is very tasty! I added a tbsp of honey and a clove of minced garlic. I marinated the thighs in this sauce for 24 hours, then grilled them on the bbq. This one's definitely a keeper!

Delicious!! My entire family + my two picky eaters devoured it!! I baked this chicken along with baked potatoes and it was a perfect meal! The only adjustment I made was using lime juice and white sugar as that is what I had and it was still incredible.  This recipe is very similar to my favorite BBQ Chicken in the Williams Sonoma Cookbook! Thank you!

Such a great smell in the oven and so tender and flavorful in your mouth. So easy to put together, too. I only made 2 chicken breasts but with the same measurements of ingredients and it was plenty of sauce. I didn't have any lemon juice so I didn't put it in there and I only had prepared yellow mustard and I put maybe 2 tsp of that instead of the dry mustard. Definitely a keeper!

This is the best recipe for barbeque chicken I have ever tasted. The home made sauce is what makes it so great and taste best on boneless, skinless, chicken thighs. If I recall, the recipe calls for water. I recommend omitting the water to make the sauce thicker.

This was a very easy, simple dish to make, using half drumsticks and half thighs.  As others suggested, I doubled the sauce. One small change I made was using only half the sugar, this suited our taste perfectly. Also, substituted dry mustard with same amount of Dijon.  We had leftovers; made some sandwiches with reheated chicken and sauce. Yummy!

This is very good, before serving I did thicken the sauce with a corn starch slurry and added some extra vinegar, ketchup, brown sugar, and a little garlic powder. Thx for the easy tasty submission ;) Oh FYI I made this in a Nesco Oven so I would not heat the house up, lol!

This was okay - it definitely does not make a barbeque "sauce" - it was a liquid, didn't stick to the chicken at all.  The flavor was good, but I would prefer bottled sauce over this - won't make again.

I love how easy this is to make and the homemade sauce is great.  Even has a little kick to it.  I did add about 1 tsp of cornstarch to the sauce right before serving and turned out great!

I'd never made my own barbeque sauce before.  This one was wonderful. Very simple.  I made just a few modifications based on other suggestions.  I was making chicken for a school potluck, so I quadrupled the recipe.  I used white wine instead of water.  I used half the amount of salt and substituted with cayenne pepper and garlic powder (1/4 tsp each).  I cooked as directed, then after transferring my chicken to a crockpot, thickened the sauce with corn starch.  It made our lounge smell *heavenly* as it kept warm for lunch.  I got lots of compliments about the sauce and the chicken.  Thanks muchly for the recipe!

Thank you for this great recipe. I made it for dinner today and it was delicious. I made 5 chicken thighs and the sauce was not enough. I had to double the sauce. Every 10 minutes I would put more sauce on the chicken. My husband loved it! Thanks soo much!

I'm giving this four stars because I did have to modify the recipe a bit.  I didn't add the water, on the advice of others, and it was still a little runny.  I used some corn starch in my casserole dish about halfway through the cooking time (when I realized it was still runny) and it came out very well!  Raves from my fiance and his two friends, so this will definitely make an appearance again.  I also added some white pepper and paprika to the sauce, as well as doubling the recipe.  I also put 1/2 chopped onion on the chicken (uncooked.)  And one last thing I did was coat the chicken in mustard before I put the bbq sauce on. I really liked this recipe and I will use the sauce on different meats in the future.  Thanks!

My new fave chicken recipe!  Used only 2 TB of water, but even that was a little too much.  May use just one or none next time.  I gave the recipe to my mom...she loved it and she didn't use any water at all. I covered the thighs and baked at 500 for only half an hour, and then took the lid off and baked at 300 for 45 to an hour.  Simply divine!!

This recipe was pretty good. I used breasts instead of drumsticks. I omitted the salt and water and added cayenne as others suggested. You will want to triple the sauce if you want extra, and cornstarch is required!

Great recipe.  Like most others, I tweaked it a bit to suit our tastes.  I added a little onion powder and garlic, other than that I kept everything the same.  I kept the amount of water just as the recipe stated, whereas some people changed it, because I used chicken breasts and I think they are a little dryer.   My husband considers himself a bbq expert, and he loved it.

This recipe was awesome! Here are the changes I made: 1) omit the water 2) use chili sauce in place of ketchup (gives it more of a savory flavor) 3)double the sauce and only use 6 thighs (~3 servings) 4) use cider vinegar 5)omit salt 6) add 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper 7) added fresh ground pepper. I also shredded the chicken before the last 15 minutes of baking and served it on buns. Husband and I loved it!

This is a very flavorful sauce.  So much better than bottled varieties.  I made these on the stovetop with boneless chicken breasts.  Mix sauce ingredients in a large measuring cup.  In a large skillet, brown chicken on both sides.  Add add sauce, bring to a boil and lower to a simmer until sauce is thick and chicken is done.  Great with fried green tomatoes, roasted corn, and grilled pineapple for July 4th!

I left out the water as other reviews indicated the sauce was too thin. I also used only 6 thighs, I think that it would be too little sauce if I used all 12. Sauce still thin but tasty! We will make again.

OMG YUM YUM!!  My hubby kept telling me how good this was!  This sauce is better than store bought IMO.  I added honey to the mix to thicken and it coated the chicken nicely!  It was perfect!  I also added sliced onion and fresh sliced mushrooms to the chicken and baked according to directions...I think this would be even better in the crock-pot!

I found the sauce to be quite flavourfull, but a little on the runny side.  My husband and kids loved it.  It was very easy to make and cleanup was minimal.  I served it with mashed potatoes and broccoli.  The sauce was good on the potatoes.  I did take the advise of others and only used half of the viniger and lemon juice.  The chili powder is what gives this recipe its good flavour.

Very yummy chicken! It literally fell off the bone! The whole family loved it, even the picky eater. If you don't like tangy chicken, I would add more brown sugar and less vinegar/lemon. We will definitely make this again. thanx

This tasted really good, but i did find it was a bit greasy.  The barbeque sauce really flavored the chicken well.

This was great!  Simple enough for me to make too. As a budding cook, my chicken for the first time in life came out very tender and I love the sauce. I did not have Worchester sauce so I used just 1tbsp of Braggs Liquid Aminos. I did not have chilli powder so I used a pinch of Paprika and I did not have dry mustard so I used regular mustard. I also used this recipe on drumsticks rather than thighs. I love the balance of acidity and sweet in this sauce. I am going to make some more today.

This was a last minute decision to make as I didn't have ingredients for my go to recipe for chicken thighs. It was a huge success! The kids along with my husband really enjoyed it which doesn't happen too often in our house. All the ingredients are something that most everyone would have on hand. The chicken was very moist and we didn't even drizzle the sauce over the chicken after serving it on plates. This one is now saved in my recipe box.

Tender, tasty, but seasonings need tweaking. Definitely double sauce, except for water, and thicken with water/cornstarch. I used organic boneless, skinless chicken thighs which were stringy. Love the sauce.

I used the cooking instructions but used chix breasts with skin removed, and then poured on my favorite BBQ sauce. I forgot to uncover at the end, but my husband and kids were fighting over it! Prep time was 5 minutes, and so juicy and delicious!!

I modified it to be lower in sodium (only 1 Tb W. sauce,nosalt, a salt substitute, no salt tomato sauce, and increased the brown sugar to 1/4 c.) and used the sauce as a marinade.
I broiled the chicken and basted it with the sauce.  Yummy!

This was very yummy, especially considering how easy it was.  I kept the skins on, took the chicken out a bit early and crisped up the skin under the broiler for a few minutes, while reducing the sauce on the stovetop.  I too doubled the sauce and it was a good thing; it was so delicious we ate it all.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Really good. I love the sauce. Next time I will double it. I read reviews and many said the sauce was runny. So I only put in 2Tblsp of water and after it simmered it was thick -just wish I had more. I even overcooked it on accident because I was outside and the chicken was still tender!

Great recipe.  Used boneless, skinless chicken breasts. Added 1/2 teaspoons of onion, garlic and red pepper flakes.  Reduced water by 1 tbsp. and increased ketchup and brown sugar by 1 tbsp.  Heated in the microwave instead of heating on the stove.  Baked the chicken covered for about 70 minutes at 375 degrees.  Delicious.

This is fantastic! I expected the sauce to be watery from the reviews, and when you bake the chicken with the foil, the sauce just multiplies so there is plenty for pouring over mashed potatoes. What I did was to increase the sauce for 18 servings and kept the water the same. After simmering the sauce, I set aside about a third of it because it tasted so good, I knew I would want to use it as a glaze. In the last step, I brushed the thicker sauce on the thighs and finished baking (uncovered as directed). Perfect! My husband who loves to douse his meats with ketchup, barbecue sauce, gravies etc., love this chicken just as it is!

This was a really good sauce recipe and I liked the cooking method.  I was worried about the high starting temp and the long slow cooking but it made the chicken very moist and tender.  The only change I made was I didn't put the water in.  After reading the review that the sauce was too thin, why add water?  Duh!  My sauce came out perfect and loved the flavor.

Like most other reviewers, I agree that the sauce though very tasty, is also very runny. Other than the consistency of the sauce, I am very pleased with everything else of the recipe.

My husband LOVES this chicken and always requests it - I have made it with breasts and drumsticks too and still fabulous. I added in a dash of liquid smoke and olive oil. I also left out the mustard powder because I didn't have any. Its a keeper!

This is a great recipe.  My son-in-law is picky about his bbq sauce and he loved this  The first time I marinated it overnight and just cooked it on the bbq.  Today I am baking it in the oven.  I am sure it will be delish!!!  After reading all the comments, I just eliminated the water from the start.  I substituted the honey for the sugar... It is a great and very easy recipe...  Will be a keeper in our home!!!

Really good taste, but I cooked it in the slow cooker for 6 hours and it was a little dry.  I plan on trying this again but cooking in the oven.

Great! Chicken flaked like fish. I used a meat mallet, favorite store bought sauce, and a little McCormick Grill Mates Barbecue Seasoning. It was a snap! Easy and delicious. That's the game plan. Thanks for leading me in the right direction.

What a flavorful dish! I made these for a very picky man (My Father) and he absolutely loved this recipe. He said this is going to be a weekly meal. I did follow the recipe exacty however, I noticed when I uncovered the chicken that the barbeque mix was kinda runny. So before I put the chicken back in the oven I mixed another batch (omitting the water) and spooned it on to the chicken. It gave a great coating and the chicken was so tender. Two Thumbs Up!

I made this recipe a few nights ago and it was YUMMY!!!!!! My husband was very into it as well. The only thing I did different was no worcestershire sauce....just didn't have any and wasn't going to the store, haha. It was perfectly fine without it. We will definitely be making this again!

This was soo good.  I didn't have vinegar (mine expired and I did not know) so I used lemon juice it turned out great. I will be making this recipe again-with vinegar next time :)

The flavor of this barbeque sauce was wonderful, and so easy, not sticky and overly sweet.  I will use this again for sure

Used for sauce on grilled bone-in, skin-on chicken breasts. Doubled ketchup, brown sugar, Worcestershire, mustard and chili powder. Also added 1/2tsp liquid smoke, 1Tbps maple syrup, and 1tsp each onion & garlic powders. Tasty, but not too spicy for our 2nd old and not too sweet for us.

So easy and so good!  I am not a fan of jarred BBQ flavor at all but was willing to try the sauce since I was making it myself..  I am so glad I did because this dish has so much flavor and the chicken always comes out moist the meat just falls off the bone.  The dish does take a while to cook, but is worth the wait!!  YUM!!!!

I am surprised so many people loved this! I thought it was just okay.  The sauce was pretty runny and not at all thick like a normal bbq sauce or how the picture represents. I will be sticking to my old bbq recipe!

I didn't think this recipe was as good as most of the other reviewers.  Nothing special and more work that it was worth.  If you want to try it, I recommend not cooking the sauce first.  It won't make a difference and do thicken the juices in the pan because the juices from the chicken thins out the sauce a lot.

0 STARS!! I'm not sure what I did wrong- I followed others' advice:  doubled the recipe for the sauce,  omitted the water,  added garlic powder and dash of cinnamon Also, I didn't have any Worcestershire sauce, but I added 1 Tbsp soy sauce instead. The recipe didn't specify what type of vinegar to use; I used apple cider vinegar.  I cooked the sauce according to the directions, and it filled my house with the worst smell ever! I am still gagging at the thought. My husband says it smells like burnt ketchup. I think it is worse. I ended up throwing out the sauce before ruining my chicken with it- and baking my chicken in some Polenese duck sauce I found in my fridge.

This tastes amazing!!!  I used Splenda brown sugar blend and I basted the chicken with the juice twice before serving.  It IS very, very runny.  I expected a sticky sauce because it's called BBQ.  It didn't matter in the end because it is so tasty!  I can't wait to make it again.

This was delicious! The meat was tender, and it was super easy to make. As others have said, it was a little watery. I doubled the recipe, but still only put in 4 T of water, and it was still a little runny. I just thickened it a little, and it was fine.

Meet our new favorite family meal! So simple and incredibly delicious and satisfying. My husband made this with garlic mashed potatoes...our picky teens gobbled it up! If you think you're not a fan of chicken thighs, think again...this recipe is FANTASTIC!!!

This dish was pretty good and I would have given it 5 stars, but since I altered it quite a bit based on other reviews, 4 stars will have to do. I subbed the water with actual bbq sauce, and added, garlic powder, onion powder and very little salt. Also, I soaked the thighs in water & garlic to add a little more flavor to the chicken. The final result was pretty tasty.

Very good recipe.  Used just legs since that is all I had on hand but still turned out great.  Used others advice and put in oven at 375 covered for 45 mins and then finished on the grill.  Also thickened the sauce on the stovetop as previously suggested.  Will be making again.

I am giving this a 3 stars because it was simply good. NOT great. The chicken does end up very, very tender, but lacks a bit of flavor. I have made my own barbecue sauces before, and I thought this would be too runny, so I omitted the water, and it was still runny, almost like broth.   This sauce definitely needs to have some barbecue sauce substituted for the water, definitely some paprika and garlic too. I will make it again but will make significant changes. Good, not close to be great.

I give this recipe 5 stars because the bbq sauce is SO delicious!! I have never made my own bbq sauce before, and I never realized how easy it is! I will definitely be using this recipe for all of my grilling needs from now on! I doubled the sauce recipe, but only used 4 (unpacked) tablespoons of sugar and 4 tbsp's of water. This left the sauce tart and not too runny. I only used 6 boneless thighs. I think the recipe would be great with boneless chicken breasts as well! Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

this was really really good.  i had legs and thighs so i used both.  really easy too!  next time tho i think i'm gonna double up the sauce and use 1/2 to marinade for a few hours and then bake.  hubby wants to try on the grill...but really super good and super easy!  i didn't have dry mustard so i used regular yellow mustard.

I made this for my husband and I for a special dinner. It tasted great! The only thing I would suggest is to double the ingredients used to make the sauce, because the original recipe doesn't seem to make enough of it.

This was pretty good.  I did not make any changes to the original recipe.  I like that I know all the ingredients in my bbq sauce as opposed to using a bottled sauce.

We just thought this was ok. I eliminated the water and sauce was still very runny.

I was very impressed with this recipe. It was super easy and absolutely delicious. The only thing I did different was use chicken breasts instead of thighs. The sauce is great as is!

This is such a yummy, easy-to-make chicken recipe! It uses all ingredients that most people have in their pantries and fridges, so that is an added bonus! I used a mixture of bone-in chicken thighs, breasts, and drumsticks, because I have a large family and everyone likes different pieces :) Other than that, I made this exactly as written, and I'm going to make it again! The chicken was tender, juicy, and flavorful, and everyone in my family liked it. Thanks so much for sharing the recipe...I'll be making it again!!!!!

I followed the recipe but I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs.  The prep was easy.  I got it ready and put it in the fridge before going to church, popped it in the oven when we got home.  The sauce is delicious but it did not get thick(maybe it isn't supposed to).  I think I will make this again and maybe baste my chicken a couple of times with the sauce after taking the foil off so the sauce sticks to the chicken a little better.  This is moist and flavorful.  My whole family enjoyed it.

I made this just as is and it turned out wonderfully!  I did decrease the cooking time a bit since all I had on hand were boneless chicken breasts.  The sauce did turn out a little thin...but I poured all the pan drippings into a glass, mixed in 1 T. of cornstarch and popped it into the microwave for 2 min. It thickened up perfectly!  I poured this extra sauce on top of the chicken and it was great.  Thank you so much for this recipe...this is one of my faves.

We liked this recipe with modifications. Left the water out completely, doubled the sauce recipe but instead of 6 TBS of ketchup used 3 TBS ketchup and 3 TBS Heinz Chili Sauce. Cooked on the stovetop and then covered B/S chicken thighs at 350* for 30 minutes, then uncovered and broiled for 5 minutes to sticky them a bit. Good tangy flavor, served with Chipotle Mashed Sweet Potatoes and roasted asparagus!

Made with 6 thighs instead of 12, but used same amounts for sauce and cooked just as written.  Served with mashed potatoes and corn on the cob, family LOVED it!

This was pretty good. I used chicken breasts and put them on hamburger buns. Next time I am going to double the sauce. I also reduced the cooking time because I was using breasts but I still cooked them a little to long..they were a little tough. Overall good! We loved them as a chicken sandwich.

Made it exactly as written a few times and it was great, but last time decided to try it a little different. I marinaded the chicken in the sauce overnight, and threw it on the barbecue. Seared it for 5 minutes on each side on high heat, then moved it to indirect heat until was almost done. In the mean time, I boiled the marinaded and reduced it a little, then basted the chicken during the last five minutes of cooking, on both sides. Came out phenomenal!

Delicious!.. I was in such a hurry to make dinner that I didn't realize I was supposed to take the skin off; Since I doubled the sauce and it was on the thin side I just left the foil off for about 20 minutes then I turned the oven down to 350 keeping the foil off because I wanted the skin to crisp.  I spooned the sauce over every 15 minutes and then when the chicken was done (about 40 more minutes) I took it out of the sauce, poured it into a smaller sauce pan and skimmed off the fat from the top.  I then thickened with flour/water mixture and poured it back over the chicken... Really tasty recipe! :)

I thought this tasted great!!! Due to my pregnancy I am disgusted by chicken but i doused a small piece in bbq sauce and it was yummy!!!! I thought the sauce was very runny but I poured it into a small saucepan and added 1tblsp of cornstarch and it thickened up wonderfully. After the chicken got that pretty red color I thickened the sauce and basted the chicken and also left some out for dipping for those who wanted more. I actually marinated a whole chicken in this for an hour and baked at 350 for 2 hours and had no leftovers!!! Got rave reviews all around. I think that everyone should double the sauce. It is worth it! Thank you!!!!

This recipe is one of our new favorites. I cut the quantity back to 3, since my husband and I were the only ones eating, but had to double the sauce recipe for 3...this was so good, I think I will make enough of the sauce to jar up in the fridge. Thanks for sharing!

My whole family loved this chicken.  My ten year old daughter, who hates barbeque sauce, went crazy over it--I just didn't tell her what it was!  We all agreed that this is a recipe to keep.  It's simple to throw together, and the chicken was very tender and flavorful.  I did add two cloves of minced garlic and some honey to the sauce, but otherwise follwed the recipe and directions exactly.  Thanks for a great dinner!

We really loved this recipe!  The only changes I made was that I doubled the sauce recipe as others suggested, and I used chicken breasts just because my family prefers white meat.  But a very moist tasty chicken dish!

We really enjoyed this chicken.  It was easy to prepare and tasted great.  Also, it was super cheap since I had the chicken in the freezer and all the ingredients on hand. After the chicken was done, I boiled the sauce with some corn starch slurry to thicken it up a bit, and also added a few dashes of liquid smoke to give it a little more flavor.  That made it perfect for us.  Thanks for a great, easy meal.  We'll definitely be having this again.

Absolutely what I was looking for. I rarely have BBQ sauce so this was such a delicious treat. I had no vinegar, so used red wine vinegar in its place. I also would recommend doubling the recipe but that's cause I love sauce. I didn't find it too watery....again I love sauce. It's certainly not a paste, but is nice to have the drippings to spoon over the chicken & veggies. Thank you!

Cut back on the brown sugar and added more lemon juice and vinegar to make it less sweet and more tangy. It was perfect!

My rating is for the cooking method only, as I made my own version of BBQ sauce.  The cooking time is just perfect and the breast came out so moist and delicious.  And the BBQ sauce infuses the chicken with so much flavor while it's in the oven.  I loved this and will definitely make it again.

This recipe turned out awesome!  : )  The chicken was so tender it was just falling apart.  Me and my husband loved it.  However, I do have to say that the sauce gets a little runny being in the oven so long.  So I always set some aside to brush on just before I serve for a quick fix!  ; )

This was really good!  I did uncover the chicken alittle sooner than called for.  The sauce being thin didn't bother me at all because it had so much flavor without needing extra sauce on it.  I did baste the chicken once I removed the cover. Wonderful tasting chicken and very easy.

This was really good.  I was only looking for a good sauce so I must admit I cheated and threw everything for the sauce in the crock pot, stirred and added the chicken.  Cooked all day on low.  It was wonderful!  I did double the sauce amount though.

I used boneless chicken breasts and added garlic powder to the chicken seasoning. This was quite possibly the best bbq chicken ever - it was very moist and absolutely delicious! Thanks Rena!

This turned out so tender! The chicken was still a little frozen when I put it in the pan so I just cooked it an extra 30 minutes. My hubby loved it!

I used 8 thighs and tripled the sauce (without using any water) because I had to split the thighs between two baking pans (and I reserved some in case anyone wanted). I uncovered the pans for the last 20 minutes so the sauce could thicken a little. It tasted good but is better if you spoon some reserved sauce over them (the sauce in the pan had it's flavor watered down by the chicken juices).

This is SO easy, tender, and delicious! My family loved it! I browned 1 tsp minced garlic and 1/2 cup of onion before adding bbq ingredients. I omitted the vinegar because I didn't have any. I also used 1 tsp brown mustard instead of dry mustard and used Season All instead of Italian Seasoning. I served it with corn and mashed potatoes. I will definitely cook this again! I will double the sauce, omit the water, and add corn starch to thicken it if it's still thin.

I reduced water as others have suggested.  Outcome is also the same as others.  It came out with the sauce runny on the bottom.  I only used 4 thighs but still used 12 servings of this sauce.  Hubby likes the flavor so that's all it matters.  Chicken does come out tasty and smells great.  Cook time is just right as well.  Thank you for this recipe.

I was disappointed with this recipe.  I omitted the water as others had suggested.  By the time the chicken was finished baking, the sauce had become thin in the bottom of the pan but the thighs had a dark paste on them.  I even basted the pieces a few times.  I won't make this again.

Just delicious! I only had ckn breasts so they were a little dry in parts but I am looking forward to trying this with thighs as the recipe states.  The sauce has just the right sweet, spice and kick, and just clings to the meat perfectly.  I followed the recipe and simmered the full time with the full water and it was nice and thick to put on the chicken, then when I peeled the foil back to mix after 1 hr there was plenty of juice.  Don't mess with it.  It turns out great as is! Thanks for this delicious recipe.  Even my chicken hating husband (hates the flavor of chicken, says it can taste like chicken coop) he liked it too!

Really good.  I only used 1 TBS water and didn't boil the sauce first.  I used a chicken breast and a couple of tenders and baked at 400 for about 20 minutes and then turned down to 350 until it reached 180 degrees.  Served with baked beans and corn.  Everyone liked this- my 2 year old ate 3 chicken tenders!!  That's more meat than he's eaten in a month- lol!

Amazing sauce!!  We doubled the recipe and left out the water.  Tastes soooo good.  We also added some cayenne pepper to spice it up a bit.

Absolutely fantanstic!!! The more I make it, the more I like it. I made two minor changes: 
1 - I added the juice of 1 large lime to the chicken in the pan, before adding the sauce. This eliminates the "smell of chicken", which I happen to hate, and adds a bit of sourness; great!
2 - Once the chicken is done, throw out some of the liquid, and put it for about 5 minutes in the broiler, so that the chicken roasts a bit. If it feels too dry after this, I make more sauce and pour it on top before I eat it.

The chicken came out very tender and good, but the sauce was way too runny.  Since I prefer a thick sauce,  I ended up putting bottled sauce on the finished chicken.

This is a wonderful recipe!  My husband knows immediately by the wonderful aroma that he's having one of his favorite dishes when he smells this baking!  He has even raved about it to co-workers to the point that they've contacted me to request it!  Really good and the kids love it too.  

I don't change a thing in the recipe, great just as is.

The whole family enjoyed this flavorful recipe.
I put in a bit more ketchup,and cooked at medium-high till it boiled. This seemed to thicken the sauce a bit more, no runny sauce here.

I actually stayed almost on track while preparing this recipe. I'm known for doing my own thing most of the time. However, I only used 2 T brown sugar (not a big fan of sweet BBQ), used 4 T ketchup, went with 1 T red wine vinegar and 1 T white vinegar, since it wasn't specified, squeezed in 1 half lime instead of the lemon juice, yellow mustard over dried mustard (didn't have any), and added about a half cup of onion flakes to help absorb some of the excess liquid other people mentioned.

Ok ok, so I did get way off track, but we were still driving down the same highway. 

Having never made my own BBQ sauce before, I'd have to say I was somewhat pleased. However, I have eaten many a good BBQ in my lifetime, and this doesn't quite measure up no matter how perfectly you follow the recipe or how far off you get. 

There wasn't much zip to it. As mentioned, it wasn't thick enough to make itself known, and when you're using ketchup as your tomato base, you know you can do better. 

Now, if you want something fairly simple and easy to make, this is a good choice. If you want to impress, keep looking.

I loved the taste of the BBQ sauce when it was on the stovetop. But once I poured it over the chicken and covered the chicken, it got very watery. Does this happen to anyone else? Next time I will just bake or brown the chicken and pour thickened sauce over top.

I thought this chicken was yummy. It tasted a lot like what my mom used to make.:-)  The leftovers were very good as well. Use the bbq gravy on top of mashed potatoes.

Following the instructions as given the chicken was severely over cooked, dry and tasteless.  Totally inedible.  Going to try again with different cooking temps and time because it should be delicious if it isn't over cooked.

I have made this recipe many times and the only way it can turn out  is to bake the chicken first for all the water to be drawn out and then to add the barbecue sauce or it will be barbecue water sauce, not at all a satisfactory dish. You might try using a rack so the chicken drips all the water below.

I marinated the chicken overnight and basted the chicken, during the baking process more so than called for. Served with scalloped potatoes and green beans! By far the best! To top ot off, my husband isn't much of a BBQ fan and he REALLY loved it!

This recipe is amazing. This will be my go-to barbecue chicken. The only change I will make next time is to double the sauce, just because we like to put it over rice. Excellent.

Followed exactly but made in slow cooker on low for 5hrs. Really like the thin sauce versus usual thick bbq sauce. Served with roasted fresh string beans. Couldn’t get enough!

Just made four instead of 12. I basted the chicken 3 times while it cooked during the last 15 minutes.  I was worried that the chicken would look a bit gray since the recipe states that the skin should be removed. My only concern is that the juice from the chicken and the BBQ sauce  aren't thick.

Everything was going along great until I decided to follow the directions for cooking time against my better judgment. Way too overdone, even for chicken thighs.  So 2 star deducted.  Will try this again maybe some time and cut the cooking time down by at least 30%.

I have tried this recipe twice so far and I think it’s ok. The sauce does not come out sticky and caramelized, it’s too runny despite me eliminating water! I suggest a yogurt and tomato paste based dressing, more like a tandoori sauce which I add ketchup and bbq sauce and other spices too! That one comes out thick and sticky on the chicken!

I broiled for 10 min at the end, to make it  more charred and crispy. Next time I may try the final 10 min on a BBQ.....for the sames effect. Tasty.
Yes, I would make it again.

Very tender and pretty good, but I would make the sauce thicker. Double the amount of sauce items and add some coagulant like flour or cornstarch.

This tasted NOTHING like BBQ chicken.  it was watery and it the chicken tasted as though it had been cooked in liquid...because it was!  It just had a bland boiled taste to it..I had to add bottled bbq sauce to it to make it edible.  Definitely won't be making this one again.

This is a great recipe. I did have to thicken it up a bit after removing the chicken. The chicken juices tend to thin out the sauce, but it only took a couple minutes in a saucepan with a little bit of flour/water paste (I didn't have corn starch) to get it to thicken again.

This recipe was OK but I feel like the water cooking off of the chicken ended up diluting the sauce too much.  I was actually quite amazed at how much water comes out of the chicken when you leave it covered as this recipe suggests.  
The thighs were almost completely submerged in broth when done.

I did cook 16 thighs instead of 12 so this added some extra water, and they were pretty well packed into my oblong dish.  If I try again I will maybe take the covering off halfway through and see if all that water cooks down some, it was nearly a stew, which seems weird to me for a barbeque recipe.

Made this tonight for dinner.  Was in a rush, and was looking for something that I already had all the ingredients.  I made this exactly as the recipe was written, except I didn't add water, and I just mixed all the  BBQ sauce ingredients  together and coated the chicken thighs before they went in the oven.(Of course, you season to your own tasting, like I added a little black pepper and a little extra ketchup)  I cooked the 10 chicken thighs  at 400 for 35 minutes (turning once) and they came out perfect.  I doubled the BBQ sauce recipe just cause we like things saucey.  My entire family loved this, including my 10 year old and 5 year old.  This one is a keeper since it's fast, easy and stuff I always have on hand.

Made this with double the sauce. Came out fantastic the family was drizzling the sauce over their mashed potatoes and corn. Glad I made the extra sauce. I have since made the sauce again and used it on baby back ribs.

This was ok.  Not your typical barbeque sauce,  not barbequey enough for me.  A little on the watery side, not oowy, goowy or sticky enough for me.

This is the second time I do this recipe and I forgot to review it last time. Every time I am just blown away! We actually grilled skinless chicken thighs and basted throughout out cooking and everyone loved it! I should add that none of us like vinegar much and so I did about half the amount of vinegar, but the sauce came out amazing nonetheless.

I tried this for dinner tonight with brown rice and corn. It wasn't as amazing as I thought it would be, maybe because I didn't make the original serving? at the end of the cooking time I served the chicken and added wondra to the sauce since it was so watery and made it thicker to serve on the chicken.

Delicious, and easy to make!  I usually have all of the ingredients on hand, so as long as I have the chicken thighs - I am good to go!  Husband says this is a "keeper recipe".  I may try adding some crushed red pepper flakes, or Tabasco, next time - just to give it a little kick!

This was very nice. The meat was a little dry but that is my fault as I used breasts instead of thighs. Next time I might try simmering the sauce after it has cooked to serve over the meat to add flavour as some have suggested. It did take a while to cook for a simple recipe but it gave me time to do the dishes. Thanks for the recipe.

Our family really likes this recipe. It's a family favorite, for sure. I add more brown sugar than the recipe calls for, because I find it a bit too tangy otherwise.  Also, I always double or triple the sauce because the family loves it so much.  We usually have this with wholewheat broad-egg noodles and spoon the extra sauce over the noodles. Yummy!

This is SO SO good!! If you are pressed for time, you can use Stubs or another great pre-made barbeque sauce and just pour it over the top. Of course that defeats the recipe but regardless, this is just an excellent cooking method for the chicken thighs. They are incredibly tender and tasty.

I'm rating this on the execution, not the sauce recipe. I used Sweet Baby Ray's sauce but followed the rest of cooking instructions. Family LOVED it! It's very tender. I was kinda nervous to cook anything @ 500 degrees but it turned out delish!! Someday I'll take the extra time to make the sauce but for now, thanks for the cooking technique!

So good. The only thing I did different was use spicy brown mustard instead of the dry mustard. Didn't have any left. I will definetly keep this recipie. I did thicken the sauce with some corn starch. Will double the sauce next time.

My family just did not like this much. Too tangy, I think, possibly because of the vinegar. I'll keep looking.

I used 6 boneless, skinless thighs and two breasts (cut in half). I also put in a crockpot. I doubled the sauce and left out the water after reading the reviews. All of my family loved it even my grandchildren that are picky about strong barbeque sauces. I think next time I will try it in the oven or not cook as long (did it 6 hours on low) in the crockpot.

This was an easy dish to make during crunch time when I was exhausted but had to feed my family. I made a few changes after reading reviews from other members by adding 1/2 tsp each of onion powder, garlic powder and cayenne pepper. It was really tasty and even though I accidentally cooked it at 350 degrees instead of 300, it was still so very tender - no knife necessary to cut the boneless, skinless chicken breast I used. Rice or mashed potatoes would be great to use with the gravy. I would like to add onions and thicken the gravy giving it a thicker consistency next time we have this.  A spiced up version of creamed corn would also be a great addition to play with the flavors. The flavors were marvelous!! Even my picky son loved it!! We've got a winner for sure.

I don't usually make chicken thighs but my husband loves them so I was so glad to find this recipe! It was very yummy. I took the recommendation from someone else and substituted 1 tbsp. of the ketchup for chili sauce and it gave it just that extra kick. Definitely making this recipe again!

I really enjoyed this recipe, however I like spicy and I don't like ketchup. So I repaced the ketchup with Asian chili garlic sause.

I just loved this recipe. I have baked bbq thighs in the oven before and it never came out as tender as this did. The sauce is wonderful too. The only change I made to the recipe was adding 2 tbsp of cornstarch mixed w/cold water to the sauce at the very end to thicken it up. Easy fix to the runny sauce problem. I will definately be making this again!

Made it in my slow cooker then grilled to brown because it's too darned hot to turn the oven on today.  The sauce is fabulous, I'll never buy bottled sauce again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent flavour. Two comments, as I adjusted the recipe down to 8 drumsticks. First, not enough sauce, I had to top it up. Second, as others have commented, it was a bit runny. So I thickened it a bit with Bonesucking BBQ Sauce, as the flavours are very similar.

This is the best chicken I've ever had, no exaggerations whatsoever. I used it a few weeks ago to get rid of some of the chicken I had, and have made it repeatedly since. Per some of the other suggestions, I double the sauce recipe, cut out the water all together, and add cayenne pepper. So good!!

The sauce was not thick - that's good for us! I used it to make the week's worth of thighs for lunch...had to come up with a different lunch idea since these disappeared quickly. Thanks.

This was awsome!  My husband said it was the best barbeque chicken he's ever eaten.  The only change I made was to thicken the sauce before pouring it on the chicken.  I also want to add that it was only enough sauce for 2 thighs and two legs. Thanks for sharing.

I just can't can see what all 5-star hubub is about. This recipe isn't bad but it certainly won't win any awards. It's OK in a pinch, but I'm going to continue looking for my "keeper" oven-baked bbq chicken recipe.

This was very good, but honestly, not all that different than the flavor from a quality store-bought bbq sauce. The consistency was just thinner, which actually I preferred for marinating and basting. Loved it with the thigh meat.

This is so EASY! I make this at least once a  week with a family pack of chicken legs.  To make it super fast, I just add a bottle of sauce on top...with a few extra flavors.

Wonderful recipe!  I didn't change a thing except used breasts instead of wings.  Not only did they taste great, but were extremely tender as well.

This reciepe was really fast and easy to make. My children didn't even fight me on eating dinner. I agree the sauce was thin but the flavor it made the chicken as well as the tenderness was worth it. I definatly will be making this again.

Enjoyed this recipe very much. I added  a couple extra tsp of brown sugar. I marinated the chicken breasts in the sauce in the fridge for an hour and grilled on the b-b-que. It turned out juicy with a bit of a nice crust.

This was pretty good but not my favorite bbq sauce. The taste of the chili powder was very strong. I ended up adding extra quirt of kethchup to the sauce. Still very good.

I made the recipe as written except using a whole cut-up chicken instead of just thighs.  I have some white meat only eaters in my house.  I liked the sauce and the chicken was fall-off-the-bone tender.  I will hang on to the recipe and will probably make again when I'm hungry for bbq chicken and it's not grilling weather.

Yummy and good. Makes a great homemade bbq sauce that tastes great. I did add onion powder to my sauce and used apple cider vinegar. I also added plain sugar. This taste wonderful and added a good flavor to the chicken.

As said many times over, great tasting sauce but very runny. I thickened it with cornstarch before pouring over the chicken, but end result was still runny. I will prob save this recipe for the sauce and use it the next time I decide to grill some chicken.

made with four drumstick/thigh combo pieces.  Omitted water. Doubled the sauce recipe (proved to be unnecessary). Did not pre-cook the sauce. I had a lot of juice left in the pan. The chicken was very moist and delicious. Will make again and again.

This was absolutely delicious!  The chicken was so moist and fell right off the bone.  I did use chicken thighs, but I would imagine that this would be an awesome recipe for any kind of chiken.  The sauce has great flavor!

Excellent!  We halved the chicken so we'd have more sauce (and used only a little bit of water in the sauce) and it was amazing!  We agreed that it was one of the best things that we've made recently!!

The bbq sauce definatly makes this dish!  It is SO good!  I used bone-in skinless chicken thighs & I also doubled the sauce.  I omitted the water all together from the bbq sauce and added a couple dashes of Frank's Red Hot Sauce.  Cooked for 15 minutes with just a few pads of butter & salt, pepper, and garlic powder on top.  Then coated with half of the bbq sauce, cooked for 20 minutes, and then basted with the rest of the sauce, and cooked for 10 more minutes.  45 minutes total.  Next time I might triple the sauce just so we can have some for dipping on the side.  The whole family loved this dish, and I will be making it again!

This barbeque sauce was really good!! This was my first time making barbeque sauce from scratch. I used chicken wings, I like my skin to be a little crispy, so I baked the wings on 500 degrees in the oven for 15 min on each side. Lowered the temp to 350 then poured the barbeque sauce over the chicken and baked them for another 30-40 min. The sauce is watery in the beginning, but once you pour it on the meat and bake, it thickens.I had leftovers the next day so I reheated the chicken in the oven and it was even better. Thanks for sharing.

I changed this up a bit, but still thought I would review to give some advice to other cooks. I used boneless chicken breasts instead and so cooked it differently: baked at 350 degrees for 20 minutes, then added cooked sauce and baked for additional 25 minutes. For the sauce I made a few additions: Add 1 pinch  red pepper, 1/2 tsp. garlic powder, used 1 tsp. salt, used 2 Tbsp. of apple cider vinegar, used 1/4 cup water, used 1 Tbsp. lemon juice, and used 1 Tbsp cornstarch mixed with 1 Tbsp. water to thicken the sauce after simmering for 15 minutes. everyone loved the sauce and the chicken turned out nice and moist. I'll probably be making this dish again with my changes.

Great recipe. I follow the recipe exactly, except I use 6 chicken thighs instead of 12. I clean out the chicken thoroughly, removing the skin, tearing out the fatties around the chicken, and washing out the clear slimy film on top of the chicken before baking it. It decreases the amount of fat that goes into the BBQ sauce after it is finished baking. The remaining sauce goes great over white rice. This is a keeper and I will use it every time I make BBQ chicken!

AWESOME!!!  I made some minor changes: sauteed some fresh minced onion and 1 clove garlic in small amount of EVOO, used 1 T prepared yellow mustard as I didn't have any dry, and I made a double bath of sauce, omitted the water, but only used 1 T of lemon juice,  and used apple cider vinegar instead of regular it was great! Cooked as directed, except for last 15 minutes I did 7 of that in broiler on low, and meat was very moist and tender. Also, I only cooked 3 thighs and 3 legs...If you're gonna actually cook all 12 pieces I think you'll need more sauce! Can't wait to make again!! RAVE REVIEWS!!

Great!  Used chicken breasts but I bet it would be better with legs and thighs. Doubled the sauce but didn't double the water or brown sugar (my husband doesn't like sweet). Made mashed potates as suggested and was a fantastic meal. Chicken was very moist.

This barbeque chicken is phenomenal!!! The chicken was falling apart it was so tender and juicy! I made it to recipe, and as other reviewers said, it was a bit runny, but still amazing! The sauce really thickened up when I reheated the leftovers in the oven. SOOOOO GOOD!!!! I will definitely be making this again and again and sharing it with all my friends and family! Thanks for this recipe!!!

Great flavor! Tangy (from the vinegar) and sweet, the way I like it. It did end up being a little thin, but I used it as a marinade (overnight) so the chicken was still flavorful. Then I grilled it instead of baking it in the oven. Tasted great! The only change I will make next time is reducing the water to 2 tablespoons. Thanks for the EASY recipe!

I scaled this recipe down to half of the originial servings. First, 15 minutes is WAY too long to simmer the sauce for. Mine simmered for only ten minutes and by then almost all the sauce was burnt on the bottom of my pan. The second time I made it I decided to double the sauce recipe because what I had made the first time didn't look like it was nearly enough. The result was that after 15 minutes of baking the chicken, the excess sauce that had settled at the bottom of the pan had burned enough to set off my smoke detector 3 times before I took the chicken out of the oven and put it back in with a cleaner pan.
I gave this recipe 2 stars because once the chicken eventually came out, it was very good.

I was searching for a recipe to bake chicken  that would be moist and this is what I tried.  Awesome!  It wasn't the traditional thick bbq sauce, but the chicken was falling off the bone, my husband and I both loved it, very flavorful.

Chicken comes out moist and fork cut tender.  Sauce is not hot just tangy enough.

This was so easy and good.  I omitted the water, and didn't cook the sauce first.  Next time I will cook the sauce so it thickens.  If I'm pressed for time, I'll prepare the night before and let the chicken marinate in it.  I used 6 chicken legs and 4 thighs and doubled the recipe.

I had 2 big chicken thighs. Scaled down recipe to 4, didn't bother simmering sauce either, just threw it all in the oven, sat back and had a glass of wine.  Served with leftover rice and a salad.  Easy & Tasty.

I did not add water, and I didn't have chili powder or mustard powder-....I added regular prepared mustard.  I didn't like it, but my kids, and boyfriend did.  They liked it a lot, would make again-correctly though.  I think onions would be good in this as well.

We loved the flavor of this sauce. It puts bottled sauces to shame. We'll be making a batch today to use on bbq ribs.

Thanks! Trish in Omaha

I really liked the flavour of this sauce,     I didnt cover it so didnt have the problem of thin sauce however this works better with wings as they have the skin to keep them from drying out. I think marinading the meat would do it more justice.  I didnt have brown sugar so used white and an extra tsp of molasses which added a nice colour.

This was fabulous.  Everyone loved it including my 3 year old who won't eat anything!  The only change I did was to double the sauce.

I like this BBQ sauce better than any store bought sauce I have ever tried.  I used orange instead of lemon.

I made this with thighs and legs and it was alright. It was too runny and at the last minute I actually stirred in some Bullseye from the fridge to thicken this up. The flavor was good, just too runny. We like our sauce to be thick on our chicken.

This chicken was GREAT! After reading previous reviews, I decided to add some extra ketchup and brown sugar. I was afraid the vinegar would overpower the other flavors. I cooked boneless/skinless breats ~ so, my cooking time was not as long as the recipe states. I was impressed with how juicy and tender the breasts stayed. Thanks so much for a great recipe! :o)
