I use quinoa in many recipes, and this was my first time using quinoa flour. I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great! I served it w/ blueberries and melted vanilla gelato (for a mock creme anglaise sauce) to those unfamiliar w/ quinoa there will be a distinct taste.

I added strawberries and used coconut oil to grease the pan. They were delicious! ...And easy to make.

Made these for my picky one year old because I wanted a protein rich option for breakfast. Made a soft tofu and mixed fruit blend for the filling. Turned out great! Will make these again.
