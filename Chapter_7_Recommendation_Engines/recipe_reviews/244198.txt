We made these for Home School Home Ec, and they turned out great! The main addition/substitution I would suggest, and we made, was instead of using butter and sugar to cement the apple slices into place, use blackberry jam. Raspberry, or even a marmalade of choice would work. The blackberry juice, was absorbed by the apples and gave them a lovely blushed hue!

Advice: cut the apples in the thinnest slices possible.
 I microwaved the apple slices in lemon juice to keep them from browning. I used jam instead of butter and I sprinkled it with cinnamon sugar. I also used the smaller and thinner apple slices to roll in the middle (cause those ones are being bent the most) then gradually placed the bigger slices outside. Then dusted with powdered surgar mixed with a bit of cinnamon ^^

I followed the recipe exactly and the roses came out looking just gorgeous! Crispy on outside and quite tasty.  A word of caution: I have made them in a muffin tin and to make sure they fit, I might have rolled the roses a bit to tight, because when they were done, the inside was a bit underdone to my taste. Next time I will try ramekins and will make sure to make the rolls a bit more lose so the hit can cook them more evenly. I would also try to make them sweeter  next time, may be will use jam as other reviewer recommended. Thank you,  Chief John for yet another great recipe. I will definitely make them again and again!

I will make it again, until my mother-in-law likes the taste, and then, we are making 48 for our family get together next year.
My recipe actually came from someone else...who used no eggs. Added lemon to the apples, so they don't turn color, and used apricot jam on top of the dough, then sprinkled with cinnamon and lay the apples on top. They are rolled the same and everything else is done the same.  My only problem is that I scrimped on the jam, but I will use my own recipe...Its nice to see that others make it too. I used Maple Leaf Puff Pastry on my first batch, but will use PC All-Butter Puff Pastry with the second...and see if it comes out less heavy.

I could not find 'puff' pastry, I used seamless crescent roll dough. To speed things up I treated the whole square of rolled out dough with the butter , sugar and cinnamon and then cut each strip. I spayed paper cupcake liners with butter flavored cooking spray and put them in the ramekins so all I had to do was lift out the 'roses' and place them in a windowed bakery gift box for my friend. Fun and so easy I'm going to do it with my grade school granddaughters!

I made this but did it an easier way. I laid the apple slices on the strips of dough and just sprinkled them with brown sugar and cinnamon powder. I didn't sprinkle the tops with sugar because then the sugar burns and looks like black roses. This is a pretty apple dessert. Tastes even better served warm with a scoop of ice cream on the side. I'm adding my photo.

Followed the recipe, using the instructions in the video. They were beautiful and delicious. Would say they are just as (or more) tasty than apple pie, yet more beautiful and easier to make. Even bigger bonus - they're easy to make just the right amount when you're preparing for only two or three people. Will definitely make them again, and keep them in mind for guests and parties. They were a little difficult to eat with just a dessert fork - perhaps because the apples are a little more firm than in pie, which makes them more flavorful, but not as easy to cut through. 
Changes: 
o Maybe our apples were too large or sliced too thin; used an average of 1/2 apple per rosette. 
o Tried different levels of layering the apples and different size ramekins. When baked, even heavy layering looked good. For ramekin size, however, if you want to easily remove an attractive rosette after baking, be sure it's tall enough to hold all of the rosette. 
o They were starting to look pretty dark by 30 minutes of baking, so turned the oven down 10 degrees for the last ten minutes. Perfect! 
o Took the advice of the video and went lighter on the sugar with most of this test batch. We liked those with lighter sugar better. 
Thanks for a wonderfully easy and impressive recipe!

I used Pink Pearl apples, because they're pink all the way through, and they were very pretty. No microwave, so I placed my apple slices on a parchment-lined baking sheet with another parchment sheet on top, baked about 5 min @ 350, and left, covered, to cool and soften. I used an entire apple for each one.

Pretty impressive and tasty!  Followed instructions except omitted egg wash.   Used the apples from my tree, and a muffin pan instead of ramekins.  Next time I will tent the apple roses after about 30  minutes baking to prevent over carmelizing  the apples/rose top .  One sheet of puff pastry made three apple roses.

the only change I did was very thinly slice apples and made sure that there was a good roll going to keep apples from sliding out..watch out though, if using cupcake pans watch how big the roll gets, if too big it sticks if too small sticks at bottom, I found that if I placed parchment paper on a cookie sheet and sprayed with pam, tucked a toothpick to hold rose together...came out beautiful and homemade caramel sauce made with brown sugar and butter was the best recipe for this....to die for...

I made a dozen of these for our  Christmas Eve gathering and they were a huge hit! I made the first few by the  instructions then decided to play a little.  I used a little sugar-free raspberry jam along the bottom of the pastry before I added the apples to it and omitted the cinnamon. That added a little more red to the bottom of the rose petals along with a bit more flavor.  After that I decided to try something different...After I put the apple slices in water, I microwaved them for about a minute and a half; then put them right in the fridge for about 8 hours. When I took them out later, the color from the peel had run into the meat of the apple. I made them with the jam and, OMG, they were gorgeous!!! The petals were streaked with red/pink color. Absolutely beautiful!  I will certainly be making these again...and again!! Many thanks for sharing!!!

I made two sets of these for the first time on 9/26/16.  In both cases, I used non-stick baking pans - one was a muffin pan; the other one had a ruffled shape to it. I cooked one pan at a time for the alloted 45 minutes at 375 degrees, and all of the bottoms and part of the sides got extra dark (just short of burning). I had to actually scrape a few off before putting them on a presentation plate. 

I was disappointed that apples done this way hardly retain any of their bright, vibrant red skin color...they basically all just turn very dark.  On the second set, I had the good sense to put a tent of foil loosely over the top of the pan to help prevent over-browning, but this did nothing to help the BOTTOMS of the pastries which still pretty much got burned a bit.  

I definitely don't suggest putting any sugar on the top before baking them.  Any suggestions on how to keep the bottom of the pastries from burning or over-caramelizing would be appreciated!  Perhaps putting a cookie sheet under my muffin pan?  I don't know.  Help. LOL

I made these yesterday and they are SO addicting!  Easy to make and hard to mess up.  These would be great for a party or get together too.  Very attractive and look like you slaved all day to make them, but you don't. I used three apples from my trees and used two sheets of puff pastry.  Got a dozen apple roses all told.

We substituted with pastry crust and, though perhaps not quite as fantastic, they were delicious.

Used 4 apples, but it took well over 2 1/2 hours to make, not counting the cooking time. wasn't all that great in the end, and dough in the middle was still very undercooked while the outside was perfect. Not worth it in my opinion and won't be making these again.

Was beautiful, tasted amazing (used a thin smear of homemade cherry jam instead of cinnamon sugar) and was shockingly easy to make.    Almost didn't share!

Only got 1 to look decent. 45 minutes of baking left the insides undercooked and soggy. Do not sprinkle sugar on top of roses. The apples burn. Taste was ok.

I made these for my husband to take to work and kept one back for myself.  These are not only beautiful but delicious!  I used brown sugar instead of white and it tasted just like apple pie.  I will definitely make these again.

Very helpful video Chef John. These are really easy to make and delicious. My modifications were: I tented the ramekins with foil at 30 min, didn't use the egg wash and I sprinkled a little bourbon over the roses before cooking. Turned out great. Served them plated with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. I love the way you can make as many as you need. Thanks!

I wanted to do something different for Christmas this year and decided to try these Baked Apple Roses. The entire family LOVED them! 

It did take more than one apple to make 12 tarts/roses. Overall I used half a dozen apples and had a small baggie of scrapes we could snack on the next day (pieces too small for the roses). I also mixed cinnamon and baker's sugar to sprinkle on the apples and puff pastry. 

Also, for someone who might not be a baker/cook and wouldn't know this right off... have a bowl of Sprite/7up/water with lemon juice near by when cutting your apples. Put the slices of apple in the bowl and submerge under the liquid. This will prevent browning of your apples.

This is a decent starter recipe, but it really needs some tweaking. 45 minutes was way too long to bake for in my opinion. I would also recommend making your own pastry sheet from scratch so you can sweeten the dough with sugar and cinnamon to taste before rolling it out. It's too bland otherwise.

I made it and loved these!!  I was planning to take cinnamon rolls to a church get together, but I totally changed my mind after making these easy scrumptious Apple roses. I didn't have ramekins, so I used my very large cupcake tins. Turned out beautifully. A powdered sugar glaze my only addition. Thank you for sharing this. It will certainly become a family tradition at our home

This was actually easier to make than it looked and turned out great!  I skipped the egg wash and went light on the sugar mixture.  Turned out light and crispy with plenty of apple flavor.  Will make again for sure.

Lovely addition to buffets. Taste awesome. One suggestion is to slice Apple thin and soften according to directions to facilitate rolling without cracking apples and distorting the round flower look. Good with Bartlet pears also.

I followed the advice of some other reviewers. I did not wish to use so much sugar and utilized apricot preserves. In effort to better use the puff pastry I cut each sheet into 3 parts (the two folds) Laid the warm thin apple slices along one edge and folded over to complete.. I buttered the outside and the (large) muffin pan to ensure ease of removal.  Used both sheets to create the six for this muffin pan.  Will make again maybe try the triangle layout next time to avoid a less cooked center of puff pastry.

I followed the directions and found that these were dry and not very flavorful.  I would like them to be moist with more flavor.
I think they look better then they taste.

Very pretty and not too difficult.   My 15 yr old and I made this for fun because she wanted baked apples, and usually those are brown and mushy.  These are crispy and delicious.

Very tasty dessert...everyone loved them. I got 3 desserts out of each sheet of puff pastry (6 for a box). I would suggest putting a sheet pan underneath on the bottom rack while the pastry is baking. It will catch all the juice and butter that may bubble over while cooking. I also made some condensed milk caramel and put a smear of it on the bottom of the plate before serving. Easy recipe to make, yum !

This is an excellent recipe!  It's delicious & incredibly beautiful!  I'm shocked how easy it is to make.  The directions are superb.  I did omit the cinnamon/sugar & replaced it with almond paste smeared the length of the pastry strip.  The almond paste recipe is on the site.

By the time the pastry was brown the apples had dried out and started to turn black. The pastry was still doughy on the inner parts. It tasted awful. The pictures were so pretty.

We tried these tonight and they were pretty easy to make after watching Chef John's video. We had to improv a bit and wound up making it with available dough laying around but altogether, this was a surprisingly easy and nice dish to make. With a little practice I think this dish could be mind-blowing. The middle of the Apple Rose is absolutely delicious.

Elegant and easy! I made several changes, taking into account other readers comments. I lowered the temperature to 375 and started checking it out 30 minutes. I also had to use some 4 ounce ramekins, because I didn’t have enough big ones. I also noticed that for the 6 ounce ramekins, the pastry strip needed to be longer than 12 inches like 16 to 18 inches. 

I rolled out one sheet of puff pastry and got 4 roses from it (using the 4 ounce ramekins, and two or three roses in 6 oz ramekins.)  I would definitely put jam in them, if you’re used to a dessert that has some sweetness. A little bit of cinnamon and sugar “wasn’t quite enough on the sweetness for me.  I  used apricot jam. I also didn’t sprinkle the roses with sugar before putting them in the oven, so the pedals wouldn’t burn (The sugar and cinnamon were rolled up into the puff pastry). I wil post pictures of mine.  They are a very impressive dessert, very elegant. I drizzled mine with the salted caramel sauce, but a boysenberry syrup would also be good over the top.

I bought the big Pillsbury biscuit dough cans and used that for puff pastry- two biscuits per rose. Turned out great. A warning: he says you can use a muffin tin, which I did, but the compartments were not quite as big as they needed to be. The roses kind of expanded upward in a spiral and flopped over. Overall, great recipe! Delicious, easy, and aesthetically pleasing.

This recipe turned out fabulous!  I didn't have any puff pastry, so I did what Chef John did and used biscuit dough.  My special friend thought I was magic!  Delicious! I will for sure make this again.   I love Chef John.

These were great.  I made a few adjustments.  I left out the sugar to top before rolling as well as the egg wash.  Then before serving I topped with a pinch of the cinnamon sugar and gave them a very light dusting of icing sugar.

A side note, I did use a muffin tin to bake these and preped each with a spray of pam baking spray and a sprinkle of white granulated sugar.  I cooled for 5 mins and they popped right out.

I didn’t change anything but i wish I would’ve let the apples dry completely because they watered too much in the oven and made a mess. Regardless i will definitely be making this time and time again.

Easy to make... each one turned out picture perfect. Someone asked about how you can keep the bottom of roses from burning. I always put a pan of water on the lower rack...you might give that a try.

Made these for the first time today, they were fantastic! One large apple and one sheet of puff pastry made 3 roses. Had a little difficulty removing them from the ramekins, should have removed almost immediately. We loved them, will definitely make again!

Delicious!

Like chef John, I used pastry dough I was working with for something else.  Taste was great.  I would say it may take a bit to develop the technique to make the roses look as pretty as John’s.  But they were pretty enough.  This is a very clever and good recipe.

The recipe worked particularly  well with raspberry jam spread on the pastry instead of butter.  Much better color in the "rose"
Each pastry sheet made four roses if cut about  2 3/4 inches after rolling it out.  It is best if turned out while still warm so that the pastry doesn't stick to the ramekin.  Will definitely make again was a hit at dinner.

Made these for Easter for the first time,
 They were a hit everyone loved them, they were very easy to make a little time consuming but worth it! Definitely making them again but will try adding brown sugar crumb to it next time.

I haven't tried them yet, but they look pretty. Are used Pepperidge farm puff pastry, each sheet was able to make three roses. I used a mandolin to slice the apples and make them even. Used the lemon water method to keep them from browning, after that I drained the apples, and poured boiling hot water on to the apples. Let them sit for seven minutes, then drained and they were ready to shape. Will definitely make again, and try using jam next time. If you have an extra large muffin pan, use that one. The roses and up expanding a little better and look nicer than in a standard muffin pan. I tried both pans.

I love this recipe....and the video made it easy to follow.I used pie dough and trimmed it to make 3 strips.Using just one Granny Smith apple-I microwaved it with the sugar mixture sprinkled on the slices already.Since it wasn't puff pastry I rolled the "roses" pretty snug and the 3 went into a muffin tin sprayed with butter flavored  Pam.Then I pulled up some of the "petals" and spread them outward a bit.Heeding the warnings of other reviewers (thank you) about burning in a metal tin, I baked at 350 for 45 minutes,increased to 375 for 10 more minutes and they came out perfect.Wish I'd had a camera-they turned out so pretty dusted /w/ p.sugar and a maraschino cherry on top.Not bad for my 1st try.......Hubby is my critic and said they were perfect.Like a few bites of apple pie that his  Mother would have loved.She was the baker....we miss her but she said I'm the new baker now and 20 yrs. after her passing, I think she'd be proud.Thank you chef.

Love this recipe! I microwaved my thinly cut apple slices with lemon juice & water to prevent them from browning. Sprinkled with brown sugar instead of white & they turned out perfect using a muffin tin! Beautiful, easy & delicious! Definitely a keeper!

Very pretty.  Turned out perfectly.  I did place them in a greased muffin tin with an insulated cookie sheet under the muffin tin (to prevent the bottom from burning as noted by another reviewer).

So easy!  Looks beautiful.  I made them in a Texas muffin pan, though next time  I may try muffin liners as it was a little hard to get out.   Yummmmm. Thanks.

I followed the instructions as written except I used the mandoline to slice the apples extra thin. My family loved the taste of these!

This is an awesome recipe! Need to make more than 8, as they last only a few minutes.

I made these in a muffin tin. They are very pretty and I'm sure they are tasty( they are still cooling on the rack ) I will find out tomorrow when I serve them for dessert at Christmas dinner. I had a real problem removing them from the muffin tin. Maybe next time I will omit sugaring the buttered tin though.

I would add more cinnamon sugar next time, but it was easy and delicious.

I used a muffin tin to make these but they came out fairly well. I did not modify anything else in the recipe, however I neglected to microwave my apples at first. This step is a must for any halfway crisp apple.
