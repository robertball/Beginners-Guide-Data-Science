Few missing ingredients in this, Beef for example is important, Beaten eggs thats sliced thinly is another missing ingredient. Asparagus is not included in the traditional receipe either. Koreans eat this dish when there is something to celebrate or they are entertaining guests.

Mmmm... I love the flavor - salty, sweet and pungent. I used Korean sweet potato starch noodles - I don't know that is the same as the recipe. I used a whole onion & I was too lazy to cut match-stick carrots, so I shredded them instead (that might have made them a little wet, but it was still good). I used spinach instead of asparagus & fresh mushrooms instead of dried shiitake.  Great recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

Forgot to soak the mushrooms so I left them out. Also swapped blanched spinach for the asparagus and tossed in a few leftover sprouts.

I thought it was pretty great although it could have used more flavor.  i can't blame the recipe since i made some substitutions.   i added crumbled tofu and i used oyster mushrooms instead of shiitake.  i didn't have asparagus so i omitted that.

Kind of strange to have asparagus with japchae, so I replaced it with spinach. This is sort of bland as is, so next time I'll possibly do 1.5x the soy sauce + sugar mixture and double the sesame oil. I also put in a bit of rice vinegar into the sauce mixture, to give it a bit of tang. Be careful not to add too much oil while stir frying (although the noodles stick to the pan easily...) or it'll become a bit too oily. Yummy and much cheaper than buying it at a Korean supermarket!

Being Korean, my mom use to make this all the time for us....family and friends.  Sometimes she would add beef or chicken...but it's great with or without.  I made it the way you have it written, and it came out delicious!

I thought it was good. Milder than I thought it would be, but still tasty.

Made this as a side dish to some broccoli stuffed chicken.  Substituted green beans for the asparagus.  Did not add the rest of the sesame oil, because the 1 teaspoon seemed to be enough.  Also, used the rice cellophane noodles.

This recipe turned out very much like what I eat at the Korean restaurant we frequent.  My husband, who is Korean liked it very much as well.  I did use spinach instead of asparagus, just my preference.  I also added tofu, just because that's how I usually get it at the restaurant.  My husband would normally eat this with some beef or pork in it but he liked this and is happy to eat a vegetarian version of it, as I'm vegetarian.  I found myself adding extra sesame oil and soy sauce but I may have used more noodles than the recipe really called for.  Thanks for the lovely recipe!

I used cellophane noodles for this dish. It was tasty, and I will make it again, but I will double the sauce or use less noodles as I found there was not quite enough sauce for the amount of noodles and that is why I scored it low. I omitted the asparagus and sesame seeds, and substituted the fresh mushrooms for the dried. Other vegetables like broccoli or celery could be added too.

This recipe earns 5 stars for the sauce alone!  Tastes just like the noodles I love at every Korean bbq place,  you know, the ones that come as one of several  small dishes with the meat you order.   I make it just as the recipe dictates, and it's perfect. Add whatever  veg/ meat you like or have  on hand.  I don't know how authentically Korean it will be,  but it will likely taste amazing.

This was yummy!  I used baby bok choy instead of asparagus.  Didn't have green onion or mushrooms so just left those out.  A tasty, filling vegan meal!

Being like a stir-fry, this can be adapted to include the ingredients and quantities that you want.  I prefer blanched spinach instead of asparagus and added scrambled eggs (fried like a pancake then cut into strips).  I also like a high vegetables to noodles ratio.  For this approximate size recipe though, like other reviews mention, you need about double the soy sauce mixture and sesame oil than called for to get a good flavor.

This is the first Jap Chae recipe I've personally made, but I thought our was delicious.  I was at a pot luck where there was a variety of ethnic dishes; this was one of them. After trying it, I just had to get the recipe!

Made some changes. Used a 14 oz box of rice noodles. 5 Tbs soy sauce and 4 Tbs sugar. Omitted asparagus and used fresh baby spinach in it's place. I bought shredded carrots and used a handful. I bought a bag of finely shredded slaw mix and added a handful and a half. I also used an 8 oz bin of fresh sliced mushrooms. And followed the recipe otherwise. Turned out really good!!! So good my daughter had leftovers of it the next morning for breakfast. ha ha!

this is such a good recipe! I used glass noodles for this recipe. I did make a few changes and one was something I read from a review which was adding an egg. I added two. I also had to add much more soy sauce and sugar for this recipe. I guess because I used glass noodles. Everything else I followed the recipe as is. So yummy!
