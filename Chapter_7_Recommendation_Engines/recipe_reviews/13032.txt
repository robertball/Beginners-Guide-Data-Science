Really, really good stuff!!! I substituted corn for the hominy and more kidney beans for the lima beans. I also added chopped fresh cilantro and sliced avocado on top - extremely tasty! The whole family liked this dinner so I will absolutely be making it again.

Seriously, this is my favorite food. Ever.  My mom always made it when I was little during the winter.  I just made it again, and the best thing with this recipe: use your favorites! I put corn in it instead of lima beans, and I used jalape√±os instead of chili peppers.  I also made my own taco seasoning from a recipe on here (I think taco seasoning I) instead of the store package (I'm really big on my food being organic).  I didn't add the ranch package either.  Making my own seasoning made this even better than I could imagine! I love it with cheese and sour cream. Mmm, it's my guilty pleasure.  And since there's only 2 of us here, this is enough for me to have dinner for a week or so, it's so good I don't mind eating it for days on end!! My boyfriend who hates beans even loves it! :)

Add a dollop of sour cream for the kids to tone down the spices. I used Mexican stewed tomatoes, butter beans, and substituted frozen corn for the hominy.  Serve with corn chips (and guacamole).  Fresh cilantro is wonderful and really compliments this soup.

I adjusted this recipe to suit our favorite ingredients and to make it a little lower in salt. I did not add the additional salt, I used three cans of organic black beans that I rinsed and drained instead of pinto-lima-kidney beans. I made my own taco seasoning mix and ranch dressing mix (sans salt) and instead of water, I used a low sodium beef broth. When I got all the ingredients mixed, the soup looked a bit thin to me so I threw in two 14 oz. cans tomato sauce and two cans drained and rinsed white corn. This was nice to come home to after a long afternoon and we enjoyed it. I'll make this again, with my changes.

This is AMAZING! I used shredded chicken instead of ground beef. (i'm not really a fan of ground beef so i think it made it better than it would have been otherwise) I also found that there wasnt quite enough liquid, so i doubled the water amount and therefore put in twice the amound of taco seasoning and ranch dressing mix.  I also added a can of corn.  It was fabulous!  My husband loved it!

This was FANTASTIC!  ...and healthy!  I only used about a 3/4 lb of lean ground beef.  I can't imagine using 2 lbs, I think it would be way too chunky to be considered soup.  I left out the Lima beans and hominey but added a can of corn instead.  Topped it with a sprinkle of cheddar, light sour cream, fresh lime juice, avacado and several tortilla chips.  I thought the idea of ranch dressing mix was rather strange but the taste of this soup was really impressive.  Healthy and rather inexpensive meal!

Quick, tasty and super easy! I used 1 lb each of ground beef and ground turkey. Also, 2 cans petite-diced garlic tomatoes and no lima beans (added a little extra white hominy to make up for it). I decreased pepper to 1/2 tsp. and added a little extra water to make it soupier. I salted to taste (salty already because of the seasonings-did not need anywhere near a teaspoon). Served with dollop of sour cream, cheddar cheese and cilantro. Thank you!

Excellent recipe.  Even my husband loved it.  I followed the recipe except used mexican corn instead of hominy and used 2 cups of water.  This will be a regular in our house.

To all who are concerned about the sodium content,  use homemade no salt taco seasoning, low sodium black beans rinced, low sodium tomatoes, and no salt. Buy low sodiun veggies and if you can't find any (Walmart sells a lot of low sodium veggies) rince them, that will lower the sodium content.

The first time I made this it just seemed like chili. I made quite a few changes the second time around based on some reviews from here and my own ideas - admittedly, after my changes it's basically an entirely different recipe but wanted to share anyway: I omitted the kidney and lima beans and used black beans and corn instead. I also added one fresh chopped jalapeno and 3/4 of a can of Rotel diced tomatoes with green chiles in addition to the 4-oz can of green chiles. Lastly I added 3/4 of a block of Velveeta (pre-softened/melted in the microwave). The Velveeta made it a lot creamier and DELICIOUS! I actually forgot to add the salt, but I'm glad I did as the taco seasoning and Velveeta were salty enough. Topped with sour cream and Fritos...AMAZING!!!

If you use lean ground chuck and actual seasonings such a cumin and cilantro and a can of rotel tomatoes and chilies, there is a lot less fat and sodium.  Also use a bag of frozen mixed mexican vegetables and it is much healthier

REALLY GOOD!!!! Put it in the crockpot on high, till it started boiling. Then turned it down on low to simmer. Served it over corn chips, topped it with cheddar cheese and fat free sour cream.  Delicious comfort food at its best!!!!!!

I only used one pound of ground beef and a small can of lima beans.  And as I was making this soup, I was a bit put off by the hominy, lima beans, and the ranch packet.  I mean, it's taco soup! It just seemed like weird ingredients to add! But, it was AWESOME!  Served it with crushed tortilla chips and cheese.  LOVED it!  I will definitely make this again.

The reason i am giving this 4 stars and not 5 is because it really is more of a chilli but the flavour is wonderful. We will make this again. Thanks.

Excellent.  I left out the salt and pepper and it was plenty seasoned.  It made about 8 servings.  I used spicy taco seasoning and it was perfect for our spicy taste.  I topped it with cheddar cheese.

I used black & cannelli beans, and canned corn. The taco seasoning I used made the soup more spicy, so I'll try a different kind, or less of it. I crumbled t. chips over it, with a nice dollop of sour cream. Husband LOVED it, and it warmed me up.

This has become a favorite in my family since we first made it.  There are easy ways to make it a little more 'lean' as well (ground turkey, for an example), and it's delicious either way.

Very good this way, even better with additional can of tomatoes, beef broth instead of just water, and I have changed up the beans to whatever is on hand. Corn can be used if you have no hominy. 2 pound of ground beef is too much, can get by with only 1 pound.  Makes a thick soup - add more beef broth for consistency of choice.

This was a really great recipe and was easy to make. I didn't add all the beans, just one can each of kidney and black beans, used corn instead of hominy and that was really good. I added one can of Enchilada sauce to moisten the recipe and make more soupy. Next time I'll leave out the chilis just for personal preference.  I liked the unique flavor combo of the taco seasoning and ranch seasoning, it provided a nice balance. I topped the soup off with Frito chips and shredded cheese. Will make again.

This was super simple and delicious!  I used black beans instead of the lima and pinto beans just because that's what I had on hand and used diced tomatoes instead of stewed tomatoes.  I also used the homemade Taco Seasoning I on this site and served it with cornbread.  I added about a cup of extra water so it wasn't quite as thick.  We loved it and will make it again!

AMAZING!  I was skeptical about the lima beans and hominy in this recipe but they are a keeper! I have never been a huge fan of either... but, they go great in this. The flavor is wonderful! This will be a staple in our family from now on!!

As this was cooking, I thought that it smelled like it might taste bland . . . HOW WRONG I WAS!  This is delicious made exactly as described in the recipe.  I make my own dry ranch dressing mix and used 3 tablespoons of that for the package that it called for.  It was fantastic!!  I will be making this one again!!!

This soup was a big hit for my whole family.  It is very unusual for any recipe to please everyone at my table, so I'll definitely make this again.  I substituted corn for hominy and black beans for lima beans, and it was very tasty.

i had to add in 4 cups of water total not 1 1/2 and i kept the extra salt out on the next batch and used low sodium taco mix... the original is very salty and almost like thick chili...my spoon stood up straight. once i changed some things very good and easy. i let cook on high for at least 2 hrs. my 7 yr old loves it too. requested it agian tonight! oh.. i also added in bell pepper and sub'd the hominy for corn.

Never lima beans or hominy.  Use kidney beans and pintos, and some corn.

This is delicious! I use Rotel stewed tomatoes with chiles to give it more zip and add a little sour cream on top with the cheese.

This is a quick and easy recipe.  I used ground chicken and swapped out the hominy for corn and it was still delicious.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!  It is perfect for the cooler winter and after watching Sunday football.

I wanted a quick meal to use up a pound of ground beef. I had nearly everything I needed to make this one, so I gave it a shot. I was missing pinto beans and stewed tomatoes. What I did was mixed the chilis, pepper, limas, *crushed* tomatoes, hominy and seasoning packets in a bowl. Since I only had a single pound of ground beef, I pulled half of this mixture out to freeze. Now, I can make this recipe a second time even easier! Then, I added a full can of kidney beans and proceeded with the recipe as directed. I'm glad I skipped the salt, I think it might have been a bit much with the taco seasoning. This was VERY good! It tastes like it took all day!

This soup tastes great!  One of the best parts is that it is so simple to put together and most of the ingredents are already in my pantry.  I only made one change, and used Mexi-Corn instead of homony; taste preferance.  This makes enough to freeze the leftovers, a bonus, cook once, eat twice.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was so easy to make.  I used only 1 pound of hamburger and kept all other measurements the same.  I used frozen corn instead of hominy.  I thought the ranch packet sounded strange but dumped it in and it was delicious.  I ladled the soup on top of corn chips and then topped with green onion, cheddar cheese, sour cream and cilantro.

Quick and easy.  I do not drain my beans, the juice makes the soup more savory.  I have also left out the meat to save on fat and calories and you don't miss it.

Easy and so good! I used ground turkey. I added corn.  Left out the salt.  I used Rotel instead of canned stewed tomatoes and diced green chilies. I did not use hominy or lima beans. I added more water due to saltiness. I topped bowl with shredded cheese and sour cream.  And lastly, added broken pieces of tortilla chips.  Delicious!

This was so amazing! I browned the beef and the onions as instructed, but I let the soup simmer in the slow cooker for a few hours on low just for my own convenience. It was too delicious for my waistline!

This is an excellent recipe, but with changes. I followed the advice of several people and tried to go as natural as possible. I added a finely chopped stalk of celery, a fresh finely chopped jalapeno pepper, changed the water to low salt chicken broth, and used corn instead of hominy. I omitted the lima beans as I do not like the flavor of canned  limas. I did add the ranch dressing mix and made my own chili taco seasoning. I did add the pinto and chili beans, the stewed tomatoes, Mexican style and did chop an onion. I did not need to add all the 1 tsp of salt, so if you make the soup, wait until you have mixed everything together to determine how much salt you need. I also added about a half cup of Mexican beer to add more liquid and more depth of flavor to the soup. I covered the pot so the liquid would remain and the soup would resemble soup and not chili.  Love this recipe and will be making it again!

I used a can of black beans instead of lima beans and added 2 additional cans of stewed tomatoes. I like my soup a little more "soupy" than this originally turned out.  Other than that it was incredible! Definitely going in my recipe box

My husband and I really like this soup.  I chose this recipe because I thought it would work well with turkey burger. I use 2 Tbsp of Taco Seasoning I from this site instead of pkg mix and it turns out very spicy.  I've never made this with beef, but I bet it would be out of this world delicious!

I made a few changes to suit my husbands taste.  He really only likes black beans, so I used 1 can of corn, 1 can of hominy and two cans of black beans instead of all the other beans.  I used no salt added corn and beans and omitted the salt since other reviews said it came out salty.  I also used cooked & diced chicken breast instead of ground beef to make it lower in fat.  It was delish!  I only gave four stars due to all my changes.

3 stars for EASY -- but didn't produce the flavor that the title would imply...Not a bad combination of ingredients, just NOT very taco-flavored, and I even added more cumin, mexican oregano, etc.  I think the ranch dressing mix toned down the taco taste and added a LOT of sodium this could really do without.  Thanks anyway!

My family loves this soup. I always  leave out the lima beans and hominy and I add frozen corn. It is so DARN GOOD! I always double the recipe and I make this about once a month now. Everyone at worked asked for the recipe. If you want a bigger kick to it you can add the hot taco seasoning, I always use the regular or mild. DELICIOUS!

great comfort food. I added corn and I also did not drain the beans. I used kidney beans only since that is the kind my kids like the best.  I chopped up corn tortilla's into "noodles" and added them 5 min before we ate dinner.. YUM O

Tasty as is and easy to modify. I've made this recipe or a variation thereof several times, both on the stove and in a slow cooker (about 4-5 hrs on low to let the flavors meld). Its really inexpensive, especially when I cut the meat in half, which makes it the best for feeding a lot of people, and it's great for a come-home-to lunch with friends on Sunday after Church.

My family really enjoyed this recipe.  I did get a strange look when I said it was "Taco Soup".  But they said that it is a definite "yes" to cook again.

This was absolutely delicious. I used chili powder, cayenne pepper and hot Hungarian paprika in place of the taco seasoning. Also, to make it vegetarian I used tofu instead of beef.  The tofu soaked up all of the flavors in the soup and tasted great!

Very, Very good.  I used chicken instead of beef but did everything the same...added more cumin though and more heat.  Hearty and healthy and yummy,..UPDATE: used ground beef the second time around and YUMMO.  I also added a 6 oz. can of tomato paste and more water.  It is SO good with crushed corn chips and cheese.

Awesome, wonderful, exceptional, the best! I used butter beans instead of lima beans, and corn instead of hominy.  I topped with sour cream and cilantro. This is very easy and inexpensive to make, but the outcome is very special.

We loved this soup.  I was a little worried that the green chiles might make it too spicy for me but it really wasn't spice at all.  I did use half the ground beef, as we are trying to cut down on red meat and added more water, and it was still so good.  Thank you for this quick, easy recipe.

I love this soup!! I omitted the hominy and doubled the corn. I have also used the mexicorn which is great too.The last time I used Turkey meat and it tasted the same. My husband loves this soup, and it can really feed quite a few people. The leftovers are the best though so be sure to make extra. I always serve with tortilla chips, monterey jack cheese, sour cream, avocado and cilantro...

Really good, incredibly easy - very similar to chili beans, but extra delicious. The combination of the different beans along with the hominy is excellent. Only recipe change: My market had only southern-style seasoned lima beans, and it still came out great.

I added 1/2 the chiles because we are wussys and can't take the hot stuff. I also didn't add all those beans just a can of hominy & pintos, no ranch package either. Great recipe. This ones a keeper!

My teenagers made this for dinner one night last week, and we all enjoyed it. They made a couple of changes: rather than the green chiles and the stewed tomatoes, they used Rotel tomatoes, and they subbed black beans for the lima beans. They served avocado, sour cream, jack cheese and tortilla chips on the side. This was a quick, easy dinner, and perfect for teens learning to cook.

This was really good. I used 2 14.5 oz cans of low sodium chicken broth instead of water and low sodium taco seasoning. I added corn and used a rotisserie chicken instead of beef. Yummy.

I tried the recipe with all of the same seasonings, but left out the hominy and replaced the lima beans with pinto. I thought it tasted good, but I didn't notice a big difference from chili recipes.

This is one of my favorite recipes.  I do it with turkey for a lighter meal.  If you do only half a cup of water it makes a great taco filing or nacho topping too!

This was really a a good dish! It was kind of mild and could of been spiced up with a few jalapinoes, but I have to give it 3 & 1/2 stars. This is a keeper and can be modified to become a family fave.  I put some bacon and a dolop of sour cream on top to give it some jazz.  The girls at work loved the left overs the next day.

This soup is awesome! I made it for the first time yesterday and even my onion and bean hating 10 year old LOVED it! The only change I made to the recipe was to leave out the lima beans. I will most definitely be making this again very soon.

It doesn't look like  the  picture so I added a large can of spicy V-8 juice and now it looks more like tortilla soup.  First  attempt but I'm sure I'll try it again.  Definitely needs more tomato like liquid.

Not bad. I had some extra green peppers I needed to use so I threw them in there too and it turned out pretty good. I am not a huge taco fan but I still liked it. I added an extra envelope of taco seasoning mix because my husband like more intense flavors, and this was a little to bland for him. He also added hot sauce to his bowl(s) and raved about it. Thought I thought it was good I felt like it was missing something....

I didn't have green chiles so I used two 10 oz cans of Rotel diced tomatoes with green chiles otherwise I stuck to the recipe. The only objection that I had is that a full package of taco seasoning creates to much spice for the kiddies. Great reciped, however.

My family and I love Taco Soup. I use northern beans instead of lima beans and corn instead of hominy. We pour the soup over corn chips or cornbread.. Either way=YUMMY!!!

My  daughter, her friends and my husband all loved this.  Substituted corn for hominy and black beans for limas (due to personal tastes of those I was making it for).    Will definitely make again.   Good with chicken in place of ground beef also.

This soup is great I added a little more water as it was a little thick for me, also added more taco mix I like a little more spice. I did not use the lima beans and subed black beans "WOW" this was great.

I gave it 5 stars because I actually ate the leftovers for 2 days after! That's saying a lot for me, because I hate leftovers! My 5 yr old said it's the best soup I've ever made. I did make some changes based on what I had on hand. I used small red beans, black beans, and cream of corn in place of the pinto, lima and kidney beans. I didn't have hominy plus I don't care for it. We topped it with baked corn tortilla strips, sour cream, cheese and cilantro. I also used home grown stewed tomatoes. It was so good and filling. I think it's the ranch that sets it apart just enough from the other recipes I've made. I'm making a quadruple batch tomorrow!

LOVE THIS!!!  Have made it a few times now and it never last long in our home. I substituted Black Beans for the Lima Beans and Corn for the hominy.  I think the Ranch dressing is the definite secret ingredient here and add a dollop of sour cream, shredded cheddar/monteray jacka nd some nacho chips and voila you have a wonderful meal for the family!

This was so simple and GOOD!  I only used half the ground beef, but threw in a can of black beans along with the others.  I also used corn instead of hominy simply because I couldn't find any.  I put in 3 cups of water and could easily have done 4 or 5 - was more of a chili consistency.  Overall the flavor was great and I will definitely make this one again, may even try chicken next time.

This soup is delicious with cheese, sour cream, and chips on top.  However, it needs more liquid; extra water improved it a lot.

This is my first time to make Taco Soup of any kind.  I am amazed at how easy it is to make in relation to how delicious it is.  OMG!  This is going in the regular rotation.  I did make a couple of changes...I don't like lima beans so I replaced them with whole kernel corn, I also added quite a bit more water just to make it really soupy so it would soak into my cornbread.  YUM!  Thanks Julie!

This is great minus one thing, it's not much like soup, more like chili - as others said. I added 2 cups of water instead as well as substituting corn for the hominy and topped it with sour cream as well as cheese. I will make this again for sure.

This was SO good. Like a lot of other people, I added more water and did not add the lima beans. I REALLY did not like the beef in this because even though it was a sort of "chili" it was more of a soup still so next time if I add any meat at all I will add some shredded chicken. The seasonings were perfect and it was so delicious!

The ranch mix gives this taco soup a off taste. There is another taco soup on here that is great and almost like this recipe.

Based on other peoples comments about it being more like a chili, I changed it up a bit seeing as I didn't want chili. Instead of draining the liquids out of the beans and such, I added the liquid to it. The liquid added so much flavor to the soup. But it would def. work great as a chili or a soup. Just remember, you can always be creative with what your cooking and you don't have to follow the recipe exactly!

Yum! I made this for a Bunco night and it was a big hit. I actually used Boca crumbles instead of ground beef and nobody noticed! When I revealed my secret, most were pleasantly surprised. I forgot to add the fresh cilantro to this in all of the Bunco chaos. Will definitely make again.

Long time favorite of mine; I make it every year when it starts to get a nip in the air.  It's also similar to a recipe shared at a weight loss meeting - full of good fiber!  Enjoy. :-)

My husband can't get enough of this stuff!  I also substituted corn for the hominy and used black beans in place of lima beans (just what I had on hand).  I used the prescribed amount of water and thought it was still a bit thick but didn't want to water it down too much.  I threw in two small cans of tomato juice to thin and it worked perfectly.

I think I would call this "Southwestern Chili" instead of Taco Soup, but regardless, it's got a nice flavor. 

I did alter the recipe (and I hate when people rate altered recipes!) but thought I'd chime in.

I used canned corn instead of hominy, left out the ranch packet, used 1lb. of ground turkey, one can each of black beans and pinto beans, and a can of southwest chopped tomatoes because I don't like stewed tomatoes. 

It is definitely more than 6 servings! And very thick. I added a bit more water but then the flavor was too tame - I might add another seasoning packet. 

It's pretty healthy and full of fiber, so that's nice, but it wasn't really what I expected. I'm not sure if I'd make it again or not.

Love it!  So easy to make. Kids like it too!  I did take some of the suggestions from other reviewers, used frozen corn instead of hominy just because I didn't have any and used 2 cans of pinto beans.  I was skeptical of the ranch seasoning package, but did it anyway and it turned out great!  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good & easy!!!  I did use a can of Mexicorn instead of hominy and otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Very good to add sour cream, cheese, & tostito chips to as well when serving.  I love hot stuff so I added some hot sauce to mine & loved the extra kick.

Love this recipe! I recently made a pot during one of our Colorado cyclone blizzard's and thank goodness I had this because we ended up hosting other family who had lost power at their place. I was so happy to be able to feed everyone. I never add the lima beans to mine, but I don't skimp on anything else, and it turns out amazing every time. I highly recommend. I serve with sliced avocado, corn tortilla chips, fresh cilantro, and sour cream on top.  Sometimes I will cut up a lime and add a little lime wedge  to my bowl. Thanks for sharing Julie!

A rainy, cold night in Atlanta required a hearty soup for dinner! I've made a vegetarian variation of this before but never used ground beef.  This definitely added some depth. and flavor.  

Instead of hominy, I used a can of corn,....no lima beans, subbed chili beans, a bit of cumin and didn't  add in the can of kidney beans.  Served with sliced avocado, crushed pumpkin seed tortilla chips and shredded cheddar cheese.  Delicious!  

The only downside is the browning of the beef and draining all that awful grease off and then blotting the beef to get rid of the fat.  Doing this is not an option for us, it's mandatory.  We can't and won't eliminate this step but it doesn't make for quick and easy prep! Always worth the effort when serving anything with ground beef as an ingredient, though.

Just amazing!  My husband came home with a different bean accidentally so I used cannellini instead of Lima and no complaints here.  3/4 of my kids tasted it and were in love.  My new favorite recipe!

This is a great recipe in the crock pot.  I've never added hominy or ranch seasoning too it though.

This is really good! It has a lot of sodium so I omitted the salt and all beans were no salt added and I rinsed them. It was not missed. It was perfect. I added 3 minced garlic cloves to the beef. Then put everything in the crockpot on low for 6 hours.This is great when you want a thick soup but are tired of chili.

Wow. The whole family loved this. Only change I made was the lima beans (I'm the only one who likes them), I added more red kidney beans.

My husband called this taco chili and loved it.  I replaced hominy with corn and lima beans with great northerns--cause that's what I had on hand.  Then I added a can of tomato sauce.  I also didn't add the salt and still found it salty.  The second day the salt level seemed good. Already made it again for a group.

I really enjoyed this recipe as well did my husband.  I added a little bit of chili powder and 2 cloves of garlic to add a little bit of flavor to it.  I also took out the hominy and added a can of white kidney beans.  To eliminate some calories, I didn't add the cheese, and I thought it was very tasty without.  Very easy to make for sure.

This recipe was a hit with my family. I added another can of kidney beans in place of the lima beans and corn in place of the hominy and added a small can of sliced black olives. And it was Amazing! I will be making this again its perfect on the cold winter night.

This is SOoooo yummy AND easy.   Next time I will try changing it up with diced chicken, chicken broth, diced potatoes and chunks of Avocado to garnish.   A great basic recipe that can be easily modified.  A dollop of sour cream OR plain greek yogurt to gild the lilly  : )

I absolutely love taco soup and this recipe just makes my old recipe taste 100% better. I didn't have Lima beans or pinto beans so I used kidney and black beans. I usually ground the beef and onion in a non stick skillet and while that is cooking, I combine the rest of the ingredients in a 5 qt. pot (I double the recipe). When the beef is done, I add it to the bean mixture and let it simmer 35-40 minutes. That's just how and do it and my parents (and sibilings) love it. We ALWAYS top it with sour cream, cheddar cheese, and tortilla chips.
Thanks for the wonderful recipe, Julie

It tasted great. I only used 1 1/2 lbs hamburger and I used northern beans and pintos. I used Mexican corn also.

I thought the soup had too much stuff and not enough brothiness.  I added stock and used ground turkey cause I don't eat beef.  The spice needed a kick up too.  I added Mexican chili powder and some extra heat to make it more taco tasting.  It was too bland...

I made quite a few changes because I recently went vegetarian. I used the meatball recipe from I think it was Vegetarian Sweet and Sour Meatballs and replaced the beef. It turned out beautiful even my omnivorous family was surprised!

This has really good flavor. I found that the recipe as written doesn't produce much of a broth. I added a second can of tomatoes and used about 2 1/4 c. water and it still came out more like a chili than a soup. However, it is easy, hearty and delicious. I was attracted to this recipe because of the unusual bean and hominy mixture. While I put all the ingredients in as written, it is the kind of recipe that you can easily modify it based upon what you like and what is on hand. Some other reviewers have mentioned the salt content and it's true that if you are on a low sodium diet this is not for you.

WAY too much salt, almost to the point of being inedible.  Wish I would have read the other reviews that said that before I made it.  Only changes I made were to add some Cumin and lime juice, corn instead of hominy, and black beans in place of the limas ( I don't like them). I tried to add some sour cream to tone down the saltiness,  but it didn't help much. If there is a next time, I'll leave out the extra salt altogether.

We LOVED it!  With the taco and ranch seasoning packages, it doesn't need more salt - plus I added 5 beef bouillon cubes for extra flavor.  Will take this to work next time there's a pot luck.

I thought it was good,  but I had to add 5 cups of water,  not the 1 1/2 that the recipe called for. Plus I added about half tsp of cayenne pepper to give it more kick. My husband loved it!

Really good and filling - because I am not a huge fan of onions I substituted instant beef onion soup mix for the onion and it came out well - I used Colby-Jack cheese and it went very well with it.

Made this soup for the family yesterday and it was a big hit!  I browned the beef and onions then threw everything else together in the crockpot so it was all ready when everyone got home.  Agreed with another reviewer that it was a little low on liquid so doubled water and added some taco seasoning.  Sliced avocado on top just made it that much better.  Thank you for the recipe.  This is a keeper!

good base, easily customizable with what you want. subbed in corn for the kidney beans, added a total of 3 cups of water, as it didn't have much liquid to it. added fresh cilantro. could have added more taco seasoning, next time. thanks for a good recipe.

This is an easy and delicious recipe. You can really add anything you want to make it your own. I added cilatro, green onions, and black olives. I also substituted the lima beans for black beans and the hominy for sweet corn. Use hot and spicy taco seasoning mix to give it just a little kick! Yum!

Great recipe. I took the advise and added the corn and deleted the hominy beans. I sauteed the onions before putting them in the stew, because my kids hate them. I only used about a quarter of the onion. My kids never noticed they were in there. Followed the recipe and directions to the tee otherwise. Quick, easy, and taste great!

I spiced this up for my husband (added jalepenos and jalepeno powder) and kept it more mild for me.  We both loved it! I used a chipotle taco seasoning, which was very tasty.  Also, I used only 1.3 pounds of ground turkey, and omitted the lima beans.  There didn't seem to be much broth even after those omissions, so I think leaving out one can of the beans was a good choice.  I'm making it again tonight.  YUM!

Rated 4 stars because the recipe need MUCH more water (at least 3 cups) to reduce thickness, and it was still very hearty.  I also added a small can of tomato paste, but I think I may add even more stewed tomatoes.
Very tasty, I used shredded cheese and Baked Doritos as a topping.  Had enough for 2 meals, 2 lunches and lots to give to a neighbor.

made it without the meat and added in some garlic with the onion.  i also used a mix of garbanzo beans, black beans, hominy, and pintos, instead of following the recipe directly. and i added more water. yum! hearty and good for you!

This taco soup variation is one of my favorites.  It's just so easy and so good, and is great leftover or even reheated after being frozen.  Works well in the crock pot too, and is a favorite at office pot lucks.

my husband loved this recipe. to make it even better, he said to add another can of stewed tomatoes. i didn't need to add the extra salt. it was just fine without it. i will definitely share this recipe with family and friends!

This is a wonderful taco soup recipe! In place of the lima beans, I add another can of beans. Also, instead of hominy, I use a can of corn.

I too substituted corn for hominy and black beans for lima beans.  It was GREAT!  A filling soup that tastes great with cheese and chips.  This is another All Recipes keeper.

I made this last night with lb of ground turkey, black beans instead of lima, and mexicorn instead of hominy. My 3 year old gobbled it down. It was so good! I put in the crockpot all day and it worked perfectly! I bet it would be really good with some cornbread on top of it!

Loved it!  I used diced jalapenos, added a good amount of fresh cilantro and served with cheese, chips and sour cream.  Will make this a regular at our house. Thanks!

I've made this several times but just realized I never reviewed.  I make it differently every time according to what I have on hand.  I usually only use 1 pound of ground meat as I think it's plenty.  I also only use 1 can of beans, whatever kind happens to be in the pantry.  I do not add extra salt as there is plenty between the ranch packet and taco packet.  I add sour cream and cheese when serving.  Perfect cold rainy day meal!
