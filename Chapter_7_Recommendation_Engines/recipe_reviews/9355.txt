Pan size was not accurate.  Cheesecake was 1 to 1 1/2 inches above pan.  Cooking time needed to be increased, but had to cover cheesecake to prevent to much browning.  Lady Finger were impossible to find and those made at home are not consistent enough in size to make this recipe.  Save yourself the trouble and just put in a graham cracker crust if a gourmet bakery is not in your area!

I made the cheese cake, looks great.  The only problem was it called for 1 3oz pkg of ladyfingers, no way you need at least 2 to cover/place around pan.

So decadent! Not just for Christmas. I've made it three times now for special occasions because my family keeps asking for it.  Instead of Lady Fingers for the crust, I used Keebler Graham Cracker Crumbs mixed with a stick of melted butter and two tbsp of sugar. I set my spring form pan in a shallow pan of water to bake.  Topped with a chilled can of cherry pie filling in winter but in the spring topped with fresh strawberry topping:  1 qt fresh strawberries washed and hulled. Puree half of the berries in food processer with one cup sugar then stir in the other half and chill.  This is a keeper. Thank you so much for this recipe.

This was great - very high, light and fluffy for a cheesecake. It also looks so pretty. You need 2 packages of the 3oz lady fingers rather than one but other than that, no changes.  Maybe it was because I made it at Christmas time, but all of the grocery stores had lady fingers in the bakery section, so I had no problem finding them.

I made this dessert for Christmas dinner and it was a huge hit. I used a 9 inch spring form pan and it worked perfectly. I found lady fingers in the bakery department at Walmart and Safeway. Both places said they carry them year round, which is perfect as I will be making this regularly. For the people that said they had to cook it for 90 minutes, you needed to take it out at 55-60 minutes. The center will seem uncooked but it will set up after you remove it from the oven (in 30-60 minutes). I loved loved this recipe and will put it on my favorites list! Definitely not just for Christmas!

The recipe for this cheesecake turned out great. My son and I could not find Ladyfingers at the local store so we substituted giant soft chocolate fudge cookies which turned out very good. Other than that we used everything else in the recipe exactly the same. Will definately do again!

Outstanding!  Increase your lady fingers to two 3 oz. packages, or use vanilla wafers for the bottom crust.  Everything else was perfect.  Easy to make, but be sure to keep an eye on it when you get to 50 minutes. Mine firmed up at about the 55 minute mark. Enjoy; my family raved.

DO NOT MAKE THIS!! IT WAS A DISASTER!! THE LADYFINGERS BURNT ON THE BOTTOM AND BURNT EVEN WITH THE FOIL ON AND IT TOOK 90 MINS TO BAKE. IT ALSO DID NOT NEED AS MUCH SOUR CREAM AS IT CALLED FOR. JUST MAKE A GRAHAM CRACKER CRUST AND FOLLOW THE PHILADELPHIA CREAM CHEESE RECIPE ON THE WEBSITE. NO STARS FOR THIS ONE!!!!!!

The cooking time was about 90 minutes at the temperature of 375 degrees. The ladyfingers were too hard and dry by the time the cake was finished.   The cheese cake ingredients however were perfect. Everybody loved it.   If the cooking time and pan size are adjusted, this recipe would be perfect.  Three Stars
