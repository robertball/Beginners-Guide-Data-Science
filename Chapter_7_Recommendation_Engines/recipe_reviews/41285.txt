What great fried chicken.. I did modify it a bit.. I soaked the chicken in buttermilk for 6hrs, and added 1/2 cup cornstarch to the flour mixture.. the cornstarch keeps it crispy.. and after frying the chicken only until it was brown,but not fully cooked did I drain the chicken on a rack until all the chicken was done, then put it in the oven with the rack on top of a cookie sheet covered with foil.. baked it for 45 min.. the chicken was so tender and crispy.. even crispy warming it in the oven the next day and cleanup was easy.. everyone said it was the best fried chicken they had ever eaten...

I made this tonight and it was so delicious.  I never made fried chicken so good and the gravy was so yummy.  I just kept dipping it into the gravy.  We had mashed potatoes with gravy and corn for sides.  DELICIOUS!

Made my first batch of fried chicken and it was a big hit with my children. They loved it. My husband called it a 5 star dinner! I have never made fried chicken in my life and it was easy and delicious! I will definitely make this one again. I didn't make the gravy, but would like to try it sometime as well. I added 1 tsp of garlic powder to the flour mixture and it made it extra good! YUMMY!

Wow...now if we just added some mashed potatoes, green beans and corn on the cob, we'll have ourselves are real "southern" meal. I subscribe to TOH and they have some wonderful recipes.  I would definitely let my chicken soak in buttermilk overnight, but one hour is certainly ok.  Comfort food at it's finest.  Way to go TOH!!

I make this all the time...pure soul food.  I do it a little differently.  I add my own mixture of spices to the buttermilk and let it sit overnight.  Usually use things like garlic powder, paprika, cayene, oregano, salt, and pepper.  I do change it up, do what you like.  Then I add some of the same spices to the flour when dredging it.  It is really good stuff. I  gave 4 star rating because you really need to spice it up a bit otherwise you get a very bland flavor.  Thanks for the post.

Absolutely the most incredible fried chicken ever! I made it for a couple of friends (husband and wife). She ate until she could barely move, and he said that it was the best piece of chicken he'd ever had....even better than his wife's! Oops! Take my advice and try this recipe, it's excellent!

This is the first time I've made fried chicken, and I thought it turned out pretty well.  I put paprika and garlic powder in the floor along with the salt and pepper, like someone else suggested, but I think maybe it would have been good to put in even more!  I also used chicken tenderloins instead of other chicken parts.  It took longer to cook than I thought it would and it didn't really look like the picture, but it was still quite pretty.  Also, the gravy tasted sort of sweet for some reason!  Oh yeah, I didn't have any buttermilk so I made one cup of buttermilk from one cup normal milk mixed with one tablespoon lemon juice (you can also use vinegar) then let it sit out for about 15 minutes.  I'm including this information because I had a hard time finding the formula for it online!

There couldn't be a better fried chicken. Very down-home, the kind of thing I love to give my kids. This dish can earn you raves! Make plenty of gravy and potatoes...you'll be glad you took the time.

This was very good.  I might have cooked my chicken a little too long though.  I substituted milk for the water called for in the gravy to make it a little richer.

Personally, this dish didn't thrill me much.  I marinated in the buttermilk for about 2 hours; added about 1/3 cup of cornmeal as per another reviewer; but still found the coating falling off while frying plus it really should have been seasoned more.  I didn't make the gravy as we weren't having mashed or any kind of potatoes, which I'm kind of glad as it was just too much work for the results.  However, hubby said he thought it was alright.  I don't think I'll be making this again.

This indeed is a delicious fried chicken recipe, I did add 1/4 tsp of lemon pepper for an extra zing, a dash of paprika, 1/4 tsp of seasoned salt, and a dash of garlic powder.  My fiance loved it!! Thanks for recipe.

This is the way I have been making fried chicken for a long time.  I add 1 TBSP of Tabasco Sauce to the buttermilk and put the chicken and buttermilk mixture in a freezer bag in the fridge.  That makes turning the chicken easy.

I thought this was a very good ~basic~ recipe for fried chicken.  I soaked my chicken in the buttermilk (and I used enough to almost cover the chicken in a ziploc container, turned twice during soak) for 24 hours before shaking in paper bag (lunch size is perfect).  I added LOTS of garlic powder, salt, pepper, paprika, a little cayenne powder and thyme to my flour.  After all the chicken was coated, I reserved the buttermilk that it had soaked in and used that for the milk called for in the gravy recipe.  I fried my chicken in melted Crisco until it was dark golden, drained it on paper towels, and then finished cooking in the oven at 350 for 35 to 40 minutes (juices MUST be clear!).  Finishing it off in the oven also helped drain the rest of the grease from frying.
For the gravy, I didn't use any water.  What buttermilk I was short (for the 2 1/2 cups of liquid) I just added some whole milk.  As it thickened up, I added a bit of salt and pepper.  Make sure that you heat the buttermilk to boiling if it was used to soak the chicken, it has to get hot enough to kill any bacteria left from the chicken juices.  I thought that the gravy tasted better, and a bit tangier, when I used at least some buttermilk in place of all milk.  I've made this recipe about 3 times, it's fairly easy and takes only minor ahead-of-time preparations.  When finishing it off in the oven, it does take about an hour and a half cook time.

This was not good at all.  It was very bland and instead of making the skin nice and crunch, it was hard as rock.  My sisters had to remove the skin and eat the meat plain because it was just too hard.  I did dredge the chicken twice in the flour, maybe that's what did it, but even with a nice crunchy skin, it still wouldn't have been that great.  Just too plain for our liking.  Won't be making again.

Pretty good. Could've marinated it longer. Make sure to season your buttermilk and flour- I used Emeril's Essence. Serve with biscuits

Really wanted to give this recipe a try since I hadn't used this method before and was curious.  I put a spice rub on the chicken and let soak in the buttermilk for 24 hours, and seasoned the breading with herbs and spices.  I think it is key is to not use too much oil.  This is pan frying, not deep frying.  Depending on the size of the pieces of chicken, 40 minutes may be too much.  About 30 worked for me, once all were browned.  Did cook the light and dark meats separately, since dark will usually take longer to cook.  The crust was slightly soft after taking the lid off, so flipped the chicken and fried it for a few more minutes to crispy back up.  Overall, the chicken was good, but I do feel it's a little more greasy than plain deep fried or the fry then oven methods.  If I only had a little oil and didn't want to use the oven, I may use this method again.
Was a little concerned about the flavor of the gravy from the oil, so poured out the oil and added a Tbsp of butter, using flour from the breading.  Substituted a can of evaporated milk for plain and adjusted the water to 1C.  The gravy was a little flat and would probably taste better with chicken broth instead of water and more seasoning.

This is the best fried chicken I have ever made!!  I marinated the chicken all day and added garlic powder and a bit of poultry seasoning to the gravy.  The only other suggestion I have is that you put your chicken on a cookie cooling rack before putting it in the oven that way the bottom does not get soggy or greasy while the other chicken is cooking. AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME!!!

This was good, but there wasn't enough of the crunchy coating for my taste.

The buttermilk makes the chicken so tender, a must try recipe.

This is the best fried chicken I have ever had. My hubby LOVES it! There are a few changes I made that you might want to hear!  I soaked the chicken overnight, and added salt, pepper and paprika to the bag- I made it a few times, and one of those times I was in a rush and soaked for only an hour, and soaking overnight makes SUCH A HUGE DIFFERENCE in the flavor! You’ll see!  I added paprika to the flour mixture as well- you can’t have fried chicken without paprika. I didn’t cover it- I didn’t want it mushy. I cooked it, uncovered, low heat, nice and slowly so it wouldn’t cook the outside too fast.  The secret to any great sauce/gravy: flour and butter.  Here’s what you do:  First, you need to add your flour to some SOFTENED butter- can’t be melted.  You want it really thick? Just add more flour. Stir that until it is very smooth. Set aside. Add the milk and broth (I used chicken broth instead of water- more flavor) to the drippings. Heat that up, and then add the butter/flour mixture. Stir until thick. Add salt pepper and garlic powder. There will be NO clumps- BEST GRAVY EVER! And you can use that for ANY sauce or gravy you want thickened! Enjoy!

The gravy wasn't very Flavorful and my chicken was a little soggy, I may have cooked in wrong though, it was my first stab at fried chicken. I think it would have been better if it is browned in the pan then placed in the oven to finish cooking.

granted, this was my first fried chicken attempt, but I was disappointed w/ the results.  edible, but the skin was tough.  yes, i cooked it on medium to make sure it wouldn't overcook outside.  still looking for a fried chx recipe.

It was ok, but nothing extraordinary. Though my boyfriend said it was one of the best chicken dishes i'd ever maid, I didnt like it at all. Especially the gravy.

I made this for dinner the other night, but didn't have the wax paper to lay it on. I used tin foil instead. Followed the direction's and the meal and the gravy was delicous. I would have like the chicken crust a little bit crisper all around the chicken. I don't know not having the waxpaper made the difference or not. I will be adding this dish to our monthly menu's it was so good. I served it with mashed potatoes and everyone wanted extra gravy for the potatoes. Wonderful recipes a real keeper.

This was a great recipe!!  My husband and kids really enjoyed the chicken.  I added a little bit of paprika and garlic powder to the flour but even without it, it would have been great. Thanks!!

Chicken came out great, but the gravy...that's a whole other story. I diluted a bullion cube, chicken flavored, with a little bit of water.  I added the water to the flour gravy mixture, and voila--it was delicious! Add some thyme, black pepper and onion powder, made this a delicious gravy!

thought I followed the directions but the chicken did not turn out as I desire fried chicken to taste.  I believe it needs to be deep fried to really come out better.  This was my third attempt at making fried chicken and from now on I will visit Hardee's or KFC if I want chicken!  I just can't do it right :P

I thought this was an average chicken recipe.  I followed the suggestions of others by adding extra seasonings to the mix (which was definitely needed).  I also cut the water for the gravy down to 1 cup using the remaining 1/2 cup with buttermilk.  Boyfriend thought the chicken was good, and the gravy just okay.  I thought the gravy was good and the chicken just okay, so we weren't extremely impressed with the final outcome.

I changed this recipe before I made it. The lack of seasoning bothered me. The chicken can do with liberal use of thyme or similar, and needs perhaps help from a good seasoning salt instead of ordinary salt. The recipe for the gravy also bothers me a bit: I'll add Kikkoman soy sauce and maybe a good dash of Worcestershire sauce. Also, I'd prefer to oven-bake it.

Wow! Comfort food at it's finest. I reminded me of my Mom's fried chicken. I loved it. I let it marinate overnight. I will definately do this one again.
