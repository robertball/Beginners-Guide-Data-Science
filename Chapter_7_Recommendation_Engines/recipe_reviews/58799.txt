Unfortunately I have no way to edit the recipe (even though I submitted it).  I realize this recipe may not be all that "spectacular" to some people -but the beauty of the recipe, is simply that it can be changed easily to suit a person's taste...want it spicy -add some Emeril's bayou blast or cayenne pepper, want more seafood -add some scallops, want a different type of cheese -use cojack, colby, swiss etc.,  
For those who seem to have trouble finding cream of shrimp soup - I have always been able to find it at Albertson's grocery store - I also know the soup can be ordered online, or perhaps ask your grocer if it can be ordered.

I won't waste time w/what's wrong with it.  Here's how u fix it....

If u want something vaguely "Louisiana" let's start by adding plenty of creole seasoning and some cayenne pepper.  The sauce consistency is nice, but it's so bland that you'll also need soy or tamari sauce to make it pop (I used a decent amount of tamari).  Make sure you sautee your mushrooms along w/a few garlic cloves and lovely strips of onion.  Season w/oregano, fresh parsley and finish w/a few pats of butter.  I can't imagine pairing this w/cheddar cheese, so I topped w/shaved aged asiago.  I used fresh mushrooms and cream of portabello mushroom.

Yum!  I substituted cream of mushroom soup.  Very mild, especially because I don't like strong seafood tastes.  It was like "shrimp stroganoff" over rice.  Yum!

This is a great recipe, I did customize it a bit after reading the reviews. I cooked the rice in chicken broth instead of water, sauteed a sweet onion, red pepper, and some garlic in  butter, then added cream of mushroom soup, lite sour cream, and 4 slices of cooked bacon crumbled up. Also added a little garlic salt, pepper and lemon juice. Poured the mixture on the rice and topped with cheddar/colby jack cheese.  Yum!  Kids loved it, will make again for sure. Thanks for the recipe Princess!

This is a new family favorite.  I couldn't find cream of shrimp soup so I used cream of mushroom.  This is so tasty!

This is one of those great recipes you can't mess up. I used regular rice, it's what I had. I also used cream of Mushroom soup because it is what I had. I used frozen salad shrimp and just reduced the cooktime, they just had to warm. I also didn't have sour cream so I just used a little milk to mix the sauce. Even though I masacared the recipe it turned out great and my kids loved it. They are big shrimp fans and big rice fans. You can't go wrong.

I tweaked this recipe like everyone else did, but absolutely loved the results!  I sauted some green onion and the can of mushrooms in butter.  I used the sour cream and cream of mushroom soup and then added about 1/4 cup white cooking wine and a bit of Parmesan cheese.  I also cooked the rice in chicken broth.  I topped the casserole with about 1/2 cup shredded cheddar.  It was creamy and absolutely delicious!

Pretty darn good. Great comfort food! I took the advice of others and I added to this for more flavor. I added 2 chopped garlic cloves and chopped green onions while cooking the shrimp. I also could not find cream of shrimp soup, so I used cream of mushroom and it was just fine. I will definately make this one again.

Easy to prepare with a decent taste--on the mild side.  I added a few dashes of creole seasoning, which provided a little zip.  Because this is so easy and offers a taste of seafood, I will probably prepare it again.  I recommend sharp cheddar cheese to offset the somewhat mild flavor of the casserole.  I used no-fat sour cream to reduce the fat percentage a bit.

I read all the reviews (especially the negative ones). With that in mind, I made some adjustments: The rice was cooked with vegie broth. The shrimp were sauted with butter. I added a splash of dry sherry and some lemon juice too. I used cheddar cheese soup for the shrimp soup and mixed in about a cup of grated cheddar cheese AND topped it with more cheddar. It turned out great! Oh yes, and I used lots of large shrimp rather than the small ones.

This specific recipes is really bland, but it has potential to be so good. I think next time I make this I will used fresh mushrooms, onions, and garlic and sautee those together. I'll also add a small can of chile peppers, red pepper, and black pepper to the sauce.

This was good. I added Cajun seasoning and some green onion. Skipped the mushrooms. It was very rich though.

I'ld say more around 3 and 1/2, but still good for what it is. We didn't have any cream of anything soups, so I doubled the sour cream. We also added a little garlic and onion to fill it out. Very nice and simple while getting better from being sick.

My husband and I tried this recipe and loved it. We made a few changes recommended: cooked rice in chicken broth vs. water, added celery and onion (chopped fine), salt/pepper/creole seasoning to taste. We boiled fresh broccoli flowerets for about ten minutes (so still crisp) and added it as well. As mentioned by other reviewers, we used cream of mushroom soup. With these additions, it was WONDERFUL!! Will definitely make this again. Thanks for this recipe!

This was pretty much what I would expect from a 'cream of whatever' soup recipe - quick, easy, nothing fancy, but a decent meal. If I were to make it again I would do as others suggested and add sauteed onions, and I would also use more seasoning, eg paprika, hot sauce etc. Thanks!

I changed this recipe a bit in accordance with some tips from others here as well as my own tastes.  For example I added some sauteed onions, fresh sauteed mushrooms, wild rice (with seasoning pack) which I pre-made.

I followed directions exactly and found it to be good, but not quite the flavors that I like best with shrimp.  I will add seasonings to make it more Cajun flavored next time.

I made this dish, and we absolutely loved it!  We don't have Cream of Shrimp soup down here in Costa Rica, so I went with Cream of Mushroom and we just loved it!  I used basmati rice instead of the instant stuff (once you've had basmati, you'll never have the regular plain ole rice again!).

I had a can of cream of shrimp soup that I didn't know what to do with, and tried this casserole.  We liked it well enough to try again sometime.  The only thing I did different, was to use jasmine rice that I cooked ahead rather than instant rice.

This is one of those few recipes that I really look forward to using again!  This is delicious!   The only thing I did differently was to cook regular rice and add two tsp of chicken gravy base powder (Watkins) after cooked.  I had a little  more than one pound of shrimp, and we enjoyed every one of them. Otherwise I went by the ingredients and times in the recipe with little variation (on purpose) and the resulting casserole was GREAT!  Oh, yeah!  I did shake in a bit  of lemon pepper, which I very much like.  The three of us consumed all except one small serving, which the girl in the picture took to work this morning.

I added green onions and cajoun seasoning when I sauteed the shrimp.   I also used Mozzeralla cheese instead of cheddar.  My husband said this might be his new favorite!

This was absolutely wonderful although what it has to do with Louisiana is beyond me...I added par-cooked broccoli, some hot sauce and used cream of mushroom as the shrimp soup is not available in Canada...we served it over rice.  My kids went nuts for it!  A definite keeper!

This is a really good dish and easy to change and personalize. I 'lightened' it by about 200 calories per serving by using low fat sour cream, lite butter, and Pam instead of oil. I also added broccoli. Next time I might 'season' the shrimp before cooking it. I had no trouble finding cream of shrimp soup at my local Super Target. Thanks for a great casserole recipe!

I agree the original is a little humble to me but to each it's own...after reading the reviews I also tweaked the recipe quite a bit. I substituted the white rice for brown and used a combo of seafood stock and water. I also substituted olive oil in the place of the vegetable oil added 1 small chopped green bell pepper, about 1/4 of a small white onion, 3 stalks of green onion, 1 tbsp garlic(mine was pre-chopped)  plenty of tony's and a dash a cayenne to the sauteed veggies and the shrimp while they were cooking. Oh and I also used cream of mushroom soup. But let me tell you..this was amazing!!!!! Thanks to the original recipe submitter for giving me the foundation to making my own FABULOUS meal!!!! Thanks why this recipe gets a 5!

Like many other posters, I put my own twist on this, but I found it didn't need much.  I was extremely pleased with the results.  I sprinkled the shrimp with a little bit of Old Bay seasoning and sauteed them with garlic.  I also added a small splash of white wine into the pan with the mushrooms (used an 8-ounce can since my family really likes them.)  I was able to find the Cream of Shrimp soup at Wal-Mart and thought that really was essential to the dish.  If you can't find it, I'd suggest using Shrimp Bisque or something similar, not the Cream of Mushroom soup.  I also used all the sour cream the recipe called for and had no problem.  Topped it with sharp cheddar.  I thought it made a bit too much for an 8x8 pan, so I used my regular 9x13.  It worked fine.

I agree that this dish would be bland without some additions.  My additions were: creole seasoning to the shrimp and soup mixture.  I had to use onion instead of mushrooms, so I also sauteed garlic with it.  Good idea!  Good recipe!  My husband loved it....I don't eat shrimp, so i can't rate it for myself.

Awesome! I want the dish to have more flavor so I will experiment with it. Perhaps I'll marinate the shrimp a little longer in the sauce. Not the prettiest dish so no picture this time.

This recipe was very easy, and my kids and my husband loved it.  I used regular rice though, and I also used cream of mushroom soup in place of the cream of shrimp.  I also added some onion powder and tony's and pepper to the sauce.  I also used about two cups of cheese on top , as my family loves cheese.  I will definitely make this one again.

This is a great base recipe.  As others did, I customized it to our personal tastes and it was wonderful.  I added creole and cajun seasonings, just a few dollops of sour cream, fresh mushrooms, and cheddar/monteray jack cheese combo.  I will make this often!

The recipe was great.  There were some things I would add next time though.  Maybe some bell pepper or onion.  A squeeze of lemon.  And being from the southwest, some green chili would be good too.

Very good and easy recipe.  I used salad shrimp and cream of celery soup instead of the cream of shrimp because that's what I had on hand.  It worked out well and tasted wonderful.  I also added onions because my family likes onions.  My 5 year old son loved it.

this was good.it wasn't amazing, but it was more comfort food style. i change a few things though. i dredged the shrimp in blacken seasoning and i added onion,canned crabmeat and fresh mushrooms. i didn't try the cream of shrimp because the reviews sounded weird, so i used mushroom. i wouldn't be opposed it though. i omitted the sour cream. with alot of reviews saying this was bland, i knew the sour cream wouldn't help. i'd make it again with these revisions.

This was entirely too rich and seemed very bland to me.  I, also, used cream of mushroom soup, rather than cream of shrimp.  I will not be making this dish again.  Sorry.

The sauce is very delicious but a bit too thick and rich for the amount of rice used. Also, don't pay attention to the method for cooking the rice, just follow the box instructions. This is a very good foundation but need perfected to get five stars.

I used half of the butter, and cream of mushroom rice instead of cream of shrimp.  I also stirred in the rice with the sauce before adding the cheese to the top.  

This was good, but a bit bland.  I also thought it could use more seafood.  I'd add a pound of bay scallops next time.

I happened to have a can of gourmet cream of crab soup in the pantry which I used in this.  I added one tsp. of Old Bay was good but next time I will add two.  I also sautéed fresh mushrooms and threw in a handful or two of frozen okra.  My technique was just to dump it all together, mix then place in my casserole and top with fontina.   Truly superb.  I have a lot of shrimp in the freezer so I was happy to find a new way to prepare.  Thanks for the recipe.  I agree with OP that you can put 'n take on this.  I call them "template" recipes.

I made this tonight using many of the tweets posted. I cooked wild rice in chicken broth..no surprise. I minced orange, red, yellow pepper, garlic and onion and sautéed in oil. I then added the shrimp, bayou seasoning to the mix, and sautéed until done. Then added soup, sour cream, and bacon bits. When incorporated, I added some cheese. Put over rice and broiled. It was yummy! I think the bacon bits made it. No real reason to take shrimp out and then put back in. Keep it simple!! Those who trashed this have no vision. I make changes to everything...my choice and my family's  taste. That doesn't make the original bad...just adapt to what you like. This recipe was a wonderful beginning!! Thank you!

I made some changes, so while what I made was a 5 star dinner, it's probably fair to rate the original recipe a 4. I cooked regular (not instant) rice in chicken broth, used fresh baby bella mushrooms instead of canned, and added garlic salt, black pepper, and a fair amount of cajun seasoning. Also, my 8x8 pan isn't broiler safe, so I just put the casserole in a very hot oven for 5 minutes until the cheese was melted. Honestly though, this was KILLER, and I'll make it again over and over. In the time it took to cook the rice, I had my shrimp peeled, mushrooms sliced, and everything cooked and ready to go, so dinner was on the table in maybe 25 minutes total. Can't beat that.

I made this because i already had medium/large shrimp in the freezer. I was expecting it to be bland, but it was surprisingly good.  I don't like mushrooms and wanted it to be more saucy, so I swapped out the mushrooms for cream of mushroom soup. It was a win-win! I will definitely make it again.

Surprisingly good - have to admit I wasn't expecting much, but needed to use up some shrimp with something fast.  I did change it a bit out of necessity.  I didn't realize until I was halfway into it that I didn't have any cream of shrimp... or cream of mushroom!  I wound up using low-fat cream of chicken.  (So I may have used a bit more sour cream to make up for the low-fat!)  I didn't have mushrooms but did have celery, so cooked that with the onion, and added a few shakes of a seasoning mix called "Gobs of Garlic" that we get at the Garlic Festival or county fair.  It could have still used more seasoning, as most recipes with canned soup always need.  I also used regular rice, not instant, so the whole recipe took slightly longer.  My 12 year old pronounced this "good", and that's high praise coming from her! EDIT: 11/8/15 Used cream of shrimp soup, a bit of white wine, fresh mushrooms and the gobs of garlic again - very good!!  Cooked the rice with chicken broth and bit of the gobs of garlic as well.

I think it needs more rice because the sauce was alot compared to the rice . Also maybe, more fresh flavor with herbs or a green veggie like spinach or broccoli.  Good concept and will make again with a few changes.

Super easy to make and very good.  I would, next time, marinate the shrimp in something with a little spice first. Or sprinkle with a bit of cayenne or Old Bay Seasoning first.  Will definitely make again.

This was a great base recipe.  I followed it for the most part, but substituted fresh shitaki mushrooms for the canned ones, added fresh asparagus as well as some pressed garlic.  I also sprinkled on a bit of garlic salt to kick up the flavor.  It is definitely a keeper at our house.

I read and heeded the advice of so many others. While initially cooking the shrimp I added salt, fresh ground pepper, and lemon juice (about 1 tsp). Plus, I added a host of other spices to make sure that I got some Louisiana "kick": cayenne powder, chili powder, parsley, and paprika. Like others I used cream of mushroom soup. I added frozen spinach, garlic power, and onion powder to my rice mixture (for color, flavor, and some vegetables) and at the end some mozzarella cheese. My wife loved the spice!

I thought this was great, and also so simple to make.  Like other readers I used Cream of Mushroom soup and added salt and pepper to taste.

As a vegetarian, I am very big on fish. We didn't have all the ingredients but I though SUBSTITUTING CREAM CHEESE for sour cream and CONDENSED SHRIMP BISQUE for the CREAM of SHRIMP SOUP was an interesting idea and it definitely made this dish really delightful and wonderfully rich. I would definitely recommend serving this over crackers and in taco shells for appetizers or a potluck. Of course, it also makes a great dinner and the short prep time is always helpful. Next time I'm definitely going to try to spice it up so it can live up to its Louisiana name.

I have made this twice now, once with mushroom suop and once with cream of shrimp soup. Got the shimp soup through Amazon ours stores didn't carry it. It is better with the shrimp soup but still on the bland side, but we like it anyway. I did add a little Old Bay and used real rice. We are rice eaters so don't buy instant rice. I will make this again quick and easy and I like the left overs. Thank you for sharing.

Too bland for our tastes.  Tweaked it quite a bit, but still bland. Don't let this review discourage you, we like very strong tastes, you may like it just fine.

Instead of shrimp or real seafood, though I use surimi, the fake crab or lobster stuff.  Using that with the cream of shrimp soup makes for a very economical seafood dish.  Over the years I have made all kinds of variations - lemon juice, white wine, different cheeses, different spices, vegetables - and it is always a success with my husband and me.  It is also good over pasta, brown rice, or orzo.  So for those who don't want to "waste" fresh shrimp, maybe try this with surimi for a money saver!

Made with Fat Free Sour Cream and Reduced Fat Cream of Mushroom Soup.  Also added a bit of Cajun seasoning but it could still stand to be kicked up a notch flavor-wise.  Next time will consider adding broccoli.  Overall, pretty quick and easy.

Did not like this recipe at all. My husband took two bites and cooked himself his own meal...

On a brighter note, my 3 yr old daughter loved it...she'll eat anything though.

I'm a college student, and this was easy enough to make in my ill-equipped college apartment.  I also made this at home for my family over Christmas break, and they loved it.  They even have tracked down the recipe themselves to prepare it after I left.  I do think the amount of sour cream was a bit excessive, so I cut it down some the second time I made it, and used white cheese instead to eliminate some fat.

Great base, I thought it was delicious.  Sauteed fresh mushrooms in basil/garlic seasoning w/EVOO, then combined with rest of mixture.  I used cream of mushroom soup, served with rice.  Left out the cheese, and peppered.  YUM.

This was a great recipe.  We made a few changes.  We used brown rice in place of the instant white rice. Also we used fresh asparagus, sliced garlic and fresh mushrooms.  We spiced things up by using Old Bay Seasoning and Paprika on the shrimp prior to cooking. sprinkled paprika on the top of the casserole.  We will be making this again!

Nice recipe!  I refuse to use canned soup due to the high sodium content in them.  Instead I made a white sauce with the juice from the canned mushrooms, added diced green onions, the sour cream and tossed the mixture with the cooked shrimp before pouring it over the rice. It is a keeper.

I love shrimp, so I always look for new recipes with shrimp in it.  Being from La. I was sceptical about this recipe, there was no spice whatsoever, so I figured it would be very bland.  Actually I don't need spicy food all the time, so I gave it a try, and loved it.  So did my husband.  I didn't care for the cheese, but my husband loved it.  I can't wait to try this recipe again, with maybe some of the variations people added.  The only thing I can think of to make it better would be to ADD MORE SHRIMP. ;)

I've never rated a recipe before but thought this one good enough and easy enough to make that it warranted a rating from me.  I made this for my family and it was an absolute hit!  I doubled the ingredients hoping to have left overs for the next day, but everyone had 2nd helpings and there went the leftovers.  I pretty much followed the recipe as listed except I did not use the Sour Cream as I am not a fan of it and my friend used it and didn't like the taste of it in the casserole. I found the Cream of Shrimp soup in Winn-Dixie (my friend found it in Wal-mart).  I also added minced garlic and seasonings to my shrimp so that it wouldn't be bland. 
I am on a low-carb diet so I scooped some of the shrimp mixture prior to pouring it over the rice and I poured it over two Tilapias I had baked.  Then I made veggies for my side. My family had it as intended, as a casserole and they really enjoyed it.  I've already shared the recipe with several friends! One friend substituted the rice for angel hair pasta and loved it the same!

We loved this! You were right when you said that this recipe can be adapted and is a good basic recipe to season to suit one's personal taste. I used creole seasoning, old bay, and sauteed minced garlic, onion, and green pepper. Will definately be making this again.

Not big fans.  Seemed very bland, and I even added some hot sauce to try to pick it up a little.  I might have liked it better on pasta instead of rice, hard to tell.  Not big fans of this one.

I thought this was a great recipe - thanks for sharing! I took the advice of other and sauteed green peppers, onions and garlic with mushrooms. I also added Old Bay seasoning and a few dashes of hot sauce. My husband said it was better than any restaurant dish he's had! :)

Very good...I put snow peas in instead of mushrooms and used cream of celery instead od cream of shrimp. Also, I used hald saour cream and half cream cheese. Wonderful quick recipe.

Very bland.  I think with some doctoring it could be good, but it was such a waste of shrimp I probably won't try to "fix" it.  sorry

I loved this recipe.  I couldn't find Cream of Shrimp soup, so I substituted Shrimp Bisque instead.  The sour cream gives it a really nice tang.  YUMMY!

Don't know where the green in the photo comes from...nothing green in this recipe.  I used regular rice instead of instant...used fresh mushrooms (8 oz.) and sauteed them before adding shrimp, soup and sour cream.  Also increased the cheese to 1 cup.  Added a little (1 t.) of hot sauce (cause some of us like a little spice...).  Good basic recipe...will add green onions next time!

My husband and I really loved this recipe, but I made a few changes.  I used fresh mushrooms, swiss cheese instead of cheddar, and added green onions.  I also used blackening seasoning on the shrimp and added cayenne pepper to the sauce.  I will make this recipe again!

Looking at the other reviews about blandness, I boiled my rice in chicken stock and it turned out pretty good.  Simple and quick.

This was a good, quick meal. I substituted cream of mushroom, used low fat sour cream, and added green onions.

Very good recipe but definately needs modifications.  
-cream of mushroom soup
-sauteed mushrooms and onion
-lots of cajun spice added to shrimp
-did not remove shrimp, just combined everything
-used orzo pasta instead of rice
-let sit after out of oven (5 min)

I used cream of mushroom with roasted garlic soup as stores don't carry cream of shrimp here. It was pretty good, but the sour cream taste was a bit overpowering. If I make it again, I'll likely use less sour cream and add some green chile for some kick.

I found this dish to be very rich. The shrimp soup was overwhelming. I think cream of mushroom or celery would have been better.

Not too bad!  Mine seemed to come out really salty...don't know if it was because of the shrimp soup or cheese.

Made one small change, and that was to add more cheese.  Very quick to prepare for a work-day meal.  Next time will add some Texas Pete for a little kick.

Although I love shrimp, I rarely cook it at home. But, I had some really awful frozen breaded shrimp that I couldn't bear to throw away. This recipe made them palateable (sp?)! I used cream of poblano soup instead of cream of shrimp. I also used fresh mushrooms and added some seasoning salt. This recipe is super rich! I don't think I would use this for fresh shrimp, though, since it has a lot going on, and I like to taste the shrimp. But it was great for my needs!

This was not really excellent for me, but in all fairness I changed it a bit. I used cream of broccoli soup because I couldn't find cream of shrimp. I also added broccoli. It was just OK. I really would like to try it again with the cream of shrimp soup. I will keep this recipe on hand to try again, just incase I ever find that soup. I would reccommend using the cream of mushroom if you cannot find shrimp. I used broccoli soup because I don't like mushrooms, and because I had planned to add broccoli. But mushroom soup seems to be an acceptable substitute according to the other reviews that I read.

I didn't have the condensed cream of shrimp soup so I used mushroom instead and I also added a bit of Franks Red Hot sauce and it was great. I will make this again.

I couldn't find cream of shrimp soup at my local grocery, so I used cream of onion.  It was OK.  If I make this again, I will search more stores for the cream of shrimp.

This recipe was quick and easy but a little bland. I used brown rice instead but mostly I tasted the mushrooms and the cheese. Cream of shrimp soup was new to me, but I was able to find it at the grocery store. My husband enjoyed it but I won't prepare it again without changing it to increase the flavor.
