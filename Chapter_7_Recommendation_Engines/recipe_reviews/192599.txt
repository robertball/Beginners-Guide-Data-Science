Fantastic summer tacos. I added seasoning to the beans (I used black), which included cumin, garlic powder, chili powder, paprika, salt and black pepper. I also added a bit of lime to the salsa mixture with salt. Tyler Florence's guacamole recipe was fantastic with these. Green onions and lettuce were served to top these off.  The easiest and freshest tacos that I have made to date.

These were very good, and easy.  You can warm tortillas in the microwave if you don't want to heat the oven (wrap in wet paper towel first).  I used black beans, did not rinse them, warmed them on the stove, then mashed them a bit with a fork.  If you like things spicy, add lime juice and extra jalapeno and garlic to the salsa, and add spices to the beans (I used cumin, garlic, chipotle powder, and red pepper) ... but if you like things less spicy the original recipe would be delicious as is.

These are good stuff though I made a few changes. Made them in less than 30 mins when I got home from work. I added some salt and sugar to the salsa and some tomatos and cilantro to the quac. To entice the family I mixed refried beans with black beans and spread the flours with some nacho cheese and stuffed a corn hard taco shell in it then added the beans and such. Very good stuff everyone enjoyed them and didn't miss the meat.

I thought this was going to be a yummy easy meatless meal but I was disappointed. It was easy enough but not that yummy. I added garlic and lime juice to the avocado to make it more guac-like, but it was still really bland. I've now read reviews where the cooks added a lot of seasoning to the beans, and they're right, the beans need it. These were also pretty difficult to pick up and eat. 30 seconds into dinner, I had a mess of fallen out black beans around me. I had to fold them kind of burrito style to eat. Hard taco shells would be much easier. I may try this again with more seasoning and some other modifications since I do like easy meatless meals, but I would not make again as is.

So good!!! I loved this and will make often. I only used fresh tomato, just out of preference. I think the one thing this recipe is missing is lime juice - I squeezed fresh lime juice into the salsa and the avocado mixture. The citrus really brightens the flavors and gives it the pop it needs. I used black beans instead of kidney since that's what I had on hand. Super delicious. Thanks :)

I made this one evening for my family and my vegetarian neighbor, and they are still talking about it!  My husband has been begging me to make them again since, and my neighbor was in awe at how quickly I was able to prepare everything and get the table set! I put my foot down and said we're having one veggie meal a week since we're all steak eaters and we know how the economy is right now. Not one of us was still hungry afterwards or complained about there not being any meat in the dish!

These were fabulous and filling!  I cheated and bought a Mrs. Renfro's salsa, but I still mixed in tomatoes, cilantro, and onion.  I also just mixed everything together so that the avacados would not brown since we didn't eat all of it right away.  I put it on a whole wheat tortilla and they were absolutely delicious!  I didn't miss the meat at all.  Next time I think I'll try using black beans.

We love this recipe.  We are trying to build a collection of vegetarian meals, and this one is a keeper. I use black beans, as many people suggested.  I also change things up depending on what I have on hand, for example I'll use regular tomatoes instead of roma tomatoes, or skip the cilantro.  It's always turns out great!

This is almost exactly how I have made tacos before.   I  love guacamole(some of us do live in areas where decent avocados are available year round).

This was great!  I didn't use jalapeno (didn't have any on hand) and it still turned out excellent.  

When I made this a second time (still omitting jalepeno) I included taco-seasoned ground turkey in the taco.  It was more hearty and even better than it was the last time!

I JUST made these for dinner....FANTASTIC! While I was putting them together, my hubby asked where the meat was. ;) I think he was very surprised by how tasty they were and how satisfied he was at the end of the meal. I did use 505 Organic (medium) salsa instead of the homemade and used garlic pepper instead of salt/pepper in the guac.  The only other change I made was using black beans instead of the kidney... since they were in the pantry and we prefer them.  A definite keeper and perfect light (yet satisfying) summer meal for AZ! Thanks for sharing.

This is a very good and nutricious meal. I made this without cilantro because it`s not in season so far. And I omitted fresh tomatoes. Delicious, will be making these tacos again.

I love this i would never think of having any type of tacos or Mexican food without meat but i am sold. This was great! I Added to my recipe box, and nothing less than a four star gets added.  Plus no cooking for anyone who would like a quick meal after a hard days work. Very refreshing.

These were a good alternative to regular meat or chicken tacos. Added a bunch of extra flavors such as garlic, garlic powder, cumin and lime juice that others had suggested....Mixed the beans, salsa and guac all together when we were done and made it into a pretty good dip that we ate off of for a few days after with taco chips!

These were very easy and yummy!  I added a few extra spices, and lime juice to the salsa and avacado mixture, used seasoned black beans, and served on hard taco shells.  VERY EASY to prepare and my vegetarian daughter loved them.

I rated four stars for the ease of a summer meal and healthy to boot. Would have rated five stars, but the beans, salsa and guacamole certainly needed more spices, and fresh lime juice. I used both red and black beans, heated them in a microwave dish for 4.5 minutes, we didn't want cold beans on a heated tortilla. I half smashed them with a potato masher, this kept them from falling all over the place when eating them.  This was very filling, we did put some shredded cheese on top.

I made these last night. So easy! Salsa was great. I used fresh basil instead of cilantro. I used someone else's advice and mashed the beans and I used black beans. I have my own gauc recipe (avacado, cumin, pepper, red onion, lime, garlic, Sriracha, and dash of adobo) so I used that and these turned I out great! I also added a little cheese and used Boston lettuce.

Very fresh and light, yet tasty.  Very easy to make.  Once you make the salsa and guacamole, which itself is quick, it just takes a couple of minutes to combine the ingredients.  So it makes a simple quick meal for days.

These were really delicious and my boyfriend loved them. I didn't find them too satisfying though and added some cheese and sour creme.

Absolutely amazingly delicious! I will make these over and over. I used black beans, which I think would be better. I do recommend using a whole jalapeno in the salsa if you like more kick--otherwise it would be very mild. I used leftover taco shells, but would love to try it with tortillas.

This tacos are delicious, I use pinto beans instead and sometimes add sour cream. I also make them with corn tortillas.

This tacos were excellent, the only change I made was to add pinto beans instead of kidney. I suggest to add seasonings to the beans, onions, garlic, whatever mexican spices you have on hand otherwise will be too bland. It turned out so delicious.

This was a fantastic treat. Thank you very much for sharing the recipe.   Unfortunately while the oven was preheating my canine companion decided to eat the tortillas that were on the counter.   I had to use some large flour tortillas we had in the fridge and we had macho guaco tacos. Delicious!
