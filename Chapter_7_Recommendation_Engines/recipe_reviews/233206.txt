My family enjoyed this recipe so much...it was so easy to prepare ahead of time and not only did it make the house smell sooo amazing when we got home, it was also extremely flavorful and everyone had seconds.  My new go-to slow cooker recipe for a homemade chili.

"Add remaining ingredients was a bit misleading as you do not add all the remaining ingredients as some are served when the chili is done.  I used crushed tomatoes as my husband likes the texture better and chili beans (mild) instead of kidney since that is what we had on hand.  I did serve chipotle powder, crushed tortilla chips and chopped onion as a optional topping. I loved the simplicity of this meal.

What a great time saver using this sauce!  I didn't make it in the slow cooker because I decided to make this for dinner at the last minute. I made it stove top in a dutch oven.  Replaced the ground beef with lean ground turkey and added a few more veg (celery and zucchini).  Browned up the ground turkey in the same pot I used to saute the veg, mixed in the rest of the ingredients and then brought to a boil and let it simmer, loosely covered for about 45 minutes.  Lots of good flavor and just the right amount of heat!  Served with some homemade buttermilk biscuits for a yummy dinner.

What a time saver! I love the Herdez sauces because they take the guesswork out of cooking. This recipe is so easy, yet so full of flavor. I made it exactly as written and was very impressed with the results. The only thing I added was salt and pepper when browning the meat.  The consistency was perfect (I didn't drain the tomatoes).  The house smelled so good all day! I will definitely make this again!

Made this in my 4qt. slow cooker; omitted the corn and subbed frozen chopped green bell peppers for the red bell peppers.  It turned out a little spicier than I usually make chili, but my spouse (with a higher tolerance for spicy foods) liked it just fine.  I also have the Herdez Red Guajillo Chile and Traditional Chipotle sauces, and wonder if I could substitute one of those for the Roasted Pasilla Chile sauce?

Hubby loved it more then myself, I thought it was okay. The cooking sauce flavor was different for me, however, it's worth a try in different preparations as well. Hubby asked that I make it again. But as is, it was to hot for my children. The recipe was totally simple to do and the ease of ingredients was great when you have most on hand all the time. I think I would love to try this with the Tomatillo Verde Cooking sauce next go around. TY

I didn't make in the slow cooker either, but simmered for about an hour.  Still delicious!

This chili was wonderful! Way to spicy for my kids so we added molasses to cut down on the heat. So very flavorful with a great consistency. We will enjoy this again!

This was a keeper for us! We ate it one night and finished the leftovers the following night. I kept everything as is, except I did use 2 pounds of ground beef and 1.5 jars of the sauce. Very easy and flavorful, yum! :)
