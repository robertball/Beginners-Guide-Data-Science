I left out the sauerkraut, and this was still amazing!  All the flavors combine just perfectly.  I'm sure it's fantastic with the sauerkraut, I just thought that might be pushing it a little too far for my family :-).  I used frozen sprouts, because they'd been in my freezer for awhile.  What a great way to salvage those poor overlooked veggies!

I'm not a fan of Brussels sprouts but my husband likes them so I've been trying new recipes. We both really liked this one! In fact, I've made this dish twice in the past three weeks. It's very flavorful and baking the sprouts with the ham, olive oil and herbs tones down their flavor.

This is really a phenomenal recipe.  The lemon juice is the "secret ingredient" giving it a nice bright flavor with this acid.  We will make this often!

Highly recommended! I would have given it five stars, but I did change the recipe a bit. I increased the amount of garlic, ham, and sauerkraut, and I'm glad that I did. I think if I followed the recipe exactly, it would have tasted a little more like a jazzed up Brussels sprout side dish, as opposed to the main meal. I also sprinkled on some extra parmesan and asiago on the top of the dish along with the bread crumbs, as I am a cheese fiend. Definitely will be making this again!

Delish!!! I made this with a few changes. I left out the sauerkraut, doubled the ham, halfed the oil and only baked for 35 minutes. It came out perfect! My entire family loved it, including by picky 5 year old. I served this with sourdough bread and a fruit salad. Excellent! Definitely making this again but will have to make more because there just wasn't enough for everyone to have seconds.

This was delicious! I bought ham for making sandiches, which when cut up is rather slim. This would be a good dish with cubes of ham. I sauteed the mushrooms before combining with the other ingredients. I doubled the recipe, but it seemed it was a little oily, so perhaps I"ll use less oil next time. Otherwise, delicious!

We liked this but are not big lovers of brussel sprouts. Next time I'd quarter them instead & may add a little more oven time. Because I didn't have kraut but did have purple cabbage, that's what I used. We actually liked the little bit of crunch. Couldn't taste Parmesan at all. Use more. Didn't have asiago so I doubled the parm. Add more.

This is a list of ingredients that I would never have come up with on my own, but I'm so glad to have found this recipe! Great way to use left-over ham without a lot of potatoes or pasta; just veggies. I didn't have sauerkraut on hand the first time so substituted some shredded cabbage.  The second time I just skipped it. I found that you can use significantly less oil (like half) without changing the flavor or consistency. I would suggest decreasing the cooking time a little to prevent the Brussels sprouts from getting mushy. Thanks for sharing this delicious recipe!

4.5 stars. I doubled the ham & sauerkraut but halved the oil as suggested by other reviews. Doubling ham + doubling sauerkraut= a little salty. I served with side of potatoes to lesson the saltiness. Next time I may add finely diced potatoes and more onion. This was otherwise delicious and so easy to make!

Delicious!!  I can only give this 4 stars, because I changed a few things.  Added more mushrooms, ham and sauerkraut as another reviewer suggested.  Also subbed Canadian "peameal" bacon for ham because it was what I had on hand.  Very, very good.

Tasted like German comfort-food. I added a cup of apple sauce, an extra 1/2 cup of ham, and doubled the sauerkraut. Subbed gruyere for the other cheese. Everyone loved it. Making it again tonight.

Amazing! Definitely a five star keeper!  I never would have thought a mix of these ingredients would taste this delicious. Simple recipe; I've made it several times. the only change I make is the cheese because I have trouble finding Asiago. I used a Mexican cheese mix that I bought in a premixed bag.

I didn't have Asiago cheese so I just doubled the parmesan and it was fantastic! oh, I did not put the entire amount of olive oil in it either, that seemed like to much to me.

I enjoyed the dish.  Family had mixed feelings but they are not fans of Brussel Sprouts.
I replaced the ham with pork loin I browned in a little bacon fat.
Next time if I do not have ham, I may use Kielbasa.

I was a little dubious after looking at the ingredients, but I made it just as written, using double smoked ham (smoked ham, resmoked in a home smoker.)  It was delicious and easy to put together!  My husband wants this in the regular rotation.

This is a recipe that is very good.  I doubled the cheeses and baked it in a 9x13 pan, which allowed the items to bake evenly in less time.

Made it as is except reduced oil by half and did not use the cabbage.  Made with left over Easter ham.  I liked it but my husband did not.  He said, " Would be fine without the ham."   Next time I will make it as a side dish with pork chops.

Used drained coleslaw instead of sauerkraut and added ginger. It was enjoyed by all including my resident coleslaw hater. It was easy to prepare and really quite tasty.

This was really different but somehow it works! The kids and husband ate it and loved it the first time I made it. I prepared this nearly as written. I didn't use mushrooms and breadcrumb topping due to personal preference. The second time I prepared it, I did use slightly less kraut, but again, that was personal preference. The type of kraut you use matters. I was using up packets the first time I made it, the brand you might find with condiments at a deli or at a sporting event. The second time I bought a jar and thought the kraut tasted more like pickle brine. It was actually a popular pickle brand that made the kraut. I thought it gave credibility but I guess it was more like a clue. It was edible but I didn't keep the leftovers. I don't know that my family would be excited if I made this any time soon but it's obviously no fault of the recipe. ;)

I have made this several times. I originally used it to eat up some ham, but it became a staple at my house. I dont use the sauerkraut, and I boil sprouts a few minutes before roasting. It is delicious!

This is a great recipe.  I love the combination of flavors- citrus, garlic, salt, greens, and meat.  I agree with the other reviews on the amount of oil.  I cut in half.  I also have substituted other vegetables (broccoli) and other meats (corn beef) with great success.  It is health and follows the paleo diet (mostly).

This turned out really well. Didn't have the asiago so I kicked up the Parm. Next time I will probably reduce the olive oil to 1/3 vice 1/2. Just seemed a bit much

I liked it, but my boyfriend did not care for it much.  He does not like brussels sprouts,  He did admit it was the most tasty brussels sprouts he's had but he still did not care for it much.

I rarely rate recipes I try here. But this one I felt compelled.  I loved it. I am not a big fan of Brussels sprouts but am trying to learn.  This made me a believer. I followed the recipe pretty closely but followed other recommendations and halved the oil, doubled the ham and sauerkraut. I didn't have asiago cheese so I just used Parmesan. I also used more bread crumbs on top but used pinko bread crumbs for extra crunch and put a little extra cheese in the with bread crumbs. I baked for 35 minutes. Absolutely perfect!

My husband loved this dish. My sons and i hated it. To be fair 3 of us don't like brussel spouts so that may have been the problem. It was moist and flavorful just not my thing. My husband ate over half and took the rest with him to work. He said it deserved 4 out of five. He said he would have added more cheese.

Recipe was delicious.  Left out the sauerkraut and substituted sweet onion for green onions.  Even the kids enjoyed it.
