Delicious. I have made them yesterday. We all loved them. The only change I made, substituted dry milk powder with vanilla instant puding mix, and since I think there is no need for aditional 1/2 cup of flour  in the filling, I added 1/2 cup milk. Next time will add a little bit more for a more creamy consistency. Will certanly make again. Thank You.

Awesome!  My whole family loved these.  I used the KitchenAid mixer with dough hook to mix and knead and it was very easy.  The coconut filling was so tasty and my kids and I had fun learning how to work with a fresh coconut - btw one coconut yeilds enough coconut to double this recipe.  When I mixed the filling it was very crumbly rather than creamy so I added a tiny bit of milk to cream it up.  Note that the filling does not end up gooey like an eclair - it's drier - and oh so good!

Just made them and extremely impressed with how they turned out! Taste exactly how the Chinese bakeries make 'em! Instead of making them oblong shape, I made them round and put black sesame instead. Also, I followed the other reviewer and used milk and vanilla pudding instead of the dry milk (great substitute!)

Wonderful dough for any sweet thing. I made these buns and cinnamon rolls with the same dough. It also freezes beautifully. After I put it back in the fridge to use the next day, I didn't get to it for a few days AND it still rose and baked BEAUTIFUL cinnamon rolls. 

BUT... There is only one thing that's missing and that's salt. It is a bit bland without adding salt. Maybe it was accidentally forgotten in the original recipe.

I just made these today and they turned out delicious, just like the bakery (see pic I added)! My husband was even impressed. I used dry whole milk instead of non-fat and it tasted great. Next time I will try and use different fillings, like custard or milk-n-raisin. This recipe is a keeper! The dough recipe itself is just like the Hawaiian sweet rolls. Great recipe, thanks Liang!!

This is a revision of my original review... torn now between 3 and 4 star (original was 4 star), but will give 4 star for benefit of the doubt.  The buns were hard after sitting for several hours.  This time though the dough did not deflate when I put on the egg wash.  Anyone else have problems with the filling?  Mine comes out still all crumbly and flaky.  The recipe shows says makes 32 buns, but the recipe says it makes 16?  I made 16, and I think there was so much of the filling that there was at least 1/4 cup of filling (if not more) in each, and still had a little left over.  This was my 2nd attempt at this recipe.  Although I gave it 4 star (for benefit of the doubt), I don't know if I would make this again.

These are really very good. Buns were soft & filling was the right consistency (it is supposed to be crumbly). I really wanted to give it 5 stars, but like another reviewer said, it seems to lack salt. Although, looking at a couple other recipes for cocktail buns, none of them had salt in the filling. Perhaps I needed to use salted butter and not unsalted? I didn't change a single thing from the instructions. I'll try to add a little salt next time and hopefully I can come back and give it 5 stars! I think that if I've never had "professional" versions of these, I might've given this 5 stars. But the filling just wasn't quite right flavorwise.

Also, this is the first time I've tried to open & grate a fresh coconut. Holy cow, that part alone took me an extra hour and I nearly worked my arm off! Next time I will buy some pre packaged coconut flakes instead.

These came out awesome. Just like the ones from the Chinese bakery.  I know some reviewers were commenting that the filling were crumbly but that's how I always got them from the bakery.  
Love the recipe, thanks for sharing!

These were delicious and easy to make. They were quite popular at a Chinese New Year's celebration dinner. They all disappeared within minutes.  One fresh coconut was perfect for doubling the recipe.

It was very easy to make and I have them a few more times. The only modification I made to the original recipe is I added an extra 1/2 cup of butter to make the filling easier to handle and less dry.

This was yummy! I let it rise at room temp (its been pretty hot out though) and it rose just fine. I also filled it with a pretty large heaping tablespoon. Very good recipe. Thanks!

Excellent recipe... just needed extra butter for the filling.  We used 3/4 cup instead.  Definitely will make again.

These turned out really great! I made half the recipe as it was just for the hubby and me. I didn't want to pay $10 for powdered milk I was never going to use so I took the suggestion of another reviewer and used instant pudding and they turned out great! Will make again!
