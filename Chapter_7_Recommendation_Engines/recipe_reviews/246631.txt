This was surprisingly good. I LOVE one pan meals.i debated at first on making this as I thought the ingredients were odd...carrots and the mushrooms to me doesn't work. In the end it tasted good. I added some Italian seasonings when cooking the vegetables.  It could benefit from more soya sauce and additional seasonings..but overall good.
