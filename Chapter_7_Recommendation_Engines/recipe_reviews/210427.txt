Chocolate, caramel, nuts, and whip cream!! What more could you ask for?  This recipe was AMAZING!  It's definitely a make ahead - it takes a while to put it all together - but it is definitely worth it in the end! I doubled the recipe, and when I put the brownie in the pan, it looked very thin, so I ended up putting both recipes in one 8 inch pan.  This made it take a considerable longer amount of cooking time (about half an hour more), but they came out perfect!  Chewy on the inside, a little crunch on the edge - simply amazing!  There was WAY too much "parfait cream" (but we only did two layers).  Definitely enough to do another batch. The longer you let it sit in the fridge, the better it gets.  I will definitely be making this again. :D

YUM!!! I made as directed - the brownies were a little thin, but were perfect for a parfait. The parfait was unbelievable. This is a great make ahead recipe for when you want to impress:)) Only down side was I couldn't figure out where the vanilla was supposed to go. It is in the ingredient list but not in the directions.. I put mine in the whip cream because the parfait was already in the refrig by the time I realized it wasn't in the directions. No left overs here. Will be making again.

Made this for a small dinner party and everyone was impressed and asked for the recipe.  One change, I made my brownies from a box to cut down on cost and time.  Also, add vanilla to the cream when you are whipping it.  The vanilla is listed in the ingredients but not in the directions!  Lastly, I layered the brownie, caramel, nuts, parfait twice (ending with the parfait and a few more nuts on top) and it was just right.  I think if you do another layer it would be way too rich for a single serving...  just my thoughts!

This recipe was a 50/50 like of my dinner guest. We found it extreamly rich. I myself will not make this recipe again as a whole, but the brownies were awsome by themself. I will use the brownie recipe again and again.

I have made this recipe a few times now, and it is always very popular. Last time I made it, I was low on time, so instead of making the brownie and using pecans, I used a baked apple pie instead and layered it with the cream and caramel. It was AMAZING!

Sickly sweet. The brownie part is pretty gross. The parfait part was good. Could have just had the parfait part with the caramel and pecans. I would skip the brownies and replace them with bananas or apples in the future.

The flavor is excellent.  I wasn't able to get the brownies to cut into small enough pieces to make it truly look like a parfait, which is the only reason I give this four instead of five stars.

Perfect! I made Betty Crocker box mix brownies but followed the parfait recipe and I'm so glad I did. My husband and daughter couldn't get enough. The parfait creme is totally worth the trouble, I don't think I'll ever use regular ol' whip cream on anything ever again. I left out the Carmel sauce because I figured that would be to rich and sweet. 

Make these ahead of time and put them in a pretty glass for presentation and refrigerate. We actually liked it better the next day!

I made this for a friend bday party that loves anything brownies. I used two boxes of Ghirardelli mix instead of making from scratch. Let me say the parfait portion of this is YUMMYYYY!! I could have ate the cream alone. I served them put together in mason jars and every one loved this dessert. I will warn this is a en extremely rich tasting treat. I could never eat more than one serving.

These are delicious! I made them for my book club girls and everyone was in love! The only change I made was using a boxed brownie mix - it was a ghirardelli mix. They worked well to make ahead and chill for about 4 hours. It really made the flavors set. I will definitely make these again.
