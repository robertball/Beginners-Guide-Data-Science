I rearranged the steps with making the  pineapple/soy/whiskey sauce first.  Then sliced each thigh with an X and placed in a plastic bag with the marinade and let sit for 6hr. or so in the refrigerator.  Then while grilling it I heated up the marinade with adding a little more pineapple and whiskey and let it reduce for about 10-15 min on med high then basted the chicken with it while cooking on the grill.  Served with rice and corn on the cob and salad.  My family loved it. Thanks for the recipe to use from.

I was trying to replicate a sweet whiskey sauce that a local restaurant uses for their chicken sandwich. I found this recipe and thought it might be close. There are a few things I did differently. I marinated the chicken for a while before grilling. I added extra brown sugar and also honey. I also ditched the mushrooms in favor of onions since onions seemed more appropriate for a sweet dish than mushrooms. The result didn't quite turn out like what I was trying for, but it was still very good for a first attempt. Next time I will try to make it sweeter and I will use less pepper. I like spicy foods, but there are plenty of other sweet and spicy chicken recipes out there and I wasn't expecting spicy with this one. 

One note on preparation:  Since I marinated the chicken, I obviously had the liquid ready before grilling. I recommend doing it this way to cut down on overall cooking time. Get the sauce simmering before the chicken even goes on the grill, otherwise it will take even longer than the 45 minutes this recipe indicates.

WOW!  Made this exactly as receipe called for. We used Jack Daniels Honey Whiskey for the bourbon whiskey. We made rice and grilled veggies (a blend of green peppers, onions, carrots, & brussel sprouts)to go with the.chicken. We ended up making it layered with rice, then veggies, and topped with chicken and sauce. It was so delicious and surpassed my expectations. It was so light tasting for a summer day. I also think it would be an easy.dish to make.while out camping as well! Will DEFINITELY do this again and will recommend to.my friends!

Phenomenal and so easy. I didnâ€™t have pineapple juice so I used 1 1/2 cups of orange juice plus one fresh lemon squeezed in. This was a hit!!

GREAT taste!  Made this last night with a few substitutions.  Didn't have pineapple or apple juice so used white cranberry juice and the new Apple Crown.  Everyone loved it!  My wife, who doesn't like mushrooms, ate several of them.  Apparently, the thicker mushrooms have a better taste/texture for her.

I followed the recipe as directed, only using Jack Daniels Tennessee Honey Whiskey. It was superb. Served over rice. Everyone ate it up! Even the kids!

Will make this again. Instead of all pineapple juice i used 1/2 cup pineapple and 1/2 cup honey. Did not add the brown sugar. I had rotisserie chicken which i used in place of the chicken thighs.  I had Dewar's honey whiskey which i used.  My husband really enjoyed this.

I will give this a solid four stars. I did not have fresh mushrooms available so I used canned. Better than no 'shrooms! Next time we will definitely serve this over hot rice.

Very good!  I added the cornstarch as I like my sauces thick and I used chicken breast but otherwise followed the recipe.  Next time I will grill whatever veggies I have on hand and try a little less soy sauce t suite my own taste.
