This is a 5-star recipe.  The pistachio crust is excellent.  I got many compliments.  I thought it would be a lot harder to make than it was.

This was pretty good and easy to make, the pistachio crust being the part that got rave reviews (the filling was a bit of an odd combo although I do usually like raspberry/chocolate - maybe not as decadent as expected?)  I will probably use the crust in a future project, perhaps with a cheesecake filling.

This was not easy, as indicated, and after the first serving, we threw the rest away.  It was awful.  It was very bitter and nothing helped.  As good as it sounds, it was that awful.
