Different but good. Almost like a lime Diet Coke but only fresher and with a kick. I doubled the vodka because I like my drinks stronger. If I make this again and I will I'd add just a skotch of fresh squeezed lime and lemon juice. Just to give it a tartness in the mouth.

I'm enjoying this right now and it's very nice!! I took Lambchops advice and added a squeeze of lime juice. Refreshing and I'm looking forward to making a pitcher of these for a warm summer evening! Thank you Wendy!

Pretty bland just tastes like watered down coke. Won't be making this one again.

I'm giving this a three because in my haste to make this drink I didn't realize it was pretty much just vodka and club soda. Otherwise it would be a one star. I had high hopes for the cola and lime juice (added per other reviews) but this drink was straight club soda. Go Lambchop for doubling the vodka! I added some sweetened lime juice after the fact and a bit more coke. I'll stick with my watered down vodka sours. Light and lemony. Mmmm.

It was ok if you like tasteless spritzer. Instead of using club soda I used sprite and left out the cola much better...

I make something similar. Omit the cola and add 1/2 a lemon and 1/2 a lime. Really refreshing! Would love a name for it.

This was pretty bland. Next time I will cut the amount of club soda in half.

I liked this. I subbed Diet 7-Up for Club Soda and garnished w/a cherry rather than lemon/lime. I can't see myself making it again but I enjoyed it while it lasted. Cheers!
