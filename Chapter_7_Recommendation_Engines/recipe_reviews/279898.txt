Basic recipe.  Needs a splash of basalmic vinegar or glaze to make it “the best”.

This salad is very good made as directed. Have made it for years. I like to add chopped red onion and a splash of balsamic vinegar.

THE go-to quickie salad! Always good! If you don’t have fresh tomatoes right out of the garden, the grocery store usually always has Campari tomatoes sold on the vines in the plastic shells.
They’re the best tomato for wintertime salads!

Think about reducing the evoo and adding in a good quality balsamic.
