Dang, did we ever enjoy these!  The only change I made was using ground turkey (I had one patty in the freezer & it worked well) instead of ground beef.  They baked up beautifully, are cheesy, moist, and tasty, and excellent for portion control.  Another nice thing about this recipe is that after they cool for a while, you actually can eat them with your hands, knife and fork optional.  These would be great for game day, a buffet table, party food or, of course, dinner.  Thanks kpiper for submitting your recipe, I wouldn’t change a thing, and in this house, it’s been delcared a winner!

These were a hit with my picky husband. I used a large muffin pan and found that the squared of wonton wrappers fit perfectly, no cutting required. And I mixed the three cheeses together with basil and oregano and then topped with just mozarella.  I think the only thing I might do differently next time is to add some creamed spinach to my cheese mixture I do that for my veal parm topping and find it adds a little more flavor.

May I suggest using gyoza (pot sticker) wrappers.  Usually can be found next to the wonton wrappers.  They are already round, no need to cut.

They are fun - Kids and hubby all liked but it wasn't voted as amazing (one son and hubby say I should give it 4 stars!). I quite liked the wonton wrapper texture - better than traditional noodles. Easy to make but SO SO SO time consuming. Between the cooking of the meat, the prepping of the cheese mixture and the layering it took over an hour. Then the 20 min bake time. I didn't bother to cut them into circles, just pressed the squares into the muffin tin. Also I doubled the recipe and barely had enough ingredients for 18 muffins - and they were not large. I think tripling the recipe will be enough for 24, which if I am going to spend that much time prepping, I want left-overs. Be sure to let them sit in pan like the recipe states. It tastes just as good straight out of the oven, but they are runny, and sloppy if you don't let them sit and firm up. Watch the video - make recipe from there pausing at each step!

I'm a vegetarian, so I made these with spinach, green and yellow squash and onions.  I bought "Texas sized" muffin tins for Thanksgiving dinner for the vegetarians, and also made the smaller ones for other people.  Everyone loved them.  I didn't even cut the wonton wrappers and they cooked perfectly.  They actually tasted better two days later, with some fresh mozzarella and sauce on top, heated in the microwave for two minutes.  Will definitely make them again.

1/3 pound of beef did not fill the 8 muffin cups I did use. I just cut the wonton wrappers with a pair of scissors and it was much easier but all in all it took me FOREVER to put these together.

Added chopped garlic and basil when I sauted the chopped meat. Added some pesto(basil) to the Ricotta Cheese . Took out 5 minutes before finished and put shreded  parm on top and back in the oven for the home stretch.

These were fun to make and tasted great! I used a little over half a pound of beef instead of  1/3 pound, and I seasoned it with lawry's garlic salt instead of regular salt. The wonton wrappers were in little squares, so I didn't have to cut them. It turned out so well, I will probably make it the same way next time. Steamed spinach and garlic bread made good sides.

This is such a fun recipe. I make them in bulk and they freeze and keep very well. I don't bother cutting the noodles I just press the wonton into the muffin tin. I find it keeps everything in place once removed from the tin!

I added an extra layer of wonton at the bottom because I felt it didn't cover enough and wasn't sure on strength. Didn't cut the wrappers either. I feel 20 is a little long at 375. Might try lower temp next time.

Delicious! I tweaked the recipe slightly by using 1/2 pound ground beef and adding garlic powder and some Italian seasonings as well as the  S & P. I also could not find wanton wrappers at my grocery store so I bought fresh, refrigerated lasagna sheets and easily cut the circles out of those. So yummy!

These were just OK. Lasagna is easy to make but it can be a bit time consuming. You might as well make an entire pan and have lots to serve,  plus any leftovers to freeze for an quick meal for later.

I haven't made these, but I know there were many recipes for meals made in muffin tins called Timbales.  This is a term from the 1930s.  I don't recall exactly what they were but it was not a dessert, it was a mixture of things with at least a little meat or cheese.

Really good! I made a double batch with 1lb ground beef browned and added to 1 jar of spaghetti sauce seasoned how I usually make my spaghetti sauce. For the cheeses I only used 3/4 cup of each cheese, or 1.5 cups for a double recipe, and I felt that was plenty. I made it even easier on myself and just used an Italian blend cheese for both cheeses, so 3 cups total of the Italian blend added to 1.5  cups of the ricotta, all mixed together to make assembly also easier. I didn't bother cutting the wonton wraps. Topped last layer with a little more cheese and Italian seasoning. Going to use this recipe for my daughter's birthday coming up, for her to make with me and her friends, and possibly at a baby shower too!

My family loves these. They prefer it over regular lasagna so I make them fairly often. The thinness of the wonton wrappers as opposed to lasagna noodles really make the flavors of the other ingredients stand out. 

I usually make 24 of these so I don't waste too many of the wonton wrappers and they're even better as leftovers the next day.  I just prepare extra sauce and make sure I have extra cheese.

I only cut the corners off the wrappers used for the top layer and use whole ones in the bottom. Don't worry if you don't think they cover enough of the cup. It works. I just drop a spoonful of ricotta in then top with shredded parm, shredded mozzarella and sauce. I top that with a trimmed wrapper and the same layers. 

I bake at 350 for 12 minutes, top with shredded parm and mozzarella then bake for 5  more minutes. Let them sit for 15 minutes before taking them out of the muffin tin and they'll pop right out neatly.

I think the key is to not overthink it. I just plop the ingredients in. No measuring  or spreading. They're super easy  to assemble and  absolutely delicious.

I made these for a party. I added more mozzarella cheese and less Parmesan cheese. Just a matter of taste for me and they came out great. Either way, I think they would have. My husband loved them so much, they almost didn’t make it to the party. I would definitely make again.

Very easy to do, I cooked or chopped  the things I added in -  like the hamburger, onions, zucchini, etc - the day before assembly - so easy - I did reduce the amount of time in the oven to 16 minutes due to wontons getting a little too brown in my oven - and I added marinated mozzeralla balls to the mix - great idea, and easy, everyone loved them!  I did not cut the wontons, just put them in and they looked like flowers in the tins, which I thought was prettier.

Great Portions! 
I could eat the whole pan up. 
I didn't use wonton wrap tho.
I used traditional pasta.
It was what was already in the pantry. With Scissors I sized it up.... 
or should I say down? 
I am excited about trying wonton wraps next time though!!

Big hit! These are delicious. Everyone loved them. I was truly amazed at how easily they came out of the muffin pan. My eight year old asked me to make them for all his friends so they can taste them. This recipe is a keeper.

I've made this before but not this specific recipe. I don't see the need to cut the wontons into circles. It seems like that would make it harder to get out of the pan. Instead, I lay one square wonton wrapper and then a second one rotated 45 degrees for each layer. This results in a really neat rosette structure and makes the lasagnas look more attractive. Just snip off any corners that stick out of the pan and overcook.

I make these for my family all the time now!  Making regular lasagna was always such a production.  This is quicker, definitely easier to serve, and perfect to bring for lunch the next day(s).  I am lactose intolerant, so I just swap out the regular cheese for fake cheese for a few of the "cupcakes".

Awesome recipe. I used a jumbo muffin tin as suggested in another review. I didn’t find this time consuming like another reviewer said. Once I had the ingredients ready in bowls, it took less then a half hour before we were eating. Definitely making this again.

Used Puttanesca sauce instead of regular red sauce.  Also, added Italian bread crumbs to the top.  Soooo yummy!  The kids liked it too, ages 12 and 5!

This is the easiest recipe I've made in awhile. It doesn't take a lot of time or ingredients. They look like they're not going to fit at first but it works out nicely. I only cooked mine for about 12 minutes and they came our perfect.

This is so easy and the kids absolutely love it!! Easy to make and easy to adjust to personal taste (one grand doesn't like the cheese) great left overs if you can manage to not eat them all also freeze well. Thanks for the great idea!!

I made these yesterday and they were amazing. They only took 10 minutes to put together, because I mixed up the ricotta, parmesan and mozzarella and mixed the meat with the sauce so very easy to layer. 
The first layer of wonton wrappers I placed whole and the second layer I just used scissors and snipped the corners.
I used a non-stick muffin pan and they slipped out easily with a soft spatula.
Only thing I would change is the amount of cheese topping as it was a little greasy at the end but I drained them on paper towels which helped.  Now to see how they reheat from being frozen.

I made these for the first time last night and these were absolutely amazing!
I only made some slight changes but nothing that strayed from this recipe. I seasoned the ground beef before browning it with some garlic and onion powder, oregano, and a little bit of red pepper flake for some extra flavor. I also used shredded parmesan cheese instead of grated. I didn't cut the wonton wrappers and found that leaving them as the squares helps to keep everything on the neater side and together easier. I folded the corners that we're sticking up over the layers and put the cheese over top. Sprinkling some basil over everything after they were done cooking really ties everything together. 
I wish I had taken a picture of them before they were served because there weren't any leftover! I followed the video since the directions are a little confusing and I'm glad I did! Such an amazing dish that I'm already getting requests by my family to make again, this is definitely a keeper!!

Absolutely loved these! I've been wanting to try these for quite awhile and am so glad I finally did. I didn't cut the wrappers, just smooshed them in and liked how they came up around the sides. I used pasta sauce with mushrooms added but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Great for portion control and tasted delicious. Now to see how well they freeze....

I used cottage cheese instead of ricotta, and Quorn crumbles instead of meat.

Kids like "real" lasagna better, but thought this was fine (A. would like it better with real meat). Husband was a big fan of it. I liked it a lot.

I looooove lasagna, and the idea of having little lasagnas to snack on is so perfect!
Today I made spaghetti, and decided to buy wonton wraps to make the cupcakes along side it. After I prepared the spaghetti meat sauce (and before I combined it with the spaghetti noodles), I got my cupcake tins ready for layering.

I didn't have all the supplies, so I just coated each cup with vegetable oil because I was afraid of them sticking... The bottoms didn't stick, but the sides kinda did. I used two wraps for the very bottom layer, then one for the other two. I had four extra wraps, so I just doubled the top layer for four of them (out of curiosity). I only had the meat sauce and parmessian cheese for the contents.

Cooked 18 min., cooled 15. Took a while to pry them all out with a spoon, and they were so greasy, I had to wipe the bottoms before placing them on the plate! That's my fault though, I'm a pretty novice cook. ( ????? )

Next time Imma see about getting a cutter for the wraps, the crispy corners are a bit annoying to bite through. Besides that, they're really good and I love them! :D

Next time to save time I may just make them the cheap way and only use Ragu sauce with some salsa, Italian seasoning, cayenne pepper, and no meat.
Just to have them as a personal snack, I don't mind however flavorful lasagna, pasta, spaghetti, or pizza are, haha.

Excellent, Excellent, Excellent.  This is a perfect alternative to the standard pasta dish.  The wonton wrappers made the world of difference for me (saved on calories and carb count too!!).  I used ground turkey along with ground sage sausage, minced red onions, and minced tri-color bell peppers.  I don't really like the various cheeses, so I used mozzerella only.  I also used a generic marinara sauce.  My two boys helped me which sped up the process.  Three wonton wrappers were used for each cupcake. We left one wonton whole for the bottom of the muffin and used a mason jar lid the same size of the muffin hole to cut two wontons into circles. Doing it this way allowed the cup shape to truly form and gave the muffin a little “handle” to pull the muffin out since the bottom wonton was left whole.  I know I made many changes, but I thank you for the concept.  Will definitely make again.

Easy to make. Recipe called for 12cakes, I used all the meat in 6 spots. I didn't use all the left over Parmesan cheese as it seemed too much. Nice and soft, very edible. Will be making a lot more of these.

These little lasagna cupcakes were delicious. I didn't have a cutter so I used the rim of a small wine glass and it cut through the wonton with no problem. I made it just like I would make a regular lasagna. Delicious!!!

Really enjoyed these! I was afraid the edges would be crusty and hard to cut, but we did not have that problem at all! Like another reviewer, I did not trim the wrappers. The corners that stuck out actually made it easier to get them out of the cupcake pan - like little handles. I also liked that these were easy to individualize - my BIL is vegetarian so 4 of them got zucchini instead of beef. We all enjoyed them! The only slight change I would make is laying the ricotta first on top of the wrapper - it's hard to spread on top of shredded cheese.

We couldn't find wontons so we used phyllo dough, & we only ended up using half of the 16-oz. pack. We had a ton of filling leftover so we were able to make a separate casserole. Really really good!

Used ground turkey but needed more. Also doubled up on the dough on the bottom layer.

Big hit with my family. Used seasoned turkey and meat combo. Mixed the cheeses and Ricota together like the video showed. My son says it tasted like pizza!!
