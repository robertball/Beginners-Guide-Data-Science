OK, here's the problem with the recipe... you need to crush enough cereal (3 cups uncrushed) to equal 1 cup of crushed cereal. Whatever you do - don't end up with 3 cups of crushed cereal! We made these with 1 cup of crushed, it was delicious! It was a cross between a brownie and a chocolate chip cookie. YUMMY!

I didn't know what to expect from this recipe since I received it long ago and am just trying it now. And along with the negative reviews I considered not finishing making them; since I didn't read them until after I started mixing them. But I'm glad I did because there are good. They are very tasty and the texture is a cross between crispy and brownielike. I used semi-sweet chocolate baking squares since that's all I had. I'm thinking that perhaps the nay-sayings might have interpretted the recipe wrong. In the ingredients, it should say "3 cups Frosted Flakes, crushed to 1.5 cups". Perhaps some people thought it was 3 cups of crushed flakes, since that is how it reads here. But my original recipe words it correctly. Other than that, I followed everything exactly and my family is enjoying eating them right now.

I'm gonna do a big no-no and rate it after I changed the recipe. I used corn flakes instead of the sugar frosted cereal and m&ms and just stirred them in instead of melting chocolate. SUPER good! Good enough that you can change them up and they're still good! :) Sorry for peeving people. Change isn't always bad.

I am SO excited to find this recipe here. I love to make things for people that they haven't had and haven't been able to find in forever. My uncle was telling me about these cookies he had as a kid so I went in search of the recipe and here it is!   I'll update right after I make a batch. Thanks so much!

I just made these cookies today - They are fabulous!  I had corn flakes that were on the verge of stale instead of frosted flakes so I added an additional tablespoon of sugar - probably didn't really need it!  They were awesome warm from the oven, and just as good when the cooled off - moist and chewy with a little crunch from the cornflakes.  This recipe will definitely be added to my recipe box.

These cookies were not very good. I baked them for my sisters class and she tried one when they got out of the oven and did not like them at all. I had to go the the store and buy some 10 pm at night. sorry

Yum!  I used corn flakes & they added a great texture, almost similar to oatmeal cookies.  I did not melt the chocolate chips, but rather mixed them in whole with some butterscotch chips so the cookies would have chunkage - DELICIOUS!

I thought these were pretty good, good enough that my hubby requested them again.  I followed another reviewer's advice and used 3 cups of cereal crushed down to 1.5 cups.  We only had plain corn flakes on hand, so that's what I used.  I will try it with frosted flakes next time.  I added a little extra sugar to make up for it, and it still wasn't overly sweet.  I also baked these in mini muffin cups until the tops didn't look really wet anymore.  Probably about 11 minutes.  They turned out well.  I didn't get 5 dozen out of them because of the muffin tins, but I probably got 3 dozen.  Thanks Lisa!

Delish. Bad reviews mean either this isn't really the kind of cookie you like or you made them wrong. Very addictive!! Yum!

I don't like anything going to waste, so I crush up all types of leftover cereal and mix it together in a bag. I used 1 cup of this cereal mixture in place of the frosted flakes and also replaced 1/2 cup granulated sugar with 1/2 cup brown sugar. Wonderful!

Yum! I made it pretty much exactly how the recipe said. Except I had unfrosted flakes. I read the comments and saw it was 3 cups uncrushed Frosted Flakes and the.
