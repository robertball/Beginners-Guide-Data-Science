Hi everyone, I am the author of this recipe and from reading the reviews I thought I would add...the roux color is really dependent on how you would like it.  I used milk chocolate as a reference as that's our family preference.  If you would like it darker then you would just keep a stirrin until it's a color you would desire-it also intensifies the flavor. Also, if you do not like it thick then reduce the flour/oil ratio to maybe 1/2 c. flour to 1/2 c. oil.  Thanks to everyone for trying the gumbo!!

Jodi

Really delicious. I only used half the roux because I like my gumbo thicker. I needed about 3 pounds of meat (chicken and sausage)to make this a stew-type gumbo. I also added 1/2 lb of frozen okra during the last 30 min. I only cooked mine for about an hour, but sauteed the veggies and chicken for 15 min before adding to the roux. A few tips for those new at making a roux: careful when you add the vegetables to the roux, the roux will splatter like hot oil. at medium heat this took 30 min. to turn the color of chocolate milk. I would recommend medium high heat, but watch the roux.

Great "authentic" gumbo - I've lived on the bayou all my life and I just cringe when I read a recipe for gumbo that includes tomatoes - a true gumbo does not have tomatoes!!!  This is very close to the gumbo I make.

This is the BEST gumbo!  I've been making this for over 20 years from my mom's recipe that she got from a cajun neighbor when she lived in Lafayette LA in the early 60's.  And this recipe is almost exactly like the one I make.  The changes I made was I did not add bellpepper (personal preference) and I added 2 cans of okra (drained) and added 1 tbs of file (optional).  Plus I boiled a chicken and deboned. I darkened my roux more like chocolate pudding.  Otherwise, I was tickled to see this recipe posted.  It truly is "THE BEST EVER GUMBO!  Once in a while, I'll add some canned drained oysters too.  Thanks YoYo!

I don't really measure my green peppers, onions, or celery when I make gumbo anymore, unless it is a really fancy recipe. I just eye it. For this recipe, I used 1 medium/large green bell pepper, 1 medium onion, and 3 celery stalks and chopped them up. I also used 1 pound of browned smoked turkey sausage, 1 pound of diced, cooked chicken breast, 1/2 pound of large shrimp, 1 can of clams, and 1 can of crabs. The only problem I had with this recipe is that it said "Creole seasoning to taste." A little vague, don't ya think? So, for my seasoning, I used 1/2 t. dried basil, 1/2 t. dried thyme, 1/2 t. dried oregano, 1 t. of ground black pepper, 1 t. of cayenne pepper, 3/4 to 1 t. of salt, 1 t. of paprika, some file powder (add according to your taste) and 1 t. of pepper sauce.

This is the real deal.  Gumbo is my favorite thing to cook and eat.  The only differences I make is I add 3 celery stocks because I like celery a couple jalapeno peppers for heat, two tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce "preferably Lea and Perrins" and a bottle of dark beer like a stout or porter.  Also I prefer to make my own chicken stock then shread the chicken for the gumbo or you can just use a large package of whole skinless bone in chicken thighs which works best.  Theres a great youtube video of Justin Wilson on making gumbo.  Check it out if you can.  And remember to constantly stir your roux, when you think it's going to burn cook it for 15 minutes longer just make sure to keep on stirring and you'll be alright, it should look like dark chocolate with a redish tint to the head  A wood spoon works best wisks can't get the edges right.  Serve with tobasco, and white rice cooked in chicken stock and you'll be in heaven.  Ok now im definatly making this tomorrow.  Ymmmm

This recipe is fantastic! I had been looking for a tomato-free gumbo recipe for a while! A note to anyone who said that it turned out too greasy because of the full cup of oil: it probably needs to cook longer. A lot longer. I recently stumbled upon an easy oven roux recipe that changed my life (my gumbo-making life, that is). Pre-heat the oven to 375 degrees. In a cast iron dutch oven, heat 1 cup of oil. After heated, slowly add a cup of flour and whisk thoroughly and heat through. Then, just transfer the whole dutch oven into the pre-heated oven and cook for 1 1/2 to 2 hours (your preference, I like my roux DARK). All you have to do is take it out every 20 minutes and whisk it a little. BEST roux I've ever made. Ever. And no standing over a hot stove all day! 8-10 minutes on the stove is just not enough, not even close. Everything else in this recipe is spot-on though. If the roux is cooked properly, you won't see any oil or grease floating to the top because it's been fully cooked and incorporated into the flour. Oh! And I added about 1 1/2 cups of frozen okra the last 10 minutes or so. Just a personal preference... I love okra!

I've only eaten gumbo once in New Orleans, and this was so much better than I remember.  I used corn oil and cooked the roux until closer to the color of milk chocolate rather than chocolate milk as recommended in other Gumbo recipes on this site.  Used mild Italian sausage and 1 lb boneless chicken breast.  Used 2 Tbsp Cajun Seasoning I brought back from New Orleans which might make it a little spicy for kids.  Chopped 1/3 red, 1/3 yellow, and 1/3 green peppers.  Will remember next time to have all ingredients cooked, chopped and ready before starting my roux.  I added the chicken the same time I added the other ingredients and only simmered uncovered for 1 hour, stirring often.  Gumbo was even better the next day.  Thanks so much for this recipe!

I've made this twice in the last 6 weeks, the second time by request.  I haven't even tasted it because it's gone so fast.  I was asked to make again but I just passed on the recipe.   I made it a day ahead, added shrimp when I rewarmed it.  Roasted the bones from the chicken and the chells from the shrimp and added to chicken broth to make stock  - I here it was the best gumbo ever! Thanks!

I don't know where I went wrong but the 1 cup of oil just ruined this dish for me.  It had a very oily feeling in my mouth that I did not care for.  I used Canola oil and had no problem achieving the chocolate color that other reviewers said was a must after 25 minutes of cooking the roux.  I followed the recipe  exactly and it smelled delicious but I just could not stomach the oily feel and taste in my mouth when I ate it. Tried serving the leftovers with rice but that didn't help it.  I will try using a recipe with less oil next time.

Topnotch recipe.  I messed up the roux on the first go but got it right the 2nd time.  My market had no andouille sausage so I used 1 lb of Hillshire Farms Hot Kielbasa.  I added a handful of chopped parsley after the first half-hour of the roux simmering and then a 1/2 pound of shrimp, another handful of chopped parsley, and 1 lb of frozen, but thawed fist, cut okra during the last 5 minutes of cooking. You get this roux down and you are set for life.

The writer didn't mention quantities for salt, pepper, or Cajun seasoning so we added them somewhat sparingly and it was enough, the sausage itself provides lots of seasoning/flavor.  Wonderful stuff. 

We made this for 4 people last night who all enjoyed it immensley and we're having it again for dinner (2)and expect there still be some leftovers so it's not that expensive in the end.

This recipe was wonderful everyone loved this. I did make some additions I added okra and sauteed shrimp at the very end. Also added gumbo file to individual servings. Next time I will cook the roux longer.

This is basically my recipe for gumbo with a couple of changes.....I make a microwave roux.   mix the oil and the flour in an 8 cup PYREX glass bowl..stir well.....cook for 7-10 minutes until dark as you would like.   Be very careful,,  burns easily...  Use thighs in making my stock.   Use Tony Chaceres Creole seasoning.....DO not add salt till after tasting.  ..add 2 t. thyme,    1-3 t. cayenne pepper.  Use chicken, andouille sausage....  add 1 pkg frozen okra (sliced) as soon as broth is added.    Cook for 2-4 hours....When you can no longer see the okra, the gumbo is done....I may need to add more broth.   Keep an eye on the thickness,    Then add the peeled shrimp and turn off the heat....The shrimp doesn't need to boil.......  I like to use a cast iron dutch oven for cooking this.....I learned this in NO,  liven in LA for 35 years....LOVE MY GUMBO!!!    GEAUX SAINTS!!!

This is a new family favorite! Keep in mind though the recipe says feeds 10 - if you have teenagers, I would say this feeds eight. I serve it over rice (I'd suggest doubling your usual rice as a side dish serving). Also, it freezes really well. I've made it, frozen the left overs (just the gumbo, not the rice) and had a second dinner from it.

I noticed a few people had challenges with the roux - you MUST be patient and pay attention. It does take at least eight minutes, keep stirring over that medium heat. I would suggest, unless you have a second pair of hands to stir while you dice other ingredients - be sure you have the other ingredients ready to go before you start the roux.

I have been making gumbo for a long time. This is a good recipe for a rustic gumbo.....but only use a half cup oil and flour. The same thickening effect will happen! One cup of oil will leave oil on your teeth. This recipe after simmering is for 4 servings....that much oil is disgusting. Try a half-cup, oil/flour roux and the rest is pretty dang on point. Simple, rustic gumbo. I have made plenty of gumbo for 8-10 people with just a half cup of oil and flour.

I am a true cajun and just have to throw in some good pointers. File' should be put on the table along w/ the salt, pepper, & butter (butter? read on)  so each person can add it as they like it. File' is used as an "thickening agent" as well as a spice so if your gumbo is not thick enough for one then they can add file' to thicken it. Also, gumbo should be served w/ rice but it is a MUST that gumbo be served w/ a baked sweet potatoe as well. Serve the sweet potatoe on a saucer (with butter ;)) on it and each bite of gumbo should have a little piece of sweet potatoe in it. I just throw the potatoe in my gumbo when eating. I also like to add eggs in my chicken and sausage gumbo. While the gumbo is boiling just crack the raw eggs and drop in the gumbo or you can boil them first, peel and drop in. Also, chicken & sausage gumbo should not have seafood in it; if you want seafood in it then you should make a seafood gumbo. Cant beat true cajun food!

I've been making this dish for years and it seriously doesn't get any better than this. Please take everyone's advice and follow the directions for the roux. I know it's a pain because it just takes so long, but that's where you'll be getting your true gumbo flavor. To help it along, you can brown your flour in the oven on a cookie sheet the day before but just make sure you watch it carefully. This method will help get you to that very rich and dark color a bit faster. My only addition to the recipe is the traditional okra for thickening purposes. This also works beautifully with leftover Thanksgiving turkey and if you have any turkey gravy left, don't be afraid to throw that in too! Served over rice this is total comfort food. Thank you so much!

Made this tonight; KEEPER!! I searched for a cajun/jambalaya/gumbo recipe without tomatoes; this was a little greasy, but tasty. Five stars, but use plain rice, because rice from a mix will be too salty.

This was really wonderful.  I did make a few changes for the ingredients I had on hand and for preferences of my kids (hide the veges).  I reduced the oil and flour to to 2/3 cup, I chopped 1 onion, 4 cloves of garlic, 2 carrots, 2 stalks celery & 2 green peppers in my food processor until faily fine.  After I cooked the oil/flour mixture, I added the vegetables & then the sausage, it was very thick and somewhat gooey - I was a little worried.  I added the chicken stock and spices and let cook for about 45 min.  I still wasn't wasn't thrilled with the way it looked, so I added paprika, a couple dashes of hot sauce and 1/2 cup white rice with chopped cooked chicken tenderlions.  Toward the end of the hour I added crab meat and about a cup of cooked brown rice.  Wow - it turned out great, the kids and husband loved it.

Traditional Cajun gumbo starts with raw chicken. It is browned, then the rue is made in the rendered chicken fat and added fat.  The chicken pieces are left whole.  Otherwise, it's great.  Thanks for not making a Creole gumbo out of it by adding tomatoes and okra.  That is also good, but it ain't CAJUN.

Finally a traditional southern gumbo! It just irritates me to see all the gumbo recipes with tomatoes! A REAL gumbo does not have a tomatoes!!!!!
I also do not measure any ingredients. I boil 6 chicken thighs ,season the water with celery,onion, garlic(lots),salt and nature seasoning.remove chicken when done and debone. Add the meat back in the broth you just made. Cut up any sausage you like and add that also. Keep it warming.  I make a really thick and dark roux but my family loves a strong tasting gumbo. I don't use a cup of oil and flour. I use about half a cup of oil and sprinkle flour while stiring until I have almost a paste consistency. Then I cook in a cast iron skillet on med-low and wisk constantly for quite a while. When it is the color I want(we do dark chocolate) and right before it burns I throw in the trinity! The onion will keep the roux from burning. I cook that for just a few minutes and add it to my slightly boiling stock pot of chicken and sausage. Stir it up to mix in the roux.After it simmers for a while grease may come to the top. I just keep skimming it off. Most times I make a second roux with bacon grease and add that to the simmering gumbo. It gives a really nice flavor.  I usually add tony cachere's but that's the only heat type seasoning we use. We always serve ours OVER potato salad not rice. The flavors of the two together will knock your socks off!! And sometimes I boil extra eggs and throw those in the gumbo. And it freezes well too!

I love this recipe, but hate all the stirring, so I went out and spent $9.99 on a Robo Stir just so I could make this recipe more often!  (I use it for the first 8-10 min. of stirring).

Born and raised in New Iberia,LA....a TRUE Cajun,and let me tell you,this is how I've always made gumbo.always a crowd pleaser.we like our roux VERY dark,so be patient,don't touch the heat,and keep stirring your roux.good things come to those who wait:) we also use raw chicken,thrown into the pot once stock is at a rice rolling boil.the longer you cook,the better it gets:) thanks for sharing!

This was my first time making gumbo and it turned out great!  I followed the recipe exactly (I thought) until my roux didn't come out, but I got it right the second time - just needed higher heat!  Originally I just threw some chicken in the slow cooker but realized I had all the ingredients for this recipe (I used Tony Chachere's spice) SO happy I tried it, will be a regular dish now!

I love to try different gumbo's and this one is close to my mom's so I give this cajun girl (YOYO78) a 5 star!  Making gumbo truly comes from the heart.  All I changed was I added some Slap Ya Mamma seasoning and let it cook all day long.

This gumbo is so yummy!  I followed the advice of another reviewer and cooked the rue a little longer, until it was a reddish-brown color.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe to a "T" and it was fabulous.  Served it with crusty bread...yum, yum.  Can't wait to make it again.

My husband made this tonight (perhaps that's where the problem started, haha!) and it didn't turn out very good at all.  It tasted like bland gravy with mushy sausage in it.  It didn't have very much flavor.  Perhaps he needed to go heavy on the seasoning.  Won't make again.

This is more like cream of gumbo...not for us.  I have never made it before, so I just went with it as a rookie, but this is not southern LA gumbo. Too thick and oily.  Recommend you keep searching recipes.

I have been making this dish for 15 years with a recipe from my dear friend Diane from Lafayette, Louisiana.  I don't add extra garlic, because the flavor of the sausage with the chicken is both delicate and delicious. 4 comments: 1) potato salad & rice 2) Tony Chachere's creole seasoning (salted or unsalted available) the 4th member of the cajun quartet. 3) Get your broth from a backing hen or fryer.  I cook till the bones are soft and you get the flavor from skin, bones, everything. 4) Since moving to Chicago, I found Johnsonville makes a quality andouille sausage.  Hooooweeeee  dat's good gumbo!

As a former resident of the New Orleans area, I must say this is FANTASTIC!  Love it, love it, love it!  I did not add the bell pepper (personal preference) but because it was so thick, I did have to add a cup of water so it could simmer the amount of time stated.  However, I just noticed a post by the author of this recipe suggesting to half the oil and flour if you like it thinner.  Thanks for sharing such a superb recipe!  I can't wait to make it again!  
Update:  Just made this again tonight.  This time I used only 1/2 cup oil (bacon grease) and 1/2 cup flour as the author later suggested in post.  I also used 2 tsp Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning and 1 tsp liquid Crab Boil and added frozen okra.  Everything else was exactly as directed.  Wow!  This was the perfect blend of flavor, spice, and consistency.  My husband who normally does not like spicy foods loved this amount of spice.   This is spicy enough for me to enjoy and mild enough for him to enjoy as well.  Excellent served over hot cooked rice.  Thanks for an authentic and awesome recipe!!  I highly recommend this recipe.
Update #2: I have made this many times now. We still love it!  However, taking the advice from a reviewer here (Forgot the name, sorry), I made the roux in the oven! I started in a cast iron Dutch oven on the stove as usual. I used 3/4 cup veg oil and 3/4 cup flour. Once blended, I set the pot into a preheated oven at 375 for an hour, stirring every 20 minutes.  It was perfect and so much easier

This was my first experience with Gumbo, and we were very satisfied. I followed the recipe exactly, but found that the gumbo turned out very very thick. I had to double the chicken broth to give it a stewy texture. I added leftover rice to it and stored it in the fridge, but when reheating I found that It was way to thick again. I added even more broth to it to thin it out again. Aside from that, the flavor was very good, and we will be eating it again and again.

I tried this last night and it was a success! I wish I had cooked the roux longer. I was afraid that I might burn it, but the "chocolate milk" color was not long enough. I added some okra, which is a must for gumbo as far as I am concerned. I also threw in some shrimp at the end. A good authentic gumbo recipe!

I have been making this recipe for a long time and it is a huge hit at our house.  My kids cheer when I say we're having gumbo for dinner!  I make the recipe exactly as is except to add okra sometimes.  It took a few times to really get the roux like we like it just because I was afraid to burn it.  We serve it over rice and usually make a corn bread to go with it...Cajun/Texas style!  Thank you for this wonderful recipe!!!!!!

This is very, very good.  I took other reviewer's advice and cooked the roux a little longer, letting it get darker (20 mins).  Also, I used chicken drumsticks - didn't have a rotisserie chicken.  I browned them in oil and put them in with the sausage & veggies.  The meat fell off the bones!  I understand creole seasoning or file is best, but being in Connecticut, it's not easy to find so I used the "Simple Cajun Seasoning" mix (1 tbsp) from this website.  It reminds me of my mom's gumbo, which she learned from my Cajun dad's family in Welsh, LA

This is the real deal darlin!  But I don't make my own roux anymore. Makes your house smell for days & it's easier to buy.  Look for Tony Chachere's products at your grocery store... you'll save yourself a ton of time!

I have made this several times and have to now double the recipe because it goes so fast in my house.   I made a few changes though: (remember this is for a doubles recipe)  3 Large white onions, 2 Large heads of garlic rough chopped, Olive oil instead of corn or vegetable oil, About a pound and a half of shrimp, HALF a cup of the creole seasoning!  Just to let you know, if you want to try it with the olive oil it will have an awful smell at the start. I almost threw it out right then but it browned so nicely that my husband insisted we give it a try. I like my roux very dark like the color of melted  chocolate, so after it darkened I added the rest and cooked it up. It was fantastic. Much better than I expected-with that horrible smell at the beginning and all....  Thank you for a fantastic recipe!!!!

This is the first attempt I've had at making a gumbo (or a roux for that matter!). After looking up recipe after recipe, this one looked simple, straight forward, and based on just ingrediants and reviews sounded flat out tasty.   And wow, what a treat!   The only real modifications I made to this was adding some Okra that I had chopped up and sauteed for a few minutes into the dish when I had about 20 min left to go on it (When I put on the rice).    The auroma of the dish was just everywhere, and it was such a pleasant and authentic thing. My friend who I had invited over to help "Test" this recpie said he could smell something good cooking inside even outside my front door.   Hours after it started, we finally ate...and you could tell that this was a "Food of love" kind of thing. It turned out just the right consistancy with loads of sausage and chicken, and a robust flavor that can only be associated with Lousiana.   It's easy to do, and absolutely delicious! And those hours of waiting are worth it at the end when you have a bite and say to yourself "I'd pay top dollar at a restaurant for this"

Excellent authentic cajun gumbo recipe.  I used a smoked chicken (because I had one on hand) and it gave it a nice, faint smoky flavor.  Be sure to cook the roux thoroughly and get it good and dark.

I juiced this up just a bit, I used some pork that I smoked on my smoker in place of chicken, I also used turkey drippings, from turkeys I smoked at thanksgiving, in place of chicken broth.  Also added Okra, and a teaspoon of file powder.  delicious!

The best Gumbo I have ever had was in - Germany.  Stationed there, my room mate was from LA and his Cajun wife visited.  That Gumbo she made was life altering.  A few years later, I visited New Orleans and was utterly disappointed in the Gumbo there.  In the 25 years since, I haven't had any good Gumbo.

Until now.  I am a total noob when it comes to cooking stuff like this and didn't even know what roux was, much less how to make it.  YoYo's instructions were right on the money.  After reading comments here, I followed the recipe closely.  I used 3/4 cup canola oil and whole wheat flower for the roux.  Instead of cutting the onions and bell peppers myself, I used a bag of frozen ones from Trader Joes.  Otherwise, it was pretty much as Yoyo specified. When she says use low sodium broth, she means it.  I used regular broth the first time and it came out way to salty.  Pick a brand with less than 200mg sodium per cup.

While liking the ingredients for this soup, we wanted to cut some calories from the high amount of fat associated with making the roux. We also noted some reviewers felt the soup was too oily for their tastes. We decided to go w/ 1/3 cup safflower oil & 1/3 cup ap flour, saving about 1,575 calories from the dish or 158 calories per serving. The good instructions made the roux easy to make. Aidell’s Spicy Mango with Jalapeno Sausage was used. Otherwise, we followed the recipe. While our soup wasn’t as thick given less roux, it was packed with superb flavor and made a super delicious soup. We’ll be making this again!! Jodi, thanks a bunch for a fantastic recipe.

This turned out kind of slimy (even though I cooked the okra a long time - it never got unslimy) and had a odd texture.  It also didn't have a great flavor - it was just alright.  I won't make it again

Tried this recipe today and this definitely hit the spot. I added jumbo shrimp in at the final 6 minutes and it was great.... Had to add more Cajun/old bay/cayenne along with the creole seasonings to kick this up a notch but the base is very well balanced.

Pretty good!! But why put Creole seasoning in a Cajun gumbo? Use Cajun seasoning!

This was great stuff! Took an awfully long time, and my SO and I felt it was missing the addition of shrimp, which are the reasons I felt it just missed the 5 star mark. Having said that, it's even better the second day, when the flavors have gotten acquainted. We added some shrimp to the leftovers and we were not disappointed!

UPDATE: MADE LUPE'S GUMBO ON HERE AND THIS ONE FAR SURPASSES IT! WITH A BIT OF TWEAKING, THIS CAN KICK BUTT!!! :) This was allright. A while back, my hubs made a FANTASTIC gumbo, but as with most things he makes, he forgets to save the recipe. :( We've both been craving Cajun food lately, so I decided to give this a try. While not terrible, this just doesn't compare. Contrary to some reviewer's comments about greasiness, I disagree. My gumbo wasn't oily at all but it did lack heat (apparently 1 T Cajun seasoning isn't enough for us...) and was quite thick. As YoYo suggested, I decreased my oil / flour mixture, but to to 3/4 c. rather than a 1/2 c. of each (we like our gumbo somewhat soupy). After the first hour of simmering, I had to add ANOTHER c. of broth (most of my liquid had evaporated!)!!! If I make this again, I'll DEFINITELY use less flour / oil and / or decrease the amount of chicken called for (it soaked up a LOT of juic!). NOTE: I was apprehensive aobut making my own roux, but it's really easy! Simply start by heating your oil on MEDIUM heat and then GRADUALLY add your flour, whisking well to incorporate. You can increase the heat to medium-high, but be sure to closely watch your roux (you don't want it to burn!). The darker the roux, the more intense the flavor will be. Served over rice with a side of macaroni salad and fresh baked French bread, this was a decent meal. I guess this will suit us until we find that darn Emeril recipe lol! Thanks, YoYo78! :-)

Added chicken and shrimp to the recipe just to bulk it up a little more and my husband LOVES it.  He probably requests it once a month, and it takes us three days to finish it off!  The roux is actually quite easy - just stir constantly with a whisk and watch the color.  Once it's roughly the color of milk chocolate, you're ready to move on.

We really enjoyed this! After reading all the other reviews I think I will add less oil next time.  I used about 3/4 cup of vegetable oil and 1/4 cup of olive oil.  I also added some okra near the end.  We will make this again.

I made this gumbo tonight, bu I made the roux this morning before work to speed things along. It took me about 30 min to achieve milk choc. color instead of 10. *TIP - after sitting in the fridge, the excess oil in my roux floated to the top and I was able to skim it off, so I think you could use less than 1 cup of oil to begin with! Other than that the only change was that I only cooked the whole thing 1 hr. instead of 2. I had a couple bottles of hot sauce at the table so we could adjust the heat to our individual tastes. Delish!

This was such a fantstic dinner. I absolutely recommend this recipe. And it's great because you can add other veggies (such as Okra) to it because it's versatile. We didn't do anything different than the recipe called for and would make this again and again, no question!

It was good but not great.  I would make it again since it wasn't too expensive but it's not something I would make regularly.  Maybe next time I will make this in the crockpot.

This is a good basic recipe.  I cooked my roux for about 25 minutes and it was still too light.  I will cook it longer or use the premade kind when I make this again.  I used 4 chicken breasts I had boiled in cajun seasoning.  The next time I make this I will add gumbo vegetables.  This recipe was tasty, it was just missing something.  Be careful with the salt as cajun and creole seasoning contains a good bit anyway.

This gumbo was surprisingly easy to make.  My roux came out perfect the first time, I was patient with the stirring process!  I did not put any sausage in the gumbo and it still came out great.  I did however added a bag of frozen okra to the simmering pot and poured it over rice once it was done.

OH MY!!! I am currently working in Iraq and I had the incrediants sent over to me.  I only had one shot of getting this right....it was perfect.  I followed to a T with the exception I added a little extra cajun seasoning just cause we like it a little extra spicey.  Served over white rice with a glass of ice tea....can't go wrong!!!  Thank you so much for sharing.

Don't let the simplicity of this recipe fool you.  My Louisianan friends love this.  Everytime I make it, I get asked for the recipe.  Just remember, the final outcome of your gumbo is dependent on your roux.  So take your time with it, baby it, and let it get nice and dark.  Now, I'm off to make this recipe for today's Superbowl.

This tastes SO GOOD!!  I only gave it 4 stars because the recipe as stated has way too much oil in my opinion.  I cut it down to 1/3 C oil and an equal amount of flour.  It still had that wonderful roux taste without so much fat. The instructions are exactly right - if you start to burn the roux, start again.  Otherwise it's like eating slightly burnt popcorn - it ruins the whole thing.  I used chicken breast instead of a whole chicken to also significantly reduce the fat.  Additionally, I browned the sausage and drained off the fat.  Don't get me wrong - I LOVE a bit of grease in my food! Just not so much of it. I didn't feel like it was lacking anything the way I prepared it.

As most do, I made some changes per my own tastes.  I did not use the bay leaf (I find them too strong in non-beef dishes) and added some crushed red pepper, cayenne and used Tony's as my creole seasoning.  This dish turned out AMAZING.  It is a very thick Gumbo (I wasn't expecting that, I am used to more a broth, light soup) and I loved it.  I did have to add an extra 1.5 cups of water to allow it full simmer so will likely 1/2 the roux next time (and there WILL be a next time).  Fabulous flavor, great texture and the leftovers today are awesome (reheats well).

We loved it even my 1and 3 year olds ate it. thankyou for a great recipe!!Well we froze about half of what was made and relized once we thawed it out that if you freeze this recipe you ought to make twice the sauce becuase the meat will soak alot it up..Still very good though..

This is the best recipe I have found. I did change it a little. I left out the green bell pepper and celery stalks.I added 2 cans of Rotel. I also used the left over oil from cooking the sausage to complete the recommended 1 cup of oil for the roux.

Haven't actually eatten it yet, dunno if I will to tell you the truth.  The directions are misleading.  "Chocolate milk" is not that dark, at all!  I waiting until it was the color of chocolate milk, and now it's way to thick.

I agree with ggmom2.  This came out WAY TOO THICK!!  Gumbo is supposed to have a gravy consistency, so I'm not sure if I did something incorrectly, or the recipe calls for cooking it too long.  I think if you add the sausage and chicken at the same time and then cook for one hour, you'll be good.  I'm going to try this recipe again and try it that way. The flavor was awesome, but the texture/consistency was off.

Excellent recipe.  My family loved it.  Instead of using the oil for the roux, I used butter.

Delicious!  I was able to modify it for the slow cooker (I work until 6:30PM).
I made the roux, added the pepper, onion, celery, black pepper and seasoning, and stirred for 5+ minutes.  Meanwhile, the chicken broth, chicken, sausage, garlic and bay leaf all went into the slow cooker set on low.  When the roux and veggies were ready, I scraped the saucepan contents into the slow cooker, stirred it in, and let it cook for the day on low.  What a fabulous smell to come home to!

If you are looking for a good Gumbo recipe, stop now. This is it.

Can you make changes...of course. Additions rather than subtractions as the basic requirements are covered in the recipe. Feel like a handful of shrimp or other seafood? Go for it! More garlic? Yes sir:-)

I am making it again right now...don't have a whole chicken but do have 3 chicken breasts...in there. And a large handful of shrimp for sure. Hot white rice on the side is a good thing.

Really an excellent recipe!

Cook the roux longer than suggested. I kept cooking the roux even after it was brown. Reduced it a bit, and really cooked out the trinity (onions peppers celery). My wife will not eat anything with onions, pepper nor celery, and she loved this gumbo. Reminded us of our visit to Lafeyette LA many years ago. I will make this recipe again.

This is wonderful... My family loved it.  I cut the oil in half for the roux...used Tony's for the seasoning.  Simmered cubed chicken breast in a little water in a frying pan then threw it in the gumbo about 45 min before it was done. Use long grain rice cooked in chicken broth.   I quadrupled this recipe in a stock pot.  It's even better the next day.

Pretty Awesome!  Just finished eating 2 bowls and the family loved it!  Read most of the ratings and tried a few ideas with success.  Plus being from N.O. I knew right off the bat what extras I needed.  Fried the sausage prior, added 1 tbs of seasoning, 1/4 tsp red pepper, 1/4 tsp thyme, 30min before done added okra, 5min before done added shrimp.  Instructions were dead-on and easy to follow.  You rock YOYO78!  Thanks for sharing.

Turned out great! I Used a lb. chicken and took it out and shredded it with a fork after an hour instead of the rotisserie chicken. Only complaint is it was a little salty. Next time
I think I'll use unsalted chicken broth

Awesome recipe. I made it exactly as written, though it took about 17 minutes (constantly whisking) to get the roux where it needed to be.  Everyone raved about it. Thanks!

Made this on Saturday with leftover Turkey.  AWESOME!   I did go for the darker roux just an additional 10 mins or so.  I used a cup of butter in lieu of the oil for the roux.

Made a couple changes based on the reviews.  Thank you for this recipe...easy to follow and so incredibly tasty!!! There is so much debate on what makes a "real" gumbo...I could care less, this tastes delicious to me! ??.

I've been using this recipe for a few years now - LOVE that it has NO tomatoes!  I only add 4 Cu chicken broth b/c I like my gumbo a bit thicker and I add raw chicken with chicken broth, bring to boil and simmer for a few hours, add cooked shrimp and 1/2 bag frozen okra about 30 min from end - serve over white rice = DELISH!

This is a great gumbo recipe. But like another review said, I would halve the roux. I used 2 lbs. shreaded chicken and 1-1/2 lbs. of sausage. Could have used a little more. Good job.

MMM...MMM...GOOD! I only used half a large yellow onion and did not simmer for more than a 45 minutes total. Thick enough with 1 cup of flour. I served it over farro instead of white rice.

this is a wonderful recipe! I was born and raised in new orleans, this taste like the restaurant that doesnt use dark roux!!!! and the only thing I did differently was adding okra to the gumbo.

Update: **** 6/2/15 okay so I made
This gumbo a lot! And I made changes. When I feel like being a little healthy I use whole wheat flour! And I opt for frozen veggies
Instead of fresh bc it's quicker! It's still good!!

I made this as written a few weeks ago and we really enjoyed this. We are from the Northwest, and have never had authentic Gumbo, so I have no reference to go by! But this did remind me of something my Mom made called chicken a la king. So, I decided to make this with leftover Christmas turkey and leftover ham instead of sausage. I also added the leftover gravy and added water to the gravy to make up for the 6 cups of broth (and made half the roux). We served it over rice and it tasted great! I would recommend everyone with leftover turkey dinner to make this, great as written too! :)

Never made gumbo before but this is delicious.  It was a last minute thing and we didn't have the bell pepper or the celery but it still was very tasty and so easy to make.  I skimmed about 6oz of grease from the top while it was simmering but if I had left it in it would still have been delicious!  This is a keeper!

I adjusted by adding less oil and more flour. Also adding double the chicken stock to make it thinner and lots of seasoning. It was really good! Will make again.

This is the first time I have made a gumbo much less a roux and I was a little intimidated. I had some great gumbo in Texas and have wanted to take a stab at it for a long time. You HAVE to make this, it is AWESOME!!!!!!!!!! It was time consuming, but SO worth the effort. Thanks for the Great Recipe.

The great thing about gumbo is that you can play with this recipes to create something you truly like. For everyone who complained, this recipe is more of a guide more than following it to a "T". It is hard to mess up gumbo, just have fun with it!!

Great recipe. I have two suggestions. I usually smoke the chicken and make the stock out of the smoked carcass. Probably the best suggestion is to BAKE the roux. Found this on the internet and it works great. Heat oven to 400 then mix flour and oil in a cast iron dutch oven or what ever pot you can put in the oven. Every 15 minutes stir the mixture until you get the color you want - usually 1 to 1 1/2 hours for a dark roux. IT IS A NO FAIL WAY TO DO ROUX. No splatter, no mess. While you wait, you can prep all your veggies and then take the pot out of the oven and put it on the stove.

This recipe is so wonderful!! For a first time gumbo-maker, it was so easy to follow. Roux worked out perfect. I prepared as listed, except using Canola oil and Chicken breasts (as that was what I had on hand). Received numerous compliments/raves. Will try again exactly as listed. This recipe is a keeper.

Yum! Made for Fat Tuesday fun & was a big hit. If you lower heat after oil is hot, your roux will not burn, but will take approx 30 minutes. Thanks to reviewer who suggested making roux in advance and all of you who recommended less oil and more Creole seasoning. Topped gumbo with chopped green onion tops; served with yellow rice and 1/2 small sweet potato with butter (traditional) on the side. THE BEST!

I decided to make this gumbo recipe on Valentines Day for my boyfriend from Louisiana...yes that takes a lot of faith in my fellow reviewers!  I followed the recipe with the exception of adding 1 extra stalk of celery and 1 tablespoon of the Creole seasoning (instead of to taste cuz I had no idea what it was supposed to take like).  WELL...My boyfriend called his mom in Louisiana after tasting my gumbo to tell her how amazing it was.  Wahoo!!! Thank you to the author of this recipe.  I served it with a blend of white and brown rice and a side of potato salad (heavy on the mustard) as they do in New Orleans.  Thank you!!!  Can't wait to make it again.  ****My roux cooked for in excess of 30 minutes though...took a lot longer to reach that dark color than 10 minutes****

Very tasty! In all honesty, it's not exactly a traditional gumbo. It is much thicker and creamier than what I am used to when it comes to gumbo. We did enjoy it though. Thanks for sharing!

Excellent recipe.. I had to use what I had on hand so I made some changes that turned out GREAT and my family loved it.. I used 7 bullion cubes and 8 cups of water instead of 6 cups broth.. I made my own creole seasoning and put about 3 palm full, maybe about 3 or 4 tablespoon. And instead of celery I dumped in a can of corn, and instead of cooking the rice separate. I dumped it right in the pot. It was soooo good. I saved it and will be making this again.. Oh yeah, and I used left over turkey from Christmas instead of chicken :D Waste not want not! Great recipe.. Thank you!

So good!  I wasn't going for 'traditional' gumbo, I just had smoked sausage I had to use up and so I searched and this came up - delicious! I added red beans (which I know would horrify anyone looking for traditional, but so good!) and a can of green chilies.  I used two tablespoons of penzies cajun seasoning & a tsp of salt.  Served over white rice - loved it!

I'm not a great cook, but I followed this recipe very close, making sure not to burn the roux.  I made this Gumbo three times, and to my delight everyone who eaten it loved it and wanted the recipe.  I love orka, so I added orka, but thats the only thing I did to different from the orginial recipe.

OK... next time we will use only half the roux as originally called for. I scorched the first batch so my husband (from southern LA) made the second batch for me. We added a lb of okra towards the end. I was afraid of how much NuNu's to put in so used very sparingly... next time we will at LEAST double the 1/2t. we did use. We didn't use chicken broth just water. Also I was instructed (by hubby) to leave out the bay leaf therefore we just tossed in the already cooked chicken and simmered for the one hour. after the hour we had to add another 1 1/2 cup water.. it turned into something resembling gravy and after the water still a little too thick. But did smell delicious! I can't wait to make this again!!! Even my picky runts ate it up so definitely worth trying!

This is so delicious!!!  By the time I was ready to add my stock my roux looked like dark chocolate.  I was worried I had taken it too far, but all it did was make this gumbo super rich and flavorful.  I only had a red bell pepper so I used that and I couldn't pass up on adding some okra either!  I used chicken breast that I chopped up and quickly pan fried.  I used homemade chicken stock and threw in a little cayenne for some heat.  Served over rice and we both ate two huge bowls!  Very yummy, thanks!

I love this recipe but the last time I made it, I made my roux in the oven with NO oil.  Being on Weight Watchers, this reduced the points considerably and you really couldn't tell the difference!  I also used two 32-oz containers of chicken broth - it was great!  It's a recipe I'll continue to make!

Turns out 8-10 minutes doesn't get me that chocolate brown roux. Ended up with blonde roux. No biggie, used it along with some extra ingredients and was extremely pleased with the result. I imagine it will be even better next time!

THis was an excellent recipe. I've always wanted to try making a gumbo but didn't find one with just the right ingredients until this one. The family loved it. I thnk the andouille sausage really makes the dish.

My 6-year-old and I really liked this a lot, but I agree with my Cajun husband that it was a little thicker than gumbo is supposed to be.  I'll make it again for sure, but will probably thin it out with some broth or water to suit his tastes.    If you are looking for something the consistency of a stew this will probably suit your tastes, otherwise be prepared to add more liquid than the recipe calls for.  Also, I omitted the salt and used 1 1/2 tsp. of Tony Chacherie's seasoning and the spice was just right.

This recipe is absolutely spectacular. It was my first time making chicken gumbo, and I was completely blown away by how easy and simple it was.   I made some polenta fries (similar to toasted polenta) to accompany the gumbo, and it tasted FABULOUS. This recipe is a keeper!  Try it, and you will not be disappointed!

I've never made gumbo before and tried this for dinner tonight! It is magically delicious- my ten and thirteen year olds loved it! I thought I'd be hoity toity and use olive oil- because I'm a novice I found out NOT to do this. It doesn't *work* the same way as crisco. Crisco was the deal though and I ended up looking like a freaking genius! I did add a pound of fresh shrimp there at the end. YUMMY!

My husband thought that it was really good.   I didn't add the celery, not a big fan of it.  I added olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  Also, added shrimp to it:)  I thought it was super easy to make.  Made my house smell amazing:)

Wow, this is great stuff!  I just finished my first bowl made just as the recipe states, with just one exception:  Leave out the salt and pepper and just season with the creole seasoning.  I use the recipe from foodnetwork created by the Louisiana chef whose name starts with the letter 'E'.  It has salt and pepper components in it, so I just wanted to avoid making it too salty while allowing the creole seasoning to come through.  For everyone who says it takes an hour to get a dark roux, I submit that everyone's stove is different; I had a nice chocolate roux in about 20-25 minutes.  One other minor difference, I baked two chicken halves that were seasoned generously with Tony's (another cajun seasoning that you Louisiana folks will know well) and used those instead of the rotisserie chicken.  Came out fantastic, and way more stew-like than the photo.  The only other minor qualm I have with this recipe:  Where's the hot sauce?  I added some fire at the end.  Now back to the kitchen for seconds.

This was A++ it was the hit of the Super Bowl party last night!  I did add about a pound of shrimp, a pound of crab meat, and a pound of cut frozen okra but followed this basic recipe.  Very good!

As far as ingredients go this can change up for or with anything you want (the greatness of gumbo). The one thing that should never change is the roux it must be chocolate brown that is the key that must be turned to open your best gumbo door.

Hooray, this is very like the gumbo I grew up with and still make.  My roux is the color of a bar of chocolate before I add my veges.  We didn't have rotisserie chicken!  Now I boil my chicken the day before, put in the fridge overnight, and take off the fat before using.  This is just our preference for less fat these days.  Growing up, my mom just threw the chicken pieces in the gumbo and let it cook.  Thanks for submitting this recipe.  I, too, get so tired of so-called "cajun" recipes that are nothing like anything I ever saw in southwest La.

I have been making this for the past few years and it is delicious. I do use chicken tenderloin and boneless skinless chicken thighs.  I use a good brand of andouille sausage and I add medium shrimp.  For an extra kick I add Thi Garlic Chili sauce. I season all my meat when browning with a good Creole seasoning. Enjoy

Excellent authentic recipe for down home cajun gumbo. Thanks so much for sharing it.. I did add some Slap Your Mama as my seasoning and some file and okra, but that's just my family's preference. Great recipe thanks again.

Very tasty! I added some carrot and okra in there because I just like it. It was a bit too oily so maybe I'll half the oil and flour in my roux next time. I also used Hillshire Farms Smoked Sausage in place of the andouille sausage. Went easy on the salt but heavy on the cayenne pepper (I had to make my own Creole seasoning). Served it with rice. Taste even better the next day! Thanks for the recipe.

I love this recipe. I found a roux cheat on the Internet that comes out every time without burning. I use 1 cup oil and flour and microwave it for 6 minutes on high then stir. keep heating until you have the desired color but stir every 20 or 30 seconds. I also like hot italian sausage and a rotisserie chicken. I use 1 TBS of Creole seasoning. I serve over Zatarain's New Orleans style red beans and rise. LOVE IT!

While the flavor was good, I found this gumbo to be very oily.  If I make it again, I will use butter.

I made this after work one day and took the express route. I fixed it in about an hour. To save on time, I cut chicken breast into bite size pieces and cooked it in the pot. Overall this came out really great and had the "cajun" taste I was looking for. Instead of pepper and salt, I substituted Tony Chachere's. Very Good!!

This was absolutely delicious, even though I left out celery and green peppers. It truly hit the spot-made it 2 ways chicken and sausage for the kids and then added shrimp and okra for the adults.  Also added whole boiled eggs, a tip from the only cajun I know.

Just made this today!  Phenomenal!  I used boneless, skinless, diced chicken breasts and added okra towards the end. I am a former New Orleanian, and I must say this is about as authentic as it gets.  Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe!

I really did not like this dish.  My husband and I threw the left overs away.  Too be fair, I had never tried gumbo before and maybe it is that I don't like gumbo and not this specific recipe of gumbo.

My husband LOVED this served over brown rice! I thought it was good too but couldn't eat much of it--a bit too spicy. I used fresh-made andouille from Whole Foods--in the future I might try this recipe with milder sausage but I'm torn on that, as andouille has that indescribable flavor that says "Creole" food to me that my bottle of Cajun spice mix does not contain! I was overall very impressed with this recipe and am sure I will make it again :)

This is an excellent recipe, especially for someone who has never mad gumbo, and might fall into the 'add tomato' trap so frequently deployed by ignorance. Although, i substituted the celery for okra, and added a/b 2 lbs of shrimp. Came out great, even better the next day. My sister even came over to have some.

I've made this recipe twice to great success!  The first time was after our trip to New Orleans and my husband came back craving for gumbo.  I was very vigilant with the roux and it turned out very well for my first time!  Instead of canned chicken broth, I boiled some chicken quarters and skimmed and skimmed, and used that instead of the (canned) broth and rotisserie chicken.  I seasoned with some old dollar store Cajun spice which was probably very weak, and added some cayenne (no bay leaf).  Near the end of cooking, I added a bag of frozen okra.   The second time was for a potluck.  After making the roux (had to try twice...first time burned) and adding the veggies to sautee, I divided the mixture up so I can make half chicken and sausage and half vegetarian.  For seasoning, this time I just used garlic salt, pepper, and old bay seasoning.  For the regular one, I was short on time so didn't make the broth...I added one can of chicken broth and just water, as that came to a simmer, I added 2lbs and sliced raw chicken breast.  I also used a mix of hot and sweet Italian sausage prebrowned and sliced.  Added the okra at the end.  In the vegetarian one, I put in carrots, sliced mushrooms, a can of black eyed peas and a can of kidney beans, along with the okra.    This made a lot...our potluck was for 9 people and after eating and requests to bring some home, my husband was mad that he didn't even have enough left for lunch the next day!

This was fantastic!  I have a friend that lives in LA and she made her gumbo when visiting with me...this recipe was very similar to hers.  I used boneless chicken breasts that I sauteed in olive oil before adding to the gumbo and used a jalapeno sausage for extra spice.    Thanks for a great recipe!

A whisk would have been helpful while making this dish. Even without one it turned out, although it was a little too rich for me.

This was my first attempt to make gumbo and I thought it came out quite good!  My only complaint was that it was a bit too oily, so next time for the roux I'll probably try clarified butter instead of vegetable oil.  My only variations were to cook it all in my crock pot and I added a tsp of gumbo file at the end.

I have been making this recipe for a year.  Each time I make it, it gets a little bit better. It is my husband and son's favorite dish!  I add carrots and I make my own creole seasoning which is pretty spicy. Other than that, I follow the recipe exactly.  The roux turns out more like a caramel color after 10 minutes versus chocolate milk, but I've tried cooking it longer and it burns.  Follow the recipe and enjoy!!!

I followed this receipe to the tee and it came out thick. My hubby loves gumbo and looked at me weird when it came out thick. REALLY THICK. He decided to add the left over chicken broth to his own bowl and then it was too salty. He ended up watering it down. It was good after that. It was good recipe but my roux took 20-25 min to brown. Over all I would make adjustments.

Great gumbo recipe.  I used this recipe with my leftover turkey bones from the Thanksgiving turkey.  I cooked them in water for several hours and then went with this recipe from there.  It was great.  To keep the gumbo more heart healthy, just skim off the oils after cooking or the next day after cooling.

Always add your veggies a little at a time on a low to medium-low heat. This will keep the splatter down. And saute your Okra prior to adding it to the Gumbo. By sauteing the okra, you will eliminate most of the slimmey gooieness, and still have that great flavor.

Absolutly wonderful. The only thing I changed was that I cooked my own chicken, and added a little more cajun spice since we like it spicy. I stirred in 1/2 lb raw, shelled, tail removed shrimp in the last 5 min of cooking time. Will make again. Thanks for a great recipe.

Fantastic gumbo... my Mom even asked me for a copy of the recipe. We like our roux quite dark so it took a little longer than 10 minutes and I was shooting for "dark chocolate candy" in color.  Used deer/pork sausage.  Certainly not too spicy... so Mom and the kids ate it.  Added a little hot sauce to my own bowl.  But stayed on-recipe with the rest.  I've found my gumbo recipe at last!

Wow, this was good.  So savory, with just the right amount of heat to keep it interesting.

I substituted 2 lbs chicken breasts that I braised in stock to get the same fall-apart tender texture of rotisserie chicken.  No reason, just had them lying around and wanted to use them up.  I also did an oven roux rather than the stovetop roux suggested here, just because I'm lazy and didn't want to hang around the stove whisking:)

This recipe is delicious. My rue came out really too thick after I added the chicken stock, so next time I'll use only 1/2 c of flour & oil. I spent 10 - 15 mins cooking the rue to a nice chocolatey color, but I think next time I'll just add gravy master :)

This recipe was a hit, and easy to make!  I could not find Andouille Sausage at my local grocery store but the butcher recommended Chorizo Sausage(spicy sausage)as an close second, excellent recommendation.  No left overs with this one!

I didn’t add the spinach and I made my own broth. My family thought it started off to be a little bland, so I added some seasoning salt, basil, oregano, and a Garlic and Herb seasoning which gave it excellent flavor and everyone enjoyed every bite. Will be making this again. Thank you!!

First I will say that I did not make this recipe. But I wanted to say that I have been making gumbo since I had to stand on a chair to reach the pot. I grew up in south Louisiana. This recipe is pretty close. The only thing I would change is to use raw drumsticks. I use drumsticks because there are no little bones kids can choke on. You need the raw bones to add flavor to the sauce. This is what is called a file gumbo. So if you want you can add shrimp, crab, and or oysters in the last 15 minutes of simmering (not sooner or they will fall apart). I remove the drumsticks from the gumbo and let it cool enough to handle and remove meat from bones and add meat back into gumbo. Throw bones away.

Fabulous recipe!  I did follow a suggestion from another and made my roux in the oven - it was fabulous!  Used 2/3 cup of vegetable oil and 1 cup of flour.  Mix on the stove with whisk - oven on 375 - then place in the oven.  I did so for two hours stirring every 20 minutes.  It was perfect.  As with other reviewers, I swapped green pepper for cut okra (frozen 14 ounce) the last 30 minutes.  I did have to add some additional broth and one cup of water for my desired consistency as it simmered.  It was a big hit!

Delicious Gumbo recipe. Me and my family absolutely loved it. I would definitely make it again. I made a few minor changes. The roux was very thick so I used 8 cups of chicken broth instead of 6. Also, I fried a whole chicken and deboned it instead of using a rotisserie. Finally,I threw in some frozen Okra about 30 min before the gumbo was done. I will definitely be making this again soon!

I made this pretty closely following the recipe, with the exception of using chicken breasts because I had them. My son rarely comments about the meals but he loved this! Very simple to follow. I cooked my roux until it was about caramel color due to time restraints. I’d like to try to get it really dark next time, but I think it’s going to take a lot longer than the contributor says

I used this recipe as a base for my experiment...I made some homemade ancho Chili, rosemary, fennel seed, sun dried tomato beef sausage and decided to use that instead of the andouille.  Instead of chicken, I used 16-20 peeled prawns.  I didn’t have any Tabasco on hand, so I used what I had, black pepper, sriracha and vinegar to mimic the Tabasco flavor.  The sausage gave it a hearty, savory, beefy flavor to it, while the prawns gave a slight sweetness and snapping texture to it.  I also added some unsalted butter to the roux because butter makes everything taste better...combined with the celery, peppers, garlic and onions, there was a little bit of sweet, a little bit of heat, a little bit of tang and little bit of savory meat....food experiment was a success...

I have never made gumbo before, but have always wanted to try it.  I read the previous reviews and only used a half a cup of flour in a half cup of oil. This came out absolutely delicious! This is definitely a recipe that I will be making again!!

A real Cajun gumbo does not use bay leaves so I opted out of that ingredient. If you find your gumbo is “oily” you have not skimmed the oil off. You really gotta be patient and skim off as much oil as possible. If you don’t your meal will be oily. This recipe is on par with what my grandma makes.

This was absolutely perfect! Watch out for the creole seasoning that you get, as some come with quite a bit of salt. This was just the best version of classic New Orleans gumbo that I have had forgotten outside of the 9th ward. I don’t have enough hands to give this as many high fives as it deserves.

If you are trying to get the consistency you want, just remember; the thicker (darker) the roux the thinner the gumbo will be.  It sounds like it should be the direct opposite but it isn't.  We like ours thinner so we stir our roux about 20 min till it is the color of a Hershey's Chocolate bar.

I love this recipe! First of all, it's how I remember it being made as a kid growing up in the DEEP South. Not all this fancy  people keep adding to 'update' it. It's the basic traditional way I legit remember and I was excited to try it. However, I have west coast born and raised teens. So, I only cooked the roux ten minutes til it was barely milk chocolate colored because their taste buds are all screwed up from the West coast nonsense like burgers and fries lol. Anyway it was perfect. I used a rotisserie chicken from Safeway.. the whole thing all the meat. Tho I prefer the dark chocolate roux the kids ate the  out of it. 

What will I change? Next time I will try pure high grade corn oil. I used regular vegetable oil and I could taste the difference after 40 years even. I know we had corn oil back as a kid but it was homemade so I think that'll just tear it up! Kiddos to whomever posted this. Honestly I love basic traditional recipes that aren't all 'westerned' up. I don't think anyone raised west of Texas even knows what good food is!

What will I change? Next time I will

This was really good. I didn’t get the roux too dark, coffee with cream color. I went light on the Creole seasoning because I wasn’t sure how spicy it would be.  I think I’ll add a little more next time. I will definitely be making this again!

I’m from Louisiana, and this is almost exact recipe of my mother’s! Browning the sausage before making roux gives it a much stronger flavor and also cooks out some grease. Make sure your roux is a nice milk chocolate color(think of a Hershey bar). I used 8 cups of broth because it was a little too thick for my liking.

This was an awesome gumbo.  I didn't have any andouille sausage so I used spicy smoked sausage, but it was still good.  I just got back from a fancy cruise where they served a sausage and chicken gumbo and I thought it was good enough to try to find a recipe.  This recipe was better than the cruise ship version.  I did add another 2 cups of water to get it to the consistency I like, but followed the recipe otherwise.  Yum!

I added a pound of shrimp too, really good amd smells wonderful. I couldn't find creole seasoning at my local grocer, so I used all recipes how to make creole seasoning" and used 4 tablespoons for the pot. Also, I boiled a chicken in 2 tablespoons of chicken soup base w/salt and pepper to start off so I had 3 quarts of fresh chicken stock.  Really impressive recipe! Thanks!

it came out great. I would probably add 3 to 4 tablespoons of a creole seasoning though to give it a little more flavor. to make a good roux the process should probably take around 25 minutes on medium heat.

Husband approved! He likes it stewy and “just so”. This recipe got me there! I always use bacon grease for a roux. I used 1/4 less of it to make this thicker. I added shrimp and Ocra near the end. Loads of creole seasoning and I look like the master chef!

Wonderful.
This was the first time I made this, and I just did a half batch.
Used smoked Polish sausage from local butcher.
A half rotisserie chicken worked wonderfully.
Made the roux separately.
Next time a whole batch!

Love it just like the recipe with no changes. Had to make it gluten free for a friend and was not sure how the roux would brown using cornstarch instead of flour. If you need to go gluten free sub half the amount of cornstarch for the flour. It did brown just fine. Have added okra frozen or fresh in the last 30 minutes as well as shrimp on occasion. My family begs me to make this. I sometimes serve with long grain cooked rice on the side to add as desired.

I work for a soup kitchen.  It was my day to cook, so I looked up gumbo recipes and this one fit the bill.  I made it for 100.  I did cut the amount of oil in half and used Tony Cachere's Creole seasoning.  It turned out excellent!  Our guests loved it!  My only disappointment is that I didn't give myself enough time to get the roux as dark as I wanted!

I used this recipe to make gumbo for the first time and it was AMAZING!! The only ingredient I added was shrimp.

This is my go-to gumbo recipe. I make it with shrimp instead of rotisserie chicken because I'm not much of a chicken person, and I do find that adding sliced okra definitely makes the dish better.

My mother in law is from Louisiana and had 2 restaurants in east Texas.  She knows her way around a Southern kitchen!  This is very similar to her gumbo.  The only difference is she orders a Greenberg Turkey every Thanksgiving, full of pepper veins and smoked.  She carves it up (we eat it all week) takes the carcass, and makes a turkey stock out of it.  That smokey, peppery broth is the base for her gumbo that makes it DYNAMIC and the most delicious I have ever had!  Also, the sausage matters.  Our local Down Home smoked cajun sausage is AMAZING!   When each ingredient is just right, the gumbo will sing you a song~ a zydeco song that makes you want to dance around the kitchen :)

The only change I made was to decrease the roux to 2/3 cup and added okra. It was a really big hit! Might make this at least monthly.

Made exactly as directed but found this to be very oily and pretty  uninteresting except for the Cajun taste, which is actually very good but overpowers the taste in the sausage and chicken. Not bad, but certainly not a gourmet meal....

This recipe was  good though I made some changes to more closely match what I grew up with.

I added a small bag of chopped frozen okra. For me its not gumbo without okra.

I added a teaspoon of cayenne to add a hint of heat and garnished with file and parsley flakes.

I went way darker with the roux.

My husband who has family in the south really liked this recipe, I have never had gumbo before but enjoyed this recipe. I could only find Cajun andouille sausage and it made it a bit spicy for me so I  will see if I can find plain next time.

I added 2 cans rotel, 1/8 cup creole seasoning, an extra celery stalk, and a 15oz bag of frozen okra 1 hr before done. Perfection! Everyone went back for seconds. So easy, & I’ll definitely be making this again & again! Thank you so much for sharing!

I went GF and used rice flour and cut oil and flour each to a 1/2 cup.  Doubled celery.  Added 16oz of broth (in addition to recipe). Added frozen Okra (12 oz, sliced) in last 10 minutes’ish.  Super easy and super good.  :-)

This recipe is great! I added okra and opted out of the chicken (lack of time). I also mixed up my own Creole seasoning. It was a huge hit in my house and with the neighbors!! Definitely making this again and looking forward to trying different meats.

This was very delicious!  I made mine with two types of sausage (chicken sausage with sun-dried tomato and basil as well as a chorizo sausage).  I also made a big pot of white rice to go with it.  This was superb and I highly recommend it to anyone trying to find something new to make for dinner.  This was definitely fit for Voodoo priestess Marie Laveau!!!

I made this last night and it was great! instead of using oil I used a cup of butter. it was way better (in my experiences) and I don't really like the taste of oil and flour together.  going to make this again really soon!

I modified this recipe quite a bit to use in my instant pot. I fried the andouille sausage, then added it to the IP with a pint of canned chicken and canned pork. I also added 1 cup of okra and I decided to add 1 can of tomatoes with the rest of the ingredients. I didn't use any oil or flour. I added 2 teaspoons of the cajun spice. I cooked everything under pressure for 30 minutes. My family loved this soup and told me that I should have doubled the recipe. My daughter said it reminded her of tortilla soup so she added grated cheese to hers.

At least your recipe for the most part follows traditional Cajun gumbo recipes.  The roux can be microwaved for three minutes, stirred and microwaved for another minute, etc until it starts to get a medium copper color.  It should then be finished off slowly with constant whisking in a metal pot until it reaches a rich dark brown.  There is no substitution for the taste a dark brown roux will make and there is no fix for it if the liquid is added before the roux is done.  When the roux starts to be really brown it must have your full attention to keep it from burning.

It's not Gumbo unless it has Okra in it. That's how it got its name...

 That's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.

This recipe turned out great, it even got the approval of my mom and aunt who always make gumbo for our family. The only changes I made were to add Old Bay Seasoning, tablespoon of gumbo file and a little cayenne pepper. I will definitely make this again!

Thank You for the great recipe. A few modifications... grouper, snapper and royal reds vs. chicken. Butter for the roux. The andouille sausage brought a beautiful base flavor and heat to the Gumbo.  Of course, okra was added (slightly  sautéed for 20 min) because, in our household, Gumbo by default must have okra. You made this meal very easy for me!!!!

Great start for a solid Acadian Creole Gumbo! The New Orleans style is not used with dark Roux. Not a good flavor either.
For my changes :
Roux browned to the classic Peanut butter color
Red bell pepper slivered. 
Stock is all homemade from the Boiled Chicken and a Veggie blend in a cheese cloth bag simmered for 4 hours!
Run the stock through a screen and set aside. 
I also finish the Roux as if it where a base for gravy with 2 cups of room temperature stock at high heat until thickened. This makes the Gumbo hearty instead of watery. 
One other prep tip, once the stock is  cool I skim the chicken fat off the top for a healthier meal.
After the  thickened base is done I combine all my ingredients and simmer very slowly for some time only seasoning to taste after all that. The flavors take a good bit to develop. 
Finally, and most important is the use of Creole seasoning. 
ONLY USE Tony Chacheres authentic Creole seasoning! It's a hot seasoning but tasty. 
 It's a southern tradition to eat this with rice and cornbread or johnny cakes.

Do not use oil to make the roux. Use butter. Not only does it add flavor, it reduces the oily taste many people are experiencing. It will also help make the roux dark more quickly. Add a few finely chopped fresh jalapeños if you want some heat and green onions for a little color and you will have an even better gumbo. I also cook my gumbo a minimum of three hours. 

 Want to make it even better? Boil 1/2 dozen eggs for 6 minutes, peel and drop them whole in the gumbo and let them simmer until it is ready to serve. Best boiled egg you will ever have in your life! Trust me! Lived in New Orleans all my life! You will not regret making these minor changes!

We spend a lot of time in Louisiana and Mississippi. We love gumbo and I thought I’d look for a good recipe to try to make it in the cold winter months. Well this one caught my eye. I made it today and must agree with so many of other reviewers...this is the real thing. Tastes just like I’m in a New Orleans restaurant. Love it so much I’ll be making it more and will share with family and friends!

Love love love this gumbo. We stuck to the recipe except for an error we made. Added the chicken in when you put in the sausage. We actually skipped an hour of cooking and still this gumbo was absolutely delicious.

I make this gumbo with the same ingredients, however, I add hot sauce and "Slap yo mama" seasoning. I also tend to cook it in a different order. I bring my broth and seasonings to a boil while I prep my vegetables. I cook the slime off the okra and brown the sausage. I then batter the chicken with flour and seasoning and fry it a bit in the oil, not all the way done. I then mix the remaining flour from the chicken batter into the oil and make my roux. I brown it to the color of milk chocolate. I then pour the roux into the boiling broth. Once this mixture begins to bill again I then add the meat and allow it to boil for about 30 minutes and then add the vegetables. I then reduce heat to a simmer for about 3 hours. Serve it over rice!

I’ve never made gumbo before, and next time I’ll be a little more prepared. I didn’t like this recipe too much because the seasonings didn’t seem right. The season to taste kinda made me nervous, but with a little adjustment it turned out pretty good. I think next time I’ll use a spicier sausage, and I added a dash of hot sauce to give it a little more flavor.

Made it twice now and its amazing.  I added an extra package of spicy sausage to go with the smoked and used only dark meat from a store bought rotisserie chicken.  Personally i used 3/4 cup oil/flour for the roux and used around 5 cups stock because i like mine thinner than this recipe.  Added a little cooked white rice and boom!

One tip on the roux, the darker the better. Don't know what a "dutch oven" is but in southern Louisiana black iron skillet is used for roux. Maybe the same just called different. But once you have desired color of your roux, now this is very tricky but worth it if you get it right, slightly and I mean slightly let the roux burn. Just before the black specs. I promise this will set your gumbo apart from any other gumbo.  Its very tricky but worth it. And for better chicken use bone in chicken and deb one after. If you wish. My chicken just falls off the bone.

I took some other reviewers advice and: made my roux in the oven, added a bag of frozen okra, and also added a bag of frozen salad or small shrimp. Oh and now I throw boneless skinless chicken breasts in slow cooker, they practically fall apart and I don’t have to mess with the rotisserie. Came out AH-MAZING! Everyone LOVES it!!! Have made it several times now. Thank you for such a yummy recipe!

I've been making this recipe since Allrecipes was the most basic site with a toolbar on the left to find chicken dishes lol. It was actually the first one I printed off. It's a family and friend favorite. No one I've fed it to has disliked it. I don't make any adjustments. It's perfect the way it is!

MADE it PALEO by using bacon fat, avocado oil - tapioca flour for ROUX. My only “cheat” was the white rice. But you cannot have gumbo without rice!!  Turned out DELICIOUS!!  I could eat every day. Thank you.

If you cook the sausage and chicken in the pan first and then make the roux with the pan drippings it adds a ton of flavor.  Also the roux really needs to cook for at least 25 to 30 mins to get that rich dark brown color that makes a great gumbo.

I'm sorry to say this but I did not like it. At all. And maybe it's because I've never had traditional gumbo. My hubby has had gumbo from New Orleans and said this tastes just like it. So I guess if you want "real" gumbo, then this is it. It was way too greasy for me -- and I cooked the roux for 30 minutes until it was a nice dark brown. It was strong -- but according to my hubby, that's the way roux is supposed to taste. The gumbo I've had is obviously not real gumbo -- and if this is how gumbo is supposed to taste, I'll pass.

I can not tell you just how much my family enjoys this dish. It is one of our absolute FAVORITE dishes. 

I would only suggest, be patient with your roux! it takes a good 5-10 minutes. Also, a good quality olive oil will make the difference,

Excellent and very close to the gumbos I've eaten most of my life, except allow me to kibbitz about one thing: most online gumbo recipes call for  a roux to be made  with vegetable oil. I've never seen that in my life, in a Gulf Coast family that spans six generations.   I make gumbo with bacon grease the way my Momma and Granny taught me.  Also, instead of rotisserie chicken I usually  boil a fryer, remove the bones and skin and use the broth. The rest is the same.

Delicious! I made this the way it was written, and also a "healthy" version in a slow cooker-  an experiment that turned out well. 

For both I just used 1.5lbs raw chicken tenders, and let them cook until they were falling apart. All I had to do was poke them a bit with a spatula to get them to fall into bite sized chunks. I also used 1lb smoked beef sausage, and 1lb smoked turkey sausage (pork makes me sick). I used the creole seasoning as suggested by another reviewer (1/2 t. dried basil, 1/2 t. dried thyme, 1/2 t. dried oregano, 1 t. of ground black pepper, 1/2 t. of cayenne pepper, 1 t. of paprika). Since I used 2lb sausage I only used 1/2 tsp salt, and used 1 tsp file powder.
The finished result on the stove was delicious and filling, not at all oily. 

For the slow cooker version, I didn't make a roux at all, as I wanted it to be a "healthy" version. I used 4 cups of broth, but it turned out pretty soupy. Although still yummy, but of course it didn't have the depth that the roux provides. I think you could get away with using 2-3 cups of broth instead. I cooked it on high for 4 hours and that was perfect. Served both versions with brown rice. Will be making this again!

I did as others suggested and made the roux in the oven. From there, I did as directed. I did have to let the roux cool and then siphon off the remaining oil (which I kept just in case) because almost 1/2 a cup just would not bake down (and it did not cook down and I continued it on the stove to try). However, once I added the veggies and sausage, I did end up adding back almost 1/4 cup of the oil I siphoned off!

Anyway, the only other thing I did was add extra seasoning as we like a little spice to ours. Otherwise, this was an easy recipe to follow and very flavorful. It was my first successful gumbo dish! I tried before doing the roux on the stove top and always burned it before so the oven method was largely a winner for me.

I've made this gumbo using this recipe and it's always turned out tasting great,and my family loves it! The only difference I've done to it is added king crab legs to the pot last. Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe.

My DH and I both really liked this.  I used about 1 t of salt, 1/2 t of pepper and 2 t of Emeril's recipe for creole seasoning with about half the amount of cayenne that he calls for.  Forgot the bay leaf. used my homemade chicken stock and andouille sausage. was concerned when the roux suddenly turned very, very thick (almost solid) as soon as i added the vegetables.  i just kept going and it didn't scorch.  amazing!

I love seafood gumbo, but didn't have all that I needed, so I opted to try this! Good choice! It was delicious! Not over spicy, I had to add hot sauce to mine, but everybody else who can not eat spicy, loved it! I will be making this again!

It is delicious! I followed others' suggestions and halved both the oil and flour. Started cooking in the morning and set it in the oven on low until dinner. Thanks for the Yum!

This is the dinner all of the family members ask for on their birthdays and special occasions! Carve out some time to do it right.  The roux is time consuming(I go for very  DARK brown) and a bit of a pain, but the end product is fantastic.  I tend to be more generous with the garlic and Creole seasoning.  I always add ocra the last 30 minutes of simmer. Serve over rice with warm, crusty bread...as my husband's Granny would say, "makes my tongue want to beat my brains out"!
On our trip to NOLA last year we visited the Gumbo Shop. My kids said my gumbo tastes just like theirs!

I only used 5 cups chicken broth. To make up for the liquid needed I use 1 cup of white wine which made this recipe pop.

Excellent and so flavorful. I made a few changes based on what I had on hand, thus only 4 stars. I didn't have a green pepper so I added a 4 oz can of green chiles in its place. I also didn't have any Creole seasoning, so I added some basil, oregano, paprika, cayenne pepper and thyme. I also grilled and shredded 4 chicken breasts in place of the rotisserie chicken and added 1/4 lb fresh homemade hot ground sausage. Hubby said it was delicious and I loved it too.

very good. cook the roux really dark for an excellent flavor.  I do cut the oil a tad when making the roux and then skim it off the top when gumbo is all done.

I really liked this recipe!  My 8yr old gobbled it up.   I'm no gumbo expert, but I do like my sauce to be a little thinner so I used 1/3 cup flour and 1/3 cup butter to make the roux.

I'm from New Orleans so I know what I like when it comes to gumbo. The taste of this is spot on. The consistency is a lot thicker than I prefer though. I wound up adding an extra cup of water because it was looking too thick.  I have made Merwin's Shrimp Gumbo from this site and that was closer to what I like. I think that recipe was a lot more work though.  Don't get me wrong, it was delicious just not exactly what I'm looking for. I also added shrimp and okra because that's what I like.  Next time, I would make the roux darker. I wound up skimming a lot of oil off the top. Rather do that than have an oily gumbo!

11.17.16 ~ I wanted to try a gumbo that didn't include shrimp (don't care for it) in the recipe.   Not sure what we were expecting - but this is what we got.  DH liked it a lot more than me, but he really likes gravy.  It was served over white rice, but we both thought it could use a little more flavor.

I made the roux, but I changed it up and used 3/4 cup of bacon grease versus the oil. Gave it a very unique smoky flavor. It was absolutely delicious! I'd make this again and again.

This was ok but too much oil which slicked up the top as it simmered.  I had to skim off a good 1/3 to 2/3 of a cup of oil from the soup.  I will look for another gumbo recipe in the future.

Excellent recipe. I halved it for our small family and ending up adding a little more chicken broth to thin it a little.

I used 1/2 c vegetable oil & flour and it took about 15 minutes to get the roux chocolate milk color. I added .75 lb chicken, 4-5 links of spinach feta chicken sausage I needed to use, and followed the recipe as written but added a can of diced tomatoes and several shakes of Lea & Perrins Worcestershire. Also 5-6 small bell peppers and a jalapeño from my garden. Waiting to see how it turns out now!

Made this last night for the first time and was really good. I used 2/3 cup oil and flour, and 8 cups of chicken broth. Also, I added an extra bay leaf.  Will make this again and invite friends and family next time!

Cut oil down by 1/4 cup.  Also. As long as your paying attention the rue will finish in 20 minutes not the 30-40 they suggest here.  Flavor is fantasticc.

Recipe was good and turned out well but I have never made it before without okra. This can be added with other vegetables.
Also file powder can be used to thicken sauce. Overall a great dish.

First ever attempt at Gumbo. Followed recipe to the T.  Do not have dutch oven.  Used metal pot. Reduced heat from time to time during whisking process as seemed to be getting to hot.  Whisking is a workout but worth it.  Let roux get to color of light milk chocolate.    Shredded up roasted chicken from Costco.  No amount of creole seasoning listed so season to taste.  Served over rice.  EXCELLENT!!!

Having lived in East Texas for a few years, I love a good Gumbo! This recipe is spot on, only thing I did different is: brown my sliced sausage in pot, remove, then add the oil following the directions. I think the sausage yumyums make a huge difference!

I have prepared this gumbo THREE times and only discovered it two weeks ago.  The raves I receive are much welcomed.  I have served garlic bread or cornbread on the side as well.  It is definitely a KEEPER!!

Very good!  I used hot Italian sausage, and an extra bit of bell pepper and celery.  I was afraid of all the oil and fat in the dish, but it didn't effect my sensitive stomach at all.  Served over rice.  Very tasty!

Creamy and delicious!  I've been making gumbo for a long time, but always with tomatoes and seafood. This gumbo is very creamy and flavorful.  I used half the flour/fat for the roux  with a combination of butter and coconut oil.  Added a jalapeño pepper with the trinity and frozen okra during the 2nd hour.  It was delicious!

Absolutely the best thing I have ever made from AllRecipes!! Sooo flavorful! Followed the recipe almost precisely, but made slight changes. A few things come out a bit different than expected. The onion, celery, and green pepper are delicious, but completely cook away. Needs the presence of some veggies. Add 1lb fresh cut frozen okra toward the end, about 10 minutes before eating, makes the gumbo perfect. Also doubled the celery at the beginning. Thickened it with 2 tablespoons of flour later in cooking, liquid now thicker, like stew. Used 3lbs of chicken breast, not rotissiere. Used a big teaspoon of salt, pepper, & Zataran's creole seasoning. Delicious and inexpensive. Making again today. Really good on rice, even better on cheese grits. YUM!!!

I reduced the flour and oil to 1/2 c each, added just 4 cups of chicken broth.  total cook time after making the roux - about 1 hr.  I didn't see the need for much cook time after adding the chicken since the liquid was already thickened and things were starting to stick on the pot.  glad I have a good dutch oven for this.  didn't have creole seasoning, so added the herbs and spices per another reviewer, but left out the paprika and hot sauce.  glad i did because the 1 tsp. or so of cayenne made it plenty spicy for me.

My first gumbo! Excellent! I use wheat flour, don't know if the reason, but my rue just wouldn't get very dark. With the wheat flour, it starts out as a chocolate milk color.  I stirred for more than 10 min though! Other than that, it was perfect! You can really put any veggies that you like. I didn't have okra (I love okra in gumbo), I just put an abundant amount of celery! (Loved it with celery) I also added mushrooms. I will definitely be making this again. I was always so afraid of gumbo...Don't know why...It was so easy!

Excellent recipe and easy to make.  I have to admit that the storytelling with the wine and stuff was distracting to the recipe but it came out well the two times I've made it.  I'd add a few more veggies and broth to my next time I cook it.... Personal preference.  The meal had 3 types of protein, sausage, ham and chicken OR shrimp so it's hearty.  Cooks rapidly.  You could make it after coming home from work and it's ready in about 1 1/32 hours.  Rice or cornbread on the side... Yum.

I've reviewed this recipe before and can't say enough great things about it! Delicious Gumbo! When I'm pressed for time I don't make a rue, I scoop out a little bit of the hot liquid and whisk in1/4c flour until smooth. Stir flour mixture back into the pot and cook another 15 minutes. Thickens up nicely! Thanks for this recipe!

Cajun Chicken & Sausage Gumbo Haiku: "Slurped up every bite. For ease, I took some shortcuts. Don't mess up that roux!" After stirring the roux constantly for 30 min (I've wrecked them in the past and I was determined to master this one) I rewarded myself w/ a few shortcuts to the remainder of the recipe, so I used a frozen medley of chopped onion/bell pepper/celery, and I used Kirkland canned chicken. Kept the rest the same, and served w/ a dash of hot sauce (kept the Cajun seasoning to 1/2 tsp. b/c the kiddos were eating too) and a scoop of basmati. O M G this was awesome; seconds were consumed all around. No leftovers. Win.

I prepared the recipe just as stated.  It was great!  Some people commented that there was too much oil but I didn't think so.  It takes a while to achieve the chocolate color of the roux but just keep stirring!

I used coconut flour and olive oil for the roux. I substituted okra for celery and I also added shrimp at the end. Very very tasty, the only thing I will do different next time is use actual andouille sausage. I used hot Italian sausage and it wasn't as good. I love Cajun food and this was very good.

I've made this for the third time now. I only use twice the sausage (country pleasin). It's impressed everyone whose tasted it.  Now I'm going to sift through the reviews and "tweak" it. But honestly I don't know how it can get better! Thank you so much for sharing!

Next time I will definitely use only half the fat and flour; the broth was much too thick for my taste. I used butter instead of vegetable oil. Also, it seemed like it needed more vegetables, so I chopped three carrots and added them. Okra would have been good, too, if I had it on hand. The sausage was so spicy (Aidell's brand), that a tablespoon of Tony Chachere's was plenty!

I was getting tired of the samo-samo so I decided to give this recipe a try since I can read and follow directions well, LoL! I messed up on my first roux because I poured ALL of the flour in the hot oil rather than sprinkling it in WHILE stirring. Luckily I also had everything ready BEFORE starting because you need to pay attention to the roux and continue mixing to the desired color. I added everything as described except garlic; I added that with the chicken stock. All in all, this recipe was DELICIOUS and the pot was empty within minutes. You bet I'll be making this again and more often. THANK YOU for making feel like an expert!! :0)

I've made this recipe a couple of times & have to say, my family loves it!  The ONLY single thing I've altered is I use 3/4c oil & flour.... This is the easiest Gumbo recipe I've ever made & just as yummy as the complicated ones.  Also, I am so happy this does not call for tomato & okra...I don't understand how anyone can go wrong with the ingredients, they are all perfect!  This is a keeper for our family...Thank you!!!

Made this delicious dish for a family birthday dinner a party of 11 people. I doubled the recipe and had leftovers. Delightfully filling! I made mine Gluten-Free by using potato starch instead of flour for the roux. One thing is: it doesn't thicken or brown on the stove but will thicken gumbo in the CrockPot.  I didn't care for the andouille sausage much, I will try a different one next time.

Yes, please and thank you for the A-M-A-Z-I-N-G recipe!!  I had never made gumbo before but I have made it twice now (to my family's resounding glee, lip smacking and empty plates) and  I will DEFINITELY be making this recipe again AND AGAIN!!  I will say that this is definitely something you have to stay on top of, don't look away from it, answer the phone or take a second to let the dog out (making roux is fast, furious, serious business) just keep it moving so as not to burn it.  This will taste even better on day two and reheats well. It will make your tongue slap your brains out for sure! =]

After reading many of the reviews, I decided to cut the oil to 1/2 cup and the flour to 1/2 cup.  It took about 25 minutes for me to get the roux to the darkness I liked.  Since there was no amount listed for the spices we had to guess and ended up adding more of the Chatcheries Creole seasoning.  (about 1TBS total)  Not too much salt and pepper as the creole seasoning is salty.  I added a few dashes of Louisiana hot sauce and threw in some shrimp about 10 minutes before the end.  Yum, yum, yum!

This is an awesome gumbo recipe, you can't get any better for a weeknight! 

I followed the recipe pretty much to a T, and it turned out wonderfully. The flavor was awesome, and it was nice and thick (I was afraid it would be too thin). My husband liked it so much, he forgot to eat it with rice and just slurped it like soup!

The only thing I would do differently next time is cook the roux longer. I was very careful to stir it constantly because I didn't want it to burn and be bitter...cooked it about 10 minutes total. But it never achieved that rich, velvety brown color that I look for in a gumbo (although it tasted fantastic...mine was the color of a good chicken stew...kinda dark golden brown). Next time, I'll cook the roux longer and add shrimp.

Awesome recipe. I tweaked a little by adding some red pepper flakes and cayenne for some heat. Also quickly grilled the smoked sausage for caramelization before adding.

I have wanted to make chicken & sausage gumbo for awhile. I have had the Campbell's gumbo, but I love to cook & it was time to take that step! I found this recipe last winter! The first time I scratched it, but I was able to doctor it up & it was good! So by the second time around, I knew just what I needed to do! I love veggies, so I added some okra, tomatoes, & a couple other veggies! I decided to step outside da box on the traditional new year's dinner & make chicken gumbo for my family! This recipe is saved in my bookmarks. I will continue to use it & even pass it on to friends & family! Happy New Year To You & Your Family! May God Bless U!

This was great.  I used the recipe for creole seasoning from someone who had made a comment.  The recipe for creole seasoning was 1/2 t basil, 1/2 t thyme, 1/2 t oregano, 1 t black pepper, 1 t salt, 1 t paprika, 1 t pepper sauce(I used tobasco).  I did only use 1/2 a cup of oil(olive oil) and 1/2 a cup of flour for the roux.  Then I topped each service with a round 1/2 cup of rice.  I frequent New Orleans and this tasted like something you would get in a restaurant there.  Will make again.

Fantastic! Even with roux from a jar. I used half of a 16oz jar of roux and 8 cups chicken broth, vs. 6. Served over sticky rice sprinkled with gumbo file. I think using broth (instead of water) and andouille instead of regular sausage makes a big difference.  I've loved gumbo my whole life but could never quite get the right taste, until now - THANKS SO MUCH!

I just made this Gumbo and it is wonderful!  I have tried to make gumbo before but was never successful.  I think what made the difference for me was starting with the roux and adding to it, rather than making the "soup" and then adding roux.  I did add some cayenne but other than stuck to the recipe.  It's really yummy!

I followed this recipe almost to a T but I accidentally just put 4 C of chicken broth in the beginning instead of 6- once I noticed this half way through after everything was simmering for the last hour, I added in another 2 C.  It came out really thick and stewlike but was still delicious.  If you like your gumbo to have a little more of a kick to it, like I do, then add lots of the Creole seasoning or try some cayenne pepper or some additional seasoning because I added in a lot of salt, pepper, and Creole seasoning and still did not have that HEAT I crave in my gumbos.  Also, I like my gumbo to be more soupy, not so thick, so I would probably add in some water as well or more chicken broth to get a more brothy gumbo. Overall, it was delicious and my husband was a little upset that I took more of a helping of the leftovers to lunch the next day than he did!

I have to agree that cutting down on the amount of oil used to make the rue would help with the oily film that showed up after simmering for the first  hour.  In addition to the bell peppers and onion that that recipe called for I added frozen okra, cut carrots and used smoked Kelbasa since that's what I had available.  In addition to the Cajun seasoning I also added Cayanne Pepper which gave the Gumbo a nice heat factor.  Overall a great recipe and my family loved it!!

Not traditional as it lacks okra but definitely delicious.  We sometimes add shrimp along with the chicken and Andouille sausage. Great over rice or by itself.

Love!  Love!  Love!  Other reviews state that they wanted their gumbo thicker, so they only used half the roux.  I recommend adding okra to the mix following the recipe exactly!  I'm not sure what it is about okra, but it has a thickening effect which is perfect for this recipe!  Follow what you like when you're making this recipe though...if you LOVE celery...add more!  If you don't like green peppers...leave them out!  (I always add more celery and garlic!)  Delicious and worth the prep and cook time!

Ditto on the comments that the roux will need to cook longer (especially for a chicken/sausage gumbo).  I have cooked and stirred for over 50 minutes to get a rich dark chocolate reddish roux.  It is worth the time.  Also, when making a roux you might try 3/4 cup oil to 1 cup flour.  The key is to use equal weights of fat a flour.  Use a good vegetable oil, no olive oil or butter and the roux will be perfect.

This was GREAT! I made it exactly as is except for adding a few jalapeños. It took me longer than 10min to get the roux to chocolate milk color but I probably had my temp a little lower just because I was paranoid about burning. I kept a constant stir going and it turned out perfect. Use a LONG wooden spoon or whisk. Some of the roux splashed up on my hand for just a split second and I have some pretty cool battle scars to show for it today. :) I'm sure most of you are more careful than me though.  Thank you for the recipe!

The first time I made this I was too impatient and didn't brown the roux long enough. The second time I took the time and made sure it was browner. I'd definitely take the time to let it brown.  Also, I am from Maryland so I added 1 lb of shrimp with Old Bay seasoning sprinkled on it. not authentic gumbo, but we like it :)

I followed the recipe to a "t", but it didn't turn out just right.  Not like a gumbo.  Had great flavor, just a strange texture.  Very good flavor.

Hi, Jodi!  I live in San Francisco, where cioppino and sourdough bread reign as the classic regional dishes.  We don't often get to enjoy gumbo here, but I've been treated to it a couple of times by friends and coworkers who hail from bayou country.  When I told them I was making a classic Cajun gumbo, they were skeptical.    I followed your recipe precisely, using pork andouille from Whole Foods, a Costco rotisserie chicken, Trader Joe's free-range chicken stock and Creole seasoning I bought at a good market.    Making the roux was a snap.  I recommend prepping all the ingredients before first, then pouring a glass of wine or beer and stirring the roux constantly until it's ready.    A couple of notes from my first gumbo:  the andouille I used fell completely apart and in the end looked as though I'd used hamburger. Next time, I'll brown them separately and add the sausage with the chicken stock.  I also skimmed nearly a cup of fat off the top toward the end of the cooking time.  My finished gumbo looked beautiful and tasted even better, and it's actually very easy.  Next time I won't fuss over it during the two hours it's simmering.  Thanks again, Jodi, for sharing this wonderful regional recipe.  "Gumbo?  Oh, yeah.  I make a killer chicken and sausage gumbo."

The whole family LOVED this Gumbo!  Including my 8 yr old who is pretty picky.  I did cut the oil & flour down to 1/2c of each and bolied covered to keep a more of a soup-like consistency.  Fantastic flavor and simple recipe!  Thank you

This recipe was a hit!  I've made it twice now-once for a superbowl party and the other for my co-workers. I ran out before everyone could try some.  The trick is the roux-I cooked it over low-med heat for about 40 minutes until it was the color of coffee with a little creamer in it.  A pain to do but well worth the time! I followed the recipe exactley except I left out the bell peppers-great recipe! Thanks so much for sharing!

My DH is the gumbo chef in our house and this is remarkably like his recipe.  He does add okra and shrimp at the end of the process.  Good stuff Maynard!  Ya' got the Cajun Trinity, andouille and seasonings......how could you go wrong?!

I have made this recipe several times and just love it.  I found that the rotisserie chicken gives it a wonderful flavor (I like Sam's). Have shared the recipe with several friends who like it as well.  I enjoy serving it with buttered French bread that has been covered with foil and heated in the oven or with crackers.  Thanks, YoYo for a great tasting recipe!

This is a delicious gumbo and one which I'm making my new fav! The only change I suggest is  to make the roux 1 part oil to 3 parts flour...The recipe doesn't require so much oil. The trick to getting the nutty flavor of the flour into your roux is to stir constantly (I use a large , long-handled, stainless spoon, instead of whisk) until the right color is reached! I cooked roux at med-med high heat also. It was very tasty and had rave reviews from friends/family! Oh, I also added okra...an essential in my book for gumbo!! DEEE-LISH!!

The real deal. My only change was a touch of cayenne and frozen okra toward the end of cooking.  Even if you're not from the bayou, this is THE most comforting comfort-food dish there is.  *Tip - don't be too intimidated by the roux - with patience, a good heavy pot and the time to stand and stir, it's not much different than making gravy.

I used whole chicken breasts with skin and bones. I find this adds more flavor to the gumbo. This gumbo did remind of my great-grandmothers and it made so very happy. Thanks for helping me get so close to my family again!!

This was amazing! I used turkey sausage, shrimp, and chicken, which I pan fried in olive oil before adding to the roux as some suggested. I made sure to stir the roux CONSTANTLY for 15 minutes and it was perfect my first time! I had to add more creole seasoning in the end. My advice is when you think you've added enough, add more. I made enough to freeze, but my family ate it all the first night. Even my picky 7 year old. Will be adding to the rotation for sure!

This was really good. I think the recipe should be a little more specific about how much creole seasoning to use. I used 2 tablespoons. Did not use the salt since the creole seasoning had it in there. I would suggest pan frying the sausage and draining the grease- then add it in w/ the veggies and roux. I also added some cayenne pepper for more heat. and HAD to add some okra. This was very, very tasty! Will be making again soon.

Excellent, increased qty for 70 and it came out amazing. I used the bones from the chicken with scrapings from onions, ect for stock. No chicken bullion, the Creole seasoning is salty enough. I might decrease the flour/oil qty next. Very good, try a "test batch" first then go for the big batch.

After making the worst piece of food and wasting a good 30 bucks on Food Network recipe of Chicken Caccitore, I had to rebound in a big way for my family. And this recipe has done it.   I am telling you this is real easy to make and fun to make, the roux will be a good exercise on your wrists and arms. It also helps to have a $250.00 pot aka my moms stainless steel Caphalon Pot. The roux was a breeze with that pot and a wooden spoon. I had some ingrediants on hand and the rest were easy to find.   The smell of the dish is great, the taste is awesome. I made my super spicy, when I think of gumbo I think of spicy, and the ol socom 1 saying from a character on that game, "I'm spicer than my ol' ma's gumbo!" This gumbo is thick, so no need for okra, which btw tastes like , or lack their of. Its awesome, and alot better than that canned stuff you get from campbells. I will make this over and over again, and will make this for my big family on xmas, im sure this will be a hit.

Delicious! I cut the recipe in half since I was only cooking for my husband and me, but next time I may make the full recipe. I added some fresh okra after an hour of simmering and some old bay seasoning and half a pound of shrimp 20 minutes before serving. Will use this recipe again!

Fabulous! Used smoked sausage and added one can of Rotel with green chilies.  Just the right kick, not too spicy.  Even my 1 year old grandson like it.

This gumbo is incredible!  I added some okra, black beans, and gumbo filé seasoning (ground sasafras).  The roux is key.  Takes about 20-25 min of stiring to get a good color, but well worth it!  Bravo to the author of this one, thanks!

My husband loved it.  I made it exactly like the directions said.  I probably could have cooked the roux a little more, but I had already cooked it 25 minutes.

Fantastic recipe. It was fairly thick (I needed to let it simmer longer), so I just added an additional cup of chicken broth, and it was perfect. I was very pleased with how this turned out, and plan to make it again next week for my dad who loves gumbo.

I've never made gumbo before, and although I didn't get the color quite right, the flavor was definitely there! Thank you for a simple and delicious recipe!

Very good recipe. I added more herbs and spices as I found the creole seasoning alone wasn't enough for me, but that's a personal thing. I ate this over rice with cornbread muffins on the side.

I made this gumbo for my super bowl party.  It was a major half time hit.  "Now that's what gumbo should taste like." was my favorite comment.  I even had one guest ask for a "to go" bowl for lunch the next day. This recipe is a keeper.  I will make again.
