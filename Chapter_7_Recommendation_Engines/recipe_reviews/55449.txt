Ditto what the first reviewer said. Watery. Somewhat bland. Not recommended

Very ordinary. Thin and watery. I hesitated to add the chili powder that is called for, and I was right. Chili powder is not the way to go. Perhaps cayenne was meant? I vacillated between two and three stars, but decided on three because it has potential. I won't make it again, however.

This recipe was not to my liking.  I cook Indian cuisine several times a month and take studying the cooking techniques from India's different regions seriously.  This recipe had such a lack of balance that it was impossible to correct.  The sourness of the tamarind paste was so prominent that it dominated the recipe.  I tried to balance it with sugar, but it still wouldn't work.  The only things that allowed me to choke it down (I refuse to throw away meat or fish unless absolutely necessary) was an massive amount of lime mango pickle and a ton of fresh curry leaves.

This was easy to make and since I don't really like fish, it made it less fishy. My DH and 5 year old really liked it too.  Nice flavors. Served it with acorn squash.

i used fresh green chillies and 1cup of water instead of 2 oh, and fresh tamarind. i also marinated the fish in olive oil, appel vinager and lime juice for a few minutes, then i cooked it very quickly on a very hot pan just to seal it, then i continued to cook it with the sauce. it was good.

These came out delicious.  I added peas since I saw other people suggested it; I also added some garlic.  I had a tough time with the puff pastry so this took me a lot longer than the directions said.  Then I made a quick dipping sauce with barbecue sauce, curry paste, apple juice, and a little salt.

First time I made it, it was way too watery as mentioned by others.   Maybe the author left out an ingredient.  So next time I used two cups tomato sauce instead of water and the resulting sauce was really good.  Also, the ingredient list says "ground red pepper" but the instructions say chili powder.  I used chili powder.  Feel free to make it spicier if you like.  Three stars for the recipe as written, but five stars once it is modified.
