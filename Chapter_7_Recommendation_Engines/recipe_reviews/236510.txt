Layering the minced green onion and chopped tarragon into the egg white shell really gives you a pop of flavor, particularly the tarragon, that I don’t think you’d have if you just mixed them into the yolk filling.  There’s a good balance of spiciness from the horseradish and sweetness from the pickle juice.  We love deviled eggs, and this is a good one!  Nice recipe Jason Warne,
