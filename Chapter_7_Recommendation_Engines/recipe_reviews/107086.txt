Excellent! I used this rub on filets and while simple is best this rub was wonderful. Rosemary and thyme always pair well together and this was no exception. Let your steaks come to room temperature before grilling. We also grilled them with a couple of sprigs of fresh rosemary to give them a really nice flavor. This recipe is a definite keeper!

I cut the recipe back since there were only two of us.  I used the small end of the tenderloin which was about 1.2 lbs.  I followed the recipe exactly except of course the amount of time to cook.  I seared it on high for a few minutes on each side, turned down to medium and then moved to the other side of the grill.  Cooked it for 10 - 12 minutes and it was perfect! Was very tender, flavorful and tasty. I put the rub on earlier in the day and left it on a dish in the fridge covered with saran. I took it out about an hour before cooking. I'll definitely make this again.

great recipe BUT watch the servings. I had 6 hungry adults, served taters and vegetables and was barely enough. I would go 8 max.

Perfection. My husband is always worried about barbecuing for guests, but this was phenomenal. I put the rub on the meat the night before and let it sit almost 24 hours. The beef was so tender and delicious. Definitely a recipe we'll keep!

I was only cooking for 2 so, i grabbed 2 chateaubriand roasts instead and cut the ingridients down to an eigth.  It turned out phenomenal with a nice crust.  I made a red wine dijon reduction to dip the tenderloin into..  Very flavourful, even without a sauce.

Made this with filets instead of a whole beef tenderloin. This was lovely and I have been thinking about it all week. In fact, I made it again for friends a couple of nights ago.

This recipe is absolutely killer.  The herbs really make it pop without drowning out the flavour of the beef.  This is one of the few recipes that I make pretty much exactly as written.  Make sure you start with a good tenderloin and that you clean it well.  Use a meat thermometer and don't overcook.  It couldn't be simpler.  The second time I made this I considered using fresh thyme from my garden, but hey, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.  We usually make more than we need.  Nothing like filet and eggs the next morning followed by steak panini's for lunch.  Highly recommended!

Thanks for this awesome recipe. So far, I have made it twice. The first time was for Mother's Day. The wet rub is fabulous and came out wonderfully. The really great thing about this recipe is the fool-proof grilling directions. Follow them precisely and you will not be disappointed. If you need additional help with prepping your tenderloin, the Joy of Cooking has great detailed instructions. Also, if you are using a tenderloin in the 3.5LB range, you can half the recipe for the wet rub and there is still plenty. Thanks for the great recipe. It came out perfect and   rosy with a yummy, peppery grilled crust on the outside.

I made this using 2 lbs of filet mignon steaks and halving the rub.  It was cold and rainy outside, so I broiled my steaks until medium doneness.  They were delicious!

This is an absolute keeper. I made this for a cookout on Labor Day. It got rave reviews from everybody. I will definitely make this again, probably as an alternative to turkey  for the holidays.

Grilling tip (or for pan frying): allow the meat to come to room temperature first (say 70 degrees with a meat thermometer). To help even more, then place the meat in a 220 degree oven for about 20 minutes to bring the meat to about 120 degrees.  Then grill (or fry) to an internal temperature of 130-140. Let the meat rest at least 5 minutes before cutting. This process brings the interior to a warmer temperature so that the grilling time is reduced, and the sear doesn't need to be so long that it thickens the outside. I've used this trick for steaks and even expensive chateaubriand. Gives a medium rare, delicious meat.

Used this on a small beef tenderloin and one reviewers (rob) red wine dijon reduction sauce. It was fabulous. The meat had great flavor after only 30 min. of marinating and 20 min on the grill (it was only a 1.5lb roast). The sauce tipped it over the edge of greatness. Had to hunt pretty hard to find it but it was well worth it. We will make this over and over. For those of you wishing to try the reduction sauce click on rob foote review name below and follow to his page. Look at his recipes submitted, it is listed in a meat recipe he has. YUM

Roasted the meat instead of grilling and it came out delicious.  Used the herbs in lesser quantities so as to not overpower the flavor of the meat.  Will definitely make this again

This is a great recipe that won't over-power the taste of the meat.  I grilled two 5lb tenderloins for a party we had the other night.  The only thing I did different was that I seared the meat for 10 mins(5 mins each side) on my gas grill, then I transferred it over to my charcoal grill for the indirect cooking.  Whenever a rub has a large amount of olive oil in it, it has the tendency to flare up.   Which is never fun when you have expensive meat on the grill.   This recipe was AWESOME!  People are still talking about it 3 days later. Thank You.

We bought several of these to feed 40 of my husbands coworkers. We seasoned them as directed and cooked on the grill. There was none left at the end of the day. They were delicious.

This was absolutely fabulous.  I realized at the last minute that I did not have thyme, so I used a combination of basil, oregano and cumin in substitution for the 1 tablespoon of thyme.  It was also snowing pretty heavy when I was making this, so instead of putting in on the grill, I roasted in the oven at 350 degrees for a little over an hour to a perfect medium rare (let it rest for about 10 minutes after taking it out of the oven).  Then sliced it really thin with an electric knife and it melted in our mouths -- no steak knives needed at the table.  Enjoy!

I prepared a 7 lb. beef tenderloin for my supper club (5 couples).  It was AWESOME!  I also used the marinade/rub on a pork tenderloin the same weekend, and it was just as good!

I went astray on prep and cooking.  Mixed oil, garlic  etc.  together the day before.  Took roast out of fridge and slathered with mix and let rest about 2 hours before cooking. Wanting a rare to med rare roast I did not move to indirect heat or cover the grill at any time.  Used charcoal chimney full to the top to have a full pan of hot coals under roast.  Grilled a total of 25-30 minutes then let rest, tightly tented, for about 20 minutes.  Go ahead and trim the roast out all the way, no point in not removing silverskin  before cooking.

This is one great recipe.  My only suggestion is that depending on your grill, it takes nowhere near as long as they say on here.  Definitely use a meat thermometer, but mine was done about 15 minutes earlier than the recipe says and it was just a bit overdone.

FABULOUS!!  We broke with tradition and had a tenderloin for Easter and think we may not have a ham ever again!  Everyone LOVED it!!  Can't wait to try it on steak and chicken (maybe not so much pepper when we do chicken).

I made this for Easter and it was the best beef tenderloin I've ever had. Got many compliments.

I bought the meat at Costco and it was all trimmed for me.  I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect.  The marinade smelled wonderful and I would use that marinade on other meats.  

Everyone at the table got the meat cooked to their desire.  The ends were well done, the middle was med. rare.  

I did marinate the meat over night.

Love this recipe!! Made it times 4 for our annual Mmorial party and everybody went crazy.  Did a horseradish sauce with it for sandwiches and it was a huge success.  Since then my father-in-law requests it just about every Sunday dinner, I give in every couple of months.  Prepare exactly as written, just enough flavor!

I cut 1 long tenderloin in half, marinated the smaller side in a cracked pepper marinade and the other was just seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic, and seared them on the grill. Then I wrapped them in foil losely, and slow cooked them at 300 until 140 was reached. Incredible taste and guests only needed a  fork to cut them. These keep cooking a good 10 minutes after you pull them off.

This was ok, we made it with steaks instead of a roast...I am not sure if the cut really makes the difference. My daughter liked it though and she is a picky eater.

This recipe was exceptional!!!  I planned on a small dinner party with guests from Ireland.  13 people later, everyone said this was the best tenderloin they had ever had.  Thank goodness I planned on 2 tenderloins.

I have done this 2 times now and I have to say I only get rave reviews.  I do rub the tenderloin the night before and seal it in a bag till the next day.  The flavors just pop! Thanks for a great recipe!

We used this recipe to marinate nearly 30 pounds of tenderloin (of course we increased the ingredients proportionally!)  We sliced the finished product in 1/2-3/4 inches slices.  My husband got  RAVE reviews from the Canine Companions Club here is Sun City West.  I did add some generous glugs of Burgundy Wine.  It recipe and the directions were great!

This tenderloin is our Christmas tradition.  It is fabulous! We make 10-11 pounds to feed 12 adults and there is never any left over.  We also make it in the oven, as it's usually too cold to grill at Christmas in Minnesota, and it works beautifully.

We like our tenderloin rare to medium rare, so I reduced the cooking time by 15 minutes. It was perfect. (My charcoal grill was at 375 degrees)

Really appreciated the detailed grilling instructions to include use of butcher's twine.  My first time attempting to tie up a tenderloin and it came out perfect.  Great flavor.  We'll make this again as a favorite.

Although the meat was cooked to perfection, the combination of herbs was truly overpowering.   I will stick to my garlic, salt, & pepper  with horseradish/dijon sauce version which affords more appreciation for the taste of the beef.

I baked one filet at 350 for about 40 minutes instead of grilling (can't risk the smoke in my little apartment!) I'm giving the rub 5 stars since I didn't utilize the technique, it was DELICIOUS!

My husband and I use this for Elk and it is extraordinary!  The one thing I sometimes do is to leave out the peppercorns just because I think it takes away from the taste of the elk meat.  Otherwise - it's fantastic!  We clear the snow off the grill in the winter to cook this when we can.

My family loved this! I've made it several times for holidays and family gatherings. It is easy to prepare. I would suggest, if you are using a gas grill, to make sure the grease pan is clean when you start. We had a little problem with the high temps at the beginning starting a grease fire. No damage to the house or the tenderloin, thank goodness:)

This was my first whole tenderloin and it turned out GREAT! I used 1 tbsp of dried rosemary because I didn't have fresh. Otherwise, I followed the recipe and grilling directions exactly. The seasoning rub and searing made a delicious outer crust with just the right amount of seasoning. Taking it off the grill at 130 and letting it rest for 15 minutes under foil made it a perfect rosy medium, just like we like it. Thanks for a delicious and easy to follow recipe. I"m already looking forward to the left overs!

I was nervous as this is an expensive cut of meat. I followed the instructions exactly, using a gas grill and keeping the temp about 350 (one burner on my grill). It was amazingly easy. I used a meat thermometer to check for doneness. It was delicious!!  It turned out perfect and because I left one end nearer the burner, we had everything from rare to med well. Everyone got their choice. If you wanted to more evenly cook it,  I would rotate during cooking. This is an impressive dish but so easy!  I'm going to make it again for a party of 40, it is that easy!

This turned out great, though the meat cut was more than we used, I'll use the leftovers in Sheppards pie, pulled pork etc.  Overall turned out very very good.

I made this for a dinner party at our house this weekend.  I followed the recipe exactly as written and cooked it on the grill with the indirect cooking method.  It was fabulous!  Many rave reviews on how perfectly it was cooked.  I made sure to monitor the meat thermometer & did not allow it to go over 140 degrees.  Will definitely make again!

I made this for my daughter's birthday party. Everyone loved it. I did not have fresh rosemary so I used dried (you do have to adjust because dried is much stronger than fresh) and it worked fine.  I cooked it until meat thermometer registered 125 and the thick part was very rare. Next time I will let it go up to 130 and I think that will work better for my family, as we prefer medium rare.

This is our Christmas dinner recipe for the past few years.
It is the BEST!
We prefer to buy the meat already trimmed and tied---less hassle on an already busy day.

I made this for Christmas Eve dinner and it was a huge success.  My family loved it and is already asking me to make it again. I made it without modifications and let the rub sit on the roast for about 4 hours before grilling.  The five pound roast was just enough for 6 adult eaters with no leftovers.

We changed the pre-cook method by liberally salting the meat after trimming, then wrapping in plastic wrap and placing into the refrigerator. One hour before started cooking, we removed from the fridge and applied the marinade, leaving the roast out to warm up a little. We did a liberal coating of butter prior to putting it into the oven and used the Cook's Illustrated method for cooking tenderloin by the Low and Slow method at 300 degrees until coming to 120 degrees and then throwing on a blazing hot grill to sear the outside for a crust. You may also sear in a pan or griddle. Then before serving, we applied another layer of butter. There was none left out of a ten pound tenderloin, and I didn't even get but a bite. I saw grown men, in cocktail attire, standing at the buffet slipping slices of the tender meat and eating it out of their hands. Many, many compliments!

A new favorite!  Made the rub exactly according to the recipe and used on NY Strip and Filet. PERFECTION!  The thyme gives it a heavenly crusty char.  Served the steaks with fresh caprese salad and mashed cauliflower.  Seriously restaurant quality.  My only warning is to have an automatic pepper grinder if you're going to use fresh ground pepper.  That is a LOT of pepper to grind yourself!!  My hands still hurt as I type this... :-)

Made this for Christmas Eve and it was a big hit.  I put the rub on the tenderloin in the morning and wrapped it in plastic wrap. Cooked it in the oven at 350 degrees until the beef reached 130 degrees, let sit for 10 minutes.  It was perfect and the best flavor. Everyone raved about it.

Outstanding! We didn't have the foresight to put the rub on in advance, but we couldn't see how this could have been any better.  We followed the recipe exactly and served this for Easter brunch (alongside a honey ham). The men in particular just raved, and needless to say we had nothing left over for sandwiches the next day. Many, many thanks for this fabulous recipe!

I used an Eye of Round roast.  Seared all sides after rubbing olive oil, salt & pepper on it.  Cooled, then rubbed it with Rosemary & Garlic.  I put a thin layer of kosher salt over this and roasted it in the oven with baby potatos.  Served with Winter Squash!  Totally yummy!

Fantastic!  I now also use it on thicker steaks and it really pops.  Many compliments whether I am making tenderloin or just some thick ribeyes...  I use fresh thyme and I reduce the salt by half and it comes out great!

I made this using 1/2 recipe ,as there is only 2 of us. Husband loved it, came out nice and pink in the middle and "crunchy" on the outside. I did cut down the garlic to about 2 cloves.

Amazing! I made my own spice rub.  I followed the technique written in this recipe and it’s spot on!! Definitely clean the beef as instructed by removing the gray skin, the first time I made beef tenderloin I did not do that & the meat was tough. Tying the beef is also key. This was melt in your mouth! Thank you for the wonderful recipe.

We had a dinner party with this recipe as the main event.  It was a huge hit.  I grilled it on the Weber with just a little mesquite wood to  a very nice medium rare in the middle.  Definitely would do it again.

I made this tenderloin recipe for Christmas dinner and it was a huge hit. I put the herb paste on the day before and let it sit in fridge overnight. We grilled on hit charcoal as recipe said and checked temp with meat thermometer so we didn’t overlook. We took off the grill when it was 130-135 degrees. After resting we sliced into thicker pieces and thinner pieces for Mom. It was so tender and flavorful. Will make again soon.

Brilliant recipe and directions!   Turned out as an excellent substitute for turkey for our Christmas Day dinner!  
The only thing I would caution is to start checking the internal temp of the roast at around 35-40 minutes so you don’t over cook!

It was perfect on the grill.  I didn’t have string and my beef loin was cut in half inch slices so I used bamboo skewers that I soaked in water and used the skewers to combine the meat before marinating. Thank you for the recipe!

Had a 4lb filet-- cooked 3 min per each side and 10 minuted on each side when transfered to the nonheated side of the gas grill to render a medium rare to medium result.  The flavor with this wet rub is great!

I pretty much followed the recipe as written, except that I had a jar of diced garlic, so I used 6 tbsp of that. I had to pickup my son from school, so the meat sat on the grill for more than an hour. The center was grey (well done) and I feared the worst. 
It was so tender, and juicy as well. I still prefer my meat medium, but my wife actually does prefer her meat well done, so we both were pleased.  The cherry wood charcoal have it a nice pink smoke ring, and the flavor - O.M.G.!

What a great recipe! i cooked a 3 lb tenderloin and slightly reduced the quantities for the wet rub.
To ensure I produced a perfect medium-rare roast, I took the roast off at 125F and lightly tented it while resting (about 10 min). I left the temperature probe in while resting (the meat rose to 135F). Turned out fantastic!

I'd give it a 4.5 stars.  We let ours marinate overnight in a ziplok.  I used dried herbs (since that's what I had available).  I did add a dash of red pepper flakes for a little kick & it was awesome!

Served with horseradish sauce and the concensus was ALL thumbs up!

Thank you for a great recipe!!!!

This made a perfect and delicious filet.  All of my guests raved about it.  The rub was a great addition for added flavor.  The only change I made to the rub was the garlic.  I didn't use as much as it called for, more like 3 gloves and instead of mincing I used a garlic press and it was adequate, for me I don't want garlic to overpower the herbs. Followed the recipe except  for the garlic.  Made on a gas grill. Definitely a great main course for company.

This was a great way to get my first Beef Tenderloin done right! The "coating" was simple but effective, as we had children on the crowd I cut the black pepper to 1 tbsp. Using the string to hold it's shape was helpful, and 130 at the biggest part was slightly overdone for the medium->medium rare that seems to be the sweet spot. Next time I might try for 130 in a narrower spot to allow the thicker parts to be a bit more rare. The core rose over 10 degrees while "resting". I have a new Weber/iGrill mini and it was fascinating to watch the temperature during the whole cook and rest process.

Easy to make, and turned out great! Delicious! (A little too peppery for the young kids, but they ate it with ketchup...) I'll make that one again in the future for sure.

Excellent taste and very juicy! I coated the meat with the seasons in the morning and left in the fridge until dinner. Let it sit out for 30 min before grilling, then put it on a hot grill and kept rotating to brown evenly all over. Great recipe- thank you for sharing!

I grilled two whole filets for Easter dinner using this recipe.  I marinated them with the mixture overnight.  They were awesome!  The guests couldn't get enough, and, of all the meat offerings, these were the first to go!  I didn't do the tying with twine step.  I just kept the small tips toward the parts of my grill I know are cool spots.  It cooked perfectly!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is an awesome recipe.  I have made it exactly as written with a whole tenderloin, and I've used the rub on filets, rib eyes, t-bones, whatever.  It is absolutely delicious.  I've tried lots of rubs and marinades, and this one is my favorite. You can put the rub on a day before you grill or an hour before you grill. It's great either way.  I bet it would be good on chicken and salmon, too.

We use this recipe every time we grill a beef tenderloin.  Scrumptious!  We do not tie the roast with twine.  The narrow end is more done for those who prefer a more well-done beef, while the thick end is rarer.  I also throw all the other ingredients into a small food processor and the coating is done in seconds.  Have coated the meat and let it sit overnight.  The flavor is wonderful.  If there are any leftovers, they don't last long.

winner!  If you like medium rare use 135 degree internal temp before you remove and wrap in foil for 20+ min.  Check it at 40 minutes.

I had planned to make it exactly as written but then my ADD kicked in and I high jacked the recipe. I wound up making this recipe as a coffee crusted rub without the minced garlic (I used granulated garlic instead). Cooked it the same way and it was terrific.

This was probably the best piece of meat I have ever served.  Just EXCELLENT!  Did change up the spices at bit, had no thyme so subbed with cumin and it was great.

Recommended this to my brother for Christmas Day and he nailed it.  We doubled the recipe easily and pan seared the Tenderloins before putting them on a rack and cooked them in the oven.  Pulled them out at 120 Degrees and let them rest for 20 min.  Perfect!
