This is one of our favorite summer salads. This really works well with whatever pasta you have on hand. I like to make my own italian salad dressing mix and I do not add the additional salt. Sometimes, I'll cube up some cheese (any I have on hand, really) or throw in a quarter cup of shredded parmesan, just for flavor.

This is great addition to your summer recipes. Although my version would not be consider a "light" version. I add fresh mozzeralla, spicey olives, cubed pepporini and just before serving freshly grated romano cheese. Has always been a hit at my barbeque parties!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This is our favorite summer pasta salad, we add sliced black or green olives which ever we have at the time & canned plain or marinated artichoke hearts drained, we do like the spiral noodles as they hold onto the dressing. A great recipe!

This was a nice, simple pasta salad, and we really enjoyed it! I don't ever have fat free dressing on hand, so I used regular. I only had about 8oz. of spaghetti, so I adjusted accordingly, still using one whole packet of the dry Italian dressing mix (I did omit the extra salt). At the very end, I mixed in a bit of grated Romano cheese, and that added a nice touch. I really liked that this only used a few staples that I always have on hand...I will be making this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Per my own tastes, I usually use 1 package of spaghetti, 1/2-1 12 oz bottle of the dressing, Salad Supreme seasoning instead of the dry packet (approx 1/4 cup) and green onions instead of red.  Love it!

Yes I made some changed. I made this recipe for church pasta meal.  I put in onions, black olives, bacon bits, cucumbers,   raspberry vinaigrette.   I used the rest of the ingredients but omitted the tomatoes. Needless to say I came home with nothing left over. Everybody was saying how good it was and who made this.

I made this for my family.  They loved it, it was awesome.  I added just a touch more sugar.  It was perfect. Would highly recommend this recipe.  So refreshing.

This was excellent. I used shirataki noodles to make this a super low calorie snack. After being in the fridge for a couple days this was especially good. I used sunburst tomatoes cut into haves as someone had suggested grape tomatoes.

Excellent flavor. Added extra fresh garden veggies. I used Kraft roasted red pepper Italian dressing plus a few sprinkles of dried Italian  herb mix. It didn't last long. Will definitely make again.

This is one of my favorite summer salads. It's great because there is no mayo or egg so no refrigeration issues for an outside/picnic issue. I use 2 T of McCormick's Salad Supreme seasoning instead of the envelope of dry Italian dressing. It's a bit pricy, but it tastes wonderful and adds a wonderful color.

The salad was great. I made it for a dinner two days ahead because were going to be very busy. However I did not add the dried seasoning mix, instead I just put a little salt and pepper. I also added fresh mozzarella cheese cubes, and for protein a grilled turkey breast. Fabulous

I only made changes since I didn't have some of the ingredients.  I used yellow bell peppers instead of red, yellow onion instead of red.  I didn't have any tomatoes.  It was still good.  Loved it.

This is a great refreshing summer salad I really didn't make any changes but did use my own home made dry mix for Italian dressing. Have made many times and everyone loves it THANK YOU
