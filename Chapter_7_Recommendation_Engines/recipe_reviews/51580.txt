Good, but NOT good enough really to justify the amount of fat, and the very HEAVY feeling after eating this.  I don't have a problem with fattening dishes, or heavy meals, but they have to taste REALLY good to justify it.  This was mediocre.  VERY easy to make though.

I am a firefighter and cooked this for my crew. It was very quick, but the recipe is unclear whether you are supposed to add the pasta before you cook it or just throw it from the package into the sauce.  I cooked it then added it to the simmering sauce and crab. It was very dry when we ate it.  I would suggest adding some milk to the sauce and that should remedy the problem. VERY good flavor and VERY quick to prepare.  I will definitely make this again, if I ever need a quick nice meal.  Served it with a salad and garlic bread. Carb- and fat-city, but you only live once.  : )

I made this with fake crabmeat, and I used the alfredo recipe on this site - which was excellent.  Also, intead of angel hair, I used whole wheat linguine.  This was a very yummy meal and gorgeous with asparagus and french bread!  The alfredo doesn't keep too well however, so I'll try not to make so much next time.

This recipe is okay.  Im not to fond of imitation lobster meat but the real lobster meat did not look appealing.  Good but probably won't make again.

I didn't measure out 9 oz of pasta, so I'm sure that was cause for the lack of sauce....and it just seemed a bit bland to me.
