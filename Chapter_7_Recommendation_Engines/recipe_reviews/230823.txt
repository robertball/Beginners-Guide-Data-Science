I did not blend the soup as called for in the recipe but I did add a roux to it, which made it wonderfully thick and added another level of flavor to it. What I found though (because I made it twice) is that you want to add it the last hour that it is cooking. That way it will give it enough time to thicken up. The roux  I made separate and added in. I did it once right before serving and it was still soupy. The next time I did the roux I put it in about an hour before it was done  and it was nice and creamy thick.  I love this recipe, perfect for those cold winter days.

The soup is amazing! Previous reviews said that it was fairly bland so I made some important changes. The first thing I did was cook the leeks in 1/2 cup of butter, salt and pepper instead of oil. I then added the potatoes to the leeks and added the broth. Brought that to an oil until the potatoes were soft. Then I added the 1 cup of Heavy Cream. Salt and pepper to taste. I used bacon instead of ham. I did blend the soup and added the bacon on top. SOOOO GOOD! No shortage of flavor here!

As written, this is bland. However, this is a great base recipe. If you season it to taste, you can easily make it a 5 star recipe.

I made this as written except I used skim milk.  It's good - but bland, even though I added some ground cloves and nutmeg.  It's still missing something.  I might add some shredded cheddar cheese to melt in.

I pureed the soup; holding out about a cup of potatoes and all of the ham. Gave it great texture to the palate! :)

I like to add a little more flavor than salt & pepper. So I added a mix of spices. I garnished it with sharp cheddar and tarragon.
