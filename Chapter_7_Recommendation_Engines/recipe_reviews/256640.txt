Mercy, this is delicious!!! I made my own oil and vinegar dressing using olive oil and balsamic glaze, and the use of simple ingredients in this flavorful dish is PERFECTION! It will be a family favorite--my 14yr old loved it and told me I should 'cook like this all the time.' Bravo--thanks for a wonderful recipe.

Used a toaster oven and set a thermometer in the chicken as to not overcook.  Loved it and very easy!

Omg!! This is amazing!  I used my own salad dressing with a balsamic vinegar. It smelled so good cooking that the guy who was delivering Chinese food next door peeked in my screen door and asked what I was cooking! Lol!

I really like the caprese flavors and ease of preparation of this dish!  Cooking in the Panasonic Countertop Induction Oven definitely makes this an even easier dish.  If I were to make this again I believe I would use strips of chicken to speed up cooking a little, as it definitely took more than 15 minutes to cook.  I would also add the basil later in the cooking process as it did overcook fairly significantly- I would probably add the mozzarella a little before the chicken was cooked through as well to prevent overcooking while the cheese is melting.  Overall the flavors are great and this one is worth playing around with!

Wow, this is delicious! A recipe how I like it - few ingredients, lots of flavor, and easy to put together. When we make it next time, we think we will add a red sauce to it.

I came up with this simple and quick Caprese Chicken recipe with fresh ingredients in my Panasonic Countertop Induction Oven!  It is so easy and yet so tasty.  It pairs wonderful with pasta or a side salad!

Great recipe! Easy and flavorful. I used zesty Italian dressing. Put all ingredients in a zip lock bag (except for the mozzarella cheese) and let it marinate for several hours. Placed in an 8 x 8 pan, added the cheese once the chicken reached 160 degrees.  It was wonderful!

Wonderful dish. I substituted Italian dressing in lieu of vinegar and oil. My supermarket didn't have fresh basil so I had to use freeze dried basil. it was a great dish everyone loved it and yes I will make this again.

It was good but I felt it needed more seasoning. I would use fresh garlic and some Italian seasoning mix next time

This is a very refreshing meal for summer. I did make a little change and used a cilantro lime dressing on the chicken in place of oil and it added a real citrus tang. Highly recommend!
