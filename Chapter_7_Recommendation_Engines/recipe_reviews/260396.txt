I'm giving this five stars because my end result was really tasty.  I have a question though...was there supposed to be some Taco Seasoning of some sort in the recipe and maybe it was mistakenly omitted?  I got all my ingredients out to make and realized I must have left the cauliflower at the store but because I had 2 pounds of beef and I figured the cauliflower was just going to be 'filler,' I thought I could continue without. I had just finished my 48 hour chicken bone broth so after I finished browning the beef, onions and diced chiles (store didn't have jalapenos in a can) I added just one cup of broth and the cream cheese then the tomatoes, salt and pepper.  So my end result was kind of like a creamy, beefy goulash!  It is so good that I wrote down everything I did exactly and will definitely make again the same way, although at some point I may try fresh Jalapeno peppers - see if that kicks it into Taco tasting mode.

Used Rotel tomatoes and added Taco seasoning.  The burger needs to be seasoned while it cooks.  It tasted really bland.  Next time I will use garlic and onion powders.  Used riced cauliflower to hide it better.  We thought it was just OK.  Don't know if I would make it again.

Will not make again.... no taco flavor at all. Tried adding a package of taco seasoning, sour cream and cheddar cheese.
Still no good.. maybe I just can’t get past the cauliflower taste and texture??  Family wouldn’t eat it either, a waste ??
