I wouldnt call them cookies, but its really good. I covered it while it was cooling so my family couldnt raid it, but by the time I came back, it was almost completely gone anyways. Great recipes.

delicious recipe, a hit at work.  I changed a few things.   I used sliced almonds and orange juice instead of the walnuts and lemon juice.  I pulsed the almonds in a blender to create a finer texture.  I also added 1 c. white chocolate chips to the cream cheese batter and topped it with 1 c. semisweet choc chips.  Will definitely make again!

This was SOOOO GOOD.... I followed the instructions EXCEPT after I removed the crust from the oven the first time I added a thin layer of caramel (32 individually wrapped caramels, unwrapped 5 tablespoons heavy cream) and then added my cream cheese filling... I also almost double the crust just so that the top could be completely covered... YUM!!!

Does anyone know if you combine the butter and brown sugar or the butter and white sugar or both together to make the crust?????

Great recipe! I melted raspberry preserves in the microwave, then swirled the preserves into the cream cheese mix once i poured it into the pan! I'll definitely make this recipe again!

Outstanding. I ended up making it in a round cake pan, so it's more like a "pie".  I failed to save some of the crumbs to add to the top of the pie.  I can't wait to make this again so that I can do that.  The crumb crust is sensational!  I will use that part of the recipe for every cheesecake I ever make again!  Delicious :)

This would be my second time making this. I used a 9"x13" pan and doubled the recipe; increased lemon juice 2 Tbsp. What I did differently this time was that after I'd poured the cream cheese mixture over the hot crust, I baked it at 300F instead of 375F. (My oven can get overheated than the temperature set. So, 325F should be good enough if your oven doesn't have temperature problem.) After the 20 minutes are up, I turned the oven off and left the pan of cookies in the oven with door shut for 1 hour 30 minutes. (But two hours should be fine as well.) This is what some people do when they make cheesecake. It prevents the cookie crust and cream-cheese layer from getting overdone. It also prevents the surface of the cheese layer from cracking. This yummy treat is best served when chilled. Enjoy!

After reading the prior reviews, I made the following changes: added a container of raspberries to the top layer of crust, prior to baking 12 mins.  I wanted to try blueberries (per another review) but they're not in season- next time.  I added 1/3 cup of sugar (instead of 1/4 cup) to the cream cheese mix and 3 tsp of lime juice (instead of 1 tsp lemon juice).  Baked in a 8x8 square dish.  This recipe turned out wonderful.  But I can't imagine not adding some type of fruit as a middle layer.  I don't like things super sweet so this was perfect for me.  I look forward to having it with coffee.

Yummy, I added fresh blueberries on top of the cookie layer and then baked.  Baked again with the cream cheese layer on top, delicious.  Should have added more blueberries, though.

These are a really good cheesecake substitute. However, not quite as good as real cheesecake. My only complaint is that it is a little too heavy and not as creamy as cheesecake. Otherwise, quite yummy!

Very good and rich.  Not really cookies, they are bars.  I added a bit more lemon juice and some zest.  Could have used more.  More like mini cheesecake to me.

Why a 5 star?  Because I can make this ahead of time and then freeze it and it is ready for guests or pot luck.  Everyone loved it.  I did add lemon zest to it.  It is a winner!

It went well with my cup of joe but I don't see myself making this again.  It lacked the cheesecake taste and the crust was too doughy.  The reviewer that mentioned adding a layer of blueberries is on the right track.

Making this for the second time today. This time I'm going to add some grated lemon rind to punch up the lemon flavor a bit. 

All in all a great, easy and attractive recipe. If the lemon rind works this will be sent off to a friend to pay off a long overdue bet I lost.

I made these last night and after reading the reviews I decided to add more flavorings,(vanilla, lemon juice and  lemon zest ) and I added a bit more sugar but it still wasn't enough.  It is a nice snack when you're in a pinch but it won't be my "go to" until I " tweak it"  a bit more.

Really yummy! =).  To give it more of a tropical/summer-like flavor, I omitted the egg and used a banana, and also used Dole's pina colada juice instead of lemon juice.

I also did not use nuts--but only because I didn't have any!  I made the cookie-part twice (using one mixture for the bottom and another for the topping).  For the bottom one, I added a couple tablespoons cornmeal to try to get a little bit of a crunch, but I didn't do that for the top.

It was delicious and I plan to make it again really soon!

I do not understand the rave reviews on this one. I used 3t lemon juice & still could barely taste it. It is also not very sweet & all you can taste is the cream cheese. I will not make this again but a word of advice, if you want stronger lemon flavor add lemon zest or extract. If you like your desserts sweet, I strongly recommend increasing BOTH sugars.

Awesome and easy! My 9 yr. old son and I made these for Dad on Valentine's Day. I used my food processor for the walnuts. The simple ingredients were great because we were snowed in so I had to use what was on hand. We'll definitely make these again.

These weren't at all cookies, but were very good. I added white baking chocolate to the the cream cheese mixture and chocolate chips on top. The white chocolate was great but I think I'll leave out the chocolate chips next time. Yummy!

Very good and easy to make!  I copied a previous reviewer and put the walnuts in a food processor so the crust had a more even texture.  Everyone who tried one really liked it.  I will definitely make this again!

This is a recipe from the Pillsbury 16th Bake Off.  I've been making it for 50 years!  I was glad to find it.  However, some details were left out...like Reserve 1 cup of crumb mixture for the topping, not just some.  You will need 1 cup.
Also, I bake mine at 350 degrees, not 375.
But they are they BEST!

VERY GOOD EASY  I followed recipe exactly and turned out very well. Next time I will experiment with other reviews suggestions. Froze. Good as squares but also handy 
for single dessert with raspberry purée drizzled over  .

Very good! Not really a cookie, but who cares? Yummy! :) I will make them again, but next I'll double the cream cheese layer. Then they will be perfect. :)
I deducted a star for two reasons, the first being that I think there needs to be more of the cream cheese layer (easy fix), and the second reason is that the instructions were a bit vague, which was not an issue for me, I know what I'm doing, but someone a bit more inexperienced would probably have trouble following it. Recipes need to be written with the novice in mind. :)
All in all, a keeper. Quick, easy, delicious.

Less sugars make this a good low carb dessert.  And the non dieting men of the house liked it too.  Was surprised the powdery crust actually formed a crust.  Was worried but turned out ok .

As written this is OK, but not good enough to make again. Nothing great, nothing bad either.  It's probably great with chocolate or caramel on top as per some of the reviews.

This is delicious.  I was sitting here reading over the reviews one evening around 10PM and it was calling my name and I had to get up and make it. Didn't have quite a whole 8 oz cream cheese so I only added the egg, sugar and vanilla to be sure mixture remained thick enough.  Had to add an extra tbsp of butter for crust to hold together.  Hubby who isn't a big sweets fan asked for seconds. Yummy!  Update 5/23/14  Made with an entire cream cheese as recipe calls for, used 1 tsp vanilla n 1/2 tsp almond extracts, still omitted milk. Hubby who is a HUGE cheesecake fan said "at the risk of ruining his status as cheesecake being his fav dessert, this is better."  This is an enormous compliment to you Debbie Evans. Thanks for this great recipe.

Great tasting bar cookie. I used homemade butter and cream cheese. (Have our own cow!) Oops, I was multitasking at the time, baking other cookies , and forgot to bake the crust first. I had already spread the cream cheese mixture on, so I increased the bake time ten minutes .... worked fine.

These were not bad, but definitely not my favorite dessert. For one, they don't have much of a cheesecake taste to them. You should at least double the filling. The crust was actually very good, which is why I gave 3 stars. After I mixed together the filling, I was a bit wary about pouring it over the crust- since the filling was very watery. (Not how you would expect a filling to be.) But it ended up baking correctly, I just didn't taste enough cheesecake which is the main reason I didn't like these very much.

These were yummy!  I made exactly as written except didn't add walnuts (didn't have them) and these turned out really good.  I wish I would have reserved more crust for the top, might double next time.  It had a good 'praline' kind of taste to it.  Thanks for sharing!

This is a great recipe.  I didnt save any crumbs for the topping, I was afraid it would turn out looking like a sandwich or an oatmeal cream pie.  I loved how it turned out this way too, a thick cookie crust and cream cheesy top.  I put semi sweet chocolate chips in the cream cheese layer and it is good, but a bit overpowering.  Might not use so many next time.

Really really good bars.
I used macadamia nuts rather than walnuts and lime juice instead of lemon juice.

For some reason, this recipe did not turn out good at all.  The edges burned and it seems like the cream cheese topping waasn't enough.  The whole thing simply tasted burnt.

One word - YUM!  I try to modify dessert recipes to reduce the sugar, so in this case I used baking Splenda in place of the white sugar, and splenda/brown sugar blend.  I also used whole wheat flour instead of white flour.  Of course it would have tasted better with the real thing but it was still delicious!  I will make these again (and again, and again)!

Very tasty.  My co-workers loved this when I brought it to a holiday party.  I made these in a springform pan to make them look more cheesecake-like.  Also, I substituted pecans for the walnuts since that's all I had on hand at the time.  For a more Christmas-y look, I also mixed in some red and green Christmas tree sprinkles into the cheesecake mixture and sprinkled them on top as well.  The only reason I rate this a four is because the cream cheese topping came out very sweet; so I might try tweaking this a little to lessen the sweetness.
