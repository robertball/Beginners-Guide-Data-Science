This was not great but not horrible either.  I just prefer tradional potato salad better.

Oh, I'm sorry to tell the author of this recipe that it was quite bad.  I've made about 10 salads from this site over this summer and this is the only one that we each took one bite of and had to throw away.  It really was that bad.  I think a lot less paprika would make it...tolerable.

I'm not a fan of regular potato salad, 
but I like ranch dressing, so I was 
eager to try this recipe.  It turned 
out very well.  I added some diced 
carrots for color and extra nutrition.

I liked the fact that ranch salad dressing is added to the recipe. Makes for a nice, zesty flavor.  Just make sure you don't overcook your potatoes like I did, then you wind up with a green pea mush.  I will probably make this potato salad again.  Hopefully, I will have better luck next time.

good variation of a classic recipe. i doubled the recipe, used light sour cream instead of mayo & added some diced red bell peppers for extra color, as well as a little garlic powder and some dried parsley. also, i didnt mix the paprika in with the potatos, i sprinkled it on top instead. my husband and i both enjoyed this and i will make this again in the future. thanks for the recipe!

This is a great way to have a low fat potato salad.  I also love ranch dressing!  I used Wishbone 2 good light ranch dressing.  I used this for a picnic and it got great reviews!

I got mixed reviews on this.  At 28.4 grams of carbs per serving I am surprised the recipe comes from the American Diabetes Assoc.  I probably wouldn't make this again as written but I am glad I gave it a try.  It has potential.   Oh - also I used red onion in addition to the green onions for a bit of added color.
