Really good! I made a couple changes because I had some different things in the pantry and also because we like things real spicy! Guacamole: I added a few squeezes fresh lime (or lemon) and a lot of hot salsa, also 1/3 chopped onion and 7 or 8 slices of jalapeno.  Burger: 2/3's onion instead of green onion 1/2 tsp chili powder 15 jalapeno slices 1 piece of bread put through food processor I didn't use the green chile's  I also used smoked provolone cheese instead instead of cheddar. It was sooooo delicious! Great recipe!  Oh ya, also, for the kids I just saved some of the ground chicken and bread crumbs and added some salt and pepper, chicken Worcestershire sauce and Parmesan cheese. I made them in tiny patties and my son said it was the best chicken nugget he ever had!

These were delish! I used ground turkey and added some cumin and chili powder and topped with pepper jack cheese.  I was afraid they would be dry, but they turned out so good! I paired with sweet potato fries for a guilt-free burger & fries! Hubby said this definitely needs to go into permanent rotation!

These were so yummy!  I felt like I was eating a gourmet specialty burger at a pricey restaurant.  The only things I did differently were omitting the jalapeno (because I didn't have any) and I added a diced tomato to the guacamole before blending.  I highly recommend this recipe!

Made this for a dinner with my girlfriends and it was a hit.   Cut the oregano at least in half (and that was still too much in my opinion), and added about 1/2 tsp ground cumin.  I used two avacados and added the juice from a lime to the guacamole, and made smaller patties and put on slider buns.  Yummy!  It's a 5-star for me with these additions.

When I read the recipe it sounded great and I took the advice of another reviewer by adding bread crumbs.  The burgers fell apart on the grill so I switched them to the oven, but they still did not stay together.  The oregano was too strong also.  I wont make this again.

I can't resist making changes to recipes, but this turned out amazing.     Used less oregano, salt and garlic. Added a bit of white pepper, green hot sauce and cumin. Left out the black pepper and jalepeno. Added about 6 crushed saltines and an egg. Fried them and served them on pita buns topped with salsa, sour cream, cilantro and sliced avocado.    They were spicy and fresh flavoured. Will definitely make again.

we broil them in our largest cast iron skillet, 8-10 minutes on each side.  so yummy.    we also substitute onion and garlic powders for the real thing, i dont like the way they crunch!  used 5 fresh jalapenos, red and green, seeded.  i added some frank's hot sauce to the burgers.

These were easy and delicious! A favorite of my boyfriend's. I cooked them on the stove top, about 4-5 mins per side. They got a little crispy but were still so good.

YUM! These were wonderful! I have made chicken burgers quite a few times before and have found that they work best (less sticky and hard to flip) if you use an egg and some bread crumbs, I added 1/4-1/3 cup. I stuffed these with the cheddar inside and topped with guac (that I added cilantro, lime juice, chopped jalapeno and red pepper too). Thanks for the recipe:)

I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't add as much chili as suggested because I wasn't sure how spicy it would turn out for the kids. Everyone enjoyed it.
With the guacamole, I left out the sour cream and replaced it with half an onion which I also added to the food processor.
I served with a delicious mango salsa which complimented it perfectly.

This was a great recipe!  Not a fan of ground chicken, and my hubby and kids are haters, lol, but I made these as sliders the other night just because they sounded really good (I did cheat and used premade guac) but followed the burger recipe to a t, and they were awesome!  Am making again this weekend for guests!  I served them on toasted buns and with fries on the side sprinkled with southwest seasoning, and the meal was a HUGE hit!!!

Per other suggestions I changed some spices: the oregano to 3/4 tsp rather than 1 TBS and added 1 tsp cumin.  I cook with ground chicken breast frequently and I've found both meatballs or burger patties cook great under the broiler and stay together.  Just make sure to put foil on your pan for easy clean up.

Excellent.  We used ground turkey instead.  This is a keeper.  I'm only giving 4 stars because as is written, the burgers were too "wet" and I had to add breadcrumbs.  I usually don't like turkey or chicken burgers, but this had me going back for seconds (well, half seconds - split the seconds with hubby).

Everyone needs to make these burgers! Delicious and different. Next time, I'll include the seeds from the jalapeno, because the guac cools everything down nicely. And maybe add a little lemon juice to the guac to make it greener. Loved it.

I was a little worried when the chicken mixture was very wet, but the burgers came out great. This was a great alternative to a standard meat burger. I will definitely make these again.

We thought the flavor was terrific!  The burger mixture is quite wet so I cooked them on the stove, which worked fine.  Also there is enough meat for 5-6 patties.

These burgers were so good!  I used ground turkey because my store was out of ground chicken and substituted finely minced fresh garlic for the powder. (Didn't serve these with guacamole so cannot rate that.) I agree with some of the other reviewers that there was too much oregano so next time I'll cut it back to 1 tsp and try adding some cumin.  I cooked these in a grill pan on top of the stove, so the fact the mixture was very wet wasn't an issue at all - they held firmed up nicely as they cooked.  My son said these were "add to the regular rotation" good!  Thanks for sharing!!

as is I give it a 3: for the guac it is missing the lime juice; that was easy to fix/added 1 TB lime juice. The burgers: too much onion and chili/jalapeno pepper for one little pound of meat. Half the salt: 1 tsp for 4 burgers is too much sodium. 1n tsp instead of  TB oregano/too much oregano. I did like it after all were cut in half. A keeper with changes....but I rate em "as written"

These were even more delicious than I expected. My 8-yr-old tore them up.  The texture of the meat was too loose for the grill, though, so we cooked them inside. Handled gently, they maintained their shape just fine. I'll double the qty of guac next time for dipping on the side!

This burger was good. I made it as the recipe states but instead of cheddar cheese I used Pepper Jack. I wil try and use cheddar next time for more flavor. I also omitted oregano because my Husband doesn't like it.

These were good burgers. We followed the directions exactly and were satisfied with the end result. I served them on a whole wheat bun with some oven fries. I would make again!

Oh my... These were to die for!  My husband surprised me with these one day when I was late getting home from work - I was in H E A V E N!!!  A glass of wine and one of these burgers?  There wasn't much more I could ask for.  Unfortunately we're under an outside fire ban right now or we'd be having these every week!!

I thought this was very bland.  I had never used ground chicken before so was not sure what to expect.  The mixture was so watery the chicken would not hold together.  i had to add quite a bit of bread crumbs to get it to hold together.  This probably added to the blandness of the burgers.  Most likely would not make this again.

I made the mistake of buying dark meat, and the mixture was way too soupy for the grill. I fried them, and they were fantastic! Thank you, Kelly!

Ken, Jackie, Kim & Jeremy liked this.  Wouldn't try to get the girls to try it as it is full of green things.  Ken would like to leave the cheese off, not me!  Also, the patties are real sticky, but when the grill is oiled and the patties are left on the grill for the 5 minutes without turning, the patties didn't stick.

Ok, 5 stars is for taste.  This burger is so hard to eat that it's hard to say I'll make it again.  Next time I will make it an open-faced burger and eat it with a knife and fork.  Worse than eating a sloppy Joe.  But so good!  Couldn't bbq it either with the consistency, had to pan fry and it worked great!  Lower the amount of sour cream and cilantro in the guac.  Other than that, great!

This recipe called for way too much peppers/onions for the amount of meat that is listed. I suggest trimming it down by half. The meat was too sticky and fell apart so it was impossible to put on the grill. You may want to add some flour or thoroughly drain/pat the chicken meat before adding the ingredients. The taste of the meat was good, but the guacamole was not right. Maybe some lime juice may have helped.

My husband is a picky eater but we both love spicy food. I made the burgers per the recipe but left out the guacamole. They were excellent! Very juicy and full of flavor! I would recommend trying these to anybody. They will certainly get put into our dinner rotation here!

Although I really enjoyed the burger, I think the oregano was a bit much.  My family commented that it tasted a lot like the meatballs I make.  Other than that the flavor was good.  Maybe its a personal taste, but Im going to double on the green chili peppers and the jalepenos.   I couldnt feel the effect of either peppers in the burger- and i know it wasnt spicy, but at least the flavor should have been more prominent.  I made my own guacamole because I dont believe that sour cream is needed in a good guac.   Other than that I will definitely make this again.  It was moist and aside from the strong oregano did taste quite good.  Also- instead of cheddar, I think pepperjack is in order to give it more of that southwestern flavor that it deserves.

Great mixture! My first time making chicken burgers and loved it. I love guacamole so I figured I couldn't go wrong! I didn't have the jalapeno pepper though so I used cayenne pepper to make it spicy. Loved it all the same!

I don't know if it was something I did wrong, but the texture of these was very sausage like. For the kids we omitted the jalapeno, but left in the green chilis. I will try again with ground turkey or a ground turkey,chicken combo.

I think these have the potential to be a good burger, but I made them according to the recipe and there is WAY to much oregano in them.  I would cut it by half if not by more.  Might try again with a few of the other suggestions as well like the addition of cumin.

Four stars only because I made significant changes.  Great base recipe which gave the an idea for how to use the wild turkey in my freezer that I shot in the spring.  Our burgers turned out FANTASTIC!  I used an electric grinder and ground up 1/2 of the turkey breast (2-3 pounds), then also ground about 3/4 pound of bacon ends and pieces to mix with the turkey.  Added cumin as others suggested and used fresh pressed garlic.  With the addition of the bacon the burgers held together very well on the grill and stayed nice and juicy.  After grilling 5 minutes per side, I topped them with swiss cheese and served on a toasted hard roll with my guacamole, lettuce and homemade salsa. This was my version of a Green Chili Bacon and Swiss Grilled Turkey Burger!  YUM!

Pretty good burgers... a little on the spicy side. I used ground turkey rather then chicken, and added 1.5 tsp cumin. Also added some diced tomato to the guacamole. I'll be making these again.

this recipe was so good, I didn't have the chicken but did have ground turkey and it turned out great!  It was so juicy and the spices were just right.  I made this with my daughter and she and hubby raved about it.

These are delicious!  A very nice change from a regular burger.  I used ground turkey rather than chicken.  Also made a different guacamole recipe from this site b/c this guac seemed a little boring.

We just used the chicken patty part of the recipe and added our regular guacamole.   Even after chilling int the refrigerator, the patties were wet.  It was like putting oatmeal on the grill.... but surprisingly they came out great!

I am a beef guy. Rare to find a burger made with chicken or turkey that I find memorable or comparable. That being said, this burger was simple and quite tasty! I used turkey cause that’s what was on sale and what a success. The avocado “spread” had a little spice and was a perfectly mild condiment to the burger. I did add lime juice to ensure it didn’t turn brown but not enough to taste. The cheddar cheese, meh, not sure it really added anything. I may go cheeseless next time or go for something a little different like gouda. Have a thermometer handy and pull off the grill at 165, let them rest and you will have actually JUICY burgers, even using chicken or turkey. Awesome recipe thanks for sharing!

These are delicious. I don't make the quac from this recipe but just the burgers. They are delicious. I cook them in a pan, ground chicken is too loose to cook onthe grill. If you add more panko or breadcrumbs maybe, but I like doing it inside anyway.

For the ingredients in this I was a little disappointed. I felt it was a little bland considering what went into it. I also found that ground chicken is actually rather difficult to come by, might use ground turkey next time instead.

This was good, but I was disappointed that the burgers didn't hold together so well, even with draining the chilies. I used already prepared guacamole instead of making homemade, and topped the burgers with mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar. The boyfriend thought it didn't have a lot of flavor, even with all the ingredients! I'll try again, but use less chilies next time.

I'm giving this a 5 based on the ground chicken patty and all the seasonings in it. Tasted Great! I see myself making this again someday.  I didn't have all the ingredients for the avocado sauce. So I made a spicy yogurt & lime sauce instead.

The burger isn't bad, the guacamole was marginal.  Had to doctor the guac up a bit.  I had to add a slice of bread that I ran through the food processor for texture since the burger was too mushy to grill.  I'd make again, but not as a regular.
