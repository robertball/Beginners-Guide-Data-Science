My husband is a Stokie and cant live without his oatcakes.  He loves to put them under the broiler with cheese and bacon.... cant say the oats help the cholesterol that way!  Make these a day or two ahead, stack them on a plate and cover with saran wrap.  They are great for quick lunch with tuna or chicken salad.  They are wonderful re-warmed wrapped around scrambled eggs or cheese.

I wonder if I did something wrong with this, because my batter was so thick it was not at all spreadable.  I had to add alot more liquid to even begin to spread it and it took a long time too cook, and came out rather tough and doughy.  Something was wrong with the liquid/dry ratio.

I've just made these for New Years' Breakfast.They are much thicker and denser than pancakes that we are used to. Directions say "spoon to make a thin pancake," but my batter was much too thick to spread.

Something is wrong with the proportions in this recipe. The oatcakes should be like crepes. The batter in this recipe is much too thick.

ok everything is pretty close except I used 2 cups of milk and 2 cups of water heated until warm then add i tea spoon of sugar and one packet of yeast . stir and letr sit for 5 minutes so yeast can react with sugar . then add 1 cup of oat flour and 1 cup of all purpose flour and 1 teaspoon of salt / i use a hand mixer to blend everything . let sit cover for 1 hour . i then heat the skillet and add mixture i usually roll the skillet so mixture covers the skillet . heat first side until all the bubbles have popped then flip and cook other side for another minute or 2 you'll get the hang of it . usually makes about a dozen to 14 . i like mine buttered or with cheese whizz or even jam or jelly . they are also good with bacon and cheese . they also freeze very well . time consuming but worth it . enjoy .

Increased liquid/flour ratio to 2:1. Used 1 package of yeast. Added 1 tsp baking powder before frying in hot griddle.

I use loose oats and put them in the blender to make flour. Keep the mix warm throughout the process. I add up to 2 cups of warm water after the mix has risen. The mix needs to be watery, but don't overdo it as it breaks up during the cooking if its too thin. Being from Staffordshire, but now in the colonies, and even had visitors from home, smuggle oaties in for me I am now very happy I can enjoy these any time I want them! No need to freeze, just bag them and keep in refrigerator, they will be gone in no time! Comfort food, 2min 15sec in the microwave or better still, grill them with the contents of your choice, bacon, cheese, beans, egg, or all of the above :-)
