My boyfriend loved these. Use chicken with herbs soup for more flavor. You can also make this in pie pan, just put Bisquick mixture on top and bake.

I liked it, I wanted to save time so I used a large drained can of chicken. Mine was not salty at all. It got family approval

Really tasty, but a little dry, I would make it again but maybe add more cheese or inject cream of potato soup after baking

I cheated big time.  I used left over baked chicken and Bisquick biscuits from a tube.  I pressed a biscuit into the muffin tin and pushed the sides up.  I put a little Mexican Fiesta blend cheese in the bottom and on the top of each mini pie & covered them with a flattened biscuit.  I made a few for myself minus the cheese & they were slightly dry.  But still very edible.  But the cheese lover who lives here munched down three of the ones with cheese and we froze the rest for quick snacks.  I will make these again.

For some reason it was WAY to salty! We tend to not use salt at all so I only used half of what was called for and it was still too much to even enjoy the recipe. Sorry, but this one is not a keeper!

Not very flavorful. If I made this again I would add some cream of chicken soup or something to make more sauce.

The husband and 4 yo really enjoyed these little minis. I didn't especially. Yes, definitely edible, but they are quite bland even after additional seasoning. They were just salty enough but lacked any sort of flavor depth. Great recipe for inspiration. I'll try it again with a rotisserie chicken, cornbread mix, yellow rice, saffron, scallions, red pepper flakes and curry. Maybe broccoli and cheddar baked in a stuffing mix too. Go easy on the filling as leftovers get a gross, soggy bottom. It's safe to fill up to the top of the cups with the bisquick mix. It doesn't really expand like I expected it to.

These were okay.  We concluded that more herbs might have helped, but in the end, the effort spent would have been better suited on another meal.

I had to improvise with what I had available. instead of chicken broth I used turkey gravy and a can of mixed vegetables I used half the juice from that mix them together then I added garlic powder as an extra seasonings and sauteed my onions with the chicken and I didn't have time so I ended up using marjoram which can replace thyme.
