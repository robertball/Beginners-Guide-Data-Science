Made this to a T even bought the espresso powder, yes it came out like a pudding type pie as that is basically what it is without eggs as a thickener. Mine set up beautifully and I made my own chocolate whipped cream it was divine. Thank you Oz!

This turned out perfectly! I noticed other reviewers had trouble getting their pies to set up, so I added two eggs and my pie set up beautifully! I also added a teaspoon of vanilla, and sprinkled the top of the pie with instant espresso and nutmeg before baking. If you try this, add the espresso halfway through. I ended up with burnt espresso on top, which didn't taste too bad, but  the aroma wasn't pleasing. Also, don't go too heavy with the espresso because it can be pretty strong. We also decided to use a graham cracker crust, which was extra delicious. Hope this helps!!

This was yummy! I didn't have espresso powder, so I used 1/2 tbsp instant coffee and 1/2 tbsp cappuccino powder. I also used some dark choc cocoa and cream to make some choc whipped cream and it was great! So easy! Everyone loved it! Will definitely make this again. :)

I'm only giving this four because it didn't set up.  We're going to try making it again, because it was delicious!!  It was just more like a delicious espresso pudding in a crust.  We'll update if the next time is better - it's worth repeating!
