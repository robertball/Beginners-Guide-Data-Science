Easy to prepare, delicious the day after, and my picky little sister loved it too. This is a great dump recipe as well, pearl barley is begging for companions in the pot!

Great vegan main dish if you sub out the butter for either oil or vegan margarine, and chicken stock for veggie stock.  I didn't have any mushrooms on hand, so I cubed up a medium zucchini instead. Moreover, I made mine on the stove top. After sauting the ingredients as suggested, I added the stock and brought it to a boil, then covered and simmered on low for 40 minutes. I then left it covered for another 20 and it was slightly saucy and so good!

This was a tasty, different side dish. I used 1 T. oil instead of 3 T. marg, and subbed the green pepper with a red one. That made it a bit sweeter and added a splash of color. I didn't have a Dutch Oven so I just cooked the dish entirely in a pot and it was excellent.

Yes, I will make this again.    I had to use chicken bouillon cubes for the stock as  I didn't have my homemade chicken stock.
Next time I'll use my homemade stock as it is much less salty.
As other readers have mentioned, this recipe lends itself to a variety of  other ingredients.  When I have made it less salty I'll give it 5 stars.  Thank you.

I made it just like the recipe except I added a little dried sage and oregano and used red pepper instead of green.  It took about 40 minutes to bake  to al dente, then turned off the oven and let it sit for about 10 more minutes to absorb the rest of the liquid. Definitely delicious!!!

I have now made this three weeks in a row.  It is absolutely delicious!  The grandchildren even take it for their lunches.  My daughter-in-law is allergic to peppers so I add more mushrooms.  Last evening, just before serving, I stirred in a cup of grape tomatoes, halved. They added lots of color.  I can see adding many different chopped vegetables to it...........just a terrific recipe, and so healthy!

This is a very tasty dish and great base casserole if you want to add your own vegetables. I would maybe cut back on the butter a smidge as it seemed abit much. Otherwise, I'll definitely make this again.

I really enjoy this and have made it several times.  Like the others have said you can add any veggies you like to change the flavor.  I also use vegetable broth instead of chicken broth.

So delicious. I omitted the green pepper by accident and it was still awesome. Since I didn't have any pearl barley, I used pot barley and just soaked it overnight. This dish was easy and delicious. I will definitely be making it again.

Really love this healthy side dish. You can get creative about the amount and type of veggies to add and add black beans to make it a full vegetarian meal.

I put in onions, garlic, celery, mushrooms, red pepper and garlic scapes. I also added a tablespoon of chicken boullion with the chicken broth. It turned out very tasty. Easy to prepare recipe, and a nice side dish.
 Thank you for the recipe!

This was awesome...even leftover for lunch the next day it was amazing.   I will definitely make this again and again.   A great dish as a "catch all" from the fridge.  You can't mess this up!

I really like this dish.  I use red pepper instead of green, vegetable broth (a little extra) instead of chicken, two cloves of garlic and I add a can of black beans when I remove the lid.  Great vegetarian meal.  Next time, I will add a jalape√±o pepper.

I used pot barley. I also used unsalted chicken broth and added about 1/4 tsp of sea salt.  I also used red pepper as I dislike green. Great change from potatoes or rice!

This was very good comfort food. My only complaint is the recipe didn't say if the barley needs to be cooked going in or not?  I played it safe and cooked it first. I substituted vegetarian chicken broth.  It was good after spices were added.  I would make this again.

Loved it!  My husband also loved it, and he had thought that didn't like barley!  Will definitely make this again.  I used the mushrooms, and loved the taste.   I used olive oil instead of butter, and a red pepper instead of green, because that was what I had.  I had to leave it in for an extra 15 minutes without the cover; it was way too liquid-y.

Turned out very good.  I did not have to take off the lid and continue cooking, it was just perfect just after cooking for 30 minutes.  Used a heavy cast iron pot and lid. Will make this again.

Extremely straightforward recipe and lends itself to many add-ins: added sun-dried tomatoes this time.   Still, rather bland...will add some herbs - thyme, oregano, parsley - next time.  Also, a little homemade vineagarette  enhances the taste.
