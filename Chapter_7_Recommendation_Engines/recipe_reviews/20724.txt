There are few things that scream "SUMMER" like grilled corn on the cob.  I do mine a little differntly than this however, and it is fantastic!  First of all, DO NOT remove the husks - they are vital to the flavor and cooking process.  Only peel a little bit back to make sure you do not have a bad one.  You can tear off any long silk that is sticking out, but do not worry about the ones inside (they come off easily after they are cooked).  Put the corn in a cooler or bucket large enough to hold them all and completely cover with clean water.  Allow them to soak for at least an hour or up to several hours and keep turning them because they float.  When it comes time to cook, quickly drain the excess water out the tops and put them on a hot grill for approximately 30 minutes.  Be sure to turn them every 5 minutes or so and rotate them around the grill too.  The husks will burn and some may even catch on fire - this is normal.  Remove any husks that fall off.   The corn itself will not burn because it is being steamed from the inside due to the soaking (as long as you rotate them).  Also, do not put directly on hot coals - this will surely cause burn spots.  Once the husks are mostly all blackened, remove from grill, and husk.  Most of the silk, if not all, will come off at this time  They will stay hot for at least 30 minutes as long as the husks are left on, and be carefull not to burn your hands while husking.  Season to taste with butter, salt, pepper, or whatever you like.

The corn was excellent...sweet and juicy.  For some of you who had trouble getting your corn done quick enough,here's a hint that applies to any food that's wrapped in foil. In this case, wrap the corn-on-the-cob with the shiny side in.  This keeps the heat in and helps to cook faster. With the shiny side out, the foil is reflecting more of the heat...so longer cooking time.

We love this recipe but, but really prefer a similar method that also gives you moist, tender corn:  Soak ears of corn (in the husks) in water for at least 30 minutes.  Arrange on hot grill.  Dip an old bath towel in water, wring it out until it no longer drips.  Place over the corn.  Close grill top.  (The towel won't burn).  Let the corn cook 15-20 minutes.

Simple and delicious.  Tip: A friend of mine convinced me to NOT bother removing the silk before cooking - said "Once it's done, you just grab it from the top before husking, and it all comes out in one piece!" I was skeptical - but he was RIGHT!!

The only thing I do different, is I soak my corn in water first, then I use strips of the husk to tie the husk around the corn and grill, I omit the foil, that way the corn can get more of the flavor of the grill while cooking, and the pre soak in cold water keeps the husk from burning while cooking

I had several ears of corn so I did it both this way AND the way the other comments suggest with leaving the husks on.  I soaked all corn, husked half and wrapped in foil with butter, and the other half I just placed directly on the charcoal grill.  Aside from the mess of husking the super hot flaky husks, no one could actually taste a difference.  I would suggest to do which ever method sounds easiest to you.  

p.s. if you change the ENTIRE recipe, why rate this one? That's like me rating this one but discussing how I make fried rice...

Everyone when rating this review actually talks about a completely different method of cooking the corn, and then gives it 5 stars. I don't get it.  I'm reviewing this exact recipe. I didn't soak the corn. I didn't do anything. I peeled the husks back, put butter and salt on it, wrapped them in foil, and grilled. The corn was EXCELLENT. Seriously. Delicious. This recipe is great exactly as is.

I took off the silk of the corn and submerged the corn (with the shuck still on) in water for a couple of hours. I then pulled back the shuck just enough to brush on some melted butter with seasoned salt. I put the shuck back over the corn and covered it tightly with foil( shiny side facing in) I put it on the pit for 40 to 45 min. turning every 5 min. and it turned out very tender. Everyone loved it.

I followed the advise of the other reviews and soaked the corn in water with the husks on for an hour then grilled them for 1/2 hour, turning every 5 mins.  they turned out PERFECT.  but had nothing to do with the original recipe.

This was my favorite item at our cookout yesterday. After taking the silk off the corn (with the husks still attached) soak them in cold water for a couple hours; then you won't have to wrap them in foil but can cook them directly on the grill. YUM!

Nice smoky flavour...Yummy. Just remember to put the shiny side of the foil on the inside.

For people who haven't experienced grilled corn on the cob, you can throw corn on the grill after doing nothing. I cut the straggly silks off neatly so they don't flame up but IMHO once you open up the husk it's impossible to seal it back and you then have to treat it in some way by soaking or wrapping. Plain grilled corn on the cob is sweeter due to carmelization and concentration of the sugars. To us the whole idea of grilling the corn is to have a different flavor than boiled and we love the sweet browned flavor. Leaving the husk sealed allows the steam to form and the silks hold enough natural moisture to steam and protect the corn from burning. I've found that a lot of people think that you have to open up and treat the corn somehow or it won't turn out well, but you can do nothing and the corn will be delicious.

This was great!  I soaked the corn in water, left the silk & husks intact, and didn't add anything to the corn as suggested by others.  

**I don't know if anyone's mentioned this, but if you are going to soak the corn you can just put the ears in a bag, fill with water, expel air, and tie the bag.  That way you don't have to worry about turning the corn or trying to weigh down the floating ears.  

Everyone in my family loved this corn!

I think the absolute BEST way to make corn on the cob is to wrap the entire cob -- silk, husk, and all -- in tin foil and then place on the top rack of your barbecue for 20-30 minutes, rotating at least once. The husks and silk come off so easily this way and the corn turns out perfect EVERY SINGLE TIME -- even without butter!

I have always grilled my corn.  Unless you feel the need, there is no reason to peel the corn and add the butter.  Simply soak the corn in water for a few minutes and grill.   This is a huge time saver.   Add the butter after the corn is cooked and husked.   
I did this for a luncheon and I was shocked by the number of people who thought this was a "new" technique.   Grillen' ears as we call them are quick, easy and hard to beat.

Unnecessary work. Soak unhusked corn for at least an hour as Wharton41 said, grill 20 to 30 minutes, peel husks back, leaving them as a handle. Using a tall glass jar filled with hot water and topped with a stick of butter, dip corn - the melted butter floats and will easily butter the corn as you pull it back up. This is fast, simple, and you can add another stick of butter when needed, re-warming the jar of water on the grill if necessary. A gallon sized pickle jar is ideal. Leaving the silk on as you cook the corn, by the way, heightens the corn flavor.

This is a well known recipe for corn and it will give you great results.  But to all the people who are cautioning about the necessity of wrapping the foil shiny side in- this is an urban legend.  Per Reynolds Aluminum, "It makes little difference which side of the Reynolds Wrap aluminum foil you use--both sides do the same fine job of cooking, freezing, and storing food. There is a slight difference in the reflectivity of the two sides, but it is so slight that laboratory instruments are required to measure it."

These were great! Super simple. Next time I'll let the corn soak in sugar water to amp the sweetness of the corn. I grilled the corn without foil in the corn shucks. I would also recommend shucking the corn outside after grilling with tongs (so you don't burn your hands) and so the charred pieces don't get all over your kitchen! Another reviewer was right, the corn silk comes right off easily after grilling! Thanks for the great recipe!

I used the advice of other reviewers as this was our first time grilling corn.  We soaked it and removed the silk and left it in the husk.  It came out OK.  I think we left it on the grill too long and will have to try it again. It was a nice change from boiled corn on the cob.

I used this recipe for my cookout during the 4th of July weekend.  The only changes I made was that I slightly melted the butter and added Zatarain's Creole Seasoning, minced garlic, seasoned salt and a hint of dried parsley, brushed butter onto the ears of corn and wrapped them in aluminum foil.  Cooked them on the grill for about 30 minutes-and had some of most delicious grilled corn I'd ever prepared.  Thank you, Sue.  I'll be definately making this again.

I prefer to cook on the grill while the corn is still in the husks.   I trim all the husks with a scissor to get off excess silk and husk leaves.   I heat the grill and put a dozen or so.  turn them frequently cooking for 20 minutes.   Then I put them in a styrofoam cooler near the grill and proceed to cook the main meal(usually marinated chicken pieces)   They continue to steam in the cooler and stay warm a long time.  remove husks just before eating!

The end product was definitely worth 5 stars, but I changed the cooking method slightly, so I'm not entirely sure this is a fair review. :) The cook time listed in the recipe was PERFECT.  We don't have a gas grill, and were using a charcoal alternative flame disk, but 30 minutes was just right for 2 ears of corn. I followed other reviewers' suggestions and just cooked the corn as-is.  I didn't remove the silk first.  I did not follow others' suggestions to soak the corn in water first, though.  It didn't need it.  After 30 minutes, the corn was tender--perfect, in fact!  The husks and silk peeled off very easily.  I then brushed the corn all over with melted butter, and sprinkled pepper on them.  I love corn on the cob, and this was the best I've had! My husband said it wasn't bad--high praise indeed from someone who dislikes corn on the cob! This will be the only way I cook corn on the cob from now on.

i always make corn like this during the summer. the options are so endless. somedays i'll add garlic and oregano to the buttered ears.. other days i'll add some cajun seasoning. its really good to also remove the corn after its done, putting it in a bowl and adding a tad more butter. the kids love it either way! i'd say we eat it a couple times at least!

My family and I love grilled corn in the summer. We however do it a little differently. After soaking the corn and removing the silk, we peel the husks down but do not detatch them from the ear. Then we slather each ear of corn with butter, sea salt, and fresh squeezedliene juice from 1/2 lime. Then the husks are pulled back over the corn & grilled directly on the grill. When they are done, just peel back the husks and hold the stalk to eat. Delicious!

Stopped on Saturday afternoon & bought some freshly picked corn.  I let it soak overnight in just alittle bit of water & ice, left in our cooler.  It was unreal how easy it was to remove the silk off the cob the following afternoon.  I smeared aprox. 1/2 Tbl. butter to each ear and alttle salt and pepper, before grilling and didn't need to add anything after but a bit more salt. I grilled each for the full 1/2 hour, turning twice.  I can't remember having such wonderful corn in years!!

The very first review is right on the button on this one. In fact the silk comes off easier after it is cooked. We use the husk as a handle for eating. Nothing better than charcoaled corn on the cob with butter and a bit of salt. Yum yum.

I couldn't really tell the difference between this and corn cooked on the stove.  Next time I grill corn, I won't wrap it up so much that the taste of the BBQ can flavor the corn.

Mom specifically wanted me to get online and rate this as excellent! Not sure why we never thought of it before-such a simple concept. But the corn turned out awesome! And I love the way it comes loose from the cob so easily when you bite-like it's just waiting to pop in your mouth! Must be a grill thing... :)

We love grilling corn.  Instead of the foil, after cleaning the ears of the silk I wrap the husks back up around the ear and tie them off with some thread.  Then I soak the ears in water for 30 minutes, this prevents the husks from burning and place them right on the grill.  I don't use the foil ( or the butter at this time).

I was taught by my Grandaddy when they still had 
Ice Boxes!  He'd put his fresh picked corn in the ice box for a couple of hours, start a fire in the fire pit, 
and throw enough ears of corn on for everyone.  
He never soaked them in water nor peel the husk 
and remove the silk (part of the corn, he'd say, adds to the flavor) but keep rolling them around 
on the grill every five minutes or so... yes, some 
of the outer husks will burn.  Keep turning and 
cooking for 30 to 45 minutes.  Take them off the 
grill, let sit for about 5 minutes, then wrap them in 
a dishtowel and snap off the stalk part first and 
de-husk.  The silk and husk just dropped off!  
Butter and salt to taste and mmm-mmm good!

I followed the directions exactly as written, making sure to turn the shiny side of the foil in towards the corn. This was delicious!! It only took 30 minutes on the grill, and it was so sweet and tender. I definitely recommend this recipe, just as it's written!

Very good stuff! I did not grill the corn in the husks. I shucked each ear, sprinkled them with garlic salt, and put each ear into a foil packet with some water. They were nice and tender after 30-40 minutes.

BBQ corn on the cob is a great American staple. In my experience, the corn comes out better if you do not pull back the husks or wrap it in foil. Soak for an hour with the husks intact. Butter will drip and burn inside foil and leave a slight metal taste. If you pull back the husks and butter, the butter will drip onto the coals and some of the bad smelling smoke will flavor your corn.

After living in Greece and seeing first hand a lot of street vendors cooking corn on small grills, I use this method: 

Heat the grill to 300º F.

Peel back husks and scrub off silk with a brush in the sink. 

Coat each ear with olive oil or butter, (spread the butter cold or warm it up and brush it on) I prefer olive oil. 

Fresh ground pepper to taste. I don't add salt.  

Fold the husks back to form a handle. Some people use rubber bands to hold the husks together, I've seen street vendors do a decorative weave to the husk. Bread ties or vegetable bands work too. 

Use these  "husk Handles" to move the corn around and rotate them every 5 to 7 minutes. Some ears cook faster because it has thinner cob and or corn. 

Place the ears on the grill so the husks hang over and outside the grill edge and towards you. Close the grill over the corn while it cooks. Husks stay cool and green.

I usually like my corn browned good, with the grill marks. Takes around 30 minutes at 300º. Every grill is different. Get a dial type oven thermometer if your grill isn't already equipped. If you're handy you can buy a grill thermometer at home improvement stores and drill a hole for it. Helps a lot and it allows me to cook a lot of things on the grill with more confidence in the outcome.

Cut off the husk ends and serve, or trim the husks down to a few good strong pieces with shears, add a corn holder to the other end and serve.

you definitely want to peel back the husks beforehand, unless you're the kind of person who would enjoy finding a corn borer on your food after grilling.

An awful lot of work for absolutely zero effect on the flavor of the corn, even though I followed the recipe precisely after soaking the ears. I won't make this again.

You don't need to soad the corn before cooking with the husks on.  I never do.  I put the cobs on the grill as is and they come out fresh and tasty!

Best way to prepare corn..EVER. I make corn on the cob quite often (at least once/wk) in the summer here in Buffalo, NY. Our local corn is the best & this is the easiest & tastiest way to prepare it. It was delicious. Better than boiling or microwaving. This will be my go-to method from now on. Thank you.

We have tried this several times with the husks on, but found it hard to get the silk out without soaking the corn which can lead to the corn popping, oddly enough.  Now we shuck the corn, baste it with homemade garlic infused olive oil we make ourselves and a bit of mashed roasted garlic, fresh ground/cracked pepper, sea salt flakes(our personal kinds are red, pink and black salts), and pop them on the grill at medium heat until they start to caramelize and the corn lets off this amazing aroma.  we also use the garlic infused olive oil(we make a few batches every 2-3 months since it gets used in salads, chicken with fresh lemon and/or lime juice(the best chicken ever with a bit of brown sugar for browning), and on the ourside of sweet potatoes pricked and wrapped in foil and baked on the grill.  The oil also makes a great dressing for a corn, black bean, tomato, and any other veggie you might have around in the fridge with a good grain like a wheat berry or lentils for those that are gluten free.  We usually do a dozen ears, and what does not get eaten either gets frozen or made into a salad for dinner the next day or thrown into corn bread.  it makes the BEST cornbread ever!

Tip: When soaking your corn, add one cup of milk to your water. (one cup milk per gallon water) This will seriously enhance the sweetness of your corn. There's no need for tin foil if you've properly soaked / drenched your corn for at least one hour and can turn your corn every five minutes with husks on.

Another tip: If your lazy or just too hungry to wait and don't care to boil or grill your corn on the cob, try this. Husk off, wrap your corn in two (one will work, two is better) whole milk soaked paper towels (fully wrapped) and microwave for four minutes. Its just as delicious AND OH SO SWEET!

This is a great recipe but I made a few changes that turned out well.
I didn't peal the husks back all the way. I just pulled out the silk.
I soaked the corn for 30 min in a bath of water and added 1/2 cup of sea salt. It made it a bit sweet and salty at the same time. 
There is no need to wrap the corn in foil with this method. Put it right on the grill turning every few minutes depending on the heat of your grill. We have a cheap grill so we turned often so the corn did not burn. 
I grilled for about 30 mins and the corn was perfect but again, my grill cooks differently. 
My recommendation: add sea salt to the water bath.

Easiest recipe! And a time and energy saver too! Before when we'd BBQ, one of us would be inside boiling the corn but with this recipe, you can do the corn at the same time you're doing your steaks and burgers.
The corn came out beautifully - I've experimented with different kinds of butter for an extra kick, herbed butter, garlic butter, horseradish butter, wasabi butter, it comes out perfect everytime.

my entire family loves this recipe.  i remove the husk along with the silk and wrap each ear of corn in heavy foil, after adding the butter and salt and pepper.  once the foil begins to char, i turn it.  comes out perfect every time!

Mixed pepper and garlic salt with the butter and spread over corn before wrapping back up. Could have been a bit more done in the time we gave it which was more than stated. But could have been our fire and position on it too. Will do this way again.

My boyfriend made corn this way, and it was better than mine (I usually soak in water and grill in husk without foil.)  I feel like this was juicier and more tender.  I was looking for "his" method and found this - thanks!  A note to other reviewers about the foil:  It DOES NOT MATTER if you have the shiny or dull side in.  This is an old myth.  Reynolds states this on their website. Neither side reflects or holds in heat better.  The only time the side matters is if you are using the non-stick foil.

You would think that we invented grilling corn the way our guests ranted and raved about the corn on the cob that we cooked this way.  We served it at 3 different dinner parties this summer, all to outstanding reviews.

I've always boiled my corn, but I've heard that grilled corn is so much better, and boy was it ever!  I followed the recipe exactly as given, although after pulling the husks down I did give the corn a quick rinse under the tap.  The corn turned out sweet, tender and moist with loads of flavour.  Never going to be boiling my corn again.  To those soaking their corn in water, it's not necessary, just do as the recipe says and wrap the cobs in foil, no burning or charring.

Seems everyone has a slightly different way of cooking corn.  I do as well.  I soak my corn in water for 1-2 hours, place the husk right on the BBQ over medium heat - high.  Rotate 1/4 turn every 5 minutes.  After 20 minutes the corn is done.  You can continue to leave on the BBQ rotating every 5 minutes for another 1/2 hour or pull from the BBQ and leave in the husk until you wish to eat.  The corn steams in the husk, hard to over cook and the husk will keep the corn hot for an hour or so.  A bit of a mess to husk after, but the corn comes out perfect every time.

As written, wrapping the corn in foil with butter and cooking for approx. 30 min. will eventually cook the corn & cooking it this way is sort of a novelty.  However, we had a large batch of sweet corn, some of which we grilled following this recipe and the rest that didn't fit on the grill, we boiled for 3-5 min. in the traditional way.  We found that the same sweet corn cooked quickly in boiling water was much sweeter & had more flavor.  So I would only recommend cooking corn on the grill if you have plain old corn...don't grill it this way if you want to preserve the flavor of sweet corn.

This worked fine for last minute corn on the grill.  i do prefer to soak first, but didnt' have time and it was fine.  I grilled first with just husks and then covered with foil the next 20 mins after husks started burning.  Mostly on this recipe to get grill time.  Thanks for submitting.

My entire family loves corn prepared this way! The sweet corn with a little salt, pepper and butter is so good. The texture is perfect when grilled. We will enjoy this as often as possible while summer sweet corn is available. Thanks for sharing!

Loved this!! Don't be shy when prepping the corn! Liberally add the butter, salt, and pepper because alot of it was absorbed into the corn husks.

Made this two different ways:  the way it was written, and the other time made it using others' tips, such as leaving on the husks, no butter, even no foil.  The result: no comparison- make it the way it is written!  It is outstanding, and I can't wait to make it again and again.

This is a good way to do corn if you can't soak the husks in water. This works really well, perfect timing and everything. I cut the butter down to like half of that.

My family has been cooking corn on the cob this way for years.  The only variation, is that we soak our corn (husks on) in water for a few hours first.  Then wrap them in foil and grill.  Perfect every time!

Simple??? pointless. you want to grill corn??? the seasoning is fine, perhaps a little praprika or cumin, but just grill it over a medium heat, no husk, no foil, naked. My secret is rubbing the butter in well so it wont get too dry.

I used creole seasoning instead of salt & added minced, roasted garlic. Topped it w/ some grated parmesan cheese after I plated it. It was really good now...can't wait to have it again when fresh corn is real sweet. Thansk for the recipe!

I don't know why there are so many negative responses due to the removal of the husks, since the recipe does not call for that. It is delicious and a great recipe on the grill and you can adjust the seasonings to your taste. Thanks.

I make this corn everytime we grill out. My family can't get enough of it. I use frozen extra sweet corn on the cob and add minced garlic before wrapping it. It is the absolute best!

I cooked these in the foil, but I wanted the caramelized color on my kernels, so I gave them a quick sear as the rest of my food was finishing. Such an simple, delicious way to enjoy summer corn. I can't wait for my garden to yield some a crop just for me!

It seemed like a lot more work then the usual ole' boiling method.  The taste was there, but I don't think it surpassed boiled, buttered, and salted corn on the cob.  I do love corn no matter which way you cook it!

Great way to prepare corn and utilize a hot grill.  I made the recipe exactly as written and it was delicious.  We grilled burgers and put the corn on at the same time.  Both were finished cooking in 30 minutes.  We will be using this recipe a few more times during the corn season.  Thanks Sueteitsma for sharing your recipe.

I have to say my recipe for grilled corn is even easier than this one.  It isn't necessary to remove the silk prior to grilling.  leave the silk and husk on a grill.  The moisture in the sillk and husk steams the corn to perfection and you just peel it all off together when it's done grilling.  I think it actually comes off easier with the husks than it does separately.

Only downside is that you don't get much caramelization on the kernels (my husband's favorite part).

I tried this recipe, followed the instructions and the corn turned out great!!!! It tastes just like the roasted corn at the Ohio State Fair. My family loved the roasted corn flavor!!! I don't think you need to change a thing about it. It will be difficult for me to go back to boiling/blanching the corn from now on.

This was very good. I used a Morton brand seasoning blend, Nature's Seasons, instead of salt & pepper.  I have never grilled corn before, and now I will never make it any other way! I plan to check out some other grilled corn recipes, but I would do this one again.  Thank you!

I give this only 4 stars because i took into consideration other peoples reviews on soaking the corn, i soaked the ears about 30 mins, then placed them on the grill inside their husks(cleaned of silk) dry without any butter or anything, for 30 mins, and they turned out tremendous, tender,perfectly done, and added the butter and salt and pepper after to taste. Is definitely easier then boiling and microwaving doesn't comeout nearly this good..thanks for the recipe,..will be using all summer.

I also tink this ,iis great but I learned a trick from a chef at a tailgaiting party in White Sox Park.  Leave the husks alone and soak but...in sugar water overnight. Drain and then grill for 30 min. It was incredible, when you add some salt and butter it is awesome! Try It.

We really enjoyed this grilled corn recipe.  However, I did remove the husks and silk, double wrapped the ears in foil, and grilled on indirect heat.

The husks do add a lot of flavor that you just can't get from aluminum foil.  I have a tip if you don't have time for soaking.  Slip in some crushed ice under the husks.

These tasted fine but were such a pain to make! I would prefer to grill them  with their husks on as they are much easier to remove after they are cooked.

OK but looses the buttery taste. I think too much butter gets soaked into husks.  A better way to do it is to leave corn as is (do not remove silk), soak for 1 hour in water, then cook on grill  -- no tinfoil -- for 20 minutes and turn every 5 minutes.  That way you can add butter and seasoning to your likes.

I have cooked corn this way for many years.  I make an adjustment by using EVO instead of butter due to a lactose intolerant husband. It is equally delicious using EVO. I think I will try coconut oil this year. The sweet and salty mix with the corn should be delicious. We cook our stovetop popcorn in coconut oil so I think it will work great.

Growing up, we always soaked the corn in saltwater overnight the threw it on the charcoal grill. Husks never burned, and you didnt have to add iodized salt to them. Steam cooked the corn quicker, and all you needed was butter.

Soaking the corn in water is better.It keeps it from burning before it finishes cooking.
  Heres a tip for when you can't grill.Or you want to do only a few corn on the cob.Soak the corn for an hour or longer.I use a pitcher so they can stand up and be in water constantly.Do not remove husk.Cut top of corn just to remove exposed hair and bottom nub.Place in microwave for 16 to 20 min.depending on how many you have.When you take them out run under cold water just long enough to peel without burning yourself.Corn will be nicely steamed when peeled.I do this for my husband and myself when we are only doing 2 corn on the cob.

Don't bother cooking for 30 mins. Cook too long will make your corn tough. Great idea though to butter then rewrap!!

I have tried this method several times and like it. However I prefer to remove all of the silk and husk, coat the corn with olive oil and a good grilling rub and grill "naked". The corn is much sweeter and has, I think, better flavor. My dad used to call this "Indian Corn".

I soak the corn with the husks on for at least 2 hours. I then grill as is for 35 to 45 minutes. Then husk and then allow eater to butter and season. Many of us have different tastes that is why I don't butter or season for them.

Good basic recipe. The only thing I do differently is to soak the corn in water for about 1/2 hour before all of the other stuff. I think it makes the corn more tender as it is being steamed in it's own husk. Try it you'll like it.

Yes I have to agree with another review. You must soak the corn, and the silk comes off with the husk.  Removing silk prior is unneccessary.

Delicious simple recipe...  You don't *have* to remove the silk first if you're lazy like me.  And according to Reynold's Wrap, it doesn't make any difference if the shiny side is in or out.

This recipe is better if the corn in the husk is allowed to soak in brine first. A mixture of water with equal parts of salt and sugar added and mixed in until both dissolve, then add the corn and leave overnight. remove, drain, and grill.

I never husk, nor remove any silks. Just fill the sink with cold water - add corn & weight down with a plate. By the time everything else is prepped for the grill, the corn is ready as well. After about 25 min., turning whenever I think of it - I remove from grill and yank on any silks that didn't burn away. I agree they will stay nice and hot for a good 30 min. - and when I turn down the husks, I leave them on for our 'handle.' Kids especially seem to think that's cool. (Just knock off any blackened husks, and it's relatively mess free!) I have melted butter w/brush, S & P, and cayanne or any other seasoning desired, with other condiments I need for remainder of meal. Beats boiled corn hands down!!

When we left the husks on, the corn tasted like wet mush. I tried it a second time but removed the husks and unded up with delicious corn on the cob. This also works in the oven at 250 F for about 20-30 min. Just place a pan under the corn to catch the dripping butter.

My 68 year old mother said this was the best corn she's ever had.  My husband loved it as well. Very easy, I followed all directions except cooked it a little longer  because my charcoal grill is not very consistent.  Thanks.

This recipe was great!  I spread the softened butter all over the corn, seasoned it with salt and pepper and then wrapped it back up with the husks and then the foil.  We grilled the corn for about 50 minutes because we wanted to make sure it would be cooked all the way and not raw.  It was very tender and juicy.

This is grate for a nice smoke flavored ear. When you want grate corn on the grill without the smoked taste try the same simple steps just remove the husk before raping in foil.

I've been doing corn on the cob this way for a long time. Only thing I do differently is that after I wrap the corn cob with the husks and then wrap with foil, I place my corn directly onto the coals of my grill and start cooking them about 10 minutes before I place the meats on to cook. I do the same w/ baked potatoes. Just make sure when you turn the meat, you also turn the corn or potatoes on the coals. A Weber grate that has hinges is best for this. You can also heat the corn at about 60% for 2 minutes in the microwave, then butter and season, replace husks, wrap in foil then cook on the grate for that grilled taste.

Simple and delicious. I didn't bother removing the silk prior to grilling, as once it's cooked the silk slides right off. I usually soak my corn for several hours and throw it directly on the grill, but the aluminum foil makes this perfect for a last-minute addition to the meal.  Thanks! :)

This was a good recipe.  However, I do just a couple things different.  I remove the husks before I wrap in foil.  I also add a couple sprinkles of Old Bay to each ear with the butter (instead of salt).  I am from Maryland and we find most things taste better with Old Bay!

Mmmm, I thought about soaking them in water or using a towel, but I cooked them just as the recipe says.  Very juicy and tender! I'll definitely grill corn more often, it was very easy!

Very good corn.  If you buy corn that is already shucked, wrap in foil after spreading butter and seasoning.  I like to put green or red chili powder or seasoning salt on my corn to give it a little kick.  Thumbs up!

My husband has made this a tradition.  The only changes I have made is I rub the ear of corn with the butter and then use season salt instead of just plain salt and pepper.  It is fantastic.

Our corn turned out very well. Some were a bit charred in spots, but was still very good. I attribute this too not turning as often as I probably shoud have, but the corn cooked in the 30 minutes on a gas grill almost all the way on 'high.'

I always soak my corn in water first before removing the silk, so I tried this to save a little time, turned out a bit dry, so will always soak the corn in water for about 1 hour first and bast with melted garlic butter before serving.

I don't remove the husks until it is completely cooked.  Prior to placing on grill I trim with scissors,  the loose husk and cut the silk end flush, then totally submerge the complete ears in water for about an hour or more.  Rotating on the grill until outer husk is burnt black, which is when the internal corn is perfectly cooked.  Use oven mitts to peel off very hot husks and remaining silk. Now is time to add butter and salt, mmm.

this is the basic version. if you soak the corn for 10 min or so you do not have to wrap it. some of the husk will burn. make" buffalo" style by removing the grilled corn from the cob with a large knife (when it's slightly cooled) and add some franks hot sauce and parmesan.

I was told by a fellow coworker about this recipe and it is great!  I like it much better than boiling and it has a lot more flavor.  It is so easy to make.  Try it, you'll like it!!

Thank You!! Read many reviews and it is your recipe that I needed to keep it easy, I also learned that you can stab it with a fork and if it slides off easy it is done. It's about time I can bbq corn

I followed the advice of another reviewer and soaked the corn in water for a couple of hours prior to cooking - the end result was absolutely delicious! I didn't butter or salt the corn prior to cooking - but I think I will next time!

I followed this recipe EXACTLY and it didn't out so great. It smelled like burnt popcorn. It had a few burn spots in it. I don't think it was a good idea to put the butter and salt on before cooking. I will be trying a different way to grill corn next time. I've had amazing grilled corn before, but they apparently do it different. I gave it 3 stars because it was still edible.

WOW!  We have never tried grilling corn, but just followed the hints of soaking the corn in water ahead of time and people REALLY liked the results.  (We didn't add the butter or seasonings until we were at the table.)  We will definitely fix this again!

More likely it is unfair for me to rate this.  However, because it inspired me to try grilled corn I am going to. Being my first try on the grill I read a ton of the reviews posted and based on the variety of suggestions it turned out great!  I removed the corn silk, rinsed well, but left the husk on.  I then soaked the corn in warm water for about 2 hours.  Then, grilled them for 45 minutes.  When done I took off the husk and added butter and salt.  What a great taste!  I am looking forward to grilled corn every summer now.  The recipe as is though with the foil just sounds like steamed corn.  Either way with the suggestions it was great!  Note: Keep an eye on the corn.  Even with the water soaking to keep the husks from catching on fire, the husks can possibly still catch fire.  When the grill flames up move them out of the direct fire area. The water soaking definitely helps though.

The review on May 05, 2005 by WHARTON31 pretty much explains it all. One thing I do differently sometimes is soak the corn in warm to hot water with a 1/2 to 1 cup of sugar mixed in with the water. This obviously creates a nice sweet water for the corn to cook in once it hits the grill!

Maybe it was the type of corn we used, but it just tasted blah.  No grilled flavor, more like steamed corn.  The frozen sweet corn I buy at the supermarket is better than this.

Yummy and very easy.  I did leave off the butter and salt & peper.  Served those at the table.  Corn was done in about 45 min (gass grill) and stayed nice and tender.  Great recipe.  Thanks.

This is a great recipe and works perfectly for my family and I. They all love it. To make things easier, for the butter part, I use "I Can't Believe It Isn't Butter" spray, makes the application easier and better coverage of the entire ear of corn. I always peel the husk down to the bottom to make sure the entire ear can be covered with butter, and then wrap it tightly in the foil. If wrapped correctly, nothing burns and the husk will stay in place. I also leave the salt and pepper off until the end for people who may want more/less than I make it with.

I've been doing something similar to this for years, but with a bit of a different approach. I freeze the corn (with the husks still intact) all night. The next day, I soak them in water for about 30 minutes. Then I pull back the husks to peel all of the silk off. Freezing the corn makes it really easy to do this. I lightly butter the cobs and replace the husks the way they were. Then I broil them on the BBQ for 30 minutes, turning the cobs often so that they don't burn. Delicious!

My corn was already husked when I bought it so I placed it right on the greased (with PAM spray) grill and in 15 minutes it was done. Turn frequently and keep the heat on the lower side so it does not burn. The corn had char marks which was yummy and still juicy even without the foil or husk.

This is the best way to grill corn. Soak in cold water for a couple of hrs. but don't husk the corn. Leave everything in-tacked. Place on high heated oiled grill for approx. 40 min. All the silk & husks will come off easy. Save the butter, salt & pepper till your ready to eat. Was very moist, tender & loads of flavor. Yummy!!

I made these for a cookout a few days ago and they were a big hit!  I did peel the corn before cooking, because I hate having to do it on my dinner plate, and I thought it was just fine.  I put a couple pads of butter on each ear, sprinkled with salt, pepper, and a little garlic powder, wrapped in alum. foil and grilled on the charcoal grill (covered) for about 30mins.  These turned out fantastic and everyone loved them!  This will definitely be a cookout corn on the cob keeper!!

I followed some of the reviewers recommendations: kept the husk on, soaked in water for an hour, and grilled according to recipe.  When cooked I peeled off husk and silk, buttered each ear and sprinkled salt and pepper. It came out great. My family and guests loved it.

Very good!  I removed the silk, soaked the corn in water for about an hour. Butter and seasoned, pulled the husk back over the corn then wrapped in foil.  Cooked for 30 minutes.  Very tender and moist!  Great summer grilling!

Made this last night and the corn was really tender and delicious, however...I too took a different approach and soaked the corn in water, husks on, for an hour and then threw them on the grill for 30 min.  I was amazed how easily the silk came off with the husk!!!

We just finished eating grilled corn on the cob, I swear I could have just eaten corn for dinner it was sooooo good. We did not remove the husk or silk before grilling,just the brown silk tops that stick out of the top, we removed those. We simply soaked the ears for around 30 minutes, weighing them down so that they were completely under water for the entire time, placed them on a hot gas grill about med heat 350 degrees turned them at about 15 minutes through. We got one of those fancy corn grill baskets, but it only hold 4 ears and there are five of us, so one just got tossed on the grill by itself. Worked just fine with out the basket(wish I had known this, would have save ten bucks!)The husk does burn, but the corn doesn't(always been afraid to try it on the grill for this reason)and it was incredibly easy to take the silk off after the cobs were done. We peeled the husk down, took the silk off, DID NOT CUT THE STEM OR THE HUSK OFF(used as a handle for the corn, worked great!)rubbed a little butter....ok, a LOT of butter and a bit of salt....Mmm, Mmmm, Mmmm DELICIOUS!!!

I love corn on the grill... I like to go about 45 minutes instead of 30, but that's on a charcoal grill.  If you soak the ears of corn in water for about 30 minutes first, you can get away with a shorter cooking time.

This is actually an old recipe. If you want to make it easier, just remove the husk too. It really taste great though by being wrapped up in butter, salt & pepper and then grilled. It's one of my favorites of all time.

I was not a fan.  We usually just run water over the corn so water collects in the husk, wrap it in foil and grill it.  We add the salt pepper and butter afterwards.
Doing it the way it says in the recipe just made the husks soggy (Which we usually hold onto to eat the corn) and we had to add extra butter, salt and pepper anyways.

Tried this last night.  Husband thought it was outragously great, but I hardly noticed a difference between the regular way i do it which is the same except not buttering it before grilling it.  I still had to add a bit of butter to sweeten mine up, maybe it was the corn itself not being sweet enough. I'll try it again with another batch of corn cause it's so easy to do so why not!

Wow! I have had so much difficulty with grilled corn in the past (yes, I followed other recipes).  This was perfect!  I didn't change anything, and my husband, who doesn't really care for corn on the cob, loved it.  He said next time we're going to try some "Old Bay Seasoning".  Can't wait!

aMMMMazing!  This is the best corn on the cob I have ever had!  My boyfriend even loved it!  I also seasoned the corn with just a bit of garlic powder before wrapping in the foil.  I will definately be using this recipe over and over again.

I added garlic salt in place of table salt. I left the husks on and wrapped it in foil, shiny side in, tossed in the grill basket in the grill lid for about 30 min. I found the butter cooked away and the corn was a bit dry. Next time I will either add more butter when I season it, or put more on right before I eat it, because it still had great flavor.

Delicious!  This was my first attempt at grilled corn, and it came out perfect.  I put slightly less than the 1 tablespoon of butter/ear to keep it healthier, and it came out great.

Unfortunately, the corns burned.  I was glad I buttered 2 corns and left the other two without the butter.  I think it was that they were slightly overcooked but still the ones without the butter still came out yummy.  I will still make this again w/o butter of course.

This was ok, but the instructions were a pain. I prefer the soak in water, grill in the husks method. Also, there is just something so cool looking about corn in husks coming off the grill, so much more appetizing than aluminum foil.

Very good.  After pulling back the husk and removing the silk I 'iced' the cobb with a mixture of softened butter, fresh cracked pepper, and kosher salt.  I then re-wrapped the corn, cut away any remaining stalk, wrapped it tightly in heavy duty foil, shiny side in, and threw it on the grill for 35 to 40 minutes (medium high heat for the first 20 minutes, then medium to low for the remainder.)  Corn was sweet, flavorful, buttery, and great.

We've been grilling our corn like this for 10 years now and it's the BEST! We don't wrap ours in foil like the recipe states, though. For a kick, add some fresh pressed garlic to the melted butter and brush on corn before grilling.

I was not overly impressed with this recipe, though my family claimed to like it.  It seemed like and awful lot of hassle, but it didn't have much taste.  I much prefer the old way of doing them, in boiling water.

I served this corn for a Texas BBQ dinner party and it was delicious.  I prepared just as directed, although I dipped the ears under water prior to shaking the salt and pepper. This seemed to help it "stick" better.  Also, I used course ground black pepper.  Very tasty.  I plan to experiment with different butter mixtures to match the corn to my grilled dishes.

Very easy and tasty. Read many reviews here  and decided to experiment. Made 2 ears this way except forgot to wrap in foil  and 2 ears  doing nothing - didn't  pull husks or soak like many said. All tasted great! My take away is this, save yourself tons of time and just put the ears of corn on the grill without any soaking or foil.  It is more if a preference as far as buttering before or after they are cooked. Flavor wise, they tasted the same.

Skip the salt most butter & margarine already have salt in them!  Skip the foil put the corn Husk & all right on the grill wait for the outer husk to turn a light to dark brown the corn is done. Remove the husk Put the butter on the corn or let everyone do their own.

It just doesn't make any sense to cook it on the grill if your just gonna wrap it in foil!cook it in the oven then. I usually cook corn on the grill to impart the  flavor of the gill, even use a little apple wood to make the grilling flavor stand out that much more.

I do almost all of this when i prepare/cook corn on the grill. The only thing i do extra is put a cup of sugar in the cold water, this gives it a nice sweet (sweeter) taste then not doing it. Nothing better then corn on the cob roasted on the grill!!

I love corn, but this is the first time I ever left the husk & silks on and I thought the corn tasted bitter.   When I grill corn, I have always used foil, but always clean husks & silks.

I soak corn in sugar water leaving the silk and husks on. Drain water and place on grill until tender. Butter salt pepper after shucked. It's a New England thing.  :-)

My family loved this. I did use fresh minced garlic. I mixed garlic and butter, and let it sit for an hour to blended flavor.

I cooked exactly to recipe - Delicious!  My 13 year old said it was the best corn ever and is now her fave food - she ate 2+ and would have eaten more but I only made 5!

This was ok.  Everyone seemed to like them even my nieces and nephews.  Made a perfect contribution to our 4th of July dinner.  I actually baked mine the night before...had to work early that day, so no times to grill. Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious!  My daughter called it "the best corn ever."  I didn't keep the husks on, but wrapped it in foil.  25 minutes was enough for us, just make sure you turn it several times.

Very good flavor-expecially on a hot carcoal grill.  The only change I would make is to double the cooking time. But then again, I do like my corn a bit more tender. Thanks!

This was easy enough. The corn had a different (but good) taste to it from boiling on the stove. We did have trouble getting the husks off afterward. I am going to try the other version with no husks and see if that works better. Overall, the corn tasted good.

Well, we tried but this didn't turn out for us at all. My husband had this on the grill for well over thirty minutes and the corn was still not done. We have a charcoal grill so maybe there was not enough wind or too much wind, I don't know as my husband runs the grill and won't let me near it. We'll have to try again some other time. I used fresh corn.

Great! I husked the corn at the store when I bought it (since it's such a messy process) but I spread each ear with a butter-spread and salted each one, and then wrapped in foil and grilled. YUM! We all agreed it's the best we've had corn ever!

This was pretty good, however I'm afraid 30min was a little too long to keep them on--i felt it was just a little overcooked. Also, next time I think I'll try just soaking the corn and cooking and then season w/ butter and salt when ready to eat...less messy this way.

I tried this over the weekend.  It was great!  I won't make corn on the cob any other way now.  I buttered the corn using some plastic wrap.  Then a little pepper and a little salt.

This recipe is EASY and FANTASTIC! The only issue my husband and I ran into was the cook time. The first time we used this recipe the 30 minutes wasn't long enough. The second night we left the corn on for 40 minutes and turned every 5-10 minutes. Turned out perfectly! We'll try and foil shiny side in next time. We usually soak our corn in sugar water before we boil it, brings out the flavor, will probably do this next time as well!

I made this as is and it was perfectly fine. I've also made it with a cube of ice wrapped in each ear and that did help with the moisture.

Preparing corn this way was absolutely delicious! Even though I added butter and salt to the corn before grilling, it still needed more while eating. It was so good that I cooked the remaining corn cobs to be frozen for winter enjoyment.

We've made corn on the grill three times this summer, and improvised on this recipe just a bit - instead of butter, we sprayed non-stick butter all over each cob, salted, closed the husks (removed silks of course), and grilled for 30-40 minutes. YUM. Soooo good, everyone gobbled them up - including our four year old, she loves it. Will continue to make corn this way every summer - thanks for the inspiration!

This is a great idea but you can get the same result by soaking the corn(in the husk)at least 20 minutes. Remove as much of the silk as you can without opening the husk. you can place it right on the grill and the corn is usually done by the time your meat is...test by squeezing it with your fingers, it will give and feel soft inside...the husks and silk will pull away easily to serve, just add butter and salt as desired. I love this corn without adding any thing to it!

My favourite corn recipe. :) As per Wharton31's review, I leave on the silk and husks and soak the ears in water for 2+ hours. I don't bother with salt, pepper, or butter until after they're cooked... And they take around 25 minutes on a George Forman outdoor grill. A very good way to get the true flavour (and nutrients!) of corn. Thanks for sharing, Sueteitsma!

Wow!  I've never griled corn before and this was great.  I accidentally left it on the grill an extra 15 min.  It was perfect!

I am surprised the recipe didn't call for soaking the corn for at least an hour...and I like to use garlic salt and butter before bbqing...the best way to cook corn!

I loved this recipe but my husband thought it was bland.  Next time I think I will try a spicy pepper blend or an herbed butter.  Also might work to place a sprig of rosemary inside the foil.  I does need a little jazzing up.

I love this recipe.  You can put different seasoning spices besides salt/pepper and mix it up a little each time you make it.  Yum!

I've been trying a lot of recipes for corn on the cob lately, so my husband begged me make them 'normal'.  Perhaps we found two ears of the best corn ever made, but I think a lot of it had to do with going back to the basics -- butter, salt and pepper.

It's simple and it's great. It's perfect to serve to the unadventurous type who doesn't want to experiment much with spices.

This is a healthy way to make corn. The advantage of cooking corn this way is that the vitamins and minerals stay in the corn, not just go away as with cooking in water. Cooked  for 30 minutes, corn was not totally juicy, but next time I will try soaking it in water first so it keeps some juiciness inside. It has a nice smoky flavor too, as if it was cooked on the wild campfire.

I don't think I'll ever boil corn on the cob again, these were so fabulous. It was a pain to get all the silk out, but the husk is definitely key to getting the corn steamed properly. Thanks for a great recipe Sue.

Sooooooo goood!!!! In fact it was so good when my 2 year old spilled his plate I still ate it!!! Hey in my defense I hadn't eaten all day and the floor WAS clean : ) . We took the husks off and cut in half then wrapped in foil. We left them on the full 30 minutes still and it was a little too long - next time we'll either leave the husks on like suggested or grill them for a little less. We also added a couple cloves crushed garlic to the butter - yum!!

Love it, but I just washe the ears without really removing the husks or silk and through them on the grill wet, turning them every few minouts, husks get black but it only took about 20 minouts for mine to steam. I did not wrap them in foil though, maybee they just cooked faster that way. Can't see any other way to cook corn on the cob than on the grill!!!! (great for camping)

I tried one ear before making this for company and am I glad I did.  It was a hassle to clean the corn and it ended up dry and tasteless.  The worst part was that the husks were all charred and the blackened husks got all over the cooked corn and, because it was a breezy day, half of Massachusetts.

Mine were still really hard after 30 minutes.  Could have been cooked a little longer but it was hard to tell if it was done or not because of being wrapped in foil and the husks.

Ok, I took the super lazy method. First, I did not soak the corn in water first. Second, I did not peal back the husks or remove the silk. Here is my only big change: I took some heavy duty kitchen scissors and cut the stalk end to just about the cob. This released the largest husk pieces to discard. Then I threw them on a 300 degree grill for about 25 or 30 minutes (turning every 5 minutes or so). Man, it turned out amazing! Just added a little butter, salt and pepper and had the best corn on the cob ever! I only gave 4 stars to the original recipe. This change would make it a 5.

I went ahead and tried it as was this recipe.  I did remove the silk (no soaking in water), and wrapped in foil (I did follow one reviewers recommendation of doing the foil with the dull side facing out).  It turned out really well!  I will try this method again.

Overall Great:  2 suggestions - (1) Separate the husks from the corn at the bottom, since the corn is hard to separate after grilling due to heat. (2) Break the cob in 1/2 prior to grilling - same reason - corn is very hot when coming off the grill.  More pieces

The corn was tender and came out right, however it ended up tasting a but too much like the husk. Despite putting butter, salt and pepper on prior to cooking, it needed more butter, salt and pepper afterwards.

I was excited to try this after reading so many positive reviews. This was the worst. Incredibly time-consuming and corn came out overcooked. Will stick with the much easier and more delicious grilled corn recipe we've used in the past.

Just soak the corn with husks on from anywhere from 1/2 hour to many hours.
Grill over high heat, turning until the husked are mostly blackened.
Take off heat and wait about 1/2 hour or so until cool enough to handle.
Corn peels easily, silks come off easy, corn ready to eat as is or whatever you want to add to it.

So easy. Came out perfect. Next time I won't put the salt and butter on it. I'd rather do it before I eat it. The corn took up all the grill space so we cooked it first, then wrapped it in a towel and put it in an empty cooler. It stayed piping hot until we were ready for it

This corn was delicious! I followed Wharton31 advice and soaked the corn for over an hour in water leaving the husk on.  I took off the silk which was visible and threw them on the grill. After 35 minutes on high heat I husked them added buttter, salt and pepper. Yum! The tin foil method would work too but why waste it. Excellent recipe for camping thank you!

Delicious and simple. We don't like corn with sugar so this recipe was perfect. I ended up removing all the husks and just used aluminum foil and it was still tasty and tender. I also soaked the corn in warm water with salt ( maybe 2 qts. Water to 1/4 c  salt) to tenderize it a little. Soaked for about 2 hours.

I made this just as directed in the recipe and it was fabulous.  The temp of the gas grill was 450 for about 20 min then I put on some brats and it was about400 for the remaining 10 mins. I rotated twice.  Will be doing this again soooo easy

did this today,  soaked corn  and put on the grill, after cutting the exposed silk.  Took 30 minutes,  and was just perfect!  Thanks for the suggestions in reviews.   was amazed that the silk came right off.  much simpler than original recipe.   may try the original to see which is best.  Can't give a 5 as I did modifications based on reviews.

I pumped my flame a little higher as we enjoy that char flavor on corn.  I used garlic salt instead of plain salt.  I'm not a fan of corn but even I loved this.  New family favorite!

I used some of the other suggested additions like chili powder and cumin. These were amazing. I though I'd bought too many cobs for our 4th of July BBQ but they vanished in the first 15 minutes of the event!  I barely got to try one!

As I have never grilled corn on the cob before, I followed the instructions as closely as possible,  with fingers crossed for a good outcome!
I was impressed at how easy this was for a 'first-timer' to do. Thumbs up from all family members.
Since I was grilling chicken quarters also, I do believe the grill temp varied slightly throughout; however the corn and chicken were both cooked perfectly.
Thanks for the recipe - one I will certainly use again this summer!

This is a good method & makes the corn very tasty.  However, I like more grill taste so next time I will leave off the foil & put the corn husks directly on the grill.  They will also cook faster than 30 minutes.

Easy and delicious way to cook corn. After reading reviews we left the husk and silk on, just made sure there were no worms and no rot. We wrapped them in foil and grilled on a high heat. I mixed real butter with a little salt, pepper, finely chopped garlic and paprika and brushed on after shucking. Great flavor. Next time we will cook at a little lower heat but keep all the same.

Simple but produces great results. I used herbed butter to ramp this recipe up a notch. There key is to keep moving that ear around every few minutes. Mine got a little scorched but was still amazing!

I used to use the same method many have said - sit in water, no foil and grill.  I have changed to this and LOVE it.  The difference is that it is easier to remove the silk with the corn cold and not cooked.  Second, by adding the butter and seasonings before cooking, it comes out perfectly seasoned and moist every time.  Instead of steaming in water it basically steams in the butter.  The only thing we have changed is that we also sprinkle a little bit of sugar on it along with the S&P to add just a tiny bit additional sweetness.  Thanks for a great recipe!!!

Grilled Corn on the Cob Haiku: "What's with these reviews? All saying 'soak this''do that', Just make recipe!" I enjoy my corn on the cob boiled, simmered, buttered and salted, ez-peazy, or if from a roadside veggie stand near Charleston SC, just straight up raw. I thought I'd try this method just for a change, since I was already turning on the grill for pork chops. I made it exactly as directed, no soaking or any other steps tossed in, and found the corn to be delicious in exactly 30 min.

I followed this recipe to a tee. I cooked it for 30 minutes as instructed. Turning them every so often. When they were done I opened the foil and they were burnt black. I was very disappointed.

Very easy and keeps the corn tender.  I would do less pepper next time.

I was dreaming of the charred corn on the cob I enjoy at street fairs and the San Gennaro festival in Little Italy.  This wasn't quite the same, but had great taste nonetheless.  I followed the recipe verbatim, except used my cuisinart grill instead of an outdoor one (apartment dweller :/ ), maybe an outdoor grill as the recipe called for would have been better.  Thank you for sharing!

Wonderful! I took the advice of other reviewers... soaked in water for thirty minutes, didn't bother removing the silk (good idea, it practically falls off after being cooked). The end product reminded of fresh corn on the cob I used to have back home in Illinois, really delicious. Thanks for posting this simple but great recipe!

This was to die for!  I just wrapped up the cob (husk and silk and all) in foil (shiny side in) and grilled on high heat for about 20 min. I rotated the corn and changed grill position every 5 minutes. So delicious!!

Did as the other reviewers suggested and soaked the corn in water for a couple of hours.  Then I cooked them in the smoker and when they came out, seasoned them as suggested.  My husband ate four pieces by himself, and I can't usually get him to eat vegetables!

I love grilled corn on the cob. My parents made it for me as a kid and I still love it! It's better to use yellow sweet corn.

Honestly, all I did was soak the corn in cold water for about 4 hours, then wrap them in foil with the shiny side inside. Then grilled for 30 min. Perfect! I just did not want to season/butter them before because everyone had different preferences.

I suggest soaking it in clean luke warm water for at least 30 min to soften it up a little bit.  I do not take any of the husk out.  I pull it all back, add  butter, (run it over the butter-long way) and place the husk back onto corn.  The husk helps to perserve the flavor, I think.  I never add salt or pepper because some people need to watch thier salt intake.

We grill them in the husk, and afterwards add some butter, but usually omit salt and pepper.  The corn has a wonderful natural taste.

I used fat free spray butter, salt, pepper, and paprika.  This wasn't as simple as I thought it would be- preparing the corn for the grill took longer than expected, but overall the flavor of grilled corn is wonderful!

Didn't care for this; like other recipes better. Followed the recipe to the letter, not sure what went wrong.

mmmmm, what a great roasted taste. preparing the corn was a bit tedious but worth it! i lightly rinsed the outer leaves to make sure the corn didn't get dried out (some people soak their corn overnight or wrap it with wet newspaper)then just used butter & salt. evan's city corn is our local favorite. thanks sue!

Our corn came out very tender.  I cooked it on the grill over medium-high heat for 45 minutes.  I should have added more salt (I used Kosher, do I need more or less?) and pepper- it didn't have a lot of flavor but it was still good.
