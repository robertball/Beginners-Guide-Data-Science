My father's remark, upon trying what I call a "Bruschetta Salsa": "You could bottle and sell this stuff!" (said between chip bites). 

This is an excellent salsa, and the taste is truly unique and satisfying. Since 
"salsa" means sauce in both Italian and Spanish, it makes sense that this dip bridges the two cultures as well.

I chopped the ingredients up in my food processor for a more minced-like texture and then poured the salsa over some plain, broiled chicken. Then, of course, I popped out the tortilla chips and we all chowed down. Wow, what a taste experience!

I was kinda unsure about how this would turn out, but it was great!  The only change I made was to double the cumin.  I would make this again.

This is now my favorite salsa.  The addition of the artichokes really enhanced it.  I did not have lemon juice but I had fresh lime juice and used fresh lime basil [that I had found at a greenhouse].  I also used a couple of fresh hot peppers.  I put it on top of a cheese omelot.  Wonderful!!!

I took this to a potluck yesterday and everyone liked it.  6 people asked for the recipe if I would share it.
I added some sliced green olives on the top.

I hate to be the only person going against the tide of positive reviews for this recipe but feel I must.  I made this for a family BBQ on Labor Day and it fell flat! Only one person ate it after tasting it, my 21 yr old grandson who states, "if its edible I'll eat it"! Really disappointed after reading so many RAVE reviews!

This is awesome stuff.  I barely noticed the onions, and I don't like onions.  I made this for a party over the weekend and everyone loved it.  Very nice as a dip and I think it's great all by itself as a salad type dish.  I love the tanginess of artichokes, and mixed all together with the other ingredients, it's divine.  Thanks for the recipe!  Another pot luck hit!  :o)

This was wonderful.  I could not find fresh basil, so I only used 1 tbs of dried basil.  We loved it, it had good texture and taste was so fresh.  I took as a appy for a dinner party.  It was well received.  Thank you for the recipe.

This was amazing!  I've never made anything before that went so fast, I had to make it a week later.  I did add 2 jalapenos for a little more of a kick.

I was surprised with all the glowing reviews that this did not turn out well at all. I've let it set in the fridge for two days waiting for it to get better, and it's not happening. I'm going to try and find some way to use this to try and avoid wasting food, but the flavor on it's own is unfortunately not good, sorry.

I've been looking for some recipes to use some of my fresh basil with and this one caught my eye!  I chopped the tomatoes, onions and artichokes separately in the food processor and just mixed them all together with the olives before I folded the dressing in. 

  The only changes I made were to cut out the cilantro (not a fan of it) and add one diced, seeded, green jalapeno pepper.  My boyfriend and I both LOVE it and I have been eating it with a spoon all day. :)

I made this salsa with my 8th grade cooking class.  They loved it!  One of them even said "This is healthy and it tastes good, I didn't think that was possible!"  I had tons of requests from students not in my class for the recipe because they heard how good it was.

best recipe ever!!!!!  popped the finished salsa into my food processor to give it a couple pulses. this made it a lot easier to scoop with tortilla chips and a lot easier to spoon onto wraps.  the boyfriend LOVED this recipe!!! i made this salsa with the meat marinade section of the Carne Asada Tacos recipe from this site. by the end of the night, the tacos were all gone and we were stuffed to the point of needing to unbutton our jeans.. but for some reason, we were still able to eat a big bag of blue chips with this amazing salsa!  Takes a while to chop everything up.. but totally worth it.  ps. used a lot more hot pepper flakes than called for.

I love this recipe (as amended by me, but still mostly the same).  I dropped the olives out because i hate olives.  I took half the lemon juice it asks for and swapped it for lime juice for more Mexican flavor.  I also add a handful of grape tomatoes because they are so flavorful.  With those changes, this recipe works great as salsa on chips or as a flavor boost for sandwiches or lettuce wraps.

If anyone gives this less than a 5 star maybe it must be  a dislike for a certain ingredient.  I made this for a corporate office party of 150 guests.  I made the recipe times 8 to have enough.  Everyone went ga ga over it.  3 people weren't crazy about olives so they picked those out and one hates cilantro which you don't really taste but he saw it.
This is a marvelous recipe.  I have emailed the recipe non-stop to the recipe requesters from the gathering.

I'm giving this 4 stars because, although I wasn't that impressed, my guest were. They even asked for the recipe - they would give it a five.

My family really enjoyed this.  I did make a couple of changes, I omitted the black olives, I used lime juice instead of lemon juice, and I used oregano instead of Italian seasoning.  It was really good.  I will definitely be making this recipe again!  Thanks for the great recipe.

I took this to the Christmas potluck yesterday and everyone was eating it by the spoonfuls.  I tripled the recipe.  Good thing I did.
I will be making this all the time now.
I passed the recipe around too.
Thank you for such a wonderfully tasty treat!

This is a definite keeper in my recipe box.  This is so easy to make, looks and tastes delicious.  Goes well with tortilla chips, crackers, toasted italian bread; pretty much anything. You can be creative with this Salsa.

I made this for Halloween and again for Thanksgiving and now I've joined to review it.
WONDERFUL!  I will make it for Xmas and New Year's too.
Make if a few hours before so the flavors blend.

My test came when I served this to an Italian family.  Wow!  They loves it and each and every person there wanted the recipe. I added a little more olives to mine.
THank you so much and post more recipes here for us.

I made this for the guys and me at work.  We ate is on chips, stuffed it in our submarine sandwiches, it went super fast.
I will make 2 batches next time.  Easy recipe for a guy to make who doesn't know how to cook.

This was OK.  I took it to a party and it wasn't very popular.  I had plenty of leftovers to share.

I just made it and I hope, hope, hope I have some left over for the big party I am having tonight.  The mixture of flavors is AWESOME.  Next time I may get creative and add garbonzo beans, kidney beans and corn.  Perhaps I will add before the party so i can refill the bowl! excellent!

I made ravioli and served this as an appetizer.  All the guests certainly enjoyed it.  I could have doubled this recipe and still had none left-over

I made this for Mother's Day brunch and it was gone in a flash.  Thank you for this keeper. Went well on top of the omelets.
