I took this to a dinner party, and it was a total flop.  I think I was the only one who had more than one taste; I had to have two or three crackers of the stuff just trying to figure out why it was rated so highly.  I was very disappointed, because this recipe had so many rave reviews.  It was salty, and the ranch taste was overpowering.  In fact, no one could tell that there was chicken in it. It was simple to make, and the ingredients are easy to keep on hand, so I guess it might be a good recipe to have for emergencies.

This was so easy and yummy! I found southwestern ranch mix and used that to give it a little extra kick and instead of rolling in nuts (I don't care for nuts). I threw in a cup of shredded cheddar cheese and 1/4 cup real bacon pieces. I didn't even bother rolling it into a ball, I just served it in a dish. HUGE HIT!!!

This was a big hit at my office party. I doubled the amount of chicken and it turned out really good. However, it was almost too salty. Next time I will not use the entire package of Ranch.

This was a tasty cheese ball! I used 2 cooked chicken breasts (diced) instead of canned chicken and used minced celery (apprx about 1 stalk worth) instead of the nuts. Very good. There's none left so that's saying something since I served this with several other "favorite & pre-tested" appetizer recipes found on this site. Will make again! Thanks Laura!

I first got this recipe here this last Spring, and since I have made it a half a dozen times.  Everyone loves it.  It's easy and very yum!  I've even added pepperjack shredded cheese to it to give it a kick!  Shape into a football for the parties this fall.

Wow!  I wanted to make something a little different than an ordinary cheesball and this was fantastic!  I took the advice of some others and used lowfat cream cheese and some lowfat shredded cheddar and everyone loved it!  So good and easy!

I have made this one twice now, and it is really good. I only put about 3/4 the amount of ranch mix the second time I made it, and it wasn't as salty.

I had this at a party and couldn't believe it contained canned chicken.  I made it later for another party and it was well-liked.  THEN I made it at the beach for a crowd of hungry guests.  They watched me make it and very few people ate it because I used chicken from a pouch.  I am pretty sure if they had not seen me make it, they would have liked it as much as me.  I also think it is better if it has a few hours to sit and let the flavors mesh.  I will make it again, especially because it is SO EASY!  You can use low-fat cream cheese without changing the taste too much.

This was pretty good as is but add hot sauce and it is really good - either in the dip before serving or put the bottle beside and let guest add as desired.

I think this tastes delicious as originally written, but it is even better with a few modifications. I boiled one large chicken breast and chopped the meat it with my food chopper.  I added about 2 Tab. cooked, chopped bacon and one finely chopped green onion. I used only 2 Tab. of ranch dressing mix (I use the canister, and it says 3 Tab. = a 1 ounce pkg). I rolled the ball in minced celery, as suggested in another review. It worked beautifully, and it had a funky, fresh spring-green hue.

I make this a lot. I change the taste by rolling it in parsley, or a mixture of parsley and chives, or chili powder. Very versatile.

My sister doesn't like pecans, so I opted to cover this with more cheese! The ranch flavor really stood out. I liked it. Next time my sister isn't with me, I'll make it with the pecans!

Excellant flavor. I used real chicken as I don't like using canned stuff when I can use fresh. Also put in bacon bits. It was all delicious. Will make again often.

I have been making this cheeseball for about ten years now -- truly one of my "go to" appetizers. I also use it as a filling for tiny finger sandwiches, or piped into celery "boats" -- just mix in some of the pecans with the other ingredients instead of using as a coating. It also tends to taste less salty when served like this (most crackers will add to the saltiness)!

This was wonderful and a complete hit at the Christmas party I took it to. The only change I made was adding more chicken. I used just about twice the chicken (well drained) than it calls for. But I will definitely be making it time and time again!

This was terrific & SIMPLE!  The only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars is because the chicken definitely needs doubled.  I also added a handful of shredded cheddar.

I made this for a party and it was a huge hit. Instead of adding buttermilk ranch there is a new ranch packet called Fiesta Ranch and it adds a great flavor. Also added a few chopped green onions and served with Southwest flavored Ritz Chips.

Very fast and easy to make and received a lot of complements on this.  I also doubled the chicken as suggested by some of the other reviews, which made it even better:)

This was a hit at a family birthday party. It tastes best with RITZ or CLUB crackers. I also used 10 oz of chicken instead of 5 oz.  Great taste!

This was GREAT!!!! Took it as a healthy snack to our childbirthing class. I changed to lite cream cheese and added a 1/2 cup finely shredded reduced fat cheddar cheese, and served it with multi grain and wheat crackers. I will make this over, and over again.

Very Good! I used grilled chicken breast and added 1 Tbsp. of chopped green onion. I also think it is better chilled over night.

I will admit this is ugly but you can't judge a book by it's cover.  Everyone seemed to like it because it's was the only appetizer that was almost gone.

I made this Chicken Cheese Ball for our Thanksgiving Dinner at work and people were begging me for the recipe. I also made one for my family and they loved it as well! I do recommend using a large can of chicken though instead of the smaller can. But other than that, this recipe is 'off the chain', as my son would say!!!

This recipe was super simple.  I did take the advice of other reviewers and only used half of the dressing mix.  I think a whole package would have been too much.  I also added 1 TBSP or so of crumbled bacon.  I didn't roll it in anything.  I just made it into a ball and sprinkled more bacon on top for looks.  Everyone liked it.  I am going to make it again for my bunco party.

This cheeseball is delicious!  I served it at a party, and it was such a big hit, I served it again later in the week at another function I hosted.  Everyone asked for the recipe!  It was different, and flavorful, and went well with some Harvest Grain crackers I picked up at the last minute.  I will definately make this recipe again and again!  You can't beat it for speed and ease and the results are WONDERFUL!

This is a really good recipe… I've made it many times and it's always a hit. I've seen reviews of it being too salty, and if you're sensitive to salt you would want to cut the ranch however the first time I made it I felt it was too salty and realized I had only used one package of cream cheese instead of two. I also put at least 10 ounces of chicken inside and more if I can find a bigger can:)

I cut back on the ranch dressing mix to 2 Tablespoons,  added 2 tsp. Tabasco or hot sauce, 3 Tbsp. canned chopped green chiles, and doubled the chicken. I would also add some grated cheddar next time.  It is, and will be, my favorite cheese ball to make, so easy, and yet so delicious.

I found a similar recipe in Reliah Magazine. It had 10 0z chicken breast, 1 cup Feta Cheese along with the cream cheese, ranch dressing. And a jar of stuffed olives, chopped. This really added to the flavor. Rolled in chopped pecans and chilled.  it was a great hit at Thanksgiving.

I wish I could give this recipe two ratings. It tasted really good on crackers, but had that metallic-canned smell. I didn't see any other comments on the smell, so maybe it was just what I bought. I'll definately try again, using a different kind of chicken. Very easy to make too.

I made this for New Years Eve and wow!! This was so easy and I had everything on hand. I did cut this in half but kept the same amount of chicken.  I also finely chopped the pecans in the food processor, which made it more presentable (it looked pretty).  My mom said she is not a big fan of cheese balls - but she said this was delish!  This is one I will keep around for upcoming parties!

I've been bringing this cheese ball to holiday parties at the office for a couple of years.  This year, I didn't bring it and was told by several people how upset they were!  I spent time on the weekend making three cheese balls and brought them into the office.  People love them and they're so easy to make!

This is a great shower or get together item. I am always asked for the recipe everytime I make it. Make sure that the cream cheese softens well, or it will be hard to mix. I always serve it with wheat thins and club crackers.

I made this for a party with no real intention on eating it, because cheese balls are not my favorite. I was asked to try some of it and I did and, WOW, it was really good.  I did not put the entire packet of seasoning in it and I also doubled the amount of chicken. I will be making this again for our family.

This was the easiest and best tasting cheese ball I ever had.  I brought it to a party and everyone loved it.  I will be bringing this from now on to everyone's home.  I wasn't sure how to rate it for kid friendly because the adults ate it before the kids got a chance to try it!

I have made this several years for Thanksgiving get togethers and everyone loves it!  I usually double the amount of chicken, but It is also good with just the one can of chicken.

It makes enough, I divide it into 2 balls.

This chicken cheese ball gets rave reviews from all my family!  I make it every Thanksgiving and New Year's and it is a huge hit!

The only thing I do differently is to double the amount of chicken, and to add some cheddar cheese-- a handful or two mixed in to the ball and another handful to roll it in, along with the pecans.  The cheddar gives a nicer flavor and color to it.  I noticed some reviewers thought the ranch mix was too salty, but I've never had any complaints and I always put the whole packet in.

This recipe is definitely a keeper!

This recipe is a favorite among my friends.  Two suggestions- add a drained small can of crushed pineapple for a great addition. For gluten I tolerate  people, simply leave out the ranch dressing mix.  It is still great.  Can also be used as chicken salad for sandwiches or on top of a salad.

I tried this at a party and loved it.  I couldn't beleive that it was made with canned chicken.  I'm not usually a big fan of that.  This is the one recipe I will buy canned chicken for.

Whenever I make this, all the women rave about it, but the men don't seem to like it.  My Dh says it makes his breath stink.

I brought this to a Superbowl party and it was scooped up before any of the other appetizers.  Everyone complimented me on it so thanks for the great recipe!
