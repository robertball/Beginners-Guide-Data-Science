I made this cake 3 times in one week, I didn't have any nutmeg so I decided to try adding a tsp. of ginger, it was real good, everyone loved it.  Yesterday I made the pear cake again but this time using nutmeg,it was good but everyone liked the first ones better (made with the ginger).  The nutmeg gives it a more spicy taste, with the cloves & cinnamon it's already "spicy" and the ginger compliments instead of overpowering. I will use only ginger when I make this cake, and I will be making these often too. :)  It's a wonderful, moist cake.  I baked it for 60 minutes.  Perfect!  This is a great recipe.

My husband and I really enjoyed this cake.  I did halve the nutmeg and cloves because a lot of the reviewers recommended it and I was afraid I'd get a Spice Cake with some pears when what I wanted was a Pear Cake with some spices.  I was pleased with the balance.  Also, I think the 2 cups of sugar was fine, not too sweet and I used 2 eggs instead of 4 egg whites(I hate trying to figure our what to do with 4 egg yolks!).  One thing I want to caution other bakers about, is that I feel my oven heats to a reliable temperature and at 60 minutes I felt like this cake was perhaps 5 minutes overdone.  Next time I will start checking it at 50 minutes even though some reviewers said that the hour and 10 minutes was not enough!

This recipe was sooooooooooooooo good, I did change the recipe a little, I added half wheat and half white flour and added apple sauce instead of the oil. I also added a half cup less sugar, and used ripe pears.  I did'nt leave the pears in the sugar for an hour, only for the time it took me to get all ingredients together and then when asked for, put them in and I added walnuts instead of pecans. It took only an hour to bake!..perfecto!..it tasted really good!

My family enjoyed this cake.  After I sprayed my pan I coated it with a cinnamon/sugar mixture.  I substituted ginger for the cloves and drizzled a powdered sugar, milk & vanilla glaze over the top. This cake would also be good with apples.  I'll definitely make this again.

What better way to use pears?  I found the spices in this recipe to be perfect.  Very flavorful and I would not change the amounts.  This cake was very moist and the fact that it's "healthy" (well, compared to most cakes!) is a bonus.  I wouldn't change one thing about this recipe.

Tastes like a real home cooked country style cake. I used five pears, I diced 2  1/2 and grated 2  1/2. I also used butter in place of the oil. The cake was moist and flavourful - yummy!!!

This cake was wonderful.  I used ginger instead of nutmeg and cut the spices in half.  I also used cake flour.  While the pears sat for an hour with the sugar they were joined by 1 T. Myers's Dark Rum and 1 t. vanilla.

People loved the cake and asked for the recipe.  Thanks so much for a delicious, beautiful cake.

Excellent!  I made the cake exactly as listed, and the results were delicious.  Moist, spicy, nice pear fruit cooked throughout.  I will make this one again.

Excellent! This is a great recipe to use for the pears that had spots cut out of them, since you will chop them anyway. I took eight cups of pear slices, then used a pastry blender to chop them up into smaller pieces, reducing the volume to four cups. I also added the spices to the pear mixture to allow the flavours to soak into the fruit while sitting. Finally, I used cake flour instead of all-purpose flour for a slightly more tender and finer-grained cake. This is a keeper!

Good but next time I will reduce the amt of cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg.  Even though they are my signature spices, they overpowered the overall flavor of the cake/pears.  Spices are to enhance tastes! Still, good and I am sure we will all love this the next time I make it...with the reductions suggested! Thanks Barbara!

A good cake. I used a mixture of apples and pears, since we have a ton of those this time of year, from our many trees. It's like a spice cake. It needed a longer baking time than the recipe asked for.

Moist, held together well, mild pear flavor, mild spice, serves a lot.  First time I made this, I did use two whole eggs instead of whites, and switched out the nutmeg with ginger (I love ginger).  Following other reviewers, I cut the sugar in half both times.  It's just mildly sweet this way, with the ripe pears I had, and that's great.  Icing or ice cream would make it sweeter, and I'm sure it would be fine with the full amount - just more of a sweet "dessert" cake.  Really, a great use of these pears (although the next day, the pear flavor all but disappears, for some reason.)  Thanks for the recipe!  UPDATE: 1/2 recipe in 2 mini loaf pans for about 50-55 min works great when you've only got a couple small pears to use up.

Very tasty!  Easy to make.  I altered the recipe slightly based upon previous reviews, and what I had on hand.  I left the peel on the pears to enhance the pear flavor, and also because I'm somewhat lazy.  Used 1 cup white sugar, and 1/2 cup brown sugar, used 1/3 cup melted butter and 1/3 cup canola oil.  For spices I use nearly 2 teaspoons of cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon cloves, 1/4 teaspoon ginger, and a sprinkle of nutmeg.  Raw batter tasted somewhat overpowered by the cloves, but after baking, the balance of spices was perfect!  I sprayed the cake pan with cooking spray and sprinkled inside with a combo of powdered sugar and cinnamon.  Monitor the baking time; at about 45 minutes I kept adding 5 minutes, 5 minutes more, etc. until done.  Even after passing the toothpick test, the cake was still a little 'wet' around the pear pieces.  I will make again for sure!

I read ALL the reviews before making and took a few things into account. I'm not known for being an excellent baker or cook but for the first time in my life, I received RAVE reviews from friends and coworkers on this!  First, as for the spices, if you generally like spice cake, leave the amount of spices alone as it's perfect!  I used 2 whole eggs and it was just fine.  I also used half unbleached white flour and half wheat flour.  I used half organic sugar and half brown sugar.  I love vanilla so I added 1 tsp.  Please DO let the sugar and pears sit for one hour as it lets them “sugar” and soften, especially if you are using slightly unripe pears.  I've made this with both ripe and harder pears and both turned out great.  As for preparing the pears, it was awkward cutting them as I have never done it before.  I did not skin them, I just cut out the core.  I found this easiest by first cutting the top part including the stem off, slice in half lengthwise, cut the bottom “flower” end out of each half, then cut both halves in half again.  You now have 4 pieces, each with a part of the core.  Simply run the knife down the spine starting at the smaller end working to the larger end.  The core cuts out very quick and easy this way.  I used a bunt pan and buttered and sugared it instead of flour, came out nicely with a slightly hardened sweet outside.  Perfect!

This cake is wonderful!  Did not have pecans so substituted raisins.  I also grated the pears instead of chopped.  Baked in 9x13" baking pan.  Turned out great!

This was awesome!  I didn't bother peeling the pears - wasn't noticeable at all.  I did reduce the spices, as others suggested.  I cut the nutmeg and cloves in half because they are such strong spices, but left the cinnamon the same.  Perfect!  Also, I wouldn't suggest using the ready to use egg whites that come in a carton - measuring them to equal 4 egg whites was a guessing game, and I guessed wrong!  I used 1/3 cup, which, according to the label, was equal to 2 eggs (I figured 2 eggs would be the same as 4 egg whites). It was too much liquid, and took forever to get done.  I will definitely try this recipe again, using regular egg whites.  Cake was a huge hit anyway!  Thanks for the recipe!

I don't normally change recipes ..but pears are my favorite fruit so I had to soup up this recipe a bit. I used two whole eggs and two whites, half white sugar half brown..no clove added ginger and cardamon and maple extract. Added yellow raisins instead of nuts. Made big bakery style muffins w/crumb topping and cream cheese drizzle! To die for!I got 18  muffins with this recipe.

This cake had great pear flavor and is quite filing. This is a good cake to eat fresh - it doesn't hold up long. After a couple of days the spices became overpowering and it became spice cake with no pear flavor.

I made a few tweaks to the recipe:
Used 1/2 c. brown sugar (as per another baker's comment), and only 1 1/3 c. white sugar.
Decreased cloves by 1/2 (again, per comment).
I substituted 1/2 c. applesauce for 1/2 c. of the oil (so only used about 1/4 c. oil).
I used 1. cup whole wheat flour, 2 cups regular flour.
The cake turned out wonderfully- a spice cake with pear undertones, moist but not mushy.  I'd make again with these modifications.

I really liked this cake!  I used fresh pears from my tree, and the flavor was excellent.  The cake was also really moist.  The only problem was that it stuck to my bundt pan and came out in about 5 pieces instead of one.  I patched it up though, and it was fine.  Next time I'll grease and flour it instead of the cooking spray.

I made this cake yesterday with very ripe pears, and it came up absolutely delicious! As some people suggested, I amde some modifications: I used 1/2 of the cinnamon and 1/2 of the cloves but I kept the nutmeg as is because I love the taste of it. I did not wanted to waste foru egg yolks, so I used 2 eggs instead of the 4 egg whites, and I had a piece of butter which once melted made approximately  1/4 cupe, so I added the oil to make it 2/3 as indicated in the recipe. I marinaded the pears in the sugar to which I added 1 teaspoon of lemon juice to prevent too much browing (did not have to do it since the cake turns brown any way) and I added 1 tablespoon of rum.  The cooking time was 50 minutes for a picture perfect cake, moist, and full of pears flavor. My daughter claimed 3/4 of the cake as her own, so I will have to make another one for the rest of the family. Absolutely the best cake I have made from scratch with fresh fruits. Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

This was delicious- ate some right out of the oven.  I didn't want to wait over an hour for it to bake, so I used a 13X9 pan and baked it at 350 for about 35+ min.  Sprinkled with powdered sugar.  Will try next time with ginger vs. nutmeg as was suggested and will cut sugar by 1/2 cup as it was little sweet for my taste.  Thanks!

This was a surprise hit since I've never made a pear cake.  But, the combination of the pear and the pecans and spices are to die for!  It's fancy enough for a dinner party, but casual enough for every day.  Highly recommended!

I made a few substitutions: half whole wheat flour, brown sugar instead of white (and a little less of it), and pear puree (applesauce would work too) for some of the oil. And I made muffins instead of a cake/loaf. Great way to use up some pears, I would chop them up smaller next time I think, they really don't bake down at all so the size you cut them is the size you get in the final product. Turned out great, if not a little on the sweet side for my tastes (even with the substitution and skimping a little on the sugar) - easily remedied to suit taste though, and it *was* supposed to be a cake afterall...  :)  Will make again!

Very moist and flavorful.  I did add fresh grated ginger since I had some in the fridge and a drizzle of vanilla glaze.  Everyone loved it!  Most people did think that it was an apple cake though.

Awesome!! I used 4 pears, chopped. 1/3 c applesauce + 1/3 c canola oil instead of all oil.  I didn't have ground cloves, so I substituted ginger.  And I used 2 eggs instead of 4 whites.  I only had a handful of walnuts, so I threw them in...hubby doesn't care for nuts, so that was a good compromise anyway.  This cake is absolutely fantastic!  I just finished a piece and I could go for another!

This is such a treat in our house when we have pears to use up. I use 2 whole eggs instead of the egg whites and just add the pear mixture last. Terrific and so moist!

I took several others' suggestions: used 1&1/2 cups white sugar, and 1/2 cup brown sugar, as well as cutting down the nutmeg to 1/2 teaspoon. The cake was good, but with the pecans in it, I agree it is more like a bread.  The outer crunchy part was the best, and this batter would make great muffins.  Put crisco inside the bundt pan then dust with white sugar for the sweet/crunchy outer layer.  All in all, a flavorful bread and nicely presented in a bundt pan.  Cook a little bit longer than the 1 hr & 10 min.  I think probably another 5 or 10 minutes would be good.

I loved it -- it's a little like a pumpkin cake except, well, not so pumpkin-y. Same idea. I went a little easy on the cinnamon and split the nutmeg into half-nutmeghalf-ginger. I used about 5 medium-sized pears, and I cut them pretty finely (food processor makes it very easy). I used a caramel glaze on it that worked very well. (14 cup butter, 1 tbsp corn syrup, 12 cup brown sugar, combined, heated, and boiled for 1 minute)

This is a great cake.  I took the advice of a previous review and used ginger instead of nutmeg. Also, it did take a little longer than an hour and 10 minutes to bake.  I added 5 additional minutes and it was perfect.  Keep checking it every few minutes because if the cake dries out, the whole thing will be ruined.  The taste is great!  I wasn't sure it would turn out at first because when I "poured" it into the bundt pan, it was SO thick.  But, it turned out really, really, good.

Love this recipe. It also works great with apples. The only change I make is to reduce the sugar and throw in some ground flax.  I find it's way too sweet with the intended amount of sugar.

A fail proof recipe and another fantastic way to use the hundreds of pears that have fallen in the back yard! I noticed that those who did have good luck making this, did not follow the instructions.  You must follow the recipe!  The only addition I made was a streusel topping and a vanilla drizzle for the top.  (I have a wicked sweet tooth!)  My boyfriend took it to work and everyone when crazy for it.  His words:  "Even the skinny girls came back for seconds!" haha  The recipe is a keeper!

Very easy & fast to put together. My pears were very juicey & ripe, so no need to soak in sugar longer then the time it takes to get all the other ingredients together. I left out the nuts, didn't miss them at all. Very moist & will make again, maybe next time trying it with apples. I took the advice of others and cut the spice amounts down by half & added ginger. This was very sweet & moist. No need for any icing. Nice cake.

moist tasty cake.  perfect cake if your pears are just past wanting to be eating them fresh. Everyone wanted this receipe & seconds.  I would make this every fall from now on. I didnt use the baking pan that this requires.  I instead used a loaf pan and it was just fine done that way.  A little FYI use the exact amount of cloves recepie requires otherwise your tongue will notice.

for anyone scared of the calorie count, i altered the recipe, ommitting the nuts, using half whole wheat flour, and substituting applesauce for canola oil, and made 20 muffins, i roughly calculated each muffin to be about 175 calories

After reading many reviews, I adjusted the recipe by reducing the sugar to 1 1/2 cups, omitted the nutmeg and cloves but added 1/2 tsp ginger, used two whole eggs instead of egg whites, and added 1 tbsp rum, 1 tbsp lemon juice, and 1 tsp vanilla to apples while they were soaking. I made a rum glaze and drizzled it over the cake after it cooled slightly - OMGoodness! This has become my all-time favorite cake! I think it's a very forgiving recipe, and many changes can be made to fit your preferences. I had a bumper crop of pears this year, so I'll be in the process of freezing a whole bunch of pears so that I can make this cake all winter long!

Most awesome cake! Made this with some overripe pears I had, used 5 pears. I was a little worried that the batter was VERY stiff, almost dry...but I resisted the urge to add more liquid and stuck to the recipe as posted. It turned out perfectly moist and delicious. I only let the pears sit in the sugar for the time it took me to assemble the other ingredients, perhaps that is why it semed dry, but it still resulted in a perfect cake. I had to increase the cooking time by 10 minutes for the knife to come out clean from a bundt pan. Definitely a keeper!

Nice recipe, the taste of pears in the cake is delicious. I halved the spices and they were still too much, will use a quarter next time. The sugar is way too much as well - even just one cup of sugar was too much for my taste. Next time will try with half a cup. Everything else worked well.

A great way to use pears off a real pear tree - not just the flowering bradford type, a real producing pear tree! In the fall there are plenty of pears, finding recipes to use them is very difficult. This recipe hits the spot!! A definate keeper in my recipe book!

I got rave reviews on this from my guests!  It was still moist when served the next day and had great flavour. the spice level was perfect and made it better than the average cake. I made the following changes: only used 1 cup sugar ( it was plenty sweet, esp with ice cream and salted caramel sauce from this website). I also subbed ginger for the nutmeg, used 2 whole eggs instead of egg white, and subbed half the oil for applesauce. Next time I will try grating the pear, but I didn't mind the chunks either. A very versatile recipe! I think I will go have another piece now...

Great recipe to play with!!! Added 1/4 teaspoon each of cardamom and ginger and just a touch of vanilla extract. Also went 2/3 pecans 1/3 walnuts. CAUTION: All pears are NOT created equal so beware of reviews advising you to cut back on the sugar unless you've already tried this and know from experience.  Cheers!

Very good. I followed the recipe as written but omitted the cloves because I didn't have any.  My non-sweet loving husband even liked.  Could sub apples and possibly zucchini.  Will definitely make again in the fall!

This was very good. I used three cans of pears as fresh are not in season right now. I drained them for about 20 mintes. As others suggested I cut the sugar to 1 1.2 cups and cut the spices in 1/2, which I was glad I did, as they added just enough flavor without overpowering it. I left out the pecans as I am not a "nut" person.

Delicious cake recipe! I didn't have access to fresh pears, so I used canned. Once the cake was cooled, I make a frosting out of powdered sugar, the leftover pear juice, and some orange juice. Turned out wonderful!

More of a bread then a cake.  Dense, full of pears, and delish.  I cut the sugar in half, added an extra cup of walnuts (net time will increase even more), added flax & wheat germ, and used 1 cup of whole grain wheat flour. Thanks for sharing.

Was just ok for us. Nothing wrong, but not worth the calories. I reduced the sugar to 1 cup and it was plenty sweet.

I followed some advice of others and halfed the spices, added ginger, allowed the spices to sit with the sugar and pears for the hour and then used two eggs instead of 4 whites and baked it a little under time - it came out perfectly moist, evenly spiced with wonderful pear flavor! just what an early fall evening ordered!

Great recipe I had to use ginger because I did not have nutmeg and I used a heaping tsp on cinnamon.  Great cake.  It gets sweeter when it sits over night.  For me the spices were not to strong but I like spice cake.  Great way to use up all the pears at our house.

Definitely a keeper.  To healthify it more, I reduced the sugar to less than 1/2c because I was using very ripe pears.  I think 2c would have been way too sweet.  I don't like separating eggs, so I used 2 whole eggs.  I also pureed some of the pears and substituted pear puree for the oil.  Added 1 tsp of ginger and decreased nutmeg to 1/2 tsp.   Love, love, love this cake.  Very moist. I've made 4 cakes in the last 2 days and everyone who has tried it likes it.

since everyone else seemed to replace the four egg whites with two whole eggs, i did the same thing.  i also toasted my pecans, made muffins instead of a bundt, and added a streusel topping.  these were pretty amazing.

I followed this pretty closely, except for I substituted 2 eggs for the 4 egg whites.  I also made them into muffins and baked them for 30 minutes.  They made 24 delicious muffins!

I used apples because I needed to get rid of some and the cake was delicious! It's like a spice cake with fruit chuncks in it---yummy! I drizzled some microwaved store-bought cream cheese frosting onto the cake and it was very nice looking. The cream cheese frosting complimented the cake very well. Thanks for an easy and scrumptuous recipe!

I made this tonight for my son's breakfast for tomorrow.  He loves banana "bread"...and after reading reviews, I decided why not.  The recipe doesn't say how thick to cut the pear up, so I did it in small bite size pieces.  After waiting for the sugar to mix in a little over an hour, there were still huge chunks that I tried to mash up with a potato masher.  Didn't quite work.  I didn't have a bundt pan, used a loaf pan and also had enough batter left to make 12 mini muffins.  Cooking time seemed longer than listed, but I am thinking it is because after the first 30 min, the oven was opened for me to take out the mini muffins.  So you'll just have to keep an eye on the cake or loaf that you make.  The chunks came in handy, nice texture.  I didn't have almonds, besides my toddler doesn't like them in his breads.  But the muffins came out great..tasty and moist!  I gave it four stars because of the time involved for waiting for the sugar and pears to form up and the baking time.

I haven't baked in a while but we had an abundant amount of pears just sitting in my fridge and I found this recipe!  I used 8 pears and put 4 in the food processor and roughly blended them.  I cut up the other 4 in chunky pieces.  I also used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar and followed other users' advice with the spices (1/4 tsp cloves, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1 tsp cinnamon).  I followed the baking times (1 hr 10min) but I think that was a little too long. If I make this again, I'd probably bake it at only 1 hour.  Thanks for the recipe!  My mom loves this cake!

The best receipe I own!  My husband loves it, my neighbors love it and I love it!  I have even replaced some of the pears with apple and have added dried fruit (just to change it up a little).  The only thing I adjust is the bake time.  I add 10-15 more minutes to the 2 loaves I make at a time.  Thank you to the person who shared this receipe!

I made this last night for family night.  My son, who is not a fruit lover gobbled his  piece and asked for more!  I reduced the sugar by a cup but added an additional cup of pears and the result was just delicious.  I will definitely make this again!

This cake is AWESOME!  I followed some of the reviewers suggestions to change the spices a bit.  I did the following: 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp ginger, 1/4 tsp cloves and 1/4 tsp nutmeg. Instead of 2 cups white sugar, I did 1 1/3 cup white sugar and 2/3 cup brown sugar.I also let the pears sit for about 1 1/2 hours and all the juices came out which made for an extremely moist cake!  I also finished the cake off with a powdered sugar glaze: 1 cup powdered sugar and couple Tablespoons milk, until you have a good consistency.  I put it in a bottle and drizzled on top. You can also get messy (fun for kids!) and dip your fingers in and drizzle it over the top.  Superb cake and now a favorite for the holidays!

Yummo!!!  My husband and I both loved this cake!  such a great way to use up pears from the tree.  The only alteration I made was with the spices.  I used 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon only because that's what I had on hand.  I also found it had to bake for 1 hour 15 mins in my oven.  Thanks for sharing!

I'm giving this four stars because I found the batter to be way too thick.  It was more like cookie dough.  That being said, I added about 1/2 cup milk, which did the trick.  The cake baked beautifully and tasted great.

I have been meaning to review this recipe for awhile. This is my family's absolute favorite dessert! I did follow some advice from other reviewers and halved the spices. I have won two contests with this cake, and someone is always asking for the recipe. I like to add a powdered sugar glaze to the top. This cake is wonderful!

My in-laws gave me a whole sack of pears so I started looking for recipes to use them up.  This is the first recipe I've tried and we loved it.  This is a great holiday cake.  I'm going to make a couple more and freeze them for later on.

Thank you, thank you for this great recipe.  I have a nephew who has a milk allergy and so this was perfect for him and it is also low fat.  By the way my nephew hates pears but boy does he love this cake, he always has 2 or 3 pieces and he is only 5.

This recipe was resulted in a LOT of batter. I don't have a Bundt pan so I used a filled a mini cupcake sheet (24 cakes). I had plenty of batter left. I could have filled a loaf pan, but I though it wouldn't be enough so I poured some batter in an 8 inch cake pan. Woah, still more batter. Hm. I filled the loaf pan with the rest, not enough. So I have some irregular shaped desserts on my hands. They all required different baking times, the mini cakes required about 15 minutes and then the times went up from there. Despite the fact that I was opening and closing the oven door too frequently the cakes turned out fine. Well risen and so light. I followed the recipe closely, altered the spices a bit based on reviews and what I had on hand in the moment. I also ALWAYS roast nuts (in this case I substituted walnuts for pecans because its what I had) before I chop them into a recipe. This drives people wild I've found because the flavor is earthy and deep and the nuts are crispier and lighter. I also added 1/2 teaspoon each of Vanilla & Almond Extract to the batter. In addition to those changes I made a simple walnut streusel and poured it on the top of the cakes. Some of them I put it on the bottom too, which I'd not recommend doing in the future as they were annoyingly sticky to deal with.

I took the advise of some of the comments by reducing the spices, etc, but I also chopped up some candied ginger and added to the mixture.  It was a nice balance of sweet pear and spicy sweet ginger!

Great cake. Everyone who tried it loved it and it smelled great. More of a fall cake then a summer cake though as it had the smell of a spice cake. Also, bc im lazy i added all the dry ingredients and the oil and eggs together in the kitchen aid and it became a super thick dough ball...so i threw in the peear and it moistened up a lot and looked like cake mix. great cake! thanks

I was looking for a recipe to use up my ripe pears and found this. It was very easy to make, easy to modify, and very tasty.  I used half the sugar the recipe called for, as well as half the spices. Instead of just oil, I melted 1/4 cup of butter in the measuring cup and topped the rest with oil. I did not use pecans, and also used 2 eggs instead of 4 egg whites. I do not have a bundt pan, but I had enough batter for 6 muffins and a loaf. The muffins took about 20 minutes, and the loaf took close to an hour. I then mixed icing sugar, milk, and vanilla to make a glaze and drizzled it over the loaf. Delicious! Don't be afraid to play around with this recipe and make your own little modifications. I can totally see me making this again, except with apples instead of pears.

Very good!  I used only 1/2 the sugar and drizzled a powedered sugar and milk glaze over the top.  It was delish and my boyfriend said it was the best cake he ever had.  I left the pears in nice bite sized chunks and it looked beautiful when you cut into the cake.

OMG.. I just made a pear "bread" from a recipe on ALLRECIPES and was reviewing it saying it was more like a CAKE, added frosting and everyone loved it that way.  I do more searching and here is this recipe EXACTLY like the "bread" recipe.  Than the reviewer before me says this recipe is more like a "Bread".  Talk about cross referencing! LOL.  This recipe is one that can be served like a bread or a cake.  I prefer it as a cake, with powdered sugar or a cream cheese frosting.

This one did not do it for me.  Followed recipe exactly and even let the cake cook a little longer.  Discovered it is not quiet done at the middle.  Not spicy enough.  Very moist though.  Would not make again.

This was a delicious, moist cake.  Those that said their cake cooked in 40 minutes must have set their ovens to 350* instead of 325*.  At 325*, like the recipe directs, it came out perfectly in an hour and 10 minutes.  I did make a few adjustments.  I changed the second column of ingredients to - 1/2 tsp. nutmeg, 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1/4 tsp. cloves, 3 eggs, 1/2 cup melted butter, 1/2 tsp. rum extract. I left out the pecans because my family is allergic...I'm sure they would make this cake that much more enjoyable!!

My son picked a basket full of pears, and they were UNDERripe, so I went looking for a recipe to try that would soften them up a little.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I only cooked for one hour.  It turned out quite well, and because the pears were underripe they did not turn mushy, instead they gave it a good contrast texture to the pecans.  It's much like a very sweet bread, and my family loved it.

THIS CAKE WAS WONDERFUL. I DID FOLLOW SOME OF THE OTHER USERS SUGGESTIONS. INSTED OF USING 2 CUPS OF WHITE SUGAR, I USED 1 CUP WHITE AND 1 CUP BROWN. I HALVED THE NUTMEG AND THE CLOVES, BUT I LEFT THE CINNAMON AT 1 TSP BECAUSE 1 TSP IS PERFECT FOR THAT AMOUNT OF CAKE. I GLAZED THE CAKE WITH A CARAMEL ICING. WHAT A BEAUTIFUL PRESENTATION USING A FLUTED BUNDT CAKE. IT WILL BE THE HIT OF ANY PARTY. THANKS SO MUCH. OH YA, I DID NOT HAVE TIME TO LET THE PEARS SOAK WITH THE SUGAR FOR 1 HOUR, BUT I LET IT SOAK FOR ABOUT 10 MINUTES. TURNED OUT JUST FINE.

We really liked this and my 5 yr old son requested it again today. I have had none of the problems others have reported. I think this time I will add a little ginger too.

Very good.  I baked it in a 9x13 instead of a bundt pan, for approximately 45 minutes.  It tastes like Nana's Apple Cake mix from Tastefully Simple.  I will be making this again very soon.

this recipe is delicious! not at all what i expected, though, it tasted sort of like a pumpkin apple bread. but very moist. my one complaint is that four cups of pears is A LOT to chop up! i chopped them very finely, next time i may make bigger chunks.

My husband and I really enjoyed this cake. He doesn't even like pears but liked this. It had a very nice flavor and was moist. I left the nuts out of the recipe. I sprinkled powdered sugar on top before serving and it looked very pretty.

This cake was delicious!  The only thing I would watch is the cooking time.  I found that I could have taken the cake out a little sooner.  I added a carmel topping to the cake, and it was a hit.

This was a great way to use up an abundance of pears as another reviewee suggested.  Not very sweet even with ripe pears and 2 cups of sugar so I added a creamy pear brandy icing over my bundt and served it for brunch. Yum.

To us this tasted more like a nut bread than a cake. We ended up slicing it and spreading butter on it to eat. It has great flavor and is very easy to make. I made it exactly as directed except i left out the cloves. Will make it again but will bake it in bread pans.

I'm not sure about the kids, but the adults I made it for love it!  I've passed out the recipe several times already.  Its not too sweet and it is soooo moist,  which I think is the best part.  I skip the pecans, and it is still good.  Once you peel the pears, its all downhill from there.  Basically dump everything in and cook.  I'd say it only took 45 minutes-1 hour including cleanup beginning to end.

I made this cake for Mother's Day and everyone loved it. I used less spices like others suggested and the pear flavor was very prevalent. I also took the suggestion of another reviewer and used 1/3 cup unsweetened applesauce and 1/3 cup canola oil and it turned out great. It was easy to make and very tasty. The reason I'm only giving it 4 stars is because it was way too sweet. I used ripe, sweet pears and 2 cups of sugar proved to be way too much. I would recommend using 1 1/2 or 1 cup of sugar instead of 2 if you don't want it to be extremely sweet. Otherwise, a wonderful recipe. I would love to make this again (with less sugar!)

This was delicious!  Everyone who tried it really liked it as well.  I have never heard of a pear cake before so I had to try it.  I didn't have cloves but based on other reviews I used 1 tsp of nutmeg and ground ginger and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon.  I also put maybe another tsp of freshly grated ginger in with the wet ingredients.  Baking time was spot on.  I also did a sugar "crust" to give it a crispy crunch which I do with most quick breads.   Just put enough granulated sugar to coat the pan after greasing.  Sometimes I do cinnamon sugar but didn't think that would work with this recipe.

I made one change which I don't think matters. I don't like having left over egg yolks, so I bought the egg whites in a carton. Used amount specified for 4 eggs which meant my batter was probably a bit more moist than had I used just egg whites. The only result was to cook for an additional 10 minutes. It was HEAVENLY and a BIG hit at our local Grange pot luck last night. I did not halve the spices and it's what we all liked best about it. It had real PUNCH!

This didn't turn out for me.  Very dense, moist, NOT in a good way.  This could have been because my pears were very ripe, mushy & created a lot of juice while sitting with the sugar.  Perhaps it is better with firm fruit. I'm surprised other reviewers chose to use less spice because I felt it could have used some more to perk up the flavor.  I'd suggest a bit of salt too.

I made this cake for my Dad's birthday and while everyone else really liked it, I thought it was ok. Thought the sugar could be dramatically cut back. Cake needed an extra 8-10 minutes in the oven. Possibly a bit less nutmeg also. That being said, it was enjoyed by all and many had second helpings.

This is a wonderfully moist cake with a lot of flavor.  Great for using up over ripe pears.  A keeper.

I followed the directions exactly, while the taste is good the cake itself is pretty dry. I'm not sure why everyone else's turned out moist but mine is dry as can be? I definately think it's worth trying again with a bit of tweeking.

This was awesome!  We had fresh pears from our pear trees, but I could see using pears or apples as well.  I loved the spice cake feel of it.  We ate it for dessert with ice cream, and for breakfast with cream cheese.

I used fresh pears from our orchard, ginger instead of nutmeg (as recommended) and 1/2 of the recommended cinnamon. I'm at 6000 ft, so I baked it at 350 for 55 minutes. It still tasted like spice cake with pears, but it was moist and delicious.

So delicious! Had some pears that no one was eating so thought try this out.  My picky children devoured them! I did half the cloves & nutmeg as recommended by others. Also, not a fan of bundts so used mini muffins.  Made 48 plus a small loaf.  Freezing some for school lunches & snacks.  This is a keeper!

This was delish!  I followed the recipe exactly as written, except I didn't have pecans, so I used hazlenuts.  I thought the spice level was PERFECT - not too subtle, but not overpowering.  I also baked it for exactly and hour and 10 minutes and it came out perfect.  My house smelled so good when this was baking!  YUM.

The cake was nice.  I followed the recipe exactly but no one was crazy for it.  I was hoping for more pear flavor but felt the spices took center stage.  The pears were from my brother-in-law's trees and they were really ripe when I used them for the cake.  But I'm going to try another pear cake recipe before doing this one again.

Great recipe!  Used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose, substituted ginger for nutmeg and used walnuts instead of pecan.  Turned out fantastic, will definitely make again.  Next time would like to try using less sugar and using applesauce instead of oil.

This turned out pretty good - a little bit soggy in the middle but I think that is the nature of cakes in bundt tins.  Anyway, the only change I made was to add 1 tsp ginger, omit the cloves and cut the cinnamon to 1/2 tsp.  Will make again!

I used applesauce instead of butter/oil and 2 eggs instead of egg whites. It looked great but my mom didn't care for it. My dad said it was pretty good. Nonetheless, not great reviews but it looks nice :)

This cake was good! I was afraid that 2 cups of sugar would be too much, but it came out with the right amount of sweetness. Also, it is spicy, but well balanced. The only change I made was using 2 eggs, instead of 4 egg whites. I'll definitely make this again, thanks for sharing!

This cake is moist and full of flavor.  Reminds me of a fresh apple cake.  The only alterations I made were to used 2 whole eggs instead of 4 egg whites and I omitted the cloves as we don't care for that particular spice.  I will definitely make this one again.

This cake is awesome!  I don't love cake usually at all, but I do really like cakes made with fruit.  I made it as directed and it is moist, spicy, and just all around delicious.  Mixing the pears with sugar and allowing it to sit makes for a lot of liquid.  This is a large cake, but it's very pretty and flavorful.  I sprinkled a bit of confectioner's sugar on top, but it didn't really need it other than to make it look a little prettier.  Thanks!  Will make again.

It was delicious! I added 1 tsp. vanilla as I love vanilla, and I used really ripe pears. It reminds me of banana bread, but even better.

This cake was more like a bread, but absolutely fabulous! I only used 1 1/2 cups of white sugar and cut back on the cloves (used a pinch), used nutmeg & cinnamon as the recipie suggested and it turned out great! My guests loved it and had to give out the recipie three times.

i made this recipe excactly as stated.
it looks good, smells good, but....it did not
turn out at all. i baked the cake for 1h 10 min
and it was still not enough. so i left it in the oven with the heat off. when i finally cut into 
the cake it was like thick bread pudding texture.
i wish it had turned out better.

I initially tried this recipe because my daughter is a vegan and I thought the egg replacer would work well, which it did. She's home from college and requested it for Thanksgiving. Everyone loved it, including Grandma and Grandpa. Of course, they were shocked that it was vegan, "It's so good!"

I made this cake for some of my best friends the day it came up on the internet. They all wanted the receipe. Everyone was so complementary, especially, my neighbor. She is allergic to all dairy products. I finally found something sweet she can have. Thanks so much.

YUMMY!!!  This cake is so good, very moist and doesn't have a "grainy" pear texture.  I only had three bartlett pears and left out the nuts and it turned out fabulous.  I glazed it with a little powdered sugar, milk & a splash of vanilla to dress it up.  Even my friends who said "I don't like pears" loved it.  Will definitely make it again ... soon!

Excellent recipe. I used eggbeater instead of the whole eggs and did them as muffins instead of a cake. It was a big hit, I’ll be making it again. Thanks!

Believe the hype! This recipe is terrific. I used all the most common modifications suggested: I used whole eggs instead of whites and a teaspoon of ginger (which I prefer to nutmeg - but I did add a dash of nutmeg). I also soaked the pears 1 T of dark rum and a tsp of vanilla along with the sugar. I did not add nuts, however, since I was using it for mini bundt cakes. The recipe was exceptional in the bundt cakelet pan. In fact, I used three other recipes from the brand website and this was the only one that worked in all of the cakelet shapes. I was surprised because I thought the pears would throw off the shapes, but they looked great! Lastly, I did use a combination of Bosc pears and Asian, all peeled, and cut no larger than 1/2" pieces. The Asian pears remained a teeny bit firm compared to the others, which gives the cakelets a fantastic texture.

Modified as follows:  no oil, but unsweetened applesauce, two eggs, 1.25 c sugar, 1/4 t cloves (would use even less next time), dozen grinds of fresh nutmeg, and no nuts.  Changes brought down the calories to 241 for 1/12 of a piece.  Very nice, moist cake.  Would make again.  Used ripe pears off the tree.  Also made in a spring form pan, instead of a bundt pan.  Cooked about the same time.

Looking for a recipe to use up all those pears?  Here it is!  Great recipe.  It produced a moist flavorful cake that's perfect for any time of day.  My plan was to make muffins, but the Bundt pan won out.  After reading the reviews I made a few changes.  2 eggs instead of 4 egg whites.  Reduced sugar to 3/4c brown and 3/4 c white.  I think if your pears are really sweet 1 c sugar total would be just fine.  I added 1 tsp ground ginger and left the rest of the spices as is.  This is a great addition to my recipe box!

This cake was lovely made with some pears that were almost over ripe. Served with a small amount of whipped cream on each slice. Can't wait to try it toasted.

Wow, this came out so moist and flavorful.  I used coconut oil instead of the canola, and I only used 1.5 cup sugar. I added a generous tsp of vanilla though. it only took 55 minutes to bake. I will certainly use this recipe again.

I recently received 30 small pears from a friend who has pear trees. This was the perfect recipe. I added dried cranberries to my cakes. It was delicious! It is very moist. I don't have a bundt pan so I used a 10 inch spring form pan, it took under an hour in the convection oven. Thanks for the recipe
update: it freezes well

I was looking for a non-dairy dessert and I've found a winner in this one!  After reading reviews I made some  changes - halved the spices and substituted ginger for the nutmeg, didn't peel the pears, used 1 c. white and 1/2 c. brown sugar, pureed 1/2 of a ripe pear and used it to replace 1/2 of the oil, used 2 eggs instead of 4 whites.  I also skipped the nuts because a dinner guest is allergic.  The resulting cake was loved by all.  It was very moist and delicious.  My baking time turned out to be about 55 minutes.  This will very likely become a staple in my dessert repertoire.

Excellent cake. Had plenty of fresh pears from my neighbor :). I used about 1/2 cup less of sugar and I'm glad I did. Still plenty sweet. Will definitely make this again. Spices are right on the mark.PERFECT!

This is such a good recipe - family loves it! I use only 1 cup rather than 2 of sugar and whole wheat instead of white flour, 1/3 c oil and 1/3 cup applesauce instead of 2/3c oil. Don't have a bundt pan (I have no idea why, My Big Fat Greek Wedding is one of my fave movies ever!) so use 2 loaf pans and reduce cooking time to 1 hr. House smells so good!

Pretty good - my pears were overripe and squishy (Bartlett) and so  the chunks in the cake were a little unappealing. My kids said they looked like pieces of jellyfish, so it was not a big hit with them. Tasted fine though...

I collected 10 pears in my last couple of CSA boxes so I decided that it was cake time! I used 6 whole pears to get a little over 4 cups of chopped pears. My changes to the recipe are: 1) I used only 1 cup of brown sugar. 2) I didn't bother to sift the flour and used cake flour instead. 3) I used olive oil instead of canola oil. 4) I only used a pinch of nutmeg and cloves. 5) I used a 9 X 11 Pyrex dish to bake and it took 50 mins total. Super yummy and super easy. This cake is rather dense so it took a little bit of muscle to pour the stiff batter into the Pyrex dish. Also, it did not rise much after baking. Very filling cake!

My husband and I both really enjoyed this recipe. I halved the recipe and baked it for 1 hour in a loaf pan, since there were only 2 of us. I also used white whole wheat flour, only used half the amount of nutmeg, and added 1/4 tsp (1/2 tsp if you were making the whole recipe) of ground ginger.

Wonderful! I was short on flour so used half whole wheat and it was great!  This will definitely be a regular with us when our pear tree is producing.

Good recipe to start with! I did tweak it a lot, and thought someone else might want to know what worked for me to make a healthy substitute breakfast muffin - halved the sugar, used all white whole-wheat flour, used two whole eggs instead of 4 egg whites, didnt use cloves but halved the nutmeg and added 1/2 teaspoon ginger, only used 1/4 cup oil (coconut), but also added half cup applesauce and one large ripe mashed banana to make up for the decrease in oil and sugar. Finally, added half a cup of greek yogurt (to make it kind of a 'sour cream' cake). I baked into muffins for about 18-20 minutes at 325.

Excellent recipe. I changed a few things like opting to ad ginger with only a wee bit of nutmeg since cloves and cinnamon are strong flavours already. I also added a small bit of grated orange peel. Overall I reduced ingredients by half since I wanted a small cake and went small on sugar too adding some honey to compensate. Turned out rather nice. Many thanks for sharing.

I followed the instructions exactly since it was my first time making it (usually I make the adjustments 2nd time around or so) and after 1h 10m the cake still hadn't cooked thoroughly. :( Major disappointment. Unfortunately I let it sit 10min and dumped it out of the pan onto a rack and part of the side caved in. I dumped it back into my pyrex dish and am going to try and cook it all the way through since the little part that was cooked the first time around tasted pretty good-just won't make for such a great presentation. Maybe I'll try the whole eggs next time to see if they help cook/stick it together better.

This cake is indeed delicious. I have given it 4 stars because it is better with ginger substituted for the nutmeg and because it is more of a loaf or dense coffee cake (due to very thick batter). It is not a traditional dessert type cake, but very delicious nonetheless.

A delicious way to use up some pears I had sitting around!  Very good.  After reading the reviews I substituted the nutmeg for ginger and beat the eggs until they were white and starting to gain a little volume.  Otherwise followed the directions as written.

I loved this cake! I used slivered almonds for the nuts as that's what I had on hand. Also, I was out of ground cloves, so I substituted pumpkin pie spice. The cake was fabulous! It was really light and yummy. One other note - the recipe says to beat the egg whites a little. I made this cake twice, and my suggestion is to beat the egg whites until they are about double their size and still foamy. That's how I did the 2nd cake and it turned out better. Also, I used self-rising flour. Everything turned out great!

Like another reviewer, I, too, cut the sugar in half to 1 cup because I had very ripe pears.  It still turned out perfectly sweet and delicious.  Didn't have pecans, but that was fine.  As a busy mom, I also didn't take the time to peel the pears.  The skin shrivels up when it bakes anyway, and no one, especially my 5 and 3-year-old, noticed or cared.  It's really loaded with pears in every bite and is light and moist.  Very delicious.  Don't know why the recipe would call for 2 cups of sugar.

This was tasty and moist. It's more like a bread than a cake to me. I kept it in the refrigerator so that it would stay fresher longer. I didn't have any cloves in the house, so I used a teaspoon of ginger instead.  It was a great way to use my leftover pears!

As is, it was too sweet for me, and i also thought it was still too high in fat. By changing the flour to whole wheat flour, cutting the sugar in half, cutting the oil in half and adding 1/3 cup of milk it turned out to be a 5 star recipe, and it stayed moist for days (which never seems to happen when I bake a cake)

My husband hated it. Should have used eggs and not only whites. Turned out too moist.

This turned out more crumbly than I would have liked and we didn't eat much of it, threw it away after a few days.

Easy to put together and very tasty.  I love how my house smells when this is baking.  I love it with fresh whipped cinnamon cream on top.

I made some alterations to this recipe. I had a lot of pears, so I ended up with 9 cups of pears. I added 4 1/2 cups of flour, and I used 2/3 Extra Virgin Coconut oil, instead of canola oil, and I also added 1/2 cup coconut cream. We are trying to give our daughter healthier foods to eat. Coconut oil and coconut cream provides a lot of nutrients similar to breat milk, and it also give a person "quick" energy, like chocolate, without the sugar, so it is great for all people, and the taste and flavor you just cannot beat!!!

I also added raisins instead of nuts because our daughter likes raisins better than nuts.

This cake is absolutely delicious!!!

Thanks.

This is wonderful!! The only thing I did differently was that I used 2 whole eggs instead of the egg whites..didn't have any cloves, so I just left them out--Still DELICIOUS!! My husband does not eat pears, but loved this cake!!

Sooo very good, I was scared because of the "fruit cake" description some people gave of it.  But this was delicious and just like apple cakes I've had except with pears.  Thank You for sharing and I can't wait to have it again!

Follow the recipe.  Do not sub egg whites for whole eggs!  It makes a big difference.  Use the almond filling in recipe box, for the yolks.

I didn't really care for this cake.  It was very dense; definitely more like a fruit bread than a cake.  I did cut back the oil to 1/3 and added a 1/3 of applesauce--maybe that accounted for some of the denseness (?).  You will need to cook it for the entire time if you're using a bundt pan.  And I would not cut back on the sugar at all--in fact I made a glaze because I thought it needed something else (1 cup of confectioners sugar and 2 TB milk and vanilla).  But I doubt my kids will eat it even with the glaze... so this one will probably be passed out to the neighbors.

I made this for a bar-b-que, and had to come home and make another one, it was that good and went that fast!  The only modification I made was to substitute almonds for the pecans.

I'd never had a pear cake before.  The taste was very good, but the texture was "different".  My husband said it was alright, but some of the ladies at work loved it.  I followed the instructions to the letter.  It is definately a "fruitcake" persons cake.  I'd probably make it again.

I cut the sugar by half and it is still sweet.  Overall, this cake has a weird texture, kind of reminds me of a fruit cake.  Sorry, won't make it again.

We loved this recipe. It was moist, and very tasteful. Added half the spices except the cinnamon as suggested by others, and thought it would have been good with the full amount as well. Baking time for me was exactly as noted. Will defintely use again.

I followed everyone's suggestion and cut back on the spices--I still found it to be too much spice flavor, not enough pear flavor.  Also, mine was well done in 40 minutes.

This cake was great, I used other people's suggestions and used less of the spices and omitted the cloves completely and it was great.  The only thing I had a problem with is that the next day, the bread was a bit soggy.. maybe because of the juices from the pears??  however, the flavor was excellent!

The cake was tooo sweet, almost like a  syrop taste. The amount of suggested nutmeg is way too much and the sugar as well. It was a waste of good pears. sorry.

This was absolutely delicious.  I didn't change a thing.  I signed up today because I just wanted to comment on this recipe.  My husband and I were wishing we had used our first batch of pears this way.  Next pear season we'll do it again.  I print out and try recipes from this site and others all of the time.  When we are real happy it goes into a sheet protector and put in our folder.  Thanks Barbara.  This is a winner.

I followed this recipe exactly, using some pears given to us by our landlords, and the cake turned out quite well.  The taste was a tad too spicy & the texture was too heavy for my liking - it seemed to be more like a spicy bread than a cake.

It is kind of like gingerbread with pear chunks.. very yummy. Tips:  I used a mixer on low speed for a minute or two to break down the pear chunks a bit. Also, it was still a little moist after baking, so I added 10-15 minutes cooking time.

This recipe was great!  My parents and brothers all loved it, although none of them had ever had a pear cake before.  I think the recipe might be better though if the pears are processed or mashed into an applesauce-like consistency because although it's tasty, the cake seemed more like spice cake with pear chunks. I didn't put nuts in at all, as I'm obviously not a fan of such chunky cakes, and it turned out just fine.  I also went easy on the nutmeg and cloves. Either way, I think this is a keeper.

For a change I followed the recipe, but it could have been baked another 10 min. or so.  Very moist "spice-type" of cake.  Makes a large cake, I froze half of it.

This was a sure pleaser for darling fiance. I made a few adjustments and used what I had in the pantry. I used 1/2 t of all spice instead of cloves and I chopped up the toffe covered peanuts instead of using pecans. And the final adjustment was that I used a tube pan instead of a bundt pan. The cake still came out wonderful! The smell was so heavenly as it baked. This is a real keeper. I never knew pears can be incorporated into a cake!

To take advantage of our abundant pear harvest this year, I decided to try this recipe. My 6 year old son helped bake it and we made a  nut-free muffins version for him, too.  It was moist & delicious. Much like apple cake, only better. This one is getting added to my recipe box!

This cake is so moist, not too sweet and yet flavorful.  I'm thinking of trying it with pears and apples next time.  I made the cake last night and it's more than half gone already so I guess that will be soon. It's an incredibly easy recipe once the fruit is prepared. This one is a keeper!!

I loved this! I hate when people don’t try the original recipe the first time....but I grated in about a teaspoon of fresh ginger, and I added my newest obsession-cardamom. I also used chopped walnuts because it was all I had. It was fantastic!

This Pear cake is nice but the clove over powers the pear flavor.  I will make it again but will not include the clove.

This is a thick heavy cake, reminds me more of banana bread.

I am one of those terrible people who reviews a recipe after changing it from the original. But hear me out! The changes I made are not ones that would affect the chemical composition of the batter or anything.
I made it for my kids who don’t like nuts, so I left out the pecans, and subbed vanilla (1tsp) and almond (1/2 tsp) extracts for all the spices. I also didn’t have vegetable oil in the house so I used melted butter for the fat. The finished cake is so beautiful and delicious.

I made it exactly according to the recipe. After baking at 325 for 1h10m, and letting it sit for 10m, I flipped it out of the bundt pan and... it was raw in the middle! I put it back in the pan, turned the oven up to 350, and baked it for another 35 minutes. At that point, it was bedtime and I left it on the stove top until the AM. I decided not to try turning it out of the pan at this point, but the end product WAS quite tasty, if not exactly pretty :)

I followed the advice of several reviews and cut the spices in half, except for the cinnamon. My pears were very sweet so I used only one cup of sugar. I baked it it an angel food cake pan and found that an hour was about 5 minutes too long. It was very good. Next time I’ll chop up the pears smaller.

I will definitely make it again! I used 5 pears and cut back a little on the sugar. Used chunky applesauce in place of oil, had to use 2 loaf pans because I couldn't find my bundt pan but other than that kept it the same as the recipe stated. It was amazing!!

Awesome recipe.  I switched out ginger for the cloves as I didn't have ground cloves. Excellent use for the egg whites I had left over from making gelato and the fact that it's fall and I have a million pears.  Great flavor and texture.

I fixed a couple of foibles in the recipe and the end result was quite tasty. Specifically I made it with 100% whole wheat flour and included 4 whole eggs, not just the whites. I really like the balance of the spices and the texture of the pear and pecans adds interest to the spice cake. I didn't have a bundt pan so I just made it in a normal square pan which worked out fine.

Made this today with fresh pears from our tree,  DELICIOUS and so easy to prepare.   I left out the cloves, and added 1 teaspoon of fresh minced ginger to the wet mixture.   Otherwise, I followed the recipe to a T.  Baked perfectly,  came right out of bundt pan perfectly.   Wonderful, most cake.

Made 2 batches, then 2 more the next day with the bumper crop of pears. Added extra pear for average of 1.5 lbs of chopped per per batch. BF really likes the surprise bites of pear chunks. Since I'm not crazy about "spice" cakes, I skipped the  clove and I cut back on nutmeg. Used 1/2t ginger, and 1/2 t nutmeg.  This is a keeper!
For an extra attractive cake, I made a vanilla glaze. Received 3 unsolicited compliments for the tasty cake at a large family reunion.
July 2019 update: Made recipe 6 times. One recipe can make (6) mini loaf pans or (2) regular loaf. Just adjust the bake time.

This is a fabulous recipe. Everyone loved it. I cut the sugar back to 1 1/4 cups and it was still sweet enough. I'll be making this again. I heated a little cream cheese frosting (from a can) and drizzled it over the cake.

I made this for a church pot luck last week. It was so fabulous, I am making it again for a friend’s birthday!  I did cut back the sugar to 1 1/2 cups, and it was sweet and moist and full of flavor!

I had 5 pears and it was enough. I used slightly more than half of the spices and it wasn't too much, as i didn't want spice cake either.  This is an excellent recipe!  I will make again and use a glaze icing next time.

I used pears I received for Christmas & it came out super!  It's like a spice cake with pears & pecans.  I was able to get some fresh pecans from a local grower which helped make it great!  I plan to make another one for New Year's Eve!

This was outstanding with the changes I made.  I used two whole eggs and melted butter instead of egg whites and canola oil.  I reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups.  I used 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, 1 heaping teaspoon nutmeg, and 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg.  (Without nutmeg and with all the cinnamon, it will taste like apple cake, not pear cake.)

It was delicious and my whole family loved it.

If I make this cake again I will add only the cinnamon.  The spices are overwhelming.  I would also use 1 cup of oil instead of 2/3.

I didn't have nutmeg, so I used allspice.  Apparently, didn't matter because this cake was outstanding.  Crispy outside, moist inside - the perfect marriage.  My family and friends behaved as though it were the final dessert before world's end!  Oh, I topped it with cream cheese frosting.

Delicious! I made this and took it to a potluck and everyone raved about it. 
I started making this at night and realized I didn't have the ingredients. I had already put the pears and sugar together so I put them in the fridge overnight. I finished the recipe the next day and it the pause didn't seem to make much difference.

I made this cake yesterday. It is very good. I substituted Splenda sugar blend at the proper ratio and used one cup of coconut flower to replace 1 of the cups of flour. My husband is diabetic and the substitutions make the recipe slightlyl less carbs for  him. He can have a little peice every now and then if he leaves off a bread or starch at his meal. He love it by the way. 
Family visiting our farm today   loved it also. I am freezing some of the rest of the cake and I am sure it will freeze well. It is very close to the same recipe I use with apples.
I will make this cake again

This was a pretty good cake but I found it  dense.   I used fresh pears but the taste of the pears was subtle rather than as strong as I was expecting.

I made this and it had such great texture and taste!  Perfect combination of spices.  I substituted coconut oil instead of canola oil with no real affect.   I also made an icing drizzle using 1 cup of confectioners sugar, 1 tsp vanilla, and 2 T triple sec (instead of water or milk) and it worked great with this!

I turned this recipe into muffins and they are amazing! Using the extra large muffin tins I baked at 350 for 45 minutes.  It will make XL 10 muffins. I also sprinkled a few walnuts on top with a bit of cinnamon sugar. They muffins are so moist and look like they came from a bakery. This is a definite keeper recipe for me.

The cake was absolutely delicious. I did not have any nutmeg nor ginger,  so put only cinnamon for spices, and it still turned out very good. Also, as suggested by other bakers, put only one cup of  sugar and that was perfect for our liking.

A very moist cake which was easy to make.  I iced it, as it seemed a bit too plain without a topping.  It is similar in texture and taste to carrot cake.

This was an excellent recipe! I did cut the sugar in half, using brown sugar because that's all I had. I may have added 5 cups of pears, not exactly sure because I just eye balled it ??. Soooo good! Will definitely make this cake again!

This is a great recipe. Next time I might use less ground cloves.
Some family members thought it was too strong, but otherwise
delicious! It was a new spice container, that might have been it
also!
Baking time was on point and it was crispy on the outside and moist inside. I will certainly make this again.

This is a seriously delicious cake! Got lots of wonderful Harry and David pears for Christmas and couldn't eat them all, but didn't want them to go to waste. Found this recipe and the reviews convinced me to try it. So glad I did. After reading the other reviews, I substituted ginger for the cloves. I also left out the nuts because I don't like nuts in my cakes. The other thing I did was used half the oil and then used apple sauce for the other half. I do this with most of my baking to cut down on the calories. It came out perfect! It took exactly an hour and 10 minutes, and it was moist and flavorful. A huge hit! I will definitely be making this again!

I had to stop eating processed sugar and this is the first real cake I have managed to make for myself in years! I substituted coconut palm sugar for the other sugars and turned out spectacularly. Like the others, mine baked perfectly in an hour.

This is delicious! I'll make it again and I recommend it. The only change I made was I put in 1/2 tsp nutmeg and cloves but the full tsp of cinnamon.  Just a personal preference.

Very good cake.  I read all the reviews and decided to cut the nutmeg and clove in half, and I'm glad I did.  I didn't want to make a spice cake, I wanted to make a fresh pear cake.  I did soak the pears in sugar for the full hour and I think that is the way to go.  Everything remained the same.  This cake is very moist and super delicious.  I will make this again.

Made this with extra pears and it was fantastic.  Big hit with the family and more flavorful than I expected.  The only variation I did was not to peel the pears.  The skins get very soft when baking and it adds more flavor.  Made it in a cut bundt pan and it turned out beautiful.

Very yummy. Following advice of others, cut sugar in half for personal preference (and used half brown, half white), and the whole egg. Half the recipe made 12 cupcakes (baked for 18 minutes). Topped w cream cheese frosting (but loved it without frosting, too).

great flavor and loved the spice combination with the pears.  I modified a bit by substituting apple sauce for the oil and used the entire egg instead of just egg whites and skipped the pecans.  Definitely will make again.  will try pecans in the next batch.  Yummy!

I made no changes because I like to make recipe as directed the first time so I will know how to adapt the flavors for us. I used Harry & David Royal Riviera pears because i had them and needed to use them up. Before prepping I had read many of the reviews to get a sense of the  ease of preparing and the balance of flavors. I had read I believe it was several reviews that referred
to it as "spice cake". I have to say I didn't find it all overbearing in the combination of spices; in fact. I will increase the cinnamon and add nutmeg next time I make it. I will continue to make it as it is a delightfully moist cake.

This cake turned out moist and flavorful.  I took a few liberties with the original recipe such as reducing the sugar to 1 1/2 cups (maybe reduce it more, depending on the pears), decreasing the amount of nutmeg, and adding 1/2 tsp. ground ginger.  The pears I used were ripe and large (3 pears = 4 cups).  I baked it for 60 minutes and it was perfect.  This cake was served at a friend's house and everyone loved it.  Great dessert for autumn!

Delicious!!!..my first ever ever cake from scratch. I made two!!!!!!! Took them both to celebrate mom's birthday and they were gone, any left overs were taken by the guest..  i did not use any ginger (didn't have any) and used 2whole eggs instead of 4 egg whites.  I read a review where someone did this since they could never figure out what to do with the left over egg and so I did the same. I also sprayed the bundt pan and sprinkled brown sugar and cinnamon (again following other reviewers directions). The results were great..I will do it again.  I took a piece home and put in ziplock bag placed in fridge and had it with coffe 6 days later. It was still super delicious. My daughter said we should always have this cake/bread in the house.

This cake was extremely sweet.  I will look for another recipe that uses less sugar and less oil.

I have made this cake 14 times in the last two weeks. I followed the recipe exactly. No need to make any changes.  It has been a big hit with family and co-workers

My family really liked this recipe. I used half whole-wheat flour, and substituted chopped walnuts for the pecans (as I didn't have any on hand). Very tasty!

I made 3 of these. I ran short of pears on the third one so I substituted some apples to go with the pears. I also ran short of nuts so I tossed in some almonds with my pecans.  I baked for 1:05 and they were all perfect.

O.M.G.this cake is so delicious I didn't have any pears
so I used two diced apples and made a glaze for over the top.
Will make it again using pears.
Thanks Helene

I made this cake but am not a fan of nutmeg & cloves so I only added the cinnamon.   You need to make sure you let the pears & sugar sit for an hour before adding them to the other ingredients or you will have problems with the cake being dry.  I will make this again.

Added a little bourbon to the pears and sugar ... otherwise no other changes.  Wonderfully moist!  Would be great for breakfast or dessert.

This was moist and delicious!  I used slightly less sugar and 2 whole eggs and one egg white.  The batter is very wet, but when baked, it came out perfectly!

Delicious!  I didn't have cloves in the house, so just used pumpkin pie spice for all except the cinnamon.  Also, halved the sugar because the pears were so sweet.  The cake is moist and delicious.

Thus was my first pear bread and it was delicious. Baked up nicely and tasted great. Would be awesome as brunch, coffee cake, or less sweet desert cake with a drop of real whip cram on it. Yummy!

My husband and I had picked a couple bags of pears at the local orchard, so I needed to use them and decided to try this recipe! WOW! This recipe is very moist and sweet (no frosting needed!) and low cholesterol. I received so many compliments and everyone wanted the recipe!  I will be making this again and again.

I made the recipe as written.  The only thing I'd have liked included with this recipe is a frosting.  I ended up making a cream cheese frosting.

Once again Allrecipes did not disappoint. I've never left a review before, but I love Allrecipe recipes. took this cake to work, everyone loved it. I thought 2 cups of sugar was a lot, so I did 1C white and 1/2 C brown. Very tasty. I'm sure made with apples would be just as good.

this 5 star is for the smell while it is baking :) if it tastes as good as the smell we have a winner! 
I doubled the recipe but put 3 cups of sugar and used 5 whole eggs instead of white only and omited the cloves because I didnt have any. # I have made this 3 times now and it is awsome! Great autum taste!

Pears must be in season here in Guatemala, and friends have been blessing us with an overabundance of them, and I could not figure out how to use them up. So I made this cake today. It is delicious!  I cut down on the cloves and nutmeg a little and did not understand about mixing the pears and sugar and letting it sit for an hour until I actually did it and saw all of the liquid it created.  My husband loves it, so this will be my go to with our next gifting of pears.

Easy, amazing and wonderful with tea or coffee!  I added a few extra pears, about six cups total and a little more cinnamon. I also beat my egg whites until they were a little frothy but still clear.  I used a cream cheese butter frosting but went light on the sugar in the frosting.  Don't go heavy on the frosting.  The cake is amazing alone and the frosting is just to add a contrasting flavor. The whole family loved it and one son suggested we make it for Christmas morning since it was so easy, delicious and beautiful!

I took other reviewer's advice and cut the sugar in half, which worked out to be the perfect level of sweetness for me. I also substituted half of the oil with pureed pear. The spices were perfect as is.
I cut the recipe in half and baked it in a 8" square pan for 35 minutes.

This recipe was fantastic! I made two cakes, one in a bundt cake pan and one in cheesecake pan.  The one in cheesecake pan took a lot longer to bake but I arranged pear slices on the bottom of the pan and it came out very pretty.  This was definitely one of the best and easiest cake I've baked. Thanks!

I've been making this cake regularly as it's a hit in our house. It even adapts to gluten free (all purpose and oat) flours very nicely.

I made this with a few of the suggestions...I used 2 eggs instead of 4 whites and I used ginger instead of nutmeg because I didn't have any.  My family loved this.  I also sprinkled cinnamon/sugar in the bundt pan & when I flipped it some stuck.  I waited the 10 minutes before flipping but might try longer next time?  Delicious & a great way to use up some pears that would have otherwise gone to waste.

Made this last night with some pears that I had that were going bad. I subbed out the nuts and added some frozen cranberries as we have a nut allergy in the house. I made it into mini loaves so that I could hand them out and it was delicious. I would like to try the advice of another to remove the nutmeg, use ginger and then add in crystalized ginger chuncks....that I think would be amazing! Thank you!

I made this for someone else and did not get a chance to taste it.  I can only go on their review which was glowing!  The gave it a 10 on a scale of 1-10.  I'm just sorry I didn't get the chance to taste it myself, but that's how it goes when you give food as a gift!

Everyone loved it!  I left the spices as is.  I cut down the sugar to 1.5 cups and used coconut oil instead of canola.  The second time I made it, it did stick in the pan - so just make sure to coat the pan!

Oh this was really delicious! I had a load of pears ripening quickly from apple and pear picking this month, what to do I thought! Well I made this cake, I was very simple, and delicious. I have to say I did not use cloves, but a spekulaas spice (Dutch spice mix) and cinnamon. It was sweet and I did not use any frosting or icing etc. Sweet enough with out it really. In fact I might cut the sugar a bit next time but over all it was super!

This was delicious! I had to make some slight changes to the recipe because I didn't have a couple of items but it still turned out great! Instead of a bundt pan I used a 9x13 pan and watched the clock after 50 minutes but it also seemed to finish around the one hour and ten minutes mark. I ended up using about 1 1/2 cups of pears and 1/2 cup of apples because I ran out of pears. Like I said, it still turned out and I plan to make this again in the future!

This cake is awesome and great for breakfast or anytime of the day. My mother love the cake and that says a lot. I will be making two more this week while there is still pears on the tree for the holidays and freeze them. This cake is so easy to make. I use only a half teaspoon of ground clove instead of the 1 teaspoon and it was just right. will let you know how the freezing go.

This was great!  I read reviews, took some suggestions, and made scrumptious cupcakes that I shared with a group, my kids, and my extended family - and they all loved it too!  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for a family gathering tonight and got rave reviews. Cut the spices slightly, added some ginger, and cut the sugar by 1/2 c. I also added a vanilla glaze from this site. Perfect. Served warm with vanilla ice cream.

The cake itself was good and definitely suited my needs since I had a dozen pears that needed to be used up. Unfortunately, I just wasn't a fan.

I used pears from my pear tree. Most years it didn't put out much. This year, it woke up and gave us many.  This recipe is so very good. I added applesauce in place of part of the oil. I used 1.5c. splenda and 1/4c. sugar and 1/8c. of splenda brown sugar blend.  1/2 wheat flour, and 1/2 all purpose flour. It turned out VERY good. I'm going to make this again. I put a little glaze over the top too.

This cake was moist, flavorful and not too sweet.  The only change I made to the recipe was adding 1/2 tsp of nutmeg instead of 1 tsp, and 1/2 tsp ginger.  It probably should have baked a little longer but it still turned out well.

This cake turned out wonderful. It was more like a bread, and I will be making it again next pear season!

Great way to use up an abundance of pears. Good cake.
