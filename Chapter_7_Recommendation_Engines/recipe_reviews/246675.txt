This was so simple to make and so tasty.  I found the grated apple a little moist so I just julienned.  This will definitely be a regular in our house.  Absolutely delicious.  Try it and see.

This salad is so good. I used honey crisp apples, added an extra two teaspoons of maple syrup, and put it over kale to make it a meal.

I made this for a baby shower-it was the hit of the shower! (I didn't grate the apples, I diced them)

nice textures, great tasting, quick to prepare, easily transported to friend's house, complimented the main course, and people enjoyed it. I did chop rather than grate apple, modified the dressing to taste, with addition of sugar and more salt
