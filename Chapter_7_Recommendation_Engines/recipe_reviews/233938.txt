This was delicious! I made a couple of changes this time. Our local Thai place uses ground beef so I used that. I put 6 tablespoons of the sauce in the ground beef after is was cooked and cooled a little. Lime juice gets bitter if you heat it too much. For the sauce, the only change I made was I added and extra teaspoon of Sriracha per recipe. I doubled the entire sauce recipe because we like extra. I added thinly sliced red onion and cucumbers to the salad. Tasted just like the restaurant dish!

Made exactly as written. This was very good but was missing something. I'll make it again.

No changes, but I'm sorry to say the flavor wasn't nearly as tasty as I was hoping.

the recipe is great! The basil was a bit overpowering, next time I'll add a 1/4 cup. The dressing was pretty salty, I'll add 2x the sugar to balance it. Overall, it was a great base! We loved it! Definitely spicy, and we love it! It's a very refreshing, summer salad for spice lovers!

very good and easy.   I added some red onion, cucumbers and had rice noodles on the side for anyone who wanted to add these.   It would have been good without the additions but I just wanted to add a few more flavors.
