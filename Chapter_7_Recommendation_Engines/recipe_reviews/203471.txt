This recipe is an absolute treasure for any caraway/rye lover.  I've never made crackers before and it should go without saying that the final product depends on how thick you roll them and how long you bake them.  Mine were all over the board.  I rolled the first batch too thick and they turned out dense and heavy with an almost cookie like texture.  The thinner I rolled them, the crispier the wafer.  The longer I baked them, the crispier the wafer.  In all honesty, I actually preferred them a little dense.  The caraway flavor stood out more compared  to those that were cripsy and made for an irresistible snack.

I'd actually rate this about 4.5 but that option wasn't available.  I used olive oil, ww flour for the white, 1/2 the salt called for, I didn't have onion  or garlic powder so I squeezed in two or three nice size cloves of garlic.  I needed more water as well.  After rolling it out I put my pepper mill on as course as it would go and ground lots of pepper on top then gently rolled the rolling pin over it to push the black pepper in.   Baking took a little longer.  yummy and the pepper goes especially well with cheese.

Great recipe!  I like the way the onion, garlic, and caraway combine for flavor.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is definitely a keeper!  It took me a few tries to get the hang of how to handle the dough but once I started to get the hang of it, they were looking better and better.  It's tricky to get them thin but they're better if they are thin. Thank you!

I have made these twice now and we love them. I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't use the caraway seed, because I  don't care for it . This was the first time I ever made crackers. Today I had to add a litttle more water, will be making these many more times.

Loved these!  I tried to roll the dough through my pasta machine, but the dough was just too dry and I couldn't get it to work.  I rolled by hand as thin as I could.  These were very good - thanks!

I found that the crackers were a little doughy, had no snap. Is this what others have found, I even baked for an extra 5 minutes elevated on a cooling rack, in order to circulate the the air in the oven. Easiest way to spread dough is put it in-between two sheets of parchment paper, roll it out as thin as you want, transfer crackers and parchment paper onto baking sheet.

PERFECT!  We loved the caraway flavor!  No changes were needed and the timing was perfect.  I made three different sizes to fit the shapes of the cheeses we are using.  I did sprinkle them with salt as we enjoy our crackers salty.  This was the first time I had ever made crackers and I really enjoyed the new experience.   Thank you BigShotsMom for sharing your PERFECT recipe!

As a Rye/caraway junkie these hit the spot.  I did make them small, like the Wheat Thins you buy so got about 70 crackers.  Very easy.

Recipe has lots of room for variations. Can use different herbs & spices, make them salty or sweet, thick or thin. I used 1 cup rice flour, 1 cup all purpose, coconut oil & canola oil totalling 1/3 cup, no caraway or honey, a pinch of dill, basil and coriander and sprinkle cracked pepper on some. I found I needed to add more water than the recipe calls for and would cut the salt in 1/2. Overall, these were tasty.

Not sure how they were supposed to come out but I got four 1/8" thick uncohesive blobs of dough.

This is my recipe and for those unable to achieve a crisp cracker I remind you the thinner you roll them the better the result.  Also, if necessary, they can be made crispier by reducing the temperature after baking, to 275F and letting them remain in the oven for additional time as necessary.

35 years ago I ate at a seafood restaurant in San Leon . They served rye crackers made by Lance with the Shrimp salad I ordered. Can't find the crackers in the store & it is only recently I decided to try looking here! Bingo! I used King Arthur's perfect rye flour which is a blend of white rye, med. rye, pumpernickel & their unbleached bread flour. I also added some of their Deli Rye Flavors, I used Mrs. Dash in place of salt, & left out the honey as I'm diabetic. I did use the caraway seeds, the onion & garlic powders. I rolled them as thin as possible & baked them a couple of minutes longer. They came out so flavorful & crisp. I cut them more narrow than in the picture & I came out with about 70 crackers. Thanks to BigShotsMom for a great recipe. I think I would like to try this with some other seasonings too. Like some dill seeds & maybe a pinch of minced dill, or perhaps add a bit of ground flax to the flour and/or a bit of crushed flax seeds on the top., They're better than the Lance crackers!

Love these crunchy, flavourful crackers! Not too dry or too moist and great with cream cheese or on their own.

I've had the 'doughy' problem with crackers as well. I solved it after the crackers are baked normally, by putting them in a 200 - 225 degree oven (lower in my convection) until they dry out all the way through. This gets them crisp without over baking/browning. I use this same technique to make crostini brushed with olive oil and herbs... gets them nice and dry all the way through without burning.

I just made with 10 total ingredients (I added cracked pepper) what the big-brand bakeries make with twice as many.  It is great to know what is in my food, without ingredients I do not understand.  This recipe is versatile and can be used as the basis for tons of other types of crackers.  Definite imagination-starter of a recipe!

I formed a roll and just sliced them.  These were really good warm out of the oven. I ate several at once.

I make a favorite rye bread, so I modified this recipe some to match.   2 tsp caraway and 1 tsp fennel. Dropped the honey and used molasses instead. Uses the juices of two oranges, then added water in 1 Tbl spn until the dough was workable by hand; about 4. I rolled it out between 2 pieces of parchment.  Then cut diamonds. While slightly warm after baking, shook them in a zip lock bag with salt, then back on the racks to cool. Yummy with cheddar and some red wine.

I believe this could be a five star rating all across if the author would add a foot note that this cracker can be baked an additional 5-10 minutes at 250 degrees if needed to make crispy. I've made this several times and always let it bake additional minutes at lower heat to ensure a crispy cracker. Give it a try this way because this is a delicious cracker!

I rolled them very thin, followed recipe closely . . . cooked them five minutes longer and they are doughy.   I had to add about 1/8 cup of water to get the dough to come together.   They have a great flavor and I will try again.
