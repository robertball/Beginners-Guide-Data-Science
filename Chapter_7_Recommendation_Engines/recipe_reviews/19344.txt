I was sceptical using cottage cheese and sorry to say....it really does not belong in an italian dish.  Fresh Ricotta cheese is really the best bet or from a super market is still better than cottage cheese. Ricotta cheese has a different flavor than cottage cheese.  It is slightly sweeter and not salty like cottage cheese. With the sausage, mozzerella and parmesean you don't need any more salt.  One suggestion, instead of sugar in the sauce add 1/4 of a finely chopped carrot to counter act any acidity from the tomato sauce.  If you are looking for less fat, they make ricotta in that form too.

this was so good but not enough sauce.   Used Ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese and doubled cheeses ricotta and mozz to make it more gooey. I adjusted according to prev reviews.  replace sugar with 2 tsp ground carrot (thanks for the tip) - also replaced pork sausage with mild Italian sausage.  I doubled everything but noodles and tripled onions/garlic/parsley/oregano.  only used 4 eggs.   For added flavor I a whole chopped green pepper.  also added the garlic when meat was browning this seems to really release the flavor.  Did not use any salt because all the cheeses are salty enough - this was a good move, it turned out perfect.  will make this many more times - thanks Craig!!   PS - This sause is great on pizza too!

This freezes really well too but whenever i freeze dishes with tomato sauce, I find that i need to add just a little bit (small can) of sauce before cooking.  just add to sides and it will work it's way down.  the little extra can of sauce will help to moisten it up and bring back some of the tomato flavor which seems to go away when frozen.   you can freeze whole or cook the lasagna, cool, cut into serving sizes and freeze individual serving  :)

I made this for my family and it was great, the best ziti recipe I have tried. 

4 stars instead of 5 because this recipe really should be written that you need a layer of sauce on the bottom of the pan before the first layer of pasta, or the first layer will be really dry. The cheese between layers will keep any sauce from getting to the pasta on the bottom.

This is the best lasagna we have ever had! And my BFF is Italian! Lol! The only changes I made were to add a layer of the sauce to the bottom like another review recommended. Make it a BIG can of tomato sauce. And use a little bit more cottage cheese. It makes the sauce spread out better and makes it goes farther as you make layers! And enjoy! Thanks to whoever posted this recipe!

This is very yummy.
I did have a few problems though. First, I thought it had too much of a tomatoey taste in the sauce so I added some carrot based on some of the other reviews, but it still had that tomato taste so I added a few teaspoons of brown sugar.
Second, I wasn't sure about the parsely. It says 1 TBSP, but I didn't know if only 1/2 tbsp was to go into the sauce and the other 1/2 was to go into the ricotta mixture. I ended up putting it all into the sauce and just put extra into the cheese sauce and it turned out fine.
Third, I doubled up on the sauce and used it all for the lasagna and wished I had left some over for extra sauce. I thought I would have plenty, but I didn't and I had doubled this.
4th, I used about the same amount of salt that the recipe called for and it tasted fine to me. Many people thought it was way too salty. 
Some changes I made were: I sauteed onion and garlic in olive oil before adding the ground beef. I only used ground beef. Then added extra garlic and onion to the tomato sauce because we love garlic. For the cheese sauce I used ricotta and shredded parmesan cheese. I think the grated parmesan might make it too salty.
It was a time consuming recipe, but very very good. I wish I had some sauce left over.
It's very cheesy and I will make it again using my changes and possibly making sure that I have enough sauce left over.

YUM!  What a fantastic recipe. My picky husband even LOVED it.  FYI...top it with mozerella cheese and bake 15 min. longer so it's not runny.

I loved this recipe, with a few changes. Based on previous reviews I made a little more sauce, used 1/8 cup minced carrots instead of sugar, and reduced the salt. I think cottage cheese is a wonderful replacement for the traditional ricotta, and (to really freak out you traditionalists), I use swiss cheese instead of mozzarella- a trick I picked up from my mother-in-law. It gives a major flavor boost.

This is a wonderful recipe!  It is easy to make and everyone loves it.  I have made it three times now and each time I used all ground beef instead of the pork.  I also don't put double noodle layers, I do it with three single noodle layers.  It is the best!

I made this for Valentines day the nigt before. I substituted Ricotta for cottage cheese, only used a couple dashes of salt in both the sauce and cheese mix, and used one pound italian sausage instead of the beef/pork combo. Baked it for thirty minutes covered, 5 uncovered, then let it cool and put it in the fridge. The next day I came home from work, put it in the oven for about thirty to forty five minutes at 275 (upped it half way to 350- Hubby was hungry) and served. 
They always say Lasagna's better the next day!

Way toooooo much salt, cut the salt content by at least half. Couldn't taste to much of the flavour of the meal as it was too salty. Will try it again though with the less salt.

I'm stuffed!  I made this lasagna for dinner tonight and now it is sitting on my counter, cooling, to put in the fridge.  However, it is so yummy that I take a bite every time I walk through the kitchen!  I can't say that I've made hundreds of lasagna recipes before, but out of the ones I have made, this is definitely the best.  My kids loved it, and my husband, who is usually casual about his lasagna eating, devoured his three servings!

This is a really good recipe but instead of just using cottage cheese I use cottage cheese and ricotta cheese it blends well and leaves the lasagna with a truly urban taste... i also pre-season my hamburger

I have made this twice now.  The first time it came out way too salty and the second was perfect.  Don't add ANY extra salt to the cottage cheese mixture.  It's naturally salty enough from the parm and cottage.

I'm used to cottage cheese in my lasagna as that's how my mom made it. Some find Ricotta to dry and pasty(like my boyfriend), but I don't mind it.    I actually double the cheese by mixing the cottage and ricotta together to get the both of best worlds and mix fresh oregano in it with the other mentioned ingredients(except salt).  I also double the sauce as well because the cheese and meat kinda soaks it up.  Added some tomato paste and extra sugar into the sauce to take away the tang (taste it before putting it on the lasagna!).

Delicious!  I put fresh spinach in each layer & use ricotta cheese instead of the cottage cheese mix.  A great basic homeade lasagna, have fun & add other layers like veggies, mushrooms, etc.

I see that some of the other cooks suggested using carrot rather than sugar. I suggest using some dried sweet basil(leaves)-about 3. You can also use chopped basil. If using basil leaves,remove from sauce after simmering. Oh,and it's much better with ricotta

Great "bones" to start off lasagna, but I will use ricotta cheese next time instead of the cottage cheese mixture, other than that, I wouldn't change a thing!

Delicious recipe that the playoff party quests enjoyed.  I like my lasagna a little less cheesy and a little more meaty.  Just a matter of personal preference.

Wow, this is one salty lasagna!  I'm considered a salt-aholic.  So when I saw that the only thing that reviewers really complained about was that this was to salty, I thought this is the lasagna for me.  Nothing is ever to salty for me.  Well, this was!  I had a hard time eating it.  But I ate it because I spent a lot of time making it.  Besides being salty I don't think that the lasagna really had much other flavor to it.  The only good thing that I can say about this recipe is that it held together really well.  I made the recipe exactly as it said to without making any changes.  I used the cottage cheese just like the recipe called for.  I won't be making this again.  I will keep looking.

My =son-in-law had eaten the authentic dish in Italy.  Every couple days he reminds me of how great it was.  We can't even ask him what he wants for dinner any more.  We know the answer! A little time consuming with the home made marinara sauce, but well worth it!

I have made this twice but the 2nd time I played around with the ingredients to suit our tastes.  I used another reviewers suggestion to add Swiss near the end of the baking and it was a good idea, it gave the first layer a nice pop. I'll never make a recipe that calls for "store bought sauce" and that is why I appreciate this one so much.  It's simple, delicious and doesn't taste generic.  Thanks.  We will continue to use CRAIG'S format for lasagna.

I loved this Lasagna, it was one of the first times my family ate the whole thing in less than two days.  Very good the second day!  I missed the spinich, so I think I'm going to try it with that next time.  A very nice dish though!

I also made a little more sauce and put a layer of sauce in the bottom of the pan. Then I drained the cottage cheese to make it more dry.  It came out perfect!

Wonderful recipe! Tried lasagna for the first time and this was wonderful! I added a package of roll sausage instead of the ground pork. My family loved it!

I made this more meatier by upping the ground beef/sausage to a full pound each. I also increased the oregano to 1 1/2 teaspoons. I made no other changes. Very simple lasagna recipe, it came together in a snap. The boys all liked it, I thought that it was a little bland. I would make this again but add more spices next time.

My family LOVES this recipe. I use the sauce for spaghetti, manicotti and of course the lasagna. I use ricotta cheese instead of the cottage cheese and I also use red pepper flakes to kick up the spice a bit. Always a huge hit!! I also triple the batch and put some sauce in the freezer.

Great recipe.  I cooked two because I have such a large household.  In one night, we ate it all, none wasted.  My mother who is a southern cook, very particular, even loved it!  But the clincher was when I heated up the second one (I'd placed it in the freezer and took it out and and cooked it slowly).  When my husband and I came home, my teenagers' friends and my kids had eaten it all up.  All of the teens/young adults raved.  It was quite disappointing to come home to an empty tray of lasagna, but I was soooo glad they enjoyed it!  I made two changes: replaced cottage cheese with ricotta and used my favorite brand of spaghetti sauce instead of the tomato sauce/paste.  It turned out scrumptous!

I tried this recipe to get a real homemade taste and it by far succeeded. I didn't change anything in the recipe and it was awesome. I have the world's pickiest hubby and mother-in-law and even they ate it which was nothing short of a miracle... I'll definately be making this recipe again in the near future.

I changed some things, but followed the general recipe.  I used just ground sirloin and followed the advice of the others and doubled the sauce.  I topped it with the cheese layer using double the amount of cheese.  This recipe is pretty involved and takes awhile, but it is so worth it.  My husband said that this was the best thing I have ever made!  We have eaten it all weekend and it is just as good leftover.  Some friends tried it and said that it was the best lasagna they have ever had!  I was thrilled and will definitely make it again!

I liked this one.  I used a 15oz can of tomato sauce because I thought it was a little dry without it.  I did not precook the noodles just stuck them in dry.  I put sauce on the bottom and then layered from there.  I also only used ground beef because that was what I had on hand.  Thanks for sharing it was a good Sunday night dinner.

Perhaps ricotta cheese is the best however my mom always made it with cottage cheese and I loved it. Cottage cheese is a fine substitute.

Good stuff! The sauce was flavorful although I may cut back on the salt just a tad bit. I used 1 lb of ground beef, used only 6 lasagna noodles (3 for each of the two layers), and added some leftover tomato paste that I needed to get rid of. When I was assembling the lasagna, I was afraid that there wasn't enough sauce but after baking it in the oven, I found that it was the right amount. My husband and sister really liked this lasagna and since my husband likes his lasagna to be cheesy, this was the perfect recipe. I didn't even bother with the cottage cheese/parmesan cheese layer and I'll probably make it that way in the future. I really liked how this recipe was so easy and quick.....no cutting, no peeling of any kind necessary.

This is the best lasagna I've made.  I did make some changes to it (thanks to reviews)  Instead of ground pork I used Italian Sausage, no salt, ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese and added 1 pkg of frozen spinach to cheese mixture.  We love garlic so used 4 large cloves fresh minced garlic.  As other recommendations we doubled the sauce recipe (it would be excellent on other dishes).

Excellent lasagna, friend tried it and wanted me to make him some. Mixed up all 
cheeses (on accident) then added extra pound of mozzerlla on top. Family loved it
and is just as good the next day.

Way to salty! Directions are not clear about the salt listed twice. Once for the sauce and once for the cheese mixture. But it is way to salty and it feels like the salty part is in the sauce. I was so proud to make sauce from scratch

I am not much of a lasagna fan but I decided to use the meat sauce as my spaghetti sauce.  It was good as lasagnas go but the sauce is much better than the jarred ones in the stores plus I can add more extras to it!  Thank you for the recipe!

I'm new to the kitchen and was a little worried about making a lasagna from scratch, but this recipe was so easy and had such a great payoff. My family loved it! The only suggestion (from the pickiest memeber of my family) was a little less salt... but I will definitely be making this again!

I thought this tasted great!  I did however use Ricotta instead of cottage cheese, and next time ill need to make a tad more sause, but other than that I loved it and so did my boyfriend.

Excellent--much like my Mom's recipe.  I substituted 1/2 lb. sweet Italian sausage and 1/2 lb. hot Italian sausage for the meat, and used ricotta instead of cottage cheese.  I also omitted the sugar and salt.  I prefer more layers and a cheesy top, so I made mine with a layer of noodles, 1/3 cheese mixture, 1/3 meat sauce, 1/4 mozarella, etc., and finished with 1/2 the mozarella on top.  I baked it for 40 minutes with no foil so the mozarella would be brown and bubbly--delicious!  Thanks, Craig!

this recipe has a great sauce, but i found the salt in the cheese mixture to be too much and the overall effect was much too salty. there was also a lack of clarity as far as how much parsley to actually use, and there was no mention to leave sauce for the top. maybe that was intended but i rather like to have some sauce on the top. really though, it is a great start and the sauce from scratch was great-especially be cause i substituted portobello mushrooms and tofu for the two different types of flesh.

Add a layer of sauce under the first layer of pasta so it wouldn't dry up. I use Parmesan cheese and Mozzarella cheese. I personally like those two cheese the best and it fits well together.

This is a great lasagne.  Different from my usual, but really good.  I've been using cottage cheese instead of ricotta for many, many years, and it's great.  Also, my recipe with the cottage cheese does not have eggs in it.

This is an easy recipe to follow -- and I'm a horrible (and I do mean horrible) cook.  I made this and my husband was THRILLED.  It was great!  Granted, it's somewhat time consuming, but not one of those recipes where you feel pressured to run around the kitchen like a chicken.  Thanks, Craig!

I cannot cook; however, I can grocery shop and follow directions.  It's a no brainer really - buy the best quality ingredients and follow the directions precisely.  I wanted something yummy and homemade for two holiday get togethers.  Folks loved it.  My mom (a superb cook) said it was the best lasagna she's had in her life.  Oh my god, dynamite.

I was really suprised that this recipe was given 5 stars because it has so many problems.  Several people mentioned that it was too salty.  They were right.  I left out all but 1/2 teaspoon salt and it was still really salty  - I think it's the parmesan cheese.  The recipe calls for 16 oz of noodles but if you do 3 double layers you only need 18 strips.  If you follow the instructions and put half of the cheese mixture, the mozzarella cheese, and the sauce between the first layer and the next, you have nothing to put on top of the last layer of noodles.  I will not use this recipe again I think it needs some serious adjustments.

Wonderful sauce.  The lasagna was delicious.  I increased the recipe and had leftover sauce to freeze.  I can't wait to use it with angel hair pasta.  The Italian Sausage did make a difference.

We enjoyed this, but we added crushed red pepper and green peppers.  Additionally we cut the fat and calories by using ground turkey and 2% milk mozzarella and reduced fat parmesan cheese.  But don't put the reduced fat cheese on the top until it is almost done baking, it burns very quickly.  You could also use tin foil during the whole baking process to keep this from happening.

I love this recipe, but I made some changes. I made the lasagna with ground turkey and only with Mazzarella & parmesan cheese because cottage cheese and Regato is a little to heavy for my stomach. I also put Tomato sauce on the bottom of the pan and on top of the Lasagna because it would of been to dry if I didn't.

My family really loved this recipe. It's a keeper and I will make it again. However, I did make a few changes...I chose tomato sauces & crushed tomatoes with italion seasoning, I used 2 eggs instead of 3, limited the salt and added worchestshire sauce to season the pork/beef mixture and added the meat mixture 1st before adding the noodles.

I loved this lasagna! It will be the one I make from now on!  I added chopped spinach to the cheese mixture for an added veggie.  I also substituted canned marinara sauce because I needed a quicker recipe. For a healthier version, try ground turkey breast as I did and it's guaranteed a winner by anyone!  It turned out very well and as I said, I will make it again and again!

I came across this recipe while searching for a lasagna recipe that would be good enough to feed a crowd.  This one was a favorite of my family, and my father in law. I'll be serving it to an entire baseketball team and I bet they enjoy it too.  I did use 1/2 ricotta and 1/2 cottage cheese.  I think I'll use more seasoning next time, and maybe a little more cheese.

Wow - I've always been one to just use plain spaghetti sauce and cottage cheese for lasagna, but not anymore!  This was fantastic!  I used 1/2 lb. extra lean ground turkey and 1/2 lb. reduced fat sausage in place of the other meats (what I had on hand) and increased the sauce as suggested (2 28oz cans italian style diced tomatoes - I prefer them to the crushed).  I also used f.f. cottage cheese and 1/2 c. egg substitute (~2 eggs).  I made homemade noodles, as well.  Served this to hubby's bosses with garlic bread for the bread maker and a salad - everyone had seconds!  This sauce is amazing and will be what I use from now on!

I made this recipe for my boss and his family when a family member was ill.  It got excellent, excellent reviews, and was even better as a leftover.  Not to mention my house smelled wonderful.  I have used the sauce recipe for many other pasta dishes. Thanks for a new addition to my kitchen.

Really great recipe. I served this at a family dinner and everyone loved it. I doubled the sauce part of the recipe so I could have extra sauce to serve on the side. Otherwise I wouldn't change a thing.

this is really good Lasagna, I was a little confused which salt went where since it is shown twice, but it was too much salt.  It could be because I substituted Hot Italian sausage and lean beef. It was definitely too salty. I will positively make this again, just without salt since sauce and meat and spices already have salt, any desired addition can be added at the table. Thanks for a great receipe.

I scaled this recipe to 32 to use to feel at a graduation party. I did not measure the seasoning, and used Italian seasoning instead. I also added an extra 29 oz can of tomato sauce and did NOT cook the noodles first, which saved lots of time. I also used ricotta and italian sausage (I was feeding italians and Croatians, I wanted authentic) They all enjoyed it!

Best ever lasagna! Fixed for my family, including 2 teens and an 11 year old....all loved it.  I did adjust the recipe a little.  I used italian sausage and probably a 1/4 more of both beef and sausage.  I used all ricotta instead of cottage cheese and no salt added tomato sauce just because several said it was very salty.  I also added an addl 14 oz can of crushed tomatoes.   I covered with foil and baked next day. A keeper I  will make time and time again!  Thanx!

Just like my mom used to make.  I used hot Italian sausage instead of the pork, and added probably 6 cloves chopped garlic to the sauce.  Only used 1 egg, and 1/2 ricotta in place of 1/2 the cottage cheese.  Delicious!

This was the first time I've made a meat lasagna, used ground turkey instead.  It was very good, though I think next time I will cook the meat with garlic and a shallot for extra flavor.  Also my first time to make homemade sauce, so much better than a jar and easy too!  Vey good the next day!

We made a few changes because we're vegetarian.  Instead of using meat, we added a little more than 1/2 pound of mushrooms & some shredded carrots to the sauce.  Also, I may have misunderstood something, but the whole box of noodles is too much ... 1/2 box is probably plenty.  And like others, my husband & I both thought it was a little too salty.  I probably added 1 1/2-1 3/4 t of salt instead of 2t and it was still too salty. But if I reduced the salt some more, this would probably become a recipe we make often.

This was delicious!  I altered the recipe a bit because I did not have some of the ingredients.  I used all beef/no pork, Two 28 oz cans of diced tomatos, 1 can tomato paste, dried parsley flakes, 2 jumbo eggs, no parmesan but extra mozzarella, cut the salt in half, used Barilla's No Bake Pasta, part skim ricotta instead of cottage cheese and I was more generous with the other spices.  Plus I added a layer of fresh baby spinach after the first layer of pasta.  This is the first time I have made lasagna and I will stick with this recipe (with my alterations)!

HOLY MOLY!  This stuff is wonderful.  I am no cook, and my husband (who happens to be a great cook) says that this is the best lasagne he's ever had.  The only thing I changed was to only use 1/4C parmasan instead of the 3/4 that the recipe called for.  EXCELLENT!

I love this recipe.  The overall result is great and you can easily adapt it to your own tastes.  I often make this meal for vegetarian friends using meat substitute and they enjoy it.  It is also great to freeze.

I made this for some hungry houseguests and they begged me to let them finish off the leftovers the next day.  I didn't have any ground pork in the house, so I omitted that ingredient, but it was great with just the beef. The sauce came out terrific too, much better than the stuff you find in jars. It's super cheesy too.

This recipe was fabulous.  I did change it up a bit by using ground turkey, instead of beef and pork, and omitting the onion (my hubby gets sick from it) and adding more garlic.  I thought the cottage cheese was a wonderful healthy twist to this dish.  And, my husband and son thought it was the best lasagna they had ever had, and requested I make it at least once a week!

TRY THIS RECIPE!!!!    This recipe turned out very wells.  I was raised on lasagna with cottage cheese, but I was a little sceptical about all the cheeses combined with the cottage cheese.  It however turned out well. The only changes I would have made, is that mine came out with not enough tomato sauce.  So Id probably ad one 4 oz can to what ever is there. It isn't mama's but Very well done to the one who posted it.  Thank you!!!

My first time making lasagna and it was fabulous!  Excellent recipe!  I doubled the sauce and will now be making my own sauce for any kind of pasta!  I did tweek it a bit by adding 1/2 lb of sweet italian sausage instead of pork and 1/2 lb ground meat.  I also used fresh basil, fresh bay leaves, alittle bit of italian seasonings.  I also used a blend of small curd cottage cheese and ricotta along with the parmesan and mozzarella.  My boyfriend and daughter gave RAVE reviews!  This will definitely be made once a month from now on and I will be making my own sauce instead of jar bought!  Thanks for the wonderful recipe Craig!  I have leftovers and there's some in the freezer!

Pretty good recipe. I will double the sauce next time, as I would have prefered mine more saucy.  It was very cheesy.  I followed the other suggestions and cut way back on the salt.  I also used 1/2 cottage cheese and 1/2 ricotta cheese and only 2 eggs, that seemed to be just right.  I also added an extra clove of garlic. I had to add to the baking time to just get it hot enough to melt the cheese. It would make a great spaghetti sauce and my husband and I are going to try the sauce with a baked spaghetti recipe.

This was really good!  Next time, though, I will make 2X the sauce, using 1.5X in the lasagna and serving the rest on the side.  I also used 8oz cottage cheese and 16 oz ricotta in the cheese mixture because it seemed too runny with the three eggs otherwise.  Next time I may cut the eggs to two and use 8oz cottage cheese and 8oz ricotta.  Very, very tasty, and will definitely make again.

I made this lasagna tonight and my family loved it. Brought some over to my neighbor and she gave it the thumbs up.  I substituted onion salt  for the salt and didn't use as much as the recipe called for.  It was great.  I also used only ground meat.  Will make again.  Thanks Craig!

Very good. I substituted the ground pork for mushrooms (very finely chopped). I fed this to my husbands family when they visited us for a week, and they loved it. They (the kids anyway) think they hate mushrooms, so I didn't tell them that this had half a pound of them. I used salt free tomato sauce & crushed tomatoes, extra garlic, no onion, and subsituted the sugar for grated carrots. I will certainly make this again, next time a completely meat free version.

Very good lasagna recipe! The sauce was so good, I was eating it right out of the pot it was simmering in! I used all ground beef. The lasagna turned out great and very tasty. I liked it even better the next day, warmed up. I've been eating it for a few days now and haven't gotten sick of it. Yummy!

This was relatively easy to make and was pretty tasty.  My husband absolutely loved it; I thought it would benefit from a bit more zing so next time I think I'll try it with sausage and ground beef.
Worth trying if you're looking for a lasagna recipe with it's own sauce. :)

Made this last night at home. Took about an hour to prep/ mainly to cut up all the parsley and garlic without the proper tools. Left out the parmesan cheese because I'm not a huge fan of it, and it all turned out great!!! :) First homemade lasagna, and was scrumptious.

Highly recommend using high end ricotta for a better result.

Thanks for the recipe!!

Great recipe!  The sauce was wonderful.  I added some fennel to it, which added a nice taste to the dish. I had to use some "pre-made" as I needed some for one more layer.  I ended up putting the lasagna under the broiler for 5 minutes to brown it, and it turned out awesome.  Everyone enjoyed it, even the one who "doesn't like Italian foor" (can you imagine?) went back for seconds.  Brava mama!

Everyone loves this lasagna! I have made it twice now and have never used the pork,  but sometimes use some ground turkey in it's place. If not, I double the ground beef to replace the pork. Thanks Craig!

My family loves this recipe! I like a "saucier" lasagna so next time i think i will add another 8 oz can of tomatoe sauce.  It also came out a little salty. I will use half the amount of salt next time too and i think that would be plenty. Besides that it was awesome! This is my standard lasagna recipe now!

The best lasagna I or anyone in my family has ever had.  I made this for a family get together and I do not know how many times I heard that during dinner.  I made the recipe in the morning and refrigerated until dinner time then baked with foil for about 45 minutes instead. I'm sure you could do this overnight too! Followed recipe exactly otherwise!

I don’t understand why, they didn’t include how much salt, parsley, and pepper should I put in the cheese mixture and in the sauce mixture. It would have been better if they indicate it there. (The separation)  I put all the salt, pepper, parsley all at thesame time in the sauce mixture and later didn’t realize I have to put thesame thing on the cheese mixture. Made me so confused and frustrated for a first timer like me.

Wow, waaaaaay too salty! All I tasted was salt and onion. Should have either sauteed the garlic and onion with the meat or used minced DRIED onion. I would have left out all but maybe a 1/2 tsp of salt. The dish was completely ruined after all my effort and I took maybe 4 bites and couldn't stand it anymore.

This is a very good recipe.  The only made a few small changes.  Like other reviewers, I doubled the tomato sauce and crushed tomatoes.  I reserved about 1/2  cup of the extra sauce.  I used mild Italian sausage instead of pork.  I also reduced the amount of salt by half but it seemed a little under seasoned once reduced.  Overall this is a good recipe and I will make it again.  Thanks for posting this!

I agree with those who say this does not make enough sauce. Next time I will make 1.5 times as much sauce. And I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese. And no need to add salt to the ricotta if you are adding Parmesan! Tarragon instead of parsley in the ricotta adds a delicious flavor dimension.

I substituted 1 tsp. onion powder for the onion & only added salt & parsley to the sauce, not the cheese mixture. (The person posting did not say how much parsley to add to the cheese.) I also did not cook the noodles before assembling the lasagna. (Because I read in a recipe column that precooking lasagna noodles makes the lasagna more runny & less firm.) I will not be making this again; I don't know if I erred or I did not like the taste; normally  I like lasagnas with cottage cheese. Also I discovered not precooking the noodles was a bad idea--the noodles were chewy.

First time making lasagna.  Followed some of the tips by other reviewers.  Used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese and shredded parmesan cheese instead of grated.  Made extra sauce so it was cheesy and saucy.  It turned out delicious.  Thanks for the recipe and all the tips from other reviewers...Cheleedee

I used homemeade lasgna noodles and only placed one layer of noodles on the bottom.  I also had 3 total layers of the cheeses then meat layer.  I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese (cottage cheese is too salty) in EVERY lasagna.  This was a wonderful mix of meat, cheese and pasta!  The tomato component was not overwhelming, making the dish sloppy either.  It reheated the next day, on power 7, beautifully too...almost tasted better than the fresh batch!

I used Gruyère cheese instead of Mozzarella and I was amazing!!! My family absolutely loved it. The only thing I would change is to double the sauce, because it was barely enough for three layers.

This was a great recipe. I'm still a beginner at cooking, but this wasn't hard and turned out wonderful. The only things I changed was I didn't use any parsley flakes and I used garlic powder and onion powder. I seasoned to taste. I used more than recommended on seasonings but it turned out great. I did not use any pork just beef. I didn't change anything else in the recipe. Very easy and tasty recipe

Made this recipe tonight. It definitely is better with ricotta cheese( tried it with cottage and it wasn't very good) I recommend using more than the suggested cheese mixture, at least increase by 1.5. I added a spiced tomato sauce and it was definitely a better taste than plane tomato sauce.  Other than those suggested changes this is a great recipe!

Wonderful lasagna. I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese mixture (which I use in my mom's version ) this was way better, sorry mom. I omitted parsley as I was out of it. My hubby said to stop looking for any other versions, this was a keeper. I will also use the meat sauce for spaghetti.
Update: 2016
I use the sauce now for multiple dishes. Spaghetti, Ravioli's and the Lasagna. It so handy since it is quick. Much tastier than store bought.

I gave this five stars - family loved it! I followed the recipe for the most part but here are the few changes I made:  Used no-boil noodles (Barilla oven-ready 9 oz pkg and only used 9 pieces) and put 1 cup of sauce on the bottom with only one layer of noodles at bottom.  Used a 28 oz can of sauce + the 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes.  I did have extra, but I'd rather have extra than not enough sauce so maybe use a 14.5 oz can of sauce. I used Ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese.  I sautéed the onions and garlic in olive oil and then added the rest of the sauce ingredients. I used a little less parmesan - maybe 1/3 cup?  I used as much salt as directed and I also agree to cut the salt content by about half.  There is already salt in many of the other ingredients.  Total baking time was about 45 minutes for me. I will be making this again because family loved it - even my picky 11 year old!

I made my bolognese sauce and kept it separate, my lasagna had tomato sauce only. My one child hates hamburger meat. I just served it on the side, or pour it over your portion. I did use ricotta, only because I already had it. Also, I used fresh mozzarella, my local Shop Rite has a manager's special-if it expires in a couple of days it's 50% off, I usually buy few of them and freeze for my next cooking need. From experience I know there is no risk in buying it as it's still good for few days, and when defrosted it tastes as good as fresh..
Overall a great dish.

I used ricotta cheese instead of the cottage cheese and used vegetarian "beef" instead of real meat, and completely disgarded the pork (I am a vegetarian). I took this dish over to my meat-eating extended family, which includes a picky pregnant woman and high school boy. They were surprised that I did not use real meat and they said it was the best lasagna they'd had. I agree with others in that the sauce really made the dish and I will now use it's recipe for any red pasta dish, it was just that good.

Will definitely be making this lasagna again, hopefully tomorrow night. This is my favorite lasagna recipe by far!

(I decreased the salt by a teaspoon and used two eggs instead of three.)

This is a good basic lasagna recipe that is easy to make and holds together well. I used ricotta cheese in place of the cottage cheese and all ground beef. Next time I will leave out the meat entirely as I prefer it that way and think this has enough flavor without it.

This was excellent.  I used part skim ricotta instead of cottage cheese, Prego sauce and I also added chopped spinach.  It was meaty with the perfect amount of cheese, pasta and sauce.  I will surely make this again, but I may substitute hot italian sausage for teh ground pork.

This is a great recipe.  I doubled the sauce and used beef, pork and hot italian sausage.  I also chopped carrot and sauted with onion and meat to break acidity (in place of sugar).  I did not use as much salt as recipe called for and used half cottage cheese and half ricotta for cheese mixture and only two eggs.  I only had a little sauce left.  This may have been because my pan may have been larger than 13 x 9.

Amazingly delicious!  I made this for my family and friends and they all loved it.  I could not find ground pork and used all ground beef.  I also used no salt cottage cheese and added salt to my taste.  The sauce is so good you could have it over pasta.  Next time I make it I will do it with the ground pork.

The recipe was very easy to follow.
I cut the recipe in half. I didn't add the eggs to the cottage cheese.
My Son who is a very picky eater loved this lasagna, I will make this recipe again.

This recipe is the best I've found for lasagna. The homemade sauce is what really makes the dish. The first time I made it, it was pretty salty, so the next time I reduced the salt a little. Awesome!!!

I used ground beef and Hot Italian Johnsonville sausages, topped the lasagne with Parm when I took the foil off.  Also added about 8 oz drained frozen spinach to the ricotta/egg/parm mix.  Otherwise, with the other additions I made, this is my go to lasagne recipe now.  I would probably add a bit more cheese as well, but this was good!

A keeper for sure!   However,  I am a self professed salt-aholic and I would use  less than the recipe calls for.  I didn't use but 12 of the noodles with my two layers so ended up throwing the rest out.  I sprinkled about 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese on the top for the last 10 minutes and then broiled it about 2 minutes.  I thought this was an excellent recipe!

Do yourself a favor. Do not use cottage cheese (use ricotta cheese instead) and do not use any of the salt recommended in this recipe. The dish comes out way too salty (and I'm a salt lover).

Good base sauce! Better with added mushrooms, red wine, bay leaf and much more seasonings.  I used ground pork and pork sausage (it's what I had on hand) so I added a bit of beef stock concentrate. 
Love the cottage cheese with mixture!

I made it, it is delicious! My only question is that several ingredients were listed twice in the prep section, once in the meat and again in the cottage cheese/Parmesan mix. I’ve been putting the spices in the meat sauce and it turns out fantastic, a family hit!

This is a great recipe. I made it in 3 layers using a smaller pan than a 9 x 13 as I prefer a deeper lasagna dish. I used Ricotta cheese as I don’t like cottage cheese in lasagna. It was delicious & my husband loved it. The sauce is delicious & flavorful. It’s a keeper!

Nailed it! It was delicious, don’t get discouraged by the reviews, I only added an extra layer of cheese on top with some Parmesan mixed in. Ricotta is not my favorite so I really enjoyed the cottage cheese version! I added an extra layer of cheese on top and some extra Parmesan mixed with the mozzarella. I also used a whole pound of mild Italian sausage instead of 1/2 beef and 1/2 pork. Really didn’t have a salt problem but I improvised and added as much as I felt necessary. Plus I love salt. It was delicious, don’t get

I make this a few times a year. And I use the sauce for my chicken parm when I make that. Will definitely be the only lasagna recipe I ever use again. The family LOVES it. I do substitute ricotta for the cottage cheese.

I made it exact besides used 1lb of beef and 1lb 1/2 of pork and it seriously was out of this world! My husbands grandmother has never tried lasagna because she said it never caught her eye in restaurants and she told me 100 times how good it was and went for seconds!

It was my first lasagna. I followed every step. My husband loves lasagna and he said that his mother’s is the best he’s ever tried so I kept my expectations low until his first bite. He finally said this is the best lasagna he has ever tried and I’m just speechless.

I most definitely will make this again. The best lasagna I've ever had. The only tweaks I did were to NOT add the salt (the hubby and I use little or no salt and figured we'd get enough from the ingredients... and we did!), added a bit of pepper flakes and used oven ready lasagna noodles. We loved it and I even passed the recipe along to friends on FB. Bravo on a great recipe and thanks for sharing it!

I always read the comments for extra tips before I make things, so here are mine. I used ground turkey and ground chicken instead of beef and pork since my fam and I don't eat those. I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese and doubled the amount. I also went for double the amount of shredded cheese but used Provel instead of Mozzarella to do so. My family loved it! Will definitely be making again.

This is one of my favorite recipes! I added some ricotta, and doubled the tomato sauce and crushed tomatoes. I like my lasagna with alot of red sauce to match the amount of cheese.  Perfect mixture!

Good but did not like the double layers of noodles and did not use salt in cheese mixture (a total of 3 1/2 tsp sounded like too much).  I found there was enough sauce and liked the pork/beef mixture.  Think it could use a little more cheese but that is because I am a cheese lover.  All in all though, a tasty lasagna that I will make again..

Next time I will not add the sausage. I used the no cook lasagna noodles. Cooking time was a little longer, but, worth it. Because of that I will double the tomato sauce to add more moisture during cooking going forward.

I made this lasagna  for my extended family one evening. It was an absolute hit. Everyone loved it, and there were no leftovers at all.

I did make a few changes: I left out the parsley because the kids are suspicious of random green bits, I used 2 cloves of garlic, and I added 1 tsp of ground cinnamon. 

Cinnamon is always my go to secret ingredient for all tomato sauces! It adds a warmth to the sauce and everyone always seems to love it and they're always surprised when they find out what it is. 

Thank you for  this recipe! I will be making it again.

I like a hint of nutmeg and added to the sauce and to the cheese mixture.  I don't measure a single I should.. but probably 1/8th tsp to the sauce and just a few dashes to the cheese mixture.  It is a matter of personal taste.

I like the simplicity of the recipe, they differ from mine as I like flavor and I love to do wine paring. but so people know Ive not an ego, I would blend 1lb Italian sausage with beef.
use crushed garlic instead of powder, and Monterey jack {pepper jack} if you want a kick, Kolby, mozzarella, and fresh graded parmesan in all applications, specially on the surface and serving.
I also add fresh baby spinach to the cottage cheese mixture level, as well as sliced baby bell mushrooms, and more crushed garlic.   
 serve with a pinot noir, I prefer my own but a Columbia crest is very well suited or an Australian $20+ bottle with a classic Cesar Italian salad is a very good combo
I also offer an Italian classic cyanate    that would be divine when this is served with fresh roasted asparagus

Excellent but it was a little runny. I drained one can of tomatoes into the bottom of the dish as suggested and I should have drained the second one. The taste was great though.

It was a labor of love but all lasagna is. I picked this one because I don't like ricotta. Yummy but holy salt, Batman! Next time we are for sure going to cut out most of the salt. I'll keep it in the sauce but there's no reason to put it in the egg/cheese mixture.

I made this for my husband's belated birthday dinner,  his mom and brother joined us. His mom was a chef in her younger days so is a hard person to cook for and she loved it - she even had seconds! The only thing was it was a bit too salty. Other than that it was absolutely fantastic!

This Lasagna recipe is the greatest! 
I've made it three times now for family get-together's and  everyone loves it. 
One question. It does not mention how much parsley to add to the cheese mixture. How much should I use?

I used to make homemade lasagna until I found a recipe for lasagna made with jarred spaghetti sauce about 20 years ago, then that's all I made. I wanted to make the old fashioned lasagna sauce again, so I gave this recipe a try. I was not disappointed! It tasted exactly as I remembered. I made this recipe exactly as written, I just added pepper to the sauce, and I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese and only 1 egg instead of 2.  I will be using this recipe! It's a winner, and it's not that much harder than using spaghetti sauce.

My fiancée and I love this recipe. He would disagree with me but the only change I would make is not adding the salt to the cheese mixture. I don't eat a lot of salt so to me it was to salty. However, my fiancée thought it was perfect. Other than that small change I loved it. I will make it again. Oh I did add the extra sauce to the bottom of the dish like others suggested BEFORE the first layer of noodles and that made a huge difference. Noodles were not dry at all.

Actually quite easy to make for someone who has never made lasagna before. I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese and added spinach.  Everyone loved it, definitely will make it again.

Best lasagna I've ever made. I loosely followed the recipe...3/4 lb 90% lean beef, 1 mild italian sausage, added onions and olive oil before cooking the meat, used ricotta rather than cottage cheese, added some fresh oregano and basil to the sauce, and replaced the sugar with a few grains of cardamom (like 10) which give a sweet taste without the sugar, and made fresh pasta instead of boxed. Using fresh pasta I researched whether to cook it or not before putting it in the oven and opted not to. I think that was a good choice, it kept the layers from being too runny and slippery when served. Everyone LOVED it.

This is very similar to my long time recipe. I also use cottage cheese rather than ricotta cheese and everyone has commented on how much creamier and moister it is.  Ricotta is a much drier cheese.  The only thing I did differently is I used 3 cups cottage cheese and 12 ounces of tomato paste rather than the sauce.  Turned out great!

It was not a really special recipe, kind of tasted like all of the other ones I have made. The meat mixture doesn't need to be simmered for 30 mns; 10 mns is long enough. My husband enjoyed it for dinner. However, I will end up making my other recipe I have.

This is one of the best lasagna recipes I've tried and it's super easy. It worked very well with all dried ingredients and I had ground Italian sausage in stead of pork or beef but it still worked very well.  My girls love it.

I chose this recipe because of the ground pork/beef combination and because it called for small curd cottage cheese. I omitted the salt and doubled the tomato sauce. Delicious. It is a classic meat and cheese lasagna that is easily adapted.

This recipe was delicious!!   It doesn't say how much parsley to add to the cheese mix (only the sauce mix), so we did 1 tbs.  We also did all beef instead of half pork.  Great leftovers!

HOLY MOLY!!! This was AWESOME!!! I put spinach in the layers and it was amazingly good. I also added chopped mushrooms to the sauce. I somehow had leftover noodles, spinach & sauce and a full pan so I made lasagna rollups.

Delicious!  I uses 1/2 ground sirloin and 1/2 hot Italian sausage with the full 15 oz. can of sauce.  Also 1/2 ricotta and 1/2 cottage cheese, with no added salt in this part.  I tossed a little chopped spinach in 2 layers as well.  A little sauce on the bottom to prevent sticking and had 3 single layers.

Was delicious and worth the hard work! Super cheesy and just steamy and delicious. My only word of advice would be to be generous with the spices and the tomato sauce.

I don't care for cottage cheese whatsoever, so I just used ricotta anyway.  I would say this is one of my favorite lasagne's ever.  I used low-fat ricotta and cheese.  I had about a 1/2 cup of gouda cheese leftover from something else so I added that, too. I only added 2 eggs instead of 3.  Super!!

I used half cottage cheese and half ricotta because i wasn't quite sure about using entirely the cottage cheese. Turned out great! also used less salt as the meat and sauce etc were already salty enough. Otherwise was a great recipe and will use again in the future! The Fiance loved it and that was a plus!! he's picky.

it's too salty, which I agree with and the recipe does not have you sauté the onions and garlic. The onion flavour is too strong and I hate getting that crunch of onion with almost every bite.

This sounds like the recipe I used to make but haven't made in years. Seems as though everything old is new again, so I am going to make this one -- and I will use the cottage cheese AND ricotta, as that is what I remember.  I never tried to freeze this recipe but wonder if that is doable, or does it come out soggy when thawed?  Jody

This is a pretty good recipe. I subbed 3oz. of port for the vinegar. Didn't have any parmesan so used cheddar. Next time, I'll double the recipe and use a deeper dish. Came out a little shallow.

This was so delicious, I had to share it with co-workers and they loved it. I did change the cheese amount to half a pound of each instead of a pound, and I am glad I did, because that in of itself was plenty cheesy already!

I also cut some salt, used no-boil noodles, and used half ricotta and half the cottage cheese. Very good!

I made it with lactose free cheese,  and used soft goat cheese instead of cottage cheese.   The flavor in the sauce is amazing.  I used less noodles than noted and would have used more cheese.  Definitely a keeper.

I made this lasagna several times now and it is fabulous! I used all beef, ricotta cheese, and less salt, but still it was great! Gotta have it at least once a month now.

I thought this recipe was just ok! I was excited by the reviews, but my husband and I found that it was no better than the standard lasagna recipe.
