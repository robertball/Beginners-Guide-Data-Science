I followed the hints on this site to make a good cheesecake and this recipie still turned out very shallow. Looked more like a tart than a cheesecake, although the texture and taste were very good.

Sorry !!! This was not good to us.  I think it was the sour cream topping.  We love sour cream but not on cheesecake.

I do admit it was a little thin, however it was so very good. I would make it again. Everyone loved it!

The flavor of this cheesecake is great but after reading reviews, and knowing I like a thicker cheesecake, I decided to double the filling ingredients. I topped it with a bag of frozen bing cherries and it was heaven on a plate. Yummm
