This recipe was so-so. The meatloaf really did not hold together that well, it was really moist so fell apart easily. I did use ground turkey instead of beef due to food allergies. For my picky eaters I used onion powder instead of chopped onions. It was a bit on the bland side and should have looked at reviews of the original recipe first and seasoned appropriately:/ My kids did like the sauce that was on top.

This is my favorite meatloaf recipe. Every time I make it, it turns out really well and very flavorful. I use 99/1 extra lean ground turkey for this recipe, grate the carrot extra fine so it's almost a puree, and chop the onion really small too. It holds together really well (no crumbling) and comes out really moist.

If you don't use all the milk they suggest, this is great.  The mixture gets too soupy with a full cup of milk and only one egg. The carrots were great in there, it added a little sweetness and you couldn't really tell they were carrots.  I am making this again tonight.

This was really good and easy to make but don't add all the milk.  I looked at other posts and didn't add any milk but in retrospect I think 1/4 cup would have been ok.  I used 93% lean ground beef.  I minced and sautéed the onions and carrots first in 1 tsp of veg oil.  I also added a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce to the meat mix, will probably add two next time.  I did not put the brown sugar in the topping, only mustard and ketchup.  The 10 minute prep time for me was very unrealistic.  It was more like 35 minutes.   Will definitely make this again.

This meatloaf was great! I replaced the beef with ground turkey, and used almond milk instead of 1% but it came out great!

Agree.  Didn't hold together very well and was very moist.  I also used ground turkey for health reasons.  I seasoned it with more of my normal seasons vs just salt/pepper so even though the consistency was not the best, it still tasted great and my hubby went back for seconds.  Sauce was delicious too.

I liked this recipe, although , I would probably use less brown  sugar in the future.. the only change I made was not  intentional. I misjudged how much bread crumbs to use. The meat loaf was a little dense. The next time I make it, I will use less.( But I will make it again.)
    Overall, I think it is a good recipe.

This turned out to be a hit for dinner in feeding hungry boys. I sautéed the onions with garlic before adding to meatloaf mixture. I think the whole wheat bread crumbs added to flavor. Shredded carrot is a color and flavor plus

I looked at Renee C’s review and will make adjustments. Next time I plan to use less milk, add 1-2tbs of worshetshire sauce, replace the ketchup and mustard with bbq sauce, and sauté the onion and carrots. Also, my “large carrot” was too much. I’m thinking maybe a half cup of shredded carrots next time.

My go to meatloaf recipe. The 1.5 lbs thing is a bit annoying as I buy beef in 1 pound packs but I have started to double the recipe and pack it for lunches all week long. I also chop the carrots and onions as small as possible as my 9-yr old didn't like the texture the first time around and I agree with im.
