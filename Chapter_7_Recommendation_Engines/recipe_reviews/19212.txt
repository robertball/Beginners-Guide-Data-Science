Tastes delicious. They weren't chewy at all. Maybe I didn't cook them enough. But when I attempted to break it into pieces it kind of fell apart and crumbled quite a bit.

I want my money back. I made this and it was a complete fail for me. It never hardened and I couldn't bring myself to chow down on so much butter. I get it's a dessert, but when the bottom looks like butter it's hard to think it's going to be great. Tastes good but I rather have a cookie texture.
