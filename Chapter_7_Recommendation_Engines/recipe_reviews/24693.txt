I made this to bring as a dessert.  I had so many refrigerator crescent rolls on hand.  I saw this recipe and tried it.  I did make my own apple filling.  Chopped up 4 granny smith apples and added some brown sugar, butter and cinnamon.  Cooked on top of the stove until tender.  Drained the liquid and did as directed.  I added a nice touch.  With the liquid I drained I made a powdered sugar glaze to put on top when it cooled.  Everyone loved it.  Great recipe!!!!

Really good and simple.  I also made my own apple filling and took the suggestion to mix the leftover liquid with powdered sugar for a topping.  I was a little worried about the lack of sweetness in the crescent rolls, so I lightly sprinkled them with a sugar/cinnamon mix then flipped them over before adding the apples.  Everyone loved it!  I might try with the reduced fat crescent rolls next time.

Was easy and good, can't get much better than this. Something just seems out of place though. Very easy and quick though. I will cook it again most likely.

THis is ok and very easy but for the little extra time it takes to make I'd recommend the apple enchilada dessert also on this site.

This recipe was so good & easy - very quick to make too! We liked it so much we ended up having them the next day again because the kids liked them so much. Great idea!

We took Gala Apples, peeled and cooked down with sugar and cinnamon for the filling and used the Cresent rolls for the outside.  We sprinkled top with cinnamon sugar and baked. It was delcious and easy, great warm.

I don't know if I'm being fair or not.
 This is not as good as home made apple
 strudel (where's the raisins?) but it
 is very good for a quick fix.  Add some
 raisins, you won't regret it.

I liked them but my husband hasn't said anything so I guess he didn't. They weren't too sweet which is what I liked.

It is a good idea but cooked at the temp and time in the recipe gave me very underbaked pieces.  For the second batch, I used 350 and 35 minutes.  I also made my own pie filling because I don't like the canned filling.  My mom used it way too much!  Also, I think should not grease baking pan.

This tastes really good but I think it would be more fun to bake when you actually start from scratch.

Flavor and ease of prep great but I can’t get the center to cook at all. Made with both apple and cherry filling (no cinnamon for cherry) and love the edges. I’m think I may make with a hole in the middle next time so it will cook better.  Open to suggestions on this. Tried the 350 for 35, have tried greased pan and parchment paper, still center is just dough.

Instead of rolling, I folded the corners of the crescent roll over the top of the filling. After they came out of the oven, I sprinkled with cinnamon sugar. Delicious!!
