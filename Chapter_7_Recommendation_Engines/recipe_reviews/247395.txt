So when I got home the pretzels that I bought were tiny so I used a Ritz cracker, a squirt of horseradish sauce, a piece of roast beef, a squirt of horseradish sauce, shredded Italian blend cheese and topped it off with an everything flat pretzel!!! it was delicious!

So quick and easy, and as tasty as a roast beef sandwich! I used Heinz horseradish sauce, and just squirted a little on each one.

The classic pairing of horseradish and beef make these pretzel bites a perfect appetizer.
