Movie night snack! I cut the recipe back for two. I only made one substitution and that was using vegetable oil instead of canola oil because that was what I had on hand. The kids thought they were great only they thought they were a bit "spicy". That's not a reflection of the recipe, just personal observation. I'll make these again for the kids only I'll omit the chili powder and pepper next time. Fun recipe to make. Make sure you really watch your chips, they can go from perfect to burned in a matter of seconds.

These would be WAAAAY better baked, not broiled.  After 2 minutes, my chips were on fire inside my oven and I had to air the smoke out of the house, I kid you not.  Luckily I was cooking in batches so the whole thing was not a loss.  The next batch, I did not allow the chips to bubble and brown but they were a bit too soft in the middle.  The last batch, I allowed them to bubble and darken, but the dark patches tasted unpleasantly of burnt sugar.  This is a very finicky method to make these, but the flavor, however, is fantastic,.  Next time I will skip the canola and spray with butter spray and bake them-that should do the trick!

Made it for a gathering and everybody loved it!  Followed the recipe exactly except I left out the black pepper.  The sugar mixture tasted like Red Hots candy!  I thought it tasted a little oily, and that's why I didn't give 5 stars.

Broiling results in what you see in the picture....burnt chips.  Baking is much better...spray with cooking spray or brush with oil.

Always looking for low-carb ways of doing things, this recipe looked adaptable.  And, since it's just me, I made these one at a time with my toaster oven - easier to keep an eye on and somewhat less cumbersome.  I set the toaster oven to broil and let it heat while I prepared the tortilla. I laid a sheet of aluminum foil on the toaster oven tray, and laid one Mission Carb Balance medium flour tortilla, 6 net carbs each (which keep in the 'fridge seemingly forever) on the foil.  Melted a tablespoon or so of Spectrum Expeller Pressed Organic Coconut Oil in a measuring cup for a few seconds in the microwave, and brushed that on the tortilla followed by a thorough sprinkling of a mixture of four parts sugar(or Splenda)and one part cinnamon, a light sprinkling of pepper, and a couple dashes of hot pepper flakes.  Popped the tray into the toaster oven and stood there playing Words With Friends & watching while the magic happened.  When the tortilla got dramatically puffy and everything was bubbly hot and browned, I took the tray out & set it on a heat-proof surface to turn the tortilla over with tongs.  Brushed and sprinkled the other side the same way and popped it back into the toaster oven to finish the magic.  When the second side looked pretty much as done as the first, I took the tray out and let the whole thing cool a bit.  I ate my tortilla whole over a plate before it cooled because I preferred it that way and it was lovely.  One at a time leaves room for self-control.  :)

Sorry but these were awful. A better way to get what you want here is to fry corn tortillas (or flour) and before they cool spread them out and use a salt shaker with these cinnamon spices just like you would do salt for regular tortilla chips. I've done it before and it works. A fry daddy or kettle cooker works best. I guess baking would work too but frying IMO does it best.
