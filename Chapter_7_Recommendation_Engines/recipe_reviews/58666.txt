This was my first time making meringue cookies. Mine turned out hollow inside. I may have done something wrong. I didn't care all that much for the chewy texture, but they tasted okay. Don't think I would make them again though.

I really liked these meringues.  I did change the recipe some, thus the four stars.     I had to add 1/4 cup more confectioners' sugar, and I used 1 tsp double strength vanilla instead of the maple flavoring.  Then, after I baked the meringues, I let them sit in the oven over night, like a "forgotten cookie".

Turned out nice and crispy outside and soft and chewy inside, although a little hollow.  Tasty though.

I would like to try it.  I rated it because it looks really delish especially for dessert or for a treat and a surprise for your own folks.
