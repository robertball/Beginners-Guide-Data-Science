I need to double this recipe the next time I bring it anywhere!!!!  These were snatched up pretty quickly!!   And talk about easy to make....my "not-very-handy-in-the-kitchen" husband was able to finish making these after I got him started!

One of our favorite appetizers.  I use crisp, garlicky pickles, and sometimes use ham or a garlic-herb cheese to mix things up.

These are really good and easy.  Be sure and use really crisp pickles for this - it makes all the difference.  We use small whole dill pickles from the refrigerated section of the grocery store.  We also call them Frog Eyes.

The quality of these really depends upon the quality of the pickles.  I like to use barrel pickles.  I used turkey ham.  Very good.  Friend told me I had to make them everyytime for football games !

I have made this in the past and they are soooo good!  I used whole dill pickles instead of spears and sliced ham lunch meat rather than beef.

I made this last Christmas desperately trying to find something my picky Grandchildren would like.   I have never seen them eat anything this fast.   All of them loved it.   They asked if there was more in the fridge.   It is a staple now at family events...I add different combinations of seasonings to the cream cheese to spice it up a bit.

Someone always brings these to family holiday parties and events - never any left over! We use the Carl Budding corned beef thin lunch meat. Be sure to let the cream cheese come to room temperature, or you'll tear the thin meat when you go to spread it on.  Yum!!

Took these to ladies poker and they were a total hit!  The pickle looked like little Christmas trees for our Christmas celebration.  I have been making ham rolls for years, but the pickle totally makes them!  Thank you!!

Ha! I am truly amazed at finding this recipe.  I started doing this several years ago, though with ham and turkey.  I had no idea it was a real recipe.  Everyone thought I was weird until I had them try it, and they love it too.

This one is pretty good.  I thought I'd like it better than my mom's (she uses dried beef - found in the canned meat section), but I didn't.  To me this wasn't bad, just not as good I was hoping.

Make a lot of these because they will diappear!  I subsituted ham since I'm not a big fan of packaged beef.  It looks like an odd recipe, but trust me, they are delicious.  I made these for a chuch event and people were wrapping them up to take home.  Yum!

I made these using Clausen pickles and ham. Only used one 8 oz pkg cream cheese.  I took them to a potluck at church and they were gone in the blink of an eye! One of the girls wants me to make a batch for her. Thanks for the recipe.

These were a huge hit with my crowd.  I used a good quality roast beef from the deli.  These were a cinch to make, too!  Many raves for such a simple recipe!  Thanks for sharing, Cheryl Lowther!

These are so good. Period.
Used Claussens and also dried off any moisture on the beef for easier spreading.
Addicting.

My grandmother makes these for all of our family get togethers.  If she doesnt i do.  They are always a hit!  The key to this little appetizer is Clausen Dill pickles in the cold section and also we have always used ham.  Another good thing to do is mix a bunch of green onions(minced) in with the cream cheese and roll that up in the ham by itself or even with a pickle! yummy!
