I added soy milk (didn't have yogurt), honey instead of sugar and a bit of nutmeg, cinnamon  and this became my new favourite tasty, health drink.

This is what I love about AllRecipes, you see a recipe, the variations that others have tried, personalize it to suit your taste and first thing you know you have a delicious creation that goes into your recipe box.

Very bland tasting.  I had to add sugar and pumpkin pie spice just to have some flavor.

I was looking for a quick smoothie recipe to use the cooked yams I'd had in my fridge. Sounds weird, but when you have two kids five and under, you need a quick breakfast that'll give you the energy you need.

I did a little scaling down for one. I used a whole frozen banana, which crossed out the need for ice cubes. I added orange juice instead of milk, which
crossed off the need for sugar. I added a little cinnamon for flavor. I also used nonfat sugar-free strawberry yogurt because that was the only yogurt I had.

Eh. It was okay. Served the purpose and gave me the energy I needed. Don't know if I'll make it again but thanks for the idea.

I made half the recipe and used a small 15 oz can of yams, drained. My son loved it and my daughter thought is was ok. (She thought it should have been sweeter.)I liked it, I think it would also be good with a can of candied yams or with cinnamon and other spices.  Thanks for a yummy recipe!

This turned out good!  And helped me clear out my leftover sweet potatoes.  I made a few adjustments based on other reviews.  Used one and a half frozen bananas; no ice.  Used 1 cup plain yogurt (what I had) and added a tbsp of honey and a few ounces of OJ so I didn't have to use sugar.  Also added tsp of cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg.  I told my kids it was a banana-orange smoothie--and even though they don't like sweet potatoes they went for it!

I thought this was excellent.. I didn't have vanilla yogurt on hand, only had strawberry and it worked out GREAT!!  I also added some creamed coconut and cinnamon.  I don't normally use ice cubes in my smoothies as I find it waters them down some.  I usually cut up and freeze bananas and use them in place of the ice cubes!!  Thanks for the recipe!!

It was okay.  I agree that it was a little bland tasting, and I added some cinnamon and when I make it again next time (with the leftover ingredients I already have), I'll add honey, more sugar, nutmeg, and maybe some ground cloves.  The base is great, though, and I really like the texture!

Definitely needed something more. It had a very unique taste if you followed the recipe word-for-word... I'm not sure I would recommend it, especially if you have a big sweet tooth...

Wonderful recipe.  Used pumpkin pie mix (it's impossible to find plain canned plain pumpkin) and honey instead of sugar.  If I use yams I will ad pumpkin pie spice.  Everyone loved this!!!

Suprisingly very tasty. Used 1 14 0z can of yams in light sirup, drained most of the liquid. Added cinamon, nutmeg and cloves, ice, 4 0z peach jogurt, only thing I had on hand, same amount of milk, dandelion honey. Even my two year old who does not like smoothies, liked it.

We had some yams in the house and weren't sure what to do with them so I went on AllRecipes for some ideas.  I really didn't want some sweet gooey yam dish.  The smoothie sounded like it was worth a try.
I made these changes.  I peeled chunked and steamed one large yam and let it cool.  I put half of it in the blender with 1 cup of Mountain High fat free vanilla yogurt, and 1 cup unsweetened vanilla Almond Breeze almond milk, a half of a large banana, one heaping teaspoon of sugar, 2 handfuls of ice cubes, and buzzed it up in the blender.  It was like a milkshake, smooth and sweet but not too sweet.  I had to be careful about drinking it too fast so I wouldn't get a headache.  Very very good!

Might be an acquired taste or consistency.  Sort of like cold sweet potato pie shake.

Omgosh.  I had leftover yams and wanted a recipe. I used some ideas from other people... I started w/ strawberries  (frozen) as I had no bananas, vanilla almond milk (unsweetened ), orange juice, agave nectar (no honey in the house) a scoop of vanilla protein powder (dream protein by Greens First), and a few dashes of pumpkin pie spices. All of my picky eaters drank it. A great summer drink, no artificial anything and yummy! Thanks for the idea. (I never told my kids what was in it...lol)

To keep from the bland taste, I added cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla extract and it tasted like sweet potato pie.

I used honey and cinnamon instead of sugar, and light vanilla soy milk instead of milk, and it turned out amazing!! I typically cannot stand yams, but I had a whole bag, and now I know exactly what I'm going to do with them! Thanks!

pretty good. tastes like a mild version of pumpkin. i added pumpkin pie spices- more than what recipe called for.
