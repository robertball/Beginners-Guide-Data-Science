Very good!  I made mine in the slow cooker!  BTW to the person that thinks you have to soak split peas overnight, you don't.  It says so on the package of split peas.

An awesomely different soup, I really enjoyed it. A couple of things...first of all it's very salty- don't add the total amount of salt suggested, 1 T, if any additional at all. I added half that amount and it was too much. I also cut every spice in half and that was enough for me. I thought it tasted highly spiced and very complex with half the spices. I'd suggest starting with half and then adding more if you think it needs it and with the salt just leaving it out till you taste it. 

I used yellow split peas, I thought the color would be a bit more appetizing. I also presoaked the peas and still ended up cooking the soup over twice as long as the recipe called for to get the peas to be tender enough.

This recipe sounds a bit farfetched but really, if you have adventurous tastebuds try it, it's worth the effort.

The flavor was really good- I love curry. Instead of olive oil I fried a pound of bacon, took the bacon out and used that oil. I added the bacon to the mix with the beans.

I had a bit of troubles with this because I was trying to do it in a crock pot, but that had nothing to do with the recipe (I don't think). The only thing I didn't do was get the water boiling before adding the split peas, but obviously that was a mistake because no matter how long it cooked they never got soft.

Thanks for this Recipe! Totally Awesome Soup! Flavour is perfect. Texture creamy and smooth.

I simplified as follows:

Recalculated servings to 6; 

Then substituted:

2 packs of True Lemon Crystalized Lemon for the juice. 
Didn't have any lemons /lemon juice. (This is a great product, by the way, keeps a long time on the self, all natural, no added anything, just powdered, crystalized lemon, also comes in lime.)

3 cups Low Sodium Chicken Broth for water and bouillon. ( Don't need or want a bunch of salt.)

Reduced: Salt to 1/2 tsp.

Reduced: Fresh Ground Black Pepper to 1/2 tsp. (Fresh ground is more potent. Didn't want to overwhelm the other flavors.

Put everything in a 4 qt Crock Pot on High for 3 hrs.

Took imersion blender and blended the whole soup up in the Crock Pot when cooking time was done.

Fantastic Texture and Flavour! Thanks so much for this recipe. A definate keeper!

Served with BLT's! (I use fake, soy bacon by Gardenburger)

Very good soup.  For me, it ended up needing 12 cups of water because I used 2 to blend the veggies.  From reading someone else's review, I used 1 teaspoon of salt because bouillon cubes also have salt in it. I also used 1 teaspoon black pepper because curry has some heat to it and I didn't want it to be too spicy. I didn't add any cayenne pepper at all.  I used a whole 16oz bag of peas because after 2 cups there was only about 1/4 left.  It turned out awesome....Everyone loved it! I've already passed on my revision of the recipe to 3 people.

Good flavour, but I found it to be quite salty. I'd taste first before adding the suggested tablespoon of salt. With all of the chicken bouillon and spices, it's certainly flavorful enough!

Probably could do without the cayenne pepper and a little less curry powder. I also cooked the peas almost 4 hours and they were still crunchy. Other than that it was very tasty.

This soup is wonderful!!  I should have simmered it at a higher heat because my peas took awhile to soften/thicken, but it was great!!
Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is very flavourful. I didn't have any carrots so I substituted two large tomatoes for the vegetable puree. I also omitted italian seasoning and instead used 1 teaspoon of dried oregano. I also used 6 bullion cubes (instead of 8). I salted to taste and probably used no more than 1 1/2 teaspoon of salt.

If you have a hand blender, you can skip the refrigeration/blending step. I followed the instructions for simmering the vegetables, and then I took it off the heat, let it cool off a little and then used my hand blender right in the stainless steel pot. Next, I heated up some water, added the 6 bullion cubes and transferred the broth to the soup pot. 

In total, this soup simmered for about 2 hours, and the flavours and aroma are wonderful. I totally in love with it. Thanks for such a tasty recipe!

I didn't have carrots or celery, so I used parsnips instead.  Also, I left out the salt.  In my opinion, any dish that has bouillon doesn't need salt added - the bouillon is already quite salty!  I only used one or two tsp of curry powder, and it was still almost too spicy for me!  (Probably because I used the curry powder from the Indian store - it's much more potent than the American version!)  I think I'll make it again, but with still less curry powder.  It might also be good with some cubed potatoes in it - they're in lots of Indian dishes.  We ate it with naan bread, which was a nice complement.

Pretty good soup and I like the making of the paste, but it was a tad bit, ok just use a teaspoon of salt instead of a tablespoon. The split peas I got from Asherys probably did need to soak longer, if not it needs to cook longer.

This was fantastic!  I was lazy and didn't blend the veggies, and I found my dried peas were still rather firm after a couple of hours on the stove.  Next time I will try blending them.  Regardless of blending, the soup smelled amazing and tasted even better.  This is now one of my favorites.  I already bought another bag of dried peas to make this again soon!

I made this soup using a pressure cooker to speed up cooking time.  I had to cook on high setting for total of 45min, for the peas to be soft/creamy.  Didn't have to puree the peas at all - the final product was pretty smooth.  Love the idea of pureeing the cooked veg first - was able to get the celery in for flavor, without my husband noticing!  As I was preparing this, my husband almost turned up his nose when I told him what it was.  After he tried it, and ate 3 bowls of it, he said "don't touch this recipe - it's perfect!"  I omitted the cayenne, and used MSG-free, gluten-free, veg soup base (Instant VegeBase low-sodium granules by Vogue Cuisine), because of my husband's dietary restrictions, and it turned out perfect - not too salty.  Loved the curry, too!  Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

I thought this soup was delicious. My husband said he didn't like curry so I used one tsp intead of four, like the recipe called for. He liked it. 

However, it took two hours for the peas to get soft, not 45 minutes. But well worth the time.

Just tried this today with some alterations and it came out great. I had a smoked ham bone so I simmered it in 14 cups water for a few hours and used that for a base instead of chicken cubes. Tossed in about a pound of the smoked ham, including the meat that fell off the bone. Also left out the salt and let the full 1 lb bag of peas soak in water while the bone cooked. End result is a bit lighter, a little more liquid, and a tad spicier than regular split pea soup but very good! Had it with cheese bagels which soaked up all the liquid. It's starting to thicken more as it cools. I plan to use leftovers with rice tomorrow. :)

Easy to prepare, I used a food processor to blend the first ingredients and that was a snap.
Love the flavor the spices bring out.  Makes a TON of soup!

Great soup! All I can say is the second day is well worth the wait. Started making the soup fairly late and cooking time for my taste were a bit longer. I made the right decision to have it the next night. Used 4 bouillon per earlier reviews.

I think the reason people are having trouble getting the peas to cook is because the recipe calls for lemon juice. You cannot cook beans in an acidic medium because it will harden the beans. I will try it cooking them separately and add the lemon juice at the end. sounds delicious.

I will definitely make this again.  It was delicious!  I did not puree any part of the soup.  I have eaten it on its on and have also put it over indian style basmati rice.   Cooking time was fairly accurate and its piece of cake to put together.  So worth it!!!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND.  Well done!

So tickled to find a recipe without coconut milk. Chose to eliminate the olive oil (dietary restrictions). Pureed vegetables makes nice creamy thick hearty soup. Easy to change vegetables to add cabbage or cauliflower. Yummy taste. Served over brown rice as an option.

Truly a great recipe, although I agree about the bouillion. Too much!. I have read so many reviews about the peas still being firm. I have to say, ignore any package that says you don't have to soak your  beans or peas. JUST GO AHEAD AND SOAK THE BEANS, NO MATTER WHAT IT SAYS ON THE PACKAGE! I promise you wont be sorry. Its easy enough to throw them in a bowl of water ahead of time. They cook so much faster, plus they get nice and rinsed in the process. 
Anyways, I had made this recipe before, cutting the spices to my preference, and it was wonderful! I'm making this tonight for dinner and I'm curious about how coconut milk might do in it. Will keep y'all posted!

Very tasty. The peas were still crunchy after cooking beyond the suggested time. I would not add the salt the next time and probably reduce the bouillon cubes by two.

Pretty tasty. I think I cooked half the recipe and accidentally added one too many chicken cubes. I should have followed the recipe. Other than it being pretty salty which was my fault, it was pretty good. I ate mine with a bit of rice. Very flavorful.

This was so yummy. I browned bacon and added ground turkey and it was delicious!

I loved this soup!  BUT...8 bouillon cubes is a heart attack waiting to happen.  I put in 4 and think 3 would have sufficed, or not added any more salt that the recipe called for.  That said, this was incredible.  Next time I will make Naan to go with it.  Also, I used the ends of the cerlery, carrot, and onion to make a vegetable stock (4 cups water and veg ends, reduced to 2 cups broth) I strained this and added th ebroth to the sauteed veg which made pureeing ez.

So that's how you make good curry dishes - add a little lemon.  You don't need all the ingredients to make a good dish. The peas, curry, cumin, salt and water are the most important parts. No need for soaking peas overnight. If your peas are still crunchy, put them in the blender with a little milk for a smooth, silky texture.

Congratulations on a great soup recipe! Here are some general comments: (1) don't use split peas that have been sitting in the cupboard for a long time; it will be worthwhile to go out and buy a new package (2) cooking it the day before you are actually eat it makes an huge difference in subtle flavors (3) Vegans and vegetarians can use vegetable broth rather than chicken broth (4) the olive oil could be skipped to reduce the fat content - just add the lemon to some vegetable broth.  In addition, I will try the following tweaks when I make it again: (1) add 1 large chopped potato along with the carrots to increase the smoothness (2) reduce the the black pepper to 2 tsp and add more if necessary (3) replace the cayenne pepper with maybe 6 roasted and seeded jalapeno peppers in order to enhance flavors even more.

Yes, I made some changes to it and it was delicious. I used 2-32 ounces low sodium chicken broth, can of coconut milk and the zest of one lemon. I did not add salt. Made like this I give it 5 stars.

Delicious!  I boiled the peas separately in water for half an hour before adding it to the soup, and they were the perfect consistency.  I also went a bit easier on the pepper and added 2 tbsp. of turmeric.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly, and it was very tasty.  A nice change from the traditional soup recipes!

Really good flavor!  I didn't find it salty at all (we use himalayan salt).  We not fans of spice and this was just a tad bit too spicy for us.  I imagine it would be perfect for someone who really likes spicy. Everyone roots to have it again with just a little less pepper.

Good flavor but too heavy on the spices.  
So heavy it covers the taste of the peas way too much.
I will make this again but use a lot less spice
