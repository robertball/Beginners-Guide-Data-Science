This recipe was a much simpler version of what I typically use when I make coconut macaroons.  It came together easily and looked beautifully golden brown when baked.  I think the texture was definitely missing something though.   I think the addition of flour and egg whites that most macaroon recipes have is needed. Make sure you butter your pan really well or use parchment paper.    I lightly buttered the pan and they still stuck.  I

I made these this weekend and they turned out fantastic! I didn't have any almond extract, so I increased the vanilla extract. This was so simple! I do recommend putting the mixture in the fridge for about an hour before rolling out onto the baking sheet lined with folio and greased for easier clean up. I also dipped them into semi-sweet chocolate and they were fantastic!

This is an added note to my previous review. I made these again in mini muffin tins and they were a sticky mess. I was able to scoop them out and reform them but this was way too much work. I think the first time I made these I didnâ€™t have as much coconut. So, with more liquid proportionally, liquid sank to the bottom of the muffin holes and caramelized, creating a slick flat surface.   This recipe still gets five stars for flavor and chewiness but I put this comment at one star so u would c it.

I made this recipe several times and it was great, but only if you use them right away! The next day they harden and the day after the next are like a rock. I also tried to keep them covered int a container to keep the moisture in, but to no avail.
However, I didn't give up on this fabulous 4 ingredient recipe and per my friend's advice, I made this recipe with sweetened coconut fearing of the product being too sweet. To my surprise, the macaroons made with sweetened coconut were delicious and not too sweet for my european tongue and were MOIST for a LONG TIME!

Made the macaroons exactly as indicated by the recipe.   I'm not sure if I should give the recipe a rating as I have never had a macaroon before!   It was a little crispy on the outside and a little soft and chewy on the inside which is exactly what I had read in the other reviews.  I could taste the almond and a hint of vanilla.  This is a sweet macaroon and a lovely addition to any dessert tray.

Added flour and an egg to make more cake-like, left out almond extract. Dipped in chocolate when cooled.

The new family favorite.  Easy to make and goes quickly when set on the table!  I top them with milk chocolate just to add to the feeding frenzy!

I made the Divine Macaroons and they are very good even to a person who doesn't like coconut. I greased the sheet but they stuck something terrible and had to bake at least 25 minutes before they got toasty.
