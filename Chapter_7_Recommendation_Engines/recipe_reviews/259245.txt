I usually don't review if I don't follow the recipe as listed, but there weren't any here, so I thought I would. I followed everything except for the sweeteners. I don't like artificial, and usually do without. I chose coconut sugar, 2 tsp for the whole batch (1g. Sugar per serving). This came out perfect. Crunchy, and just enough sweetness to bring out the cinnamon. I'll be keeping this recipe!

I added 1/4 cup each of flax seeds and chia seeds, which meant that I increased the butter mixture to: 3T melted butter, 1T pyure sweetener (stevia blend, measures twice as sweet as sugar), and 2tsp of cinnamon. Super yummy!

Delicious!!!  But you should look at the granola at about 6 or 7 minutes as the edges start to cook more than the middle.  I stirred it up a bit and put it back in.... love it!

Nice for snacking. No need for extra sugar so I eliminated.

Love this!  I used 1.5 cups raw tree nuts instead of walnuts, pecans and almonds.  Used only Swerve Brown and no Splenda.  Sprinkled with salt before baking.  This was so good!  Great as a snack, on yogurt, or on ice cream.  My new go to low carb granola!

I added sugar free chocolate chips to make it a little sweeter. Very good. Will be making again.

This is a pretty good keto cereal. :-) I didn't have walnuts, though, so I did 1/2 cup of almonds instead of 1/3. I also used Stevia (the 1:1 ratio kind). I tried a little bit with coconut milk to see what it was like. Not bad. 

However, 8 - 10 min is definitely too long... I kept checking it, because I was afraid it was gonna burn. I ended up taking it out after 7 min, but I should have taken it out after 6. Some of the nuts started to burn. Next time, I'll take it out sooner. I'll also probably add a bit more Stevia. It suggests adding a little artificial sweetener, but that's not keto, so adding more natural non-sugar sweetener would be good. 

But yeah, it's a good keto cereal to have with almond or coconut milk.

Incredible!! I loved this so much. The cinnamon is amazing with the nuts. I'm Paleo, so I substituted olive oil for the butter and 4 tsp. honey for the two artificial sweeteners.  I will make this again very soon!

Not sure what I did wrong except used a convection oven which I should have reduced heat or time to accommodate for. Used stevia and cheated a little by adding a handful of low sugar craisins.
