I added a touch of california chili powder to the dressing, not much--just enough to give it the flavor of chili powder with a small hint of heat. The combination of ingredients in this salad is outstanding. Just the dressing alone blew me away. I almost licked the bowl. So so so very good.

DELICIOUS and so refreshing! The dressing really makes this stand out from the rest...LOVED the slightly sweet, tanginess of the dressing w/ the creaminess of the cheese and the crunch of the broccoli. All of the veggies made a great combination of flavors together and the dressing just put it over the top. This was so light and fresh tasting, and, this is gonna sound corny, but I really felt good eating it! Hubby already called the leftovers for lunch tomorrow, so that's saying a lot, lol. I have a confession though...I made this just as written, but planned to add the romaine at the last minute and...I totally forgot to add it, but it was wonderful, so it worked out anyway. Make this early in the day to allow the flavors to blend well...I shook mine around in the container every so often to keep the veggies coated. Sherri, Thanks so much for sharing this awesome recipe that is def gonna be a summer salad staple for us! :)

I’m delighted to be one of the first to make and review Sherri’s recently published recipe!  First let me tell you, we loved this!!  We like broccoli in this house, so as soon as I saw this recipe I knew I had to try it.  I did make a few adjustments based on personal preference and ingredients on hand.  I increased the honey just a bit and reduced the cumin, but not by much.  I used white button mushrooms.  And because I had leaf lettuce on hand, and it’s not as sturdy as romaine, I tossed it in just before serving.  I also had to use regular sharp cheddar, rather than white cheddar.  This was light and refreshing and definitely not your typical broccoli salad.  And just in time for those summer cookouts!  Thank you Sherry and my broccoli loving hubby thanks you too!

This is a light and refreshing salad.  The dressing totally made it for my husband and I.  I did the let ingredients marinade before serving, omitting the mushrooms (not a fan) and using a sliced fresh tomatoes (what I had on hand) rather than the grape tomatoes.  This dressing is so good, that I had an extra lime, so I made up a batch of dressing just to have on hand for future salads.  *Sherri* - you have a winner, thanks for sharing!

I usually avoid trying any recipe with less than 10 reviews but this one sounded so good.  I used cherry tomatoes and omitted the mushrooms (yuck) and used about 1/2 cup fresh cilantro (we LOVE it).  The smell of the dressing after I blended it made me nervous- I did not have high hopes b/c it just didn't smell good.  I left the romaine out (didn't want it to get soggy- highly recommend leaving it out until ready to eat) and let the broccoli and other ing marinade for about an hour and a half.  I filled each bowl about half full of romaine and then filled the rest of the bowl with the broccoli mixture and mixed it all up.  I had every intention of adding some parmesan cheese but completely forgot and I am so glad I did b/c this was fantastic even without cheese!  I am always counting calories and I could enjoy a large bowl of this with no worries at all AND it is really filling.  The 2nd day was even better.  I cannot express how great this was!  One word of caution- go easy on the onion- Hubs thought it was a bit too strong... I didn't mind at all though... maybe personal preference.  I will definitely be making this for our next 'company for dinner'.  I just hope we can eat this outside- what a great warm weather salad.  Wow, really, you have to try this.

This was very good! Everyone is right, the dressing makes this! Next time I would decrease the cumin a tad, but that could be a personal taste. I used parsley in lieu of cilantro. I made it the day before and the broccoli absorbed the dressing nicely but was still crisp. Thanks, Sherri!

THis salad was really good, and a big hit for cinco de mayo. I think I didn't add enough lime juice, I only had two limes. Next time I will use 3 or 3.5, but this salad is very tasty and light and refreshing. Perfect for summer! Thanks Sherri!

I made this the other night to serve with grilled cajun chicken.  I didn't use the mushrooms just because I don't like raw mushrooms.  The salad was fantastic - thanks for the new summer recipe.

LOVED this salad!  Its very limey, but awesome!  You really don't need to add the lettuce.  I don't think it added anything to the salad with it.  I would just add extra broccoli!  The mushrooms were also really great in it because they soaked up a lot of the dressing!  Definitely would recommend this!

I did not have romaine so I used a combo of baby spinach and arugula. I omitted the mushrooms and substituted parsely for cilantro as I do not like cilantro and I LOVE parsely. I doubled the grape tomatoes because of the omission of mushrooms. This dressing was superb! It is in the fridge chilling right now but I had to taste it as soon as it was done and OH MY! So good!

Great start! But I like a LOT of flavor and STUFF in my salads (and food in general). I don't care for mushrooms, so those were out, but I added a chopped Granny Smith Apple, chopped avocado, green onions (instead of red onion), craisins, and chopped almonds. I also put a full 1/4 cup of cilantro in the dressing because that's one of my FAVORITE flavors... It was awesome! Because there are just two of us and I didn't want the lettuce to go bad over night I "marinated" all the ingredients EXCEPT the lettuce together in the dressing and then we just scooped out as much topping as we desired onto a bed of lettuce... Then we did the same thing for lunch the next day. It kept beautifully! I'm making it again tonight!!!

I love this. I changed it up a bit.  Added Broccoli slaw, cranberries and slivered almonds.  Also doubled the liquid ingredients.

I really liked this recipe!  The dressing was both tart and sweet and the veggies stayed wonderfully crisp.  But note that you have to REALLY like cumin to enjoy this salad because the cumin does take over the dressing.

Great potluck recipe.  Light and refreshing.  I also cut back on the cumin to about 3/4 tsp.  I did not add the romaine lettuce until right before serving.  This was a big hit.  I let the ingredients marinate for 6 hours, which helped the broccoli to break down just a little, but not get soggy. The rest of the vegetables held up beautifully. I bought the Costco Broccoli tops in a bag, and used about 10 oz.

Yum! I used my food processor and processed the onion with the EVOO, lime juice, etc... I admit that when I tasted it, I thought it tasted a little sweet, but it is AWESOME with the broccoli. I marinated broccoli, tomatoes, and chick peas (love these)... I left out the mushrooms. Then I poured the marinated veggies on the romaine (and tossed) so that it wouldn't get soggy. Everyone loved it!

We liked this but if I made it again I would not marinate the lettuce with the rest of the vegetables unless sure it would all be eaten. It didn't hold up well over time. I don't know what the max marinating time would be but definitely not overnight. I have never stored a dressed lettuce salad so I didn't know what to expect but I picked out the lettuce and salvaged the rest. The only changes I made were to use chopped cucumber instead of mushrooms (personal preference), and reduce the dressing by half. I did use ground coriander as suggested since I didn't have cilantro. I liked how the cukes and broccoli took up the flavor of the dressing.

So good! Agree that the dressing needs a smoky edge. Double the dressing. Add broccoli slaw and fresh spinach. Feta instead of cheddar. Yum!
