Delicious sandwich with a wonderful Mediterranean flair!  You could easily use pita or bagels - whatever you have on hand to make these little treats.  I used "Hummus IV" from this site and added a little feta cheese. I chose not to cut these up, but rather my husband and I ate them as sandwiches. Very easy and very filling!
