I also used fat free condensed milk and after I mixed the ingredients together, I split the recipe in two seperate bowls and wisked a couple tsp. of vanilla extract in one bowl and a couple tsp. of almond extract in the other. I then poured them into carafes and stuck them in the fridge. GREAT to make your own Frappucino or Frappes at home in the blender. I just throw a couple ice cubes in the blender with half FF milk and half that day's old coffee with a couple good tbsp's of this syrup. I'd like to try this with a little SF chocolate syrup next time. GOOD STUFF! Thanks for sharing, Stacey.

I don't care for cold coffee but my daughter thinks it's the best thing since sliced bread. If she didn't love a Diet Coke so much, she could live on Iced Coffee. I made some for her and she just raved about it. She said it's great the way it is but also is just perfect for adding your own personal touches. This is a winner. I'd serve this one to company.

I am so glad I saw this on RE yesterday.  I made it and used it for an entirely different purpose.  Used as a creamer for my coffee. I am a coffeeholic.  I just used less water.  So yummy!  I am going to go make some more to use as an afternoon iced coffee.  Thanks Stacey!  A great treat...

Great recipe! If you place the can of sweetened condense milk in a pot of water and allow it to boils for 2 hours (keep your eyes on it) the milk will turn into caramel flavored and will make your coffee taste even better.

This is the most refreshing drink ever!  For coffee-lovers, it is a terrific summer cooler.  I made a batch for my teenaged daughter and her friends and it was gone in a single sitting.  Try it with a rich chocolate milk for a wonderful mocha flavor.

I am a big yellow arches iced coffee addict and am trying to budget my money better. I also have a lapband and have to make sure I get a certain amount of protein daily. Sometimes in the morning I can't eat solid food so I make an iced coffee with this syrup and a scoop of mocha protein mix.  I didn't have a can of sweetened condensed milk and used the faux "sweetened condensed milk" recipe on the site. Thank you so much Stacy. I have my daily fix and am not breaking the bank.

This was different. I am partial to the easy iced coffee recipe on here, but wanted to try something different. I used the calculate botton and changed it to 1 serving of syrup. From that I got 3/4-1 cup of it. The introduction on the recipe says to add 2-3 Tblsp to 8oz of milk and pour over ice. Based on that I got something that tasted and looked like lightly flavored milk. I had to double the amount of syrup to start to get more of an iced coffee flavor and color. As a result, it took 1/2 the syrup I made which amounted to a lot of sugar/sweetened condensed milk per serving. Maybe, this needs some more coffee added to the syrup, to make it stronger, so very little needs to be used. I think that would have worked.

Delicious!!! I made this with only one cup of hot water since I like strong coffee. I'll be making this all summer long.

What a terrific recipe, thanks Sarah! I'm hosting a bridal shower & wanted a cold coffee drink to serve with dessert. This makes an ideal choice! Made it last night to taste test & enjoyed every sip. Delish!

Excellent recipe! i've always preferred iced coffee to hot coffee, and having this recipe is the best! Easy to grab coffee in the morning with this...don't have to wait around for the kettle to boil, coffee to dissolve...etc, etc.  Adding mocha is a nice touch too! and i used more than just 1/4 cup..maybe like 1T more..just for more flavor, esp since i has adding chocolate syrup, so didn't come out too sweet.  But yeah, thanks for the recipe! i've shown it to my coworkers, who all tried it and loved it too!

I am not a coffee drinker but needed one for our Relay For Life booth.  This went over fantastic! It is super easy to make and was easier to store than anything else.  Everyone kept comparing it to Starbucks.  Thanks for the recipe!!

I finally tried this recipe today and am I glad I did! It is great, it tastes just like a Kahlua Kicker from Dutch Brothers Coffee. I took a tall glass filled with ice and filled it half way with fat free milk and filled the rest with the syrup. Thanks for sharing!!

I followed another reviewer's idea and am using it as a coffee creamer. I used 1 1/2 cups water so it would be a bit thicker. Pretty good mix, thanks.

This was good but not great.  I grew up in New England and this drink reminded me of coffee milk from when I was a kid; it was a caramel-colored syrup, in a bottle like chocolate syrup, that you stirred into milk.  If I wanted coffee milk, I would give this 5 stars, but I feel it didn't taste like a regular iced coffee.

Love this recipe.  Easy and so good.  I sometimes add whipped cream, vanilla syrup or other flavoring to make it different.  A perfect base recipe.  No longer need to make a run to Starbucks!

Great, but definitely not strong enough for our taste even cutting the water to 1 3/4 c. Will cut water to 1 c. and increase the coffee next time. Will make again for sure - will be especially great this summer when we don't want something hot! Also - makes a great white russian with 3T syrup, 1/2c milk (or 1/2 & 1/2) and 2 oz vodka. Mix and pour on the rocks!

I have been looking for a delicious iced coffee recipe for months with no luck.  I just couldn't find what I was looking for.  I would make them, my son and I would try them, and I'd never make them again.  My son and I LOVE this one.  I will definitely be making it again.  Thank you!!!!

This is a great recipe. I've even made it with non fat sweetened condensed milk and it was good. I even used a cup and half of water to make it more concentrated. It is very good...I've been bringing it to work and everyone loves it...and it can't be easier

This was quick and easy and really delicious! The perfect fix while I wait for my coffee maker to finish brewing the first pot of the day! It's also got a sweetness satisfying enough to follow a meal in lieu of dessert!

Great Recipe!  Easy and Quick ...  I used the Tasters Choice Dark Roast Coffee granules to give me a stronger coffee taste with the 2 cups water.  I now have a pitcher with this syrup in my refrigerator all the time.  when making in a glass I like to add some malt powder and some chocolate syrup.  Works great any way you do it.  Also spectacular when you add a scoop of vanilla ice cream to a tall glass and then use this syrup.  It's like a coffee shake.... mmmmmm  ..    MAKE THIS SYRUP NOW - YOU WILL LOVE IT!!!  Recently (2016) I've started to brew a pot of strong coffee and pour that in the pitcher and add  the condensed milk.  Both ways are Great!!

I was really glad to find this recipe, but the original recipe is too sweet, and not strong enough in coffee flavor for me. It took a little experimenting, but doubling the amount of coffee powder gave the flavor I was looking for, plus a nice extra caffeine kick.

All I can say is YUMMMMMMYYYYY!! I love Tim Horton's Iced Coffee, and tastes very much like it, I think it is safe to say that I do not need to go into Tim Horton's anymore for this! It will save me loads of cash!  Thanks for posting this!!!

Immediately after reading this and the great reviews I went and made it.  I'm drinking it right now.  To me it's good but not great.  It's a little thick and almost a little gritty feeling on my tongue.  I like my usual better.  All I do is microwave about 2 T. water until it's hot.  I add about 3-4 rounded tsp. of General Foods International coffee, cafe vienna flavor, stir until desolved, add cold water and poor it over ice.  Sometimes I add half and half.

Pretty good I like adding chocolate syrup and vanilla or almond extract to change up the flavor.  If you use an aerolatte, it looks great with that foam on top!

I made this as directed the only change I done was doubled the amount of mix per 8 oz of milk and it was fantastic. Tasted real similar to the java monster drinks.

It's just "Meh".  A bit disappointed that the consistancy wasn't like a syrup as the title suggests. I was thinking it would be more of a chocolate syrup thickness but it's waaay more watered down.  You could almost just add ice and drink it straight.  I'm sure with a little bit of tweaking it could be more syruppy like my all-time-favorite Nescafe Ice Java which they no longer sell here in the U.S.  Good recipe for base ingredients but I think I'll stick to Starbucks until I can customize this to my liking.

Wow! I was trolling my recipe box looking for gift ideas and came across this recipe.  Took all of 2 minutes to whip up and I just love it!  After reading reviews, I decided to start with 1 1/2 cup water and then add more if it was too strong, but nixed that idea after tasting.  Just a word of caution, this *is* sweet, so don't add too much.  My first try was 1/4 cup mix & a 1/4 cup cold coffee poured over ice and then topped with milk ....... WAY too sweet (on a serious sugar/coffee rush here now).  Stick with the 2T next time.
