Delicous. I used chicken I cooked in garlic sea salt and paprkia as I am allergic to gluten and don't use many canned foods. I also added about a tablespoon of sour cream to help bind them a bit better. Great recipe

When I first started rolling the tortillas they cracked...so I used a spray bottle and misted each tortilla with water before warming them in the pan, and they rolled up great. Definitely going to experiment with different ingredients in the future to perfect the taste, but they were great even without changing a thing.

Used 1 and a half chicken breasts instead of the can of chicken and couldn't help but season it with just a little bit of Taco Seasoning I from this site. I used the yellow corn tortillas but then decided that I should have used white because the yellow ones cracked really easily even when warm. To combat the cracking I used more filling than called for and only got eight bigger taquitos. Quick easy cheap...Overall a 5 star dish!

YUM! In addition to the canned chicken and cheese I added a can of diced green chiles and some taco seasoning. I also used flour tortillas instead of the corn. After they were rolled up I sprayed them with Pam and then sprinkled more taco seasoning on the taquitos. The best part was that I actually made these the day before my party then the night of the party just popped them in the oven on low for a while and they were warmed perfectly and still nice and crisp. I served with salsa and sour cream but they were wonderful on their own. I can't wait to make them again!

These were great. (: They made an awesome lunch for my brother and I. I added sour cream cumin and garlic powder and added a little more cheese as well. I didn't have canned chicken but leftover rotisserie worked well. I brushed the tops of each taquito with margarine before baking and the results were delicious. I'll definitely make them again.

LADIES and GENTLEMAN>>>> The trick to rolling corn or flour tortillas successfully for taquitos or enchiladas is to put one tortilla between 2 sheets of damp paper towel and microwave for 30secs. I know it's tedious to do that to every one, but if you're quick you can roll one while another is microwaving. Redampen the papertowel as needed. Using this trick, you will never have trouble with cracking tortilla again, no matter how dry they were when you started. Hope this helps some of y'all.

This seems like a great way to use up Mexican leftover meat. If you have some pollo asada, carne asada, carnitas, or even just ground taco meat you can give it a second life as taquitos! They also freeze great too if you want to make an extra big batch and store them in your freezer for a quick dinner--just reheat and eat. 
I used some leftover carnitas sauted with onions until it was hot and crispy. I quickly fried each tortilla in a little oil so it'd by more pliable and not crack (this is a great trick for enchiliadas as well). When I rolled them I added a couple toothpicks to keep them from coming apart when I baked them. Served them with salsa verde, sour cream, and cabbage salad for a light dinner.

Super easy. I followed the recipe exactly the first time but found them to be a bit bland. The second time I added a teaspoon of taco seasoning, used flour tortillas and added a bit of sour cream (as suggested by other reviewers). Yum.

These are good and much healthier than my usual fried version. I did think they needed a kick more seasoning on the chicken. But they're sure quick and easy to assemble great for a last-minute weeknight meal. All in all a nice base recipe easily tweaked.

I cooked 1 boneless skinless chicken breast in broth for about 10 min (until juices run clear) and then shredded it.  I seasoned with salt, pepper, cumin, chili powder, cilantro garlic and onion powder.  I at least doubled the amount of cheese.  The key to the corn shells is only doing a couple at a time.  Wrap between a damp paper towel and microwave for about 30 sec.  I didn't have any problems with mine tearing.  My corn shells were rather small, so I used an 8x8 pan and it worked great.  I did bump up the temperature at the end to 400 for some extra crispness.  Not as good as fried, but they were ok.  I think next time i'll brush them with margarine and see if that helps combat the dryness of the corn shells.

First of all, these were quite tasty and yes, very easy.  The issue I have with this recipe is using canned chicken.  The other issue is the lack of proper seasoning.  To keep this easy, I picked up a just cooked rotisserie chicken at the market, then shred the chicken by hand.  For seasoning, I used a packet of taco seasoning, about a half cup of hot salsa and a tablespoon of cream cheese (I promise, super yummy combination).  I used Mission corn tortillas, which are very soft and flexible so rolling these was easy without having to warm them first. The biggest issue I had was only one side of the taquito gets somewhat crispy so they needed to be flipped then put back in the oven.  Also, the tortillas kind of cracked a little which may be the brand I used?  Regardless, they did taste pretty great and hubby liked them too.  These would be a fun "pot luck" kind of meal to bring to work or other party like events.

Yummy and super easy! I make something like this often for a quick dinner on busy nights. The ONLY difference is that I used chicken that I boiled and seasoned myself and I usually crisp mine up on top of the stove in a little oil. But Kudos to you for throwing them in the oven. Cant believe I never though to do that! 5 stars for an easy yummy and healthier alternative to my frying recipe! ( Lets not be so critical. She never said that they were authentic mexican taquitos. She said they are EASY! lol Heck my Mexican friend taught me this same EASY way to make them. Yum Yum!

These were really easy to make (big bonus points because I can't always force myself to make a huge meal) and had a great flavor! It was the first time I had ever used canned chicken so I was a little nervous but it's just like canned tuna - no biggie. Like someone suggested, I added a little sour cream to the chicken mixture so it stuck together. I used way more than 5 drops of jalapeno hot sauce from Trader Joe's. I also sprayed some olive oil Pam on the baking dish and on top of the taquitos so they got crispy. When the taquitos were almost finished I added shredded cheddar cheese on top and let it melt. Next time I'll try pepper jack. Yum.

Love this recipe for many reasons: 1) Easy 2) Cheap 3) Quick- Not a "30 minute meal" but fast enough to throw together after work. 4) Customizable- Don't have hot sauce? Sprinkle in some chili powder for heat. I add cumin and have added chopped jalape√±os and corn. To make it extra cheesy sprinkle a bit of cheese on top during the last 5 minutes of baking. Quick tip: do not skip the step of heating tortillas in the skillet. I have tried not heating at all and heating in the microwave and neither method works. They're harder to roll up and crack/get all flaky in the oven. Not inedible but messier. I serve it as a main dish topped with guacamole salsa and sour cream and have a salad on the side. We make this meal at least once a month.

Kids loved! So easy. I crock potted three frozen chicken breasts with a taco seasoning pack for 8 hours on low (because it's what I had and this was a last minute decision). Shredded and rolled in to warmed flour tortillas. Baked as directed and served with sour cream and salsa. So good. Thank you!

We added just a bit of cour cream (which I normally don't care for) to the cheese mixture it turned out amazing! We wanted something to add just a bit of moisture and this did the trick! Great recipe and will cook again!

First off: I can my own chicken. I know what's in it. I know when I canned it. So don't knock canned chicken when you don't know what you're talking about. I hadn't tried baking taquitos before and I liked it. These were good; perfect for the grandkids I frequently feed. For the adults, I spiced it up and added diced green chilis (I canned those, too), some epazote, cilantro and garlic. In addition to sour cream and salsa (yep, canned that, too!), I served an onion salsa made from one diced white onion, 1 T chopped cilantro and juice of a whole lemon. Pretty good stuff!

I didn't use canned chicken. I put thin sliced chicken breasts in the crock pot with a sante fe marinade and rice. By the time I was ready to make dinner the chicken fell apart and had a sweet spicy flavor. Added some cheese and then put in corn tortillas. I had sour cream and cheese sauce to dip them in and rolled a leaf of romaine lettuce around each while eating. The family loved them even my picky eaters!

So easy and a great way to use leftover flour tortillas or shredded cheese. I had both along with a can of chicken that I had no idea what I was going to do with! To the chicken I added fat free sour cream shredded cheese cumin paprika garlic powder salt pepper and a couple shakes of fiesta party dip mix from tastefully simple. At the last minute I added a couple of teaspoons of salsa. I heated the tortillas in the microwave (5 med size). Added the filling then rolled them and placed on a baking sheet coated w/spray. A little "smart balance" spread on top of each one then bake....delish

I used leftover chicken from cooked chicken breasts or you could use rotiserrie chicken.....that would give it much more flavor than the canned chicken.

Excellent! I grilled 2 chicken breasts seasoned with salt pepper cumin chili powder onion powder. Then cut and mixed chicken with 1 1/2 cups of shredded cheddar and i used 2 capfuls of Walmart brand Louisiana hot sauce. Cooked for 22 at 350 - 5 at 400 - at broil last 3 min at 525. Tasted like El Pollo Loco Restaurant... Just need the Creamy Cilantro Dressing.

Turned out great! I altered it a bit by putting 4-5 chicken breasts with boiling water and two chicken broth cubes in a crockpot on high for 4 hours. I added garlic salt and Mrs. Dash Table Blend to the broth also. Once the chicken was done i put it in a food processor and chopped it up really well and then continued with the recipe adding additional cheese and tabasco due to the amount of chicken I used and following the advise of others and adding sour cream to the mix to hold it together. Heating the corn tortillas in the frying pan for just the 10 seconds on each side worked perfect for making them soft and easy to roll. I supplied sour cream and salsa when served; however I think that they were still slightly bland (probably not enough hot sauce for the amount of chicken i used) so next time I will probably use taco seasoning when i cook the seasoning as someone else suggested. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Great recipe! I also tweaked it with salsa and seaonings-try different ways each time I make them.Hit with my hubby for game watching days and quick meals. These are absolutely perfect for after school snack. I watch teen boys-these are a hit. I make the filling the day before. Before time of school let-out I dampen the tortillas. then start the process and bake so they come out just as they walk through the door. Served with assorted sauces for dipping. I use frozen chicken poached in broth and shredded most times. Also leftover rotissorie chicken. Turkey and beef(even ground beef/turkey work well). Saw a tip on the internet of shredding chicken with a mixer..who knew works fine! One thing I need to say in defense of the "canned" chicken for those knocking it. I agree with the store type of canned chicken. Though I do use it in a pinch. However there are many who home can(jars) their own foods. Which I have started doing. Until a few months ago (I am 62) I was not aware that one could can meats. This type of canning keeps foods delicious!!! No comparison to those little store cans. Check through all the reviews to gather ingredient ideas..they are great. Regarding this recipe since I've used it many times....It's a keeper!!!

These were super easy to make and really really good! I also used taco seasoning in the chicken mixture and to hold it together I mixed in a little sour cream. I took others advice and after warming the tortillas put them in a damp paper towel. I sprayed the tops with Pam prior to baking. these were so good they don't reheat very well though. I could only find white corn tortillas in the correct size the yellow ones were huge! I think next time I will use the yellow corn tortillas and just cut them in half.

I added several extras to this recipe and WOW was it good! I love the microwaveable taquitos (Jose Ole) but these were so easy that now I can stop buying them! I seasoned my chicken with taco seasoning (used fresh chicken) drained a can of unsalted black beans and threw in a can of diced green chiles. I think the green chiles are one of the key ingredients. I also heated up a cup of instant rice to which I added some cilantro and lime juice (to make it like qdoba). I mixed all of the ingredients together in a large bowl with some cheese and then spooned out the amount I needed on the tortillas. I did not heat the tortillas beforehand but did spread some butter on top which was a good suggestion. I give the recipe 4 stars because as it seems like it would be pretty bland

Has potential with some changes. Chicken needs seasoning and fresh peppers. you need to up the cheese and filling amount. Also the canned chicken makes it taste a little strange I recomend using rotisery/ boiled and pulsing it in the food processor.

Just okay. In dire need of flavor. My 6 year old son even said he didn't like them and I gave him cheese dip to dunk them in! I kept it simple just canned chicken cheese hot sauce and a little onion like the poster mentioned. I'd add cumin and chili powder at the very least. Brush the top of the taquitos with oil before baking as well to give the tortillas a little oomph.

I think this is an excellent basic recipe and an easy to go-to recipe for a quick fix meal/snack. Canned chicken is quite pricey. I usually use my rotisserie chicken (I love my rotisserie) and use my poached chicken recipe which is full of flavor. This recipe you can add to with seasonings minced veggies and garnishments to liven it up. For tortillas: Dampen 2 paper towels and place tortillas between them. Microwave for about 1 minute until tortillas are warm and pliable. Spray the taquito rolls lightly with Pam before baking. I love to serve taquitos on a bed of shredded lettuce and topped with salsa or tomatillo sauce. Red or green enchilada sauces also go well the many garnishments one can use for a dinner. Taquitos are excellent as a snack as well. Pork and turkey make for excellent chicken substitutions in taquitos as well. If using as a snack a dipping sauce (a few examples above) is quite nice.

Well I guess i cant say I "loved the recipe" because I didnt even use it except for the temp. Had no corn tortillas and the store I went in MN had no corn just flour. And I used deep fried chicken strips and threw them in my ninja to get them chopped. Turned out good. I added Franks red hot buffalo sauce to the chicken when ninjaing it. Worked awesomely

Tried these last night and they were a hit! My family could not get enough of them. I also put 3 chicken breasts in the crock pot with some taco seasoning and cooked on low for 8 hours. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great!

Tasty but the tortillas were chewy in some sections and crispy in others. The filling was delish!

I liked this recipe it was easy and something different to serve the kids for lunch. I followed some other reviewers suggestions and added a bit of sour cream and some taco seasoning to it. I thought they were really good!

As is this is bland but it has great potential. I agree with adding chiles sour cream and spices: cumin chili powder garlic salt and onion powder (or diced onions). My kids don't like them crispy so I didn't bake them longer than 20 minutes. Don't overfill them and make sure to roll them tightly!

These are good. I used a poached chicken breast and added a few lentils and a generous tablespoon of sour cream to the mixture. I nuked the tortillas two at a time for 15 seconds covered with wet paper toweling above and below the torillas. I sprayed the taquitos with Pam once rolled. The first few cracked but once I got the hang of rolling them it went well. The tortillas were a little dry; next time I'll brush with oil as several other reviewers suggested. These could easily be made with lentils for a vegetarian snack.

This is a really really good recipe. And super easy. I use the Tyson southwestern grilled chicken strips chopped finely before adding the cheese. Then for the tortillas per another reviewer's suggestion microwave two at a time in a damp paper towel for 30 seconds. Then lightly spray with olive oil cooking spray on both sides before stuffing and rolling. Also spray the tops well once again after rolling before baking. OMG these are soooo much better than the frozen ones! I serve for dinner with a dollop each of Wholly Guacamole Fage 0% and medium fresh chunky salsa. My hubby LOVES these!

These were great. I boiled some chicken and added cheese. Usually I put green Chiles in my chicken tacos but didn't have that on hand. I am for sure going to make a huge batch and freeze for on the go nights. Wrap and freeze. The vacuum seal for freshness. They would be good if you made a roast and shredded the meat. So beyond happy I found this recipe. Like another reviewer said.... spray the tortillas with a little water before heating in the pan (life changing) Great recipe.

The recipe as written is good and I made a few as written. But I ended up adding some sour cream to the remaining chicken mixture as I was having a hard time keeping the rolled taquito together. I used Chipotle Tabasco for the flavoring and it offered wonderful taste. I heated 2 shells at a time in the microwave for 10 seconds rather heating them on the stovetop. Quick and easy to make. I served this with a personal recipe from AR and we had a nice meal.

I followed the recipe exactly as I think that is the right thing to do before you make any changes. It was easy but I had to take it out at 20 minutes as it was already too hard. It was good but very bland tasting. I will make it again but add more cheese a little sour cream and some spices. Unless you like very bland taste and very crisp shells do not follow the recipe.

Great base Recipie. You could tweet this anyway you want to use leftovers. We used a left over turkey breast homemade taco seasoning and 4 oz shredded sharp cheddar for filling. We also microwaved tortillas to warm them instead of a pan. For a dip we added taco seasoning to sour cream. These were a hit. We have made them twice now.

These were a bit of a pain in the butt to make but they actually turned out pretty good. I felt like the chicken mix lacked a bit of flavour though so I added some store-bought taquito sauce. THEN they were tasty!

I have made this tonight - it is in the oven now. The chicken filling tastes good - but they are not staying together. The tortillas were cracking and breaking as I rolled them - now they are just totally coming apart with the heat from the oven. I am not sure this is how it is supposed to go. By the way it looks - I will more than likely remove the filling from them and throw them into a warm flour tortilla and call them burritos. No bueno.

Use a rotisserie chicken and added about a 1/4 cup of enchilada sauce to the filling. I rolled these tightly and made sure they weren't touching each other in the pan so they got crispy all the way around. Yum! Eat them all though because they aren't great as leftovers

I found this recipe by looking up "Canned Chicken." I had no idea what to do with canned chicken. Now I will definitely buy it again! This recipe was EASY and TASTY with a few additions. I did not have hot sauce. I added 1 TBSP of taco seasoning 1/4 tsp cumin 1/4 tsp chili powder and 1 TBSP of sour cream. This made it very flavorful but not spicy for the kids. This will be perfect for school lunches!

I tried making these added a can of green chiles and some sour cream and the taquitos were still dry and somewhat tasteless. Also it is not easy to roll these up using corn tortillas (I'm gluten free so I can't substitute for flour) without them breaking! I would not make these again.

Currently making this recipe. Using a different recipe for the meat (using the slow cooker carnitas recipe from this site!)They are in the oven now and I have no doubt they will taste great. However did anyone else have a ghastly time trying to keep the tortillas together? Mine kept ripping apart! Anyone have any additional tips?

I gave it 4 stars because it really is an easy recipe but it needs a little seasoning. I didn't use canned chicken. I cooked chicken breasts and shredded it. Then I added some salsa to the shredded chicken and heated it in the pan. This time I didn't mix the cheese in. I put it on the bottom of the tortilla and put the chicken on top then rolled it up. I baked it for only 20 minutes instead of 30 which was perfect.

We found these to be a little bland although baking them was a great idea. To get them fully crisp turn and put them under the broiler for a minute or two. Next time will add more spice; DH wants to try cooking them on our pizza stone. Be sure and serve with guacamole or some other dip; salsa alone didn t cut it.

Was not pleased with this recipe very bland. Perhaps using leftover shredded chicken even from the deli would enhance the flavor. I added my own spices with chili pwder cumin garlic etc. and added green chilies. If you spray them with a bit of Pam they crisp up nicely and kept them from just being dried. Still easy but this way flavorful.

Loved this recipe! It was incredibly easy required very little time and ingredients and best of all tasted great! I already had leftover chicken breasts so I just chopped those up and then I used taco sauce instead because that's what I had. Also used quite a bit more taco sauce than was recommended for tabasco sauce.

Great flavor and easy to make. I decided not to use the canned chicken we have fresh in our back yard. After a little plucking and some knife work I took my fresh chicken breast seared it in cast iron and tossed it in the oven. After baking the chicken breast we shredded the meat and returned it to the pan added 1 cup of water and diced chipotle peppers. slow cooked until tender and added it to the tortillas. Spicy fresh and so simple to make. Only down side to the way I cooked it does take more time to get the meat slow cooked and shredded.

Used chicken thighs simmered for 2-3 hours with spices. Shredded this and mixed with salsa and enchilada sauce and grated cheese. Used small flour tortilla shells; spread a layer of refried beans; then chicken mixture. Placed on parchment paper; either spread melted butter or Pam on top. Add more grated cheese just before taking out of oven (can broil to melt cheese)

I've never made taquitos in my life but I wanted to try it. I didn't use chicken I used left over beef that I made the night before in my crock pot. I shredded it stuffed it in some corn tortillas put them in the oven for 25 minutes at 375. I made some guacamole added some lettuce and tomatoes on the side with some sour cream and my child was in heaven! I will be making them again believe me! But instead of corn tortillas I will use my homemade flour tortillas:)

Easy to make! I used chopped leftover roasted chicken. Be sure to only heat the tortillas the first time until they are no longer damp. I heated 6 at a time 3 each in 2 large non stick skillets turning them over once. I had been told to use an oiled skillet to fry them at the end. That worked as long as you don't try to turn them too soon and they fall apart but the oven idea sounds better!

I hate boiled chicken so I baked mine with salt and pepper) in my oven for 30 min at 400. When it was finished I cut into cubes and mixed it with the hot sauce some cumin and a few tablespoons of sour cream. To assemble the taquitos I sprayed them with water and warmed each side on a heated pan. Based on other reviews I spread some butter on top of the taquitos so the tops wouldn't get to hard. Next time I will add more seasoning something else in the filling to make it less dry and maybe bake them longer at a lower temp so they aren't quite as crispy.

This was okay for me definitely needs a little tweaking. The flavor wasn't great actually it just didn't have too much flavor for my family's liking. It needed more kick to it. Plus mine came out really crunchy and dry. I watch them carefully but still pretty hard like stale hard. I would make them again but definitely change things up a bit.

I make these all the time. The only variation I make is I also add a can of tomatoes & chilies to the chicken and cheese in addition to the hot sauce. And I use a lot more hot sauce (taste preference). This combo makes up approximately 21-24 tightly rolled taquitos which serves my family as a meal with a side of Spanish rice and leaves enough leftovers for my husband's lunch the next day. Great recipe! Thanks

The recipe prepared as written is a very simple but bland recipe. I ended up adding taco seasoning and sour cream in order to jazz it up but it still needs something like green chiles or salsa in order to really bring out the flavors. All in all not a bad recipe just needs to be tweaked and it would be a really great substitute for tacos. Thank you for sharing as this was a wonderful place to start for my family dinner tonight.

Very easy to make. I cooked my own chicken though. They were a bit on the bland side. I will add some spices next time to kick it up a notch...but a great base recipe! Thank you 5/29/14 Update: After boning out a leftover roasted chicken I had approx 4 cups chopped chicken. I added about 1/3 cup sour cream 1 Tbls taco seasoning and increased the hot sauce and cheese accordingly. These were THE best! I froze the leftover taquitos for another meal.

Exactly what I was looking for! I wanted to get out of the mess of frying taquitos. I wanted a simple BASIC taquito recipe. To get mine even more crunchier I swept over them with oil and turned it up to 425 degrees for the last 10 minutes of cooking time. Thank you for posting this simple but lovely recipe!

The filling was good however We thought the corn tortillas were a little too dry & tough following this recipe like it is next time I make these I will either fry the corn tortilla first or the whole taquito since that's always good. I will also try them with flour tortillas I think flour will not be as tough after baking.

Good but I felt like I should've sprayed the tops with cooking oil to make it crispier and the recipe didn't say anything a dip which I feel like it should suggest. These baked taquitos can be a bit dry if you don't have a fairly wet dip like Sour Cream or Guacamole. Luckily we had garlic mayo on hand which worked well once we put some Tapatio hot sauce into it. We also made some more garlic mayo by using a garlic press to put fresh garlic into regular mayo. My family also thought that putting some vegetables into the chicken-cheese mix like onions or even green onion might have been good. I'll probably try that when I make these again tomorrow.

Flash cook tortillas in hot oil and they will oven crisp really well. If you have time poach or bake chicken canned should be a last resort (just finely chop or shred). Softened cream cheese is a good add-in also chopped green chilies with a Mexican blend grated cheese (stir all together in a large bowl). Serve with a salad and heated dipping salsa or taco sauce. Any left-overs are good for breakfast with scrambled eggs.

The technique is great but I thought that it was a little dry and bland. I made these again with cumin chili powder minced jalepenos and sour cream mixed in with the chicken - that did the trick for me.

Excellent! Loved the crunchiness achieved by baking. Didn't miss the grease one little bit. This is my new go to quick recipe. I know I'm going to stuff these with all kinds of combinations including leftovers.

Tried this as a last minute dinner idea tonight. Gave it 4 stars for the overall idea. As others have I added some spices (cumin onion powder garlic powder pepper and a pinch of cayenne) as well as saut√©ed onion and garlic. I sprayed a baking sheet with non-stick spray and sprayed the taquitos as well. They crisped nicely in the oven as described in the recipe. Family LOVED it!

Great basic recipe to use up leftover meat. I used leftover pot roast shredded added salsa and canned Mexican tomato sauce w/jalape√±o. Heated corn tortillas on stovetop put filling in rolled up and baked. Very very good! My family loved this less greasy version!

Great as written! I used a 10 oz leftover grilled chicken breast and forgot to add the hot sauce but this recipe could tolerate the changes and still be easy and delicious.

I‚Äôm not fond of canned chicken, so I cooked 2 chicken breasts in the slow cooker during the day. Then I shredded them and, per other reviews, added a can of diced green chiles, a big dollop of sour cream, a big dollop or two of salsa, cheese, and hot sauce. I baked them 40 minutes in a 9x13 as the recipe recommended. Next time, I will spread them out on a silpat on my jelly roll pan so they don‚Äôt touch. I think they will crisp up better on all sides. The recipe as written is a good base recipe but needs more flavor. I love the way I made it. This is definitely a keeper!
