An Excellent rich dense cake. This is great for a hostess gift. I topped mine with sugared pecans, and baked in a springform pan to enhance presentation. Also, I extended the baking time by 15 minutes. Got great reviews from all who tried it. Definitley a keeper.

This recipe was really delicious.  The only change I would make would be to bake it longer.  When I followed the baking time in the recipe the center came out raw.

This receipe was good. Infact it tastes better the second day. I had no problem with the baking time that the receipe called for. I didn't put the quarter in. Also, after I inverted the cake on the cake rack, I inverted again to a cake plate so the nut sugar mixture was showing on top. What a nice presentation.

This is definitely an old world recipe.  The cake is a coarse texture and is not sweet like you expect a cake to be.

Made this potential family annual tradition in a springform pan which eliminated the tricky inversion process.
Also substituted a whole almond for the lucky quarter (which would have required pre-santitizing).

My teacher is Greek and brought this in to celebrate the new year. My friend got the quarter, but I still ate the cake! It was really good and apparently kid friendly. I might have to make this for my family!

I served this for our New Year's brunch.  It looked pretty and we all really enjoyed it.  My 10 inch pans were on loan so I baked it in a tube pan for a total of 50 minutes.  If you are expecting a sweet, fluffy dessert cake don't make this however if you appreciate a firm not-too-sweet European cake this recipe is for you.  My Greek husband says you need to cut a piece for Saint Basil!

Made this cake for New Year's gifts for neighbors and it was fantastic! I used two 6" round pans and it looked just beautiful. Bake time was still about the same, although I did the sugar/almonds at about 18 minutes instead of 20 so they would stick better. Thought sliced almonds looked prettier than slivered as the recipe listed. Enjoy!

My brother and I made tihs together on New Years Day and it turned out very well!  The cake is dense and moist, and delicious.  Next time we agreed to try with some almond extract in the batter, or maybe orange zest to change it up a bit.  In our oven, it needed to bake for a longer period of time, though, so keep checking it for doneness.  Hronia Polla!

I followed this recipe exactly and the cake was completely raw (meaning LIQUID) inside when I took it out of the oven.  I cooked it another 30 minutes and the cake was still soft and a bit runny in the middle even though the top was starting to turn a bit too brown.   The flavor of the cake is very good, though.  The temp and cooking times just need adjusting.

This came out very well.  We shared with some friends and they loved it!  It is a very plain coffee cake and that is really what makes it so good.  I left off the almonds.

I've been using the same Vaselopita recipe for years, passed down from my yiayias yiayia but this year I had to make one fast instead of the old fashion way.  Your recipe by far came out so much better!  My kids loved it and my guest asked where did I get the recipe. Delicious. Thanks for sharing.

Apparently, this is the real thing. The greek inlaws (from Crete) absolutely raved about it. So esay to make and really delicious. I recommend it to anybody - especially if you have greek relatives you want to please. It sure worked here.

It was fantastic, although I did add almond extract to the batter for a more almond-y flavor.  It was a big hit at the New Years party!  I did substitute a whole almond for the coin due to excessive drinking on New Years :)  I originally put it in a springform pan but it started to leak in my oven!  In a pinch I put it in a bundt pan, which turned out just fine.  Excellent cake, not too sweet, needs no icing but would be good with an almond flavored glaze.  Happy baking, and eating! :)

Sooooo good and so easy to make! All of the ingredients are ones that I typically have which makes it even more appealing to me. I did not have almonds so I chose to add a little almond extraxt to the cake and oh my word it is so yummy! The cake is somewhere between a pound cake and angel food cake. I know that sounds crazy but its true. It is dense but yet its still quite fluffy. Will definitely be making this again! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe :-)

A wonderful cake!  I used a bunt pan and put a quarter wrapped in foil in the cake prior to the last 20 minutes of baking.  Used bottled lemon juice instead of squeezing a lemon.  Cooking time as listed worked well.  The sugar and slivered almonds ended up on the bottom of the cake when removed from the bundt pan and looked great on the cake plate.  I added a cake glaze with almond flavoring over the top and sprinkled it with sliced almonds.  Everyone loved the cake and ate every last piece to find the good luck coin!  Great fun for a group!

This recipe was a disappointment. My mother always made Greek New Year's bread so I thought a cake might be a new tradition. The cake tasted exactly like a pound cake, it was quite dry too. If I tried it again, I would add less flour and "kick it up a notch" with some lemon zest, almond extract ...

I can't rate it from personal experience because I made this for my daughter to take to school. She didn't get a slice either because everyone else scarfed it down. That must mean it's pretty good! I made it in a bundt cake pan and just shoved a whole almond into the cake instead of a quarter as someone suggested.

I made this tonight, to be served tomorrow when the in laws come over. I will update this after I've tasted it. I will say that I had to bake it an extra 30 minutes before the middle was cooked. I wrapped my quarter up in tin foil and tossed it into the cake after 20 minutes when I sprinkled the sugar and nuts on the top. Hopefully it hasn't  sunk to the bottom!

I made this for New Year's Day and everyone loved it, both kids and adults. I put the almonds on half of the cake since some of the kids won't eat nuts. It baked through in 55 total minutes in a 10" springform pan. I had slivered almonds and not sliced but otherwise I made no substitutions. I'd definitely make this again and I'd like to try adding fruit of some kind, maybe mixed berries over the finished cake. The ingredient assembly process was fun, I thought, and different from any other cake recipes I've made.

I made this for an after dinner desert after a fondue party.
Most invitees thought it was good.
It is a very plain somewhat dense cake
One of my kids told me it was a "hit"!
Do not use Pam to line the cake pan as the cake will stick, use regular butter or margarine.

Great recipe, I modified it a bit by adding a teaspoon of almond extract to the batter,adding half a cup of evaporated milk and half a cup of heavy whipping cream instead of the cup of milk, and I made icing instead of using powdered sugar. I made the icing my using a can of sweetened milk, a quarter cup of heavy whipping cream, and a half cup of evaporated milk, then I added a teaspoon of almond extract. I boiled and stirred the ingredients until it became thick enough to glaze the cake, and I applied it as I would have applied the sugar then topped the cake with almonds.

I ended up making it in bundt cake version because my cake pan was too small, but it came out wonderfully!  My kids love it, and I think we are starting a new New Year's Day tradition.  I used a whole raw almond for the good luck charm, which has yet to be recovered, but my kids love trying to get it with each piece.  An excellent, easy recipe I'm so grateful someone thought to share.  Thank you, Paul!

I made this the other night. Here is what I found. I had a 9 inch pan so I ended up making a 9 inch round cake and a loaf pan cake because I had way too much batter for just one cake. One I made pretty much as the recipe calls. Only difference I made, was that I had some vanilla sugar and I used that on top with the almonds. Second cake I had some chocolate sugar and I put that on top. It sort of looked like poppy seeds. People liked the cakes. i made signs so people would know there was a quarter in side. My step daughter 'managed' to find both of them. think she dug through the second cake. Tastes like a pound cake. Nothing fantastic, but my step daughter was thrilled to pieces. Worth making especially if you have kids.

Very good! I usually wash the coin then seal it in foil and just stir it in the batter before I bake it. Next time I'll add orange juice and zest instead of the lemon.

My husband is from Greece and loved this cake. He asked me to make it again this year. I wish I could find the picture from last years cake it was very pretty. I just sprinkled sugar and  pomegranate seeds on top.

a little dry, I added some almond paste to it, helped a bit, this recipe actually makes 2 round cake pans if you care to split it up, a little marzipan would help even more with added flavor

This was very good. Being part Greek, it was fun to try it. Be sure to watch your pan size, thought my 9" round pan was a 10", and it ran over in the oven, otherwise it was good. I will do it again next year, using a different size pan.

This was my first vasilopita, so I wasn't sure what to expect. It was delicious, essentially a pound cake. I saw that many reviewers  noted it took much longer to bake than the recipe called for, so I decided to be clever and make it in a two-part tube pan like you make angel food cake in. I figured that the hole in the center would help it bake through in the time given. Well, sort of. instead, as many reviewers stated about the springform pan called for, the batter leaked out. (Fortunately, in case of that, I had placed the pan on a parchment-lined baking sheet, so no mess in my oven). 
But what DID happen was that the leaking batter went up the center of the tube, making its own mini-cake. Perhaps because of the leaking, the cake was not as tall as I hoped. At least we got the mini-cake to taste-test before taking the full-cake to a New Year's brunch! The cake got good reviews, and I will make it again.  
Aside from the pan, the only thing I did different was to grate a little orange zest into the batter. Next time I think I will use a Bundt pan,  and will dust with powdered sugar rather than granulated.

It was really good! I made it in a Bundt pan. I did need to bake it longer, about 15 minutes.  But I didn’t think it was dry, and it was plenty sweet.

Thank you for this lovely recipe.

I made this in a large round stoneware baker which was a perfect size, but I needed to give it some extra baking time, which made it a tad dry.  It makes quite a large cake, great for breakfast with jam and coffee.  I agree with another reviewer that it was moister the second and third days.  I would make it ahead.

I made this to bring in the new year! I did make a substitute as I didn’t have lemon juice. I added 1 teaspoon of almond extract and topped with powdered sugar. Does need to be naked longer as suggested by others. Delicious!

Eating a second piece of this cake as I type and WOW is it delicious! My Yaya used to make the New Year's cake for us, so I decided to give it a go.  I remembered the cake as being kind of dry and tasteless, so I didn't expect much from this cake, but how wrong I was. This cake is like a pound cake - moist and soooo good. The only change I made was to exchange finely chopped pecans for the almonds because I didn't have almonds.  This is a FABULOUS recipe - a keeper that will go into my little book of recipes that I love. Happy New Year 2019!!

Moist  dense and delicious. Added orange zest and vanilla. No nuts. Cooking time as directed. It's a keeper. Can't have only 1 slice. Thank you!I tried to add a photho but can't.

Its perfect! The only thing I did differently was that I switched the lemon juice with limoncello liqueur.  And made a glaze with powdered sugar and the liqueur.

Very nice! I was trying to make a traditional Spanish "bizcocho" and this recipe reminded me of my mother-in-laws. I like that it's light and not super sweet. Next time I will definitely try it with the slivered almonds. Perfect to enjoy with coffee and family! :)

This was an impressively easy and delicious cake. I liked that it wasn’t u we sweet and that it baked up so nicely. I followed directions almost to the letter, using cashew milk instead of regular and crushing cinnamon toasted almonds instead of blanched and sliced. I also didn’t have a sanitized quarter and was worried about kids not paying attention so I used a few raisins instead. It was great! The whole family enjoyed this cake and only the sweetest of sweet tooth’s didn’t eat it all. I had to extend the baking time by 20minutes but should have done 15 as the edges were a bit drier than the rest. Delicious though and something I’ll continue making..very tasty and fun for the new year :).

I love this cake and it’s fun to make! I’ve made it three times and it turned out great every time. I did add 1/2 teaspoon almond extract even though I like it without also, used a springform pan as it rises that high, I put it on a cookie sheet as it did leak just a tad, baked it 65minutes.

It didn't turn  out like the picture...it's more yellow because it contains 6 eggs. There was WAY too much batter for one pan and it ended up spilling over into my oven. lol All in all though, nice tasting coffee cake.

I'm really glad I decided to make this before we had company. There are two chemical reaction mixtures that get added to the batter. My reactions got a little crazy and everything expanded in the oven, over filled the pan and caused a huge mess BUT the cake tastes very good!

I made this yesterday. Loved the texture and as others have said, not too sweet.  I may have liked a bit of vanilla in it. I put a dime in the cake. My Mom used to put a dime in the cake for our birthday cakes when we were younger. And once in a while it was two nickle. SMiLE. I always thought it was a German thing, but maybe there was a Greek influence.

I thought I would make this as a surprise for my husband, whose father is Greek.  My husband hadn't heard of the tradition before but enjoyed the cake any way.  I topped it with a powdered sugar glaze, which gave it a little more moisture around the edges.  It is a very dense cake but we loved trying to figure out which slice had the quarter.  It was a fun way to ring in the 2009 with a new family tradition for us!
