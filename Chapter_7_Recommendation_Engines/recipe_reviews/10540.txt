This is one of the best recipes for shortbread.  I have used it for years and also my daughters - so I guess it is a family favourite!   Thanks for submitting it because it really is excellent.

Love this recipe and have used it many times. It says fruit sugar, it is also called Rapid Disolving Sugar. For a twist here's a few things I've tried. 
1) add 2 tsp vanilla.
2) add mini semi or dark chocolate chips or mint chocolate chips.
3) before baking decorate with, coloured sugar, chocolate chips, sprinkles, dried fruit or nuts(pecan, walnuts etc).
4) if cooking in a pan, try scoring the dough before cooking in the shapes of the bars you want. Making a large amount? Try spreading if to fill a cookie sheet. Perfect thickens and flat on both sides. The scoring can make them break apart with the tap of a knife on the line.
5) make these often? Try a shortbread Mold. Lee Valley Tools has one for around $40 CAN with the traditional thistle pattern.

This has become a Christmas favorite that I can't keep for long in the cookie jar! I tend to roll little balls and flatten with a decorative clay mold. melts in your mouth.
