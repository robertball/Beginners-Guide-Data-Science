This was a very good recipe!  I found it easier to smash the Rice Krispies down into the muffin pan by using a spoon sprayed with Pam spray.

Rich and delicious, but no way does it make 24!  My family got 8 out of this because it didn't even fill the entire 8 inch pan.  I suppose you could squeeze 16 out of there, but why not just double it and make more!  It's very, very good!

These are so good!  I added 2 cups of melted chocolate to the top because we like extra chocolate.  Thanks for the recipe! :)

These are really rich and yummy. I used a 24 cup mini muffin pan. I put a scoop in pushed it down with a spoon (with Pam sprayed on it) I had to double the recipe to get 24. I think next time I will triple it. These are small enough to send in to my children's school for a birthday treat. I will make this again.
