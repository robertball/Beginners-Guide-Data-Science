Technically fine but way too boring for my family. It was visually unappealing but it improved when I removed the foil and cooked for an addl 15 mins.

I LOVE this recipe!  Have made it several times.  It is so easy, healthy and delicious, can't get any better than that!  I add more veggies because we like veggies in my house and I cut the rosemary in half (not huge fans of rosemary)

DH immediately stated "THIS is a keeper!"  
Had some leftover fresh, slice mushrooms, so I added those just to get rid of them.  Also added about 1/2 c water so there were more juices.   
Oh, and all I had was a package of boneless chicken breasts.  Next time I will make it with bone-in, as the flavor is always better.
Otherwise, as my dear departed mother would say "I followed the recipe exactly".
Nice, easy recipe, Emily!

Delicious, juicy, tender and flavorful.

Amazing recipe! I've made this many times. The clean-up is the easiest and takes no time to prep. One of my go-to supper dishes now as it's super easy and healthy, not to mention delicious! I use an Italian herb blend in place of the basil and rosemary. My apartment smells amazing right now!

Very plain.  Plus it says total cooking time at the top is 30 minutes. But the recipe  says 45 to 50 minutes. Well the veggies needed 1 hour and 10 minutes to cook.  So just keep that in mind when cooking this. It wasn't bad it was just really plain.

This reminds me of the campout meals we made in 4-H when I was so young.  This was better than those tho'.  I will make again, maybe with out the foil - just slow simmer in a non-stick pan.  Easy prep, comforting food.  A keeper.

Amazing recipe, very juicy, pulled bone right out, and full of flavor. Followed the recipe to the T. I made two whole chickens and on the second one followed recipe but added fresh lime juice and cilantro to it...

Love this recipe! It's so quick to throw together and with lots of veggies becomes a great meal. I did bake it uncovered for a while.

Excellent-loved this easy recipe. Tasted great even though I forgot the onion. Increased the seasonings a little and cut the veggies smaller, cooked for 50 minutes and YUM.  Will make again.

Easy to make but totally BLAND!  It's simply tasteless chicken that when you remove the aluminum foil off after 45 minutes in the oven looks like boiled chicken. No color to it, had to broil it for 15 minutes to get it to a golden color plus added some extra seasonings prior to broiling to give it some taste.

Actually very tasty, the whole family enjoyed it.  I wonder though about the fat content, as the chicken cooks in it's own fat.  Maybe not a once-a-week choice for dinner.

I love the taste of this, but both times I've made it I've had to add an extra 30 minutes of cooking time because the veggies weren't done. I followed the directions exactly, but it ended up not being done. I wonder if covering it with foil, or venting a corner, is the problem? When I cook it for the extra 30 minutes I take the foil off completely because the chicken seems too soggy, we like the skin crisp.
