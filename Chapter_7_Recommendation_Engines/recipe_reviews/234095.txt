I've never had German Kartoffel before, so I don't really know how it's supposed to taste.  But we do like many different types of potato salad, and this will be added to our list (just in time for Oktoberfest).   Spritzer, thanks for a nice new recipe.

Very nice, light and fresh tasting. I did add somewhat over a tablespoon German mustard,it added a tasty pop. Will make this again, may try red or Yukon gold potatoes next time.

Both my wife and kid enjoyed this and my wife is a very finicky eater.   I pretty much followed this recipe to a T except that I added a little bit more pickles and a little less miracle whip.  I used 1/8 cup mayo and 1/8 cup miracle whip.  Instead of whisking the vinegar, etc in the mixing bowl, I put those in a separate little bowl and added it to the potatos after putting them in the large bowl.  I also peeled and largely cubed my potatos before boiling them.   Instead of chilling the salad in the fridge for an hour, I ran cold water over the potatos and then let them sit to room temp.   The recipe still turned out great.

This is a good basic starter recipe. It can function as a hot potato salad or a cold one. I like cold for convenience so I did it that way. My changes: I added chopped kosher dill pickles and a bit of chopped celery for texture. Then I added a splash of pickle juice and a teaspoon or so of spicy mustard and a bit of cayenne pepper to spice it up. My granddaughter likes everything German so this one is for her.

Very bland taste. I added ground mustard and some olive oil and it tasted better. Would not make this again

just beware that when you change the serving size, the gherkin amount goes crazy nuts. 13 cups for a serving size of 4?
