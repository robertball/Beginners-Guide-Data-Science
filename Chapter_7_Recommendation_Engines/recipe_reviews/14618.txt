I only gave this recipe 4 stars for several reasons.  I loved the addition of the cola.  And the recipe is very easy to make.  It makes the house smell great!  And it is TASTY!  But…
1.  This recipe does not serve 16 people; it serves 6-8.  An experienced cook will know that, but a new bride preparing her first dinner party may not.  2.  Three carrots to serve 6-8 people?  I used a pound of baby carrots.  I also added a medium sweet onion, quartered and separated.  3.  The meat definitely needed a meat rub.  I use Lysander’s™ All Natural Meat Rub.  4.  To make the gravy, try using a can of Campbell’s™ Golden Mushroom Soup thinned with the drippings from the roast and use Gravy Master™ or Kitchen Bouquet™ to brown.

BEER INSTEAD OF COLA.  This a great recipe. I like to make it with a a bottle of beer instead of cola. Also add a good sized sweet onion quartered (or smaller if it is a large onion). Add four or five red potatoes, quartered, with skin on. Increase carrots to six. Dust with flour and salt and pepper and braise on hot stove with a little olive oil before putting in the pot. Cook in crock pot for four to five hours on high, or eight hours on low. Add more beer if not enough liquid.

Don't let the "cola" scare you away from this recipe.  In the past, every single time I add coke to a meat recipe (usually pork) it comes out sooo tender, which was the case here as well.  I used a pepsi, but I did pick up on the sweetness (I drink diet coke, so maybe that's why & I'm not a pepsi fan either) but my family RAVED about how good this was and didn't make mention of any sweetness so it was probably me.  For ease I stuck this all in the crock pot on high for 4 hours.  I also used cream of celery soup because that is all I had on hand & then added chopped mushrooms instead of the chopped celery.  Thanks Sher, will use again, my family kept saying how good it was ;o)

I've made this several times, and we love it! I use Lipton's Beefy Onion soup mix and omit the gravy mix. I use the crock pot and add cornstarch about 20 minutes before the end if the gravy isn't thick enough. This is soooo delicious with mashed potatoes and "J.P's Big Daddy Biscuits" from this site. If there are leftovers I stir in a healthy dollop of sour cream and cooked mushrooms and serve over egg noodles for another meal. YUM!

This recipe is fantastic! Served to company tonight who said this was the "best meal ever." Served with mashed potatoes, asparagus, spinach/orange/radish/green onion salad, and garlic bread. As recommended, I inserted garlic slivers into meat before browning lean chuck roast for extra flavor; and added sliced baby portabella mushrooms, extra carrot and celery. I decreased recipe amount to serve six and, rather than adjusting soup, cola, and mixes, I used full can of soup, full package of gravy mix and onion soup mix, and a small bottle of Classic Coke. Gravy was superb and meat was fork tender and not stringy. Company asked for recipe which I gladly provided. Will definitely make again for family and company.

This was great. I fixed it in the slow cooker for 10 hours and used the whole pack of gravy mix. I also set it up the night before and let it set in the refrigerator to marinate. I don't normally like pot roast, but I will definitely make this again

Excellent in a slow cooker!  I used the entire can of cola (12 oz.) and added ground cumin to the gravy mixture.  I rubbed the roast with grilling spice and added chopped up potatoes in the slow cooker.  I cooked it on high for 4 hours, then sliced the roast and placed it back into the slow cooker for 1 hour on low heat.  It turned out moist and delicious!

This was really wonderful!!  I have cooked with "colas" before and I guess I am always surprised when people are surprised when it can be used as an ingredient.  Cola is no more than sugar and coloring...add a few more items and you have BBQ sauce:)  At any rate, this roast came out tender and juicy.  I cooked mine in my crockpot (mainly because I work during the week) and I was totally pleased with the results!  If you are looking for a thick gravy, you will need to make a slurry of cornstarch and water, pouring it into the juice until you get the desired thickness.  This was a tender and flavorful way to make a roast with ease.  Thanks for sharing...this will become a part of my recipe box!

This was wonderful and the recipe is very versatile. My husband said that this was one of those wonderful meals that reminded him of his grandmother. And I'm a very good cook and cook a lot so he's used to good food - so this was the ultimate compliment.

I "pantry cook" with whatever I have on hand so changes I made were: used more carrots, no celery, used a packet of McCormick Pot Roast Seasoning rather than brown gravy and onion soup mixes. I used two tri-tip roasts for a total of 3.5 pounds and rubbed them with kosher salt, pepper, and herbs, then seared in olive oil. Placed them in a crockpot, added all the other stuf as directed, cooked on high for 2 hours and then low for another 7. After that I ladled a good amount of the liquid into a saucepan and stirred in a bit of flour water, cooking over med-high heat until gravy was thickened. Served with brussel sprouts and Mom's Zucchini Bread (from allrecipes.com) Delicious!

Ok, I made this last night but with several changes so here goes...and by the way it was deeelish! For the roast I used a California pot roast, about 3 pounds, as the lady in the meat dept where I shop suggested it for slow cooking.  She was so right!  I didn't have carrots on hand so I just eliminated and served with mixed veggies. I didn't use the celery either, just didn't want celery in it and I also did not use the gravy packet. The onion soup mix is very flavorful and the soup and soda mixed together with that did the trick! I used a full 12 oz can of coke and left the water out, didn't need it. I put 5 potatoes, skinned and cut up into 1 inch chunks on the bottom, roast on top of that and poured the soups, soda, mixture over the top. I also put the garlic directly on top of the roast so the flavor would seep in. This made an awesome gravy when the roast was done and the meat was sooo tender and soft. Had plenty of gravy, which did not need to be thickened at all. The starch from the potatoes works as a thickening agent so it worked out great!!! I slow cooked this for 4 hours on HIGH and it was PERFECT!!! Will def make this again and will use the carrots next time too! Just to give you an idea on how great this was..my family was actually looking for more meat when we were done!! They said they could have eaten this allll night! Hope this helps! Happy cooking :)))

I used a 3# chuck roast that I coated with flour, montreal steak seasoning and garlic powder and then browned in a pan with olive oil on both sides.  I didn't have any brown gravy mix or celeery so I just used the full 12 oz of coke, can of mushroom soup and onion soup packet.  I added carrots and mushrroms and cooked in the crock pot for 8 hours on low and added some yukon gold potatoes for the last 2 hours.  I love that there is a ready made gravy as soon as it's done.

It was delicious!  It fell apart and was so tender.   My three boys said it was the best pot roast I have ever made!  Will definitely make again.

This was very good - definitely tasty, but I wouldn't say the best I have ever had.  I cooked everything in crock pot on low for about 10 hours while I was at work.  I used baby portabellas and a whole onion in addition to the carrots (which I used about 3/4 bag of baby carrots) and celery.  I was a little concerned about lack of liquid, so once everything was in the crock pot, I threw a little splash of water in there.  There was lots of "juice" to work with in the end and it was quite flavorful.  I added another envelope of brown gravy mix, as I like my gravies super rich and, yes, a little salty.  Even so, everyone thought the gravy and veggies were perfect, despite the addition of more gravy mix.  I would make this again the same way, but will probably add some peas at the end of cooking.

I have made several pot roasts and this recipe made the meat VERY dry! The gravy mixture was excellent but the meat was too chewy.

I made this exactly as written, except  thickened the gravy with a little cornstarch after removing the roast. The meat wasn't dry at all. My boyfriend said to give it "5 1/2 stars, especially the gravy."

This roast was so delicious.  I doubled the amount of gravy and cooked it in my slow cooker for 8 hrs on low (or 4 on high would work too). I cooked my potatoes and carrots separately, as I don't like them mushy.  I modified it slightly... extra garlic, half cream of chicken and half cream of mushroom soup, beefy gravy mix, and beefy onion soup mix.  The result was a tender, tasty roast with a little sweetness. The gravy was perfect, just the consistency we like. My whole family loved it, toddlers and teens alike! It's now a staple of ours.  Thanks so much Sher!

I have a super sore tooth, between the antibiotics and the painkillers, I was just looking for an easy meal to make my family, they've been eating take out and tv dinners for a couple of days, poor guys and I hate for them to eat such yuckola food.  This was perfect!  I was missing so many of the ingredients and still this turned out delicious.  Like so many others, I rubbed the meat with spices (pepper, garlic powder, salt and red pepper flakes) then seared it quickly.  Like I said before, I only had cream of mushroom soup, the onion soup mix, garlic and a small can of cola and that's it.  The smell was enticing and by the time 4pm rolled around, I was so HUNGRRRY.  The sauce is thin, so I made a quickie roux (flour and butter, in a pan over medium heat then slowly poured the sauce in, so so tasty.  This was a super quick and easy meal and even I was able to eat it (very carefully on the not sore side of my mouth), I served it with microwave stuffed potatoes and green beans with cherry tomatoes, recipe on this site, it was plate licking tasty.

Wow, my family isn't big on roasts but this was the best roast recipe I've made from this site, plus the easiest.  I think you could really adapted it to whatever is in your house.  I used the whole gravy packet, 3#s of beef and the whole can of pop, plus some water at the end.  I also didn't have the dry onion soup so I added some dry beef vegtable soup powder instead.  I wanted to cut down the salt so went with low sodium cr. of mushroom soup.  I also stuffed it with garlic and added 3 cloves of fresh pressed garlic and the veggies.   Then I removed the grease and made gravy.  Great recipe just the way it is or use whatever.

Really flavorful! The only thing I changed was I put it in the slow cooker for 8 hours, added babybella mushrooms and onion,used whole bag of baby carrots, then at the 6 hour mark I added cut up potatoes. I also made a roux to thicken the juices to create the perfect beef gravy! My family loved this. I'll definately cook this one for company. Oh yah and a crispy loaf of french bread to dunk. :)

WOW! This roast is FANTASTIC!!! I seasoned the roast with pepper, meat tenderizer and tri-tip rub and seared on both sides. I didn't have any gravy mix, so I omitted that and the water and subbed with 1 c. beef stock. We are not fans of fungi around here so I used cream of celery soup instead. The only thing I will do differently next time is add more veggies and trim more fat as it has a lot of it pooling at the top and will be flavorful enough without the extra calories ;) Thanks for sharing!! YUMMMMM!

This was really excellent.  I first seasoned the roast with a little Steak Seasoning. I also added some quartered mushrooms to the veggies.  I used the entire package of gravy mix, and the consistency ended up being perfect for gravy.  I didn't have to do a thing except remove the bones from the chuck roast I used.  The flavor was better than the recipe I've used for many years.  BTW, I used Diet Cola.  You couldn't tell there's any cola in it, it didn't add any extra calories, and the sugar didn't burn onto my roaster.  Another thing I did was to line the roaster with Aluminum Foil, so clean up was super easy.  This has now become my favorite roast recipe.  Thanks, Sher, for an excellent roast recipe.

My 1 1/2 lb. roast was done in about half the time recommended.  I also added potatoes for the last hour.  My favorite roast uses red wine, but this is the perfect alternative when I don't have red wine on hand - I will definitely make again!  thanks for a great recipe!

Unanimously got 5 stars at my house- even from the most picky of eaters.  The only changes that I made was using rump roast (as it was on sale and how I ended up looking for a pot roast recipe in the first place) adding a can of beef gravy as I didn't have the powdered stuff. I also cooked in a slow-cooker, 3 hours on high then 6 hours on low- adding carrots for the last 3 hours of cooking.  It was DEEEEE-LICIOUS!!!  The meat pulled apart with a fork, the carrots were seasoned all the way the way through and the gravy had a fabulous flavor.  We'll be watching the grocery store fliers for the next rump roast sale so we can have this fabulous meal again.  Perfect for a cold New England night!

I cooked it as instructed, in my roasting pan in the oven and my meat wasn't as tender as I would have liked. I have a tastier recipe for roast that comes out delicious, so I'll be sticking to my recipe. I enjoyed trying something new though. Thanks.

I've never had luck with Pot Roast until this one! It was great. I put a dry rub on my roast and let it sit in fridge overnight. Per other reviews, I seared my roast in a little oil and put in in a crock pot, on low, for 5 or 6 hours. It was ready when we got home from church! I'm diabetic, so I used Diet Soda.  The only reason I didn't give five stars, because the gravy was a little too salty for my taste. Think I'll use another base than brown gravy mix next time. Any suggestion would be great! Also, I used a couple of cans of sliced new potatoes with baby carrots and mushrooms. It was soooo good. Great leftovers - even in tortillas!

Delicious! My husband and family were surprised at how tender the meat became. Words of advice: 1) Never tell anyone what is in it 2) Use a little less cola than they suggest (it is a little too sweet when you put the entire amount in) and 3) sear your meat first to lock in the juices. Try this and you will never go back!

This was wonderful!  My family LOVED it!  I took a knife and made deep punctures in the roast and pushed whole cloves of garlic all over it.  We love garlic and this method flavored it through out the roast.  It also looked really pretty when it was sliced.  If you love garlic, this is a good way to add flavor!

Wonderful!!  I always loved my mom's pot roast until I made this one, this is the best!  Probably made it 12 times in the last year, and I don't change a thing.  Once used a pork roast, but it's better with the beef.  Absolutely melts in your mouth.

BRAVO!!! We made this delightful roast a few weeks ago and it was wonderful... This is the absolute best roast I have ever had. I accidently put in the WHOLE package of brown gravy mix, and intentionally left out the veggies. All that remains of that good old roast is an empty serving platter and fond memories... Be sure to serve with mashed potatoes--so delicious together!!

Thanks for this simple and delicious recipe!  I've tried both sirloin and chuck roasts in this dish, and I've found that the cheaper chuck roast actually has more flavor and is juicier and more tender than the sirloin.  Instead of 1/2 pkg brown gravy mix, we use the whole pkg.  This dish makes a pan full of very tasty gravy, so be sure to make a big bowl of mashed potatoes to go with it!  Thanks again, Sher...my family LOVES this recipe :)

It only took me almost 20 years of marriage to finally get an awesome recipe for pot roast. Made just a couple of modifications. I first seared the roast on all 4 sides in a fry pan with 2 tbs. olive oil about 2-3 minutes per side. I put the roast into a dutch oven instead of a regular pan. Instead of 3 carrots, I used a whole bag (I used fresh carrots, what a difference!). I also added 1 small can of beef broth along with the ingredients to make more of this awesome gravy. This one is a keeper!

The night before, I seared the roast first with steak rub till it was golden.  Then put in 6 carrots, 4 celery, 1 onion, and 2 potatoes in the crock pot, I placed the roast on top, and poured the sauce on.  I ended up using 1/2 pkg of mushroom gravy, 'cuz I didn't have brown gravy, and a whole can of coke.  Cooked it for 8 hours on low.  It turned out very "beefy," and the meat was very tender.  I added cornstarch to the gravy to thicken it, and it was perfect.  Served it to 5 ppl, and it was just enough, maybe not enough?  Good to the last piece.  YUM!

I enjoy sweet stuff, and I enjoy pot roast. But the cola did make it a little TOO sweet, even for me. I followed the directions, although I added a couple chopped-up potatoes and my roast was only around 2 pounds. The gravy turned out pretty good, but it was a little sweet. I WILL use this recipe again, but I'll probably use only half the cola and add some extra water. I rubbed the roast with some seasoning salt, pepper, and garlic powder (I did omit the minced garlic from the recipe beacause of the powder), and the meat was glorious! I seared the roast, popped the veggies and the meat in the slow cooker, covered it with the gravy mix, and cooked it on high for around 5 hours. It all turned out really well, although sweet. Thanks for the recipe! :)

Well, I am afraid to say I chickened out on adding the COKE to the pot...I was afraid it would be to sweet like a few had said.  SO, I just added water(12 0z.)and it came out G R E A T!
One thing that will make it popping with flavor is(and this is the trick) make a few slits and stuff chopped garlic into the roast and season the outside with garlic salt, pepper and GRILLING SEASONING.  Brown the roast in olive oil and then cook in crock pot. YUMMY A+++

Just finished making it, haven't even eaten it yet, but I can already say that all I can taste is CELERY!!  I am preparing to thicken my gravy and I tasted the broth.  Needs LOTS of salt and tastes like nothing but celery.  Hope the family will eat it.  I followed the directions!  If we make it through dinner and I even try to make it again, I will leave out the celery entirely!  

Post dinner, the meat itself did not taste as strongly of celery as the gravy, but the gravy did not shake the strong celery flavor.  With all of the highly flavored ingredients, to have this taste like celery is a big disappointment.  It was okay enough to try again, and the basic ingredients should have been awesome.  Will try again with NO CELERY!!

Made this for dinner tonight and it was absolutely amazing!!! I am not really a big fan of pot roast, but let me tell you I will be sure to make this many more times! I used a 3.5 lb chuck roast and rubbed it with salt, pepper & garlic. I used my crockpot instead of the oven. Did an hour on high and about 8 on low. Added 2 tbsp cornstarch mixed with water for the last 30 min of cooking. Gravy thickened up perfectly! Make sure you Get some crusty bread to wipe that plate clean, it is that good.

This was good. I forgot to turn the roast over, so it wasn't as tender as it should have been. The gravy could have used some thickening too.

OMG, just ate this for dinner and it was soooo good. I did mine in the crockpot since I had to go out, I added fresh mushrooms. I was worried because i didnt have the gravy or onion soup so I put in 3 cube beef bullion, but hubby went to the store and got the gravy and onion soup mix, so I just mixed it with a little cold water and added to the crock about 30 min before it was done. I used garlic powder since that is what I had. It really turned out good and tasty with a hint of sweet. I will make this again. Thanks a ton, dont need to change a thing/

I love this recipe.  I have even used a frozen roast and put it in the crock pot for 12 hours and it still turned out like a dream.  My husband loves this recipe.  I do use baby bella mushrooms instead of celery and add cut up potatoes.  I have honestly never been much of a roast fan and this one just knocks my socks off!

This was so easy and good.  I pretty much followed the recipe.  Added a bit more garlic (4 cloves) and added mushrooms, onions and a large quartered potatoe.  It is so nice to come home from shopping and smell dinner cooking.  This may be my favorite pot roast recipe.

i used cream of celery instead of cream of mushroom because i'm pregnant and the thought of mushrooms makes me gag. i also left out the brown gravy mix but added some fat free beef broth. the end result was a little soupy, but i know i could have added cornstarch if i had wanted to. i couldn't taste the coke, outright, but i will say the roast was delish, falling apart, hearty, flavorful, and it hit the spot. thanks for the easy recipe!

This was just ok.  It tasted like regular pot roast.  I think next time I would add more soda or some brown sugar.  I'm not a huge fan of pot roast, but my husband loves it, so we do eat it a lot in the winter.  I was hoping this would kick it up a notch for me...no such luck.

This was a big hit at my house.  Made just as written and it was just plain yummy!  The sauce was so tasty and different from plain boring pot roast.  I will make again.

This was a good recipe (followed directions exactly) but I prefer to use similar ingredients (beef, onion soup mix, can of soup, can of cola) and put it in the slow cooker.  I thought the beef lacked some flavor but the vegetables were very good.

Perfect, I will not try any other pot roast recipe ever again.
I added mushrooms and peeled diced potatos and put it all in the crockpot on low for 7 hours.  It was so moist we could cut it with a fork and our boys loved it too.

Wow!  What a great and easy recipe.  I have been making pot roast for years and this by far is the best.  The coke (I used diet) gave the gravy a hint of something that you just can't put your finger on.  I made mine in the crock pot on low while I was at work all day.  I put the roast in, poured the sauce over, and put small skin on potatoes cut in half on the top.  When I got home at 5, I took the potatoes and roast out.  Covered them with foil to keep warm and added 3 T of flour to the sauce.  I whisked and turned the crock pot on high for 20-30 minutes to thicken the gravy.  
For the left overs, I shredded the rest of the roast and tossed back into the remaining gravy in my crock pot.  A couple days later I served it over a piece of bread for a hot beef sandwich.  My hubby loved it!

This dish has a great flavor! My roast was a little bit on the dry side, but that was probably the cut of the roast I used. Also, the "gravy" was more like soup in mine, but I just took the left-overs and put them all in one container and pulled the beef apart into pieces (it was effortless because it is so tender) and turned it into a stew for the next day, and it is soooo flavorful. 
The only variations I made were: I browned the roast first, and I used non-alcohol beer instead of cola. Oh, and I used baby carrots and added sliced portabella mushrooms. 5 stars for flavor and tenderness!

Best Roast I've Ever Eaten!  Hands down!!  I even improvised on the recipe.  I didn't leave out the "secret ingredient".  Actually, I used Diet Cola (what I had on hand) and it didn't even leave an after taste.  Ha! Ha!  Definitely a recipe to add to my ever growing box.

Delicious!  I made this in the slow cooker - on low for 8 hours.  It was so tender and flavorful.  I omitted the celery and used the whole gravy packet, as well as substituting cream of celery soup.  Turned out fabulous.  My roast was a chuck roast.  This will be my roast recipie from now on!

Was the family surprised over the "special" ingredient!  They loved it.  I cooked the roast with carrots and potatoes, will add the potatoes later in the cooking stage next time.  We also had mashed potatoes with the delicious gravy to pour over them!  This is the way to cook a roast!

This is a good recipe to convert to gluten free. omit the gravy mix.  you can mix dry onion (or fresh) with beef broth and a tablespoon or two of cornstarch into Progresso's vegetable classic creamy mushroom (it's gluten free). Do you feel it needs salt added? You can drop in a beef bouillon, Herb Ox brand is gluten free.

I tried this on a whim for something different than my usual recipe.  The family liked like this, but I thought it was just okay and, for my taste, too sweet.  My usual recipe is very similar to this but uses red wine instead of the cola and I think the wine adds more depth of flavor.  As other reviewers have said, the roast should really be seasoned and seared beforehand, it really does make a difference.

Impressive! My crock-pot died on me, so I was forced to use my oven and I'm so glad I did. The roast was super tender...perfect. I can't wait to make for company. I used what I had on hand, cream of celery, mushroom gravy mix, and Dr.Pepper. I didn't notice a sweet taste and neither did my kids. Everything was so flavorful!

This is a very good basic recipe and one that lends itself easily to customizing to one's tastes. I think 4 1/2 stars is just about right. It's a bit too plain for me, as written, to be a full 5 stars. I agree with one reviewer who suggested using a dry rub for the roast before placing into the crock pot.  I used Montreal Steak seasoning by McCormack and it was perfect.  I also love a rich mushroom gravy, so I added 1/2 a pound of sliced mushrooms to the mix.  I think that instead of always relying on a plain brown gravy mix, one might amp up the recipe by using a chipotle or a bourbon and brown sugar flavored gravy, for example. The cola does wonders to help tenderize the meat but it does not lend a distinctly sweet flavor, either. Overall, then, this recipe is a true keeper. (By the way, the left- overs made a wonderful pot pie the following day. )

I think the recipe is wonderful. I used a cross rib pot roast. It was a bit tough though. I think I'll try another cut of meat next time. I found this roast had lots of flavor. The gravy was delicious. I will add more veggies next time.

Very, Very good.  One suggestion was to add a little corn starch to thicken gravy.  I recommend doing this.

This recipe is definately a keeper! I have never made pot roast before as I am not much of a beef eater. But this was excellent. I read some of the previous reviews and made these changes. I used cream of celery soup, (we dont like mushrooms) used beef broth in place of the gravy mix and water, I added a handful of red potatoes cut in quarters, a full bag of baby carrots and a quartered onion. I rubbed montreal steak rub on the meat and seared it in oil, then I added it to the crockpot with the liquid ingredients and veggies for 10 hours. Delicious!

I made this as written.  It wasn't actually my favorite.  To us we didn't think the onion soup and the cream of mushroom soup taste went with the sweetness of the cola.  You can definatley taste the sugar and we just didn't care for it as much as leaving the cola out.  I was disappointed because the reviews were so good.  Won't make it this way again.

We liked this a lot. I used the crock pot - 10 hours on low. Followed all other directions. I also rubbed the roast with flour, salt, and pepper, added 1 yellow onion at the start, doubled the garlic and stirred in a bit of corn starch the last 20 minutes to thicken.

Always turns out perfect. I buy low sodium gravy mix and use the whole packet. Tastes great with mashed potatoes and a green salad. The only change I made was cream of potato soup for the mushroom soup.It just seemed the right choice. It's awesome. I have made it with mushroom soup, still awesome. Great for leftovers the next day.

AWESOME!!! Will make this way from now on.  Did a few things different though- had a 2# rump roast so seared it in some canola oil first, then threw in a clove of garlic sliced up and a sweet onion sliced thin, about 8 carrots quartered.  Didn't have brown gravy mix, so I substituted 2 T cornstarch, 1 t gravy master, and 2 T water - whisked it up and added to the soup, soup mix and coke.(regular coke for me)  Cooked 1 hour at 350, reduced to 250 for 45 min., flipped and cooked another 45-55 min- came out PERFECT.  The BEST EVER! THANK YOU!!

For those who are worried about it being too sweet after reading some of these reviews, try using beer instead of cola. My family doesn't like the sweet taste of this recipe when made with cola, but if I use beer, no one stops eating! It's my 2 and 7 year old's favorite meal, and thats saying a lot since they are both very picky eaters. Also, some have mentioned the carrots not being tender enough. I cook this for 5 hours in my crockpot, and prior to putting it all in I boil the potatoes and baby carrots for just a short while to soften them up a bit. Just don't boil for too long or they will get mushy. Based on my family's tastes, this recipe with cola is 1 star, but 5 stars when made with beer!

I made this recipe tonight for dinner. It was amazing. It's just 3 of us so I used a smaller 3 LB chuck roast. I altered it a bit. I used more cola than required. I used 6 oz Pepsi and 8 oz of cherry Coke. I also rubbed roast with a minced glove of garlic and sprinkled McCormick Pot Roast Seasoning on both sides, then browned on top of stove. I added more carrots and celery than called for also threw in 2 potatoes whole skins and all to absorb any extra salt from the seasoning. I adjusted cooking time for the smalller roast. Then used the drippings (strained and added some cream and wonder gravy flour to give the gravy a little thickness). It was wonderful. My family loved it. I will def. use this again. The meat was moist and flavorful, and my DH never new there were mushrooms, he doesn't like them. He raved over how good it was.

This was excellent!  I had a small, 2 pd, boneless chuck roast, so I just adjusted the cooking time.  I used 1 can of condensed cream of mushroom soup with roasted garlic instead of regular cream of mushroom.  I also rubbed the meat with the minced garlic.  Next time, I will use 1/2 can of beef broth (undiluted) in place of the 2 tablespoons water & I will add some small potatoes.  I can't wait to serve this to company.

I have made this twice now.  The first time exactly as the recipe states.  The next time I used the new Campbell's Select Creamy Portobella Mushroom soup.  I liked the texture of the gravy better the second time.  It is delicious either way.  The cola gives it a sweet flavor that my family just loves.  Just one note if you are going to add potatoes, do it at about half way through the cooking time.  Otherwise the potatoes get overdone.  The carrots are perfect added at the begginning.  I also added large pieces of onion.  YUM!!

Super! I cooked mine in the crock pot after searing it, and it came out beautifully. Tender, and the sauce was great. The only change I would make would be to add salt and pepper. I didn't add any until we were at the table, but it gave it the zing it needed. I also ended up adding cornstarch to the sauce/gravy to thicken it a bit. I served it with rice when we were entertaining guests, and everyone loved it.

The bomb!!!  Didn't dice carrots or celery to sprinkle on top, rather put in chunks of them along with potatoes with a little bit of water into a slow cooker and cooked on high for an hour then low for an additional 5 - yum!

Of course it took a long while for us to eat.  End result?  Not good enough.  It had a plain flavor, not too exciting for something that cooked for that long.  The meat was tender, but that was about it.  Sorry, but I will not make it again.

I made it for dinner in the crock pot. Cooked it on high for 6 hrs. Took the meat out(couldn't afford $36 for the sirloin, so got a rump roast) and cut as it said..and it fell right apart. I did make alterations, but only because I like to make one big meal in the crock. I didnt chop the carrots, I added a bag of baby carrots. Also I added some small red potatoes to it. I added a couple tsps of flour to thicken the gravy and had to add salt to the food, because it did lack that..But the pot roast really was awesome and veggies. :) My other half was hesitant...because of the soda..but he loved it. He actually had thirds!

This was just okay. I followed the recipe to a tee.  It didnt do anything for us at all. I even had dreams about what went wrong all night!! Not kidding! The meat was tough, the gravy was just okay. I think it needs to be browned with salt and pepper before roasting. I dont know what the hell happened, but it wasnt that good. I am sticking to my Mom's pot roast recipe from now.  Good old-fashioned onion soup mix kind.

This was awesome! I prefer cooking a roast in a crockpot. To the crock I added 1 pkg onion soup mix and a can of_BUDWEISER BEER_since I didn't have any cola. I cooked on low all day, then removed roast from crock, added some corn startch until it thickened, then served w/mashed potatoes and fresh steamed winter veggies. Everyone gobbled it up!

Very nice flavor, it's a keeper. I used a chuck roast, twice the garlic, and the whole package of gravy. Once the meat was removed from the pan, I poured the gravy thru a strainer into a saucepan (I'd chopped my carrots and celery finely to be used only for flavor, not as a side dish, so they got discarded). I added to that 3 Tbs cornstarch combined with 2 Tbs water, and brought the gravy to a boil to thicken it up substantially. Without the cornstarch it was a little too runny for my taste.

I LOVED this dinner. I made it for my mom and sister. My mom was full of complaints BEFORE she tried it. I used full dip and gravy packets and 10 oz. of Coke. As for the Coke making it sweet--I didn't really taste it, but I'm a Coke drinker. My mom still doesn't know I used Coke and if her meat had been overly sweet she wouldn't have eaten it. I will add more carrots (I think I'll do the baby carrot thing others have recommended), some mushrooms and potatoes to the pot next time. I used a dutch oven in the oven and the meat was very tender. It does make quite a bit of gravy, if I was a more experienced cook I would cooked it down some to thicken (didn't want to mess anything up), but it was very good. Thanks.

Okay, I know 2 stars is low, but the only thing I liked was how tender the roast was. I really disliked the gravy....I think due to the soda in it. I think it would be much better with just water in it. Ive made things before with soda and didnt like it...so I should have known better. I promised my dad I would not make this recipe again.

Like other reviewers, I also cooked the roast in a crock pot but would not do it again in the future because it created a lot of broth, instead of condensing down to a thick gravy.  I used the broth in the mashed potatoes and that was good.  The roast turned out very tender and delicious but I think next time, I will follow the recipe exactly.

I made this recipe for the first time today in my crock pot. I cooked it on low for about 10 hours. Wow was it delicious!!  I used a 3 1/2 pound chuck roast and increased the mushroom and onion soup by half.  My husband raved about it.  He couldn't get over how tender the meat was. I will definitely make this again.  Thanks Sher!

I have been making this recipe for years using a variety of different meats but I have always used water instead of cola.  This is a great touch!!  Loved this roast and from now on, this is the way it's made!! Thanks Sher!!

I just made this tonight and wished i took a picture before my family inhaled it all! This recipe was so easy and had amazing flavor. Like others mentioned, I added several more carrots and tossed in some diced onions as well. I Put it all in the crockpot on high for 2 hours than low for 5 hours (The meat was so tender and juicy). I took out half the sauce and mixed in a little cornstarch/water to make a gravy for the garlic mashed potatoes. This dinner needed some green's so I steamed some fresh green beans and BAM dinner is served!

I made this in the crock pot - low for 6 hours and the meat was falling apart tender. I'm not too sure about the sweetness of the sauce though, I poured the drippings through a strainer into a pot to thicken and had to add salt and instead of pepper I tossed in some Montreal steak spice. I may make this again but if I do I may only add half the can of pop and toss in some beef broth instead to balance it out

Love this recipe. But I have not baked it, I've only tried it in the crock pot. Plus added red potatoes and sweet onion, and replaced the three carrots with a bag of baby carrots.

Used a 3lb inside blade roast, reduced sodium gravy mix and followed the recipe exactly. Removed the grease from the gravy and added cornstarch to thicken (in a pot on the stove). Better than I expected and my son who doesn't like gravy had some and liked it! I want to try this again but with less cola as we found it a little sweet.

I make this all the time and we love it! Sometimes I use the crockppot too. If I don't have onion soup mix I substitute a beef bouillon cube, 1tsp dried onions, 1/4 tsp thyme and it works great.

This was OK. I was looking for something to use up leftover soda and was quick and easy, which this recipe did. The gravy was tasty as were the veggies but the meat did not take on the flavoring at all. It was totally bland.  I use the same cut of meat for all other pot roasts I have made and they comeout tasty, so I do not think it was the meat.  I would make it again in a pinch but will not be a regular on our menu

Very tasty recipe.  Quick and easy to prepare.
My kids, 15 and 13 loved it as well

OMG!!!! This is an awesome dinner. Flavor was great. I did double the last 5 ingredients only because I love gravy. Also added 2 pounds of carrots and quartered potatoes. This was amazing and will keep around for a long time. Thank you for sharing.

Followed the recipe exactly except for I used Beefy Onion soup mix instead of brown gravy mix and put it in the slow cooker instead of the oven. Everything turned out great!! The meat was tender and the cola is indeed the secret ingredient. This one is a keeper.

5+ loved this roast and so did my family.  Just a few mini changes.....used diet cola, golden mushroom soup and used montreal steak seasoning sprinkled all over the roast in place of the onion soup mix which i didn't have.  Put everything in the slow cooker on low for 8 hours. The gravy rocked! Nice and thick and very flavorful. Meat tender. Will make again!

Very delicious.  I took others advice and put in the whole 12 oz. of cola. (I accidentally used cherry pepsi, still tasted great!) I also just threw all ingredients into a crock pot on high for 3 hours, because my meat was still frozen the middle. Then on low for another 4 hours. By supper time it was nice and moist, cut easily with  fork or butter knife.  I added carrots, celery, and red potatoes to the crock pot with about two hours left. Family loved it!

I don't cook in the crock pot much, well, hardly ever actually; however, I wanted to do a roast with coca cola, so I tried this recipe.  I had a difficult time adapting it.  It ended up being in the crock pot about 9 hours and still wasn't nearly as tender as I think a roast should be.  I don't know if that has to do with my lack of crock pot use or the recipe....  It was decent though.  I added less celery and more carrots and tossed in 2 chopped up potatoes.

I love the flavor of this recipe! I stuck mine in the crock pot for 4 hours. 2 hours in I added the carrots (I don't like when they get mushy). Instead of adding potatoes, I did mashed potatoes. I used the gravy from the crock and poured it over my potatoes and meat. I was so yummy! For some reason my meat was tough but I think it may have been the cut of meat! I will defiantly be trying this again!

I followed other's reviews and rubbed the roast with steak rub and browned it before putting in the dutch oven.  I bought a 1.75 pound roast and it was a good size for 2 people.  I didn't change anything else in the recipe, so I have extra sauce (which was delicious!) for stroganoff.

The meat is very tender and the flavor is okay. I normally do not cook with packaged ingredients. I normally use a lot of fresh spices. I could really taste the brown gravy mix and dry soup mix flavor. To me, it had a little bit of a fake taste. Also, as others have stated, the gravy is runny.

Excellent! I have never cooked a pot roast with a Sirloin Roast before and was worried about it being overcooked and dry. I should not have worried. I did season the roast with Montreal Steak Seasoning and sear on all sides before placing it in the roasting pan.  I always add additional vegetables (plus potatoes) and gravy to pot roast to feed my crowd and this worked perfect. Cook time stated in my oven was right on. Thanks for sharing!

Yummy! I have made this several times and now I have it with a few little twists of my own. I leave out the gravy mix and put in beef broth. Also you can use several cuts of beef. Does not have to be sirloin.

Amazingly tender and yummy. I used different veggies and some garlic spice but it was perfect. I cooked it in the crock-pot for 5 hours, one hour on high the rest on low. It filled the house with a wonderful smell

This is the second time I've made this recipe--the first time was good, but this time I made a few changes.  I kept all the original ingredients, but added and extra half pack of gravy mix, 1/2 cup of red wine, some thyme, potatoes, and some beef broth. The extra gravy and the starch from the potatoes thickened the sauce and it made a ton of it(we're gravy people).  This is the first time in a long time I haven't had to thicken pot roast juices after the roast is done.  The soda makes all the difference in the tenderness, although I did cut that back a few ounces--Thanks for the recipe!

This was pretty good.  It could have used some more spices but other than that I wouldn't change a thing.  I did thicken the gravy up with cornstarch and cold water. My 3 kids really enjoyed it as well.

THIS RECIPE WAS ALRIGHT, I REALLY LIKE THE CONCEPT OF THE CAN OF MUSHROOM SOUP, DRY ONION SOUP MIX AND THE BROWN GRAVY MIX. BUT WITH THE CAN OF COKE IT IS JUST TO SWEET.  WOULD NOT USE A CAN OF COKE IN IT AGAIN.

I made this for my family who doesn't usually get very excited about pot roast.  I used Dr. Pepper since it was the only cola on hand.  Also followed the tip of another review and used beefy onion soup.  Needless to say, this was a huge hit and there were no leftovers. Great recipe!

I,too, am very stingy with my 5 star ratings but give one to this.  We just got done with dinner and there are no leftovers!  Didn't tweak the recipe much -- just used diet cola and beer mix -- and used a 2 lb. chuck roast that I browned before roasting, and it was great.  AND EASY!  Will say that that cut and that size didn't need to cook more than 4 hours total for tender and there was PLENTY of gravy.  Won't bother looking for another pot roast recipe.  This is it from now on.  THANKS!!!

Fantastic recipe!  My family and I loved this.  It was very flavorful and melt-in-your-mouth tender.  I followed the recipe except used a whole packet of the brown gravy mix and a whole can of cola, and added potatoes.

This is the BEST roast I have ever eaten... let alone made! Wasn't sweet at all and I used about 12-15 oz. of Pepsi. I stuck this in the slow cooker on high for 4 hours with 1 lb of baby carrots and chopped celery. Also used a whole packet of brown gravy mix. Sauce was very thin, but I added about 1/2 cup of instant potato flakes and that thickened it to the perfect consistency to serve over mashed potatoes. AWESOME meal! Thank you so much for this great recipe!

I only gave this 4 stars because I changed the recipe when I cooked this. I basically used this as a base recipe. I added onions, quartered red potatoes, baby carrots & celery. I mixed onion soup mix w/ cream of mushroom soup & brown gravy mix & garlic with 1 can of beer. poured on top of meat. topped off with 4 bay leaves.used crock pot.

I made this in a slow cooker. It sat all day and when I got home the meat was so juicy and tender. My husband said that this is the best dinner I have ever made and it is his new favorite. At first he wasn't too sure about the cola in it, and I told him it would taste great. I loved it, thanks for sharing!

I used others reviews and used my crock pot, way more easier.  I did change some as other reviews stated. I didn't have any brown gravy so I used some beef broth and cornstarch to thicken it up. I added some onions, fresh mushrooms, baby carrots and potatoes. Yes it did need more flavor though, I will do again, but add some more seasoning to it. My kids and husband liked it. Thanks for sharing.

I've tryed this recipe twice now and have loved it each time.
First time I could've cooked it a little longer, but most of the meat still came out juicy and the flavor was amazing.
2nd time we used a different cut of meat and it was just the most tender flavorful thing ever.
I do leave out the celery and don't use so much coke, I also add in some potatos later on, but other than that, everything else is the same.
Wonderful recipe.. I'm so glad I found it

This recipe was great! The only thing I did differently was put it in my crock pot on low for 8 hours and it came out perfect! Instead of 10 ounces of soda I used 8 because some of the others said it was too sweet, but It tasted great! My husband loved it and he's not a huge pot roast fan! Thanks for the recipe!

I cooked this in the crock pot. I tasted a bit of the gravy right before serving and I found it to be a bit strange, just not a tatse that was appealing to me. In an attempt to fix that problem, I opened a jar of brown gravy and mixed it in and it actually made it taste better. For the cooks who thought the meat was bland, you could try rubbing the roast down with some McCormick seasoning. I never make a roast without it. It gives it great flavor. I don't think I would like to cook another roast again using cola. Some say it made the meat tender, but every roast I have ever made in the crock pot has been just as tender. My family and I enjoyed this, but I think we all like my old recipe better.

I loved this recipe!! I am a "little of this, little of that" kind of cook so of course, I added my own touch. First, I read what others had to say and some mentioned a lack of flavor. So, I used beefy onion soup instead and also added 1/2 can of beef broth. I wanted more of a traditional pot roast so I added diced potatoes and one can of corn  I also cooked this all day in a crock pot for 7-8 hours; the first two hours were on high and then I put the setting on low until the meat fell apart. (With the cook time being so long I receommned adding the potatoes half way though and the corn during the last hour)You may need to double the recipe if you add potatoes like I did. Enjoy!

Made this roast on the weekend, and now again tonight! My family loves it! This time I left out the carrots, celery, and gravy mix. I added a package of beef oxo, and used a little cornstarch at the end. I think the gravy tasted even better this time! I also made egg noodles instead of potatoes this time. And it went over well.  As another person suggested, tried the JP's big daddy biscuits from this site. Best recipe I've tried yet!

All I can say is WOW, I'm actually rating this one before it's even done cooking! It's been in the slow cooker for a few hours now. The smell  is alone is making us go crazy. I have been snacking on it here and there to taste the celery and the gravy. I actually had to add more celery to so there would be some left in there by dinner time. I also added a jar of sliced mushrooms to the it as well. Instead of packaged gravy I made my own from bouillon cubes. I added a parsnip I had in the fridge and a few onions quartered. I will be making some fresh mashed potatoes to use the extra gravy on for sure. If I have any issues with this recipe after dinner tonight I will edit the review to reflect it but from what I can tell this one is a sure winner and will only    deserve more praise.

My husband is a huge pot roast fan, so I'm always on the lookout for a new twist.  This was excellent.  I added chopped potatoes with the carrots.  I'm sure the sodium is out the roof with the mixes and the soup, but the taste is wonderful and the meat was very tender.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I have made this twice, once with a good sirloin roast, the other time with a tougher cut roast and they both turned out excellent. The sirloin roast was tender much sooner then the recommended cooking time so I shortened it. The tougher cut needed the full 5 hours and turned out tender and delicious. My family and guests loved it!

This was incredible! I seared the roast first with cajun spices and garlic rubbed into it. I didn't have any cream of mushroom soup so I used cream of broccoli instead- I know it sounds strange, but we love broccoli. Instead of water I used Dale's liquid seasoning. Everything else I followed to the letter. Let me tell you, it was the best roast I've ever cooked, and I've cooked A LOT of them! A premium recipe that deserves top honors!

This was awesome!  I added onion soup mix, and omitted the cream of mushroom soup.  I also added some pepperoncini peppers and the juice from the peppers.  It was yummy!

This was sooo good!!  Everyone loved it.  I used a rib eye roast which was a little more expensive, but so tender. I thickened up the drippings to make a gravy and served it with mashed potatoes.  The gravy was really good with the chunky carrots and celery in it and I didn't have to add anything else for flavor. It was just right. Definately a keeper.

This was yummy!!! I cooked it in a slow cooker on low for 8 hours. Also added new red and white potatoes and it was a real hit. 
Easy meal. I made it for a large family dinner party and it really made for a stressless evening. Just put it on at 9am and relaxed all day. Then made buns and salad and presto! It is a good thing my family enjoyed it because I am sure to be making this one again and again. Thank you so much to Sher Garfield for sharing this one!

This roast was awsome and even better the second time around.  The only thing i did differently was add some onion.  We will deffinately make this again.  I might decrease the amount of the brown gravy mix.  I am not to big on brown gravy mix, it tastes to much like package gravy mix but otherwise this is awsome. Dont be sceptical about the cola in this recipe because i dont think you can really taste it I just think it helps in tenderizing your meat.  Deffinately recomend this recipe.  Very strong and hearty.

I hate to give this even one star. It was awful. My husband took 2 bites and asked what the heck I did to the gravy that it is nasty. Just the cream of mushroom soup and lipton onion soup mix in a crock pot makes a wonderful gravy without that cola.I do not understand how this has a 5 star rating. Not the way the south makes gravy. I will NOT make this again. Sorry.

This is a fantastic roast recipe.  So very tender and delish.  I used whole package of brown gravy mix (had 4.5 lb. chuck roast) and 14 oz. of regular Coke.  Makes one understand the true meaning of "things go better with Coke."  Definitely a 5 star.

This was good--meat was very tender--but it is not my favorite recipe for pot roast by far.  Seemed very bland--really needs some spicing up.  My favorite crock pot recipe for pot roast remains as follows:  1 can condensed tomato soup; 1 can rotel extra hot diced tomatos; 10 oz Foster's beer; packet of taco seasoning--mix together to make sauce.  Put chuck roast, red potatos, carrots, onions (quartered), celery and drained canned whole tomatos in crock pot--pour sauce over all, cook low for 7--9 hours, depending on size of roast.

WOW!  This was so good.  I followed the ingredient directions to a T.  I cooked for about 4 hours and the result was the most tender roast that I have ever made.  I served with a salad and German dumplings that went perfect with the gravy.   My husband and sons requested that this be the only pot roast recipe I make from now on and I would have to agree with them.  Thank you Sher.

This roast makes a very tasty gravy. I cooked mine in the slow cooker. I used a whole package of brown gravy mix and when the roast was done, I boiled the gravy on the stovetop and added some cornstarch to thicken it. I served with mashed potatoes.

Sooo good.  My bf who says he is a "pot roast conniseuer" said to give this 5 stars.  I adjusted a little for the slow cooker, adding beef broth and I used Diet Coke rather than regular cola.  We added milk and flour to thicken the gravy...  Thanks!

This is the best pot roast and gravy recipe I've ever tried. I didn't have any dry onion soup mix on hand, so I made my own with 4 tsp. instant beef bouillon granules, 8 tsp. dried onion, 1 tsp. onion powder, and 1/4 tsp. celery salt. Excellent recipe. Thanks!

The sauce is quite a change from the ordinary gravy used on traditional roasts, however I thought it was a little to sweet.  I cooked the roast in a crockpot, on the low setting for eight-hours, so the texture was perfect (I don't know if the meat would be as tender if prepared in the oven).  I also poured the remaining gravy/juices from the crockpot into a saucepan and boiled it down to thicken it before serving.  I will probably keep this recipe, only because cooking something with cola is so unusual.  If you decide to make this, be sure to use at least half the packet of brown gravy mix (as noted in the recipe)...and maybe add just a little more to prevent the gravy from being to sweet.

This is good and about the same as the Awesome Slow Cooker Pot Roast from this site.I browned the roast in a pan on the stove and finished it in the crock pot. I think I will stick with the AwesomeSCPR recipe as it calls for fewer ingredients, and no Cola. I didn't think adding Coke and brown gravy mix enhanced the roast, but they surely add calories and sodium. Maybe when it is done completely in the oven it makes a difference in the end product though. Thanks for a good recipe! The leftovers made great beef salad sandwiches!!

After making this recipe you'll agree...using Coca Cola is the ONLY way to make pot roast!!   It's always sooo tender and juicy.  Making this again tonight for the kid who has been hounding me for it.

My family loves this recipe. I make this often and have followed recipe exactly. The only change I have made is once I did not have brown gravy mix but the au jus mix and it tasted just as good! I don't think I'll ever make another pot roast recipe. Very tender, great flavor and easy!

Very good! The beef was very tender and flavorfull. I made it in my crock pot and it took 7 hours (the first hour on high and 6 on low) to get really tender, and I only had a 2 1/3 lb. roast. I only added two carrots at first, then added about 5 more near the end of the time along with some red potatoes and some green beans. The gravy was wonderful, although I felt it needed some added salt. After our dinner, I cut up the remainder of the beef and added a bit more liquid to make it into a nice stew for tomorrow's dinner. Overall a wonderful and very easy recipe!

AMAZING!! Entire family loved it. Made the first time with reg. cola and found it too sweet, now use diet cola and it's excellent. Teenager even commented on how moist the beef was.  Best gravy ever. Thank you for this great recipe.

This was OK. I think the people writing these reviews have never come across a good raost recipe before. Take a chuck roast, cream of mushroom soup, onions and potatoes and roast at 300 for 4 hours and see what a rich, flavorful gravy you will have! Roast will be tender and fall apart.
This one was ok, but I dont like coke and the flavor clashes with the beef gravy.

Meat just fell right off.  Was really yummy.  Would definitely try this one again:)
We do brown the meat first in the pot.  We also like to use extra garlic (cos we love garlic), cubed potatoes, and a whole package of gravy mix (to not waste).

Great recipe!  when i read that there was cola in the ingredients i thought "no way"  but with all the good reveiws i decided to try it.  I did just as the recipe said with a chuck roast, though I did marinate it overnight in italian dressing and minced garlic.   The kids loved it and so did my husband.  A fall-apart, tender, mounth watering roast.

This is cooking now in the slow cooker on low for 8 hours. I will update after we try it. I did change it some by seasoning the meat well with Morton's season all salt and used a 28 oz bag of baby golden potatoes halved and also used a 1 lb bag  of baby carrots and added about 1/2 cup diced onion along with the celery and garlic. I used the whole packet of brown gravy mix with about 1/8 cup of water and also used the whole 12 oz bottle of cola adding in half a can of petite diced tomatoes and mixed in 1  teaspoon of better than bouillon beef base along with the cream of mushroom soup and dry onion soup mix. It looks  it smells amazing. Update this was pretty good  all through the meat was a little dry so I poured the gravy on top when served. I think next time I will add a few pepperoncini peppers and a package of dry ranch seasoning  along with a packet of au jus and will not add the packet of brown gravy and will add a stick of butter to make it like a Mississippi roast.

This recipe was AMAZING.  I  was looking for a good recipe for a pot roast and I stumbled across a bunch of reviews raving how great it was so I decided to give it a try.

I made a few modifications as I went along and it turned out great.

I used 12 Oz of coke instead of 10 oz. After adding two bags of carrots (really thin carrots at store) and I like carrots. I added about 3 russet potatoes cubed. 3 celery stalks. 1 clove of elephant garlic. 1/4 cup water in addition to the cola. I had added extra ingredients  (the extra carrots and potatoes) so I didn't want it to be dry. In my case I could only find about a 2 1/2 pound roast. I'd definitely recommend the 4 pounds if you van find it because it shrinks.

After cooking for the first hour I turned it down to the 225 and cooked for an additional hour. At this time I had lots of juices so I drained what I could with a big spoon into a sauce pan and put it back in for another 30-40 minutes at 225 but after cutting into my sirloin it didn't seem cooked so I cut into 6 pieces and upped it to 350 degrees for another 20 minutes or so. 

Near the end I drained the rest of the juices and added that to my saucepan.  Added 2 tablespoons of corn starch to hot liquid and brought it back to a ln almost boil which thickened the gravy.  Made mashed potatoes to go with the gravy and a side of garlic bread. 

When I first put everything together  (the brown gravy, the onion soup mix, and can of mushroom soup) when I added the cola it kind of f

This is a great recipe for fall/winter. I threw everything into a crock pot and cooked it on low for 7.5 hours. I would suggest turning the meat over halfway through the cooking time so the top doesn't dry out.

Superb!  Having never made a pot roast before, I had two goals: tender meat and lots of flavor. This accomplished both and was very easy.  I used 3 lbs of meat since there's only four of us, but kept the gravy portion the same because you can never have enough, IMO. I made this in my Dutch oven. Started by seasoning the roast with meat rub, then browning it with a bit of olive oil. Then I removed it, and sautéed onions and garlic in the Dutch oven, added the meat and then followed the rest of the directions by the book. My meat was completely covered in the gravy, so no worries about any of it being dry.  I served it over a bed of mashed potatoes. Everyone loved it, but no one more than me!

The best Pot Roast I have ever made!! Cooked in the crock pot ~ 8 hours on low. Doubled soup and extra Cola for more gravy. Also added more carrots because my kids LOVE cooked carrots. Served with mashed potatoes. SOO GOOD!!

I made a cola pot roast tonight......I only used the dry onion soup mix and a can of diet soda, a really tough cut of meat(I didn't know what else to do with it) and then added my potato's and carrots.  I didn't think we needed all the added cream soups and gravy mix's.....
The roast was so tender it melted in your mouth.  I was afraid to do the cola thing...........thought it would make the meat taste sweet.  But it did not.  It was wonderful........and I will be making it again...........soon, with just the cola and dry onion soup mix.  We all agreeded to make it with those two ingredience.  It was really wonderful.  And, by the way.  I made it all in my crock pot.  On high setting for 4/5 hours.  The gravy was excellent as well.  So, thanks(sort of) for a great recipe.  And cutting the fat didn't cut the flavor at all.  And it was better for us calorie wise as well.  I used a diet can of soda.

Awesome! All of my guests ate 2 (or more) helpings so my husband only got to have one small serving and has begged me to make it again tomorrow! Crazy good! I followed advice by others to braise 1st, added almost 3/4 pound of baby carrots. Used 1/2 can of brown gravy instead and also added 1/2 a beer. Crock pot for 4-1/2 hrs. Ps- I was nervous cause was overwhelmed by smell at 2 hours but by 4 hours it smelled just  incredibe.

DELICIOUS. I have never seen a pot roast go so fast, I barely got any myself! Added all ingredients except celery (didn't have any) to a crockpot and cooked on low for 8 hrs.

4 stars because I had to change a few things.  Used diet Dr. Pepper (all I had). didn't have beef gravy, but used bouillion and water, then thickened it.  Put in  celery, potatos, carrots, garlic.
Awesome flavor!  Used a chuck roast - melted in your mouth.

This is awesome! I made the roast once and then made a stew using some water too. I took the stew to a potluck and it was gone before I even got some. Everyone wanted the recipe. ; )

This was pretty yummy but I like the pot roast in foil better. Next time I think I will combine the two.  I would still make this again.

I cooked this in the crockpot. It was very moist and tender but lacked flavor. I think it might need a little brown sugar. Aside from putting it in the crockpot I followed the directions.

This is one of the easiest and most flavorful recipes for roast I have made.  I did add a lot more carrots and I also used sweet potatoes and celery.  Even better the next day!

Wasn't any better than the roast I already cook, normally. When I kept the meat for leftovers in the juice, and then reheated it, it was more tender. THAT I liked!! :)

I was looking for a recipe for my sirloin roast and decided to try this.  I made this recipe exactly as written. I will never make it again. It looks a whole lot better than it tastes. I will never use sirloin for a pot roast again either.... I dont think it works very well. For a pot roast, you are far better off with a cut like a blade roast. The sirloin tended to dry out (and no, I did not over cook it). I honestly don't know what all the rave reviews are about, it makes me skeptical to try certain recipes on here.

My husband said that this was like cruise ship food!  I didn't have cream of mushroom soup... I used cream of chicken.  I didn't have a packet of brown gravy mix.... I used peppered country gravy (whole pack).  Cooked it in the crock pot and WOW!  It was awesome served with mashed potatos.  I am making it again today... but I am trying it with the right ingredients!

Fantastic!  My bf loved this meal...It was perfect.  I didin't use a whole can of soda, just couldn't do it but I did add half soda/half beer.  Worked out perfect! I added mushrooms and onions instead of celery.  I also added broccoli and carrots.  I will make this again. Do not add too much salt.

More of a 3 1/2. It was too sweet for my taste. Didn't realize 10oz. of soda would affect the sweetness that much. I used chuckeye roast, rubbed with Montreal steak seasoning, and I seared it before roasting. Everything turned out great, but it wan't really my idea of what a roast should taste like. I will try a different recipe newt time.

I made pot roast for the first time and I used this recipe.  We had no leftovers!!!!  I used onions instead of celery (because we don't like celery), added more carrots, and threw in some fresh mushrooms as well.  Will definitely use this recipe again!

This was ok, but I used less onion soup mix than called for and still found that taste too strong, and I omitted the brown gravy and it was still plenty saucy.  I also used beer instead of cola which gave it a nice flavor, but overall I found the recipe a bit disappointing.

I used the whole packet of brown gravy (mostly because I had no idea what to do with only half a packet of gravy and I hate to be wasteful) and this is a very flavorful roast. I used Diet Pepsi as the cola and you can't taste it at all. But it sure makes a great gravy. I cooked a 3.5 lb. sirloin roast in the crockpot for 2 hours on high and then 3.5 hours on low. It was great!!

Great recipe.  I made in crock pot on high for four hours.  I also added fresh mushrooms, chopped onion, red skin potatoes, extra carrots and Montreal steak seasoning.  I also used 16 ounce bottle of cola instead of 10 ounces to have extra gravy. Family loved it!

I have to admit, when I was mixing up the ingredients for the sauce it looked a little gross.  Especially after I added the cola.  Even when I turned the roast over after it was cooking for a while I thought "this isnt going to be good".  I was sooooo wrong!!  This recipe had such great flavor!  Nothing changed! Not too salty, not too sweet.  Very good!  Thx!

I have always made a roast very similar to this.  My recipe does not have coke in it however.  So, I thought I would give it a shot.  I really wanted to like this but none of us liked the sweetness the coke added.  It has actually grossed me out and is making me a little nauseous.  Sorry....

Well this was one of the best roasts I have ever made and the gravy came out to be the perfect amount with the perfect consistancy. The only problem I had(which was probably my fault) is that the gravy was a bit too sweet tasting. My roast was not 4 pounds maybe only 2 pounds I'm really not sure. Also I used the whole can of coke and I think that the can is more than the 10oz that the recipe calls for. But the amount of gravy was good for the amount of roast. Also I didn't use any vegetables. I didn't have a packet of gravy mix but I did have powdered gravey mix in a can so I measured that with a measuring spoon and used it. I think it depends a lot on which brands of ingredients you use. But as I mentioned above it was great and I will try to work on a tweak to reduce the sweetness.

This was great! I only cooked it for 1.5 hours at 350 and then for 30 min at 250, my roast wasn't that thick.  I added potatoes, but didn't like the taste on those.

I dont know why, it was tough maybe I got the wrong meat so I am not going to fault it for that. And I cooked it totally under gravy the last two hours.  It needed more flavor and salt. I put some monced ginger in it and cooked it more. It was ok.

This was just ok for me.  Not bad, just average.  I used Pepsi and cooked in the slow cooker, but otherwise followed the recipe.  I didn't find it too sweet, but there was a little sweetness to the gravy.  Not sickeningly sweet, just something that was maybe a little off.  I probably won't make this again just because I have other roast recipes that are better than average and for us, this just wasn't.

This is one of those recipes where you have your camera ready to take a photo, but the smell and taste of the food get to you so bad, you literally, CANNOT wipe your fingers to take a snap. Nope. You must eat. In a frenzy. LOL. My dh only rated this 3 1/2 stars because he said that it tasted like ordinary meat - meaning he expected some kind of weird flavour from the coke??? Anyway, this is fab. Tastes like beef from your local roast take away who serves the BEST roast beef sandwiches with gorgeous gravy. Tastes like it was professionally prepared. I used cream of celery like another reviewer suggested. Seriously, quality beef.

This was a great basic recipe!  As usual, I did make some minor changes as I went along though.  First off I cut random slits all over the meat and then rubbed it with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and parsley.  I then seared it on each side in a skillet before leaving it cooking in my slow cooker (crock pot) on low for about nine hours.  In the slow cooker, I had -- the roast, one can of cream of mushroom soup, one full packet of gravy mix, one full packet of onion soup mix, and one entire can of diet coke.  Instead of water, I put two tablespoons red wine, and I also added more parsley and garlic powder.  I added chopped celery and baby carrots the last two hours of cooking because my family prefers them a little crisper than if they had cooked all day as well.  The final result was very tender and tasty!  I will be making this one again!

I get begged to make this recipe now!  The only difference in mine is that I use a little more cola, an extra package of gravy mix and an added bit of italian seasonings.

Although I have tried many pot roast recipes, I have never been a fan of pot roast until this one. This recipe will be the ONLY one I use from here on out. The gravy is the most unbelievable gravy I have ever had. What great flavor it adds to the meat and the vegetables. The only thing I did different was cook it at 175 degrees and took it out of the oven when I got home from work 8 hours later. I shredded the meat, put the vegetables and gravy in a bowl, and because my teen boys were vulturing me in the kitchen, I put some instant garlic mashed potatoes in the microwave and 2 minutes later dinner was on the table. Fabulous recipe!! Thank you so much!

This is sooo good!!  My family and I rated it the best pot roast we have tasted!  I love the flavor, the cola does
add a different twist to it, we didn't think that it "sweetened" it.  Will definately make this again!!

The only change I made was to use golden mushroom soup instead of cream of mushroom. The meat was very tender and flavorful, as was the gravy. Using cola in a recipe might sound strange but I think it helps to tenderize the meat.

A very good recipe for pot roast.  I am very stingy about my 5 star ratings - but this one was a 4 1/2.   Because I made mine in the crock pot I browned it first with a little oil and some sliced onions (adds color and depth to the final gravy) and added a couple of cloves of garlic and a few more veggies.  I also had to thicken my gravy before serving.

I used a 5lb roast, browning the meat first, then throwing everything in the slow cooker on low for 10hrs. The meat was just falling apart when we ate it- it was good, but could have been better-I would probably cook the veg separately as the carrots and celery did seem a lot saltier than the actual meat, making the meat seem a tad bland. Might put a rub on the meat next time. Used a full can  of coke. Will definitely try this again.

My husband and I will very rarely cook/eat/like anything that isn't super spicy and/or HOT, so this recipe came as huge suprise to us because we both liked it so much. I did add a bit of freshly ground black pepper, but that was the only spice I added outside the recipe. I did, however, add/change a few things from the original directions:

1- We browned the meat very well in olive oil in a dutch oven before putting in oven.

2- We used a lot more carrots than called for (1/2 lg bag of baby carrots). We also added in peeled waxy potatoes, quartered. We added in some peas, the last 30 min of cooking time.

3- We then cooked the meat, gravy, veggies, etc in a large roasting pan, not in a dutch oven or similar style pot. I wanted the gravy to dry up a bit and for the roast to carmelize, and the larger roasting pan helped with this. The roast came out carmelized and delish!!

4- We used 2 lb of very thick cut chuck roast (not 4 lb of the meat called for in the recipe).

5- After cooking at 350 for 1 hour, we lowered the temp to 275 (not lower). We kept the foil covering the roasting pan for hours 1-3. Hours 4 and 5, we left the roasting pan uncovered, and turned temp up to 300. This really helped to lessen the soupy gravy, and also browned the top of the potatoes very nicely. 
***************************
Leftovers of this meal were AWESOME! We didn't find this recipe to be too sweet at all. It was perfectly delicious! YUM!!

wow this is the second time i tried making home made pot roast and it was so good! it was so soft, and the gravy was great. i used garlic seasoning instead of chopped up garlic for the vegetables on the side, and i also sprinkled garlic seasoning on the meat. be sure to cut the vegetables rather big so they don't get too mushy. i am definately making this for my next family gathering

I cooked this in the Crockpot. If I do it again I will double the spices and be sure not cook less than 10 hrs. I was going to give it four stars, but we had this a few days ago and nobody wants the leftovers.

Wow! I am a beginner and this is my first roast ever!!!  I was so happy that it turned out so good.  I added mushrooms, corn, potatoes, and extra carrots.  I used about 16oz of diet pepsi and McCormicks pot roast seasoning.  It was so good.  I did not add a gravy mix.  Just some beef base and some cornstarch for the gravy.  Thanks for sharing and all of the adjustments in the reviews.  This is making my learning experience to be positive!!!

This recipe is excellent.  Very easy to make, but it is a little torturous to smell the delicious aroma for 4 hours!  The meat was falling apart and very tender.  Lots of delicious savory gravy.  I think next time I'll add even more vegetables!

My husband and I liked this recipe. We did make some changes. We added a quartered cut onion, and fresh mushrooms. I did use onion mushroom dry soup, and mushroom brown gravy. We had this over mashed potatoes! I also salt and peppered the meat on both sides. I also added 3 cloves of garlic instead of 1. Very yummy! I would recommend this recipe again!

This roast was ok.  I made it in a slow cooker and the meat was so tender you could cut it with a fork.  I just wasn't all that crazy on the taste. It was, for lack of a better expression, weird.  I'm going to keep looking for another recipe.

This was very VERY good!  Even my 3 picky eaters snarfed it up!  I didn't have any brown gravy mix but did have the jar mix in pork and figured it couldn't make that big of a difference and it was yummy!  My hubby said it was salty but anytime you use that onion soup mix that will happen.  I will for sure make this again but go easier on the mix. Thanks for sharing!!

Very good.  I did make this is the crockpot and made gravy with the juice on the stovetop before serving.  I usually make a similar recipe that omits the cream of mushroom soup and dry gravy and instead uses a bottle of chili sauce with the cola.  Slightly sweeter but this was very good also.

This pot roast was so good!  My whole family just loved it.  I think I may a couple of chopped up potatoes next time just to see how they cook up, but other than that I wouldn't change a thing.

Excellent recipe and easy to make! I omitted the celery and carrots and used 3 whole garlic cloves, rather then minced and used a little red wine. I place all ingredients in the crockpot on low overnight! My roast was still a little frozen in the middle and this turned out perfectly!  It was falling apart this morning while I was cutting it! I couldn't taste any of the cola.

I totally changed this so..don't know if I should rate it. First..I made this in a slowcooker on low for 8 hrs. I took the meat out and added 2tbs flour and 2 tbs butter and whipped gravy..then added 2 cps milk. The dish was very good and I served it with mashed potatoes. Yum

I made this the other night for dinner and it was delicious.  I omitted the veggies, and put the roast in the crock pot and poured the sauce over it.  I let it cook all day and then put it over rice.  It was so rich and a great meal with little effort. The gravy has a great rich flavor.  Will definitly make again.

I made this for my daughter and family. My son-in-law said it was the best meal I have ever made for them.  The only thing I did differently was to use 3 cloves of garlic and I cooked it 6 hours in a slow pot.  This recipe is superb.  Serve with German red cabbage and mashed potatoes.  Wonderful!

I was simply amazed at how wonderful & easy this recipe was.  I also cooked it another time in the slow cooker on low all day..... worked well that way too.  The is a true family pleaser.  Be sure to mash a tater or two as well or have some biscuits ready for that wonderful gravy!

After reading the reviews I wasn't sure what to expect. My family really liked this pot roast,I didn't find it to be to salty nor to sweet, it also turned out very tender. I cooked it to 160 because I was scared I would over cook it and it would be tough. Next time I will add more vegetables and season the roast.

DELISH!!  So simple and tasty.  I couldn't add potatoes (i wanted to) because my roaster wasn't big enough and i doubled the gravy.  I found the gravy WAY too salty for my taste and i wouldn't eat teh carrots because of the salt, but that could have been my fault since i rubbed the roast with meat tenderizer before cooking.  When i boiled the gravy on the stove i threw a couple slices of raw potato in and that appeared to lessen the saltiness so that i could eat it.  The roast was very tender but rather dry.  The leftovers were AMAZING!!  I let the roast slices sit in the gravy over night and it wasn't dry at all.  5 hours minimun cooking in the oven is a bit excessive in my opinion because it heated the whole house up and i had to open windows and it was in the middle of february!  Although it was nice to be able to slice my roast for once i think i will try the same recipe in teh crockpot next time.  Even though this recipe is very similar to my old pot roast recipe, i think i will stick with this one. The cola seemed to add a little something to the gravy that even my husband (who eats without comment) noted that i did something different.

Gravy was delicious!  My only criticism is that the cooking instructions were off for me.  The meat ended up overdone for my liking.  Next time I'll use a meat thermometer--take out at ~160 degrees.

Made this today for my family and it was a huge hit!  That's no small feat considering I have a picky husband and two toddlers!!  Both my 18 month-old and 3-year old loved the meat.  It was great just the way it was, next time I might just double the gravy, so we don't run short with leftovers the next day.  I served with mashed potatoes.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!!!

i'm always hit or miss when i make pot roasts. this was hands down the best i ever made. i cooked it on the stovetop on low for five hours, and forgot the cream of mushroom, so subbed cream of chicken. no celery, or carrots, but roasted carrots, onions and potatoes in the oven seperately. it was a HUGE surprise hit. i will definately make again.

This is the BEST pot roast I have ever had! The only thing I did differently is rub garlic, salt and pepper (I used a pepper blend, not just black pepper) into the meat. I also cooked it in the crock pot. Thanks for the recipe! It is delicious!

This has got to be hands down the best recipe for a roast! I have been doing the mushroon soup and onion for a while, but who knew the brown gravy and cola could make such a delicious difference?! My boys (4 and 2) ate it up with no whining and that's no small feat. Wonderful! Wonderful! A must!!

I'm joining the multitudes that have discovered how great this pot roast is.    I made it in the crockpot,  minus the carrots and celery,  and served it with mashed potatoes.   I've also made a manhattan type meal with it...(bread, meat, mashed potatoes stacked on top of each other and the gravy over all.)   This is an excellent recipe.

Cooking a pot roast in gravy sauce is not my cup of tea.  But to each there own. It really tasted good and I would make it again.  Giving it 4 stars because of how easy it was to make.  I added alot of vegies that were not called for and did it in the crock pot.  Thanks and will try again.

Excellent roast! I've made it a couple of times now and served it for guest. They also loved it. The Coke really gives it flavor! I cooked it in a crock pot for several hours the secomd time and it turned out perfect. Serve the sauce over mashed potatoes- very good.

This was my very first roast, and it turned out excellent!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I added more brown gravy mix because I was afraid the cola would make it too sweet.  The taste was delicious, and definately not "weird" like another reviewer had stated.  I cut up some big potatoes and threw them in with the carrots.  The veggies soaked up so much flavor, and the roast was very tender.  I think I will make this for years to come. :)

I was a little sceptical when I saw coke in the ingredient list and even more so when I had the gravy ingredients mixed in the bowl.  I took a taste and almost threw it out, the flavor too sweet.  Since the reviews were so favorable I went ahead with it and let me tell you, after the meat has cooked in the gravy, it's DELICIOUS!  You would never know.

Very good and easy.  I didn't have the brown gravy mix so I added some flour, pepper and a bit of olive oil...seemed to work out fine.  I also added some potatos and mushrooms.  Definitely could have added more veggies (quantity not variety).

First of all, I always prepare recipes as-is. After tasting the prepared dish I alter the dish as needed. However, after preparing this recipe I have found that this recipe needs know adjustments both savory and delicious. Excellent! My family loved it.

I cooked this roast in the crockpot while at work.  It was delicious!  It was tender and made lots of gravy.  I even improvised.  I had no cream of mushroom in pantry but had cream of chicken instead.  It turned out great.  There was no sweetness like others had mentioned.  Just a nice thick gravy.  I'll be saving this one.  Hubby loved it!

Was very disappointed after reading all the reviews.  Did not find it "awesome" or even "great".  Did everything the same, except added whole package of gravy mix.  Was still a little too sweet for our taste.  Gravy was more soupy than thick. Also added two 16oz. packages of baby carrots. I think I will stick with my mother-in-law's pot roast.

This recipe is awesome!  I made it just the way the recipe states with minor variations.  Instead of using regular carrots I put a package and a half of baby carrots in at the beginning along with the celery.  These were the best carrots that I have ever tasted!  I also used a full package of the gravy mix.  Half way through cooking I added another can of cook since some of the liquid was evaporating.  I also noticed some people mentioned the cooking time was too long which I found it is as well.  I had a 5LB roast and it took exactly 4 hours and it was perfect.  At the end I used just a little bit of corn starch and some potatoe water since I made mashed potatoes to thicken the gravy.  The beef tasted so good.......mmmmmmmmmmmm

I made this when my parents came over to my apartment for the first time.  It was so easy and no fuss!  My mom was VERY impressed and my stepdad said it was the best roast he'd ever had! (With the exception of my mother's, of course :o)  You could cut it with a fork!  I added a couple of potatoes chopped into large chunks and one onion cut into large chunks.  I also marinated the roast before hand, as my mom alwasy does, with Italian salad dressing and a little bit of worchestershire sauce.  DEFINITELY a keeper I will make again!

Great recipe. I added a teaspoon of worchestire sauce and place two cloves of garlic in for aroma and added taste. It was great and so easy. I used my roaster oven and it was a hit. Thanks for the recipe.

I made it as the recipe stated but added carrots and a little wostershire sauce. I put it in my crock pot and cooked all day. The gravy was nice and thick and the roast tender. My husband and I both agreed that the gravy was a little too sweet. I will try again but with a little experimenting...Very easy so I will give it an extra star for that.

I added chunked red potatoes and 8 oz of small whole fresh mushrooms. I also cut the garlic into slivers and inserted them directly into the roast. Fantastic!

Finally!!  A pot roast that isn't dry, tough or tasteless!  I have been searching for a yummy pot roast recipe for some time, and thanks to Sher, I can stop looking.  I did change a few small things....I didn't add any celery (I don't like it much), I added two cloves of garlic and rubbed some of it in to the roast, and I used a roast that was about half the size.  (2 1/2 lbs.)  Due to that, I shortened my cooking time to 1 hr. 15 min. @350, and another hour @225.  Perfect!  Tender, tasty, and the gravy was nice and thick.  I will prepare mashed potatoes along with this roast the next time I make it.  Thanks!!

I love this recipe! It is also a great brisket recipe, just bake longer. (hint if you love garlic - load it up, it makes it taste even better.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent!!!  Just a hint of sweetness in the meat and gravy. I simmered the gravy by itself for a while to thicken it up. Also added a few dashes of soy sauce to the meat while cooking. Made mashed potatoes and the gravy was just perfect for them. Thank you for this recipe. I thought I made a good pot roast before this, but I LOVE this one!

Excellent!  I used diet coke since that is what we drink, and cream of celery soup b/c that was all I had.  Served it to 5 guests and had no left overs, everyone was raving about how good it was.

I cannot believe that this recipe is rated so highly.  None of the flavors blended, you could taste each one individually.  The cola gave the gravy a sickly sweet flavor.  Will not make again.

I've tried for years (YEARS!) to make a pot roast I didn't have to cut with a knife.  This roast falls apart it is so tender.  The flavors are incredible!  My family raved about how good this was, and there were NO leftovers!  Definately a new favorite for my family.

The best roast I have ever made.  Here is how I used the recipe:
Use classic Coke.
Double the gravy ingredients.
Make roast and gravy in crock.
Refrigerate overnight, and skim fat in morning.
Cook veggies (lots of carrots, celery, potatoes, onions) in microwave.
Mix veggies with skimmed gravy and roast.
Refrigerate overnight again.
Reheat.  Yum.

This was really good. I halved the recipe, since there is only two of us, and it came out great. I didn't bake it quite as long as the recipe said, since I didn't have as much meat, and it came out tender and delicious. I did thicken up the gravy a bit as well, and served with mashed potatoes. Great combination of flavors, the cola really added something unique.

this recipe was THE best I have ever tried for a roast ! I used a pork roast instead because I had one in the freezer already. It was unbelievable !!! So tender and the taste was PERFECT. Had a slight sweet taste. but not over powering. Made it for a family dinner and EVERYONE (even the "i only eat hotdogs" 4 year old) loved it !! Will be making it again this week :) and many weeks to come ! 
Followed the recipes exactly....and all was GREAT !! Thanks a bunch

This was very good.  I did change a few things.  I used a whole packet of gravy mix and omitted the celery and dry onion soup mix.  I also added an extra clove of garlic and a large minced shallot.  The cola turned a tough roast into a very tender one.  I made one big mistake, though.  The gravy tasted wonderful when I took it out of the oven.  It was too thin so I decided to thicken it.  I was pulled out of the kitchen and it reduced quite a bit while I was gone.  The result, a super sweet sauce that burned on the bottom of the pot easily due to all the sugar in the cola.  I will make this again, though.  My preschooler really liked the meat.  I just won't mess up the gravy!

We thought this was pretty tasty!  I used a 3# chuck roast instead and also the whole gravy packet.  I took the advice of others and did marinate the roast for a few hours before cooking.  I was expecting the gravy to be a bit thicker but it was still very good!

Absolutely Awesome! The only thing I did different was to convert the recipe to a slow cooker. I cooked it on high for 4 hours (4lb roast) and added cubed potatoes for the last hour. YUMMY! The only thing I would do different would be to cook it on low for about 6 hours just to tenderise the meat a little further.

I made this roast last night and it was delicious!! I agree with past reviewers that mashed potatoes is indeed the perfect compliment to this roast. The only change I would make is to possibly marimate the roast overnight to add more flavor to the meat. There was no special flavor to the beef itself...possibly some beef rub would spice it up a bit. Overall, excellent. Delicious gravy and fork tender. I will definitely be making this again!

I love pot roast, but this is the best I've ever made!  It was very tender and flavorful.  My husband who doesn't really like pot roast loved it!  I had a 3# frozen roast and I used the same ingredients but cooked it at 350 degrees for 3 three hours - it was great!  A little cornstarch to thicken the gravy and there's your meal!  Thanks for this recipe!!!

I thought it was good, except my meat came out very tough. Perhaps it was the vut of roast I had bought. The gravy was excellent and the veggies were yum. Too bad nobody wanted to eat the meat. ***UPDATE I have been making this almost once a month. I put it in the crock pot and cook everything on high for 3 hours then low for 3 hours. The meat falls off the fork. Very Yummy!!

I am a horrible cook - no joke.  Everytime I try something new - it usually bombs.  I had a 7 1/2 pound roast in the freezer, located this recipe and decided to give it a try for Sunday dinner.  I added red potatoes, cut up and served with rice and potatoe rolls.  My husband loved it and couldn't stop telling me what a great job I did on this one.  That is now 2 meals (married 11 years) he's given his YUMMY to.  Both from Allrecipes.com - one on Saturday and this one on Sunday - Definite keeper!  THANK you for making my husband happy!

This is a wonderful, easy recipe, and one of my family's favorites.  I cook all my carrots, celery, potatoes, turnips, etc. right in with the meat.  Very yummy!

thought this was great and extremely tender.  however, i did jazz mine up a bit by adding sherry and butter to the gravy and deglazing the pan for a few minutes on top of the stove.  my husband....who is the pickiest eater in the world...requested me to make this at least one a week

This recipe has got to be a new classic! I just love the way it tenderizes the meat and makes such succulent gravy that doesn't need to be thickened. Great with mashed potatos. Comfort food!

I loved the gravy.  I didn't have 5 hours to cook so I tried fooling around with the cooking time and temperature.  It ended up a little dry but that was my fault.  Next time I will make sure that I have the five hours because I could tell that this is an awesome recipe.  I used the whole package of dried brown gravy and then in the end I used flour to thicken and it made a great tasting gravy.  Definitely a keeper.  Thanks

This is a great one if you want to tenderize and flavor a cheap, tough cut of meat.  The flavor is perfect.  I cooked it by itself because I wanted to serve it with mash potatoes and creamed corn.  Even the anti-gravy family members loved the gravy.

WOW!  I was so ready to hate this because of the cola.  I loved it!  I will still make my pot roast  but I will add this in every now and then.  It was wonderful.  It was even better the second night.  The carrots were extra yummy after soaking in the gravy overnight.  Thanks!

I added potatoes and a bag of baby carrots to this recipe.  I also added 1-2 tsp of seasoning salt and 1 tsp of celery salt to the gravy.  The cut of mean I chose was English cut - it came out so tender and yummy and no one guessed the secret ingredient.

Great flavor.  My family doesn't like spicy foods so I modified the recipe by omitting the garlic and onions and adding potatoes.  Also cooked it in a cooking bag and that worked out well.  Thanks Sher!

This dish turned out really well.  The meat was so tender.  The cola did add the perfect touch.  Next time I will cook the vegatables sepratley.  The sauce went great with the meat but I didn't feel it was good with the vegetables.

Great recipe. I believe when you rate something you need to cook it as the recipe states. If you make alterations then you are not rating the recipe provided. Followed this exactly, except added mini red and golden potatoes to the pan.

So I used this recipe, however I seared the meat and then cooked it in the crockpot. Threw a little bit of wine in there too, and it came out AMAZING. Will be making again. Whole family loved it and it was super flavorful.

I made this tonight for my Sunday night meal and it turned out really good . I give this only 4 stars because of the length it was in the oven I could have cooked in crockpot where the roast would have been fall apart yummy...don't get me wrong it was quite tasty and the clean up easy ! The most important thing is my BF had a good meal he loved after coming off the road ( Long Haul Driver ). I would fix this again

Made this for dinner tonight! My husband is in Heaven. I did change a couple of things. Added a medium onion quartered/separated, 3 cloves sliced garlic,4 Russets,quartered and a Guinness instead of cola! Braising the meat with a coating of flour, salt and pepper made the Gravy nice and smooth.

I have made this lovely dish in the crock pot several times and it's always a hit! I made a few tweaks because I wanted more of the paste to surround the roast. Aside from the one dry onion soup mix and the one can of cream of mushroom soup, I added a beefy onion soup mix and another can of cream of mushroom to the paste. My boyfriend loves mushrooms so I decided to add them addition to the veggies that this recipe calls for...I thought it would taste different, but it was totally worth it! The roast went in at 3pm and I had in on low for 10 hours so my boyfriend ended up waking me up at about 2am to let me know how delicious it was  :) .

I have made this roast in the past by NOT tweaking it and I decided to add what I did because I felt it needed a bit more for our liking.  Either way, 5 stars indeed because of how delicious it is and who would've thought....COLA!

This was great! Normally pot roast is bland to me, but I loved this! I used Cream of Celery soup in place of Cream of Mushroom, added a quartered up sweet onion, red potatoes, and cooked it in the crock pot. Will definitely make this again!

Super easy. I cooked it in a cockpit instead of the oven and added more carrots. The roast was so tender and juicy. The carrots melted in your mouth.

Just putting this out there for anyone who is reading the reviews but I just put mine in the oven! I used a 3.20 lb chuck roast. Following others suggestions I rubbed all sides with salt & pepper, garlic powder and a pinch of red pepper flakes, then seared it in a pan of olive oil til most of it was all lightly browned, and cut a few slits into the meat and placed 3 garlic cloves inside. I used carrots and potatoes, omitted the celery as a personal preference and added baby bella mushrooms. I used the whole pack of gravy mixes and instead of regular soda I used Diet Dr. Pepper to cut some calories. Will update once it is done and I had a chance to try it out! I do have to say it was pretty easy to prepare!

My husbands favorite is pot roast. This was delicious.I seasoned the flour with salt, pepper and oregano. I also put slivered garlic into the meat then browned the meat in a little olive oil. I made the gravy as stated adding 1/4 tsp each of oregano and thyme. Easy and so, so good.I will be making the recipe again! Thank-you for the new and very good recipe.

I've tried many different recipes for pot roast and I always go back to my usual method. This roast was ok for flavor but great on tenderness.

The picture looked so good.  I made it yesterday.  I did not care for the cola.  I made it in the crock pot.  I may make it again, but not right away.  Loved the gravy/onion packet  though.

This was very good.  I left out the celery and added some chunks of potato and onion.  I used the whole envelope of brown gravy mix and extra cola.  Made it in the crock pot.  Next time may take another reviewer's advice and use a beer.

This was excellent! I did sear the meat in a hot pan with about a tablespoon of oil before putting it into the crock pot to give it a crust and color. Oddly enough, I didn't have either potatoes or carrots in the house, but had an overabundance of portabella mushrooms and sweet onions. I followed the recipe exactly, except for the veggies. I thick-sliced the mushrooms and onions and they were just wonderful cooked in that yummy "gravy." Served it over rice; it was wonderful. Will surely make this one again.

Glad I found this recipe because it is a winner. The only change I made was adding Baby Bella mushrooms {because I had them and I love them} and it really added to the flavor. I took one reviewers advice and also made JP's Big Daddy Biscuits and they were the perfect compliment to this recipe. Thanks for all contributors.

This will be our family's pot roast recipe.  It was perfect.  You may want to add pepper/salt per your tastes.

I had to admit, I was skeptical about this recipe but tried it anyway. turned out pretty good. Using cola as tenderizer was a first for me and the flavors was out of this world...Anne Collins

My family has always made this type of recipe growing up,  and it became one of my favorite dishes. 

The only change I made is using diet coke instead of regular. This is the way my Grammy and my mom always made it.

My Variation:
Instead of half packet of brown gravy mix, whole packet
Add a couple of shakes from the Worcestershire sauce bottle
Replace the Cola with soup can of your favorite brewed coffee
Hold the Carrots out until cooking halfway point
Add Potatoes with the Carrots.

Wonderful rich gravy without the sweet flavor
Vegetables done, but not overly mushy.

Excellent.  Will make again for sure.  The gravy is great- make sure you make mashed potatoes to use some of it up.  I made it in a crock pot for about 10 hours on low.

Great recipe.  Make sure you double the amount of meat as the roast shrinks down considerably.  Purchased 12 lbs for 9 people and it was not enough.  After the roast is down take out the meat and add more carrots and celery if you intend to serve it.  I browned the roast first with Montreal Steak spice.  Could of used more salt.

This recipe has great flavor and was an instant hit.  I did modify the cooking time because when I check the meat temp when it was time to flip the roast it was already well done.  I think 2-2 1/2 hours total would be plenty depending on the size of your roast.  Check the temp is the best way to tell.  I also added small peeled potatoes during the cooking and sliced mushrooms to the gravy during the last 30 minutes and they were a nice addition.

Great recipe.  I omitted the celery and added cream of celery soup instead of mushroom.  I also used a bag of baby carrots instead of using regular carrots. A plain old 3 lb. pot roast turned out juicy  and tender.  4-5 servings for us with baby potatoes or noodles on the side.

This recipe was AMAZING!! The only tweak I made to it was that I cooked it in an oven bag on 350 for 3 hours, the gravy was delicious on top of mashed potatoes, the flavoring of the coke was soooo subtle and made all the difference.

I wanted to try something different so thought I'd try this recipe, it turned out good. However, I think I will stick to my recipe, as the taste and fragrance of envelope gravy was prominent.   I prefer the taste of the actual meat and juices meshed with the flavor from the surrounding vegetables/seasonings.  Glad to try the recipe and don't get me wrong it was good.

I enjoyed this roast.  I was expecting a different flavor like some of the other reviews posted but it pretty much tasted the same as mosts roasts do.  I was looking for more of a sweet flavor but all in all I was happy.  I love roasts on cold nights so I will make it again.

i was tired of the same old pot roast recipe so I searched for something new and different. Made it for a family dinner and everyone loved it, even my son who doesn't like pot roast. It's a keeper! Only made two changes, used 1 lb of baby carrots and we don't like mushrooms so I used cream of celery.

I was very iffy about putting cola in it, but I did it anyway. The roast turned out great. It was very flavorfull and tender. If it didn't take so long to make, I would cook it more often.

Makes a thick gravy and the beef comes out tender.  Cola makes it too sweet though - far too much for our taste.

As suggested by another I used beer instead of cola and added red potatoes.  Floured with pepper and browned I a bit of oil prior to cooking in the crock pot   Cooked on high for approximately six hours and it was delicious. Husband rated the recipe five stars. Thank you.

Wonderful recipe. I followed others advice and seared it first. I also stuck garlic cloves into the meat before cooking and peppered it before searing too.  Also used a little vinegar to get the juices off the searing pan into the slow cooker.  I used the Mexico Coke (real sugar). Also added one big onion more carrots and cut up a large sweet potato. The only issue was that it took more than 5 hours in my slow cooker. at four hours I cut the meat into cubes and cooked it for a few more hours but this time on low heat. Excellent!!!!!

We loved this recipe..by far my favorite Pot Roast - The only changes I make are to add a few potatoes (quartered and with skins), used the whole pack of gravy mix and cooked it in the slow cooker for about 10 hours on low while I'm at work. The whole family loves it from the 7 yr old to the 17 yr old..and even my husband so it was a success! (I have also substituted jars of savory beef gravy for the gravy mix and it was still really good and with a bit more gravy).

Very yummy!  My husband and the kids really enjoyed it.  The only thing that is keeping me from making it a 5 is that I would have liked more seasonings.  Next time I make it, I will be adding more seasonings outside of the onion.  I also made this in the crock pot. The recipe transitioned nicely.

We loved it...

I did have to add some flour to thicken up the gravy, and i cooked it in the slow cooker, but other than that, it was great.

This recipe got rave reviews from my family tonight.  I did it in a crockpot. We put it over egg noodles for something different. I also added a corn starch slurry for some added thickness. It was very easy to make.

This is the best a roast has ever turned out for me! Very easy and tasty. I used a crock pot and Coca Cola, but left out the gravy mix because I didn't have any on hand. My husband looked at me like I was crazy when I used the onion soup mix and cream of mushroom soup, so I didn't let him see me put in the Coca Cola! He liked this roast and didn't have a clue of what I put in for the 'secret ingredient' until I told him. I just turned the roast so each side had a turn in the mixture and added carrots and potatoes about 2-3 hours before dinner time. Just right! Nice and tender, like I said, the best a roast has turned out for me and I have tried several recipes.

Outstanding!  I added cream of celery in lieu of celery and also added some fresh sliced mushrooms.  Huge hit with the family and the gravy was excellent - so good in fact that I chipped up what little roast was left over and served the gravy mixture of egg noodles the next night.

Wow! This was oh-so-good pot roast! I followed the recipe exact, although I did sear the beef beforehand in butter/olive oil & garlic.  After it was done cooking I scouped out all of the veggies and added some cold water w/corn starch to make gravy.  The roasts I make in my crock pot come out extremely dry so this is now my go-to pot roast recipe!

The gravy is delicious. I replace the carrots and celery with small cubed red potatoes, use garlic powder in placed of minced, and a full packet of brown gravy instead of 1/2. Sooo good! I love brown gravy, and this stuff is the best I've had.

This is a great recipe!  I've been making this recipe, minus the brown gravy and cola for years.  The difference in adding these items takes it from good to great.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great base recipe, thank you so much for posting!  I too made a few slight changes; I can't, in my right conscious, pour 10oz of Cola into my food, so I add a little less than 1/2 a can.  I double the cream of mushroom soup (we're big fans of mushrooms), quarter a pack of mushrooms.  I also use less than 4lbs of meat (we're only two) so there's plenty of yummy gravy for mashed potatoes!  Everyone who has tried this has licked the plate clean and it's become my boyfriend's favorite meal.  I also marinate the roast in the gravy over night so all the flavors really sink in there, then all I have to do is pop it the oven the next day.

I love pot roast but prefer it only when it falls apart and is extremely tender. My mother in law makes a roast and I do not like it at all. To me a good roast should just fall apart when you cut it. This recipe is awesome and my husband/partner loves it. I make it all the time but did make one changes beings we both dislike mushrooms.  I simply replaced the condensed cream of mushroom with condensed cream of celery. Still is the best ever. I also add some pepper and garlic powder. Do not add salt or you will be sorry. There is enough salt in the soup, gravy mix and so on. I also cook it a little longer if I can. The longer it cooks the more tender it is. Also my dogs love daddy's pot roast. LOL. They know when I'm cooking it and the puppy does not always eat her food except when I add some of my pot roast. LOL. This is a must make recipe and everyone who has had it when I cooked it said it was the best pot roast they ever ate. ENJOY!

EXCELLENT!!! I just made a roast and didn't add the vegetables just so we could make sure we liked the gravy. WOW!!! Everyone liked it :) Thank you so much!!! I did thicken up the gravy a bit with cornstarch/flour and double the gravy, but only used one packet of the dry onion mix (just cause my family isn't onion people.) TRY THIS you WON'T be disappointed.

This is awesome. I make this for company and they always ask for it when they come back for a visit. It is a fave in our house. I do not use celery b/c I do not like it. I use a couple of red potatoes and a squash. Comes out great.

I followed this exactly!  The best pot roast I have ever tasted. When I cook a pot roast my mother's way I am able to slice the meat - when it is cooked this way the meat just falls apart which is the way I like it.  Served it with mashed potatoes.  Can't wait to eat the leftovers. I cooked a 3 3/4 lb rump roast and it just served the two of us last night and the 2 of us will finish it off tonight so I don't see how this could serve 8.

Didn't have celery so I substituted with a dash of celery salt. Added 1 1/2 onions. Also, didn't have brown gravy mix so I substituted with 1 cup of beef bouillion/water. ***UPDATE*** I went to the store and bought brown gravy mix and added the entire packet 2 hrs before serving.

I have never seen my kids eat an entire pot roast without any leftovers and want seconds.  This is the best.  This recipe put mine to shame.   I did not have the cream of chickn soup in a can so I used the entire envelope of brown gravy mix and Lipton cup a soup cream of chicken.  Added 1/2 cup more water.  Absolutely the best pot roast I've ever made!

My first time making a pot roast. It came out really good. I think next time I'll probably cook it 30 min. less than it calls for. Also will add salt + pepper. Thanks for the great recipe!

This turned out about 1/2 a step from perfect.  The gravy was excellent and so flavorful.  My vegetables were tasty and perfectly cooked (I had carrots and red potatoes cut in half).  The only problem was the meat was dry.  Luckily the gravy was so good, it really didn't matter.  I just hate to have such a nice roast turn out so dry!

Not bad, but not as good as "Kathy's Roast and Vegetables" - that was the best roast I've ever had or made. I did use the whole packet of gravy and the whole can of cola as I hate to waste ingredients. I'm glad I did, because even with the extra gravy mix and added potatoes, this had a LOT of liquid and though tasty, it was too thin for me.

This one was ok.  The actual roast turned out pretty good, but I didn't really like the gravy that the Coke made.  It wasn't too sweet, just didn't taste quite right.

I used pork instead of beef, but otherwise kept it the same. I too thought the sweet flavor was a little off. I will try with beer next time.

I use this recipe about twice a month! We really like the flavor, but the sodium is through the roof!

I was definitely a little skeptical at first, but this was a true gem.  I opted to sear the roast first, then added onions, carrots, and mushrooms to the pan.  Only had condensed chicken soup, onion mix, and pork gravy mix on hand, and the roast turned out fabulous.  We couldn't stop eating it for days...was wonderful for leftover roast beef sandwiches with gravy and horseradish.  Will definitely try to experiment with other vegetables in the future...possibly fennel, turnips..?  Update 01/28/09: used this recipe with venison, and it was wonderful.  You can't help but take a few (OK, many) bites here and there while this is cooking.

Fantastic!  I did thicken and add salt and gravy master to the gravy at the end.

A very good pot roast. I used about a pound of baby carrots, 6 large red potatoes, and celery.  I added a few veggies right when I put it in the oven then didn't add the rest until two hours before it was done so they wouldn't be too soggy.  I made it for my b/f his mom and his best friend and they all loved it.  will use again

I got a new porcelain cast iron dutch oven and just had to try it out.  I
don't know whether it was my new pot or the recipe, but what a success.  My whole family loved it, even the picky eaters.  I used black angus chuck steak and didn't have brown gravy mix so I substituted a few beef boullion cubes.  Lots of gravy for the mashed potatoes I served with it. I never had luck with pot roast before ... this is my only pot roast recipe now!

Very good, moist roast.  Quick and easy.  No sugary or cola taste even though I accidentally used an entire 12oz can. Gravy didn't turn out well, but I probably used too much flour.  Will make again.  Thanks.

FABULOUS RECIPE!  My entire family went crazy for this meal!  My teenagers adore gravy, so I DOUBLED the gravy mix, water, dry onion soup mix, cream of mushroom soup and cola.  I omitted the carrots and celery (did veggies and potatoes on the side).  I took the roast and gravy ingredients and plopped them in my slow cooker before I left for work.  Only potatoes and carrots to whip up when I got home!  (Bread was in the machine, too!)  Ahhhh, modern conveniences!  Could it have been better if I had browned the meat first?  Maybe.  This recipe is EXCELLENT just as written.  Will make it over and over again!  Thanks a bunch!!!

First time making this - little too sweet and had to add sea salt at the end to gravy and veggies.  I did brown the beef like other reviews suggested. Next time will add some Texas Pete's for some zing.

This was good but I wasn't completely blown away by it. Honestly, though, maybe I am not nuts about pot roast so I'll give this 4 stars. Not sweet at all though, like others claimed and maybe that was bc I used diet dr pepper.

This was the BEST pot roast I have ever made, or eaten. I omitted the celery and added baby carrots, fresh whole mushrooms and small red potatoes. I was a bit apprehensive about cooking it for 5 hours, but I sold on this recipe after tasting it.

This was excellent and so easy. 5 stars from hubby too who had no idea there was cola in it. Yummy with onions and lots and lots of carrots thrown in! Served with mashed potatoes and green beans. Will definately make again.

My, this was tender. Used a pork roast which usually comes out a little tough for me.  Not this time! 4 stars only because I didn't have cream of mushroom on hand - so I skipped it.  Probably would have been better with it, though.  I must say that I used Diet Pepsi (all I had) and I did not get an aftertaste nor was it too sweet like others have said. Maybe that's a key. Will definitely try again with all the ingredients next time.

I think this is fantastic and I have made it many many times. My family loves it! The only thing I do different is I add golden potatoes quartered and I use Rump roast or round. If you are having more than 4 or 5 people then double the mushroom soup. I always use the full can of coke. Thanks for sharing. I also use fresh bunch carrots never those baby carrots in a bag! Just not the right flavor imo.

Absolutely awesome.  Makes a wonderful gravy for potatoes.  I did substitute beer for the cola, plus added fresh mushrooms.  Delicious!  Also, I assembled all the night before in a crock pot, then cooked next day, all day, on low.  This is a wonderful comfort food!  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Since it was just my husband and I, I only did about a 2 lb roast and cut all the times in half. The meat still tasted good but the carrots were not soft enough.

Excellent, it was aromatic, tender, juicy and a real crowd pleaser. I used red potatoes, baby carrots and fresh mushrooms. I just added them until it looked right. I will definately make this again.

I made this for sunday dinner in a crock pot and it was fabulous!  My husband loved it and my kids also thought it was great.  I think it was the best roast I had ever made.  I didn't have cream of mushroom so I used cream of chicken and it was great!

Delish!  I used cream of celery soup since my DH hates mushrooms, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  The sauce is wonderful!

This was really great!  My husband is very finnicky and I didn't tell him about the cols until he had already agreed that it was delicious.  I was afraid it wouldbe overly sweet, but it wasn't - and the gravy was..YUM!

Who would have thought that pouring a can of pop (I used pepsi) would make such  tender pot roast. I cooked in the slow cooker on low for 8 hours. The only thing I will change for next time is that I think I will add a few more spices as it didn't have enough flavor for me. Hubby had me pack the leftovers for him to take to work to share with his buddies the next day. That tells me this one is a keeper.

This was excellent!!!  I would make this for company.  Only made minor changes, no celery, extra garlic of course, and used roasted garlic and onion soup mix.  Also, made my whipped mashed potatoes alongside, it was yummy!!  Now what to do with the leftovers, I made enough food for an army, and we are but two!!!!

I loved the gravy but thought the meat was too dry.  I wanted to reduce the cooking time by an hour but then decided against it.  When it was finished, my boyfriend made the comment "I thought it was supposed to fall apart?" however, he did eat everything on his plate and said it was good.  He especially liked the gravy. I added carrots, fresh mushrooms, and potatoes around the roast.  The mushrooms made it so much better, but the other veggies were not done enough to eat.  I'm looking for another recipe to do something with the leftovers (after completely cooking the carrots & potatoes).  Maybe roast beef sandwiches with some of the meat and a beef stew with the veggies and leftover gravy.

This recipe is awesome!  It comes out perfect every time, and the remaining juices make a wonderful gravy.
It's the recipe that we want, when we crave roast!

WOW!! I was worried when I was mixing the cola mixture, b/c my I had a $10 roast(Hawaii has expensive meat) but my end result was WONDERFUL. I put it in the crockpot, and added the whole packet of gravy(mushroom gravy) and some potatoes. The meat just fell apart, so tender and jucy. My husband said he couldn't tell there was cola in the meat, but the veggies he could. He said to make again!!

To tone down the sweetness, I increased the garlic to 2 cloves and added about 1/4 cup red wine which also helps soften the meat. It was gobbled up by my guests!

Wow, is all I can say. This is the best roast I have ever had.  The first time I made this recipe I used cream of celery soup becasue that is all I had and it turned out great. My hubby asks me to make this at least once a week. I will never use another recipe for a roast again!

This was AMAZING!  Everyone loved it.  I was a little put off by the thought of cooking it in cola, but I was so pleasantly surprised.  I've always tried and failed miserably to make roast like my grandma's - I finally did it!

This recipe is delish!  I don't use the celery or brown gravy, but I love the flavor!  I always put the potatoes and carrots on the very bottom to keep them immersed in liquid. Yum, yum!

I thought this was good, but I thought it was a bit bland which surprises me because dry onion soup mix is usually pretty overpowering in most recipes.  Overall, we did enjoy it and will more than likely make it again.  Thanks for sharing.

This was very very good.  Took the suggestions of seasoning the meat with salt, pepper and garlic powder before placing in roaster.  Doubled the gravy ingredients and served with mashed potatoes - YUM.

Made this last night and it was excellent!!!!  My husband who gets a bit testy with my "5 star kitchen" (because he rarely gets a plain old cheeseburger) said he would never complain again.  I did use the beefy onion soup mix, but was the only change.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

I read many of the reviews before preparing. As there were some comments about drying out the roast, I followed the advice by some of using a meat thermometer and cooking to 160 degrees. I used a six pound prime rib for a group of 10 - took 4 hours, 1 at 350 and 3 at 225. Some comments had also mentioned about the meat tasting bland so I rubed some cajun spice into the roast before cooking. Served with Company Potatoes recipe. Lots of positive comments and easy clean-up of plates - nothing left on them.

This was very good but a little too salty for us, so I poured the gravy into a sauce pan and added a can of Cream of Celery soup, also used a tablespoon of minced garlic because we love garlic.  I don't think mixing the brown gravy mix with water is necessary, just forget that step and add all gravy ingredients to one bowl and whisk.  Cooked in slow cooker on low for 5 - 6 hours, very nice and tender.  Just dumped it all in and enjoyed the aroma throughout the afternoon.

Well, I just finished trying this recipe, and my fiance and I are rating this recipe a 4 because it is rather bland and dry.  It is very easy to make so it gets a 5 for that.  The gravy is wonderful(make sure you use the whole package of gravy mix)... it gave the veggies a very nice taste.  For the veggies we used new potatoes, carrots, one white onion, celery, and mushrooms... and man, did they turn out "great"!  The mushrooms, celery, and carrots really had an amazing flavor.  Also, we stuffed the roast with the garlic. This recipe is a keeper, but a bit bland and very dry.  Next time, I will take it out of the oven sooner.  Cooking time is off a bit, and that is the only reason I rated it a four... otherwise, it is a wonderful recipe.  Thanks for this one!

This was an AWESOME recipe. The flavor of this roast was absolutely one of THE best roasts I have ever had! The meat of course was melt in your mouth. I ended up using a "cheaper" cut of meat and it was still divine...ask your butcher what you can substitute as a sirloin roast can be costly. Definitely will make this again and use it for a Super Sunday Supper!

I liked this recipe well enough, but my boyfriend was very disappointed.  The flavor of the gravy was somewhat bland and the vegetables got very soggy.  I made a beef stroganoff out of the leftovers (which was pretty good), but I would not make this recipe again.

A pleasent surprise.  Easy the kids loved it.  Made it with mashed potatoes and roasted veggies.  I used 8 oz of diet coke and 2 oz of water.  It was not sweet, but very rich in flavor.  Will make it again.

This was my first time preparing this recipe. We loved it. It gave the roast a really nice flavor and it wasn't sweet like I'd expected.

I used a bottom round roast for this recipe and it turned out fairly well.  My husband gave it a four rating because he thought the meat was a little dry.  I used 8-oz. of Pepsi and 2-oz. of water to avoid other reviewers' complaints about it being too sweet and it didn't seem sweet at all.  I didn't put in the celery and instead chopped up half a small onion and put that in.  I may try this recipe again in the future and marinate the meat in the sauce overnight before cooking it in the crock pot.

I thought this was a really good roast.  The gravy was excellent, and although some people said it was too sweet, I thought it was just perfect (I used Coke Zero for the cola).  When I try this again, I may use a little bit more garlic (just my preference), but other than that, I thought it was really yummy!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Was a different take on roast. I loved the juice. Served with wide egg noodles, but will do mashed potatoes next time. Also, subistuted onion for carrots. Not a big fan of the carrot.Also used a whole package of brown gravy. Served with white corn,texas toastand merlot. Will definatly make again, probably in the slow cooker. Hubby though it was real good, but not a 5.

DH only wants this roast from now on. He's already asking me to make it again. Only thing I did different was leave out celery as a personal preference and rubbed more garlic into the meat. Will definitely add more vegetables and use the entire package of gravy mix. I suggest rubbing the meat with some spices as the meat itself was a bit bland, though the sauce was superb!

This was very easy to prepare, but allow time for proper cooking.  The meat was extremely tender, and could be pulled away with a fork.  It makes an excellent french dip with the gravy in the pan.  I highly recommend this recipe!

By far the best roast recipe.  It take quite a while to make, but well worth it.  My husband looks forward to this meal!!!  Keeps well for leftovers.  Very tender.  The coke give it a sweet taste.  I also started adding gourmet mushrooms.  2-3 hours before complete.

This was fabulous! I used a boneless potroast intead of a sirloin roast because it's cheaper. It usually comes out dry, but, with this recipe it turned out really tender and flavorful. Thanks! I will definately make again and again.

Delicious!  I put it all in the crockpot in the morning.  Baked some potatoes and dinner was ready!  The gravy turns out really yummy and it's so nice not to have to try to thicken a gravy at the last minute.

Will use this recipe again and again. We had grandparents in and made this as the main dish.  Just did roast minus potatoes, carrots, and celery in crock pot.  We had mashed potatoes instead.  Just thickened drippings for gravy.  Dinner was a hit.

I finally made a good roast! I have had the worst experiences cooking roasts for some reason, and I will now stick with this recipe. The only thing I changed was to only use half the packet of gravy mix, and next time may try without. I cooked with carrots and onions, and ate with mashed potatoes. (Suzie's Red Mashed Potatoes on this site). I could detect a hint of sweetness, but don't know if it's because I knew there was cola in it. My family couldn't tell. It tasted great and was very tender. Yeahhh!

This is the best roast!  My husband said it's the best he has ever had. I followed the recipe, but rubbed the meat down with kitchen bouquet when I put it in the roasting pan, and took about 20 minutes off the cooking time...which could have just been oven differences.  It was fabulous and is now our roast of choice.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

Perfect Sunday Dinner! One of the best pot roast dinners I have ever made, used a cheaper cut of meatand the entire of packet of gravy and still a winner.  Have passed it on to many.

I have made this several times now and it is absolutely FANTASTIC!!  It seems impossible to have those ingredients come up with that spectaculary flavor - but it work.  Definitely one of the best recipes I've tired and so easy!!  I'd give it 6 stars if I could!

I thought this recipe was great. I made only a couple of changes. I used the entire packet of brown gravy mix, 1 12oz can of Coke, and lipton beefy onion dry soup mix. Also, I cooked a roast of 3.25 pounds according to the directions, but only 4 hours total and the meat was soft and tender, melt in your mouth good. I also added potatoes to the pan when cooking and I used baby carrots instead of chopping carrots. This was a great meal and I will make it again!

Tried it but was skeptical.  I liked it so much I was embarrased about the amount of carrots and roast I ate.  Not embarrased enough to not do it again.  Thanks

Unfortunately, I thought this recipe was just OK.  I have made better pot roasts just throwing something together.  The meat was bland and we couldn't taste the gravy at all.  It was tender though.  The vegetables were also good.  The only thing I did different was to cook it in my roaster like I usually cook my other roasts.  I tend to give recipes at least 2 tries so I will try this one again in the oven and see if that makes a difference.

I was pretty disappointed in this recipe.  My husband complained it was bland and my 8 yr old who eats everyhting under the sun wouldn't even eat it.  I did make some changes but it shouldn't have affected it.  All I did was cook on low in the crock pot and I added some pepper.  Meat was dry, not tender.  I gave this 2 stars because the carrots turned out good and it was a very easy recipe to prepare.

I made this recipe over the weekend and it is so easy and so delicious!  I made it according to the recipe.  Next time I would add more carrots. (Like 2lbs. baby carrots.)  My 7 & 10 year old boys loved this roast, and they are picky eaters!  Highly recommend!

This was a new and interesting twist for fixing a roast.  Everyone loved it.  I think maybe next time I will use a little less garlic.   But over all this was a good recipe.

I make a pork roast similar.  with only cola, mushroom soup, and dry onion soup mix.  This is now my favorite beef roast recipe.  Next time I would add potatoes towards the last two hours or even at the beginning.  I even used 2-1/2 pound roast and had lots of gravy!!  Yum...

This was my first time making pot roast. I have never eaten a pot roast so tender  and juicy. After reading the reviews I used the whole package of the brown gravy. I used pepsi as I think Coke is sweeter. The gravy was not as thick as I am used to, but never the less this was a good meal. I added potatoes as well.

This turned out so very good tonight. I think it's one of the best roasts I've ever fixed. I cooked this on low in the crockpot for a good 10 hours and it was simply fantastic. So tender and juicy! I didn't have any Lipton's dry onion soup so I used a dry package of french onion soup mix and it worked out great. Served with Green Beans and Potato/Cheese Pierogies.

In all my years of cooking pot roast I wanted a change. This recipe was wonderful. The whole family loved it. I will be making this again. Added more veggies and potatoes other then that followed the basic. You won't be sorry on this one.

This was sensational.  I made it in the slow cooker and the meat was very tender.  I used a peppersteak gravy and omitted the celery as I didn't hubby doesn't like it. I didn't find it too sweet at all and the 3 girls I was minding loved it, especially the carrots. Will definatley make this again.

DE-LISH! Even my finicky kids ate it, which says A LOT. I used a regular roast (sirloin was too expensive and not a lot of fat/flavor content). I also used a crock pot and BEFORE I put the roast in, I rubbed the outside of it with "Gravy Master" and sprinkled all sides with onion and garlic powder, then I seared it (make sure you coat the pan with olive oil first). The Gravy Master helps carmelize the meat and gives it a mouth-watering appearance. After searing, put all ingredients in the slow-cooker for 6+ hours. The longer it cooks, the more tender and yummy it becomes!

I'm a brand new mother to a 7 week old and was able to make this in between his feedings.  I'm also not known for my  cooking abilities and this turned out great.  It was very tender, not at all too sweet.  I did add some corn starch to thicken the gravy.  I was very happy with this recipe.

This is a great recipe! I never heard of adding a can of cola to a roast but that was key! I also omitted the celery. I added half of an onion, a few potatoes, and carrots. I also added a little salt, pepper, and italian seasoning. It is important to add in regular cola, not diet, however I used caffeine free because my husband is sensitive to caffeine. My mother-in-law said it was the best roast she had in a very long time!

I found the "gravy" to be too thin to use as a gravy, and the overall taste to have too much onion.  I altered it by adding 2 gravy packets, eliminating the water and decreasing the cola to one cup.  I substituted the onion soup mix with greek seasoning.  It was great!!!

I was amazed by this pot roast!  I've never been able to eat the meat out of the roast; I just like the potatoes and carrots, but I ate everything this time!  The meat turns out so tender, and the juice is delicious.  I used carrots and potatoes instead of celery and followed the recipe exactly.  I also cooked it in my slow cooker on low.  (I was a little worried at first because the onion soup smelled so strong in my slowcooker, but as time went on it weared away.)  This will definately be the only pot roast I ever make.

Very nice Pot Roast!  I did not include the canned soup, as it wasn't in my pantry, and I only had powdered Turkey gravy -- it still came out wonderful.  During the last 1 hour of cooking, I added diced potatoes and they came out really  nice!!  The whole family loved it!  It was even better the next day!  Thanks for the great recipe!!!

An absolute DREAM.  This was, hands down, the best roast I've ever made.  I did some basic changes, not because the recipe was bad, but because I needed to suit my poorly stocked pantry.  :)  I substituted a can of pork gravy for the gravy mix, which I think made the mixture creamier and gave me more gravy (and in my house, more gravy is a good thing).  I also didn't use the condensed soup...  That was a personal choice since I use cream of soup too much (and I think everybody else does too), so I subsituted a basic white sauce (with half milk, half broth) instead, that I flavored with the onion soup mixture, garlic, and red pepper (white sauce, btw, is equal parts butter and flour, with enough milk/broth to make it thick and creamy).  I also used root beer instead of cola...  Delish.  :)  Next time, I'm going to use Sprite to see if I get a lemony flavor.  :)

Hats off to this chef!

I followed the recipe to a tee, and it turned out really tough and dry.  The gravy was sweet and the carrots were the best part.  I decided to make this recipe because of all the good comments, but Maybe I did something wrong,  who knows.

This really had excellent flavor, and my roast was surprisingly tender, considering I cooked the heck out of it. Maybe it was smaller than 4lb? Anyways, next time the only changes I'd make would be to reduce the cooking time even more(I roasted for an hour less as it was!),insert a meat thermometer, and check more frequently.

My roast was perfect. I followed the recipe and my meat was very tender and flavorful.  The leftovers tatsed just as good the second day.  Excellent! I cooked my meat as directed and it was definitely done, for those who like a little "red" you may want to cook yours for a little less time. Mine was perfect ( I like my meat DONE!)

I dont know what it is with me and roasts but I suck at them. Mine came out so dry! I sauted some butter and flower and made a gravy out of the pan drippings which somewhat saved the dinner but I still thought it was so incredibly dry. We didnt even touch the leftovers. Dont know what I did wrong.

Awesome recipe. You can not taste the pop at all and it tenderizes the meat so much it falls off the fork. I made it for guests and it was immediately gone. I then made it for family who loved it too!!

This was pretty good. I liked it, as did my family (made it in the crockpot but followed the rest of the recipe to a 't'). My favorite is still the "Awesome Slow Cooker Pot Roast" found on this website though. This was an overall good recipe.

I have been making this for years, and it is awesome!  tastes best with regular coke, and I add a can of golden mushroom soup, and leave out the brown gravy mix.

Excellent roast and loved the gravy.  I spooned out the veggies, and then added cornstarch to thicken it a bit.  I cooked the roast as directed, but next time I'll cut the cooking time down some as it seem to be a little over done.

I too added all of the brown gravy mix, threw in some carrots and potatoes, cooked in crock pot 4 hours on high. I used a diff. cut of meat, so added meat tenderizer and did not brown ahead of time.. it was so good my mouth is watering just thinking about it!

My family loved this recipe and was surprised that there was coke in it!  I followed the recipe exactly, but next time I plan on only putting 2 stalks of celery, 4 carrots and a few potatoes.  I also used a crock pot to cook the roast in instead of the oven and it turned out very well.

Found this to be rather bland. I cooked it in the slow cooker so the sauce didn't reduce as it would have in the oven. Not sure I am willing to try again in the oven though.

This pot roast was delicous! The gravy was fabulous! I used 12 ounces of Coke, the whole package of gravy mix, rubbed a little cayenne pepper on the roast, and added potatoes. My family loved it!  I will make this again and again!

I was hesitant to try this recipe because adding cola just didn't sound good.  Even when I was making it I was skeptical as to how it would turn out.  I'm glad I tried it cuz it was very delicious and tasty.  Even my daughter was impressed with the flavor.  I highly recommend this recipe.

Wow.  This is the best and only pot roast I make now.  I cook it in a crock pot all day, then I slice it and cook it in the juices for the last half hour or so.  My husband even tells me it's better than his mothers.  Now that's a compliment.

Our roast came out extremely tender and had that slight hint of sweetness, but certainly wasn't over-powering. I took some of the advice offered here and poured in a little milk and a two teaspoons of flour just to thicken it up a little.

This was an extremely tasty roast, and my fiance and I just loved it.  I made it in the crock pot and ended up overcooking it, so it was a bit dry.  But, the flavors are absolutely wonderful!  Will definitely make again.

I thought this roast was very delicious, though I did not follow the directions exactly. I added more garlic to subdue the sweeter cola flavor and it worked. Also, I only cooked the roast for 3 1/2 hours, so it stayed tender. This might be different for others though, depending on the type of dish you choose to bake it in.

This was a great recipe for the family.  The cola made such a creamy gravy for the beef.  I also reduced the gravy down some and thickened it up...it really helped.  No one could taste the cola.  It did create a sweeter gravy though.
I will make this recipe again

I thought this was sooo good, but I give it a four because my husband said it lacked some flavor.  I use 3/4 of the brown gravy and 1/2 can of coke.  It was not sweet at all which was great.  I did make this in a crockpot, which is a lot easier than checking the oven every couple of hours.  But maybe I will need to thicken the gravy adding salt and pepper to give it a little more flavor for hubby.

This pot roast was pretty good, but I'd do a couple of things differently next time.  First, not cook it as long, maybe half an hour or 45 mins less.  Second, I'd put half cola and half water in the dry mix, just to cut down on the sweet taste.  I put in the whole pack of gravy mix, and while I think this helped keep the gravy thick at the end, I might use 3/4 of a packet next time so the "gravy" taste is more suttle (I'm not a big brown gravy fan, anyway).  Otherwise, I will be making my pot roast like this from now on, it can't get any easier than this recipie, and the flavors really compliment each other.

This was very good.  I didn't have the time to cook it lower, so I kept it as 350.  I used an eye round roast and it was a bit chewy.  Next time I will use the sirloin roast and cook at the time/temp recommended!  Excellent gravy !!

This was an awesome recipe.  I did not cook it as long as the recipe calls for.  Basically 1 hr at 350 and then 2 hours at 225.  The gravy turned out creamy and smooth.  I did add onions to the carrots and celery.  This recipe feed a family of 4 with leftovers for lunch the next day.  Not sure where the servings came from but no way if feeds 16.  This is a keeper, most definitely.

All I can say is Wow.  It was mouth watering.  My husbands Mom makes a roast that to me is bland, but he loves it.  I made this and he couldn't get enough.  My three young children devoured it also.

I thought this recipe was good.  I would recommend adding a rub to the meat before hand as the meat itself is pretty bland.  Will make again.

BETTER THAN MOMS!!  I can't belive how good this recipe was.  Just like everyone else I thought the cola was a strange addition but I went ahead and tried it and I am glad I did.  This recipe was easy, tender and delicious.  The leftovers (weren't many) were super tasty on a sandwich afterwards.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND  I will make this many times over.

This was a great recipe. Used it twice for entertaining. Works well in the oven and using the slow-cooker. Surely a crowd pleaser. Gravy is phenomenal.

The whole dish turned out to be too soupy. The taste was okay, nothing to get excited about.

A little drier than I would have liked but the gravy was scrumptious. I added a 5 lb. bag of potatoes and a pound of carrots. My fiance loved this recipe, so I'm sure I'll make it again.

I loved this dish. It was very tender and flavorful.  It took forever, but was worth the wait.  I made this for my new boyfriend and his brother (hopeing it would turn out ok) and they both raved about it.  I took it to friends at work the next day and they loved it and asked for the recipe.  Thank you!

Although this roast was VERY moist, I found the flavor to be lacking.

The vegetables cooked around it were incredibly tasty, so perhaps I just didn't baste it enough.  

It was moist and easy to eat, but with such little flavor, why bother.

The meat came out SOOOO tender and juicy!!!!We all just gobbled it up~~~there were no leftovers (and with 3 picky eaters, that is definitely a +!).  During the last 45 min., I added a bag of carrots with the meat. Then about 5 minutes before it was done, I added a can of green beans.  It tasted so good!!! Served the delicious gravy over white rice and soaked it up with some biscuits!!! Will be making this again real soon.Thanks!

I've made this recipe again and again, and it's a hit every time!  The cola and the onion soup mix really make this dish.  It makes for great leftovers, as the flavors intensify with time.  Just to give it the 5 star rating, I gave it a 5 for timing, although it does take forever.  I certainly didn't want to give this one a bad mark.  It's worth the wait!

I've made lots of pot roasts and this one is unique.  The sauce is what makes it great.  The cola really adds something -- it's sweet and snappy.  This recipe is also very easy.  You don't have to mix all the sauce ingredients in a separate bowl.  Just throw them all in the pot, stir, and plop in the roast.  Also, I didn't turn the roast over after 3 hours.  No need.

This is the best roast I have ever eaten.   The kids love it.  Gave this recipe to a friend and after trying it she gave it to her daughter.  I make this at least once a week.  The friend and her daughter gave it rave reviews.

This pot roast is by far the best I have ever made.  The taste is fantastic.  Great with mash potatoes and the delicious gravy.  It was so good my mother asked for the recipe!

Wonderful flavor and not one guesses the cola ingredient, thank you.  My sweet husband was so surprised when I told him what made it so good.  Sorry it took 35 years of marriage to get it right.  Again, thank you.

What wonderful gravy this makes! I doubled the ingredients for the gravy and added potatoes to the mix after the initial hour of baking. This  
will become one of those family favorites.

This is one of the best roasts I have made. The gravy is to die for! My husband is  a gravy critic and he raved about the rich flavor.  The meat is so tender you don't need a knife. Thanks,Sher, for sharing this great recipe!

My family thought it was very tender and moist.  They prefer the flavor of my usual roast though so next time I'm going to try a combination of my usual and this recipe.

This is an incredible recipe! My husband and all 3 children absolutely loved it. Hubby couldn't believe what the "secret ingredient" was, but ate 2 helpings with no complaints! I'll use this recipe often!

I have more failed attempts in making roast. They either turn out tough or tasteless. This one is definitely a winner. It turns out perfect each time and it's easy to make. Thank you Sher Garfield!!!!

I forgot to add that I cooked this in my crock pot all night on low to save on oven time and it was excellent. Joy B.

This was delicious, even though I went for the stovetop version with the same ingredients.  Just as yummy!

Made this tonight and it was a big hit with the family--even my two picky eaters!  The gravy was really tasty and everyone was right, people are shocked to hear that the "secret" to it is cola.  Next time I would make this in the crock pot since it cooks so long at a low temp and is covered anyway.  Thanks!
