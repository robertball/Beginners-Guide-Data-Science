Modified based on what I had in my pantry. Fresh ground whole wheat flour, coconut palm sugar substitutes. Added about tablespoon vanilla and cinnamon. Filled liners half full and baked for 15 min. Still turned out moist and delicious. I love that they aren't too sweet. Will top with Nutella as my little ones call them cupcakes. Will definitely use this recipe again!

Everyone liked it. Have been making it for 2 years now and probably like 5-6 batches of them already. Really moist. Instead of using ginger and nutmeg, I used the same amount of pumpkin spice. And I added more one more spoon of vanila.

These were good muffins!  I used a whole 15 oz can of pumpkin puree and added 1/2 tsp of salt and a sprinkling of cinnamon.  The flavor and texture were great.  Thanks!

The batter was the consistency of tea biscuits or scones. Did not care for them.
