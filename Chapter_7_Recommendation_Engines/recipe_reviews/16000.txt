I would have rated this 5-stars for ingredients and only 2-stars for the cooking method--the idea of cooking the raw bacon in with the cooking water just didn't appeal to me.  I sauteed diced bacon with minced garlic, then tossed in the beans, cooked crisp tender, and finished with the almonds, which I toasted. Now THAT'S good!

I revamped this recipe a lot...sorry. I cooked my beans as directed (leaving them slightly undercooked) only I added just a bit of bacon drippings to the water to add flavor. Meanwhile, I sauteed pearl onions & chopped pancetta in EVOO & a little butter until the onions were golden, deglazed the pan w/ a bit of chicken broth, added the green beans (drained) & sliced almonds... as well as a bit of Garlic Butter (recipe frm this site) that I had in the fridge. FANTASTIC!

Used frozen whole beans from Sam's Club and added a lot more slivered toasted almonds (Trader Joe's). Had to add a great amount of seasoning. I sauteed in butter as well as extra virgin olive oil and added fresh minced garlic. Also, seasoning salt and fresh ground black pepper. Without any of the above, this would have been blah. For this fact, I am giving the recipe a three. With my additions, it became a five.

Very yummy idea, and I used slivered almonds that were treated with garlic to add extra flavor.  Yummy!

I used this recipe as a guide, but changed the method quite a bit.   I cooked my bacon separately, cooled and crumbled it.  I tossed the almonds in a little of the bacon grease and toasted them in the oven at 350 for about 10 minutes.  I cooked my green beans in water until crisp tender, drained them and tossed them in a little more of the bacon grease.  When it was time to serve I re-heated the beans and bacon in the microwave, adding salt and pepper, and served them garnished with the toasted almonds.  Different method entirely, but my results were probably similar to the submitterâ€™s intent.

Bravo! Incorporating the bacon took the bitterness out of the beans without having to dredge them in butter. My husband LOVED this, and he is not a vegetable eater. Will make over and over!

I followed this recipe about 95%. Instead of bacon I used unsalted butter strictly and sauteed the beans with almond slivers. I sauteed the beans until they were crispy and not limp. Then after I drained the excess butter.  Be careful not to burn the almonds. Do not store covered or they will become soft and limp.

This just needed a lot more flavor for us.  I ended up tossing in melted butter with garlic salt added to it.  I think next time I will try simmering the almonds in the garlic butter mixture and just pour over the beans and toss.

I loved this recipe. I had to use prepacked fresh beans as the real fresh ones are not in season yet. The bacon added a nice subtle flavor to the beans. 
I also used pre seasoned sliced almonds instead of regular almonds. These are the ones that come in the little pouch. I used the ones with italian parmesan seasoning. Will make these again

This was sooooo good!!  Though I didn't follow it 100%, it was a good platform to start....I steamed the green beans for 8 minutes, toasted the almonds on a hot pan, added bacon and garlic and cooked til bacon was ready....added the steamed green beans to the pan and stir fried it all together for a minute.  Added seasoned salt to taste. Soooooo good!!!

Method of cooking in this recipe is a little off so I browned some chopped turkey bacon and garlic in 1/4 cup butter. Added in the already steamed green beans and they were a hit. Will add in shallots next time as reviews state.

Everyone liked it.  I cooked the beans in less water.  Toasted the almonds, cooked the bacon separately, and added them both before serving.
