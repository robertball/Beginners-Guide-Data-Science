I stumbled upon this recipe and decided to give it a try. I altered the recipe according to previous reviewers. I used 1/2 cup butter. I added about 2 tsp of white sugar. I used three cups of sliced onions. Mostly yellow cooking onions and one red onion. I've read that using Vidalia onions are the best because they are sweet, so you might be able to omit the sugar if you use them. I cooked the onions on medium heat in the butter until they sweated down and were carmelized. That took a while but the taste it worth it. I used about 2 TBS of flour.  Then I used 4 cans of beef broth, 1/2 cup wine, 1 TBS of worcestire sauce, some fresh thyme (the whole sprig's thrown in), 2 bay leaves, salt and pepper. I left that boil and then simmered on low for 20 minutes. At first it tasted like red wine but after simmering it had great flavor. Thanks so much for this recipe. I will be making this one again.

I was looking everywhere for this recipe...here it is! I have made all different kinds of onion soup and this is, by far, the best. I really like the tradition of swiss cheese and red wine added...this is a classic recipe! My family came over and half of them HATE onions. They actually ate this soup, and loved it. One thing I would say is always add yellow onions. They have the most flavor.

A good basic starting recipe.  I changed it quite a bit... used butter instead of margarine, added about 2 tsp. of thyme at the end, and used 1/4 cup of sherry and 1/4 cup of port in place of the wine, as well as provolone instead of swiss (the swiss would have been better, I think, or gruyere).  Also added 3 cloves of thinly sliced elephant garlic about 1/2 way through cooking the onions.  The trick is to cook the onions sloooowly, on a med/ med-low heat.  The soup was fantastic, not too salty like many I have had before, and was delicious with a fresh green salad.

Very good and easy.  I think I know why some reviewers found this bland-  most brands of canned beef broth are not meant to be diluted with water. (I know the ones in my pantry aren't).  If you use regular canned beef broth instead of condensed broth- skip the water and use 4 cans of beef broth instead of 2!  I caught myself just in time- the soup was delicious!

I love onion soup and this recipe is great!  I sauteed the onions very slowly on a lower temperature for optimum flavor and added a shake of worcestershire sauce for some added complexity like other reviewers have suggested.  I didn't have small oven proof bowls so I just toasted some bread and topped with the cheese and broiled in my toaster oven.  I ladled the soup into bowls and floated the toast on top.  YUM!

All I can say is WOW! You made me the hero of the dinner table today! Thanks for posting such a delectable recipe. I made the following changes: I used four Vidalia onions, and three cloves of fresh pressed garlic.I substituted 3 cans of beef consume for the 2 cans of broth, and added 2 beef bullion cubes to 2 cups of water. I also added a tablespoon of worchestershire as suggested here. I used one slice of Alpine Lace Reduced Fat, and one slice low fat Mozzerella....I made the overlap the outside of the bowl and added a shake of paprika before placing under the broiler.....it was gorgeous and delicious, and my husband and son couldn't stop raving about it. 

By the way, I didn't have the small soup crocks, so this morning I bought half a dozen at Goodwill for 10 bucks!!

Thanks again, Allison, for such a great recipe! It will be cherished by my family for years to come!!

Oh boy, am I ever in love with this onion soup!  I'm generally not a big fan of onion soup, but my boyfriend is, so after reading the other recipes, I tried this one, and we are so glad I did!  I did make a couple of changes though.  I added a LOT more onions and gently browned them until they were very golden.  All in all, that took about an hour, but the enhanced onion flavor is well worth the effort.  I only used beef broth, no water, and to up the beef flavor even more, I used a couple of teaspoons of a product called Better Than Boullion.  Finally, because I don't like the flavor of red wine in soup, I swapped it out for a slash of cognac, but be careful as the cognac can too easily overpower everything else.  Swiss cheese is the absolute best choice here.  We love this soup so much that we can't even considering ordering it when we're out.  We just know it won't be as good!

I'm sorry to say this, but this was the first recipe I got from this web-site that I didn't like. First of all, it had no flavor except for the wine.  So, I added a tsp of salt and a beef boullion cube, and that improved it greatly. Secondly, there was entirely too much onion, and not enough broth.  The quantities need to be adjusted.  If those adjustments are made, I would give this recipe 4 stars, but as it stands, it only deserves 2.

I thought this recipie was excellent, although I modified it a tad bit.  I divided the amount of wine by one half, and instead of using the cans of broth I used 4 beef boullion cubes for flavoring instead.  My advice is to cut the baguette in half, and from there slice it into slices one centimeter thick.  Toast these as directed in the oven, and line the whole bottom of the soup bowls with the slices.  Everything else in the recipie is fine.  I cooked the soup with my modifications added into the recipie for my dad, who is from Paris, and he said it was one of the best French Onion Soup he had ever tasted!

I just LOVE soup, and french onion is one of my favorites.  This version was pretty good, not the best I've ever had, but good.  I used port wine (it's all I had, without opening a new bottle, and well then I would have to drink it ;) (ha!)  I think the port altered the flavor, as it was a bit sweet.  Thanks Allison.

I love French Onion Soup. It's my favorite by far. This recipe is great but I had to tweak it to be excellent. First, I used all beef broth instead of water. Water will just dilute the favor. Second, when you're stirring in the sugar, add a clove or 2 of minced garlic and about 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme. I use dry white wine instead of red wine. I've tried both and white wine gives the soup a much better flavor. Last, after toasting the baguette and while it's still hot, rub both sides with a peeled garlic clove. Believe me, it makes a huge difference. Sometimes I use Gruyere Cheese instead of Swiss but either are great on this soup.

It's OK but the onions need to caramelize for at least 45 minutes to bring out the flavour and sugars. Don't worry if they burn some. As a matter of fact - let them. Much Much better this way. And never Red wine! The tannins kill all the sweetness we worked so hard to bring out. White wine, a bit of congnac but not red wine.

This soup was amazing! I altered this recipe according to previous reviewers and to my taste. I added 2tsp thyme, a bay leaf, 1TBS worcestershire sauce, and a few garlic cloves. I carmelized 3 cups of vidalia onions with 1TBS sugar. I used 1/2 cup butter and wished I only used 1/4 cup, but very rich soup. I'm glad I only used 1/4 red wine so the flavor would be very subtle. Provolone and swiss cheese together is awesome on the soup. I'm making this again soon.

Great soup! After reading a few of the reviews on the soup I decided to tweak things a little bit following their instruction.  Here ya go:  Put 1/2 cup butter into large saucepan, after melting, put 2 to 3 cloves of minced garlic in.  Cook garlic untilit starts to turn brown, while also adding a touch of salt and pepper.  Upon browning add 4 sliced vidalia onions, 1 tsp sugar.  Cook on medium heat for about 1/2 hour until onions melt down and carmelize (they just about started sticking on the bottom of the pan for me at this point).  Subsequently add 1 cup good red wine; I think this was the key to my soup turning out so well.  I used a very good bordeaux that was left over from last night. Stir in wine and then add 1 tbsp worcestire, 2 tbsp flour, 1 cup water, and 64 ounces beef broth. Furthermore, I put a bundle of 2 bay leaves and about 5 sprigs of thyme in at this point also.  From here, bring to a boil and then reduce to a low-medium heat to simmer for roughly 30-45 minutes. At the end, toast some baguette slices in the oven, rub garlic on these, and then stick'em down in the bowl of soup.  Cover with a whole bunch of Gueyere (spelling?) cheese.  And then put it in the oven until the cheese melts to a golden brown.  Very tasty!  Enjoy!

This was AWESOME. I followed the recipe and this was far better than any French Onion Soup I have ever had. I recommend this to anyone who is looking for a great soup recipe. With a salad, this was a great meal. Try this and you will not be disappointed.

I think this is my 2nd time reviewing this because I just made this soup again yesterday and it knocked my socks off. The only change I made was a bit less wine. I can't wait to make it for a potluck because people will be blown away.  So easy, so delicious.  Best ever and I've had TONS of french onion soup.

This is an easy/quick soup.  I use Wolfgang Puck's beef broth instead of the condensed beef broth. I also cut the bread into cubes, toast them, and float them in the soup before adding Swiss, mozzarella, and Parmesan cheeses.  This makes it easier to eat.

This recipe was awesome!!  My entire family loved it.  It was so quick and so flavorful!!  I did make a couple of changes, though.  I didn't add the red wine, I just added a touch more beef broth.  And I added a couple of dashes of Worchestire sauce and about 1/2 tsp of garlic powder.  It's a great recipe, especially for someone with out a lot of time for cooking.  I would recommend slow cooking the onions, it breaks them down and they carmalize much better that way.

Great café quality and taste!  However, I do have a few tweaks...  
1.  Use two 10.5 ounce cans of beef consommé instead of condensed broth.  It's easier to find in the stores and will get rid of that water and wine taste others have complained about.  Do be sure to add the water and wine as directed though, as with consommé, it is really needed.  
2.  Cook the onions on medium heat for a good 40 minutes.  
3.  Simmer the soup for at least 20 minutes, if not more.  
4.  Toast eight slices of bread (so as to put two in each bowl) for 5 minutes, flip them, and toast the other side for another 5 minutes.  
5.  Mozarella works better than Swiss, and only use half of what the recipe calls for.  
6.  On an upper rack, broil the bowls for three minutes (or until it is browned) on a low temperature instead of baking.
All in all, this is a great recipe that was well worth the tears.

Im not a fan of french onion soup.. but I'm starting culinary school really soon and I want to try all different things, just to gain more knowledge. Even though i don't like it, it was pretty tasty- and my fiance whos a big fan said it tasted better than any he'd ever had. I didnt have big enough individual ramekins, so i took a chunk of italian bread and topped it with swiss and provolone and put in toaster oven for a few min to melt- then put on top of soup...sure looks pretty too! I'd make this again for a crowd, if they like this type of soup.

good soup, I had to change the recipe based on ingredients that I had.  only problem I had was the bread was kind of soggy even though I added it, baked it, and then served it immediately.

I would give this 10 stars if I could! You definitely need the worchestershire sauce and red wine. I also used Consomme soup instead of the plain broth. My husband and guest thought it would rival the best they ever had in restaurants! I am such a godess....

Very easy and quick to make.  My 2-year old son even likes the broth.  I use 2 onions per recipe, as 3 is too many for us.  I would also agree with another reviewer that there aren't many pan juices to mix with the flour, but I haven't added any additional ingredients, and it's still OK.  It was good enough to share with family the 2nd time.

Delicious! Used brown sugar instead of white, croutons instead of bread, and added a few dashes of Worcestershire, salt, pepper, and thyme as recommended by some other reviewers.  Also threw in some thinly-sliced mushrooms.  Husband said it was the best soup he'd ever tasted, and has even requested that I make it for our Christmas dinner at HIS family's house!  Success! :)

Loved it!  Changes:  3 cups of yellow onions, carmelize and you don't need any sugar, used vegetable broth,  toasted baguette slices in toaster, topped floating toast with grated swiss - melted well without the oven.  Only used 1 cup of water and it was perfect for 2 large servings.

Yummm! I just made this for the first time and it is delicious!  I made a few changes: 1/2 butter, 2 yellow onions which made about 4 cups when sliced, I browned them slowly as other reviews said (well worth the time!).  Since I don't eat beef I used 4 tsp Better than Bouillon Vegetable paste dissolved in 4 cups of boiling water.  Added some minced garlic before the flour and used 2 tbsp whole wheat flour.  Didnt have red wine so I used white with a tbsp Worcestershire sc.  Added croutons and baked...sooo good! Will make again

This was yummy!  I used a little less water just because I prefer more "meaty" soup.  I also only used 3 TBSP of butter.  I also happened to have some sweet italian turkey sausage that I needed to use up.  I cooked the links while the onions were cooking, crumbled them up and added them to the soup at the end.  I let the sausage flavor soak into the soup on the stove for a few minutes.  It was really good and made a more hearty meal. Also instead of putting the bowls in the oven at the end, I  just put the bread with swiss cheese in the oven alone for a few minutes and then placed the bread slices on top of the soup before eating.  But that was just because I wasn't positive if my bowls were oven proof or not.

I'm sure this recipe is great when you realize that your beef broth isn't condensed before you add all the water and sit down to eat it...I was really looking forward to it, but, I think the recipe should be altered, as the majority of pantries don't have condensed broth in them

I modified this recipe slightly - 32 ounces of beef broth, 2 TB flour, 1 tsp sugar, 2 cups water, 1 packet of onion soup mix (gives that extra flavor) and 1 TB worcestershire sauce. I did not add red wine to this.

I love onion soup and this recipe is great.  I add a couple things to my soup that are different.  I add 2 cloves of garlic, 1/2 tsp of thyme and 1/8 tsp of nutmeg when cooking the onions.

FABULOUS!  Except that you have to cook the onions WAY longer than specified.  I cooked yellow onions on medium for about 30 minutes.  I used regular slices of white bread, toasted them in the toaster slightly, then put the cheese on top and broiled them for a minute.  I didn't have oven safe bowls, so I just ladled the soup in a regular bowl and added the bread with the melted cheese.  YUMMY!

Thank you SO MUCH for this recipe!!!! I cooked this for my Mom's birthday and she is from France and she said it is the best bowl of French Onion Soup she has ever had in her fifty years of living in France. Then she told me that I could be president some day, even better than John F. Kennedy, and that I am the best son ever! Better than anybody else's son! Soup is good food!

I have never made french onion soup before and it was very easy and tasted great.  I didn't add wine, because I didn't have any, but did add a tablespoon of worcestershire sauce.  Also used 2 cans of beef broth, and 1 bouillion cube with the water.

Made it this past weekend.  The only adjustment was I used 2 cups of water instead of 2 1/2 cups.  This soup is "to die for" as my hubby put it.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe, Allison.  This is truly a keeper.

This is a great recipe! My first time making French onion. I did take everyone's advice and used more butter and sugar, cooked the onions until they were carmelized, that took quite a while, added a clove of garlic, no water, only beef broth, more flour to make it thicker, a bay leaf, pepper, tiny amount of ground thyme, sweet red wine, and simmered it for an hour. Served it for a small dinner party and they all loved it!

Oh my goodness!  I am a newlywed and just learning how to cook via allrecipes.com.  This soup was so easy, yet it tasted like I was in a restaurant!  I can't believe how delicious this came out. Made it for my husband's birthday, he was much impressed!  Absolutely delicious recipe!

I used butter and a little olive oil instead of margerine and I used 1 red onion.  I added 1 clove of minced garlic and 1 small shallot when the onions were just about done and added some worcestershire sauce, white wine(didn't have red), sherry, pepper and lemon juice to that and reduced it then added the flour and cooked it and added 2 cans of beef broth. After it came to a boil to thicken, I reduced the heat and corrected the seasonings w/ more sherry, worcestershire sauce and pepper and simmered it longer.  Delicious!!!

It was a good base recipe, but very bland.  I added salt and pepper, worchestershire and a touch of soy and it livened right up.  Also, shreaded swiss (rather than sliced) is the way to go for a gooey cheesey topping.

Replace red wine with about a 1/4 c. of Port and Swiss with good Gruyere and you might not be able to differentiate this from the best you've every had anywhere.  My husband said it was second only to one of the finest restaurants in France.  (We used homemade beef broth with beef boullion to augment the flavor--we'll probably just use the canned broth next time.)

Nothing wrong with this classic recipe, but two things I do: I think a key ingredient to french onion soup is thyme.  I slowly brown/carmelize the onions over an extended period of time.  This yields better flavors.  10 minutes will not do it.
A few other 'ideas'?  I'm into spicy foods and will often throw a couple of bird's eye peppers or similar.  On occasion, I'll add bacon for a bit of a Canadian twist.  But if you do, do so after you've finished cooking the soup.  Otherwise, it will tend to cook the bacon flavor right out and simply leave the soup just a bit saltier than it already it was.
Finally, consider making an extra effort on the bread.  Cut or break into appropriate sized pieces and throw into a bag with a bit of olive oil, thyme, pepper, etc; and shake it like a polaroid picture.  Then bake in oven until dry and crunchy.  Keep these on hand for the next few days to throw into your soup as required.

Phenomenal! I just returned Paris where my Christmas Eve dinner was a comforting bowl of authentic French onion soup. I had made this recipe years ago (an ex-bf engulfed it), and decided to try it again due to my Parisian nostalgia. I tweaked the recipe a little: substituted one quart of beef broth for the water and broth called and used olive oil instead of butter. It came out even better than I remembered!

I have made this over two dozen times and it is great, but I have a few tweaks. First, use 5 tbsp of butter rather than 4. Next, use 3 full cups of water. Next, use a full cup of red wine. Finally, use French bread rather than a baguette and cut your slices thick so that the cheese does not dip into the soup. I also find that 10 minutes for the cheese to melt is way too long. By that time the cheese has been bubbling for a few minutes already. 5-8 minutes is a better amount of time, depending on how bubbly you want your cheese. As a side note, French bread is much better than Italian bread because French bread is drier, which is good for this. I also slice a few thinner pieces of bread for dipping. Great recipe.

First thing is just ten minutes of cooking the onions is not near long enough, you need to cook the onions over a medium heat until the are golden brown (caramelized), this can take awhile, but it is what gives flavor to the onions. I added some minced garlic right before adding the flour. I also cooked my onions in a mixture of bacon grease and butter.
I bought a generic beef broth since I had no fresh left in my freezer...what a mistake to buy a big store's generic broth, I actually tasted it before using it and it pretty much tasted like water. So i added a cube of beef bouillon and a good dash of Worcestershire sauce. I used only the broth, if I added water it would really be lacking flavor. 
Also the bread at the end needs to be quickly broiled until golden brown on low under the broiler and not baked for another ten minutes, or it gets mushy. 
If I make again I'll only use some fresh beef broth or beef consume. My onions were great all by themselves, I used fresh thyme from the garden to spice them. I had some yellow, some red and some sweet.

No Flavor.  Too much water I think.  It definitely was no Jason's Deli French Onion soup. I tried to add some salt.  It was a shame too because my onions were fantastic.

I may have done something wrong in the recipe. I hate to say this about it because I do appreciate the submissions from all of users.  Sorry.

Fantastic! This soup tasted like restaurant quality. Onions need much longer than 10 minutes to carmelize. Mine took at least 25 minutes. I used 2 tsp of sugar to add to the sweetness and I also used vidalia onions. You could taste the wine but it wasn't overbearing. I topped with provolone as I didn't have the swiss on hand and it was just as good. Great recipe!

Sooooo good.  Just plain without the cheese and bread even - but made it using 3 cups of onions, 6 cups of water and enough Better Than Bouillon to make that 6 cups of broth - that stuff is amazingly good.  :)  I'm planning on eating the whole pot of soup by myself I think.

Excellent recipe!!  Delicious :-) Just as good (or even better than) as any french onion soup I have had in a good restaurant.  I followed it exactly as written and it came out just great. Just remember to use the double strength beef broth.  (I almost bought the "regular" strength in the store). Will definitely add this to my recipe collection!!

I used to cook with the canned condensed soup from the store, but changed to making a big pot of this in the summer when sweet onions are the best, then freezing it in 2 cup portions -- so much better and healthier! I do use all beef broth ILO broth & water for a richer soup.

This recipe was perfect exactly as listed (although i did cook the onions on medium for 30 minutes as they were not very cooked after just 10 minutes). Tasted just like in the restaurants.  I used Campbells Beef broth which did say "condensed" at the top.  And i did add about 2 teaspoons of "Better Than Bouillion - beef flavor" since i had it and thought it could not hurt.  Doubt it made much difference.  I used very fine red wine which i happened to have on hand.  In summary, I do not think the reipe needs to doctoring whatsoever to taste just perfect :)

This was ok - I used sweet onions and pinot noir.  Came out a little too sweet for my taste.  Will definitely try again and maybe make some of the suggestions from other reviewers.

Sorry, but as french onion soup goes, we thought this was really flavorless.  I think the 2 1/2 cups of water in the ingredients ruins it; there was no explosion on our taste buds of onion, rich beef broth or even a hint of wine.  Also, the swiss cheese didn't have the cheese flavor I'm used to in restaurants, and I see that in other french onion soup recipes on this site additional cheeses such as parmesan and provolone are called for. This was pretty much of a letdown for our tastebuds, unfortunately.

Wasn't the best I have ever had, but was fun to make. We carmelized the onions for a very long time before finishing the soup, not sure if that helped the soup or not. I don't think that I will try this recipe again.

This was my first attempt at homemade French onion soup and it was amazing!!  However I only gave the recipe 4 stars because I made some changes after reading other reviews.  Like others here, I cooked the onions on low for about an hour before adding any other ingredients.  Also threw some garlic cloves in with the onions.  I chose to use 4 cups regular beef broth instead of a mix of condensed broth and water.  Also after reading some reviews that red wine was a little strong, I tried using white wine instead and it was terrific.  My husband is requesting this on a weekly basis!

Awesome recipe! My favorite restaurant just sold to new owners and changed the menu. No more French Onion Soup. So, we made our own! This was great and I did what a couple other people suggested and added parsley, thyme, worcestershire sauce, and garlic. I also really the the onions go on the stove and carmelize. My dad had never had the soup and couldn't believe how good it was. This recipe is a keeper! Thanks!

i agree that it's only a good starter for french onion soup.  we ended up using only 1 cup of water & an extra can of broth(i used chicken cuz it's what i had) and i ended up cooking the onions(with a clove of garlic) for about 30 minutes or so on med-hi until they got a really good brown on them, and then had to use some herbs, parsley, thyme, S&P and a dash or 2 or worcstershire.  hope this helps...

Yum, yum, yum.  We really enjoyed this.. I did not add any water, just a 32 oz. can of beef broth.  I also added worchestershire as was suggested.  Next time I will try to add thyme, but without the changes I think this is a winner.. and it's so quick!

This is really good soup and super easy to make.  I changed it a bit like other reviewers.  I added some worchestshire sauce.  Instead of Swiss cheese I put the toast in the bowl, put a slice of Guryere (sp) on top - then the soup - then covered it with grated Asiago cheese.  Really, really yummy.

this turned out great. 
at the suggestion of other users, I added some other spices, seasonings, and worcestershire.  I also put in a bit of romano cheese. 
The biggest adjustment I made though was using white wine instead of red, and I really think thats what put this soup over the top. 
So cook those onions slooowly and use a really nice white wine and you will receive rave reviews :)

My DH and I made this for dinner last night - with a few minor changes.  We used half a red onion (because we had it left over); we used 1 can of beef broth and one can of onion soup; about 3 tsp of beef bouillon and we added aboug 1 Tbsp of worcestershire sauce.  The end result was pretty good, but we found it lacking something...depth of flavour is what we decided.  This recipe might be better if beef stock (instead of broth) were used, so we're going to try that next time. The only other thing to mention is that we used mozzarella cheese instead of swiss and we liked it that way.

The hardest part was cutting the onions and waiting for it to cool. Great recipe, used beef consomme' and beef broth for a stronger flavor (no water or wine added). Also used Kraft Italian 5 cheese (shredded)for a cheesier top. My husband and kids HATE onions so much that if they are home I have to cook them outside on the grill, they tried this soup and couldn't get enough of it. Good thing I altered the recipe for 10!

Excellent flavor. Very simple, which is exactly the idea behind traditional french onion soup. I found using grated swiss cheese instead of slices gave the cheese a nicer consistency when it melted. Will definately make this again.

Amazing soup!  Just remember folks, the quality of the ingredients affects the flavor.  Buy the best red wine you can (drink the rest while you cook the soup!).

Absolutely wonderful soup! As close to fine-restaurant quality as we've tasted.

I liked this recipe.  I have been searching for a good french onion soup.  The only change I made was to use Chicken Broth instead of water.

This was DELICIOUS!!!  Just as good if not better as any I have had at restaurants.  I followed the advice of carmelizing the onions for longer, about 25 minutes and it was perfect.  My boyfriend loved it too!

This is the first time I tried french onion soup because I try it everywhere and I was certain mine wouldn't compare.  I was wrong.  I used this recipe with a few changes and it was just as good if not better than restaurant.  I caramelized the onion first, and added beef boullion to the water.  I also gave it a splash of garlic powder, salt, and worstechire (whatev) sauce.  It was delicious and simple!

Very happy with recipe.  As there are 6 different types of red wine; I used a Shiraz (or Shirah).  It has the deepest flavor of the reds; not sweet at all.  I used 4 vidalia onions and no flour.  I pressure canned the soup after I tried it.  It took over an hour for the onions to turn brown, so be warned.  I didn't make the crouton or cheese, I'm allergic to milk.  Followed the recipe to a T; except for the flour.  Very impressed, thanks for posting!

Good. I added salt and used a 32 oz carton of beef stock instead of doing the concentrate plus water. Not the same without salt. Let me also say, I tried a recipe from the food network first, and that turned out tasting like burnt turds. This was simple enough not to mess up. Ha.

This recipe is absolutely amazing. I used 3 bullion cubes - along with 3 cups of water - to make by beef broth instead of buying the canned beef broth (it end up being the same thing, really). I used a nice cab sauv as my red wine. OMGoodness!! It was restaurant quality; even my guests said so!!

I'm not really a fan of French onion soup but I saw a program on the Food Network where they served it and was then totally craving it! This recipe is so simple yet it has a ton of flavor! Because of the reviews, I made a few minor changes... I used a tablespoon of sugar to make it a little more sweet, and used more beef broth to substitute the water. Great recipe, and will definitely make again!

Maybe the broth I used was not strong enough, but I found this soup to be bland, and the red wine made it a rather unappealing color.  I have made French Onion soup before, and it always came out tastier than this particular recipe.

My picky teenage son actually said "If I thought we were having pizza and I found out we were having this instead, I wouldn't mind at all."  I didn't change a single thing on this recipe.  As is, it is better than anything I've had in a French restaurant.

This was a great base to start with but it definitely needed some adding to. Thanks to all of the awesome comments from everyone else I added the following: salt, thyme, garlic (powder/minced), black pepper, marsala wine, less sugar, and bay leaf... It definitely helped to cook the onions very slowly. I also used italian bread instead, sorry I know duh but I dig the italian loaves more! For the cheese I did swiss slices with a sprinkling of mozzarella... Provolone might have gone well with the swiss but I'm definitely a cheese lover... The only thing I didn't add but will next time is a little tobasco sauce like in the Panera Bread recipe.

I made this just as it says to.  It came out great but a little blah.  When I heated it up the next day I added some onion powder and that did the trick.  I will make this one again.

This was my 1st time making french onion soup and it was pretty good.  Next time I will definitely only put in 1/2 the wine and probably only 2 medium sized onions.  I used 3 and it was too oniony for me.  I also added 2 t. of the better than bouillon for added flavor.  I used all vidalia onions and I thought it was a little too sweet.  The french onion soup at Max & Erma's is my favorite and that's what I'm using as a comparision.  Not bad for my first try though!  Oh, took an hour to cook the onions just right!  Very time consuming but worth it!

Yummy, especially with toasted Ezekiel bread & fresh mozzarella! The broth was fantastic. High quality beef broth (like "better than bullion") is crucial. I also added some thyme and garlic, as suggested by other reviewers.

This recipe as written was so bland and after I added beef bouillon to compensate for the plain water along with garlic coupled with cooking the onions for about 40 minutes to caramelize it became a totally different recipe.  I am sorry this did not work for us as is.

This is one of my husband's favorites.  I always find restaurant versions of French Onion Soup too salty...but glad to say, this is great!  I couldn't find the condensed beef broth in my local grocery store so I used 'Better than Bouillon' base mix.  I ended up using 5 cups of water with 5 tsp Better than Bouillon, but my soup was a little too thick, so I added 1 can of beef broth.  I think my onions were larger than normal, so I was trying to compensate with the extra liquid.  I used cabernet sauvignon for the red wine - I used the 1/2 cup as stated in the recipe.  The soup came out delicious.  I did have some broth and a few onions left over, which were used as a base for pot roast the next day - perfect.  Thanks for the recipe; I have already added it to my recipe book.

Very pleased with the way it turned out.  Used cooking sherry instead of red wine because it is what I had.  I sized the recipe to two servings and it could have easily stretched to 4 servings if you were eating it as a starter, at least 3 generous servings.  Tip for those who have never made French Onion.... keep the cheese off the edge of the bowl...it makes for easier clean up!

This was a great recipe. I sometimes wonder why people rate things highly after they change the recipe by adding, exchanging or removing ingredients.  I realized that in some cases you have to use your best judgement by changing/adding ingredients slightly as your dish transforms to suit your taste.

We followed the recipe, but added three beef buillon cubes, only added a splash of red wine and used Swanson's beef broth (not concetrate) as we didn't realize the recipe called for concentrate.  Also, since the broth was not concentrate we reduced the amount of water added down to 1 cup. We topped with both provolone and swiss cheeses.  We have made this about 4 times now.  Yum.

Excellent base recipe, I increased the wine to 3/4 cup, added 3 cloves chopped garlic and a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce, and a package of dried onion soup mix as as stated the beef broth was too weak, will become THE recipe for us

This was wonderful!  I did make some modifiactions to it based on some of the reviews.  I used two vidalia onions and one yellow onion.  I used 5 cans of beef broth (not condensed)in place of all the water and I used 1/2 cup dry red wine and 1/2 dry white wine.  I also mixed shredded swiss cheese with shredded mozzarella cheese.  I kept everything else the same.  I served it with home made panini grilled sandwhiches and everyone loved it.  It was fantastic, top notch and easily as good or better than some of the finer Washington DC or Northern VA restaurants I've been to.

Extremely wonderful flavor!! i love it in spades!! One thing to do if you don't have oven safe bowls is to slice your bread and toast it with the swiss cheese on top in your toaster. Then you can ladle your soup into the bowls you have then top with the toasted bread and cheese. YUMMY!!

The best french onion soup I've ever had, and it was so easy to make!  I went by the recipe exactly.   If I would have known how simple it was I would have made it a long time ago.  I'll definitely be making this one again.

French onion soup is my husband's favorite, but I've never made it for him, so I decided to put this on our stay-home Valentine's Day menu. (Only married people can eat onions for romantic meals :)) He absolutely loved it and said it was as good as what he orders in the restuarant. It was a convenient part of the menu because you can make the soup early since you pop it in the oven to melt the cheese right before serving.

This was so wonderful!!!  I did change one thing... I put in 3 cans of beef broth and only 3/4cup of water.  Very tasty!!!
*I Had to add this, after making it again, I still used 3 cans of beef broth, and 1/2 cup of water, used a different wine this time, big difference, much better!  The type of wine you get is important, because you can taste it quite a bit.  I thought it really added something, because it didn't just taste like beef broth.  This is a favorite of ours, for a special occasion, or just for something different!

Almost excellent, but the beef broth gave it too heavy a flavor.   A vegetable broth probably would have been better.

Normally I love french onion soup, without the onions. (it's a quirk of mine). So I only cup up one onion to put in this. Boy was I sorry, the taste is delicious. I did improvise like past reviewers by adding some worcheshire sauce and some salt and pepper. Of course I had to do it ghetto style by using regular sliced bread croutons and using provolone cheese leftover from some French Dip sandwiches the week before but all in all 5 stars, considering I would rename my improvisations to Ghetto French Onion soup. ;-)

I'm not sure why others think this soup is bland.  It's delicious!  Tastes just like the soup my mother makes.  I did do a couple of things differently: I used a little less sugar, I let it simmer for about 35 minutes and when it came to adding the flour, I combined a tbsp of flour with some water in a small container and then slowly added it to the onions so there weren't any lumps.  Do add some salt and pepper.  I'll make this again!  Thanks!

Yummy!  Upon recommendation of some of the other reviews, I doubled the amount of butter, and added some Worchestire (sp?) sauce--about 1 1/2 tablespoon.  Also, it took a lot longer than 10 minutes to cook down the onions, but it was well worth it!!!  Also added some salt and ground pepper as well.

My first time making French onion soup, and it was easy and amazing! "Restaurant quality, or better" my husband raved. I did follow other reviewers suggestions, and I used provolone and mozzarella cheese, but I'll try Swiss next time. Excellent basic recipe! Thanks!

I've had some really high end ($$$$) onion soup, at well known restaurants, and I've gotta say, this was just as good. 
 
TIPS: 
- Take this recipe with a grain of salt; use it as a base. Taste and test throughout making it to add/subtract ingredients as YOU feel needed.  
- Use a mandeline to ensure the onions are cut very thin and consistent.
- Let it sit. Let it sit and stand for at least a few hours, to really infuse the flavours. 
- Brown the onions! That's where all of the deep flavour comes from.

this was great! I used water and beef base instead of broth, about 2Tbsp or to taste. I didnt use the sugar, as the wine gave it enough sweetness. Used croutons because I didnt have the bread.

I found that using a packet of brown beef gravy mix works well instead of beef bullion. Use one or two packages and then water to get the right consistency.

This recipe is fabulous! 
The only problem I had was that it's very hard to find condensed broth, so I added 3-5 organic beef bullion cubes ( it depends on who I cook for) to the broth. I have read other reviews, and they say to skip adding the water. That's another option as well, but I prefer adding the bullion cubes instead. I also added one whole stick of butter (salted or unsalted ...that's up to you) and I sauteed the onions longer as in 30 minutes or so.  Also, if you don't have french breach, any kind of bread will do depending on what you or your audience will like.  All in all, this is a great recipe and very easy to make!  
PS... I soak my onions in cold water so that they don't make me cry too much!  
(Peel before soaking!)  :}

This is actually the 1 out of 2 things my husband will cook. And it is delicious. So much flavor, the onions are so tender and easy to eat. The cheese he puts on it can be a little much, it can somtimes get hard to swallow a big wad of melted cheese but that doesn't deter me from enjoying this! Absolutely delicious and one of our favorites!

This onion soup was really delicious! I made it for my parents on Valentine's day and they both said it was better than any french onion soup they ever tasted. I had never eaten french onion soup before and I loved it. It was a bit heavy though and I got full really quickly. I followed the directions that was given and it came out perfect. You really have to reduce the soup for a long time to get the flavor stronger. I'm definitely going to make this again!

I doubled the amount, used yellow onions 1 or 2 white onions -NOT sweet onlions- It took quite a bit longer to brown the onions.  Try at a high to medium heat, added Cabernet Sauvignon red wine by Clos Du Bois (very reasonable cost)  I used beef broth by Campbells soup and Aujus in a generic gravy packet which really spruced it up.  I bought FRENCH GARLIC CROUTONS baged in the store Mozerella was my choice of cheese (whole milk Frigo) and nuked it for 1 min. That made it awesome as heck!

I thought I had beef buillon, but added a packackage of lipton onion soup mix and 1 chicken buillon..... This by far was the best french onion soup ever...... I gave 3 stars ause the basics were there, but not the flavor!!!!

I followed other comments and subbed out the water for beef broth and added a bit of dried thyme at the very end.  We all loved this and it will become a winter staple for my family.

Great Recipe!  Use TURKEY stock with the leftover carcass which is the richest broth and so easy to make.  Then you won't need the water but just use 6 cups of broth.   Also, cook the onions really slowly for 30-45 minutes and this is sensational!

i really thought this one was 6+ stars. I loved it!! And pretty simple to make after you get over the tears from all the onion slicing. Be sure you notice that the recipe calls for condensed beef broth. I just tried it with a bay leaf and some thyme and it was good, but not completely necessary. I like this is mozarella cheese too.  Yum!

Oh yeah,....thats the stuff!!! All I can  say.  The only thing I did differently was chop the onions up instead of just slicing them.  Now I guess that's all I can say.  Thank you.

I just made this soup today at 10 pm and I finished exactly an hour later. This is my dad's favorite soup and this is the first time I made it and he said it was the best, and so did everyone else that had some. I adjusted it a bit adding more wine but thats it really. And I used asiago cheese instead of swiss. It was a really big hit with everyone. I must say though if you're going to eat this you shouldn't eat anything else for the entire day because it is REALLY fattening.

Great french onion soup without cooking it for 3 hours!  I only used half the water and used additional low sodium beef broth in place.  I'm sure I used extra red wine but I didn't measure.  I think next time i'll try provolone cheese instead of swiss.

By using beef consumme and a touch of white wine instead of red, the wine isnt overwhelming, although I like red wine also.  As far as the onions go, mine calls for 8 medium sweet onions, but it makes alot and keeps in the refrigerator for a week, freezes well also.

Great recipe, I followed most of the recipe as well as advise from prior reviews. I did add a small amount of Wostershire , and I did change the cheese to Guyere cheese. The only thing I might do differntly next time is add a LITTLE less red wine, somewhere in between 1/2 and 3/4 cup.

I thought this soup was great!  Did add some thyme, salt, pepper, bay leaf, and worcestershite sauce.  I used three cubes of beef boullion to three cups of water, since I did not have canned broth.  I also mixed 1/4 cup red wine with 1/4 cup dry sherry cooking wine.  It came out delicous.  My ten year old who loves French Onion Soup, was my tester and he loved it.  I also used vidalia onions only!

I love this recipe!  Very simple to make.  I used provolone cheese and I also added worcestershire as well.  It's a keeper for me on cold nights!

I thought this soup was very tastey.  Like others, it took longer for my onions to brown.  I used campbell's beef broth. I also added about a T. of sugar because I had some very potent onions.  I also added about 2 T of Port with the red wine.  I will have a hard time ordering French Onion soup in a restaurant again!  Thank you for this great recipe!

This was very tasty. I did not use the red wine, and I used half onion seasoned beef broth and half plain beef broth, Uncondensed. A dash of Wosterchire sauce and seasoning salt were added.

This was a great recipe.  I used some brown sugar instead of the white and also added some Worchester sauce.  My roommate has never liked French Onion Soup in the past but tried this and asked for his own bowl!  My boyfriend also asked me to cook it again!

This was delicious. I would change the portions next time in the following ways: 3tbs butter; 2 small onions; 1/3c wine; 2 cans uncondenced beef broth. This is a note as much to myself as anyone. These portions will work out better in my oven bowls instead of having too much like I did last time. The onions are very sweet and the broth is great.

Way too much wine in this recipe. It overwhelmed the flavor of everything else, and it was a mild wine. Not one I'd make again.

My mother always made the best french onion soup. When I went off to college I wanted to make some for Valentines Day and couldn't get ahold of her. I found this recipe, and it's the same thing! I think this is the most delicious French Onion Soup I've ever tasted, and I've tried quite a few varieties. Unfortunately, I couldn't get any red wine, so I just used more broth and no water... it was still delicious. Though I'd recommend using the wine if you've got it. Also, I like lots of bread and cheese, so I put two slices of bread. :)

I'm not much of a soup fan. This is the only one I really like and this recipe was great! 
Since I'm new to cooking I didn't know that leaving the butter and sugar a little while before adding the onions would make them darker brown. I'll try that next next time.

I'm sorry to rate this so poorly but I thought it was terrible. I make French Onion soup often, eat it when I go out, and have had it in France, and this is some of the worst I have ever had. It was so bland, I couldn't taste anything but a touch of wine. I added some thyme, fresh parsley, worcestershire sauce to perk it up some, and it still did not help. Finally, I salted what was left and that gave it some taste. I feel like I just wasted these ingredients. Sorry, Alison, but I will not make this again.

I think this soup was absolutely great... but, it was verrry bland and had to make modifications based off other users' comments.  I used one less onion for more broth, added 4 big shakes of worscht-sauce, 1tbsp. sherry and 1tbsp. lemon juice.  I used Jarlesburg cheese and that gave it a slightly sweet flavor.  Let me tell you, I was sceptical at first so I tasted the soup as I added - It was sooo much better but, this recipe deserves 3*'s for the effort and a good base!

This was my first time making French onion soup...I was really surprised how easy it was.  I used day-old French bread instead of baquette and it tasted fantastic...bread gets soggy in the soup anyway so you can't tell the difference!!

This was delicious. I used it as the first course of a valentines dinner for my husband. I didn't use the bread, just the cheese. I only used 2 onions, 3 seemed like too much. I didn't have red wine on hand, so I used grape juice (only 1/4 cup) and a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar. Wonderful flavor, but the flavor changed quite a bit by the next day.

This was a tasty quick recipe.  I made it one Sunday night.  I used mozzerella instead of swiss cheese.  I like the melting quality better with mozzerella or provolone.  My in-laws even loved it so much, they asked for the recipe!!!!  This is a keeper.

My husband and I love French Onion Soup, so we gave this recipe a try.  I did find it was all 'high notes' in the flavor, so I used the soy sauce as one reviewer suggested, and it added perfect depth.  With the glug of soy sauce, this is one of the best FOS we've tasted - the recipe is definitely a keeper.

This is WONDERFUL!  Very rich and tasty.  Only one advice: unless you will eat the soup right away, don't add the bread, only the cheese (it will still melt w/o the bread).  If you wait before eating, the bread will ultimately soak up so much of the soup, and therefore will very mushy.

I made this for only two servings and had to add a cube of beef bullion to the mixture for extra flavor.  Very good however.  I imagine w/o the extra flavoring however, it might be sort of bland.

i love this recipe!!!
i've made it a dozen times (i'm a college student, so it's a rare treat!)
Instead of the beef broth, i found it tastes even more amazing with chicken broth and beef bouillon cubes to taste.
Trust me!!!

The onions take longer than 10 minutes to  become golden (more like 30+)  but let them cook.  Drink a glass of the wine while the onions are cooking.   I used a nice $10 Cabernet Sauvignon and it is wonderful!

With adjustments in the ingredients it was awesome.  I used boxed beef broth and left out the water.  Adjust liquid to taste and add a wine you would actually drink, not something you want to get rid of.  Vary the cheese.  Anyone can make this.  Mine was a hit.

This was restaurant quality French onion soup. I use a carton of beef broth plus 1 can instead of the water and condensed broth. I toasted home made sourdough bread  that I had on hand instead of the French bread and topped with Swiss and a touch of mozzarella that melted perfectly. This is a recipe to impress! Thank you

I have never even tasted french onion soup, so I depended on my family to rate it. It was easy, delicious...and filling!  I took some suggestions of other ratees as well as a man I met in the grocery store. I used yellow onions rather than sweet, used 4 cans of beef broth rather than water and condensed soup, added a shake of Worcestershire sauce, and added about 1/2 tsp of salt. I used Gruyere cheese, which was a little thick and chewy, but still good. I loved it myself and was asked to make it every Wed night for dinner. :-)

This would be a good recipe if it had any flavor. If you lose the water (or at least cut it in half, it will work). I reduced it for a while and added more beef broth, and it was OK. Even then it still needs some salt.

This recipe wasn't difficult to make, however, it was very, very bland.  In the future I would replace the water with more broth to give it flavor, possibly adding in a few beef bullion cubes as well.  I did add in the wine this time although I think in the future it will be optional for me.

This recipe is the best! I only add more onions and a bit more butter, because I really like lots of onions! The flavour is perfect! I cube my I toasted baguette and cover with whatever shredded cheese I have before baking.

I tried this tonight mostly because my husband loves french onion soup. I tried some modifications suggested by another review and it still needs some adjustment. 1/2 stick butter is enough, 2 large yellow onions isn't enough. I used 4 cans (2 cartons) of broth. I would rather have mozzarella on top as opposed to swiss. Also, it definitely needs some salt. I put in two teaspoons (guesstimate) and that still wasn't enough for my husband. The bay leaf was a good touch. I will definitely try the recipe again. Just with some more modifications to make it more how my husband likes it.

Awesome soup!! I used to eat this soup a lot when I lived in Grand Forks, ND. I haven't eaten it in almost 15 years and the soup I made tasted just like I remember it. I have never made French Onion Soup before and I was a bit intimidated. This recipe is so easy and it tastes incredible!!!

Bland, Bland, Bland. Yuck. This is the 1st recipe that I've made from allrecipes that was poor.  I doubled the recipe and scaled the ingredients accordingly, and think I need to add a beef boullion cube to enhance it. It just has NO beef flavor at all!  Boooo.

I have to agree with some of the other posts. A bit flavorless and for me it lacked that richness that I usually get with this kind of soup.

This soup received a mixed review in my family.  My husband liked it.  My daughter thought it was OK.  I didn't like it very much.  It was difficult to judge how much onion was correct.  I had large onions, and thus used too much.  I didn't like the wine taste and it was too purple.  I'll try another version of soup before I make this one again.

It took about 20 mins for the onions to caramelize nicely. The only thing I did differently was to add some freshly ground pepper. This wasn't the best French Onion Soup ever but it certainly satisfied a craving. Thanks, chefbuzz!

Great recipe.  I added a garlic clove, cut into 3 (not smashed) just to add a little flavor, plus a bay leaf, some thyme, and a tiny bit of sea salt.  Also added a splash of Worcestershire as reccommended. Used a provolone and mozzarella mix.  Very good!

This was my first time making French Onion Soup, So I really had no idea how it would come out.  I followed the recipe to a T, but if I was to make this again, I would definately make some changes.  I used low sodium beef broth, which wasn't a good idea.  It made the liquid in the soup very bland.  It definately needed more flavor.  We added some salt before eating, and it made a huge diffence.  I recommend really letting the onions carmalize, and get nice and brown.  I think this recipe is pretty good, but needs some adjustments.

In a last minute attempt to make French Onion soup, I found this recipe. It wasn't quick but very easy and very delicious. I just happened to have a little single bottle of red wine and it went perfectly in the soup. I did change the servings to two since I was the only one who was going to eat it but my 13 y/o son ate the other bowl. Now that must be good!

This french onion soup will rival any restaurant version!  I reduced the wine to 1/4 cup because of the strong taste.  The soup is especially good with home-made croutons and freshly shredded swiss!

Great soup.  My guests raved about how great it was.  One of them is a French Onion soup snob of sorts and said it was some of the best she's had.  I didn't have condensed broth so I added concentrated beef base (quantities on package) and cornstarch (about 2 1/2 tbsp mixed with 1/4 cup or so of cold water).  Good stuff.

This is it-the perfect french onion soup!I took a reviewers advice and substituted non-condensed beef broth and therefore did not add any water. I used a total of 40 ounces pure beef broth and it was excellent! Just the right amount of richness and not too salty!

The first time I made this recipe I used cooking wine from the supermarket.  It was good but the wine overpowered the rest of the ingredients.  For the next time, I bought a bottle of Beaujolais and it came out PERFECT.  Thank you Allison!

Really yummy, and very simple. I wound up using twice the butter the recipie called for, however, as there wasn't enough "pan juices" to make a good roux.

I have had better French Onion soup, if only I could find that recipe!  I know the difference is in taking more time to build the flavours.

Absolutely delicious.  I used mozarrela, provolone and swiss lorraine cheeses altogether.  Will never make a different recipe than this one.

It was very good.  I made it with Gruyere cheese instead of Swiss cheese.  I will make it again.

This was the easiest recipe.  I thought the recipe looked too easy and too bland for me. I thought I would have to add some ingredients, but it turned out wonderful. It tooked no time at all...cook the onions and dump the juices in.  Awesome!!

Very easy to make and a great tasting soup. Have made several times and everyone has enjoyed this soup.
