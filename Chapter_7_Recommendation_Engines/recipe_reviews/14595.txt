This turned out to be a pleasant surprise. Here are the changes I made to what is now my favorite dish. In the gravy, I used a can of French Onion soup as well as a can of Cream of Mushroom and a packet of Dry Onion Soup. I omitted the salt due to the high sodium content in the soups.  I'm glad I did. I doubled the gravy except for the ketchup...kept it at 1/4 cup while doubling the rest.  I also added a jar of mushrooms to the gravy.  After browning each side of the patties (and yes, having them fall apart slightly), I transferred the patties to a foil-lined casserole dish, put the gravy on top, covered the dish, and cooked it at 375 for 45 minutes.  I was worried the patties wouldn't get all the way done because they were pretty thick, but they turned out perfect!!! We had it with brown rice (and had just enough wonderful gravy to go along with it!) and steamed broccoli. This is a new favorite recipe for my husband and me.

I only rate a recipe if I make it as is, I don't think it is fair to make changes and then rate a recipe.  So as-is this recipe is really good, 4 stars.  The second time I made it I followed other reviewers advice and added Cream of Mushroom soup and sauteed onions and that made it 5 stars!

The "steaks" themselves were tasty (heavily altered with additional seasonings).  My steaks held their shape quite well.  I cooked 1/2 batch on the stove and another batch in the oven... preferred the taste of the stove cooked batch, but the oven cooked batch tasted good too.  

The great disappointment with this recipe was the sauce - it was horrible, to put it kindly!  I followed the advice of others to drastically cut the ketchup - but it didn't do much for the flavor.  It was far from authentic tasting.  I had extra patties and no sauce (not that I would have used the sauce anyway) - the next day I decided to try using Liptons Mushroom and Onion soup mix for the gravy.  I followed the package instructions for making gravy... DELICIOUS!  It was hands down the best tasting sauce for salisbury steak and so simple to make.    

So, if you're craving an old cafeteria food favorite - don't waste your time with the recipe for the sauce - buy a box of Lipton Mushroom Onion soup mix and make the gravy with it - you won't regret it!

Great and simple recipe as is. Thanks for a new addition to our home cooked meals.

*** Note: I just wanted to add that when people completely change a recipe and then rate it low it is somewhat moronic. You are not rating the recipe we are looking at you are rating your own recipe. It really is not the nicest or the most helpful thing to do (IMHO).

The only reason I gave this recipe four stars is because I ended up doing a lot of tweaking based on other recommendations.  I ended up with a WONDERFUL meal.  I took the following suggestions: I added chopped onion and garlic to meat mixture before browning.  I added a can of cream of mushroom soup to French onion soup, and mixed in a small amount of brown gravy mix to give it some color and thickened it up a bit.  I omitted the ketchup and doubled the amount to pour on top of garlic mashed potatoes.  For those who had trouble keeping the patties together, try this as was suggested before.  Instead of cooking in a skillet, place browned patties in a foil-lined casserole dish, pour gravy over top, and bake at 400 for 30 mins.  Your patties will stay together nicely!!

The best salisbury steak ever!!  The sauce is great...I browned the steaks in a fry pan and then cooked them in the oven with the sauce poured over them for 30 min. at 325 degrees, covered...they were soooo tender and juicy. Family loved it....will make again very soon.

I made the recipe as is and it was really very good. I would never attempt to rate a recipe that I had made ANY changes to as I would not be giving a fair assessment of the recipe as written. It would be like rating my own recipe. I think everyone who posts a recipe has a right to hear what people think of their recipes, as written. Once you tweak it, it's yours. I liked this just fine. When I make it again, I may alter a few things, but no one here will know about it.

I made this recipe a couple of times "as is" - Will give 3 1/2 ***.  Did not like the ketchup and not enough gravy.  After a few modifications... FIVE STARS *****!  Here are the modifications I make each time now (thanks to a compilation of others' suggestions on this site):  1.) Chop up one medium onion (fine) and mix it with the hamburger  2.)  I used 3 TBL Crisco to brown the steaks in the pan (and then drained before I added the gravy 2.) Double the gravy ingredients and omit the ketchup completely 3.) Add 1 can Mushroom Soup, 1 Pkg. Lipton's Dry Onion Soup Mix and 1/2 Cup brown gravy (I use Campbell's most of the time, but any brand works fine).  I prepare the steaks on the stove (don't use the oven as some have suggested), and they turn out perfectly.  Serve with mashed potatoes, fresh green beans and Romaine Salad (with dried cherries or cranberries).  Yummy!

This is, by far, my favorite salisbury steak recipe. I try to double the gravy because it's so good and just doesn't seem to make enough otherwise.

This was very good and so easy!  I only made two changes:  I used Onion Soup Mix in 1 1/2 cups water with a boullion cube and used brown gravy instead of ketchup (a family preference).  Served them with garlic mashed potatoes - it was great!

I have this exact same recipe at home and this has been one of my family's favorite recipes for years. Over time I have changed the original recipe though; I double the ingredients for the sauce because I felt there wasn’t enough to drizzle over the hamburger when it was done. Just my preference. The original recipe said to put the hamburger over egg noodles but I make garlic mashed potatoes and corn. YUM

Very good for something quick and easy to make with ground beef. I added garlic powder to the meat mixture and fried the patties in bacon fat for added flavor. I doubled the amount of gravy, substituted red wine for the water, and added 8 ounces of sauteed mushrooms. This is great comfort food!

This has become a regular in our home. The patties are tender and flavorful and we enjoy the sauce. You can always reduce the amount of ketchup for a less tomato-like taste.

A nice rendition of a true American classic usually found in Mom and Pop Diners all over America. Easy on the pocketbook and a quick recipe to make for busy nights.  Didn't have a can of condensed onion soup, so I subbed a packet of Lipton's Onion Soup.  Threw in sauteed mushrooms I had in the fridge which gave more flavor to the dish.  The simplicity of this recipe makes it one that will be reached for from time to time.  Comfort food at it's best!  Thanks for the submission Kelly.

These were great with a few changes. I used closer to 2 ½ lbs of ground beef. Added almost a half a can of the French onion soup. Still added one egg, used seasoned bread crumbs instead of plain, more than a ½ a cup just enough to get my meat from being to watery. I added no salt to this and ½ teaspoon of pepper. I put this meat mixture in a container and in the fridge for an hour. I think this helped to combine the flavors. Then I shaped these into elongated patties about a half an inch thick or more. Then I put 2 tablespoons of butter into a pan on medium heat and brown the patties. My patties did not fall apart. I took out the patties and whisked in almost a ¼ cup of flour to the butter. This helped me get a thick sauce then added one and a half a can of French onion soup. You don’t need to add the other whole can of French onion soup but this makes lots of gravy for mashed potatoes. I added 1 squirt of mustard ¼ cup of Worcestershire sauce and 2 squirts of ketchup and half a cup of water or so. I let this boil for 2-3 minutes to thicken up then add my patties into the sauce and lower the heat to medium low for about 15-20 minutes covered. I don’t measure anything or time anything but I’ve made this several times and it comes out wonderful. The meat comes out very moist I will make meatballs next as an appetizer or even a meatloaf would excellent. My boyfriend and his family love it and there are never leftovers. Hope this helps.

Excellent recipe to work from, even my picky son loved this.  I browned the steaks in a pan then put them in the crock pot.  I poured off most of the grease from the pan, sprinkled a tablespoon or so of flour and cooked it for one minute.  Stirred in one can of french onion soup, one can of cream of mushroom soup, a can of beef broth and a package of Lipton onion soup mix.  Added a few shakes of Worcester and cooked until hot.  Poured this over the steaks in the crock pot and cooked for 3 hours on low.  The meat is melt-in-your-mouth tender, the gravy flavorful and plentiful enough to serve over mashed potatoes.  Topped the steaks off with mushrooms sauteed in butter and garlic.  I was afraid the gravy would be way too salty even though I added NO additional salt, but it wasn't.  I'm not a person who salts her food and I found it just right.

I followed the recipe and changed very little -- just made extra gravy and used the idea of Progresso Onion soup. It was fantastic! I hope everyone keeps reviewing recipes and gives alternative ideas.

If you are having trouble with the patties falling apart, form them and then put in the fridge until firm.  Also to make more sauce (gravy) to serve over mashed potatoes or noodles, dissolve 1 or 2 beef bouillon cubes in a cup of hot water to add to the dish. Thicken with some corn starch to desired consistency and adjust seasonings accordingly.

This recipe is wonderful exactly as written.  It is just like the way I do meatloaf, so that is why I like it.  Making more gravy is easy.  Just change the number of servings to a higher amount and follow the recipe for the gravy as written.

When I told my husband what we were having for dinner last night he was less than thrilled, until he tasted it that is.  His response was "this is GREAT."  

As I almost always do I changed the recipe to fit our family. I made the "steaks" almost exactly as listed except I omited the salt.  Too much sodium in the soup. I also added garlic powder and onion powder.  I pan fried just to sear them and then moved to the oven. 

For the sauce I sauteed mushrooms and onions.  I then mixed the remaining soup, double the flour, 1/2 package of McCormick au jus mix, 1 can of water and garlic powder. I reduced the ketchup to 1 tsp and the worchestershire sauce to two drops. I stirred until thicken and poured over the steaks in the oven.  Baked about 30 minutes and I agree with my husband they were great.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made several changes to this recipe due to the comments of others.  The recipe really turned out great.  My brother, the very picky person he is said this is by far the best Salisbury Steak he has ever had.  I put 2 Tbsp of the canned French Onion soup into the meat mixture and used 3/4 cup of fresh bread crumbs instead of dry.  I also put 1/2 pkg Lipton Onion Soup mix and a teaspoon of Worcestershire directly into the meat along with 1/4 tsp of dry mustard.  Used the rest of the ingredients for the meat mixture as in the recipe omitting the salt.  For the gravy after browning, used the rest of the canned soup, only 1 Tbsp of ketchup, 1 Tbsp Worcestershire, 1/2 tsp dry mustard, 1/4 cup water, 1 beef bouillon cube (Knorr), and 1 small can mushrooms.  I used cornstarch for thickening instead of flour.  It didn't take much.  This is an excellent basic recipe!

Followed the recipe as called for.  The steak was absolutely delicious and tender.  The sauce...not so much.  I am glad that I tasted the sauce before adding it to the pan or I would have been upset.  The sauce tastes like a meatloaf topping that I make.   I just didn't care for it at all.  Thank goodness I had a pack of brown gravy mix and a jar of beef gravy in order to rescue the meal.  I will make this again without the sauce the recipe calls for.

On a side note, as I prepared the recipe for 8 servings, I browned all steaks in the skillet.  Before adding the gravies, I put half of the steaks in a casserole dish.  Poured the gravy over the steaks.  The steaks cooked in the oven were baked for 25 minutes at 350* and the remaining steaks were cooked on the stove top as directed.  The stove top steaks had the better flavor while the oven steaks had a more appealing look to them.

The patties themselves were delicious, but the gravy needed some work!  Next time, I will modify the recipe a bit.

In some ways, I almost feel the single star rating is unfair.  But this is a recipe in which one half is adequate, and the other I just didn't care for at all. As has been mentioned before, the steaks themselves turn out quite well.  I made my own onion soup from scratch, as I do not use many canned foods. And the burgers were fantastic!   The sauce however was too salty, and the ketchup flavour was too surreal and artificial.  A simple red wine and onion gravy would have been much better, and later was in a second attempt.  But I would not recommend the sauce.

This came out very tender and quite flavorful. It was fast, and the adults liked it, but the site of all of those onions turned the kids right off. I would make this again, but I would substitute a rehydrated package of dry onion soup mix. (In one cup water.) That way, I can add the onions to the meat mix, and leave them out of the gravy without losing flavor. Also, I would decrease the ketchup to 1/4 c. or so (too much tomato smell, kids thought it was meatloaf!) and add some beef broth or boullion.

I reviewed this dish 6 yrs ago and its still a keeper! I was glad to see it come up on the daily dish so I could print a new copy ...the 1st one is worn out. Make extra gravy is the only comment I have to add to the recipe..its so good you will want more!

My family loved these. I made exactly as recipe stated the first time but, reduced the ketchup on the second batch, because we preferred a more beefy flavor to the tomato taste. As others had suggested, I used a can of cream of mushroom and added a jar of mushrooms to the gravy. I used Italian bread crumbs for more flavor. Then I browned each side of the patties and put them casserole dish with the gravy on top. I baked them at 375 for approximately 45 minutes. Second batch will be the way I make these from now on. Soooo good. Thanks again.

I don't like to be a naysayer, but I expected much better based on the reviews to this recipe. We just weren't impressed. The sauce was too ketchup-y and other than that lacked any real flavor. Would have been much better with some kind of mushroom sauce. I think I'll just throw away the yucky sauce and break up the leftover meat into meat sauce or vegetable soup. Updated to add: I tried Rachael Ray's recipe on the Food Network site and it is wonderful. Try that one instead of this.

I was pleased with the flavor of the meat of this recipe. Like others, I placed the patties in a casserole, covered with the gravy (I browned the flour with the drippings) and baked at 350 for about 40 min. Thanks Kelly!

I have to tell you, this is not what I expected. I have had alot of salisbury steak but I am not to sure what to say about this recipe. Not to be rude, but you may want to call this skillet meatloaf patties. I feel there was absolutely to much ketchup. Not much gravy and the gravy that it did make was more of a ketchup sauce, not a brown gravy at all. I will, however, say that it is a very simple recipe to prepare. I would though, rather spend more time preparing to have a better recipe.

Just great.  I love Salisbury Steak, and this one was one of my favorites.  I used extra lean ground beef, and mixed it up very well (a meat grinder would work well), and made the patties as thin and oval as I could.  I got just the texture I wanted.. a very lean yet tender and juicy patty.  I didn't make any changes at all, and it was perfect!  Thanks Kelly.

I tried this recipe last night, it was delicious!  I had previously made a Campbell's soup recipe which came out gummy and bland.  My husband and I both thought this was 100% better.  I used some suggestions from previous reviews:  dry onion soup mix in the patties, sliced mushrooms and a splash of red wine in the sauce.  Yes, I should have doubled the sauce (it's SO good!), will do that next time.

Made this SO many times, made it again tonite & just wanted to say again that its GREAT! 

I made a new change to it this time (previously I omitted the ketchup because its makes it to sweet for my taste. I've also always double the sauce) but this time I used crushed RITZ Crackers in place of the bread crumbs & OOOH LA LA were they even BETTER & so much more tender.

Thanks again for this keeper!!!

This recipe was good! My husband said that sauce was too "tangy" so I dont know if that was from the soup or the ketchup or what. We added fresh mushrooms to the sauce. We ended up making a double batch of the sauce. I liked it, it was very easy to make. I would probably make it again. Very easy!

I made this as the recipe states, minus the salt (there's plenty in the French onion soup!), and it was really good.  Served with rice and Broccoli with Garlic Butter & Cashews from this website.  Thanks, Kelly Berenger!

I made some pretty big changes to this but the result was so good I'm giving this base recipe 5 stars.  I used about 2 1/2 lbs. ground beef and got 8 patties.  I increased the amount of soup to 2/3 cup but kept all other measurements as written.  For the gravy I mixed together the remaining French onion soup, one can of cream of mushroom soup, 1 cup beef broth and the remaining ingredients as stated but omitted the flour and worcestershire sauce.  This gives you a decent amount of gravy to serve with rice or mashed potatoes.  Everyone loved it.

Good and easy!  I like to stay as close to the recipe as possible, but sometimes change is inevitable.  I didn't have the soup, so I made my own. Water, 2 beef bouillon cubes, and finely grated fresh onion (my family hates the texture of onion- so picky!).  Let come to a boil and thicken with cornstarch.  Worked great!  I didn't have bread crumbs, so I pulverized some saltines.  That did the trick.  Also didn't have mustard powder (I'm seeing a trip to the grocery store in the near future?) so I used a full teaspoon of prepared mustard.  Skipped the ketchup  because I know my family wouldn't like that flavor.  Used about a pound of meat and got four large steaks out of it.  Tripled up on the gravy and added sauteed sliced mushrooms to serve over garlic mashed potatoes.  Went over very well!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a hit with my husband and 20 month old daughter! I followed the recipe almost entirely, used cornstarch instead of flour...and follwed other reviewers advice and made extra gravy...using condense beefy mushroom soup. The meat was extra tasty, and while did fall apart a little, was still very moist and flavorful. If you are looking for some good old fashioned comfort food, try this with mashed potatoes and some broccoli...perfect fall/winter comfort food. Thanks Kelly for a terrific recipe!

Good recipe.  Hubby had mixed feelings but I'm sure I'll prepare it again in the future.  Do use a good ground beef, as other do have a tendency to be oily.  Classic recipe.  Thanks Kelly.

This was so easy and very tasty.  My one year old stayed at the table so he could help me eat my serving.  I used dry onion soup mix and a beef bullion cube mixed with 1 1/3 cups of hot water to sub for the condensed french onion.  A great addition to my "once a week" meals.  Thanks!

In my haste, I misread the french onion soup portion and thought it was dried french onion soup, so that is what I bought.  I just added half the packet in the meat mixture and half in the sauce mixture and I had some sour cream on hand so I added about a cup (I tasted until I liked the flavor). What a great accident I made. It was very yummy, I will make again, but next time I'll add sauteed mushrooms.

I read reviews and changed the recipe a little. I used 1 package of Lipton dry onion soup mix. I mixed 1 tablespoon of the dry soup mix and 1/3 cup of water in the meat mixture. I browned the patties on the stove. I mixed the remainder of the onion soup mix with 1 cup of water and 1 can of cream of mushroom soup. I put the patties in a casserole dish and topped with gravy mixture. I baked in oven for 30 minutes. This was fantastic. I served with mashed potatoes. There was enough gravy for the patties and potatoes. This was very easy and quick to make.

I'm giving this a five, because I took the advice of a reviewer back in January. As per the reviewer I used Lipton onion and mushroon soup mix instead of the canned onion soup(which I do not like). I flavored the patties like a cross between meatloaf and meatballs. I added worch. sauce and about two Tbs. of ketchup to the meat along with the egg, breadcrumbs and a half a packet of the soup mix. Prepared the gravy with the remaining packet and a half of the soup mix. Once the patties were browned I drained the fat and let the meat simmer with the gravy and added browned mushroons. This meal came together in about 30 minutes and hubby said I have to make it more often. Now I keep the soup mix on hand for a quick and yummy meal.

I found this exact recipe over 3 years ago and have loved it every since.  I've made it for friends and family and they all want the recipe.  I usually double up on the 'sauce' because it's good on mashed potatoes!!  Very simple!

We loved this recipe, Kelly. To the meat mixture, I added a touch of A-1, a bit of garlic powder and an extra egg.
To the sauce, I added a cup of prepared brown gravy mix and a couple Tbsp. butter. Served with sauteed mushrooms and onions. We'll be loving this one forever, and thanks.

The recipe was great - I've always thought of Salisbury Steak as a tv dinner - not something I wanted to replicate at home. How wrong was I! Very tender & full of flavor. I did make a few changes - mostly as I wasn't able to fit all 6 patties in a skillet. Ingredients changed/added: I used a packet of French onion soup and added 12 oz. of water.; Italian breadcumbs in the patties, a package of fresh mushrooms, and a can of cream of mushroom soup. I browned the patties in a skillet and then transferred to a baking dish coated in cooking spray. I drained the grease from the skillet and added the mushrooms to the pan to brown a bit. I then added the ingredients as listed for the sauce with the addition of a can of cream of mushroom soup, whisked it all together, and let the sauce come up to a bubble. I poured it over the patties in the baking dish, covered with foil, and let the dish finish cooking in a 325 degree oven for 35-40 minutes.

This is now one of my favorite meals! I did do a few things differnt though. When making the patties I only used 1/2 can of the french onion soup because the first batch was a bit oniony & instead of bread crumps I used 1 cup of crushed ritz crackers. Using 1 cup helped the patties to stay together better. I browed the patties on both sides n then put them in a casserole dish. I then sauteed fresh mushrooms and sliced onions with real marsala wine in the same pan as I cooked the patties in and put them on top of the steaks. For the gravy I used the rest of the can of French Onion Soup, 1 can of cream of mushroom, 1 Tbl Worcesterhire, 1/2 tea mustard powder, a packet of lipton golden mushroom & onion soup and followed the directions for the gravy on the side & because of the strong onion tates I added a jar of Heinz Beef gravy. I poured everyhing on top of the patties and baked them in the oven at 350 for about 45 mins to an hr.

Was a very good recipe, however I did change a few things.  In the hamburger mixture I used a package of dry onion soup mix, a squirt of ketchup, egg and 1/4 cup bread crumbs.  In the sauce mix I used a whole can of condensed french onion soup, half can of beef broth, 1 Tablespoon of cornstarch, squirt of ketchup instead of 1/4 cup, dash of worcestershire sauce, and I added some thyme and parsley.  However, next time I will omit the ketchup and the worcestershire.  It would be better with a pure beef taste instead of the vinegar in the ketchup and worcestershire.

the steaks themselves were 5 stars, the only thing I added was some more chopped onion, per family taste.  the gravy however was 2 stars, edible at best. the steaks themselves were so good I made them again as mini meatloaves and everyone still raved. the gravy, never again.

I made the recipe as written the first time.  The second time, I made some simple changes which  improved it greatly.  First, after frying the steaks, I sauted 8 oz  of fresh mushrooms and a sliced onion in the same pan.  For the sauce, I omitted the ketchup and replaced it with 1/2 a can of campbell's golden mushroom soup.  I served the steaks with smashed potatoes.  The steaks tasted even better the next day.  Thank you Kelly for a great base recipe!

Awesome recipe.  I made it exactly as written except for the salt-didn't add any and used prepared mustard as that is all I had.  The first time I made it, I browned the patties as written, but since then I just form the patties, put them in a baking dish, pour the sauce and throw it in the oven. It comes out great every time.  I usually double recipe and make extra sauce if I can.   Love this recipe and so does my hubby, daughter and sister.  :)

Excellent...Moist and tender. I made extra gravy as well. Also, I added a packet of Lipton Beefy Onion to the gravy and a packet to the ground beef. I used Progresso French Onion instead of concentrate...so no water needed. Will make again for sure.

Very good but a little salty for my taste. I left out the salt since I felt like it was going to be too salty and I'm glad I did. I also added 2 Tbs half and half since I had it in my fridge. The half and half made for a nice creamy sauce. I will make this again. My husband liked it a lot.  It was really easy and didn't take much time!

Fantastic! I made this for my husband and bro-in-law. They wanted more. They said 10 stars. I made an extra batch of sauce which I recommend. Made with mashed potatoes and mixed veg and dinner rolls. We were all wanting seconds. My 2 year old also like it.

I made this tonight and it was delicious.  I did make some revisions but I think it would be good without them.  I doubled the sauce by using the remainder of the onion soup and 1 can of cream of mushroom soup.  Then doubled the rest of the ingredients except the worsteshire sauce.  Instead of the water I used beef broth.  I also sauteed 8 oz. of sliced mushrooms before frying the meat patties.  Absolutely delicious served over rice (for DH) and mashed potatoes for me!

Yummy! I used the steak from this recipe and the gravy from "scrumptious salisbury steak with mushroom gravy" from this site. Did have a bit of a problem with the patties falling apart, though. I think I used beef with too much fat and the patties almost ended up steaming in the juices that came out while browning. Next time I'll definitely use ground sirloin (what I always use, but they were out at the store.) or maybe even ground buffalo. Really tasty!!

I loved this! I had a serious craving for this childhood favorite and was quite pleased. I did have to change it according to what i had on hand. In place of the cond. soup I used Dry Onion Soup mix with 1 cup of water. And since I did't have the cond. soup I couldn't make the sauce. I ended up using a packet of brown gravy mix(prepared as directed om the mix)It was SO good and I KNOW I'll be making this again!

I absolutly love these burgers.  However we did not care much at all for the sauce that accompanies this recipe.  We just make a brown gravy to pour over it and simmer it in instead.

Husband thought it tasted like meatloaf. This was the first dinner he ever asked me to not make again. I didn't think it was that bad, but when I tried to reheat it was HORRIBLE!I used some of the suggestions but I still wasn't impressed. Thanks anyway!

We made this recipe last night and it was WONDERFUL! I substituted the can of condensed French Onion soup with a dry mix packet. Also, I added a can of beef broth to the sauce mix and an extra tablespoon of flour. It made the perfect gravy.

This is a super recipe! Very easy and quick. Great for a weeknight supper when you don't have much time. The patties cook up very quickly, and then while they simmer in gravy you can prepare a couple of simple side dishes. We loved it! This is also a perfect recipe for doubling: make twice as much, then put half in the freezer. It freezes very well, and when needed, you can just pull out of the freezer, heat, and serve. The recipe is also very forgiving: You don't have to measure everything exactly, just eyeball it. If you have any fresh herbs on hand, sprinkle a bit on top for garnish or stir into the gravy. Minced parsley or oregano work nicely. Paired with a heaping helping of mashed potatoes, this is just the ticket when you are in the mood for comfort food!

5 stars are NOT enough!!!! I do not usually care for salisbury steak but my family likes it. For once I actually loved it, too!!! This was great. The only change I made was I added some jarred, sliced mushrooms towards the end of cooking. DELICIOUS

This is absolutely wonderful!  I usually double the sauce just because I pour the sauce over egg noodles.  My picky 7 year old will have second helpings of this!!! It's definitely worth trying...thank you for this delicious recipe!

I just made this for dinner and both of my sons (5 yrs and 10 yrs) asked for seconds.  I don't ever remember them asking for that before.  My husband loved it as well.

The steak itself was not a good consistency and the gravy was just not good to us.  I am glad that I tasted the gravy before I put it over the Salisbury steak.  I ended up making brown gravy from dry mix and added a can of French Onion Soup to it.  The meat needs more seasoning.

This turned out wonderful after making a few alterations - To the sauce mixture, I added a splash of red wine, a tablespoon of dijon mustard, disolved a buillion cube in ½ cup hot water and omitted the ketchup.  To the meat mixture, I doubled the breadcrumbs, seasoned the meat with garlic powder, onion powder and black pepper, added chopped garlic, omitted the salt.  I browned the beef patties in a skillet and placed them in a baking dish, poured the sauce and baked in a 350 degree oven covered for 30-35 minutes until done.

Everyone loved these!  They all told me to make sure I give this a 5 =).  I have a habit of "tweaking" recipes to our liking and this was no exception.  I doubled the recipe and added some sausage to it as well.  After browning the patties, I added 1/2 cup of water to the pan and scraped up all the bits so it wouldn't be wasted and that liquid was added to the sauce (instead of plain h20).  I also doubled the sauce and added a can of cream of mushroom soup so we'd have more gravy and left the flour out since the soup thickened the sauce.  I then layered non-stick aluminum foil to a casserole dish and baked the patties covered in the sauce at 400 degrees for 30 minutes.  No dirty dishes for me!  Washed everything while patties were baking.  Thanks!

How wonderful to run into this recipe here - I've been making this exact recipe for years!  Hand written recipe cards and recipe box received as a wedding present 9 years ago, this was the best one of the lot.  The card said it was a LA Times recipe.  Anyway,we eat this reguarly, I've given out the recipe several times over the years too.  For those who say they don't hold well or break up - I can't use the egg because my husband is allergic, so I make the patties thick and don't press them in the pan.  They only get moved when I turn them over.  And I put a lid on the pan for the 20 minutes - helps cook thick patties all the way through, plus keeps in moisture so you get more sauce, which is great over mashed potatoes!

I'm having a hard time rating this one because my children are soooo incredibly picky (hubby is out of town on buisness) and needless to say they just picked at it.  Sooo, well I can honestly say that my Mom's recipe is much tastier than this, BUT I didn't think that this was bad tasting either.  I think that she uses cream of mushroom instead of the french onion (which is why I think that it wasn't great), and splashes it with gravy master (now I'm going to have to hit her up to make me some ;).  Thanks Kelly!

The french onion soup and the worchestershire sauce were two strong flavors that did not blend well.  The hamburger patties were good but we didn't like the sauce.  I won't be making this again.

Thank you to the other reviewers for your helpful suggestions!  Like others, I tweaked this slightly and was very happy with the results.  I added one can of cream of mushroom soup and one can of low sodium beef broth to the gravy mixture.  I omitted the water and the ketchup.  I seared the patties in a frying pan and placed them in a foil-lined 9x13 baking dish.  I sauteed one 8 oz. container of sliced mushrooms in the frying pan after removing the patties, and then I added the cooked mushrooms to the gravy mixture.  I poured the gravy mixture over the patties and cooked them in the oven at 350 degrees for 30 minutes.  Delicious!

I've been making these for years using beef broth for the gravy.  I much prefer the onion soup, who knew?  I followed the ingredient list, however I "cooked" the flour in the remaining beef drippings after I drained most of it, then added the liquids.  Easier to incorporate the flour without lumps.  Kudos Kelly!

This recipe is great as is. My husband and I absolutely love these Salisbury steaks. I wouldn’t change a thing and it’s so easy to make. People shouldn’t rate a recipe that they altered, it makes reading the reviews tedious and annoying.

Amazing!! This recipe is going into my family cookbook. My husband gobbled up his food, and went up for seconds, and kept raving about how well he was "eating". Lol. Fairly easy to follow, as well.

This was awesome! Our whole family loved it! Never tried Salisbury Steak before, so we weren't sure how it would turn out. Super easy, fun for the children to make with Mama and great tasting! Definitely in our family's menu to stay! :)

These were really tasty.  I only had 1 lb of gb but made the same amount of gravy.  My husband said these were just as good as my normal Salisbury steaks, but these were much easier, so I think I have a new recipe!

The only reason I gave this four instead of five stars is because I do not think it tastes like Salisbury steak but it does however taste like an amazing meat loaf patty. My husband says it tastes like an amazing meat loaf and he doesn't normally like meat loaf. We are making this again this week and it will have a permanent part of our recipe box.  Thank you for sharing.

this is the best salisbury steak recipe I've come aross so far; the only thing I did different was instead of water I added red wine and I sauteed mushrooms after browing the patties. My family absolutely loved it.

Easy and tasty!  My 20 mo old daughter loved it!   Really was afraid it would be too salty,but it wasn't..Did not really "tweak" it think I was just shy with the worcestershire since we don't eat much salt. (I never add salt when using soup etc) I think that people just feel the need to over season their food. it was a nice home-style meal that does not need extra herbs,spices or whatever..nice simple meal!  A keeper!  Thank you! 
We'll she is 5 now and still loves it!  Double the sauce.

This is a great recipe exactly as written.  It needs no tweaking and, if made properly, there is plenty of gravy for the patties and for mashed potatoes.  If the gravy is too thick for your liking, simply add a little water.  I will be adding this to the regular fall/winter rotation.  Great comfort food.

Delicious!  I used 2 lbs ground beef, 2 eggs and doubled the ingredients for the gravy.  After taking browned beef patties out of skillet I added 1/2 chopped onion to skillet before adding gravy.  Also when making gravy I added 1/2 cup of milk instead of beef bullion to make a creamier gravy and reduce salt.  I also did not add extra salt recipe calls for.  This recipe made 7 nice sized patties.  I made mashed potatoes & green beans to round out the dinner.  Will make again. Next time I will add mushrooms to gravy.  I think that will make it perfect.

I made this for the family last night, and they loved it.   I couldn't believe that something so easy and simple could look and taste this good.  Had some cold, and sliced on bread this morning with some mild mustard, and it tasted even better. I was sceptical at first, but since ground beef was on the menu for last night, I thought I'd try something different, and I am very glad that I did.  Served it with some Herbed Mash Potatoes, Carrots and Broccolli for some green colour.  Looked good, and tasted great.  The "Steak" went very well with the mash. This recipe is sure to become a staple of mine in future.  Excellent!

Delicious! After reading the reviews I decided to do something different with the gravy. I just make two packets of brown gravy and added the rest of the French Onion soup. It was perfect! I didn't alter the recipe for the steaks at all.

Comes out PERFECT every single time!!!  I originally found this in the Taste of Home cookbook but wanted to add it to my recipe box HERE just in case!  The kids gobble these up everytime!  I've made the patties ahead of time and frozen them for future use and they still come out awesome!

I did not have a can of french onion soup, so I used a package of onion soup mix, and made the correct amount with that.  This is one of our family favorites.  We love the gravy on mashed potatoes

I made the recipe exactly as written the only thing I did do was add another can of soup so there would be more gravy    We loved this recipe! It was so tasty and very simple to make. The kids loved it too! Great flavors. I will be making this often.

This recipe is good as written, but even as a ketchup lover I found the ketchup taste a bit overwhelming. I will probably cut it in half the next time I make this. And I will double the sauce. My husband loved it though and I loved how very easy it was.

I substituted Liptons onion soup mix which seemed to work well.  Sauce is too sweet with the 1/4 cup tomato, suggest using alternate (brown?) sauce.  Steak was yummy!!

Fabulous!  This is exactly the recipe that I was seeking when I discovered allrecipes.com years ago.  I have made this a lot.  I always use 1 lb. ground beef, because that's how I have it packaged for the freezer.  I don't have to add any more bread crumbs or anything.  Always delicious served with fluffy whipped potatoes and a crisp tossed salad or buttery green beans with garlic!

I'm only giving this 4 stars even though I changed the recipe quite a bit, I didn't like the ketchup in the recipe.  I doubled the gravy using one can of French onion and 1 can of golden mushroom soup, doubled all of the other gravy ingredients except the ketchup (I omitted the flour).  I followed another reviewer's suggestion and browned the patties on both sides then transferred them to a 13 x 9 pan and poured the gravy ingredients on top.  I also sliced one small yellow onion and put on top of the patties.  I covered the pan with foil and baked at 375 degrees for 45 minutes.  Next time I will substitute tomato sauce for the ketchup or leave it out completely.

I changed this so much that it is not a fair rating, I doubled the sauce ingredients so I would have more gravy. Used dry onion soup and canned mushroom soup. I baked the burgers first ( about 20min) and then poured off the grease and then I put the mixture on top and baked another 15 min. It was yummy!

I made this for supper last night. I followed the recipe except I omitted the salt.  My husband liked it so much he ate three steaks, a guest who popped in for supper had two, and I had one.  So much for planned leftovers!!!! This is yummy and I will make it again, but maybe I'd better double it!!!!!

So many great reviews and I had high hopes.  But we did not like it at all even though I followed the directions exactly.  It tasted like bad roadhouse fare cooked by a hashflinger named Stinky.  Sorry.

My review may not be entirely fair...I didn't have some important ingredients so I did what I could. I had one packet of dry onion soup. I put 2/3 of it in with the meat mixture and I also added about 1/2 tsp. of onion powder and garlic powder along with about 1/2 cup water and bread crumbs to the meat mixture. For the sauce I put the remaining onion soup mix, more onion and garlic powder, 1 1/2 tbl. of worschestire, 1/3 cup ketchup, heaping tblspn of flour and about 3/4 cup water. I didn't have mustard powder so I added about a tspn of dijon mustard. When I poured the sauce over the staeks it seemed thick so I added just a bit more water and let simmer for 20 min.....turned out amazing!!! My man said it was the best salisbury staek he's ever had and he's had ALOT of em'...maybe this review will help others out with some other options than the condensed soup that is called for. I think my method is also somewhat less fattening. I served with mashed potatos (soaks up the sauce) with corn and edmame. Thank you for sharing!

This will be a keeper. I omited the salt, and also used onion soup mix and added a can of mushroom soup. Per a couple of the other reviews. It made plenty of gravy for the mashed potato's.

I really liked this recipe. The patties were excellent. I made a few changes, I used dry onion soup mix (3/4 package) no worcestershire or ketchup. I did not use the gravy recipe, instead just made my own (brown gravy mix or beef boullion and cornstarch).

I thought these were just ok.It was my 1st time ever making Salisbury Steak, and I thought it was alot like meatloaf & gravy.

I made Knorr French Onion Soup, and added about 1 C of that to the patty mixture. I found that the patties were falling apart while frying them, so I cooked the other 1/2 of them on the George Foreman Grill.

Even a 39 yr old biker dad can make this excellent recipe. Family and I loved it.
I used 2-1/2 lbs ground beef mixed 1-1/2 packs liptons onion soup mix and other ingredients. I cheated with the gravy and used a jar of Heinz homestyle beef gray and another jar of mushroom gravy. I should have added one more jar of gravy though, gravy was a tad short when adding mashed taters to the meal. Used 2 eggs instead of one. Cut the ketchup down to a lil under a 1/4 cup. Had no mustard powder so used regular old liquid mustard. Garlic went nice in the gravy also. Also took advice of baking till brown in oven, worked great, and none fell apart. An A+ keeper. thanks for the tasty recipe.

This was great and a keeper for sure! I did make several changes though...
Instead of browning the patties in a frying pan, I baked them in a 350 degree oven until they were browned. Then I drained any grease that was in the pan and poured the gravy over the patties and baked until the meat was done.  I did add ketchup but only added a dash, and chopped up some fresh mushrooms and added to the gravy.

I served with mashed potatoes and corn and it was a hit. Oh I also seasoned the meat a little more with some garlic powder and a little bit of dry onion soup mix. Thanx for the recipe we were more than pleased!

I made this for my family last night and it was absolutely delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly except I doubled the batch of sauce for putting on the mashed potatoes.  This has got to be one of the best comfort meals I have had in a long time and very easy to make!

This recipe was so good my husband almost fell out of his chair. I changed the recipe a little. I used cream of mushroom soup b/c I couldn't find the soup that the recipe called for. I left out the mustard and salt and used a packet of Lipton Onion Soup mix. I also used Dale's Seasoning instead of the W sauce and added one small can of sliced mushrooms to the gravy. Also added more water to make more gravy. I will definately make this again and again.

I've made this for years, except I use cream of onion soup...add Worcestershire sauce and use prepared mustard (and very little catsup...too sweet).  I brown the outside of the patties quickly then finish baking in the oven and pour sauce over after meat is done.  'Shrooms are a good addition to the sauce as are thinly sliced onion.  Great on potatoes or rice.  I thin my sauce with water or milk to "stretch".

I followed the recipe as given but after reading some of the reviews already posted, I decided to double the amount of sauce so I would have enough to pour over rice. Doubling the amount of sauce makes a lot more than you need, though. The sauce was interesting, but I did find it rather salty and would suggest not adding any extra salt (condensed onion soup is salty enough) and cutting back on the ketchup and worcestershire as well. The texture of the sauce is nice. I do think that salisbury steak should be served with a more traditional gravy-like sauce, as many reviewers have already noted. A good thing I found with this recipe is that the meat turned out to be very soft and tender as well as nicely flavored.

My husband wanted me to make salisbury steak which I never have tried from scratch so I thought I would go to allrecipes.com.  I was sure there would be one there.  Sure enough, there was--and it was great.  My husband absolutely loved it.   Thanks Kelly, it was delicious.

I got this recipe in my AllRecipes newsletter and knew I wanted to try it, so my wife and I hit the grocery store with my AllRecioes app and loaded up. I've never made salisbury steak before but it was a BREEZE and it turned out wonderfully! This is a great recipe and if you're on the fence, TRY IT, you won't be disappointed!

Husband and son love this but when I forgot to add the mustard powder, they liked it even better. Guess will skip that in future. I do think it adds a bit of bitterness when I do use mustard powder. I also make this with turkey instead of beef.

I've been making this recipe for several months now. It has become one of my go to recipes. It's only my husband and I so I'll put together the entire amount of meat and then freeze half of the uncooked meat.

I made this for last night's dinner, alongside mashed potatoes, wilted kale, and corn muffins. I made it pretty well close to the recipe, only leaving out the ketchup and subbing the French onion soup with the melee of partially-used onion/beefy onion mixes I had laying around.  Although I found myself wanting to add fresh garden herbs of some sort to brighten this up,  I resisted and added only fresh onion, garlic powder, and a can of mushrooms, which was excitedly pleading to be saved from culinary anonymity in the rear of the pantry. Topped with a few sprinkles of French's french fried onions and this was VERY good!  Very reminiscent of something my mother would have made back in the 70s/80s.  Very pleasing to my Texas taste buds.  I would love to share a picture, but not a morsel was leftover from any of the meal.  The potatoes played pillow to the beef, the cornbread made way with the gravy. The kale, usually a main attraction, got swept up in the forkwind as the obligatory price of admission required for the indulgence of traditional meat-and-potato dinners. By morning, only the not-so-non-stick muffin pan lay hungover in the sink to tell the tale.

This is a family favorite, but like so many other reviewers, I made significant changes. I added garlic to the meat, used a can of mushrooms and cream of mushroom soup in the gravy, omitted the ketchup and mustard altogether.  I browned the parties first then transferred them to a casserole, covered them with the gravy, and baked it until the patties were done.

I am from the UK and stumbled across this recipe on my travels through recipe land. My family say its the best meal they have had in years and im inclined to agree with them! From a UK perspective I used Panko instead of breadcrumbs and as condensed French onion soup can be hard to get I used regular French onion and it worked perfectly.

This has become a favorite in my household. The only difference is I make mine with the onion soup packet instead of the can and omitted the mustard powder.  I make an extra packet of the onion soup and add the ketchup, Worcestershire sauce and some flour to make it a gravy for mashed potatoes or whatever we have on the side. I get requests for this at least every week!!

My husband and I made this recipe together and all went well, no fighting! Made as stated, no changes or subs on ingredients. Patty's did try to fall apart when turning over in fry pan, but in the end they where whole. My husband loved the sauce, which is tangy from the ketchup and Worcestershire sauce, two ingredients He Loves! All in all, it was a winner! Nice change from hamburgers, which he loves and as I said no disagreements. Thank you for submitting your recipe Kelly Berenger

I never liked the concept of salisbury steak. It grossed me out. This recipe changed my mind. I've now made it for my family of 4, and I've made it for a church dinner for 40 people. Super intense, addictive, crave inducing flavor. I think it's the worcestshire sauce that does the trick, plus the onion soup. At different cooking sessions I've subbed dried onion soup mix (reconstituted with water) when i didn't have canned french onion on hand, and i couldn't tell a difference in taste. I've also used the cream of mushroom substitution (instead of ketchup) for the gravy, and always doubled the gravy portions.. to.. well, get more gravy. We eat this until we want to burst, it's that yummy. Mashed potatoes and peas are my preferred sides. This is a keeper to impress anyone with 'home cooked gooodness'.

This meal is excellent.  I do, however eliminate the water because my family likes the gravy/sauce with a potent flavor. Also, it helps keep the sauce/gravy thick.  My husband enjoys this every time.

Very good! Quick easy and inexpensive. I heated a cast iron skillet and browned the 'steaks' not cooking them the whole way through. Then I layered them in a baking dish. I added 1 can of cream of mushroom to the 'gravy' and poured the over the top. Baked them in the oven for about 25 minutes.

I loved this one but did make two significant changes.  I omitted the ketchup and used beef stock in the meat mixture instead of the French onion soup...An excellent sauce can be made easily by using beef stock/broth, worchestershire sauce and adding corn starch (I used 1 1/2 cup stock, 1 TBSLP worchestershire, and a Tablespoon of cornstarch)  Mix well, and pour over meat.  I browned the meat patties and baked covered in oven at 350 for 30 minutes...If sauce isn't thick enough,  just uncover and bake uncovered for 5 or so minutes.  It was a delicious meal for us.

While I like getting tips on recipe changes, I'm one of those folks who think ratings should be based on the actual recipe, not someone's altered version, so I made this exactly as shown.  This is a good recipe which we will make again.  My husband and son went back for seconds. I liked the flavor, but I might want to tweak the seasonings a bit next time, and increase the gravy since we like lots of it - there was just enough to moisten your steaks with a little extra to put over mashed potatoes or rice.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was SO easy and so good!  I must admit, I screwed up in the beginning by putting in the entire can of soup - but it still worked out great - I just had to improvise the gravy.  Everyone raves over it nonetheless.  Definitely a keeper!

We needed a quick dinner with ground beef and decided on this randomly. I used dry onion soup mix since that was what I had on hand. I also left out the ketchup and mustard because I was a little afraid what the turnout would be and threw in a packet of brown gravy. Lastly I added in a whole sliced onion, because, well, I love onion. These tasted super yummy and I would make them again for sure.

This one's earned a spot as a staple in our family's rotation.  My kids literally line up for first pick as soon as I turn stove off when I'm making it, so it's one of my absolute favorites  on AR.  My picky husband, who swore he would never touch Salisbury Steak before I made this one, absolutely loves this dish!  Only thing I do differently is saute 2 cloves of diced garlic with a medium chopped onion to add to the meat mixture before forming patties.  If patties stick when browning, a tiny shot of sherry or white wine to help deglaze the pan when flipping does the trick for me.  You'll also be able to scrape up any meat sticking to the bottom of the pan when you add the sauce, so don't get too fussy scraping with the spatula beforehand.  Also, flipping patties too early while browning will make them fall apart.  I've tried the original recipe as well as doubling sauce ingredients while keeping the ketchup qty the same.  In my house, doubling the sauce wins hands down.  Give this recipe a shot, it's a keeper!

My kids and boyfriend liked it.  My patties fell apart!  What did I do wrong???  I had to make a second batch of the sauce to completely cover all my patties.  I usually don't fail my recipes but this one I did.  Now it's my challenge to get it right.  I thought it was ok tasting.

I followed this recipe to a "T" and it turned out very good and easy to make. I served it with a mock mashed potatoes (cauliflower) and green beans. It was a home style hearty dinner. Thank you very much for sharing this recipe I plan on using it time and time again.

I myself hate Salisbury Steak...  You know the gross cafeteria or TV dinner kind...  However my family loved this.  I had my hubby grill the meat patties and I made the gravy (from your ingredients) of which I actually enjoyed.  Patties with gravy were pretty darn good.  Had mashed potatoes & sauteed spinach.  Thanks for a good recipe.  Throw this together your way and it's a winner!  All depends on your tastes.  We liked the patties grilled.  Gravy was tasty on the grilled patties.

I made this last night for my boyfriend and my roommate, and they loved it! It turned out so delicious! I made it once before and followed the recipe and it was good. But last night I used someone suggestion to brown it then put it in the oven for 30 mins at 400 degrees... and it so so much better. I added some of my own ingredients too of course. I sauteed diced onion and minced garlic to the meat mixture as well as some as my favorite seasonings. Then I added turkey gravey to the french onion soup along with the seasonings to make a delicious gravey. I made some rice pilaf with the dinner, and it turned out so good, I couldnt wait to review it this morning! Yumm!! I'm gonna go have leftovers now...

I am teaching my teenage sons how to cook.  This recipe is very easy, and tasty with mashed potatos and corn for sides.  My sons were pleased with the dinner they made!  We did not change a thing!

The meat was good but did not like the gravy/sauce at all. Had way to much of a ketchup taste. I will make this again but with alot of changes.

I can't use canned soup because of the MSG so I made french onion soup (a recipe from this site).  This was a great recipe!  The only thing I would do differently is to double the ingredients for the gravy so it can be used on potatoes too.  Lots and lots of gravy!

I doubled the sauce and added a sliced onion.  I got 8 good sized patties out of this but they started to fall apart when cooking so I kind of mashed them up and just made it a sauce.  It was really good and my husband was raving with the first bite

Very good, a little salty, but still good. I cooked two paties alone, without the sauce and one of my two picky little ones liked it, which is rare. Cooked the rest as the recipie stated, all thumbs up. Would make again.

I don't know why I keep trying things with onion soup in them.  It's not my favorite flavor and leaves me with a bad taste in my mouth the rest of the night.  This was a tad bland and the onion soup overpowered every thing.

My family loved this dish.  I did not put in any ketchup but used the cream of mushroom soup with the condensed french onion soup, soup mix packet and a bouillon cube.  I served with garlic mashed potatoes. Another hit from Allrecipes!!  I only gave it a four because I changed the recipe some and although I enjoyed the meal I didn't like it as well as my husband and sons.  However they really loved it!

Wonderful recipe!  I followed the ingredients for the mean patties to a tee.  I then browned them on both sides in vegetable oil in a frying pan.  Then transfered them to a foil lined baking dish.  I put a few slices of vidalia onion over the top as well as a can of sliced mushrooms.  I took the advice of another post and made gravy out of Lipton Beefy onion soup mix.  poured it over the top, coverd with foil and baked it at 350 for about 30 minutes!  rave reviews from the kids.  finally...a new idea for dinner with hamburger.

This has quickly turned into a family favorite.  I do add a can of cream of mushroom soup to the gravy.  I brown the patties and then put them in a foil lined casserole dish. Cover with the gravy and then and bake at 350 for about 30 minutes at the advice of another reviewer.  The first time I made it I also added a packet of onion soup mix and it was just too much!! the 2nd time it was perfect.

Excellent recipe with a little tweaking (add 1 can of cream of mushroom and dried onion soup mix).  Brown on stove top, then bake with gravy in a 375 degree oven for 45 min.

Really good - won't ever eat premade frozen again.  Did do extra gravy and I a glad I did.  Be careful if you use two full cans of condensed onion soup to increase your water correctly or it comes out a little strong.  I did add a pack of lipton frenchonion mix.

Like most reviewers, I tweaked mine a bit.  To the ground meat, I only added the egg, breadcrumbs, the salt and pepper, and about 1/3 of can of cream of mushroom soup.  I would use 1 more egg because it started to fall apart in the pan.  Then while it was browning, I doubled the gravy using 2 Dry onion soup mix packets, 4 cups water and the remaining mushroom soup.  I put the browned patties in a 9x13 dish and poured the gravy over and baked for 30 min. at 375 F.  It was delicious!  The boyfriend asked to add it to our normal rotation!

Kids were OK with it, hubs loved it. Next version I will leave out the ketchup and mustard tho.   Gave the gravy a weird color and a meatloaf-ish flavor.  Might try some A1 for a stronger steak like flavor. Will try again.

I followed this recipe to a "Tee" except that I omitted the salt.  The burgers were awesome! --even without the sauce, which as written, was very salty-tasting. Next time, I will use milk/beef stock gravy. So I use this recipe for my burgers all the time, now, and just avoid the sauce.  it is with regret that I give this a 2-1/2 (as half the recipe is usable) and round up (for sympathy).

So delicious!!!  I have never made this before and I had to improvise with some ingredients... I used cream of chicken condensed soup instead of the french onion and used a dry onion soup mix as well.  For the meat I used the chicken soup, half the packet of the soup mix and the rest of the ingredients as stated... I also used plain mustard instead of mustard seasoning for the gravy as I didnt have any.  It was  HUGE hit for my family and I will definitely make it int he future!  I served it over polenta and herb goat cheese! Yum!!

I have made this a lot since I have read the recipe.  It’s really good.  I use Italian bread crumbs, double the soup mix, add some cream of mushroom soup and I always have enough gravy to pour over my mashed potatoes.    My family loves it.  It’s a great Saturday or Sunday night Dinner.

The steaks themselves are good, but the sauce is kind of awful.  I made this again and for the sauce used onion soup mix, water, cream of mushroom and some fresh mushrooms sauteed in EVOO and it was very, very good.  Not healthy, but good comfort food.

This recipe is fantastic.   The instructions are simple to follow and the dish taste great!  For a guy who have difficulty in boiling water this was like a cake walk in the park (easy).  I will prepare this dish again!  This was great!

I read a lot of mixed reviews for this recipe, but decided to take the plunge and try it for myself, and I am glad that I did! These were soooo yummy! I doubled the sauce to have gravy for our mashed potatos, and added mushrooms to the pan while the patties were simmering. They turned out so juicy and moist, the sauce was delicious! Maybe a little bit on the salty side, but hey, it's condensed soup. We had some unexpected dinner guests over and everyone raved about this dish! Thanks for the awesome recipe!

This recipe is very good, and as others have said it tastes even better as leftovers the next day.  You really need to double the sauce, there simply isn't enough to pour over whatever starch you're serving it with.  I think this recipe is good as it is, salisbury steak is traditionally very simple and there's only a few ingredients here, so to me it's perfect as it is.  It makes me wonder why a lot of the other reviewers seem compelled to add ingredients such as powdered gravy mix, which is basically just salt and cornstarch, or mushroom soup, which has no business in salisbury steak.

This was a simple and delicious dish. When served with mashed potatoes, it was the perfect comfort food. I doubled the ingredients for the gravy to make sure we had enough, because my family loves gravy.

This was delish! I was so scared my hubbykins wouldn't like it once I saw all the onions in the French Onion Soup but he loved it anyhow! They shriveled up, LOL. Anyhow I omitted the ketchup as per other reviews and next time I will add one more can of soup for more gravy!(minus the flour though)

I am rating this recipe for the patties only. After reading other reviews i made the gravy using the recipe from a box of Lipton Beef Onion soup mix(i did add the remainder of the can of french onion soup to the gravy) My husband, who does not eat leftovers , ate these patties 2 nights in a row! My grown son also loved these. I don't eat beef but i will definately make them again as they are so easy to prepare.

Really good, but I strongly recommend doubling the sauce ingredients if you want anything to put on rice or potatoes. While delicious, there was next to nothing to use as gravy. I've made it twice now, and the second time (doubling the sauce), was terrific.

I changed this recipe based on what I had on hand @ the house: I used 1 tbsp of french onion soup mix (in 1 lb of ground chuck), 1/2 can of cream of mushroom, + the bread crumbs. Browned for 5 mins on each side. Mixed a mushroom gravy packet + 1 1/2 cans cream mushroom soup + milk and poured it over the browned meat and then baked. Yeah, i know i changed it a lot--but it's a great 'base' recipe that you can change up. AWESOME!

I used 1 pkg of ground turkey 85/15. I DID NOT use the egg,ketchup, water, worcesershire or mustard powder. What I did was made the patties as it is written in step 1 but without the egg. Then I used the remaining of french onion soup mixed with a half jar of brown gravy. To make it thick I made a paste out of 1 tbsp of flour and added a little water to the flour until it was moist and looked like paste. Then I stirred the flour paste in the gravy. Covered and cooked for about 20 minutes. Always add water to flour when you add it to a sauce, if you do not, then your sauce will have "flour balls" little balls of flour. This is a very easy recipe. We love it. I make it once a week at least. Thanks Kelly!!

I made this for dinner tonight. We really liked it. I pretty much made the meat mixture as written,[I didn't measure] but with the gravy. I put the rest of the can of French Onion Soup in the skillet, then I filled the soup can with beef broth, about half the ketchup that it was written for, and the Wor. sauce .Thickened it with flour and a little more beef broth. [smoothy] I thought it was really good. My husband thought it was a little rich. I might play with it alittle more. But I did like it this way. I didn't add any cream of mushroom soup, because I've always made it that way, and I wanted something different.

all i can say is wow! for such and easy recipe it really is a great dish. i used 1 packet of dry onion soup mix with 2 cups of water, i also didnt add the salt but added just a dash more of the Worcestershire  sauce which i think is great for beef. like others said, they did crumble a bit, but i didnt find it as a problem.

This dish was OK. I made a lot of changes based on another reviewer. The taste, to me, was too onion-y. If I were to make it again I would skip the suggestion of adding a dry packet of Onion soup.

I added flour and chopped onion to the meat mixture.  I rolled the patties in flour to keep them from breaking while cooking.  After browning I put them in the oven at 350 for 30 minutes.  Be sure not to put patties on top of each other.

I followed the recipe exactly and would have given it five stars except as written it doesn't make enough of the yummy gravy.  I doubled the gravy and this was just right.  We had just enough extra to spoon some over the steaks and a little for mashed potatos on the side :-)  My kids and hub loved this dish!

Everyone loved this recipe!  I doubled the gravy and served it with rice.  Next time I will try meatballs instead of ovals.  I used crushed stove top chicken stuffing instead of bread crumbs to add a little flavor.  It's a quick and easy keeper.

We LOVE this one! I was surprised at how tasty it is too. Forget about frozen salisbury steak that comes out tasting like a hockey puck....this recipe is easy, relatively quick and low prep, and delicious comfort food. This is a repeat recipe for us and perfect when the weather turns cold here in ohio. I double the sauce (we like it over mashed potatoes also) but other than that, follow the recipe as is.

The sauce was too ketchup-y for us.  Won't make again.

I just used the gravy from this recipe to go with my meatballs. It was very good. I made it the night before I needed it and reheated it the next day in the slow cooker. I was worried when I first made it though because the mustard powder smelled like it was over powering the dish, but when I reheated it the next day it was perfect. I will use this recipe again. I may even try the whole thing next time.

This was a hit!

My oldest son helped with dinner tonight, so we had a blast learning one of the basics together. I added half a diced onion to the meat mixture and a little ketchup/worchestershire. I thought what SLJ6 did was a good idea, only I layered a can of mushrooms I drained on the bottom of a 9x13 baking dish with the other half of onion I'd sliced, then sauteed. I then added the patties and poured the sauce over the top. I baked it at 350* for about a half hour. We all liked this. And for once, there were no leftovers. 

This recipe made six patties. 

If you make the gravy while the patties are cooking and let it sit, the flour that didn't incorporate into the gravy will dissolve.

As an emergency "chief" for an injured family member, her husband, and young children, I had to find recipes that appealed to all - 2 weeks worth.  This filled the bill.  It was so fast, yet yummy, and everone loved this recipe (even the 2 1/2 year old).  Double the sauce/gravy as everyone wanted more.  I served it with baked potatoes, broccoli, and fruit salad.

We (my husband, 15 mo son and I) enjoyed the meal.  I usually save 5 star ratings for when the recipe is just beyond amazing.  Here I followed previous reviewers’ advice: doubled the gravy and decreased the ketchup (2T rather than 1/2 cup of ketchup).  When I make this again, I will decrease the worcestershire sauce from 2T to 1T; my husband wasn’t really happy with the overall aftertaste from the worcestershire sauce.

The meat held together very well and cooks up fast.  I could not find the canned soup so used an evelope of dry onion soup mix instead and it still turned out.  Gravy was great over mashed potatoes.

I never have had Salisbury Steak. I expected a "comfort food" taste. I thought it was great. I gave it 4 stars b/c I would reduce the ketchup. A little bit sweet. You can make patties and leave it in the pan. I did double the sauce. I would make again.

I've made this recipe a dozen times and we really, really like it.  One thing I like to do is make the burgers up ahead of time and refrigerate them so I can save myself a little time at night when I make dinner.  The other thing I like to do is to double the sauce because we love it on mashed potatoes!  Wonderful comfort food.  It's not typical fancy "company fare" but I would absolutely be pleased to serve it to family and friends.

This sounds like a good recipe by the ingredients; however, you have taken away a key ingredient for your gravy. 
The flour should be used to make a roux, then put in the ketchup and so on. I have been cooking and experimenting for 33years; try this.

This is a very good basic recipe to start with. I tweaked it to our taste with the advice of those that went before.  I used 1/2 the catsup, doubled the sauce, and omitted the salt.  I used 1 pkg. dry onion soup mix, reconstituted, and added a 4 oz. can of mushrooms with juice to the sauce.  I made thinner steaks (6 per lb. of beef).  I also used 1 egg per lb. of beef and the patties stayed together nicely.

This is a good base recipe and I followed it exactly this first time.  You know what it's missing?  Mushrooms.  Definitely needs mushroom.  You know what it has too much of?  Ketchup, just like many reviewers mentioned.  So next time I'll make those tweaks, and also increase the amount of sauce.  But, it was still a success exactly as written.  Thanks!

I made this with only 1 lb. and made 4 steaks so I didn’t use the exact measurements but hubby wanted seconds so it was a hit. I only made minor changes using an envelope of onion soup mixed up with about 10 oz. water. I added a small can of mushrooms.  As others suggested I increased the gravy by adding some powdered gravy mix instead of the flour and 1 cup more water. I like sherry so I added some of that. I don’t like too much Worcestershire so I only added 1 tsp. I left out the ketchup entirely because so many reviewers complained about it and I didn’t think I’d care for it either. Like one reviewer said, don’t go crazy trying to make substitutions and changes per the reviews. This is a good recipe to approximate and juggle with what you have and what you like. If you are a fair cook it will always come out great.

very good, will make again. i followed pretty much exactly, except i will share a little secret...to help ground beef stick together, use mayonaise. i know it sounds funny but it does a world better than eggs and it does not add a weird taste. but, the recipe is great the way it is...people that change major aspects then review it aren't really reviewing the real recipe!

I was out of eggs and milk to make mashed potatoes, so I improvised. I crumbled and cooked the ground beef, drained the fat, then added all the ingredients for the sauce, adding in some garlic powder. Then I added one cup of white rice and one cup of water, then simmered for 30 min. The end result was great!

My entire family really enjoyed this recipe.Very simple to make with great results. I thought that the ketchup gave it a strange flavor so I reduced the amount by half. I took the advice of others on the site and added more seasoning to the meat...garlic, 1 TB onion soup mix, and a dash of hickory salt. I also added garlic to the gravy to counter the ketchup taste. All in all a definite keeper! Thank you for the recipe!

Excellent recipe -- easy to prepare and very tasty!  However, I did tweak it a little as other suggested. I used a second can of french onion soup for more gravy and added a beef boullion cube and a tablespoon of cornstarch for thickening.  I omitted the ketchup altogether.  To the ground beef I sprinkled a bit of onion powder, garlic powder, and basil for extra taste. This one's a definite keeper!

I made this for my wife & she loved it. Very easy to make.A couple of nice alternatives, (1) use cream of mushroom soup instead of french onion.Use 1/2 tsp hot mustard instead of regular.

I went with only 3 stars, but that doesn't mean this was a bad recipe. The beef patties were PERFECT; my husband raved about the texture and taste - true salisbury. However, the sauce left a lot to be desired in our opinions. I decided to double the sauce to go with the mashed potatoes & found the extra french onion soup too overwhelming. Also, my hubby is not a mustard fan at all, so its aroma in the sauce really stood out to him. Last, I would skip the ketchup entirely. Guess I'm too used to an oniony, beef gravy with salisbury steak & ketchup was not a pleasant surprise here. Since I was down to the wire when I discovered the final results of the recipe sauce, I simply removed the sauce from the simmered patties, whipped up 2 packs of Knorr brown gravy, added only the smallest amount of the first sauce to that, and served it up. Everyone was happy; even Mr. Picky Kid who, based on school cafeteria salisbury steak, thought that it was going to be awful.
I will definitely use the recipe for the patties again, but will have to tinker with the sauce. Maybe... the rest of the french onion soup, with Knorr beef boullion broth, flour to thicken, and a splash of worchestershire. Sounds tasty already!

A weeknight comfort meal that's easy to pull off in 30 minutes with instant mashed potatoes, canned corn and frozen pillsbury biscuits.  The sauce is definitely the star of the meal.

These were a hit at my house! I served with mashed potatoes and garlic green beans (great and can be found on this website). I did as some others suggested and used a packet onion soup,a can cream of mushroom, and doubled the gravy. Just a tad salty for my taste. Next time I will omit salt and maybe use half an onion packet, and add mushrooms because I forgot this time.

Based on other reviews, we made several changes that worked out great.  We halved the recipe, but for the sauce we used the original amounts.  For the onion soup, we substituted 10.75 oz condensed cream of mushroom soup mixed with 1 oz dry onion soup mix.  We also added some extra water because it was very thick, and 8 oz of canned mushrooms.  We also made the patties half the size called for, to allow everyone to have the serving size they wanted, and to make sure the meat cooked all the way through.  The flavor was terrific, and the sauce made a wonderful gravy for mashed potatoes.  Great for a cold winter day!

AWESOME!  My husband has been raving for two days about this one!  I agree totally!  My kids ate without comment, which is a very good sign that they enjoy something! I didn't have any condensed onion soup, so I substituted cream of mushroom soup mixed with Lipton instant onion soup mix. (Added one third of this mix to the meat mixture, and the remainder went toward the end result of the gravy) I decreased the ketchup, but increased the worcestershire, breadcrumbs, and added more water/flour mixture to the gravy.  I used Gravy Master to darken the gravy as well.  I prepared this in my electric skillet, and it turned out fantastically.  Served over mashed potatoes w/ broccoli on the side.  This is a keeper!

We just had this for dinner and thought it was delicious.  Something to remember when handling ground beef is to not press it alot.  Just form the patties as described and I think you will be pleased as they stay moist, absorb liquid from the sauce and are very tender.  The gravy was tasty and this made a quick fall meal with broasted potatoes, fried cabbage and applesauce.  Thanks!!!

Sorry, but I tried this recipe yesterday 5/14/03 and it was not as good as I thought it would be.  And it also didn't make enough gravy to even put on the patties!  It needs major work to taste respectable.  I was hoping for a very tasty patty that wasn't "like" meatloaf, instead I got bland, old meatloaf found in a diner.  I probably won't make it again.

Absolutely delicious!  It's a hearty meal that warms the tummy.  I use ground chuck.  Try substituting the ketchup with a 10.5 oz. can of Italian stewed tomatoes; it increases the gravy (sauce) for spooning over mashed potatoes.  Also try it with steamed white rice -- Yummy!

This is a very tasty dish and definitely a keeper. I used beef broth instead of the French onion soup as that was what I had on hand.  After I removed the cooked burgers and drained the fat, I heated the sauce in the pan until it started to thicken,  then I added the hamburgers back and simmered, occasionally turning the burgers. Mushrooms would be a nice addition.  Next time.  Thanks Kelly for sharing this delicious recipe.

I am on the meals ministry at church and cook this in large batches.  I send it with extra gravy, mashed potatoes and a bag of frozen green beans.  Have nothing but compliments.  Plus this is my husbands favorite meal and he gets it more now that I cook it for others. I always add canned mushrooms to the gravy.

This recipe was very good.  I took the suggestion of a few other people and made meatballs rather than the patties.  The sauce was delicious, although I thought the ketchup made it a bit too tangy for my tastes.  My husband thought it was wonderful, however.  We made mashed potatoes and the sauce was wonderful over them.

this recipe was WONDERFUL! My family loved it. I followed the directions exactly as stated except I did not have mustard powder so I used a little bit of gulden's spicy brown mustard. It was excellent. I served it with cheesy mashed potatoes and green beans. They thought it was excellent. It was not difficult to prepare and did not take very long. It was a meal that everyone from my 16 month old to DH loved. Thanks so much.

I loved this!!  My husband loved it too.  I added chopped onions to the meat but next time, I will not do that as it was too much onion!  But even with that extra strong flavor, it was great and will be even better when I try it again without the extra onions.  I am not a gravy person but my husband is and he always complains that I never make gravy for him.  This gravy is easy and he loved it!  Thanks!

While I was making this I kept tasting it and thought that I was never going to like it.  There'e just something about the ketchup that I didn't like.  After covering it and letting it cook for 20 minutes I lifted the lid and not only was the smell amazing - it tasted great!  I chopped some onions and garlic and added it to the beef before making the patties.  I also added a little beef stock to the sauce so that I would have more.  I would make it the exact same way again!  And it was a big winer with my husband.

After trying one night for dinner, we made this as the beef dish for a party of 70. Using 25 lbs of beef and increasing the recipe proportionately (omitting added salt).  Added mushrooms.  We made the patties, cooled them overnight and brought out to room temperature.  Grilled at 550 on each side just to place char marks.  Cooled on metal sheets, placed into heat sealed vacuum bags single level.  Froze until morning of party...seven days later.  

Using sous vide, finished at 137 for three and a half hours.  Meanwhile, made sauce adding mushrooms.  After simmering,  layered sauce and Salisbury steaks into a large chaffing dish with 25% heat so they would just stay warm.  

Out of 130, there was almost none left.  With other foods, this entree was listed as top next to my wife's mashed potatoes.  Will we make this again?  Oh yea...maybe substituting half the ground beef with venison.

I didn't have condensed onion soup so I had to use a can of Progresso french onion and I was worried because it smelled very onion-y. But I couldn't have been more wrong. Once I added the other sauce to the skillet it smelled wonderful! My whole family loved it! This was my first time making this or any Salisbury steak recipe and I'm glad I chose this one. I also had some of my patties fall apart during cooking but that did not take away from the flavor. Thank you for the great recipe!

This recipe is delicious, but it isn't what you would really expect from salisbury steak.  For one thing, if you want enough gravy left over for mashed potatoes, double the gravy.  I didn't because I was serving with baked potatoes and the amount of gravy was just right for the steaks themselves.  For another thing, this recipe is a little on the sweet side because of the ketchup.  I thought it tasted good, but it's not really traditional and may not be your cup of tea.

Absolutely disgusting. I am very reluctant to leave a negative review and find no pleasure in it at all but I believe everyone needs to know how awful this recipe is. Apparently, the ratings are all based on the cooks personal alterations, which I believe is an extremely misleading way to rate a recipe. I cooked this in a huge hurry not reading the reviews like I usually do, thinking "great, this looks like a fantastic recipe, lots of stars I think I'll try it" But no, I feel terrible for feeding this to my family. KETCHUP?!?!!! I should have trusted that I am no longer a novice cook and I know better than to put ketchup into a salisbury steak. I am very upset with myself for trying this recipe, I wasted a perfectly good pound and a half of meat that I could have put to much better use. Dog food, perhaps.

Add pkt of onion soup mix to hamburger.  Use lg (18oz) progresso french onion soup.  Triple the gravy (not Kechup) and add a can of mushrooms.

I had a severe attack of gout and have had to adapt a number of great recipes from AR. If you are prone to gout, broths and soups made with beef or chicken broth are one of the worst things you can eat. I was so hungry for this Salisbury Steak that I had to find something to sub for the canned onion soup. So I caramelized two very large yellow onions, which made a little over a cup, then I put them in a small saucepan with about a cup and a half of vegetable broth and gently warmed that and let it cool. I then followed the recipe as written, except using my homemade onion soup concentrate in place of the canned. It turned out fabulous and tasted exactly the same: Delicious.

I made this recipe for my family and it was great.  The sauce was the best, different spin on Salisbury steak than one with plain brown gravy.  It seems odd that there are ratings on here from some dipshits who used their own recipe...:>/

My husband is a very picky when it comes to food and he always loved the frozen Salisbury steak which I refuse to buy or eat! I have made this recipe several times and each time he told me how good it was. The meat is very moist from the French onion soup and it has a lot of flavor. The last time I made it I didn't have worcestershire sauce and it still turned out great! I served it with egg (buttered) noodles & broccoli ( gotta have your greens) it was absolutely delicious and very easy to make. I will not use another recipe!

I made this and everyone loved it. I did double the sauce.  However, the canned onion soup is very salty.  I am a salt lover and noticed how salty it was.  It was really delicious and easy but try to get no salt soup.  We had it with potatoes au gratin and the gravey mixed in with that was heavenly.  Definitely will make again.

I did not care for this recipe. I used Campbell's French Onion soup and I think it just made the Salisbury steak taste bitter. Also after everything was prepared there was only a small amount of sauce left to top the steaks off and I feel like it was too thick.

I have an 8 year son that likes to help me cook and we were looking for something to make with the ground sirloin we just bought and this sounded and looked good. The recipe was easy to follow and the recipe was easy to follow. Since our family loves French onion soup, using that was a great idea. The smell of the patties with the onion soup filled the entire house. We completed the recipe as instructed except that we finished the cooking process over low heat for a longer time (about 1 hour) as we had to run somewhere. Not sure how the higher temperature recipe turns out, but the low temperature version we did was really juicy. The finished dish was absolutely delicious and liked by all. We will definitely be making this dish again soon.

I love this recipe. The taste factor is just right. I followed the instructions as followed, except I omitted the gravy recipe for a packet of brown gravy and 2/3's of the french onion soup. After browning I put the meat in a casserole dish and poured the gravy on top, covered with foil, then baked at 350 for 25 minutes.

This recipe is really good, but I do make changes to mine though.  Instead of using condensed french onion soup, I use condensed golden mushroom, and add extra mushrooms. I also add chopped onion, green peppers, and a clove of minced garlic to my meat patties. Served with mashed potatoes and corn on the cob this is a complete comfort food dinner that my family loves!

Just made this last night and my family loved it. I did add a can of mushroom soup as others recommended and it did make more sauce which we all liked. I also saute' fresh mushrooms in with onions since we all love them. Great recipe that I will definitely use again.

Perfect as written but the second and third time I made it I added fresh garlic and 8 ounces of fresh sliced mushrooms with onions, added chopped fresh parsley in meat mixture, added more seasoning such as oregano just for more flavor.  Tripled the recipe for meat mixture as I always do for my big eatin family.  Quadrupled the gravy and probably added more sherry (the real stuff) as it MAKES THE DISH! Do NOT skip the SHERRY, it's a MUST. Also, I never use flour to thicken gravy, I used cornstarch in place of flour (1 TBS.Cornstarch to 2 TBS.Flour Better flavor and no lumps. Even though I quadrupled the gravy, I only used approx. 4 TBS. Of cornstarch sprinkled over onion/mushroom/garlic mixture. Served with mashed potatoes (A MUST) and fresh spinach.  My family from ages 9 to 55 LOVE this recipe.  THANK YOU SO MUCH for such a simple, comforting, recipe. Last time I made this dish, I added a can of Golden Mushroom soup to replace some of the beef broth (as I hate to do!!!) but I have to admit it tasted really good as well.  Everything else the same. ENJOY~!

Made it for dinner today, as is, and it turned out great! To avoid the patties from braking, I refrigerated them an hour (or less). I will be making this recipe again! Thank you!!!

The first time I made the recipe as written.  We liked it but were not really crazy about the gravy.  I made a few changes and we loved it.  For the gravy I followed others suggestions and used Lipton Onion Soup mix and followed the directions for gravy on the package and added 3/4 can of cream of mushroom soup, cooked onions and mushrooms.  The other 1/4 can of soup was added to the meat mixture.  I did not use the french onion soup.  I will definitely make this again.

This was a surprisingly great meal.  I, as most of the other reviewers did, tweaked the sauce recipe.  I used cream of mushroom soup, lipton onion soup mix, milk, ketchup, worcestershire sauce and powdered mustard.  It was the perfect dinner on a cold January night!

I loved this, and it was a huge hit with the family! I did add a can of cream of mushroom soup to the gravy and im glad i did because i think the ketchup would have otherwise been overwhelming.  i cooked the steaks in a cast iron skillet and baked in the oven for 30 minutes after adding the gravy. Comfot food, yum!

I've made this twice, once as written & then with improvements. As written, the sauce was not good. Way too tangy & thin. The patties completly fell apart when trying to cook in fry pan. I read all the reviews and improved by: adding 1/2 pack of onion soup mix to ground beef mix, along with worchestire sauce & garlic powder. The just browning the patties in a fry on over high heat & transferring to casserole pan. Make sure to use lean cut of meat, or you'll have a greasy mess. I used same fry pan to make gravy, scrapping leftovers to infuse flavor. Adding about 1/2 cup beef broth, remaining onion soup mix, mustard, ketchup, and a touch of brown sugar. I didn't like the color, so I added a bit of jarred brown gravy to it, this gave that traditional color. While mking the gravy, I sauteed mushrooms and added those to the gravy. Poured over patties and baked 375 45 mins.

Great comfort food. I used more of the grease, added some heavy cream to it and some more water. I think I'll throw some mushrooms in the gravy next time, too. I love this recipe!!

I followed the meat portion of this recipe & added a tablespoon of worcestshire to it, and it came out great, I tweaked my own version of the gravy & everyone loved it! With the garlic mashed potatoes & steamed brocolli & Red Lobster Biscuits, I felt like I was having a resturant quality type meal! Was very good, and melted in my mouth! Will definetly use this recipe again! For the gravy I used a can of cream of mushroom,dry french onion soup mix,can of beef broth,a couple of dashes of mustard powder,2 squirts of ketchup & a splash of sage powder.Poured over steaks in oven after frying & baked @ 375 for 30 mins.Delish!

I will not rate recipes that I have changed in any way. I made this one exactly as it is written (I did double the sauce, as recommended). I could not believe the reviews... just looking at the recipe. It seemed waaaaay to simple. It was amazing! My husband raved about it and my daughter was just happy there was some left over for her to take to work for lunch tomorrow. Talk about not judging a book by it's cover... goes well for this recipe too. I am adding this to my menu for sure.

One of my family's favorites. I made it exactly per the recipe. I am thinking about including some green onion and diced jalapeños next time. I will also replace the mustard with fajita seasoning.

Outstanding.  I made changes similar to other reviewers: Omit the salt, ketchup, and mustard; use corn starch instead of flour as needed; to the meat mixture add the Worcestershire sauce and a finely chopped, sauteed onion (medium); for the gravy, add the remaining onion soup, a can of cream of mushroom soup, and a half-packet of dry onion soup mix, and heat it all through on the stove top.  After browning the patties, place them in a foil-lined dish and pour the gravy over them, and bake covered in the oven for 45 minutes at 375.  Make at least double the gravy.  My family raved.

Tried this recipe a few months ago because I was looking for something quick that everyone would like. It is now a favorite in my house and a great simple weeknight meal. I did double the sauce so that there would be enough to put on potatoes. The sauce as the recipe calls for only barely makes enough for the meat.

a lot of people complain about the gravy....I wasn't impressed with it either. so I prepared the steaks as directed afterwards I kept the oil in which the steaks were cooked in and added the rest of the French onion soup and a bottled/canned gravy (mushroom or beef). this was an awesome substitute and took less time. of course taste gravy to your liking

I loved this recipe. My husband loved it even more. I did, however make it with ALLY99's modifications, plus a small splash of white cooking wine. It was, according to hubby, "the best thing I've made in a long time". Hmm. That does not bode well for the rest of what I fix, I suppose. But anyway, this was really good, and I'm serving it for my brother and Mom who I invited to dinner tomorrow night. Have to have smashed potatoes with it--corn, salad, rolls and apple crisp for dessert. Okay, hey, so it's carb-heavy. Live a little.

This was amazing!!!!!!  The kids and my husband loved it!!  Ground beef always has a bland taste no matter how I season it.  Not this steak.  It was moist and packed full of flavor.  I am definitley adding this recipe to our weekly dinner rotation.  The only thing I added like others said was a can of cream of mushroom soup and filled the can up with water.  It definitley made plenty of gravy to poor over the meat and mashed potatoes....

I made this and made a few of the suggested changes: added sauteed onions and mushrooms to the gravy; browned on the stove and then baked for the rest of the time; doubled the gravy except the ketchup and added cream of mushroom soup (around one can). I used the Lipton Beef Onion soup instead of French onion (only because it's all I had at the time). 

They were delicious and were great as leftovers too. I'll be using this (modified) recipe as my go-to for salisbury steaks going forward. Who knew they were this easy?

Family liked this.  Made as written and served over mashed potatoes.  Gravy is good, but I thought there were just too many mushy onions in the French Onion soup.  I will make this again, but I will use fresh onions and substitute brown gravy or beef stock instead of the canned soup.

This is a great salisbury steak recipe that really only requires one dish for cooking.  The gravy is fabulous so I always make mashed potatoes with it.  I don't change the recipe at all.  The kids like it too!

I wanted to use 2 lbs. of ground beef and stretch this a bit, so I added an extra egg, an envelope of Lipton onion soup mix, and a few extra tablespoons of bread crumbs to the meat mixture. The steaks were wonderful -- tender and flavorful. The sauce nearly ruined this for me; the ketchup and worcestershire were just out of place with salisbury steak, way too tangy. I had to add 2 jars of Heinz brown gravy and a can of cream of mushroom soup to tone the sauce down enough to eat it. Next time I'll leave out the ketchup, worcestershire and possibly the mustard, and stick with a standard mushroom-onion gravy. Oh -- and to whoever suggested baking this covered in the oven rather than finishing it on the stovetop, thanks! Much easier to finish it in the oven so you can work on the rest of the meal while it's cooking. Wonderful recipe for the actual beef patties, but if you're looking for the taste of traditional salisbury steak, I suggest using a more traditional gravy recipe.

I made this recipe the other night for dinner and it was AWESOME!!!!  I did make a couple of changes - most ready-made condensed onion soups have ingredients that we do not eat so I found a recipe online to make my own!  It was fantastic.  Also I did not use the ketchup (personal preference) and I used homemade bread crumbs. This will definitely be a staple in my kitchen.

It is a great recipe! Especially for first timers like me :) I rated it 4 stars b/c i read a lot of the reviews & made quite a few changes based off that. I didn't feel i could give it 5 stars since i didn't do the original recipe first. I added 1/3 of Lipton Onion Soup mix to the hamburger meat , along with a squirt of Dijon mustard, and a tbsp of all purpose flour w/ the other required ingredients. I also cooked the meat in a little olive oil about half way done. With the gravy, i went with a couple different reviews and decided to do my own thing. I used 2 brown gravy pkgs and started adding ingredients as i went. I did the recommended amount of water on pkg. I added a can of cream of mushroom soup, the rest of the Lipton Onion Soup mixture, sliced mushrooms, sliced onions, and a squirt of Dijon mustard. I only put about half the recommended about of ketchup; no flour and and salt and peppered to my liking. Poured it on top the meat after pouring out the grease. And let it simmer for about 20 mins, stirring often. My husband loved it!!! I thought it was great!! For a first time and kind of doing my own thing, it turned out great. But if you don't like a really onion taste, then leave out the sliced onions. I will definitely be doing this again. Thanks for the recipe and suggestions!!

This was delicious. I did take the advise of others and add Cream of Mushroom Soup and a packet of Liptons Onion Soup to the gravy. I used the stovetop method and loved it!

I really liked this recipe. I paid attention to the other reviews and added my own twist to it.  I think this dish has a lot of potential, and I'm sure I'll will be make it again. Before attempting this again, I'll have to figure out what seasonings to use, by reading all of the review, and see that will work for others, and than for me, to make it more flavorful or lot better for me to do! Anyway, excellent to do a SCRATCH on recipes. The more I play with my food, the more I love cooking, to make a recipe that will work for me, that is!! Than I can do the happy food dance!! I've will added this to my recipe book with my additions. THANK YOU!! It was a 3.5 Stars NOW IT is A 5 to 7 Stars to me. I agree with some of the other reviews. You could modify this recipe.

I'm suprized at the high rating of this dish. I thought it was alright but I won't make it again. The steak part wasn't bad, but the gravy was terrible. I would sugguest making a seperate brown gravy from the recipe and it will probably turn out better. I would rather spend the $3 for the encore meal..

this is one of the few things I can actually say that both my husband and I loved and will definitely make again, Even though I didn't follow the recipe exactly I still got what I needed from other reviews so might as well still rate this 5 stars!  I added minced garlic to the meat mixture.   I didnt use the worcestershire sauce or ketchup for the sauce, instead I used the  added cream of mushroom and packet of brown gravy mix and half a cup of water to the remaining french onion soup.  After browning the patties in the skillet I put them in a glass baking dish, covered with the sauce and baked them in the oven at 375 for 30 minutes.  Delicious!!

We enjoyed this. I didn't have the french onion soup so I had to use a dry packet of onion soup and it worked fine. I added a can of cream of mushroom and some garlic. It's a keeper.

YUMMY! A few changes... I did not add the soup in the meat mixture because I did not want the meat to fall apart. I also added a tablespoon of garlic powder to the meat mixture. I added fresh mushrooms to the skillet along with the soup mixture, by the time 20 minutes was up, they were nice and soft.

I was looking for the Salisbury Steak flavour that I remembered growing up and this is it.  The flavour profile of the sauce is perfect, the only thing that I'll change in the future is to make twice as much!

I've made this twice, the first time just as the recipe is written and it was delicious. This time, insteed of burger I used cube steaks that  Wanted to use up. The gravy is wonderful and is great over egg noodles. Serve with a salad for a very easy weeknight meal.

I had a hard time with these for some reason.  I didnt have a pan big enough to fit all 6 patties, so i split it up.. I ended up burning the bottoms of the fist batch of patties. I dont think i had enough sauce in the fist batch, so i maxed another can of French Onion soup and other ingredients and the 2nd batch was much better.. *Make sure you have enough sauce in the pan with the patties to avoid burning, the 2nd batch ended up being pretty good :) the extra sauce was used to pour on top of the meat and potatoes. Also, remember that the patties shrink up a lot when you cook them.  Make them bigger is you dont want them to shrink up into little minis.

I've made this for my family numerous times and every time it got rave reviews! I followed the original recipe the first time, but then took a shortcut and used onion soup mix the rest of the times. Both were fabulous. Highly recommend for a meat and potatoes family!

Good, solid comfort food.  Reminded me of my Grandma's recipe.  She never used ketchup so I didn't either, however I did double the seasonings and used 2 cans of soup (and no added salt).  Will make again, changing it to more meet our taste.  For beginning cooks, a great recipe to start learning with.  Very forgiving and directions very easy to follow.

The meat of the steak was ok, but needed to add more seasoning though. The only disappointment in making this is the sauce. The taste of the ketchup is overpowering, maybe next time I will replace the ketchup with brown gravy mix. Thanks for the recipe Kelly.

We cut down the ketchup and used Campbells Beefy Mushroom soup instead to make the sauce a little thicker and not so "ketchup-y".  Its good ol' fashioned comfort food at its best!

Okay so I took the advice of the very first reviewer, she hit the nail on the head. I used turkey instead of beef. You couldn't even tell. I also browned on the stove and then put the gravy on top and stuck them in a 400 degree oven for 20 minutes. My honey couldn't stop eating it. I will be making this again.YUMMY

This was very easy and good tasting recipe.  As for adding in the cream of mushroom soup and the onion soup dry mix to the gravy that everyone else recommended, I did that but it seemed to salty.  Next time I will try it without the onion soup dry mix in the gravy and just saute' some onions. That should take care of the problem.

This was fantastic! When I went to the grocery store to pick up the ingredients they were sold out of the french onion soup, so instead I used golden mushroom soup (creamy texture) and a pack of dried onion soup mix and I added a little more water to thin out the gravy since is was very thick. It was a total hit! Plates were licked clean! I will definitely use this recipe again.

Very tasty recipe. I too, altered the sauce. I took the advise of others and used a cream of mushroom can of soup for the gravy. I cut the ketchup back to about a tablespoon. For some reason I was out of flour ( made pancakes from scratch earlier today) and by adding the cream of mushroom soup helped with thickness. I will be making this again!

Made this for dinner tonight, my family liked it.  I was tempted to add Lipton onion soup mix because,  I basically always use it whenever I am cooking ground beef;  but I  followed the recipe as stated and it was good.  The next time I will add the soup mix.

I have made this twice now. I followed the recipe exactly as is except both times I accidently used a whole can of French Onion soup in the pattie mixture (instead of the 1/3 cup). It made them fall apart a lot when in the skillet but it was good. I then used a whole second can for the sauce. My kids and I love it!

This turned out pretty well, but I would suggest using lean beef and getting rid of the extra fat content because mine turned out very greasy. I would use a bit less of the bread crumbs to get a meatier and less mushed result.

We loved this!  I scaled it down to 4 servings.  It's just my hubs and I and we'll eat the other 2 servings for lunch tomorrow.  The only other change I made was to substitute corn starch for the flour and to use gluten free bread for my bread crumbs.  I loved the tangy burst of flavor the sauce provides.  Yum!

This is DELICIOUS!!! I tweeked the recipe though.  I did not use ketchup, but instead brown gravy.  I did not add salt. I added an onion mix soup packet in addition to the other ingredients.  After I browned my meat in the skillet I put it in the oven and added gravy on top. I baked at 400 degrees for 30 minutes. Next time I will make more gravy and more rice.

Very tasty.  I don't usually make recipes that use soup mixes because it really ups the sodium content, but this was sooo tasty both the meat and the sauce  Next time I 'll make a bigger batch and freeze it.

Made this for dinner last night for the first time.  It was VERY good.  But, I believe the recipe is off with respect to how much gravy should be made with the beef.  I made 2 lb's of beef, and used double the gravy ingredients and still thought it could have used more.  Also, the recipe says to stir.  I tried that and the patties fell apart, so just don't cook on too high of heat, then when you are getting the gravy out, scrape the bottom of the pan.  It's really good.

I loved this recipe. My rating is based on it as is. But here are my changes after: Did not like the sauce/gravy, so I did as others suggested and used the packet of dry french onion soup mix. On my second time making it I also added5 cloves of garlic to the meat mixture. My 6 year old son loved it too!! Quick and easy.

This was good enough I'll make it again. Maybe next time I'll add mushrooms to the sauce. The gravy was a bit scarce for the amount of meat.

This was excellent!!  Made it with ground turkey so that it was less Weight Watchers points.  I added a whole teaspoon of ground mustard instead of half but it was still great!

Quick and Easy.  I made a few changes, some by accident, some on purpose.  The accident was that I just went down the list and started adding, so the ingredients at the end that were for the gravy, went into the meat mixture.  Oops, my bad.  So I added more ketchup and wor. to the gravy.  I think I also added onion and garlic powder to the meat, but I did not add any soup.  (but remember I added ketchup and wor. sauce?  so that gave me the moisture I needed)  I used c.of mushroom soup instead, and I added french fried onions to the soup mix.   It was very quick and easy and had a good flavor.  Thanks for sharing.

I cannot get over how good this recipe was for dinner tonight!  I took the suggestion of others and added a can of cream of mushroom and doubled the gravy ingredients.  I also threw in a can of sliced onions.  I browned the patties in a skillet w/ onion slices and then put them in a 9x13 covered w/ the gravy and let them bake covered for 35 minutes.  Delish!

I added fresh mushrooms to the gravy.  I couldn't find cream of french onion so I just used the regular soup version.  The meat had a really good flavor, but I think cream of mushroom soup would make a better gravy than what I ended up with.  Also, I will probably use more bread crumbs next time.

The patties themselves were delicious when made just as written.  I bought ground beef that was 80/20.  MMMMMMM!!!  As suggested, I doubled the sauce, but wish I would have added less ketsup.

I feel weird saying I really liked this recipe, cause I used all the changes commentor Ally99 suggested which is a bit different then the original recipe.  So based on Ally99 changes I give this recipe a 5 star (although I will use less ketchup next time).  Family really liked it and I plan on making it again.

This was a very good salisbury steak. I made this per the recipe and was pleased with the results. A very good flavor overall. My only complaint was that the gravy seemed to thicken up too much, leaving very little to cover the steaks with when serving - and this was after I set aside some of the meat for later. Next time, I'll double the ingredients for the gravy and hopefully even have enough to spoon on some homemade mashed potatoes.

I made this with my boyfriend for my parents and it was a HUGE success!!!  we needed to make extra so I used 2 lbs of ground beef; and doubled everything except the ketchup due to other reviews. I think it turned out perfect and will definitely make it for guests in the future!! 

I also sautéed mushrooms and let them simmer in the sauce over the patties for about the last 5 minutes of cooking. It was DELICIOUS!

This is sooo yummy!  But I had to alter the recipe a little.  I didn't have the condensed soup so used the Lipton Onion Soup Mix instead.  I added a cup of water with the soup mix.  When I started cooking steaks in the sauce, I realized the sauce was too thick.  I also figured out that the sauce will be completely gone if I cook the meat for 20 min.  So, I added another envelope of the soup mix combined with a cup of water.  Then I added 1/4 cup water, 1/2 tsp dry mustard, 1.5 Tbsp kechup.  I omitted salt completely.  The consistancy and amount of the gravy was just perfect.

This recipe is amazing. I followed the advice of other users before making this dish. I used all of the measurements from the original recipe except I added half an onion sauteed, 1/2 tsp of gravy master, one package of onion soup mix and one can cream of mushroom. I was able to make 8 good size patties instead of 6. This is one of the best recipes I've found in a long time. I will be making this more often.!!!!!

Very good.  I mixed the meat just like the recipe here calls for, and pan fried them on both sides til good and brown.  But for the gravy part I used the recipe on the side of the lipton onion soup mix box, poured it over top of the oval patties, baked at 375 for about 30 minutes.  Served with mashed potatoes, green beans, and corn....wonderful!!!  The meat was so tender, but yet not falling apart, and the gravy was excellent.  Hint....I used part of the condensed soup from the can as part of the water needed for the lipton onion soup gravy.  It's a keeper, as a matter of fact I am fixing it for the second time in as many weeks.  My family loved them.

First time trying Salisbury steak and both my boyfriend and I really liked it! It's similar to meatloaf but saucier. I decided to mix 1/3 cup of the soup, bread crumbs, egg, S&P prior to mixing in the ground beef since overhandling meat tends to lead to toughness. I added about 2 pinches of salt, but I think I will omit all together next time since I thought the final product was a tad too salty. I also added 1/4 of diced onion sauteed prior to browning the patties. I noticed that it was a little too tangy for me so I added 1 tbsp of brown sugar. I served with leftover scalloped potatoes and corn. Will make again!

I had really high hopes for this, but I was kind of disappoionted.  My husband liked it, I thought it was ok, one child ate it, the other two hated it...like it made them gag.  So, I probably won't make it again.

Well, I guess we are just not salisbury steak fans around this house.  But that is by no fault of the recipe.  The recipe went very smoothly, was easily prepared and looked so good when I was done.  I did add some mushrooms into the sauce because my husband loves mushrooms.  I think the onion was a bit overpowering.  We are not; however, huge onion fans.

We absolutely loved this.  I can see it going into regular rotation at our house.  Next time, I will definitely double the sauce.  I found myself scraping the cooled frying pan with my finger as I was packaging up the leftovers.  :)

My kids loved this and my husband and I did too.   I doubled the gravy by adding an extra can of french onion soup and doubling all gravy ingredients except the ketchup, I kept that at 1/4c per others reviews.   All of my kids ate 2 helpings!  YAY for this recipe, it's awesome and will be put in to our rotation of dinners.

Awesome! I make alot of recipes once but this is something we come back too time and time again. The only thing I changed is instead of the dry bread crumbs, I used 2 slices of whole wheat bread chopped in my Kitchenaid chopper.

This recipe was perfect!  I definitely doubled the "gravy" because I love putting it on everything else!  But I add mushrooms about 5 minutes before serving To give it a little more texture and flavor... oh, and I happen to LOVE mushrooms! =)  Thanks for the great recipe!

I followed previous reviewers' recommendations by: 1) putting the patties in a casserole dish after browning/draining, 2) doubling the gravy and 3) baking in the oven for 45 min covered at 375.  Delicious!!!!

The patties were great!  I browned them, then put them in a casserole dish coated with gravy, covered the dish & baked at 350 for about 30 minutes.  For the gravy, I used Lipton Mushroom Onion soup mix, which was super easy and tasted delicious with the salisbury steak!

This was delicious.  I basically did what another reviewer (CAJUNWIFE123) did, and it turned out great.  I added a can of Golden mushroom soup, a little brown gravy powder, a little more of the water, worstershire sauce (I did a full two lbs of ground beef), etc.  Browned the patties, then put them in a greased 9x13, covered with the gravy, then covered with foil, and baked at 400 for 35 minutes. It was great, and the hubby raved!  I even got my 2 and 4 year olds to take a few bites, and that's saying something.  I did the extra gravy for two reasons...I was doing more beef, and I like gravy on my mashed potatoes.  It made a lot that way, but it was great!  Great recipe, thanks so much!  This was my first time making salisbury steak, and I'd say it was a success.

I made this recipe to the letter and feel my review is fair. In my opinion the sauce was just a touch too sweet, although it was very good.  I served it with a side of steak fries and the sauce was good with them.  In the future I believe I will reduce the ketchup by a tablespoon and replace it with cider vinegar and see if that brings a little more balance to the sauce.  Definintely worth trying, as is!

This was wonderful!  The things I did different are,  I used two pounds of ground beef, two cans of French onion soup ½ in meat the rest in gravy, I put ¾ bag of Lipton French onion soup in meat and the rest with one more bag in the gravy, 3 T flour and will use 4 next time, and beef stock (about 25 oz).  We like lots of gravy in our house.  I put the meat on the grill and cooked 75% to get the flavor from the grill.  I them put them in the gravy to let them simmer.  Do not put in any salt it will get plenty from the other ingredients.  I used more bread crumbs not sure how much but keep adding until it doesn't stick to clean dry hands.  Other than that I followed the recipe.

good base recipe, but needed lots of tweaking. I followed other reviewers suggestions and used lipton onion soup mix with water, omited ketchup and used brown gravy instead, added cream of mushroom soup, a large can of mushrooms. I cooked my steaks on the stove and didn't have any problems with them falling apart. After these changes, I loved the result!

I've prepared a very similar recipe for years...you can't beat the convenience of ingredients, the quick put together and the absolutely scrumptious taste!  I've used condensied mushroom soup[, regular and golden for a change of pace.  This is always a favorite when my grandkids visit...everybody loves it!

I liked this recipe but I did make some modifications. I used a carmelized french onion soup instead of condensed so I wouldn't need the water. I omitted the ketchup and added fresh mushrooms to balance out flavor. It turned out great but I want to tweak it some more to get the flavor that I want

This is a good comfort food dish. I followed the recipe,except I doubled the gravy using the french onion soup and one pack of dry onion soup mix. It turned out great. I served this with mashed potatoes, corn on the cob and biscuits, I will make this again.

Classic comfort food! I made the patties on the stove, poured the sauce on top, and finished them off in the oven for about a half hour until they were cooked through. Taste great!!

I only gave this recipe 4 stars because the steaks are GREAT but the sauce was horrible. As soon as I started cooking the sauce with the patties, they started smelling like fast-food burgers instead of Salisbury steak, so I quickly rescued the steaks and made the sauce with ONLY french onion soup and flour. I'm glad I did! I should learn not to trust recipes with ketchup, because I don't like it, and the flavor/smell of the ketchup was overbearing. There was still a small hint of it even with the little bit that remained on the steaks after I rescued them from this potential disaster. My husband, who doesn't care for Salisbury steak, said "I didn't know Salisbury steak could taste so good!" and he kept sneaking bites of the leftovers! This recipe is a keeper, with the change that I made. It really hits the spot.

I made this for dinner last night.  I made it according to the recipe.  The only difference was that I used panko bread crumbs because that was what I had on hand.  My picky daughter loved it.  The sauce is different than what I think of when I think of salisbury steak.  But I liked the tang of it, as did my family.  Next time I will make more sauce and add sauteed mushrooms, onions and bell pepper.

This was quite delish, and I will definitely make it again. Hubby and 3-year-old also ate it with gusto. The only issue we grownups had with it is that, when made exactly per the recipe, it has a little too strong a ketchup taste. Next time I'll try something else instead, perhaps some A1.

My hubby loved this dish!! Winner Winner yummy dinner:) I did slice 2 onions and 2 pkgs of fresh mushrooms, sauteed these up. I added 2 tomato paste after they were soft and added beef bouillon. I made a slurry of corn starch and water, I used this to thicken the sauce. I mixed Lipton onion soup, Worcestershire sauce and cracker crumbs to the ground beef and brown off the patties. Everyone jumped into the mushroom hot tub and simmered for 15 mins. Really easy and oh soo good! I served them over mashed tators. Thank You Kelly!! I will use this recipe again and again now that I know how quick it was.

Very good.  I doubled the gravy mixture but only used 1/4 cup ketchup.  Next time I think I will use even less ketchup.  I could taste the ketchup and it almost ruined the gravy.  I also think I will try beef broth in place of the water.  Also, use a low fat (90% lean or better) hamburg.

The ketchup and Worchester flavor was extremely too strong.   I ended up using some jarred gravy and it was much better. This is just an ok recipe.

This was very good. I made a few changes. I used garlic salt instead of regular. I also doubled the water and added a can of cream of mushroom so that we would have enough gravy for the mashed potatoes I made to go with it. This was very good will be making this again.

I made this for Christmas dinner and found it to be another wonderful recipe that I can add to my recipe box.  After browning the patties, I put them in a crockpot and doubled the soup mixture and served it with Make-Ahead Mashed Potatoes.  My dinner could not have been much more simpler leaving me more time to spend with my family.

Another great recipe found on this site. My hubby said this was the best Salisbury steak he's ever had. The only thing I did different was I sauteed chopped onions and garlic and mixed in with meat patties. I also sauteed baby portobella mushrooms and added it to the sauce. My two picky kids asked for seconds. Thanks for the recipe  :)

I am making this right now and I can already say OMG!! I tried a bite of the meat after browning it and it was amazing. I am also doubling the sauce for the extra. I didn't use the 1/4 ketchup, I broke that in half and diced up a full package of fresh mushrooms and added a can of cream of mushroom soup. "Our family LOVES mushrooms!" My grandma used to make homemade Salisbury Steaks and they were really good, but she doesn't cook anymore and really can't remember how she made them. I, however, am used to the freezer section "Banquet" steaks and I know this will win over my families tummies hands down!! This WILL become a regular meal for us.

I browned them first and then baked them with the gravy and had tons of grease in my pan.  Also made my own gravy.  I made the one in the recipe first and hated the ketchup taste in it.  Wont be making this again.  My boyfriend thought it was ok.

Simple to make and EASY to eat! Great flavor, moist meat, and if you can make more gravy, perfect to pair with mashed potatoes or rice. Will definitely make again!

I made this for my picky family and once they took one look at it they wouldn't even try it! I ate it that night and it was ok but then I brought it to work about 2 days later to have for lunch and I loved it. I thought it was better a couple of days later. I changed this up, I didn't use onion soup mix b/c the kids don't like onions so I used a package of brown gravy mix and I mixed it w/1 cup of water and a can of mushroom soup until thick. I used 93% hamburg and I used Pam to fry the steak then I poured over the gravy and put it all in the oven for about 20 minutes until the gravy was hot. Served on mashed potatoes. Oh course the family wanted to eat the mashed potatoes.

I thought that this was delicious!!  I will make again.  I made exactly as directed, except that I cooked it on the lowest of low for an extra half hour while my other dishes were cooking.  It was so soft, it was practically falling off.  But, so delicious!!  I really enjoyed the flavor.

Really good gravy. I didn't have canned soup so I used a package of Lipton's onion soup mixed with 2 cups of water. I always have in on hand and it was just great. It's a keeper

My whole family loved it! This is what I call comfort food. I did not have any problems at all with my patties crumbling or falling apart.  I made sure they got a good sear before I flipped them over and they stayed together just fine.  I used ground sirloin and these were still very moist and tender.  Followed recipe with the exceptions for doubling the gravy and adding a can of cream of mushroom soup to the gravy, put patties and gravy in a covered baking dish with gravy at 350 for 1 hour.  Came out very very moist and tender. Will definitely be making this again.

Made it exactly as written and to my surprise, It was Great! I did not double the sauce but will the next time. That's why it only gets 4 instead of 5. Cause as written it's not enough sauce. Oh and it was a bit oily....

The patties were very flavorful with many alterations including onions, rosemary, savory and parsley. Also, I didn't care for the ketchup in the gravy. My boyfriend loved it.

I really enjoyed this dish, and my husband loved it!  I didn't have any trouble with my patties falling apart.  I let mine cook a little longer instead of just browning.  I think that helps alot.

I have to say even those these dig fall apart alittle, they were great.  My kids loved them.  They are so moist and tender as well, a far cry from a burger.   To keep falling aprat to a min.  I don't turn them a whole lot, the less I mess with them the better.  I thought this was a cost effective receipe as well.  Thanks

Never had homemade salisbury steaks before, and this was an excellent recipe. I sauteed finely minced onions and added them to the meat, and doubled the gravy. Even the picky eaters and naysayers devoured this one. Thanks!

The sauce was yummy! I should have made my patties thinner and more oval, otherwise it probably would have turned out better. I cooked it as is otherwise with mash potatoes and doubled the gravy.

DON'T CHANGE A THING...just the shape of it. So much easier to prep and cook and no frying.
I have made this recipe a few times but as a baked meatloaf instead of fried individual patties.  I mix the meat as directed, place it in a Pam-greased pyrex loaf dish, turn it upside down after running a butter knife around the edges of the pyrex dish and let the meat fall out on the center of a cookie sheet covered with parchment paper and bake it at 350 for around 1 hour. I place the other ingredients in a small pan and simmer it for a little while. Then I pour the "gravy" over the meatloaf. Fabulous.  The key is the french onion soup so do not eliminate it.  Bon Appétit!

So easy and so wonderful!!  My husband and my 2yr old ate all of their supper and nearly licked the plate.  I did fry in pan and then moved them to a 9x13 baking dish and baked them for 325 for 30 mins!!  Will be making this again!!

I agree with most people that it's not fair to rate the recipe if you change it, but I followed everyone's suggestions and didn't even use the original recipe. I added a can of cream of mushroom, some beef gravy in place of the ketchup, added 1 pkg onion soup mix to the gravy mix... add garlic and onion to the meat, don't add salt since the gravy has plenty of it.  It was to die for!  I had a friend calling for the recipe the next week so she could make it for some guests.  Serve with red garlic mashed potatoes, delicious!

Ok, five stars.  This was great!  I had some friends over for dinner and I chose this because, we live in Brazil, so as simple as it is in the US, I thought everyone would be surprised.  And surprised they were! The only thing I did was add some salt to the beef to fit our taste.

We liked this. I served with mashed potaotes. I did follow others advise and double the sauce which was right on target, I doubt we would have had enough otherwise.  Also, I cooked in the oven too.

I made some simple changes, but the sauce on this needs to be doubled.  I only made 6 patties and it was not even close to enough gravy.

SO EASY and yummy - a real comfort meal. I followed the suggestions of others and omited the ketchup and doubled the remaining sauce ingredients. Served with mashed potatoes and green beans almondine. A great homecooked meal that couldn't be easier. It was just as good as leftovers!

I wish I could rate this higher..but the sauce was what earned the 3 stars. Like other reviews stated..the ketchup was way too much. And the Worcestershire Sauce was also too much. I really like how the meat patties turned out. But in order to save this meal, I added a can of cream of mushroom soup and milk to dilute the original flavor. Adding that changed the meal and this was not the salisbury steak I was craving. Thank you for a great base though!

I typically don't review a recipe if I change it at all, but I felt like my idea could help someone else. I was extremely short on time, so I used cubed sirloin steaks that were already made into "steaks". I seasoned the outside with Montreal Steak seasoning and then grilled each one on my Foreman grill. Then I proceeded with the recipe as provided. It was delicious and I love the sauce it makes, especially over mashed potatoes. Definitely tastes better than it sounds like it will. Try it!

I have made this recipe a couple of times.  The first time, I made it exactly as the recipe is written.  We enjoyed it, but didn't think ketchup belonged in the sauce.  The next time I made it, I simply omitted the ketchup and we like it much better.  Will continue to make this recipe without the ketchup from now on.  Thanks!

We liked this recipe. Following other reviewer's suggestions, I doubled the sauce ingredients, but kept the ketchup amount the same. It was too much for us - the "steaks" were swimming in a runny sauce! Nobody had any complaints, but I won't make it again. I always cook with fresh ingredients (not canned soups, cake mixes, etc), and the sauce was not so delicious, that it could make up for the fact that it contained canned soup! We had this with Traditional mashed potatoes from this site also.

Great...took others' advice, added onions and cream of mushroom soup, baked in oven after browning the patties.  Even my 20 month old liked it!!!  Will be in the regular rotation!

Very good! I only used 1 lb. ground beef because thats what I had on hand. I used crushed ritz crackers instead of the bread crumbs. Turned out great even with the substitutions!

Yum! The only thing I changed was to add one can of cream of mushroom soup to the gravy, we like lots of gravy on our potatoes. Comfort food on a cold night.

I did as someone else suggested and used onion soup mix and 2 cups of water, because I did not have French onion soup.  This recipe was absolutely delicious, and my entire family (2 are picky eaters) loved it!  The meat is tender and the gravy is scrumptious!

I made this recipe last night and we all loved it!!!  By the way, this is Randy, Gina's husband.  We followed the suggestion of doubling the gravy but still only using 1/4 cup of ketchup, adding cream of mushroom soup as my second can rather than two french onion and adding a packet of dry onion soup.  I also cooked mine in the oven @ 350 for 45 minutes.  Served over mashed potatoes with steamed broccoli..  Super meal, real comfort food.

I've made this recipe a few times, as written its very bland.  The last few times i've made it however, i've followed the other reviewers advice of adding dry onion soup mix and cream of mushroom and the ending result have been 5stars. Its now one of my favorites. But nevertheless, its a completly different recipe which is why im only giving it 2 stars.

First and foremost: this dish tastes AWESOME. That being said, after making this recipe 2 or 3 times, I am so disappointed! Each time it has fallen completely apart - it's like the best mushy ground beef you've ever had. I've done it to a T, I've added more bread crumbs, I've added more egg... maybe my patties are too big. It's frustrating because I almost never have difficulty in the kitchen, especially when following the recipe exactly - I even tried it in the stove with little more success. If I ever serve it again, it's going to have to be over rice or potatoes... but it tastes SO GOOD!

This was SOOO yummy but like everyone else, the second time around I tweaked it.  I bought TWO cans of French onion soup and TWO cans of brown gravy.  I used 1/3 of the French onion soup in the patties and the rest into the gravy.  The recipe does not make nearly enough gravy.  Also, I didn't care for the taste of the ketchup so I substituted tomato sauce which tasted better to me.

This was great comfort food. I had to modify a little bit, as I didn't think French Onion Soup would fly with our tastebuds, so I used Golden Mushroom Soup instead. I did add a can of mushrooms and doubled the gravy ingredients (except for the ketchup, I probably only used 1/8 cup total). The patties did fall apart a bit on me, but oh well! I took other's advice of browning them and then baking in the oven. Baked at 375 for 30 minutes which was perfect. Served with mashed potatoes and garlic green beans... perfect comfort food. :)

I have been making this recipe for about 2 years now and my entire family loves it. It is very simple and quick. I cut back a little on the Worcestershire sauce and I flip the steaks over halfway through their 20 minute cooking time. I have also made this with ground turkey and it comes out just as good. The meat will be wetter, so you have to add some extra breadcrumbs.  Family favorite!!

This was good! I made it with mashed pototoes and green beans.  It tasted more like meatloaf to my family than salisbury steak though. This recipe didn't make enough gravy though to put on our taters though.  So i dont know if you would add more soup or what to make more gravy.  Great tasting recipe!

This rating is based on other reviewers changes. 
Absolutely delicious! I omitted the ketchup, added a can of cream of mushroom, a Lipton onion soup packet and doubled the sauce for my garlic mashed potatoes. I used italian bread crumbs because that's all I had on hand.
It was very oniony which we loved. I browned it in the skillet and placed in a foil lined casserole dish, drizzled with sauce and covered with foil. Baked at 400 for about 25-30 min.
It came out absolutely perfect! My entire family enjoyed it. Even my picky 7 year old daughter. My husband told me to keep the recipe forever.

These are amazingly simple to make & great tasting. Sometimes I make them and just simmer them in some brown gravy. I have also doubled the recipe and froze them for another time. My 3 & 4 yo boys love them too. Thanks!

this was pretty good, the first half of the experiences was 5 stars but i got really sick of it really quick.  it was kinda salty (even though i used reduced salt soup), and it was just plain old boring, sorry.  on a high note though, this recipe gets 3 stars instead of 2 because my husband thuroughly enjoyed his helping, but did agree that it lost steam toward the end.  probably won't be making this again.

Loved it!  I made it with lean ground beef and it still was good.  I also blended up the soup mixture so there wasn't any chunks of onions in it and it really made a nice sauce!  This is a great homemade version.

This recipe is great!  I followed other reviewer's advice, added a can of cream of mushroom soup to the gravy and serve it with brown rice.  This is a family favorite.  Depending on what I have in the pantry, I will sometimes make my own "french onion soup" by sauteeing an onion then adding beef broth and reduce it.  I have also, on occasion used ground turkey, which also is delicious.  Thanks for a great, easy recipe - my husband thanks you!

This was pretty good. It's nothing to write home about, but what do you expect from salisbury steak? I halved this recipe (made this for my fiance and I), but otherwise, followed Kelly's directions to the letter. I had a difficult time keeping my patties from crumbling, but found that, if turned minimally (and carefully), they were fine. Served with carrots/peas, mashed potatoes and the rest of the sauce (for topping the potatoes - yum!). This is a fine recipe for salisbury steak, but not somehting that I'd make on a routine basis (but I will make on occasion), although, I'm sure kids would gobble this up (but I don't have any...). Thanks for sharing, Kelly!

very good.. You could throw some onion and/or peppers in there and add a little kick to it if you need something extra.

The salisbury steak was very good and moist. I bought a pound of lean ground beef so I cut the recipe down to 4 servings. I didn't use the gravy in the recipe. I used a packet of mushroom and herb gravy mix. I also put it in the oven at 350 for 40 minutes. It was great. Best salisbury steak I ever had.

I modified exactly after ally99, the first review of this recipe. Outstanding! Liked by all from age 12 to 73. We should call it :ally99 Salisbury steak. I just finished the last patty about 15 min ago.

I thought this was a good recipe...however, I am a single male, and haven't tried many other recipes.  Mods that I made were around the gravy...I love packaged brown gravy, so I spiced it up with spicy brown mustard and worchestershire sauce, and the rest of the condensed onion soup that I used in the meat...delicious!!!

The meat itself was very good, and good the next day as well but the gravy tasted way too strongly of worchestshire. It was almost inedible. I would recommend anyone trying this recipe, follow it exactly (or increase gravy, perhaps) but only add the worchestshire at the end and "to taste."

haven't had salisbury steak for a looooooong time - since high school!  i would have taken a photo of this dish but we always gobble it up too fast!  this recipe was very simple to put together and is quite tasty - have made 2 times already!  i always keep dry onion soup on hand and so i will try w/that the next time i make it because i always have to go out and buy the canned condensed soup.  i will also try to make more sauce as the family loves it over everything!  thank you very much for sharing your recipe!
update:  2/08 have made this recipe a number of times.  had to double today because hubby never gets to taste more than one leftover pattie hint:  if your patties are falling apart...you need to remember NOT to dump the whole can of soup in w/the raw hamburger like i did the first couple of times i made this dish.  the recipe is PERFECT.  you can even put in a large baking pan, cover w/foil and bake at 350 in oven for around 30-45 minutes.  update:  10/08 we're having this again (double recipe) i fry in large skillet and then stand oval patties upright in dutch oven over low heat; cover and simmer for 20-30 minutes. serving w/garlic mash and mixed frozen veggies.

Delicious!  The only thing I changed was that I added chopped fresh parsley to the meat mixture, because I had it on hand and I thought it would taste yummy.  My only complaint is that I wanted more sauce.  Next time I make this I will double the sauce!  Served over homemade mashed potatoes.  I'll be the envy at the office when I heat up my leftovers tomorrow for lunch!  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  This one is going into my "Barbi's Favorite Recipes" binder and not too many new recipes that I try pass the test! Might add a can of sliced mushrooms next time too!

We all really liked this. I did use a 14 oz. can of low sodium beef broth because that is what I had and sauted an onion in a little olive oil.Will be making this again.

We have enjoyed this several times. I find it hard to find the canned french onion soup so I make my own with strong beef boullion and onions which I cook at least a 1/2 hour. Works great. I always have this in the cupboard. This is a real favorite recipe for us.

Where on Earth has this been all my life! Rainy day diner dinners of my childhood are leaping to life and I am overjoyed. 
I didn't really even fiddle with this recipe. I did add a little garlic powder to the patties and I sauteed a few mushrooms in the pan before I added the gravy and used a teenie bit of brandy to deglaze the pan, but man, am I impressed. I feel like a sweaty old guy in a white t-shirt and greasy apron made this for me. My only note is to use a non-stick skillet!

The only thing I would change about this is to reduce the mustard powder just a pinch as it was a little tart. Everything else was great! Wonderful dish and the patties were very moist and tender. I am going to try braising them in the broiler next time.

OH MY GOD, the topping is the best.  Go easy on the ketchup, and heavy on the worstershire.  The sauce can be used for any meat or steak.  I will definately be keeping cans of condensed onion soup on hand from now on!  The steak was great, it falls apart pretty easily, but still wonderful.  Rave reviews all around!!

I doubled the sauce as others had suggested, no change in the recipe and finished in the oven.  We were very dissappointed.  The steaks were tender however the sauce was so overpowering and tasted of too much worcestershire and concentrated onion soup.  I think it would be better with half onion soup and half beef broth to tame it some and perhaps a bit less worcestershire.  With a few changes I think this could be very good. Perhaps reconstituting the onion soup would help.

I made some changes as I saw others did as well. Instead of using condensed soup I used dry onion soup mix instead. For the sauce I used dry mushroom and onion soup mix. I seared the patties first then transfered them to the oven at 350 for 30 min. After they were cooked I then poured the sauce over the patties. I served this with green beans, mashed potatoes and bisquits. This made a great meal and I will make this again.

This was excellent! Even the picky teenager ate it! Like a previous reviewer, I added a can of cream of mushroom soup and the dry onion soup mix but I like a lot of gravy so I also added two cups of water with a large beef bouillon cube desolved and a jar of mushrooms. I used crushed butter crackers instead of bread crumbs and added 1/4 teaspoon poultry seasoning to the beef mixture. I trippled the flour since I added more liquid so the sauce was nice and thick. Served over noodles. This will be a keeper in our house. Thanks

It was VERY easy.   I don't know if I would do the sauce/gravy the same again.  It had a different taste to it.  Not bad but different.  I will make it again and play with the sauce  a bit.  Thanks for the recipe.

An excellent, easy to make, change from everyday ground beef recipes. It has now been added to my list of trusted standby's when I want to make something good for dinner but don't want to spend a lot of time preparing it.

Not really what I had hoped for.  The patties did not hold together well and yet had a very dry texture...as if there was too much binder.  And the sauce was too sweet.  Though it reminded my husband his mother's more simple cooking, he also found it rather bland.

What a great recipe! Very Easy to prepare and my husband loves it.  I altered it by using a canned mushroom and brown gravy sauce (I doctored it up), added fresh sauteed mushrooms, and my own special touches.  Thanks for the idea!

Easy, simple, tasty!  Used onion soup mix instead of condensed soup and added water - next time we'll make extra sauce! Made with the condensed soup and didn't like consistancy as much as when I used lipton soup mix - definatley have to make more sauce.

Tasty! It really has a delicious flavor that you can't get enough of. I have a feeling my husband will have me making this quite often. Served with garlic green beans from this site! Terrific. Thanks for the recipe.

I was looking for a good recipe for hamburger and remembered how much I loved salisbury steak as a child.  I have to say I was very impressed with this one and although I had to improvise and use cream of mushroom soup, my family loved it!  I know I will be making this again and again.

This was just fantastic!  I made exactly as the recipe states - because you can go crazy reading all the alterations and trying to make it "better."  Sometimes, it is just best to follow the actual recipe.  And thank goodness we did.  My husband, when he heard what was for dinner, was NOT enthusiastic.  But, when he tasted it, he wouldn't stop raving.  He told me to give this 5 stars and a big thank you!  Thanks from both of us!

Very good recipe easy to make.  I used a packet of dry onion soup mix, 1 bouillon cube and 1 cup of water for the meat mixture.  Used remaining and added a can of cream of mushroom soup to pan to finish cooking steaks.  Did not need additional salt called for in recipe. Very tasty but a little salty.  Will make again and try to reduce salt more next time.

This was the first Salisbury Steak I have ever made...and it was a hit... I took suggestions and used a package of Lipton Onion soup mixed with 1 1/2 Cups of water...and followed the directions...turned out beautiful! My 3yr old LOVED it! But my picky hubby said "Nope doesn't taste like the Marine Corp Boot Camp Salisbury Steak" Oh well...it was probably better, he doesn't know what is good for him!! It has been made several times over in my home...THANKS!

this recipe was great the only change I made was to reduce the ketchup to about 1 teaspoon and added 1 tbsp of flour, 1 packet of lipton beefy onion soup mix and 1 and 1/2 cups extra water (only because we like extra gravy)thank you this is a keeper!

I don't know if I should review this recipe, considering I made a lot of adjustments, but here goes: I didn't have french onion soup, so I used Cream of Mushroom. Didn't have bread crumbs, so I used Cracker Crumbs. Skipped the ketchup & mustard (as suggested by other reviewers), & went easy on the worcestershire & salt.  I used (2) instant beef gravy packets (followed the directions) and poured on top of the cooked patties & added additional mushrooms to the gravy. This recipes was super easy & tasty, & seems quite suitable for altering to personal taste or pantry availability.  Will definately cook again.

I followed others advice: Meat... omited the french onion and used a packet of dry onion soup mix and a 1/3 can of cream of mushroom soup. Gravy..Doubled everything except the ketchup. Baked at 350 for 30mins instead of stovetop for 20. This time it tasted more like the salisbury I'm use to.

I followed previous suggestions and reduced the ketchup to 1/3 and I reduced the worchestershire sauce to 1 teaspoon instead of 1 tablespoon.  With those changes it turned out great.  Will def make again.

I used dry french onion soup mix and a can of beef broth, all I had.  It turned out great.  My husband liked it a lot.  I would saute in some fresh onion next time though because he loves them.

I took the advice from other members, and used changes given my another member. She altered the recipe and I really enjoyed her version. Her changes are as follows.."I used Lipton Onion Mushroom soup & dip mix. I used half an envelope to the meat mixture as well as 1/3 cup Italian-style breadcrumbs, 2 Tbsp. of the canned french onion soup, 1 tsp. worcestershire sauce, 1/4 tsp. dry mustard, and the original 1/8 tsp. ground black pepper, I also omitted the salt. I only used 1 lb. of ground beef, which made 4 patties. For the gravy, I used the rest of the soup, the rest of the first envelope plus the other in the box of the Onion Mushroom soup & dip mix, 1 1/4 cup of water, 1 Tbsp. ketchup, 1 Tbsp. worcestershire sauce, 1/2 tsp. dry mustard, and 1 small can of sliced mushrooms, drained. The gravy turned out the right thickness so I never had to add flour or cornstarch. 

Thank you both for your suggestions, I will be making this again.

My family loved this recipe!!  I did not change the recipe except to add about a cup of beef stock to the sauce and simmered it on low and that was only because I knew that it was going to be about an hour before serving.  It was so easy and the meat turned out so tender. Thanks for the recipe - we will definitely have this again.

Yum, yum, yum!  This is a great comfort food.  Definitely make more gravy, it cooks down to almost nothing.

Modifications: Cut meat to one pound, left out ketchup, added 2-3 chopped garlic cloves, added one small grated onion.

I gave this 3 stars for the original recipe, but 5 for the alterations suggested by others. I switched it up a bit as well. I couldn't find Lipton onion soup mix, so instead I used Lipton Onion Mushroom soup & dip mix.

Yum! Yum! Yum! I didn't even have to ask my husband first what he thought. He volunteered after the first bite how great the food was! (This hardly ever happens around here.) I followed the instructions exactly...except all I had was Progresso brand French Onion Soup (not concentrate). So, I put mostly onions and very little water into the meat, drained a little of the liquid for the sauce, and added some extra flour to make sure to compensate for the liquid. Totally wonderful. Thanks for submitting it. We will be making this again and again!

Oh, and by the way, I cooked them in the pot, not the oven. I didn't have a bit of trouble with them falling apart. Just make sure they are not too thin.

Enjoy!

Very Good! Didn't have french onion soup or ketchup, so I used a can of regular beef broth & Heinz 57 instead.  The Heinz 57 gave the gravy a good "kick".  Hubby really liked it.  Guaranteed to make it again.  Thanks Kelly!

Great flavor and easy to make.  I may double up
on the gravy just because we have with mashed potatoes and my daughter wanted more to put on her potatoes.

We really liked this!  I too used cream of mushroom mixed with Lipton Onion Soup mix instead of the French Onion because I didn't have it.  Next time I'm going to sift out some of the powder of the soup mix so it's not so salty.  Also, to the soup mixture (after I take out the 1/3 c. to put in the meat) I'm going to add about 1/2 c. milk to make the gravy thinner, it turned out kind of thick.  I only used a 1 1/4 lb pack of beef and it made six pretty nice sized steaks.  Also, I think it would be good to add some shredded cheddar to the meat.  Great recipe, I'll make again.

This recipe is a winner.  I followed a couple of suggestions and made a couple changes of my own.  I didn't have french onion soup, so I used beef broth.  I sauted one large diced onion and one pkg. of baby portabello mushrooms until soft.  I added about 1/4 of them to the meat mixture and the rest I added to the sauce along with a can of cream of mushroom soup.  I served it with homemade mac and cheese and green beans.  My husband cleared his plate and even took it to work the next day, which never happens, and my 2 1/2 year old who only eats chicken nuggets and McD's hamburgers ate it and asked for more!  I will definetly make this again!

Great!  Everyone loved it.  And that is saying something.  Didn't have mustard but was very tasty anyway.

This was the first time I ever tried to make salisbury from scratch, not only was it easy to make this was a meal my husband truly enjoyed. I will be making this again in the future as well as passing it on to friends and faimly. This is a must try if you have not already.

I have a feeling that if I had kids and needed to make larger quantities of food easily, I would have given this 5 stars.

This was tasty.  I added sliced fresh mushrooms to the sauce.  I only used 1 tsp. of Worcestershire sauce as I wasn't sure if it would be too tangy with a Tbsp.  I'll increase the Worcestershire seasoning when I make it again to adjust it to our taste (next time 1 and 1/2 tsp.).  I didn't flatten my patties much.  My oval patties actually looked like little meatloafs.

This was GREAT! Next time, however, I will just make the burgers with dry onion soup mix. Also, I remember the sauce as a child being somewhat sweet, so I added about 1 TBS of brown sugar to the sauce while it was simmering..It was great. I also doubled the sauce per other reviews and last but not least, to complete this meal you MUST HAVE some mashed potatoes!!! Thanks so much for the recipe!!! This is a keeper!

Excellent. I made this as meatballs instead of patties and served it over wide egg noodles. I doubled the sauce which turned out to be perfect for the amount of meatballs. I'll be making this again. Thanks Kelly!

I LIKED THIS RECIPE BUT CHANGED IT A BIT. INSTEAD OF MAKING THE PATTIES I CRUMBLED THE GROUND BEEF AND LEFT OUT THE EGG AND BREAD CRUMBS. I USED A CAN OF FRENCH ONION SOUP AND A CAN OF CREAM OF MUSHROOM SOUP AND MIXED IT ALL TOGETHER WITH PASTA. I WILL MAKE THIS AGAIN.

The meat was nice and tender, I added chopped onions to the gravy and patty's. I didn't have condensed french onion soup so I subbed cream of mushroom soup and used dryed french onion soup.

Wow, I was NOT impressed. The sauce was very gloppy...and the patties didn't have much flavor. I've definitely had better Salisbury Steaks. I won't make this again.

I have made this recipe twice now with no revisions and got rave reviews from my family.  The only thing I did was double the gravy (which smells heavenly) and served it over mashed potatoes.  I did have to pour off the oil a few times but you always do with lean ground beef.  Definitely a keeper and I'm wishing I had the time to make it tonight.  I'd give it 10 stars if I could, my house smells amazing when I make it as the patties simmer away in the gravy!

My family absolutely loves this dish over noodles. I do make a packet of dry onion soup mix seperate from the recipe and then add it to remaining 1/3 can soup, so im sure to have enough gravy!

Quick and easy. I couldn’t find the canned soup. I substituted for Onion soup mix. I found another review with the same substitution. She recommended one package soup mix with two cups water and leave out the extra water. 

SO DELICIOUS!

I have made this many times over the past 4 years.  As I am trying to stay away from processed foods, I don’t use the onion soup, So I put diced onion in the burger mixture.  I only use 1 lb of lean ground beef....  Also, I slice a medium onion and use 8 oz of sliced baby Bella mushrooms, these added after I turn the patties over. All other ingredients are as the recipe calls for, except I use potato starch instead of flour.

I will give the taste a five but I had to give the recipe a two because the ingredients doesn't give enough for the gravy. Normally the salisbury sides are mashed potatoes or white rice. You're supposed to have enough gravy for the mashed potatoes or rice as well as the salisbury itself. This recipe and ingredients did not.My recommendation if you want gravy as well to add an additional can of condensed French Onion Soup or even two additional cans for good measure.

Tastes like Granny's.  I made my own gravy and pan sear patties, then bake in gravy.  Every Wednesday blue plate at my diner & sell out by 1 every Wednesday!

this was my first time making this recipe and all in all it turned out pretty good. Pretty sure for the most part I followed the recipe as written. I think the only real minor differences I have is I mistook one of the measurements and put a little bit more black pepper in it than the recipe called for which wasn't even noticeable, and I used Italian style panko breadcrumbs because it's usually the type i have already on hand. turned out delicious in my family enjoyed it. My only thing is that there wasn't really too much of the sauce left after cooking. it still tasted good but might need a little bit more sauce

I’ve made my Salisbury steak this way for years but made my gravy slightly different. I was eager to try a new recipe for gravy. The entire meal turned out wonderful. I used Ally99’s alterations and it came out delicious. I love the addition of the French onion soup, it adds a delightful beefy flavor. I’ve made this several times so far and each time I’ve had stellar results. I served it with five cheese mashed potatoes and it was a hit.

The only change I made was substituting Worcestershire sauce for A-1 and soy sauce because I didn't have any on hand.  I don't like the cream of mushroom method, but I would use a little of real or jar mushroom if I felt like it.  The steaks turned out great and better than I expected.  I'm glad they weren't hard.  I might use a tad less ketchup next time since I'm not crazy about ketchup.  Plenty of gravy, which i bit with my mashed potatoes and sweet corn- delish!  Bonus points for how easy it was to make.  I'll make this again sometime.

Have made it a few times now, and the only thing we have changed is to double the gravy; we want to make sure we have enough for the mashed potatoes and as written, it's not quite enough.  The second time we made it, it occurred to us too late that we only had one can of soup. We simply sliced an onion and used some low  sodium beef broth instead and it was just fine.

I made this a few days ago.  I took advice from other people that doubled the gravy.  I used two cans of french onion soup, and two cans of cream of mushroom soup.  I browned the patties in my frying pan, then I cooked them in the oven.  Everyone loved these!  I will make this again!  Thank you for a good recipe that's a keeper.

Because my husband is a "gravy junkie" I made a packet of the Knorrs brown gravy mix then added the ketchup, onion soup & worcestershire sauce to taste.  Then poured it over the salisbury steaks and let them cook.  Came out awesome.  Definitely will make this again !

This is a family favorite.  I do not change anything except that I do double everything for the gravy.  It's just so good, we need more for our mashed potatoes.  Very quick and easy recipe that I make on a regular basis.

Really good and quick.
 I also sautéed a small container of fresh mushrooms and small yellow onion in olive oil and added when simmering. I added garlic salt and pepper to the meat mixture. The formed "steaks" fell apart a bit when browning

I made this last night and it was awesome.  I did a couple of changes but I am not sure that it would have been necessary.  I used 1 lb. of ground beef instead of 1.5.  I used 90/10.  For the bread crumbs I used garlic and butter croutons made into crumbs by my Ninja.  I added about 2 tbsp. of water just in case it would dry out using more bread crumbs for less meat.  It was a hit with everyone.  Even my picky eater.  He dipped in ketchup and he was happy

My family loves these steaks!   I browned the steaks on the stove top. Then I sauteed some fresh mushrooms and a little bit of onion because we like those in our gravy (and they're in the picture but not the recipe??). I followed other reviewers' advice and added a can of cream of mushroom soup to the condensed French onion soup both to thicken it up and make more gravy to serve with the mashed potatoes I made on the side. I put all ingredients in a 9x13 pan covered in the oven at 400 degrees for 30 minutes.   I'm not sure I would add the ketchup next time.
NOTE to self: My family devours these - double the recipe!

OMG.  Don't change a thing.  I made this recipe EXACTLY as described for the first time and it turned out amazing.  If you want a fair rating this is it.  For those of you rated this recipe but changed things in order to try and make it better in your mind, please don't in the future.  You are wrecking the spirit of this App, and we don't care about your 2 cents worth.  My family simply loved it, and it if we're not for social etiquette, I would not have needed to wash the plates.  I am not even kidding.  The meat was perfect, the sauce was perfect, and for lack of a better word the entire recipe was.....spoiler alert....PERFECT.  Kudos to Kelly Berenger for posting the recipe, and to sky.watch, Cindy Johnson, Maureen Frusha-Boutwell, Vince317, and many others who didn't change a thing.  A++++.

I just have to say that this is one of my families favorite meals. All 4 of my children get excited about this meal and their friends ask to have dinner with us because of it. Everyone loves loves this recipe. It's not hard to  make and tastes amazing. I love how juicy the meat is and how it melts in your mouth. If i could give it more stars I would.

Sweet Jesus of Nazareth. That was fan-friggin-tactic. The sauce has brought my potatoes to another level. This meal was enjoyed immensely by the pickiest of children. The meal as a whole, with biscuits and extra sauce to soak up with them has brought me to a euphoric state of culinary satisfaction that is rarely matched. Wow!  I don't normally recommend things but ... THIS!

I wasn't a fan. It wasn't horrible but the flavors I don't know just didn't mesh well for me!  Thanks for sharing though!

I have made this recipe WITH NO CHANGES many times, and I am rating it a five star recipe. I didn't start out with a recipe for something like biscuits, change every ingredient as well as the cooking method, then end up with chocolate cake and say, "It was the BEST chocolate cake ever!",  giving it 5 stars. Recipe is perfect exactly as written. Love it! :-)

I have made this recipe quite a bit over the past few years. Making the recipe as-is, I didn't like the overpowering flavor of the ketchup and have played around with the levels to get it where everyone in the house likes. I, like many other people, also threw in mushrooms, which makes it even better.

I will definitely make this again, however you must use the low sodium french onion soup if you can find it, otherwise it's really salty, i also hate ketchup so i used mcormicks brown gravy mix instead and voila fantastic I also hate lean beef so used 2 lbs of 80% and again it was great

I followed the recipe the first time, but the ketchup taste was a little much so the next time I switched it for bbq sauce. My family loved it. A must in our house at least once a week

I Made this Slow Cooker Salisbury Steak last Sunday, exactly as the recipe shows. I added 1 small jar of sliced mushrooms, (about an hour before it was finished cooking) at the request of my hubby. I Made homemade mashed potatoes and green beans as a side, and it got rave reviews from everyone at the dinner table! There really isn't much 'cooking' to this meal, which I love! I'll admit I was a little skeptical when I saw that a beef dinner called for 2 cans of cream of chicken soup, But WOW, what a FABULOUS meal it turned out to be! The gravy turns a nice dark brown shade during cooking, just like the photo, and it is so full of beefy flavor, without being too salty! The gravy was delicious on the meat, and especially as a topping on the potatoes too!This was a very Easy recipe to put together, you basically just brown the meat, stir the ingredients and put it all in the crock pot. I used my hamburger press when I shaped the patties for browning, which helped to keep them all a nice uniform size. I wound up with 10 Salisbury steaks Appx 4" round. This meal fed 4 adults and 2 kids, with leftovers,  which were eaten for lunch the next day, and it  tasted twice as good!  The meat held together perfectly, even after cooking in the crock pot which made it easy to transfer to a serving dish at dinner time. This was the Perfect family meal for a chilly Sunday in winter. It's a Wonderful 'Comfort Food' recipe, and My kids have even asked me twice this week if I'll make those 'gravy b

Rating this recipe how it is, I give it four stars. With a few modifcations I'm in LOVE. For the gravy, I use the rest of the french onion soup can, a can of cream of mushroom soup, a bit of brown gravy mix to thicken it up, the mustard powder, and worchestershire sauce. Its delish. I also put a bit of minced garlic in the meat mixture, as well as lawry's seasoned salt and garlic powder. I brown the patties first and then cover them in the gravy in a baking pan, and cook for 30 minutes at 400 degrees. Pretty amazing.

Loved it.. I made this recipe but omitted the canned soup. I added other spices to it like red pepper flakes , cumin, and onion powder. Also,  I mixed  turkey , pork and beef ground meat together. I grilled my patties and they came out delicious. My brothers enjoyed the patties very much. Thank you

I made this recipe exact. (I don't think it's fair to rate a recipe after you've made it a different recipe.) i gave it 4 stars because the ketchup made it taste too sweet/ketchupy. Lol. Next time I make it I'll omit it. But it was very good!   Definitely will be a family favorite.

Doubled sauce with extra can of French Onion, can of cream of mushroon, and lipton soup packet. Omitted ketchup. Used Pino Noir instead of water. After browning, removed patties, sauteed mushrooms and onions in pan and scraped up bits with Pinot. Really added depth. SO loved it!!

This turned out great!  I didn't have a pan big enough to make them separately so I made it as a meatloaf, cooked about 90%, then sliced it and laid the pieces in a casserole dish and topped with the sauce for final cooking.

We bought a 1/4 cow and I have lots of ground beef and I though I would give it a try.  Everyone liked it!  Must be served with mashed potatoes! My son's preferred it over meatloaf and I have to say it was a lot faster than making meatloaf.

This is a very yummy take on Salisbury Steak.  The only changes I made was I had no bread crumbs on hand, so I crushed some garlic flavored croutons I had in my food processor.  Also, I doubled the amount of gravy.  This is a very delicious recipe.

BAM!  Very easy and definitely a winner.  Just like one of the pictures, I served with corn (from a can) and instant mashed potatoes (I cheat!).  File this one under "Quick & Easy."

This was a great recipe for my family to have I did some minor changes I used a fresh chopped onion mixed in the ground beef. I did a brown gravy mix with a can of cream of mushroom. Delicious to have with mashed potato.

Yummy! I did follow other viewers advice of adding a can of Cream of Mushroom Soup so I would have enough gravy. I also baked at 350 for 45 minutes after browning and pouring the mixture over the meat. I sauted and added fresh mushrooms and onions on top of the steaks at the end.  My husband said the house smelled great and he also said "it was the best Salisbury Steak he ever had". He never says any meal is the best he has ever had so this is a keeper! Thank you for the recipe. Better than meatloaf!

As written I would give it 4 stars. 

But after my adjustments it's 5 stars. I did double the sauce by adding in Cream of Mushroom and Beef stock. I put fresh cut mushrooms in the sauce too. I also added onion, garlic, cumin, and chili powder to my meat mixture. It tasted great!!!

The family devoured this. I wasn't too keen on the texture of the meat. It seemed "heavy" to me. Of course I cant rule out cooks error either :) Followed the recipe to the letter. The taste was great but it was the texture that lost a star for me. Might try this again to see if it was something i did...

Great comfort food! I made the recipe as written; however, I did make extra gravy and browned the patties in a skillet then placed them in a baking dish, poured the gravy over them and baked at 350 for about 30 minutes. Excellent!

Made as directed gets 4 stars... Used golden mushroom and cream of mushroom canned soups and spike seasoning and it gets 5 stars.  Next time I think I will add sautéed mushrooms and carmelized onions.

Better than I imagined! I took the advice of skipping the ketchup and adding the cream of mushroom soup along with the french onion soup for the gravy. Everything else, I just followed the recipe. This is definitely in the weekly rotation.

My husband loved it!  I was truly surprised by how tasty this was!  I left my phone home on the charger when I went to grocery store and accidentally bought onion soup mix. I have a big family so I used 2.5lbs of ground beef and the whole pack of dry soup mix , and doubled the rest of the ingredients.  The amount of gravy to spoon over the meat just covered each paddy.  All in all mmmm good

Crazy good, super moist & flavorful. A defiant keeper in my recipe binder. I doubled the sauce just in case there wasn't enough! Had lots left over so used that to serve over the potatoes I prepared!

11/17/17 - I made this a second time, finally! I used the condensed French Onion soup this time and added more bread crumbs to the patties. They held together a lot more easily this time around. I also loaded it down with lots of sliced onions that I sauteed in the ground beef grease from frying the patties beforehand.  
8/6/14 - My family and I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe. I did not have any condensed French Onion soup on hand, so instead I mixed together a pack of dry onion soup mix with a can of cream of mushroom and chicken soup. So glad I did this - the patties were mushy as it was (I can't imagine them staying together if I'd have used the soup it called for.) I made the patties *in* the pan as they cooked, I'd put in a spoonful at a time until it all stuck together. The sauce itself was delicious. I'd never had Salisbury steak before but my husband said this tasted close to the one he had as a child. Next time, I may tweak a little but great recipe. I'll definitely fix it again :)

I have tried other hamburger steak recipes which were very good but this one is my "keeper". Made as written and loved by all who try it.

Kids and I LOVED it!  Husband didn't care for it because it was too much like meatloaf which he hates.  

So quick and easy. Definitely going into our rotation. :)

The meat was indeed like many say .. meatloaf consistency.  Not bad .. but not really good either.  When it got to the sauce the Worcestershire was overpowering and the ketchup just added a vinegar taste to the sauce.  I will keep searching in my quest for a great recipe for Salisbury steak.  I really don't understand why this recipe has gotten such high reviews.

It's pretty good, just like a blue plate special at a diner, you should omit the salt with the ground beef though, the French onion soup is salty enough.

Okay, I made this for the first time a couple weeks ago and followed the recipe except I only used one tablespoon of ketchup.  The flavor wasn't anything special and there was not much gravy.  I rated this from the first time I made it because it was closest to the recipe.  The second time I made it I took morgmoms advice and used 1 packet of French onion soup mix (Lipton).  Half the packet I used in the meat mixture and half I used for the gravy.  I omitted the canned soup completely.  For the patties I also added about a teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce, 2 tablespoons of milk omitted the salt and used eggs and breadcrumbs, of course.  For the gravy, first I sautéed onions and mushrooms in 3 tablespoons of butter.  Then I added 3 tablespoons of flour and the rest of the onion soup mix, and mixed that up for a minute or so.  Finally I added 1 cup of beef STOCK, not broth and 1 cup of water.  This was the best salisbury steak I ever made!  I am going to submit this to allrecipes, although it takes them forever to review and post it.

I use crushed croutons instead of bread crumbs. Substituted cream of mushroom soup for the French onion soup. I also add beef bouillon to the gravy for flavor. It has been a recipe we continue to make!!

This was delicious! I didn't have crackers or breadcrumbs on hand so I used seasoned croutons instead. I added mustard, Worchester sauce, barbecue sauce, salt ,pepper and caramelized onions to the meat mixture. I also added caramelized onions and mushrooms to the gravy along with about a TBSP each of Worchester sauce, barbecue sauce and mustard.  Definitely a keeper!

Tried this not expecting much since I'm not a Salisbury steak fan and was pleasantly surprised at how good this was.  Made it exactly as the recipe told me to an  it was a hit.  Will definately make again. The only change will be to double the sauce. Thanks for the recipe.

I made the hamburger but did not use the french onion soup.  I used an envelope of mushroom and onion soup by Lipton and added that to my meat mixture.  It was very good. I used the other packet and followed the directions on the side of the box and made the gravy as someone suggested.  It sure saves a lot of time!  I added mushrooms to the gravy.  All in all, this was good and I will make it again.

It fixed the recipe as written except I doubled the gravy as others recommended since we are gravy folks, but kept the ketchup at 1/4 c. I thought the steak itself was perfect, so tasty, but I wasn't a huge fan of the gravy from the ketchup standpoint. It was still too twangy I thought. Really good enough to make again, but next time I think I'll tweak the ketchup down to 1/8 c and try that. It's still not a basic onion soup gravy flavor totally but I don't want a tomato flavor in this dish. Was really super over rice.

Wow. YUM!! My husband had been requesting 'Salisbury Steak' for a while, but honestly, I didn't really know what it was and it sounded intimidating! Little did I know, it's essentially just a meat-loaf patty smothered in delicious gravy. I followed this recipe, and the few listed changes mentioned by other reviewers, and was really impressed. A VERY yummy dish, and super easy to make. Used ground sirloin, & served with parmesan mashed potatoes & steamed broccoli. Will absolutely be making this again.

Unless ketchup is your favorite thing in the world, leave it out entirely. The flavor is too overpowering. I left it out the second time I made this and it was much better.

Made this as stated except doubled the gravy (but not the ketchup).  My husband really liked it, one son liked it, the other ate 3 helpings! He even said it was 'better than school's' which I am choosing to take as a compliment.

Should be 5 stars! BUT they pictured mushrooms in the sauce, which is missing. I sautéed 8 oz. of mushrooms with 1 tsp of butter and 1 tsp of olive oil. Doubled the amount of sauce and added the sautéed mushroom. After the initial browning I added the sauce to the pan. Covered and placed in a 350 degree oven for 40 minutes. This is another keeper recipe for the books. Even my 4 yr old grandson liked it! Thank you Kelly Berenger! 
Update: I followed ALLY99 recommendations and it was GREAT!!!

Whenever, I cook anything it's always something that I feel like eating, but I actually cook with the hope that my son will love it!  He is only 8 years old and his palette is not fully developed, but with allrecipes I'm working on it!  He loved this recipe he asked me to give it 5 stars!  I always make the recipe exactly as written but in this case I did double the gravy and I'm glad I did, I made it with mashed potatoes and I had enough gravy to go over the mashed potatoes.  For the next time I will remember to flatten the patties so they do not resemble hamburgers.

This is AWESOME!  Hamburger steaks are one of dh's favorite dishes, so we have them regularly - they have never come out as tender with such good gravy as this tho.  Next time I will attempt to double the gravy (did double the Worcestershire) and  hope it comes out as tasty.  Did not add the flour or salt, and cooked, covered, in the oven at 175 for several hours after browning.  Thank you so much for sharing!

This has turned into a family fav. I cut out the ketchup and use a can of mushroom soup in the gravy. I also brown the patties then bake them in the oven as other have suggested.

I have used this recipe a number of times & enjoyed it each & every time.  I have substituted the french onion soup with Lipton's dry mushroom/onion or beefy onion soup mix (mixed the soup with 2 cups of water & microwaved for 2 mins) when I didn't have the canned french onion & it still is delicious. This also makes more gravy! I also add sliced, sauteed mushrooms during the final stage of simmering.  Its so easy to make & a hit every time with the family!

I just made this tonight for dinner and I really didn't care for it. I don't know what happened but my patties didn't stay together. They all fell apart. This was just not one of my favorites.

This wasn't an amazing dish. I agree with alot of raters...the gravy wasn't very appetizing. My food critics (5 chiildren and hubby) loved the steak itself...but didn't like the gravy. I will try one reviewers suggestion of one can of french onion and one can of cream of mushroom.

This one is a huge thumbs up.  My 10 year old actually gave me an "OMG" when he took his first bite!  I took another reviewers advice of moving them to a casserole after browning and baked it for 45 minutes at 375.  They were perfect.  This recipe is a keeper.

Made some of the suggested changes (e.g., extra gravy). Pan fried the steaks and lost only one. Added frozen peas to the pan, and served over rice. Yum!

I apologize in advance for a negative review.  I found the sauce to be extremely confusing to the palate and simply inedible. it had overwhelming strange tangy, almost vinegar flavor..  I made it exactly as directed and even doubled the sauce because other reviewers  stated it was so good they wanted extra. This is actually the first and only recipe I've made from this site that I found to be an extreme disappointment.

Instead of the French onion soup, I used a package of lipton onion and mushroom soup reconstituted with 1 c of water and heated in the oven to dissolve.  Just let it cool a little before mixing it in with the egg.  Also I fried up some mushrooms to put in the gravy.

This was a winner in my house. Like most people, I changed the origional recipe, the second time around also. I added a pinch of garlic to my meat mixture and used a can of cream of mushroom soup. My wife doesnt like mushrooms so the soup idea works well because their so small she doesnt even notice that they are in there. To give the meat a little extra eye appeal, I used my G. Forman Grill to cook the meat. Nice sear marks on the meat and no grease to deal with. I like my meat a little on the spicier side so I used Chineese Mustard for a little extra kick. It was too the nine's anyway you make it! Depending on our mood, we will serve it over mashed potatoes, rice or wide egg noodles. We love gravy so we doubled that part of the recipe. Leftovers are the bomb! YUMMY

Followed recipe alterations from other reviewers. Omitted the salt. ADDED INGREDIENTS: can of cream of mushroom soup, mixed 1 envelope of onion soup mix, sauteed 1/2 onion sliced, sliced baby portobello mushrooms w/ sauce.

Browned 6 patties on top of stove. Finished in oven, 375 degrees, transferred patties to large casserole dish, poured sauce mix over patties, covered w/ aluminum foil. Cooked for 25 min. Removed foil, cooked for additional 5 minutes. Removed from oven and voila.....Super Delish!!!! Taste like recipe took hours. Served w/ garlic mashed potatoes and steamed veggie mix.

My husband is actually the one who made this for me, and it was incredibly delicious. I couldn't stop eating it! He knows nothing of cooking, so the fact that he could make a delicious dish proves that this dish is easy to do and simple to follow. He followed the recipe exactly, and my only criticism would be that there wasn't enough! Terrific dinner, and great with mashed potatoes and broccoli.

I did try it, and followed recipe for the"steaks".  However, not having French Onion Soup broth, I carmelized yellow onions, and made a beef broth (using powdered beef broth, mixed in water),about an eigth of a cup of ketchup with about a quarter cup of red wine reduction: added fresh sliced mushroom and some minced Rosemary.  Steak recipe good and sauce was amazing.  I served it over a dollop of leftover Farro and gold raisin, with a small side of spinich and remaining Rosemary.  Better than your average burger^-^

My family loved this. I made the tweaks like almost everyone else, adding Lipton onion soup and  1/2 cream of mushroom soup.  It was absolutely delicious. They are still talking about 3 days later.  

Thanks for sharing.

I wasn't a big fan of the sauce.  I think there was a little too much ketchup in it for my taste.  If I make it again, I think I will tweak it to make the sauce less tangy and maybe add some sauteed onions to it.

I have never made Salisbury Steak before but was aware of it as a kind of old fashioned comfort food. We loved this and it was easy to prepare. Served with red garlic mashed potatoes and corn. Will definately make again.

We just had this for dinner. My whole family enjoyed this very much. Easy to make and easy to put together. I didn't have condensed onion but had it dry onion soup mix and substituted can of cream of mushroom. Mixed half of onion soup in meat mixture and half with gravy mixture. Honestly next time will leave out ketchup, did not care for the twang it gave (personal taste). All around definite 5 star.

I love this stuff.  It just disappears off the table when I make it.  My little tweaks were using the breadcrumbs with Italian seasoning and last night I added a little cooking sherry to the sauce before the 20 minute cook time.  That just added more flavor to an already great dish. YUM!

Followed the recipe exactly, the meat was very moist, but there was a taste in the gravy that was overpowering and I think that it was the ketchup. Gonna use a little less next time.

Good recipe.  After reading reviews, I added some dry onion soup mix to the beef, and doubled the sauce minus the ketchup; also, I didn't have any dried mustard so substituted some Dijon mustard in there.  I browned the steak patties (they stayed together pretty well for me) and then put them in a foil covered casserole dish and poured the sauce/gravy over it.  Covered and baked at 375 degrees F for about half an hour or so.  Good and moist, but again, the patties keep together really well.

UPDATE: I made this tonight but with the mushroom soup that alot of people have suggested, And honestly sticking with the recipe is the better way for me, Especially if you are watching your sodium.
I made this last night, So I have had it fresh and warmed up, and both were great, The only change I made to this recipe was used home made french onion soup, My only complaint was that there was not enough gravy, But this can easily be changed next time, My husband said it was a million times better then any other tv dinner. Thanks for the great recipe and another great addition to me rotating meal plan :)

Very good and very easy to prepare. The only thing I would change is making more sauce and taking out the ketchup. I think the ketchup made it taste more like meatloaf than salisbury steak but overall very tasty.

I made no changes to this recipe. I did make a second batch of gravy after the first batch because we like alot of gravy. I thought this was good, not mind blowing but still good and I will definitely be making this for dinner reguarly especially because it's so simple.

Love, love, love this recipe with modifications as mentioned by some other people.  I used 2 cans of French Onion soup, 1 3/4# ground beef, 3/4c bread crumbs, 1 1/2T flour, 1/2 cup water, 2T Worcestershire sauce, 1 pkg. dry onion soup mix, and omitted the salt and ketchup.  I also added about a tsp of garlic powder to the meat and browned it with 3 slices of bacon to add a little flavor.

I was looking for something to put in the crock pot, so I only browned both sides of the patties in the skillet, transferred them to the crock pot, poured the sauce over the patties, and cooked on low for about 4-5 hours.

Made these for a couple of hungry guys after a hard days work and it all disappeared!  Was glad I doubled the recipe for the gravy, because we served it over garlic masshed potatoes. Yum yum!

I tried this meal last night.  I didn't have a can of french onion soup, so I used a packet of Lipton onion soup in a 2 cup measuring cup. That was the only change I did, and we all thought the Salisbury steaks were really good. This recipe is a definite keeper.  I will definitely make this recipe again.  Thank You Kelly Berenger for submitting it.  Yum  Yum...

Thanks for the recipe and suggestions :) It was DELICIOUS. For the patties, I added garlic powder with the salt, black pepper, and dried onion flakes and 2tsp. mayo ( instead of 1 egg ) then mixed in the bread crumbs and formed them into oval patties. I browned them in a nonstick skillet on both sides then placed them in a dinner plate with raised sides. Then I poured some gravy on the steak patties. For the gravy, I mixed together 1 can ( 10.5 ounce ) cream of mushroom soup, 1 jar of Heinz mushroom brown gravy and 1/4 can of water. I mixed the sauce until simmering then poured some brown gravy on garlic mashed potatoes and served with steamed, buttered broccolli florets. Yum! :D

This was surprisingly easy and delicious! I could not find condensed onion soup so I used Campbell's French Onion Soup instead. I still stuck to the 1/3 cup in the meat mixture and for the sauce on top I used another 1/3 cup of soup I only used 1/8 cup water rather than 1/4 because the soup was not condensed. At all points in the cooking process it either looked disgusting or smelled hideous so I was a little nervous what the end product would be. However, the patties were absolutely delicious! Melted right in your mouth. The recipe cook times are spot on, no adjustment needed. I would maybe add some sauteed onions and mushrooms next time for presentation. Definitely making this again, my family wanted seconds and even thirds!

Family really liked this recipe. I used onion soup mix and water instead of canned and added a can of cream of mushroom to the gravy. I also doubled the gravy. Only change ill make next time is cut out the mustard or use a lot less only because my husband doesnt care for mustard and the flavor showd through

I used dry onion soup mix to get around the problem and using Cream of Mushroom would be pointless to help the flavor. 

There needs to be more sauce so I will try some others suggestions on how to make more sauce next time. I may just make some brown gravy. 

I also finished cooking the meat in the oven.  This made the gravy way too greasy.  Next time I will stick with just cooking it in the pan so I can drain off the fat.

Over all, this is a good place to start, but it needs some love to make it better. Three stars for being edible with dry onion mix.

This recipe was a huge hit! I made it as written and there was plenty of gravy to spoon over noodles. We will definitely make this again. It is only fair to review recipes if they are prepared as written. The video was very helpful

I love this recipe. To be fair, I do not follow the recipe exactly, rather I've changed it up thanks to the reviews.  I add 1/3 can of cream of mushroom soup to the ground beef mixture along with seasoned salt, breadcrumbs, diced onions and some diced garlic.  

I also do not make the gravy as written in this recipe, I just make two packets of lipton onion and mushroom soup mix as the gravy, following the directions on the side of the box.  After browning the patties in the skillet, I transfer to a casserole dish, pour sauce over the top and bake in the oven for about 30 minutes.  Comes out sooooo moist and delish, it's indescribable! We eat with mashed potatoes and sister shubert rolls. MMMMM.

First time ever making this..Awesome!!  I did as another person suggested and added cream of mushroom and dried dried onion soup to gravy. I baked at 400 for 30 minutes.  Definately do whatever you can to 2X or 4X the gravy....it will not go to waste.  We were so anxious to taste, I did not get a photo of it...there will be a next time.

This was a definite hit for Sunday night home cooked comfort food.  Made some mashed potatoes and baked cauliflower to go with.  Easy, tasty and a crowd pleaser.  Clean plates all round and a resounding "yes" to the "should I make this again" question.

Pretty good. Added a can of cream of mushroom soup like some others suggested, and a little more water. Otherwise I think there would not have been enough gravy.  Next time will leave out the ketchup.

A ketchup based gravy was not what I was looking for. However, the base part of the recipe is awesome. As for the gravy, I have found that it's better to use an additional can of French onion soup and make the gravy from that. If gives a beefy-er, onion-er  flavor that is much more complementary of the dish.

This was a great meal. Not too sure I cared for the ketchup in the sauce and neither did my husband, but the rest of the meal was great. I will make this again. I did add some mushrooms to the sauce and it was great.

Very good!  I'm not a Salisbury Steak connoisseur by any means, but this is an easy & tasty weeknight dinner. 

Also, I had a little extra time that morning and made my own French Onion soup and used instead of canned.  Tasted great!

This was very, very good.  I was surprised at how moist the meat turned out.  Just a side note, I have made this according to recipe posted, and also tweaked a bit, and both are great.  If you like a more onion salty meat, you can add a packet of onion soup mix and cream of mushroom soup to the gravy and its wonderful.  Sometimes I only use 1/2 packet of the onion soup because hubby doesnt like alot of salt...if i do it this way I dont add any salt to the hamburger meat.  Dont forget to add fresh mushrooms to gravy if you like them!

Made exactly as written, but used ground venison in place of beef and didn't add salt. Husband and I both loved it. I added fresh sliced mushrooms when I added the sauce to the pan. Served with mashed potatoes and corn. Will make again for sure. A+

This recipe has great flavor but instead of making the six parties the original recipe said to make I would recommend doubling that. My parties were way to big for the sauce amount in my pan.

This was just ok.  I added the extra can of mushroom soup as suggested.  The consistency of the meat was great and the sauce has a nice taste but I'm rating it a 4 because it wasn't spectacular.

This was a very easy dish to make, but did not care for it at all.

Very good and yummy, however a bit salty. I always make a double batch of the gravy to serve with mash potatoes, and serve along with fresh green beans or snap peas :)

This is so good. I have added cream of mush soup a couple of times when I had it on hand and it is pretty good.  But you really don't need to change a thing with this recipe.  It is a hit as written at my house.

I made this as written but was making it for 30.  So easy to make.  the only thing i did different was that I put them in a large pan in the oven to bake while the rest of the dinner was prepared.  I should have make extra sauce for the gravy.  Everyone at the dinner raved and wanted the recipe.  Said the aroma in the parking lot was so good they could hardly wait to get inside to eat.

One of my favorite memories of the school cafeteria was salisbury steak.  I was looking to duplicate that.  This was very close.  My kids were skeptical but none of it was left and everyone was happy.

My family did not like this recipe. The beef patties were good but the sauce tasted like it came right from a can.  I don't mind using ingredients from a can as long as it does not taste like it. My 18 year old son (who is NOT a picky eater and will eat almost anything) said the sauce was "gross." My fiance drowned it in A1 and said it was edible. I  might use the recipe for the patties again but definitely not the sauce.

my family really didnt like this at all. I followed the recipe as written. We found the patties seemed dense and heavy and the gravy was over powered by the onion flavor. wont be making again.

4 stars for easiness.3 for taste. My boys loved it, but I didn't like the sauce so much. The recipe reminded me of meatloaf instead of Salisbury Steaks. I will probably just make meatloaf instead of this. I followed the recipe exactly.

This was good! We just bought a house and the previous owners took the bake rack in the oven with them (??)....odd....soooo that leaves me trying to make dinner using only the stovetop until we can find a replacement. This did not disappoint. Only changes I made was to increase everything by a hair because I had 2.25 pounds of lean ground beef. I would not change anything about this recipe in the future, and I will certainly be making it again. Very good for a budget-friendly quick meal. I served it with "cowboy mashed potatoes" from this site. Thanks for sharing!

SO TASTY!  We have food allergies at our house, so I omit the egg and use homemade bread crumbs.  I substitute in a little ground flaxseed mixed with hot water for the egg.  I completely omit the worcestershire due to allergies, but add in Lawry's seasoned salt, some rosemary, and thyme.  I also add in ketchup to the meat mixture.  After the meat is cooked, I use beef stock and a touch of red wine to deglaze the pan and then use the rest of the beef stock mised with flour, mustard powder, and ketchup to make the sauce.  It still tastes great to our family!

I didn't follow the recipe exactly, but combined several other reviewer's tips. 1) Used 1.5 lbs Angus beef. 2) used italian breadcrumbs. 3) omitted salt. 4) used 1/2 packet onion soup mix and 1/2 can french onion condensed soup in the meat mixture. 5) used 1/2 can french onion condensed, 1 can beefy mushroom, 1 can cream of mushroom. 6) omitted catsup. 7) lined pyrex dish with foil, added browned patties, then covered in gravy mixture. 8) covered with aluminum foil and baked at 350 for 40 minutes. 9) sauteed onion and mushrooms to go on top. 10) served over bed of rice. It was good, could have used a bit more spice in my opinion, but nice comfort food.

I rated this a 4 because I did not use the exact recipe. I took recommendations from previous reviewers and added a can of cream of mushroom as well as sauteed mushrooms to the dish. I also added a dash of cayenne for some spicy flavor. I pan cooked it slightly on both sides and then put the remainder in the casserole dish and baked on 375 for about 30 minutes. I served it with mashed potatoes.

i found the "steak" themselves were delicious.  However, both my husband and I could BARELY eat it because of how salty it was.  He actually asked me if i dumped the salt in.  I omitted the ketchup due to my son being allergic to Tomatoes so maybe that made a difference.

Excellant! My family all said they didn't like Salisbury steak, but since they were so hungry they tried it. And were they ever surprised! I followed other raters' suggestions, doubled the gravy ingredients, omitted ketchup, and added a can of mushroom soup and a package of brown gravy mix. Absolutely awesome! Will definitely be making this often.

I made this for my picky husband who loves Salisbury steak.  It was so good!  I doubled the gravy recipe, and served it over mashed potatoes.  Will be a staple recipe in our house.  He also suggested trying it as a meatloaf, in place of sloppy joes after we had left overs on buns.  A real winner!!!

This was good.  I never made salisbury steak before and my husband and son loved it.  It was fairly simple.  I did add sliced mushrooms and I didnt have mustard powder.  I placed the pattties in a pan, poured the sauce and mushrooms over the patties, covered with tin foil and baked for about 40 min at 350.  I served with garlic mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables from Trader Joe's.  I would definately  make this again.

I followed this recipe exactly as stated and I could not have been more pleased with the way it turned out! At first, I thought I would not have enough gravy to coat all my meat (I used 2 pounds of ground beef to make 6 large patties) but it ended up being the perfect amount, even though I used more ground beef! It made a delicious glaze over the patties and I even had plenty of gravy to pour over as I served. I will be making this again!! Yum!

This recipe is great, but I did tweak it also, I used onion beef gravy mix, and beef gravy mixed with a little milk, I pan fried my patties and mixed with one egg, onion and omitted the ketchup and mustard, I mixed in a packet also of the beef gravy into meat mixture with some worstishire sauce and garlic powder a little pepper and onion powder, served over white long grain ricce, with corn and rustic french bread a winner tonight!

Yummy! I followed the recipe for the meat, but listened to people and added onions and garlic to the meat mixture and a bit more spices.
For the sauce, I used the french onion soup that was left over, a can of cream of mushroom soup, and I added sauteed onions and mushrooms to it with a package of Lipton's Onion Soup...does NOT need salt if you use the Liptons. Put it on top of mashed potatoes and it was awesome.

This one has been asked for over & over again!  We use 3/4 can french onion soup in the ground sirloin mix and another can plus 1/4 for the gravy.  For the gravy -- once the soup is heated we scoop out about a cup of just the liquid and whisk with two TBSP flour until disolved, pour it back into the mix and stir to desired consitency for gravy. This is great over rice or mashed potatoes.  You can alter the flour mixture to get it to the thicknes you prefer.

Tangy and Tasty! It had that taste of the frozen kind I remember growing up, BUT so much better! I added a can of mushrooms/drained during the 20 mn. cooking. The sauce is soooo good! Thanks for sharing this fantastic recipe! It's a classic and it's a kepper!!

YUMMY!!! I rarely give a recipe 5 stars but this one deserves it. I added a can of mushroom soup like suggested, browned the steaks and the put them in the oven for an hour. Like I said before, yummy.

My family really enjoyed this recipe.  My husband loved it. Like many, I tweaked it bit to suite my taste and dietary needs.  I used half ground turkey and half lean beef, substituted oregano for the mustard spice and used a 6 ounce can of tomato paste versus ketchup when I doubled the sauce.  I appreciated being able to prepare it quickly yet still have a healthy and tasty entree.

I really liked how it came out. I'm probably the pickiest person about my own cooking. It was moist and yummy. Perfect for people who like onions and mushrooms.

I used the review by alley99 and only added golden mushroom soup instead of the french onion cause i wouldn't find it in the store.

Very Easy and Quick and best of all Family liked it. I did add the Cream of Mushroom Soup to the French Onion Soup like other reviewers suggested. Only change I would make is to double the sauce next time.

This has fast become a favorite recipe of my family.  For my son's birthday dinner, every year he usually asks for baked ziti or lasagna with meatballs.  This year, salisbury steak w/mashed potatoes.  Great, easy recipe.  Quick to make.

I really liked this recipe. I must agree with all other posters when they suggest doubling the sauce. It does not make enough by what is listed in the recipe. I made this almost exactly as listed. I didn't have the can of soup so I used beef broth and made some sauteed onions. I also added some sauteed mushrooms. Will make it again!!

Yummy!!! I did add more worcestershire sauce to meat and then added about 3tbsp to the gravy mix. I also added 1 can of condensed mushroom soup to the gravy. The meat was super tender and the gravy was awesome.

This will be a family favorite after the first time I fixed it!!  I added dry onion soup mix at the beginning and then made my own onion sauce gravy instead of the canned variety.  Diced onions, water and beef base soup mix with conrnstarch for thickening.  Nothing left for left-overs tomorrow!!

My husband has been asking for salisbury steak so I decided to give this recipe a try. I omitted the salt and added minced garlic to the meat. I followed the advice of other reviewers and added cream of mushroom soup to the gravy. I also browned the patties in a pan and finished in the oven at 375 for 30 min. The meat came out moist and flavorful but the gravy was disappointing. The french onion soup flavor was SO overpowering it almost didn't taste like gravy at all. Hubby ate it but said he wished the gravy tasted more beefy. Next time I'll just buy a can of beef gravy to put on the patties.

I'd give it five stars after following some of the suggestions of the others. I did cut down on the ketchup, only using two tbs. I also used two packs of onion soup mix, one I put directly into the meat mix and the other I used with the french onion soup mix. I did not mix the french onion soup mix with the meat however, which worked out great cause the packet of onion soup mix was just enough. The other pack of soup mix I prepared per the instructions on the pack and added a little worchester's sauce and mixed in with the rest of the sauce from the recipe...yum! my daughter doesn't eat any type of "gravy" but came back for more after this. I prepared with mixed veggies and mashed potatoes, Thank you for this recipe, with a few simple tweeks its great! ( Oh yeah, very high in sodium so I suggest you omit the salt)

Husband likes so much, much better than the creamed soup version.
I didn't mind but thought ketchup made too sweet.  I doubled all the gravy ingrediants, with the exception of the ketchup, and it was still too much.  Next time, I'd double all the gravy, but half the ketchup.

I had such high hops with all the positive reviews, but the sauce killed it for me. Not to my liking at all. I made a double batch of the "steaks" though so I'll try a simpler mushroom brown gravy next time.

This recipe was fantastic! I was a little apprehensive about making it because of some of the ingredients, but it turned out great! Everything really blended well together. My husband said it was a definite keeper....so that's good enough for me!

This is so good, my husband loves this meal!  I make it with lean ground beef and I add mushrooms, and replace beef broth for the water.  Goes great with mashed potatoes!

This was delicious!! I used half the can of the french onion soup in the meat mix.  I doubled the sauce ingredients using the other half of the french soup and a can of beef consumme soup and it came out perfect!  We served it with mashed potatoes and brown gravy.  Husband loved it too!

My husband loved this, but I think it was a bit tangy... I'm guessing because of the condensed french onion soup. Not bad overall though!

This was the first time I made salisbury steak and I have to say that it was not only the best salisbury steak I've ever had, but it was one of the best meals I've ever had!! I followed the recipe and made no changes and it was absolutely perfect.  I will definitely make this again!

I made this last night for dinner without any changes other than doubling the sauce and omitting the salt. Loved it! I didn't add onion like some of the reviews because there was so much in the soup. The sauce is so flavorful-sort of tangy. Thanks for the recipe.

The steaks were really good. However, the sauce came out a little greasy. I think it may have been my error, however, as I probably should have let them cook down a little more and drained them prior to adding the sauce. I also could have used less fatty meat. I will make this again. Thank you.

Wow! It was a crowd pleaser. Cut down on the ketchup a bit and used more cans of soup, as I knew I'd need more gravy for the mashed potatoes.  I think seasoned bread crumbs are a must.

Oh wow! This was delicious!  We use to be cheap and disgusting, and buy the Banquet Salisbury Steak Family Pack, but they are now made with Chicken, Turkey & Pork.  My husband is allergic to poultry, and I miss my Salisbury steak! This turned out AMAZING! What I did differently:
Prepared patties as directed, but used Lipton Mushroom & Onion Soup mix for the gravy. I made them on the stove top, and they turned out amazing.  My husband who IS THE HARDEST PERSON IN THE WORLD TO PLEASE WITH FOOD, gave me a thumbs up and a high five.  Needless to say, I will be making this again!

wow was this easy and turned out better than i imagined! i only gave 4 stars because i did have change a few things based on other review & my own additions.
I left out the egg, ketchup, worcestershire sauce, mustard powder, and instead of the canned soup I used the french onion soup powder mix and added finely chopped onion & garlic powder to ground beef mix.
I also used beef broth mixed with the flour to pour on top and baked in the oven like other users recommended.
It turned out amazing with the garlic mashed potatoes i also got from this website & will definaley use this recipe all the time! (my kids dont like mushrooms otherwise i would have added them)

The gravy was yummy, but my family did not care for this recipe. It was very meatloaf-like. I think I will try the gravy at some point in time on top of chopped steaks instead.

I got this exact recipe out of a Campbell's soup recipe book many years ago and my family really likes it. However, I do not make the gravy/sauce like the instructions say. I do add the remaining soup to it, but make it just like a brown gravy.

I didn't have french onion soup so I made my own beef broth from Minor's Beef Base, I also did not add the salt. I also used a can of cream of mushroom soup and a packet of beef mushroom soup in the gravy and I browned up a can of mushrooms and put them on top of the gravy.

I have made this several times for my family and it is always a favorite. Te first time I made it for my parents, mother told me it was her new favorite. I do recommend making extra sauce to top mashed potatoes with. I use regular prepared mustard rather than mustard powder.

This was pretty good, but not outstanding.  We all liked it, I might make it again sometime.  I followed the recipe exactly except I used 2.25 pounds of ground beef because that was the size of the package I had on hand.  There was plenty of sauce for gravy over mashed potatoes.

My entire family was going on and on about it, they loved it. I almost didn't have any to send with my husband the next day. My only complaint is next time I will cut down on the ketchup. I did make some of my adjustments first I used the whole can of soup in step one while mixing the meat I also added about a tblsp of garlic to mix. Then for the gravy mix I used a pack of onion soup mix made it up and then followed the rest of the directions. The meat was falling apart and plenty of gravy to go with mashed potatos.

This was wonderful! Easy and quick to make. I didn't have the 1 can of condensed soup, so I used 1 package of Onion Soup mix blended with 1 cup of water, and left out the 1/4 cup water for the sauce. Also, I added a can of cream of mushroom soup (as I read in other reviews) for more sauce! Yummy! My family loved it. This is a keeper for sure! Thanks for a great recipe!

This was  good. I had to substitute golden mushroom for French onion because French onion soup has cheese in it (milk alergy). I think it lacked the beefy flavor because of that. We all ate it up, though.

This is the ultimate comfort food. I doubled the sauce and used one can beef gravy mixed with the can of french onion soup. Served over egg noodles. A fast, easy and great tasting recipe.

okay , so  I too, hate to leave a negative rating.  But just to warn people before you  choose to try this...In my opinion, this doesn't taste like the good old fashion "brown gravy/mushroom flavored base sauce" like I have always known Salisbury  Steak to taste like.  Honestly , its the first time in years, I fed dinner to the dog, and we ordered pizza.  I was very disappointed  But there are alot of Positive ratings on it, as well.  So  just be prepared for a "different" flavor.  Maybe the canned soup just was to overpowering, leaving it with a "tart canned soup taste"....anyway, not for me.

This was delicious.  Only things I changed were added can of cream of mushroom soup, deleted the ketchup and replaced it with a packet of brown gravy mix with onion and doubled the worcestershire sauce & water.  I had absolutely no issues with the steaks falling apart, I made them ahead of time and let them set in the fridge for about an hour.  Came out perfect!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a really good solid recipe.  My husband loved it.  I read a few reviews that referred to the 'steaks' staying together as a challenge - I formed them and let them sit in the refrigerator for about an hour or more before frying them, which helped a lot.  You have to be very delicate when frying but mine stayed together perfectly.  I will definitely be making this one on a regular basis!

This recipe came out great.  I used 96% fat free beef and this recipe made it nice and moist.  I added beef  broth to the gravy and my kids put it over noodles to make a nice side dish.  It was a nice break from meat loaf, I'll definitely make it again.

This is a very good recipe. I was very pleased and would definitely make it again! Probably could use a little more water than a 1/4 cup.

this is exactly the recipe that Providence Place uses.  I will do with the addition of the Lipton soup mix and cream of mushroom.  Hope it turns out well.

I did the recipe exactly as called for and the "steaks" pretty much tasted like a hamburger. Also the gravy turned out to be a greasy mess. I think next time, I'll finish cooking the "steaks" on their own and just add the gravy to the top at the end so theres not so much grease in it. Also, I would recommend experimenting with the seasoning so they have a different taste than hamburger.

I gave 4 stars because I did have to alter the recipe after reading all of the comments.  But for the most part, this is a great recipe by itself.  My alterations were as follows:   - I only used about a tablespoon of ketchup.  - I added about 3 tablespoons of A1. - I added a teaspoon of cornstarch to thicken the sauce up a bit.   - I did not drain the excess fat before adding the sauce to the patties.  - Also, I noticed the recipe doesn't mention to reduce the heat after you cover.  You'll definitely want to reduce the heat to between medium-low and medium, otherwise you'll have overcooked meat.   It turned out AMAZING!  Hubby went back for seconds and we had the left overs for lunch the next day.  It was super easy to make and tasted great!

I made this tonight and my family loved it! I made some tweaks that others had recommended. First I made the gravy with French onion soup, Lipton onion soup and cream of mushroom gravy. I mixed them together - added about 4 cups of water then added flour and thickened it. I also added some mushrooms and onions.  I made the patties and browned them then put them into a dish, covered them with the gravy and baked them. I added only about 2 Tbls of ketchup since others said to much ketchup made it to sweet and I didn't add any mustard. It was wonderful!

I made this according to how it was written and it was not very good at all.  The sauce is just gross and has way too much ketchup in it.  The meat was edible that is why i gave it 1 star.

This was my first time making Salisbury Steak and my family really enjoyed this recipe.  I decreased the ketchup by half and used a little Dijon mustard since I didn't have dry mustard.  I also added some fresh mushrooms to the gravy. The patties were very moist and tasty.

Five stars on flavor alone, but since I feel the need to take every aspect into account, would have given a four and a half.  Simply not enough gravy if you follow the instructions as written.  Since the first time, I have doubled the gravy ingredients except for the ketchup which I left at the original 1/4 cup.

This reminded me of my mom's salisbury steak.  After it simmered, I tasted it and didn't think I would like the gravy.  So I made a package of brown gravy and put it on the side.  By the time we sat down to eat the gravy was fabulous, maybe it needed to rest a bit.  Next time I will double the gravy recipe!  No need to packaged brown gravy here!

Rating is from my husband who LOVES the Salisbury Steak in TV dinners. He says these were the BOMB! So .... if you are seeking a familiar taste and you LOVE TV dinner Salisbury Steak this is the recipe. I followed it exactly and per hubby the results were worthy of 5 stars.

SOOOO delicious!!  I double the gray and instead of using 1/4 cup water, I used beef broth!!

It comes out very juicy and the gravy is out of this world.  I am not a fan of meatloaf and I thought I wouldn't like this much, but I was SO wrong, it's fast and very easy.....my husband and 2 boys eat this up and they are PICKY eaters!

Yummy recipe.  The one thing I did different was to make the sauce separately and then pour it on the hamburgers.

I add an entire can of soup to the meat mix, and 2 cans of it to the gravy mix. I have also made this as a meatloaf, baking it whole instead of frying as patties. Either way it is wonderful!

This was very good.  I was questioning whether you reduce heat after draining fat and adding sauce.  I did turn down to 50% and then 40% after 10 mins.  I added a small can of mushrooms and it topped it off well!  Warning though, the sauce cooked down quite a bit!  And instead of stirring; which is difficult, just turn the patties over a couple times.

This is pretty good, but it's not Salisbury Steak, it's meat loaf.  As long as you go in expecting meat loaf, you won't be disappointed.

Overall this recipe wasn't too bad.  Some changes I made and some I should've made are the following.  I added a can of cream of mushroom soup for the sauce to make it a little thicker.  I watered it down just a little bit also.  However, if I were ever to remake it I would leave out the ketchup in terms of making the sauce.  I'm not the biggest fan of tomato so in retrospect I probably would've liked this recipe a lot more if I had simply left out the ketchup to begin with.  Overall a good recipe with a little tweaking.

This was absolutely DELICIOUS!  This was my first time making Salisbury Steak...and the first time I've had it where it wasn't a TV dinner. It was very easy to make and WAY tasty! The only change I made was that I added a cup of hot water mixed with a beef boullion cube and some cornstarch. Best gravy ever! Will definitely be making this again!

We had this tonight for dinner and it was delicious.  I only had cream of chicken soup and I was not going to the store after I already made it home so we improvised.  I can't wait to try it the way it was intended to be made.  For the gravy I just used a package of dry onion soup mix with water and the rest of the cream of chicken.  It was still pretty good but we're not big gravy people here.

This was wonderful with my modifications.  I made the patties as direceted excepted added some fresh chopped onions and worchester sauce.  For gravy I added some carmelized onions and mushrooms, along with lipton onion and mushroom gravy mix along with 2 cups water and some onion and garlic powder.  I browned the patties and then baked at 400 for 35 minutes, perfect!

Made this last night! It was SO good! I've never had a Salisbury Steak before. I did make some changes from reading the reviews. I added some garlic powder and Worcestershire sauce to the meat mixture. Instead of bread crumbs I used Panko, that's what I had on hand. I doubled the gravy except I only put in 1/8 cup of ketchup. I don't think it had the ketchup taste that others were complaining of. I will make this again soon!

I followed the steak part of the recipe but when I made the gravy I did not like the ketchup taste at all. So I tossed out the gravy and just browned sliced onions in the pan and made gravy from scratch. It turned out very good in the end. The steak part was very flavorful and I will use that part of the recipe again.

I gave this 4 stars just because I did a lot of tweaking. I put garlic powder and onions in the meat mixture. After browning the patties I put them in a pan and then put the gravy and mushrooms on top and covered and baked on 400 for 35 minutes. For the gravy I put crm of mushroom soup & powder onion soup in it. Next time I won't use powder onion soup but I'll use brn gravy mix and NO ketchup. The ketchup made it sweet and not appealing for me.

Excellent - so flavorful, meat is moist and tender. I accidentally put 1/2 cup of onion soup into the meat instead of 1/3 and it was still fantastic. Everyone loved it and I will be making it again very soon - thanks for a great recipe

Made this last night by request of my 3rd grader.  Of all things, he loves the cafeteria salisbury steak at his school (can you imagine!)  This turned out well and he gave it 2 thumbs up.  My only complaint was I felt it was a little too salty and next time will be leaving out any salt altogether.

I made this for dinner tonight.  Used all the ingredients except for prepared mustard (no dry), cut back on the ketchup (1 tsp) and added a can of mushroom condensed soup.  Everyone really enjoyed it.  I would add more flavour to the meat next time - the gravy was delicious, the texture really good (so splitting problems though I did add extra breadcrumbs - Italian).  After removing from pan I added some water to the pan as the gravy was thick.  The sauce was amazing - everyone loved it, just wanted some garlic and spices added to the meat next time - maybe a touch of hot sauce.  Otherwise it was a really good, easy meal after work.

It was very tasty, but I did follow the recipe alterations that ALLY99 suggested.  Very yummy and different.  I served it with mashed potatoes and a green veggie.

This recipe was not bad, but did not have anything distinct about it. If I try this again, i will try and amp the flavor up a notch and definitely use less ketchup for the gravy. Not what I expected...

Very tasty salisbury steak recipe. This my first time having salisbury steak and it was sooo good! My husband loved it too. I took pervious users advice and didn't make the gravy though, it didn't sound very appealing. i made a gravy from 1 can cream of mushroom, half a packect of french onion soup mix, the left over french onion can soup, a dash of wishertire and a 1/2 cup of water. it was a very oniony gravy but yummy all the gravy went so fast we didn't have enough for the left over steaks so next time i will double. All around good meal. and yes my steaks fell apart a little but we didn't care cause we loved the tenderness and saved us the time chopping it up and mixing with mash potatos.lol

My family likes this recipe.  However, the first time I made it there was hardly any gravy - it all cooked away.  When I made it again I increased the soup that you mix with the meat to 1/2 cup.  Then I used about 1 to 1 1/2 cups of soup for the sauce.

Yum,  Yum, Yum.  I found this recipe over 20 years ago and it's still a must have in our house.  I also make additional sauce to satisfy the boys, but I have two changes.  One, I use 1 tsp of regular mustard instead of dry and two, we serve it over egg noodles.  Either way, it's delicious and definitely a keeper!

I couldnt get the salisbury steaks to stick together also I think that you could probably cut back on the worchshire sause a bit.

This was so easy and soooo yummy!  Even my 5 year old wanted more.  I think this is the best Salisbury Steak I have ever eaten.  I did not change anything except to add a small jar of sliced mushrooms, drained.  It would have been great without them though.  Definite KEEPER!

The first time I tried this recipe I could not find French Onion  soup at the store I shop at. So, I substituted Onion soup mix. I prepared the dry soup as directed and added it to the mix. It was O.K. but not something I would make often.   Then when I stopped at another store and found the French  Onion I decided to try it again.   Oh WOW!!! I could eat this every night.  So do not sub with this recipe. It was great!!!

As is this was good, we didn't like the ketchup and not enough gravy at the end.  But it is easy to modify to make it great for your own tastes. I added brown gravy mix and 1 cup water to the final gravy instead and we loved it.  I also used 1/2 ground beef and 1/2 ground turkey for the meat and it was just as good. This is a keeper for my family.

Dee-lish! My hubby told me to make sure keep this recipe. I did change it up just a hair: I didn't have the onion soup, so I grated 1/2 an onion into the meat mixture and made my own beef stock using soup base.The gravy from this is so good, it is now my new beef gravy recipe. Way to go Kelly!!

The family loved this, but because the gravy ingredients didn't look very appealing, I used Serena's advice and made gravy with dry mushroom-onion soup mix.  This will go into the regular rotation.

We really liked this. I took others' advice and doubled the gravy recipe and so glad I did. I baked it in the oven after browning. I also added a a packet of brown gravy mix. I forgot the Worcestershire sauce, but don't know if that made any difference. The only complaint I have is that there was quite a bit of grease in the gravy. I will probably choose leaner ground beef next time.

I read the reviews and doubled the sauce (all except the ketchup), added the can of cream of mushroom soup, and a packet of dry onion soup mix and extra spices (garlic, seasoning salt, etc).  I also browned the patties on the stove and then cooked them in the oven for 40 min on 350.  My husband and father LOVED the recipe! You will need to double the gravy.  There is just enough with it doubled.

This was great. Neither my husband or I had ever had salisbury steak, but we like it. Made it exactly as the recipe was written, except I added four or five sliced mushrooms with the sauce. Wish there was more sauce but I'm not sure how to increase it without actually doubling it.

I made this a few times with just a little tweaking. I made the ground beef mixture as written, but then I just took 2 packs of dry brown gravy mix and made as directed and added the rest of the onion soup to it. I then poured it over the browned hamburger patties and baked for 40 minutes at 350. My family loves this recipe.

My father-in-law was coming over and I was looking for a classic old time meal to make for him. This fit the bill!It was great and he loved it. I did make extra gravy to have for the potatoes. Thank you for this yummy recipe I will make it again with or without my father-in-law visiting.

This recipe was REALLY good! I to made some changes. Omitted the ketchup and used a can of cream of mushroom soup. Added sauteed mushrooms and onions to the gravy. The patties were moist and flavorful. This recipe is a definite keeper.

This was a really good recipe I had never tried making Salisbury Steak before. I think I may add a little sage next time and make smaller pattys. I like that I usually have eveything to make this already on hand.

I followed the recipe exactly as described and it turned out great.  My wife and I really liked it and it was pretty easy to make.  We used lean ground beef (93%) and the patties turned out very tender.  After browning the patties, there was hardly any excess fat in the pan that needed to be drained off so we didn’t.  Homemade mashed potatoes went well with this meal but I guess that’s a no brainer.  The buttered corn worked nicely too.  The ingredients of any recipe can be altered or tweaked to individual preference or taste which I might consider doing at some point with this recipe for the sake of experimentation but, for the record, this recipe is perfectly fine as written.  I know we’ll be making it again before long.

Alterations I've made that make it a 5 star (this is for 3lbs of ground beef):  One packet of onion soup mix, generous grind of pepper, some garlic powder to taste, one tbs of worch., and seasoned bread crumbs for the meat mixture.  Au Jus gravy mix, thickened with flour, for the gravy.  Browned the steaks, then poured the gravy over them, 350deg covered for 45 mins.  Fantastic!

These are really good.I did do some changes added sliced mushroom fresh or canned at the very end of cooking.Also added a jar of gravy at the end if you really like gravy and we do in this house for a little extra. And also 2 segments of fresh garlic too. Very good dinner in this house.

I loved this recipe, and so did my husband!   I only did a few things different, per other's reviews.  I added 1/2 of a chopped white onion and 1 clove of garlic to the meat mixture.  Also, I added 1 can of Cream of Mushroom soup and 1 packet of dry onion soup mix to the sauce mixture and I elimnated the salt all around since the soups have more than enough salt to go around!   I added water to thin the sauce out a bit, and also to dillute it since it was a little on the salty side. I doubled the amount of sauce, to accomodate for my mashed potatoes!   Also, I seared the patties on the stovetop before transfering them to a foil lined casserole dish and baked them at 400 degrees for 50 minutes (I like my meat WELL done!) - they turned out PERFECTLY - juicy and tender, not dry or rough at all!  Thanks for a GREAT recipe!

This was good, but the mustard powder and catsup gave it a taste I didn't care for.  Otherwise, the meat had good flavor and was tender and yummy.

This was really yummy. I doubled the sauce so we would have some for mashed taters. I pulled the patties out of the pan drained the excess fat then stirred in the gravy with the lovely little bits on the bottom of the pan then returned the patties and simmered. The gravy was much better tasting after it simmered with the meat. The patties were nice and tender! I will be making this one again for sure.

This was a huge hit with my family.  I doubled the sauce as others did.  I didn't have a can of onion soup so used beef broth and cooked some onions in butter and put them in.  It was absolutely delicious.  Will be making this one again.  Thanks for sharing Kelly.

These are very good.  My 4 year old and 2 year old both eat very well when we have these, and it is hard to get them to eat well usually.  I made them just like the recipe says and I think they make a great meal and are easy to make.

This recipe was excellent.  I base my rating not only by how a dish tastes, but also how easy it is to make.  As a mom of 3, time is critical. The only substitution I made was I used a can of condensed beef broth instead of the french onion soup since I don't really care for onions in the first place, but mainly because I didn't have a can of the soup available. I also sauteed a small can of button mushrooms and added those to the grave. Really tasty dish...great recipe!!!

The patties come out great.  I had no problems with them falling apart.  The key is to only turn them once.  The sauce I will work on the next time I make it though.  The ketchup was a little weird for us so I may just cut it back next time as the sauce looked more red than brown.  Overall a good recipe though.  Will be making it again.

Tender but TERRIBLE flavor.  The French Onion soup tated so very artificial.  It tastes NOTHING like any salisbury steak that we have ever had.

Ok.  Were really thick dense patties.  Maybe make 1 or 2 more patties to reduce overall thickness.

I agree that the sauce wasn't so great....almost bitter tasting.  I think next time I'll just make some gravy from a rioux and extra french onion soup.  I also feel like the meat needs a little something more so that it doesn't just taste like a hamburger.

I've never had salisbury steak that wasn't from a frozen dinner. It was SO GOOD!! The only thing I did different was double the sauce like others recommended and added sauted mushrooms.  I can't imagine it without the mushrooms, it really added to the recipe.  Next time I might reduce the amound of ketchup.  But as is, it was still an awesome recipe.  I will DEFINITLY make it often.  Thanks for sharing!

We all started out really liking this but toward the end of the meal one of my boys said the sauce started tasting funky and we all kind of agreed. I used Campbells soup which we usually like.  It was very easy to make, just wasn't quite for us.  Thanks anyway!

Followed directions exactly and thought it was great.  I would double the sauce next time though.

WOW is all I can say!  This is the greatest salisbury steak ever made!  I've made it 3x now and we love it!  I just remebered, that I never 'rated' it!  Well, now that it's 11pm here and I just heated up the leftovers for a 'snack' I thought I'd just tell you I LOVE IT!!!!! The only 'change' I made was to double the sauce, so I'd have enough for all the mashed potatoes, other than that, leave it alone!  Thanx!

I've made this multiple times and it's a family favorite. The only change I've made is to add a second can of soup when simmering to have extra gravy.

I guess we just didn't care for it.  And one note:  there was not NEARLY enough of the "gravy" - you could double THAT part of the recipe and be fine.

My BF requested Salisbury steak & I was extremely skeptical but after all the ratings and reviews I'm NOW A FAN!  I did a lot of tweaking, but believe it would be great as is.  I didn't use ketchup wanting to avoid the sugar and used organic tomato sauce instead.  I used 2 cans of roasted garlic cream of mushroom with the dry french onion soup packet.  My BF now regularly requests this.  Great with mashed potatoes or rice & green beans or asparagus.

This was a crowd pleaser.  I served it with white rice and peas.  I did increase the gravy so we could douse our rice in it.    Aside from my patties crumbling a bit, it was great.  I did add chopped onions.  Will add mushrooms next time to the gravy.    Thanks so much for the recipe.  It's a keeper!

Wonderful recipe.  After taste-testing, I added about 2 Tbsp of honey to the sauce!  It turned out great!!  My 6 member family left NOTHING behind!!!  I will use this from now on!! Thank you for a wonderfully easy recipe for a dish I've been struggling with for a few years.

It's been a long time since I've had Salisbury Steak, and I most certainly did not make it myself, it was a crummy frozen one.  I followed the recipe as written.  It  was easy to make, had relatively normal ingredients, and turned out nicely.  Much better than the faint memory I have of that gnarly frozen salisbury steak from so many years ago.  There's no going back to frozen after this-thanks for sharing!

This recipe was very good.  The meat was seasoned perfectly, awesome flavor. The only thing I changed was I added some mushrooms to the gravy.  My husband loved it.

Very good.  I used some of the other ideas.... added fresh mushrooms to the gravy and put it in the oven.  I also spiced up the gravy a little with garlic salt and pepper and Mrs. Dash.  To die for.  My hubby loved it and so did my kid!  And they are hard to impress.  Thanks for the keeper :)

Had to give it a 4 star, my patties fell apart, I read some others did also, but flavor was nice, I just ended up using it as a hamburger over mashed potoatoes as my mother did when we were kids just didnt taste the same. I will try again someday.

oh, I am so sorry to give this recipe a so so review. I thought this was one I used before, but it wasn't.  Just ok for us, meat really didn't have much flavor and way too much ketchup in the sauce.  I ate half a serving, and the boys (3 teenage boys and my husband) ate what I served but said they preferred I do not serve it again.

Oh. My. Goodness. I have made this several times and have only made one change: add more water and increase a tad the other seasonings. If you make it the way the original recipe states, you don't get enough "gravy." This is by far my favorite find so far.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I did follow the suggestions of the other members and add a can of cream of mushroom soup.  There was a little too much ketchup for my taste so I'm sure next time i will cut a little bit of it out.  I also added a little more french onion soup to the sauce.  It was definetly a hit!

This receipe is easy to make and has great flavor. My son proclaimed that although he is not a fan of salisbury steak, this was excellent. I served with mashed potatos and the sauce made an excellent gravy. I didn't change a thing. Thanks for sharing.

Very good home tasting recipe.  I added 1 1/2 teaspoons of Montreal Steak Seasoning and omitted the salt and pepper.  The steak seasoning adds a few additional spices giving the beef a more robust flavor.  The soup gravey is key so do not omit.

This was great and easy! The only differences I made were due to what I had on hand. I only used 1lb of hamburger but used the given measurements for everything else, I used saltines instead of breadcrumbs and I just used a squirt of yellow mustard instead of mustard powder. My BF, who is unbelievably picky, LOVED it! HE even said that I should make more sauce next time and use it for gravy over mashed potatoes! It was great! We had it with cheesy mashed potatoes and green beans.  Another note, I had absolutely no problem with these falling apart. They stuck together beautifully! Maybe it was the egg to meat ratio?

Simply put, amazing.  I tried this for dinner tonight, and though I expected it to turn out good with a 4.5 star rating, I don't think I had planned on it turning out so delicious.  Very well seasoned, and perfectly moist.  I made mine with extra chopped onions in the gravy, mashed potatoes and peas, put the potatoes and meat in a baking dish to cook and let the broiler lightly brown the tops of the potatoes.  Excellent dinner that my whole family loved.

I have made these steaks 3-4 times now and they just keep getting better and better.  My husband just loves them!  My 3 year old likes them as well.  I did take the advice of some of the other reviews and use the onion soup mix and cream of mushroom soup for the gravy.  I also brown them on the stovetop before cooking them in the oven.  Yummy!

Amazing! These are so good they are now in weekly rotation in our house. After frying them on the stove, I smother them in the gravy and bake them, covered in the oven for 20 minutes. They come out very moist and mouth-watering. They practically fall apart in your mouth and that is exactly how salisbury steak should be. I did make a few changes based on what I had on hand. I used cream of mushroom soup instead of french onion and I cut out the onions themselves. I recommend doubling the gravy recipe so that you can put it on mashed potatoes as well. Great recipe.

My family loves this recipe.  I double the batch for the ground beef to use up a whole can of soup, then flash freeze the "steaks" for future use.  And I always double the sauce, it's great with mashed potatoes.

It was good, but not great. Used an onion soup mix (1 TBSP in steak, remainder in sauce), for not having condensed version on hand, and used cream of mushroom soup. Omitted ketchup altogether, doubled sauce recipe as recommended, & cooked in oven (pour over steaks, at 400*, 30 min). Sauce came out very thick (paste almost?), and I was expecting more like gravy, so I'll add more water for my kind of consistency (maybe evaporated in oven?). Husband's first words were, "Oh my.." in a not so good sort of way. I think it was salt content from using onion soup mix.

This was extremely easy and tasty. There wasn't enough gravy for all the steaks, so I just cooked one without the gravy. The steak tasted better without the gravy! Paired with mashed potatoes and it was yummy. Oh, next time I will leave out the salt!

Wow. Terribly simple, but so good! As others said, use Onion Soup Mix rather than soup itself. If you're just judging by feel like I do, get the meat mixture to feel like a meatloaf mix - not too watery. When you pan fry, just let them sit and brown, don't mess with them until you're ready to flip, and they wont' fall apart. I also used the soup mix for the gravy - excellent. Just for kicks I sauted some onion slivers to add as a garnish on top. Still getting requests from the picky eater in my house to make it again! Great recipe. Thanks!

This came surprisingly  well, only because i wasn't a big fan of adding the ketchup but hubby said, "Please do," he's not a fan of the mushroom soup i added, and i did add the lipton onion soup to the meat.  I cooked it in the oven as suggested for 30 min at 400 and once again, everyone agreed it was good and ate it all! Yeah!

I liked this but the kids were a little creeped out by a meat patty on their plate. They have never had Salisbury steak before and they were expecting a "steak".  No, they don't serve it in school cafeteria's in our area anymore so the kids are missing out on a classic.

Yummy! Normally my family gets very nervous when I try new things (I've made some bad dishes in the past). This was a hit! The meat was tender, the gravy was fabulous, and everyone was happy with the final product. I did add a can of Cream of Mushroom and I think I'll double the French Onion soup next time. Thanks for a new family favorite!

My husband is a salisbury steak fanatic, so I thought that I would give this recipe a try.  And to my surprise, it turned out really good and tasty!  As others mentioned, I browned the patties in a skillet and then transferred them into a baking dish and put them in the oven for the remainder of the time (I didn't have a skillet big enough to fit them all on the stovetop).  I thought that the gravy was rather tasty too, but my husband added even more ketchup!

SOOO good. Especially with some homemade cheesy macaroni. I made a few changes and also did the suggetions of others. First, when making the gravy i used a seperate pot and did it on the stove and instead of water I used beef broth, added can of cream mushroom and about 1/4 cup of the grease from the patties... It was apsolutly AMAZING gravy. Then in the patties, I substituded the flour with brown gravy mix. Added one clove garlic, about 1/4 cup finley chopped onion to the burger.

As writen, this recipe is a 3.  I messed with it a little bit, and now would rate it a 4 or 5 with the modifications.  I use cream of mushroom soup instead of the french onion that the recipe calls for.  I also add half a package of onion soup mix to the meat mixture, and the other half of the package to the gravy mixture.  After the meat simmers for 20 minutes, I remove the meat from the pan, and add 1/2 cup milk and let it thicken.  Then, I add some sauteed onion to the gravy, and pour it all on the meat and serve!  Wonderful!

This was a family hit! It was easy and my husband and kids LOVED it. They were fighting to see who was going to get to scrape the dish to get the last of the gravy.
I modified it a bit to fit what I had in the cupboard... I used a can of Campbells Select French Onion Soup and a can of their condensed Cream of Mushroom. I alos browned the patties and then baked them at 350 with the gravy on them, for about 45 minutes. 
I will definatly use this recipe again, it is wonderful!

Everyone in my family loved this! With 4 kids that is VERY hard to accomplish! However, I will definitely double the gravy next time as it did not nearly have enough for the steak and nothing for the potatoes.

The sauce was pretty awful.  WAY too sweet for us.  I made the recipe exactly as is except doubling the sauce (and keeping the ketchup as it was)...  I think next time I'm going to make a sauce out of 1 jar of beef gravy and 1 packet of "beefy onion" soup mix.  Great cooking method, good "steak"..  sauce needs major improvement.  Sorry.

MUST READ!!! I GIVE THE STEAKS THEMSELVES A 5...They were moist, tender and simply delicious. Hiowever, either make your own skillet gravy with leftover oil drippings (like I did second time) or buy it canned. Also, patties are very greasy so drain and even blot with paper towels. After browning in skillet, I poured gravy over them and baked them in oven instead of finishing them off in pan. These were great!

This is pretty good but next time I will DEFINITELY omit the salt and reduce the ketcup- too salty and tomato-ey for my taste. Maybe I will omit the ketchup all together and use a can of cream of mushroom soup as others have added.

I made this for a small family get together.  Everyone LOVED it.  I followed the suggestion to make the gravy with french onion soup, cream of mushroom soup and dry onion soup mix.  We also doubled the gravy to have some fro the mashed potatoes.

Everyone loved this.  haha, I made a bit extra, so by the end of the meal my husband had eaten a pound of meat.  I know it isn't fair to rate a recipe based on modifications, but I gave this a 5 based on the suggestions of others.  I doubled every ingredient in the sauce except for the ketchup, and I addded a can of cream of mushroom soup with garlic.  I used Italian style bread crumbs in the patties, and I added a handful of diced onions.  After browning the patties, I placed them in a foil-lined casserole dish and baked at 375 for 45 minutes with the gravy spooned on top about halfway through.  The result was really yummy... even to the fine taste-buds of the picky little brother.

This was delicious.  I used some other's advice and omitted the ketchup.  I used dry onion soup mix, made according to package directions (I added beef boullion while simmering).  I made the gravy with the rest of soup and 1/4 c. flour and doubled the other ingredients.  The family loved this!

As my first experience with Salisbury Steak I enjoyed this recipe. I thought that the meat was moist and tender and had just the right amount of seasoning with out being overpowering. I did sautee fresh mushrooms prior to adding the gravy ingredients to the pan(personal preference) but otherwise I followed the recipe. It is a great meal especially if you want a flavorful and delicious meal that cooks up in no time.

I didn't care for this recipe. I left out the ketchup and added more bread crumbs like some users suggested but it still wasn't that good. When I think of salisbury steak I think of a gravy that is thick and a beef kind of flavor. Sorry but thanks for the recipe anyway.

Very very good recipe! I've never had Salisbury steak homemade, just the TV dinners. So much better making it yourself. I made some changes to the recipe.... I used a beefy dry onion soup mix and mixed it with 1 1/3 cup hot water. I used about a TB of ketchup, also instead of flour I used about 2 TB of cornstarch. Also made and onion and mushroom mixture for ontop.

To say the least, I'm VERY dissapointed with this recipe. I think I would have perferred my family recipe of: Beef Patties with brown gravy and mushrooms over the top. It would be more tasty. This didn't taste anything like the salisbury steak you invision when cooking it.

It's a keeper. The whole family enjoyed this recipe. I made a few changes. I mixed the meat with the bread crumbs,egg, pepper and a dash of Worcestershire.  I browned the burgers real quick.  I mixed one can of cream of mushroom soup and what I thought was french onion, but later noticed was beefy mushroom soup..must have grabbed it by mistake. Put the browned burgers in a baking dish, poured the soup mixture over the top and cooked at 400 for 20 min. It was good...not too much not too little.  Will make again. And try a few changes to see if I can make it even better.

My family really liked the steak part of the recipe, but the gravy wasn't exactly to our taste.  We felt like the mustard powder was too strong.  If I make this again, I think I'll use a different brown gravy recipe.

I make this all of the time and just realized (when I recommended it to my sister) that I've never rated it!  The first time I made this, I made it as is and we didn't care for it...that's why the 3 stars.  However, now I always make it without the ketchup.  It's great!  I usually either double or triple the sauce amounts because we like gravy!  Without the ketchup, this is a real keeper!

I was never a fan of Salisbury Steak, but I really liked this. It was nice and moist and the gravy was delicious. I didn't change anything except I added some extra onions in the skillet while the patties were cooking. Goes great with garlic mashed potatoes.

The is one great recipe!  My husband (who ate two steaks that night!!) went out and bought a case of French Onion Soup so there would never be an excuse to not make it!  My son went crazy over and and took the recipe back to school with him.  I would definately make this again and again!

My kids loved it.  We have the hardest time trying to get my youngest son to eat meat and tonight he ate seconds!  Thanks for the recipe!  Oh and definitely make double the gravy.

Great base recipe to play with. I like to use ground turkey and make the sauce using one can cream of mushroom soup, one can beef broth, two tbsp. ketchup, minced garlic, pepper, and ground mustard. So fantastic with mashed potatoes, and WAY better than ANY frozen meal version--which is the only way I'd had Salisbury Steak prior to this recipe. Never Again!! This also comes together really fast, adding even more to the allure.

This was my first attempt at salisbury steak.  All my husband could say while eatting it, DELIOUS!!  I followed Ally99 suggestions.  The meat came out tender - very good flavor.  This recipe is a keeper.  I'll definately be making this one again.

YUM!  These were great and so easy to make.  I had a very delicious dinner with all the trimmings in less than an hour.  I'm not a big condensed soup fan, so I could taste the soup flavor, but it wasn't THAT bad.  Also, my bf said "where's the mushrooms?"  Next time I will add mushrooms. Easy and tastes great, you can't go wrong there!

I rated this 4 because in order to make it 5 stars I had to make the changes suggested by ALLY99 along with adding chopped onions to the burger.  I did not use the worchestershire because my husband does not like it, but by adding the mushroom and onion soups it was not missed.  This is the only way I make salisbury steak now and we have it at least once a month. Thanks for the recipe TammyLynn!!

This is a very tasty recipe.  I also doubled the gravy ingredients except the ketchup and added a can of cream of mushroom soup.  Also used seasoned bread crumbs.  Delicious, even my picky 4-year old asked for seconds!!

I haven't had Salisbury Steak in years, I always hated it as a kid.  After trying this recipe, I have no idea why.  I made this according to ALLY99's suggestions and served it with mashed potatoes and corn. It came out great. I omitted the fresh mushrooms because I didn't have any though.  The only thing I didn't like is the leftover's didn't taste so good.  The patties came out a little tough after reheating them in the microwave, but they were so tender right out of the oven the night before.  I will definitely be making this again.

Great Recipe! My husband loved it. I took some of the advice: I used seasoned bread crumbs for a good meat flavor, I used less of ketchup then what it called for and also, I made 4 patties with the sauce for 6  to use on baked potatoes!

I thought the sauce would be a bit too tangy for the kids but they loved them!  And these kids are salisbury steak fanatics.  They said it was better than the frozen junk I had been feeding them.  Ha!

Oh man, THESE WERE GREAT!  I made them exactly how the recipe instructed and they were soooo flavorful.  Tastes just like Banquet Salisbury Steak family meals...even the sauce!  The only thing I'd suggest is doubling the gravy and maybe heat it up separately from the steaks to pour over when serving.  I didn't have hardly anything left (sauce-wise) because it was all burnt on the bottom of my skillet!  That was the only problem I had with this recipe; scraping off the very thick burnt layer of hamburger mix & sauce when cleaning up.  As you can imagine, that wasn't very fun!  So I would HIGHLY suggest baking them in the oven!!!!!  I will not be making this recipe again unless I bake them.  They might not be as good but I guess we'll see...

As much as I hate to admit this, my significant other LOVES those Banquet frozen salisbury steak dinners!  I made this for him and the boys last night and voila!  Tastes JUST LIKE IT!  It's the gravy that does it.  I only put about 2.5 TBS of ketchup in though - otherwise, too overpowering.  I also strained the onions from french onion soup - boys don't like onions (the things I have to go thru!).  Thumbs up.  This is great and was very easy and quick to make.  Made with mashed pots, poured gravy over that and corn.  Boys made a KFC pie out of it (steak topped with potatoes, corn, then gravy) and loved it.  A keeper!

Obviously the person who took the featured photo did not use this recipe.  This was just ok for me, I think it was the ketchup that threw me off.  I was looking for something with a little more of a brown gravy type of sauce.  I think I'll keep looking.

Followed the recipe as is and the sauce tasted more like meatloaf/sweet and sour meat balls probably because of the ketchup.

My husband is a Salisbury Steak fan, and asked me to try my hand at making it from scratch.  Impressed by positive reviews, I gave it a whirl.  The result?  YUM!!!  The only reason I gave this recipe four stars instead of five was that after doubling the recipe for our large family, the amount of ketchup was a bit too much for the taste buds.  The texture of the Salisbury Steak was absolutely perfect (I mixed up the meat and seasonings about six hours before dinner to let the flavors mingle together) and the gravy, aside from an extra bit of tang from the ketchup, was absolutely perfect.  I didn't have any problems with the meat patties falling apart whatsoever....it truly was a wonderful dinner, and something everybody's asking me to make again.  Good thing I made enough for leftovers tonight!

Based on the recipe exactly as stated it has way too much ketchup for my taste.  I decreased the last several times I have made this to only a couple of tablespoons ketchup and it was definately a five star recipe!

I found this recipe in the "All Recipies 30 mins to Cook" book a few years ago, I make LOVE it and make it every few months when I can convince the family not to eat burgers. I think the only thing I do differently is make more sauce. I am actually pulling in all of my favorite recipies to make my own All Recipes Cook Book, and this is the first one I am adding!!!

This was a pretty good recipe, but I made some changes. When making the steak, I place the ground beef into a lg bowl and needing in about 4 slices of bread (cubed), 1 packet of Lipton cream of mushroom soup, 1 egg, and flour,and when needing it I added a little amount of water at a time. This made the bread blend in well with the meat, and instead of browning on both sides, I placed them in a lg skillet that was filled about 1/4 full of water and browned them that way not letting the pan dry out, added sliced onions, can mushrooms, 1 bf bullion cube (had no french onion on hand), made home made mashed potatoes and corn. It was very good. I have added this meal to my menu for my next months dinners, thanks for sharing.

Fantastic. This was a great hit, my family loved this. My two year old who is fussy ate it in record time. I only changed the ketchup to steak sauce as I had no ketchup and still was great. Double the gravy as is is yummy. I also could not buy french onion soup in a can in Australia so I made it up thick from the packet, Treat yourself to a great recipe, a real sure winner.

I've never made salisbury steak before, so I wasn't sure exactly what to expect, but I loved this, and so did my husband! I used seasoned bread crumbs instead of plain(all I had) and then with the gravy, I had to put the soup in the blender to make it smooth. Hubby would've picked through the onion pieces otherwise. To make sure I had enough gravy, I added about 2/3 c. water and a beef boulion cube. This is certainly a make again recipe!

Loved this!  I took away ne start because I could have done without the gravy.  It did not make much at all and I will just add my own gravy next time.  LOVED the meat though.  My husband loved this too!

My husband really liked this recipe. It is good comfort food after a long day at work and quick to make if you don't have much time. I thought the ketchup taste was a little strong, but, he liked it as is. If you plan on serving it with mashed potatoes - you definitely need to double the "gravy" recipe so you have enough.

Simple and with fantastic taste.  Used a full 2 pounds of meat, omitted the mustard powder (didn't have any) and didn't feel the flavor was lacking because of it.  I left it on the stove far longer than called for, because the family was late getting home for dinner, but the steaks didn't suffer at all.  They were still tender, juicy and had great flavor.  They remind me a lot of the meatloaf I make, except they cook up in a fraction of the time!  I'll make these again for sure. **Update** I made these as meatballs for a party, and they were just as amazing as the steaks!  Browned the meatballs in a skillet, then put them in a dish, poured the sauce over and baked them till done.  Excellent!

Salisbury steak with a kick. This is a different flavor than usual plain brown gravy. Both my son and husband devoured this dish and had seconds. The meat had a meatloaf texture which I didn't care for, but it was a hit with the family. I needed more gravy, so I added a can of beef broth and thickened it with cornstarch.

Very good, nice consistency & great sauce.  I made extra sauce like the other reviewers (more soup + flour).  I also used crushed tomatoes instead of ketchup because we like the taste better.

I read the other reviews that this recipe was not authentic and tasted too much like Ketchup.  I don't know what an authentic recipe would taste like, but I know that everyone in my family ate this right up, I served with mashed potatoes and garlic beans/carrots.  I would say if you are concerned about the ketchup taste use a tomato vadalia onion salad dressing or add a can of mushroom soup, but not the regular creamed kind, try the golden one!  It is a very good idea to omit the salt no matter what.  I browned both sides of the patties on the stove with just about 1/2 tsp of olive oil (I use really lean meat), then I put it in a glazed clay 9x13 baking dish, poured the sauce over and baked it at 300 for ? until I was ready to eat, probably 1 - 1 1/2 hours.  It held together, was moist and thoroughly cooked.

I'm giving this 5 stars because of MY adjustments on it and how it turned out. I read other reviews and after seeing the recipe I decided to use my own judgment and taste buds. 1st I added to the meat mixture 1/2 small onion minced, and 1 clove garlic minced, upped the bread crumbs a bit to 3/4 cup sprinkled with garlic and onion powders, salt and pepper. For the sauce, I used french onion soup and golden mushroom soup...minus the 1/3 cup french onion for the meat mixture. I added 1/3 can of water and 1/3 cup of 1/2 and 1/2 cream to the sauce as well. It was outstanding! Tasted like salisbury steak shouldI have never tasted a salisbury steak with ketchup in it...save that for meatloaf! try my version and I am sure you'll love it..I have 2 very picky children who usually turn their noses up to anything but hamburgers and mac and cheese and they kept saying "mom this is really good!" I will definitely make MY version again! My ex husband stopped by and ate with us and even HE said this was "awesome"...and you know how hard it can be to get a compliment out of an ex! LOL

I just made this for the second time.  The first time it needed a little more gravy.  So I changed the serving size to 4 and only used pound of meat.  But I kept the gravy the same.  This time it was perfect.  It is so quick and easy and my family loves it!

This is just absolutely great! I have a very picky family and everyone loved it. The steaks did not crumbled when I browned them and you do not need to add any other seasonings. I put them in the oven at 325 degreees for 25 min. The sauce is excellent (I added the mushroom soup and mushroom pieces that Ally99 recommended). The recipe is great!

My family loved this. I was a little concerned because when I mixing the sauce ingredients the smell was kind of nauseating. I thought for sure I had wasted my time and money but it came out great. My husband said this is something I need to make often and my father said he was ready to have it again for Sunday dinner.

I took this basic recipe and adapted it to what I had in my pantry.  I started with fresh sauteed mushrooms and an envelope of onion soup mix en leu of the can of soup and 1 c water.  I spooned off 1/2 of liquid after gravy had simmered and added it to beef mixture before forming pattys.  I then added 1 c milk and flour to finish gravy sauce.  I also used crushed goldfish crackers instead of bread crumbs.  Best dish I've made according to hubby and kids!  Will be a family staple!

This was very good and tasty! My only change would be to DOUBLE the sauce because it is so yummy. Itw as a little salty so next time I will add a bit more water to the sauce. The meat was so tender and flavorful. I was surprised at how good it came out. I will def be making again!!

I have been visiting this website for quite a while and have goten some good recipes and some not so good ones. I actually registered today just so I could leave this review. This was absolutely HORRIBLE! I can't even pinpoint exactly what made it so bad! I think it was a combination of many. I will definitely NOT be preparing this again.

I wish I had read the reviews more than just the first few. The meat was looking great (I added parsley flakes for color) but as soon as I made the sauce in the bowl I knew this was not gonna be good. The smell of ketchup was so overpowering. Took a taste and sure enough. It tasted like brown watery ketchup. Too bad cause you can't take it out once it's in. I added a can of Cream of Mushroom hoping this would help. It was a little better. It's still cooking but I give it bad ratings when it comes to the original recipe.

Absolutely the Best Salisbury Steak recipe ever! My husband loves this because there isn't any tomato products used to make this recipe. Leftovers keep well and this tastes good with buttered noodles or mashed potatoes.

This was very yummy!  Smelled so good while cooked.  I can see why some have chosen to double the sauce, but it was still very good.  I also think the addition of mushroom would be fantastic!

Yummy!  I had some leftover sauted onions and mushrooms so I added them.  I loved the flavor and the gravy which was good over mashed potatoes:)  Thanks for sharing.  Will be making again!

These were okay, but nothing spectacular. My husband said they tasted a lot like meatloaf, but that he would've rather had a meatloaf! I liked the fact that the recipe didn't call for mushrooms since they are very unpopular at my house. I probably won't make this again.

Really good, even my picky teen daughter liked it.  I did some changes, I added 1/4 cup of cream of mushroom soup to the meat mixture along with a packet of onion soup mix too.  To the gravy , I added about 1/2 cup red wine and sliced fresh mushrooms.  After the meat had simmered on the stove, I added 1/4 cup of sour cream.  Definitely a keeper.

This meal was delicious! I give the recipe 4 stars because I made some modifications that I think truly made the meal. I used less ketchup in the sauce and a package of lipton beefy onion soup mix  with the meat. I also seasoned the patties before browning them. Lastly, I cooked the steaks and gravy mixture for 30 minutes at 350 instead of on the stove (just for convenience). The seasoning of the patties was delicious and the gravy was very good. Next time I will use much less ground beef. I had about 12 regular serving size patties --more then enough for 2 people.

ADD: I cooked this on the stove finally and it is just as good and easy (but arguably more greasy).

Really good, I doubled the sauce so that the meat would stay more tender, and have some to flavor the rice we served with it.

Husband loved it and was still talking about it the next day.  I would turn the heat down to low-medium or medium as the beef burned a little on the bottom.  I really enjoyed it myself so I say 5 stars and definitely a keeper.  Thanks.

This is easy to put together, and it was good. The sauce, just wasn't what I prefer. Just a little too much, with the worcestershire, and the mustard powder.

Very easy recipe! I personally give this a 5 star, however, my son and Hubby voted it a 3 star, so I compromised and ended with a 4 rating.  Very rich flavor to sauce, which I did double as suggested for serving over mashed potatoes.  I used one can of the french onion soup and added a can of Cr. of Mushroom soup.  I did cut back on the ketchup to 1/4 cup and left the remaining "spices" the same.  I thought the gravy was very good, making these glorified Hamburger patties rather tasty.  great Comfort food on a gloomy day.  Would be great with Mushrooms added, if you all like them.

My family really liked this recipe. I also couldn't get the onion soup at our store so I improvised with some sauteed onions added to a can of condensed beef broth and added a little diced onion to the meat mixture. I also threw in about 1/2 lb. of sliced mushrooms when I added the sauce. Just something we like. I will definitely be making this again. Thanks, Kelly.

This made a very tender, tasty salisbury steak, which I've always loved but have never attempted to cook before.  After reading previous reviews in which people said the sauce was a little too ketchupy, I decided to alter it a bit.  I added less ketchup, diced garlic, onion powder, and a lot of pepper.  Mmm, spicy!  I especially liked using the french onion soup, since I loathe shrooms (usually what they use).  I definitely suggest "basting" or spooning the sauce over your meat while it's cooking so that it doesn't dry out, and it gives it that authentic, juicy, coated look.  I served it with garlic mashed taters and white peas.

Great recipe, my husband loved it!  I was able to cook my patties in the skillet without them falling apart, but I cooked them slowly, and removed them from the pan while I worked on the sauce.  I changed the sauce a little, by deglazing the pan with a little red wine, and adding some mushrooms, and a can of cream of mushroom soup.

Delicious! Thank you for this recipe. It was so good I wanted to lick my plate. I doubled the gravy but used a can of beef broth instead of a second can of onion soup. I also double all the other gravy ingredients except the ketchup. 

Will definitely make this again and again.

I thought it was a great base recipe. I used lipton onion soup mix instead of condensed but I made it with beef broth instead of water and then let it reduce by about a third. also I sauteed baby portabellas and let them cook in the reduction. then poured over the patties and cooked in the oven it was awesome.

Someone said it tasted like meat loaf and I agree. I did not tell my daughter that becaused she does not like meat loaf. Her comment was it tasted like meat loaf without the "crunchy onions", which is what she mostly objects to. On the other hand my husband and parents all thought it was very good. I have never had Salisbury Steak with ketchup in it, so I think the name is misleading. I would probably not have made it if it had been named something else as I was looking for a meat and gravy recipe. If you are looking for a QUICK and easy "meat loaf"  you won't be disappointed.

Was very good, but got way too salty cuz I added beef boullion as suggested; I didn't have the canned soup.  Will try it again, we gobbled it up anyway.
**update***  I got the canned condensed soup and it was SO much better.  Didn't change anything with the recipe this time, and it was a big hit.

This is an excellent recipe!  If you like mushrooms, consider browning sliced mushrooms then adding to the pan for final cooking stage with meat and gravy.

Excellent and Delicious!! I added lots of sliced, fresh mushrooms at the time of adding the gravy (sauce) to the meat. Also, doubling the amount of sauce is a great idea. Said sauce goes well over mashed potatoes, noodles, whatever.

This was a hit at our house!  My husband said definitely make this again.  More of the gravy would have been great to put on mashed potatoes, but excellent flavor and so easy to make.

One tip, if you use a lowfat beef, you may want to put a little oil in pan when you brown the patties.

Absolutely delicious, followed the recipe excluding the salt. I finally found a recipe my whole family loved, including my picky eleven year old, who hates everything but chicken nuggets.

I never had Salisbury stakes before, nor did I cook them. But this recipe was remarkably easy and the result was very satisfying. Very tasty, tender meat and very good sauce. I didn’t make any changes except I used Dijon mustard instead of powder. I plan to cook it again very soon!

This was very good. I did not really want all the work of making the patties, so I just did regular hamburger patties, and it turned out great. Maybe with more time and patience I will try the other ingredients in the patties. My pickiest child asked for more, & my DH ate three! I will be making this again soon! Thanks for sharing!

Very Good.  I tweaked it a bit by adding some garlic and fresh mushrooms. I might add 2 cans of the soup next time, to give more "gravy".

My husband, the Salisbury Steak expert, said I could work in any cafeteria now after making this yummy recipe!  I added the mushroom soup and dry onion soup mix to the sauce as many suggested.

I made an inadvertent change to this when I misread the recipe and threw out the French onion soup after using the initial 1/3 cup. I ended up making my own, which was very good, but I should have increased the salt in the meat part of the recipe.

Overall this was quite good. Hubby liked it and I'll use my own beef/onion stock in the future and change the amount of salt in this.

Very tasty! I used venison instead of beef and it was really tender. I also substituted french onion soup with Beefy Mushroom because that's all I had. Will definitely make again!

Extremely easy snd a big hit with the family.  I couldn't find condensed onion soup at the supermarket but i got regular onion soup and added less water. It tasted great and wasn't too overbearing for the kids. I fried either side for around two minutes then covered with sauce and put in oven for 30-40 mins this way i could forget about it and get on with dishes etc. Great recipe everyone should give a go and experiment with different variations.

NOT your traditional Salisbury Steak!  It's ok if you like meatloaf, which is what it tasted like.  I'd try the recommended way to season the ground beef but stop there with this recipe.

This is an excellent recipe and really easy to make.  Great for serving when you are entertaining.  If they are running late, it just simmers and gets better while you wait.  I recommend making patties pretty flat as they plump up quite a bit when you cook them.  Excellent with asparagus.

My family really isnt use to eating these types of food being that we are hispanic but im glad they were open enough to try something new and they really liked it. I didnt have any of the ingridients for the sauce on hand so I used 2 packs of Liptons Onion and Mushroom Mix instead and it tasted awesome and had enough sauce to pour over mashed potatoes. I will definetly make this again. Thanks!

We loved this recipe and it is definately going in the keeper file!  The only changes I made were to decrease the ketchup to 1 tbsp. and I didn't have enough breadcrumbs so I used buttery cracker crumbs to make up the difference.  Absolutely delicious, especially the sauce!

The sauce had a weird flavor to me.  I had trouble finding condensed Onion Soup, so I ended up using cream of mushroom.  Not really something I am going to make again but it might have been the substitution I didn't like.

This one's a keeper! I took the advice of some of the others and used less ketchup, (about half of what is called for) & doubled up on the sauce. It was very tasty! However, we had leftovers the next day and it was even better! Like, ten times better!!! The meat was soooo tender the second day; next time I think I'll make it a day ahead and let it sit in the fridge overnight, then heat it up and serve the next day. I served this with mashed potatoes, but I think it would be great over egg noodles too.

This was a delicious recipe.  I love salisbury steak and had been craving it for several weeks when I found this recipe.  My boyfriend thought it was a silly thing to like b/c it reminded him of cafeteria food.  We ate this with mashed potatoes, green beans, and carrots.  He decided it is a keeper!  I did make a few modifications:  cream of mushroom soup instead of french onion soup, the bread crumbs were seasoned with onion soup mix, adding 1/2 cp water and 1/2 cp milk to make extra gravy, extra onion flakes sprinkled into the meat and the gravy, 1 additional Tbsp worcestershire sauce, and no ketchup (didn't have it).  The gravy was fine without the ketchup.  I think it would have made the gravy too sweet/tangy.

Very good! I think it may be a little bit heavy on the Worcestshire sauce, so next time I will tone it down. I followed the recommendations everyone else offered to add a second can of soup and double the gravy ingredients, and I'm glad I did! The beef patties are very flavorful and moist. This is probably the best recipe for Salisbury Steak that I have tried!

Thought this was great. Simple to make, doubled the sauce mix for extra gravy on potatoes. It's a keeper.

When this recipe first posted (I have a printout from 4/27/00 and have been enjoying it since), it read "1 can condensed onion soup".  I didn't use french onion - I used cream of onion - and loved it.  You could save on some calories and fat by using low-fat cream of mushroom and a partial packet of dry onion soup as well. (Campbell's doesn't offer low-fat cream of onion.) I never had a problem with patties falling apart or gravy not thickening with the cream soups.

My husband gave this 5 stars. I'm giving it 4. To me, it just tasted like meatloaf with gravy on it, but I guess that's how it's suppose to taste. I did add a package of brown gravy mix to it because everyone said there wasn't enough gravy. There was more than enough with that.

VERY, VERY good! Whole family loved it! Hubby liked it so much no one was allowed to have seconds because he wanted to take leftovers to work! I did add half a package dry onion soup mix to meat mixture, for sauce I omitted ketchup, and added can cream mushroom soup, 1/4 cup brown gravy mix, and doubled the water. Didn't have any mustard powder, so used a squirt liquid mustard. after browning patties, I put in large casserole poured sauce on top, and baked 30 minutes at 400 degrees

I made this for dinner the other night and everyone loved it. It is rare that EVERYONE really likes what I make for dinner. I did read is some reviews that the patties fell apart. I used ground chuck, cooked them on med high and flipped them only once. I turned them down to low when I added the soup mixture. If you stick to the recipe and only use the french onion instead of the cream soups, the meat will hold together. Also, make sure that the ketchup is well blended with the soup before you add it to the pan. The best part about it was that it was very simple and easy to make. I will definitely make this again.

This is my second time reviewing this recipe.  Last time I made it with steak per my husband's request.  This time I used hamburger meat.  I doubled the sauce but halved the ketchup and followed everything else exactly.  This is the perfect salisbury steak recipe.  We loved and and will make it again and again.  One other thing I did...because my pan is not big enough to hold the patties and sauce I baked it in a covered casserole at 350 degrees for 30 minutes.

I tried this last evening as one of my 30-minute meals.  It was a hit, the only problem was not enough gravy so you may want to double the liquid ingredients.  Thanks.

This was good, I did do alot of altering though, after reading other reviews. Also, I am not a "beef eater" so I used ground turkey instead, and needed to use the onion soup packets (since the condensed soup is made with beef broth)....Like alot of the other reviewers, I did think it was too ketchupy, and when I make it again I will cut out that part totally. I also used chicken broth instead of the water. I seen alot of other reviews complained that it was falling apart during cooking...I think the problem was they were cooking on too low of a heat.

Very good - the meat was very juicy.  But you do need to double the sauce.  I didn't have another can of French onion soup, so I used Cream of mushroom.  Still turned out great!

Super easy recipe, and very flavorful. Since this made more meat patties than I needed, I tried freezing the prepared ones for another time. Worked out great! One of our faves with mashed potatoes and green beans. A real comfort-food meal.

This was incredible. When I first make a recipe I always make it to the letter, then if I feel it needs tweaking to my taste I do it again another time. The steaks were perfect, great texture and taste. I do agree with many, that the gravy seemed a bit ketchupy, will cut back next time maybe add a little beef broth instead and mushrooms. 
I will make it again.

Turned out tasty and goes into the keeper file because unsuprisingly, Salisbury Steak is economical.  I added some milk and a can of beef broth along with additional flour to thicken the gravy.  I also fried sliced onions with the steaks.  The taste was familiar, which is what I was looking for.

good recipe.  the grocery store was out of condensed french onion soup, therefore, i bought Progresso's ready-to-serve soup and added a little bit more flour to the sauce to thicken it up more and it turned out great.  the only thing i would change would be to use less of the worcestershire sauce because i found this recipe to have a bit of a "tangy" aftertaste.  but all in all it's a great comfort food.  i served it with garlic mashed potatoes and it was yummy.

This recipe was pretty good and simple.  Like others, I added sauted mushrooms after browning the patties and added a can of beef broth to make more gravy.  However, I didn't care for the taste of ketchup in the gravy.  Next time I make this I will omit the ketchup.

I gave this only three stars because it was so bland. The other reviews said the sauce was tangy. No way. It was good but not very flavorful. The meat was very bland and needs something to spice it up. I might try this again but add some parsley and other spices and herbs to give it some flavor. Don't serve this to company.

This is such a great recipe!! I loved everything about it.  The sauce is the best part.  Even my 5 and 6 year old loved it.  Please note that at the end when you cover and cook...I turned the heat to low/simmer and cooked for about 40 minutes to let the flavor soak into the meat. My mom cooked it faster/higher and almost all of her sauce evaporated.

I made this for my family tonight and we all liked it a lot, including my extremely picky 3-year-old son. The only modifications I made were:
 I added 1/2 tsp. of onion powder, garlic powder and 1 T. of parsley (to give it that true salisbury steak appearance) to the meat mixture. 
 according to past reviewers, I cut down the mustard powder to 1/4 tsp, instead of 1/2 tsp. 
 instead of frying on the stove, I baked them at 375 degrees for 25 minutes in a glass casserole dish, drained, then added the gravy and baked an additional 10 minutes and the meat was "well done". 

I found them very juicy and they didn't fall apart. There was no leftovers, which is unusual for us! 
This is a great recipe - definitely a keeper!

I feel so badly, we didn't like this dish. It was really quite ketchupy in it's taste. I don't mind ketchup, but this was a bit overwhelming for my family.

very good, something to make when it is cold outside, and wants the feeling of comfort food, everyone was telling me how good it was before I had a chance to ask... I will make again for sure!! (made with mashed potatoes and fresh corn on the cob) I used half golden mushroom soup and half french onion.

I followed the recipe exactly and thought it was great.  There was plenty of gravy for the steak and for the mashed potatoes.  Even my kids, ages 6, 4 and 1 liked it!  They're tough to please.

I just made this for my husband and I and it turned out pretty good.  I followed the recipe except for adding a little bit of dry onion soup mix in the meat.  The only thing I didn't really like was that the sauce tasted to mustardy.  I will probably make this again, but cut down on the mustard.

MMMMMM!  The ultimate comfort food!  I make these with mashed potatoes and corn anytime I need something easy and comforting.  Followed the recipe to the T and they came out great.  I have also made a double batch, except for the sauce part, and have frozen one for later.  Works really well.  Just make the sauce when you are ready to use them, or use a beef gravy mix/jar for your sauce.

Great tasting easy to make recipe.  After browning the patties I removed them from the pan and tossed in 1/2 pound of sliced fresh mushrooms and  cooked them for 5 minutes. I added the patties back in and poured the sauce over all.  Wonderful Meal!  I served it on top of white rice. yummy!

My fiance and I both had about half of this left on our plates, and I'm not looking forward to the leftovers. Definitely not enough gravy. I would take others' advice and make more gravy next time, except I will not make this another time. It just tasted like cheap pot roast to me.

This is delicious!  The only reason I gave it four stars is because I changed some stuff.  I used Cream of Mushroom instead of onion, and added an onion soup packet.  I didn't add any of the cream of mushroom to the meat, and my steaks held together perfectly.  I only used one pound of meat.  I added some beef broth to the gravy to make it richer.  It is sooo good!

It was salisbury-licious. (Husband's quote) This was very good. My whole family devoured it. I made it almost as directed in the recipe. I browned the patties and then put them in the oven for 35 minutes, covered, at 325 degrees.  So easy to make and very satisfying to have the kids eat all their dinner for a change. Thanks for the recipe ~ it's a keeper!

This recipe has become my husband's new favorite dinner - he asks me to make these Salisbury steaks every week!  He even asked me to print out the recipe, so that he can make them for dinner at the firehouse.

Made a few minor alterations...  used package of Lipton Onion Soup Mix because I don't know if condensed onion soup is available in Canada?  Anyone from Canada find it somewhere?  Okay recipe but don't know if I'd make it again.

The first time I made this, I didn't pay attention to the directions and added the entire can of french onion soup to the hamburger - it was a soupy, yucky mess.  The second time, I followed the recipe with the exception of the changes recommended by other reviewers...can of cream of mushroom, no ketchup, added water to the pan after frying the patties and scraped the leavings into the sauce mix, baked for 30 minutes with sauce.  When following the directions and recommendations of other reviewers, it was VERY GOOD!  Definitely an addition to our meal rotation.

We use a bit more soup for the gravy, but what a hit in my house!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Wonderful!  Be sure and double the sauce and use less ketchup, as others have suggested.  Serve with plain rice or mashed potatoes.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very tasty.  I doubled the sauce to be sure I had plenty to cover a side dish of noodles.  I used reconstituted dry onion soup mix-it was much cheaper than buying 2 cans of soup.  Will make again.  Thank you.

This was surprisingly good.  It doesn't look particularly appetizing when you look at it, but it was quite tasty and it was great as leftovers.  I couldn't find condensed French onion soup at my grocery store so I used cream of mushroom and added some dry onion soup mix.  You could also make this as a meatloaf and make the sauce up separately.

Our family has made a recipe similar to this for years. We use Campbell's Beefy Mushroom for the soup and omit the flour. It is true comfort food at its best. An extra can of soup is used for extra gravy. It is a favorite with my children.

This has become a regular at my house. It is my son's favorite. The last time we made it we ran out of ketchup leaving us with about half (or a little more) the amount that the recipe called for... I think it's my favorite now.

Very good comfort food.  I was frightened at the smell of the gravy when I first combined the ingredients, but the end result was tasty.  Think I'll definitely add fresh mushrooms as others have suggested next time.

Although this recipe tasted delicious, it was not very appealing in its presentation. Both times i have made this the patties fell apart and crumbled into a bit of a mess.  Nonetheless, it was tasty and my husband loved it.  I will make again , however i will not be serving this to company.

I thought this was a little salty but my husband was practically licking the plate.  It was very easy but I would make more gravy next time for our mashed potatoes.  I think I will have to make it again because my husband will be asking for it.

This was a great recipe.  I also doubled the soup to make extra gravy for masthed potatoes.  Yummy!  The only thing I think I'll change next time is the ketchup.  Will definitely decrease the amount, if not omit altogether...otherwise, delish!

This was good as far as salisbury steak goes.  I would suggest using a very lean beef.  Without thinking I used a pretty cheap ground beef, and it ended up being pretty greasy (since there's no way to drain it before the meat is fully cooked, only right after the patties are browned).  But even so it was still good and my husband asked me to make it again.  I like recipies that don't require removing all the pans from my oven and heating up the entire kitchen :)  Also, next time I'll probably look for a low-sodium soup.

My family LOVED this dish - but I, naturally, made some changes to it (as any good cook would).  I added a LOT more bread crumbs to the mixture than was called for, as I thought it looked a bit, well, sloppy.  I'm glad that I did, because in all honesty, it broke apart anyway!  :-)  I also added less ketchup to the sauce than was called for, and a bit less Worcestershire - the color of the sauce outright scared me.  I also added 2 cans of mushrooms.  In the end, this dish was WONDERFUL, despite the fact that it all broke apart.  One thing I noticed, however, was that the sauce only took 5 minutes to cook up and NOT 20 - if I had left it on for 20 minutes, I would have had a black, burned mess!  I will be making this again without a doubt.  Thanks for the recipe, Kelly!

This was very good. I took the advice of others and did the following:  Doubled the soup, to make more sauce, for the mashed potatos.  I also added mushrooms and added Montreal Seasoning to the patties, along with the dry onion/mushroom soup mix.  My husband said it was a keeper!

I made this twice already, can't wait to make it again!  My family loved it!  I did add a little red wine to the gravy, and less ketchup for less sweetness.  I sprinkled Montreal Steak seasoning on the patties.  I also added some canned beef gravy to have extra, and served this with mashed potatoes...yummy!  I plan to make these for parties in cocktail size meatballs.

I made this for dinner tonight with a can of low-fat french onion soup. It was delicious! My brother in law, the great Salisbury steak taste tester, has not yet contributed his opinion. But the other three people who live here loved this! Thanks for sharing, Kelly! Better than Swanson's!!!

This is one of my favorite recipes.  I have a short cut though, I buy ready made salisbury steaks at the meat store, and use this sauce.  This sauce makes the meal.  I do double the sauce to use over mashed potatoes, and add mushrooms to the sauce.

After trying several recipes for salisbury steak, I found this one to be the absolute best. Talk about flavor. The condensed french onion soup seems to be the key. Thank you so much for helping me find a hearty meal for my family that was relatively simple too.                    ---Lynn O.

This recipe was yummy !!!
The only thing I felt let it down was the meat lacked a little flavour. Next time I would add something to meat mixture or make the patties 1/2 the size. The sauce was really good. I added a squeeze of honey as the ketchup I used was a little to tart. Tasted excellent and was not too thin or too thick. 
Will be making again for sure.

I had a hard time with this one as I didn't seem to have a pan large enough, and they fell apart, but in the end the family loved it and there were no leftovers!

The gravy really did not have much flavor for our liking, I will try to make this again but perhaps I will add brown gravy and other seasoning to it.

This was a very good recipe.  I used half ground beef and half ground turkey and I used condensed golden mushroom for the French onion soup.  To compensate for the lack of onion flavor, I caramelized a large Texas sweet onion and added half of it to the meat mixture and half to the sauce mixture.  I only made the changes because I did not have all the exact ingredients.  The dish I ended up with may not have been Salisbury Steak but it was, nevertheless, very good.

I completly changed this one, to use what I had on hand.  To the beef I added a scant tablespoon of onion soup mix, one egg and 1/3 cup breadcrumbs.  I then browned the patties, and covered them in fat free beef gravy, and simmered.  Delicious and easy! Thank you very much for the recipe!

This is great! It is one of the few dishes that my daughter will ask for seconds.

I halved the recipe for making the patties but used full amounts for sauce. The gravy goes great over mashed potatoes. Will occassionally serve over Texas toast as an open faced sandwhich.

I have shared this recipe many times over - I make extra patties and bake the burgers in the oven so they can be frozen and just warmed up later in the sauce, and my husband likes them on their own for a quick late night snack.

This was very good and I will make this again.   I wasn't sure about serving a tangy sauce with mashed potatoes, so I substituted the ketchup for 1/2 can of cream of mushroom soup and added extra mushrooms.   
We didn't have the canned french onion soup, so I used beef bouillon instead.

This is a keeper  -- super easy!

I tried this recipe as yet another attempt to get my children to eat the elusive ground beef.  It worked!  Great recipe, super quick, easy, and frugal too!  The patties kept their shape yet did not come out dry or need to be soaked in sauce.  I did replace the recommended sauce with brown  gravy and topped it all with mushrooms sauteed in garlic and herbs.  Oh and I added minced garlic to the recipe too.  Definitely a keeper.  Next time I will try it with green peppercorn sauce.

This recipe is soo... easy.  I did find it too tomatoey, though.  I will try the version with the beef consume next time.  I think it would be easy to make it your  own recipe  with just a few tries.

LOVED IT!! When trying Salisbury Steak, I never expect much.  You know, ground beef is ground beef, not much you can do with it.  But was I surprised when I said "YUM" eating this!!!  What a surprise to find a recipe that I tried just to get rid of my ground beef in the fridge turned out to be a permanent keeper in my recipe box!!!

EXCELLENT! 10 STARS! I actually used spicy brown prepared mustard in leiu of the called for. (I only used a tiny drop) I also added a 2nd can of soup, along with an extra half tbsp. of flour to the gravy. This is honestly one of the best recipes I have ever tried, and my family agrees!

This recipe was a keeper at my house.  I have prepared it twice now.  Very tasty and easy..Hint:  when I bought my hamburger meat, I went ahead and made the patties according to the recipe and froze them.  This really speeds things up in the kitchen and you can't tell you prepared the patties earlier.

This was a big hit w/ my family. My husband said this was the 1st time he's ever had homemade Salisbury Steak & gave his 'look' that it's a keeper!  I extended the gravy by adding an additional can of soup  & next time will add some fresh mushrooms.  Very good! Thanks for sharing Kelly.

I REALLY liked this one.  I've never made Salisbury Steak before, only ever had
the frozen kind.  I didn't have bread crumbs on hand so instead I used a box of 
Uncle Bens Country Style Stuffing mix (including the seasoning packet).  I loved
it so much made this way that I'm not sure if I'll even make it according to the 
recipe now!  I, too, also add whatever I have on hand to extend the sauce a bit 
further.  This dish is now a regular in my house.

Very easy to make and delicious too. I 
would probably make some kind of natural
gravy instead of the one provided, in
order to cut down on calories. I think
my kids would also prefer that kind of
gravy!

Like some others I did make changes by using onion soup mix, fresh mushrooms, and doubling the amount of sauce. But overall, the recipe is very good.

I didn’t have canned French onion so I used a dry envelope with some beef broth. I browned meat and let is all simmer for about 20 minutes and it tasted great! I didn’t salt.. and served with mashed potatoes.  Yum.

Awesome!  I didn't really measure anything out.. I kind of eyeballed it.  Also, the French Onion soup maybe made have been a tad overwhelming.. at least to my kids.. but not enough to keep us all from devouring it!  Combined with sauteed mushrooms and onions with a side of mashed potatoes and gravy, this dinner was a win.  (any ideas to tone down the overwhelmingness that is french onion soup?)

It was very similar to meatloaf. The ketchup added too much sugar and made the dish way to sweet. Next time I’ll omit the ketchup.

My company and husband said it was the best Salisbury steak they'd ever had. I thought it needed less ketchup. 
But they said it was perfect.
Changes as recommended: add a little sauteed onion and a can of cream of mushroom soup.
Give it shot! We're adding it to our menu rotation.

I have made this dish a few times now.... we really enjoy it.   I do add garlic to the meat patties.  Tonight I used ground chicken...it was on sale.   I should have added an extra egg to keep the patties together better.

I followed the recipe except I didn’t include the ketchup & mustard which neither appealed to me.  I have never used canned French onion soup, I normally use Lipton Onion Soup Mix. I didn’t care for the canned soup flavor.

So much flavor with easy prep.  After the cooking is complete I remove to a plate leaving remaining sauce in the pan.  The sauce is so flavorful and VERY VERY thick so I add water couple TBS. at a time and stir to break up any pieces and mix until I like the consistency.  Then I pour over the steaks on the plate.

Gross. Strong ketchup flavor, and we actually cut the ketchup in half. No one in the family liked it.

Delicious and easy! I made bread crumbs from herb-seasoned stuffing mix and substituted a package of mushroom gravy mix for the flour, so I omitted the salt. Will definitely make it again!

I tried this with ground venison and it turned out great. I did not add the ketchup and because venison is so lean it could have used a little more seasoning in the meat. I will defiantly make 'tis

I took the suggestions to also add a can of cream of mushroom soup and a dry onion soup packet.  I would maybe try to eliminate the ketchup.  It had a weird sweet taste.

I went with some suggested modifications. I added a small amount of vegetable oil to skillet. Browned both sides of patty and added sauce. I replaced most of the sauce ingredients with instant brown gravy powder. Used 2 Tbsp of Worcestershire sauce. Also added a can of cream of mushroom soup, and 8 oz fresh, sliced mushrooms. Cover and simmer for 40 minutes. Whole family loved it!

Wonderful taste. Went well with mashed potatoes but I'll try rice and/or quinoa next time. Tripled the water (actually used chicken broth left over in the fridge) amount though -- or maybe quadrupled it, I didn't measure just poured into the pan after seeing there was nowhere near enough liquid for my taste.  Will definitely make this again and will add it to my preping list.

I have made this a few times and I give it five stars, because it is simple, outcome is consistent and flavor is great. I do start with the base recipe and make additions. I use two pounds of ground. I usually mix one pound of beef and one pound of venison. I like lots of sauce, so I use two cans of soup: one french onion and one golden mushroom. To the sauce, I also add a handful of sliced mushrooms and a little bit of paprika. With this, I always make homemade mashed potatoes and cream corn.

This recipe was very good.  The only thing I added was fresh mushrooms to the sauce mixture then let it simmer until the mushrooms were soft.  I will definitely make again.

With the only alteration being the removal of the ketchup, this recipe is a keeper! DO NOT add the dry onion soup mix as other commenters have suggested as it makes the gravy incredibly salty.

This turned out great and my family loved it! My only suggestion would be to double the sauce/gravy recipe. There wasn’t enough to pour over the mashed potatoes after it was done cooking.

The only change I made was I didn't put pepper in it. My husband is allergic. Oh, I also deleted the mustard powder. He didn't care for that. I  used to have a newspaper clipping of this recipe from years ago. I  Googled it and found this. I'm very happy I did. 
Yes. I  will make it again.

I followed the recipe pretty much as it was written except  I added Beef consommé and an additional tablespoon of flour as well for some added flavor and to make more gravy.  I think the next time I make it I'll  omit the ketchup...definitely a keeper!

Flavor was very good!  I enjoyed it.  Did add garlic and onion (I do this with everything but baking) and bell pepper.  I suggest reading directions thoroughly so you don't also add the whole can of soup to the mix!!  SMH.  Ended up adding way more bread crumbs and another egg and baked it like a loaf instead.  I will make again.  Next time correctly!

This recipe will be added to my”make frequently” pile. My family thoroughly enjoyed it. I was pleased as, even though I am 73 yrs old and cook frequently, had never made Salisbury steak before. I was proud to have produced such a delicious dish!

So evocative. Exactly how our 8th grade lunch lady used to prepare it. Oh those were incredible days. When cares were so simple but weighed heavy on a young mind, so naive. I’ll never forget her piercing eyes. She served with such supple grace. A tenderness radiated from every spoonful, on par with the meat in this dish. Her hair net contained something wilder, unknown. I sometimes wonder how life was to her... Thank you for the memories. :)

I seared the meat and placed in an 11x9 baking dish. I then added some more butter and sauteed the onions and mushrooms. I deglazed the pan with some red wine 1/4 cup. I also used dry onion soup mix and added water and some beef bouillon along with the rest of the ingredients listed. After the gravy was made, I poured the gravy over the meat in the pan. Then finished cooking the meat at 350 for 20 minutes or until desired doneness. It was delicious.

Sauce was mostly burnt or evaporated by the time it was done despite adding a little extra water. Patties were good but not a ton of flavor.

I made this as directed. I turned out great with one exception. I could really taste the mustard and it was a little overpowering so I had to deduct 1 star for that. Next time, and there will be a next time, I will just reduce or leave out the mustard. Its not that I don't like mustard but when it makes a dish too vineragy then its time to cut back.

Love this recipe! Followed the recipe the first time but made some changes the next time I made it. I use lots of extra soup and use it as gravy for mashed potatoes. I also add mushrooms and onion. Any time I ask my husband what he wants for dinner he says “salisbury steak”!

I have six people to cook for, including four children! It was their favourite dish EVER. I like many others before me added a can of cream of mushroom soup and used beef stock instead of water with a sachet of French onion soup! it was incredible!

Made the recipe as written, no alterations.  Steaks were good but sauce taste was off.  The flavor of the ketchup does not fit, and I plan to omit it in the future.  Will also double the sauce as there wasn't enough.

I made this and the family enjoyed it.  I am not sure where I went wrong though, since I've never done meatloaf or any "egg/ breadcrumb" dish. It came out a little dry and the sauce was a bit too thick. I am giving the high rating since I know it was me and not the formula.

Wonderful recipe. Very flavorful. I added 4 ounces of mushrooms after cooking for 20 minutes and put it on simmer for 5 minutes.

Perfect!

I have made this several times now and it's become a favourite.    I used large flake oatmeal instead of bread crumbs and I made the onion soup from the onion soup mix from Bulk Barn.

This was a great recipe I doubled it and made it in an electric skillet. Only think I changed was I added some seasoned salt to the recipe. This one is a keeper. ??

Came out really GOOD! I changed a few things. I used mustard instead of mustard seed/mustard powder. And I added Au jus to the French onion mixture. I also added a tea spoon of liquid smoke. Make sure it's just a bit. It'll over power everything. I seasoned the meat with mustard, pink Himalayan salt. Grinded black pepper, liquid smoke ( I season the eggs with liquid smoke), garlic powder. I used the French onion for the gravy. Added Au jus, sautéed Vidalia onions, 3 garlic cloves and a few bay leaves. I’m telling you, it takes the dish from down home to gourmet. Im a self taught chef. I love putting my own spin on things

My family didn't really care for the Italian onion soup piece.  The onion soup makes the gravy sweet.  I think i will make this again, but i will use a true mushroom gravy.

I added a dash of Italian seasoning but, besides that, I followed the recipe to a T. Even our 5 year old loved it. This was quick and easy. I will definitely make it again and next time I will be adding sauteed onion. Thank you

Awesome recipe! I didn't have French onion soup, so I used dry onion soup mixed with 1.5 cups water and I didn't have dry mustard so I used half tbsp yellow mustard and it was great! Super easy and really tasty!

Followed exactly except used cream of mushroom instead, that’s what I had on hand. Turned out good. I like the idea of mixing the soup with the meat, keeps it moist.

My husband gave it 5 stars, but I'd probably say 4 just because it's not my kind of meal. A lot of flavor. But he's the picky one, so it's a winner and we'll be making it again.

I didn't like the Worcestershire  in it. So other than that it turned really well.

Reminds me of Stouffer's, which is a compliment because up until now, that used to be my favorite. I did find it a tad sweet for me, but next time, I'll just cut back on the ketchup. My very picky niece actually cleaned her plate!

I did NOT use the condensed onion soup. Instead I mixed I/4  packet of dry onion soup mix  and mixed it  with the ground beef along with the other ingredients.  I then made the rest of the dry onion soup according to package directions and simmered my burgers in it until done.  I agree with another reviewer in that using the dry soup mix  is much better.  I tried making  the gravy/sauce  according to the recipe and it was not good.  I plan on making these again.

The Salisbury steaks themselves were fine. But the sauce was way too sweet! Omit the ketchup or simply make a gravy with French Onion soup alone.

Very good.  I sautéed mushrooms and added to sauce.  I made additional sauce, as many suggested, browned the steaks stovetop and then baked in oven.  Tasty comfort food with mashed potatoes and a side of veggies.

My boyfriend is a HUGE fan of the Hungry Man Salisbury Steak frozen dinner you can find in the supermarket. This was a delicious recipe. It was just what we needed. I paired it with pasta salad, mashed potatoes, biscuits, peas and carrots. It is a lot of carbs, haha! But the dinner was so comforting. Pure comfort food. I followed just about everything to a T. The ONLY difference was to add 1/2 C of water instead of 1/4. It was a very small alteration. I wanted a little extra gravy to pour over my mashed potatoes. 

But as this little difference does not alter the recipe ingredients much, I must say, this recipe just as it is was PHENOMENAL. Thank you!!! :-D

This is a great simple recipe.  The first time I made it, the family and friends loved it just as it is written.  For personal preferences, I have made a couple of changes - added mushrooms and onions to the "steaks" and to the gravy.  We also love to load up our mashed potatoes with the gravy so I do make more sauce (double the recipe).  Again, 5 star as written, add your own flavor if you want.

This  recipe is really very tasty - I doubled the gravy as another reviewer suggested to have enough for mashed potatoes etc. 
My husband and I both liked it. It was a bit salty - french onion soup, worchestershire sauce, and salt - but still we liked it. I only rate it as a 3-star because it was very onion-y (of course!) and my system evidently can't tolerate that much onion because I had indigestion all night (and so did my husband)!

Sorry. Normally I’m good about picking recipes. I home cook everyday. The reviews on this prompted me to go ahead and try it. I am not a fan of the soup. It was terrible to me. But I seem to be the minority on this one. I never open cans of soup to cook with. Thank you though.

RATING THE ORIGINAL RECIPE AS IS - I also didn't feel like the steaks were that tasty and they relied heavily on the flavor of the gravy. Which wouldn't have been an issue, but it was a bit too tangy for me. So happy I made mashed potatoes to kind of even out the flavor. I think its a good recipe, but I think next time I'll try it with half the ketchup and a can of cream of mushroom as suggested by other users.

Followed the recipe to the letter. What a disaster. It tastes cheap and the patties crumbled immediately.
The only reason it's getting 2 stars is that I was able to cook some noodles to throw in and tell my husband I was too tired to cook so I made hamburger helper.

I made the recipe very close to the written directions.  Before I made this I had read reviews, others stated that they had trouble with the meat sticking together...I simply added more bread crumbs till it was at the right consistency and it worked out fine.  My family liked it so I will be making this again!  It was easy and fast too!

The first time I made this I followed the recipe and we loved it! The second time I didn’t have all of the ingredients so made some adaptations. I used 1 lb ground beef and 1/2 lb ground pork, 1 can of cream of mushroom soup, a packet of Lipton’s Onion and Mushroom soup mix, some fresh pressed garlic, and a soup can of red wine instead of water. I didn’t need to add any salt or pepper. It was delicious and I’m sorry I didn’t make more! Thank you for the recipe!

Since my family (2 adults with 2 kids) like leftovers, I tripled some of the recipe and made some modifications.  To make the patties, I used 4.5 pounds of lean ground beef, one can of condensed French onion soup, 1 cup dry bread crumbs (meant to put in 1.5 cups, but forgot to add the last 1/2 cup), 1 package of Lipton onion soup mix, 2 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce, 3 eggs, and ground pepper (didn’t measure).  I made 16 patties.  I browned them in the skillet, then placed in a couple of casserole dishes.  For the gravy I mixed 3 jars of beef gravy, 1 jar of mushroom gravy, 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup and 1 Tbsp of Worcestershire sauce (my family loves gravy with their rice - I’m adding a picture so you can see how much gravy I had so you can adjust accordingly).  I poured this over the patties and baked 45 minutes on 350.  The family loved it and we’ll definitely be making this again.

What I learned from making this recipe: canned onion soup tastes b-a-d. I might make it again, but I would start by making onion soup from scratch.

I tweeked the recipe a little and used lean ground sirloin. I couldn't find French Onion soup so I substituted heart healthy cream of mushroom soup mixed with a packet of bry,  Lipton beffy onion soup mix. I also didn't have dry mustard, so I left it out. My husband flipped over this recipe, he absolutely loved it!!!

I made this right before Christmas. Had all my kids at home , so 9-10 mouths to feed. I tripled  up on the recipe , and tweaked it just a tad, as my small kids are picky eaters. This was a hit ! I figured I'd have left overs.... I had 3 steaks left... 
I served it with mashed potatoes and rice. Tonight , I'll be serving with egg noodles for something different.... 
The flavor is definitely home style. The ease of making it , both prep and cook, was fantastic. With 5 little ones running around, my house cam be chaotic. And if you wanted to , it would be a great meal to get the kids to help make.

I followed the recipe as is, minus the mustard powder. My steaks fell apart, but I wasn’t sure if it’s been because I used 85/15 meat.

I did have to adjust due to not having 2 items. For the ground mustard I rinsed out the little bit of left over mustard with sweet onion. In place of condensed beef onion soup, I used Lipton's dry Onion soup mix and just  added 1 1/2 cups water instead of the 4 cups. It is the best Salisbury steak recipe I have tried to date.

The first time I made this I followed the original recipe exactly as stated and didn’t have enough gravy. This time I followed Allyson Hester recipe exactly as she made hers and it came out perfect with way more gravy.  Oh, I did not add the can of mushroom souped because we don’t care for mushrooms.

Yes I tweaked this receipe before making it, as I've come across too many on here that are bland.  So before my family could complain about the lack of flavor.
I used the rest of the onion soup and added about 3/4 can of mushroom soup, doubled the rest except for the keptchup which I kept as was.
Lots of yummy flavor and will make again.

No changes made to this recipe which how I think I should rate it.  It was very easy to make and was very good.  This will be in my meal rotation for sure.  And my nine year old daughter loved it which is a plus.

I made it and it was pretty descent.However, no way is it a 5 star meal the way it is. Add extra ketchup and dark brown sugar mix overtop with mushrooms. Much better

I decreased the amount of Worcestershire sauce by about half  for my liking. This was easy and turned out wonderfully.

This was quick and easy to make, and made it with no changes. Delicious! Paired it with Allrecipes Roasted Garlic Potatoes. Yum. Only thing different is if I was having mashed potatoes I would double the sauce to have extra for the mash potatoes. Will be making this again.

The BEST Salisbury steak ever.  Period. No need to change a thing (unless you want to double the sauce)! The sauce is amazing and delicious.  It is a hit with everyone that tries it.

I made this as followed but I did not like the gravy. So instead I prepared 2 packages of brown gravy along with remains of the French Onion Soup and it was a HUGE hit with the family.

Family absolutely loves this recipe!! I do most of the same as the original recipe but after browning the patties I oven bake them with the gravy which I have added French onion soup and some A1 and a jar of sliced mushrooms. Serve with fresh garlic mashed potatoes and it will put you in chubby kid heaven.

This recipe was awesome. I am definitely going to make this again and again. I added garlic powder to the meat and doubled up on the gravy.. I like to add gravy to my meatloaf   and mash potatoes so I needed plenty....

Like a lot of other people I made changes.  I adjust my servings to use 2lbs. of ground beef, and yes there still isn't enough sauce, however, that's not bad.  I'm single so I just cooked 4 patties in the sauce and froze the rest.  When I defrost, I'll use the same ingredients to make another batch of sauce.  Except for ketchup, it gave the sauce a weird flavor.

When I added the ingredients to my shopping list, it transferred mustard powder to mustard seed so I got the wrong ingredient there. So, always double check the list transfers correctly. However, other than that it was really yummy! I will get the powder instead of seed next time. I will also add mushrooms.  I will use 1/4 to 1/3 cup of beef broth instead of water & use Wondra instead of flour.

I really didn't care for the sauce gravy, I thought it had too much of a vinegar flavor. I wanted more of a beef gravy taste.

I doubled the recipe and found that it was perfect for leftovers, and WE NEEDED THE LEFTOVERS! I have a very picky six old that won’t eat meat with sauce. She had a second serving along with every other person at the table. Easy, tender, definitely a favorite in our family.

Definitely making again soon!

This is seriously amazing.  The entire family loved it, and I will be adding it to my rotation.  I did double the ingredients for the gravy, and sautéed some sliced onions and mushrooms before adding the gravy.  Definite keeper.

Added one packet of dried onion soup mix and a tablespoon of cream of mushroom soup to the patties, then added the rest of the cream of mushroom soup to the sauce. 2 lbs of meat made six large patties. Excellent flavor and easy recipe. Made it with mashed potatoes and steamed fresh green beans.

This was awesome! We made it exactly as directed and everyone loved it. 

Then we tried the oven method (seared in the pan and then a 375 oven for 30 min) — made a homemade mushroom gravy with the drippings and loved it too! Thanks for this recipe

I have made this several times now  and there are  never leftovers afterwards!  I do add a can of cream of mushroom soup in the gravy mix.  This is a perfect Salisbury steak recipe for my family!

Sauce was pretty bad, why did I think Ketchup would be ok? Tasted more like meatloaf than Salisbury Steak.

I added some sautéed mushrooms, otherwise made exactly as written. We decided it was one of the best suppers I've ever cooked! Thanks for this very tasty recipe.

They came out good,  I didn't have any problems with the patties falling apart. I made some rice to go along with them.  Next time I make these I will probably add a little less ketchup to the sauce and throw in some diced mushrooms.

I made this recipe verbatim and the patties held their shape and I found the sauce the be tasty unlike many of the reviews I read.

I chose this recipe because when I normally make Salisbury steaks I will carmelize 1.5 onions.  After carmelizing, I take 1/2 of the onions mince them and place them into the patties. The other half I use for the gravy.  I also find crushed saltines will provide a much more tender texture to the patties than bread crumbs. I did not have saltines on hand today and quite frankly was feeling on the lazy side and I had a can of canned French onion soup.

For a recipe that cuts down time and effort, I found it to be good and my fiancé enjoyed it. It may have been a tad saltier than my normal recipe but it’s good and and was very easy to follow!

Decided to make this recipe because it was rated 4 1/2 stars with over 3,000 reviews.  This receipe was hands-down the absolute worst recipe I have ever tried on this site.  I'm not even that picky of a person either.  I made the recipe exactly with no changes.  Too much bread crumbs...made the meat have a terrible texture.  The sauce...where do I start.  It was horrible.  Ketchup and mustard do not belong in salisbury steak...I'm sorry.  I didn't know whether to laugh or cry after making this.  It's a shame that people doctor up this recipe and then give it 5 stars so that people like me think it is a good recipe.  Horrible. Horrible. Horrible.

I was intrigued by this recipe because of the French Onion soup and dry mustard. So, decided to give it a try. I stayed pretty true to the recipe only adding sautéed onions and fresh mushrooms and adjusting some measurements since I only used a pound of ground beef. I pan fried my patties until they got a good sear on the outside, pulled them out of the pan, added back in the onions, mushrooms and gravy ingredients and then finished in the oven at 350 for 30 minutes. Served with mashed potatoes and peas! Yummy!

4 stars because I made my own changes from the very beginning - I don't like mustard and ketchup so I removed those. I took reviewers advice and for gravy I had 1 can cream of mushroom and 1 can french onion soup and like 1/4 pack of dry onion soup mixed,  with pepper, a little flour because I was scared it would clump [and it  did so I was glad i didn't put much]. For the meat I followed recipe minus salt, added splash of Worcestershire's sauce and 1/2 pack of dry onion soup. I fried them in skillet with butter and 2 tsp of  minced garlic [from the jar] . Turned out really good [5 stars! ] with the garlic potatoes recipe  from here, side was butter corn though I think green beans would be better, and sweet Hawaiian rolls. My boyfriend loved it! We'll be making this often and this is still great as leftovers!

I added my own spin to it (1/4 cup half and half, a splash of beef broth, and put season salt in place for the salt). I loved it though and will be eating this again!!

Used a can of cream of mushroom (all I had), bag of onion mix, and doubled all ingredients for gravy except ketchup, as top review suggested. I added a little water though, about a half cup, because it seemed a little thick. Browned both sides, and then put into a cast iron skillet in oven for 25 minutes baking at 325. Delicious!

This was not hit in my house. In fact we ended up eating sandwiches. It was just too sweet, I made it as the recipe said and then tried to salvage it. But it just didn’t help.

Thank you for sharing this recipe. Nice, easy recipe that makes my entire home smell fantastic! Made it as is first and I like heavy seasoning so I used Lipton onion soup mix as an add in....very delicious. This is now in my families rotation every other week with cauliflower mashed! Thanks again for sharing...

Salisbury steak is a very popular meal in Japan, where I grew up, but the sauce is very different. This sauce made mostly from French onion soup and Worcestershire sauce plus the kick from mustard is a new experience to my taste buds (and my family's) and they are all very happy about it. I found the recipe about a month ago and I have already made it 3 times. So, yes, we definitely approve! I do not use ketchup, do use Lipton Onion Soup Mix, and I definitely double the amount of gravy. I make a lot of garlic mashed potatoes with this and we can enjoy the left over mashed potatoes and gravy in the next few days. Great recipe!

Easy and I actually added an extra can of soup because I love the rich taste and my kids loved it too! I added portobello mushrooms just because we love them. 
This is definitely going on the week night menu. Incredibly easy to make and budget friendly

Made this exactly as written, and even my kids thought it was too sweet.  This recipe is still a keeper though because the other flavors are fabulous! Next time I'll replace the ketchup with tomato sauce, and I will definitely add sauteed onions too.

This was delicious!  I made it with white rice and veggies. My husband went for seconds and even my picky three year old ate it and wanted seconds also. The only thing I would do differently next time is to make extra sauce to put over rice or mashed potatoes.

I have made this many times since i first found the recipe in 2007. Always delicious! I really don't change anything except I bake in the oven after browning.
I usually make double sauce and serve it with egg noodles although great also with mashed potatoes.Just a great comfort food recipe.

My family liked it so well I had to make it again!  I did double the gravy since they wanted it for mashed potatoes as well as over the steaks.  We definitely liked it with additional grace which we all thought was delicious!

Just made this for my family and everyone LOVED IT...

Changes I made was double French Onion Soup and added 1 can of cream of mushroom soup with roasted garlic.  I doubled everything except the ketchup.  I also added 1 container of baby Bella mushrooms.  

I will make this again.

Didn't taste the way I expected. With all the ketchup, it honestly tasted like a meatloaf with gravy. I think next time I will put less ketchup.

Prepared it as given. In fact I’m  making it again tonight for dinner. We all loved it. I did use the ground sirloin on one occasion and also the ground round steak on another occasion. All were delicious. Thanks for the good recipe

I made this almost as the recipe called for except I added one tbsp of Worcestershire sauce to the meat mixture and one to the sauce mixture an oversight. (Oops) either way it was a hit. Everyone home for dinner said it was awesome. We had it with mashed potatoes and sautéed whole green beans. Very easy to make, ingredient list was easy most things already in the pantry and best of all no mushrooms !  I’m allergic so usually I cannot eat Salisbury steak so I was very happy to find this recipe. I honestly do not think the recipe needs any adjusting (except if you have more than 4 people or teenage boys make a double batch) Saving this to my favorites and will make it again for sure.

Rated the original recipe.   Second time I made it I added an onion soup mix packet and a can of mushrooms to the gravy.  I omitted the salt.  After browning the patties, I put them in a casserole dish, covered them with the gravy, put foil over it and baked at 375 for 45 minutes.  Will add this recipe to my favorites.

Didnt taste good. I mean it was edible. But the ketchup is yuck! It didnt even resemble gravy. And the meatloaf was to soggy. It seemed as if under cooked. But wasnt. I would have just used regular gravy or half the emount of ketchup.

It was good, but next time I will drastically reduce the amount of worcestershire.  I doubled the gravy ingredients except the ketchup, so I used 2 tbs. of worcestershire and it was overpowering.  The recipe was actually great otherwise.

I got locked out of my original all recipes account the other day bc I got a new phone, and had to make a new one. This was the first recipe I saved when making my new account Bc it always stuck in my head bc it is absolutely amazing. My 6 year old son loves these so much. There is no need to tweak the recipe either, Bc it is soooo good just as written. Def gotta try these out people!

Made this recipe as per the recipe, except using less ketchup and adding mushrooms to the gravy (which seem to appear on the photograph of the dish, but not in the recipe...)

It was quite delicious! Real comfort food. I would suggest foregoing as much of the canned / processed product as possible and using fresh if you have it. But other than that it was delicious.

I don't understand all the positive reviews.  I was not impressed and will not make this recipe again. The sauce was very astringent with the French onion soup. I made the recipe as in the instructions  but it tasted so bad and unbalanced I added a can of mushroom soup to mellow it out enough to eat. I threw the remainder out. Will continue to search for better recipes.

It was a delicious and simple to make meal,  made in well under an hour. The only change I made was to add sliced mushrooms to the gravy which provided a bit of tasty texture.

I did change this up just a tad though. It was a lazy Saturday and I was very tired and lazy from a hard week at work so I made this into a meatloaf and put it in the crockpot. After a few hours I poured the sauce over the top and let it thicken. Also added some green pepper to the meat mixture. It turned out pretty good.

Very solid 4 star review.  I dropped the amount of ketchup a bit.  I could not find canned French Onion soup, so I made a half packet of dried beefy onion soup mix as a substitute.

We enjoyed it very much.  A nice richness to the sauce, but not too sweet, good balance.  Also quick and easy, which is a benefit for me.  Using the dried soup also gives me flexibility on cutting the recipe down (only 2 of us), although the leftovers were easy to reheat for lunch, so either way works.

I didn’t care for he taste of the sauce.  I even cut the amazon unit of ketchup called for by half like an the s said, but the sauce wasn’t to my liking. My picky 9 year old seemed to like it though.  The taste of the Salisbury steak was good.

Wasn't a fan of the ketchup in it.  Was easy and will make it again and try the others suggestion of the can of mushroom soup.  The only change was I did add a can of mushrooms.

Its alright for "meatloaf with gravy". Please note: cook temp should be at least 375F and cook time drastically depends on paddy size. 20 minutes is very optimistic.

This was a hit at the family table. I personally found it a little too ketchup-y but my husband and son (who think of ketchup as a food group) thought it was perfect. (Next time I’m going to secretly back the ketchup quotient down a tad) I couldn’t find condensed French onion soup so I used dry onion soup mix with water, it was a tad on the salty side but I believe that’s my fault for the swap. (Next time I’ll opt for a low sodium version) this was quicker and easier to make than I thought it would be. Thank you for a great recipe!

Couldn't find the condensed French onion soup so I substituted with onion soup mix in a pouch and added less water to the mix. Didn't have the same dark rich color but was very tasty none the less.

Decent.  I only had the dry onion soup. So I improvised, one packet in the burger, one packet and a cup of water for the sauce.  I think because I did this I felt the salt should have been ommited. This tastes very very good and keeps the burger nice and moist. 
Next time I will add mushrooms in the sauce :)

I made this recipe ‘as is’ and it was beautiful!  It’s a favourite with my picky eater teenage stepson...enough so that he asked me specifically to make this for him!  Only changes  I have ever made to the original recipe is to add some minced garlic and fresh mushrooms to the gravy.

Great meal for a school night. I'm always looking for ground beef recipes that aren't hamburgers, and this is a great option. Pretty much everything is generally on hand all of the time. Since I've made this so often, I've started stocking french onion soup in my pantry so I'm always ready for those busy nights that didn't get much time for planning.  My tip, once you've decided this one's for supper, set your ground beef out of the fridge about 30 minutes (or as close as you can manage) ahead of mixing. The beef will retain juices better, and your hands will thank you for not being wrist deep in freezing cold meat while you mix and shape. I hope you enjoy this one as much as we have. Bon appetit. :)

I made a concentrated onion soup from packet onion soup mix from $1 store, meaning I added half the water the soup packet said to use for onion soup. I then made a mushroom gravy packet mix (i buy low sodium versions at my grocery store, use could use just Brown gravy mix). You use part off the concentrated onion soup for the hamburger mix. I then combined the leftover onion soup, with the gravy mix with the rest of the recipes ingredients.  and poured over the parties in the aluminum foil lined and covered banking dish. Served with streamed cauliflower with cheese sauce.  Easy & delish!

This was excellent! Although the directions read to brown the patties on both sides depending on the thickness of the patties you will have to simmer more than 20 minutes to make sure they are done. This process does keep them from drying out. I doubled the recipe and next time will use a bit less ketchup.  We loved it though! Yum!!

Update: Made as written and using the can of French onion soup resulted in a nice brown sauce, unlike the orange color I previously experienced. I still think it needs the can of mushroom soup which also gives more delicious sauce to drizzle over side dishes. Original review: I totally agree with the previous reviewer saying it’s unfair to make numerous changes to a recipe then give it a low rating. However, sometimes I make changes based on what I have on hand and I like to see if anyone else may have tried these changes. For instance, I did not have any French onion soup and I wondered if anyone made it with a packet of Lipton soup mix instead (and found several comments about how it worked out for them). Changes I made: I sprinkled 1/2 a packet of onion soup mix with 2 oz of water and 1/2 of a finely chopped onion to the meat mixture. For the sauce, I used the full 1/4 cup of ketchup but I will reduce it next time. I also added a can of cream of mushroom soup and 2 cups of water, which I will also do again. The sauce turned out to be kind of an orange color instead of a deep brown but I don’t think it was off putting.

I used dry Lipton Onion soup mix and beef broth in place of the soup. Added a little bit of garlic powder to meat mixture and gravy. I also used prepared mustand in place of the dry mustard. Didn't measure, just eyeballed it and added the ketchup, mustard, and worschershire sauce and tasted it. I also used cornstarch to thicken gravy instead of the flour. Finished product was delicious.

I have made this recipe several times and as  always per recipe the first time. I am rating  this recipe as written and it is delicious. As we all tend to do when making such a simple great dish I vary it and have in many different ways. This recipe is great as written and always great with my variations. Having said that I would never give my variation then give it a five star rating. I would be rating my recipe not the posted one.

So ladies, please rate recipe as written and then list  changes you've  made. Or post your own Salisbury steak recipe.  It would be more helpful to less experienced cooks.

Very tasty!  The "gravy" has a surprise tangy-ness to it. I would recommend making a little more if you're serving with potatoes or everyone likes a lot of sauce (like me).  Those who aren't fans of the sauce may find the patty by itself a little bland.

I made this into 1" meatballs instead and sided with brussel sprouts and rosemary potatoes. I cut the ketchup in half, and I am glad I did but overall it was a great recipe! Be careful with the salt. The soup is already salty enough, adding some to the meat was almost too much.

Quick. Freezer/pantry meal.  I made soup from half an envelope of Lipton's Onion.  Split proportions of that according to the recipe.  Used about half the ketchup because of reviews.  Added fresh sliced mushrooms to the pan for 3 minutes before adding the gravy to simmer.

Hubs and I both liked it a lot.  Going on the dinner rotation, and I'll stock some of the French Onion Soup in the pantry now.

Thanks for a great recipe.

Came out very tasty, didn't hold their shape for what ever reason, might have been I had to use gluten free, still very yummy

Didn't get as much sauce out of this, I'll double everything other than the meat next time

Very good recipe. Economical meal. Fast and simple to prepare. The sauce/gravy has a tangy sweet taste as opposed to a roux-based brown “stew” gravy taste. Good comfort food dish.

Thank you so much for this recipe! It was delicious.  After reading the reviews before making it, I did add and change a couple of things.  I have a family of six, so for the meat patties I used 2lbs of lean ground beef, I sautéed 1/2 cup of finely chopped onion and one clove of garlic in 1 tablespoon of butter, 1 can of French onion soup,  and followed everything else.  I then formed the patties (was able to make 9)and put themin the fridge for about a 1/2 hour.  
I  cooked the beef patties in a frying pan just searing them on both sides ( I had no trouble with the meat falling apart) then placed the patties in a 13x9 baking dish and preheated the oven to 375 degrees, using the same pan that I cooked the patties in, I sautéed a large container of mushrooms, in another pan I made the gravy by  adding  1 packet of organic brown gravy mix, 1 cup water, 2 cans of French onion soup, 1 can of organic cream of mushroom soup, regular amount of ketchup, doubled the worschestire sauce and mustard powder, I didn't add any flour or salt since the brown gravy packet already had corn starch and seasoning in it, brought it all to a boil, then added my sautéed mushrooms to it, poured the gravy mixture over the patties, placed in the oven covered with foil for 40 min.  We love gravy so I was glad I doubled that. I served the Salisbury steaks with mashed potatoes, corn and broccoli.  My husband and kids loved it and I plan on making this again and again.

instead of using french onion soup I used Lipton Onion Soup Mix and I also sauteed some onion and bell pepper and added it to the gravy along with meat and let it simmer for 20 mins on medium and it was really good and the family enjoyed it as well definitely recommend it to anyone.

This was really good and great flavor, but I thought it needed more sauce.  Next time I’ll try with mushroom soup extra onions.

I think this recipe is perfect as presented but I can’t make gravy and I didn’t have all the right ingredients. Some folks get annoyed when you modify recipes; if that’s you then stop reading. First, I bought the best low fat ground beef that I could find. I doubled my ingredients and made 8 patties.  I used a dried pack of onion soup mix and also added a chopped medium sized onion because we really like onions.  And I also added about a 1/4 cup of spicy mustard because it seemed like a good idea at the time. We like our hamburger meat cooked well done, so after frying the patties, I baked them for 45 minutes on 375 in the oven. My gravy always turns out a disaster, so I chose to use 2 packs of McCormicks brown gravy mix, a package of dried onion soup, and a can of cream of mushroom soup mixed with 3 or 4 cups of water (I didn’t use a measure) and then heated to a low boil until it thickened up.  That’s a lot of gravy.  After the steaks came out of the oven, I dropped them in the gravy and served them with instant potatoes and a side of green beans that I’d cooked all day with salt pork. Everybody loved it and came back for seconds. This is on my top ten list.

The baseline for the recipe is a good starting point. I followed a few of the other reviews & tweaked it a little. I did sauté off some onions ,garlic & portobello mushrooms first. Also I used ground venison : mixed in 1/2 pkg of roasted garlic & onion soup mix with the (Italian)bread crumbs ,egg & pepper.

It was very good. I cook for a veterans home and I served this recipe. They loved it. My only suggestion would be to add garlic powder and salt to the recipe.

Will definitely make it again - was a big hit with the hubby, a meat-and-potatoes guy.  if you like lots of gravy (and are not calorie counting), I would double the gravy recipe. We were fine just as the recipe states.

Excellent! Reduced to four servings as I only had one pound of ground beef. I couldn't find condensed french onion soup ANYWHERE, so I substituted dried onion soup mix (roasted garlic onion version). One third of the package into the meat mixture with a bit of water and the rest I made into a gravy with the rest of the water and added all of the mentioned ingredients. I always add extra veggies into my meat mixture to get more into the meal, so I added onions and mushrooms. Be sure to cut them finely because they kind of made the patties fall apart a bit from being too big. Did them on the stovetop as indicated and they turned out perfectly. Will definitely make again and will keep hunting for that condensed soup!

Yum, I made this with ground turkey.  I added a can of Golden Mushroom soup with the French Onion soup.  I also added sauteed onions and Portabello mushrooms to the gravy mixture.  I added a dash of ketchup instead of the 1/4 cup.  Turned out amazing!  Served it with Scalloped potatoes (to satisfy cheese craving) and some corn.

Accidentally poured the entire can of soup into the meat mixture. So I added chicken stock in place of the soup for the sauce. Cooked at 350 for 45 minutes and it turned out delicious!

I love this dish and will make it again..i didn't make many changes just took a few suggestions.  Added cream of mushroom soup and lipton onion soup mix which made plenty of delicious gravy.  I had so much gravy left that I froze some to use at a later time.  Great dish and I will definitely make this again!!

Amount of soup in ground beef too much- patties wouldn't hold together when cooking.  Needs more bread crumbs, too.  Flavor profile was not at all like Salisbury Steak should taste.  This was tangy, more like a bbq undertone.   When the sauce was simmered with the patties, it turned into a hamburger soup because the patties fell apart.  Used 85/15 ground chuck for this, too.  Won't make again.

Was craving comfort food on a cold, wet evening and found this recipe. I did not have a can of French onion soup, but I did have a can of beef broth and a package of onion soup mix.  This substitution worked well.  I followed the recipe pretty close beyond there with the exception of the amount of ketchup. I  didn't want it to have that sweet, ketchup taste. I did not measure but squirted a bit into the pan. (maybe 2-3 tbsp.?) Anyway, in the end it was delicious.  It did not however make enough gravy to go over potatoes or noodles, etc. We did not have anything but the meat patties, but if you are looking forward to having gravy to pour over something else then you will want to double the recipe.  My family really liked this dinner (they all asked for seconds!). I gave it 4 stars due to the fact that it doesn't make enough gravy. The flavor was good, but it was not enough even to cover the patties.

The steaks were very good, but the gravy was not. Next time I will just make brown gravy.

Rating the recipe made as-is with only two minor revisions: I didn't have condensed soup so I used Lipton onion soup mix and 10.5oz of water (made ahead) and panko bread crumbs because that's what I had. 

The patties held together fine: the secret is to use medium high heat and flip them only once before adding the sauce: the patties should have a crisp crust when you flip them the first time and again on the second side before you add the sauce. Do that, and they'll keep their structure. 

The sauce was kid-friendly, which is to say tangy and flavourful without being too strong or complex. That bring said I enjoyed it too. I would definitely consider adding mushrooms and/or sauteed onions if I were making this for adults.

Made it exactly as written (except for number of servings). Family liked it a lot (mom and I loved it), it is going in the weekly dinner recipe book. 
Had enough leftover for lunch for two more days. It was just as good on those days also.

It went over well with the family though I did use I one package of dry onion soup mix and mixed that in with the other ingredients for the meat. Used the entire can of the French onion soup for the sauce. Along with a can of golden mushroom soup. And added a little bit of heavy cream to the sauce to time down the tang. Will do it again for sure!

This was super tasty! I will definitely be making this again! Did the recipe as instructed.  The only things I will do differently next time would be adding a bit more water or some beef stock to the gravy, as it was a bit thick. And I'll add mushrooms to the gravy. Great as is though!

This recipe is absolutely wonderful! I added sauteed mushrooms as seen in the picture.  Follow directions exactly and do not add bullion or any more salt. It will be seasoned perfectly after simmering.

I made this almost exactly by recipe using ground sirloin.   After browning in cast iron skillet,  I made gravy mix,  covered,  and baked in 350 oven for 30 minutes.  Very tender and juicy.   We did not care for the gravy, but it wasn't bad.  Next time, I will use my own brown gravy mix.

I added cream of mushroom soup and used frozen meatballs as I didn't have time to thaw meat to make the patties.
We liked it but I think it would be better making the patties.

This was super easy.  The condensed French Onion soup really makes this dish.  I used 1 lb of ground beef adjusting the patty ingredients accordingly.  It made 4 oval patties about 3/4 thick and 5 inches long.  I made the gravy mixture as directed.  It made plenty of gravy to spoon over freshly made mashed potatoes.  Yum! My preference would be to use JUST slightly less ketchup as  the gravy had more tomato taste than I prefer.  The Worcestershire sauce gave it a nice zing.

I only did 2 things different. I pureed half an onion and added it to the mix. I then cooked them 3 at a time in my george foreman grill. It made really awesome grill marks and because I sprayed it with non-stick spray they were super easy to get out, even though they were a little mushy to begin with. Oh, and I did do the aluminum pan baking thing. These came out amazing!!

Bob changed it up a bit and precooked and then cut up sirloin. It was served over homemade mashed baby reds! It has quickly become one of my comfort foods! YUM!  10/23/2017 Side note: We had just come home from the hospital. I had laproscopic knee surgery!

Too much ketchup for me.  Easy to make and the meat had a good flavor.  If I make it again I will likely eliminate the ketchup altogether and use mushroom soup and mushrooms like so many of the other reviews.

I made this recipe exactly as it is written and thought it was okay, but it needs some oomph.  Next time I will add chopped onions and garlic and maybe some mushrooms.

Very good and easy recipe overall. Two suggestions on execution: 
1. Use a large egg rather than extra large. Ex lrg egg makes patties too soft.
2. Brown the flour in the fat rather than mix it with liquid ingredients, as this gives the sauce a bit more depth.

The French Onion soup overpowered the dish and it was too sweet and too salty.  The MSG in the French Onion soup gives me a four hour headache.  I will NOT make it again.

Very good! I haven't had Salisbury Steak in years and this was just what the Dr. ordered. The sauce was so good I'll double up on it next time so as to put it over mashed potatoes in lieu of standard gravy.

One of our favorites!! Made it just as stated, but made with extra gravy (using the instructions) as my kids are gravy freaks! The entire family loved it and so, I keep this as a regular on my monthly menu.

I did not have condensed French onion soup so I used 2 packets of onion soup with 20 ounces of water and 1 can of cream of mushroom soup.  My family loves gravy and this made double the amount and it was still all used between the Salisbury steak and mashed potatoes.

Kudos to you for sharing this recipe! I took the really lazy way out and used packaged gravy...but OMG!! Those patties were melt in your mouth! I know I know..lots of exclamation marks..but soooo deserved. I think I will use the same ingredients next time I make burgers. Very yum!!

THIS IS SO GOOD!!!! Ahhhh!!!! I love it!!! I made two alterations ONLY because Aldi doesn't sell canned condensed French onion soup, so I use French onion soup mix. And I left out the mustard powder because I just don't keep it on hand. I had to double the recipe the second time I made it because the first time we ate it all and everyone wanted more! I make this in my very seasoned iron skillet. They come out so tasty. Oh so good. Yummmmm.

This was AMAZING!!!!  My mom said this was full of flavor!!! The best she had. No tweaking needed. Very moist. I like the idea of adding Tri colored peppers. Also the idea of putting it over egg noodles, but this was perfect the way it is!

turned out well.  my whole family enjoyed it.  I didn't put the mustard ingredient in but still good.  lastly my skillet was to small so I browned the patties then finished their cooking in the oven at 350.

It tastes exactly like it should, given the ingredients.  Prepare for the gravy to taste like ketchup and Worcestershire sauce - don't expect it to magically mellow down into simple savory beefiness.  If you like the sour-ish flavors of the ingredients, you will love this.

I have a Gluten allergy, so I modified this recipe so that I could enjoy it...and it worked beautifully. 
I started out frying 2 large onions sliced thin in 1/4 cup real butter. Salt the onions to bring out the flavor. After they're cooked soft, I add 1 cup hot water with 2 beef bullion cubes and 1 teaspoon Worcester sauce. Boil just until cubes are dissolved.  I substitute this for canned French onion. I followed the rest of this recipe substituting Gluten free bread crumbs and flour that are easy to find. Delish!

I am 17 and my mom is too sick to cook. I'm not the best at cooking and I like recipes that are easy to follow. This is very easy and simple and it tasted really great. I made the recipe as is and I cooked it on the stove as directed. I really liked the sauce. I like spicy food so I did add Tabasco and cayenne pepper to the sauce. But this was really good and I will make it again.

I loved making this.  As much as I don't like people who alter recipes...I had to because my girls  don't like onions or mushrooms.  So, I used Beef Broth instead of the soup and I added some brown gravy mix to give it the color.  But I love this recipe because I could use it as a starting point.  And it was a hit!! The next time I make it I'm using the mushrooms and onion soup...just because I want to make it as is.  Don't be afraid to tweak it...it is GREAT!!!! (oh, I happened to have the mustard powder, but I'm sure you could use just mustard, too.  Just keep tasting as you make it.)

I followed other reviewers suggestions for the gravy and it turned out well. I made the patties small so they were easy to cook. Also added sautéed fresh mushrooms at the end - a nice touch. My family loved it!

This is very yummy but I have to say I subbed Cabernet wine for Worcestershire sauce and that was absolutely delicious! I would recommend DOUBLING the sauce recipe since there was barely enough. If you want gravy for mashed potatoes then yes double it

This was absolutely delicious and didn't last long.  This was my first time making it, and I added mushrooms to the gravy.  My husband usually grabs the ketchup when I make salisbury steak, but not this time.  This is now my favorite recipe.

The original recipe was not enough gravy (or enough flavor) so I  added a can of cream of mushroom soup to the gravy and doubled the gravy except for the soups and ketchup and so glad i did. It gave the perfect amount! I did add sauteed mushrooms and onions, also added dry onion soup but it was too much onions and I don't recommend that part.

I've never had Salisbury steak, but remember looking at congealed and greasy offerings of it in grade school and college. I passed on to the other option...
Well, I had 2lbs of ground beef to use and wanted a quick dinner. I had to alter this recipe a little bit because I am gluten free, but let me say this will be a quick and easy dinner staple in my home now!
I used two packets of dry french onion soup, and while it was delicious it came out a little too salty. One packet wouldn't have been enough- so between a third and half of the second will be tested next time.
Because I did not have the condensed onion soup, I substituted with Progresso's cream of mushroom (GFree!) instead.
I used cornmeal as breadcrumbs, and had stuck them in my little food processer to get a slightly finer texture. I put in some spices (we use seasoned), and two eggs to bind the hamburger patties.
While they were browning in the pan, I chopped some mushrooms and popped red potatoes in the microwave... drained off the grease, put in the rest of the soup-gravy recipe  (we love Worcestershire sauce so i added more) with the mushrooms and let it simmer.
I made smashed garlic potatoes and boy this dinner really hit the spot of comfort food which was quick, easy, AND gluten free. My dad thinks GFree is gross- but he had two helpings!! We didn't tell him otherwise!

Tasty and easy to make. I baked it in the oven at 400 degrees for 20 minutes and they came out nice and juicy. Will definitely make it again.

I pretty much stuck to the recipe but used beef broth instead of the French onion soup and added some Lipton onion soup mix. Delish!!

Made this tonight and it was awesome sauce. My hubs requested it for dinner. Wanted to buy it frozen. Shut the front door. I'm not eating that frozen . Especially since I've never had. I looked up this recipe and it was a total hit with all of my family. Would definitely recommend this recipe. When we were shopping for the ingredients. My hubs asked for the big can of French Onion Soup (family sized). So, I doubled the amount of flour, mustard and Worcestershire sauce. Not ketchup. We loved having the extra gravy for our mash potatoes. Thanks again for sharing and keeping me from eating the frozen version.

The flavor was really good. I would have given it five stars, but it didn't produce as much gravy as I would have liked. I was expecting what was shown in the picture. Instead, I had to make additional gravy on the side.

I didn't have the condensed French Onion soup,  so I doubled the meat, and all other ingredients. Also used regular mustard. I did not add the water, but I added some bouillon. All in all, it turned out nicely.

Followed the recipe. The meat is fine but that sauce is inedible. Seriously. It's disgusting. How this recipe got so many stars is beyond me. I was expecting like a rich dark gravy kind of taste and this just tastes like ketchup with mustard spice. Do not use this sauce recipe. It's horrible.

This recipe is amazing. I did add a few things. Just sautéed some onions to put on top. Also I added a can of cream of mushroom and dry onion soup as others have suggested. This is definitely a keeper. My husband, 4 year old, and mom all have COMPLETELY clean plates. That never happens in our home.... especially because my kid refuses to eat anything but candy lol.

this is a simple and tasty recipe. there are many modifications anyone can ( and will) make according to their own personal preference.  I make a similar recipe at my house, using , as others have , cream of mushroom soup and dry onion  soup mix. I have never put ketchup in my salsbury steak so I had to try this as is. It was okay. my family didn't complain, and it was all gone, and I did dbl the gravy. but they were not too impressed.  they perfered the way I make it. but thanks for the recipe, it is a change up I will use  every once in a while.

Taking from the reviews of others I added/omitted to the recipe.  Isn't that what helps a recipe grow and improve!  

I left out the ketchup, mustard, salt and pepper.  Used Garlic and Herb bread crumbs, egg and 1/3 can French Onion Soup.  Browned patties and transferred to crock pot on low.  In a different pan sauteed an onion and sliced mushrooms in butter then poured on top of the meat.  Added more butter to pan and made a rue.  Added the rest of the French onion soup, 1/2 of a mini bottle of Chardonnay, can of Cream of Mushroom soup and milk until I liked the texture and taste.  Left in crock pot on low for three hours and served over brown rice with fresh green beans.  AMAZING!!!!!!  Yes my patties crumbled a bit, yes it took a bit of work but I think this is the best meal that I have ever cooked.  I am adding it to the rotation.

Love this recipe.  It's definitely a keeper!! No need to make any changes, but I did add sliced mushrooms during the last 20 minutes.  Using 93% ground beef, there was no need to pour out the extra fat, there wasn't any!

I served it with Yukon gold potatoes fork-mashed in the pan with S&P, butter and sour cream.  There was plenty of sauce left to use on the spuds!

DEEEELicious!  I followed another review and used lipton's onion soup mix with one beef bouillon cube (in lieu of the canned french onion soup, still used everything else).  I also doubled the sauce.  This was perfect with mashed potatoes and corn on the cob.  Tastes better the next day!

The steaks were excellent but I did not like the gravy's consistency. The gravy turned out very thin and even so there wasn't enough to cover 6 steaks.  I would definitely double the gravy recipe and try adding 2 cans of cream of mushroom as others suggest.

Good. Never seen or ever heard of a can of French Onion Soup however. Use onion soup mix & 2c water, then hold the salt! Add med onion fine chop to the beef. Fry patties in bacon fat or 3 TBS Crisco for flavour; drain, but first sautée some shrooms. Deglaze pan w sherry/red wine. Double the gravy ingreds but omit ketchup. Dissolve a bouillon cube or 2  in hot water to increase. Add a splash of sherry. Thicken gravy with corn starch slurry vs flour; adjust seasonings. The oven is unnecessary. 
Serve with boiled potatoes and green beans.

Definitely 5 stars! My family LOVED it! The only changes I made were I deglazed the pan after browning the meat with a little dry red wine, and added a little more to the sauce.  Next time, I am going to double the sauce because it is soooo good! This one is a keeper!!!!

Family enjoyed will make the patties smaller maybe a burger size next time and make more sauce. I didn't add the mushroom because we don't  like them but French onion soup was a good  sauce..

I could have done without the added salt. The French Onion soup made it salty enough.

The only change I made was instead of dry bread crumbs, I used three slices of bread with crust removed dissolved  I into 1/2 cup of cold water. Leave it sit for 10 mins then beat with a fork to combine. I do the same for meatballs and the meat comes out so tender and juicy, never dry or hard.  When I make it again I may use less Worcestershire sauce and french onion soup in the sauce. It was very good but a little more tart than I expected. I might saute some fresh onions to go along with the french onion soup and add a little water. It did thicken quite a bit after 20 mins of simmering so a little water wouldn't hurt maybe 1/2 cup. I'm used to Salisbury steak being more like a beef gravy, maybe I've just never had the real thing... Overall it was very good and I'll make it again. My 4 year old even liked it (except for the onions) so we'll definitely try it again soon!

I made this recipe exactly as written, I won't rate a grossly modified recipe, I think it's ridiculous to rate a recipe that has been changed so much it doesn't even resemble the original. That being said this recipe was pretty good. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the ketchup taste was a tad strong. Next time I will use less. I'll probably do a few minor changes next time I make it. But, as is it's very good and has made it in the weekly rotation.

This is an easy, quick and delish meal.  By far the BEST Salisbury Steak recipe.  I altered the recipe a bit by reducing the amount of ketchup as my fiancé does not like ketchup and omitted mustard powder as I did not have any on hand.  I also added a can of mushroom soup.  I will definitely make this dish again and again!

This turned out really well. I did make a couple of minor changes - I added a can of cream of mushroom soup and a packet of Lipton Beefy Onion soup mix. My patties held together just beautifully on the stove, and just enough gravy for patties and mashed potatoes. Big hit with the family - will definitely make again!

I'd say it was a hit. I added a can of mushrooms to the gravy and served with mashed potatoes and green beans. I think next time I'll double the gravy. Otherwise it was spot on!!!

This salisbury steak was great! Made for a routine weekday dinner as a new meal to shake things up a bit. The "steaks" were tender and the sauce came out creamy and delish.  I read others reviews and took advice that several reviewers gave- added condensed cream of mushroom soup. I wasn't sure how much mushroom soup to add so I put in approximately half of the 10.5 oz can then added a little more water for better consistency. My husband and I tasted the sauce and agreed it needed more beef flavor so I opted for a beef bullion cube and it did the trick. The meal turned out great, patties stayed together nicely and I topped it with sautéed mushrooms and onions for serving with an easy side of mac & cheese. We had leftovers and my son crumbled and mixed it into the mac & cheese for the next night's for dinner. When I make this again, I will combine the liquid sauce ingredients with the flour in the warmed pan (will take steaks out temporarily) so the flour dissolves more easily, I really had to work it this go round to get rid of the flour lumps. Thanks for posting this easy and tasty dinner!

Excellent. I made mine gluten free using Pacific brand GF french onion soup in a carton and tapioca starch for flour replacement. Also I used GF bread crumbs in my ground beef mix. I sauteed  with some butter fresh mushrooms, green peppers, and onions before browning meat patties, then pulled the veggies out to brown meat and added back when I put in rest of soup. Delish. Family loved it. Thank you.

I only gave a 4 because I was out of french onion soup and had to wing it a little - used onion soup mix, put half in the meat and half in the sauce.  I tweaked the meat a little due to taste as well, added garlic and put Worcestershire in the meat in addition to the sauce.  Also sauteed up half an onion before cooking the patties, then added them back to the sauce part.  It is a little heavy on the ketchup for our taste, but does take me back to my Mom making this when I was a kid.  Had this with mashed potatoes and asparagus that we canned last season.

I have made this recipe many times. My entire family loves it. The only thing I sometimes do differently is (since occasionally the patties will break apart) I just bake them!

Aaaaaaamazing!!! I did take some of the advice to use Cream of Mushroom soup and onion soup  mix. I also browned them and then cooked them in the oven at 375 for 45 minutes. One of my family's faves!! I also double the whole recipe. Believe it or not, the leftovers are even better!!

This was delicious!! I preferred it with the addition of Cream of Mushroom soup and Onion Soup mix, as recommended in another review. This will definitely make it into the comfort food rotation! Yum!

''This recipe is delicious! I followed the advice of some other reviewers, and changed the sauce. The meat was done verbatim to the recipe, but I used the Lipton onion mushroom mix, and made per the instructions. Added the remainder of the french onion soup and about 1/2 tsp of Worcestershire sauce. Simmered for about 20 more minutes and these were really tasty Salisbury steaks!

Did not make any changes other than a dash of some red pepper flakes. An easy dish, flavorful and filling!! Great for Moms that have little time for prep. Served it with some new potatoes and spinach!! Delish!!

Excellent !! I doubled the recipe for the sauce only using 1/4 cup of ketchup overall. I used dry white wine in place of the water, and I added fresh sliced mushrooms and sliced onions.  Very very good!

The patties were good but I didn't care for the ketchup and mustard powder in the gravy, I might try it again without those two ingredients.

At first I was questioning the sweetness (ketchup) taste of the sauce but after it cooked these were amazing.
Served in with oven roasted baby potatoes and rice. This is definitely getting added to our go recipe list

Added a can of cream of mushroom soup and skipped the ketchup.  It was good, a little salty. I'll make again and lessen the the French Onion soup in the meat to 1/4 instead of 1/3.

The steaks were delicious. The gravy was ehh...I think if I tripled the gravy it would be fine. Maybe next time I'll just make regular gravy though.

My family LOVED this.  My husband and I used to buy the frozen salisbury steak  entrees many years ago.  In my opinion, this was an excellent recipe.  I sauteed  fresh mushrooms in butter, threw them in with the sauce and served with mashed potatoes and string beans.  Definitely a keeper!

I see so many ratings where changes were made - if you change the recipe how can you give it a bad rating?? Or any rating at all - I made this according to the actual recipe and it turned out great - I made no changes so my rating is actually on the recipe - not what I changed it into - I just think if your rating a recipe you should actually make the recipe as written - just common sense.

Absolutely terrible. Followed the recipe to the letter and all of my sauce just burnt to the bottom of the pan regardless of how much I stirred it. Because  there was no sauce, we basically had hamburger patties that had the flavor of an old foot.  What a wreck.

We really liked this.  I had to make 2 substitutions.  I did not have the onion soup but did have beef consommé, so used that instead.  I probably should have sautéed some onions to make it closer to the original recipe.  I also used evaporated milk in place of the soup in the beef patties.  I had made a similar recipe using that in the past.  In doing that I had enough left over sauce to put over mashed potatoes.  Added peas and had a complete winter comfort dinner.

Used 1 pound of ground sirloin, chopped 1/2 white onion, and 3 cloves of garlic, egg, bread crumbs, salt and pepper.  I made 5 patties. Then I made the rue for brown gravy with fat and fond from cooking patties, 2 tblsp butter with about 1/3 cup flour, and 1 cup of beef broth.

I used some of the tips for the gravy like the cream of mushroom soup and dry onion soup additions, I also added 1 medium sauteed onion and sauteed a package of baby Bella mushrooms and mixed them in with the gravy.  Also baked it in the oven covered at 375 for 45 minutes as was recommended.  My boyfriend and one year old son loved it.  This gets added to the make again list for sure.

I made this tonight. Huge hit.   Only modifications - no ketchup and made extra gravy.   We had no leftovers.  Both kids, including my very picky 10 year old, loved it. She even told me I have to make it again.   That gets 5 stars!

I made the patties exactly how the directions said but I followed another reviewers suggestion and made the Lipton Onion Soup gravy instead of the one listed above. I made them on the stovetop and browned them and then put them in the oven with the gravy on top for 30 minutes. My kids loved it and we all practically licked our plates. I will make this again.

I liked this recipe a lot but my husband thought that I needed to back off on the Worcestershire sauce.  It was a little over powering to the recipe.  Other than that, it was perfect.

I made it the first time as is and next time will make a few changes.
My husband did love the first attempt. I think I need more binder because the patties fell apart. and less ketchup. Sauce was too tangy and red for me.

I made the Salisbury steak patties according to the recipe. They did fall apart a bit, but came out pretty good. If I made this again, I'd probably add a bit more salt and pepper and maybe garlic to the ground beef. After reading the reviews, I decided not to use the recipe for the sauce. I used mushroom gravy and added sliced sautéed baby bella mushrooms. Thanks for the recipe:)

I make this a couple times a month. 
I make the Patties the way the recipe says. 
The only thing I do different is the gravy/sauce? What ever you want to call it.  I double the soup.  That is all and 
it is Fantastic.   If salt is needed. I let people add their own. 
Usually, it doesn't need it.

This recipe is a hit with everyone! The only thing I change in the recipe was adding more dry gravy mix in. I highly recommend this recipe among anyone who loves salisbury steak. It is great to eat with mashed potatoes or with rice as a delicious.

I used one pound of ground sirloin to make this recipe, so I had to adjust this quite a bit, but it worked out well.  I did add some garlic powder to the meat mixture and I substituted wine for the water as other reviewers suggested.  I also added some mushrooms that needed to be used up.  This was good and Hubs liked it a lot, but I didn’t care for the ketchup in this.  It contributed a slightly sweet flavor to the gravy that I didn’t care for.  Even though this one wasn’t for me, I’m glad I tried it.

I made exactly as suggested. Changed nothing. Rated 2 stars because it isn't anything like I thought it would be. The catchup makes it alot more like a meatloaf. Tasted very similar as well. The gravy had a yellow color. Not the color of a typical salsbury steak. The taste wasn't awful if you like meat loaf.  It's just ok. Won't try again.

Followed the recommendation of adding cream of mushroom soup and brown gravy packet  (mixed with 2 cups of water) to gravy mixture. Family said quote "Add to list of repeat meals". It was really good.

This is definitely a keeper, my family loved it. I made the gravy following the recipe, which is very good on it's own, then added sauteed mushrooms and onions to the pan while the patties and gravy cooked.

This is one of my favorite go to recipes. A few years ago I was thinking about the Salisbury steak TV dinners I used to have when I was little so I looked up recipes and found this one. I stick it with slight variations on amounts of ingredients as I usually eyeball it. All and all easy and tastey!

AllRecipes is always the first site that pops up in my search for new recipes. I've done quite a few and they have been wonderful! I had never made Salisbury steak before and thought that it would be ok. Looking at the ingredients, I thought that the ketchup was a strange thing. Needless to say... it will be omitted next time! Haha I think I'll play with the spices too.

I've made it twice, once with ground beef, double sauce, and it was great, then I tried making it with ground turkey, amazingly it turned out really well! My son-in-law raved about it and that's high praise for me! I did forget to double the sauce and I missed that but no one else cared , there was enough to go around.

The patties were great. But I didn't care for the sauce with the ketchup. My next batch I added 2 more 10oz cans of the condensed soup to the meat, and instead of ketchup i used another can of the condensed soup. THAT tasted more like salisbury steak.

This was great. I followed instructions as is, but only used half the ketchup. I also sautéed some sliced mushrooms in the pan juices before adding back the meat and liquid. Easy and Delicious!

I love meatloaf but have not had any success.  This is  a perfect substitute and it is delicious!!!  I add a can of Golden Mushroom soup to the gravy that is poured on the top and  stuff these little gems with feta cheese for a twist.  Yum ++

Made this tonight. Only change I made -instead of pepper I used Montreal Steak Seasoning. The gravy was wonderful in the steak and mashed potatoes. GREAT recipe. My Dad said it was the best steak he'd had in a while!  Already looking forward to leftovers tomorrow night!!  Added this one to my favorites!  Will definitely make again.

No changes needed! Followed recipe exactly and it was delicious!!!  (Scraping gravy out of the pan before washing delicious). A great meat and potatoes,one pan meal, without the heat of the oven.   Try it first without altering!!!  This will be made often in our house!!!

Very good! I didn't have the canned french onion soup so I used dry packet of french onion soup with two cups of water and omitted the ketchup.  I chopped onions and browned them in olive oil and added them to mixture, then browned the patties in that same skillet.  (I'm going to buy a can of french onion soup and try that next time, but still add the browned onions.)  Browned in skillet then baked in oven.  Very good!

I've made this recipe twice now. Once as directed and once adding a can of cream of mushroom soup. Either way is delicious and easy to prepare. If you use the mushroom soup be sure to whisk it separately and then whisk it into the liquids slowly so it doesn't have lumps.

I liked the taste of the patties, but I didn't have enough sauce to cover them. I thought the sauce was too sweet for my taste. Also I love sliced mushrooms with my salisbury steaks and this doesn't call for any. :( I may make again but it will need some tweaking.

I've never made Salisbury steak before, and this was a very easy copycat recipe. My husband and 4yo daughter enjoyed it. My changes were having a little less than 1lb of meat, used seasoned stuffing rather than bread crumbs, omitted the mustard powder, and made my gravy like a southerner (doubled recipe, thicker, and used the grease drippings from the "steaks"). Fried the meat patties, cooked thoroughly then set aside to rest. Topped them with the hot gravy as we made our plates. Likely, I will attempt a more traditional Salisbury steak recipe next time the craving calls , but this one has been added to the family recipe rolladex, anticipating my daughter's to want easy beginner recipes in their teen years.

The Salisbury steak is good (hence the 2 stars) but the gravy is hideous. I dumped it and started all over it was so bad. I suggest using an alternative Salisbury steak gravy recipe because you will be sorely disappointed if you make the one with this recipe.

I made this tomight and doubled the recipe.  My husband told me it was so delicious the whole time he was eating it!  the WHOLE TIME!  I did add beef bouillon granules, and thinly sliced onions to the gravy, and quadrupled the other gravy ingredients.  But, other than that, I kept it the same.  Very good.  He wants to know why I have not made this in the past 35 years.  I don't know, but I'll be adding this to our favorites and serve it at least once a month.

Pleasantly surprised by this recipe!  It was very easy and didn't take a lot of clean-up, which is HUGE for me! Next time I'll try some of the gravy suggestions and minimize the amount of ketchup I use... that's more of a personal/family preference rather than a criticism.  I may also make minor modifications on the steaks to add a bit more flavor to the meat.  Overall, I was very happy with how the meal turned out.  The meat was nicely cooked and held together well, while maintaining juice and flavor.  I will definitely make this meal again.

This was excellent!  So much better than the frozen salisbury steak!  My whole family loved it!  It will be put into our weekly rotation.  Quick & simple & tasty.  I did double the sauce as suggested by others and I served over home made mashed potatoes with fresh corn.

This is my go-to recipe for Salisbury steak. It's so easy to make and taste delish. However tonight to appease my small children I made meatballs instead of patties and used Whataburger spicy ketchup in the sauce. It was AMAZING! Served over some mashed cauliflower yummm Mom and kids were happy :)

Followed recipe  and added 2 cloves of garlic to the ground beef  mixture and doubled the sauce. My husband and picky 10 year old couldn't get enough of this.  Asked if I could make it more often.  Yummy!

Like other reviewers stated--'it can't be 5 stars if you tweaked it' sooooo...I used panko in the meat, as some others did and also added crunchy french onions. I really cheated and used jar gravy and added mushrooms. I appreciated the recipe as a start for me to make it my own--my family LOVES it! That is what matters most.

Made this recipe as is and it was DELICIOUS!! A must have with my family. The meat was tender and melted in our mouth. We used the lean beef, 93%. For sides we had to have mashed potatoes and corn. Def some great down home cooking here!

Made this with ground sirloin and added a can of Cream Of Mushroom soup for the gravy.  I also used Panko bread crumbs. It was perfect!  Patties stayed together very well.  Will definitely make it again!

Made this exactly like directions stated. SUPER SWEET. If I make this again I would not use ketchup at all and would add something to add a more savory flavor.

Today I couldn't figure out what to make for dinner, and I had all the ingredients so I thought I would try this recipe, Like some other reviewers, the patties turned out alright, but there was way too much of a ketchup taste. If I do make it again, I will cut back or cut out the ketchup. I hate to waste food, so it will get eaten, but I will stick to a crockpot recipe I have instead.

This recipe is a fan favorite in my home and will be for years. I can see my girls coming home from college requesting this dish when they get older. We absolutely love it and I usually make it at least once a month. I add cream of mushroom soup to make more gravy.

The meat turned out really good.  The gravy tasted like chemicals.  The mix of ketchup and canned soup I think was a bad combo.  I had company coming over so I was scrambling to find a replacement gravy.

This was not bad. I added a can of Golden Mushroom Soup and used a squeeze of regular mustard in  place of the powder. Next time I make it I will omit the ketchup. I do believe it would have been awesome without the ketchup.

This was super good...especially with smashed red potatoes.  Instead of using a can of onion soup, I used a pack of soup mix and mixed it with half the water it called for.  It worked perfectly for the gravy and had great flavor.

I always think of TV dinners when I think of Salisbury steak - these are 1000 times better than those! My husband loves these things!! Idk what condensed onion soup is? I'm not sure I ever saw it before? I threw dried onion and powdered beef base (boulion) in the hamburger mix - And I made the gravy the same way w/ soup base and dried onion for the rest of the ingredients I followed the recipe- i put it in baking dish and baked for 1/2 hour. If I had dry onion soup mix I would use that too! Fabulous!

I'm trying to cook more and eat out less, so I'm always on the look-out for quick and easy week-day meal options.  This recipe fit the bill perfectly: easy to cook; ready in 30 minutes or less; and it tasted good.  I followed the recipe exactly and overall I was pleased with the results.  Next time I make it, I'll use a little less salt and double the sauce.

A very good and easy comfort meal.  I always make a recipe as written the first time. Next time, I will cut back, just a little,  on  Worcestershire  Sauce.  I will also flatten a couple patties, before cooking,  to use for sandwiches with Swiss cheese at a later date. Can't wait!

Actually would rate this 4.5. Really, really, good and quite simple. Made it with instant mashed potatoes and green beans. Turned out perfectly and will become a staple and go-to recipe. Would make no changes. Wonderful.

Great basic steps. I added my own touch by adding onion and mushrooms to the recipe. Also I doubled the amount for the gravy which worked out well. I look foward to making this many more times.

I cannot cook at all and this was my first attempt in the kitchen. I was very surprised to find I can cook dinner. It turned out great. Even for the kitchen-challenged. The only change I made was adding cream of mushroom soup to extend the gravy. Great recipe

I followed the recipe to the letter, but the patties are a little bland as is the gravy.  The gravy is a little too sweet  so I would reduce the amount of ketchup.  Also, there is not enough gravy, especially if you are serving it with sides like mashed potatoes and want some gravy on that.

I love all the suggestions to make this better. I loved it, but my patties ended up falling apart. It was big chunks of hamburger. next time I need to double the gravy.

This recipe is soooo easy and tasty! I did not make any changes except for adding fresh mushrooms to the sauce. It's  a little bit too salty for me, next time I'll add more water.

Of alllll the Salisbury Steak recipes I've tried, this is the favorite. I've made it exactly as is and loved it and now that I've made it a regular on our home menu, I'll make occasional variations depending on what's hiding in my pantry because it really is wonderfully versatile. I ALWAYS double the sauce now though just because I am a saucy kinda gal and the family likes putting it on mashed potatoes or egg noodles so we need a bit more. Try it as is then put your own spin on it if you want but it's best starting point recipe for sure.

This is delicious! I only made two changes,  instead of Worcestershire (I didn't have any) I put in one squirt of Heinz 57 sauce.  I also added some garlic and onion powder to the meat mixture. The only other thing I would suggest for next time is doubling the sauce as it does not originally make enough to put over potatoes if you would like to.  I will definitely make this again!

Only had Onion soup mix, so I mixed the packet with 1 1/2 cups water and also added a can of cream of mushroom like most reviewers suggested. I also just browned in the pan, then put in a 13x9 inch glass pan, poured the gravy over the top and tossed it in the oven. My pickiest eater devoured it and raved the entire time. Definitely a keeper with the minor adjustments in my house.

I made this for my two kids and I and it went over very well.  My daughter made a face when I told her what I was going to make and had a smile on her face while eating it.  My son (the pickiest eater on the planet) told me it was a 10 and he kept coming back for the sauce.  This recipe will fall into our regular menu.

I made the recipe as it was listed.  I have a real issue with people rating recipes based on changes they made during the process... it bothers me to no end.  Simple recipe, simple food, really good taste!

The meat was good. I had to make a gravy at he last minute. The gravy was not good. Extremely salty and did not care for the ketchup flavor. Will adjust next time.

I made this, but to the top 'most helpful' reviews specifications. 

This recipe received a lot of comments about changing it. Normally I don't modify the first time but reading them made me decide to. 

Excellent recipe, I've heard of Salisbury steak before but never had it. Plates were licked clean! Thankyou for a great recipe.

LOVE this recipe!! I followed the directions exactly and it was so good!! I've loved salisbury steak ever since I was a kid, from the frozen dinners of course since my family never made it from scratch. This recipe knocks the frozen stuff right out of the water. Definitely a keeper!

I've made this recipe several times and the family LOVES it. One thing I need to remember is to add more water to the sauce. It's too thick and never enough, so I thin it a little bit.

Great recipe. Quick and easy to make but sooo juicy!
I followed the suggestions and added some condensed cream of mushroom soup to the sauce, and cut down the ketchup a bit. I substituted the mustard powder with Dijon mustard, and added some crushed red peppers. 
I also added some chopped up garlic and onions to the beef mixture. 
The steaks held their shape well in the pan.

Loved this. The only changes I made were that I used powdered onion soup mix  (I could NOT find a can of French onion anywhere!!)  and a can of cream of mushroom. I added fresh mushrooms and followed the rest of the instructions EXCEPT:
For those of you who keep having them fall apart, an easy fix is to omit the egg. Instead soak your breadcrumbs in some milk - just enough to wet them and have them soak up the milk but not soggy - and mix that in. Works every time.

I followed this recipe and made no variations.  My family loved it.  This is my only 2nd time doing Salisbury steak but used this recipe for the first time. I highly recommend it and was simple and easy to do.

My husband has never been a fan of Salisbury steak until I made this. It is amazing. Don't let the ingredients scare you away. I doubled the gravy recipe so I would have plenty for mashed potatoes.

I doubled this and it gave me the perfect  amount.  I didn't have  any ketchup but it was just  as good, the ketchup will just add a tangy sweetness which I think already has it due to the worceshire sauce. If you want you could do cream of mushroom  instead  as well.

Great! Delicious! I added a little steak sauce to the meat mixture to give the ground beef more steak flavor and I added 1 small can of drained sliced mushrooms- seared the patties in oil, covered with gravy mixture and baked 350 for 15-20 minutes. Came out perfect! I will use this recipe for years to come! Thanks!

I didn't care for the sauce.  However, the patties are delicious. Luckily, I had a large jar of beef gravy.  I am going to remake this again and replace the ketchup (yuck!) with unsweetened tomato sauce and replace the water with a dry red wine.

It's amazing! Add another condensed soup of your choice(I used cream of mushroom) a Lipton onion soup package-so no salt! And bit more water... I sautéed onions and mushrooms while I prepared  the patties. Then brown em while mixing soup concoction and add that over top with the onions and mushroom. I even forgot to incorporate the flour-oops...no worries-I just mixed a tbls each of cornstarch and cold water, and mixed it in 10 minutes before finished. Pretty darn delish!

I made this exactly as listed and the was great.  The whole family loved it.  The sauce was a little bit "ketchup'y, but I thought that made it good.  The only thing I would change next time is to make double the sauce.  We had these "steaks" with mashed potatoes, and extra gravy is always a good thing with mashed potatoes.  I didn't have any problem with the patties falling apart, but I did put them in the fridge for about 1/2 hour because I was waiting for my potatoes to boil.  This is a great quick and good weeknight recipe.

This is one of our family favorites. I have made this recipe at least ten times and there are never any leftovers! I like extra gravy so I add another can of French Onion soup when mixing everything up and more of the ketchup, A1, mustard (actual mustard) to taste with another tablespoon of flour. If I have fresh mushrooms on hand I throw them in the pan when the patties are browning and leave them in with the sauce. I serve it with homemade mash potatoes, a veggie and corn bread muffins. Awesome recipe. P.S. I don't add any water to the sauce. We like it thick.

Yummy!!!  No changes except doubled gravy recipe and simmered meat longer.   Doesn't require any more seasoning. Flavorful and tender. Awesome with mashed potatoes. Good recipe!  Big hit!  Thanks

I made this & it wasn't very good! Lack of flavor & difficult to make... Next time I made it I omitted the canned soup (yuk) and used Knorr French onion mix (dry) & put ALL ingredients, minus the ketchup!!
Mixed well will REAL onions too!! Also added garlic powder & a pinch of onion powder!
Turned out much better!

I made this for the first time. I had a craving today and I found this recipe. I check the cupboard and had these ingredients. I added two cans of soup for the extra gravy on the potatoes. Instant classic and permanent addition to the recipe box.

I actually followed the alterations made by ALLY99 exactly with one small exception.  I used Golden Mushroom Soup instead of Cream of Mushroom Soup.  This method  definitely makes more gravy without making it bland and makes the dish better as a whole.  Finishing the steaks in the oven after browning seems to work better as well.

This Salisbury steak was a huge hit with the family! It was super easy, inexpensive to make, and definitely a new favorite at this household! The only change I make is to add prepared mustard instead of the dry.

I made this and thought from the reviews that it would be great.    But this wasn't the case.    To the gravy, I had added dry Lipton onion soup mix, a can mushroom soup, 2 tsp brown gravy mix and about 1/4 can beef stock.  I sauteed the mushrooms before adding to the gravy mixture, drained them  too.

I then seared the steaks and transferred to a casserole dish, covered with the gravy mixture and baked @ 350 degrees for 40 min.

My family didnt like the overpowering onion taste.  (I had used the french onion soup as directed.)  Next time will omit this and just use the Lipton onion dry mixture.

Overall, it was OK but not as the other reviews rave about.
I had high hopes for my Sunday supper, but was not to be.

Made this with mashed potatoes, buttered corn and homemade bread.   Was not enough to save the main dish.

Also, if you do make this, make sure you drain EVERYTHING.  I used 90% lean hamburger and still had alot of grease sitting on the top of the gravy.  Not appetizing at all.

I didn't change a thing and it was delicious! I have a very picky 13 yr old who doesn't like onions and a husband who doesn't like ketchup, and they both loved it. I'm so glad I didn't take advice from most reviewers  on gravy modifications. I will definitely make it again. It pairs perfectly with mashed potatoes.

Sorry, just did not care for this.  The meat was rather bland and I added spices to it.   Gravey was tasty.  So I would give it a 2 for th emat, 4 for the gravy, so I ended up with a 3.

We've got four kidlets under 12 y/o and everyone liked the meal (with rice, peas and a salad).  Only giving it four stars because I added Cream of Mush and onion soup mix to the gravy as suggested by others.  I enjoyed it mostly because I was able to make the main in one skillet.

The flavor was nice. I would've preferred more sauce. I didn't have a large skillet, just an average size, maybe that had something to do with it.

Fabulous!  New family favorite.  Never made Salisbury steak before in 34 years of cooking, don't know why! I did make changes.  I used 2 pds of beef with 1 pound of ground pork.
Also added small finely diced onion .   Since I had such a large amount of meat I put whole can of soup in mixture along with one package of onion soup.   I was worried it would be too salty so I did not add salt and it turned out great.  Browned them in skillets and transferred them to deep casserole dish, covered and baked for about 45 minutes (mine were very thick).  Also doubled the amount of gravy.  Thanks for this recipe!

Awesome recipe. This will be my go to recipe for salisbury steak, it was so moist and held together very well. I made this two weeks in a row with no complaints. I did use the left over soup for my husband's steaks and used cream of mushroom for the kids and mine as the hubby doesn't care for cream soups. No alterations needed with this recipe, it's great as it. So happy I found this recipe!

it was delkicious! but I can't completely rate this recipe since I made a few changes. 

since I don't have condensed soup I made one: 
saute onions in olive oil. add flour and onion soup mix. then added leftover chicken soup. cooked until thickened. then added some leftover mushrooms I had after taking off some for the meat mixture. 

I made my own worcestershire sauce since I had none in the house.

I absolutely love this! Would've given it 5 stars but i doctored it a bit. I made the steak exactly the way it's posted except instead of making the gravy with the above mentioned ingredients, I purchased lipton's onion mushroom mix and used that. It came out amazing! I also didn't have bread crumbs so I used cracker crumbs. Still amazing!

Loved this. Only thing I did different was strain the French onion soup using two cans instead of one and sautéed onions in place of the ones I strained out of the cans. Was delicious.

very good, I just made it following the recipe with the addition of a can of cream of mushroom soup to the gravy.  we found it to be too ketchupy so next time i will make it with much less ketchup and double the gravy recipe without the cream of mush soup to see how that is.

This recipe was easy to prepare and everyone loved it! Next time I might put less worcestershire sauce in the gravy and put the French onion soup in the food processor to smooth it out.

I liked it and so did my hubby! I'm not a very experienced cook but I'm working on it. I sauted fresh mushrooms before the 2nd step then set them aside and added them in the last step. Served over homemade red bliss skin on mashed potatoes with a side of sweet peas with some reserved mushrooms.

SUPER easy to make and very taste.  Because of the previous comments, I omitted the salt altogether, it was great.  One small suggestion, make smaller oval patties, instead of 6 the recipes calls for, maybe make 9 oval patties.

I have made this recipe a few times for my family and everyone loves it!  It is the perfect combination of salty and savory!  The beef patties come out so tender and they have the consistency of meatloaf.  I have added a small can of sliced mushrooms which everyone loves.  An A++++ recipe!

This was great.  It did require more French Onion soup for flavor and I used beef broth instead of water.  The final product was Perfection!

Turned out very good....meat was moist, well seasoned, and with the gravy on top had just a hint of ketchup, made it with loaded mashed potatoes, and corn...by far the best Salisbury Steak I've ever made.....I browned the steakes in a hot frying pan, than when browned put them in a baking dish and poured the sauce over top and baked at 320 for 30 minutes...additionally I made this recipe as described by the originator and it came out perfect....finally those that berate the original recipe you shouldn't give comments when you tweak the recipe totally differently.

I usually don't cook my husband does but I was tired of the same menu so I surprised him. It's his favorite now and I make it once every week. I did add steak mushrooms and long cut onions for more flavor. I made them big so if you do not like them you don't have to pick them out. I also added 1/2 can of extra French onion soup at the end.

The steak was tasty but the gravy had an odd taste.  Next time I'll eliminate the worcestershire sauce and the dry mustard.  Needs a lot of tweaking-garlic powder, dried parsley.

The meat was good but the gravy was too sweet. If I try this again I will not use ketchup and add a can of cream of mushroom soup as others suggested.

Was searching for something to do with ground beef instead of meat loaf and I came upon this recipe.  I'm thrilled that I did! I didnt have any canned french onion soup so I used a can of beef broth and then whisked in a packet of brown gravy mix. I'm sure the french onion makes it but mine still turned out delish! Kids loved it too! Will be adding this to my dinner rotation! Thanks!!!

Well let me first say, this was great for me and my family everyone loved it. But I've seen reviews saying its disgusting. Hmmm maybe you did something wrong. I didn't add or take away anything. Very delicious meal and easy to make.

Love this! The recipe is great. For extra sauce all I do is open up 2-3 cans of Golden Mushroom Soup depending on how much gravy I need.

Kelly, I cannot say enough about the reaction I got from my children.  My son (5 1/2) told me I was the best "cooker" ever and he wanted me to make this every night.  My daughter (3 1/2), referred to this as "sauce hamburgers" and wanted more.  My husband and I enjoyed them too.  Definitely a recipe we will keep around.  Thanks for sharing.

This is so good.  I couldn't find onion soup so I found a recipe for that online.  I also added about 1/2 cup of water to the bottom of the pan.  I froze some left overs and they freeze well.  My husband was so upset because he thought I had left them in the refrigerator to ruin...but he got a pleasant surprise.  I am just pulling up the recipe so I can make it again.  I just jotted this one down in my preferred recipe book.

Our family loves this recipe done just like the recipe, except I double the sauce and add fresh mushrooms to it.  So easy and delicious, reminds me of my mom's cooking.

The only thing I did different was used onion soup mix & 1.5 cups of water instead & a beef boullion cube of condensed french onion (couldn't find it).  I also added mushrooms as I love them with my steak!  This recipe would be just as tasty without them!  OMG so easy and very tasty!  No tweaks needed.

This was fabulous! The only change I made was to add a can of cream of mushroom soup to the gravy, as a bunch of reviewers suggested. It was so good! Next time I will double the sauce so I can have gravy for mashed potatoes.

Doubled the gravy, omitted the ketchup, added chopped garlic and 1/2 large onion to meat mixture, and two pints of sliced mushrooms.  Delicious!

Pretty good. I made this over my bf's house with no measuring utensils so I eyeballed the measurements and I also used a can of cream of mushroom. About 1/3 with the patties and the rest in the gravy. I also added the dry onion soup..about 3/4 of a packet plus a cup or so of water. I didn't add salt..just pepper. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and my bf and his very picky 7 yr. old enjoyed it. The onion taste was pretty strong to me but next time I think I'll add a bit of sugar and adjust the gravy to taste. I'll also use cubed steaks. Great base recipe tho!

Absolutely THE best.  I've made this several times.  It is a quick and easy recipe and I serve with mashed potatoes and a vegetable (usually broccoli).  The condensed French Onion soup is hard to come by sometimes, so I just substitute a packet of onion soup mix and add that to 10.5 oz of hot water.  

Recently I wanted to leave some for my family while I was away and followed the directions up to shaping the patties then froze the patties separately in plastic wrap.  I made the gravy on the stove, let it cool and spooned it into a small zip lock baggie and put the frozen patties and gravy baggie in a larger freezer zip lock with written instructions on the outside for them.  They loved it, so simple and quick!  I imagine you could cook completely then freeze as well.... that is my next experiment.

This is comfort food at its best!  Great flavours, wonderful gravy... especially over mashed potatoes.  Did take some others recommendations and added a can of mushroom soup.  Also sauteed mushrooms, onions and a clove of minced garlic. Yummy.

lets see, many problems for me in this dish. first off, the patties in general tasted bitter because of the onion soup. i don't know what it is about onion soup but i have yet to find a dish that have benefited from the interesting flavor. another problem i had was with mustard powder in the sauce. needless to say it ruined the whole dish.

the weakest ingredient is the can of Onion soup.  Hot water, tablespoon of quality beef stock concentrate, caramelize a white onion, add to stock and let it get happy.  Many improvements suggest throwing a can of mushroom soup at the recipe to improve. 

The basic recipe is very good.  If you ditch the can onion soup and make real onion soup, it is wonderful.  

What I'm trying to say here is the time saved by dumping a can of soup at a recipe like this isn't worth the time saving as you get a can soup result.

This is a great recipe however I modified it a bit. Like other reviewers suggested I added some mushroom soup and I also added about a tablespoon of red cooking wine.  I used onion soup mix with 2 cups of water instead of canned onion soup. It is delicious

Pretty good recipe. I tried the gravy before and after adding the ketchup and I liked it better without. The ketchup makes it kind of sweet.

This was surprisingly good! Only important thing is that if you looked under "dairy free recipes" and stumbled upon this one like I did, check your can of condensed soup! I didn't and it had milk in it and I have a child with a dairy allergy. So, this is NOT a milk-free meal!

The recipe as is only gets 3 stars because the first time I made this dish I followed the recipe and all I could taste was the ketchup.  The 2nd time I followed the advice of one of the reviews and used only half of the ketchup called for in the recipe and doubled the sauce.  I also added onions and sliced mushrooms and served it over egg noodles.  Everyone had second helpings this time. :)

This was good, especially the sauce. I made mine with ground turkey which seemed to make it very tender and moist. I wish I would have made more sauce for my egg noodles, the recipe doesn't make a lot of sauce.

I made this for the first time last night. It got voted a make again recipe. Thats a big approval at our house.  The meat was was very moist and the tangy sauce was great on mashed potatoes.

Actually pretty darn good...i suggest you add a little more seasoning (garlic powder, onion powder and black pepper, don't add salt though) to your ground beef after the initial mixing of meat and ingredients or it could taste kind of bland....other than that it's a kick  recipe!

I made this recipe as written, but did double the gravy as some suggested. I found it to have a little too much ketchup, so I'll probably reduce the amount next time. I also refrigerated the patties before cooking them so they wouldn't fall apart. Overall, it was very yummy.

I tried this recipe, today.  I would have gave it the 5 th star, but i had to change a few things. I used pre -made burger patties , instead of making my own with the flavors of the recipe. Just salt, pepper, and garlic powder. I didnt have the onion soup mix and onion soup, so i used a powdered ranch dip mix , cream of chicken soup and dried minced onions. I also added more water because we like the gravey on mashed potatoes. Turned out pretty good, thin burgers do better than thicker ones, i had both. The gravey was good, not too thick, I put an extra tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce, wont do that again, too much. I was trying to darken the gravey. Otherwise, great inspiration.  Thanks !

I guess I should preface this review by saying that I was super pregnant when I made this recipe---and I normally do not eat meat.  One day I was CRAVING meaty comfort food and remembered that my mom always made us salisbury steak as kids- so after googling this recipe I decided to try it.  I omited the mustard powder...but all in all this was DELICIOUS.  I now make it for the first chilly day of winter every year.  My whole family loves this and it will continue as a staple in our house.

Good and easy. there is definitely not enough gravy, needs to be tripled at least. I prepared it exactly how it is written. the only negative us it was too greasy for my liking and my husband would not touch the gravy because of the grease level.

Needs more beef flavor in the gravy. Maybe add a Bouillon cube next time. The steaks were good as is.

I made the steaks only and they were very flavorful and tender and yummy. For the sauce I used the rest of the onion soup and some brown gravy. It was pretty good.

I made this recipe the exact way it was presented. I thought it was great! I can see where some people may want to add a little more seasoning (I tend to like bland food, so not a problem for me), but I really liked it just the way it was. The only comment I would make is that you may want to increase the gravy portion. We didn't have enough for our mashed potatoes.

Really good! Changed nothing at all and it turned out very tasty. Next time I will double the gravy just because I felt like it was a tad short. My husband and son loved it! It will be on our menu again!!!! Yum!

On its own, the sauce was a little too ketchup-y for our tastes, but with the meat and over mashed potatoes, it balanced out nicely. I think I'd still halve the amount of ketchup next time, just because we're not huge fans of it, but overall a tasty dinner.

Yes this is very good. I made a few changes to it because I didnt have exactly what the recipe called for.I  used cornstArch instead of flour. Dried onion soup mix instead of canned. And I didnt add salt because of the high sodium content of the soup. The patties did fall apart though. I didnt use my nonstick fry pan.next time I will use the nonstick frypan. Served it with mashed potatoes. I will be makin this again. Glad I found another good ground meat recipe to use my big bags of ground meat I buy.

It tasted great but the patties just fell apart from the beginning.  From looking at the other comments I can see I should have read them first.  Next time (and there will be a next time) I'll add more bread crumbs to dry out the meat a bit more.  I might also tweak the gravy a bit, most likely with more Worcestershire.

Very good.  Husband loved it.  Served with fresh corn on cob cooked in the shucks in the microwave and boiled Russet potatoes.  Next time I will try some variations based on some of the other reviews, just to see.

I did make a few minors adjustments..Left out the ketchup and mustard..I used mushroom and onion soup (dry) didn't have plain canned onion soup and added fresh mushrooms... It was delicious. Thanks for the inspiration.

Taste a lot like meatloaf. Gravy way to salty.(thank goodness I didn't add salt) I doubled like recommened added sautéed mushrooms w/garlic to gravy + cream of mushroom soup. I didn't add Onion due to the onion soup. Will not make again. I don't know that I will ever try Salisbury steak again. (Hubby who doesn't like onions thought it was good)I think he was being nice.

Love it! Just my changes that I've made after making this recipe several times. I ground up my own sirloin. I always do 4 lbs...triple the sauce ( except ketchup) adding fresh mushrooms. And I add a packet of brown gravy mix. Very good as is, but I add a little per my families tastes!

This was awesome! I intended to make according to recipe however my wife has celiac and i couldn't find any GF French onion soup mix. Only thing i had on hand was condensed tomato soup. I used that and added onion powder. Otherwise i made it to the letter...sauce and all and we all loved it!

My family loved it. I did add the cream of mushroom soup (as others have suggested) to the gravy.  I did this mostly because there didn't seem to be enough gravy for the potatoes that I was serving with it.  It all was delicious!  Next time I will add more onions. I will make this again.  As a diabetic it was a great way to watch my my carbs.  I just omitted the potatoes and added veggies.

Yummy!  Some say this is waaaay  too salty, but we love salt in the south.  And, once you put it over mashed potatoes, it all comes together!  To make it a little less salty, use low sodium soups and make your own onion soup mix, sans salt.

I used deer meat instead and a little more of french onion soup. I mixed rest of french onion soup with canned brown gravy and serve with mashed potatoes. Everyone in the house loves it. It freezes great too.

I made this recipe as is with no changes to the ingredients.. It was delicious!! Instead of cooking it on the stove, I baked it in the oven at 375 for 45 minutes! I will definitely be making this again with extra sauce for my mashed potatoes!

I made this for our family, my first attempt at salisbury steak, and it turned out pretty good!  Only problem I had was not having mustard powder, I added a some yellow mustard.  Definitely changed the flavor (too mustardy), but that was my error, not the fault of the recipe.  Even then, these were delicious!  Everyone asked for second helpings.  We will be making this again!

I love this recipe and would give it 5 stars with the exception of having trouble keeping the patties together when searing them. I may take others recipe and either broil the tops and then pour gravy over, or just not pan-sear first. also i prefer using the Lipton onion soup/ cream of mushroom soup gravy. One plus is I can buy the ingredients in bulk/family pack and make ahead lots of patties and freeze. Since its only myself and my husband it makes it easy to have a nice meal without having to prepare from scratch every time.

We just didn't like this recipe. The ketchup was way to strong in the gravy and the meat just had an odd taste to it for us. May be for some, but not for this family.

Added double french onion soup, cr of mush soup, then also added tablespoon or so of beef gravy dry mix & a little red wine.  kept the other ingredients the same.  wonderful with these additions!  company worthy.

cooked on stove, not baked.

I had a few problems with this recipe, but it was my own fault.  Despite that, this is a very forgiving recipe.  When it called for a large frying pan, I was a little too literal and got out my 15" diameter pan.  The largest of three nesting cast iron pans would have been great.  I only had golden mushroom soup, one pound of hamburger, and seasoned bread crumbs, but even with those alterations, the flavor of the dish was wonderful.  I was worried that the flavor would be like a sloppy Joe, being it called for ketchup and mustard, but there was no resemblance.  I like sloppy Joes, I just didn't want that tonight. The burgers did stick to the pan, and I ended up just breaking up the burgers so the sauce wouldn't burn, too, which it was close to doing.  As I said, my pan was too big.  I cooked up some egg noodles and stirred it all together.  I enjoyed it; I'll be curious to try it with the actual ingredients called for; I'm sure it will be even better.  I found it a bit on the salty side, but that could be because I only used  one pound vs. one and a half pounds of meat.

Simple and delicious. I added a can of cream of mushroom soup and a small can of mushrooms to the recipe and eliminated the ketchup. It made a good gravy if you want to serve with mashed potatoes.

The meat was fine, but the sauce was off.  I really think it was the ketchup that made it taste unbalanced.

I made it exactly as specified.  We've never had salisbury steak and most of my family hates onions, but we loved it!  My husband went for seconds.  It was really good.  I could see doubling the gravy so that you could use it over mashed potatoes, rice, or pasta.

Update 10/17/14 
This update concerns the mustard powder and ketchup I was out of the first time I prepared this recipe. I made this again and added the missing ingredients. Our preference: This recipe, for us, was better without the mustard and ketchup. The flavor was beefier. The ketchup added a sweetness that we did not care for. 

I tried this recipe a few weeks ago and my family and I loved it. I was out of mustard powder and ketchup but they still were delicious. The next time I prepare this recipe I will add those two items in and see if there is much difference in taste and decide which way we like it best. I thought the rich beefy flavor the French onion soup provided was super. I added a bit more soup than required because I wanted to have plenty of gravy for the mashed potatoes we had with the steaks. Add a salad or veggie and you have a great meal. I have an additional suggestion that many of you probably already do to cut down on kitchen time. Every meal I prepare I double or triple the recipe. We enjoy leftovers and this cuts down on my cooking time. My family does not mind to eat the same thing two days in a row but you could always reheat it 2-3 days later or freeze it in portions. I am a homeschool mom with two of my sons still in high school and there are days they have the leftovers for their lunch or even a snack. It is nice to have the prepared food handy as it cuts down on what I consider junk food.

Absolutely delicious!! Texture was great and had perfect hint of onion flavor.  Not too strong for the non-onion lover.

I followed the recipe exactly.  I thought that there was not enough gravy and that it tasted too much like ketchup.  However, the patties held their shapes very well and they were also very tender.  I will try this recipe again with a few of the modifications suggested by other reviewers.

I tried the recipe exactly as it was written and the sauce was unbearably bad that I ended up washing off the meat patties and making Hamburgers.  I added the cream of mushroom soup the next time I attempted this recipe because I LOVE Salisbury Steak but again it wasn

My family loved it! Adding this to my recipe rotation. I did use dry onion soup mix in the meat mix (1 and 1/4 tbs) and used 2 pounds of ground beef. For gravy, I used the rest of the onion soup mix to sautéed mushrooms, 1 can Campbell soup beef broth and 2 cups water. As I didn't have the condensed onion soup on hand. Was very moist and flavorful. Thank you!

Recipe was great! Usually after cooking my appetite is already gone but I couldn't stop eating. I usually make salisbury steak with cream of mushroom but the slight added sweetness and pop from the ketchup and mustard powder really worked. Once the flavor of the meat get infused with the sauce it balances everything out. The recipe is pretty balanced  I doubled it since I was cooking more, still came out great. Although I added a bit more water since I used onion soup mix which can get pretty salty.

Served it on top of rice and steamed veggies. Yum!

Made tonight, never have made outside of frozen dinner salisburg steak, anyways turned out so excellent and everyone in my family loved it.  The only thing different I did was made extra gravy we like to eat the steak with mashed potatoes so it seemed there was not enough so besides that the recipe was great.

I made this recipe almost as stated.  I did read most of the reviews and added a few things.  I added finely chopped onions to my beef mixture along with 2 cloves minced garlic.  I made a larger portion so I include a can of golden mushroom soup.  I did add an extra TBSP of flour.  Everything turned out great! And the leftovers just kept tasting better.  I found that the gravy was too watery and I did have to thicken it with a cornstarch slurry.  This really was such a great recipe. The mixture of the French Onion soup and and Golden Mushroom really made a nice gravy when thickened.  I served it with egg noodles and green beans.  My first time making Salisbury steaks and everyone loved it...thanks for the recipe.  A real keeper and thanks for the reviews from fellow cooks on how to tweak it.

I altered this recipe a little bit and it turned out delicious! I added minced onion and green pepper along with garlic powder to the meat mix. I sauteed portobello mushrooms and onions and added them as well as a can of mushroom soup to the gravy mixture. I didn't use salt because of the salt in the soup mix. This was fast, easy and tasted great!

This recipe is to become a family favorite. My wife and I tag-teamed, as we usually do, on this meal and were so pleased with the outcome even though we made a few changes do to supplies on hand and personal preferences. We only used a pound of ground chuck so had to modify everything by a third... all but the soup. For the soup we used Lipton's Beefy Onion and halved the amount of water giving us a little more gravy. This was awesome. A trick I've gotten hooked on is using bacon grease to brown the meat. Mmm-mmmm Good!!

As a European trying out American food this was a great succes! Although canned onion soup isn't common here, so I used beef bouillon instead, turned out great!

the steak part was tender but I did not care for the sauce.  It didn't look like the picture.  I would prefer the more traditional brown gravy.

This is outstandingly delicious with the following modifications: double the gravy (except for the ketchup) and added a can of cr. of mushroom soup and beef-onion soup mix. I cooked the patties in a couple of tablespoons of butter to get a crispy outside. Even with a lot of pink in the middle, these cooked through beautifully with the gravy simmering for about twenty-ish minutes. I sauteed 1 lb. mushrooms and one large  onion and then, when cooked through, I added them to the steaks and gravy just before serving. Served with mashed red potatoes. YUM! We both loved this recipe. :) In fact, my husband said it was one we'd have to make again and again and again.

I made this recipe for dinner and my family loved it!!!!  Everyone thought it cooked all day because of how juicy & tender the steaks are.  If your family loves gravy like mine, double the gravy recipe.  I put in the normal amount of soup in the hamburger.  Then used the remanding can plus 1 more can and just doubled the remaining ingredients.  Thank you for the great recipe Kelly, my husband especially thanks you!

This recipe has become one of my weeknight favorites, because it is so easy to prepare and very tasty. I like to serve it over oven roasted red potatoes or some roasted Brussel's sprouts.

I have tried this twice.  Both times I added worcestershire sauce and real mustard to meat, also.  I uses ground turkey and turkey sausage.

I made this exactly as the original recipe stated.  The meat was very good and tender and I didn't have trouble with the patties falling apart as some others did.  However, I did not care for the sauce,  the ketchup was overpowering.  If I made this again I would definitely omit the ketchup.  I really wish the reviewers would have rated the original recipe and not their own version of it.

Recipe as is, I give it 4 stars, only because that it doesn't make as much gravy to cover the patties and any starch that I have. Once I doubled or tripled the gravy (I have a family that loves drenching) it's a definite 5 stars! I even made this recipe for guests for a dinner and got major compliments for a person that LOVES salisbury and didn't think there could be a better one out there compared to where he was from. His wife definitely wanted the recipe!

Big hit at my house! My youngest (10) that doesn't like to eat hamburger had 2 helpings! I added mushrooms when I put the sauce in the pan and let them cook down a bit. I also added a little sour cream to the sauce when it was finished. Definitely making again!

I made this last night for my family and they loved it!  I did per the reviews alter a little.  I added a packet of onion soup mix and 1 extra cup of water.  I also added mushrooms and cut the ketchup in half.  I put in a baking pan and in the oven for 1/2 hour at 400 deg covered and they were moist and delicious.  Will definately make again!

all three of my kids liked this recipe. i have one kid that only gave it a two. i had to use ground mustard instead of mustard powder, because of this i think it gave it a little to much mustard flavor. plus i doubled the gravy for my mashed potatoes. it was good.  donna

I hate Salisbury Steak ... until I tried this!  This recipe is very tasty, and the ground beef remains juicy. A definite winner.  It's easy to make, and if you use ground beef with only 4 or 7 percent fat, it's healthier too.

This was so good! Meat was tender and flavorful! We served with mashed potatoes and corn, and it was a hit! I will be making again and again! 

Would suggest a very lean hamburger, otherwise the sauce will turn out greasy! Also, squeeze out as much grease after browning, which I didn't do, lessons learned!

To me this doesn't taste like Salisbury steak. Not impressed. Still looking for a good Salisbury steak recipe.

I made this last night for my family with minor adjustments and this was a hit! This is defiantly going into our regular meal rotation. It was super easy and delish. I seasoned my meat as above but added garlic and additional worchesire sauce. I also doubled the sauce recipe and tossed in fresh mushrooms and omitted the additional water so the sauce was thicker. You really can't go wrong with this recipe. Thank you so much for sharing.

Very Yummy.  I substituted the condensed French onion soup with the Lipton package soup and added sautéed fresh mushroom and caramelized onions.  I also omitted the ketchup... My family loved it!  Especially my husband, who is totally a meat and potatoes guy :)

I didn't make the sauce based on other reviews, but the steaks were excellent! My toddler boys loved them, and it's really difficult to get iron-rich beef into them normally. They even liked it as left overs, so it is definitely going into our regular rotation! Thanks for the great recipe!

This was a lot easier than many other recipes out there.

Next time, I'm going to double the sauce and increase the amount of French onion soup. The sauce was a little too ketchupy for my taste, and I think the extra onion soup would help cut that flavor down.

I made this for supper last night.  Let's just say that it ended up more like a sloppy joe mixture.  My patties ended up totally falling apart.  It was still really good.  We put it over hamburger buns.  The next time I make this, I will add an extra egg and see how that works.

I did not care for this recipe. It tastes NOTHING like Salisbury steak. Tastes more like meatloaf with a very sweet ketchup sauce on it. The patties fell apart and turned into crumbles and mush.

Maybe I just don't like Salisbury steak but I thought these just tasted like hamburgers slathered in stuff.   I expected somethihg thinner perhaps, with a crispier texture to the outside?  My husband said he liked them but I think he was just humoring me :/  Will not make these again.

in my opinion, this sauce was awful! i am pregnant and had a strong craving for salisbury steak, and i ended up spending probably  over a hour just trying to make this sauce decent, i ended up putting a bunch of honey bbq sauce, a lot of steak sauce, a couple teaspoons of garlic, salt & pepper, about a tbs of lemon juice. cream of mushroom soup, and a lot of montreal steak seasoning, just to make it edible then when i ate it i didn't use much of the sauce on it i let the sauce run off of it, like a lot of people i baked it for about 20 minutes at 400 i hope this saves a lot of people time on not using this sauce i would of just used beef gravy if i would of read the reviews first. but the meat turned out very well i would suggest  this to people with young kids or elders that have problems eating cause it turns out with a very soft texture

I think mixing the onion soup packet with 2 c. water, to make a condensed soup, was a huge mistake! The gravy didn't thicken much, and both the meat and the sauce were kind of bland. I totally blame myself for that. Even so, Mr. Pickypants cleaned his plate, so this recipe is definitely worth another try! Next time, I will use dry soup mix in the meat, and I will take my time putting the gravy together.

Recipe was perfect for me. It was juicy, had great flavor, and is just all-around the greatest Salisbury Steak recipe out there. Simple, yet satisfying. I'm making it again for the 3rd time for my dinner! I'm so excited. My boyfriend and family enjoyed it way too much!

The reason a person changes a recipe is that they don't have the exact ingredients or they use the original recipe as a guide to take creative license.  I carmelized 2 onions and added to sauce ingredients along with beef stock.  I didn't have onion soup.  5 stars!

I have used this recipe a few times and my husband keeps asking for it when we are setting up our dinners for the week. The only thing I do differently is that I use more of the french onion soup to have more gravy to go over the meat and mashed potatoes. This is a great recipe!!!!!!

This was very good, to be fair, I had to make some alterations.  I used cream of onion soup because I did not have any french onion on hand, I also added some sauteed onions into the gravy. Next time I would like to try it as written.

I've made this recipe exactly as directed, and made the version with the mushroom soup (using a can of French Onion soup as well as a can of Cream of Mushroom and a packet of Dry Onion Soup for the gravy and doubling the remaining gravy ingredients except the ketchup; browned on stove and then cooked the steaks in oven for 45 minutes along with the gravy.)  I loved the tangy ketchupy taste of the original version but my son really loved the mushroon soup version!  Either way,we love this recipe and will continue to make it often!  Thanks!

I decided to try this since the store bought ones contain so much unhealthy junk . It was Delicious. I did not have canned onion soup, but had dried onion soup mix. I added that, and about a cup of water. I omitted the mustard and ketchup, but kept everything else. They were delicious and even my kids said they tasted allot like the Banquet Salisbury steak we used to buy.

Overall it was very good, changed a few things. coated patties in flour and pan fried in olive oil 4 min each side, then cooked in oven for approx 40 min at 375. before i put it in the oven i added sliced fresh mushrooms and onions to the top, i added a packet of brown gravy powder to the gravy to thicken, i left out the mustard and ketchup and added the worchester sauce right in the pattie meat instead of in the gravy....

I made this tonight, and the only changes I made were, I used 1lb of meat, and shaped them into 8 patties instead of 6. I also doubled the gravy mixture, so I ended up using 2 cans of soup. THEY TURNED OUT WONDERFUL!!! They were so good, and no leftovers:( I was hoping I'd get to save one for lunch tomorrow but the last one was just devoured. Great recipe!

I hate writing this, but I did make some changes. We used stove top in lieu of bread crumbs and doubled the gravy ingredients besides the ketchup. I browned them on the stove and finished them at 350 in the oven for 30 mins. All my kiddos enjoyed them!

This isn't a bad recipe, just not at all what I was expecting. If you are trying to make standard Salisbury steak -- with the sort of flavor that comes in frozen entrees or in restaurants -- use onion soup mix for the flavoring and nothing else, as so many reviewers have suggested.  Catsup makes it taste like Swiss steak, the Worcestershire doesn't belong, and absolutely no mustard powder.  Browned mine in a pan then baked for 30 min at 325, was very tender and juicy. Family ate it, but asked for the old way next time.

I only gave this recipe a 4 instead of 5 stars because of the changes that I feel improve the recipe.  I made it as the recipe stated the first time, and agree with other viewers that it needed more gravy and more spices in the meat mixture.  The 2nd time I, too, added onion and garlic to the meat mixture and mushroom soup to the gravy mixture.  I also made an extra gravy from soup mix (as other reviewer stated) as my family loves gravy for the mashed potatoes I served with this meal.  With the changes - absolute 5!!  Thank you, Kelly, for sharing!

Tried this for the first time last night and will make it many more times! We used to buy those frozen salisbury dinners which were ok. Recent changes to the gravy made those inedible but we still wanted salisbury steaks. I saw this recipe and all the reviews and decided to try it and I am glad I did..easy to make and really didn't take long at all!1

Simple and quick recipe.  I added button mushrooms to the recipe and it tasted great.  I sliced the mushrooms and added them to the skillet after I had flipped the patties the first time.  I used ground sirloin so there was not any excess fat to drain.  My wife loved it.

Really good, really easy. This is the first time I've ever made Salisbury Steak.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of scaling it down to 4 servings and adding fresh sliced button mushrooms to the pan with the sauce. I served it with mashed potatoes and green beans...amazing!

Took some other reviewers advice and nixed the ketchup. Sauteed onions and mixed with the meat. Increased the gravy and added Cream of Mushroom soup, a little red wine, dry onion soup mix and a can of mushrooms. I browned the patties then baked at 350 degrees for 45 mins. I added a little Bisto to the gravy and served with mashed potatoes and corn. Great dinner!!

OMG, what a great meal we had tonight...hamburger transformed...all I did different was added 3 tbls flat leaf parsley chopped, 1/2 tsp. fresh thyme and to the gravy an extra can of cream of mushroom.  Sooo good!  Oh, one more thing...it called for 1/4 ketchup, next time I will use less...you know your family and your likes make it your own...but this on it's own is REALLY good!!!!!

This is the first time I have ever made salisbury steak and it was wonderful!!! My family loved it! The only changes we made was added a tablespoon of A1 in addition to the Worcestershire, and didn't cover the pan the last 20  minutes so that the gravy would thicken.  Thanks again for the wonderful recipe!

I really like this recipe but.....I would use crushed saltines instead of bread crumbs simply for a texture preference, the bread crumbs are to fine for my taste.  My husband did not like the sweetness the ketchup added to the sauce but I did.  I also added mushrooms to the sauce and they went quiet nicely.

Whole family loved it, even picky husband! Once I browned it I put the meat in a baking dish, made the gravy in the pan I browned the meet in (and doubled the gravy recipe so there was plenty to go over french fries or mashed potatoes), then poured the gravy over the meat and baked it for about 30 minutes. Was super!

Yummy!! I followed others reviews and doubled the gravy ingredients except the ketchup. I also put a bunch of fresh sautéed mushrooms in the gravy. One last thing I used the whole can of onion soup in the gravy so I just mixed in half a packet of onion soup mix into the meat and it was so good!! My husband and I both loved it!! I will defiantly be making this over and over.

I didn't make any changes. My family and I enjoyed it. I wanted to try something new and this has been chosen for the "make again" list. :) It was very easy and inexpensive to make. As the pattys were browned I mixed up the sauce so it didn't take much time to prepare. After I poured the sauce in the pan I made up some homemade mashed potatoes and a can of creamed sweet corn and by the time the potatoes were done the steaks were too. The only thing I would do differently next time maybe experiment with different seasonings and make more sauce.

I followed other reviewers suggestions on the gravy, but the patties were fantastic. For the gravy, I used 2 cans french onion soup mix, 2 cans cream of mushrooms, and 1 brown gravy packet to thicken it up. It was good, but a little too oniony for our taste. I did not make the gravy as noted, so I am giving the patties themself 4 stars :)

Since I was serving this with mashed potatoes, I knew I would need more gravy.  I followed some of the reviewers' suggestions and added a can of cream of golden mushroom soup and a sauteed onion to the gravy.  It tasted a little bitter, so I added a tablespoon of brown sugar, and it was perfect!  I will be making this again.

Up until this recipe I was not a fan of Salisbury steak, but I could truly eat this every week. Absolutely delish!  I did need more gravy so I doubled only the soup, flour, water, and mustard powder. Perfect!

I followed the recipe exactly as it stated. The patties themselves were good but my family and I did not care for the sauce. It was too sweet if that makes sense. I think it was the ketchup that gave it the too sweet taste. I won't make it again but like I said, I like the patties.

Yummmm great recipe.  Everyone in family loved this salisbury steak even 2 1/2 year old.  Didn't have onion soup so I used dried onion soup mix and beef broth for the gravy.  Will make again soon best ever.

This was a fast and easy recipe. It was delicious and I will be making it again. I used a dry package of Onion soup instead of the condensed soup and that turned out well. I also skipped the making patty phase. These also tasted really good in mini sandwiches.

My wife and I made this and really enjoyed it. I gave it four stars because I did feel the need to tweak it just a bit. Like other reviewers, I added a can of cream of mushroom to the gravy. Also, I used a bit more onion soup than called for in my meat and let the patties rest before browning in an already-hot cast iron skillet, which prevented the crumbling that other reviewers have reported. All in all, definitely a repeater!

I am rating this with 4 stars because I completely botched this recipe. I mixed the entire can of French onion soup with the beef mixture and I didn't have regular bread crumbs on hand, so I used seasoned bread crumbs... even with that these "steaks" turned out pretty darn good.  Obviously, I didn't have any soup mix left to make the gravy so I ended up using a few things I had on hand (beef gravy and steak sauce) to create my own.  So this recipe only gets 4 stars because I goofed...however, it is a testament that this recipe is fool-proof!

I added Worcestershire, onion, garlic powder, extra bread crumbs, and Italian seasoning to the ground beef. I also added onion and fresh mushroom to the gravy. This tasted like it was from a restaurant. I ate it with mashed potatoes and peas. Delicious.

Thank you for sharing this recipe.  I followed the directing with the exception of adding sliced baby bella mushrooms.  I served it with homemade mashed potatoes and brusssel sprouts.  My wife said it was "lick the plate good."

This is the first time ever eating SS from something other than a TV dinner. The meat was very tasteful and could taste the onion soup. My family and I loved it. Unfortunately, it did not taste as good as leftovers. There was enough for 2 adults and one child with leftovers for one lunch. Will make again.

SUPER good!  my boyfriend loved it!  I didnt use the ketchup, used 3/4 cup of water instead of 1/4.  added a can of mushroom soup, pack of onion soup mix, and half a pack of brown gravy mix to the gravy mixture.  Also to the patty mixture I put in half an onion.

Excellent, I made exactly like recipe says with one exception because I only had one can of the soup home and I wanted to double the recipe. I took a package of dry lipton onion soup mix, put it in the empty can of soup and added water enought to fill the can. Fed 8 people 7 out of the 8 loved it and the one that did not really does not eat on a regular basis. Will make again. It will be a regular.

I stayed with the base recipe but instead of disgarding the grease i added 1/4 cup of red wine and 8 oz of mushrooms before mixing in the rest of the ingredients.  made it tons better and everyone ate it all!

Well, I rated this 4* b/c MY recipe came out wonderful!  I didn't have ketchup so I substituted a BBQ sauce; I DON'T use prepkgd soups so I added my own sautéed onions and since I knew what the recipe was looking for:  flavor, I added anchovies (umami) to the beef.  The sauce was definitely not enough, but still was good, I also added a bit of beef broth.  I will make it again but w/double some of the ingredients.  And still NO pkgd foods, they contain MSG which is not good ladies & gents!  Oh, I did add a non MSG bouillon to the gravy and in help it dissolve, heated the water!  We CAN all cook, and when we don't have the ingredients called for, we can IMPROVISE!!!

This has become a favorite in our home. The only difference is I cook it in the oven because I can't handle the splashing. Other than that, we all love it, even the kids!

Tried this recipe a few years back, and it has become a staple in our household.  It is very easy to make and the flavor is great.  We use ground turkey instead of beef.  This allows us to skip the bread crumbs and the egg the recipe calls for.  I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a quick and flavorful weeknight meal.

Made this last night, it was delicious!!!  So simple to make and short cooking time.  The only thing I did different was double the gravy based on other's comments because my hubby is a meat/potatoes/gravy kind of guy!  We loved this and will make again and again.

Very good. I was looking for a recipe similar to my neighbor's who has passed away. This was close, but not quite it. Still tasty though. I added some garlic powder for a bit more flavor. I would make this again.

Because I added the mushroom soup and used Italian bread crumbs I don't know how the "original" recipe is..even with my changes- the worshteshire sauce and or mustard was too strong. So those two elements were maybe throwing my change off to taste only good and not great. But a great start to be something wonderful

I followed all the changes advised by ALLY99, and only used 1 lb of 80/20 ground beef and 2 eggs (kepty the rest of the measurements the same aside from a tbsp of dried minced onion and a dash of worcestershire sauce).  The recipe turned out great!  I baked it following browning it over a bed of pasta and it was AWESOME!

I'm puzzled as to why I found this listed under Dairy-free, condensed French onion soup is not a dairy-free product. I had to make variations due to that factor using a soup mix instead, which didn't make it bad. My family, especially my significant other who is dairy-free, absolutely loved it. I am not in love w/ this recipe but it appears I will be making it often. I'm going to make more adjustments. The ketchup makes this dish seem sketchy smelling. Don't fear it if you base your eating mostly off of smell (I do!) because you may be deceived with this dish.

Very good! Like other reviewers, I doubled the gravy (except ketchup) and added cream of mushroom soup and dry onion soup mix. Mushrooms would also be great.

Low Fat version of recipe still very tasty! By using low-fat versions of ingredients I reduced this 32 grams of fat per serving recipe down to only 6 grams of fat! I utilized the same recipe except I substituted certain ingredients with their low-fat versions. I used 97% reduced fat beef, very lean, I used 98% fat free cream of mushroom (added to recipe based on other's recommendations) and it reduced the fat content substantially and still had a great taste! I personally would use half the amount of Worcestershire sauce if you are not a big fan of it like me. Other than that, great recipe, great meal!

My husband loved this dish! I did change one thing. I added double to the sauce mix. It just wasn't enough sauce the first time I made this. The second time I made this I made more sauce by using 2 french onion soup cans and also added 2 cans cream of mushroom soup. The differences were more sauce and the meat was softer than when I made it with less sauce. Also, I sauteed onions, mushroom, and garlic with the meat. It was delicious!

I've made this recipe several times as-is and everyone loves it. The gravy doesn't have the typical brown gravy flavor, which is why I think some reviewers don't like it as much. I once added a packet of brown gravy seasoning and a little water to the gravy and it obviously gave it a much more traditional brown gravy flavor. I assume adding a packet of onion soup mix would do the same. Either way my family loves it. It's also very easy and quick to make, which is another bonus.

Not like any Salisbury steak I've ever had. The ketchup ruined it and the Worstershire needs to be cut in half, at the very least, if not omitted. Thanks, though, for the technique so that I can make it exactly like I really want it.

Fantastic Dinner - Will do this for company.  Did not have the sherry but used a beef and a tomato flavored cube.  Why have I waited so long to enjoy this?

Followed the recipe with no changes of my own - kinda wish I had, not a repeat for my family, could be I did something wrong b/c my steaks turned into chunks and broke while I was attempting to turn them over -_- which would of been ok if the sauce made up for it but it didn't

overall, quite good.  a little heavy on the worstershire for my taste.  next time I'll cut that in half.  the patties were very moist, almost fell apart.  I'll either make them a little thinner or maybe omit the egg. my frying pan was smaller than I think I needed, so I had to make them a little thick to fit them in.  will make again.

This recipe is basic and easy to make.  I followed the recipe exactly and didn’t make any changes.  The gravy was a bit on the tangy side and that’s the only reason I gave it four stars.  If you like that flavor, you’ll love this recipe.

This is absolutely fabulous!  I used very lean ground beef and added some mushrooms and a few freshly cut up onions to the gravy while it was cooking.  This is a great recipe and I will be making it again.

I have been making this recipe as is for years. My original recipe called for prepared mustard, but I'm sure it is just as good with ground mustard! It is a family favorite! I always double the sauce and use it for the mashed potatoes!

I thought this was fantastic! Apart from the meat being soggy :-/ Not sure what that was from but I followed everything perfectly, but tweeked the sauce. Once the patties were cooked I took them out of the pan, sprinkled some flour and cooked that into a roux. Then I added a little milk, just a tish of mustard and ketchup and added the remaining french onion soup. Let it thicken a bit, placed the patties back in the pan and enjoyed! :-D

Oh wow! This was incredibly good! The ONLY changes I made to this was that I used EXTRA LEAN ground beef specifically, comes out most tender; I knew this because I use the same type to make my Italian meatballs (my Italian Grandmother taught me this). I added extra water (about a half of a cup) with an additional tablespoon of flour stirred into the water then poured into the already cooking gravy in the pan; made more gravy. Brought the gravy and steaks to a boil, reduced to LOW and simmered slowly, covered, for an hour or so - stirring every 15 mins. My husband loved it but said the gravy reminded him of catsup (shhhh! I didn't tell him that was one of the ingredients!), so next time I will probably reduce that ingredient by half. Still, I give this recipe 5 stars because it was awesome!!! These are so much better than the store bought Salisbury Steaks, by a million!

The patty was good but the gravy was not.  The ketchup overpowered so I added some brown gravy mix to mellow it out but it was then just bland.  If I made again would definitely need to work on the gravy.

Delish...soooo much better than the frozen version.  I would have given it 5 star but I thought the sauce was a little sweet.  I'm thinking about switching out the ketscup out for tomato sauce...

Great recipe! Followed the recipe nearly exactly. I doubled the sauce as others suggested but did not double the ketchup. I also used 1 can French onion soup and 1 can beef consomme out of personal preference. I thought using the beef consomme would add a richer flavor. Next time I plan to follow my personal edits and also not double the Worcestershire sauce; it was a little overpowering.

Absolutely, positively LOVED this recipe. I used to turn up my nose to salisbury steak when it was offered in the cafeteria during elementary school, but I am hooked on this recipe! MY family has begged me to make it so many times and I just discovered it a few weeks ago. Don't change a thing.

To make this dairy-free, I used 2 packages of lipton soup mix with 20 oz of water.  I also used just 1 pound of ground beef (cutting back on the bread crumbs to 1/3 c) and doubled the rest of the ingredients for the gravy (but not the katsup or mustard powder). I also added some ground pepper to the gravy along with a tsp of granulated beef bullion. I made it the way others have by baking it for 30 mins at 400. It was great and my son could eat it.

My wife thinks I'm a terrible bland cooker. Now that I made this meal for her she stated I have to cook once a week. Excellent meal, very easy to make and very easy recipe to follow.

Who ever suggested adding the dry brown gravy to the sauce is genius. Without it, it's too tangy almost sweet. The brown gravy gives it more mmmph!! I used crushed ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs since I was out. And added a bit of water to the sauce. Was delicious!!!

yummy! only reason i didnt give 5 stars is because i tweaked. i (by reading the other reviews) added a half can of cream of mushroom soup.  next time, i want to add a can of beef gravy becasue i just hought it needed more gravy. BUT it was a great recipe!

Made this in my crockpot, doubling the sauce.  It was a hit with the grown-ups, but the kids didn't care much for the taste.  I think it would be a good budget meal to serve company as it has a bit different adult taste.  Served with rice would be nice.

I thought it was good, but could have done without the katsup and mustard. I thought it tasted more like a sloppy joe steak because opf those ingredients. What about Dales and a bullion cube to add some depth of flavor to the sauce?

I have never  had Salisbury Steak because it's just glorified hamburger, but with a good quality ground beef this is over the top fantastic for me and my family, I think this will also be in place of meatloaf from now on, I did take one reviewers advise and add cream of mushroom soup along with the french onion and baked it for about 30 min. at 325....I was soooo happy with this recipe.

I gave it 4 stars only because I changed the gravy.  This is the second time I have made it, and we really like it.  The gravy is very forgiving if you use what you like best.  I added a little bit of beefy onion soup mix (about 1/3 of a packet) to the called for ingredients and used 2 lbs of ground beef .  For the gravy I used the rest of the french onion condensed soup, a can of golden mushroom, and a jar of beef gravy.  I omited all salt because the ingredients are a salty enough by themselves.  I also added a half can of water.  I served with mashed potatoes.  Thank you for the recipe!

Four stars because the steak patties were the best I have tried yet but the sauce left much to be desired. I think it was the ketchup that just didn't jive with us. However, I will be saving the recipe for the patties alone!!! Yum, thank you!

4 1/2 stars--followed recipe as is. Next time try the variations with cream of mushroom soup. Make sure to drain beef patties from grease. Jett complained most---on a doesn't like meatloaf kick. Ella liked.

I made this and have to admit it was not bad,but not great either.  It really was like meatloaf, plus the sauce tasted very processed.  I usually stay away from recipes that call for canned soups and such, but I thought I would try this due to the High ratings.  I can't say I agree with the rave reviews.  It was fine, but I won't be making it again..

This was fabulous. I used onion soup mix dissolved in water instead of soup as another user recommended. I'm sure it wasn't as good as the real thing, but this was still one of the best dinners I've ever made.

Delicious!! I followed some of the reviewers' advice and kind of changed the sauce- used the ketchup, flour and worcestershire sauce as well as a good bit of water and a pack of beefy onion soup mix and a jar of beef gravy.  Came out so great- even the kids raved over it.  Will definitely be making this again :)

I make this all of the time. The first time I made it I did exactly what it said. Now I eyeball all of the ingredients and add a little more Worcestershire sauce. I love mushrooms and I always throw a package in to cook with the gravy. My family is full of picky eaters. This is one thing they will all eat.

Good basic recipe. I added a can of mushroom/garlic soup as suggested by some and the sauce/gravy was delicious. I think next time I may not bother with the condensed onion soup and may just chop in a bit of onion to help decrease the salt the still keep the flavour. Good supper and easy!

Great recipe! I made it exactly as the recipe called for.  I used 93 % ground beef and did not have a greasy gravy but only made 4 patties instead of 6.  My family loved this recipe and the only complaint is that I did not double the gravy (we're from the South and love our large portions especially of gravy or sauces).  This is a keeper and will be made again real soon!

The family loved it. The gravy was very good, but I double the gravy.  I added onion slices when I was cooking the meat. I will make this again.

I just made this recipe and it was delicious! Except I altered it to be healthier with wheat flour, virgin olive oil to brown the meat, sea salt and my personal meat seasoning which includes meat tenderizer, mrs dash table salt, garlic salt, and lemon pepper. Plus barsely. Then instead of cooking it in a skillet after browning, I followed a comment on the reviews here by putting them in a oven pan and cooking it at 300 for 30mins to prevent the patties from falling apart and it worked! My family loved it! Plan to make it again and again! ;D

Something in this I did not care for in the flavor. I omitted the dry mustard, used crm mush soup instead of French Onion, added Kitchen Bouquet and doubled the "sauce" to put on my rice. OK and easy, just not one to make a perm. spot on my menus.

I had to doctor it up with Kitchen Bouquet, Dale's Seasoning, and a half can of cream of mushroom soup.  A couple of the patties fell apart in the pan.  Took a long time to cook all the way through, and I had to keep adding water to the pan otherwise the gravy started to burn. 

I've come to the conclusion that anything with Worcestershire sauce in it  tastes strange.

LOVED IT!! Used cream of mushroom soup for the gravy ( I doubled the gravy), I used none in the meat. I did add onion soup mix to the meat and too the gravy. Soooooo good. Thanks for the recipe!

Easy..yes. Tasty? Not so much. It was quite bland. I added one whole chopped onion on top of the gravy after browning to give it a more chunky gravy (DO NOT SAUTEE BEFORE, it will burn the onion). Recipe calls to make 6 patties, I made 7. Also added garlic pepper, spicy creole seasoning, and shoved some crushed garlic cloves inside the steaks for more flavor. The gravy should be tripled, wasn't enough to serve for all 7 steaks AND mashed potatoes (i made rosemary mashed potatoes, which was a good hint of some nature with the steak). All in all, good for a starter salisbury steak, but not good by itself.

So easy so good, I bet this can be made with less fattening ground turkey as well:)  Shh but um I cheated by mixing all the dry seasonings in with the ground beef and adding 1/4 cup of water to 1 12 Oz jar of Heinz Savory Beef gravy for the 20 min simmer.

I followed this recipe to a T and loved it! It was very tasty and so easy to make.  The thing I loved most was that I prepared the "steaks" and the sauce earlier in the day. I stored both separately in the fridge until I was ready to make dinner. It freed up after school time for homework help and spending time with the kids rather than dinner preparation! I will definitely be making this again. Thanks!

My family loved this!  Made a few changes as well, I also doubled the garlic and used the microwave method someone else suggested which worked great and saved TONS of time.  Also added 1/2 C dried minced onions to the meat and used beefy mushroom soup instead of french onion.  For the gravy used a family size cream of mushroom soup, the remainder of the can of beefy mushroom soup and another entire can of beefy mushroom.  Went fantastic with garlic mashed potatoe recipe from this site!  A new family favorite for us!

I have made much better salisbury steak.  This was just okay.  The meat needs more flavoring and we did not care for the gravy. The only alteration I made from this recipe was that I added mushrooms to the gravy. I don't think that affected the outcome.  In the future I will add more seasonings to the meat (at least some garlic) and use Lipton Onion Mushroom soup mix made according to package directions for the gravy.  I'll probably add some sauteed onions and mushrooms also.

I actually loved this! I personally didn't like the ketchup gravy sauce, so I wound up putting a few beef buillion cubes in & it turned out great. Was great with mashed potatoes.

I'm the odd man out on this recipe.  I know most people reviewed how much they loved it, but honestly, this won't be making a repeat appearance.  After reading the reviews I made some adjustments and it tasted like a baked, dry burger with soup pour over it.  I did reduce the ketchup and didn't add salt, there was plenty of sodium with just the soups.  The gravy was ok, the meat wasn't.

This was a big hit. I made one addition by adding a little hot sauce to the gravy. My picky eaters told me to "add it to the rotation".

This was wonderful.  Super simple ~ I'm not into measuring so just eyeballed the ingredients and it was great.  I doubled the gravy, added red wine instead of water, and added an envelope of onion soup mix to the burgers.  Forgot to add the mushrooms I so desparately wanted but it didn't need them.  Can you say YUMMY?!

This is a great recipe, though, I did change it slightly. I omitted the ketchup in favor of Open Pit original BBQ sauce. I'm not a ketchup fan and the BBQ sauce added a slight tangy flavor but it was delicious. I also played around with the amount of soup and bread crumbs for the meat mixture adding slightly more than called for. The first few times I made this I formed the meat into patties like it says, but this last time I made a meatloaf out of it and it came out perfect. I cooked it in a 350 degree oven for 1 hour and 20 minutes. I dumped the sauce(I doubled the amount of sauce) right in the pan with it and every 20 minutes or so would spoon the sauce over the top of the loaf. When it was done it had a nice glaze and was delicious.

I had high hopes for this after reading all the positive reviews (and I'm only giving it 2 stars because my husband said it was good), but there was something off about the sauce. The meat tasted alright though. Will not make this again - at least not without major tweaking.

EXTREMELY good.  Rave reviews.  Tastes so authentically salisbury steak!  I followed the most helpful review and used cream of mushroom soup as well as the french onion soup in the gravy and skipping the salt, but, I did not double ANYTHING.  It turned out so super fab!  Tons of gravy.  I baked it uncovered, but will try covered next time to get thinner gravy.

This turned out great! It's hard for me to make a dish that pleases my meat and potatoes loving husband and picky son at the same time. The meat patties held together nicely. I cooked it in my electric skillet which helped everything cook evenly and not stick. I even liked the sauce, though I was skeptical at first since it called for ketchup. However, I think next time I will omit the ketchup and use the onion soup mix like suggested to get a more authentic gravy flavor.

I will never use the canned French onion soup again...it is too sweet.  I added a packet of the beefy onion soup mix and lots of water to mask the sweetness, but it didn't really work and then it was just too salty.

This recipe tastes excellent and is extremely easy to prepare. I have no real cooking skills to speak of, but I had absolutely no problems preparing and cooking this.  The only change I made is that I sauteed sliced mushrooms with butter in the skillet after cooking the patties, set them aside, and then added them to the sauce and patties about 5 minutes before they were done cooking. Nom!

I have always looked for a good Salisbury Steak recipe and then I found this one.  My husband raves about it.  The only thing I do differently is to add chopped onion to the meat and I double the gravy ingredients for that extra to go on potatoes and the meat.  Very yummy and eay to make!

This came out moist (although I think that was because we mistakenly bought 80/20 beef and not much fat came out during initial searing), but I thought the sauce was too cloying and tangy - all I could taste was too much worcestershire with hints of ketchup - the flavors never melded.  My fiance however loved it.  We served it over Garlic Mashed Red Potatoes on this site, which was really good.

Just happened to have all of the ingredients in the kitchen and was thrilled with how easy it was to make and how great it tasted!  My husband also loved it as well as my 6 y.o. and 3 y.o. who is very difficult to please.  Great recipe!

**** ok i just finished making this recipe with the changes in gravy-1 can cr. of mushroom and 1 can french onion and 1 pckt. of onion soup mix, well the gravy was a little salty way too much sodium, i would suggest using 1/2 pkt of the onion soup mix and 1 can of water, it had a good flavor but a little tooo salty for me overall this was a good recipe--minus the salt!!!

This was a great recipe.  Instead of using ground beef I used cube steak and added the salt and pepper to the sauce and omit the bread crumbs.  I also sauteed some fresh sliced mushrooms with an onion and boom supper in 15 minutes on a dime budget.

We loved this recipe. I did follow the others advice and use 1 can of condensed golden cream of mushroom and 1 packet of brown gravy in addition to the condensed french onion soup. I did pan fry them some then baked @400 for 30 mins then brought it down to 350 for another 30 minutes all in the gravy. At first the gravy/sauce tasted a little off but as it baked it really meshed well together. It was delicious and my husband keeps reminding me to put it on our menu options list. Next time I will try it with the origional recipe. I initially thought the onion flavor might be too strong with 2 cans of the onion and hubby might not like it. I would deffinetly recommed doubling the sauce if serving with mashed potatoes as we did. SOOOO yummy! Thanks for the recipe, it's a keeper!

I loved this it was quick and easy and very tasty.  I had to improvise based on what I had in the house.  I had no condensed onion soup so I used a can of cream of mushroom soup and added a pack of onion soup mix to it.  I used the remainder of that mixture for the gravy with 2 beef bouillon cubes and water and cornstarch to thicken.  I also had no breadcrumbs and used crushed up butter crackers.  It was so good and sooo easy.

I'd have liked to have given this 3.5 stars if I could it's not quite a four star dish for me, but it was still tasty. I could not find the condensed soup required so used ordinary French Onion soup. Because of that I didn't add any to the meat as it would have made the burgers too sloppy. I followed the recipe as stated otherwise, to give it a fair trial. I was afraid that the sauce would taste too much of tinned soup, but I couldn't detect it at all, maybe because the ketchup flavour was too prominent. Next time I will definately reduce the amount of ketchup used. This is one I will need to tinker with, but is a very good base.

My husband and I as well as 2 friends loved this. It was super easy. I made and browned the meat up first and then put in the pan in the fridge until about 30 minutes until serving time. An easy recipe to fix when you're not exactly sure what time you will be serving.     I did add extra water, making more gravy and didn't add as much salt. Other than that no changes needed.

It was pretty tasty, but not a traditional salisbury steak at all. I think it's more of a twist on meatloaf. I think the ketchup is a bit much.

Very good!  Followed the recipe exact.  I think next time I will add some chopped onions.  I thought the ketchup measurement was good.  If your family likes gravy, I would def. double the gravy.

It was good...my kids loved it!  However...something was off, maybe the ketchup? I did add mushrooms and onions, I cant imagine it without them. It was a little orange in color, I was have preferred darker brown. But all in all in was yummy! I will definatly make it again...with some adjustments :)

This is a keeper!  My hubby, 1 yr old, 4yr old and 7 yr old all loved it.  It's rare to have a recipe they all agree on.  I followed the instructions exactly (other than doubling the gravy mix as suggested by other reviewers) and I think next time I'll reduce the mustard powder.  It was a little overwhelming.  But thanks for the recipe Kelly - it's going into my rotation!  So easy!!!

I followed the recipe with only one exception...I used one can of mushroom soup with the rest of the onion soup for the sauce. Had I not added the mushroom soup the ketchup would have  been overpowering...to tangy. My meat did not hold it's shape and stirring the sauce while in the pan is difficult with the meat in there. My sauce stuck and my meat fell apart. We ate it over our mashed potatoes like a meat gravy. The taste was good, really good, but I was disappointed in how it looked.

This was very good. I think I may have added a little too much soup to the meat mixture because the patties did not stay together that well.  But the flavor was great!

This was pretty good, but not great.  The gravy was just a touch off.  I'll make again and figure out a little better mix for us.  I think it was the mustard powder.

I used only one lb of ground beef to the other ingredients.  I had no problem with patties falling apart like some other reviewers had mentioned.  Also I sautéed some onions and mushrooms in butter and spread them over the browned patties before adding sauce to pan and simmering. I omitted the ketchup in the sauce.

Made the recipe as is, except doubled the gravy (so we could put it over mashed potatoes).  Patties turned out great using lean ground beef.  My kids loved the gravy, but my husband and I thought it was a bit too sweet - maybe the ketchup?  Other than that, easy, fast and good!

I"m not much for changing things up. That is why I like Daily Dish. I made this for dinner one night and my husband and I thought it was very tasty. Will be making again and again. Only thing I did change was the servings.. from 6 to 4.

very good and very easy to make.  I only had one can of french onion soup so had to improvise with a package of Lipton onion soup and 1/2 cup of water to make more gravy. Served it over egg noodles. My grandkids loved it.  Hubby asked that I make it again soon. Steaks were very tender. Going to try it using cubed steak next time. Thanks for sharing Kelly.

This is a GREAT tasting recipe. It doesn't taste like TV dinner steaks. It has its own unique flavor that is delicious!  I wanted to add some golden mushroom soup to the gravy, but the store was out so I bought beefy mushroom instead. I added it to another can of french onion soup for the gravy, along with adding a splash of soy sauce and a pinch of sugar. I omitted the mustard powder. This was well worth trying. One of the best recipes I have found on this site.

good flavor. perhaps because i used really lean ground beef, the patties came out kind of dry.    i am genuinely curious about the previous comment as to why this is unhealthy.  We try to be conscious with the food we eat but i was not sure which ingredients stand out as "junk".  (i used mostly organic and local ingredients in this recipe... is it the canned soup that's really horrible?

Made this for dinner and it was great.  Exceptional gravy---which is so important to me.  I hate fake tasting gravy and refuse to use any jar or envelope type, or the cream soups to make gravy.  I was very happy with both the taste and the quantity of the gravy.  Hubby loved it too!

Made it as is, and it was tasty. Like other reviewers, I will try onion soup mix next time, as this is definitely on my dinner rotation. Served with egg noodles and canned corn. This could turn into a comfort food!

Made this recipe with the ingredients listed. And based on this recipe i would make again. I did grill my burgers ahead of time just because its so hot in my house. The salisbury steak was good but next time i will tweak it more to my family's taste.

Husband loved it! The only tweaks I made were adding 1/4 cup minced onion to beef mixture & adding Golden Mushroom soup to the gravy. Also omitted the ketchup. Was GREAT!!! A do-over at our house

Your recipe is the same one I use.  I also make a double batch of sauce for mashed potatoes.  It is different than the typical Salisbury Steak and is my favorite.

I have made other versions of this recipe, but found my family prefers this one.  I have four small kids and finding something everyone will eat is pretty tough.  They love the meat and the sauce over egg noodles.

I thought this was really good and easy to make. My husband wasnt sure if he would like it or not because of the "gravy" but he did. I might add some mushrooms in it next time but will definitely make again.

My 7 year old son and I made this for my mom and step-dad, and everyone loved it.  A delicious meal, simple enough for the little ones to help.  We'll definitely be having this for dinner again.

Not what I had in mind.  I only gave this two stars because the meat had good flavor, but the gravy left a lot to be desired.

Amazing recipe and such a relief from the frozen store bought brand.  Easy to make and delicious my wife loved it.  I baked them in the oven after grilling them for a time and the came out perfect.  One of my new favorite foods to cook.

this was a GREAT recipe. I actually made these with ground turkey for a lower fat option and it was excellent. I added some garlic to the meat mixture and made the lipton mushroom and onion soup gravy. I served it over garlic mashed potatoes and the hubby loved it!

I did the meat as it was written. I browner the meat on both sides then put the patties in a baking pan. I followed the gravy recipe except I didn't add the water then I add one can of cream of mushroom soup, two jars of savory beef fat free gravy, garlic powder and onion powder. I put the gravy over the meat, covered it with foil then baked it at 400 for 45 min. Turned out better then I thought.

YUM!!  This was absolutely wonderful and very tasty, I made the sauce by adding beef gravy and doubled it and it was absolutely delicious.   This recipe is now on my comfort foods list, thank you for sharing this with us, and will be making it again soon.

Made this exactly as stated in the recipe...it was very good but I agree with other reviewers, a bit sweet and not enough gravy.  Next time will add cream of mushroom along with the onion soup, and maybe omit the ketchup altogether.

The patties were really good. I would definitely make this again. I did double the gravy and it went well with mashed potatoes.

This was AWESOME!  I made it by the directions, but took others advice and didn't use as much ketchup.  My husband is an extremely picky eater and he ate 3 out of the 6!!  Will be making this again!!

I love this recipe!  The only change I make is that I use 1/2 teaspoon of prepared mustard, because I don't have mustard powder on hand usually.

Thought I'd try something different, and I tried this recipe as is but it wasn't very good, in fact it was very bland. I didn't make the sauce but a good steak should stand on it's own. The meat was almost tasteless and dry. Next time I will just make it the way I always do with all my own seasonings.

I made this dish 2 weeks ago and I'm cooking it today again. I added little of Worcestershire sauce and ketchup in meat for more flavor and poured 2.8 oz can of dry french fried onions on top. Turned out yummy!

I thought this was good, but not great, my kids and husband liked it and it was easy to make, they did ask for it to be made again, but I am used to salisbury steak having more of  beef gravy,I think next time I make this I will try using a jar of homestyle beef gray instead of the gravy in the recipe. The patties were good and worth making again. Although my husband said not to change a thing!

An all around wonderful dish that is so easy to do and tastes great.  With my 10" pan I had to cook three steaks, then do the other three and finally squish them all together for the simmering part. As everyone else said, more gravy would've been wonderful.   But, just follow the recipe and it turns out great. I guess I'm only giving it four stars because I'm trying to be a harsher critic, but this is wonderful.

Wow!  I was searching for a salisbury steak recipe mainly for my college age son, he loves salisbury steak with gravy.  This recipe seemed easy enough and the reviews were pretty good.  I made it the other night for dinner and it was a hit, my husband and younger son gave it 2 thumbs up!  I followed the recipe except I added a bit of garlic powder to the meat mixture, and I doubled the gravy portion as others had suggested.  The patties were very moist with a really good flavor.  I was a little worried about the gravy being too tangy with the ketchup/worcestershire sauce as some have said, but I thought it had a great flavor.  I can't wait to make it for my other son when he comes home for spring break!

My husband loved this.  I followed some suggestions and cut the ketchup in half.  I also browned in frying pan and then put in foil lined casserole dish (poured gravy on top) and baked at 400 for 45 minutes.  It is a keeper.

This came out very good, but I simmered it to long and the favor intensified making it just a bit salty.  Over all a very good recipe.  I will make this again but I will cut back on the salt a little next time.

I really didn't like the sauce. The ketchup makes it really acidic and it doesn't taste like "Salisbury Steak." It is still good, but I was looking for something else.

This was an excellent salisbury steak recipe.  They came out perfect without changing anything in the recipe.  On a personal note, the gravy was not a favorite for me.  It was very good, but the ketchup/worstishire sauce taste was strong.  I will definitely keep the salisbury steak recipe, but I might try to tweek the gravy.

My boyfriend's favorite meal is Salisbury Steak.   This recipe was great and he loved it.  I tried to make salisbury steak twice before this recipe and it just didn't give me the taste I was going for.  So, Thank you; thank you the recipe was amazing.

Excellent, quick recipe. I used tomato sauce instead of ketchup since someone said the gravy was too sweet. I had to use oil spray because my beef was lean. Also used onion, garlic & celery in patties rather than have it bland as someone else had stated. I didn't have onion soup so I used real onions in the gravy also. Wonderful meal!

My family really liked this one. I made a few changes as well. I used Italian bread crumbs in the meat and used a little extra to help it stick together. In the gravy I used 1/2 cup ketchup and doubled the worcestershire. I was really happy with the end result.

Simple, tasty, and kids liked it too.  To add flavor, I added minced garlic and substitued mushroom/onion soup mix (w/1/2 cup of water) for the condensed soup.  Turned out great!

Did recipe as is (always do this the first time I make it). Very "oniony"...tangy. Next time I think I will use the lipton beefy onion mix instead of the condensed soup or use beefy mushroom. I love onions, but something was just a bit off. Had a decent flavor otherwise...think this is a good base to start off with but needs tweaking to personal tastes.

Great recipe!  Easy, quick and the 1st time I have served a meal in months that all 3 kids have liked.  Would omit the salt.  Little too salty.  French onion soup adds enough sodium to this recipe.   Also a very inexpesive recipe to make on a budget.

This was a great meal with a few changes. I substituted the sauce for 2 cans of the 12 oz Heinz beef gravy and mixed it with 2 tablespoons of French onion recipe mix. It was terrific. I also changed the regular bread crumbs for Italian bread crumbs and added a 2 tablespoons of French onion recipe mix. Family loves it!

When I decided to make this recipie our local store was out of french onion soup so I used an altered recipie someone else posted with Golden Mushroom soup and take out the ketchup. It was PERFECT! I would give it a 5 star. I tried it again with 100% the original recipie (french onion and ketchup) and we threw just about all of it out, no one liked it. I would say the meat and style in which it is prepared is perfect, but the flavors of the sauce will make of break this dish, so I gave it a 3. The recipie I wrote down in my book was altered to exclude ketchup, use Golden Mushroom soup and double the sauce to put over mashed potatoes.

I added a can of mushroom soup for the gravy and added some dry onion soup mix to to the gravy and the ground beef.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe as stated.  It was delicious!  My picky eating 4 & 5 year olds even liked it!

Made as directed and while the actual salisbury steaks were good, the gravy was not. Noone liked the flavor and mostly ate only the meat and noodles I made to go with it. I don't think I did anything wrong, but the onion soup flavor was so overpowering.

Made this tonight for dinner, DH and I both loved it. I cooked fresh mushrooms and added a can of cream of mushroom soup to the gravy.  Next time would not add ketchup.  Perfect meal for cold nights, and very easy.

Recipe as is didn't appeal to me so only 3 stars.  With the addition of beef stock, garlic, onions, mushrooms, and gravy would definitly kick it up a knotch!  However, at the end of the day still is just salisbury steak..LoL.

Really enjoyed this one.  We normally buy the frozen salisbury steaks and were ready for a change.  The meat was moist and tender and very tasty.  I was a little worried though, when most of my gravy mix was either soaked up in the meat or cooked off.  So after removing the meat from the pan I added another 1/4 cup of water to the drippings so that we would have enough gravy for the meat and our mashed potatoes.  I am thinking I will probably double the gravy next time and maybe add some fresh mushrooms :)

The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because it doesn't make enough sauce. I double the sauce and use a little bit of cream of mushroom soup in it also.

This was good, but wasn't really something to write home to Mama about. It tastes just like the Salisbury Steak I usually fix. I usually used seasoned croutons, a few other seasonings with extra lean ground chuck, and use golden mushroom soup to make my gravy. I'm no saying it tasted bad or anything, it just wasn't a big surprise for me. Thanks anyway.

This was very good - more of a tomato taste (due to the ketchup) than I'm used to in Salisbury Steak, but still very good and easy to make.  If you want lots of extra sauce/gravy for mashed potatoes, then definitely double the sauce ingredients.  Otherwise, the amount of sauce is sufficient for the meat by itself.

This was delicious!  I did add less ketchup, and didn't follow other people's advice on how to make them stick together better, so they were a little difficult to flip on the skillet.  They turned out great, though, very melt-in-your-mouth.

We loved this recipe! I did add mushrooms and chopped green onion to the skillet as well as a touch of soy sauce. I added a little more water to thin the sauce a bit and let them cook on medium heat for 20 min then simmer covered for another 10 while everything else cooked. Turned out perfectly done, no pink but not overcooked

I skipped putting the ketchup in at all because of other reviews and it just didn't sound good to me.  I did add a little more worcestershire than it called for maybe 4 tablespoons.  After mixing up the gravy before I put it in the pan I added just one can of cream of mushroom soup to the mixture because what was called for just didn't seem like enough.  Also I sliced up 5 fresh mushrooms and put it in with the gravy.  This turned out really good.  My fiance who said he doesn't even care for salisbury steak went back for seconds.  The next time I try it I will make sure to drain the hamburger patties really really good before simmering with the gravy because it turned out a little too greasy for us.  I didn't have any problems with the steaks falling apart.  I think the trick is not to "handle" or flip them too much.  We really did enjoy it and I do recommend this recipe!

i could not find french onion soup so i just bought a packet of onion soup from walmart (i'm cheap). i added 1/2 of the dry mix to the beef mixture and the other 1/2 to 4 cups of water along with a packet of beef vegetable soup mix (it has noodles) and cooked it. when the soup was cooked i added 1/4 of it to the beef mixture. i added the rest of the cooked soup to the gravy mix and also a tin of mushrooms. (i also doubled everything but the ketchup like other reviewers mentioned and deleted the salt) the beef i made into patties and cooked them until the tops were browned (the inside was still pink) on the george foreman grill and then added them to the gravy mix and cooked it on medium for 20 minutes. was delish and am adding it to my dinner rotation.

The steaks themselves were great.  We didn't like the gravy, so we omitted it and made just a regular beef gravy and put over it as well as homemade mashed potatoes.  Done this way, it was a hit with my picky family.

I have made this recipe for many years and it is always a favorite. I have a family of 3 and I have to double it every time for leftovers! I think today I will make with ground turkey as a healthier alternative.

I made this recipe for dinner a few nights ago.  I thought it was great.  The meat and gravy had a terrific taste.  However, my kids (age 11 & 7) didn't feel the same.  They thought the gravy had an ackward taste.  Maybe the mustard powder?  Next time I'll omit that ingredient and see what response I get from them.

You need to DEFINITELY cut the ketchup down to half, or double everything for the sauce except the ketchup. With these changes, it comes out decent.

So Good! My  husband and picky children loved this dish!  I increased the gravy  by doubling everthing but the ketchup(as suggested). I added 1 cup of fresh sliced mushrooms and sauteed with after the onions were soft, which I put on top of the browned patties and then into a preheated 325 degree oven covered for 30 min, they turned out perfect. Paired nicely with homemade mashed potatoes and a salad. Will make again for sure!

This tasted too 'oniony' to me. The second time I made it I used condensed beef broth instead of the onion, added sliced mushrooms,a dash of Gravy Master, and left out the ketchup as others suggested. I agree that this is a good recipe with some tweaking needed to suit your tastes.

This was good but next time I wouldn't use the ketchup and maybe use some minced onions for a little more flavor.   Will definitely try again but I love the slow cooker salisbury steak recipe from this site a lot.

I doubled the sauce except for the ketchup.  I don't know if I shaped these "patties" differently than I am supposed to but I had two different people call them mini meatloaves.  It didn't matter though because they were fantastic.  It actually is replacing my meatloaf recipe! :-)

Yum Yum Yum.  There is something to the combination of dried mustard, worcestershire, ketchup and the condensed french onion soup that is complex and tangy and ooooh so good.  Big hit with ALL of the family.  Like to add additional can of beef broth so there is more sauce to use as gravy for mashed potatoes.

This recipe is very good.  One of my husband's new favorites.  As suggested by another reviewer, I do double the gravy recipe, but not the ketchup, and I do add a package of mushroom and onion dry soup mix.  It is simple and delicious.

This was delicious. My husband loved it and said it was the best salisbury steak he has ever had. just don't go overboard on the ketchup and mustard powder, or it can overpower the meat! Great recipe

Over all this recipe was pretty good. It did fall apart for me also and just a bit too much ketchup. I will make again with less ketchup.

Amazing taste. I followed the directions exactly, except I added an extra can of soup to the gravy. I don't like the preparation directions, however. I have my own way of preparing it, which involves cooking the patties in the oven, and then adding them to a stove top thickened gravy. That's what's easiest for me, but I don't think there's a right or wrong. This recipe is very versatile.

I mixed the patties with the breadcrumbs, 1/2 of the french onion soup, garlic powder and onion powder, sauteed them on the stove, then sauteed some mushrooms and onions and put the patties and the onions/mushrooms in an oven dish.   This rating is based on the patties as I did not want to use the ketchup/soup/dry soup mixture for the sauce. I deglazed the pan with some beef broth and because I didn't want to waste the other 1/2 of the french onion soup I added that in, then added some light cream and a dollop of dijon mustard and cornstarch to thicken it up. The patties doused in this sauce made them edible. Everyone ate theirs but didn't go back for seconds.

The steak was bland.  I didn't even bother with the sauce after reading the reviews, I just made my own brown gravy.  Would've been good if the steak had more flavor.

These were great! I added sauteed onions on top and instead of placing them back in the pan i put them in the oven for 25 mins at 400 deg. They turned out perfect! My husband ate the leftovers the next day for lunch. I will be making these once a week from now on!

I made this recipe without changes and it turned out great.  The recipe does not say what temperature to use after the sauce is added.  I used low and it was perfect.

This was a very interesting recipe. It was tangy and sweet which was not at all what I was looking for in a salisbury steak recipe.  However, it was good and we all liked the taste but I wanted a brown gravy like base.  The patties themselves had excellent flavor and I will use this recipe again but find a different gravy.

The flavor of the meat was delicious and my patties did not break apart like some other reviewers. I only gave it 4 stars because the ketchup taste was overpowering.

It was great! Very easy and flavorful. My teen son who is very picky loved it so much he almost ate mine. I used ground bison instead of ground beef and it was very tasty. I'll definitely make this again.

After reading some of the Reviews, I was a little scared to try the Sauce, so I got some Backup just in case. Well, I really didn't need any! I thought the Sauce tasted fantastic, but I do agree that there wasn't enough of it. This was my first Time making Salisbury Steak and I was really surprised how good this was. I did not have any Trouble with the Patties falling apart at all. Love this Recipe and will make again!

I was not a fan of the tangy taste to the sauce, so I added on teaspoon of cornstartch and just enough water to disolve it in a cup, and stirred it into the sauce, once thickened a bit I added 1 1/2 cups of water and 1 1/2 teaspoons of beef boullion to it to give more sauce and a more meaty flavor and my family just loves it.

Like others, I like to review recipes "as written". This recipe was good, however I thought the sauce was a little over-run with ketchup. A definite keeper, with a few modifications for next time. Thanks!

The KIDS liked this recipe.
It is Tasty, easy and quick.
I have recommened this to a few friends and they have made it as well.
Use another can of soup to make gravy.
Mix 1 can of onion soup with flour or cornstarch.

Doubled the gravy as suggested with the exception of the ketchup. It is necessary, especially if you are having potatoes. Put in beef stock instead of extra can of french onion and sautéed an onion to add to gravy in beef drippings. Gravy too sweet for the husband. I will make this again, but either cut out the ketchup, or just add 1T.

I thought this was pretty good recipe to start with.  Needed quite a bit of tweaking but that's ok, I rarely go strictly by the recipe I like to add my own personal touch. I added the cream of mushroom soup as suggested by other reviews and onion/mushroom dried soup mix. But that made it quite salty so I balanced that with some red wine,a little water (my sauce was pretty thick) more pepper and some bay leaf and thyme dried herbs.
I havent eaten yet just been sampling the gravy!  But I also did as suggested and browned the patty's in skillet and then put the patties in a pyrex dish and put in the oven with the gravy poured over.  Tastes pretty good so far and I think the family will like it.
I havent made Salisbury steak in a long, long time but it sounded good and I am very happy to have found this recipe.

Delicious! I didn't know that making Salisbury Steak would be so easy. I added chopped onions to the meat mixture; didn't have a can of french onion, so I substituted with 1/3 a can of beef consumme. Took patties out of pan when browned, added mushrooms, then deglazed pan with remaining beef consumme and added additional can. In bowl mixed together 2 cans of Cream of Mushroom soup, 2 pkg of onion soup mix, plus doubled all gravy ingredients except ketchup. Added that to pan and mixed with consumme. Then added patties back to mix and cooked 20 min. Served with Mashed Potatoes and green beans

This recipe was soooooooooooo good!  I had never made Salisbury Steak before, except those frozen nasty things, so I was totally clueless on how this was going to taste.  It was really good!  I would definitely make more sauce next time though as this was not enough.  I did accidentally put way too much powdered mustard in the sauce, but it was still excellent.  I am sure it would be even better with the right amount.  My 2 year old usually eats mostly veggies and pasta.  She is not a meat eater and she hates potatoes of any kind.  I still give them to her when I make them because I don't want a picky eater.  Anyway, she ate a half of a serving of the steak and all of the potatoes with the gravy!  She absolutely loved it and after every bite, she would say Ummm!!!! and rub her belly!  You have to try this recipe!

I thought the meat was a little bland but the sauce added to the taste. I will try it again for a family meal but add a little garlic and diced onion to the meat. Overall it was an easy dish to prepare, more of a homestyle meal than a company dish.

I can't say I tried this recipe as is since I did not have condensed onion soup but I used 2 cans of creamed mushroom soup (to have extra sauce) and an envelope of beef mushroom onion soup mix.  I then followed recipe and we absolutely loved it..my husband even had seconds.  Thank you!

These were good. I used mushroom soup instead of the onion and added a half a packet of dried onion soup mix, divivded between the meat and the gravy. I just browned the meat in a pan on the stove and then transfered them to a dish, poured gravy over them and cooked them the rest of the way in the oven. 350 degrees for 20-25 minutes. Served with mashed potatoes.

I took some others advice and baked it on 350 for 45 minutes. However, I did find that the gravy had a layer of grease on the top.

This was a good recipe!  I think the meat could have used a bit more seasoning, but the sauce was surprisingly yummy. I did make a couple of sauce changes: I didn't have mustard powder, so I put a little bit of yellow mustard in it. Also, there didn't seem to be enough sauce for my liking, so I also added a packet of brown gravy and some water to make the sauce very thin.  It thickened up perfectly as it cooked.

I decided to make a few changes like others did.  I cooked the meat in the pan, then drained it and placed it in a baking dish.  The meat was great, but with the sauce I also added a can of cream of mushroom soup, and the flavor was bad. I am not sure if it was ketchup or dried mustard.  It was edible but I am not eating the leftovers.  I will make this again, but will keep the gravy simple.

I had to substitute Cream of Mushroom for the Cream of Onion and we used the South Arican beef, which had a lot of grissle so this was not a big hit.

We really liked this. It was delicious! My husband really liked the tang from the ketchup, however my son and I did not. Next time I will make it without ketchup (more like just gravy) and my hubby can add ketchup if he wants to. This was a definate keeper! Thanks!

I love this recipe!!!! So Yummy! I follow the recipe exactly, except adding 1 extra can of French onion soup, and using the prepared mustard instead. My husband request it once a week now. By the way, I didn't add egg in meat, but add milk for 1.5 cup. I think it make the patties tender. :)

AWESOME!!! I couldn't stop eating the gravy. Modifications: I added 1 can of cream of mushroom --- sauteed chopped onions and mushrooms, mixed in with the gravy/sauce, then finally topped the steaks --- added 1 package of onion soup mix in with the bread crumbs. I sifted the seasoning so that there was only the onion flakes left.

The best recipe I've made in a while! I did take a few suggestions from other people, used a can of cream of mushroom, and dry packet of onion soup mix to the gravy.  I browned both sides of the  patti's and then baked it for about 45 min.. Served it with mashed potatos and green beans.  Will make this again!

This was an excellent simple recipe for a dish that I haven't eaten since I was a child.  I doubled the gravy recipe as suggested, so we'd have enough to use as gravy for potatoes.  The patties were a little large for us (we are small eaters), so I would make the patties smaller.  This served us two meals for a family of four!

Very easy and just ok tasting.  My husband and I found these too salty and the gravy was a bit overpowering.  Next time I will adjust the gravy and the salt.

Pretty good.  I did double the gravy, but used a can of golden mushroom soup instead of a second can of french onion.  I also cut back on the ketchup.  Next time I think I will omit it altogether.  I personally did not like the ketchup flavor undertones in the dish.  Nonetheless, it was a satisfying dish.

This has a very good flavor.  I will definitely fix this again, and soon.  I browned the meat thoroughly and then added the gravy and simmered (low setting) for 20 minutes in a covered skillet stirring the sauce every few minutes.  The meat was done perfectly and the sauce thickened nicely.  I made half again as much sauce and this turned out well since I also served mashed potatoes.  I also added small sliced portabella mushrooms to the sauce.

YUM!  I used Ally99s suggestion about the sauce.  I was worried it would be too salty so I used 25% less sodium cream of mushroom soup.  I also left out the ketchup altogether, I'm just not a fan and didn't really think it needed it.  We will be having this regularly.

I never had salisbury steak so I though I would try this recipe and it was just an OK dish. It was ediable. I think It would have been better if you didn't use the can of soup and make your own with beef broth and fresh onions. It's nice to try different things once in a while.

My husband raved over this one, said it was just like mom used to make.  It was a bit simple for me, but I am not a real meat and potatoes kind of girl  I made it exactly as the recipe called for.  Will make again.

I made this last night, added fresh mushrooms and cream of mushroom soup to the sauce to make extra gravy, with those changes in mind,this was the best recipe for salisbury steak I have ever tried and or eaten. My family raved over it and I do have some pickey eaters in my family, but not last night. I would rate higher than 5 if I could! I served with mashed potatoes and a green salad and crusty bread and it was a huge success! Thanks so much for an easy, delicious recipe.

Very tender and moist.  I used the suggestions of the other reviews.  I added a can of cream of mushroom soup & a jar of mushrooms.  Instead of salt I added a few table spoons of Lipton Onion soup.  I omited the ketchup.  Baked it for 30 minutes at 350 with gravy over the top.  It was perfect.  I will pass this recipe on and make it again.

Great flavor.  Even better the second day because the gravy was thicker.  Like others, I prefer not to use the ketchup, so I found a mushroom gravy mix that called for a cup of water which I added to the soup with the worcestershire sauce and flour.  Awesome.

I made this last night and served with whote rice and cabbage to complete the meal. My husband loved it, said it was the best dinner he had in a long time. Although, I cook frequently, I am trying more and more new recipes to change up the hum-drum of the same ole thing. I am going to make this for my family when they come to visit this weekend. Thanks for a great, easy, delicious recipe! I made it exactly as written and it was the BOMB!!! :)

I saw this recipe and had all the ingredients at home so I decided to try it since my family loves salisbury steak.  It was a total hit, even my mom said it was great and this recipe was a keeper!!!  I was so nervous, especially what my mom would think but when I tasted it I KNEW everyone would love it!  I did double the french onion soup, omitted the ketchup and salt and added 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup.  It was great!!!  Thanks for a great recipe!!!

Fantastic recipe!!.  I really try not to change anything in a recipe, but I did make 2 small additions to this one.  First, to the meat mixture, I added about 2 clove of pressed garlic.  Then, to the sauce mixture, because I had some sliced fresh mushrooms in the frige that I needed to use up, I added them.  That's all.  I will definitely make this again.

I had no issues with this recipe!  The only addition I made was adding onion to the ground beef, but that's something I do for everything I make.

The ketchup does give its own flavor, so it you aren't a fan of ketchup, omit it.

The patties didn't fall apart too much as long as I allowed them to brown on each side before attempting to flip, and instead of a metal spatula I used a heat safe icing spreader.  It didn't rip at the meat like my metal spatula did.

I, too, believe it is unfair to rate a recipe you have not tried in its original form first. However, that being said, I will say that this is, for my family, a 5 star recipe. Salisbury steak as my dad makes it has always been my "most favorite meal" and I beg him to make it for me every chance I get. I tried this version (on my own, without that pesky begging business) and thought it was very, very tasty. I may post my dad's version and then everyone can rate that separately. (His is very close to a lot of the "fixes" many posters suggested) I will not go into how he does it differently here because it is a somewhat different recipe. I loved this one too and believe it is worth 5 stars!

Trust me, it isn't like me to rate a recipe after I've done major changes to it, but I'm quite sure that even without changes I wouldn't have been satisfied.  The condensed soup (I used mushroom instead of onion) simply makes it super salty (and I hate salt!).  I don't think I'll be making this again but if I do I'll add milk to the soup before making the gravy.

Thank you, Serena, for the Lipton soup tip. My steaks came out incredibly! These were so good; the best salisbury steaks I've ever eaten! I made the garlic mashed potatoes secret recipe and mixed veggies. It all came together beautifully! Thank you!

So good but I did change somethings. I used a can of mushroom soup and a packet of onion soup mix. I also baked them at 325 for 35  mins.

I have used this recipe more times than I can count, and it is a huge hit every time. I've prepared it for many guests and everyone who tastes it raves about how delicious it is!

I love to make this recipe and freeze it. You can freeze the patties and gravy together in one Ziploc bag, or put them in seperate bags and containers, then reheat them in a large frying pan over medium heat. Delicious.

Edited:
I now have to triple this recipe to feed our entire family. The skillet isn't big enough to simmer that many patties. For a crowd like ours, brown the patties in shifts, then put them all in a large baking dish. Cover with gravy and keep in the oven at 250-300 while you put together the rest of the meal and wash your cookware. It turns out great.

This was my first time making salisbury steak and I had to make some changes based on what I had on hand.  I used crushed crackers instead of dry bread crumbs and cream of mushroom soup instead of french onion.  I did not use the dry mustard because I didn't have any.  I added some onion powder and garlic powder also.  My husband and I really liked it, but our picky kids would hardly touch it.

The Worstershire and onion soup made for a nice, lightly spicy mix, that we liked a lot. I did think the ketchup flavor was too prominent though. Next time I will use tomato sauce that isn't as sweet. And, will double the sauce, because I would prefer there be enough to put on mashed potatoes/starch side.

My husband made this dish for me and guests. It needed alot of extra seasonings to make it taste good. It tasted too much like a hamburger patty and not the salisbury steak taste that I was used to.

This is great. I've made it a couple times now, although I must admit it tastes more to me like meatloaf. My husband, who has never cared for meatloaf, actually really likes this because it differs from meatloaf in that it's not sweet at all. Definitely a keeper.

I've never made salisbury steak before until today I always cringed thinking back to the elementary cafe days. This recipe was very good. I did alter it to the suggestions made by the highest rated reviewer and the gravy was fantasic though a bit oniony, maybe a half packet of onion sup mix in the gravy next time. I also used fat free mushroom soup and it was excellent. I served with rice and broccoli

It was good. Altered by adding Lipton Onion Mushroom soup mix, cream of mushroom soup, no salt, 1/2 the ketchup. It was still a little salty but I will use less Lipton mix next time. Also used turkey. I doubled the gravy which was perfect.

I liked it alright. . . I followed the recommendations of the other reviewers.  Overall I'd have to say I prefer Stouffer's microwave dinners SS better, but they're the best ever!  I wasn't really a fan of the flour in the sauce.

This recipe was GREAT!  I am not a huge ground beef fan, but my husband of VERY few words said that this was a "home run" (which is two more words than he usually says about dinner)!  :)  My 2 year old son also gobbled this up, which I thought was great b/c he is normally not a meat eater.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, we will definitely be making this again.

While this recipe is excellent and quite easy, I would DEFINITELY NOT cook the steaks by pan.  They fell apart slightly.  I would place them while raw, as formed patties, into a casserole with a thin layer of gravy underneath them. I would cover them with another thin layer, place tin foil over the casserole and bake until they are cooked through.  Then, prior to serving, I would heat up the gravy and pour over.

Just finished making this.  Very promising. I used 93% lean ground beef and turned my back on it, so it got extra charred.  But, I think that will add to the flavor.  ;-)

Ehhhh...I was disappointed in this dish. I followed Ally99's directions and mine didn't turn out too well.  The meat was nice and tender, the taste favored meatloaf a lot.  The gravy just didn't do much for me.  It had an odd taste to it.  My kids wouldn't even eat the gravy on their mashed potatoes and thats not normal for them.

This was really tasty and very easy!  I was afraid that the gravy was going to spill out of my frying pan so I made it in a separate saucepot and poured it on the steaks on the platter. My daugher had two big pieces, which always means she really, really liked it.  Thanks.

Very good. Followed recipe exactly except doubled the gravy AND added ONE packet of dry onion soup. Maybe just a bit of onion overload, but nobody complained. Younger kids really liked, as did I. May cut use only 1/2 packet of dry soup next time. Also, did NOT add any salt anywhere and still was good. I love salty food and onions.

I was put off by the negative reviews of the sauce, but I was craving salisbury steak so badly I made my own sauce with soup mix like many other reviewers suggested.  It was bland as could be.  If I try this again, I will make the recipe as is. It couldn't be any worse than how mine tasted.  The meat "cakes" were good,  I added a lot of garlic and onion to it along with preseasoned bread crumbs.

I added some fresh parsley to the meat mixture...also didn't care too much for the gravy recipe.  Next time I will make gravy using Lipton onion soup mix.  You could really taste the ketchup and the worshistershire sauce which is why I didn't care for it.

The texture and flavor of the meat patties was VERY good though!

I used Cambell's onion soup mix instead of the canned French onion.Also DO NOT mess with the sauce! Instead I use Healthy Request Crm.of Mushroom plus one small can of Dawn Fresh Mushroom steak sauce.

I hate to be the only one, but I just did not like this, nor did my family.  I think it was the ketchup in there.  If I make this again, I will omit the ketchup and see if that helps.  With out the sauce they tasted like mini meatloaves.  Just not what I was looking for.  It was fairly easy to put together though, and was a quick meal.

Came together easily enough.  My husband didn't care for the ketchup in the recipe.  I think we'll make this again but omit the ketchup and add some garlic.

Ahhh-mazing!  My son wants this for his birthday now!  Only change I made was double the sauce and use part french onion soup and part GOLDEN mushroom soup (not the creamy variety).  Also added a bit of garlic and parsley.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!!! :)

this is fabulous!  I followed directions but doubled the recipe.  I agree with some of the other reviews in that there is a tad too much of a ketchup taste so next time i will use a bit less.  My husband took to work for lunch the next day and declared it "some great stuff"!!  My 9yr old actually ate his as well.  I used the extra sauce for mashed potatoes.  I will totally make this again!  Thanks

This was really good *and* quick!  I didn't add salt due to the high salt content of the soup.  I didn't have any dry mustard but added some from the fridge...about a teaspoon.  Next time I'll add about a quarter cup more bread crumbs as I usually use fresh.  Thanks!

This was pretty good.  I subbed Cream of Mushroom for the French Onion, otherwise I didn't really change anything.  We did like the "gravy" and didn't think the ketchup was overpowering.  It suited the meal.

I followed the recipe exactly and was not at all impressed! It was edible, but the ketchup flavor was too evident. If I make this again, I will follow others advice and skip the ketchup. Goodluck!

I'm rating this a 4, only because I added a can of cream of mushroom soup to the sauce, and I am glad I did because I don't think it would be as good without it.  My kids didn't want to eat this at first, but after I promised brownies for desert they ate it all up (they wouldn't have if they didn't like it, though) I made egg noodles to go along with this for the sauce and it was very yummy!  Thanks for the recipe!

Exceptional! I just love these. I made them for a party for my co-workers along with mashed potatoes! Huge hit with everyone! I pan-fried them the day ahead, and then put in the oven the day of the party and cooked at low temp for the afternoon, and WOW! These were awesome! Thank-you so much!

I did not think this recipe was that good at all. The patties kept falling apart and by the time it was read to serve it was just cooked ground beef with sauce. I was going to give this 3 stars but my toddler cleaned her plate (!!!?) and my boyfriend said it was "pretty good". I, personally, will not be making this again      unless asked.

This is one simple supper. Tasty too! I didn't have a can of soup mix, so I used 2 T. onion soup mix and 1 T. mushroom soup mixed with 1 1/2 c. water. I also cut the ketchup to 2 T. - more would have been overpowering.

This recipe is FINE as is and should be "starred" as it is written not rewritten.  It's not the same recipe then and rating it is a moot point.
(Sauce should be doubled though...if you like sauce) :-)

Wow this was good! We loved the sauce, next time I will double it.  I used a little less ketchup in the sauce and since I didnt have any french onion soup, I used a packet of dry french onion soup mix (so I didnt use any salt) with the hamburger and cambells beefy mushroom soup.

Easy comfort food, and SOOO much better than frozen. Update: I wanted to make this yesterday, but discovered that all I had in the cupboard was onion soup that was ready to eat (NOT condensed) and decided to give it a try anyway. The only changes I made were to add no water and the last 10 minutes or so I took the lid off to let the sauce reduce a little more.  It worked.

Theese were pretty good. I had to use A1 steak sauce instead of Worsercire sauce, and mustard instead of powdered mustard. The sauce was really tangy and good, but my boyfriend didn't care for it because he perfurs brown gravy. I thought the steaks themselves were very tender and tasty.

I thought this was really good.  My husband thought it was too "ketchup-y" but he's not a huge fan of ketchup.  I scaled this down to four servings and it was ready to eat in 30 minutes.  The sauce was really good over mashed potatoes.  I might use tomato sauce in place of ketchup next time to cut back on the sweetness.

This was good, tasted like meatloaf my family said.  Next time I will not use so much of the worchshire sauce it was overbearing.

Awesome!!  I followed the recipe for the steaks and they were amazing.  But I did use dry onion soup mix and followed the recipe for gravy.

This had what we considered to be an awful flavor but worse than that, it wasn't anywhere close to a salisbury steak flavor.  Didn't even seem to be anything I could work with to get to what I wanted.

This was so delicious!  I didn't have the condensed onion soup or ketchup, so I made my own.  For the soup, I sauteed some sliced onions with beef boullion and water.  For ketchup, I used 1/4 cup tomato sauce and sweetened it with some Splenda.  It was so easy and so much flavor.  This will be a regular meal in our rotation.

i made these 2 nights ago and i'm still eating some now ;) the leftovers are equally good. the only mistake i made was i doubled the amount of mustard as someone suggested. it kind of overpowered the taste but at any rate, this is still yummy, whether you eat it with rice or mashed potatoes. thanks, kevin for the recipe.

I made salisbury meatballs with these sans the bread crumbs to make them gluten free.  Served with rice- they are fantastic, just make sure to have enough gravy!

Very good recipe we enjoyed the meat and the flavor of the sauce.  I did not use worcestershire sauce and used Heinz 57 as hubby does not like the other.  It is definitely a keeper. We had it tonight for dinner.

This was a great recipe and we loved it but just too salty.  I used the condensed french onion soup, cream of mushroom soup and the dry onion soup mix and doubled the gravy.  Will try some of the other suggestions to cut down on the saltiness...but definitely will be added to my keeper stack of recipes.

This was a very good recipe. I used just under a pound of ground beef and kept the rest of the recipe the same. I made seven smaller sized patties, and since other reviewers mentioned the patties falling apart I made sure I was very careful flipping them. I had to use a turkey baster to drain off the excess grease since I couldn't really move them too much without them flaking. Anyway, they turned out very good, moist and flavorful. I was worried about the mustard and horseradish overpowering the sauce or giving it a strong taste, but you couldn't really tell it had those in it. It was very good, very easy and I will definately make this again.

4 1/2 stars on this one.  It is just as salisbury steak should be.  I have never made it before but will definitely make it again...changing nothing.  My picky 5 yr old even scarfed it down.  We all loved it!

Wow, what a fabulous recipe - one that is now in my permanent collection! I used 96% lean ground beef and it still was super moist and flavorful. If you like a little kick, quarter/seed a hot pepper or two (I used hot red peppers) and add while simmering.

Easy weeknight meal.  I substituted garlic salt for regular salt and omitted the sauce.  Instead I used two packages of brown gravy mix.  I served over mashed potatoes.  Picky husband had seconds!

This was pretty good, but not spectacular.  I followed the recipe and doubled the gravy.  I thought the gravy was on the salty side and it needed something.  Oh, and I switched the breadcrumbs for French's fried onions.

Excellent!!! My boyfriend said he'd gladly eat it again =)  DEFINITELY double the sauce.  I left out ketchup alltogether and just made a single serving of the sauce... but as soon as I poured it on top I realized how little it was and whipped up another batch.  Super easy... and tasted great!

This is good, but it's more like a hamburger without a bun and with sauce over it.  Not like the traditional salibury steak that I love.  My husband loves this recipe though - one of his favorites!

This was just OK. I would eat it again if it were being served but I probably won't make it again.  If I did make it again I would double the sauce.

Soooo good!  Made with ground turkey and added slicked mushrooms and put over egg noodles.  Followed other's advice adn made double the sauce though - one can of soup is not enough!!  Thank you, thank you for this dish.

Really great! Definitely not gourmet, but that's not what Salisbury Steak is all about, is it? I didn't change a thing about this except adding fresh mushrooms during the 20 minute simmer time. Thank you for this quick and easy recipe! The sauce was quite thin, but not so thin that I felt I needed to thicken it at all.

This turned out very good.  I will definately make this again.  The grocery store was out of french onion soup, so I just used dry onion soup mix - I added that directly to the meat.  I also used premade gravy and added the ketchup, mustard powder, etc. to that.

This is my new favorite recipe. As the dad/cook, I needed something not to frilly but wanted to show the family I could cook gormet.  This hit the spot! Based on others comments, I made twice as much sauce as recommended so we could put it over mashed potatoes and I added fresh musrooms as well.  Make sure you don't use too much ketchup or it will ruin the sauce and flavor.

This was very good!  Hubby ate it up.  I only used 1lb of meat (ground turkey), and I thought that there should be more of the yummy sauce...  Next time I will double it.  Left out the mushrooms since hubby hates them (sigh).  Served over garil mashed potatoes.  Perfect!

I've made this recipe for my family and they LOVED it! My husband HATES meatloaf but LOVES this, which I'm glad because I love meatloaf and never get to have it, this relieves me of my meatloaf cravings! I've made it exactly to the recipe and I've also added an extra can of onion soup for more gravy, both ways are great!

Very good, though I doubled.  The onion soup flavor was a little strong for the kids so next time I may use 1 can of beef consomme to one can onion soup.

I made this and was surprised how easy it all came together.  I definitely recommend doubling the ingredients for the sauce - it's yummy and nice to pour over noodles or mashed potatoes.

Very good flavour. Changed the recipe bcuz no french onion soup to be found. I added 2tsps oxo cubes to 4 cups of water and 1 pkg of onion soup mix, added a couple of squirts of ketchup and fresh onions to the pan while the ground beef was cooking. Also deglazed the pan with red wine. Family really loved the recipe.  4 stars because I changed the recipe. Thanks for the recipe.

This was a hit with my whole family! I followed the recipe exactly, except that I doubled the sauce so we'd have plenty of gravy for the rice I was serving with it. The 1 1/2 pounds of meat made six very large patties and next time I'll probably just use our standard 1 lb. of meat for 4 patties. Also, next time, I'm going to use about half has much ketchup as this was a little bit tomato-y for my taste. The rest of the family raved about it and I've put this recipe in my 'keep' pile.

What a great recipe.  Such a good but unusual flavor to the gravy.  I thought there might not be enough gravy (with mashed potatoes) but there was plenty.  Because of the unusually easy preparation, I will use it for casual guest dinners.  Thanks!

This was very good. I normally do not like salisbury steak, but made it because it is one of my husband's favorite dishes. I ended up liking it!

Excellent!  My kids who I have a hard time getting them to eat meat had 2 helpings and so did the husband.  I altered a little.  I doubled the gravy but I only added about 1/3 c Ketchup but I could have added less.  I also added a bouillon cube and drained one of the cans of soup and put in with the meat patties and just added a little more bread crumbs to the meat.  Definitely a keeper.  Thanks!

New family fav. I use venison burger to lower fat and we had a great hunting season! Definitly double the sauce. Can't find French Onion soup, use cream of onion or cream of mushroom and add a packet of Lipton dry onion soup mix right to the sauce. Sometimes I do half ketchup and half Open Pit BBQ sauce.  Optional: add mushrooms, chopped tomatoes, diced green peppers.  Very versitile recipe.  Our kids don't like texture of steak, but they eat this right up every time.  Great gravy on mashed potatoes.

While this recipe has a good taste, it really seems more like meatloaf than salisbury steak. I wouldn't recommend this as salisbury steak to anyone, though I will probably fix it again as a hybrid Meatloaf/Salisbury Steak recipe.

I didn't really care for this recipe but my fiance loved it and he is very picky.  It was just ok.  Be careful with the cornstarch because I didn't have enough gravy and I only used 1 lb of meat.  I would not try this recipe again.

Everyone loved this. I left out the ketchup, and added a jar of mushroom gravy to the sauce. I also didnt have an egg, so I left it out and only put extra breadcrumbs, garlic powder,onion powder, and a couple tablespoons of the soup and the patties stayed together when I fried them. I then put them in the oven for about 45 min. We are definately adding this to our dinner rotation. Thanks!!

Very Good!  My family gobbled this up, I did bake them for about 20 minutes after browning and doubled the gravy, and used a can of beef broth and added fresh mushrooms.  YUMMMM!  I served it with mashed potatoes with cream cheese and chives and carrots.  What a meal!

This is an awesome recipe!  I browned the patties then put them in the oven on 375 for approximately 20 minutes and they were perfect.  I did double up on the gravy, used a can of condensed beef broth along with the other ingredients and it was absolutely fabulous.  My daughter and mom both raved about it and are now fixing it themselves.  Way to go!!!

This was actually really quite good. The consistancy was a little odd to me at first - it seemed like the meat wasn't cooked through because of the soft mushy insides - but I guess that's how it's supposed to taste.

If I could give this 10 stars, I would.  I followed the recipe exactly and added some garlic powder.  Like everyone else, I doubled the gravy recipe for mashed potatoes.  I will try it without the ketchup next time just to see the difference.  But I think it will then taste like hamburgers in gravy.  I will definitely make this again.

I doubled the sauce, added a can of cream mushroom soup, fresh mushrooms, cut down the ketchup and omitted the salt as other reviews suggested but I really don't like it and so does my bf. The patty wasn't great either, the sauce tasted funny. I'm sorry, perhaps it was my fault but I don't think I will make again. Thanks for sharing tho :)

Yummy!  I loved it. As others have suggested, I doubled the sauce.  I also added 8 Oz. of presliced fresh mushrooms.  I've tried it over both Mashed tators and rice and it's good either way.  A very easy dinner

I LOVED this recipe.  I mistakenly bought dry onion soup mix so I used it mixed with beef stock and used stock instead of water (I always sift my dry soup to remove the dry pieces of onion).
Used stock in gravy too.  DELICIOUS !

Excellent!  I used venison in this recipe, browned the patties, put them in the crock pot with the sauce and let them cook during the afternoon.  Super easy and the family loved it!

Wow!  These were really good.  Served with mashed potatoes, green beans and warm rolls...a real hit!  Very easy to make.  The only changes I made were, after I browned them on the stove I drained the fat and baked in the oven at 350 for about 30 minutes.  Next time I will double the sauce.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe is a keeper!! Nice flavor in the meat, not too strong and the sauce was delicious.  I doubled the amount for the sauce and I baked the patties and sauce in a roasting pan.  I would definelty make this again!!!

These were good, but nothing to shout about.  I pretty much followed the recipe, except I browned mine using a George Foreman grill to drain the grease. I also used less ketchup in the sauce. My husband liked them more than me so I think next time I make them I will make the ones for me thinner because I am not huge on ground beef. It's a good recipe - worth trying.

I followed the recipe exactly and was disappointed with the results.  The sauce was too spicy.  I ended up throwing the dinner out.  Will not make again.

My wife and daughter were both fighting a cold so I knew they needed some good old "comfort food". I doubled the gravy and made some garlic sour cream mashed taters and green beans. Yummy! A definite keeper.

What else is there to say? Everyone here has covered it! Good as is, Great with Lipton Mushroom sauce instead of the  sauce here. Fantastic base recipe, lots of room for variation and different tastes. Thanks for this.

Excellent and simple to put together.  Added a little nutmeg (my daughter adds it to everything!) and mushrooms.  It was served over egg noodles.
I like the review that someone made of freezing some patties before cooking for another day.  I was making it for two.
Had some problems with the patties falling apart when turning -my shakey Parkinsons does not help.
Thanks for this super meal maker.

This recipe was great as is, though I did cut back on the salt just a bit.  I added some sliced mushrooms, and served it with a mixture of long grain and wild rice, and green beens.

The meat was tender and it was easy to fix and was good except when I make it again I will make more gravy using no catsup and less worshershire but add mushrooms.  It sure made the house smell good while it cooked and next time I will put it in the oven for the last 20 min. instead of leaving in the skillet.

My husband thought this was great.  I followed other suggestions and browned the patties in the skillet and then trasfered them to the oven at 325 for 30 minutes.  Very tasty I will add this to my menu!

The steak part of this recipe was tender and tasty.  Ketchup based gravy for salisbury steak??? Where's the mushrooms??  Used gravy recipe from Mushroom salisbury steak to it a 5 star meal.

Made this the other night and it's a keeper.  Served with mashed potatoes but think next time I'll serve with rice and spoon some of the sauce over the rice.  Yummy!  It was a little sweet for me.  I would probably cut the ketchup in half and increase the water next time if it was just me but my wife loved it as is.  Because of the sweetness I'd like to give it 4 1/2 stars.  Since I can't do that I'll go for the five star rating due to ease of recipe.

This recipe was OK but not quite what I was looking for; something about the flavor was off for me.  The combination of dry mustard, wocestershire sauce and ketchup reminded me of a cross between ranch round steak and meatloaf. I think I will keep looking for the right recipe.

I didnt care for the taste of the gravy.Not sure if it was the mustard or the worchestershire sauce. maybe both. It wasn't the taste I was looking for. I did cut the ketsup in half.I like a more beefy taste. thanks for sharing. It's not something I would make again

This was good comfort food for sure.  I followed the recipe for the most part (I did add some mushrooms) and it was a quick weeknight meal to put together.  My DH liked it too.  If I were going to make this again, I would add some sliced onions in with the mushrooms for added flavour (we didn't find a lot of 'onion' flavour with just the soup).

My entire family and I enjoyed this dish, but you will need to make extra sauce if you plan to eat it with mashed potatoes, however. Very good overall, we'll definitely have it again.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I followed other's suggestions and reduced the ketchup by half.  Other than that I prepared as directed.  My hubby and and kids loved every bite, even my 3 yr old that really doesn't like meat.  Thanks for sharing.  This is one I'll make again and again :)

I didn't have any condensed onion soup so I used Lipton onion soup mix and added 2 cups of water to it. I then followed the directions for the rest of the recipe untill it came to simmering the gravy  over the meat in the skillet. Instead I followed someone else's advice written in one of the reviews and put it in the oven at 375 F for about half an hour. I couldn't believe what I taisted. Mmmmmmmmm!  It was so good.

My husband and 10 year old really like this recipe.  I added garlic to the sauce and doubled the sauce recipe.  It went in the family recipe book.

This was a very tasty dish. The only problem I had was I added all the soup to the patties and they would not stay together.We just mixed it all and served it on mashed potatoes.Kids even had seconds! I doubled the sauce also.

The only changes I have made to this recipe is to make a bit more of the "sauce" so we can serve it over mashed potatoes. My hubby loves this recipe and have added it to our collection.

My family loves this recipe. I cook the patties on the stove top until brown, and then bake them in a 350 degree oven, covered, for about 25 minutes. As for the sauce, I omit the ketchup and add a little more water and a packet of brown gravy mix. Sometimes I also add a can of cream of mushroom soup to that. It just depends on if I want a mushroom gravy or a brown gravy. Either way is great.

Thanks for the recipe!

Half of the family liked this and the other half thought it was just ok.  I really liked the way the meat came out, but the gravy was too sweet which is strange because I omitted the ketchup to avoid sweetness.  I suspect the soup is the cause of the sweetness and will definitely try this again using beef broth and sauteed onions in place of the canned french onion soup.

Really good, however, I will tone down the ketchup and worchestire and add 2 cans of soup.  I will also add mushrooms too.  This is a keeper!

easy and VERY yummy. The only two things I changed was I used cream of mushroom instead of french onion soup. I also sauted some mushrooms and added it to the gravy. Cooked it in the oven at 350 for 20 minutes then covered with sauce and cooked another 20 minutes. YUMMY

Very good. Will definately make again. I made it exactly as is, except I scaled it down to 4 servings.  (There's only 2 of us, and my largest pan wouldn't fit all 6 patties). My fiancee placed it in the top ten things that I cook.

My daughter loved this, and she's the pickest eater I've ever met.  However for myself, husband and 11 year old son, it was waaaay too sweet.  I think next time, instead of adding ketchup, I will add brown gravy (canned).

Had to give it 5 stars, my whole family loved it!  Most definatley double up on the sauce.  Served with noodles the first time, next time mashed potatoes.  Didn't have worcestershire sauce and it was still delicious.

I made this recipe tonight and my kids loved it.  I agree with previous ratings to 1/2 the amount of the ketchup or leave it out entirely.  Also, doubling the ingredients to double the gravy amount might be necessary if you like lots of gravy.  I will be cooking this again for sure!!!

Loved it!  I agree that the sauce is more tangy than a traditional sauce, but the meat mixture was excellent!  Most salisbury steak recipes try to put too much in the meat and it loses its simplicity.  I would recommend less ketchup and adding the bouillon as other reviews suggested. I also thinkened it with cornstach after they were done cooking.  Thanks for the great recipe!

We love this recipe!  It does not taste like I expect Salisbury Steak to taste, but we love it anyway.  I have been making this dish for two years now.  For the 1/3 cup soup that goes in the meat, I spoon out most of the onions from the can.  This reduces the liquid in the meat (helping them hold together) and helps keep the sauce smooth.  I also add 1 tablespoon of Worcestershire and 2 tablespoons of ketchup to the meat mixture before browning, since I like the flavor of the sauce to carry through the meat.  This is one of the few things I make that my husband specifically requests.  Thank you!

Was okay, but not what I typically call salisbury steak.  Patties fell a part no matter what I did (including use use tips).  Will probably try another one next time.

It was very good - but I agree with the other posters when they said that the ketchup was a little too much. I love ketchup and even put it in my stew but it would taste much better without it! I also added the onion soup mix and 1 1/2 cups water to make more gravy and I used cornstarch instead of flour. I will probably make it again!

It tasted a bit more like meatloaf rather than salisbury steak but still tasted real good.  I used Egg Beaters and Lean hamburger to lower the fat and cholestoral.  The only differences next time is I will probably try to create an alternative to the French Onion Soup to lower the sodium.

This was just ok for me. I followed the others advice and made extra sauce, which helped. The meat itself was nice and moist. It's just not something I see myself making again. Even my hubby, who is a big meat eater wasn't that impressed. He said it reminded him of eating in the cafeteria in school.

This is a kick-butt recipe!  Not only is it pretty fast to throw together, it's tasty too!  I think it has a shade too much ketchup, but the rest of the family thinks it's fine as is. I guess I'm out voted on this one.

Easy to prepare but sauce was too thick and too ketchupy for hubbys taste.  We loved the taste and texture of patties.  When I make it again, will cut back on ketchup and substitute mushroom gravy or soup to make more sauce.  Definate keeper.

MMMMMM...Very good. I only gave it a four because I did a lot of modifications. I added onions, some (not the whole package, maybe 1/4th)dry onion soup mix and a pinch of garlic to the meat. To the sauce I added a can of cream of mushroom and a healthy splash of marsala wine. MMMMMMMM

My family loved this! I have a ten year old son that will eat anything as long as it includes mashed potatoes, so I served potatoes with this meal. I made extra sauce, used corn starch instead of flour, used garlic seasoned bread crumbs, and used a packet of onion soup mix…it was easy and tasted wonderful. It’s on the menu again for this week!

YUM!  My family, including two kids under 8, loves this recipe.  I usually don't like cooking with soups (too many tuna noodle casseroles as a kid!) but this is absolutely delicious, and pretty quick and easy - a must in my book.  Make extra sauce and serve with mashed potatoes.

Awesome salisbury steak! I make the gravy different: saute some sliced mushrooms in equal parts olive oil and butter until soft, add salt and pepper to taste, add flour (how much depends on how thick you like it, I use 4T)whisk in beef stock, cook until thick,add beef patties back to pan to keep warm.

I couldn't get the patties to stay together that well when browning them, but they tasted alright.  My husband loved it.  He even took the left overs to work the next day.  I'll definitely make them again one day, but I'll try to 'moosh' the patties better and use less worcestershire than what the recipe calls for.  I thought it was a bit much.

This Salisbury Steak is wonderful. I found this recipe on here last year and have been making it ever since. It's the only Salisbury Steak I make. Plus, it's nice that I don't even have to make any changes.

Pretty good!  Cut back on ketchup and doubled gravy as others suggested.  Served it over noodles - next time I will put in the extra effort and make mashed potatoes.

I didn't have any french onion soup so I used beef stock and cut up and sauteed my own onions.  I also threw in a can of musroom pieces... and thickened the sauce using some corn starch... yummy with mashed potatoes!

Very good.  Sauce is rich, full bodied with great color.  While cooking I could identify the smell of dry mustard, not my favorite.  I would leave it out next time.  Doubling the sauce is required for use over potatoes or rice.  While cooking I periodically turned the patties and spooned the sauce over which adhered nicely giving them extra flavor.

I'm not too sure about this recipe. The sauce uses a lot of Worchestershire, which is kind of overpowering. The ketchup tempers it a bit, but I'll try cutting it down next time. These steaks were very dense and heavy.

I made this yesterday and it was good.  Even my picky 3 and 6 year old girls ate it.  You definitely need to double the sauce if you want it over your potatoes.  I tried cutting back on ketcup, mustard and worcestershire sauce as some people suggested and found it didn't have enough flavor so I ended up added it back.  Then it tasted much better.  I don't think this recipe needs any changes, good as is.

I think this recipe is GREAT!!  Yummy.  The whole family loved it.  I would change the amount of ketchup.  The gravy was a little to sweet for us.  And we had to double the gravy amount to put on top of our mashed potatoes.

This recipe was so fantastic!  My husband just loved it!!!  The only thing I added was a cup of water with a dissolved beef boullion cube and an extra Tablespoon of flour.  I also added a little bit of sauteed fresh mushrooms to the gravy.  It was absolutely delicious!  Thanks!

Yum!  I used a little less than 1/3c of ketchup but followed the recipe otherwise.  I don't know if I would double the sauce, but I would like to have half again as much next time, I think.  I served with rolls and noodles.  The hamburger wanted to fall apart a bit but they were so good it didn't matter.  The meat was very tender and moist.  I am so happy with this recipe...  Thank you!!

This is excellent! Tip: Do make extra sauce to serve over potatoes or rice.

The boys gave it a five, the girls gave it a 2....but we're not big ground beef lovers.  I did add a little red wine to give it a little extra and the boys asked to please make once a week.

VERY GOOD!  EVEN FOR MY PICKY HUSBAND WHO LIKED IT!!
I would be very careful with the Worchestershire and ketchup, they could overwhelm the taste!

This is a nice and easy dish for a comfy weeknight meal. I would recommend adding a small amount of beef broth to the mixture. It gives it a beefier flavor.  We like it because it's a good alternative to meatloaf.

Great recipe, tasted just as I'd hope for it, only thing was, the sauce wasn't enough, as I was preparing it, I noticed how little the sauce was, so I doubled everything, and still it wasn't as much, so next time I make this recipe I will tripple the sauce, add sliced bread to keep the patties together, and minus down on the 1/2 teaspoon of worcestershire sauce, it was a bit too tangy for me.

I think I made mine a little thick (more like hamburger patties) and will thicken the sauce a little next time -- but overall these were very tasty.

This was really easy, and very tasty.  I used garlic salt instead of salt,... and if you like salsbury gravy,  you should know before you cook the sauce it is only enough to cover the patties...

i loved this recipe great for a 30 minute meal after work. My kids thought the sauce was "spicy", could of been because i did not have any dried mustard on hand. I doubled gravy recipe and served over big noodles.

My husband definetly enjoyed this recipe.  It is a great use of ground beef.  I was thinking of trying it with turkey next time.  The sauce is so flavorful it would defenitly help the bland turkey.

This recipe was good but it was more of a meatloaf variation than a salisbury steak in my opinion. A bit too much ketchup and mustard. We all ate it up but I don't think I will make it again.

This recipe is amazing. A little too tangy for me, but I still gobbled it up. I used regular mustard instead of the pwdr, and doubled everything except for the ketchup and mustard; next time I'll use even less. I also used a beef broth with a pckt of onion soup instead of the kind the recipe calls for. And I only browned the patties for a few mins. on each side, and then broiled them in the oven for 15 mins. I also added tons of mushrooms. YUM!!

i had never made salisbury steak before this recipie and it was delicious.  i didnt have worcestershire sauce so i used whatever steak sauce i could find.  also didnt have mustard powder so i just used regular yellow mustard.  turned out great.

Sorry, butI didn't think this recipe was very good.  The meat fell apart while cooking and, imagining how savory this dish was going to be after adding the onion soup, worcestershire sauce, etc., I was disappointed to find it rather flavorless.  I will not be making this again.

I love this recipe!  The only change I make is that I leave out the ketchup.  When I want tomato taste, I make meatloaf.  Other than that, this recipe is easy and soooo good.

This recipe was pretty good although the steaks themselves seemed to fall apart after cooking.   I think maybe if they were made flatter and smaller they would have held together better.  Thanks for the recipe, though!

This was pretty good, but the sauce had a funny flavor. Maybe too much worchestire sauce. Also, I think it needed more salt. I think I prefer using the Lipton onion soup mix better. thanks for the recipe!

This is an excellent recipe.  I made a few changes based on the recommendations of others.  To the meat mixture I added 1/4 C of the canned French onion soup and 1/2 pkg dry onion soup mix and 1 tsp of Worcestershire and omitted salt. (everthing else the same)  For the gravy I used rest of canned onion soup, about 1 Tbsp ketchup, a beef boullion cube and a small can of mushrooms. (everything else the same.) This is the best salisbury steak I have ever had.  Great with mashed potatoes!

These are good, the sauce is great so I always make sure to double the recipe for the sauce to have exta gravy for the mashed potatoes.

My husband really liked it, but I thought it was more of a glorified meatloaf.  We ate it on hamburger buns, which was fun for the kids.

Served this with an instant four cheese rice and it worked nicely. I even forgot the bread crumbs and it still tasted great (just didn't stay in patty form)!

After reading reviews, I took suggestions, i.e., adding mushrooms and mushroom soup.  I didn't have ketchup on hand, so I used less than 1/3 Contadina tomato paste . . . served with mashed potatoes and corn.  WHAT A HIT!!  My husband and son loved it . . . be aware, my husband is an extremely picky eater.  Allrecipes is the greatest invention since ice-cream!!

I followed what some other reviewers had said. I added Cream of Mushroom soup and left out the kethcup. My kids attacked this meal and cleaned their plates. I gave it four stars because I didn't like the idea of adding bread crumbs and egg to the meat patties, or ketchup to the sauce. Outside of that this was wonderful.

Easy recipe to make.  I wanted something different for dinner, and normally I don't like Salisbury steak. My husband loved it, but my daughter (she's 2), didn't.  But I did have fun with it.  I shaped a couple of pattys into "bats" and made glazed pumpkin carrots, and mashers.

Made as is, easy and delicious. You will never look in the frozen aisle for salisbury steak again -- yuck! Serve this dish along with a side of mashed potatoes, salad or a veggie. I used to make this recipe a lot and really miss it! If only I could find a gluten free version of condensed french onion soup... :(

This has become one to my hubbie's favorites!I double the sauce, for gravy with potatoes. Even my kids love this one! I find the leanest ground beef works best. Sometimes I add mushrooms to the gravy.

Very good!  I used Italian-seasoned bread crumbs (since that's what I had on hand) and it added a nice touch.  I also doubled the sauce and added mushrooms like other reviewers suggested - the sauce was great on mashed potatoes.

My family loves this recipe!  My husband doesn't like mushrooms so I searched for quite sometime for a recipe that didn't include them.  Like others suggested, I doubled the sauce and was glad I did.  Makes a great meal with little buttered eggs noodles and a veggie.  Can't wait to make it again.

So good. I put diced sauteed white onions into the ground beef mixture as well as add sauteed fresh white mushrooms (and remaining onions) into the sauce with patties. Everytime I make it they just want more.

Great tasting sauce but I found it difficult to make the steaks stick together.

This is very tasty. My husband and 7 year old son really liked it. I only used a pound of meat...just used less soup in the meat mix so I would have more for sauce.  Also put in a splash of red wine to the sauce mixture and next time I will use less ketchup as it was a bit too tangy for us. This one made the cut for the recipe box.

This is great comfort food!  The gravy really makes the meal.  As suggested by others, I made extra for mashed potatoes.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  It was a hit!

I made this last night and everyone loved it!  Even my picky kids ages 7, 11, and 15.  Very easy to make although I had to double the recipe and therefore, cook a little longer.  Will definitely make again and again!  Thanks!

This was really good. I doubled the sauce to serve over mashed potatoes and made the meat into meatballs instead of patties. All three kids and my husband ate it. It wasn't the most gourmet meal ever, but I didn't expect it to be. I will make this again.

Fantastic! Was done in no time and gone in no time! Four of us polished off all six steaks. Then my hubby scraped out the pan with a piece of bread to get every last bit of gravy.  Next time I'll double the recipe and make extra gravy so we'll have leftovers for sandwiches for the next day's lunch.  Thanks, Kelly!!

Comfort food at its best.  I wasn't sure what to expect when I started making this and it turned out great.  Picture your best "mom food" or maybe your favorite diner food and this is it.  My sauce was a little thick so I added some salted water and it was great.  Thank you, Kelly!

Quite Delicious!  The only thing I'll do different next time is to make the steaks smaller because my husband and I need portion control.  I used prepared mustard instead of mustard powder, (because that is all I had) and it was great!

Thanks for submitting this recipe.

This recipe was okay if you like a tomato type, strong sauce. I prefer my salisbury steak w/a more brown gravy sauce. One daughter refused to eat the dish. The other one said it was okay. My husband was out of town so he missed it. I probably won't make this recipe unagain unless I changed somethings around.

Very tasty! I didn't have the onion soup in a can, so I added Lipton Onion Soup mix, 1 1/2 cups water, and a little beef boulion. It smeeld great and tasted even better. Thanks!

This was pretty good. I used an extra can of Campbell's cream of onion soup when making the sauce in addition to the french onion but it was a little too oniony that way. Will use either another can of french onion or just beef broth next time. Overall the patties were moist and the sauce had alot of flavor. The sauce on mashed potatoes is very good. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was good although a little time consuming.  My fiance really enjoyed it.  I though the sauce was a little sweet.  Next time I make it, I think I will try leaving out the ketchup.

I made this recipe the other night for my husband and my niece.  The both said it was very good (she may have been being polite)  I liked it though, and my husband really, really liked it !!  He had some for leftovers and told me again how much he loved it !!  I, like others added mushrooms, I didn't have fresh and that would have been even better.  I also didn't have the onion soup so I used beef broth...I can only imagine it would have been even better with that.  I will certainly make this one again.  Thanks for the recipe!

My husband loves this recipe!! We like to serve it with mashed potatoes (make extra sauce of course), or over egg noodles, with a green salad. One other thing, it's great when made with ground turkey instead of beef. Not as much fat and grease. Yum!

adding mushrooms bulks it up a little.  
i used tomato sauce instead of ketchup.  i refuse to cook with ketchup.  my grandfather cooks with ketchup.  
using only 1 lb. of hamburger (yields 4 patties)for smaller families works as well with plenty of sauce to spare.
*a creative way to use hamburger.*

This was a nice, quick dinner.  The kids were reluctant to try it as they could only think of Salisbury steak in t.v. dinners (not that good).  We were all pleasantly surprised.  I agree with the "not enough sauce."  Double the sauce part of the recipe.  Served it with mash pots and a fresh fruit salad.

Easy to make and tastes just like I remember Salisbury steak tasting. One caveat: French onion soup smells AWFUL! (I used regular ole' Campbell's.) The taste is fine, but - my goodness - the smell! For that reason alone, I'd hesitate to make this again unless someone requested it.

This was very good, but next time I'll just used canned gravy for the potatoes.  I liked the savory sauce on the potatoes, but my husband would prefer regular gravy.  Either way, the taste of the meat with the sauce is excellent!  -Allison

My family just loved this recipe.  I did too.  The only change I made was to make the gravy and put it in the crock pot and simmer with meat for about 2 hours. Absolutely delicious.  Definetley a new favorite.  Thanks Kelly!!

I was looking for something different to make with hamburger and thought my family might like this, although I didn't think I would. I was wrong! I did like it and so did the whole family! I found the sauce to be rather greasy, so I think next time I would use ground chuck. We were all pleasantly surprised!

This stuff is great. Very flavorful because of the onion soup added right into the meat. The burgers fried up with a nice crust that mellowed out in the sauce. Hubby loved it.

This is one is a regular now at my house. I use beef broth instead of onion soup because my picky daughter doesn't do onions. I have tried for years to find a true salisbury steak recipe with "that gravy", this is the one!

Good comfort food.  I did not have all of the ingredients for this recipe, but I add libed.  I used Lipton Onion Soup mix with 1 1/2 cups of water and added 1 beef bouillon cube and substituted Italian bread crumbs for regular bread crumbs.  I also made meatballs (more time consuming), which were more pleasing to my children.  I served with egg noodles and fresh baked bread.  GREAT DINNER.

I added a little more flour and mushrooms. We were suprised how good this recipe was.  My 7 year old loved it.

My family does not like to eat much beef so I was concerned that the patties might be dry and tough, but these where very moist and tender.  We added some mushrooms and it was wonderful.  This is a keeper.

OH MY GOODNESS! Wonderful! My husband is not a huge fan.. but he's goofy anyways.  I brought this into work one night, and fed the Emergency room staff.. no one told me they weren't fans of salisbury steak.. who'da thought? but after they thought they'd be "kind" and try it.. they gobbled it up and requested it again! They said it turned them around with thoughts of salisbury steaks dancing through their heads! The gravy it made was the real winner! I did once substitute half ground turkey and half ground beef.. cut down the fat AND calories.. yummy! Thanks so much.  A new staple in our house.. at least for the kids and me.. maybe not hubby, he can eat hot dogs!LOL

Hmm.  I will have to make this again, just to see why it is getting such great reviews.  It was good and my son liked it, but for myself and my husband...we gave it a 3.5 out of 5.  Maybe I wasn't "hungry" enough to totally enjoy it.  It's a keeper and I will make it again.  I'll rate it again then.

I tried this recipe this week and my family loved it.  I made it with ground chuck rather than the ground beef.  Also, for the venison eaters, I had a package of cubed deer steaks that I floured, browned and then added to the skillet of salisbury steak.  I let everything simmer for about 1-1/2 hours and it was delicious.  Even my husband who usually will not eat venison commented on how good both were.  Incidently, I doubled the gravy so we would have plenty to serve over rice.  I will definitely be using this recipe again.  I also shared the recipe with the girls in my office.  Thanks for sharing this with us.

My entire family loves this,including my "picky Eater".  I use water instead of katsup to make a great brown gravy to serve over rice.  It's always a BIG hit.

I made the patties the night before as someone else suggested and stuck to the recipe exactly for everything - this was great and will definetly be made often in my home - the sauce/gravy had a great flavor.  Thanks for submitting a recipe that makes ground beef taste great ;-)  rray

This is my husband's favorite meal...we eat it once every week or two.  I've made it with both the ground beef and ground turkey, and we both prefer it with the ground turkey.  One of the easiest meals to cook and delicious.

This was a big hit with my family.  I didn't make any changes in the recipe and loved the little bit of tang to the sauce.  I used very lean beef and the patties did not come out dry.  Thanks Kelly for sharing a great recipe.

I've made this about four times in the last month.  It is really tasty.  The onion soup addd so much to the patty mixture.  The first time I made it I made the patties the day before and it was the best!  I've made it for the grandchildren and they liked it a lot.  My husband asks for it often.  I also make extra gravy because this is a natural accompaniment to mashed potatos.  The gravy thickens up quite a bit the longer you keep it on the burner.  EXCELLENT.  This was my first experience with allrecipes.com and I am thrilled.

Awesome recipe! I didn't have any canned onion soup so I made some from a recipe here on the site, Rich and Simple French Onion Soup. I used it to make this recipe. Wonderful! No leftovers, everyone cleaned their plate. The sauce is habit forming. I will be making this a lot. Thanks for sharing it. Feb. 2010 made this for the umpteenth time, just incredible.  Made my own soup again too. Everyone cleaned their plates, even the Greys! 
Yes, African Grey Parrots eat people food. 
Doubled the sauce as always, but do not double the ketchup. Some tomato is needed in beef dishes, brings out the flavors and makes them richer but don't overdo it. Used some thyme and sage, just 1/4 tsp. each, went really lite on the salt, it can get very salty very fast so watch it. If you must use bouillon cubes don't add any other salt at all. One clove of garlic in with the onion soup. Really no other major adjustments. Mashed taters, green beans and homemade rolls, just doesn't get any better.

I made this the other night for dinner. We loved it. I did make extra sauce and added fresh mushrooms. I didn't think the ketchup was too much although I did feel that the worcestershire was a bit heavy. Next time I will use less. Overall-an excellent recipe. Thank you.

Before starting the recipe I read EVERY review and jotted down notes...I try to stay away from red meat so I used ground turkey.  I also used an extra can of french onion soup (adding more flour to thicken as well), cut back on the ketchup and added mushrooms.  We served over rice instead of mashed potatoes - YUM!!!!!  Excellent recipe!!

My whole family loved this recipe! I didn't have the canned french onion soup, so I used the Lipton onion soup mix and made it with only 2 cups of water instead of 4. It turned out great! I've been looking for a Salisbury Steak recipe and now I've found a great one. Thanks Kelly for submitting it.

This was very easy to make, and the sauce was great.  however it didn't make enough sauce for us, so i will probably double it in the future.  My picky toddler loved it too.

Tender & Delicious!  I, too, made alterations to the gravy recipe for a more traditional taste. I omitted the worchestershire sauce and added the drippings from the ground beef instead. Plus additional water & seasonings to taste. This is a recipe that will stand the test of time.

My boyfriend loved this recipe!! We prefer a gravy with less of a tomato taste so I added 1/2 can of cream of mushroom soup and 1/2 cup of milk.  I also added fresh mushrooms and onion.  In addition I substitued the bread crumbs (as I do in all my recipes) with pre-mix beef flavored stuffing mix. It adds just a little extra flavor.  This recipe is a keeper.

Even my picky kids loved this. It was so so easy, and tastes great. It tastes like you've been slaving in the kitchen all day... but it's so easy. It's a keeper! I didn't have the can of onion soup, so I made Lipton onion soup (the powder) and cut the water in half to make it "condensed" and it worked just great. I'll make this again and again.

Before cooking this, I read all of the reviews.  For those of you who said it tasted too ketchupy or not as beef-flavored as they remembered salisbury steak to be, do what I did and substitute the french onion soup with beef consume.  I also added mushrooms to it and followed the directions to a T.  It was perfect!  Everyone loved it.  This recipe is a keeper.

Very good recipe for salisbury steak and my kids absolutely loved it!  (Ages 6 & twins 3)  It was relatively easy to make and cooked up fairly quickly once the ingredients were assembled.  I plan to cook more and freeze as part of my once a month cooking.  Thank you!

My husband is an extremely picky eater and he loved it.  As a matter of fact he asked me to make it again soon which he has only done twice before, ever!!!  The steaks stayed together well and the sauce was delicious.

My family absolutly LOVES this recipe!!!  Even my 3-year-old ate every bite!  (Which is pretty amazing considering she only eats chicken nuggets and P,B&J's at the moment!:-)  The gravy was what made this taste sooooo good!  This is THE BEST salisbury steak I have ever had!

My husband and I thought this recipe was pretty good; however, my stepson really loved it. I doubled the sauce and serve it on mashed potatoes. We tried it with sautéd mushrooms and 1 can of Cream of Mushroom soup one day, and the next day without any mushrooms or mushroom soup.  It's much better without the mushroom soup or mushrooms. I probably will make this again, but it won't be any time soon.

I am IMPRESSED with this recipe...not only was it outstanding, it was very easy to make.  I read prior reviews and used mushrooms, and extra onion soup for the gravy.  I also seasoned my ground beef well, and served w/mashed potatoes & sweet peas...it was FANTASTIC--no leftovers!!!

This was excellent--easy and delicious.  I added sauteed mushrooms to the sauce, and it was a great addition.  It is one of our favorites!
