Don't laugh! But I hadn't made this recipe since i was a newlywed in 1976. It was the rage in the 70's. I decided to make it the other night. I made a double recipe. I made a few changes though. Along with the peas, noodles, milk, and tuna fish, I used one can of celery soup and one can of mushroom soup (I can only handle so much of mushroom soup),  I also added 2 cups of cheese to the recipe and mixed it in. I chopped one large onion up and added it to the recipe and used Lawry's garlic salt and pepper to season it. I loaded the top with bread crumbs. It was fabulous. Now that I'm unemployed I will make this more often. Very economical meal! Great classic base recipe.

With a few changes, this is a great base recipe. I make it all the time. Just add a little sour cream and a little more milk. Some granulated garlic, salt, pepper and cheese right in the mix. I serve it with peas and kinda mix them in on my plate. (my son hates peas or I would put them right in when cooking)

Takes me back to the 1950s.  The Campbell's recipe at time called for Cream of Mushroom soup & to top with crushed potato chips and then sprinkle with ground thyme.  The chips and thyme added crunch & taste.  I'm making this for dinner tonight!  Thanks.

Great base recipe from the past! Just swap out ingredients to your hearts desire. Chicken or ham for the tuna, the cream of whatever soup to change your flavor, 1 tomato & 1 cream of, gives a nice sauce if you use ground beef or turkey. This is the original 'Helper" before you could buy it in a box.

Great base recipe. Great as it is but you can spice it up by adding  flavors to your family's taste. DO NOT GIVE A RECIPE A LOW RATING BC YOU DIDN'T FOLLOW THE RECIPE AND IT TURNED OUT BAD. Several morons used the wrong noodles or over cooked and then blamed the recipe. That's operator error! So sick of that all over this site.

This is a wonderful recipe to build upon!  I added salt, pepper, red pepper flakes, garlic powder, oregano and thyme, as there were no seasonings given...turned out great.  I also substituted fat free sour cream for the milk, which worked great.  Definitely a must in the dinner line-up!

This was certainly not the best Tuna Noodle Casserole I've had. It wasn't creamy enough for my taste. I would suggest swaping the cream of celery for cream of mushroom and perhaps adding a can & 1/2. Also top with All Spice for a tasty finish.

I grew up eating tuna & noodle casserole and my children have grown up eating it also.  It's still a family favorite. I've always used 1 can Cream of Mushroom soup and 1/2 can milk and 3-4 slices of cheese (I use Kraft singles). It's never turned out dry. Always creamy and delicious

I added a 3rd can of tuna as it seems the cans have gotten smaller. 
This is a good base recipe that does need some salt. Next time I prepare it I plan to add more seasonings to it.

Yummy! It was delicious just as written.   Why do you people change the recipe completely and then rate it badly? Don't rate the recipe if you change it!

I made this tonight using Ronzoni's Healthy Harvest Whole Grain Noodles. It didn't come out the way I would have hoped. Maybe it was the whole grain noodles. The casserole was dry and not creamy. Perhaps it needed more milk or more canned soup. I wouldn't make this again.

This is a very flexible recipe. I was looking for a quick casserole without any chopping. I wanted to use some dry leftover pasta and pimientos. My only addition was some shredded cheese that I added to the top, cooking the last five minutes with the bread crumb topping. It's nice to find a quick easy recipe that tastes so good.

This is good tuna noodle casserole recipe, as long as you tweak it (otherwise I think it would be a very bland standard tuna noodle casserole). I mixed the soup with almost a cup of milk, 1 cup cheddar cheese, some chopped onion, salt and pepper and red pepper flakes before pouring over the noodles and peas.  It was nice and creamy and had a little bit of a kick.

Wow! I loved this casserole! It is just like I remembered when my mom used to make it during lent. I made it exactly like written, but I added slices of Velveeta cheese to the casserole. This melted as it was cooked and I just stirred it before adding the bread crumbs. Yum! My whole family loved it!

This is a great basic recipe that makes good leftovers. I used three cans of tuna and added some sour cream. I didn't measure; just whatever was left over from another recipe. The SC makes it so creamy and delish!

This was not like the casserole that I remember my grandma making as a child. Just lacked a little flavor and was dry but that could be an error on my part. Will look for a different recipe next time.

I came looking for just this recipe!  It's one of the golden oldies from my childhood and it's just as yummy as ever and certainly falls under the "comfort food" heading.  I took a little dish of it over to my mom (who is 91) and I think it brought back a few memories for her, too.  You can't really go wrong with Campbell's soup and noodles!

This is a great, quick meal and doesn't get any easier. Very mild if you don't add a lot of spices, but if you doctor it up with some cheddar cheese and garlic&herb Mrs. Dash you've got a tasty little comfort food from our childhoods.

Not too bad as written, but I would add some grated swiss cheese or maybe some colby/jack just to jazz it up a bit.
Also, if you put 1 Tablespoon butter in your microwave to melt it and put it on for 30 seconds as the recipe states, you are going to have burnt butter. Instead melt slowly in five second intervals until almost melted, then let it sit for a minute to finish melting - and be sure to cover the butter, it will pop and splatter a bit.

We had this for dinner last night, but as always I had to improvise. In Uruguay, I could not find any Campbell's soup, so I used a mild pasta sauce, celery is almost non existant so I used frozen  broccoli, diced onions, half a green pepper and some garlic, the pasta was whole wheat bow ties, lots of cheese in the fridge so I added some mozzarella to give it a more creamy look, also added some freshly ground peppèr, for the topping I crushed a few salt free crackers, added done grated cheese, a drizzle of olive oil and put in a 350 degree heated over. The compliments made me feel almost as proud as the dish tasted.  As it was. Cool night we had the wood fire going so this is added to my list of comfort foods

Grew up eating tuna fish and noodles, but we did not add peas or pimentos. Also, instead of bread crumbs, we buttered two slices of bread and tore them into pieces and covered the casserole top with them, buttered side up. They toast wonderfully in the oven and give it a nice crunch. My kids grew up with it too and now my grandsons are also. Yum!

Try a can of cream of mushroom soup instead of celery soup, add one half to 3/4 c. cup cubed velveeta cheese.  The cheese makes a difference! I don't measure my noodles, but I usually end up with close to four cups of noodles.

We all liked it very much. I have made it with cream of chicken soup and cream of mushroom soup also and it still comes out great, actually I think it comes out better than with the cream of celery.

I blended this and another recipe. I used Cream of Mushroom soup, added chopped onion and shredded cheese (blend of cheddar, Monterery Jack, and parmesan), and then used paprika & crushed potato chips on top instead of the butter/breadcrumbs. I also used elbow macaroni since I didn't have any egg noodles at home. It look a bit longer to cook but came out delicious. Not dry and not overly soupy. Very good!

We loved it with a few additions. Sauted peas, onions, celery, and mushrooms in a little olive oil and added garlic powder, salt, pepper and italian seasoning before mixing in with the rest of the ingredients, and used cream of mushroom soup instead. Added a little extra flavor that was needed. A sure keeper!

Oh my, I'm not sure what happened for me, but this is now sitting in the trash can. I haven't had Tuna Noodle Casserole since when I was growing up, and when everything was a casserole of some sort. Today I had a nostaligic moment come over me when I thought, "Hmm, it might be nice to make that." I found this recipe and thought it looked like what I recall. I followed it to the letter. But...oh, the result was so not my childhood memories. It was creamy and looked right; however, there was an oddness to it that no one in my family could quite place. I rechecked and all my ingreients were in date, so I know we're okay there. Perhaps I'm not a Tuna Casserole gal after all? Sadly, my dreams of a nostalgic dinner went into the rubbish with this casserole, and we had a Ramen Noodle night instead. Oh well. You win some, you lose some, right?

I'm going to have to try this recipe again.  I made some changes and it really turned out badly.  I used wheat egg noodles and tried cooking them a long time because they usually have a firmer taste, but I overcooked them and made the whole dish taste like a soggy mush.  We ended up throwing out the leftovers.  Judging from the other reviews though I will have to try again as written...

I grew up on the classic tuna noodle casserole. My husband; not a big fan however, I added afew of his favorite veggies. I added fresh broccoli, mushrooms and celery instead the peas and pimentos. I used cream of mushroom soup and a tablesppon of heavy whipping cream! A dash of salt and a few turns of fresh ground pepperand crumb topping It was a hit.

I made this per the recipe (minus the pimentos-i was out) as it was my first time making Tuna Noodle Casserole.  The only change i would make would be to add some more soup or milk, seemed just a smidge dry to me. I'd also like to try mixing in mushrooms too.  Overall good recipe all enjoyed.

This is an excellent tuna casserole. I too, like Chachapa, used the tuna casserole recipe that called for the potato chips and thyme. Chachapa I would love to have that recipe again. I made it in my sophmore year home ec class and got an A+. Thanks for bringing back that wonderful memory in high school.

Just like mom used to make! My mom used to make this all the time when I was a kid growing up. The only difference is, that she used mushroom soup instead of celery and topped it with regular potato chips sprinkled with a bit of paprika instead of bread crumbs.
Thanks for bringing back a piece of my childhood!

Recipes like this are always a good jumping off point, just added a bunch of stuff I had on hand.  5 stars with these changes.....cream of mushroom instead then added Worcestershire, dijon mustard, mayo, seasoning salt, dried parsley and chives, garlic salt, low fat plain yogurt, celery and jarred roasted red peppers (sauteed first.) Still used some milk but no bread crumbs, peas or pimentos.  Cooked the same way  I know it's a lot to add/change, but the result was FANTASTIC!

I've always made my sauce from scratch, but this seems simpler. However, I do add roasted sweet red peppers, onions, maybe celery if I have it (all cooked in skillet first) and cubed Colby Jack cheese. (Or shredded, but cubes are fast.) I've been making this with plain soy milk and it has always been delicious. Never a complaint from my milk-loving husband.

This recipe was extremely bland and with the amount of noodles given, would not have fed a family of four without being mostly soup/sauce.   I doubled the noodles, which created enough servings for my husband, me, and our three young children, with enough leftovers for one serving. It did also make it so that it wasn't very saucy, which both the hubby and I liked, but I would still use slightly more liquid. I also used cream of mushroom soup because it was what we had in the house, but would like to try it with celery.  If I were to make this recipe again, I would add 1/2 small onion, garlic powder, black pepper, and a pinch of salt to start, along with double the noodles and either another 1/2 cup of milk or 1/2 cup of sour cream, as some other reviews have mentioned, and see how it tastes with some seasoning in it.

This is my husband's favorite casserole. I didn't grow up eating casseroles so I had to learn how to make this from his mom. So we use cream of mushroom soup, and add chunks of Velvetta cheese, and onion flakes instead of pimentos, I stir it halfway through to get the cheese melted throughout and then crushed potato chips on top (lays original no ruffles) the last 10 minute of cooking.

As is, this recipe is just ok.  I had cut it out of the paper a couple of weeks ago because I thought it looked and sounded great.  It turned out very bland as far as I was concerned, and I actually threw out the recipe because I'm sure I could find one with much more flavor!

I have loved this recipe since I was a teenager first learning to cook.  I like it better with Cream of Mushroom soup, and it's good with a cup of shredded cheddar cheese mixed into it as well.  If you think it needs more flavor in it, try topping it with french fried onions instead of bread crumbs.  Delicious!

I tweaked it a bit. I added 1/2 cup of sour cream. Salt, pepper and seasoning salt. I used Italian bread crumbs and added cheddar cheese to the bread crumb topping. Cooked it five minutes longer to make a crispy topping. Everyone loved it and had seconds. No left overs.

I make this with whatever I have on hand. Today it was frozen cooked salmon, chopped carrots (a minute or two in the microwave), and some leftover cherry tomatoes, chopped. I also add garlic salt, a bit of Greek seasoning  (herb de Provence would do as well). Yum   Great for a snowy day without having to go to the store.

Great recipe, thanks for sharing!  I did add a few things spice wise (garlic powder, black pepper, thyme, oregano and red pepper flakes) and a small can of mushrooms.  Will definitely make over and over again!

Great easy, basic dish. My husband thought it was better than his Grandma’s recipe.  I ended up using broken up pieces of spaghetti and cream of chicken because that’s all I had on hand. I also added a quarter cup extra of milk and two scoops of sour cream as well as salt, pepper, garlic and shredded cheese after reading some reviews. I’ll definitely be making this again!

This is a great start to a tuna noodle casserole.  I sautee fresh mushrooms, diced celery, and onion in a little butter until softened and then stir in the cream of mushroom soup, milk and a tablespoon or so of sherry to give it some richness.  Combine with the egg noodles and bake with your favorite topping (sometimes I use the French's fried onions for a change) and it's really good, too.   The thing here is, there really is no right or wrong.  I've read some suggestions here that I will try so thought I'd add my thoughts here, too.  My guy hates tuna (or so he says because he  loves this recipe!).

I made this for 16 servings to have a second meal for our large family. Glad I did! I made the following modifications: I added a large, chopped onion, 12 oz. of shredded Mexican cheese, 3 boxes of organic mushroom soup instead of the cream of celery, half & half instead of milk, green beans instead of peas,  no pimento, 5- 7oz. cans of tuna instead of 8- 6oz. cans, 2- 17oz. bags of German traditional broad egg noodles, & organic croutons instead of bread crumbs (no butter needed) tossed on top. So delicious!

Very good recipe! I followed in terms of ingredients; however, I didn’t cook the noodles beforehand. I mixed everything with raw noodles and they cooked in the oven. Since they were raw, I did add a half cup of water (to a doubled recipe). Perfect and my husband raved about it! So simple and quick to make...especially with not having to cook the noodles first!

Made a few changes, Mixed caramelized chopped onion w/cooked noodles, used cream of mushroom soup and rinsed and diced roasted red peppers instead of pimentos and added a 1/2 can of half and half. My family and friends I shared it with keep asking when I'll make it again! Oh! I also added a can of mushrooms (drained). Family and friends want to know when I'll make it again. NO idea, I cook on a whim!!

I added other seasonings before baking, and I added cheese for the last 5 minutes. Quite tasty. I also doubled the recipe so I could fill out the 9x13 pan for leftovers.

I made the recipe minus the pimento.  I added a few tbsp of sour cream and fresh mozzerella cheese along with the soup and increased the milk to about 3/4 of a cup.  I topped it with crispy fried onion bits instead of bread crumbs.  It was delicious!

I followed some of the other reviewers and substituted sour cream for the milk. Gave it a bit too much tang for us. So maybe half sour cream and half milk next time. It was pretty moist, and not dry at all. Will try again.

It is a good base recipe, as a previous reviewer stated.  I jazzed it up a wee bit.  Added mushrooms, no pimentos.  Some thyme, garlic and lots of salt and pepper. Used cream of mushroom soup.  I also added some cheese. I found it tasty.  I had been thinking of trying this oldie but goodie from my childhood and it was pretty good.  Love the quantity it makes.  It was moister than I expected...I may do half the can of soup next time.

Have to give 5 stars to such a reliable staple recipe.  Basic recipes like this can save the day!  This one is easy to have the ingredients on hand, and everyone in the family is happy when I make it.  Make it as written, or make changes to suit your taste.  I like to add a jar of artichoke hearts chopped up for an interesting taste, and I always sprinkle in some grated parmesan +/or romano before baking.  One time I crushed up some seasoned crutons  for the topping instead of bread crumbs.  Go with what you have, and have a good dinner!

I make dinner for two households, and neither likes spicy food.  I, myself, love spicy food.  This was a good recipe for the picky eaters in household G, plain and easy to dress up individually for differing tastes.  I used cream of chicken soup, half & half, Italian breadcrumbs, and added pepper.  It was a triumph in the eyes of G, but I will tinker with it more.  Add garlic and onion powder, cayenne pepper, paprika, and some mushrooms.

What a versatile recipe! I didn’t have peas so I sautéed some spinach; asparagus; and mushrooms with garlic. I added the sour cream and crushed red peppers as other reviewers suggested and I added (~ 1 tsp) dijonnaise which gave it some ‘zing!’ I used 3 cans of tuna. Turned out really good! Plus it was fun to make!

I loved this dish with cream of celery soup!  I added 1/4 c. chopped celery cooked worth the noodles, 1/2 c. Shredded cheddar cheese and 3 TBSP Panko bread crumbs browned in 3 TBSP butter for the topping.  I also added 2 TBLSP more milk for guaranteed creaminess!  ??
