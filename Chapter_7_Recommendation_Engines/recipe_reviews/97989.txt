This is a great, easy recipe - very creative!  Here are my suggestions: Use only one cup of orzo.  For a nice texture, brown orzo to golden color in a tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat, then pour in water and boil it. Brown tofu first in oil, then add onions and garlic.  I also added shredded carrot and a chopped squash that had been languishing in the fridge.  Mushrooms would be good, too.  Fresh basil kicks this into high gear (love it with the lemon!), and don't skip the lemon or feta - these two things make this recipe great!  If you don't like/have feta, fresh Romano is good, too. Thanks for a wonderful, beautiful, healthy dinner.

Looks like it would have been a 4, but with the changes I made, it was outstanding.  Keep in mind I cut the recipe in half (other than the tofu) I added 2 cubes of veggie boullion to the water in which I boiled the orzo to add some flavor.  I cooked the tofu, onion and garlic as directed, but also added zucchini and a jar of marinated artichoke hearts (chopped). Instead of tomatoes I used a can of diced tomatoes w/ garlic.  After I stirred it all together, I mixed in about 1/3 cup of parmesan and then sprinkled the servings with feta and parm.  It really was just fantastic, especially for a nice, healthy meal.  Thanks for the great idea!

As the recipe is written, very bland, probably good for young kids to introduce them to tofu...turn this into a 4 star recipe by adding, sundried tomatoes (chopped, stored in oil), black olives and some red pepper flakes.

Simple and light and tasty.  The only change I made was to use fresh basil instead of dried.  Oh, and I fried the tofu before the onions to make sure I could get it nice and crispy without overcooking the veggies.  This is a great quick meal to make after work.  If you're not already a regular tofu eater, make sure you press the tofu before frying.  Even better, if you have the time, press the tofu, cut into triangles, and then FREEZE it until the edges are frozen.  Then take it out and immediately pop it into the hot pan with oil.  Provides for a much meatier, chewier texture.

When I told my husband I had made a tofu dish for dinner he looked at me with a funny face. He tried and said: "This is actually delicious!". I will definitely make it again and again!

Very good!  I used whole wheat orzu for extra healthiness.  I haven't cooked tofu in years, so I had a little trouble  cooking it.  At medium high, it took a long time (15 minutes) to brown, but when it did it was a little darker than I intended.  Of course, maybe its because of my ancient electric stove.  All in all, an excellent vegetarian dish!  Cheese lovers may want to purchase extra feta.

This was so DELICIOUS, first off I used a veggie boulin cube to give the pasta more flavor. When the pasta was done boiling there was no more water left. The pasta soaked it up. Second you can really put any veggies you like with this recipe I just put squash but next time I will definitely put more in. 
Third I only used 10 oz of tofu since it was just my b/f and I and 1 cup of Orzo. It was a perfect amount.

It was a good starter dish, though you may want to add in olives or something salty to balance the dish.

My husband and I are trying to add tofu to our regular diets, and this dish was a perfect way to incorporate it. I read several of the reviews and took their suggestions, adding sun-dried tomatoes (instead of raw ones), black olives, fresh basil (instead of dried), and added a few mushrooms as well. I will definitely make this again!! :)

Tofu takes about 15 minutes to brown properly, so cooking time is a bit off. Next time we'll add more feta, but otherwise, fantastic recipe. Light and filling.

My rating is based on two factors that may have fatally altered this recipe.  One is that I am allergic to wheat, so Orzo was out of the question--I used Basmti rice instead.  I think that, by itself, was an OK substitution, really.  But then I actually had crumbled goat cheese in the fridge, but not feta (which should authentically be made wtih sheep's cheese), so I used the goat cheese.  That was not the best choice--it was an overpowering flavor, even sprinkled lightly.  We served the remainder from the Wok & did not sprinkle the cheese on top, and then it was decent--delicate tasty flavors.  But, not a 5 star for sure, and even without the cheese it doesn't meet a 4 rating.    3+.  My 3 year old liked the meal wtihout the cheese.

This was my 2nd attempt to prepare tofu (the first was not all that exciting). I absiolutely LOVED this recipe! I used Jasmin rice in place of the orozo, added zucchini and mushrooms.  Wow!  What a great meal.  The feta is definitely a MUST!

Delicious! I made it just as the recipe says, except I used canned diced tomatoes instead of fresh. It was a simple, tasty tofu dish. I definitely will add this to my rotation.

I thought this recipe to be very versatile. I love the lemon & basil combo. I didn't have any orzo so I used Penne pasta. I added some shiitake mushrooms and fresh picked summer squash from the garden and topped it off with goat cheese. Even my 13 year old son enjoyed it. There were no leftovers! :) Very good.

This is really delicious and you can adapt it to what you have in your kitchen or what you like. I used penne rigate b/c that is what I had. I can never seem to find orzo. I really liked the texture that the pasta brought. I had red onion available, but I think you can use whatever you have and this will still turn out great! If you have fresh basil (I didn't), I think that we be the most delicious. I also had an avocado on hand. (I never have avocados, so it was a matter of chance.) I put some fresh avocado on the top with the feta cheese, and it was AWESOME! You really HAVE to have feta to know how awesome this tastes. When I make this again, I will make it just the same (the tofu was delicious), but I may use a different type of pasta. I will go out and hunt down an avocodo, though, because it was OUT OF THIS WORLD AMAZING.

I love every ingredient in this recipe, but it just did not work for me. I also boiled my orzo in chicken broth to try to add flavor. The tofu and orzo didn't seem to go together well for some reason.

Added Roasted Pine Nuts!!   I loved this recipe!!!  I put garlic and green onion in the olive oil as instructed using my wonderful wok.  Removed the garlic and green onions after a few seconds, " Oh, the aroma!!"  I may have added a tad more olive oil to wok, but the main thing is to keep the wok (or skillet) at a high temperature; stirring the cubed tofu from time to time.  A wok works better than a skillet.  It will become crispy and golden!!   (Don't wimp out on this step!)  I add both fresh and dried Basil and maybe a tad more lemon juice.    Also, .....add a few (roasted) Pine Nuts before serving.  Not everyone keeps Pine Nuts on hand, but for this dish, it's worth trying.  It is very important to do a taste test to get the orzo salted to your liking. Otherwise, you may think it's bland.  I've made this dish many times!  Love it!  Thanks for the recipe!!!!!

This is very tasty.  The only thing I'll do differently next time is brown the tofu first.  The onion and garlic were way overcooked by the time the tofu was browned. 

This was my first tofu-cooking experience so I have a bit to learn.

I made orzo for the first time last night, using this recipe, and it turned out quite well.  I browned the tofu a bit (about 5 mins) before adding the onions, garlic, and two handfuls of mushrooms.  I also added some red pepper flakes to give it a bit more flavor.  Unfortunately, I completely forgot the veggie bouillon cube for the pasta -- I will have to try that next time as it was missing just a BIT of flavor.  I think throwing in some greek olives with the feta would be delicious.   By the way, tofu takes AT LEAST 15 minutes to brown on medium-high with all the veggies in there so it wouldn't be a terrible idea to throw the scallions & garlic in 10 minutes into browning the tofu as mine got pretty shriveled up.

i think this is a good base recipe. As is I found it kind of bland. I think maybe a light dressing (olive oil, white wine vinegar & lemon) would help give it more flavor. And next time I think I'll use half the orzo...just too much for me...

The flavor was great. My only complaint was that my tofu crumbled as soon as I got it out of the package. I bought extra firm, and drained it, but it just didn't dice at all.

I followed this recipe to the letter and found it way too bland. It needs something, perhaps capers or Kalamata olives to really bring the flavors up.

I have to agree with user that recommended browning the orzo before cooking.  A very nutty flavor is evident after browning and is appealling to this recipe.  Add anything your little heart desires as far as veggies go, a winner!

My Husband and I are vegetarians for a month, so I decided to start cooking with tofu.  This recipe is so wonderful for 1st timers!  The orzo turned out al dente and the tofu fried up nicely.  The blend of seasonings were simple but made a big impact.  I will definately make this dish again!

This recipe was absolutely delicious! As suggested, I added artichoke hearts and zucchini and used vegetable bullion while boiling the orzo. I still used fresh tomatoes, though.  I've been looking for tasty vegetarian recipes and I was so pleased by the outcome of this one! YUM!

This was a great, easy dish that I made with a few changes.  First, I used canned diced tomatoes instead of regular.  I felt as if there was more juice to work with.  Then, I used about a cup and 1/4 of pasta.  There was still a lot - I could have gotten away with only using a cup.  But I liked the flavors - didn't think it was bland like other people say.  Just be sure to use lots of basil - it complements the flavors nicely!

Made it for lunch yesterday and it was delicious! My mom, who once said she'd never eat tofu again, had some and loved it. I drained the tofu for a couple of hours, and then marinated it with soy sauce and a touch of Worcester sauce. I also added an extra clove of garlic.

I used 2 cans of drained diced tomatoes and it worked fine. I cut the orzo in half so it was too tomato-y but that was my fault. I went light on the feta (I used goat) cheese and it definitely should have used the full 4oz. It was good and my 7 yr old ate it twice with no complaints.

WOWZAS!  I was so close to giving up on dinner because I couldn't find anything I wanted with the ingredients I had on hand...until I stumbled upon this beauty.  I used less orzo (mainly because I didn't have enough) but another reviewer suggested it anyway and it worked out perfectly!  I didn't have regular tomatoes, so I used some cherry tomatoes and I added some artichoke hearts for my normal reasons of "I had them and needed to use them."  Delicious!  I am looking forward to making this with fresh basil, but in a pinch, the dried works fine.  The lemon really gives it a fresh punch of flavor and I can't WAIT for the leftovers today at lunch.  Thanks so much!

I substituted whole grain penne instead of orzo and whole grape tomatoes instead of chopped. It turned out delicious! I'm going to make this recipe again and try baking the tofu rather than frying to make it a little healthier.

Yum! I made this with lemon pepper chicken because I didn't have tofu on hand, but had lots of tomatoes to use. It was good with or without feta and with more tomatoes if desired. My husband loved it and wouldn't stop talking about it for days. We'll definitely be making this again.

FANTASTIC! I, too, added sundried tomatoes along with regular tomatoes as well as used both green and yellow onions.  I made the orzo with stock.  My first time cooking with Tofu and it was a fantastic experience, thank you!

Great dish and even better when allowed to sit over night. Cooking orzo is chicken broth definitely improved the dish. When I make it again, I would put in onions later (or not at all) because they burned while tofu was browning.

This was excellent. I have made this several times now and its a great vegetarian option without lacking taste. Instead of feta I use parmesan cheese and instead of diced tomatoes I used canned chile tomatoes to add a little kick. Thanks!!

a great success for cooking tofu for my first time!  i used herbed tofu from the co-op i work at, so i only added 1 tablespoon basil.  also, i used about 2 cubes boullion in the water while cooking orzo.  followed the recipe otherwise.  the feta really makes this dish, so i also sprinkled parm on top too which was really good. definitely would make again and would probably add mushrooms!

Great dish! I subbed in spinach for edamame. Although the serving size is way off. The recipe says it's for 4 servings, I would say 8 is more accurate.

This is my favorite Tofu recipe so far. I read all the reviews before attempting it. I fried the Tofu in a wok first and and browned the Orzo a little. Since I heard that it could have a bland taste, I used a can of stewed tomatoes instead because I knew that it would already have a lot of flavor. I left out the Feta and basil because I am not a fan. This dish turned out wonderful. It even taste good the next day. I will definitely make this over and over again.

Just delicious, light olive oil flavor that blended well with the vegies. The only things I did different was use cherry tomatoes and saute mushrooms and zuchinni with the tofu.

This recipe has been a staple in my household for about a year now. With a few modifications it really becomes a WOW recipe. First, a few tips on preparing the tofu. In order to give the tofu a chewier texture, press it first. This can be done by layering 2 paper towels on top of a dish, placing the tofu block on top of that, layering 2 more paper towels, another dish, and placing two cans on top. Press for about 30 minutes. Then cut your tofu and freeze for at least an hour. The result: chewy tofu with a "meaty" texture. I also like to add a little dried thyme, oregano, and red pepper (probably about a tsp each, but I eyeball it). When the tofu is almost finished browning, I like to add in an additional minced garlic clove. I heat the tomatoes for just a minute before mixing it all together. In addition to the dried basil in the recipe, I added in about 3 shredded fresh basil leaves. The final touch: a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar.

With these additions this recipe has become a family favorite. Enjoy!

Used less orzo; next time I would dredge the tofu in a little four to make it crispier; fresh tomatoes were awesome.  I also boiled the orzo in vegetable broth and water for more flavor

I just made this recipe.  It came out great.  I used more garlic than the recipe called for and alot of black pepper and lemon.  I like alot of spice.  I also didn't put any cheese in it.  I used a can of diced roasted tomatos.  The entire meal took 20 minutes.  I will be definatly making this again!!

This was really good after I made some adjustments :)  I added in about 20-25 sliced olives and some crushed red pepper and it really kicked it up a notch :) I ate it for dinner and lunch the next day! Really tasty and not the typical tofu taste either!

Very good.  I used fresh basil instead of dried, but changed nothing else.  We will definitely have this again and again.

This recipe was fairly easy to make.  I followed the recipe pretty closely.  I'm living in a different country, and could not find Orzo anywhere, so I substituted Risotto rice.  I also almost doubled the amount of feta I used.  The recipe was a little bland, but I have made it again since and like it for myself.  It is not, however, something I would make for someone I was trying to impress.

For originality, I would give this more than 3 stars. However, I found this a bit bland. My family and I thought it was pretty good, but I don't think I would make it again.

This was awesome. My husband & I both loved it. I didn't measure any ingredients- just went by feel, but used everything except that I subsituted fresh majoran for the dried basil.
