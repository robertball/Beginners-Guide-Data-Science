Very good and easy. It could use some salt and pepper but could also work well with a variety of add ins. Next time I'll experiment with things like bacon or tomatoes.

Easy, quick, and very good. We don't like nutmeg so i substituted Italian herb mix and a pinch of cayanne.

Tasty and fast with a very little cayenne in the sauce and some cracked pepper on top.
