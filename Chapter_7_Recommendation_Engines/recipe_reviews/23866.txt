first of all, real soups are not made in a microwave. second, it had no flavor. when i made this soup (in a pot on the stove) i had to add garlic, thyme, basil and oregano to give the soup a full flavor.

I liked the quickness of this recipe which can be pulled together with leftovers as well as adding canned goods to it.
Definitely season to taste, which I like to do to meet dietary needs.

I decided to try this in the slow cooker, and it turned out great.  The only frozen okra I could find was breaded, but that even worked out to thicken the stew! I'll definitely do this one again.
