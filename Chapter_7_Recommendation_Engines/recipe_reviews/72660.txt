This is very light - almost too much so, some cream cheese blended with the blue cheese then the whipped cream folded in would solve that. The fresh herbs really over powered even the blue cheese. I loved the walnut base - I coarsely ground the walnuts in a mini food processor - then tamped them down with my meat therm. covered in plastic wrap. Great presentation and looks stunning.

I love this dish,  I made it with finley chopped blue cheese instead of crumbled and I think it made the flavor more robust. I also used tinfoil to make the mold because I didn't have one.
