This was lovely.  Like others, I substituted the salsa I had on hand for the taco sauce.  Also, I used a 95% avocado guacamole spread instead of the sliced avocados - less expensive and easy to spread on the bread.  I concur that this would be wonderful as a wrap.  The whole family loved it and agreed that it would make a nice lunch with guests.

I make this a lot. Not this exact recipe, but really close. I just use turkey, Tomatoes, Avocado and Basil. The basil gives it a lot of flavor, usually I mash my avocado and spread it onto my bread like you would mayo, only way thicker.  It's very healthy this way.

A really good sandwich with lots of flavor!  I too used salsa and added a little mayo to the cream cheese mixture as well.  I think this would also make a great wrap.

Nice combination of flavors! Just don't use peppercorn turkey. I did at first, and the pepper completed overpowered everything.

I omitted the cream cheese(wasn't in the mood) and added cucumber.  Tuna was used instead of Turkey. Very enjoyable.

I used salsa since I had no taco sauce. It was a nice change for a turkey sandwich. Anytime I use hot sauce my husband is happy.

This was really good. I loved the taco seasoning in the cream cheese. Nice twist. I didnt have lettuce so I used fresh spinach. I also put salt and pepper on the avocado and toasted the bread. I will DEFINATLY make this again!

Nice sandwich.  I like turkey and avocado, but the cream cheese is a bit too much creaminess for me.  I think I'll stick with my dijon mustard.  Thanks, though!  A nice refreshing sandwich!

This sandwich was just so so. I'll keep it around and will make it again, but it was nothing to jump up and down for.
