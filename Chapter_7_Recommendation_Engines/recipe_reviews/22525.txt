I made no changes to the recipe and wouldn't next time.  This review doesn't require a whole lot of words.  It's just a beautiful and different salad.  I loved it.  Hubs loved it. Simple as that.

I am giving this a 5 with a different dressing, I don't know if I am just bad at making dressing or I just didn't care for this one.  That being said, I used a balsamic vinegarette, and it was FABULOUS!  Hearts of palm, first time tried, LOVE THEM! Great Job!

I enjoy each of the main ingredients, but I did not like this salad. It ended up a bit oily and just didn't have a great flavor for me.  I  thought maybe the flavor would get better if I let it marinade overnight, but it didn't.  I just had to throw it away; no one was going to eat it  - I hate throwing food away.  Sorry, this just isn't a keeper for my household.

Unique quick salad...it was a hit at a family outing but may be too exotic for small children.

For me, this just didn't have the greatest flavor. I think it would have been better, on balance, if there had been more fresh than canned ingredients. The dressing was nice in theory but it came out a little too lemony for my taste and it made the salad too oily. Ultimately, this just wasn't one of my favorites.

It's a great base for a salad.  I added Avacado, bacon and a bunch of kale.  I will make this again for a large party again.

I tried this recipe at a family cook out and it was a big hit.  If you have all the ingredients it comes together quickly.

There wasn't too much taste other than the natural flavors... regardless my family loved it. I'll definitely make it again and maybe next time with balsamic vinegar.

Great recipe.  Added sliced water chestnuts (sliced in half) and added Italian blend - 4-cheese to the recipe.  Make sure to use Extra Virgin Olive Oil and let the mix marinade for at least 1/2 hr. in the refrigerator before eating.  Great side dish for steak or chicken.
