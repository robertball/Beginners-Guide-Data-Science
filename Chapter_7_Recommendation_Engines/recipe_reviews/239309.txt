Dry rub is not something I can actually take a spoonful of to taste, or at least I prefer not to.  But as I looked over the recipe I liked the combination of ingredients (omitting the cayenne pepper because we don’t care for heat) and I liked the looks of it.  I also felt good about it when I rubbed it on the baby back ribs I made for supper tonight.  I took the easy way out tonight and made “Slow Cooker Baby Back Ribs,” another recipe from this site, and as this recipe’s first reviewer I can happily say this rub took those ribs from good to great.

I used this on hamburgers and it did not disappoint.  Slightly sweet with a bit of a kick from the cayenne, it was a quick and easy way to liven up the burgers.  I can see using this on pork, chicken, or even shrimp.

The only change I would make would be to increase the cayenne pepper a little bit, but that is just a personal preference.  Very good rub on country ribs.
