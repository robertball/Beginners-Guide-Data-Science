Really tasty and easy to make, I'd recommend making rice to go with it.

We love the coloured peppers so I used those instead. This is a good ground chicken recipe; moist, good texture blend with the peppers, beans and tomato (needed salt). Turns out I didn't have black beans after I started, so I used red which was totally fine. The kids put lots of extra shredded cheese on once they cut open the peppers :) Thumbs up around the table!

Used red, orange and green peppers and made as directed.  Tasty but needed salt and I would mix some of the cheese in with the meat filling as the pieces with the cheese were delicious.  I would also leave the water out of the baking dish as I feel the peppers were steamed and I would prefer the roasted pepper flavour.  #EndWithAmazing #Ad #AllrecipesAllstarsCA

Another easy recipe with little prep time. Not the most exciting meal but still a solid one. Followed recipe exactly except for the colour of peppers. Green peppers don't do it for us at all. It was a little bland so I may add a little more spice to it next time, cayenne maybe and would definitely add jalapenos to the mix as suggested in the footnotes.

This recipe was really delicious! I substituted Italian sausage for the ground chicken. I also made cilantro lime rice to go on the side

I made this recipe and followed directions exactly except I omitted the black beans. It takes a lot of work and time but it taste very bland. My son said it's OK. He took leftovers to work for lunch but I did not eat it. The water in the bottom of the pan seemed to make the peppers too juicy and very little flavor.

Made it exactly as written and it was delicious.  My husband has a low sodium diet so I used no salt added tomatoes and beans and put less cheese on his pepper.  I used yellow and red peppers because that's what I had.  I only made two and have enough filling for chili tomorrow night for the two of us.  Yea - no cooking tomorrow!

The filling is great. Next time I'll just cut up the pepper and add it to the mix. This is delicious
