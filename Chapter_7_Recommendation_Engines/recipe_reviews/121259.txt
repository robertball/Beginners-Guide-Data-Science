TEN STARS!!!!!!!  Absolutely fabulous and super easy lasagna!  The sauce and the cheese are what make this recipe so special (I've never put parmasian cheese in the layers of the lasagna itself).  I did make two major substitutions, however: 1= ricotta cheese (mixed in with 1 egg, + basil, + chopped parsley, + some grated parm cheese) instead of the cottage cheese, and 2= italian sausage instead of the beef (I used 2lbs, b/c I actually doubled the sauce).
My husband just got a new job and this was a celebration meal-- and it seriously was better than any lasagna we've ever had at a restaurant!!  Thank you!

This was fantastic.  I didnt change anything except added a can of mushrooms.  I was very impressed--nice and juicy instead of stiff.  Just the way I like it!  I will definitely be making this again.

This was my 1st time to cook lasagna. This recipe was GREAT! The only thing I did different was I added some mild italian sausage, other than that DELICIOUS! The family loved it!!

Wonderful!  The best lasagne I have made.  I mixed the parm and the cottage cheese together for ease in spreading.  I use no boil noodles but soak them in room temp water for 20 minutes then drain before putting in the casserole.  That way they have already absorbed the liquid they need to cook leaving the lasagna PERFECT!!!!

Super easy.  It was so nice to not have to pre-cook the noodles.  I doubled it with good success.  Ok to make the sauce soupy as the noodles absorb a lot.

Grreeaatt recipe- next  time a little less sauce. I made the mistake of mixing the cheeses instead of layering them, but still quite delicous.

This was a very good dish. My sister doesn't like red sauce on her pasta and she just loved this.   The only thing I thought, is that I didnt think it had enough meat sauce. I added spaghetti sauce on the top of it before I baked it.  Overall it was very good and actually didn't take that long to make, very easy.

the sauce was so yummy I couldn't stop tasting it while I was layering the lasagna.  I didn't have a onion soup packet so I tried a dry Italian dressing packet and it was so yummy!! I also love that this recipe uses cottage cheese instead of ricotta, it's cheaper and I like the milder taste.  This is a keeper.

This is excellent!!!  I did everything exactly as the recipe states, except I replaced the beef with ground turkey, and replaced the cottage cheese with a ricotta mixture (ricotta, egg, basil and parm.)  Fantastic!!!!!

I made it just as written, and everyone in the house loved it.  It was very easy, and fed the family two meals.  It will become a frequent meal in the house.

I made this for my fiance for Valentines Day and he LOVED it! But instead of ground beef I used sweet italian sausage with basil. And I added extra basil to the sauce and I added a bit of rosemary. He loved it, and the next day we had the leftovers and his very picky dad LOVED it too! I am so making this again! It was really good, and easy to make.

Loved this recipe.  I used fresh oregano (1 T), 4 cloves of garlic, and italian sausage instead of ground beef.  Next time I will used 2 lbs of sausage instead of 1lb.  I also used ricotta and 1 egg instead of cottage cheese.  I will definitely make again!

This is a fantastic recipe.  I have made this many times and people are begging for more!  The only thing that I have done differently is add more meat mixture (1 1/2 lbs of beef instead of 1)and cut back on the water by using tomato sauce instead.  It makes for a more spreadable sauce.

Super simple, easy recipe that results in a soft, cheesy lasagna.  Use ricotta instead of cottage cheese if you want the lasagna to be a little sturdier; both versions are good.  
I used a little more than half a packet of onion soup mix due to the high salt content.

Great recipe... I added Italian sausage, some red pepper, Cayenne pepper, another 15 oz Tom Sauce and replaced the water with chicken stock. Turned out wonderful. The leftovers were argued over and taken! 

The only flaw I found was that it seemed salty to me, next time I will try to use as many low sodium products as I can.

I LOVE this recipe, my friends rave about it when I serve them. I sometimes sub ricotta for cottage cheese, and I add veggies like red pepper and mushrooms. I use whatever ground meat I have on hand, a mixture of beef and pork is really great.

Great!  I added some zucchini, squash, and mushroom as well.  I also used the no-boil noodles so I had to increase the baking time to 1 hour.

I looked over several of the recipes on this site and settled on this one. I love to cook and bake but this was my first homemade Lasagna. I would give this one 10 stars if I could. It was easy to make, it tasted like it came from a restraurant and the family loved it! I put onions, oilives and some extra cheese. I also didn't have enough cottage cheese so I mixed it with Ricotta and it came out wonderfully!! Be sure to let it sit for about 10 minutes after you pull it out of the oven.

I loved this recipe, but didn't follow it to a 'T'.
I read the reviews on it and figured out that it probably wouldn't have enough sauce for me.  So, I added an extra can of tomato paste and a 32 oz can of crushed tomatoes.  
It made lots of sauce, just how I like it.
I also didn't use cottage cheese, I used Ricotta with 2 eggs instead.
My husband and 2 year old loved it...and so did I!!

Delicious!  I doubled up and made two pans of this for a family gathering and it was a huge hit.  I used no-boil noodles to save time and it was a cinch to put together.  Then 10 minute sitting time is a must.  Everyone had second helpings and raved about it.  This is a keeper!

I swapped a few ingredients only because I didn't have everything.  I used spinach lightly seasoned instead of cottage cheese.  I left out the Parmesan Cheese altogether.  I also seasoned the meat prior to browning (except for oregano/sugar), drained and then added the sauces and remaining seasons.  Husband & 16 yr old loved it.  I will keep this as a regular.

This is the lasagna recipe I have used for 20 years.  I'm ready to branch out and try some others but you really can't beat this basic, yummy lasagna.

I made this for my boyfriend on his birthday, and the leftovers lasted MAYBE a day or two -- he just couldn't resist polishing them off. Since then, he's been hinting every other day or so that I should make it again.

this recipie is AWSOME, and even better the next day, my only advice to tweak it would be to add an extra 1/2 of can of each tomato sauce and paste, just to give enough to complete the finishing touches

It was fine but there wasn't enough meat sauce for the whole thing.

Mmm Mmm good!  I really don't like lasanga, or so i thought.  My son wanted me to make it b/c he wanted to know what "Garfield" was raving about, so we decided to cook it together.  I had virtually none of the ingredients on hand so I ended up spending alot on groceries (we're talking out-to-dinner for four), so next time, I won't splurge so much on ingredients, but if I don't, not sure it will be as good.  I used ground turkey instead of beef b/c it's healthier and I find it more flavorful.  The expensive stuff came when I decided to use fresh oregano and decided to do a ricotta cheese mixture (as suggested by someone else) of ricotta, parsley, fresh basil, and 1 egg.  This was great (but I'll probably use cottage cheese next time).  I also found goat cheese on sale so I added that as well.  In addition, there was a parmesan, asiago, romano shredded cheese mixture, so I used that instead of just plain parmesan.  I also used chicken broth instead of water.

I thought this was a very tasty recipe. As I was making it, I felt there wasn't enought sauce, so I actually left off the last layer of cheese and noodles so it didn't look too dry. I am going to make it again tonight. I plan to double the sauce and make 1 1/2 times the meat... Oh, I also substitued Italian sausage. Less healthy I'm sure, but very good!!

Delicious!!!  Used Ricotta cheese in place of cottage and it was very good.  This is a keeper.

honestly i couldnt eat this, i am a big lasgana fan, and never had it before with cottage cheese, or atleast with out ricotta cheese. so i gave it a shot. personally i didnt like it, but my guest loved every drop of it, i made two dishes of it, and there wasnt even much to clean afterwards. for my personal taste, next time i will replace the cottage with ricotta. other than that, all worked out wonderfully- oh, also added in broccoli- cut up finely.

I made this recipe, bu t in a hurry. I only let the meat simmer for 10 to 15 minutes. I also only let it cook for 30 minutes at 375. 

But I would suggest at least letting it simmer for the time recommended so the sauce cooks down well.

I would also recommend NOT adding salt...which isn't even listed. But sometimes you think, oh it might need some. NO...it made the lasagna overwhelming. Also I would suggest using less than an ounce of the onion mix.

Super easy recipe. I actually used left over taco meat and cheddar instead of parmesan cheese.

This recipe is fantastic and very easy! My whole family loved it.  The only change I made was to use the no boil lasagna noodles.  This is the second recipe I tried off this site and the clear winner.  I will make this often.  

Thanks for sharing, Kim Orr!

This lasagna was DELICIOUS! Great flavor!  The only change I made was I did not have a package of onion soup mix so I used a medium size whole onion and chopped into small pieces.  This was my very first time cooking lasagna and I had a boyfriend to impress that said his ex-wife could make the best lasagna!  He loved it, had seconds, and even took some to work the next day and said how delicious it was the second time.  I will definitely make this again and am saving in my recipe box!  Thanks for the great recipe!
