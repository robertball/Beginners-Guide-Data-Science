I made this recipe just as stated except used all canned peaches, as I don't really like canned pears. This was so easy to make--my 2 year-old even "helped." We ate it warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. I will make this again; however, I think it had too much applesauce in the fruit and will cut back to 1 cup next time. Also, I think this would be much better with cinnamon applesauce and Turbinado/raw sugar on top instead of granulated. I'm not a huge fan of biscuit topping, but this one was soft and slightly spongy, not hard like other biscuit toppings.

My family went nuts over this recipe.  My husband walked in the door after work salivating at the smell of it cooking in the oven! I was very skeptical about how this would taste using the applesauce and canned fruit, but the flavors melded together beautifully.  I followed the recipe exactly and used regular Bisquick for the top and frozen blueberries. #AllstarsMotts

I was fairly impressed with this recipe.  Considering it uses canned peaches and pears, and I used frozen blueberries, it came out tasting pretty darn fresh.  Winter's coming and that means sky-high prices for fresh fruit, so this will come in handy for a quick and easy dessert.  I used Heart-Smart Bisquick for the cobbler topping and sprinkled with some Turbinado sugar.  I did cut back on the amount of applesauce that I mixed into the fruit, it just seemed like too much.  This is a good compromise for a fresh-fruit cobbler.

Yummy treat!  I made a half recipe in a glass loaf pan.  I did not grease the pan but it came out just fine.  Used frozen blueberries and took the advise of other reviewers to reduce the applesauce in the fruit by half.  With a spoon I dropped the topping onto the fruit mix and then smoothed it to evenly cover the fruit.  A dashing of cinnamon over the topping made a pretty little loaf!  Served warm with whipped cream, YUM, will make again!  #AllstarsMazola

I thought this tasted fare. For the fruit I used 1 cup of frozen defrosted blueberries and 1 cup each packed of chopped mangoes and pears. Because I didn't have canned, I added 2 Tablespoons of sugar to sweeten up some and a small pinch of salt to the filling. I had the cinnamon applesauce so that is what I used for the whole recipe. I didn't have baking mix so I had to make some. I made 4 servings of Allrecipes Homemade Baking Mix recipe with the change servings button. I did sub butter for shortening in that recipe though. When I measured the mix, it came to 1 3/4 cup approximately. So, I just reduced the applesauce, added at that point, to 3/4 of a cup. I increased the baked time by about 10 minutes due to using fresh fruit. I baked it in a foil lined square pan and clean-up was easy too. I served it with whipped topping and fresh blueberries. I rated it 3 stars, based on the necessary changes, and the advice of others. It would need a little sugar, cinnamon, or other flavors to ones preference.

We all thought was just okay.  Without any added sugar in the filling, I think it at least needs sweetened applesauce.  After we added quite a bit of whipped cream it was better, but still not anything fantastic.  I may give this a try again, but I'll definitely use sweetened applesauce and possibly even the cinnamon variety.

Delicious and comforting. Super easy to make. My only issue was that the ratio of filling to topping seems off; we had a lot of dough on top, and each serving of biscuit didn't seem to have enough of the delicious fruit. I used frozen organic wild blueberries, which I think aren't as sweet, and homemade applesauce for the topping. I had no biscuit mix so used the recipe for Homemade Biscuit Mix from this site, scaled to 8 servings, to get about two cups. I rinsed my canned fruit too, otherwise I think it would have been too sweet. Will make again and try less biscuit :)

Oh, Motts!  I love you...but, this was a hard recipe to embrace -- I think the fruit mixture needs less applesauce, and perhaps fresh fruit instead of canned...and maybe less topping since it was so thick.  You're still a wonderful applesauce and we love you!

Very good for how easy it was!  I used peaches and pears in juice, and unsweetened applesauce.  I liked it, but it wasn't very sweet- we thought it would be a little better if the peaches were in light syrup instead.  I also reduced the applesauce in the filling to about 3/4 of what the recipe stated, just going by the look of the filling as I mixed it.  Great recipe!!

This just did not work me.  It tasted like warm applesauce mixed with fruit, topped with an applesaucy pancake.  One bite was enough for me.  I appreciate the effort, Mott's, but this just wasn't a winner at the LTH house.

This was a really quick, sweet family treat, easy to sort of throw together.  I used fruit in juice, so I added about a tablespoon of agave syrup to the pears, peaches, blueberries and only 1 cup of unsweetened  applesauce, then sprinkled with a bit of cinnamon.  I was really interested in the crust, and though it did come together easily, it was a bit heavy.  Five stars for ease of preparation, but I have to knock it down a star for the heaviness of the crust.  Perhaps one could cut down on the applesauce in the crust and add a bit of milk to make it more tender.

I liked this quite a bit.  I did half the amount of applesauce mixed in with the fruit and I was glad I did.  I used the Natural applesauce as the recipe states.  I decided to add about 1/3 cup frozen cranberries to the fruit and it was great.  Added a nice little tang.  Served warm with vanilla ice cream.  Two of my favorite things about this recipe are- its super easy and it's not an overly sweet dessert, which is a plus to me!  In addition, it's great that one can have all the ingredients on hand pretty much any time.  I keep frozen blueberries all year.  (I forgot to put sugar on top of the batter).  Thanks Motts!

I didn't use pears and I upped the blueberries to about 2 cups, and it turned out fantastic! I also used brown sugar as the topper. Added a bit more flavour overall. Will keep using this recipe for a while.

This is the best cobbler I’ve tried that used canned fruit.  The only change I made was to cut back on the applesauce that was mixed into the fruit.  Topped with a little whipped cream, this makes a company worthy dessert.

This blew my mind. I haven't had cobbler in years because I am such a health nut, but I had trouble finding much wrong with this! So excited to have found such a healthy, warming dessert!
