A new family staple. I prepare from dry beans, using a little vegetable bouillon for their cooking. Fresh mint definitely adds to the flavor. As is, the recipe is a solid four stars; adding feta at serving time makes it five.

Really good!  I added some extra things that we like-green peppers, black olives and toasted couscous.  Also added a bit more lemon juice.  Really easy, healthy and refreshing.

This salad is super tasty! Came across a different recipe that called for mint and jalapeno pepper and didn't have any and for this recipe the mint was optional so I decided to make this one instead. Changed tomatoes to grape tomatoes, and red onion to regular sweet onion because I didn't have any of those. Turned out great even with the minor changes. Def will make it again. Thanks for sharing!

Very good! I used dried parsley and dried mint, so I used them to taste. Nice and refreshing salad that I would make again! Thanks for sharing. :)
