To avoid undercooked lentils and to shorten the required hour of simmering, the first step of this recipe should be: Boil 1.5 cups of water. Add 1/2 cup of lentils. Cover and simmer on low heat while you prepare the rest of the recipe. (that probably takes about 15-20 minutes.) Lentils will be softened.  Drain lentils and add to the tomato-bean pot and simmer for however long you have available, but  at least 15-20 minutes to blend flavors. 

I did the above plus added another can of beans (whatever you have-I had great northern beans) It came out great. The raisins were an excellent idea. 
 I also accidently added 2 Tbsps of cumin.  Still tasted great.  Thanks.

After reading most of the reviews, I can see that I probably should have mentioned that the lentils used in this recipe are the tiny orange lentils that cook very quickly.  I get mine from the organic section of the market.  Canned or soaked lentils will work too, so long as the liquid and cooking time is adjusted accordingly.  Also, as a side note, I use whole cumin seeds which I toast and grind in a spice mill... but ground cumin works just as well.

What an awesome recipe!  Thank you for sharing.  The only change I made was adding about half a can of chicken stock to help cook the lentils.  Might consider adding coconut milk next time, for a south Indian flare.  BTW, the grapes are not optional.  If you don't have them around, make a special trip. They are totally worth it.  Try golden raisins instead of the plain black.  A dollop of sour cream on top can cut the heat of the curry and makes it really tasty!

Great recipe.  I had to make some adjustments based on what I had on hand (did not use additional cumin, used "hot" curry, 1 14 oz can of roasted diced tomatoes and 1 14 oz can tomato sauce in place of crushed tomatoes) and also added mushrooms with the onions and garlic, as well as a little veg stock/water to get to the consistency I wanted (and due to extended cook time).  Served with chopped cilantro and a dollop of plain yogurt (didn't have sour cream).  I also let it simmer longer than 1 hour and let sit for a couple of hours before serving.  The taste became more mellow and sweeter over time.  It was excellent and everyone loved it.  I didn't have a problem with the lentils being undercooked because I let it simmer longer.  I think the additional time improved the flavor.  I definitely will make again.  I might try different tomatoes or beans next time.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is the best bean curry recipe that I have made. My teenage son, who normally will never even try my vegetatian recipes, loved this too. The raisins disintegrated while simmering and added a wonderful sweetness to balance out the spices. I recommend a dollop of plain yogurt on top before serving.

This was really delicious!  I left out the raisins because my kids don't care for them.  I also pre-cooked the lentils in some chicken broth (I know that negated the vegetarian aspect of the dish, but we're not vegetarian, so I was okay with that).  I added the lentils along with the residual broth (about 1-1/2 cups) to the rest of the ingredients and simmered for another 45 minutes.  I served this over brown Jasmine rice cooked in chicken broth with a little butter mixed in.  This recipe gets 5 stars for flavor, but only 3 stars for preparation because the lentils really do need the pre-cooking and the extra liquid in order to be tender.  Overall, the recipe gets 4 stars and we will definitely be having this on a regular basis.

This is easy to make and very tasty.  I didn't have any lentils so used 1 large potato cut in small chunks and green peas (parboiled then added in the last 30 minutes).  Served with jasmine rice. Will surely  make again.  Thanks for vegetarian recipe.

My husband and I just loved this recipe!  We are definitely making it again.  I added some large chunks of bell pepper and carrots when I added the lentils, etc.  Made it with some naan bread, and it was just perfect.

This is a wonderful, flavorful recipe.  It's definitely going to become a regular dinner option in our home!  I only made two slight adjustments. Just because I'm not a huge fan of cayenne pepper, I left that out.  I also added half a tbsp of ground ginger, a flavor I love in many curry dishes.

I'm a huge fan. Recipe definitely comes out better if you cook the lentils a head of time or you'll be going through gallons of vegetable broth to cook 'em up.

I LOVE this recipe!  It will now be a staple in our home!  It's so ridiculously easy!  Changes I made: I used one can of crushed tomoatoes (about 14 oz insead of 28) and used fire-roasted crushed tomatoes instead of plain.  I added about two cups of vegetable broth and one can coconut milk.  I also added a tbsp of ground coriander seed.  And a pinch of red pepper flakes.  It was UH-MA-ZING!  YUM YUM YUM.  Oh, I didn't pre-cook the lentils, and had no issues.

This was a pretty good basic curry recipe. I used white kidney beans and added some yellow bell pepper and mushrooms, as well as a bit of cinnamon. It tastes great, but needed more liquid to be added halfway through the cooking time.

This was really good!  I was skeptical about the raisins but they really added a great, touch of sweetness to the strong flavor of the curry.  I followed some of the other reviewers and added about a 1/3 cup of coconut milk right at the end of the cook time and added a tbsp of garam masala when adding the seasonings.  This recipe makes a up a full pan of food, so if you are only two persons you can easily cut the recipe in half and probably both still have seconds.

Made this with a few alterations and found it to be very good.  I omitted the lentils, doubled up on the chickpeas and used canneillini beans instead of red kidney. I also added two potatoes cut in 1/2 inch cubes which gave it a nice texture. Finally I omitted the raisins because I don't care for them in cooked food.  My wife thought diced tomatoes would have worked better than the crushed, but I thought the crushed worked quite well.

I kept the heat around medium and added water periodically to cook the lentils quicker.  Otherwise, made this exactly as printed and it was excellent!  Will be having this one again.  Thanks!

Fantastic!  This was my first time using curry in a dish, and it was a big hit.  I went easy on the black pepper because I didn't want it to be too spicy, but next time I'll be more generous ... and maybe add some cinnamon!

This smelled awesome when it was cooking, and tasted pretty great, too.  It has an interesting flavor, especially when you get a bite with raisins in it, but it is tasty and delightful.  I basically followed the directions, but I did pre-cook the lentils, added an extra teaspoon of cumin, and used more than a "pinch" of cayenne pepper (3 or 4 shakes).  I left the lid on when it simmered, so it might have come out a bit thinner than intended.  I had it over brown rice.  I'll be making this again.

It wasn't bad but felt it was missing other common ingredients. I added white beans and water to this and simmered for an hour.

Excellent! The whole family liked this, we had it with some yoghurt. it's not too spicy of a curry on its own, my 1.5 year old ate it plain without problems.  I would probably cook the lentils first like another reviewer suggested, I had to stir quite a bit and I added water throughout the hour of simmering.  Will definitely go into the recipe box! Thanks :)

I agree with an earlier reviewer, tomatoes are overwhelming.  Definitely more like a chili than a curry.  Also, I reduced the # of servings to 4 and had to add about 2 cups of water throughout the cooking process just to prevent the curry from burning on the bottom of the pot.  The added water basically diminished all of the other flavors.

A little sweet for us, but otherwise pretty good. Next time I will atleast halve the raisins.

I love to eat and cook Indian food, but this didn't do much for me and I followed the recipe with the exception of adding powered coconut milk at the end to try to help it out.

Great tasting!  I cut the curry to 1 T, as I'm somewhat new to the flavor, and I enjoyed it.  The raisins add an interesting sweetness! I agree with other reviewers that the lentils need some precooking!

LOVE this. Two changes I made: add ground turkey to the veggies in the beginning. Adds a great flavor and some meat to the dish if your family likes meat like mine. Also, for more flavor, sprinkle the finished dish with chopped fresh cilantro.  I serve this with jasmine rice and a dollop of plain yogurt. Fabulous!

Delicious!  I agree with everyone about the addition of the raisins - adds an interesting sweetness and surprises with each mouthful.  Like a lot of other people, I tinkered with the recipe ... I didn't have enough of the tomatoes, more beans plus spinach.  Yum.  Will make this again and again and again!!

My family gave this 5 stars. The raisins are a really nice surprise. Simmer this covered to keep it saucy enough to go on rice. Next time I'll add more cumin.

I have made this a number of times. Wonderful! Great as-is but I made a couple of modifications on later tries that I liked too. I use 3 different color beans (plus the kidney bean is one I just don't care for). Use the special multi-color jumbo raisins for a beautiful presentation. Once I added an extra can of tomatoes right at the end and they were larger pieces and bright red and the contrast was beautiful. I have also added coconut milk sometimes and that was very nice too.  Very easy! I used the small orange lentils as suggested and they worked perfectly every time without having to pre-cook them. Just love this recipe and it is quite easy. Also nice to know I have a really fabulous thing to serve my vegetarian friends.

My mother is from India so of expectedly I love Indian cuisine.  This was so good.  I hate raisins, but in this case the raisins actually were the deciding facter in this recipe; the perfect touch of sweetness.  My husband, who loves his meat actually wanted moti.  Next time I will make chapati to go with...

I like the taste.  It's not like I've cooked before.  I don't think I generally mix tomato with curry.  I had to add a bunch of water to get the lentils to cook, though.  Maybe I used the wrong kind, I used a small hard orange lentils (not the larger orange ones).  I don't know how much water I added, maybe about a cup overall.  The flavor is definitely unique.  I liked the addition of the raisins.

Tasty recipe with some additions. Added potatoes, green pepper, mushrooms and just prior to serving a can of coconut milk and chopped cilantro. I omitted the raisons. Lentils required longer cooking time. Husband and 5 year old enjoyed it.

This was just okay to me.  It more or less tasted like chilli.  The lentils hardly cooked at all, I had to add some chicken broth and simmer the "chilli" over 1/3 hour more to get the lentils at an edible stage.  I served it with naan (from this site).  I would probably try this recipe again, only not use lentils or at least soak them.  It was very healthy almost fat free.

Doubled the raisins, and used golden raisins instead of regular ones.  It was very delicious.  I served it to a picky vegan friend of mine, and she loved it too.

I love that I didn't have to change a thing about this recipe!  (I did sub pinto beans for the garbanzos, but that was just a preference thing.)  It was wonderful and simple and simply wonderful!  :)  Even my picky kids loved it! This was our first venture in vegetarian cuisine and it was the perfect start!  Thank you so much for sharing.

I loved this recipe.  The only suggestion would be if you don't like Garbanzo beans due to the texture, suppliment with great northern white bean.  The flavor is so neutral that it doesn't interfere with the original recipe without the super-starchy texture of the garbanzo.

This is a great recipe! I, too, found it easier to pre-cook lentils, and afterward, ended up simmering all ingredients together about half an hour. Not only is it delicious, but just look at the ingredients! It's a healthy recipe to boot!

It tasted more like Indian chili than a curry, but still very good. I think next time I'll double the curry powder and par-cook the lentils in 1/2 cup of water, and then only simmer for 30 minutes.

This recipe was fantastic!! I made it very mild ( half the amount of curry powder and omitted the cayenne pepper) so my 1 year old and 3 year old sons could eat it.... they LOVED it!! We will definitely be making it again!

This recipie had a good flavor, although I had to add a little more curry powder than called for, prob since I added a few cut boiled potatoes.  Also, I chopped up some carrots and let the curry simmer with about half a can of coconut milk.  I only needed one can of tomatoes for the flavor I wanted.  Also, I didn't have just golden raisins, so I threw in a mix of the golden raisins, dried cherries, dried blueberries, and dried cranberries.  I liked it!!

I did enjoy this a lot! It was so easy, and didn't require the exotic spices that are so pricey from the organic grocery. I only gave it 4 stars because I think it could have been more flavorful, but I'm not sure what would have made it that way. Also, it burned the bottom of the pan pretty badly (maybe I used the wrong pan).

Was okay.  Definitely fine to eat but was way too overwhelmed by tomato.  Was the consistency of chili with Indian flavours - odd.

I dumped all the ingredients in a crock pot and cooked it on low while I was at work. Worked perfectly! I only gave this 4 stars because while it was good, my husband and I didn't think it was great, probably not something I'd put in our regular rotation.

One of the best vegetarian recipes I've come across. My husband added some cashew nuts to his, and although i was skeptical at first, it added a whole new textural dimension to the dish! well worth trying.

Highly recommended, the flavor is great and it's super healthy.  I had never made any time of curry at home before and this was a great way to start.

This was very good.  I only changed the recipe by using brown lentils (what I had), and using 1 T. cumin, because I love it.

This was a great recipe. I was making it for only two so I used one can of mixed beans instead of the kidney and chick peas, and I'm not a big spice fan so I cut out the cayenne, and I halved the cumin and added a little ginger and cinnamon., and it still turned out great.

Very good, but not good to eat before a big date!  Also, made my whole apartment REEK for about 5 days.  Still, totally worth it for the protein punch.  I used crushed red pepper and chili powder instead of cayanne and added sweet italian peppers and shiitake mushrooms.  Very yummy on brown rice or whole grain pasta.

It didn't turn out as I expected it would, I didn't really care for the taste and the lentils took much much longer than a hour to cook. My husband didn't mind it though.

My vegan sister loved this! I did too, but my dad wasn't awestruck by it. he enjoyed it certainly, but not his favorite. as for my other sister and brother, i'm not sure, they were out and about that night and may not have tried it. delicious blend of flavors!

Wonderful recipe. I made a few modifications:  After heating oil in pan, I added 1/3 teaspoon black mustard seeds, 1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds, 5 curry leaves. Saute 30 seconds. Then add onions, and continue recipe.  I deleted powdered cumin from the recipe and added 1 teaspoon of all spice instead. I added some water at the end and bumped heat up to medium to fully cook lentils.

My husband made this for us tonight.  It smells wonderful when you walk in the door.  He said that it was very easy to make but a bit time consuming as you have to cook the lentils for quite a while.  Well worth the try.

Great recipe. I cooked the lentils beforehand and used dried cherries instead of raisins. It turned out wonderful and I suspect it will be even better tomorrow.

Followed the advice of cooking the lentils separately first. No other changes. Came out great. very filling. My 1 and 4 year olds ate their whole bowls with no complaints!

I followed the steps. It is wonderful. As a vegetarian, choices tend to be limited. I highly recommend this for curry lovers.

Not having the quick cooking lentils, I soaked the lentils in water for an hour, while I got other things ready. Then I cooked the lentils in a cup of vegetable broth about 15 minutes until it absorbed all the broth.  Then I made it as written and it was delicious! It might be a little too much curry for some, so if you like your curry mild, cut back a bit. Update:  I took this to a vegetarian friend who was sick an she loved it!

Even though I did a couple of minor tweaks, I followed the basic recipe and feel that I can give it a 5 star rating.  Changes that I made:  pre-cooked the lentils and raisins in about 1 1/2 cups of water for about 20 mins.  While that was cooking, I continued with the rest of the recipe.  I used ghee to cook the onion, added a little extra cumin than the recipe states and only one 15 oz can of diced tomatoes.  Substituted white kidney beans for the red (one full can).   Added the lentil and raisin mixture to the rest of the pot including all the liquid.  Added himalyan salt and black pepper to taste.  Covered and let it simmer for about 45 - 60 mins, stirring occasionally.  At the end of the simmering, I added about 3/4 cup coconut milk.   My house smells amazing and from the little bit of sampling I did while it was cooking, it tastes amazing too!

Love this and the many variations I have completed (adjusted for what's on hand) and yes, soften the lentils first.

Very good, but could use some tweaking. Making your own curry blend would add a fantastic dimension to the meal as the quality of your spice blend will make or break the dish. I also like a spicier curry, this was very mild and I ended up jazzing it up with red pepper flakes and extra cayenne.

This is excellent and so easy to make! I added more canned tomatoes, beans and I also added coconut milk. I'm not a chef, so to all struggling cooks out there....this is for you!!!!!
