Meh - I didn't care much for the chili sauce taste. I think I would have preferred salsa or hot sauce instead. It needed to be more chile pepper and less tomatoey. Mayo made it creamy. I think this would be better wrapped in a flour tortilla.

Husband liked this more than I did - I personally don't think you can beat good old-fashioned plain scrambled egg on toast - and said he would like it every now and again. Thanks!

I really dislike giving bad reviews but nobody here liked these. The boys took one bite each and then refused to eat anymore. I ate a little because I DID like the creamy texture but the taste was like an egg-ketchup thing and I don't like ketchup anywhere near my eggs. People who like ketchup on their eggs will probably like these though; and, like I said, the creamy texture is appealing. Thanks anyway Scaryberry.

Wow this is soooo good. I did not have chili sauce so I used ketchup and mayo. I love this mixture in the eggs.Thank you for the great idea.
