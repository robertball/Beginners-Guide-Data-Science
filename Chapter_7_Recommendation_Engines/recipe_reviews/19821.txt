I made this with the sugar-free gelatin and the low fat whipped topping, and it turned out great.  I would advise that the whipped topping is completely thawed and that you stir it in with a wisk.  Also, I chilled it and served it in martini glasses and it came out in beautiful layers with no extra effort!

This is certainly easy and affordable to make, but I would never serve this to company. The finished product taste like creamy lemon jello, nothing like a mousse.  I also didn't like the artificial taste of the lemonade coating  my throat after 4-5 bites. I made this with the kids since it was a fun, easy dessert on a hot day. Overall, the texture is too jello-like, but I wasn't expecting much due to the simple ingredients.  I was going to serve this to guests but decided against it.  Fun for kids but nothing more.

Wonderful tart flavor. I made it for a group of 50 people, used lime instead of lemon. Piped into pastry shells and decorated with white chocolate flowers, whipped topping and raspberry sauce. I made it for a womens retreat, and they all just raved over its flavor and look. Definitely will make again, varying the flavors for some more fun!!!

This is excellent! I didn't have the lemon jello or the lemonade, so I used lime jello and limeade instead. It was a big hit with my family! My hubby said it tasted like Key Lime. Yum!!!

We really enjoyed this, and the fact that it can be frozen is a definite plus.  The texture is very much like a mousse, it's light, and the lemon flavor is bold with just enough sweet-tart flavor.  I used sugar free jell-o and fat-free whipped topping with no sacrifice to taste.  It took close to 1-1/2 hours for the lemonade mixture to thicken to the point where I could beat in the whipped topping, and several hours longer in the fridge to jell, so plan accordingly.  For those of you on Weight Watchers, I calculated the points based on 12 servings, and the point value is 2.  Very nice end to a spring meal.

I dissolved the jello in only 2 cups boiling water, then mixed it with the frozen lemonade concentrate and chilled until it began to set (40 minutes or so?). Then I beat in the cool whip (in small amounts at first so it didn't get lumpy) and put it in a 9 x 13 pan in the freezer for about 10 minutes. While it was in the freezer,I pureed 3 cups fresh strawberries, then poured this in lines over the lemon mixture and swirled with a knife. Returned it to the freezer until firm. It was so yummy..tastes like strawberry lemonade!

Sorry, we all thought this tasted like lemon flavored cool whip.  I could never eat more than a bite or two of this.  Maybe I should try it with a different flavor.  We like lemons though, and lemonade, but we all thought this was not good at all.

This is very good.  Not quite the consistancy of mousse but very good.

My sister made this for Mother's Day & it was absolutely delicious! I love that it is a little tart. It tastes similar to the filling on lemon meringue pie. She used sugar-free gelatin & light Cool Whip, so it was not too caloric. We just loved it!!! Good job. :)

I love this recipe!  I made only one substitution, I used a can of Mountain Dew instead of the lemonade. I turned out very well, and I got many questions for the recipe at a recent baby shower.

Delicious! Use a whisk to mix in the Cool Whip. Will look watery. Make well ahead of time...even overnight. The consistency takes hours to smooth out. If too tart add a bit of Splenda. Great and easy!

I made this for my daughter's wedding shower.  I put it in clear plastic punch cups, added a dollop of cool whip and a thin quarter slice of lemon on top of cool whip. Everyone loved it! Thank you for an awesome recipe.

I divided the recipe in half (there's just 2 of us-we saved the rest in the freezer).  I used 6 oz can of limeade, sugar free lemon jello, & lite whip topping.  It's fantastic!  Just like an airy version of key lime pie w/o crust.

This is a easy, great tasting recipe. Has the lemon pie flavor but is very weight watcher freindly. Co-workers loved it since we are all on weight watchers. I also used the sugar free Jello for this. I am going try other flavors- melon or cherry or chocolate pudding. Yum  - dlm843

I made this recipe and followed the directions some of you do not seem to think this is important! It says "beat the mixture for 10 min." You have to in order to get the mousse consistancy! If you just stir the cream whip in with a whisk you do not get the correct results. If your jello takes so long to set up you did not measure the water correctly or your refrigerator needs temp. guage checked. Anyway we all loved it!

This is a great recipe but I found that I could make it with practically NO calories and it is just as yummy.  I used 2 pkgs of sugar free jello instead of the regular, added the hot and cold water and 1-1/2 cups of lemon juice ( I have done fresh squeezed and I have used bottled and I taste no difference). My family prefers it with no added sugar. I chose light whipped topping one time and the fat free another , both were good.  I put it in a clear glass bowl and layer with blueberries.  I have served it a number of times to rave reviews, even the men like it!  Great dessert for those guests who are constantly on a diet!  Keeps in the refrigerator for a long time. You can 1/2 the recipe and it works quite well.

I served this in martini glasses with sliced strawberries on top.  Originally the strawberry was just for color, but the taste of the two together was amazing!!  It was like strawberry lemonade.  This was a great simple recipe and there are so many ways you could tweak it to make it your own!  Thanks for a great idea!

I made this for a family gathering and it was a big hit! The kids especially loved it.  The theme of my party was grapes (I have a small vineyard in my yard)and it was time to pick grapes.  I substituted and used grape jello and frozen grape concentrate.  It was delicious!  The kids loved the color!  Can't wait to try the lemon version.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  Thank you PJ!

This recipe is tart. Very, very, very tart.  I had to mix it half and half with sweetened strawberries before I would eat it. It also made a ton. We had about nine 3/4 cup servings. It was okay, but would not make again.

Fabulous dessert, you can change the flavour to orange or lime just by changing the gelatin and frozen juices. I also used the sugar free gelatin and light Coolwhip to lessen the calories. I poured each serving into a single portion and served with more whipped topping and a few fresh berries. A lovely refreshing dessert after a heavy meal.  This is our go to dessert after Christmas Dinner

I was very unimpressed with this recipe.  It was a bit lumpy and the layers separated with all the cool whip floating to the top.
Mostly it was much too sour - and I like sour!  You could only eat a few bites.

This recipe really didn't work out at all. First, the jello part took overnight to set enough for me to add the whipped cream, the finished result was soft and didn't hold its shape at all like a proper mousse would, and the taste was tangy to the point of being bitter.  I was looking for a light citrus dessert with a bright flavor, and was sorely disappointed. Won't be making this again.

I am so glad that I didn't let the reviews that stated that this was too, sweet, tart, lemony deter me.  And I'm so glad that I made it a day early.  The day I made it, it WAS to sweet, tart, lemony!!  But by the next day all the flavors had magically smoothed out and it was delicious.  I served it in pretty martini glasses with a dollop of Cool Whip for Christmas dinner dessert.
