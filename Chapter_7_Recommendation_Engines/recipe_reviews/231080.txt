I'm so sorry but we didn't like this at all :( I know there are thousands of variations of meatloaf out there & everyone likes something different...this was just inedible for us. I used all ground beef cuz we don't care for ground turkey & a mix of red & green peppers instead of all green. No other changes, just didn't care for the flavor, or lack of. Just not our kind of meatloaf.

This was great. I doubled the veggies and used 2 pounds extra lean ground beef. I also doubled the oats and used an extra egg. It was enough to make 2 large loaves. It could have used a little more ketchup. It did fall apart a little, so I think next time I'll use another egg.

I left out the green peppers, used all turkey meat and replace the parsley with sage, then baked in muffin papers for 25 minutes. Delicious!

This is a great basic meatloaf recipe that you can use & add or take away according to what you have on hand.  I made a ground turkey meatloaf in my ninja 3 in 1 slow cooker.  I had a tomato that was past its prime so I whizzed it in my blender with an onion, mushrooms, celery, peppers (red/yellow).  I was out of oatmeal so I substituted stove top chicken flavored stuffing. I ground up in my blender.  BONUS it's already seasoned !  Gently mixed everything no need for any other liquid as the tomato/stove top was a great binder..

I cut up the veg a little more chunky. Plan to add zucchini and more veg to this next time.  Used tomato sauce (with low sugar content) instead of ketchup which really helped to cut down the sugar, also spread some on top of the loaf which was nice.  Great meatloaf. Thanks

Very tasty. I substituted mushrooms for the celery (personal preference),used only ground turkey and whole wheat bread, which helped hold it all together better. Perfect taste and consistency!!!

I am desperately trying to find recipes that secretly include veggies to get into my family, but, unfortunately, this was not our favorite.  I followed the recipe pretty closely and it was very bland, had a strange texture, and just crumbled apart.  Oh well!

I loved this recipe!  So did the hubby.  My kids were not huge fans, but they don't really like meat.  I added a ketchup brown sugar mixture to the top of the loaf for the last 30 minutes in the oven.  Delicious!

I wanted something healthy made with Turkey and don't want to use bread crumbs. This is perfect. My 1 year old son LOVEs LOVEs it. So does my husband.

My family loved this!  I used pureed spinach and skipped the peppers.  Was great!
