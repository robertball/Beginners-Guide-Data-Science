This has a very good taste to it.  The only reason why it has 4 instead of 5 stars is because the coconut oil clumped together.  If you drink this smoothie right after you make it, it probably doesn't have that issue.  But I take mine to work with me and then drink it for lunch.  I even took it in a shaker cup and the clumsiness was too much to break up.
