I cut this back to TWELVE servings. I followed the recipe exact only I omitted the file powder only because I could not find it anywhere and I don't have money to order special ingredients for one recipe. Even so, we REALLY liked this rub. I mixed it with a half cup of flour and coated pork chops with it--absolutely delicious. NO leftovers. NOTE: When I cut this back to 12 servings, this coated 6 biggish pork chops (with the half cup of flour).

yes, this recipe makes alot of rub. i cut it down to a third to use on a pork butt and i had enough rub to season at least 2. this is by far the best rub i have ever used. i love the addition of file' in this recipe. this will now be my go to recipe for any meat calling for a spice rub.

This was a fantastic rub... tried it out on a nice pork butt on our grill.  Only thing I didn't use was the file powder - couldn't find it.  But I'm still looking, and want to try it again!

We smoked a 200 lbs. pig (not confinement) this past weekend and used this rub recipe, after making a few small changes ~ 
Starting off we doubled everything, then tasted and thought it was still too tame so we added another 1 cup of spicy paprika, 1 cup smoked paprika, 1 cup of reg. paprika, 3/4 cup black pepper, and instead of each of the herbs I used 1 cup of Italian herb mix and left out the dill weed and the File powder (couldn't find File in our stores)
The day before the party we injected our brine every 6" and let that absorb.The next day about 4 hours before we started the smoking we applied a heavy dose of oil and inserted garlic cloves deep into the muscle then started the dry rub and placed him on racks lined with heavy foil to retain the juices as "Sally" began her 8 hour smoke.
Turned out great, very tender & not dried out at all!
We had several ask what rub we used, and by the way sauce was not needed, the meat had enough flavor on its own!

This rub is a keeper!!!

To Sarah Jo and Lisa R. Where I’m from the file’ is bottled and marked Gumbo File’. It can be on the spice isle but if not it will be on the isle with the beans, rice and boxed rice/pasta dishes or at least it is where I live. It’s not too expensive of a spice especially for what it adds to the rub. Hope this helps. Happy cooking!!

This is insanely good! I just used it on a 14lb. pork shoulder picnic. Rubbed it on yesterday and put it in the Treager smoker for 16 hours today. As luck would have it Safeway had file as a new item.:) I left out the salt (CHF) but smoked it tastes salted anyway. Very, very good.

This was a great rub for pork roast. I also used it on steaks before grilling. They were wonderful!

I scaled this recipe down to 36 servings and had more than plenty for my rack of ribs.  I really liked all of the different flavors that I have not seen in other rub recipes.  I omitted the file and the tyme only because I did not have any on hand.  Thanks for a great recipe.

A pretty good Rub.  I have a couple retail rubs I like better but I don't have them on hand all the time or know their recipe.  Luckily I have File powder so this one was a sinch to make and have on hand.
I prefer to coat the meat w/ cheap prepared american yellow mustard to make the rub stick.

we really enjoyed this on ribs.. i was worried about it being too salty since it called for kosher salt and i was using table salt so i cut back a little.. but next time will use the full amount as that's the only thing we felt it was missing.. didn't use the file powder and think i'd have to order it online or find it in some specialty store.. also only used 1/3 of the thyme.. ty for the recipe ~~UPDATE: i was finally able to get a hold of some file and again, this was SO good.. i reduced this to 10.5 servings (my math) and i doubled the kosher salt this time.. still reduced to 1/3 the thyme and i used it on a 2 lb pork tenderloin.. there was enough leftover to use on another.. ty again for a great rub

Used this rub on country ribs with only two changes. I cut the garlic in half just for my preference and marinated the ribs in liquid smoke since I was cooking in the oven. It came out amazing. Even my son that doesn’t like pork ate some and raved about how delicious it was. It is definitely a keeper! I feel bad for those that couldn’t find filé cause it is so readily available in south Louisiana and is so yummy. I get it fresh ground, but store bought would work in a pinch.  Keep searching as Cajun food has gotten more popular and available.

I used this on some pulled pork over the weekend and will say it added a pleasantly unique flavor. I cut it in half and still have quite a bit left over. I'm looking forward to seeing how it turns out on ribs and chicken as well.

I use this rub on everything pork. When I make it I always add me extra Chyanne pepper, peprica, and file powder. I make the file powder from fresh sassafras leafs that I get in the woods by my house. Best pork rub ever had!!!

very good flavor it took me about a week to find the gumbo file aka Sassafras. I order it on ebay so if you  guys can't find it on the store shelf just do as i did ,  other  than that it was easy to make . i used it on chicken breast it has a earthy natural herb taste taste so organic .  but it is a great started to build your own rub off of . but i would add more flavors to it verse take any thing from it . it goes good mixed with ground beef makes great burgers . thanks

I have had the opportunity to use his rub on chicken, beef & pork during 'low &slow' smoking sessions with wonderful results but pork is this dry rubs' true calling!  The unique flavor of the dill and gumbo file in this rub makes for a savory experience with a very subtle sweet finish from the brown sugar although I think I will add a little more sugar  and cayenne for the next batch as we like our BBQ sweet & spicy.  Picnic shoulder and ribs come out super flavorful every time!

I don't have a smoker, so I used 1/2 the recipe to cover a pork butt and popped it into my slow cooker on high for about 6 hours.  I shredded the meat, pulled-pork style, removed the fat from the drippings and mixed it all into the meat.  My family enjoyed it a lot!
