This is my first review.  I saw that this had no reviews and couldn't understand why after I tried this.  Fantastic! Easy! I used regular musturd and all chicken broth since I had no wine.  The fennel came out so tender and full of flavor.  Thank you for the great recipe.

I have never been a fan of anise, so I was a little worried about this recipe, but WOW! The anise flavor tones down as the fennel cooks, and the wine, honey, and mustard seed make a marvelous sauce. I cooked the dish a little hotter than suggested (I was in a hurry) and the fennel sort of caramelized on the bottom of the pan. De-lish!

Hubby and I ate most of it with dinner last night, and I had the rest for breakfast this morning. We'll definitely be making it again!

The only down side... I now have a pile of fennel tops that I don't know what to do with. Guess it's time for more research!

Delicious, subtle fennel flavor! I boil rice in the leftover liquid after and serve the fennel on top. Yum!

I enjoyed the flavour of this dish, but cut the fennel into strips and tossed it in the other ingredients, then I sauteed it for about 15 minutes. It turned out well, and was an interesting change for me. Salmon and snap peas made for a healthful dinner. I would make this again, and maybe try with pine nuts?

Delicious and simple recipe. I used water because I didn't have broth, but it was still great. It's so nice to take a break from the more common veggies. Thanks!

Perfect recipe.  In the last 15 min or so, try adding in yellow squash.  They are great together, and when served with lightly spiced chickpeas, you've got a great meal.

YUMMY! I cut up my fennel, roasted my mustard seed first and then added the rest of the ingredients and....YUMMY...
the most interesting combination I could have come up with... a little sweet and savory. A winner.

I had to increase the heat to a simmer and extend the cooking time to make sure the fennel was tender, but this was delicious.

Very easy and good.  A nice change.  I used water instead of chicken broth, and I think using chicken broth will make it even better.  Also, next time I make this I'm going to crush the mustard seed or cook the mustard seed in the oil on high heat, then lower it and add everything else, to try and bring out the mustard flavor more.

The wine and honey balances out the licorice taste of the fennel.  It's a great recipe.  I scaled it down ONE fennel bulb for 2 people, used cooking sherry instead, and it was perfect.

I thought this was a good recipe for fennel. The flavor was really good. I used just a little bit less honey and a tiny bit more mustard.

I made this last night, approximately halving the recipe and it was really tasty.  I love fennel and this is a great (and easy) way to make it.  It was just as good today cold.

To shorten the cooking time, I sliced the fennel, added sliced yellow onions, and a little garlic and sauted it all in olive oil.  Then I added the chicken broth, wine, and the rest of the ingredients, and let it simmer.  It was ready in 20 minutes.  Delish!

This was very tasty and would make a great side dish for lamb or veal chops.  It was easy to prepare and I found that 1 large fennel bulb worked for the 2 of us.  I also substituted 1 tsp mustard for the seed.

I made this yesterday for dinner. The Fennel was smooth and tender but there wasn't that typical fennel aroma. I liked it very much. My wife said it tastes very good but she couldn't say if she liked it as she missed the usually strong fennel aroma with cooked fennel. I definetely will do it again. It's a great variety for fennel lovers. It could be also great for people who hate that typical fennel taste.

Tasted very good, I always wanted to try using this interesting bulb, but where in the recipe does it tell you what to do with the wine, should it be sipped as it's cooking? I did add it to the stock and honey mixture though.

This is my new favorite way to make fennel. I sub vegetable stock for chicken, as I am vegetarian. Even people who don't like fennel might like it this way.  I've already converted one person, myself.

awesome! Will make again and again!
I had no wine so I just used the other ingredients, and it was still excellent. I am excited to taste how great it will be with wine next time.
Thank you!!

This was wonderful!  I didn't have white wine, but I used dry sherry (don't use "cooking sherry", as it's loaded with salt and you  can find a good quality sherry that's good to drink for cooking.)  Like another reviewer, do make sure the cooking liquid is simmering or it will take longer than 45 minutes.  Thank you, shari p. for the recipe!

Not awful. Not great. We could all eat it, but none of us had any specific desire to do so. Like others, I had expected more flavor. Probably won't make again - thanks, though!

This turned out really nice.  I probably had to cook the fennel for 1.5 hours to get it really tender.  I kept adding a bit of chicken broth to the pan because the broth kept evaporating.  This is a very unique way to eat fennel!  Thanks

As my first foray into fennel, I was bummed. The recipe sounds delicious, smells divine while cooking, I was so anxious for a new taste and ... nothing. Bland. I was so disappointed.  I'll give fennel another try with a different recipe. Hopefully it's the cook not the recipe.

Very good dish. Easy too cook and inexpensive. Started trying "unique/different" vegetables after getting burned out on green beans and corn. The family liked it and was rated a "WILL COOK AGAIN".

I love this recipe! It has become one of my staple go-tos for a meal because it is so quick and flavourful! I usually make it as a side with my sherry bacon cream brussel sprouts and it is ALWAYS a winner! Also: I now use roasted mustard seed in almost all of my recipes, so thank you Winelover 813! And thanks to Shari P. for the wonderful recipe!

Excellent.  If you like fennel at all, you should try this.  It goes together with very little effort.

I don't know.  This just isn't that good.  It isn't BAD, either.  I used what I suspect is a too-wide saucepan and the liquid mainly evaporated out, leaving very bland fennel resting on some thick overcooked sauce that honestly isn't anything to write home about.  I would give it a three, but I'll go with a four to account for potential user error.  Word of caution - use a narrow saucepan so that your fennel gets to steep in the liquid for longer than mine did.

I followed the directions exactly but I just didn't think it had that much flavor. It was okay, but nothing great.

Followed the recipe exactly thought it was great!  Next time I may cut down on the cook time as I like my veggies to stay on the firm side.

I used the bulb and the stems for this. Maybe that was a mistake. Generally this didn't have a lot of flavor - I made it just as directed in the recipe. (and I LIKE fennel) I won't make this again.

I liked. David wasn't crazy about. Wouldn't want to eat all the time, but an interesting item to add to my overall diet.

This was my first attempt at cooking fennel.  This was a great recipe, but I did need to make some changes (lack of ingredients).  I omitted the chicken broth and white wine.  Instead, I added some water.  And I substituted some Dijon mustard for the mustard seeds.  I really liked the end result and will be keeping this recipe.

the taste was very subtle. but I'm sure it could be paired with a fish or some other lite meat when you are in the mood for a light but tasty meal. I give it a thumbs up. It was easy to prepare, just takes a long time to finish cooking.

I am giving the recipe 3 starts only because I was not particularly fond of it.  My boyfriend enjoyed it over rice.  I never ate fennel before and do not like licorice/anise so I am not surprised that I did not like it.  Easy to make but just not my cup of tea.

The dish was certainly tasty, and I liked it, but it wasn't a major hit on my dinner table. I think it's the fennel itself that was off-putting, not the recipe. I used regular mustard, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly, and I enjoyed the dish overall. I don't use fennel a lot, but with the right overall meal, I think this is a nice addition. Something to make now and then as a surprise side dish.

I would have to agree with "Danny Boy" on this one.  It wasn't terrible but I certainly did not think it was great, either.  After reading the rave reviews from others I decided to try this.  I have had roasted fennel before and liked it, but wanted to try a different preparation.  I used chicken broth and alcohol-free white wine for the liquid and sprinkled dry mustard powder on the fennel instead of mustard seed.  The fennel was certainly quite tender when done, but as "Danny" wrote, it didn't have much flavor to it.  I had hoped for something more spectacular esp after what I paid for the fennel bulbs!  Perhaps it would have been improved if I'd used real wine instead of the kind with no alcohol, but since others said they had made it using only broth I thought it would be OK.  I would have to say I was disappointed.
