I skipped the caraway seeds because I didn't have them. This was good, but greasy. My three boys ate it anyway in less than twenty minutes. The grease turned me off so I didn't eat more than a little spread on a Wheat Thin. I'll make it again for them, but next time, I'll break up a large loaf of pumpernickel or sourdough.

I've made this dip before and it was a hit!  My family makes hot ham a swiss sandwiches baked in the oven and this dip tastes just like them.  I did lessen the caraway seeds just a bit and had to use finely chopped regular onion, as I did not have green onions on hand.  This is also delicious after it's baked and served cold as a cheese spread.

This was very easy and great tasting.  I used cornbeef instead of ham and placed it inside a bowl made from rye bread.  Tasted just like a ruben sandwich.  Will be making this on again.

Great dip! I only used 1 tsp of caraway seeds & will probably only use 1/2 tsp next time.

I made this as an appetizer for Christmas dinner and everyone LOVED it.  There was hardly any left!  I left out the green onions and added more cheese and ham.  It was really easy to make too!

I did not have caraway seeds but followed the recipe other than that.  This is SO yummy and addictive.  It is a big greasy, but the flavor makes up for it.  My hubby doesn't like cheesy things typically buy couldn't stop eating this.  Great party food!

This dip was a hit.  Made exactly as written, but did only use about 3/4 tsp of the caraway seeds, and that was plenty.  Will make again for sure!!

Did not care for this at all. Very bland and greasy and people kept picking out the caraway seeds.

This is super yummy!  I used full fat mayo and left out the seeds but did get the Flipside crackers which I must state are awesome.  I bought the ham already cooked and diced since this was one of the quick meals I can make during busy weeks.  Although this is supposed to be an appetizer of sorts, we ate this for dinner instead!

this was really good when it was hot out of the oven but once it cooled down was too greasy for my taste. based on other reviews, i reduced the amount of caraway seeds to 1/2 teaspoon.

Ommited the caraway seeds, used 1 tablespoon of regular mustard, served on sour dough toast in lieu of crackers.  Very, very good.

This was really good, I have even made the dip and spread on wheat bread for hot ham and cheese sandwiches. My kids loved it.
