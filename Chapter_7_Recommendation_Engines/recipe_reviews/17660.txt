This is a yummy cake.  I processed the walnuts and orange together.  I also used currents instead of raisins, and left them whole.
A nice light cake.

Very easy good light cake. I used almonds instead of walnuts and topped with orange cream frosting instead of suggested topping even though I did pour some fresh juice over the top while the cake was still warm. I also used fresh mandarin oranges.

I used to make this recipe in the 1960s and rediscovered the recipe recently. It is one of my favorites and every one I've served it to loves it. You really need a food processer to grind the orange, raisins and nuts together.

Very nice orange flavor.  I used butter instead of shortening.  The orange juice and sugar topping put on the cake after baking makes it far too sweet for our taste.  Would make again with the sugar in the batter reduced to about two thirds of a cup.

This is a great cake full of lots of flavor, with the added benefit that my family of small kids believe that they have to kiss me to get a piece of cake!  Thanks for posting it.

This was good ,just not as falvourful as I had hoped. I used butter & 1/2 cup sugar. I think if it had orange /creamcheese icing this would add to the orange flavour??
I will make again & add the icing :)

My mother made this cake during the 1950's and 60's and she baked it in a 9x13 pan and frosted it with vanilla buttercream frosting. She used an old fashioned grinder, I use my cuisinart food processor-so easy!

Soooo good and very good orange flavor!  I've made this several times, and love it.  The only bad thing is the mess that the orange and raisin mixture makes in your blender.  And it becomes so thick and gooey that you have to keep mashing the mixture towards the blades.  A pain in the butt, to be sure.  But worth the effort.

I subbed coconut for walnuts, so take this review with a grain of salt. I thought the topping had too much cinnamon and the OJ made the cake soggy. I will try making the cake part, topped with an orange icing and garnish and report back.

This review is for the cake alone, without the glaze, nuts or raisins (allergies and raisin haters). 
Wonderful cake with a nice balance between moist and light. The cinnamon and orange work very nicely together. My father thought it was the best cake he'd ever eaten and, believe me, he knows sweets. I served it with the "Golden Orange Frosting" by Carol from this site.

Very easy and yummy, my family loved it! I used almonds instead of walnuts.
