I made a few changes, by deleting the peppers, doubling the spices and adding 1/8 tsp of BALSAMIC VINEGAR ,  which threw it over the top! And a little shake of celery seed! This is a great! recipe! Yum! And like every good cook, it improved with age! Make it a day or two ahead of time and it's a winner!

This  is  the  1st macaroni salad recipe, that did NOT call for vinegar, Dijon  mustard,  sugar, or pickle juice!    I don't like any of those, so this recipe works out better! To veganize/dairy/egg free, just use a vegan mayo,  I use apple juice, instead of  milk, it doubles as a sugar, to tone down the vinegar taste from the mayo. I hate vinegar,  and sugar, so the apple juice acts as a mild sweetener, to tone down any vinegar acidic taste, without being overly sweet.

This is the mild creamy recipe I have been looking for.  (Like the one I find at Sobey's.). The only change I made was using miracle whip instead of mayonnaise. I really enjoyed the subtle flavours and the crunch of the veggies which I diced into small pieces. I stirred everything together and left it overnight in the fridge and found the consistency perfect the next day - it stayed like that for three days in the fridge!  Thank you so very much for this

I  enjoyed this salad. I didn't have evaporated milk. I had sour cream and milk i used in place  with a bit of sugar.  Tasty. I used double amount of veggies.  Served it at a bbq and it was a hit.

I did not have all the veggies listed for this recipe, but wanted a savory macaroni side dish for a picnic supper.  Turned out that did not matter at all  This creamy, spicy dressing would have been delicious on just the macaroni.  Toss in whatever fresh vegetables you have on hand, diced small, and it'll be amazing.  YUM!!!

Hands down best recipe I’ve used. It takes some time, but so well worth it. I served it at a meeting I hosted and everyone asked for the recipe. They knew darn well this salad did kitty come from a store. I used this recipe and this one only for my macaroni salad.

I made this for our 4th of July party and it was a hit. I made it exactly as described and I don't like raw onions, but in they went. I don't like to see in the reviews someone saying it was or wasn't good after they say how many things They've changed. So I make it as is first and then if I want to tweak it, I will do that the next time, this doesn't need any tweaks. I even had several people ask me for the recipe. Also my youngest grandson who is a very picky eater came back for THIRDS!! So try it first the way it is written, you won't be disappointed!!

I made it exactly as the recipe specified.  Everyone liked it but some commented that it needed more seasoning.  Maybe next time I'll double those.  I thought the amount of dressing was sufficient, still very creamy the net day.

Best macaroni salad I have ever tasted. As a rule I don't eat macaroni salad because it is so bland.  Made it for a shared dinner with some friends and they loved it too. Made it again for a church supper. It disappeared fast.  I made the recipe exactly as written.  Thanks for this recipe.

I made this last night. We are serving it today but the taste test was delicious. I used red and yellow peppers because that's what I had. The dressing is delicious. I don't expect any leftovers.

I made this recipe. Didn't want to make 4 cups of macaroni though. Used 2 cups, enough for my husband and I. It's a sweet salad, truthfully. I am letting it chill and then I will try it.

Instead of carrots and celery I opted out because my family doesn't like those particular veg - but the peppers & onion work just great! I also added 3 teaspoons of sugar, substituted miracle whip for half the mayo and it literally tastes EXACTLY like the KFC pasta salad.  Was a hit at our BBQ!

When  cooking for a crowd, or using one box -16 oz pasta, then the mix is not enough to make it creamy. It is delicious, and we made some changes: we used about 1/4 cup of chopped olives, red onion, only had green bell pepper, 1 Tlbs olive juice, dash of celery seed, a third more of all the ingredients, &  used regular milk. I may have over used the paprika so be careful. This is wonderful-such a great crunch=even when it wasn't chilled cold, can't wait to taste it after in frig overnight. It will be our 4th of July salad.
