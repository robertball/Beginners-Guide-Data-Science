I was a little nervous about making this due to the lack of reviews, but I'm glad I gave it a chance. This was wonderful! The only things keeping it from 5-stars was the masa balls. I cooked them in the soup for a half hour or more, but they never really firmed up. My husband picked his out and gave them to me. I found that, after they were completely cool, they had firmed up.  I don't know how they would hold up upon reheating because we didn't have one drop left after dinner! Great recipe. I'll play with the balls a little to make them more firm (Oh, my goodness!)

I made this tonight. I used some rotisserie chicken and  added 1 cup of corn and didn't put the cheese in. I just added some to my bowl. My family liked it and I will make it again for sure. They even liked the masa balls.

I've made this twice, the first time with the masa balls, the 2nd time without. I like it better without. The 2nd time  I sprinkled tortilla strips on top which added that yummy corn flavor and also some nice texture. It's like enchiladas, but a soup, it's so delicious. It's a great meal for the cold months.

This was very fast. I used a whole can of enchilada sauce, a can of white meat chicken from Costco and 1 cup of Jiffy corn bread mix for the masa. I didn't add cheese to the soup only sprinkled a little on top for garnish.

My family loves this soup! It's requested all the time by my oldest. My kids love helping make the masa balls but love eating them even more! The only thing I do different was add a little heavy whipping cream in the end and I make it in a crock pot.

A fantastic recipe! I think it's best if the masa balls are made small, grape size or smaller. The next time I make this recipe, I will add some seasoning to the masa balls, like cilantro, onion/garlic powder... they were a little bland. But every other single component was dynamite! Using enchilada sauce as a soup/stew base is genius.

I took the other reviewers suggestions, and this soup was amazing! In addition to increasing the spices and adding corn for crunch, I omitted the chicken and substituted veggie broth since I'm vegetarian. The soup was so good I didn't feel it needed the cheese stirred in or even as a garnish (I did add a little half and half at the end). I took the time to make the yummy masa balls, but they're so similar to hominy corn in texture, I will use those next time instead to cut prep time. (I guess that would make it hominy soup not masa soup! ??) Regardless, this is one of the best soups I've ever made! I'm always happy to find great recipes I can easily convert to meat-free. Thank you for the great recipe!!!

This was a good recipe just as written.  As personal preference, I increased the amount of cumin and chili powder by half to add flavor.  You can control the heat level more by your choice of enchilada sauce.  I will say that making the masa balls is tedious!  I made them less than 1/2 inch in diameter and had no trouble with them cooking though.  Also, I rolled about 3/4 of the masa mix into balls and then sprinkled the last quarter in as a general thickener which made for a very good body for the soup.  I've taken it to a group event and it was well received.

Meh... I had better expectations but it was bland. I expected it to have a lot of flavor especially after the ingredient of Sour cream. But the sour cream is definitely not needed. After tasting it, we triad adding a hot taco sauce but that was not enough to make it “unbland.” This recipe kakes a hearty soup but not worth making again.

My whole family loved it, and it was pretty easy to make. We will definitely make this again. I especially loved the broth.

I followed the recipe as outlined, except for sauteing the onion and garlic first, then adding the rest of the ingredients (this way I only had to get one pot dirty).

I wasn't sure how large to make the masa balls, so I googled it. Another recipe recommended the balls be about 1-1/2 inches, which worked great, and they cooked up fine. 

Quick notes: the direction to add the shredded chicken isn't actually included. (I can totally imagine myself forgetting this step on busy nights, even though it's obviously meant to be added!) Also, we live in a very dry climate, and had to add more water to the masa ball mixture in order to be able to form the balls.

Thanks for the new favorite, Liz!
