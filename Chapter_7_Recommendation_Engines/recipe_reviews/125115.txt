Everyone loved this! Made it in a crockpot the first time and baked in oven the second time-both were great.

This is a great recipe. I make it in the slow cooker during the summer months to keep the heat level down in the kitchen. I make "chili" dogs using this stew. They taste extra yummy and the lima beans sneak in some unexpected nutritional value!

This is always a crowd pleaser and a great dish to take along.  I skip the white sugar and instead of ground beef/bacon I use a pound of spicey sausage.

These are my go-to hearty bean casserole.  Ive made this recipe--similar for years. Also called Calico Beans.  5 stars.

I am surprised this has so few reviews. I have never reviewed anything before so had to do this one.  I have been using this recipe since it was published many years ago and it has replaced any baked bean dish I have ever made.  A hit at any picnic or potluck.  Only changes I make or do not use the white sugar at all and cut back a little on brown since bbq sauce is also sweet.  Switch one of the pork n beans for a can of Bush's and no need to bake in oven, it is great right off the stove after cooking all of stuff together. One of my best finds on this site.  Thanks Donna for sharing.

This is a great, hearty bean dish. We do dutch oven cook-offs a few times a year, and this is always what I bring. It's the best version of BBQ beans I have tried. I don't modify the recipe at all--it's perfect as is!

I have been making this recipe now for quite awhile, and I have to say it is always a hit.  The only think that I change is to skip the white sugar and reduce brown sugar.  It is a bit to sweet otherwise.  Thanks for the awsome recipe Donna!

Not sure why it wasn't my fave but it just didn't do well in the family.  Hope everyone else has better luck with it.
