Basically good recipe, had to change some things though.  I used heavy cream instead of half n half, and added at least 1 cup shredded cheese at the end to thicken it up a little.  Also, I've had bad experiences with putting bacon in something and cooking it for a long time (turns back to mush!).  So I cooked the bacon, drained it on paper towel and refrigerated it.  I then sauteed the onions in the grease and added those in the beginning.  Then I used the crumbled bacon in the individual bowls when served.  You definetely have to add more spices, too...

I like this recipe, but like others I modified it some to better suit my family's tastes.  Almost seems a shame to review it based on my modifications because if I had all the ingredients on hand to make it as is, I am sure it would have been great as well.  That being said, I used 5 cups chicken broth instead of the broth/water mix, substituted black pepper and reduced dill to 1/8 tsp, substituted 2% milk for the half and half cream and omitted the evaporated milk altogether.  I also fried the bacon separately from the onion, sauteing the onion instead in olive oil with about a 1 c of carrots and a stalk of celery.  Then I added both the bacon and the vegetables to the slowcooker together for step 2.  I did also puree about 1/4 of the soup and about a 1/4 cup of potato flakes to thicken it some before step 3.  Family loved it, particularly the children. As far as cooking the bacon in the slowcooker for that amount of time, I didn't experience any problems as far as the soup being greasy or overpowered by the taste.  The bacon was soft though.  If you prefer crispy bacon in your soup definitely wait to add it.

I wasn't so sure this would be a four star recipe as I was making it, but it turned out well in the end.  I wish I had followed another reviewer's advice and fried the bacon first, then set it aside and sauteed the onions in the bacon grease.  Cooking them at the same time didn't work so well because the onions were done well before the bacon, leading to burned onions, which in turn led to brown soup.  Next time I'd add the onions at the beginning, but wait to serve the bacon with each individual bowl.  It gets soggy being in the broth.  I also had to bump up the slow cooker to high for awhile because the potatoes just weren't getting soft enough.  After I added the flour, half and half and evaporated milk, I expected the soup to get really thick and creamy, but it stayed pretty thin, even after adding more flour and bumping the slow cooker back up to high again.  So I transferred everything to a pot on the stove and cooked it at a little bit higher temperature, being careful not to boil it.  Even then, it never did get quite as thick as other potato soups I've had.  The flavor did turn out great, after adding more salt and dill weed.  My husband and I both really liked it, and it's not as fattening as other potato soups, especially using fat-free half and half and fat-free evaporated milk.  I'd make this recipe again, but I'd probably do it all on the stove instead of in the slow cooker.

This is a great recipe.  I used it when we did family poker night with my in-laws.  I followed other user suggestions and did not add the bacon until the very end and also substituted heavy cream for half and half.  I sauteed my onion in butter instead of bacon grease so there would not be brown flecks in my soup.  Also, we all added a generous spoonful of cheddar cheese before eating.  This is like a giant stuffed baked potato in a bowl!!!!  Everyone loved it and there were no leftovers!

I love potato soup and potato soup with bacon is heaven! I substitute milk for the cream because otherwise it seems so creamy it is like a white sauce instead of soup.

This made an excellent tasting soup. I didn't have condensed chicken broth, so I used 2 cans of non-condensed chicken broth + 1 chicken bouillon cube instead (still added the listed 2 cups of water). When the potatoes were done...blended some of them in the blender along with the flour and half-and-half mixture, and part of the evaporated milk. Then just put that back in the crockpot, along with the rest of the evaporated milk for 30 more minutes. Added a little more salt, pepper, onion and garlic powder to taste...and served with shredded cheddar and "Real Bacon Bits" in a jar, on the side. Also, wanted to speed it up a little, so cooked it for 3 hours on high, then 2 hours 20 minutes on Low in a 6-1/2 qt crockpot. Thanks for this great recipe Shirley! Will definitely be making it again.

This recipe is so great!  It's thick, creamy, and very filling.  I am going to halve the recipe next time for just two people.  I used the slow cooker for mine, with no problem... I even had it cooking on high for 3.5 hours without realizing it and thought I ruined it, but didn't thankfully.  I don't know why/how other people had runny, watery soup but I had no problem.  I didn't cook the onions beforehand, I just put them in the cooker raw.  I also didn't put in the bacon either, I saved it to garnish when we were ready to eat (I used ready-to-eat bacon which you can heat up in the microwave for however many you need/want - so convenient).  Also added shredded cheese as a garnish too.  I put a couple pinches of crushed red pepper flakes and a garlic clove minced to add more zing and flavor.  I used lowfat evaporated milk and regular half and half.  I also used reduced sodium chicken broth as well.  The grocery store didn't have large potatoes unbagged... so I used 8 red-skinned, medium-sized potatoes instead.  I also mashed half the potatoes as well before I added the creamy mixture.  Mm Mm Mm.  Thank you for sharing!  It was perfect for a cool, fall day!

A winter party hit!  I loved this soup!  It was creamy, and delicious - the bacon stays crispy and everyone at my party loved it.  I made it a second time in a much larger batch and realized it thickens nicely over the 30 minutes after adding the flour/cream combo so don't be too hasty  - adding more flour destroys its creamy consistancy and takes out some of the flavor

I was very pleased with this recipe!  It came out thick, creamy, and tasty!  I didn't have condensed chicken broth, so I used 21 ounces of chicken broth (from a carton) and one cup of water.  As it simmered away all day, I had to add 1/4 cup of water a few times because the liquid got too low.    Added the half and half, and evap. milk and turned it up to high for the last 30 minutes.  This thickened it up perfectly!  I took some reviewers' advice and cooked the onions after the bacon.  Saved some of the cooked bacon in the fridge for a garnish, and I also snipped a bunch of fresh chives to put on top.  Served with Fantastic Focaccia Bread from this site for dipping.  Soooo good!  A great comforting meal for a fall day!

This tasted good, but I was a little disappointed with the consistancy (only because I like potato soup to be thick).  I would suggest using baking or yukon gold potatoes rather than red.  Overall it was alright, I was just looking for something else.  Thank you Shirley.

Deliciously thick and creamy, just as I was hoping.  Thank you for the recipe!  I don't know why anyone would substitute heavy cream for the half and half, and I really don't understand the purpose of the evaporated milk (so I didn't use it).  I followed the recipe as a basic guide but did make some adjustments.  I'd list them all here but I know it can be annoying when other reviewers do that.  I'll just say the reason I didn't give it five stars is that it definitely needed more salt and pepper, the bacon is best added towards the end so it doesn't get limp, and using all stock rather than any water really enhances the flavor.  P.S.  A useful tip learned from Chef John of foodwishes.com ... mash some of the potatoes about halfway through the cooking time to release more starch and thicken the soup.

I was looking for a recipe for baked potato soup. It never occurred to me to start with raw potatoes and use the crock pot. I used most of a 5 lb. bag of plain old white potatoes (potato type is my guess as to why there are varied results). I cut them fairly small. I did add a heaping tablespoon of minced garlic to the onions when frying them in the bacon grease, and a bit of cayenne pepper. I cooked them on high for 3 1/2 hours and then added flour with 1% milk. That was all that was needed, it thickened up right away, no need to wait. The dill was a yummy addition, I wouldn't have thought of that. We served with cheddar and extra bacon in our bowls. Delicious! Definitely a keeper for us.

YUMMO!!!  My rendition of SCCPS:  Potatoes peeled, halved and cut into slices; 1/4 red onion (think I will use green onioins next time!); 4 cups of water; 3 chicken bullion cubes; 1 carrot, cut into small pieces; 1 celery stalk, cut into small pieces; Salt; Dillweed (my favorite part!); White Pepper; I put all of the above into the crock and cooked on low for 9 hours...got home, used my potato masher to mash everything in the crock....Added only 1 12oz can evaporated milk. Added bacon. Added about 1 cup of cheddar cheese. Wish I would of had some chives to garnish with...will get those for next time!  Did I mention this soup was yummo?!?  (I submitted my pic too...it's a lot creamier consistancy that the other pic)

Very good. I made it exactly as written.  I do feel that something is missing to give it a little more flavor, but I could not figure out what that might be.  It thickened up for me very well.  I did increase the temp on the crock pot for the last 30 minutes to help with the thickening.

Loved this recipe but did make one subsitution. Instead of flour I used Instant Potato flakes to thicken. I also saved some bacon for a garnish when serving.

Used heavy cream instead, used regular white onion and leeks cooked in bacon drippings, and added the bacon only as serving as a garnish so it would stay crispy.  Also blended it smooth (wish I'd left 1/2 of it chunky - next time...).  Very tasty.

This was delicious!  I used Better Than Bouillan with the amount of water and liquid in the chicken broth combined.  I did not add the bacon to the soup, but left it as a topper when dishing up.  Some bacon, sour cream, and cheddar cheese on top made this yum!

This is a FABULOUS soup! Things I did differntly: First I doubled the recipe and I added 3 stalks of chopped up celery, used skim milk instead of half and half cream, and I didn't cook the onions before hand. I also used the Hormel bacon pieces but did not put them in the crockpot...just put them on the side and let the family put their own in their soup. I absolutely LOVE the dill flavor and the evaporated milk made all the difference! I ahve made this a few times and will continue to make it! Thank you for the recipe!!! MMM MMM good!  OH, and I served it with cheddar cheese, bacon and broken up pieces of crusty bread...delicious!

YUMMY!  I've made this recipe several times and it's always great.  Even my extremely picky husband loves it.  Perfect on chilly nights.  I use regular chicken broth (I can never find condensed) though.  I substituted the half & half with heavy cream (richer) & I put the bacon on top.  I added shredded cheese too (personal taste).

Like some others, I also had to tweak this recipe. But after doing so, it turned out really good. First of all, I didn't cook my bacon and onions together. I did my bacon first and set it aside. Then cooked my onion in the drippings for just a minute or two to let them soak up the flavor. I did NOT drain the grease. (This southern girl never wastes good bacon drippings. Paula Dean would be proud.) To keep the bacon from getting soggy, I didn't add it until I added the cream.
Secondly, I read several complaints that it was too watery. So I only used 1 cup of water which took care of that problem.
Thirdly, I read several complaints of it being too bland. I added 2 stalks of celery and 2 cloves of garlic to the mix. I didn't use the dill because my hubby isn't a big fan.
After the taters got soft, I added the cream, then mashed them with a potato smasher and mixed them with a hand mixer (strongly recommended). At this point, you can taste-test it. I felt it was really bland and needed waaaay more salt. I didn't measure how much I used. I just kept putting more in there until it tasted right. Probably about 2 teaspoons. It needs more pepper too and I just used black pepper instead of white. I still felt it needed something so I added a little garlic powder and some onion flakes to the mix. Finally, I felt it was getting there, but that it needed more bacon!!
I cooked more bacon to crumble on top of each bowl just before serving (about one and a half pieces per person).

excellent.  i accidentally bought cream of chicken soup which gave it great flavor otherwise, i followed the recipe exactly and added more salt to my liking.  used turkey bacon.  at the end, i used a stick blender and creamed it a bit leaving small chunks.  next time i will add sausage for a full meal.

Love this slow cooker soup.  I followed the directions, cutting down on the onion due to family preference, and omitting the dill weed, since I am not a fan.  This was a great soup to come home to and perfect for the cold winter months.

Finally an amazing potato soup recipe! Have tried many others and they were just ok, until this one. I sauteed the bacon, removed the meat, and added chopped onion, carrot, and celery to the bacon grease. After cooking that for a while, I added it to the diced potatoes in the crockpot. Added chicken stock, water, salt and pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, red chili flake and dill. Also 2 cubes of buillon. 
Cooked on high for 4 1/2 hours. Took out about 1/2 of the soup, pureed it, then added it back in with the flour/water and evaporated milk. 30 more minutes and it was perfection. Topped bowls with chopped bacon and shredded cheese. Perfecto! Phenomenal!

I would leave out the broth, flour. You can mash 1/2 of the cook potatoes this is where it gets nice and thick, creamy. You can also use ham chucks instead of the bacon. Add garlic, seasoning salt, 1 TBSP butter on top, let it melt into the soup.

This recipe resembles the recipe that my husband grew up with, so I had to give it a try. My personal preference would be to add the bacon towards the end of the cooking process to decrease the smokey flavor of the soup, and cook the onions and garlic in butter instead.  I understand that this is a personal preference. I made it without the dill weed since I didn't have any on hand. I used chicken broth made from bouillion cubes, I am thinking that this probably gave the soup more flavor then a canned chicken broth would, since some reviewers are saying it is bland. Mine was far from bland. To decrease preparation time, I cooked potatoes on top of stove and transferred to slow cooker to complete the cooking process. I would suggest turning the slow cooker up to high when adding the flour and milk mixture, vent cover of slow cooker to quicken thickening process, I increased the flour to 3/4 cup since I like a thicker consistency. It will thicken, just give it time. The result was perfect. Season soup to taste, I added garlic pepper to mine. Taste test and add your seasonings accordingly. Individual servings were topped with grated cheese and bacon pieces. I am happy to be adding this recipe to my collection. Thanks for sharing.

I made this soup yesterday as my husband and I have had colds for a few days now. We both loved it! The bacon gives great flavor to this recipe and it is thick almost like a chowder, I will make this recipe again for sure!

This is now a new family favorite :)! The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I had mad a  few slight changes such as instead of dill weed I used basil, black pepper instead of white, I used bacon bits to garnish instead of bacon(works just as well but doesn't end up as soggy) and I added garlic powder and crushed red pepper. Whatever you do, do NOT add the bacon to the slow cooker because it will turn the bacon into mush. Trust me I found that out the hard way ha

We LOVE this recipe! We've tried it twice now. I use all stock, and only add water near the end of the cooking time if necessary. I also used whipping creme, as that's what was in my fridge. Delicious! Oh, and I added a couple of carrots this 2nd time. Just made for a heartier soup. Even my kids love it. Definitely a keeper!

This is a great tasty recipe.  I only had 3 slices of bacon, lol.  I never have half and half in my home but I did have alot of skim milk thats due to expire tomorrow. So I used that instead of the half and half and did the low fat evaporated milk.  Also used low sodium chicken broth and added a wee bit more salt. Since I made this late in the afternoon, I had this on high for 4 hours, then 30 for the last 30 minutes.  Top this with a little cheddar and green onions, soooo good!

great recipe!! I made a few changes...I saved bacon until the end and I just put onion in the crockpot with the potatoes to cook. Left out white pepper since I couldn't seem to be able to find it anywhere. Cooked on high for 5 hours...great consistency!  Added cheese and bacon to serve and delicious!!!!!

I enjoyed making this in the crock pot because it made life so much easier. :) I think the problem many people are having with thinness is the size of the potato. Some of the reviewers claim to be experienced. An experienced cook knows to cut back the amount of liquids depending on the size of the potatoes, correct? Just a thought. :) I used 3 large Idaho potatoes. I used 1 cup of water and 16 ounces of broth (AKA chicken bouillon in my house). I filled a bowl with 1.5 cups of half and half and 12 ounces of milk. I used the majority of it depending on the thickness I personally wanted. I was too tired to cut up onions, so I used onion powder. I also did the same with the bacon as other reviews stated. Topped with cheese and sour cream and bravo!

This is a great soup but I did change it a little, I used stock in place of the water and used heavy cream in place of the half and half.  I did take a lot longer than the 30 minutes to thicken but that may be down to useing thick cream.  As I needed to save time, I did use the pre-cooked bacon that i added with cheese once served.  tthis really was a great filling soup, perfect for these snowy winter days.

Loved this recipe. I took the advice of others and saved the bacon until the end. I used a 32 oz box of chicken broth and the amount of liquid was perfect. I also used fat free half and half and it was thick and rich tasting.

Good started recipe but could use some more flavor. I added mushrooms and carrots along with the potatoes and put in the slow cooker for about 6.5hrs. Added the flour and milk (used in place of half and half) and this didn't thicken up very well, added some instant mashed potatoes too. Found this to be pretty bland so added some additional spices, mustard powder, smoked paprika, onion powder, garlic salt and terrigon. Also added 4 oz. of Velvetta cheese. Tasted much better! Served with crumbled bacon (didn't add to slow cooker), sour cream and shredded sharp cheddar. Love that this recipe is for the crockpot, but definetly need's some tweaking.

Like a lot of other people I made some changes. I used light cream instead of half n half and used fat free evaporated milk.  I halved the recipe and added about 1 stalk of celery.  I also added the bacon and cheddar cheese at the end.  Very tasty.

I did make a few changes to this recipe. Like other reviewers had suggested, I also added 6 strips of bacon at the very end (along with 1 Tbsp. chives and 1 cup of grated cheddar). Lastly, I prepared bacon and cheese for people to add to their individual bowls as a garnish. Great recipe to work from. I thought it was a perfect consistency.

I made this for my family christmas party, used half the bacon in cooker fried up the rest to put on top with a bowl full of chives, cheddar cheese and sour cream. No one stopped talking about the soup ALL day! In fact almost every single person has asked for the recipe. IT WAS OUTSTANDING!!!! The dill is the secret ingredient!

This was really good. I don't know what happened to those who thought theirs was too thin-mine was almost too thick. I will have to thin the leftovers.I browned the bacon, then cooked leeks in the bacon grease. I added the leeks along with the bacon grease, keeping the bacon out to add when I served it. I also used fat-free half-and-half.I also used a box of chicken broth instead of the concentrate and water.

This recipe was LOVELY.

I added a couple more potatoes in my slow cooker because there really wasn't 
enough, as my cooker is pretty big.I also used Yukon Gold potatoes. I added in the condensed milk and found the taste to be pretty rich on it's own without the cream so I bypassed the cream altogether. Plus, I didn't want to thin out the soup as we like it heartier. I added in a drained can of sweet whole kernel corn to stretch it out a bit and 4 oz. of colby/jack cheese. Really close in flavor to Safeway's potato soup. I really would have never thought to use evaporated milk
but now that I have, I'll never go back 
to using regular milk again.

I won't go back to using hashbrowns in my crockpot soup ever again. Fabulous recipe!

Shirley thank you for sharing this recipe!  I made this yesterday in my crockpot.  It simmered all day while I worked in the yard.  I followed your recipe except I used heavy whipping cream, ommitted the dill and added 6 oz. of cubed ham during the last hour of cooking.  I garnished with some shredded cheddar cheese and served with toasted garlic bread.  My husband loved it and so did my picky 9 year old son.  The soup turned out thick, rich and flavorful!  This recipe is going into my "yummy" recipe file and not too many make it into my file of keepers.  Thank you for a truely wonderful recipe!  Barbi

Four changes I made.  First cook the bacon to extra crispy and then let cool.  use a kitchen knife and turn it to "dust-bits" before putting it in the crock pot. This will get rid of the bad mouth feel that boiled bacon has.
Second replace the water with Guinness beer. and add a cup of shredded super sharp white cheddar to the pot.  Lastly get rid of the Half and Half and use heavy whipping cream.

You end up with a Irish cheddar potato soup that is too addictive to stop eating.

Note: the beer addition works better with sage instead of Dill for the spice.

The key to this recipe, I think, is blending or mashing some of the potatoes  once you are ready to add the half and half, flour, and evaporated milk. I did this and it came out extremely thick and creamy, I didn't even use the evaporated milk. Mine was a chowder consistency and very delicious. I also added the bacon at the end, and a little black pepper in addition to the dill, salt, and white pepper.

My whole family really liked this soup, but it really is a bit bland.  So, like many others, I made a few changes-- 1) I used leftover ham instead of bacon  2) used fat-free evaporated milk 3) used fat free half & half  4) I added garlic salt (this step helped enhance the flavor tremendously!) 
5) I made a roux out of the flour and half & half before adding it to the soup at the end.  All turned out a bit healthier, much tastier, potato soup!

Very good recipe.  I did use twice the bacon and I mashed some of the potatoes at the end and mixed with the cream for the last 30 minutes.  Will definitely make this again.

Excellent soup.  I've tried a little variation by using Italian sausage finely chopped and it's awesome as well.  I love the creaminess.

Cooked the bacon separately and used vegetable broth (to make vegetarian).  I kind of mashed the potatoes after they were cooked.  It was good!

Very good soup! Made it with my boyfriend for us and his father and they both had seconds! Added 12 slices of American cheese - Next time considering using cheddar cheese and heavy cream to thicken.

I thought this was just ok.... I thought the half and half flour mixture kind of made this a bit bland. Next time I'll use a bit more seasoning.

As other reviewers suggested, I browned my bacon, set is aside, and then browned my onion in the bacon grease. I then reserved the bacon for use as a topping as I prefer crispy bacon. Other than that, I followed the recipe as written. I did feel it needed about one more teaspoon of salt and another half teaspoon of pepper. Otherwise, very good. Thanks!

This recipe was delicious. My girls love eating the potato soup at Fatz so I was determined to find a good recipe. I had 3 changes from the suggestion of other reviewers: I used heavy cream instead of half and half, I used packaged bacon bits/pieces and added them to our individual serving bowls instead of cooking bacon and putting them in the crock pot since someone said the bacon became soggy in the crock pot and I added about 1/4 c of instant potato flakes at the end to thicken it a little more. Everyone loved it and came back for more. No one ate the dinner I prepared because they were full from the soup.

This is a great base recipe for potato soup, but I did modify it to my family's personal liking. I use yukon gold potatoes, and leave off the condensed milk, I don't think it needs it. I also add a rib of celery, and some celery salt, garlic powder, a bay leaf, and a little sage. The consistency comes out fabulous. I had never made potato soup before finding this recipe and now I cant make it enough!

I made this for my sons elementary schools International Night and it was a BIG hit!!! I made it without the bacon and just put the onion in the crockpot with everything else. I used all chicken broth instead of water. Also I didn't have any evaporated milk but it turned out great without it! This is my new favorite soup!!!

I omitted the bacon and used vegetable broth to make it vegetarian. I added 1/2 tsp liquid smoke, and broccoli and garnished with shredded cheddar. Very tasty.

Egh. I thought the can of milk was unnecessary and made the soup too rich. I brought it to my grandmas for dinner and they made me take the leftovers home. Nobody wanted them. Next time, no can of milk. I will try it at least one more time and maybe change my rating depending on how it turns out. Maybe 2nd time is the charm?

Hey all! This was a wonderful soup. Quite easy to make also. I used 7 potatoes - we like our soup hearty. I would suggest either longer cook time or maybe cook on high for 4 hours and low for 2 or 3. Potatoes were a bit hard still after 7 hours on low. Served in bread bowls- YUM!

Great recipe, delicious soup. I changed some things for personal preference, but I don't think it's fair to doc stars...if I made changes for my personal taste. Used 2% milk instead of cream to cut down fat.  Added carrots for extra veggies.  Didn't put the bacon bits in until it was served, as suggested by others, it stayed nice and crispy. To make up for the fat avoided by using milk, added a bag of cheddar cheese. ; )

This ended up being better than I expected.  I did change a few things, of course.  First, I did not pre-cook the bacon.  I had the already cooked bacon that you just microwave, so when I served the soup, I had a side bowl of crumbled bacon, green onions and shredded cheese for those who chose to top their soup.  Second, I did not pre-cook the onions because after being in a crock pot for seven hours, they are plenty tender.  It's just a wasted step in my opinion.  I didn't have condensed broth, but did have two 14 oz cans of regular chicken broth, so I used those and didn't add any water at all.  It cooked all day and 30 minutes after adding the cream/flour and evaporated milk, it was very bland.  I then added 2 tsp of salt and 1/8 tsp black pepper.  That was all it needed.  Very tasty after that.  But as is, the recipe needs more flavor.

Four stars as written, five with modifications!  This is a good base, it just needs some more flavor.  As previously suggested, I cooked the bacon and removed then cooked the onion in the bacon drippings.  I then cooked the soup on the stove following recipe directions (took about 45 min stove-top).  When the soup was done, I tasted it and it was VERY bland.  I added 2 tsp chicken buillon granules and a liberal dash of salt.  I also added some red pepper flakes and about a cup of shredded cheeses.  I let the soup chill all day then warmed for dinner and it was SO GOOD!  I mashed up the potatoes a bit with a potatoe masher before serving.  A nice and thick soup!  Note:  This also works well if you use skim milk - still very thick and creamy!

I made this recipe yesterday and it was AWESOME. We had the leftovers tonite and it was even better. My husband went back for seconds and thirds! I added some italian spices (personal preference). I dont understand why some people change a recipe and then give it a poor preview. All I have to say is that I will make this recipe over and over again. Its a basic recipe that leaves alot of room for play.

This soup is delicious!  I did make a couple of minor changes.  I substituted leeks for the onions (in my book, leeks are a "must" for potato soup!)  I stirred in some leftover mashed potatoes toward the end of the cooking time, and mashed the chunks up somewhat--that made for a creamier soup.  It was also pretty thick, so I added the cream and milk without any flour.  Even my teenagers went back for seconds!

The batch I made had fatty pieces of bacon in it.  You definitely need to cook the bacon all the way through before adding the onion or the onion will burn before the bacon is fully cooked.  Otherwise it was pretty good.

This was my first time making potato soup and it was fabulous!  My husband normally hates cream-based soups and he ate 2 helpings!  I used heavy whipping cream instead of the half-and-half to make it a little thicker.  Excellent soup, I'll be using this recipe often!

This is the best soup recipe I've ever tasted.  I've never made a creamy soup before.  My family went wild over it.  I will definitely be making this on a regular basis during the fall and winter.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe, Shirley.

Enjoyed the soup, very creamy. But a little runny for me. I will adjust the flour amount next time. My daughter loved it, she had 2 helpings.

I had just got all four of my wisdom teeth out and decided to make this the day after, what a great decision that was. The taste was absolutely divine and it was soft enough for me to eat without using my molars. I cooked the bacon for a shorter amount of time so it was fully cooked yet soft enough to eat. I also let the soup cook for 8 hours on low so that the potatoes were a little mushy so I could just use my front teeth to eat it. It was full of taste and the wonderful fragrance wafted through my home. Loved it so much that I will be adding it to my repertoire. Highly recommended regardless if you need something soft to eat or if you want something amazing.

Such a great recipe! Super easy and delicious. I made this for a potluck and not a drop was left. I made it pretty much the same as the recipe calls for except I used boxed broth and regular cream.

This is delicious! New family fave! I added carrots. I added the onion straight to the crock. Cooked the bacon before, threw in at the end. I also use heavy cream. I think this might have made the difference in the lack of thickness some people complained about. Bravo!

This was a great recipe to start with,  but I always have to change some things to adapt it to a large family.  I did cook the onion with the bacon, but it made my soup very greasy so I will cook it separately next time.  I also added celery to the onion. I also added some parsley.  Before I put the broth in the crock pot I sprinkled the flour over the potatoes.  Still added the half and half at the end.  The soup was extremely think. So I added more chicken broth to thin it. This soup was delicious,  and quickly disappeared.

I made this tonight for my husband. He had a great bowl when he went out for lunch sometime last week and he wanted me to replicate it. I changed a few ingredients only because I didn't have them. Instead of condensed broth, I used two cans of regular chicken broth, instead of the half & half I used heavy cream ( my husband brought it), I also used celery salt instead of the regular salt. I didn't have evaporated milk so I used regular milk instead. I added the bacon in towards the end (as others have suggested) & cooked my onions in butter instead of the bacon drippings. I used turkey bacon instead of pork bacon. I wanted a little more of a smoke flavor so I added 1/2 tsp of liquid smoke. Lastly, I added 1 1/2 cup of cheddar cheese to the soup once it was complete.  Oh and I cooked it on high for 5 hours instead of low for 6/7 hours. My husband was delighted with the end result!

Pretty darn good and I would make it again. I made a few changes. I used slightly more chicken broth than water, substituted one cup of half & half with whole milk, used heavy cream instead of condensed milk (1 cup), and added the bacon before serving.

I'm rating this 4 stars because I made modifications to it. I did not add the water, instead I increased the amount of chicken broth by a half a can. Also, instead of using fresh onions, because I did not have any, I used a packet of Lipton Onion Soup Mix. Like many others I cooked my bacon at the end and used it as a topping. Oh and one more thing, I used heavy whipping cream instead of half and half, fresh dill, and additional seasonings to suit my palate. It was yummy!

This is a very good recipe and very easy to make. Because it does not mention various spices, it is a great stand alone recipe -OR- You can use it as a base to make the soup even spicier. We are glad that we read some of the reviews ... some of the changes that we made - (1) added a few dashes of cayenne pepper when sauteing the onions, (2) placed about half of the bacon in the soup, left the remainder for toppings, (3) pureed some potatoes with one can of evaporated milk and the flour, and (4) used milk & 3 tablespoons of corn starch instead of half-and-half.

Sorry but I did change this quite a bit due to what I had on hand & preference.  First off, I do not like soft bacon so I just put some bacon bits on the side for people to top off the soup.  I didn't pre-cook the onions, just threw them in with a tbsp of butter.  Didn't have condensed broth so I put in 1 can of condensed chicken soup with herbs & 4 cups of chicken broth (omitting the water).  I think I could have gotten away with 3 cups, maybe less.  My potatoes were quite small, so I used 10.  After reading reviews & looking at the pictures I was worried about this being watery (we like our potato soup thick).  So I used an emulsion blender just a little bit (still wanted chunks) before adding the milk (I used whole milk instead of 1/2 & 1/2 and I only added 1 cup milk + the flour + evaporated milk & it was plenty) - but the milk mixture thickened up the soup immediately so I think that was probably an unnecessary step.  I also threw in a cup of shredded cheddar & one slice of American cheese.

I doubled the recipe, added a block of cream cheese, a bunch of cheddar, used half half n half and half milk and no evaporated milk.
I let it cool a bit and put it in the blender. It was fantastic!

A very satisfying soup, once it is adjusted for seasonings. I, like most of the reviewers, made some changes. I fried the bacon, set it aside, then sauteed 1 very large onion, diced, in the drippings, and when the onion was softened, I added two large cloves of garlic, put through a garlic press, and sauteed for less than a minute. I made the soup on the stove and omitted the water and just used chicken broth. I made the soup on the stove only because I wanted soup sooner rather than later. I used about half of a 5lb bag of Yukon Gold potatoes and used more salt and black pepper and the suggested dill (I increased this a bit). I had the lid on the soup as it simmered, then used my immersion blender to blend everything. I added half and half until I had the consistency I wanted, added 1 package of shredded sharp cheddar cheese, some fresh grated Parm cheese, stirred everything together, topped with the crispy bacon and some more shredded cheese and enjoyed. Once the flavors are adjusted, this is one very good soup. My favorite potato soup is sstill Emeril's potato, bacon, and Roquefort soup--that one is to die for!

I read through the reviews before making this. I like that you can cut back the serving size on allrecipes so I changed it to four. 

Some of my changes: 

I didn't have an actual onion so I used 2 tspn onion, used 6 strips of bacon (I like bacon! I also figured it'd give it flavor), but didn't add it in the beginning. I added it in at the end in the last half hour phase. I didn't have Dill or white pepper so I used black pepper and 1/4 tspn celery seed. 

Before adding the last three ingredients in the last half hour (which I think I actually left on for an hour) I took out some of the potatoes and mashed them. I like a chunky potato soup, so how much you mash is up to you. It was lacking some flavor to me so I looked through my spices and added another 1/4 tspn of Thyme, Paprika, Oregano and Celery Seed. Oddly enough I also threw in 1/2 tspn of turkey gravy powder mix. 

I also played around with the liquid - I used less water and more chicken broth. I figured that it would get more flavor. I didn't want to open up another carton of cream (I had 8 oz and it called for 10 oz for my amount) so I used more evaporated milk since I had some left over (4 servings calls for appoximately 7 oz of evaporated milk and the can was 12 oz).

I topped it with a shredded "Mexican" cheese blend, sour cream and real bacon bits.

Kudos to the original recipe - it's a great base!

Cooked the bacon in the oven at 400 until it was done, let it cool, then broke it up into pieces. I added this to the soup about half-way through cooking. SO yummy!

I thought the soup had a great taste.  I had no problem with it thickening, but I did have to transfer to the stove after adding the flour because of a timing issue for dinner.

Pretty decent.  Make sure to use milk or evaporated milk and not buttermilk or sour creme because otherwise it will turn out more like mashed potatoes.  It definitely needs something sweet and not sour.

Gotta do it, 5 STARS!!!!!  O. M. Gosh.  Creamiest, homiest, mouth watering.  Use stock (hopefully make your own, from turkey bones!)
ok, ok, ok.  I USED HALF AND HALF AND NON FAT.
Don't have anyone talk to you while you eat this, it's worth savoring!

We wanted to prep the night before, so to the crock pot bowl, we added diced russet potatoes, a sliced bunch of leeks, and broth to cover completely (along with the evaporated milk that was mistakelny added).  Refrigerated it covered overnight (read that this was ok to do) and next morning set it in the base and cooked it for 9 hours on low (added 1 hour to compensate for the refrigeration)  We came home from work and it was inedible.  The potatoes were firm and did not soften even after simmering on the stovetop for quite some time?!  wierd!!  I'm giving it  afour so as to not taint its results bc i am sure it was something that i did since others did not have this problem.

This was Awesome! I cooked a whole pack of bacon and towards the end of  cooking the bacon I added the onions. I chopped up all of the bacon and added to crock pot. I also added 2 cups of shredded cheese to cook during the last 30 minutes. I will be cooking this again. My 8 year old son loved it.

I made this recipe for me and my husband...can you say 'in love.'  I had no problems with thickness.  I modified the recipe slightly...I didn't have condensed broth so I followed another reviewers suggestion and used low sodium broth.  I also used black pepper, instead of white.  I added chili pepper, garlic powder and dried green onions.  I did not add bacon at all - had some frozen leftover ham from Christmas that I added after three hours of slow cooking.  Once it finished and I had served up two bowls for hubby and me, I added shredded Smoked Gouda on top of each bowlful.  Yummy!!!!

We loved the consistancy of the recipe.  I made a few changes with all chicken broth and no water.  I also use 16 oz cubed ham, chopped carrots and celery for a vegetable instead of bacon.

This was yummy!  Creamy, thick and yummy.  I followed the recipe, but I felt it could have used more salt.  I did cook it in the crockpot, but finished it on the stove (adding the flour/half-n-half/evap. milk). I felt I could control the temp and thickening better on the stove.  My whole family loved it and I will be making it again.

I will not make this recipe again. It was very bland...not very flavorful. I was very disappointed. My one recommendation for those of you who still want to make it is to add the bacon at the end, in your individual bowls. If you follow the recipe, it is crispy when you add it, but in the soup all day it is soggy when you eat it.

We really liked this soup - we had it for days and were still happy.  Though, I did not put in the dill (personal preference).  We had to add quite a bit of salt though and going forward I'll be putting in more potatos and probably some brocolli and cheese is a DEFINATE!

This was awesome.  Since I only added 1 cup of water (well, really chicken broth), I didn't need the extra flour or fluid at the end.  The potato's natural starch plus minimal liquid created a chowder consistency...my preference.  Remember, crock pots seal in moisture, so it might seem like there's not enough liquid at first, but give it time.

This was fantastic, although I did alter quite a bit.  I used turkey bacon instead of regular bacon, and fat free evaporated milk.  I did not add white pepper or dried dill weed.  Instead I bought one of those baked potato four cheese seasoning mixes and added it in with the water and chicken broth.  I didn't measure out the salt, I just tasted and added to my liking.  It's amazing how thick and creamy and rich this soup was.  My boyfriend and I were stuffed after one bowl!  We topped ours with a spoonful of sour cream and a handful of sharp cheddar cheese!  Yum!  I definitely recommend this recipe, and don't be afraid to add your own spin to it! :)

So easy, and so good!! I tried fat free half & Half to make this a little more diet-friendly, and it works wonderfully! And this will make a wonderful cream base for any kind of soup- aspargus, spinach, etc. Added ham to make this a dinner soup, and there wasn't any left! Thank you!

I followed the recipe fairly closely and really enjoyed it.  I would recommend cooking and serving the bacon separately.  Also, up the seasonings!  The cook time was a little on the short side.  I cooked mine for 9 hours and the potatoes were firmer than we'd prefer.  Tasty, but it wouldn't hurt to cook on high for a bit.  Thanks Rozanrenee!

This had good flavor.  I'm not a big bacon fan but did cook the onions with it and then only used the onions in the crockpot.  I added a package of diced ham instead.

Great recipe and makes a LOT! I was able to get away without stirring it occasionally, as I left it to cook while I was at work for the day. I will add a bit more bacon next time as well.

I made this soup for the 1st time & it was fabulous!!!!  My husband and daughter loved it, I did a little tweaking to the recipe.  I added a little extra seasoning to taste & 2 cups of cheddar cheese right before serving and this was a hit for us. This is a great soup to have over the holidays. Had some left over and froze the leftover.

This soup turned out wonderful with a couple of changes... Therefore, I'm only giving it 4 stars. Instead of the water/broth mix, I used all broth. Also, I substituted a can of cream of celery soup instead of the evaporated milk, since it's what I had. Gave it a little more creamy texture and flavor than I think it would have had otherwise. I see a lot of complaints about it being too thin... If that's the case, once it's done take a cup or two out and blend it in the blender. Pour it back into the soup and it will help thicken it up.

Pretty good potato soup and very easy.  It made quite a bit and since I'm the only person who eats potato soup at my house, too much for me.  Wonder if it can be frozen?

This was a great base for a quick after Sunday morning church services meal! I did add carrots and celery to the crock and omitted the bacon (but used bacon grease to saute the onion). While the soup was thickening for the last 30 minutes, I threw some broccoli florets on a baking sheet, sprayed with nonstick canola spray, salted, and roasted on 350 for about 12 minutes. At the meal, we added the broccoli and cheddar cheese to the soup bowl. Yum. We'll be making this frequently.

this was very yummy....add salt to taste...also added extra dill weed.  i used turkey bacon just as a topping like other people had suggested. we ate it a couple days after we made it and by then it had thickened up.  substitute the flour for cornstarch (see directions on can) and that should help.

I don't know if my crock pot was just too small for this, but I followed the recipe exactly and it was a watery soupy mess after 8 hours.  This didn't thicken for me at all.  The taste would have been fine had it thickened but I wouldn't consider this "creamy" in the least.  Disappointing since it was supposed to be dinner and I ended up at McDonald's instead.

My family really liked this soup, it is a nice basic recipe, I did add about a tablespoon or more of extra chicken boullion for more flavor and like other reviewers I added the bacon as a garnish and not as a part of the soup. came out very good.

I love this recipe because it's so versatile.  Tonight I used Thyme and red onions/yellow onions and taco cheese blend and it was delicious!  I also agree with most of the people, putting the bacon in last is the way to go to keep it crispy.  I also took half of the soup and blended it to make it a bit thicker which worked great!  Excellent recipe, i will definitely use this as a base to my other soups!

SOOO good! Turned out perfect. I only had 1 can of evaporated milk (5ozs.)and used Fat Free Half and Half and it still turned out rich and creamy. Some of the bacon did get a bit mushy so I ended up just sprinkling most of it on the soup at the end.

Well I made this soup for dinner yesterday and for the most part, I followed the directions. I did deviate slightly from the recipe though, so here's what I did.  The night before, I sauteed the onions (no bacon) and added to the slow cooker along with the potatoes, broth and spices.  I popped this in the fridge and turned it on low early the next morning.  I got home 9.5 hours later and was shocked that my potatoes weren't quite cooked!  So I turned the cooker up to high and added the remaining ingredients.  I only used 1 cup of half and half (other reviewers complained of the soup being too thin) and before I added this mixture, I microwaved it to heat it up so that my potatoes would continue to cook.  We added bacon and cheese to the soup once we started eating.  The end result was a really thick (almost pasty) soup which definitely needed additional liquid.  It was ok - but was remarkably better the next day.  I will probably make this soup again, but only because it's quick and convenient (there are other soup recipes we like more!)

This was pretty good, but I've tasted much better.  It just seemed to taste a little flat to me.

This is a great, thick, comforting soup. My kids loved it. Next time I'll dice the potatoes a little smaller, though; I had to mash them when the soup was done cooking!

This is a great soup recipe - very thick! I ended up blending some of the potatoes with a hand blender before adding the cream/flour mixture near the end and I think that made it even thicker!!! I used thick cut bacon and it worked out nicely!

I really enjoyed this recipe, it was wonderful for dinner on a cold day. When I added the flour and half and half I took a stick blender to the pot to eliminate any lumps from the flour and to break down some of the potatoes. I left some chunky potato pieces, just pulsed it a few times. Made for a wonderfully thick and creamy soup. Instead of adding the bacon at the beginning I set it aside and let people top their bowls with crumbled bacon and shredded sharp cheddar cheese. 

Thumbs up from this household!

We enjoy this soup very much; comfort food!  I followed the suggestions of some of the other reviewers and cooked the bacon separately from the onion. I also add minced garlic, bay leaves, chopped carrots, and sometimes, sliced, smoked sausage  Also, I had to cook on high for two hours to get the potatoes to soften enough, but I think that's because my crock pot is so old.  Thanks for a great recipe, Shirley, it has become one of our favorites

This is probably the best potato soup I have ever made.  It is so creamy, it makes your mouth water.  I did increase the amount of bacon, left out the dill weed, and added a large amount of cheddar cheese.  I also increased the amount of condensed chicken broth due to the addition of the cheese.  Even my husband loved it and he HATES soup except chile.  The prep time was a bit longer than described but well worth the effort.

Prep time took about 20 mintues.  Easy to make, not a lot of ingredients.  I added cheddar cheese on top at the end.  We loved it.  Would definately make again.

Very savory.  I used a tbsp of heavy whipping cream and about a c. of lowfat milk because thats what i had on hand.  I skipped the flour, as it was quite thick enough.  Also, being a non-pork eater, instead of bacon i cooked the onions in 2tbsp of butter with delicious results!  Thanks for sharing a delectable recipe.

Not too sure about this recipe.  I'm making this right now and the bacon just looks very mushy.  The instructions were poor, yet I followed them.  I should have made this my way and just skipped the bacon in the recipe.

I'm back to say, I just tried this soup and it indeed was the best  Potato Soup I've had in quite  some time!

Loved this recipe. Followed the ingredients to the letter with the addition of a little onion powder and garlic powder, and a couple of finely chopped carrots. However I changed the method a bit. As some have said, I cooked the bacon first, then fried the onions in some of the bacon fat. Only added half of the bacon to the crock pot. Saved the rest for garnish. Cooked on high for one hour, then low for 4. I took about a third of the soup out and pureed it with an immersion blender. Added it back in. To speed things up a bit, I whisked the flour into the half and half and milk on the stove. When it just started to thicken, I added it to the soup. Cooked another half hour. Added 4 oz. of cubed Velveeta right at the end, I like Velveeta in soups because it melts smoothly and doesn't break or make the soup greasy. Very thick and creamy. Garnished with fresh dill. Will definitely make again.

This is delicious.  The dill adds a nice flavor.  I wish the recipe would say how many pounds of potatoes though instead of '5'.  Potatoes come in such a variety of sizes.  I didn't add any water to mine while it was cooking and there was plenty of liquid .  My potatoes were a little smaller perhaps and there was enough broth to cover them completely when they were put in the slow cooker. The soup came out thick but I added some water when it was time to reheat it just to loosen it up a little.

Tastes great!  Easy to make from ingredients usually on hand.  We named it Unclam Chowder.  I added a can of corn  and little extra bacon, and a little bit of black pepper.  Serve with Rosemary and Sea Salt bread, and baby greens salad...makes a nice meal after getting pumpkins from the pumpkin patch in the fall!

This soup was absolutely delicious!  I used 2 russets and 2 sweet potatoes (there was not enough room in my crockpot for 5 potatoes!).  I would probably add a little more bacon next time, but the flavor was perfect.  Everyone at the party I brought it too asked for the recipe!

I sautéed the onions and bacon at the beginning with a clove of garlic and it turned out great. If you want crunchy bacon, though, make it separately and add at the end. I added a package of cooked, cubed ham for a little extra meat. I also used Smoked Paprika, Garlic Salt, a Pepper mix, and Parsley because I felt like the original recipe didn't have enough spices. It's delicious!

I made this for a serving of 4. It came out delicious. I also added a bit more seasoning like black pepper, a bit more salt and garlic powder. The bacon was a bit soft but it was ok for me. I made extra bacon cut in tiny pieces as garnish along with cheese and green onions. Overall a very good soup.

Love this recipe! It's easy to make and yummy. I just throw onion in with potatoes to cook in crockpot. I also just use real bacon bits instead of cooking bacon before hand.

Great recipe, will definite make this again! Thankful I read some reviews before hand and modified a few things. I decided to leave out the bacon and used ready cooked bacon bits when ready to serve. I cut the potatoes into smaller cubes and was able to have it ready in 3 and a half hours on high. Skip the water and use 5 cans of chicken broth instead. I also used 1tbsp of onion powder, 1tbsp of garlic powder and doubled up on the dill weed, it turned out very flavourful and not bland at all. And 18% table cream thickened it up very well. Served with some cheddar cheese on top. Glad I came across this recipe! Thank you!

Amazing! Turned out plenty thick and not soupy at all. I will definitely follow this recipe as a guide for creamy potato soups from now on.

I did use heavy whipping cream for the main cooking and half and half later if it got to thick or for reheating. Instead of bacon and onion like the beginning states, I added a tablespoon of butter and a bag of bacon pieces along with onion powder. After I added the flour mix, I added half a bag of cheddar also. My family loves this stuff! I make club sandwiches to go with it and a fresh pickle.

Pretty good, with some changes. 

First, I should note that I did not use condensed soup. I was able to save the recipe by adding a fair amount of shredded cheese and a bit of flour in addition to what is already suggested per the recipe guidelines. I found it needed salt and I used regular black pepper instead of the white pepper. I also added some onion powder to the mix. Turned out great with changes!

This recipe over-delivered. I was worried it wasn't going to be creamy enough, but it was delicious. As others suggested, I saved my bacon to top individual bowls to keep it crispy, and I just threw the raw onion in at the beginning rather than saute it. I also only used about a 1/4 of an onion because that's all I had. I kicked it up to high about halfway through for a bit - not sure if it needed it, and I put my dairy products in a couple hours early because I was leaving the house.  Turned out great! I will definitely make again.

I added leftover ham instead of bacon because I didn't have bacon. It tasted great. I am trying bacon this time around.

This was a good dish, it turned out very mild, and by mild I mean pretty bland but the flavors were not bad. I topped it with lots of cheese and still kinda wish I had done something differently. If I ever need a quick fix this would be a good meal. Had lots of leftovers!!

Fantastic! I threw everything in the pot and cooked on high for 3 hours, then low for 1 hour. Also used heavy cream and added garlic salt and thyme. Will definitely make again.

This was my first "from scratch" potato soup.  I wanted one that I could put in the slow cooker and cook all day and this soup was wonderful.  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out beautifully.  Flavorful, great consistency, nothing to change in my opinion!  I added bacon bits and cheese on top to garnish and my family LOVED this soup.  It's a keeper!  Thank you so much!

This was super good!  I did change a bit.  I added about 7 small yellow potatoes and half a head of cauliflower.  Because it was so much more potato, I had to add lots water and spices.  Loved the dill in it!  I didn't add half and half or evaporated milk, but did a small rue and added that with regular milk.  Then after it was all done, I mashed it up a bit before serving with cheddar cheese and homemade biscuits.  The cauliflower was amazing in it!

I made a reduced amount of serving but skipped the evaporated milk completely and just used regular milk instead.  I substituted the bacon with Hungarian bacon, a very smoky bacon that I find in Italian grocery stores.  I caramelized sweet onion in a small crock pot.  I added some dried chives for color and also some ramps but green onion would work.  Going to try making bread bowls tomorrow to serve my leftovers in.

This was so good on a cold winter day.  My husband liked it as well and that is a plus.  He is not a big potato soup fan.  The only thing I added was some basil and onion powder to taste.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent recipe! I modified as I needed something quick and not with a slow cooker, so I followed the recipe, however I boiled on a medium heat for about 45 minutes until potatoes were soft, then added the rest of ingredients as directed. I also changed the half and half to 2% to reduce some fat and I did not even notice any differnce. I also used fresh dill and increased the amount to about 1/4 cup (fresh). It was YUMMY!!Will make again. This is a recipe that does not fail, but allows you to play with and modify as you need.

I made this last night for the first time.  I followed the directions with the following exceptions.
I pre-cooked the bacon putting some in for flavor ; I used 1- 1/4 cups of water and at the end I wanted to thicken up the soup so I added in instant potato flakes.
I COULD NOT BELIEVE HOW GOOD THIS CAME OUT!!  AMAZING!!!!!!   
We have alot left over since it's just me and my husband so I will be freezing part of it.  I WILL be making this again!  Thank you so much for sharing this receipe

I added some things and made this on the stove top since I got a late start on it. I added a grated carrot and 2 stalks diced celery and a heaping 1/8 tsp of minced garlic. I didnt use as much liquid since most people had problems with the broth being thin. I also added about a cup of shredded cheese at the end.

UPDATE: SINCE I WASN'T A FAN, I GAVE MY PARENTS LEFTOVERS. ALTHOUGH MY DAD LIKED THIS, HE ALSO AGREED THAT THE SOUP WAS A TAD WATERY (BUT TASTY). This was allright.... Certainly not the best potato soup I've ever had, but not the worse one either. Had my soup thickened as it should have, I would have a different opinion. Even after 30 minutes on HIGH (I bumped my sc setting to high in hopes that my soup would thicken - 30 minutes on low did NOTHING), my soup was pretty watery. It seemed to thicken up after sitting on the warm setting, but was still a tad too thin for my liking. I invited my neighbor over for dinner and she ended up showing up an hour later than expected. Because the soup seemed to thicken over time, this worked out well. :) As many other reviewers did, I too cooked my bacon, drained it and saved to use as garnish. I then sauteed my onion in the reserved grease (mmm...) and proceeded as directed. For a pretty (and yummy!) presentation, I garnished each bowl of soup with my reserved bacon, snipped chives and shredded Monterey-cheddar blend cheese. Sourdough bread was a perfect accompainment. Although good, I think I'll stick with my stovetop recipe for ham and potato soup (it's MUCH better and just as easy to prepare). Thanks anyways, ROZANRENEE. :-)

Used heavy cream instead of half and half. Cooked the bacon first then removed the pan from the heat and added the onion. Then added the bacon right at the end to sauté it all together. Cooked the first 90 minutes on high heat. Then cooked for 7 hours on low. Topped with cheddar cheese and bagged 'real bacon' bits and some cayenne. Love!

I created the broth with a hambone and the ham left over from easter. Then added bacon, celery,bay and dill. Thickened it with 1/2 potato flakes and flour mixed with cream to minimize the flour content and/or taste. 

Came out great!

Men can cook :)

This was very good. I gave it 4 stars because I added seasoning to it. Garlic salt, pepper and onion salt. The consistency was perfect. I also just used chicken broth and no water. Sprinkled cheese on top. Will definitely make again.

Excellent recipe although I did make changes to satisfy my own tastes.  I added about 3/4 c. finely chopped celery and a little more onion and salt.  I also thickened this with cornstarch instead of flour.

Absolutely LOVED this soup! I made only minor changes, and it was GREAT! Instead of the condensed chicken broth and water, I used 5 cups of chicken broth. And, instead of the bacon, I used leftover ham. I sauteed the ham, onions, and carrots (great addition if you are trying to clean out your fridge) before throwing it into the crock pot. Topped it with some cheddar cheese. Very easy. Will definitely use this again!

This is a good basic recipe for chowder type soups.  Not the best soup I've had.  I did use ham instead of bacon, plus I added onion powder and a chicken bullion cube, because my stock was homemade.  I didn't use the evaporated milk, too sweet.  But it wasn't bad.

It was fine, but not great. Serving with bacon, cheese, sour cream, and green onions helped flavor it.

Wonderful soup!  I used heavy cream instead of half and half.  Also added half a jar of (real) bacon bits and two cups of shredded cheddar the last half hour of cooking and oh my!  Definitely not a diet food.

This was actually very tasty. I was very concerned throughout the day because it looked like my soup was going to be greasy and burnt tasting due to the bacon being added first, but it was fine once I added the cream. I usually make baked potato soup, so I'm used to a thicker soup. Next time, I will add more flour to my mix to make it a little thicker. All in all, a keeper.

First time I made this recipe I followed everything to the T. After the taste test I have made some changes. I added some paprika about half a table spoon and some parsley as well. Chopped up some broccoli. Also, I used heavy cream instead of the half and half. Served in a bread bowl with cheese and sour cream on top. Of course, I know that if you are watching your calories the changes I did would make you want to cry but, for a cold Washington state night it helps keep you warm!

This was definitely a good soup.  I hesitated to give it fewer than five stars, but since I changed the recipe around a bit, I have to.  

It was not getting thick in my crock pot, even after adding the flour and half & half, so I added more flour.  Still a bit liquid for a cream soup.  So, I took four cups of the soup out and pureed them in the blender.  Better.  Added more flour to that over heat and it thickened a bit.  Added that back into the crock pot.  

I also skipped the dill and added a seasoning blend which has pepper, sea salt, mustard seeds, garlic powder, coriander, chili pepper and paprika in it.  

At the end of the cook time I steamed a bit of broccoli and some diced carrots and added that and about two cups of shredded cheese.  

We ate this in sourdough bread bowls and my family went back for seconds and thirds!

Great Potato soups! MY family, including 6 boys, all loved the soup. I did some changes to recipe...didn't use dill weed...didn't have. I also didn't use half and half, I just used milk instead. I fried bacon and when it was almost done, I added the onions. I then put both, including the grease into crock pot. I did double recipe, using 2 cans of broth and 4 boullion cubes as well as water. I did take some of the juice and potatoes into a blender and blended with the flour...I did add extra flour to make the soup thicker.  I also added a 4 cup bag of cheddar cheese. Right before serving I added a little more cheese and more bacon on top...for looks and taste! Next time I will make sure I have the dill weed and half & half as listed! Thanks for sharing the recipe and all the other reviews...allrecipes is the only place I go get my recipes!

Excellent Soup! Made it this evening. Doubled the recipe, but was worried when some people posted it was too thin. 
1. Waited to put in bacon until it was served, but used the bacon grease to soften the onion.
2. Before adding flour/ cream, I removed about a cup of the fluid, also added cornstarch to thicken the soup.
3. went with another reviewer's suggestion and used a hand blender for a few seconds just to smooth out some of the chunks of potato. 
It was a really simple recipe and delicious!
Thanks!

It was okay, kinda sweet, which wasn't what I was looking for. I also ran a few cups through the blender to thicken it up since it was still very runny. Not bad but not really good.

I just finished making this and it is DELISH! I added chopped garlic in with the onions, and skipped the step of sauteing them in the bacon drippings, they were plenty soft after so long in the crock pot. I used red potatos and after seven hours they were no where near tender. I will use a different potato next time, but I think it would have been fine if I had cooked it on high instead of low. It ended up taking twelve hours after I turned it on high. I also blended a little more than half the soup after I added the flour, half and half, and milk. The soup was not thick and creamy until I did that. Afterwards it was perfect! Like a bisque with a good amount of potato chunks left in. I also mixed in a cup of cheese at the very end and some butter. So very good! I have not even added the cheese, green onion, and bacon to top it and it is awesome! I could eat this just the way it is!

I found this recipe and was real excited because my wife was looking for something thick and creamy...similar to bisque, without being a bisque.  By following the recipe almost entirely, it did not come out thick and creamy.  Instead it was runny and somewhat bland.  In order to improve it's integrity, I added 3-4 pods of crushed garlic and a dash of chili powder to give it more life.

The next time I make this soup, I will set the slow cooker to high instead of low as suggested because I had to transfer the entire soup into a stockpot for 20 minutes to continue cooking the potatoes through.  Something else I may do is add some more flour so that it becomes thicker then it initally came out.

Good old time flavor.  Give it more time or cook on high if using Pontiac Red potatoes , in place of Idaho or other potato with more starch.

I was excited about having a good potato soup recipe but found the finished product, in this case, to be a little bland and not creamy enough for my taste.  It was more of a watery base with potato chunks included than the creamy soup that I would like.

great soup base without having to make a separate white sauce on the stove top. I didn't have any bacon, onion or even evaporated milk and it was still yummy-just amped up the seasonings.

Working 12 hours shifts, I am always on the lookout for easy and tasty slow-cooker recipes.  This was fabulous.  My husband loved it too.  I followed the recipe exactly, except that I used fat free half/half, and left out dill and cooked on low for 10 hours. Didn't have white pepper, used black.  Will definitely make again.

I used condensed cream of celery soup in lieu of the condensed chicken stock, because that's what I had.  I just needed to add more water than called for to get the right consistency.  Excellent taste!

Perhaps the reviewer who thought this was too sweet used sweetened condensed milk instead of evaporated milk. This soup was yummy!

We thought that this was better than any Potato Soup you can get in the finest resturants. I Cooked the potatoes before I put them in the broth and had it ready to eat in about 2 hours.

Yummy! I changed a couple of things. I didn't have evaporated milk, so not sure how that effected it. I pureed a lot of it because I like that consistency...smooth with a few chucks of potato. I used a lot of garlic powder, and a little cayenne pepper to add heat and flavor. Topped it with chives, cheese, and sour cream, and it was good to go. I also didn't use water. Just used broth. This was out St. Patty's Day dinner because we're not big fans of corned beef and cabbage. It was great! Thanks!

With changes, this is more like 4 stars.  I took others' advice and removed the bacon for later, and stauteed the onion (plus some celery and carrots) in the grease. I used regular broth, since that's what I had, and omitted the water. I topped it with LOTS of cheese. However, when I took my first bite, I realized what was still missing: garlic. Next time, I'll add some witht he onion.

I love this recipe.  I also don't like to cook bacon...but only because I'm tempted to eat it all before I do anything with it...(I think I'm embarrassed even writing that...); however, given my weakness for bacon...I deal with "bacon issues" by buying Hormel's real bacon bits and use that as the basis for most of my "bacon" needs.  It tastes great...it's inexpensive...and there is not a lot of grease to deal with when you add it to a recipe.  This recipe is a real "comfort food" in my house...and, yes, served with warm bread (even Schwans...the food delivery service bread) it is terrific.  Give it a try...it's excellent!

Made this soup for dinner tonight and served it with warm sour dough bread.  This was a great combination.   The soup is really runny in the crock pot after 7 hours on low...I pureed about 1/3 of it to add some thickness.  This didn't seem to help much.  When I put the flour/cream mixture in, I put the crock on high for about an hour.  This thickened it up nicely.  All in all, with a few modifications, this was an awesome recipe.  The whole family enjoyed it.

Great recipe!  I followed reviewer: Lil Miss Cutie Cook's modifications for the most part since I am attempting to cut down on the fat content and eat healthier.  I also added some fresh minced garlic, 2 bay leaves, a whole onion, a dash of cayenne and 2c extra water to cover all the veggies.  I also thickened it up at the end with 2 tbs cornstarch and 1/2c light sour cream and garnished with extra cheese and reduced fat bacon pieces.  Even my kids liked it!

Good soup, with a couple minor changes. I, unfortunately, did not read the prior reviews about the soup not being very thick. I suspected, so I added about 4 cups of broth and no water. It was still too runny for my taste, so I added some potato flakes to thicken it up. I microwaved a few extra pieces of bacon until crispy and added them with cheese for topping. The only other thing that I would suggest (and I didn't add it this time) would be some chopped green onions, and not on top, but in with the potatoes, broth, bacon, and onion. I think it would go nicely in this soup. Oh, I did substitute turkey bacon, because I am not a pork eater. My husband didn't even notice the difference!

Wowsers!  Hearty, tastey and delish.  And I even used ALL low fat/fat free ingredients!  I couldn't find condensed chicken broth, so instead I doubled the amount of just regular broth and didn't add any water.  You will LOVE this creamy, yummy recipe!!!  We had it with hot French bread!

I gave this recipe a 4 star rating just because I followed the suggestion of a few other reviewers.  I used about 6 sm. to med. sized red potatoes; skins on and I used 3 bullion  cubes to 2 cups. water. For the water I used less than 2 cups; about 1 and 2/3 cups. I add garlic to everything and this recipe was no exception! As others suggested, I cooked and set aside the bacon in the refrigerator then sauteed the onion in the bacon grease. I got the perfect consistency (not too think or too thin)by only using about 3/4 of the half-n-half/four mixture and only 1 cup of regular milk. Just before adding this to the slow cooker I added about 2 T of butter and turned the temperature up to high for the last 30 minutes. At the same time I added 1 cup of shredded cheddar and brought back out the bacon to reach room temp to crumble for garnish. Soup was very yummy and perfect for this chilly fall evening!

I thought this soup was good. My husband and daughter loved it. This is a very hearty soup that filled us up quick. I do recommend using heavy cream instead of the half and half, as well as adding more salt (to your own taste).

I tried to stay fairly true to the recipe for rating reasons.  I did add carrots and celery when the potatoes are added, but otherwise everything stayed the same.  The result lacked the flavor I desired.  Easy enough to fix, I added some more dill and some garlic salt to the soup and gave it the extra taste I wanted.  I added the bacon in the beggining as advised, but I also cooked up extra bacon to crumble over the top.  It didn't turn out super creamy, but it still tasted good.  For leftovers I grated some chedder over the top, this helped give it the perfect thickness.  Overall a good recipe, I'll definately use it again, with some minor tweaks.

This was fantastic! I had to make a couple of substitutions: 1)Could not find condensed chicken broth so I used condensed Cream of Chicken instead (I picked out and discarded the pieces of chicken first)and 2)Discovered someone had eaten all the bacon so I sauteed the onion in a 1/4 cup of butter instead. Everybody loved it and there were no leftovers.

I gave this recipe 4 stars because of the changes I made to it. With the changes I would give it 5 stars! I followed another reviewer and cooked it on the stove top. I browned some bacon and onion first but then removed the bacon and transferred the drippings and onions to a stockpot. I used 3 cans of diced potatoes and 2 cups of chicken broth. I cooked that over medium-low heat for about 45 minutes. I omitted the water after other reviews stated it was too thin. I mixed the flour, evaporated milk and 1 cup of heavy cream instead of half and half. I cooked for an additional 30 minutes. It cooked down to a nice thick, creamy soup. You can even mash the potatoes if you want more smooth. Garnish with cheese, chives and bacon. DELISH!

I just made this recipe tonight and it was good but there has been better recipe's on this site. I agree with one other reviewer,that the half and half with the evaporated milk just seemed to make more of a sauce than a cream. I don't think I'll make this one again but then again,I might try only do things different.

My family loved this and the kids begged for it for lunch the next day.  Prior to serving I used a blender to blend it since I do not like the chunks and I did not put the bacon in until serving but it was wonderful.

So easy and good!!!  I will definitely remember this recipe when I have too many potatoes on hand.  I followed the recipe except that I left the skins on the potatoes.  Also, since I didn't have any dill on hand I just used Italian seasonings, some garlic, and a tiny bit of red pepper flakes.  It turned out very good!

My family really enjoyed this soup!! I used heavy cream instead of half and half and I did not cook the beacon in the soup. I also added a cup of sharp chedder at the end with the flour mixture. I did have turkey beacon, fresh green onion and cheese to top it off! Wonderful for the upcoming cold weather!

I served this at a church gathering function and it was a huge it. Everyone loved it. I loved the consistency. I did make a few changes. I doubled the ingredients for everything but the thickening liquid. For the thickening liquid I used 2 cups half and half, 1 cup 2% milk, and one can evaporated milk. It was great! I would cook the bacon before the onions next time too but loved them added to the cooking soup, it gave the soup great flavor!

This GREAT!  I have been looking for a good potato soup recipe!  This is IT.  The bacon is the key!   I did have to add flour/water at the very end to get it to the consistency I like.  But still VERY GOOD!  Husband loved it, and that rarely happens!

This soup was a solid 3 in the scores. We, as a class, were surprised since we liked this so much. It was a good, warm winter soup.

Super tasty, though I did make a few modifications. I just added cans of chicken broth, not condensed, to equal the same amount as the condensed plus the water. I didn't add dill because I didn't have any. But other than that, I think I did everything the same and it was really good. We liked it.

This recipe rocks!!! My family loves it, but I tweak it a bit by adding grilled chicken right before I serve, It makes the soup a bit more hearty and filling and it disappears quick. I too have to add the bacon before I serve so it stays crispy. I think next time I'll try cheddar chesse with it to!!

great soup and so easy! The only change I had was I added a whole 32oz container of chicken broth and once the potatoes were soft I took out 3/4 of them and blended them until smooth and put them back in. Will definitely make this recipe again!

I followed the recipe exactly as written, and I thought it came out way too thin and watery.  It had little flavor, and tasted chalky.  I thought it might be better on the second day, and tried to add some more spices, but it didn’t help much.  I am really surprised because of all the good reviews, I very rarely have a flop like this from this site.  Sorry, I won't be making this one again.

Great recipe.  I was out of many ingredients, so I had to make some substitutions.  But it was a huge hit in my house.  Hubby asked me to make it for company.  Here are my changes-
Did not put bacon in soup instead added to the top of each bowl after served.

Cooked onion in bacon drippings and added a little drippings to crock pot.

Used Veggie broth and 4 chicken bullion cubes.

Cooked on high for 3 hours before turning down to low.

Used 4 c. half and half omitted condensed milk.  

Doubled spices.

Added 1 tsp. red pepper flakes near end of cooking.

Added 1 pouch of mac and cheese sauce with flour, will try 1.5 cup shredded cheddar next time.

Extremely bland.  The evaporated milk and half and half did it in.  Perhaps I'm just used to foods with a lot of spices and flavors.

Very easy to make, but unfortunately pretty bland.  Use milk in place of water and used bacon as garnish as many reviewers said it was mushy when cooked with soup.

This recipe was great! I read the other reviews and followed some of their tips. I started this the night before in my slow cooker and put it on the lowest setting. I did saute the onions in a separate pan from the bacon so the two distinct flavors would blend in the slow cooker. My soup came out wonderful! Creamy and thick. I also added shredded cheese to each bowl as I served it. Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

This was my first time making soup and I have to say…I was pretty impressed!  I also deviated from the original recipe.  I think definitely needed more salt, pepper & dill.  Also - instead of onions (which I hate) I “super-diced” some carrots and celery.  We also chopped up some ham and added it to the soup right before we served it.  I did cook it on high for the last 2 hours and it came out so delicious!!!  I served it with some broccoli cornbread and shredded cheese!!!  Yummy!!!!!!!!!!!

The only change I made was to use Canadian bacon instead of regular, just to cut some fat.  Diced it up and sauteed it first.

Pretty good considering I didn't have any bacon, white pepper or dill weed.  I substitued diced smoked sausage links for the bacon and fresh ground pepper.  I also added extra cheese.  This turned out pretty good.  I will definitely make it again but I'll use bacon next time.

My husband and I both loved this soup. I used fat free ev. milk and skim milk to lower the fat, but the soup was still very creamy. I also skipped the dill in favor of a little cayenne pepper. I also used low-sodium vegetable broth and omitted the bacon. Great recipe! Thanks!

I put the onions in the bacon and fried them on medium, chopped the bacon into tiny tidbits, and it made a pretty color against the buttery yellow soup. I didn't have any gross "brown bits," just "bacon bits" :)  I added a little red pepper seeds for a little kick.  Also, I had the flu when I made this, so I used "Simply Potatoes" diced potatoes and onions, straight from the freezer, and they cooked up nicely.  I used less flour, so the soup would be soupy, and cooked it on medium on the stovetop for a quicker meal.  Easy, quick, and delicious.  It's a great flavor, especially for those "Flu-days."  Thanks so much.

This was pretty good. Easy to make. Added cheddar at the end. used roast garlic flavored chicken broth and did not use any water. Also cooked my bacon first as suggested by others. Turned out really good. Flavor is subtle so those that require a ton of spice on everything they eat will be disappointed unless they take action during cooking. This was meant to be subtle though I think. Really good, I'll make it again.

Tastes amazing, and even better with some cheddar cheese added to individual servings just before eating. My first time making it needed a few adjustments, like smaller potato pieces, but that is easily fixed.

i followed some of the other reviewer's advice and cooked the bacon first, then added the onions after.  that seemed to work perfectly.

soup was excellent.  

for me:  i needed some more salt, which i added afterwards.  i dind't have white pepper i just ground in fresh black pepper.  and threw in some hot sauce for good measure..

i'd make it again for sure

This was really good - my family enjoyed this very much. Here's what I did: I cooked the bacon then the onions with 2 chopped carrots. I added a bay leaf & 1 clove of freshly minced garlic. Once cooked - I put about 4 cups of soup in the food processor then blended w/the rest of the soup. When serving I added a splash of hot sauce, cheddar cheese, sour cream & bacon pieces. YUMMY * Edited to add: We had leftovers, only this time I added carmelized onions along with the other toppings & it was great! This would be a great soup for a party because you can have all the toppings available & everyone can pick & choose what they like - just about anything you would put in a baked potato can go in this soup - very versatile.

This was just okay. After spending hours making this, I was a bit disappointed. It tasted and looked fine -- I guess I was looking for something with more of a bang. Seemed like it needed more spices for extra taste. I'll probably try a different recipe next time.

This is the very best potato soup we have ever had! I served it to my mother and aunt who have made potato soup for many years and they both said they were throwing away their recipes and adding this one to their permanent recipe box! I didn't have any bacon so I used ham shanks instead and also added dried minced onion instead of the sauteed and it was tremendous! I would give it 20 stars if I could!!!!!!!!!!!!! Thank you for sharing Shirley! I will be trying more of your recipes!

I thought this recipe was pretty good. One thing I would maybe do differently is sprinkle bacon on top after its done cooking, instead of adding it in the crockpot. Biscuits dipped in the soup were very good.

This soup is so delicious. My husband says it is better than his favorite restaurant potato soup. I always use Yukon Gold potatoes and I add a little extra dill, because I really like the flavor it gives the soup. This is a great recipe and well worth the effort!

Very creamy and thick soup with a great color, family thought it was the best potato soup recipe yet. I ran out of time to do it in the crockpot so did it on the stove. Worked just fine!

The taste was OK.  Problem was, I didn't know if would come out that brown color.  I actually cooked this for my wife's Christmas party at work.  No one touched it due to it's sad presentation so it came home and I tried it.  Like I said, taste was OK.

Soup was good; very pretty presentation.  I added 1 cup of cheese when adding flour, h&h, and evap. milk.  Melted nicely.  I also used fat free evap milk & h&h.   I saw no difference.  I may try a little more flour next time to thicken it up a bit, but it was delicious just like this.

I made this in my crockpot.....prep took about 40 minutes, but it was easy.  Tasted quite yummy.  I think it was even better left over.  I think it would be really good even thicker though, like "Outback Steakhouse"'s creamy potato soup....not sure how to accomplish that.  I will keep this one for a once or twice a year dish.

My family loves this recipe! The only changes we make are we add another potato and a teaspoon more of dill, and then I also use cornstarch instead of flour for my thickener.

I made this exactly as written, with the exception of doubling the recipe, and had cheese, chopped green onions and extra bacon on the side to be added if wanted.  It was perfect!!  I would not change a thing!!

This soup was too good!  I substituted the bacon for beef sausage because I'm allergic to bacon.  I substituted the half and half for a can of condensed milk to lower the fat value.  I added two ears of corn cut off the cob because I love corn.  I couldn't find dill in the store so I didn't add that.  I substituted the chicken broth for water mixed with low sodium bullion cube.  This was an excellent way to start the day!!

This one is always a favorite. I use this base recipe all the time. I do add chopped up carrots and celery. I also double ( or triple) the bacon because it's hubbys favorite part. I've added corn before and called it corn chowder and even ham once or twice This is an easy fun recipe to play with.

I thought this was a very good soup. For me it could use more bacon, and I think it needs a little more spice or flavour. Not sure what it is.  I would make it again for sure. Thank you.

No need to wash the dishes.  They will be licked cleaned.   I made the following adjustments... In Instant Pot, sauté onion in avocado oil (or your favorite high temp oil) until tender.  Add 36 oz chicken broth. Use new red potatoes, skin on, cut into small pieces.  Add recommended spices.  Either slow cook or pressure cook.  Add pkg of pre-cooked bacon crumbles. Omit flour, half & half, condensed milk and water . Use 16 oz whipping cream, approx 4 oz cream cheese, and 1 c shredded cheddar to thicken.  Sauté in instant pot until cream cheese is melted and starts to boil. Stir frequently, careful not to burn. Garnish with chopped green onions, sour cream, shredded cheese.

I made this recipe as listed but omitted the onion and added garlic powder, paprika, and Parmesan cheese to taste. I served it with cheddar available for those who enjoy cheesy potato soup. I have a large family so doubled the recipe and used a large Crock-Pot. If you do this, I would suggest cooking it on high instead of low or it will take quite a bit longer to cook. After five hours on high, it was perfect!! My family loved it!

I have made this several times! Sometimes I have even added pumpkin and butternut squash with the potatoes, the combination adds more flavor and texture...not that it needs it, it’s amazing with out. I definitely want to try it with cheese next. I love this recipe, it’s my go to on any cold day.

Loved it! 
I made a few accidental modifications, like adding the milk in the beginning, adding more pepper instead of dill....I also used a hand blender to thicken before adding the half & half.

I’ve tried a few creamy potato soups and all have been good, what sets this one apart from the rest is the dill flavor, and I love dill so I had to try it. This recipe did not disappoint. My husband even says he only wants this potato soup from now on. This will definitely be our go to recipe for potato soup.

Great! A perfect starter soup, or enjoy as is.  Top the soup with the Bacon when serving.  Nice and crunchy.  I wouldn’t let the Bacon cook with the soup.  Rubbery.  Lots of Cheese and Dill, really makes it come together.  Thanks for sharing, just what I needed in the below freezing temperatures we are experiencing!

It was bland. I even added half a bag of shredded sharp cheddar cheese, sea salt and black pepper.  Also, I only put in 3 large potatoes not the 5 it calls for and it was plenty of potatoes.

Will definitely make again.  So delicious on this cold, winter day.  I did add about 3/4 cup shredded cheddar cheese at the end.  No other changes.  Hubby loves it.  Great with some hot cornbread.

This soup is so very good.  I always follow the recipe exact the first time I try it then adjust to my taste the next time.  My huaband and I felt that there was no adjusting needed.  Will be making again soon.

Only change was to add the bacon later as other reviews mentioned. I also added 1 cup shredded cheese toward the end, because my family loves cheese! Other than that, this recipe will definitely become a staple in our house! Thank you so much for the recipe! Big hit and big thumbs up!

I really want to love this.  But each time I had it, it was just too rich, made my stomach hurt.  I would try this again, but use 1% milk maybe a small amount of cream or 1/2 and 1/2.  I don't think the soup needs all that cream if you mash the potatoes a bit, as it thickens it up a lot.  Other than that, It had good flavor.  I used chicken stock as I couldn't find condensed broth , I added the onion raw and cooked turkey bacon separately and added it at the end.  Topped with cheddar, more bacon bits and green onion.

I did not have bacon so used chicken sausage, added about five cloves of garlic, a smallish onion,  some dried basil, and a few sprigs of fresh rosemary.  I used only chicken broth (a box) and cooked it all on low about six hours.  At the end, mixed 1/4 cup of flour with 1 cup half and half and skipped the milk.  Put 2 cups of soup in a blender and that made it smooth but with lots of yummy lumps.  I did not peel the potatoes and really liked the peels.  Great hearty soup.

This was very delicious.  My husband was thrilled with it.  I think it needs a little more seasoning, perhaps more salt and pepper or something else, but it has a nice thick consistency and is full of creamy goodness.  We will make this again.  Thanks for the recipe!

First time I made this I followed the directions completely. Actually the first few times. It's a huge hit. Eventually I got more creative. I use pepper bacon with the onions, use some of the extra grease. I add garlic salt, Lawry's all purpose salt, extra amount of dill and white pepper. At the end I do everything exactly as it says but add 2-3 cups of cheese. Salt to taste. It's amazing.

Made exactly as recipe.
THe longer it cooks the worse it gets. It gets sweeter and sweeter. The evaporated  mike makes it sweet and not liked by most of the family. I threw out half of it.
I liked the bacon  and onion flavors so maybe dropping the evaporated  milk it could be OK.

This was really, really good.  My very picky toddler and kindergartener ate it without complaint and even complimented me.  My husband practically raved.  I might add a little more bacon in the future just because it's bacon.   I made a couple substitutions/additions:
I didn't have white pepper so I used black.
I didn't have half and half so I used heavy cream and whole milk to make up the 2 cups.
My bacon was already cooked because it was leftover from breakfast.
I used Lawry's seasoned salt just because I like it.
I added a cup of grated carrots for a little extra vitamin action.
I ran my immersion blender through it a few times to break up the chunks because I prefer a creamier soup.

So easy.  Read thru some of the reviews.  So added small diced celery and carrots.  As this was intended vegetarian dish. I put the bacon, grated cheese and chopped chives on the side.  I used a vegetable broth instead.... used a hand potato masher right in the crock pot..  just to make some small bits and make it creamer. I did add the half and half and the evaporated milk.  What a winner.  Everyone had a choice... vegetarian or with bacon.  This is a keeper.

I left out the dill,  and I added cheese to it when I served it. It was good, but I would classify it as OK. Nothing special.

This was SO GOOD. I suggest you cook the bacon first, then remove it and some of the grease and sauté the onion. There wasn't enough space in my pan for the bacon to get crispy before the onion cooked fully. I diced the onion super small and sliced my potatoes thin (peeled and quartered the potatoes, then sliced them about 0.5 cm thick-there is no immersion blender in this recipe). I added a little more salt and pepper, and I also added garlic powder. Then, for the last 30 minutes (when it has you add in the dairy) I put in a (drained) can of corn with it and turned it up to high heat. Topped it with crispy bacon pieces and shredded cheddar cheese.  Seriously, so good, and made A LOT. I froze half of it. Will definitely make again.

This is a very delicious recipe with the modifications I made based on other reviews. I added two cloves of garlic and sauteed that with the onion (in butter). I saved the bacon until the last and crumbled that on top. I used chicken stock as opposed to chicken broth. I used only 1 cup of water and eliminated the evaporated milk. I added sharp cheddar and chives on the top at the end along with the crumbled bacon. Delicious!

Flavor was good but the cheese didn't melt smoot and the consistency was right.

I have been making this for years, ever since I saw it on Allrecipes.  It's the first, and still the best, potato soup recipe I have found.  It is a very forgiving recipe.  Like most of the reviewers, I don't add the bacon to the soup.  I save it and serve it  on top, with the cheese.  (But, if you have leftover kielbasa or hotdogs, they can be chopped up and tossed in to enhance the flavor.)  And normally I omit the water, and use 32 ounces of vegetable or chicken stock.  Also, I don't bother precooking the onions.  I just toss them into the crock pot with the potatoes.  Thank you for this, Rozanrenee!  It's been a lifesaver.

i did omit the water and used stock instead. i also took out the half and half as suggested by others and used heavy cream. it turned out amazing!! my husband is a big potato soup critic and he LOVED IT!! will definitely make this one again, because of the crockpot. the tater soup i usually make has me in front of the stove for about 2 1/2 hours. so it was nice to come home from work and spend 30 minutes finishing it. i did add alot more salt and some garlic salt.

I added an additional two cans of cheese soup and used canned diced potatoes. Added sharp cheddar cheese and bacon bits during last hour with flour mix and turned up to high. Also added 1 pkg. potato flakes. Filled the crock pot !

I didn't make any changes to the recipe although I probably didn't use quite enough bacon since I hate bacon fat and cut most of it off before cooking the bacon. Next time I'm thinking of trying it with the precooked bacon pieces. We will definitely be making this again. It was a huge hit with our family!

Outstanding! I have made this a couple of times and love it. The second time around I did not have any half and half so I used cream cheese. It was creamy and added a cheesy taste which I thououghly enjoyed, Thanks for sharing!

Make sure to use russet potatoes because of the higher amounts of starch and low moisture content. I also subbed the condensed soup and water with 32oz of  chicken broth, then added parsley near the end with 3 tbsp butter and additional salt.  I read the reviews, and for those who saved the bacon for last, you missed out on the melding of flavors.

I removed the meat to make this vegetarian and it still turned out really well! I used vegetable broth instead of chicken and I cooked the bacon separately and served it with each bowl. My family mixed in as much bacon as they wanted. I think without the bacon the soup needed more salt, but since we had some bacon eaters and some non-eating it I just left it to individuals to salt to taste.

I made what equates to four times the recipe in two separate crock pots.  One for my family and one for my bestie for our night in for dinner and crocheting.  Everyone loved it, I think I might try heavy cream next time to make it thicker.

I made this recipe just as it says. It was delicious! The only thing different is the timing. I put in the crockpot on low, and it took about 2 more hours than it says it will. Other than that, it was great! Definitely a keeper!

I didn't know what condensed chicken broth was so I used 32oz of regular chicken broth and no water. Everything else, I did as explained in the recipe. I thought it was going to be thinner than I would like when I first added all the half-and-half and evaporated milk, but it ended up being really creamy! It could definitely benefit from seasoning, as the flavor is a bit one-dimensional... I'll add a lot more dill next time :)

Very good! I didn't put in the water, only used half the amount of flour it called for and used 8 baby red potatoes. SO delicious! I also omitted the dill and added celery salt and garlic powder. Will definitely eat again!

I read reviews that it was rather runny so I used heavy cream. The soup was quite runny  after the recommended cook time but I left if on warm for most of the day and it thickened up quite a bit! 
Hubby liked it. Might use ham or sausage next time. Will defiantly make it again.

It's a good recipe, but I had to modify it. I first added cooked bacon.  After 6 hours on low, I whisked butter & flour & added it to the soup to thicken it & Then I added mash potato flakes

Rather then using 2 cups of water I used an extra cup and a half of chicken broth and then only half a cup of water. I also added just a bit more flour for a slightly thicker soup. But oh my goodness let me tell you,  this is the BEST potato soup I have ever had! Its so creamy and so yummy! Ive eaten so much I could explode! Will definitely be making this again...and again, and again!

This soup is definitely restaurant quality, now I won't have to go out to indulge in this delicousness. As suggested by a previous review, I waited to add bacon until soup was being served to avoid it being soggy. I also like my soup kinda thick and more rich, so I added a can of cambells condensed cheddar cheese, and also some shredded cheddar cheese. Adding those gave soup the perfect consistancy!

It was good.  I would have it again.  The other reviewers were right, that I should have left the bacon out while cooking and just used it as a topping.

My entire family loved this soup! I did not have as much time to cook, so I literally just mixed all the ingredients and cooked on medium-high in stove until potatoes were ready. I used golden organic potatoes and sweet onions. I went easy with the white pepper because I didn't like how it smelled (think horse stable), ha, ha. So I just used a little bit. DELICIOUS! Will become a family staple.

Loved it!  I also added some fresh parsley and the dill at the end of cooking.   I made it on the stove top and since I had cooked crumbled bacon already, I sautéed the onions in some oil and then added the bacon bits with the milk.  Delicious!

I love this recipe! I only did two things differently, I deglazed the bacon pan with some of the liquid and grated cheese for a topping when serving. This could be a great creamy soup base making whatever kind of soup you ll ike.

Cleaned out the cupboards today and was looking for a slow cooker recipe with what I had on hand.  The only alterations were chicken bullion for condensed chicken broth, gluten free flour and skim milk as I didn't have cream.  It thickened up well and tasted great!

This is an amazing potato soup - lots of flavor.  I didn't use any water, just chicken stock.  I threw in a hambone leftover from Thanksgiving & added a few more herbs (rustic blend w/ sea salt). When it was time to thicken it, I used one can of evaporated milk whisked with 2 tablespoons of cornstarch. It was perfect & all the picky kids had seconds.  Love it & will be making it again!

Overall, this is a great recipe. I usually don't have 7 hours to cook it, more like 4 hours, so I cook it on high in my crock pot and it comes out perfectly. Even my picky 10 year old son asks for seconds of this soup! I've made this three times and I've always added the bacon at the beginning, to get the benefits of the salty/smoky flavor. This probably helps with the "bland" complaints I've seen here. I think the key thing is to fry the bacon slowly, at a low temperature so that it browns, yet doesn't get brittle or crumbly.  This prevents the bacon from getting broken up into little tiny bits while stewing. As others have suggested, I too, slowly  simmer the onions in the bacon drippings and add the drippings to the crock pot. My big change to the recipe is substituting the white pepper with roasted and chopped Big Jim green chile peppers. The green chile adds a mildly spicy kick and imparts a distinct savory addition to the soup. We add green chile to everything here in New Mexico, so this was a no-brainer for me. Two large  (9 inch) peppers or 4 medium peppers that have the skins and seeds removed is all that's needed. Another small change I made was that I add the evaporated milk at the beginning of the recipe instead of waiting till the end, which I believe helps thicken it a bit faster over the 4 hours.

Great soup that is easy to make!  I added the bacon in the last half hour.  When i make it again, i will put it in sooner so that the flavor is slightly mire pronounced.

 The flavor and consistancy of the soup overall though was amazing.   The family liked it so much we ran out way too soon.  So this is definitly a winner!

This turned out very nicely!  I cooked the bacon first and then sauteed the onions in the grease after it was done.  I also substituted heavy cream for half and half for a richer, thicker,  creamier flavor.  The consensus from all who had it was thumbs up!  And it was simpler to make than I thought.

The flavor was just ok.  I had to add salt and pepper as well (as some others have posted).  Half way through I mashed some of the potatoes hoping it would thicken the soup up.  Unfortunately it didn't do the trick.  It's still good just not worth writing home about.

I have made this soup numerous times...and it never disappoints.  Like many others, I fry the bacon, set aside, and then saute the onions in a bit of bacon grease to avoid the bacon getting mushy in the slow cooker.   I add some cheddar cheese at the end and it makes the whole family pleased.

I got side-tracked at my mother-in-law's over the weekend and completely forgot that I needed to throw this in the crock pot. I ended up starting it around 3:30pm and just cooked it on high for 3.5 hours.

I ended up adding about a cup of shredded cheddar cheese and I also used corn starch and water mixed together to thicken it a bit. 

The family loved it and I will most likely make it again.

The only thing different is cooking on stovetop.  I am always running behind.  This soup is the most wonderful potato soup I have ever tried and it is my "go to" recipe.  I use no other recipe for potato soup. - Zola

I only added something not on the original recipe, and that was celery, no bacon but had some baked smoked ham leftover that I used instead.  It was truly wonderful as it is, the ham was really good, but I will try the bacon next time.  I highly recommend this soup, it's filling and is restaurant quality.

We did not like the thin consistency of the original recipe so we made the following changes. Add 1 can (10.5oz) condensed Cheddar soup and use 3 cups of chicken broth. Eliminate the water. We also like to add cubed ham. The consistency is much better this way! We have been making this with our changes for years.  The whole family loves it. It's a keeper!

Great recipe base! I don't like dill so I skipped that. I also freeze turkey and chicken stock in quart jars, so used one instead of canned broth and water. Followed the rest of the recipe and was delicious. Looking forward to lunch leftovers tomorrow.

Love this soup! Perfect for a cool fall day. I did switch the bacon up for bacon bits since I like my bacon more well done. Regular bacon just didn't cook right with the onion. I also used a potato masher and mashed my potatoes towards the end so it wasn't super chunky.

This recipe rocks!  It is by far the best potato soup I have ever tasted.  I made it according to the recipe except I cooked the bacon and refrigerated it then added chopped celery to the onion and tenderized the celery and onion in a small amount of bacon drippings.  I put the crumbled bacon and shredded cheese on top of each serving.   My husband told me to make it exactly like that every time.  However, in the future, I will modify to decrease the calories and fat starting with replacing some of the half and half with milk.  I just won't tell him.

This recipe has great flavor but I would add more bacon and take out the dill weed. The dill weed gives it a weird smell and doesn't go over well with myself or my husband. It's also too thin for my liking, and I have tried on several occasions to thicken it up but cannot seem to find the magic ingredient to do so.

Followed the recipe exactly.  Did not work.  In fact, was not even close. Just got hard potatoes in liquid.  I am not a cook at all so I follow recipes. Tried one last week that worked. Tried this one, wasted a whole day. Extremely dissapointed.

The best tasting soup. Ever. I made a few changes. I skipped the water and used all broth (Not condensed-Organic). I split the half and half with heavy cream. I did not use evaporated milk either. I am making it again. Today. Adding broccoli and cauliflower as well. This recipe makes it so easy to add any of your own favorite veggies!

I ABSOLUTELY LOVE this soup. I made this with heavy cream instead of half/half and I didn't add the bacon till the end with cedar cheese. I have to say this was the FAV of all my family!! One even asked for it for her B-day dinner. YUM-YUm

I cooked my bacon in the oven since I don't like onions. I suggest letting the bacon rest on a paper towel for quite some time, since I could taste the bacon grease in mine. Loved this recipe though, turned into a chowder the next day even better :)

Followed this recipe right to the letter with the ingredients and it was a wonderful creamy and very easy potato soup! The only alteration I made was cooking it on high until it was time to put in the cream and milk and then switched to low for 45 min.  It turned out to be perfect and I will definitely make it again. Will be great for lunches this week!

Tried this and it turned out to be really "soupy" rather than thick and creamy. Other than that it still tasted pretty good. I'll just have to remember to add flour toward the end of cooking or figure something else out to get it thicker.

So easy and so delicious! I made some changes I added the bacon as a garnish. I didn't have cream or evaporated milk so just used 2 cups of 1 % milk. Didn't have condensed chicken soup so I used 2 and half cups of chicken broth. Everyone enjoyed enjoyed this even the picky eaters!

This soup was very good and easy to put together.  I made some changes to use what I had on hand.  Used frozen hash browns,  used 1 c. heavy cream and 1 c. milk.  Substituted an additional 12oz milk for the evaporated milk. Put half the bacon in with all ingredients and sprinkled half over each serving, along with grated cheddar.  Go lightly with salt if you are not using low sodium broth.  Next time I will add 1 c. frozen or fresh corn near the end of cooking time.  Definitely will make it with my changes again.

I loved it! I used red potatos. I chopped my onion up and put it in the crock pot raw along with 2 chopped carrots at the very beginning. I also used a pinch of parsly, dried basil, garlic salt, a little hot sauce. I didnt have white pepper so i just used a little black pepper. I did use all the other ingredients listed. I used the bacon as a garnish instead of cooking it in all day. I actually cooked my in a crockpot over night. woke up put in fridge then when i got home from work I put it on the stove and added the half and half, evaperated milk and flour and cooked for the 30 minutes. Turned out perfect!

Made this for my husband and the my brother and sister-in-law, and there wasn't a bite leftover! We all loved it! I didn't have any bacon so I substituted ham, and it was still great.

I always wanted to make potato soup, but never have time so thought this was fantastic that it was in the slow cooker. I did halve the recipe, but follow the directions exactly. It was good, but not fantastic. I added some more ranch, a bit of dill, and pepper to kick it up for my preference. Next time I will use a heavier cream as I had to add corn starch to make it as thick as I like. Still pretty good as is though.

Pretty good!  I did take some creative license & added some other ingredients.  I also put in some shallots & 2 cloves of garlic in as well.  And I didn't have half & half, so I used 4 cups of heavy cream.  Also to make it thicker, I put it in the blender to puree it for a few seconds.

I put my own spin on this by adding browned onions, more salt and some cayenne and other spices, but this was great.  Added some cheddar and bacon; phenomenal!  Adding to my book of favs.

So good! I followed the recipe except I took the advice of other posters and fried the bacon and then fried the onions after the bacon was done. I also threw some minced garlic with the onions.  Unlike what others were posting, I added the bacon in the beginning (as the recipe is written). I felt like it needed the bacon as a way to get depth of flavor. I also subbed the water and condensed chicken broth with 4 cups of chicken broth and 1 cup of water. Right before I added the cream for the last half-hour, I took a big spoonful of potatoes out of the pot and smashed them then threw them back in. It came out perfectly thick and creamy. Definitely a winner!

Absolutely amazing! Served this in sour dough bowls, such a filling meal. I cooked extra bacon on the side to use as bacon bits, topped with shredded sharp cheddar and chives. Most definitely a keeper.

Pretty good recipe. I did use the heavy cream instead of half and half as other reviewers suggested. I also added salt, used green onions instead of white onions and sprinkled chives on top. Easy to make but could have been thicker.

I just made this for dinner tonight and it was a huge hit!! The only thing I did differently was omit the bacon, and replaced it with about a cup of browned cubed ham. It came out fantastically thick and creamy. I served this with generous slices of the No Knead Beer Bread from here on this site, which paired together perfectly.

This is a fantastic potato soup recipe! We LOVED it! I used chicken bouillon cubes and water because I didn't have any cans of chicken stock on hand. I also just added the raw onion slivers in the soup instead of cooking them with the bacon. I'm so glad that I have leftovers for today's lunch. I will be making this recipe several times this fall and winter.

This recipe was delicious! The best soup by far I have ever made. I made it on the stove instead of in a crockpot as I was pressed for time. I placed the potatoes, water, chicken broth and seasonings into a stockpot over medium heat on the stove for roughly 1.5 hours and then added the half and half and evaporated milk and allowed to simmer for 30 mins. The soup was thick and creamy - I also added about of cup of shredded cheese and 1 cup of baby carrots. Such a big hit!

We really enjoyed this hearty, body-warming soup.  I usually make it a few days after making slow-cooked scalloped potatoes & ham, so that I can use the refrigerated leftovers in this dish.  Your website has spoiled my husband; he doesn't enjoy dining out at restaurants as much as he enjoys what is slowly cooking and filling the house with delicious aromas, here at home :D

Great recipe!  Very creamy with good flavor. I cooked the bacon at the end and sprinkled it on top of the soup when serving.  I also added some shredded cheddar to make a cheesy soup but the soup is very good plain or with cheese!

First I messed up putting the evaporated milk in with the chicken broth.

Other than that.... *Sensational*.  I served this with sliced beef tenderloin, and the combination was perfect.  This tastes like a liquid baked potato.

I saute thinly sliced leek, then add the potatoes, water, salt, broth and 2 sprigs of fresh thyme (which gives the soup a wonderful flavor).  No need to add flour.  Mash the potatoes after they are cooked and before you add the cream and the soup  will be of a good consistency.  Also, add black pepper for more flavor.  I haven't tried it with the bacon, but it sounds appealing to mo.

I gave this recipe four stars because I made it for a house full of boys and they gobbled it up with enthusiasm!  However, I felt it was just slightly bland for my taste.  The seasonings definitely need to be kicked up a notch.  

After reading some other reviews I chose to use heavy cream instead of half and half, but I wouldn't recommend doing this as my soup was very thick.  It also is best if you plan on consuming it right away, it doesn't appear to keep very well.

I'm a pretty bad cook, in fact I somehow manage to ruin most recipes, but in this case, this soup turned out fantastic and actually tastes better than the soup at my favorite returant. I did read a lot of the reviews for variations, and decided to cook the bacon last and added it at the very end. I also left out the dill weed since I had none on hand. I don't know what dill weed would have done to the taste, but I didn't miss it.

Good basic recipe.  Used all chicken broth and left out water, I didn't taste much of the dill. UPDATE: Made it again, this time doubling the batch.  It called for 1Tsp of pepper I used smoked pepper.  It was way too spicy.  Next time I will cut back to 1/2 tsp.

Very good recipe!!  Cooked as directed,but left out the bacon as my daughter is a Vegetarian and it was nice and thick.  Maybe a hint for the other reviewers that said the soup was thin, did you shake the Evaporated Milk, really shake it?  Anyway, super easy and next time, I'm adding carrots, celery and just adding the diced onions raw.

Made this on top of the stove and my husband loves it! I simply followed directions, then let it simmer on low for about an hour or so while I napped, and then got up and finished following directions. Nothing difficult. Took a big bowl to an elderly neighbor for her supper and she was delighted! This is definitely a keeper!

This was good but it ended up way too thick, it was more like mashed potatoes (I cut the recipe in half so maybe that was it?). I think the flour is unneccessary, and I just added some milk to it to thin it to more of a soup consistency.

the soup is good. I fried the bacon and saved it for garnish/topping though. I will probably keep trying other recipes to find the perfect potato soup but this one is a start.

Delicious, everyone in my family loved this soup. I didn't use the slow cooker, just did it on the stove which requires constant stirring so the cream doesn't burn, but well worth the work!!

This was a good base, however the soup was very hard to thicken in the croc pot. I think I'll just stick to making my potato soup on the stove.

Great staple recipe, but I decided to have a bit of fun with it.  First, I substituted 2 cups of heavy cream for both half/half and condensed milk.  Used spicy sausage instead of bacon and added extra ingredients throughout slow cooking time.  I added chopped carrots, MUSHROOMS and frozen spinach.  The mushrooms were not in my originally cooked soup, but realized how ideal of an addition it would make to this recipe. Add fresh bread to dip and shredded cheese to melt.  Enjoy.

Fantastic recipe!  All I changed was instead of the 2 cups of water I just added more chicken broth.  Next time I'm going to try it with ham.  I'm sure it will be just as wonderful.  Thanks for the recipe!

It could use a bit more spices to liven it up,and also It is creamier then longer you cook it.  But other than that we all enjoyed it and will definatly make again.

I love this soup recipe. It is the only potato soup I make and it is always a hit. The only thing I do differently is buy a package of cubed ham instead of bacon. I add the ham at the beginning and let it cook with the potatoes. Mostly because I HATE to cook bacon!!

Delicious soup. :)  I followed the steps pretty exactly, but added carrots and a dash of garlic.  The boy loved it, will definitely be making this again.  Seems perfect for a cold winter day.

i gave this 4 stars cuz i did not follow recipe so i dont know how the original tastes. But for my changes it was really good. I did not have 7 hrs so i just did a quick batch onthe stove. i used wheat flour and used black pepper and a little season salt. i did use bacon, onion and leftover ham and i topped it off with shredded cheese. DELISH it would be really good with broccoli in it too.... for next time!

Nice and easy potato soup recipe.  Like others, I did not put the bacon in at the beginning.  I just sauteed the onion in a little butter and also added some garlic to it.  I did not have condensed chicken broth, as specified in the recipe, so I used what I had -- 32 oz. of regular chicken broth and added four ounces of water.  Because of time constraints, I cooked this on high for around 4 hours and then added the half and half, evaporated milk and then some turkey bacon for the last half hour and turned it down to low.  If you like a very thick potato soup, this may not be the recipe for you.  My soup turned out somewhat like a broth, but just a little thicker, just the way we like it.  The recipe says it serves 6.  Yikes -- I would say its closer to probably 10 servings and it is VERY filling.  I do think it needs some other veggies and will probably add some carrots and celery next time.

This recipe is excellent. We loved it and so did our neighbors.  We ended up eating it a few days later, so, I do not know if that made a difference. We used russet potatoes.  The only change I made was that I did not "dice" all the potatoes, but made some chopped and some a little bigger just to get some consistency.  My husband (who does not want the same meal too close together) asked me to make it again within two weeks (that says something right there.)

I followed all the reviewers suggestions and it came out wonderfully!  I added the onions first and the bacon bits in the last 30 minutes.  I used half heavy cream and the rest half and half.  I also added potato flakes (maybe too many because it came out quite thick) and shredded cheese.  This is a very filling soup.  I used it as a side dish and everyone was full before they got to the steak.  Definetely a repeat!

I made this for Christmas Eve.  Everyone loved it even my very picky 14 year old niece.  It's now a bi-weekly staple in our house.  We don't eat meat so we cut out the bacon and it's still delicious!

Made this today and the only thing I changed was I doubled up on the bacon.......I have a weakness for the stuff! I ran home on my lunch break and started it and it was done by the time I came home. Perfect soup for the end of a cold blistery day. This recipe is a keeper.

This is excellent.  We make our own chicken broth using skin & bones of a store-bought rotisserie chicken, so I used 4 cups of broth instead of the canned broth & water.  I also used 1 Tbsp of minced onion since I didn't have an onion on hand.  I cooked 4 slices of bacon and cooked with the soup and made another 4 slices to crumble on top.  We also garnished with shredded cheese and ate grilled cheese sandwiches with the soup.  I will definitely make this again!

Excellant recipe.  My family loves potato soup and I serve it often.  Thought I would try this recipe as I really don't have a recipe that I use.  I just make it as I go.  But, I have to tell you that this recipe is great.  I do not ever thicken potato soup with any flour, though.  I just add instant potato flakes to thicken to our liking.  We also add cheese to each individual bowl along with more crisp bacon, chives and sometimes green onions.  Mmmmm....good!

Great recipe.  Omitted one cup of water.  Made for a great potato chowder and would make a good base for clam chowder.  Will make again.

My husband and I thought this soup was fine although not outstanding. However, it was easy to make and the kids gave it rave reviews. In my book that earns four stars! The only thing I did differently was to take a potato masher to it after adding the cream and evaporated milk and mash about half of the potatoes leaving the rest chunky.

I love the ingrediants in this recipe, but I changed it to a stove top recipe. I just cook it until the potatoes are soft then add the milk/flour mixture for the last five minutes or so. My family absolutley loves it!

By our family standards, this was not a very good soup.  I salvaged it with a good bit of shredded cheddar cheese and some added crushed red pepper flakes.  It's not a recipe I'll be using again.  Sorry!

This recipe is a fabulous basic potato soup.  I think it would be easy to add a variety of flavors to it (roasted garlic, other herbs, etc.) It needs more pepper definitely.  Overall though I really enjoyed this.  My husband ate three bowls!!

I made this yesterday during the first "fall-ish" day of the year. The family LOVED it! I used applewood smoked, thick cut bacon & it gave the soup a good flavor. Thanks for the great recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly and thought it turned out ok.  After following the advice of other reviewers and adding shredded cheese to my bowl of soup, it made quite a difference and was delicious!

This was the best potato soup I've ever tasted. The only changes I made was I used Chicken OXO just because I didn't have any Chicken Broth on hand. I eliminated the evaporated milk and just added more half and half. Then when close to being done, I added several tablespoons of cheese whiz. Not sure how much for sure, as I just tasted as I went along. Our friends were over for dinner he said it's just as good as his mothers potato soup and he says she makes the best.... I took that as a very high complement! Will definetely keep in my recipe folder for many more future dinners. Thick and creamy and cheesy.... so good! Thanks Shirley for submitting!

Pretty blah ~ was missing something.  I increased the amount of bacon (fried it separately from the onions) & used 2 cans of non-condensed chix broth plus 1c water.  I also used my immersion blender to puree some of the soup mixture to add some more substance.  Ended up doctoring it a lot ~ added red pepper flakes & a splash of hot sauce hoping for some sort of flavor.  Also threw in some sherry at the last minute, which was a surprisingly good choice ~ added some depth to the overall flavor (or lack thereof).  Garnished with shredded jack cheese, green onions & bacon.  Ended up being OK for a casual dinner but won't make it again.

This was delicious! I am not much of a bacon person, so I used ham instead. Otherwise did not change a thing! My whole family loved it, and when I took leftovers to work for my dinner there, my coworkers wanted it!
Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Pretty darn good as potato soup goes, but it needed cheddar cheese.  THAT made it perfect.

This was a big hit!  I didn't have a drop left to take to work for lunch :( .  I had this soup with the Greek Vegetable Salad and also the Bread Machine Garlic Bread recipe.
