I had to roast the veggies for about 35 minutes to get some color on them.  The eggplant really cooked down, so the next time I make this, I will cut a little larger than 1/2" cubes (ragu needs some substance).  Also, do yourself a favor and use a 12" skillet.  I ended up having to brown the sausage in two batches, and by the time I added the sauce ingredients, the 10" skillet was full (and I slopped sauce all over the stove stirring it).  Be sure to use a decent pasta sauce and red wine, as I think this is key to the rich flavor of the sauce. The fresh veggies really shine in this recipe.   Served this over penne, the chicken sausage was really tasty, and the sun dried tomato added another layer of flavor to this recipe.  Enjoyed this, and I definitely will make it again.  All in all, a pretty heart-healthy meal.

Made this last night and it really turned out well!  I followed the recipe as described - maybe went a little heavy on the zucchini but can you really have too much zucchini?  :)  This will definitely be made in the future at my house!

First off, the sausage is incredible! The food was very nice but the cooking time and portions of ingredients were a little off. Only use half an onion and double the amount of eggplant. Then, roast the vegetables in the oven for 35 minutes as another helpful reviewer suggested.

This was delicious!  My husband is hard to please and we both talked about this dish for hours.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect.  I plan on making it for the second time after less than a week.

What an amazing dish! I did use extra sauce (Silver Palate San Marzano Marinara - Sooo good for jarred sauce) & extra fresh basil. Recipe is full of flavor & color & we couldn't wait to eat dinner! Will make this again real soon!

Great way to use eggplant, tomato and pepper from your garden!  Followed the recipe exactly and served with grilled polenta...it was delicious.    Took about 10 min to dice everything up and then made the sauce while the veggies were roasting in the oven.  We will definitely be making this again soon!

What a great recipe.  Only change I made was to roast the veggies about 10mins. longer to get them browned and sweet.  Used Stop&Shop "Enjoy" storebrand Marinara
 sauce. Served it over mini penne and topped with Pecorino grated cheese.  Will do again, enjoy the different flavored chicken sausages.

This is one of the best recipes that I have tried on this site! It wasn't hard to follow and it turned out to be delicious. There wasn't a bite that I didn't like. We added a little zucchini and mushrooms to the vegetables because we didn't want them to go to waste in our fridge. We roasted them with the other veggies. We omitted the sun dried tomatoes because we didn't have them on hand. You will love this!

This was amazing!  Everyone at our house enjoyed this.  The kids asked for seconds and couldn't get enough.  The flavors were great and not overpowering.  You could add extra veggies if wanted. Would be great served along fried polenta.

First , I must tell the WORLD that al fresco chicken sausage is the very best chicken sausage I have ever eaten! I am a very rigid cook when it comes to buying quality foods. It must be the best to create an outstanding meal. Second, this recipe was delicous! A few changes just for personal preference. I added kosher salt to the veggies before roasting I also added a few quartered mushrooms to the mix. Used two tbsp of minced garlic, 1/2 cp chopped basil. Thank you, al fresco, for the opportunity to try your product!

Amazing! I'll admit I wasn't real excited about making this but I had gotten a free sample of a similar style sausage and this recipe came up in my search engine. So I bought all the ingredients and put off making it all week. Let me tell you, this recipe is now bookmarked as one of my new favorites! It. is. delicious. I made it exactly as it says and it was great!

I made this last night for the first time and loved it! Healthy and delicious.  I used Chicken sausage with sundries tomatoes and kale.  Also, I used more sauce and broth to make the rags more saucy. Lastly, I did salt the veg prior to roasting - good call, took about 30-35 mins to fully roast.  I served over rice - everyone had seconds!  Delicious!!

We added 1/4 box of penne and went with 2 cups of sauce after reading other reviews.  Roasted the veggies (baking sheet was FULL) for 35 min and could have gone even longer.  Excellent flavor and very filling.

This is delicious! I gave it 4 stars only because it lacks some seasoning. It really needs salt. I added salt to the veges. The sauce needs some salt as well. Other than that it was easy to make and the flavors blend nicely. Really like the ease of use with the al Fresco Chicken Sausage. Thanks for the great recipe!

Used Gilberts sundried & mozz chicken sausages and cut the olive oil to 2 TB.  Sprayed pan with Pam for browning the sausage.  This was a really great way to use up eggplant.  I did peel it first.

I haven't had great luck with dishes calling for eggplant, but I loved this one. It came together as a nice rice stew without needing any dairy or starch. Loved it.

We loved this.  It took some work since I also made the tomato sauce from our garden produce.  However, it turned out wonderfully and we had grown almost all the ingredients!

This recipe is a good option if you want to increase the amount of vegetables in your diet without eating cold salads. I used wild boar sausage that I purchased at the local farmer's market and served it all over pasta.  Next time I will be more generous with the garlic and herbs on the roasted vegetables.

My fiancé and I love this dish! I will sometimes make it day ahead of time and we eat it throughout the week. The 'leftovers' get better with time!
