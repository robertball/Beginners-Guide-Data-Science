This turned out pretty good. It was definitely light and refreshing but I'm not sure I loved the feta in there. I'd like to try this again with Colby or a more mild flavored cheese. Overall good recipe though and one you should give a try.

Substituted fresh Basil instead of parsley.  Everyone loved the salad.  Definitely make it again.
