Kale Pesto Pizza Muffin Haiku: "Made one for light lunch. (Saved extra 'pesto' for eggs.) Pizza not too bad!" I love kale in all its forms, and this was a new way to enjoy it, but I think it could've benefited from a little s&p or sprinkle of Italian seasoning. I was faithful to the recipe (reducing it to 2 english muffin halves just for my own lunch) and it was delicious and filling. The pesto that I had leftover I used in a mushroom/parm/tomato omelet the next day, and THAT was really good.
