The carrot cake with the cream cheese icing was awsome! I made it for the girls at work, and it was a big hit.The only thing I did change was I put in a pinch of allspice. I had enought batter to make one loaf and some cupcakes.

Great flavor and texture, spices just right and lemon juice and zest in icing perfect.  I reduced the sugar by a half cup and added one-quarter cup sweetened shredded coconut.  I also added 1 cup raisins microwaved for three minutes in two cups water with orange extract and sugar and then drained.  Recipe exactly filled a 9*13 cake pan.

I made this for my birthday cake and LOVED it.  Used the exact recipe.  Had no problem and I'd never made a cake from scratch before.  Awesome!

So far I've made this Carrot Cake 3 times and everyone has raved about it... making me a complete star in the kitchen!!  I did take some suggestions from other recipes.  For example I divided the sugar (1 cup white and 1 cup dark brown instead of 2 c. of all white sugar) and used slightly less crushed pineapple.  I'm going to make it again tomorrow but use a total of 3/4 c. canola oil and 1/4 c. chunky applesauce instead of the 1 1/4 c. oil.  I'm going to increase the cinnamon to 2 t.   For the icing I will use only use 2 c. confectioner's sugar and no lemon.  But I will add 1/4 c. chopped pecans. I really love Carrot Cake!!!

Great carrot cake and love a cake with pineapple.. it gives it a really nice flavor.    NOTE:  Magic baking powder is available in Canada and not the US.  I believe you can go online to order it, but I used regular baking powder in this recipe and had no issues.

I did not use this recipe for the cake but I did use the recipe for the cream cheese frosting.  We didn't like it.  BUT, I will say this.  In trying to cut our some fat/calories I used fat free cream cheese and I think that was probably the problem.  So, I would recommend following the exact ingredients in case it was because of using the fat free stuff!

Made this for my husbands birthday party.  It was so moist and delicious.  It was easy to make and everyone kept eating it, so I knew they meant it.  I did not put in cloves since they were so spendy I used a little allspice.  I also used a glass baking dish.   Got rave reviews at the party.

Philadelphia will love this... I only used the icing as a quick save to some crestfallen muffins. I scaled it down to do the few muffins I had, and it was a worthy save.Everyone thought that's how I MEANT for them to look and taste. Yea!

I wish I could rate the cake and icing separately.  The icing is..... AWESOME!  The tiny bit of lemon puts it over the edge.  The cake.... not so much.  I made exactly as instructed.  It was very very moist and beautiful but it really was tasteless.  It's not bad, it's just not good.  The icing is 5 stars for sure, but the cake is 3 stars at best.

I made this recipe GLUTEN FREE using Bob's Red Mill baking mix, and it was fantastic. I wasn't sure about the pineapple at first, but it proves to be a powerful surprise ingredient. Just wanted to let you guys know that the moisture in this recipe makes it great for translating to gluten free baking. Thanks!

Awesome!!  I used whole wheat flour because that is all that I had, and it was absolutely delicious!  The icing was incredibly good.  Will definitely be adding to my best recipe folder!!

It was fantastic, the only thing I would do differently is I would blend up the pineapple very, very fine.  I did not like the little chunks of the crushed pineapple that I used.  Tasted great just visually it was not as nice.

I totally loved it, THOUGH: I put more cinnamon (2-3 tbsp and put less sugar in the icing + it was the vanilla one) and it came out perfect! Those changes really make a difference. I've been making this cake for quite a while now, and it's always a hit!

Ok you have to try this for the icing. Omit the lemon and peel. Add the pineapple juice that you drained from the can of crushed pineapple. FAB FAB FAB!!

Made this recipe as written (less the lemon peel).  Everyone loved it.  The cake was still moist even after a few days.  Icing could be used in a variety of cake recipes.  This is a keeper.

I actually only used the icing recipe here, and it was perfect with a few modifications. I'm using it for pumpkin cookies, so I left out lemon juice and peel and used about a teaspoon of vanilla extract + TWO packages of cream cheese. It took all I had not to sit down with the bowl and eat it straight.  ;-)

I searched forever trying to find the perfect cake, decided on this one based off reviews & am so happy I did, HUGE HIT, everyone who has tried it has loved it.  I did cut the sugar in the frosting to 1 1/2 cups as mentioned and I decided to make it a 3 layer cake (8 inches) & baked for approx 30-40 mins, came out perfect, moist & yummy!!

I am only rating the icing here, as I did not make the cake.  It was FABULOUS, but I did make one change:  I did not have lemon on-hand, so I substituted 1 tsp lime juice and omitted the peel.  Still a great taste!  Also, for beginners out there, do NOT use a hand blender...unless you want powdered sugar all over your counter!!!

This recipe made it all the way to Sydney, Australia. Loved it! Loved! Loved it! I was actually just searching for a Philly Cheese Icing recipe when I stumbled across this absolute crowd pleaser! I made this last weekend for a group of friends. We all bring something to share for lunch and I took this Carrot Cake. Boy, was it a huge hit. I've just taken my second one out of the oven which I'm taking with me to a family reunion tomorrow. Thanks for posting this fabulous recipe- I joined just so I couild tell you how pleased I was.

I followed this recipe word for word. First of all, it stuck to my pans. Once I finally got it out, it was a little too sweet for me and really had no flavor at all.  The icing was a basic cream cheese icing, so it was good....hence the ONE star...but the cake was bland and boring. I will NOT make this recipe again.

Wonderful, moist cake - the only changes I made was that I omitted the nuts and instead added raisins that I had soaked in the drained off pinapple juice.  I also added some applesauce to the oil to cut down on the amount of oil.  I would make this again!

Just for the frosting!  Only had 1/12 cups icing sugar, and it was the perfect sweetness.  The splash of lemon juice is the secret weapon though!  My mom makes a similar cake all the time, and she raved about the icing :)

This recipe is AMAZING! I did add an extra 1/4 c of flour because the batter looked to soupy. This made the cake more fluffy than dense as the picture shows it to be. I took this to a picnic and everyone asked for seconds--there was nothing left.

This is the carrot cake that I always make. However I adjust the recipe a little bit because it is so high in calories.

 I cut out some of the oil and use about 3/4 cups oil and 1/2 cups pumpkin to moisten the cake.  I also cut the sugar in half. You don't need all the sugar because of the sweetness of the pumpkin, carrots and pineapple.
This way the cake is almost healthy! 
   The other thing I do is to use 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. The flavors of the brown sugar and the pumpkin give the cake a lot of character and a robust autumn flavor.
 I would imagine using the recipe as it is would produce a pretty good cake as well. It's just a bit too fattening.

I changed some things based on personal preference and it was amazing! I'll never try another recipe again. I used whole wheat flour, substituted sugar free applesauce for half of the oil, used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown, added 1 cup raisins (soaked in 1 cup water, microwaved for 1 minute, then drained), doubled the cinnamon to 2 T, and made the recipe into cupcakes which cut the baking time down to 18 mins. No need for the frosting...these are delicious and plenty sweet as they are!

This was a delicious cake, it was a huge hit at our church Christmas potluck lunch. However, I would reduce the amount of salt to almost no salt. But otherwise, it was moist and tasty!

This carrot cake turned out super moist! I improvised a bit, using about 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar. I didn't add pineapple, and I didn't make frosting. Next time I will use even less sugar, it was plenty sweet as is.

Just a quick tip. If you're in a hurry substitute 2 jars of junior carrots. I always use the Gerber brand.

Years ago I had a great recipe for a moist carrot cake and when we renovated our home I lost it. I used my recipe for years and always had great compliments, I was disappointed that I lost it. Then I found this recipe, I have used this recipe about 6 times already. The only minor adjustment I made was cutting back the sugar to 1 1/2 cups. This recipe is almost exact...Great recipe!!

I used olive oil (1 cup)  and coconut oil (1/4 cup). I didn't have enough grated carrots and not enough crushed (fresh) pineapple but alhamdulillah it turned out fine. I used only one cup of icing sugar for the cream cheese frosting. I think I would also use less sugar for the cake. I didn't have nutmeg and pecans either. Alhamdulillah I think it turned out fine, very VERY moist.

I made this exactly according to the directions, tested it for doneness at the earliest time and the toothpick came out clean. I gave it another 5 minutes in the oven after that and then removed it. After cooling in the pan, when I turned it out onto the cooking rack the whole thng collapsed! What a mess! It all ended up in the garbage.
