This is my favorite all-time drink! I always start out with this one...it's a classic and it's really good. It's not too strong and it's clear and makes a nice presentation when a cherry or sliced orange is in the glass. This is defenitely a 5 star drink. Thanks Micah...for bringing this recipe here so people can enjoy it. Now I have the pleasure of making it at home....I won't even have to go out.

Tom Collins - My favorite drink. Try it with Cherry 7Up instead of the soda water.

I tried this Vodka Collins recipe a few times and I just couldn't get it to taste like a true Vodka Collins.  I would need to add a little something here or there to make it just right.  I truly enjoy a good Vodka Collins but I just couldn't get this recipe to provide one. Sorry  =(

It's such a sweet tasting drink.  Reminds me of an amaretto sour.  I also add a dash of grenadine.  Some suggest putting Cherry 7-Up to add an even more sweeter, cherry flavor.  Either way, it's a very simple drink and the vodka taste is not overpowering at all.

Easy to make and refreshing.  I also tried it with a splash of grenidine and that was tasty.  Next time I think I will add a touch more sweet and sour mix.

Oh, these are DANGEROUS on a hot day! I made ours with sugar free sweet and sour mix, and had to force myself not to go back and make a second round.

This was pretty good. It did seem a little bland, I might cut the water in half next time.
