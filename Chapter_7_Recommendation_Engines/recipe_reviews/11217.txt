This recipe turned out better than I thought it would. While beating the ingredients together the mixture seemed too for lack of a better word gooey. I did not add anything to it but decided to see how it would turn out. Sure enough it did. However instead of dropping teaspoon fulls onto the baking sheet I used a more creative approach. I found a medium sized heart cookie cutter sprayed it with pam and placed it on the baking sheet and filled it with the meringue. I smoothed the top then slid the cookie cutter away from the meringue and the meringue held its shape through cooking. My advice though wait until they are completely cool to handle because they will break and the chocolate will cause a mess so just be patient until they cool.

OHMIGOSH! Surprised indeed! I made as stated and also added 1/4t cornstarch (for a stabilizing agent) and used powdered sugar vs. granulated sugar. I also added appx 1 cup of flaked coconut! They were fantastic! My husband said they were addictive and my son said they were awesome! They disappeared quickly! The chocolate and coconut were great together! The parchment paper really made for easy cleanup! Thanks for such a wonderful post! We'll be making these often! Next time I may also add 1T cocoa powder for a chocolate overload!

This is the exact same recipe I've used for many many years. In fact it's the first cookie I ever made. I triple the recipe (but only double the amount of choc. chips). I bake mine on double thickness of paper towels rather than parchment. Makes lots of cookies but boy they go fast. I get compliments every time I make them. My very favorite cookie to take anywhere. But beware they are very fragile!

These treats are as lighter than feathers! I changed the recipe a bit though. Made two kinds one without chocolate and one with. I added 4 tbs of sugar into the ones without chocolate; they were just perfect crunchy on the outside and a tiny bit chewy within perfect. I thought the chocolate ones were a bit on the rich side though and I used less than the recipe called for. Maybe it's because I ran out of chocolate chips and used chunks instead. But I'll definitely make them again without the chocolate perhaps.

These were great and super easy. I used crushed walnuts instead of chocolate chips. Foil worked instead of parchment paper as well.

This recipe was a bit disappointing. I used less sugar than the recipe called for and half the amount of chocolate chips yet my meringues still ended up pretty sweet. The texture was nice and light full of air in the way meringues should be. I had used another meringue recipe for another batch of meringues so I guess I had too high of a standard going into this meringue challenge. I don't think I'll use this recipe for a while. It tasted a bit like wet cotton candy...

An easy and delicious recipe. I used unsweetened coconut instead of chocolate chips and did not have parchment paper so I sprayed the pan as I would for any cookie. They came out fine.

these are great especially if you replace the chocolate with 2 tbsp of cinnamon sugar they will taste a lot like a snicker doodle don't worry if they crack a little they still taste grand. good luck
