great recipe! very simple I cook jamaican curry chicken about 5 times a year. Not often the breast. So I used this recipe just spooned the outed extra oil and simmered down for a longer time so the gravy could thicken. also u could add small pieces of potato to the simmering process. it will help thicken gravy and make it more hearty!

just wanted to add that a Jamaican would never make curry using breast meat of the chicken only. The bones give off flavor.

This recipe was delicious ! I may say, I put a little pepper on the chicken for added seasoning. I added like 4 more tablespoons of curry powder. I also added to bay leaves with the water, a little more salt, 4 red potatoes peeled and cubed , and 4 thin carrots sliced. I took  advice from other people here that commented and made my own ( thank you for your comments !!)

I love, love, love this recipe. I didn't feel like cutting up tomatoes, so I used diced canned tomatoes and I used ground red pepper instead of a habanero pepper. I will definitely make this again!!

This recipe came out great. Only thing I did different was adding a bit of Ginger Powder and using Coconut Oil instead of veggie oil. Was delish!

Good base recipe! I made some modifications like other reviewers - doubled the amount of curry, added 1/2 cup chopped orange and green peppers, used a 14oz can of coconut milk instead of water, added 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup of baby carrots and 1/2 cup of chopped potatoes. Served over brown rice. It was delicious, and I'll definitely make it again!

Added red peppers and jalapeños instead of habenero pepper. Also put in steamer baby potatoes at the end. It was delish and my family was fighting over the leftovers.  This recipe has made my recipe book.

After reading the reviews , I followed a few suggestions and made a few changes on my own.  I used a couple of teaspoons of butter instead of oil.  I used a can of diced tomatoes.  I used frozen onions and green peppers.  I didn't have habanero so I used jalapeno.  I added more curry and thyme than was called for.  Probably a bit heavy on the garlic as well.  Hubs had cayenne out for what he was cooking so I tossed some of that in as well.  I also (thanks to those that suggested it!) used coconut milk instead of water and added pineapple.   I was afraid it would be too spicy for me, but it was awesome.   I'll read more reviews and try more changes, I don't think much can hurt this recipe.  This one is a definite keeper!

Very tasty and even better the next day. Used chicken broth instead of water and 1/2 can small tomato paste instead of tomato and a touch of light cream and 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes.
Yum!

My family and I loved the recipe! They could not stop talking about how delicious it was.  They actually thought the meal was ordered from a restaurant!  I don't get a chance to cook very often but when I do, I would like to make it special for the family.   The only change I made in the recipe is that I used coconut milk in lieu of water.   I made Jasmine rice which sealed the deal!

I'm on a low sodium diet, and have been trying to find ways to get some flavor without salt.  I've never made anything with curry before, and this recipe sounded promising.  I ended up using a single 8oz chicken breast, an onion, a yellow bell pepper, 4 mushrooms, a russet potato, 1 tbsp of minced garlic, 3 tbsp of curry powder, a 1/4 tsp of thyme, a can of Rotel diced tomatoes and chilis, and half a can of pineapple chunks and juice instead of water.  It was absolutely awesome!  Thank you for the inspiration.

This recipe is really easy and tasty.  The recipe gravy is a little thin for me,  so I add 2 tbsp. of Tony Chacheres Roux mix.  I also added 3 tbsp brown sugar to round the flavor or a bit.  Very good.

I doubt this is in tradional recipes, but my husband's mother always added currants to her curry. I added probably about a third of a cup to the recipe it gave it a refreshing sweetness.  Even without, it would have been great I'm sure!

Wonderful dish! I opted to add green beans and whole mushrooms ,  didn't have habanero so a bit of cayenne did the trick! Definitely will try with potatoes next time. Thank you for the tips!!

Very easy to prepare and it was delicious! I added coconut milk, snow peas, baby corn, and a potato. It was served over white rice.  I will definitely be making this again.

Made this tonight. Added sliced carrots and a diced potato. Family loved it. Recommend more salt. A pinch is definitely not enough.

I think I would cook it uncovered next time.  There just seemed to be too much liquid.  Everything else was spot on.  I made some fresh naan bread to go with it and it was very good.

I followed the directions exactly except instead of using 1 fresh tomato I used 1 can of tomatoes drained. This recipe didn't taste authentic. But mu daughter did love it. To me it tasted like it was missing something.

I made this recipe with a couple tweaks of my own. I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil.. used the coconut milk instead of water.. added a much larger portion of curry powder. I think next time I will season my chicken prior to throwing into pan. Loved this recipe though!

Next time I will use coconut milk instead of water and cut down on the oil.

Made this with the below modification:
coconut milk instead of water
added Jamaican all spice, brown sugar, thyme,rosemary, smoked paprika, scotch bonnet pepper sauce.
Defiantly didn't use boneless chicken. Chicken thighs with the skin removed gets it done here. Served with fried plantains and white rice.

I made a few adjustments to the recipe.  I finally perfected it to taste the way I wanted it to taste.  I double the recipe because I like a lot of sauce.  I make it with chicken or pork tenderloin.  It is so good!

Hey Y'all, I made it and the bomb.com if I may say so... I substituted the coconut milk w/ half & half ( b/c I had no coconut milk left in my cupboards..lol), I used scotch bonnet peppers instead of the habanero pepper, I also added scallions & all spice.  ( Cant wait to prepare it again w/coconut milk tho ) ;-)

Easy and delicious. Like other reviewers, I tweaked the recipe but it was delicious. I used 8 chicken thighs, two 14oz cans of diced tomatoes, cayenne instead of the peppers, I threw in 8 small red potatoes cubed, and 4 carrots. I added about a cup of water, and at the end finished it off with some cream, but I just eyeballed that. Since I increased the volume of everything (I wanted leftovers) I increased the garlic (3 cloves), and the curry spice (3 heaping tbsp). I did season the chicken thighs with some of the curry spice and browned them first. It's a keeper!

I substituted the vegetable oil with butter flavored coconut oil, water with coconut milk, fresh tomato with canned diced tomatoes, added more nutmeg, ginger, garlic, and salt as suggested by other reviewers. I didn't have a habanero or scotch bonnet pepper, so I used a serrano pepper. I cooked the curry seasoning in the oil for a couple of minutes, before adding the other ingredients. I threw in cubed pieces of yellow potatoes. It was plate licking delicious!

I tripled the recipe (except for the habanero peppers...didn’t want to make it over spicy) because I food prep for a week and needed it to last at least 3 days for one of my meals.  With that said, I substituted coconut oil for vegetable oil to mitigate the fat intake for healthier fats. I also added turmeric  (1 tsp approx.) for added flavor and again health benefit of natural versus suppliment form. I only added 1/2 cup more of water to the original recipe having increased the amount of chicken to not over saturate or water down the flavors and let it simmer until the chicken was tender. Lightly seasoned with sea salt and cracked black pepper once done and served  over organic wild rice and my vegetable of choice for the day (green beans, broccolini or asparagus). Yum

I added a can of coconut milk instead of water, used tomato paste instead of tomatoes, I also added 1 tbsp of Goya sofrito,     1 tbsp Mezzetta cilantro & parsley chimichuri,  1 tsp of Walkerswood jerk seasoning (hot & spicy), Knorr concentrates homestock (chicken flavor), 0.5 tbsp Badia Sazón tropical. It was delicious and fairly easy. I needed more flavor than the original recipe called for so I added my own spin on it. I would make it again.

Absolutely delicious! Sincerely impressed my boyfriend (who thought I couldn't cook). I did make some changes. I added three eggs, some broccoli, and some cauliflower to the chicken & veggie mix. I also used a curry sauce mixed with a pumpkin and butternut squash sauce (both of which I bought from Trader Joe's) instead of using the powder.

Really tasty but too salty for my liking and I love salt.  Next time I make it I will cut the salt in half and adjust as needed.  I think I would probably add another potato to the mix and some cubed tomato.

I  love this recipe as a base! Jazzed it up a bit with “a likkle” island flavors  and added some coconut cream, fresh thyme, scotch bonnets, scallions, ginger and carrots.  Leftover are tasty once all the flavors marry. It freezes well also! Yummm!

The recipe was simple and easy. The taste was amazing.  I really enjoyed the flavor and my boyfriend loved it so much,  I made it a couple days later for him.

Good recipe. Fast and easy to prepare. Kids liked it. I used a different recipe for my curry chicken before but will be using this one as my go to when running short on time. Very good!

Turned out great I only had one chicken breast to cut up and use. Served over white rice as seen in my photo. 2 chicken breast cut up nicely would be great for this recipe if you don’t want to deal with bones. I would add as some people said bay leaves and pepper

Had to eliminate tomatoes due to an allergy. Also used skinless boneless chicken thighs. My husband loved this dish.

Family enjoyed it and the only change I made was double the recipe because I used 4 chicken breast and add two tablespoons of sugar. Lots of gravy, tender meat  and not spicy which is key in my  household.

I made this before going in to work today.  I made everything according to the recipe.  I also added a chopped Yukon potato, snap peas, celery, and baby carrots.  My co-workers loved it, as did I.  The spice factor was perfect.  I'd highly recommend it as a quick go-to option.
