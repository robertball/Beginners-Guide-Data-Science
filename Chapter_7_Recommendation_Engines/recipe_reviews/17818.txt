This recipe was very good and quick.  It also used very simple items I already had in the cupboard so nothing special was needed.  The kids loved it.  I made a pasta salad on the side and had a great meal.

I found this recipe to be very surprising.  I didnt know what to expect, but the flavor was quite good.  I did remove some of the sauce once the chicken was done so to make it not so overpowering.

The meat was tender.  I used fresh onion and garlic but it came out a bit bland.  I added salt to compensate.  Not bad.

i was NOT impressed with this recipe.  the ingredients sounded like they would create a good flavor, but it did not.  the drummettes were cooked through but i would not recommend this recipe to others.  Sorry!

Love this recipe very quick and easy.. I added more seasonings to my chicken as I always do, to give it my own flavor. Next time I will use only one can of the soup with a little bit of water to cover chicken. I garnished chicken with green onions and served yum so good

This was ok. I used a homemade version of tomato soup to keep it gluten free. Method is perfect!!

Pretty good but the tomato soup makes it a little sweet for my taste.  Next time I will do one can of soup and one can of tomato sauce.  And maybe some herbs.
