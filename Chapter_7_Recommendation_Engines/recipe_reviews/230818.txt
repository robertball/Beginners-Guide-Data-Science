I tried this with cold, leftover pork chops.  I liked it so much that I blogged about it.  Here's my blog to read how I put a bit of a spin on it.   http://1organizedmomma.blogspot.ca/2013/04/leftovers-yummy.html

If you find this bland use these tweaks. I've made this a number of times. Beat eggs & add 1/8 tsp sesame oil. Scramble eggs in hot pan & set aside. Saute onions, garlic, & ginger in a little oil & remove. Cook minute rice in microwave & save yourself some time. Put pork, sesame oil, soy sauce, & hoison sauce (tbs) in hot pan & saute till cooked. Add rice to pan with pork as well as eggs & sauted veggies etc & mix well over heat. Now it's flavorful & tastes much like take out.

This is pretty good but needs a lot more rice - at least for us.  I used fresh garlic and fresh ginger which adds a lot to the nice fresh flavors.

Made this with leftover porkchops that I ground in the Cuisinart.  I used Bragg's instead of soy sauce to make it gluten-free.  Doubled the recipe and it turned out delicious!

It's true that what they serve as take out doesn't taste like real fried rice. I'd never had it before let alone made it, and it was a winner! I upped the butter, used a bag of frozen mixed veggies, half a Vidalia and the chicken from one of the drumsticks I was making as the main course. For a little extra chicken flavor I poured some broth over the veggies and let it cook off. I also used more rice and increased the ingredients for the last step.

Made this to use leftover Grilled Turkey Tenderloin and leftover brown/wild rice. Used, in this order. Two eggs, scrambled flat, removed from pan, then sliced thin. Onions, carrots, mushrooms. Then broccoli, orange sweet pepper, shredded cabbage. Soy sauce, turkey, rice, eggs. Yummy!

This was very tasty but does need some changes in measurements for our taste.  I used 3 green onions, fresh garlic & ginger - lots more than 1/8 tsp & 2 cups rice.  I didn't use pork as I was just looking for a rice side dish.  The broccoli & carrots were really good in this dish.   Using gluten free soy sauce (Bragg) makes this a good GF choice.

GREAT dinner... rather than use the veggies in the recipe, I added added a 1 lb. bag of frozen "Stir Fry Sugar Pea Blend" after changing the serving size to 8.  It was a big hit with my grandchildren... they loved it :-).  Wouldn't hesitate to make this recipe again.  Simple to make and most enjoyable!

Very good fried rice!  Very versatile recipe as well.  I substituted a can of cut baby corn for the broccoli, minced red onion for the green onion and minced garlic instead of powder, because that's what I had on hand.  I also used sesame oil instead of butter. I habitually do not measure ingredients precisely, but I probably doubled the soy sauce and ginger.  Next time I make it, which I surely will, I will use green onion and broccoli and maybe fresh ginger.  Thanks Olies for a good fried rice recipe that's easy, quick and delicious.

I couldn't believe how good this recipe is and how easy. I used left over cooked pork loin roast, 1/2 c of the veggies, 2 green onions, 1.5 cup of brown Thai cold cooked rice and a frozen ginger cube. Best fried rice I ever made! All with left overs. Amazing.

I'll give it two instead of 1 because maybe I did something wrong. This was terribly bland. I even added extra salt and white pepper and made some sweet and sour sauce. There just was no flavor to it.

A little more work than required, ok start.  Fried Rice is kind of like a Stew, anything works, so don't hesitate to throw in Veggies from Corn to Green Beans...Tofu works great, as does any other Meat from Steak to Chicken.

A little more work than required, and don't hesitate to use a Skillet if you don't have a Wok.  Don't bother to remove the Protein and Veggies after cooking for a few minutes; create a circle/hole in the middle of the veggies and add the Eggs.  You shouldn't need to cook this much longer than a couple of minutes after the Eggs are done, not 7-10 minutes.

Typically, Chinese fried rice is seasoned with toasted sesame oil.  Sesame oil is the flavor that gives the fried rice the umame flavor that is missing in this rice.  One might as well have just called this recipe American fried rice.   Also, typically, the pork that is  best  used is BBQ pork loin sliced very thinly.     There are specific recipes to achieve this kind of pork.  Fried rice is also typically bland because  it is meant to accompany other dishes and is especially good with Schezwan  dishes which are often spicy.  Many people who make this a main dish meal often pile on the veggies as I would do also.  Broccoli is not used usually.
This dish can be made with leftover rice or dry roasted rice so that it comes out fluffy.  Basmati or Jasmine rice are best.  It is apparently human nature to try and improve something that doesn't need it.  Ex is Chinese and husband for over 20 years, I've had a lot of Fried rice. :)

This recipe is about as close as I have found to restaurant pork fried rice.  I doubled the rice, green onions, garlic and ginger as many reviews suggested.  Glad I did.  I also tossed in an extra bit of soy sauce as I had more rice.  Very tasty.  Thank you for sharing!  Will be making it again and again.  Great recipe for left over pork that you are not sure how to recycle.

I didn't have onion on hand so used dry and added mushrooms and snow peas.  Doubled the rice and everything and it was tasty!  Also used ginger paste.  Would do this again.  Kids loved it.

This a great recipe to use as a basis. I could tell it would be bland so I marinated the pork chunks in soy sauce for a few hours. I added the spices to the pork and vegies and then again when I added the rice.  I put soy sauce in to my liking and tossed one last time in the wok before servings. Turned out great. Four stars is because I did add more things.

I made this recipe to avoid using package mixes, I was very happy to taste that this recipe is fantastic.  Ready to try it using different meats or even a "house" style.  Also loved that the ingredients were recognizable and I could shop at my local store.

I usually hate pork fried rice. I have always gone out of my way to avoid ordering anything that comes with pork fried rice. When my family asked me to make pork fried rice this month, I hesitantly agreed and then I planned an entire meal around pork fried rice so that I wouldn't have to eat it. I made chicken teriyaki with this as a side dish. So after reading the reviews, I found that I needed to change up the recipe a bit. Not a problem, I'm  good at that. I went and bought all the food and the night before and while cutting up the chicken to marinate, I decided to cut up two pork chops and marinate them as well. I even threw in the cinnamon stick with the pork. This food tasted AMAZING. I scarfed down that pork fried rice like nobody's  business.

Delicious!  I doubled the recipe all except for the pork (because I only had one, fairly large, chop left) and I skipped the green onion and broccoli because I didn't have any on hand.  It made 2 servings as a main dish and 4 servings as a side dish. It was a huge hit and was absolutely the perfect thing to use up the leftover pork chop and rice I had in the fridge. I will definitely make this again!

Actually, this was a great basic recipe that can be perverted to ones own personal tastes quite easily. And if the author had not left out what the heck I am supposed to do with these frozen peas, it might have given it 5 stars!

The only veggies I had on hand were carrot and onion, but it turned out great anyway. I adjusted the serving size to five for my family and used about 2 and 1/2 cups rice. The key to getting enough flavor is adding more soy sauce. Great way to use up leftover porkchops!

A very nice base for fried rice, the proportions were good! I had never made it before and it turned out very nicely. I added some sriarcha for a kick and used a small amount of coconut oil in the pan. I like egg and would double it next time.

This was really tasty. I had some leftover pork chops that needed to be used up and had made extra brown rice the night before. We did leave out the broccoli because I didn't have any on hand. This was simple, easy, and quick to throw together. We will definitely make this again.

this was tasty.. instead of rice i used grated cauliflower as well as low sodium soy sauce.. i used 1/4 cup for 4 servings trying to compensate for it being low sodium but it was on the salty side.. so 2 T would have probably been enough.. only used one egg but followed everything else to a T.. served this over ramen noodles for bf and added some sauteed mushrooms (i thought of those after i had finished my bowl) and i had mine straight up.. he added some sriracha and it was a good addition.. ty for the recipe

This looks good! I will be making this with quinoa instead of rice and substitute the peas for edemame, and use gf soy sauce and use fresh garlic.

I make this all the time!  It is a five star recipe exactly as is, but I will share some things I do sometimes to change it up/make it easier.  I always use at least day old rice.  I also always use frozen mixed veggies (corn, green beans, carrots, peas).  Soooo easy.   I use whatever protein I have on hand (chicken, pork, sausage, steak, sometimes just extra eggs). For the addition of eggs,  I make an omelette into which I grate fresh ginger (kept in the freezer) and garlic.   Like I said, I have made it many times just as stated and it is superb.  I thank this recipe for helping me to realize that I can successfully make delicious fried rice at home!

Great one-dish meal!  I added sliced celery, substituted edamame for the peas,  added 2 tsp. finely chopped fresh ginger to the vegetable-pork mixture while they sauteed. (Omitted the ginger powder.) Next time I'll add sliced shiitakes.  Yum!

I just made it and followed the directions exactly.  However I didn’t have ginger on hand so I used a Chinese Five Spice blend and it’s wonderful anyway,.  This was very easy and most of the ingredients I have on hand most days.  Thanks!

Anything can be added. Having left over pork makes it easy to make .

Made this with leftover pork loin chops. Instead of the veggies I used frozen harvest hodgepodge vegetables from trader joes. I used their white basmati rice too. I omitted the ground ginger and added sesame oil (1/2 tsp for doubled recipe) and it was divine. Next time I'll try adding some toasted sesame seeds.

This is an easy & quick recipe.  I also added some frozen Asian vegetables and before anything else I stir fried some garlic & fresh ginger ( about 1 tablespoon of each) and then add the rest as called by the recipe and it all came out "deliriously delicious".  We where all delighted and all had second servings so I will be using this recipe when ever we want some Chinese food at the table.

Made a few changes, based on what the other reviews said - I  used 2 eggs and used chopped red pepper and some chopped celery (added at very end) instead of the broccoli.  I also omitted the peas and added a touch of Chinese 5-spice.  I found that adding chopped/jarred garlic, instead of powdered was good.  The one thing to remember - no matter what your version is - is to use Jasmine rice - that is the only way it will taste like the real takeout does!  Great recipe - Thanks!

I just made this for dinner tonight, with a few substitutions to use what I had (it's the coldest night of the season, and I wasn't going out for anything!). I subbed frozen mixed vegetables  and a mixture of arborio rice and quinoa, and did not need the extra butter when I cooked the veg because of their water content. I just wound up warming the veg and the pre-cooked pork together, then spooned in the rice and seasonings, and I did cook the egg flat in a small pan and cut it into strips before mixing it in as another reviewer suggested. It was a very light and satisfying meal which I'll probably make again this week cause I still have some more leftover pork loin and rice/quinoa mix.  I knew it would go over well when my husband was making yummy noises (what are you cooking? It smells great!) before he even sat down.  I've never had "real" pork fried rice (I.e. At a restaurant), but we enjoyed this very much. Thanks for sharing!

Totally changed it up, and it was great! I would have done 5 stars if the instructions for the peas where there. I used chicken thighs, cabbage instead of broccoli, added the green onions with the eggs to make them more firm and used fresh garlic and grated ginger. I also used rice noodles. I doubled some of the ingredients and quadrupled the meat. It was all eaten, not a drop left.

Great recipe. Modified it using oriental vegetables, chicken or steak(steak tastes better imo), and used a lot more rice and soy sauce. Would definitely recommend to any college student, you can make a hefty amount of this stuff, just add more rice, vegetables, and meat, and you are set for the week. I make this on Sunday and it lasts until Wednesday.

I love Pork fried rice & i worked at the Beijing resteraunt years ago. this is way too bland.  I marinate the pork in white wine garlic & ah so sauce for 24 hours .  I also put hoisen sauce in the rice after all the ingredients are in the wok.  I put 2 scrambled eggs cooked in too & a bunch of cooked peas too.  It's delicioso.  You could also add 1/2 cup of stir fry sauce , i do.  
 Happy cooking.  T.M.Z.

This was a hit. Prepared converting the recipe to 4 servings.  I upped the rice a bit...and...added in some additional vegetables that were languishing in my refrigerator.  The fact that powdered ginger was used was a plus.  Every time I use fresh ginger it comes across too strong.

I'm going to give this recipe 5 stars even though mine was like a 3.5-4 only because I used rice-a-roni instead of regular rice. I think this dish would have been a 5 had I used normal rice. Excellent quick and easy! My picky boyfriend even enjoyed it with the mistake :)

Great recipe.  I made this and added mushrooms, onion, bean sprouts, garlic and red and yellow peppers.  Loaded up with the veggies!  Stir fried, and heated up leftover pork roast cubes - removed, then the egg in some oil, and re-added veggie/port mix, 4-5 c. of cooked rice, the soy sauce, ginger and some salt and pepper.  Just tossed it all around and really - so fabulous!

I would definitely do this with leftover chicken, turkey or beef.  You could also put it in a baking pan and broil it for a few minutes for an easy paella.  Thanks for a great meal on a busy night!

Made this tonight following exact recipe (doubled it) and used left over pork chops. Oh, one exception, I did not have green onions, so used some onion powder. It was very good.  My husband who doesn't like to stray from the normal rotation was impressed as well.   It was nice because I had all of the ingredients and it was pretty easy.  I've made Pork Fried Rice in the very distant past but this one seemed easier and tastier.  Thanks. I'm happy to have found another entry into the rotation.

Pretty good but too many ingredients... takes away the taste of pork. Made slight changes afterward by chopping up a leftover pan fried, then oven baked chop in the same cast iron shallow skillet with all of the residual tasty bits, the added cold left over rice and a little soy sauce. 3 ingredients but oh so good. yummy

This recipe was fairly bland. We made significantly more than the recipe called for, but even using the same proportions there was not enough flavor.. Perhaps fresh ginger would make a good addition. The recipe also calls for peas and in the instructions says green onions. We added half a white onion to the veggies while they cooked. There is definitely room for improvement.

This was very good. I used leftover pork chops and doubled  the ingredients. I also added some mushrooms and a tomato that needed to be used. Also fresh garlic and ginger. Finally,  I added about 1/4 tsp. of red pepper flakes.

The broccoli was overpowering so I was very disappointed as I love fried rice.   It just doesn't belong there.   I added it at the very end so was very careful that it wasn't overcooked but still all I could taste was broccoli.  Should have served it on the side.

This was really good. I made it as stated but left out the broccoli because I really don't think I've ever had broccoli in my fried rice. I also used brown rice. I really like this recipe because it tastes healthier and lighter than others I've tried. I'll make it again just like I did this time.

This recipe was great! I increased veggies to 1/3 cup and added 1/3 cup of diced summer squash. I also doubled the rice, added more soy and a heavy of drizzle of olive oil at the end to increase moisture. Also I did all of this in one pan after sautéing the vegetables I move them out of the center of the pan and put in two whisked eggs (instead of one) then as it cooked mixed it back in with the sautéed veggies from around the edge of the pan and then added rice and remaining ingredients.

As many others have said, this is a very bland recipe.  It is meant for those who have the  very basic ingredients onhand.  If you're going to make chinese  dishes, keep some oyster sauce and sesame oil in the pantry.

This is fine, but a little bland. I added sesame oil as others suggested. It is a good use of extra pork , but I wouldn't make this as my first use of pork (e.g., one night, slow cook a porkloin for pulled BBQ pork, save half for this before adding BBQ).  I'd probably add more ginger or introduce garlic sauce.

I will be using this from now on. I made this exactly as the recipe called for.  I omitted the broccoli and added sweet yellow onions chopped wide. I also used left over pork chops and left over baked chicken that was well seasoned. I turned out delicious.

I used a wok and pushed all of the ingredients aside.  Then I added a little more butter to the side of the wok to scramble the egg to save a step.  I would use this recipe for leftover chicken, beef, shrimp, anything!

This was EXCELLENT. The only changes I made was I used up a Chinese marinated pork chop instead of cooking the pork from scratch and added that and fresh ginger and garlic to the cooked vegetables (instead of powder). My husband LOVED it!!!

So apparently in my house this serves two!  I did shove two tablespoons in my face before the boys ate it all and my daughter wanted something else thank goodness!  They loved it and I would have eaten a bowl joyfully. I have to make gluten free and it was great. Tripling it next time.

It got eaten so fast, I made it again the next day! I just omitted the broccoli because I didn’t have that on hand. I added in extra egg than it called for. I had leftover pork chops from the day before, so I just pulled the meat apart on them and used that. I thought I had frozen peas but turns out I didn’t, so I just substituted a can of peas instead. Still came out really good. So simple to make.

I did everything as instructed except the frozen peas. Step #1 added the peas and the last step added the peas again. I knew better and did not add in the first step.They would have been mushy and taken over the taste of the whole dish. Otherwise, it was great! BTW the cooked rice I used was cooked in Veg. broth which gave it an extra zing. Thanks

Good.  I used chopped up leftover pork roast and added it after sauteeing the vegetables.  I used brown basmati rice and increased all quantities.  2/4 kids ate, which is a win around here these days.

I made so many changes,  but still a good recipe to get the idea of ingredients needed. I used more rice & veggies. Cooked the pork loin in the crock pot w/ chopped ginger, onion and chicken broth, then shredded it after cooking. other reviews mention sesame oil & hoisin, I'll give that a try next time.

Flawless recipe for those who like the original recipe, but I had to adjust it for three leftover barbecue pork chops and nearly half a saucepan of leftover rice. We had frozen peas and broccoli in the freezer.  It needed much more than the suggested garlic and ginger powder.  I threw in nearly as much fish sauce, and a tablespoon of szechuan peppercorn powder and, seriously, 4 tablespoons of Chinese Hot Oil. It wasn't very spicy at all, but seriously umami. It was so easy that I will continue to buy pork chops in bulk and, three days later, make this. Next time I will toss in Hunan chilis.

Tasty. As good as any I have eaten in a restaurant. This recipe is very easy and fast. Not too many ingredients so it is budget friendly. . I used brown rice. This is perfect for weeknights when you are needing a fast meal. I  cooked enough extra rice to freeze for the next time I prepare this.

Added fresh garlic instead, and more of it, and did it all in one pan: best idea. Soy sauce is to taste. Would recommend adding a little soy sauce to the eggs before scrambling them.

Love the recipe. We used what we had on hand and it turned out great. Leftover pork  chops worked well. Cooked up with the onion then added a bag of stir fry veggies.

Good Recipe! I seem to always have to double the seasonings on all the recipes from this site. Maybe my family has weak taste buds, but I always double the quantity of the flavor-adding elements (onions, garlic powder, soy sauce etc. ). This is a great base recipe though and I can see how you can add a whole host of different proteins and vegetables in (I used shrimp). I will definitely make it again.

This makes a smaller portion.  I quadrupled it for my house #momto3boys. I used fresh garlic and mixed that and the ginger into the soy sauce before adding it.  I also seasoned the pork before cooking.  I used fresh minced onion, which totally worked, because I wasn't running to the store for a few green onions. I could see that being a nice addition to the dish. Finally, wasn't going wait for the rice to chill - it went in hot. Still good!

I left out the broccoli and used red rice the first time and used brown rice the next time. Came out great both times, I really liked the red rice version, different taste for sure. Make sure you always use cold cooked rice.

This is a versatile, quick recipe. My only change was to use two fresh garlic cloves because I didn’t have ground garlic on hand. It still came out really well.

Made it with leftover pork tenderloin, doubling basic recipe.  Cooked 1 C. jasmine rice with 1 + 1/2 cup water (makes 3 cups).  Scrambled 2 eggs & cooked flat, then cut into thin strips.  Sauteed diced carrots, onion, garlic,  broccoli & 1/2 tsp ginger powder in 1 T butter + 1 T veg oil + 1/2 tsp. sesame oil until veggies were tender crisp.  Added diced pork tenderloin + 1/2 cup frozen peas, stirred until heated thru.  Added pre-cooked eggs, , 3 T soy sauce + 1 T hoisin sauce & stirred until heated thru.  Delish!  Hubby and  I both loved it!  Will definitely make again!

I used this recipe as a foundation for shrimp fried rice.  Fortunately we had lots of veggies on hand so I threw in cauliflower and broccoli florets,  and some baby spinach as well.  The other addition was a shot of oyster sauce which gave a sweet background flavor to what could have been a bit of a bland recipe.  Oh, and frozen precooked shrimp topped off the meal.  I fried them with the veggies and my wife asked for seconds, the real indication of success.

I'm not a fan of pork at all and the first time I made this it turned out so good!  I didn't have any broccoli so I substituted it with celery.   This has just the right amount of spices and it really turned out great so I am making again tonight.   Thank you for the recipe, I wouldn't change a thing but for using your favorite veggies on hand! :)

We loved this fried rice. I had 3 cups of leftover pork loin from a roast and ironically 3 cups of leftover cooked white rice.
I stir fried 3/4 cup chopped carrots, 1/4 cup of chopped celery, 3 scallions, 2 cloves of garlic & 1 Tbs of fresh ginger for approx. 5 min. Added 3 cups of cooked pork mixing a few min. Created a hole in center of wok, added 1 tsp.sesame oil then added 3 wisked eggs and cooked till set. Stirred in 3/4 cup of chopped broccoli, 8 oz of sliced fresh mushrooms, 3/4 cup of frozen peas, 3 cups of cooked white rice, 1/4 cup of soy sauce, 1 Tbs of oyster sauce, 1/4 tsp of garlic powder and 1/4 tsp of ground ginger mixing a few minutes longer till heated through.   Although I added fresh garlic & ginger I added the garlic powder and ginger for extra flavor.  I always salt and pepper my veggies as they are sauteing. It's all about personal taste!! I did add more oyster sauce at the end for more flavor.  GREAT recipe and you can pretty much adjust to your taste.  LOVED IT!!!!

I substituted butter for vegetable oil since we were out of butter. I used white onions, carrots, orange bell pepper, green onion and celery. Also on the seasoning I only used soy sauce, cracked black pepper(fresh), pink Himalayan salt, red pepper flakes and done. Cooked it a little longer so the rice, meat and veggies would brown a bit more.

Winning recipe. Followed exactly. Made it a second time and did the tweak recommended in the reviews to add sesame sauce to the eggs, then,  added a bit more soy sauce  and garlic and it all made it even better. Very good recipe for someone who is a novice in the kitchen.

I have made this several times, using shrimp, chicken, or meatless.  I didn't change anything and found it to be just right.  Truly a family favorite now.

It was edible (didn't have carrots so excluded them) but i wasn't impressed.  Would not make it again.  Just tasted like rice that you added stuff to...too bland for me. I also didn't use white rice (i added veggie bouillon to it while cooking for a lil extra flavor).  Also added some red pepper flakes because i like heat.  Still in search of a better recipe  :(

Used Asian stir fry mix instead of the recommended veggies and it was fantastic.  Served  additional soy sauce on the side and glad I did. It would have been a little bland with recipe amount.

I am giving this 4 stars.  It was quite good, don't get me wrong.  I followed some reviews and used frozen mixed veggies and used sesame oil when scrambling the eggs.  

In order to get five stars this recipe must rock.  It was good, quite good as I said.  Nevertheless, not 5 stars.  I certainly believe it is a good starting point though.  Read the reviews, decide what you like and make it your own.  You will not be disappointed.

I had never made fried rice before, but I had eaten it often in the past.  This was ok, and I liked it. but it was a little on the bland side for me, although the rest of my family did enjoy it more than I did. At the suggestion of some others I used a small amount of sesame oil, which I believe took it from two stars to four, and I used leftover rotisserie chicken because I didn't have any pork. I also added some chili  garlic sauce, which helped up the flavor.    And I used brown rice which may have been the difference between what I had eaten before and what I was expecting.  Since rice is not supposed to be a big part of my diet anyway, I probably won't make it very often. but I will use this recipe as my base if I do.

Threw in a tablespoon or two of hoisin sauce. Was okay but nothing too exciting.  Make sure you make the rice ahead of time. It's the only way for it to cook up in the pan without lumping.

This was a great recipe. I doubled it and followed it all except I used leftover pork from the "Asian Pork Tenderloin" recipe by ONOLICIOUS10.  It was amazing. A great veggie to rice ratio.

I made this and loved it! So quick and easy. A few changes I made: I added fresh ginger and garlic in addition to the powder, instead of soy sauce I used "Bragg's liquid aminos", and also added a fresh hot Thai pepper, ground pepper, and Thai spice.  If you are actually hungry, double the recipe.  Doubling it makes 4 servings but fed just us two.

This was very good.  I tripled the recipe because I was taking it to a church potluck.  Only changes I made was to eliminate the pork and cook the rice in chicken stock.   You could easily add chicken to replace the pork but we didn't miss it.  It  definitely was not bland.

This is a good basic recipe for people like me who need a little guidance in cooking. I used leftover Cajun spice porkchops (recipe from this site) and leftover classic rice pilaf (also from this site) form the previous nights dinner in making this. I used onions, carrots, celery and peas for the veggies, because that is what I had on hand. I think the flavor from the Cajun spice and the flavor of the rice pilaf  are what really made this dish taste outstanding. This recipe and others like it are a great way to "repurpose" leftovers. My husband, who is a fried rice snob really liked it.

I made this a few times and we love it! I did make some changes though: I took others  suggestion for making the rice (I used Jasmine) a day ahead. I also added riced cauliflower (another veggie), peas, carrots, mushrooms, sweet white onion and  water chestnuts. I used coconut oil to brown the veggies and to finish off with fish sauce (allergic to oyster sauce and substituted "Bragg Liquid Aminos" for the soy sauce. Awesome dinner with low calorie and salt!

Love it!!  I especially liked the fact that you can easily adjust the ingredients and vegetables to your taste.  I have tried it with meat and without, and both were a hit with everyone.  
Thank you for an easy to fix and delicious recipe.

I used Spam instead of pork, added a little yellow mustard and reduced the soy sauce, so as not to be too salty with the Spam.  Did not use carrots or peas. It was absolutely delicious!

This didn't turn out as good as I had hoped - prob. thru my error as well as the recipe's.  I used leftover broccoli, cauliflower and carrots from a vegetable tray, along with frozen peas and green onions.  I was going back and forth between two recipes and forgot that this recipe was only for 2 servings!  I had already decided I needed more than one cup of rice, so made about triple the amount.  I did add a bit extra soy sauce, garlic powder and ginger, but found I needed a lot more after I tasted it at the end.  Even so, I had to douse it with more soy sauce and it still was bland.  A word of warning - there's a reason it calls for cold rice.  I didn't have any cold rice on hand and no time to wait for it to cook and chill, so used freshly made rice.  It ended up looking like oatmeal!  

Even though a lot of this was my fault,  I do wish recipes were submitted with a standard 4-serving size to eliminate any confusion.

I found it a little dry.  When  I make this again I'm going to add more ginger & garlic powder.  My man liked it, but he had to add hot sauce for flavour.

I found it a little bland. I'll add fresh ginger next time. I did wonder when and if I should add the peas. Since we are going meat free for lent I eliminated the pork. I did add unsalted cashews. I used Basmati Rice for a little better flavor.

Very simple and very tasty.  Tastes very close to Chinese pork fried rice.  Don't forget to season it. I use reduced salt soy sauce. The recipe does not say to season  but everything needs seasoning. I would not use salt if you use regular soy sauce because of all the salt in it.

This is easier. I grill a pork tenderloin with a marinade of soy sauce, sprigs of fresh  thyme, dry mustard, and melted butter.  For the pork fried rice I just cut up the left over tenderloin, add a package of Uncle Ben's long  grain and wild rice, a scrambled egg and frozen peas.  Put in a frying pan, cover it and leave until everything is warmed through.  Easy way for two different pork meals!

i made this exact recipe and it wasn't all that flavorful. however, i remade it and put the cooked rice in the pan that i used to fry the pork chops, after i removed all the grease.  it bumped up the flavor 1000%.    now i make this all the time, (sometimes with more pork),  it's a meal in itself!

This was very good. I did use leftover pork and I finely chopped the broccoli. I used half of a white onion finely chopped since I didn't have green onions. I also added a few cloves of garlic minced. It seemed like a lot of meat and veggies for a little amount of rice, so I doubled the rice and then doubled the seasonings (soy sauce, ginger and garlic powder). It was very tasty and can be adjusted in flavor to your taste with the seasonings. Very easy as well. It will definitely be something I'll make again with leftover chicken or pork.

Yum!! Used leftover pork tenderloin from two nights before and it was delicious! The pork was done in a maple mustard marinade and the sweetness from that and saltiness of the soy sauce went really nicely together! 6 and 3 year olds also loved it!

This was a really good rec. the only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because I would use a little less soy then they call for. I even used reduced sodium soy because its what we buy and it was still a little salty. I also did the recipe x6 and it worked out fine. I left out the green onion because we forgot it at the a store by mistake, used garlic instead. My husband loved loved loved this! I am sure I will be asked to make it again

I was expecting more from the ingredients and the reviews- but it wasn't great.  I used bastami rice and maybe the left over pork tenderloin was a bit dry, and the soy sauce I have is "light"- so maybe these factors contributed to my dissapointment.   I'm a pretty good cook and so many others liked this, but I thought this was not very tasty and a bit dry.

I liked this very much, altho' I made some changes... I used sesame oil instead of butter, used a bit more ginger, onion, and rice and fresh garlic.  I also left off the broccoli, since my husband doesn't like it! Did anyone else notice there is no mention of when to add the peas? I just added them with the rest of the veggies!

This recipe was very good.  I had left over boneless ahso pork, used crystalized ginger and fresh garlic and vidalia onion instead of green and added bean sprouts and basmati rice.   I will definitely use it again. It was easy and delicious.  It's a keeper in my recipe file.

Thank you.
