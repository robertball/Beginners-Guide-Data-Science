Marvelous savory & sweet combo and super easy to make. My own take on this is to use maple-flavored bacon. Goes so good with the cinnamon roll crust. 

Also I made it with crumbled maple breakfast sausage as well, very good but I prefer the taste and texture of crunchy bacon in the soft sweet dough. 

Sometime in the future I am also thinking of doing this but using a soft boiled quail egg (or at least a small chicken egg) in the center of each roll instead of scrambled eggs ... sort of an odd twist on the idea of Scotch Eggs. 

Experiment and enjoy!

Used a breakfast sandwich maker to make the egg patties and the results were pretty good but the folks eating didn't seem to like this particular combo. Either French toast or bacon and egg people I guess

Well these were yummy, but I feel that I could have done better, so I'm going to make them again and hope for a 5-star breakfast next time.  My mistake was...I didn't buy "Grands"...I bought regular sized cinnamon biscuits, which didn't work.  They were not big enough, so I had to use two biscuits per "bomb."   Also, I didn't know what to do with the icing from the biscuits?  The recipe didn't state, so I left it out completely.  Wondering if the icing would have added something to the finished product?  They were just a bit dry, so just maybe this would have helped.  All in all, this is a great idea for breakfast and I'm determined to get it right next time. :)

Hardest thing was to roll the dough into a circle and then to seal it shut after you stuff it. Probably need to make sure you have a lot of dough to start with (grande). This was not too sweet, didn't use any icing.

Easy to make, and yummy. The instructions for rolling the dough are easier to understand by watching the video rather than interpreting the written directions. I tried this mainly to see if it would be a decent breakfast when on the run. While I didn't try freezing any (the first batch disappeared fast), I'm sure they could be. Pop in a microwave, and out the door. Before making this I wondered if more ingredients could be added. They could but consider extra space is very limited when bundling up the dough bomb based on the ingredients as written. I nearly pulled the rolls from the oven at about 19 minutes since they were a deep golden brown. Decided to leave them for the full 22 minutes. I found the dough bombs which were touching one another toward the center were a bit doughy when first removed from the oven. The extra 3 minutes and 15 minutes resting time made them just right. I'll definitely make these again, and take on recreational outings. Very good recipe, Julie!

Easy to make, wonderful combo of sweet and savory.  I used my fingers to flatten out and spread the rolls thin.  Spread some icing on the rolls before serving if you need a little more sweetness.

I like the cinnamon with the eggs and I added a 1/2 tsp more.

Great recipe. I used Grands Flaky biscuits and black cast iron skillet. Maple flavored breakfast sausage instead of bacon. Will make with bacon next time...delicious!

This was a bomb.  Did not taste good at all.   I was going to make it for a men's breakfast and tried it the day before, took the eggs and bacon and served them with cinnamon rolls on the side.

Great idea to combine these breakfasts. Really nice combo of salty and sweet. I have quite a sweet tooth though and definitely needed the Grands sweet frosting to balance all the salty inside. Also, as mentioned in other reviews, make sure to buy the grands, as the other rolls/buns won't be large enough to fold over.
