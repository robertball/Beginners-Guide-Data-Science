The flavor seems to come primarily from fat and salt.  To make this more healthy and more flavorful, try the following:
1. spray the dish with non-stick spray rather than using butter
2. reduce the butter for sauteeing to 2 teaspoons
3. replace the milk with 1 cup of reduced sodium, fat-free chicken broth and 1 cup of low-fat evaporated milk
4. add 1/2 teaspoon (or more) of crushed marjoram or thyme leaves
5. add 1/8 teaspoon of ground red pepper to the roux and reduce the butter in the roux (you can cut in half and still successfully blend in the flour). Also, add 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon of freshly ground nutmeg to the roux. This is standard for a white sauce.
6. Use light cheese for the topping, preferably highly flavored such as asiago or extra sharp cheddar.

5 stars with these adjustments: Spray baking dish with cooking spray instead of butter. Double recipe for 9 x 13 pan. Added 1tsp each:thyme nutmeg and crushed red pepper. Doubled garlic. Minced mushrooms (So the kids wouldn't know!!) Put a splash of white wine in with the veggies as the sauteed. Omitted peas (don't like them). Added 1/4 cup of parmesan ,1/4 package of cream cheese and half the cheddar cheese to the sauce.Added 1/2cup of quartered cherry tomatoes. Topped with remaining cheese then topped with corn flakes instead of bread crumb mixture. IT WAS TO DIE FOR!!!!!We loved it from ages3 to 31!

YUM!!!  Very Impressed.  I am very bored with searching for recipes only to find bulk ingredient  is canned soup.  I enjoy cooking from scratch, and this is perfect.  If you are used to canned soup tuna casserole, and you try this recipe, you will NEVER go back. 
I changed very few things and just finished this for dinner.  I didn't add mushrooms (not a fan), and added just a sprinkle of celery seed.
I also used a little more cheese, more like a 1 1/4 cup of cheese.  I added half of the cheese to the "cream" and melted it like you would do with macaroni and cheese.  Then added the other half to the top like the recipe called for.
I read other reviews mention the use of crackers instead of bread crumbs, and I did that as well.  
This recipe is going into the keep pile, THANKS!

I think that with two changes this is a five star recipe.  Add a chicken boullion cube to your cream sauce, which adds a LOT of flavor, and top with french fried onions instead of the bread crumbs.  I will NEVER go back to casserole out of a can--this is absolutely delicious and the leftovers are even better!

We think this dish has a lot of potential, and I'm sure I'll make it again.  As is, however, it's just sort of...blah.  I kept adding salt in an effort to stir up the flavors, but it just didn't happen.  Before attempting this again, I'll figure out what seasonings will work to make it more flavorful.  My husband did comment that it doesn't have the typical soup taste to it, which is a great thing!
4-11-06:  I made this again tonight, and it was a lot better!  I added some fresh dill, as dill is really good paired with just about any fish.  I also tripled the amounts of garlic and black pepper that went into it; it was very flavorful this time around.  I've added this to my recipe book with my additions.

This recipe is good as it is.  If it was meant to not have butter, then it wouldn't.  Never understood why some people feel the need to critisize a recipe for being unhealthy, there are hosts of "healthy" recipes to be found.  Some of us like butter!

It's a keeper!  I did make some shortcuts: after I finished the mushrooms, I added the butter then the flour right to the mushroom mix.  I cooked that for about 3-5 minutes and then added the milk.  After the noodles cooked for 4 minutes, I added the frozen peas to the pot and cooked the peas and noodles together for another 4 minutes.  After draining both, I put the tuna in the noodle pot, poured the noodles and peas on top, added the cheese and stirred.  Then I added the mushroom mix, stirred and put it all in a casserole dish.  I omitted the salt from the recipe and topped the casserole with crushed potato chips as I didn't have bread crumbs.  I love recipes that don't include a "cream of something" can of soup!  (I used leftover haddock from the fridge and it was great; I suppose you could use any fish!)

This is really great and SUPER easy. I only changed one thing, and that was substituting 2 cans of chicken in place of the tuna..(for some reason people here think they don't like hot tuna!;)) I think I'd also make a bit more of the gravy mixture next time because I'd have liked it a little creamier, but considering I didn't really put exactly 8oz of noodles in, (dumped more on accident)it is probably the reason it wasn't as creamy. Anyway, excellent recipe. Thanks for submitting it!

Why is that casserole recipes never call for enough sauce? When I mixed everything together, prior to baking, it looked quite nice and juicy. I should have stopped there and eaten the dish as pasta with tuna sauce. The baking dried it out completely. I would also suggest using more tuna as to me it tasted more like a 'peas in white sauce with pasta casserole'. I am also always suspicious when recipes call for a flour-thickened sauce to put over pasta. They ususally turn out too 'bready'. I think it would be nicer to use thick cream instead of milk here, and omit the flour. Also, more spices and herbs would be nice, I think. Garlic, parsley and lemon would make it more interesting. The way it's written it's a bit bland and definitely dry and I am not looking forward to finishing the leftovers tomorrow night.

I have been making a similar tuna noodle casserole for years. I dislike canned soups very much and never use them. To me they all have a chemical taste that permiates the food. I always make my own bechamel sauce for this casserole. For those that substitute chicken broth and canned non-stick spray, that's fine if you like it that way, but it totally changes the recipe. Butter and milk add the richness and creaminess. If you're worried about calories, make something else!

Awesome recipe! Tastes sooo much better than the canned cream of whatever tuna casserole recipes I've had to eat before (Sorry Mom). Definitely worth the extra effort to make from scratch.

I made this a couple days ago as I'm trying to get more fish in our diets. I followed the recipe almost exactly, although I substituted some garlic powder for the clove of garlic and I used two 4-oz cans of sliced mushrooms as I forgot to buy some fresh ones. I also used some crushed crackers instead of breadcrumbs, and I probably used more like two cups of cheese on top. Oh, very tasty! I cooked it up in an 8" square glass baking dish, and it was almost overfull! I think it could use something else, too. It wasn't bland so much as just lacking... something. But it is much better than the soup-from-a-can casseroles that I have been making, although I won't make this all the time simply because it takes longer to make. I will definitely make it again.  Thanks for sharing this recipe. :)

Excellent! Tuna Casserole is not one of hubby's favorite meals. The kids and I like it so I was determined to find a recipe that he would enjoy as well. This is the one! When I mentioned to him that I would be trying another recipe, his only request was to add a little more tuna and leave out the peas. I used half button and half baby bella mushrooms, deglazed the pan with approx. 1/4 cup white wine with the mushrooms and added a handful of Durkee fried onions during the last 5 - 10 minutes in the oven. Everyone loved it and we will enjoy this often. Thanks for sharing!!

We made this twice.  The first time we were so impressed.  The second time we were bored w/ it so I froze part and the other part just sits in the refrigerator.  It is kinda boring.  It takes time to make the roux.  We are not just "dying" to make it again soon.  Canned mushrooms help this dish even for those who are not mushroom lovers.  Luis puts lot of Tapatio hot sauce on this dish to eat it even though we put habeneros in the mix.  This dish has been tying up too many plastic lunch portables.  Luis & I are gonna have to bite the bullet and eat it to have more dishes available.

I only made one change in this recipe and that was using chopped fresh broccoli instead of peas as we do not like peas. I used whole wheat pasta in this casserole as well as homemade bread crumbs. We thought this was okay, but bland. My husband thought that this would have been better with more cheese and I thought it could use a little spicing up. As is, good start but I think it could be played with a bit and made tastier without so much fat.

Made this today for dinner and it was outstanding.  To cut down on the pans used to prepare this, I sauted the vegetable in the skillet as directed then melted the additional butter and added the flour to the same skillet, let it cook for a few minutes and added the milk.  Worked wonderfully!  Cooked the noodles, drained them and added everything to that same pot to mix together.  No more dishes than homemade mac and cheese!  I mixed panko and cheese together for the topping, no butter.  Everyone loved it!

This recipe turned out very well, but you are definitely on your own for how to season it.  I decided to use a combination of  1/8 tsp. cayenne pepper,  1/8 tsp. black pepper, 1/2 tsp. dill, 1 tsp. dried mustard, 1 tsp. parsley, and a 1/2 tsp of vegetable Better Than Bouillon to give it some zip.  I also used tripled the minced garlic and substituted half chicken broth for part of the milk.  For the topping, I doubled the bread crumbs to 6 T and kept the amount of butter at 2 T.

This was delicious!  I'm lactose and gluten intolerant so I substituted GF flour, funsilli noodles, and bread crumbs for the normal wheat-based ingredients.  I also used LF veggie cheddar shreds, smart balance lite, and almond milk in place of the other dairy-based ingredients.  It turned out beautifully. Highly reccommend

This was awesome! I cut down a little bit on the butter. I added some of the cheese to the sauce mixture and used crush up croutons for the topping with no butter. Was looking for ultimate comfort food and this was it! Took a little work but worth it for the lower fat and sodium I was looking for since I used skim milk and light cheese. Will definitley make again!

My family loved it! It was my first time making a tuna casserole, but it's definetly a keeper in the monthly menu. Since we are not really health conscious, I substituted milk for cream and it made the whole deal incredibly smooth. I also added thyme and nutmeg as suggested by some reviewers, and threw in a bunch of quartered cherry tomatoes just before putting it into the stove. Thanks!

I agree with cooknggardener about there being way too much fat.....the recipe tasted VERY starchy as written.  Adding chicken stock in place of 1/2 the milk and substituting the rest with evaporated milk adds so much more flavor, and cutting down on the butter cuts fat without affecting taste.  Adding herbs and seasonings (whatever you like) is also a must.  Ways to make it even healthier - cut the cheese in half and use a highly flavorful type, like extra sharp cheddar (you'll never miss the other half); use whole wheat egg noodles; use canned wild Alaskan salmon (great brand available at Costco) instead of tuna.  Even though it needs changes I rated this recipe 4 stars just because of the fact that it teaches/encourages people to omit processed canned soup (yuck!) =)

I would just like to say BRAVO for stressing the fact that this is a "from scratch" recipe. I'm American but have lived in France for 27 years and have long ago stopped using commercially packaged ingredients in my cooking, first because of unavailability and then by choice, even though some of that stuff in now available. I wish all the recipes on this site that are from scratch were tagged somehow to indicate that fact. Thanks for the great recipe!

This dish was excellent. It was tasty and such an upgrade from the canned soup variety. It was worth the effort. I really liked the simple sauce. I will make this again

I made a huge amount of this in a pan (bigger than 9x13, it's more like 12x16 or something)._____________________  I followed recipe but did the following adjustments/additions: 1 large bag egg noodles, 4 cans tuna, 2 small onions, 1 carton mushrooms, 3/4c flour (added a little more later to thicken sauce), 3c milk, half bag frozen peas. I put some shredded cheddar in with the sauce, along with 1can cream of mushroom soup, 1 bullion cube, 1 packet of ranch powder, and 1 packet of garlic&herb powder. ______After everything was cooked/added together into the sauce, put it into the cooking spray coated pan and covered the top with bread crumbs and then shredded cheddar.  375 for 25min seemed to be fine.  It still could have used a little more flavor, I can't imagine doing this exactly like the recipe says with no seasoning... I think more cheese in the sauce (or a different sauce recipe) would make this even better.

Really good tuna noodle casserole.  Make a couple changes though.  Used cooking spray in the baking pan instead of butter.  When cooking down the veggies, I added a 1/4c of chicken broth and cooked down along with some spices.  And in the white sauce i cut down the amount of milk, added a 1/4c of low fat cream cheese, and also added nutmeg.  I also omitted the bread crumbs and butter topping and just used the cheddar cheese.  Two thumbs up from the hubbie.

" . . . from Scratch" is the relative indicator!  I live in the middle of nowhere and could not get to a store to make what I was feeling, which was Tuna Casserole.  So when I came upon this one it appealed to me since I had the basic ingredients . . . and I love things that are "real".  I mean cream of mushroom soup is awesome!  truly! an American institution along with Campbells, but I did not have the little cans. I loved the recipe!  it was creamy and warm for a fall nite, and it was easy over all.  Ok here goes the whining.  No, I am not going to whine about all the butter.  I live in Wisconsin, are you kidding, I live to use real butter!  No I am not going to mention one ingredient or another . . .ok, what became the negative for me was, I dirtied 3 pans . . . and lots of other utensils . . . etc. and I hate washing dishes and I do not have a dishwasher at the old farm!!!! The other thing, the Casserole was a bit dry . . .not sure what I did wrong, I wanted creamy . . . The substitues I made: I used zucchini instead of peas, since I did not have peas.  I used more spices and herbs . . . I added red and green peppers  . . . carrots, all minced fine----I will try the recipe again!  Thank you for sharing!

I made this dish in one pot (except for cooking the noodles) as I think it improves the flavour. Experiment! After frying mushrooms add the second amount of butter to the same pan then the flour as well. This way you're not losing all those delicious browned bits. Stir the milk in right away (slowly) stirring constantly to avoid lumps as it will thicken fast. Throw your peas, cooked noddles, tuna, chedar, etc, right into the same pan. I added some fresh parley and tarrogon along with my S&P as I had it on hand. Pour into a deep casserole dish. Add remaining butter to the same pan and stir in the bread crumbs. Sprinkle on top and bake! I baked this for a lot longer than recommended. First for 30 minutes with the lid on as some reviews said it was dry, then I took the lid off and baked for another 20 minutes. Great recipe though, I had fun playing with it thank you!

I love this recipe! I made it for my family and everyone loved it. The topping is to die for; comes out nicely browned and a little crunchy. I followed the recipe for the most part except I added a dash of nutmeg to the white sauce as it was thickening and I chopped up the mushrooms instead of slicing. Also, do not add more noodles to the casserole then it calls or you will end up with a slightly drier casserole. I used less than 8oz and it came out perfect. Thank you for the awesome dish!

I love this recipe. It's similar to mine.  I'm one of those dont measure, use what I have on hand to make those dishes that are what my friends and family love. This is a wonderful recipe. Btw, I sometimes use a mix of cheeses in place of cheddar - try monterey pepper jack! YUM! thanks MVANWINKLE.  this is a great recipe.

omg they're right! i will NEVER go back to a canned soup recipe!!! I used only half a tsp each of thyme and nutmeg and it was perfectly seasoned.  I also added a finely chopped jalapeno for some zing and a red pepper for color and it complimented the casserole well. I'm gonna go have another helping!!!! YUM!!!!

WOW!  I left out the bread crumbs, and added a bit more garlic, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  This was FABULOUS - nice and creamy, filling and exactly what I wanted.  It needed just a touch of salt and some pepper at the table.  I will be making this again (and again).

this was pretty good, but it turned out a little dry.  I think next time I'd add 1/4 c. sour cream for a little tang.

This was a good base, but I changed a few things. 
-I didn't add any salt, and decreased the butter significantly. I only used about 2.5 TB butter- 1/2 a cup is so much! I used olive oil to saute the onion & celery instead of butter and to oil the dish. I only used the butter for the  cream sauce (instead of 4 TB I used about 2) and I used about 1/2 a TB or a little more for the breadcrumbs. 
- I added some more veggies. I just used what I had on hand: carrots, red bell pepper. 
- I added some seasonings including black pepper, oregano, basil, and cayenne pepper.

Wonderful starter casserole - but it is time consuming so plan accordingly.  Next time I will double the tuna (I do NOT like the smaller versions now in the stores, especially if they don't mark the price down!) and add thyme or something for some more flavor.  UPDATE 8/2013:  Add a small sprig of fresh thyme to the mushrooms, it really does take this up another notch.  Personal preference is more sauce, easy fix to change it to 1 1/2 times milk, butter and flour.

This casserole was great!  I wasn't in the mood for tuna, so I used some leftover chicken instead, still was excellent!  I could see also using ham, turkey, maybe even beef.  :)  The kids and husband loved it, and I liked the taste of the homemade sauce.  It was a nice change from the usual cream soups sauces. I also added more salt and pepper.  This casserole could also compliment many seasonings if you add them to your taste.

Thank goodness, finally a recipe without the soup. It tastes great with the fresh ingredients and the seasoning can be adapted to your own liking (we love crushed red pepper). Fresh tuna makes it even better. No more recipes with soup cans to be opened, please. That's not cooking.

This was a wonderful, simple recipe that uses everyday ingredients, yet still tastes terrific. This is one of the few recipes I used that did not need adjustments, it was great as is! I did not have any peas, so I just threw in some leftover red pepper that needed to be used up. Much better than the canned soup based version.

This is about as good as tuna casserole can get. It wasn't as easy as my moms old soup based recipe but well worth the extra steps. It was creamy and flavorful. The buttered bread crumbs on the top added a wonderful flavor. Even my daughter who hates mushrooms and anything tuna, had seconds.

I made a few modifications, which is sort of expected I guess.  My mushrooms were not usable, so no mushrooms.  I grated some carrots up and put that in.  I used panko crumbs and nearly doubled it as I had an extra tablespoon of butter to use because I didn't butter the dish (which is totally not needed, it came out of my Corningware dish pretty clean).  I think next time I'll grate a little more cheese and add it in with the noodles.  I'll also add more onions, carrots and peas.  The sauce was very simple to make (and was what mad me use this recipe).  :)

Very tasty recipe! I used saltine crackers instead of bread crumbs, and I added a tsp of mustard seeds. In my opinion it could benefit from a little more flavor.  Next time I will add a bit of raw red onion for bite and texture. Perhaps sprinkle a bit of paprika on top. But I got lots of compliments as is!

The old fashion, canned mushroom soup version is the one I grew up on and thought I loved.  But after making this version, I will never go back (sorry mom).  I followed the suggestions and added extra herbs and seasonings.  So good!

This was very tasty. I added some dill and seafood seasoning (old bay) just a tad though. Other than that I followed the directions and it came out lovely. Will make again.

This was good and I made it exact except I did not use the extra melted butter and bread crumbs...I'm just not a fan of bread crumbs in my casserols.  I underseasoned a bit with the salt and pepper...I'm used to making this with a soup mix which adds plenty of salt, so make sure you taste it.

I gave this a 5 star rating---it was very good, but I admit I modified it slightly.  I added seasoned salt (Lawrys), omitted the celery, cut back on the butter, and I used the cheese on top and then crushed potato chips.  It was seriously a good casserole and I will definitely make again.  I paired it with some sliced yellow squash, fresh green beans and mushrooms steamed.

Delicious!! I used the 2 cups of milk (2%) but I added 1 tablespoon of vegetable broth in powder for flavor. Plus a pinch of nutmeg. I didn't use mushrooms (because I don't like them) and I mixed 1/2 of the cheese in the cream sauce and the other 1/2 went to the top. I also used french fried onions instead of croutons or crackers. My husband loved it!!

This was so good!  I did need to add a little extra butter while cooking the onion/mushroom mixture.  I also thinned the sauce out quite a bit with about 1/3 cup of milk, I knew the noodles would absorb some of the liquid.  I only boiled my noodles for 6 minutes as I didn't want them to be mushy after being baked.  For those who thought it was bland, the recipe does say salt & pepper to taste.  I always add salt & pepper during each step while cooking (while boiling the noodles, cooking the onion/mushroom mixture and to the cream sauce) and always, always taste things before cooking them to make sure I have enough seasoning.  I also added a little onion powder to the sauce.  Instead of using buttered breadcrumbs and cheese I used crushed potato chips just like my Grandmother used to.  It turned out great, thanks for a yummy (soup free) recipe!

You can tell this is an old recipe (that doesn't make it bad).  Cans of tuna haven't been 6 ounces in a LONG time.  I used extra fine noodles, omitted the celery and used frozen baby peas (personal preferences). The baby peas have a much brighter flavor and are not so mealy as mature peas. I like that this recipe didn't call for condensed soup, which has, unfortunately, become a casserole staple. LOVE the mushroom and onion in this.  I used crushed potato chips as a topping, as I had no bread crumbs.

My husband loves tuna noodle casserole and this one was a perfect match since I hate using cans. This was also the only tuna noodle casserole I can say I enjoy. We will be making this again.

This is really one of the best casseroles I've made from AR.  I loved how easy it was and not using canned soups.  I followed the recipe exactly except for the bread crumbs on top.  I used crushed Ritz crackers and it was delicious.  I'll be making this again soon.  Pure comfort food.  I did use albacore white tuna so it was not fishy tasting at all.  Thanks MVANWINKLE for posting this great recipe.

I loved mom's tuna casserole growing up and yes she used canned mushroom soup.  My husband's mother made tuna casserole the same way and he hated it.  Needless to say I've made tuna casserole very few times since my man doesn't like it but when I saw this recipe I just had to try it and WOW!  Even my husband loved it.  This is by far the best tuna casserole I've ever had and I didn't change a thing.

This was good as written, but it did need more seasoning.  This recipe became a 5 star with adjustments.  I used cream instead of flour and milk and added 1 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp thyme and salt.

This is a bit dry. I added canned chicken and put in some chicken boullion.  We still ate it, next time I would just make more of the sauce.

Love a recipe that's truly from scratch and isn't made with canned soup.  One can of soup sends mine and my husband's blood pressure through the roof!  I make it according to the directions (except for spraying the baking dish with cooking spray instead of greasing it with butter) if I want an easy, fast recipe; I use the suggestions from the first couple reviews listed (chix broth, evap milk, nutmeg, etc.) if I want something healthier and a little tastier.  Good either way!

As some others have mentioned you really need to double the amount of sauce and add additional seasonings.  I added Pampered Chef Dill Mix.  It was good but this was too much effort for "just good".

Tried this last night and while it looked good, unfortunately, it was way too dry for my liking. Lacked flavor so I tried adding a couple of spices which did not help. The only way to salvage what I have left is probably to add a can of the "perverbial soup". Will not be making this again. Sorry MVANWINKLE!!

This was a great base recipe.  To perfect I added 2 carrots. This gives great flavor.  In the milk mixture add 1 tsp.garlic powder, ceyenne pepper 1/2 tsp.  2 tbs. Fresh minced dill.  Cook the veg. At least 7 mins.
I added 1 cup of cheese (wine cheddar) to the mix prior to baking.  It makes the dish more creamy. I place 1/3 cup of cheese on the top.  
So dish does not become dry reduce pasta to 7 ounces.
The beauty of this recipe is no soup used out of the can.  Loads of veggies....  With these adjustments my husband loved it!

My family loved it!  My husband claims to hate tuna fish and he ate 2 helpings.  I made a few adjustments.  I only used 1 tbsp of flour and I used 1/2 & 1/2.  It was creamy! I cut the peas and mushrooms (chopped small) in half.  I was plenty!  I used whole grain club crakers and added 1/4 c. of parm. cheese to top.  I was good.

For a family who doesn't love tuna noodle casserole, this was pretty good.  Even our picky eater ate it, and that says a lot.  Thank you for creating a tuna noodle casserole that doesn't include a can of "cream of something" soup.  Well done.

A major pain to make unless you enjoy using every dish you own and have a lot of patience.  I ended up in a bad mood and will avoid recipes like this which could be just as good made with soup rather than making all this stuff.  I am still relatively a beginner, having started a year ago but I work full time.  This is just not worth the extra work.  The prep time is more like 45 minutes and the cleanup time is about 30 minutes.

This is delicious but I gave it 4 stars because I feel that this recipe is not very healthy.  I used a little butter for flavor then substituted the rest with olive oil.  I also used whole wheat noodles, reduced fat milk and real tuna baked.  It was really good!

Loved this! I increased the tuna because I didn't think 2 cans would be enough. 3 was perfect. I added half the cheese to the sauce. Oh, and there's no need to use a separate saute pan for the sauce...just toss the butter, flour, etc., in with the veggie mixture. Works great. Then at the end I topped the casserole off with the remaining cheese, followed by the bread crumbs, to which I added a 1/2 cup of almonds. Delicious! Very very pleased with the outcome...hmm, think I'll go have seconds right now, actually. :)

First time I ever made Tuna Casserole and it was yummy.  I followed the recipe except added a few more mushrooms, and used macaroni instead - this one will go in my personal "comfort food" recipe book.

I have been making tuna & noodle casserole for at least 35 years, the key to truly great tuna and noodle is using tuna packed in OIL, not water, use the tuna AND oil, do not drain..
I cook the noodles in a chicken broth and let stand 10 minutes before draining.
Cooking this recipe with my additions will always be the hit dish of the meal..

I like to play with my food. Did like it at 3 Stars. But I think this dish has a lot of potential, and I'm sure I'll make it again. Before attempting this again, I'll figure out what seasonings will work for me to make it more flavorful.
I made this again tonight, and it was a lot better to me! I added some fresh dill, as dill is really good paired with just about any fish. I also tripled the amounts of garlic and black pepper that went into it; it was very flavorful this time around. I've added this to my recipe book with my additions. Substituting 2 cans of chicken in place of the tuna..(for some reason people here think they don't like hot tuna!;)) I think I'd also make a bit more of the gravy mixture next time because I'd have liked it a little creamier, but considering I didn't really put exactly 8oz of noodles in, (dumped more on accident)it is probably the reason it wasn't as creamy. Anyway, excellent to do a SCRATCH recipes. The more I play with food the more I love to cook to make a recipe I do will! THANK YOU!!

Very good! Not outstanding but good flavor. Made it with rice instead of noodles.Tasted like the casserole my mom used to make. Rice absorbed most of the sauce,so i will double the sauce next time.I will make this again.

Good comfort food! It's a little putzy but I like knowing that it was made from scratch. I read the reviews and made a few minor changes like adding thyme and garlic powder to the sauce and replacing most of the butter with olive oil. Also, I added an extra can of tuna at hubby's request, and I added the cheese right to the sauce instead of on top. I would make this again.

All I can say is "Wow!"  Thoroughly enjoyed this recipe and will make it again and again.  Loved that it was less salty than the canned soup variety.  Used a bit less butter to make it slightly healthier but only about 2 TBSP's worth.

I chose this casserole recipe initally because it didn't utilize an already prepared soup (Im on a low sodium diet).  I did make two changes tho.  I used asiago cheese instead of cheddar, as suggested.  The asiago gave it a great flavor boost! I also left out the peas.  Definately a keeper in my recipe box.

A VERY good starting point!  Based on my family's preferences and some of the previous reviews, I made a few changes.  We loved this!  Its so nice to have a tuna casserole that doesn't include soup.

Made exactly as recipe calls for and it was PERFECT.  Just what you crave when you want comfort food.  This will definately be in the rotation!  Even the kids liked it.

Very good.  I did blend much of the cheese to the white sauce and added some seasoning.    
A very good change from the canned mushroom soup version but you do use a lot of pans.  
Definitely worth a try.

This turned out great!  I did sub different veggies based on what I aleady had on hand; corn, red peppers, and onions.  Even my kid ate it without any complaints (this is an amazing feat in itself)!  I likes that I didn't have to use creamed soup and it made enough for 4 of us that I was able to freeze half to have on hand for another time.  Will be using again.

Yumm-o, took suggestions from others and added cumin and red pepper to roux.  Plus only used 2TBl butter with 3Tbl whole wheat flour.  Also added 1/4c parmesan cheese and 3oz cream cheese inside dish and topped with sliced  white cheddar.  Substituted black olives for the mushrooms and used whole wheat pasta.  Thank you for this recipe I will be making this over and over.

We LOVED this recipe!!!  we are trying to get more omega 3's, so we used salmon instead of tuna, and it was still outstanding!!  I omited the mushrooms as well, as I am not supposed to eat them for health reasons, it was still delicious.  I also love panko, so that is what I used for the crumb topping.  Will definitely make again!!!

I really liked this recipe.  I haven't had tuna casserole in a long time, and when I came across this recipe I decided to try it.  This is a tasty casserole and the only thing I changed was to cut down on some of the butter.

Great recipe and made it as directed, we enjoyed it.  removed 1 star b/c it could have a little more richness in flavor.  Regardless, I'll make this again and again.

About 10 years ago, soon after I got married, my husband requested tuna noodle casserole, so I tried my hand at it and made one using one of those cream of sodium soups, and it was soooooo awful I swore I would never make it again.  I just recently decided to give it another go, and was really excited to find this recipe!  I tried it the other night, and I have to say, I was IMPRESSED!!!  This is delicious, and I will absolutely be making it again!  I made just a couple of alterations -- I omitted the peas, I added some diced red bell pepper, I mixed some of the cheese into the white sauce, and I had corn flakes on hand, so I mixed those with melted butter and topped it with that.  I won't change a thing next time!

Good but a little bland.  5 stars by doubling tuna, adding 2 TBS of Worcestershire to the sauce, and a couple of tablespoons of chopped red pimento for a little color.  I also opted for twice the bread crumb topping as I forgot the cheese.

Due to the fact that soups have more fat, sugar, salt and MSG, we don't use soups for cooking. I make a basic white sauce for everything that calls for soup and add what is needed or I tweak it. You can also sub for shredded chicken if you have a picky eater at home that has decided they hate tuna this week. Otherwise, make at home meals are healthier then using canned items to speed meals along. Thanks for this recipe.

Great! Cut back on calories by greasing then dish with Pam, making the cream sauce with skim milk and 2 tablesp of butter, and sautéing the veggies with evoo.  I also added in broccoli and doubled the celery and a little more peas...healthy and good!!!

I'm not a huge fan of tuna noodle casserole, but Hubby is a connoisseur of tuna noodle casserole - one of his all-time favorite foods.  This recipe caught my eye because it didn't contain any "cream of" soup which is always a turn off to me.  So I decided to make this for him and he LOVED IT!  After reading a number of the reviews I doubled the sauce, because he likes it creamy and this did not disappoint!  I put the cheese in the casserole rather than on top and used panko instead of bread crumbs.  So, in conclusion, if you're a tuna noodle fan, give this one a try!  Remember the connoisseur of all things tuna noodle loved it!  UPDATE 12/15/10 - This time I used a mix of peas and carrots for a little more color.

Wonderful comfort food.  This will be in the regular rotation at our house...so, so good.  I didn't have any breadcrumbs so I substituted crushed Ritz crackers, made a nice crunchy topping.

This was very good and fairly easy to make.  I doubled the amount of bread crumbs with the same amount of butter in the recipe for the topping.  I used the tuna in the bag that you do not have to drain.  I will definately make this again.

Delicious! Some changes I made: I added another can of tuna, and left out the mushrooms. For baked pasta dishes, I slightly undercook my noodles so the baking doesn't turn the noodles to mush. I also added some Old Bay spice to the breadcrumb mixture and some of the pasta water to make the casserole more moist.

Tuna noodle casserole-ugh! That was what my husband said the first time I made this - then he ate it. This has become a huge hit in our home. I mostly use garlic powder instead of chopping fresh - because I hate chopping garlic. I halve the recipe for just us two. I use twice the bread crumbs because we love the crunch. Since I started making this we eat it 3-4 times a month......usually per my husband's request. His co-workers think he is crazy when he raves about tuna noodle casserole night at work. You'll love it too!

This recipe is great. The amount of noodles per sauce and vegetables is awesome, although I added some things since I was trying to fill a 11x13 pan... 2/3lb of mushrooms instead of 1/2, 1 cup frozen corn in addition to the peas, and instead of celery I added carrots (2 largish, steamed and added at the end). I also needed about 66% more flour to my sauce, maybe the high altitude is why? Finally, instead of add cheese on top I melted it into the milk/butter/flour sauce before pouring over everything and mixing it all together. I just used up the cheese I had, about 4oz of colby jack and 2oz of cheddar. The result was a killer casserole that me and my fiance are deeply in love with! I recommend, as I do with most all casseroles, cooking the onion with intent to caramelize (at least most of the way), though it does take longer. I used a whole sweet onion. I plan on making this again!

Wow...this is soooo good! A lot easier to make than I thought. I will NOT be using canned soup for Tuna Noodle Casserole ever again!! I used panco instead of breadcrumbs (I had it on hand), and topped with frenches fried onions. YUM.

I don't think that I will ever make my tuna casserole recipe ever again!  This is absolutely wonderful, and will be my normal tuna casserole recipe from here on.  Thanks so much for sharing!  Oh, I did leave the peas out, just don't care for them!

This was really good.  I made it basically as the recipe states.  You really have to season the sauce before adding everything to it as it is only flour and milk and basically has no taste at all.  I used a heavy dose of salt, pepper, garlic powder and a tiny dash of nutmeg.  Threw in frozen peas right before baking.  Did not use mushrooms as I didn't have any.  Doubled up on the cheese on top.  Very good, will make again!  It needs to bake covered in foil.

Delish!  Double the recipe to fill a deep dish casserole pan.  Be patient when making the sauce with the milk/flour.  Just when you think it will never thicken, it does.  You can change it up to make different meals – use mini shell pasta (holds the sauce better), add chicken instead of tuna, add all sorts of veggies.  I added cubed Velveeta and it made it soooo gooey.  I also added shredded cheese in sauce and didn't use the breadcrumbs, just more cheese.

You need several pots and pans for this one, but it is so worth it! Used a bit less mushroom, but made everything else exactly as written. Reheats well the next day, if you manage to not eat the whole casserole at once!

Wasn't sure that it would be THAT different than the usual (with canned soup)but Oh my Goodness!! My husband ate 4 servings (no leftovers) Really tasty, made exactly as written I think the difference is the slight sweetness the fresh veggies give it along with the breadcrumbs and cheese on top...a keeper!

My family dearly loves this recipe.  I make it with our own home canned salmon, since we have that in abundance here.  Last year our family hosted an exchange student from Spain.  At first she was a little disappointed at the amount of fish in our diet (halibut and salmon mostly).  But when I asked her which food she would miss the most from the US, she said . . . "Your salmon casserole!"  This is a luscious recipe very creamy and full of taste, and without using canned soup!!! You can't beat this for comfort food!!

This is a crowd pleasing wholesome version of an American classic.  The fresh mushrooms are a highlight.  I will add a third can of tuna next time.  Will definitely make again.

This was very good but not the best dinner I've ever had. A good change from the norm and was easy to make. The only addition I will do differently next time is to make more sauce. (not quite double)

As a base recipe, I like it, especially since it doesn't utilize any type of canned soup.  However, I think it had one clove of garlic too many which just absolutely overwhelmed the dish.  It was still edible but if I ever make this again, I won't add the garlic.  I also didn't include the onion since I wanted the casserole to have a chance against my very picky children (and sadly, the casserole lost).

I made exactly like the recipe but added a handful of matchstick carrots while sauteeing the mushrooms.  I also skipped the breadcrumb/butter calorie bomb topping and didn't miss it at all.  Everyone loved it (even the 7yr old.)  This is now my official tuna noodle casserole recipe.

We are Americans living in Germany, and Germans put tuna on EVERYTHING!  Pizza, salad, anything... Because of that, my tuna-sandwich loving husband didn't really want me to make this for dinner, but he still went back for seconds.  It didn't blow me away or anything, but it was really good.  The sauce was the best part.  Next time I make this I will try substituting canned chicken instead of tuna and seasoning with a little more salt.  Thanks for the recipe!
UPDATE: This actually gets better and better after sitting for a day or two, and it freezes well too.  I previously rated it 4 stars but I'm upping it to five because of that.

A very nice change to the usual cream of soup recipe.  Don't misunderstand, even that tuna casserole is wonderful and my grandchildren LOVE it!  However, this is more of a "grown up" version.  I agree with some of the reviewers, i cut down on the noodles by about 25% (i was doubling recipe) but it still was a bit dry.  I'd use about 1/2 the noodles or double your sauce.  I also used 1/2 the butter called for (by accident, forgot since i was doubling) and it was still great.  I also substituted about 1 pint of 1/2 & 1/2 for the milk.  I had it and needed to use before it was going to spoil.  I also added about 2 tablespoons of dill weed to the milk mixture as it cooked & thickened.  Dill is yummy on any fish!  The only other thing i would change is I will consider next time doubling the bread crumbs for the topping - it needed more.  But otherwise, wonderful!  Next time I might use my own homemade noodles!  Awesome - thank you!

I don't like canned creme soup so I really liked this recipe.  However I had a bag of Kraft Homestyle Mac and Cheese to use up and felt like tuna casserole so I used this recipe substituting only the steps to make the creme sauce with the creme sauce that comes with the Kraft.  It was BY FAR the best tuna casserole I have ever had.  For health reasons (to avoid processed sauces like the Kraft) I would like to try making the sauce the the recipe calls for but even with the Kraft sauce this recipe was 5 stars.

This was a great recipe!!  My family loved it.  I omited the mushrooms, I didn't cook the celery or onions before I mixed it all together and it tasted fantastic!!! Celery was a little crunchy still and the onions were cooked perfectly!!  I will be making this recipe again for my family!!  Thank you!!!

After reading many of the reviews with the no taste comment and to lighten up on the calorie..Best way is to 
1) Spray the casserole pan over butter. 
2) Cook vegatables in olive oil (add some chopped red peppers in it too) 
3) 1 cup skim milk, and 1 cup of Chick Broth. 
4) Additional seasonings when you add pepper ...Garlic powder and Cayenne Pepper works well. Teaspoon of each 
5) When you mix it all together....throw a Teaspoon of soy sauce in it (I'll do soy sauce over salt anyway) 
6) No Cheese- Bread topping only. 
With these variations...It's outstanding! 

Pretty awesome meal with these changes incorporated.

Just love this recipe. Worth the little extra effort to make the sauce.  I don't care for peas so used broccoli instead.    This also freezes very well so we usually make a double batch so we can freeze it for lunches.

Having grown up on tuna-helper, this was such a comforting dish and took me on a sentimental little journey. I had trader joes egg farfalle on hand and it turned out great. Also added broccoli florettes and leftover green beans, but left out the peas since I had none.  One more treat......used Costco dried fancy mushroom mix ( reconstituted, of course) which dressed it up a bit. Make this and you'll be happy to leave those boxed mixes behind....  It does take time, but why not double or triple the recipe and freeze the rest for another time?  I betting it's going to fit in beautifully with my "once-a-month cooking" faves.

Delicious!  Worth a little more effort for a lot more taste.  This really hit the spot.  I also diced up some red pepper and sauteed it with the onion before I popped it in the oven.  Added some color and flavor.

I gave this 5 stars because it has great potential and DOESN'T have canned soup. I didn't have mushrooms, added chopped cilantro to the sauce and extra fresh garlic, as well as one cup of the cheese. Next time I'll top with some Parmesan cheese, as well.  I used soda crackers, rather than bread crumbs, and added the second cup of cheese to the top. Seems like I used every pot and pan in the kitchen, but I WILL make this again, despite the mess. I'd say this is a great make-ahead dish, so the flavors can have time to mellow & permeate the sauce. My adult son said it's awesome & WAY better than using canned soup.  : )

I thought this was fabulous but I too had to doctor it up a little bit as I went for flavor and personal preference.    I used two 10 ounce cans of white chicken instead of tuna just to experiment. I used a large chicken bouillon in the sauce along with adding a little fat free cream cheese and fat free sour cream.  Added more milk, flour than the recipe calls for and used 3/4 can of organic chicken stock. I seasoned it with salt, pepper, paprika and thyme and the sauce turned out perfect! I sauteed the vegetables in a little butter but mostly EVOO and used 1 tablespoon of minced garlic out of the jar to saute the vegetables.  I used the veggies the recipes called for but debated adding 1/2 green pepper and 1/2 of red pepper.  I truly think the chicken bouillon in the sauce and the spices kicked this recipe up a notch as far as flavor.  Gave it more of a flavor punch for sure.   I also along with the one cup of cheddar added some about 1/4 cup of parmesan on the top.  OH MY it was soooooooo good. Thanks for sharing this recipe.  It's a keeper!

After reading the reviews that said it was bland, I decided to add a garlic clove to the vegs, and some cream cheese and sour cream to the sauce. Also a half teaspoon of thyme and some paprika. My husband nearly polished the entire thing off in one sitting,

There was only one recipe I neglected to get from my grandmother and it was for her fabulous tuna casserole.  But, it seems I have found it!  She would NEVER use canned soup in hers but since I am not a great cook, I didn't know how to make white sauce or even what it was!  Thank you to the original contributor!  This has brought back so many wonderful tastes and memories!

Excellent!!  My family just loved this.  Best Tuna Noodle Casserole I've had.  Adjustments I made are: I doubled everything INCLUDING the milk mixture - BUT I tripled the flour/butter mixture.   IF DOUBLING I used 4 chicken boullion cubes in the milk mixture.  Put a dash of white wine vinegar in with the vegies (if you have some), used 4 cloves of garlic minced Added thyme & red pepper (1.5 ts of each).  I used cornflake crumbs instead of bread crumbs.  I added about 1/4 cup of parm cheese, about 1/4 cup of cream cheese (to taste really), 1/2 cup of diced tom in with the mushroom mix, 1/2 cup of the cheeder cheese mix into the milk mixture, and put the other of it on top of the dish.   I omitted the mushrooms since I didn't have any on hand.   It was just fine without them.   Again all the adjustments I listed are to a doubled recipe.  One note:  It is a bit time consuming but well worth it!

FINALLY, a tuna casserole recipe worth making from scratch. Next time I will mix at least half (if not more) of the cheese into the white sauce, and possibly omit the celery. Make sure to slightly undercook the pasta, too.

We loved this!!! It was by far better than the old standby with the condensed cream of mushroom soup. As for it possibly being bland...it's tuna casserole. This is a true comfort food.

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this!!!! Truly delicious and totally worth the extra effort of making the sauce from scratch. I did thin the sauce a bit with a few extra splashes of milk after I added the noodles. I was afraid they woud soak up too much of the sauce while in the oven...I think that was a good call. I didn't need to double the sauce that way. If you are considering trying this recipe I would encourage you to do so. It will not disapoint. My family thought they didn't like tuna casserole but since they have tasted this they have changed their minds!

This is one of my new favorite recipes!  I am not a lover of mushrooms and omitted it the first time I made it but then I felt it was missing something.  Next time I added the mushrooms and loved it!  I never thought I'd WANT to add mushrooms to something and actually eat them!

OMG - SOOOOOOO good!  I had some corn in the fridge and I threw that in too.  Made it perfect with that crispy, sweet addition.  My husband told me that he would rather have this recipe than the Alfredo Tuna Noodle Helper (a long standing family favorite).

We love this recipe. I increase the sauce by an extra half because the casserole seems too dry without it. Like others, I add chicken bouillon to the sauce, and I use a mixed vegetable medley (peas, carrots, corn, etc.) instead of just peas. This is a great comfort food recipe that turns out wonderful every time.

The key to optimum flavor in this is to FINELY chop the onion and celery and really mince the garlic. Use fresh ingredients, real butter and fresh mushrooms and saute' in the butter until they are tender and the flavors mingle. Salt and pepper to taste is also important. It is good with a little extra cheese mixed in the body of the casserole too.

This is a good recipe to build upon. I wanted a casserole that did not rely on canned soup as the flavor base so this was just what I was looking for. I also added some chicken base to my sauce along with lemon pepper, garlic powder and more salt and pepper. I did add some Parmesan cheese to the sauce and use Ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs for a crunchy topping. I did not use more than one pot. I worked in steps and used the same pot I started in. Too many dirty dishes in the original recipe for me. Thank you for your nice casserole.

Not too bad for my first tuna casserole recipe!  The only thing I would skip next time would be the peas -- I just don't like the texture of them in the middle of a bite of casserole.  Great recipe!

when I usually make tuna noodle it's the quick and easy method and I could eat truckloads of the stuff. This recipe was soooo good, and very rich - I could only eat a small bowl of it. It took a little extra time, but well worth it.

I made this recipe last night and as it is written, the sauce will take you straight to Blandsville!  Even an amateur cook (such as myself) should always realize you need more seasoning than just salt, pepper, onion & garlic.  Following the lead of another here, I added the following to the sauce - nutmeg, red pepper flakes, thyme and yes - cream of mushroom soup and cream of celery soup (HORROR!)  LOL!  It bumped the flavor up SIGNIFICANTLY.  I also carmelized the onions, then added the celery and garlic.  I topped it with parmesan, sharp cheddar & french fried onions.  I rate my additions FIVE STARS.  I anticipate the leftovers tasting even better tonight!

*Make sure you have enough sauce and that it's not too thick, otherwise ANY casserole you make will come out dry.

Fantastic!  Both my kids claim to hate tuna, but they both ate this casserole happily.  I omitted the mushrooms and added about 1 cup fresh spinach instead.  I also added 1 tsp of dried parsley, 1 tsp of sage and 1/2 cube of vegetable stock and it was delicious.  I did add about an extra 1/4 cup of milk to thin out the sauce a bit.  The consistency was perfect and this meal will become a staple in my house now.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Fantastic! I used 1/2 cup of half and half and 1/2 cup of water instead of milk. For whatever reason my family doesn't do well with milk, but are ok with half and half. I also added a dash of Old Bay and about a teaspoon of minced jalepeno. It was absolutely delicious :)

As written, I would probably give this three stars as it would have been bland for our tastes.  It is, however, a great base to start.  Once I figure out the last ingredient missing for extra flavor, I would rate this five stars. With 8oz of noodles the amount of sauce seemed fine, but I did melt an additional 1 cup of sharp cheddar into it. Other changes included a little extra onion, 1.5 cloves garlic, 1/2 t nutmeg to sauce, 1/2 t celery salt to sauce, and 1/2 t ground cayenne to sauce.

So good! It has a wonderful creamy, buttery goodness. The only thing I changed was to add a chicken bouillon cube and 1/4 of white wine to the onion mixture, it all cooked down nicely. I have made this several times and will continue to! I didn't have breadcrumbs so I crumbled up Goldfish Cheddar crackers, I thought that tasted better so that's now how I make it, thanks for a great recipe!

Yum! I left out the mushrooms, don't get me wrong I  love mushrooms, just never had them in tuna casserole.  I did add a bit more garlic, I LOVE garlic.  Family loved this, sure beats the canned stuff!  Thanks for the recipe!

Good base recipe, i had never made my own sauce before and this was a good intro to that. I would definetely recommend  aking the sauce in the same pan as the sauteed veggies to get the flavor richness.

This was definitely work all of the prep/cooking time.  It is creamy and delicious.  I added a cup of frozen corn to the mixture (along with the cup of frozen peas).  The next time, I'll triple the breadcrumb topping and bake the casserole in a 8" casserole dish.

Tasty, much better than if it was made with canned soup. I only made 1 change because I didn't have any Chedder,so I used fresh graded Pecerino Ramono instead and found it very tasty. Also I sauted my veggies in my suace pan, saving the need to wash another pan,( it worked well) I made this yesterday but waited untill today to review it because i wanted to see how the leftovers were. This makes alot so I'll get 3 meals out of this. Next time I'll ad a little cayenne to it for a little kick, but very good as written

Even my picky eaters liked this!  Due to those picky preferences, I left out the mushrooms and stirred the cheese into the sauce, but made no other changes.  Very creamy.  Will make again.

This was really good and easy.  I didn't have mushrooms or cheddar cheese.  I only had peas and carrotts mixed, so I used that and instead of cheddar I had to use american and I must say, it was yummy!  Will make again!

This was just OK - don't overcook the roux and don't forget to taste the roux before adding the rest of the ingredients.

Comfort food that everyone enjoyed.  I did have to change the recipe because my husband is allegic to fish, so I used 1/2 a chicken breast, sliced thin and cooked.  Did not use as much butter as the recipe called for and the meal was still rich and delicious.  Pair with a healthy salad and we have a keeper.

Much better tasting than when made with one of Campbell's cream soups.  I'm not a tuna fan but really like this and so do the 4 kids.  Also much better for you made this way.

A very good recipe that just needed a tad more flavor interest. As others recommended, I added 3/4 tsp Thyme,  1/4 tsp nutmeg to the roux, as well as Morton's seasoning to taste and a dash of cayenne. I also shaved the butter back a bit to 3T for the roux, and the crumb/cheese topping doesn't need any butter at all. Really an excellent one-dish meal for a mom that's sick of stocking cream of mushroom soup.

As written, there is not enough sauce or flavor (even after tripling the garlic and adding LOTS of salt and pepper).  It's a great base as a start and I'll use this again, but will make more sauce with a bit more garlic and any other spice I can think of to jazz this up.

This recipe is outstanding! My boyfriend and I love it. I can control the salt content because of making the sauce from scratch. The only change that I made was adding a little nutmeg to the cream sauce for a deeper flavor, then adding the cheese to the sauce like you are making mac and cheese sauce. The best ever!

I thought this recipe was so bland; had absolutely no flavor at all. Its nice to have something completely home made, but overall blah.  I will try some of the other reviewers flavor suggestions if I make it again.

Very good recipe. The recipe seemed like it was missing something.  A little bland.

Delicious!!! Didn't have mushrooms, so those were omitted. Added an extra garlic and celery. Used soy butter, and may have added a bit more ;-) Only a frozen medley of corn, peas, and green beans on hand instead of just peas. Used homemade egg noodles. Soooooooo yummy! 1 yr old and 2 yr old had seconds. 7 yr old had huge bowl. Covered it in the oven so it wouldn't dry out and then placed oven on broil for about 5 minutes to brown and bubble. Might add just a 1/4 c or so of veggie broth next time. It wasn't dry, I just like my casseroles with a little runny sauce. Might add more bread crumbs next time too, or some fried onions on top would be good too. Thanks for the recipe!!!! We really enjoyed it!

Comfort food material for sure. I made a slightly healthier version by using olive oil instead of butter to make the roux. Next time I make it, I will definitely at least double the tuna and mushrooms (if you are a mushroom fan). With the recipe amount, you can hardly find the tuna flakes after it was mixed in with the rest of the ingredients... will be making this again.

I love this recipe. I don't think I ever use as much mushrooms, but what a great, healthy recipe to feed your family. I usually use canned salmon instead of tuna, it's simply better for everyone.

I'm glad to have a tuna casserole recipe that doesn't call for canned soup. However, as others have mentioned it's a little bland. Adding more salt didn't cut it, so I added ground thyme. Yum! Next time, I'll also ad a bay leaf to the sauce, while it's thickening. Thanks!

I thought this recipe was awesome!  I was trying to put my grocery shopping off one more day & found this recipe.  Love that it didn't require condensed soup.  I halved it since it was just for my son and I, we both had 2 helpings and my dad stopped by and had 2 helpings as well.  We were amazed by how tasty it was!  I didn't have any other veggies besides peas but I added lots of onion powder, some pepper, red pepper and mrs. dash to the rue which gave it a nice little kick.  I didn't use quite as much butter as they called for and I used no salt at all.  Also used Italian bread crumbs.  Definitely adding this to my box.

This isn't my mom's recipe!  I've had an aversion to the ol' stand-by version using canned condensed soup.  My kids (6 & 8) loved this, too, so much they asked for it for their bedtime snack!  I accidentally used more pasta, the box was 12oz instead of 8 oz, and it was rotinni, but it was an excellent substitution.  I also used part peas and part brocolli, which was excellent.  I think the key is quality ingredients.  I used high quality tuna and organics for the rest.  Can't wait to eat the left-overs tonight!

Great recipe!  I was a little worried there would be too many mushrooms but it was the perfect amount.  I really prefer the homemade sauce rather than cream of mushroom soup.  As far as tuna casseroles go, this is a winner!

YUM! My boyfriend said I'm not allowed to make tuna casserole with cream of mushroom from a can anymore and my 17 month old said yum yum yum! The only thing I did different was reduce the butter by not using it on the baking dish and only used 1 tbs to mix in with the bread crumbs.

It's good, but not great. Need additional flavor (spices, something with some zip - cayenne?).  Would not rush to make again without research into what might help this stand out, given the somewhat legnthy prep time for a simple casserole.

Everyone enjoyed it in my family, except for my daughter who doesn't care for mushrooms.  The instructinons were very easy to follow and I love that times were given for how long to keep each part.  Turned out great.  Can't wait to eat leftovers tomorrow.

This was pretty good.  Like everyone else, I really appreciate the lack of a canned soup in this recipe.  I followed the recipe pretty closely, just reducing some of the butter, and I found it good, but on the bland side.  I added a little sherry wine at the end, and that really helped.  Next time I'll add more seasoning as I go (extra garlic, maybe some boullion to the sauce) and add the cheese to the sauce instead of on top.  The cheese was odd on top of the breadcrumbs and didn't melt well.  But I will definitely be making this again.

I love the lack of canned soup in this recipe!  I can't give it 5 stars however, because it was a tad on the bland side.  But I will be making it again because I still think bland is better than canned!

i doubled it as others did, which did make 9x13. i listed to others on it being bland, added more garlic, added dill and a few other seasonings. i also added 1/2 the cheese to the sauce and it was STILL BLAND. we are a big tuna loving family and there was not enough tuna taste, maybe add 3cans and had to add alot of salt. honestly i'll still to easy Tuna Helper :(

It was pretty good, but only four stars since i had to take advice from the reviewers...the bechamel sauce was pretty bland without adding thyme and red pepper and nutmeg and some grated parmesan. i left out the mushrooms cause fiancee prefers not. nice hearty servings for less than 400 calories per...if you substitute 1/2 of the milk with chicken broth and use olive oil and cooking spray instead of some of the butter...also, cook the egg noodles in the chicken broth...more flavor :)

I don't usually disagree with so many 4 and 5 star reviews but this didn't impress me.  As written, I found it to be bland and way too oniony - at the same time!  Any maybe I'm just used to my good ol' stand-by recipe with cream of chicken soup but this wasn't creamy at all so it just didn't seem like "tuna casserole" as I know it.  The kids seemed to like it but I'm such a casserole-lover, my dislike for it is taking precedence.  And I agree the previous reviewers - took WAY too much time, effort, and dirty pots and pans to put this together.  Won't be making this one again.

Brought back childhood memories. Better 2nd time with 1 t each dry mustard & dill. I used fried onions as I didn't have dry crumbs on hand. I cut fat with a butter wrapper to grease the pan and 4-5 T total of olive oil & butter to saute vegs, 1T parmesan on top instead of shredded cheese. Saved cleaning another pan by adding flour right to the vegs, then slowly added warm milk. Bow ties worked fine in 2nd batch.

So overall it was good - but that was after i made changes to the recipe. I took the advice of others and added more seasonings --- it DEFINITELY needs more spices. I also cut down on the amount of butter - a must.

This dish was pretty good. My husband didn't like it as much but he's not a big fan of tuna. Since I was the only one eating it we had lots of leftovers. The next day I tried it and it didn't taste as good. Not a great dish for leftovers. Overall it was good.

Loved this.  I skipped the mushrooms and onion because of kids' preferences.  I used dehydrated onion instead.  I skipped the cheese and bread crumbs and used french fried onions on top.  The kids even loved it.  We'll be making this often.

This was a great recipe. I did follow some of the other reviews, like for the mushroom mixture at the end i splashed some white wine in and cooked it down. and i also used the french onions for the topper instead of bread crumbs but all in all i kept everything els the same....oh yeah i also didn't add extra salt because my family likes to add there own....best recipe i have used in long time and it was not expensive to make. Will defiantly keep this one

I changed this recipe just a little. I used 1 percent milk, used arrowroot to thicken the sauce instead of flour and I added a 2 oz of valveeta mexican cheese to give it a little kick.  Other wise came out great.

I found this bland and flavorless despite the addition of more garlic, some dry chicken bouillon and additional tuna.

This is the best by far! I have been looking for a good all in one recipe since I'm not using canned soups anymore. I have been making my own cream soup but this one is better! If I don't have mushrooms, I use more celery, and sometimes I've used canned peas. I also use crushed lays potato chips on top if we have those too. This recipe is awesome and remind me why I love tuna casserole!!

Bland.  Definitely double the amount of tuna and kick it up with your favorite spices.  A good base but needs more.

It was delicious! I'm not much of a tuna fan, but the creamy and cheesy flavor of it was fabulous. The second time I made this, I substituted the egg noodles for rigatoni pasta, and added a bit of jalapenos to give it an additional spicy flavor.

This was so delicious! I followed someones suggestion and made the sauce with one cup chicken broth, one cup milk. Two tablespoons of butter instead of four for the sauce as well. I think that this casserole would be wonderful with chicken instead of the tuna as well.

OMG - this is the best tuna casserole ever!  I'm an accomplished cook and don't necessarily think about making comfort foods very often.  However, my boyfriend told me that tuna noodle casserole was his favorite childhood dish.  I decided to surprise him with it one night, kind of as a joke.  I couldn't brink myself to use canned soup, so was happy to find this recipe.  I thought he would get a laugh and enjoy it, but that it would be a one time thing - one I wasn't going to enjoy very much.  How WRONG I was!  This is FABULOUS!  It was delicious fresh, better as leftovers, and the best were the portions I froze and reheated.  We have it about once a month now, and he requests it whenever we are bringing a dish to a pot luck or when we are traveling to visit friends and family.  Recipe note: I use half the butter, double the onions and garlic, and top the casserole with some shaved parmesan when serving.

I would like to have given this five stars because we enjoyed it so much. But as written, I had to make too many changes to make it more flavorful and healthier. But the methods are simple to follow and produce a really satisfying result. It's a good, basic tuna noodle casserole recipe and easily adaptable for personal preferences. I love that it doesn't used canned soup and I'll keep this recipe for future use with the changes I made as follows: Substitute olive oil for all the butter, and reduce the amount mixed with the flour to 3 T. instead of 4 T. Coat the dish with pan spray instead of butter. To the white sauce, add 1/4 - 1/2 t. each of dried marjoram and dried basil, and a pinch of nutmeg. I also omitted the cheese because it didn't appeal to me. But if you like the idea of the cheese, reduced-fat or extra sharp cheddar I think would give a good result without all the fat of regular med. cheddar. If I can ever find whole wheat egg noodles, I'd prefer to use that, too, for a more nutritious punch.

This was really good.  I gave 4 stars because it was very bland and needed a lot to get it going.  Once seasoned properly, very yummy.  I used rotini pasta instead of egg noodles.  I also used some white wine to deglaze the pan after I had sauteed the veggies.  I added 1/2 the cheese into the sauce.  I didnt have mushrooms, so I added carrots and peas.  I was able to lighten it up by sauteeing the veggies in olive oil and then only using 2 Tbsp butter for the white sauce.

My husband and I both enjoyed this "soup free" version of Tuna Casserole.  I stuck to the basic recipe except did 1 1/2 times the bechamel sauce and added more cheese to the sauce - about a cup on in the sauce and a cup on top with the breadcrumbs (used Panko).  I sauteed the onions, celery and mushrooms - once wonderfully carmelized a bit I added a package of uncooked frozen peas in butter sauce and a half jar of pimento for color.  For the bechamel I used 1 cup of chicken broth and 2 cups of milk to add up to the total liquid.  I also added a bit of thyme, parsley and dried mustard - about 1/2 teaspoon of each.  YUMMM!  This is a great basic recipe and it was really easy to match to play with a few more flavors to make it your own.  No more soup for me!!!!

Great recipe! I always seem to cook more noodles than the recipe calls for, so I ended up adding another 1/2 cup of milk to the mixture after it was in the baking dish. Also, I added about a 1/2 cup or so of shredded cheese to the milk so that it became part of the sauce and was more evenly distributed. Used whole milk and Kraft Shredded 4 Cheese blend - Poppy loved it!!

I was looking for a Tuna Cassarole recipe that didn't call for the prepared "cream of" soups.  My kids really enjoyed this and ate several helpings each.  Next time I think I will make a little more of the roux because it was just a little dry since I added the whole package of noodles which was a little more than called for.  I left out the mushrooms because my kids don't really enjoy them.  Maybe just a little bland but still good and enjoyed by my family.

I was a bit skeptical with this one as it didn't sound like it would be very flavorful...I made a few very minor changes (rice milk because of dairy allergies, replaced 3/4 c of it with beef broth - what I had on hand, and used crushed saltine crakers on top) and it tasted just like my mom use to make - only healthier!!!  My whole family loved it (rare) so I'll definately be making this again and again!!!!  Thank you!

Oh yes! This is a great recipe that you can tweak to your liking. I really don't like using canned soups in my cooking because they are filled with sodium and preservatives. I'm more of a "from scratch" type of cook. I was so glad to find this recipe among the sea of canned cream of somethings out there. Instead of tuna I used canned salmon, rice milk instead of regular milk and added plenty of herbs and spices. Fresh dill, fresh parsley, tarragon, sage, paprika, cayenne, salt and pepper were all used. I also threw in a splash of lemon juice and white wine into the mushroom mixture and increased the garlic. I also used nutmeg in the white sauce as well as a bit of white wine. Sprinkled shredded cheddar and monterey jack cheeses into the mixture as well as on top when in the pan. I topped it with crushed potato chips because they add a nice crunch. I think the people who said this was dry must have baked it too long or their oven was too hot. 25 mins at 375 was just fine! This one is a keeper..try it with a few additions..you'll love it!!

I'm giving this 4 stars because, as a base recipe, I think it's really good. However, as some viewers pointed out, it needs more flavor as is. I took advice from other reviews and used extra virgin olive oil and chicken base/bouillon. I used 6 tbsp e.v. olive oil to put in the recipe and then 2 tbsp of butter to mix with the bread crumbs as the recipe says. I had to add more salt right before I baked it. I forgot to add my chicken base in the sauce when I was cooking it so I mixed a heaping tsp (equals to a little over a bouillon cube) of chicken base. Next time, (oh yes! there will be a next time!) I'll try to remember to mix it in the sauce while I'm cooking it and I may add 1 1/2 to 2 tsps of it. I do realize substituting olive oil for butter makes a difference in the flavor, but even if I had used a whole stick of butter, it would've needed a bit more seasoning.

Overall, great recipe!

Another great review for this recipe.  I didn't have mushrooms (and it was snowing too much for me to go the store) so used sliced black olives instead.  Also used panko bread crumbs.  It was a beautiful thing.  Mom (83) said that she now prefers to have it with the olives! Very tasty, thanks for this recipe.

This was really good. I used crushed Ritz crackers mixed with a little butter on top. You can definitely cut back on the amount of butter the recipe calls for, and be sure to taste the sauce before you add the noodles and mushroom mixture to adjust for seasoning.

I was very excited to create this "from scratch" casserole!  Unfortunately, the fam and myself thought it was pretty bland, even after adding ALOT of salt and ppr.  We stuck to the recipe and even used fresh mushrooms, cooked them w/ the onions & celery.  I will say that the next day when we warmed up the leftovers it tasted MUCH better.  I added some cheddar cheese to the top and sprinkled some bread crumbs on top as well.  I don't know what this casserole needs to make it taste better same day you make it, but we all agreed it needs a "pop" as it's very bland.  I might make this one again and add a can of cream of celery soup.

We loved this one! I added more milk and more butter to make it a little thinner. I also forgot the cheese!! SO we added it on top when we ate it. Even without the cheese though, it was great!
Also, I didn't have tuna, so I used canned chicken, and it was REALLY good! I will make this again.

My daughter requested tuna casserole for dinner the other night(it is her favorite so I make it often) but I didn't have any cans of cream soup so I had to check this site for a recipe that didn't require any.  This was a hit and the first time ever that there was no leftover tuna casserole in this house.  I forgot to mention that I only use about two thirds the amount of noodles because we like ours creamy.

I've made this several times, and keep adapting it a little.
The last time, I added some sherry to the white sauce.
It really accentuated the flavor.....again, NEVER AGAIN to canned soup!

I thought this was very tasty, although it took much longer to put together than I thought it would.  And it turned out really dry.  I think I will add more milk next time, and not use any evaporated milk.  I like using evap. milk to make things more creamy, but I think it may have thickened it up too much.  I used one cup of that with one cup of regular 1% milk.  I didn't do the chicken boullion cube as other's suggested, but I may try that next time.  I reheated some today in the microwave and added some milk beforehand.  It came out great for a quick lunch!  I will make this again, only I'll have to remember to start on it much earlier.. lol

I really enjoyed this recipe, it is a bit time consuming but worth it. I wasn't sure how much salt to use so I probably could have used a bit more but it still came out great and my guys ate every bit of it.

For goodness sake, add some cheese to the sauce as well!  You can leave out the mushrooms or celery if those don't appeal to you.  Very delicious comfort food.

I used this recipe along with the suggestions offered in the reviews:
2 med onions; 4-5 cloves of garlic; 2 stalks of celery; 16oz mushrooms; 3/4 can of low-sodium chicken broth + 2 tsp "Better Than Bullion" (for thinning and flavor to the end mix) 
For the herbs/spices, I chose dill, marjoram, dried parsley, nutmeg, and dry mustard which I added to the roux. I doubled the cheese and added half to the roux and half in the full mixture itself. I topped with garlic breadcrumbs mixed with parmesan.

I'm going to give this four stars because I think the problems others have been having stem from an error in the ingredient list rather than a problem with the recipe itself. The standard formula for white sauces/bechamel using flour, fat, and milk is for 1 tbsp of fat and 1 tbsp of flour will thicken one cup of liquid. So if you have four tbsp of butter and 1/4 cup (also four tablespoons) of flour, then you have to put FOUR cups of milk in, or it will be way too dry and tight. I made it that way, and allowing for variations in seasonings, it worked great for us. Try it again with this change, maybe you'll like it too.

Super yummy! I had spiral noodles on hand so I used them and used 16 oz. I used EVOO to sauté the veggies and subbed it for half the butter in the rue, as we'll.  I added the butter and flour mixture in the mushroom mixture (less dishes and same result).

As almost everyone else notes you'll want to season the sauce.  I also made the sauce more creamy by instead using 1 cup of half and half with 1 cup of milk, and adding 1 cup of cheddar cheese.  On top of the casserole I put a half cup of cheddar cheese and French fried onions. With these adjustments the casserole was perfect.

Too dry.  Add some of the juice drained from the tuna and reduce the amount of salt the recipe calls for.  I also added 1/4 tsp. of cayenne pepper to the sauce.  You could also add two or three chopped hard cooked eggs to the mixture..

I can't imagine why anyone is worried about the milk and butter in this recipe since it is for 6. Unless you plan on eating the whole thing yourself. Liked it just as it is.

Great comfort food dish. I added an extra can of tuna for more protein. I also made a gluten-free version with GF elbow macaroni and potato starch instead of the flour. Thanks for sharing!

I do not like hot tuna . . . at all!  I usually only eat tuna in homemade tuna salad.  However, this was amazing!  My family loved it!  I left the base recipe alone (mostly).  I did add some seasoning salt to the veggie mix, took another reviewers advice and cooked the Peas (I actually used peas and carrots) for about 4 minutes with the noodles, and also added some seasoning salt and badia seasoning to the "gravy" mix.  I also used French onions on the top instead of the bread crumbs.  So, I say I left the base recipe alone because I didn't change anything except adding the carrots and the seasonings.  I can't believe I am giving a tuna noodle casserole 5 stars.  I used the skinny egg noodles and rinsed them in cold water after cooking so they wouldn't get mushy in the oven...it was perfect and yummy and I will make it again!  I plan on trying to change up the tuna and use ground chicken and ground beef to get different versions!  Thanks for a great recipe!

We LOVE this recipe! because of other reviews we added a bit more flavouring like big pinch of dill and some veggie bouillon. We also used crushed buttery crackers instead of breadcrumbs. There was NONE leftover at the end of the meal. Will definitely be making again!

This recipe was amazing. By reading others reviews this is what I came up with and came out FANTASTIC!! an entire package of egg noodles no yolk, and threw the peas in the last few minutes of boiling, my sauce consisted of 1 stick of butter, 1 cup of onions, then added 1/2 cup flour slowly, then 2 cups milk, 2 cups of chicken broth, 2 cups of Monterey jack cheese and 2 oz. of cream cheese. I would say the chicken broth, or chicken cubes along with choosing a flavorful cheese are super important in this recipe, otherwise it is just too plain! Back to the recipe: then threw it all together including a large can of tuna drained and I put 1 sleeve of Ritz garlic butter crackers on top as my "breadcrumbs" and sprayed with non stick spray so they would be golden brown. Baked at 375 for 25 minutes!!!

I try to avoid 'cream of' soups and processed cheese whenever possible so I chose this recipe because of it's homemade sauce. My family devoured this tuna casserole, it's delicious! Because everything is smaller these days, including tuna cans (most are 5 oz. now), I added a third because I wanted to have plenty. I made no other changes and this will be my 'go to' tuna casserole from now on.

The first time I followed to the letter and was a bit blah about the whole thing, but then I put my culinary skills to work and it turned out great with a few minor changes. I sauted the onions and celery together, then added 2T of butter, added the mushrooms, peas, AND the tuna (water and all) and allowed it to simmer. I took out the garlic clove, and went with garlic powder for a stronger, oomph of garlic flavor that I missed the first time around. The final change was in the milk/flour mix. I added more butter than called for, another shot of garlic powder, salt, pepper, and extra flour to make it thicker than one would want, because I knew mixing it in with the extra liquid from throwing the tuna water in, would offset. It came out PERFECT! Creamy, delicious, and absolutely a new recipe for the book!

Excellent! As a BIG fan of tuna casserole, I can honestly say this is one of the best I've ever eaten. It's too bad tuna casserole has such a bad reputation. Most people I know (including my hubs) snub their nose at the mere thought of this classic "mommy special." Admittedly, tuna casserole is nothing fancy (it was a budget dinner my mom prepared regularly for our family) but this one is DEFINITELY worth giving a try. The homemade sauce REALLY makes this something special. I pretty much followed  MVANWINKLE's directions to the letter, but did make a couple of *minor* changes. Because my hubs and I are not fans of mushrooms, I left them out. I also added what was left of my package of cheddar (~ 1/4 c. worth) in addition to the 1 c. I garnished my casserole with. Perfecto! Potato chips were a perfect pairing for our simple dinner. Thanks SO much for sharing your recipe, MVANWINKLE! The fact that this is yummy AND yields a modest serving well-suited for smaller families (like mine!) makes this a winner in my book. This will be added to my weekday menu rotation for sure! :-)

Didn't have mushrooms or celery so I put in frozen carrots and green beans.  My 3 year old son ate 4 bowls!  Subbed bread crumbs for crushed crutons.  Made the roux with the onions and garlic in it.  Only baked 15 minutes so it didn't dry out.  My kids requested this one to be repeated.  Will do.

Left out the mushrooms because I'm not a fan, also left out the cheddar cheese and put an 8oz package of cream cheese and 4 big spoonfuls of mayonnaise in with the milk, melted that down and continued the recipe as directed. Pretty good!

I change this recipe a lot so I'm sure you wonder why I gave it five stars. I mostly change it though out of laziness. I don't use the flour at all. I just use cream in place of the milk. This way I don't have to really make the sauce. Otherwise I follow others advice of adding a bouillon cube and doubling the crumb topping. My husband adores this recipe. Oh and if I don't have mushrooms or celery I just leave them out.

Thought it was ok, didn't have a lot of flavor. Had to add a lot of salt.

This was the best tuna noodle casserole we've ever eaten. I did not salt it too heavily, and I did cut down on the butter a little bit. I doubled the peas and used baby bella mushrooms (on sale) and they were perfect in this dish. The extra sharp cheddar on the bread crumbs on top was fought over when this dish became leftovers! Very good!

I took the advice of the most popular reviews, and although I had no celery or mushrooms and only one can of tuna, this was the best tuna casserole ever. It's best when it has mostly cooled- the buttery, cheesy flavors come out. I used penne pasta, slightly undercooked, and they were perfectly cooked after baking 20 minutes. This would also be very good with sausage or leftover chicken. I can't wait to make this again, with other cheeses and veggies. I wish it were a little lighter on butter (I used margarine), but I didn't need to add it to the breadcrumbs- just sprinkled them over the top with salt and pepper. Thanks for a great recipe!

I am in love with this recipe, it reminds me of what my grandma used to do for her tuna noodle casserole. I only wish it would use real Tuna instead of canned Tuna that way it is really fresh and old school but I have no clue how to do that! I always add a bit more garlic in this recipe and spray the dish with cooking spray instead of butter. This dish re-heats well the next day in a microwave so great for "sack lunch at work"

This casserole was really yummy!  I added 1/2 t. paprika and 1/2 t. parsley to the sauce before adding tuna and all the other stuff.  Definitely thought it added a little bit of extra flavor!

I decided to make this after my mom mentioned it. I loved the idea of making it completely from scratch including the fresh mushrooms. The only thing I did different was I used panko breadcrumbs which added a nice buttery crunch on top. The cheese got nice and hard forming a delicious crust. Everyone had seconds and it was gone in no time. I will definitely be making this again.

Really great recipe!  I did cut out a lot of the butter to make it a little healthier which I think compromised the flavor a little.  Nothing that a little bit of seasoning won't fix!  I added parmesan cheese and cayenne pepper. yum!

Great foundation recipie. Also super easy to adapt to a gluten free diet: do about 2 tbsp of sweet rice flour instead of the regular flour (sweet rice flour is sticker and more "glutenous").

Delicious- one and 1/2 recipes fills a 9X13 perfectly.  I left out the mushrooms, put most of the cheese in with the sauce (saved a little for the top) and only used 1 stick butter total, including the amount melted for the breadcrumbs.  Yum!

Some of the other reviews said that there wasn't enough sauce in this recipe, so I increased the amount of sauce in step 4 by 50%. I used 6 tbsp butter, 1/4 + 2 tbsp flour, and 3 cups milk.  I used a 9 x 13 pan and found that there weren't enough bread crumbs, so I doubled them.  Also, once I had everything mixed together it did seem a little bland.  I doctored it up by adding 1 tbsp. parsley, 1 tsp. celery salt, and a little more salt and pepper than what I had originally put in.  As is, I only gave the recipe 4 stars, but after making these changes I think it deserves 10!  It was excellent and I will be making it again!

Just an FYI for those that think using a non fat cooking spray is better for you...read the serving size on that.  If you can spray the can in 1/3 of a second to only make it one serving and no fat..u would have been the fastest in the west.

I LOVE this recipe!  I always like to make meals from scratch so I was so happy to find this one with no canned soup.  The only change I made was that, as other reviewers had recommended, I put half of the cheese right in the sauce.  I doubled the whole recipe so it would feed my family, the single batch wouldn't go far.  Next time I may try a nice sharp white cheddar or other sharp cheese for a nice flavor.  This is a keeper for sure!

This recipe was a true test of my cilinary skills, but it was SO GOOD! It reminds me of a time BEFORE pre-packaged, frozen microwaved dinners. This is why Home Economics should be a part of every high school curriculum! Wonderful recipe!

WOW!!  I have never made a better tuna casserole!  I heeded the advice from the other reviews and ampted up the flavor with extra garlic and celery and we don't like mushrooms so I used carrots.  Creamy delicous and no one left my house without the recipe!  I would highly reccomend giving it a try!

This was "just like Mom used to make" with the white sauce.  I left out the garlic (only because Hubby isn't a big fan).  It could have used more salt/flavor, so next time I'll try some of the suggestions from other reviews to spice it up a bit.  Still was good and enjoyable.  Real comfort food as this was my childhood favorite on Fridays!

A suggestion . . . many of you said it was too dry.  Consider that electric and gas ovens heat differently.  If a recipe calls for 350 degrees, for instance, that's fine for an electric oven . . . but for gas, always lower the temperature by 15 degrees . . . that goes for everything, baked goods included.  The recipe should have been creamier.  More white sauce was required.

I took some advice from other reviewers and added more garlic, 1 tsp dill, 1/2 tsp Tony Chatere's, 1/2 tsp Spike, 1/8 tsp pepper. I used 1 cup each of veg broth and cream, threw in a bay leaf and reduced it for 20 min (instead of the flour, butter and milk). Combined with tuna, peas, and cheese. Topped with French's onions. Mmmmmm

What a great dish! I substituted red and green bell pepper for the cery and peas since I didn't have any on hand. But the rest was per the recipe. The whole family loved it, even my 4 year old.

For health reasons I used less butter and cream, added more broth and pepper. Loved this recipe and it was totally easy! Never again will I make it from condensed soup.

promised so much, did not deliver. added more sauce like others recomended- 1/2 cup more milk, less flour and butter- and used crushed potato chips on top- now, I seasoned with lots of salt and pepper, red cayenne pepper (cause it was still so bland) and a little thyme- it was so blah I felt bad making my husband eat it- also dry. I know it has lots of potential and I like it because there's no canned soups in it but they was just something missing... did not save for leftovers

So much better than using a "cream-of" from the can...please try this because it's worth the little bit of extra effort.  I am taking off one star because I prefer to add some sour cream into the sauce to give it a nice tanginess and elevate the flavors.  Even without sour cream this is MUCH tastier than using soup from a can!

Wonderful guidelines for a great dish! I can't have dairy, so I used soy milk and added a cup of Daiya vegan cheddar cheese to the sauce. Worked super well. I also noted what people said about it occasionally being a bit dry, so I drizzled a little extra soy milk over the top for extra moisture. Note to self: fresh peas need to be sauteed a little longer than the onions and celery.   Overall, creamy, moist and delicious. Thanks for sharing!

As other reviewers suggested I added a chicken cube to the sauce & french fried onions to the top. I also doubled the cheese. It's a good, solid comfort food recipe for weeknights but didn't look pretty enough for guests. Nonetheless I'll be putting it into my regular rotation because I really enjoyed it!

With changes: replaced tuna with chicken, used 1/2 the butter, replaced milk with 1 can evaporated milk & 1 can chicken broth, used 1/2 bag of noodles. Added to the cream sauce: 1/8 t of each: thyme, red pepper, nutmeg, celery seed, and 1/4 pkg cream cheese. YUMMY!

Great recipe.  Some adjustments that really brought out the flavor: Added a splash of white cooking wine to vegetables Added 1 tbsp of garlic salt to sauce Added scallions Crushed saltines on top with shredded extra sharp cheddar I also doubled the sauce - 4 cups of milk, 1/2 cup of flour, b/c I used a whole 12 oz bag of whole wheat egg noodles.  I also used a lot more vegetables which is why I needed more sauce.  Also used more garlic than called for (about 6 cloves).  Excellent!  Different textures with a lot of flavor.

Our family really liked this simple 'comfort food' recipe.  I doubled the sauce and was able to make 2 small casseroles, one to bake now, and one to freeze. I would suggest using a sharp cheddar on top (for more flavor). I added a little minced garlic with the bread crumb/butter mixture and the house smelled soooo good!!! Thanks for taking me back to the 80's!!!!

Very good. I decreased the butter a bit and used about 1 tablespoon with Panko bread crumbs and some grated Parmesan cheese for the topping instead of the cheddar. I also added some thyme and lemon pepper to the sauce.

Great Recipe... I've made it several times already.  I don't use as much butter as suggested though and it still comes out delicious.  I skipped the mushrooms (my son's not a fan) and used corn flake crumbs in place of bread crumbs, not buttered, just straight sprinkled it on top of the casserole.  Easy way to sneak in extra veggies too... the kids love it!!

Great dish.  Like others I made some changes and didn't keep it to scratch because I didn't have the time.  I used a cooking spray to coat my pan, I used cream of mushroom soup, but heated it with 1/4c white wine, 1/8tsp buffalo hot sauce, italian spices, frozen peas & carrots (that stayed firm while baking), parmesean cheese, and 1/2c plain yogurt.  I topped my casserole with casserole blend cheese and Ritz crackers.  My husband and I really enjoyed this dish and it made plenty!  I'll be making this again.

Finally, a recipe for tuna casserole that doesn't include canned cream of mushroom soup!  Thank you.  A great tasting recipe, maybe a little bland, but nothing that a little Worcestershire sauce couldn't fix.

I went with the 2nd reviewers adjustments and added some. To the celery, onion mixture I added spinach, tomatoes, nutmeg, thyme and salt and pepper then tossed in the tuna to the mixture  for more taste.  Then I made the sauce as directed but added cream cheese, parm cheese and left out the cheddar, I put it all into a bowl and tossed the noodles into the mixture and added frozen peas.  I taste tested it, and it was missing something, so I added a 1/2 can of cream of mushrooms and topped with bread crumb topping... Yummy!!!

Simple and delicious!  I only had bowtie noodles to use and left out the mushrooms as my husband despises them and it was still great.  I'll be making this regularly this winter.

This was a very homey, yummy comfort dish that totally knocks the canned soup edition out of my repertoire! I added chopped carrots (to the sauteed mix)and used about half the amount of butter called for. I really like that it is a quick recipe that calls for items I usually have in my pantry or fridge.

This was by far the best tuna casserole I have ever eaten or made. I love that the sauce is made from scratch! The flavor is delicious. The only think I changed was to leave out the mushrooms, my husband doesn't like them.

Blech! We didn't like this. It was incredibly flavorless. I added a few extra herbs and such cuz I felt like what was called for wouldn't be enough. I didn't like the topping. My husband and I each had one helping, then that was it. I didn't save any of it (I eat leftovers for lunch every day).

This was very good just as written.  I have made it twice and it is worth it to not use the condenced soup.  I have made it a third time with canned chicken because I was out of tuna and it was good as well.

Finally a tuna casserole that doesn't take like cream of any kind of soup.  I made as is, and wasn't too bland for the kids. For a more adult flavor, you can spice it up.  Even bland it tasted better than the ususal processed soup and processed fried onion topped version.

Only rated down from 5 stars because I think it's got more fat than it really needs. Pretty easy to lighten, and still tastes great.

REALLY good.  Perfect for the traditional recipe, but we, too, tweaked it a bit for more flavor which is the ONLY reason I 4-starred instead of 5.  (But we're Salt-ies). The recipe is great for that, just taste everything right before you pop in the oven.  For us, we added another can tuna, a healthy sprinkling of chicken bouillon granules, a touch more salt, pepper, and dried dill then gave a good stir and baked.    My casseroles w/cheese and breadcrumb topping I always do this: heat the butter and breadcrumbs in the microwave, mix well then toss in the cheese w/your fingers to coat well.  Broil at the end for crunchiness.  ANOTHER NOTE - we didn't use 2 pans.  Start everything in a big skillet, then after really getting the veggies tender, I added the flour - stirring to coat everything well - then the additional butter, smoothing the mixture as it melts.  Then gradually whisk in your milk.  Add noodles, veggies, then fold in tuna. ONE PAN!

I thought this dish was pretty tasty, but it called for too much butter. I decreased the amount of butter by about half, and it still tasted very good. I used whole wheat rotini and it turned out great. It tasted so much fresher than casseroles made with canned soups do. This is a keeper. :)

This is my new favorite tuna casserole recipe!  I thought my old recipe was good until I made this one!  I followed the directions exactly - actually had everything on hand for a change - and it came out perfect!  I did use two 1 1/2 qt casserole dishes, as it made quite a lot.  We ate one, and I'll freeze the other for later.

So happy to find a recipe with no canned soups! I tweaked the recipe a bit by cutting the butter in half & adding more garlic. I used 1 cup of milk with 1 cup of organic chicken stock for more flavor. Added the cheese to the sauce. Very tasty casserole!

I thought it was bland, just like other reviewers, so I took some suggestions and added nutmeg, red pepper flakes, and thyme. This absolutely is necessary and makes this bland dish spectacular! Love the crunchy breadcrumb topping, I used extra sharp cheddar cheese. Will make this again and again.

With a little tweaking, this recipe could be 5 stars.  But it's a must try for those who are looking to avoid all the gunk that's in condensed cream of whatever canned soups.  It's a very flexible base to use to suit your needs.  In fact, I made it dairy free, using 2 c. chicken stock and 1 c. Rice Dream in place of the milk (I added extra liquid because other reviewers said it dried up a little when it was baked.)  I divided the recipe in half and my son and I ate the dairy free version, and my husband ate it with cheese.  I also doubled the onion and celery and added a bit of thyme.  Any topping will do but I used crushed cracker crumbs and potato chips.  Tasty.  Thanks for sharing.

I try to make recipes the first time without making changes so I can fairly judge Them.  As others said this is pretty bland, probably becuase of the low sodium content that would normally come from the soup.  We added salt to the finished product, but it needs something else.

This was like homemade mac & cheese meets REAL tuna casserole (no canned soup).  Absolutely delicious.  I followed another reviewers idea by using the chicken boulion and french fried onions on top, we loved it.  Looking forward to leftovers, thank you!

Pretty good as a base recipe, as others have said.  My changes:
~Skipped the mushrooms (didn't have any in the house, I bet they make it better.)
~Cooked the onion/celery/garlic mixture until the onions began to caramelize, to add more flavor to the dish.
~Skipped the cheddar because it tends to get give baked dishes a slick, greasy feel when used as a topping. Had I any Gruyere in the house I would have used it, I bet it would work perfectly.
~Used one pouch of tuna instead of two cans, the flavor of the pouch tuna is far superior.
~Substituted panko bread crumbs for regular bread crumbs.  Everything that calls for regular bread crumbs has a better texture with panko.

It came out delicious, even to my picky palate.

This tastes great! In the past I have used the cream of mushroom soup, but never again. I used about 4-5 oz of penne pasta as that is what we had, and it was great. I would love some suggestions though about how to cut down on the butter a little. The topping is wonderful too.

This is a wonderful, traditional recipe that your great grandma would recognize ("Real Food," that is).  Like most home cooks, I tweaked it a bit, using half the noodles (only 4 oz instead of 8 oz). Also, I think it is important to try to find low-mercury canned tuna. If you google it, you'll find various coastal co-ops that sell canned tuna from low-mercury smaller fish, packed in their own juice. Expensive, but one can is equivalent to two or more grocery store cans. So I used only one can of tuna, instead of two in this recipe. I also added 1/2 diced red bell pepper for the sweet flavor and nice color. Also, I baked it for 35 minutes instead 25 (uncovered) to get it bubbly.

I just used Pam in the baking dish instead of butter.  I left out the mushrooms and the peas because my husband doesn't like either of them, but it was still delicious!  I used about 4 Tbls Italian Style bread crumbs which gave it a great extra flavor. 

Next time I think I might add a little more milk and flour.  It wasn't as creamy as I expected...but still yummy.

This was really good! I decreased the butter and flour to 3 tbsp each for
the sauce and then topped off the bread crumbs (I used panko)with a tbsp of butter, divided. I also omitted the cheese, but I think I will add it next time! Also, adding salt to the veggies as you cook it as well as to the white sauce adds more depth and flavor to this recipe rather than adding salt at the very end.

This was honestly very good.  To previous reviewers who want a "wet" tuna noodle casserole, this is not your recipe.  Those are the ones that require canned soup.  This recipe also made a nice presentation.  I gave it 4 stars because it took 3 dirty pans and cutting board.  LOL!

I've been wishing for a tuna casserole recipe without canned soup, but I think this one is lacking. Part of the point of tuna casserole is that it is rich, comforting food. Without the creamy richness, the lack of flavor becomes obvious. This either needs something fatty to make you happy or something zesty and flavorful to compensate for the fact that you're eating canned tuna and macaroni. I'm still looking for a flavorful version.

This was wonderful. It's a cold day here in Chicago. (20 below with the wind chill factor). My Mother just recently passed away and I needed some homemade comfort food that Mom use to make. I used 1% milk no mushrooms(to lazy to go out doors to buy them) and only one can of white albacore tuna in water drained. I also added 1/2 the grated cheddar to the milk mixture once it was thickened. This was just what the doctor ordered. Thank you for sharing this wonderfully warm food to comfort my soul.

Excellent!  I used evaporated canned milk with additional regular milk.  Next time I would add a bit more milk, as it was a bit thick.  I used salt, pepper, celery salt and a bit of crushed red pepper in the cream mixture.  

Excellent!  :)

Will be making this one again.

I have never had a good recipe for tuna noodle casserole-until today.
I doubled the recipe, my only improvements to it are:  The salt and pepper, 1 tsp. of salt, and about the same amt. for the pepper. Also, try adding in about 1 tsp. or more of celery seed. It adds a great taste to it, but, keep in mind that it is celery seed, so, not spicy, hot or anything like that. 
It really does help to make it taste even better.
The topping is great-going to make more of that next time. Thanks for a top-notch Tuna Noodle Cass.

After trying this recipe, I will not be going back to the usual condensed soup method of making this dish. It was reasonably quick and easy, and I was very happy with the results. I used about half the butter that it called for to make it a bit healthier. If you wanted to make it extra creamy substituting fat free half and half for the milk would work very well. I used only 2 tablespoons of flour, doubled the garlic, added a splash of lemon juice, some parsley, and one chicken bullion cube to the cream sauce. Last, I crushed crackers and sprinkled them on top instead of bread crumbs. This one is a keeper!

My husband loved this and the recipe is very forgiving.  I used fresh Basa that I fried in a pan before flaking and I substituted zucchini and yellow squash for the onion and celery.  I left out the peas and the butter with the bread crumbs... Threw some italian seasoning in the milk as well.
Tasted Great!

I doubled this recipe and made it in a 9x13 pan and it fit perfectly.  As others suggested, I added some nutmeg, celery seed and red pepper flakes to the white sauce, although perhaps not enough because my husband noted that it needed a bit more flavor (I'll add more spices next time).  I used seasoned bread crumbs and sharp cheddar for the topping and it was delicious.

Made this exactly as the recipe said....it was delicious!  I also used whole grain egg noodles for a healthier choice, and I couldn't even tell the difference in taste.  I'm going to make it again today for dinner, but with leftover grilled chicken instead.

Best thing about this recipe is no need for consensed soup, which is hard to find here in Germany. It was slightly bland, but still a keeper.

FINALLY a recipe which does not include canned soup as an ingredient!  I appreciate scratch cooking and it was refreshing to find this recipe.  I didn't make many changes to it.. my kids don't like too many spices so it was perfect.  I DID add the nutmeg as suggested by another reviewer and it added just enough flavor.  Will definitely make this again!

I jazzed this up quite a bit & still thought it was bland (although my grandson & hubby didn't seem to think so...maybe it's a guy dish). I used EVOO to saute the veggies & I  only used 3 tbp of butter to make the roux. It got too thick really fast so I added some vegetable broth. I  added lots of Old Bay & onion powder to the sauce as well as 4 slices of American cheese (lots of salt & pepper too) & I used crushed potato chips instead of the bread crumbs ( I had some on hand & wanted to get rid of them). Sorry but I prefer the tuna casseroles using cream of mushroom soup. They have more flavor.... and if you use Healthy Request soup, they're not as bad for you as people think. Thanks for the recipe though!

This was wonderful!  I did add 4 oz. Velveeta to the sauce and it made it so good!  I also only used about 6 oz. of noodles instead of 8.  I think it would not have been as creamy.  Very easy to make and it heats up well the next day.

I used tortiglioni instead of egg noodles because I already had them in my pantry.  I also used a dutch oven for step 4 to save on cleanup...one less dish to wash since it could go directly in the oven for baking.  Tasted great!

I was debating whether to heed most other reviewers that advised adding more liquid than called for, but I opted to follow instuctions carefully.
Wrong decision. It was too dry for my taste, although it was tasty. My picky son and his Mom both ate their share. In fact, they each finished up all the leftovers the next day.
I will make again for sure, but next time will heed everyone's advise and go with adding more liquid as well as cooking noodles more fully.

This recipe as written is justOK- but it can be doctored into something very tasty. The other reviewers were right- it needed some pizzaz! I added many of the additions recommended- extra onions, garlic, white wine, red pepper flakes, marjoram, S&P, more cheese,milk and tuna. What really made the flavor pop was my own addition of quartered fresh grape tomatoes! They added a whole other dimension of flavor to this dish!

Good stuff! My kids are rating this a really big five! I would have rated it a four because I, although used about twelve ounces of pasta, added four cans of tuna and doubled the sauce. I used green bell pepper in place of the celery and added my usual garlic and onion powders plus some dry mustard. As other reviewers stated, this is true comfort food and I'll never go back to the soup version recipes again. Thanks "Winkle"!

I thought it was good but perhaps a little bland.  Definitely two cans of tuna are required.  I have never added cheese in the past, and that certaily adds some flavour and interest.    It brings back memories from the past....... thank you!

This just didn’t have the same effect with the cheese just on top, but I did like the bechamel.  I’ll try it again some time, and increase the cheese; mixing it throughout the casserole

This is way better than the canned soup version. To make it more flavorful, I replace half  of the milk with broth. I also don't make an entire 8 oz package of noodles, because it tends to dry out when baking.  I also add the cheese (1/2 cup) to the sauce instead of sprinkling it on top.  I bake it 10 minutes covered, and 10 minutes uncovered.

This really is an excellent recipe. I followed the recipe to the letter except I left out the salt :-p (mistake!)  and when I went to the cupboard to get the tuna after preparing all the other ingredients wouldn’t you know that I was OUT. I subbed in salmon but honestly it wasn’t as good as tuna would have been. The casserole WAS better the second day so this might be one you make ahead? Anyway, it’s a keeper.

My family liked this...particularly my 8 yr old son. I did add more tuna to ham the recipe calls for. Also, I will make more sauce next...just a tad dry this time. I will definitely make it again.

I quite enjoyed this recipe. My only change was I used canned salmon. We enjoyed it with our neighbor. Whom also was smiling when he went home with leftovers. I’ll make this again.

Takes a bit more time to prepare but was well worth the effort.  Others mentioned it could be prepared in a more healthy fashion, but this is not a dish I make frequently so I go for the taste and gusto...  Delish!

This one is a keeper!  We are a family with Celiac disease so I have to modify recipes to make them gluten free.  All of the canned condensed soups have wheat in them so was missing a good tuna casserole. Even better to make from scratch with real food! The only adjustments I made were to substitute the noodles, flour and bread crumbs with gluten free versions. Awesome comfort food!

Not a  lot a flavor, and too dry and gummy.  The gummy texture  is from only cooking the noodles “al dente” — they suck all the moisture out of the white sauce while they finish cooking in the oven.   I believe they should be cooked completely before mixed with rest of the ingredients.  This isn’t good enough to make ever again.

After getting tired of reading reviews on how people completely changed recipe then gave it 5 stars.  I decided to make this as recipe states.  We all thought it was delicious.  The first time I have ever had tuna casserole.  Will be making it again.  As for changing it, I just tasted sauce and tweaked salt and pepper to my tastes.

One of the best recipes for Tuna Casserole I've made/had in a long time. I am used to making it with cream of mushroom soups so I was excited to try it differently. I embellished on the spices and was still able to taste the celery, tuna, and cheddar separately. (Mushrooms were left out because not everyone enjoys them in my household). I would definitely make this again and share with friends & family!

3/11/2017  

When trying out a new recipe for the 1st time, it doesn't get "tweaked", but made as written by the person that sent it in.
  Made this tonight, & the only exception that was made was in using canned mushrooms as I didn't have the fresh ones.
  It was "hubby approved" as well as "son approved" (son is 39 years old).
  CONS: It would have been nice to be told that the recipe fits a 9" x 13" X 2" baking dish instead of a "medium baking dish". ( The recipe was not doubled).
  The recipe was time consuming to make.
  PROS: No canned soup in this! 
  Good enough to serve to company. It makes enough for at least 6 people.
  This probably will be tweaked the next time it is made. Haven't decided how this will be done. This recipe is a keeper.

My husband & I devoured this! My mom made tuna casserole all the time growing up but this was definitely a more gourmet(ish) version. Absolutely making again. But I did read reviews and make several changes/additions. I doubled the recipe. Used quinoa pasta. Used the cuisinart to finely chop the mushrooms, onion and celery. Bought minced garlic in a tube and used quite a bit more than the recipe called for. We love garlic! I added a lil red wine (red was all I had) to the veggies. I also didn't grease the baking dish with butter, but used Pam and lined it with foil for easier clean up. As a reviewer suggested I added 1 chicken bouillon cube to my cream sauce and added half the cheddar cheese in my sauce as well as a lil grated Parmesan. I added a lil thyme to the mixture. And with my breadcrumbs I added less butter (to cut back on all the butter!) it turned out phenomenal!! We've eaten it 3 days in a row and can't wait to make it again. The flavor was absolutely delicious!!

I used more celery and added a dose of (brand name)Louisiana Hot Sauce 7. Also I've made 3 casseroles and frozen 2 on multiple occasions now and it reheats wonderfully.

I've made this dish three times:  twice with tuna and once with salmon.  I make this recipe as written with one exception, I use three cans of tuna as I like to have more "meat" in each bite.  This is going to be the tuna-noodle casserole I use from now on.  I like the "firmness" of it.  I saw that others thought it was too dry, but I liked how it sets up.  You can certainly adjust the seasonings.  I think a dash of cayenne pepper would work really well or Lawry's seasoning salt.

This is sooooo good! My family loves it. I love that it doesn't use any canned mushroom soup. I took other members' advice. I doubled the sauce and added cayenne pepper (~1/2 to 1 tsp). I also had to add a bit more flour (~1/8 cup) to thicken the sauce. I used frozen peas and carrots. I was out of egg noodles and used macaroni instead. Very yummy and delicious and will definitely make it again!

I've made this twice.  The first time I followed the recipe and although it was good it needed something.  This time I added some spices ... thyme, oregano, basil and dill and upped the garlic to three and subbed some chicken broth to the 2 cups of milk.   We don't care for tuna so subbed chicken.  Much better.  Will make this again and again.  So much better than any canned soup recipe.

Was excited to find this recipe because it did not use cream of something soup.Followed recipe exactly first time I made this. Was a very good base recipe, just not a lot of flavor. Second time I made this, tweaked as follows according to what I had on hand at home, and advice from other reviews: used quartered grape tomatoes instead of mushrooms, sauteed with onions, garlic, and celery with kosher salt and ground peppercorns to taste. Removed to bowl. In saute pan, used 1.5 cups skim milk with 1/2 cup of chicken broth for roux. Added celery seed, pepper, pinch of cayenne pepper, and salt to roux-along with half of the cheddar cheese. Mixed everything together in saute pan. Used 1/2 panko crumbs and 1/2 grated parmesan cheese with melted butter over casserole, then sprinkled with 1/4 c cheddar cheese (3/4 cup cheddar used in total for recipe). placed saute pan in oven and baked as directed. Very tasty.

Delicious! It was my husband's first try at a casserole and he nailed it!
I, too think I'd like a little more sauce by adding more liquid (i.e. chicken broth).  Have passed it on to several others.  Good job MVANWINKLE

I made this exactly as directed with two small exceptions. I used only one skillet and added a generous dash of cayenne pepper.  My husband really did not like tuna noodle casserole until he had this tuna noodle casserole.   It is a keeper.

Thank you for this recipe! I am lactose intolerant so I can't use canned cream of anything and have been missing casseroles as a result!  This allowed me to use lactose free milk which was great!  Like some other reviewers I took some short cuts as well.  I threw the frozen peas (and some broccoli) and mushrooms into the water after the noodles had cooked to thaw them then drained the pot and tossed it all into the casserole dish and mixed with a few pats of butter then poured the milk mix on top and stirred in the tuna.  I also used truffle salt and pepper in the milk mix.  Topped with dried onions.  So good!

Tuna Noodle Casserole from Scratch Haiku: "No need to thaw peas, nor use butter on the dish. But the rest? Oooooohhh yeaaaah." This was SO good, and I was thrilled to make a tuna noodle casserole that didn't have a Cream of This-or-That soup in it. Only things that I did differently were just tossing in the peas frozen, and using non-stick spray on the baking dish, and topping half of the casserole w/ just grated cheddar cheese, and the other half w/ french-fried onions, just to see which texture/taste we liked better. (Cheese was the winner.) Enthusiastic 5 stars from my family, but one 6-year old dinner guest was less than happy w/ it, declaring that "mushrooms and onions are deeeesgusting." Her rating doesn't qualify haha.

little bit of time consuming, but very tasty, I added a 1/4 of cheese to the roux after the milk, I also used saltine crackers & butter for the topping. I did double the topping as we like the crunch.

I have made my tuna noodle casserole this way for years, except I only use Albacore tuna, and add 1/4 white wine (any kind!) when making the roux. Simple and delicious.

Bravo!!!! This was AMAZING. I have never tried a tuna casserole before. I remember the late eighties, early nineties when tuna casserole was a poor man's meal and dinner preparers would throw all the ingredients I a casserole dish, bake and the results were not appetizing at all. Honestly neither was this my DD, and DH was ready to count it out, until they tasted it, it was so good, everyone had more. I used can salmon because I didn't have tuna, I think the results would be the same. Everything else I left the same. Give this version a try, you won't be disappointed. That's for sharing.

Best casserole! I refuse to use nasty canned soups, but was craving this childhood favorite. This recipe fit the bill perfectly! I followed exactly except added a few spices from the pantry, just a few dashes. It was really good!

Kids, husband and I all loved it. I didn't love how time intensive it was and how many pots/pans I had to use; HOWEVER, I did love that it was less processed and more wholesome than the cream of whatever soup variety. So I guess that makes it worth the extra work. :)

Skipped the mushrooms because my husband doesn't like them and used French fried onions for the topping. Followed the rest of the recipe as written and it tasted great! Will definitely make again.

A friend who went fishing and caught a huge tuna, it became part of this delicious dish.

I used 1 cup of milk and 1 cup of broth.  This is the best tuna noodle casserole I've ever made.

I made this recipe the day after Thanksgiving - using turkey instead of tuna of course. Really easy and very tasty. I used one cup of heavy cream and a cup and a half of milk with plenty of butter (I wanted it creamy and rich). I used some poultry seasoning with the butter, garlic, onions, mushrooms, celery, and peas. I also put a bit of cheddar cheese in the bechamel sauce and instead, used buttered Panko crumbs on top.

This wasn't as much work as I thought it was going to be. I didn't think it was too dry as some people mentioned, but I agree it needed a few spices at the table. I added celery salt and dill, plus a few red pepper flakes. On its own, it's still pretty tasty though. You can definitely tell the difference without the canned ingredients, even if it doesn't knock your socks off.

I pretty much followed the recipe adding a few suggested spices. I made this for my neighbor who had just gotten out of the hospital and LOVES Tuna/Noodle Casserole!! I had never made one before and decided on this one because of the reviews. He loved it and so did his wife who really doesn't care for tuna. As for me - I don't care for tuna either - so if I ever make it again I'll probably just replace the tuna with chicken.  Thank you for the recipe!

I wanted to try a tuna noodle casserole without using canned soup.  This was awesome!!!!  I loved the freshness of the celery, onion, garlic and mushrooms.  I only used 1/2c cheese on top because that is all I had on hand, but I think it was perfect.  Thank you for sharing!!  Loved it!

Made this tonight and followed it to the letter. Absolutely fantastic! Was exactly what I was craving. I hate the recipes using canned soup and this was so much better! Even my picky-casserole-hating husband gave it compliments. Pinned and will make it again!

We really liked it but it was too much work.  I get very frustrated when these recipes say so much shorter time it takes to make it than it really does.  Maybe if you have someone do all the prep for you, but no way does this only take 30 min prep.

Again, great recipe in that it tasted good.  But it took me over an hour just to prepare it.

Making the cream of mushroom is the best part. I used saltines as the bread crumbs. I also put a 1/8 cup sour cream, 1/8 tsp thyme, 1/8 tsp paprika, and 1/8 tsp celery seed in it. Yum!

Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe with NO canned soups.  Made it for the second time tonight and we are just loving it.  To suit our tastes, I made the original sauce plus 1/2 more and it was divine.  Hubby asked that next time I add an additional small can tuna and we both think perhaps a cup of corn and some extra cheese would be good too so I will try those changes next time and because of the extra ingredients I will double the sauce.  But this is a great casserole as is,  just going to try a few variations and see what we think. Thank you again.

The idea of a casserole usually freaks me out but I once happened to try my friend's version with cream of mushroom soup and lots of thyme and kind of liked it. When I saw my lack of ingredients I figured today was the day to do it. I didn't have cream of mushroom but l didn't really like the idea of it all too much anyway.  I was so happy I found his recipe! With some tweaks it's a total keeper! I sautéed the rest of frozen stirfry mix instead w/o the water chestnuts plus a scallion and a huge clove of garlic. Put that aside then made the sauce with 3T butter and 4T flour, then substituted 1C knorr chicken broth with 1C evaporated milk. Once it thickened I took it off the heat and put 3/4 C low moisture grated mozzarella and a few leftover cubes of extra sharp cheddar. To the pot I added 2 drained 7oz cans of tuna, bottom of a bag of frozen peas, the stirfry, a heaping 1/2 tsp thyme, some marjoram, and s&p. oh, and the cooked pasta of course, I had less than two cups of pasta shells left over which I prefer to noodles after trying it this way. Topped with Italian bread crumb mixture and popped it in the oven (ovenproof pots RULE!) it was freaking STELLAR! I swear it almost tasted like freaking clam chowder I totally want to make this in individual bread bowls! Thanks so much for the recipe!

I am in shock!  My entire family loved this.  I have four kids, ages 9/11/13/15. One of them is a tuna lover and the others complain when she eats it because of the smell. They can't stand it. So I was reluctant to make a tuna dish, but I gave it a shot.  Well, I just took an EMPTY casserole dish off the table!!  They ate it all and wanted more.  I added a little extra milk to the sauce because I used a pound of mini farfalle pasta instead of egg noodles. I threw in some fresh chopped spinach as well to add more veggies.  And because I got confused with some other recipes I had been looking at, I accidently used a sleeve of Ritz crackers smashed up instead of bread crumbs and mixed it with melted butter and garlic salt.  The dish was not at all dry even though I used the extra pasta. Excellent! They won't groan  the next time I say I'm making tuna casserole!

It was soooooo good. A million times better than the versions with the canned soup. The little extra work is totally worth it. The hubby cleaned his plate 3 times.

Followed directions as given, but the end result was a dry mixture with very little taste. After reading several comments complaining of the dryness, I even added extra milk to compensate, but with no success. The picture looks nothing like what came out of my oven!

It's not often a new recipe has my entire family wowed but this one did just that.  I followed this recipe exactly as written except for using half the amount of butter called for and French onions instead of using bread crumbs - both because that's what I had on hand.  I have slightly picky kids so I did chop the veggies up fine.  My husband and kids absolutely loved this dish.  I've made the canned soup version before and it didn't fly, this version is great!  It's also easily customizable and you could add more veggies too.  My hubby even reported the left overs were even better the second day.  I'll will be adding this one into the rotation!  It's delicious!  Thanks for a great recipe!!!

Hubby loved it and says it is a "5"! It is very forgiving, since I did not have all the ingredients, and had to convert it to gluten free. I used gluten free penne noodles, omitted the celery (didn't have any) and used loosely chopped mushrooms. For the roux, I used 1/4 cup potato flour and 2% milk and butter. For the topping I used crushed GF cheese crackers, omitting the butter and cheese.  Everything else was added as written. It went into the frig, until I pulled it out 48 hours later... I poured 1/2 cup 2% milk around the edges/middle of the casserole as it had dried out in the frig over the last two days. It baked perfectly in 45 minutes to the cheer of the family gathered at the table. Thank you for sharing this recipe! I look forward to adding it to my regular rotation.

This was a good dish, but I added to it which is why I am giving it 3 stars. I used broccoli instead of peas and added, nutmeg and crushed red pepper. I did not butter the dish, I used cooking spray to cut calories. I also only used 1/4 cup of butter to make the sauce and it turned out great and cut the butter calories and fat in half. I also used skim milk.

I loved the idea of making this dish from scratch. It turned out amazing! I'm rating it a 4, however, mainly because I changed a few things because I thought the regular recipe looked a bit...bland. I mainly just added some dill, nutmeg, one chicken bullion cube, and crushed chili pepper flakes to the sauce. I also used butter-flavored crackers instead of bread crumbs to give it a little more flavor and bite. It turned out great. Next time I'll have to use a bit more cheese. I just eyeballed it, and it turned out a bit crunchy as opposed to cheesy. I might add some cheese to the sauce as well. Thank you for this recipe! I will make this again.

This was great as written, but the second time I made it I had to make a few changes. I wanted fewer pans and less prep. So I sprayed the baking dish with nonstick spray. Then I grabbed my dutch oven and sauted the onions etc. in 2 tsp. butter. I used a jar of sliced mushrooms and diced them up in an attempt to fool the kids and only cooked them long enough to heat through since they're already soft. I just added the roux butter to the onion mixture in the same pot and used 1 cup chicken broth in lieu of one of the cups of milk. Voila! One less pan, a little less fat. I forgot to buy fresh celery so used 1/4 tsp. celery seed, 1/2 tsp. marjoram, 1/8 tsp. cayenne pepper and 1/8 tsp. nutmeg.  I also didn't remember to thaw the peas in advance, so I dumped them into the colander along with 12 oz. of cooked noodles because I would never use the remaining 4 oz in the bag.  I had some buttermilk (just under 1/4 cup) from a previous recipe and added this plus an extra dallop of regular milk since the first time I made this it was a little dry, but 1/4-1/2 cup of any milk/cream would go a long way. I also added sharp cheddar into the mix because I don't like "cheese crusts" on top. Finally, I wanted a little extra crunch on top so I just smashed up a sandwich baggie of plain kettle chips and added these on top, covering with foil for all but the last 5 mins. I honestly thought my lazier method wouldn't produce nearly as good of results as the original, but we actually liked it better.

I had never had tuna casserole, had seen it so many times on movies as a joke that I did not take it seriously.  But I am very happy that I gave this a go.  I made it as stated though I minced the mushrooms because I have a 3 year old, and I used fried onions as topping as someone else suggested.  I also mixed some of the cheddar into the pasta mix, as a cup is a lot just for topping.  It was wonderful, even with whole wheat pasta which usually is not that appetizing.  Great recipe!

This is divine comfort food!  Based on other reviews I tweaked it ever so slightly: used PAM rather than butter to grease the pan, added about an ounce of cream cheese to the sauce and added about 1/2 cup cheddar cheese to the sauce.  I also made about 50% more, just eyeballing the ingredients until it looked about right.  This completely filled an 11 x 13 pan and 4 people totally devoured this, leaving *no* leftovers for today!  Yeah probably a bit off the charts for fat and calories, etc., so this will not be a weekly meal, but I will definitely be making this again.

This is basically the same recipe I've been using for the last 50 years.  I HATE creamed soup in the majority of recipes and tuna, in my opinion, is not an ingredient which can fight the chicken or mushroom soup taste and win out! A good cream sauce is neutral enough that it lets the tuna flavor shine.  I also leave out the veggies and serve them on the side.  Spraying the pan with cooking spray is ok, but butter tastes better and for this it works just as well to prevent sticking.  Also, one should let the flour/butter mixture simmer for a few seconds stirring constantly, before adding milk, to get rid of the raw flour taste.  I add the cheese to the cream sauce and stir until it melts, stir in the tuna and then pour everything over the cooked noodles and stir.  Then put in the prepared baking dish and put into the oven until it bubbles.

I am glad this recipe did not use canned soup, dry soup mix, or bottled sauce. Seems most of these recipes caters to people trying to save time but it does not take much longer to do it from scratch than to resort to canned soup. You also control the salt when you cook from scratch and you don't ingest unpronounceable ingredients.

The only changes I made was to omit the mushrooms (hate them), more garlic, and used frozen mixed vegetables instead of just peas. Pearl onions would also work in this recipe.

I was tired of the same old tuna noodle casserole.  I made this recipe - exactly as written - and I think it has a much superior taste.  Loved the fact that it uses a roux instead of the canned soup!  I liked the addition of the mushrooms, too (our family loves 'shrooms).  Very good recipe!  A definite keeper

This is a delicious recipe.  Remember when making a roue, must have equal parts of butter and flour.  I added a little chicken boullion to the sauce, just a tad. I used thyme and a little nutmeg.  I also did not cook the garlic with the onions, as garlic becomes very bitter is over sauteed.  I added it after the mushrooms and only sauteed the garlic for two minutes as it would cook more while baking.  Can't stand bitter garlic!  And, my Tuna Casserole always has potato chips in it.  I know, I know, lots of calories, etc. but that is my signature add-in for my casserole and my kids love, love, love it and one of my sons asked for it every birthday (much to his wife's chagrin!) My daughter wants it when she comes home and my youngest son just loves it!  Try the potato chips!  Do not add more butter to the chips and maybe not even bake it! I also did not skimp on the cheddar and even my husband, who hates tuna casserole, loved it! Yum!

This is a great base recipe with a few added seasonings. I also use french fried onions on top mixed with cheese. Finally a tip a chef shared with me: When cooking pasta for a casserole like this, cook the pasta a bit past the aldente stage. That way the noodles don't absorb so much of the sauce and it won't be dry.

I can't believe I've waited so long to review this! I ditched the old condensed soup recipe years ago! This is now one of my all time favorite comfort food recipes. I do take some liberties with adding more vegetables, mixing some of the cheese inside and putting some on top as well as using gluten free brown rice pasta. Play around with it and make it your own. It's a fantastic base to build on.

Really good!!  The family loved it!!  After I read the reviews that some said it was lacking flavor I decided to  add chicken broth along with the milk, old bay seasoning and extra garlic!  Very versatile and can be switched up!

This recipe is pretty awesome! I also made a couple of minor adjustments...I sprayed the dish with non-stick spray & ditched the butter. I used 2.5 - 3 Tbs of butter to saute the veggies in & it was plenty. Also I ditched the butter bread crumbs & just covered the bread crumbs with sharp cheddar cheese. The oil from the cheese had the same effect as butter would've had. Excellent I will make this again!

This was great!  My boys, 8 and 6 didn't complain during dinner, which is success in our house.  I did have to make a few changes since I didn't have any mushrooms.  I increased the celery and added half a grated carrot, as well as a little chicken soup base while sauteing the veggies.  Will certainly make again with mushrooms next time.

My guests and I liked this a lot. Traditional comfort food without the canned soup! I doubled the recipe (easily fed 12) and probably added a few too many noodles, so I added more milk. I will also make it creamier next time but won't change anything else.

Definitely try this. It was pretty good. I only gave it 4 stars because I didnt think there was anything extraordinarily special about it. I did like that I didnt have to make an extra trip to the store to get canned mushroom soup or what not. And I made the roux in the same pan after browning the onion, celery and mushrooms. Just saves you from washing an extra pan. And I went ahead and added some cream cheese as someone else suggested. I think it added a pleasant extra cheesy flavor. I didnt add the crunch topping because I just forgot about it. If that was what would have made it extra special than it was my fault. But its just crumbs and butter. You be the judge.

I increased the quantity of noodles by 50%, so my first step was to change the recipe to make 9 servings; from there, I made a few changes to the (increased) quantities, mostly to make things healthier. My changes took the calorie total down by about 40%! I used just 1/3 the original amount of cheese and milk (1/2 cup cheese instead of 1 1/2 cups, and 1 cup milk instead of 3 cups, but added 2 cups chicken stock to regain the liquid). I cut the butter down even more, using a total of 1/4 cup butter instead of 3/4 cups and 3 tablespoons. I cut the flour from 1/4 cup and 2 tablespoons down to 1/4 cup, and bread crumbs from 1/4 cup and 1 teaspoon also down to 1/4 cup. I used a little more of some veggies (a whole onion instead of 3/4, 2 stalks celery instead of 1 1/2 stalks, 1 tablespoon garlic paste instead of 1 1/2 cloves) and a little less of others (1/2 lb of mushrooms instead of 3/4 lb, 1 cup of peas instead of 1 1/2 cups). For seasoning, I used a total of 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper, and added 1/8 teaspoon thyme. It turned out pretty good but could probably use a little more in the way of herbs and seasoning just to make it a bit more flavorful. I'm the only one in the house who likes tuna casserole of any kind, but this stored well so I'll definitely make it again for my own lunches.

This recipe was really good! It definitely had more flavor than a few other tuna casseroles I've made on this site.  Like some of the other reviewers I added chicken boullion to the flour/milk mixture, I added a bit more garlic and I used a cup of frozen mixed veggies since we aren't the biggest fan of peas.  I used italian seasoned panko bread crumbs and the end result was fantastic.  My hubby went back for seconds and I brought the leftovers for lunch!

We enjoyed this recipe very much! But it was super delicious. Small changes, were: Didn't add peas, added chopped garlic, onion, celery, black olives sliced, half a large tomato chopped. Topped with canned crispy onions and crushed crackers drizzled with a little butter. Forgot to add the cheese, but that would make it even better. My picky husband said "that's really tasty"...

This was delicious! I was so glad to see a casserole recipe that wasn't entirely out of a can. No high fructose blah blah or other science experiments, this was all fresh ingredients! I made a few changes. I substituted broccoli for mushrooms (cuz the husband won't touch them), doubled the garlic, and when cooking the sauce, added 1tsp nutmeg, thyme, and red pepper flakes. Everything else I followed according to the recipe. Next time, I may throw in some of the cheese into the sauce as well as on top.

To keep the fat content down, I used rotini instead of egg noodles, made the sauce with fat free milk (doubled the recipe), added more onion and garlic, and no cheese or bread crumbs in the top. Came out moist and tasty.

This was a good base recipe. Very creamy and rich. However, I didn't give it 5 stars because there wasn't much flavor besides the tuna, cheese and peas. I would prefer a pinch more salt, pepper and some garlic or onion. I will adjust to my liking next time. But again, very good base recipe. Will definitely use again!

Love it! Actually, the breadcrumb/butter mixture is the best part. I will double that next time. Also, I used a little more cheddar - white and extra sharp! - and mixed half of it in with the cream sauce.

This recipe has become my go-to for casseroles. UNLIKE a lot of the reviews, I go for full fat, unprocessed, eat it how God made it ingredients. Sometimes I don't cook this as long as I should because it's so hot already going into the oven. Both our children love it, and they usually hate tuna.

***Let me preface by saying that tuna noodle casserole (made with or without canned soup) was never something my mom made us growing up, so I didn't really have a bench mark to compare this too.***

Delicious!  Added in 2 small carrots peeled and finely chopped with the celery and onion, and added in 4 oz of cream cheese to the cream sauce (because I needed to use it up before it went bad).  Came out wonderfully and creamy, without an overpowering canned tuna taste.  Oh, I used 1 can flaked albacore, and 1 can chunk light, 5 oz each (what I had on hand).  Will be making again!

I think this is very good! Creamy, and best of all, NO ICKY CANNED SOUP that is so bad for you. I left out the mushrooms because I don't like them. I didn't use celery or onion because of picky kids who wont eat those. I did, however, add onion powder in it's place. It needs a lot of salt and pepper, next time I'll add more.

I just tried this recipe with some of the changes others suggested. I used oil for the vegetable mix and added a little white wine and some tomatoes to it. I also added some grated parmesan to the milk. It is delicious!

This recipe is 5 stars just for the absence of canned soup. We definatly love it, it's really very good tasting. Perfect for customizing to family preference so I won't list my changes, but I will say that I have topped it with everything from bread crumbs to crackers to nothing at all and whenever I use crushed sociables crackers my family goes nuts.

This was an average tasting casserole that took a lot of time and preparation.  If you are looking for something that fits a more bland diet, this would be perfect- but I would prefer something easier to make, with far more flavor.

Not mind-blowing, but very good .  I added a bit of nutmeg and thyme to the roux, and I put about half a cup of additional cheddar in the white sauce before mixing it with all the other stuff.  I think it probably would've been a bit bland without those additions.  Good recipe, though - I think every other recipe on the site uses canned soup...

This was delicious! I was delighted to find such a good recipe for tuna noodle casserole that did not use canned soup. I did use the suggestions that were made by cookinggardener and as a personal preference I left out the mushrooms. Will definitely be making again!

This was a last minute dinner idea. I had all the ingredients and whipped it up. It was really great!
I do not like cream soups so this really fit the bill.
I will definitely make this again. THanks!

I didn't have mushrooms so I didn't add them, but next time will try them. I also didn't have celery, but I think I would keep that out. Added 1/2 cheddar to the white sauce. It was great!

LOVE that hat this did not call for canned soup (can't stand that stuff).  Didn't love washing all of the pots and pans.  I added parm and cheddar cheese to the white sauce, ommitted the peas.  This was a great economical meal!

Yum!  Even my tune-hating-kids ate it!  I did dice the mushrooms up tiny so they could fly under the kid radar and it worked.  Also had to add extra garlic to spruce it up and a dash of seasoning salt.  So with adding those changes it would be a 5 star!  Was nice to not have to pull out a can of soup!  Good flavor!  Will make again.

This is one of the best tuna casserole's I've ever ate.  I added a dash of cayenne pepper to the milk and flour mixture for an extra kick, and I  used garlic and herb breadcrumbs mixed with some panko breadcrumbs. Turned out fantastic!  Will be making again and keeping recipe for future times. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Obviously we are in the minority here, but we did not like this recipe at all.  My husband and I each had a helping for dinner and we threw the rest of it in the garbage.  Very dry and very bland.  Sorry.

Like everyone has said, this is an awesome recipe, I don't have any changes that haven't already been suggested.  But, I do highly recommend sprinkling French's fried onions on top.  Not terribly healthy, but sooooo yummy!

Great recipe and super easy. Subbed 1/2 of a small bag of cauliflower (steamed in microwave til al dente) and carrot for the peas to use what I had in house. Casserole was evenly cooked and did not have too much liquid which for a casserole is what I like.

Recipe was good, but I have had better.  I like a much saucier casserole.

My husband loved this.  It tastes similar to the processed versions but without a boxed mix or can of soup.  I thought it was a little time consuming (lots of dirty pans).  The next time I will modify some of the ingredients to make it lower fat.

I totally agree with another reviewer.  Baking this dish totally dries it out.  It looked amazing before I put it in the oven.  It was so dry, I had to mix in some milk and an entire can of mushroom soup just to eat it. It also seemed bland it was just lacking something.

We are not big fish fans but occationally I can get my family to eat tuna casserole. They LOVED this! It is far better and a lot healthier than the kind with the soup in it. I dont use processed foods and was so happy to find a recipe that uses whole foods. I didnt have to adjust a thing. I did use some slices of swiss on top and mixed in some mozzerella but only because I didn't have enough cheddar. Awesome recipe! My husband even ate leftovers!

I also appreciated that this recipe was not one of the many that relies on the canned soup, but for some reason I felt that there was not enough sauce for my casserole.  It seemed a little on the dry side, although I used the exact amount of tuna, noodles and veggies (subbed zucchini for the mushrooms).  I don't know if I did something wrong, but next time I will definitely increase the sauce ingredients.    Also, I wasn't sure what to use as a "medium" baking dish.  An 8"x8" seemed to be a little too small, but I doubt if there is enough filling for a 9"x13".  In the end I filled an 8"x8" and had enough leftover for a gratin dish, which I froze for another time.    It's a very flexible recipe though, and I will use it again.

Excellent recipe. I did have to make a couple of changes: I didn't have mushrooms so I diced up carrot and added it with the celery and onions. Also, to make it saucier I added 6 oz noodles instead of 8 oz (weighed them on my kitchen scale). Instead of the breadcrumbs I just used the end of a bag of chips and tossed them on top of the cheese! Next time I'll add more seasoning - maybe 1/2 tsp onion powder and 1/2 tsp garlic powder. It's great to make this recipe without using the high-sodium soup!

This is a very good recipe.  I am so happy to find one that doesn't need condensed soup as it's base.  I find this much more tasty and much healthier too.

This dish was DELICIOUS! I WILL make it again! I made some alterations though, I didn't add peas, but I did add green peppers and broccoli to the celery/onion/garlic sauté, and it was so good, adding more flavor and vegis! I added tons more garlic and added a generous amount of dill. I disregarded the bread crumbs and butter that were supposed to go on top because it was one more step that I was willing to take. With a 14 month old underfoot, shortcuts are my best friend and cutting out things that aren't needed. I also sprayed the pan with non-sticking spray, buttering by hand seemed silly.   I loved it, my husband did as well, he is a really picky eater and not a huge fan of casseroles or tuna, so I was surprised, my little one couldn't get enough of it and kept wanting more, I think this is a new family favorite! Just fyi, if you have your pasta in bigger quantity than 8 ounces, 5 cups of dry pasta is how much you need:)!

I think this is a great, simple tuna casserole that easily stands in for and exceeds the Tuna Helper of my childhood! I took one reviewers suggestions and added 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and 1/2 tsp of thyme leaves the second time around and the flavour was much improved.  I found the recipe as-is a bit lacking in flavour (as far as our palette preferences go).  The second time around I also used low-fat cheddar, margarine, and lactose-free, 1% milk to accommodate our various health issues/consciousnesses and it still turned out great.  The bread crumb topping was difficult to work with but tasted great....my husband and I loved it.

I loved the idea of the casserole from scratch but the sauce was thin and rather flavorless. It was edible. We added garlic powder, fresh ground pepper, and sea salt to the finish product but it was dry. I will keep the recipe but fool with it a bit to try and make it better since tuna casserole is one of my hubby's favorites.

I hadn't had tuna casserole since I was a kid, and I remember loving it.  I looked through a bunch of reviews, and made some changes which I thought would be good, but this one only turned out so-so.  I think the concept of "upscale" tuna casserole is great, and I may play around with it.  I couldn't really bring myself to make a "real" version with all that cream and canned soup, but this one is okay.  I probably wouldn't serve it to company until I worked with it a little more.

Delicious, and SO nice to not be based on a canned soup!  (Can't get them in Europe where I live now, anyhow...)  Easy roux, and like someone suggested, I added some cheddar to the roux to make a cheesy sauce, as well as the cheese on top.  The suggestion of potato chips or cornflakes on top was great as well, added a ton of crunch.  Great cheapie meal idea-- will definitely make it into the rotation.

I am a big fan of tuna noodle casserole and this one is awesome! I used soy milk instead of milk because I'm lactose intolerant and it turned out great! This recipe is definitely being made again at my house.

This was good, I followed the recipe but i also added a can of cream of mushroom soup and a half of cup of more milk. You couldnt tell it was in there just gave it more sauce so it wouldnt be dry. I didnt used mushrooms, didnt have any. I put crushed can fried onions on top . That was really good. Used more cheese, and put some on top and then the frenches fried onions for the last 10 min. Also put some green pepper in, paprika, ground mustard. It was good , wasnt bland at all.

Definitely tastes better & richer than the Campbell's versions.  I used whole wheat noodles which added a little extra flavor to the combination.  Next time I think I'll omit the cheese, just doesn't seem all that necessary.

SOOO much better than the old version with canned soup.  I decided to take the advice of others and used 1 c. milk and 1 c. chicken stock.  I think it added another depth of flavor.  Some suggested using a chicken bouillon, but that would add a lot of salt.  I sprinkled in some dry dill weed and plenty of chopped fresh parsley.  After sauteing the mushrooms, & added the flour & made the roux in the same pan.  No need to dirty extra dishes.  When I put everything together, I could tell that it would have turned out too dry if I baked it (others had complained about this), so I decided to skip the bread crumb topping & baking.  Next time I will make 1 and a half times the sauce & bake in the oven.  With a few changes, it's a wonderful comfort food recipe that I don't feel quite as guilty about eating!

pretty good tuna casserole, but definately add some herbs to the roux. i added a little bit of thyme, dill, marjoram, and plenty of parsley. also added chicken boullion as per another member's suggestion. added carrots and cut down the butter a little bit; i didn't miss it because the seasonings gave the casserole such a good flavor on their own.

OMG!  Thank you so much for writing this recipe down!  I make it this way all the time, except I use swiss cheese instead of cheddar (just personal preference - cheddar is good too).   I also use lactose free dairy ingredients because my daughter is lactose-intolerant and it comes out great!

I doubled the recipe for lunches the next day and made a couple of changes as well. Instead of sauteeing the vegs., I chopped them fine and added for the fresh crunch taste. I mixed along with the sauce one can of Cream of Mushroom Soup along with sliced mushrooms and milk. I also added one pkg. of Lipton Onion Soup mix for the seasoning and topped with crushed croutons and Doritos for the cheesy taste. It was absolutely Fantastic!!

This was yummy. Made the following minor changes: threw in some diced red bell pepper, sauteed the vegetables in bacon fat instead of butter for a little extra flavor, and used half milk / half cream. Yes, I actually made this recipe fattier than it already was!

This was delicious...even my husband thought so and he's not a big fan of tuna. I used half the butter the recipe called for and it still was very creamy. I didn't have any cheese so I topped it with crushed potato chips which finished it with a nice crunch. I would make this again.

I'll be making this one again. I read many of the reviews and made a few changes based on feedback (many suggestions made by KPZ111). I doubled the recipe and used a 9x13 baking dish (sprayed w/ Pam instead of greasing w/ butter). Instead of 4 c milk (which the dbled recipe would call for) I used 2 c milk, 1 container sour cream and 1/2 package of cream cheese (next time I would use 3 c milk and 1 container sour cream). I also added 1 t. thyme, 1/2 t. nutmeg, 1 t. crushed red, 1/2 t. salt, 1/2 t. pepper, 1/4 c. grated parm and 1/2 the cheddar cheese into the sauce (I'd use a bit less nutmeg next time). I didn't have celery, but next time I'd add it for sure. And I used 1 small can sliced mushrooms because that's all I had (hubby's not a 'shroom lover, so it was all I could get away with). Added a splash wine to the mushroom mixture. I used frozen carrots and peas instead of just peas. Also used a mix of bowtie and campanelle pasta because I had a half box of each. Used 3 cans tuna (2 chunk light and 1 solid white). All else as stated in recipe (but dbled). As I said my husband doesn't like mushrooms and he's not crazy about tuna fish, and he had thirds!

This is the ONLY recipe that I will use for Tuna Noodle Casserole.  Most of the time I'll use fresh mushrooms and we prefer crushed potato chips on top vs. the bread crumbs.  That's just personal preference.  The flavors are terric and it is not time consuming to make a white sauce.

Glad to find a recipe for tuna casserole that used a roux instead of mushroom soup.  Great as leftovers too!

I was searching for a recipe that didn't remind my DH of tuna helper, which he abhors. I followed the recipe, changing just a couple things from other review suggestions. Omitted peas & mushrooms due to DH & kids taste preferences, although I think mushrooms would have added a really nice flavor. Used an oil spray to saute veggies and 1 Tbs less butter for sauce to help fat content. Added some chicken bullion powder to sauce along with a 1/4 cup cheese to melt in. It was a little bland - def needed more salt - but I'm not experienced enough to know what it was missing. I didn't have some of the other suggested spices, although they might have helped. It was also a little dry. It's the first tuna casserole I made, but DH & kids requested to not have it again. I didn't think it was that bad.

I've made quite a few adjustments to this recipe and my family keeps requesting this, so I guess they're working.  I've tripled the amount of mushrooms and omitted the peas.  Next,I used only one cup of skim milk to the roux then I've added half of the cheese to the roux, right before I add the tuna and mushroom mixture.  I added in a cup of sour cream instead of the second cup milk. Finally, I've used townhouse crackers for the topping because they are buttery, allowing me to cut down the butter in the topping.  I used extra-sharp cheddar for the cheese.  The casserole comes out creamy, but not heavy, chunky with mushrooms, and savory with the sour cream.  This is a winner in my book!

This came out really great.  Took the advice of the other reviewrs and doubled the sauce, but I should've added a third can of tuna.  Will do that next time. Also added 1 tsp each ground mustard and paprika to the white sauce.  I omitted the peas (I like them on the side.)  And I used crushed up Goldfish crackers in place of the breadcrumbs on top.  The leftovers were even better.

Very good and really very easy. Thanks MVANWINKLE. The things I did differently than the recipe is that I used farfalle pasta (had it) and substituted crushed french fried onions for the bread crumbs. Since some of the early reviews complained about dryness, I also added 1/4 cup of white wine to the mushrooms when they were cooking. I really think this might be just as good with chicken as it is with tuna.

Update: I've made this again, using Thanksgiving turkey leftovers. It's just as good. Turkey, Chicken, or Tuna ... doesn't matter. In order to maintain the desired thickness, use no bigger than a 9" X 13" baking dish.

I give it a four star because it has potential to be a great recipe, but this meal really needed some extra seasoning.  I'll try thyme and some emeril essense next time to the sauce.   I may even try and extra can of tuna!

An excellent tuna noodle casserole; my husband was overcome with his first forkful - very delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly and found that the prep time is much longer than 30 minute, but I don't care.  It is a perfect recipe with layers of flavor and a delightful aroma that fills the kitchen when the casserole is removed from the oven.  My husband and I will enjoy it for years to come with family and friends.

Really good. Mine wasn't dry at all, but I might have added less noodles. I used pasta instead of egg noodles (bowties) and added until I thought there was enough for the sauce. I added 1c cheese to the mixture, and then sprinkled more on top with the bread crumbs. I also added asperagus because I had some to use up and took out the mushrooms and celery. Kids and hubby loved it too.

Very lacking in flavor, which was very disappointing. The white sauce with little spices did nothing for me and my family. It also gave me terrible gas! Overall, this recipe needs some work!

There's nothing particularly wrong with this recipe, but it was just really bland for our tastes and I even doubled the garlic and used lots of black pepper. Thanks :)

I looked at the calories in this (A LOT!) and tried to cut it down a bit, and also used other's suggestions. So, sauteed onion (the whole thing), garlic (2 cloves), and celery (3 stalks) in olive oil, not butter. Also greased the casserole dish with olive oil instead of butter. Then used half the amount of butter in with the flour, used skim milk, and added spices (half tsp each of thyme, paprika, nutmeg, and parsley). I didn't use breadcrumbs (not necessary) and topped with sliced fresh mozerella (didn't have cheddar, it's healthier anyway). I'm giving it 5 stars since my husband LOVED it, I thought it needed more flavor. Next time I'll add a bullion cube also.

This came out awesome, and was the perfect hearty meal for helping me fight off my cold. For the veggies I used onion, red pepper and peas (they were what I had on hand)and cooked them in the full amount of butter. I took another reviewers suggestion of adding 1/4 cup dry white wine while they sauteed, as well as a few red pepper flakes. I sprinkled the flour on top and mixed it in, and then added the milk and brought the cream sauce to a boil. I reduced the temperature and added a little of the cheddar and 1/4 cup grated parmesan to the sauce. I also tossed in fresh parsley with the tuna and noodles. This was a great recipe and I look forward to trying it with different veggies. My best suggestion would be to cut down on the dishes and make the cream sauce in the same pan as the sauteed vegetables.

Considering neither my husband nor I care much for fish in general we both ate this and thought it was pretty good. My husband even gave it 4 stars. My son had two generous helpings. They both agreed this was much better than our usual tuna mac recipe (boxed mac & ch, can tuna, can soup). I used crushed croutons for the bread crumbs, a small handful of dried minced onion instead of fresh, and added 5 slices american cheese to the white sauce as I made it. This was good, even we liked it, thanks!

I made this for dinner tonight and found this to be a bit bland..my husband thought so as well. But we added some hot sauce and that seemed to help a bunch. I do think this recipe is a great base. I will be making this again..with some minor adjustments! Thank you for this recipe.

This recipe is definitely a keeper!  I try to use as many fresh ingredients as possible in my cooking and as few processed foods as I can.  I was intrigued that this recipe did not use canned soup.....and it was not missed!  The extra time it took to make the sauce was minimal and the flavor payoff was huge.  My only real adjustment was adding the cheese into the casserole and not on top.  I used baby crimini mushrooms and a bit extra of the veggies.  My husband loved this and said we can have this again anytime - and since it is Lent, we may have it again very soon!

Surprisingly, my normally dinner-avoiding little girl was all about this!  I made a few minor adjustments:  Less butter overall, omitting the 'shrooms, frozen mixed veggies instead of just peas, skipped the breadcrumbs, Barilla Plus Rotini noodles, and less reduced fat cheese.  Dirtied a LOT of dishes, but getting the child to actually eat made it all worth it.

This is a great recipe, however it does need just a little tweaking. I took another reviewer's advice and used dill in the cream sauce. I took a pinch and rolled it between my fingers then cooked it in the sauce. After mixing all of the ingredients together and placing it in the casserole dish, I sprinkled Paprika over the top and then did the bread crumbs. I used mozerella cheese instead of cheddar. I will make this recipe again and take a different reviewer's advice and make more cream sauce. The casserole did come out wonderful, however dried out within minutes of being served. The great thing about this recipe is that it doesn't contain cream of mushroom or cream of celery soup! Also can be tailored to any meat (fish, chicken, beef) and seasoned to taste! Thank you for a great recipe!

I took cookinggardener's advice and cut down on the butter for the roux and saute.  I also used skim milk in place of whole and added a quarter cup of low fat sour cream to the sauce. I topped mine with half a cup of extra sharp cheese with a few tablespoons of aged asiago instead of the whole cup of cheese and bread crumb mixture.  I think that I'll add an extra can of tuna next time, though.  Not quite tuna-y enough for me.  You really have to season this up (Mrs. Dash, salt, pepper, pinch of red pepper and thyme).    It's so great to find a recipe that doesn't use canned soup.  Yummy!

I give this 5 stars!!  I added cayenne pepper and lots of black pepper (because I'm addicted), don't need to change a thing, but I will, eventually... I'm like that.  I'm thinking a bit of ground sage, and double the garlic.  (just a tweak.)  Thanks for sharing.

I really liked this, and will never make it with canned soup again.  After reading other suggestions, I added 1/4 c cream cheese to the sauce and a chicken buillion cube to the milk.  I left out the celery (hubby doesn't like it), used 1/2 lb. elbow macaroni, and left out the bread crumb & cheddar topping, as cheddar cheese on tuna casserole didn't sound appealing.  Instead I sprinkled a little parmesan on top.  Very tasty, but since I made so many changes I only gave it a four.

Mmmmm...comfort food.  Make sure you season the vegetables as you cook them and season that white sauce well or it would be bland.  Salt and pepper are fine - just taste as you go.  I added a few shakes of cayenne pepper to the white sauce as well.   To make it even faster, you could top it with a layer of crunched up potato chips.  Just like Mom used to make!

Overall, I thought this would turnout better.  It had good flavor (although it was a little dry - I'd double the sauce if I ever decided to make it again).  The leftovers took on a noticeable fishy taste.

I try to make my own COM soup whenever I get the chance so this was a great recipe for me. A little more effort will yield great results! You cannot even begin to compare the fresh stuff to the canned! i didnt use the entire 1/2 c. of butter as called. I sauteed the mushrooms in EVOO and then later used about 4 TB butter to make the roux to thicken the sauce. 
I spooned half the final mixture into the casserole dish, layer a couple slices of Kraft american slices on top, and then spread the rest of the casserole on top. It was amazing! Oh, and for a great crunch and flavor, use crushed FRITOS instead of potato chips (they get gummy when you refrigerate the leftovers)

Very tasty.  I use a bit of Lawry's seasoning salt in the butter and flour.  Thank you!  I had a craving today for my mom's tuna noodle casserole.  She passed away this summer and never wrote down all her recipes.  This tastes exactly like she used to make it.  Thanks so much!  Comfort food at its best.  The flavor is great

Delicious!  I did a few things differently ~ I used oil to saute the onions, tuna and mushrooms together, adding a good amount of salt.  Then I mixed the milk and flour mixture in with the tuna, onion, mushroom mix and added the peas and cheese and simmered for a few minutes.  Then I mixed the noodles (I used spiral noodles instead of egg noodles) and put it in the baking dish and baked for about 30 min.  I did not use breadcrumbs.
It was wonderful ~ frying the tuna with the onion gives it a great taste :)

This was good, but labor intensive. Didn't really taste better than my usual recipe for tuna casserole (using good-quality organic canned cream of mushroom). Maybe I should have doctored the sauce as the other reviewers did.

Really good. I did omit the peas and celery. I just don't like them. I also added a dash of cheyanne pepper with the salt and pepper. Lastly I wanted some cheddar in the sauce so I put half of the cheese in after the noodles then toppped it with the remaining cheese. It was a hit. I will never use Tuna Helper again.

I aggree - way better than with soup, and with less sodium.  I think the sauce needs a little more milk so leftovers (if there are any!) won't be dry on day two.

I had never made a tuna casserole before and was very hesitant to make it.  I have tick buttery casseroles!  I made it for my family that was in town and everyone absolutely loved it! There was 4 of us and more than 3 quarters of it was eaten.  The next day for lunch every one wanted left over’s and we are not a left over family! Great dish that I recommend to anyone!

This got 2 thumbs up from the picky dh. I sprinkled a an italian blend of cheese, and little cayenne pepper and paprika on top. Added about 1/4 c. shredded sharp cheddar cheese to the sauce for a little extra kick. Great recipe! Worth the time to make this one over the canned soup recipes.

I agree with the others that it definitely needed a little something more than called for.  I added crushed red pepper, thyme, nutmeg, 4 garlic cloves and some garlic powder (we love garlic here!).  I forgot to add some cooking wine to the veggies but will do that next time.  Even my toddler who won't eat anything green ate it with the peas and all!

This was so good!  I did make a few changes due to personal taste.  As far as it being bland or dry, just taste as you go along and all will be fine.  I added thyme, more garlic, 2 T cooking sherry, and S&P throught out to all steps.  Just yummy!  I also made it in two casserole dishes and froze half for later.  It turned out just as good, if not better, and I had already done all the work!  Just a yummy dinner!

I was disappointed.  I was so excited to try this tonight but this recipe came up short.  It was pretty dry and lacking in flavor.  I followed the directions exactly except that I cut back on the butter a bit for health.  It needs something else (besides butter), and my mom's was always very creamy.  I guess I'll get her recipe!  I doubt I will make this again.

One clove is too much garlic... and I live in the Garlic Capital of the World!

It's a lot easier to cook the noodles in the pyrex container rather than separately beforehand. And instead of mincing/chopping/whisking everything, I dumped the mixture into the blender and set it on "Chop" for a couple seconds and it turned out great.

Ruby's Mommy is right. Substitute bread crumbs for French Fried Onions.

Delicious!

Delious and not too complicated to do without canned soup. I used canned mushrooms and they worked the same. I would make a thinner white sauce to accompany tuna, etc. A REAL comfort food. Thanks Bernie

I was in a rush to get dinner made so I made this without reading reviews first.  That meant that for us, this was pretty bland, although we did enjoy it anyway.  I probably didn't use enough salt and pepper.  Next time I will add about 1 tsp of each of those, along with thyme, nutmeg, and red pepper as suggested by others.  I will probably also put in an extra clove of garlic.  I used less butter than called for by spraying the pan with cooking spray and only using 1 Tbsp of butter in the topping, which I thought was very good.  I will use less butter in the sauce next time.  I'm thrilled to have found a recipe that doesn't used canned soup.  Thanks for submitting it!

Great recipe , the only one I make because it is truly from scratch , no canned soups !
I add olives   and cream cheese on occasion and lots of onion ,garlic and crumb topping.
I don't use butter(olive oil instead) , peas or mushrooms (carrots instead).
Always great ,I have doubled the tuna for more protein.

Very good recipe.  This was the first time I made tuna casserole from scratch.  I have to say it was very good.  Was a bit nervous about flavor but it was great!  I added frozen peas and carrots with 1/4 tsp nutmeg (as suggested).  I also added a bit more garlic (we love garlic).  Plus put in an extra can of tuna, seems it might have been a bit to much so maybe 1 1/2 cans of tuna next time.  It did come out a bit dry so next time I will double the sauce as we like our tuna casserole creamy.  But very good.  I basically went by the directions with those simple add on's.  I will be adding this to my recipe binder and will be on our menu often.  Who new recipes BEFORE condensed soups, lol.

Very good - the only tuna casserole I will make from now on!

I made as stated except the following: I added 1 tsp salt and pepper, used crushed ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs and mixed half the cheese into the noodles and the other half sprinkled on top.  Very good!

pretty good for a cold night - to make it healthier, I sprayed the pan with cooking spray, sauted the veggies in cooking spray as well.  Added part of a red pepper that I had lying around, added an extra can of tuna, and added spices (thyme, ground red pepper, nutmeg) to the white sauce.  Great for a night where I forgot to thaw the chicken I had planned to make!  Next time I will plan smarter so that I don't have so many pots and pans to wash.

I've made this several times and it never disappoints.  I use whole wheat club cracker crumbs instead of bread crumbs and add a bit more celery and garlic.
Very yummy! Thanks for sharing.

Excellent dish, especially on a chilly night.  I followed recipe with only minor variation, using small shell pasta, chopped mushrooms finely so that my kids didn't find them, used corn flakes for the topping.  I added s & p, seasoned salt, and parmesan to the rue, that made it really good and creamy!  The kids really liked this recipe and it's so much better knowing all the chemicals aren't in it!!  Thank you!

Good basic recipe for comfort food. Did it with chicken thigh meat. Extra onions, no peas (hate them!). Wish I had mushrooms. I added onion powder, garlic powder and parsley as well as plenty of salt & pepper (at the table as well because it still needed it).  Poured in an extra 1/2 cup of milk and a dollop of sour cream when i mixed in the noodles, then baked it in a 9x12" pyrex for about 20 minutes on convection and it was plenty of time and it wasn't dry. Everyone took seconds and even picky teen didn't complain about the "stuff" in it...probably because I chopped the veggies fine in the food processor.

I found this recipe as written bland and unexciting.  I added extra garlic, garlic salt, sherry, tons of salt and pepper to the white sauce and it was still bland.  So I ended up throwing a can of cream of mushroom in with extra milk - this helped a little, but even with the extra sauce, the casserole still dried out after baking. I also think this needs more tuna, it was barely noticable.  I probably will try another recipe before this one again, but thank you!

I am kind of at a loss as to why this received such glowing reviews from everyone.  It's dry and it's flavorless until you add what you think will make it worthwhile.  So....I added a teaspoon of chicken boullion granuales to both the pasta as it cooked as well as the white sauce, and then added garlic powder, paprika and light sour cream to the white sauce since it obviously needed MORE.  I did not have celery but used more onions and mushrooms and decided to throw in some frozen corn kernals as well.  After changing this up, it was good enough to even go back for seconds...but I am afraid I can't give a fantastic review to something that would have been bland and too dry to eat without making changes.  With the changes it is close to a 5....but I am still hoping to find something less in need of doctoring.  Thanks anyway!

Very good!  I added 4 cloves of garlic, a splash of dry white wine and slightly less mushrooms, as well as cooked the vegetables with the roux and sauce.  I also used whole wheat noodles, mozzarella cheese and cut down on the butter.  We never use canned soups, so this was the type of tuna casserole we were looking for and it didn't disappoint.  I give it four stars because we did alter it a bit because it would have been a bit bland otherwise.

I've made this twice. The first time I followed the directions. The second time I did not add bread crumbs, cheese, or bake it. I felt baking it dried the sauce. I was great just straight off the stove top.

I was actually disappointed as I was expecting this to be amazing.  It was ok.  It tasted too buttery for my liking and I didn't even use as much as called for; however it was completely finished.  I will try it again and tweek it to our liking (more spicy for sure) as it is definately a good base.  Thanks for the recipe.

Yup!! I found another winner!! My family rolled their eyes when I told them we were having tuna casserole for dinner so after making this recipe I wasn't surprised when I found the entire dish cleaned up!! I didn't get seconds and they did! Now it is requested without the eyes rolling! Thanks for a great recipe!!

My husband LOVES tuna noodle casserole, and I must admit this was a good one.  I liked the idea of not using canned soup with whatever ingredients end up in that!  Followed the recipe as written, until I got to the topping.  Rather than using bread crumbs, I substituted about 1/2 to 1c of French's French Fried Onions, then topped with the cheddar cheese.  It was good!

Two words: comfort food. Delicious! I followed the recipe to a tee, minus the onions because I didn't have any. I loved this casserole. Next time I'm going to use more of the bread crumbs because I think they really make the dish. I just took a big helping to my boyfriend at work. I can't wait to try it with the onions, since I adore them.

This is the best Tuna Casserole recipe I've tasted! Finally a recipe with out those canned soups.   My husband loves it also.   This recipe calls for basic ingredients so it's a great back-up dish on days I don't have anything defrosted.  I do add a few extra seasonings to the cream/milk mixture for extra flavor (garlic, paprika, Johnny's seasoning) for personal taste and I've tried it with various shaped pasta's and always wonderful!   
Thanks for the great recipe!

Great 'from scratch' recipe!  Definitely tastes like a true southern comfort food.  I wouldn't try to 'lighten' this up either, for those cooks concerned about fat content.  This is one of those dishes you have on your 'cheat' night, lol.  :-)  I subsituted half the milk with cream and used lots of garlic.  I also topped my casserole with crumbled potato chips instead of bread crumbs.  I also left out the cheese as I am not a fan of it.  I may try adding just a dab of cornstarch next time to thicken it up just a little more since leaving out the cheese obviously 'thins' out the dish a little.  Overall, very tasty!

I'm giving this 5 stars because I'm glad to have a recipe from scratch that is much better than the other recipes with canned soup. I used angel hair because I didn't have any regular noodles, no mushrooms or peas, and as one other reviewer did, I mixed the cheese with the cream mixture and melted it before mixing the cream in with everything else, also added 1 t chicken boullion to the cream. I used all the cheese in the cream too, instead of half of it. I used the buttered bread crumbs on top. I thought it could use more tuna and less pasta, but my husband liked it just as it was, and also said it is better than the other versions. So I guess I'll keep it the same! Thanks!

This is a great recipe- I love being able to say I made something from scratch!  The first time I made it, it turned out a little dry.  The second time, I added 2/3 cup more milk, and that was a little too much.  I still need to experiment with the milk, otherwise this is a great tasting recipe!

I'm not a big tuna fan and I loved this!  I followed a few of the previously mentioned modifications...added 2 tsp of chicken bouilion granules, lots of pepper and used Ritz crackers on the top.  This will definetly become a regular at our house.

This was delicious! It is a nice change for regular tuna casserole. We put crumbled potato chips on instead of the bread crumbs although that would have been good to.

This was a good recipe.  Took really no time at all to prepare.  Sauce was a little bland, needed a lot of salt (my wife loved it).  I used canned mushrooms as it was all I had, and used saltine crackers in lew of bread crumbs.  I will make again with the following suggestions, use a 9x13 baking dish to maximize topping coverage (per my wife)

Very forgiving recipe.  Didn't have mushrooms, egg noodles, or cheddar cheese on hand so used spaghetti noodles and swiss cheese instead.  My husband and 8-year-old son both proclaimed it "a keeper" despite the substitutions.  Will definately make again.

Instead of top with bread crumbs, my mom made this and put it on buttered toast.  It is a family favorite to this day!  Delicious!  I am going to try it with the toppings the next time.

My husband and I absolutely loved this delicious recipe!! I added 1/2 cup of sour cream to the sauce to make it creamier. Instead of using bread crumbs I topped it with one package of ritz crackers mixed with 2 tablespoons of butter. Will definitely be making this again.

I made this following the directions to the letter, except for adding a little chopped red bell pepper to the veggie mix. It came out very well, and my wife and I both love it.

My only problem was that the recipe underestimated by asking for a "medium baking dish"... by the time I got through putting everything together, the onion/veggie mix, the mushrooms, the tuna, and the noodles, I had enough stuff to fill a 13x9 pyrex dish. That's not a complaint; we've gotten 3 dinners for 2 out of this recipe. I also think it's a bit under seasoned, so I'll be increasing the salt/pepper, maybe a little cajun seasoning. Great recipe; we're keeping this one.

I have made a few tuna fish casseroles in my day and by far this is the best I have ever had. I could not stop eating it. I made it according to the recipe with minor changes. I chopped up the mushrooms versus slicing them and added a pinch of onion powder and parsley to the mushroom mixture. Instead of breadcrumbs I crumbled potato chips on top (I just prefer them over the breadcrumbs) adds a little more crunch. My husband loved it and said it was the best he had ever had. I will totally make this again and again. Thank you for an awesome recipe.

Very good!   My picky 6 year old step son had never had tuna noodle casserole and loved it!   He is already asking if we can just eat it tonight for dinner.  Halfway through he asked what the green things were.  He figured it out that they were peas (and he doesn’t like peas) but he continued to eat them.  I had orecchiette pasta on hand that I used.  I also made double the bread crumb topping and broiled the last few minutes

I did make a few adjustments. I use any pasta I have on hand honestly. I do not always have egg noodles. I use a whole onion 10 ounces of mushrooms and like a bulb of garlic. I double the tuna and I add chicken bouillon for salt. I added bread crumbs then shredded Italian three cheese blend. When it’s close to done I add Trader Joe’s fried onions ( french’s onions tend to be too salty) I agree with another person I am tired of canned soup this and canned soup that recipes. Oh for those with kids who “hate” mushrooms I use a stick blender to make it creamier.

I did make a couple of changes. I didn't have any mushrooms so I just left them out. I also used home made type noodles but I weighed them out so that turned out to be the right amount. ALso when I combined the sauce with the vegies I added about 1/3 of an 8 oz. package of cream cheese and let it melt and combined it with the sauce. When I put the noodles and peas in and covered it with cheese I just let it sit covered on a very low heat while I got the rest of dinner ready. It was perfect.

This is really good. I used the advice of a previous reviewer and made the sauce with the mushroom/onion mixture. The cooked mushrooms fave the dish a good flavor. If you purchase precut onions, use about 1/2 a cup. 

I made my own breadcrumbs by adding 2 slices of sourdough bread to a food processor and grinding them up to get course crumbs. Toss that with the melted butter, and it gives you a nice crunchy topping. What I did do different was sprinkle the cheese on top first, and then add the breadcrumbs.

Next time, I would add cheese into the body of the casserole as well as on top.  It was good and not spicy - which worked well for us.  I would probably add more garlic though. I also had 12 oz package of peas and used it all --- there were a lot of peas! Again, that worked well for us.

My wife and I both loved this and I will certainly make it again. One change I will make is to make more bread crumb crust next time. Oh, and the bag of egg noodles was 12 oz so I cooked the whole amount and it was still fine.

This was so good! Just me and my husband, so I halved the recipe. We don't care for onions and celery...just our preference, so we left it out. I used canned chicken instead of tuna. We cleaned the bowl! Will definitely make this again!

I made it exactly as written, it tasted good, but sadly was way too dry. I probably won’t be making it again, unless I figure out a way to make it not so dry.

Tasted great with additional salt when plated. I give it a 4 because it was quite dry....I may try adding some extra butter pats, or some kind of broth in it before the topping.

Good, taken a bit longer than I estimated to put together.

Reasonably bland, but a little soy sauce on it after plating makes a big difference.  Will make again.  Also, I made it with mackerel  which is cheaper and it suited the recipe well.

I made this last night and found it to be very bland. At the table we added chipotle seasoning. Helped some... but needs something else.  I liked the cheese... could probably use more. Maybe next time I will add velveeta cheese for  moisture.

Delicious. Only change I made was to add a few drops of Tabasco sauce and to substitute crispy onions for the bread crumbs. As suggested by others I did everything in one pan.  Used mafaldine noodles.

used French Fried onion rings instead of bread crumbs as mentioned earlier.  This dish was a favorite for years using mushroom soup, etc., but no longer.  Next time will add some corn and jalapeno's.

Very good made from scratch casserole. Making it with all fresh ingredients helped to cut down on the sodium that making it normally with creamed can soups. The fresh mushrooms enhanced the flavor. Before the bread crumbs and cheese topping I did season with paprika. Family really enjoyed and I will definitely use it as my go to tuna casserole recipe.

Requires 2Qt casserole dish.  Somewhat bland, lacks any bite, lots of salt & pepper at the dinner table.  If you need a scratch recipe, try the Joy.

After reading others' reviews I made the following changes, and we were very pleased with the results:
Added/Increased:
-As I planned to freeze individual portions for a "Meal Train", I increased the amount of white sauce by upping the butter and flour portions about 20%.
-I added another 4oz of chopped mushrooms, doubled the garlic and added another 1/2 cup peas.
-I added crushed reds and fresh thyme to taste.
I added1/4 c. parmesan cheese to the sauce and1 heaping T. to the breadcrumb mixture - which I also increased, just because it's so good.
It was very tasty, thank you!

I did add the garlic AFTER the mushrooms, and then added a big splash of white wine.  I prepared the pasta first, as suggested, and found that they were gumming up on me as I worked on the rest of the dish and they continued to cook, so I rinsed them in cold water.

This is truly delicious!!  I followed the cooking directions exactly.  For ingredients, I added canned chicken instead of tuna and also added water chestnuts.  When I assembled, I put half in casserole dish, covered with cheese, then added the other half and covered that with cheese also.  Then added buttered bread crumbs.  My husband raved about it.  I'd be proud to share this when a neighbor needs a meal.

Great recipe. I agree with previous reviewer that there are great ways to lighten and spice this dish and I’ll try her suggestions next time but my family enjoyed this a lot as is...great comfort food on a rainy evening after a stressful day at work!

Delish! Will definitely make this again. Added a few splashes of Worcestershire  Sauce and a squirt of yellow mustard; two ingredients I always add to my  mac & cheese recipe as well.

Holy cow was this good! I didn’t have the right cheese so I put a tablespoon of port wine cheddar spread ,tore up two pieces of  Havarti
And mixed them in. No additional salt or pepper. Used ( homemade)Parmesan  bread crumbs for the top. Best tuna noodle casserole in my life. No exaggeration!! I really think making a milk roux and no canned soup makes all the difference in the world.

Delicious! Only change I made was to mix cheddar cheese into casserole instead of putting it on top. Thank you for a yummy recipe!

Honestly, I wasn’t crazy about it. I would make it creamier next time and it could definitely use a little more pizazz to liven up the taste.

I made it, but changed it a bit to make it more tasty. For sprucing up the extra ingredients I used all fresh products. I chopped up into smaller pieces of 8 Oz of fresh mushrooms, one med size onion, 1cup of frozen peas, two ribs of celery and fried it all in 3 T of butter. I also added while frying on low,1teas of chopped garlic, and 1/4 c of sherry wine after you finishing frying. For the sauce I added 4oz of cream cheese 3/4c of sour cream and one can of cream of celery soup, plus one teas of chopped garlic, 1T of salt, 1/2 teas of pepper, 1/8c of sugar, all to the slurry you make to create the sauce. Make sure you add the cream of celery soup last as your making the slurry or the cream cheese will be lumpy. you make before you add the rest of the milk. I dilute it with 1/4 of milk afterwards after its thickens if you want. Always keep in mind the noodles absorb the liquid after it sits in the frig over night, so it always makes good sense to keep it real juicy the first time you make it for left overs. Just before you put it in the oven I added 1 cup of shredded sharp cheese over the top with 1/2 c of Parmesan cheese then I crushed potato chips over that instead of bread crumbs. For appearance I sprinkled dried parsley over the top of that. Oh so yummy but really fattening. Enjoy!

I was very happy with this recipe, it was a real comfort food recipe.  I've made tuna noodle casserole many times before and this is my favorite recipe and my family agrees.  I did make one small change (I don't like to do this the first time, I usually make it exactly the way it's written), however I felt that the mushrooms would not cook through unless previously browned so I did make that change.  Very good comfort food!

I used fresh frozen tuna, rice pasta, canned peas, spelt flour and gluten free panko. Had to bake 10 mins longer to brown the cheese a little.  Yummy comfort food!

Saved this a while ago and just got around to making it, sorry I took so long. I did some alterations as suggested by other reviews. Added 2/3 cup old cheddar to the sauce, used fried onions on top instead of the breadcrumbs/butter mixture, and doubled the garlic. 
Turned out fantastic. Great comfort food for a winter day.

This recipe is good as written, but kind of bland.  However, if I make it again, I would add crumbled up potatoe chips for more flavor or a cup of breadcrumbs mixed with melted butter instead of 3T.   This just needed more texture and salt.

I have made this numerous times.  The only change I would always recommend is to use 3 cans of tuna.  For two people, this is a large amount, but it freezes well.  When it is thawed, I like to remake the topping and put it in the oven to heat through.  It is usually enough for 3 meals with some leftovers.

Came out great. Doubled everything to fill a 9x13 pan, just fit. Based on a review added a 1/4 cup of parm, some of the cheddar called for as a topping and a 1/4 cup of cream cheese. Oh yeah, red pepper flakes and peas and carrot combo from freezer section. Just be careful to keep your doubling math correct for the roux. No read crumbs, used crushed potatoe chips.

I found that the white sauce lacked flavor.  I will try this recipe again but will need to make a few changes. Perhaps saute the onions and celery in the butter for the rue?  Brown the mushrooms separately.

I thought it was really wonderful and I’ve been eating it all week.  I’m also trying freezing a little portion to see how that works. I can’t eat milk so I substituted almond milk and it worked great!!

Too dry for me. Flavor is way better than with mushroom soup only but a little bland. needs more condiments.  
Double up the white sauce, add pepper, salt, nutmeg, like a real bechamel. 
Add a third can of tuna and season the tuna meat.

It was really great to  find a recipe that didn’t use canned soup. We truly enjoyed this casserole and would definitely make it again. Next time though, some more cheese on the top. Otherwise I wouldn’t change a thing.

Since all flavor is carried by fat (a fact not lost on the French), I used half and half. I also butter-poached the peas, carrots, and added Mushrooms for good measure.

My husband loved it.  I thought it needed more crunch ( perhaps not sautéing the celery) and not as much pasta.  It seemed a little too gooey.

This was a little time consuming to make but my husband and I both agreed, it was well worth the effort it took.  We followed the recipe as directed.  The tuna flavor was mild which I really loved.  Don’t think we will ever even try another tuna casserole recipe.  This was a winner!

This recipes makes a great base, you just need to add herbs and spices to your liking.  I use a bouillon cube, parsley, nutmeg, celery seed, thyme and dill.  I also like ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs on tip.  I lso double the sauce.  Great base recipe that you can make your own.

I have made this several times with very few changes to original.  I added chicken broth for more flavor. Instead of making the roux I just added the additional butter to the sauteed veggies mix, sprinkled with the flour, mixed until the flour was absorbed and then added the milk to thicken.  Saw no reason to dirty 2 pans. Also microwaved the butter and stirred in the bread crumbs for the topping. Less dishes the better!

I did find the recipe as written a little bland, but I added more garlic power and some red pepper flakes for my families preferences and was perfect.  Sauce was plenty and I like the idea of no canned soup!  Thanks for the recipe!

I can’t imagine how bland it would have been if I didn’t add spices per other reviewers. Also, seems dry, like it should be a little saucier? I think it’s a good base but would need tweaking to be amazing.

I made this pretty much exactly as written, except I doubled it times four for a crowd.  I think it was a bit under-seasoned, as the instructions were "to taste," and I was leery of over-salting it.  Also I forgot to add pepper.

The original recipe said it would serve 6, so I should have had enough for 24, but there was a lot left over--probably enough for 32, so six would be very generous portions.  I think most of the servings were about a 1 cup.  It was a lot of chopping but I think worth it to have a dish with all fresh ingredients.

This recipe made it into my cookbook and for that to happen,  my whole family has to like it.  I made as written minus the little bit of bread crumb mixture on the top and added about 1/2-3/4 cup of cheese to the sauce along with a couple tsp of chicken bouillon liquid. Yum!!

5 stars for giving me a non-processed version of a favorite childhood dish. I went with a "what is in the kitchen" approach, and instead of peas used some carrots and extra celery, as well as a bit of orange and red bell pepper (the little ones diced up). Whoops, not enough milk, so a splash of condensed milk and a bit of water. Put half the cheese mixed in, the rest as directed on top. Oh, and I only had baby Portobello on hand.  Could not resist a quarter cup of Just Mayo, though, for the zest. The bread crumbs I have been using are soggy in every recipe (sigh) so I added more and more to the butter until they were crumbly and spreadable. Anyway, thank you for bringing back an old fave, without the packaged mac and cheese and MSG soup base. The flavor y'all are missing is the MSG, btw....oh, some reviewers appear to be reviewing other review's recipes, like "too much thyme" which is not in the original at all.

Update 9/18/19 - made this recipe again tonight.  Love with the changes I’ve already noted.  Also, I put the shredded cheese on top of casserole first and then added Panko bread crumbs last. Makes for a nice crusty top! This is a great recipe.  The fresh mushrooms give this dish such a fresh taste.  I added a cup of chicken broth after making the sauce as I thought it was a little too thick and we also like things “saucy”.  I  doubled the amount of bread crumbs and butter for the topping using Panko bread crumbs..

Made this last night for dinner. The first thing my husband said was "this is creamy" (that's good!). Followed the recipe other than using canned peas since that's all I had on hand, and adding more garlic and some Old Bay since other reviewers said it was a bit bland. Even with the additional spices, it still needed more (so I just added some salt at the table). That's the only thing that kept me from rating it 5 stars. Even though it is from scratch, it's still very easy; I will make it again. (Eating leftovers for lunch right now... still yummy)

I really like this recipe.  I think it's healthier than using canned mushroom soup.  I followed the directions with just a few tweaks:  I sauteed the onion, celery, garlic and mushrooms at the same time in an increased amount of butter.  Once they were softened, I sprinkled the flour over them, stirred to create a roux and then slowly poured in the milk while continuing to stir.  When the mixture had thickened, I added half of the cheese and then the tuna, peas and  pasta (I used elbow twists because that's what I had on hand).  Instead of black pepper I used white pepper, a pinch of nutmeg and cayenne.  To add a little color, I chopped up some jarred roasted red pepper and mixed it in.  For the topping, I added a little grated Romano cheese along with the bread crumbs and rest of the cheddar.  It came out great!  My husband liked it, too.  This will go into my rotation and can be made with canned or leftover chicken as well.

Used one 6 oz tuna steak instead of 2 cans of tuna. Precooked tuna on GF grill. Used less butter to sauté onion, celery & carrots. Didn’t use mushrooms (not a fan). Used penne pasta. Added about 1 Tbsp of chicken-flavored base to the white sauce for flavor. I don’t like to use canned cream soups. Too much salt, etc. If you’re not a canned tuna fan (like me) try this recipe with fresh or frozen tuna. Incredibly good.

Changes? You bet! I pan friend two small fillet salmon - wildcaught, fresh. I used that instead of the tuna. Also - I added cheddar to the sauce, along with a dash of paprika, dash of mustard and dash of tumeric. Then a few sprigs fresh parsley.  Rest as in recipe. YUM! Anyway, I would have used lobster but the salmon was in my budget. Enjoy

Second time making this particular recipe. Decent but on the bland side. Next time I’ll halve the peas and add some additional seasonings as salt and pepper wasn’t enough. Has great potential which is why I gave it four stars vs. three.

Minus the onions, but everything else spot on, it was quite tasty.  I like the idea of adding a chicken bouillon cube, which I will do next time.  Thanks so much!

Would have been amazing if I had used 2 cans of the good tuna but I only had one and then one of the non chunk tuna and it wrecked it. :( I felt so silly it was all my fault. The hungry boys, my hungry hubby, and mother in law still ate and enjoyed! Oh my, how it could have been so much better...

I use almond milk and whole grain noodles, so that may have been why it  was a little bland. I also skipped the breadcrumbs and butter to keep it healthier. I like that it's versatile with veggies. I’ve made it twice and it’s just not flavorful enough for us.

I was out of Campbells Cream of Mushroom soup and came upon this recipe.  I will NEVER make it with canned soup again!!  Delicious.  I was out of frozen peas so omitted those.  Never really liked the peas in the casserole anyway.  I was also out of celery so used celery seed.  Really super good.

I'm probably going to annoy people because I actually haven't made this particular recipe.  This is just a suggestion.  I find that adding fresh grated nutmeg to a white sauce gives it flavour without overpowering anything else in it.

I cut this recipe in half since its just the two of us. I will definitely make this again but next time I will only halved the pasta and keep the other ingredients the same . Great flavor a little more work than the canned soup ones but so much better. I spreyed the baking dish with cooking spray and used half the amount of buttter .

Good. A little bland. Might try adding something in the future to dress it up a bit. Made a lot. Made full 9x11 pan - enough for 6 servings. Did use a bit of chicken bouillon in roux to add some flavor - but needs a bit more of something. Used crackers instead of bread crumbs and along with the cheese made a great topping.

I made this for a group of 85 adults and children.   I made it using pricey solid white albacore. When asked by the guests what it was, I answered (and instructed staff to also say) that it's a "yummy casserole".  I handed out twenty requested recipe cards!  No one even asked if it was tuna because the smell was so enticing and the taste was rich and delicious.  Even the staff could hardly believe it was tuna!
I make this recipe several times during fall/winter.

I was craving my mom's recipe but wanted to try this one from scratch. It came out very similar. I Pam sprayed my dish (didn't do butter) and used elbow noodles since I didn't have small egg noodles.  I did feel it was a lot of butter in all so I'd probably substitute some of it next time. My buttered bread crumbs clumped on top and didn't really do much for us, so I would use potato chips crumbled on top like my other recipe.  And I'd add more salt at some point than what i used. All in all good recipe!

This recipe was great! Of course like I do with all recipes, I tweaked it a bit. I boiled my noodles in chicken stock and garlic cloves, mixed swiss cheese in with my sauce and used Ritz as my topping! It was perfect, even the kiddos loved it!

The sauce was more like a gravy, but it did taste good. I did steps 3 and 4 in the same  large ovenproof pan, then I added the cooked noodles into the sauce, topped with cheese and breadcrumbs and baked--fewer dishes to clean!

I really liked the fresh taste compared to soup base. I followed the recipe except I used French fried onions in place of the bread crumbs. I think I will add more cheese next time.

Excellent flavor - takes three pots going on the stove and a casserole dish (lots of cleanup) , so it is not a quick and easy recipe, but worth the extra time and effort.

A recipe review IMNSHO is of the recipe as prepared by the original chef/cook who wrote it.  A recipe review isn't about how someone made it so they would like it.  If you follow this recipe as written it will be some of the best Tuna Casserole you have ever had.  Flavorful, not too salty, just an all around great one dish meal.  Do I fix it up to my taste?  Sometimes, but that is for me and my family.  And to those who say this needs to be healthier... PSH.  This is comfort food.  And newsflash:  Butter and fat is GOOD FOR YOU.  The right kind of salt is GOOD FOR YOU.  Do some research, shop for quality non-GE, Organic, Sustainable ingredients and don't throw together a bunch of garbage from the "bargain" isle and you will have a wonderful, healthy, organic comfort food dish that you can barely stop eating.  I have made this at least 10 times for my family and am getting ready to make it again right now.  Thank you to the cook for sharing their take on HOMEMADE Tuna Casserole.

Love this. Used rotini as it's what I had in the pantry, skipped the peas and used a portobello in the mini chopper instead. Also per other comments added a little red pepper flakes and thyme. Yum!

I am on a low sodium diet - happy to have found this! Made it for dinner tonight - left out the salt and it was perfect anyway! No more cooking with canned soup here!

I made this again tonight - I used crimini mushrooms but kept everything else as written. The family's review DELICIOUS !!! I hope there's some left for my lunch tomorrow :)

I liked this one. I usually make mine with the cream of mushroom canned soup, so this seemed lighter and healthier.  We also used a high fiber no yolk noodle that made the casserole feel very light after eating it. 

 I did season the roo more with onion powder and Italian seasoning, parsley, cracked black pepper and salt. However in the end it still seemed like it needed a bit more salt. I think the key is to get the sauce seasoned right.  I also added an additional can of tuna.  Therefore I had 3-5 oz cans in all.  I did want more onion than the half it called for.  Maybe a whole sweet vadailia onion but a half for a white onion.

 Used 3 tbls of parmasean in the crumble and about a half cup of mozerella 5 mins before it was done.  I prefer the white cheeses on it.

  Overall a good twist from the hyper sodium canned soup version!  It will definitely go into the rotation!

I used 1 cup milk & 1 cup of chicken broth as per some other reviewers and mozza cheese instead of cheddar and crushed potato chips instead of bread crumbs.  It was quite good and made lots,  I also did it in a casserole dish so it was nice and moist.  Hubby loved it.

Absolutely loved this!!!  Added a bit more garlic, some freeze dried dill, and cayenne pepper to the sauce.  I normally do not like tuna, but both my husband and I thought it was lovely.  Served it with a salad.

loved this!  I never made tuna casserole before and this recipe was definitely delicious. I used Brown rice fusili instead of egg noodles and almond milk rather than regular. I had fresh canned tuna rather than store bought.  Did not add in the mushrooms since those aren't to my taste but otherwise made as written. Quick and easy to throw together, a great winter recipe I will make again.

Since neither the husband nor the picky 8 year-old daughter will touch tuna, I made this solely for myself in an 8x8" baking dish, which worked out perfectly!  Omitted the celery due to not having it on hand, and omitted the  mushrooms because I never make a tuna casserole with them. For the sauce, I melted 3 Tbsp butter and used 1 3/4 c milk  seasoned generously with both garlic and onion powders as well as nutmeg, parsley and chives, sea salt and pepper.  I also mixed in a handful of shredded parmesan cheese. I used two pouches of Starkist tuna and eyeballed frozen peas to my liking. I also added a few shakes of Worcestershire sauce as well for a little zing. I omitted the butter from the topping and simply used the last of my Panko crumbs, some crushed Honey Dijon potato chips and sprinkled parmesan cheese over the top  - -  so incredibly good! I baked for only 15 minutes and thoroughly enjoyed it for dinner as well as the leftovers, which reheated nicely. I will definitely make this again to satisfy my tuna noodle casserole craving when it arises. Quick, easy, and delicious!

Great base recipe. Five stars because tuna noodle casserole is meant to be a quick weeknight dinner, and this recipe keeps it that way while avoiding the use of canned soup. This could be modified in many ways- white sauce variations, different types of meat or veggies etc...

Yum yum yum!! Orders of magnitude better than my old standby recipe using canned cream of mushroom soup - and hardly any more prep. I used crushed Ritz crackers instead of breadcrumbs, but that's just my personal preference for topping this kind of casserole.

My changes: Gluten Free Penne Noodles
Fate Free Cream of Mushroom Soup
6 slices of American Cheese
2 drained cans of solid white tuna
1/2 cup milk
Seasonings:
Ground Pepper
Salt
Minced Garlic
Dried Onion
Basically mix all together after you put in hot noodles and cheese melts and pour into buttered casserole dish.  I crushed Ritz crackers and some Italian Croutons together and sprinkled on top. Baked for 30 minutes and it a hit!!  I served with sweet corn from the can and toasted leftover hamburger buns with butter and garlic and the family said it was tasty!!

This casserole was yummy. I did make a few changes, didn't use as many mushrooms as stated and chopped them into smaller pieces (not a fan of mushrooms), next time I'll add more, they give it a nice flavor. The other changes I made was to use 1.5 cups chicken broth and .5 cup heavy cream (because I had no milk) and added a little thyme and nutmeg. Used crushed potato chips instead of the breadcrumb topping, an old family tradition.

I added a little more seasoning and also found it a little dry. Will add more liquid for a thinner sauce. Liked by everyone and will make it again maybe trying canned salmon.  Good basic recipe

Very good! I doubled everything (except noodles)but there's still too many noodles(a little dry). I could have feed 6 large people easily!   To cut fat content. I used 1 can (12 oz)of chicken broth plus 1 cup low fat milk. Sautéed the veggies in olive oil. Did everything in one deep frying pan. When celery & onion were half done, added mushrooms in same pan & cook them a little . Stired  flour into all veggies(same pan) added liquid to thicken. Threw everything together baked in a 9x13 pan. Next time I  will use smaller bag of noodles, same amount of liquid.

Made mostly  as recipe stated and was very dry.  I even used about 2 oz. less noodles so it wouldn't be dry.  The flavor was good enough (I did add some garlic powder b/c I didn't have fresh garlic) but next time I would probably double or at least 1 1/2 the sauce to make it more creamy.  Just tasted like tuna and noodles, the sauce part pretty  much got lost. I used Ritz crackers and butter for the topping and that did add some flavor.  Will try again and double the sauce.

Followed basic recipe however, added a tsp of chicken Better than Boullion.  Added a little of the shredded cheese to the sauce, and didn't bother adding any on top.  Used a mixture of French's fried onion and breadcrumbs for topping.  A little cracked pepper and parmesan to serve.  We loved the fact that this recipe wasn't bogged down with soup.

Will definitely make this again. A great, no canned food (except the tuna) recipe! Turned out amazing as-is. This is a great base to use for many different variations. Thanks!!!

If you're looking for yummy comfort food, this is it!   This recipe is absolutely fabulous as- is.   Having said that, I prefer the recipe with a few modifications, most of which are echoed in other reviews I read.    1: add a bit of nutmeg and thyme to the white sauce.   2: replace bread crumbs with fried onions or crushed onion flavored potato chips.   3: reduce the cheese by half.  4: Use high quality canned tuna.   The cost difference is Well Worth the additional $1 or so.   I prefer Cento brand, packed in olive oil, which I drain but don't rinse off.  The taste is unbelievably superior.

Very good.  Used hen-of-the-woods mushrooms instead, which gave it much more flavor.  And next time i'll double the breadcrumbs, enough to top the entire casserole.  Also, crumbs on-top of the cheese is the way to go...

I loved this, it was so good! The changes I made were no mushrooms, and just cheese topping. I thought the flavors were a delicious combination! I needed to add more salt next time!

This seems to be the only place where I can make notes about what I did... This is a great base recipe, easily adapted to fit tastes and diet restrictions. I followed advice from a couple other posters and followed the recipe with the following adjustments:

- for my family of 6 I doubled the recipe - I'd rather have leftovers than not enough
- I used a sprayed 9x13 pan
- I would've preferred egg noodles but didn't have any, I used a 16 oz box of elbows. I used most of them, but all of them would've been too much.
- I would've preferred to used thyme, but again was out! So I added 1 tsp. marjoram, 1/4 tsp. nutmeg, and 1/4 tsp. crushed red pepper - I could've used more of all of these in my doubled recipe.
- I always double the garlic in any recipe!
- I added a splash of white wine to the sautéing veggies
- When making the white sauce I halved the butter and used 3 c. fat free evaporated milk and 1 c. (no salt added) chicken broth, I also added 1/4 c. parmesan, 2 oz. cream cheese (reduced fat), and a handful of shredded Italian cheese mix (I would've preferred a sharp cheddar but didn't have but enough for the top of the casserole.
- I like peas in tuna casserole but I didn't have in any so instead I added 1/2 cup chopped cherry tomatoes - more would've been better but that's what I had.
- I eliminated the butter mixed with the bread crumbs and just sprinkled the dry bread crumbs on top.
- I halved or eliminated the butter at each step.

I've made this probably a dozen times.  It's delicious no matter what.  If I have any fresh greens, I salute them and add them to the mix.  I also mix the cheddar cheese right into the sauce and leave off the butter and bread crumbs.  There are never any leftovers.  I think it would be good with any vegetables added to make it healthier.

Good recipe for a base, worth augmenting. As written, recipe results in a bit of a dry, bland, and rather boring product. a disappointment.

This casserole was so good. I only made 1 change in the recipe. We are milk free at our house so I subbed water and chicken bouillon cubes for the milk and left the cheese off the top. Great!

Fairly easy to make, I just found that the measurements for the sauce were slightly off, but I added a little more flour and all was fine.  Great recipe.

I love "From Scratch" comfort food! Thanks for the great recipe. The only thing I had to adjust was I added some chicken stock to the veggies while sauteing (mine were pretty dry and needed to cook a little longer) and a little garlic powder after mixing everything (my family loves garlic!)

This recipe is a good guide for tuna casserole but definitely needs some changes to be a success. Doubled the amount of garlic, onion and celery. I took the advice from other comments to add thyme and nutmeg. It still wasn't enough seasoning. I used 1 tsp of Old Bay spice and 1 tsp salt to the sauce mixture. Also, I would recommend a quick broil of the cheese/breadcrumb crumble rather than baking for 25mins to keep your casserole moist. I find baking dries it out. Hope this helps.

01-11-16 ~ Made this up for the family in the morning and baked it in the evening.  They loved the taste.  Since I mixed it up early I should have added additional liquid to account for the noodles sucking up the extra liquids.  This was very simple to make and they all enjoyed it.  I like the fact that you make your own roux rather than using a can of cream of soup.

Made this a week ago and again today. My suggestions-use baby bella mushrooms (sautéed them separate from celery/onion mix). Used heavy cream vs milk. Used cayenne pepper in sauce. Threw a splash of sherry in with mushrooms. Ex on the cheese. Doubled up on Panko bread crumbs. Good, but still a tad bit bland! Hmmmm. Maybe more garlic?

Minor changes after making the first time just as written.  Good, solid comfort food but we like to kick comfort food up nearer to a level of sin.  Added a few spices (dash of nutmeg, chipotle powder and mustard powder) and some herbs (basil, savory and tarragon).  Onion powder can be used in place of the real thing if your feeding folks who aren't fond of onion bits or try using a sweet onion vs a yellow onion and purée it in a food processor.  My husband detests tasting onions in his food but doesn't mind the flavor.  I puree a lot of onions in my kitchen but sometimes shortcuts are necessary; those are the nights I use the powder.  We add more mushrooms and make extra sauce for individual preference in a family with widely ranging taste buds.  When making additional sauce the first time, I ended up needing to thin it some and used some milk along with a cup or so of mushroom broth and have made it this way ever since.  We've made similar dishes using milk and chicken broth and while that's tasty, the mushroom broth brings out very savory flavors that balance beautifully with the creamy roux base.  'Course, you have to like mushrooms, too.  My favorite brand of broth bases, other than Mom's homemade, is "Better than Bouillon" in a variety of flavors found at several local grocers around our Willamette Valley, Oregon home.   We love this topped with crispy fried onions as much as with bread crumbs.  Great recipe, very versatile.  For those who thought the sauce tasted too mu

This may be time consuming to make, but it is the best tuna casserole.  Thank you for submitting.

This was very good, I did make a few changes based on personal preference and other reviews. Doubled the recipe for a 9x13 pan. Used cream instead of milk and skipped the flour. Used portabella mushrooms instead white, broccoli instead of peas. Used more tuna and less noodles. Tripled the fresh garlic. Added nutmeg, thyme, onion powder, paprika, and extra salt and pepper. For the topping I used Italian panko bread crumbs mixed with the butter and tripled the amount. Also used a blend of 4 cheeses instead of just cheddar.

I'm not crazy about celery so I left that out of mine and added parmesean cheese to add a little bit more different flavor and it was awesome! The fresh ingredients make a difference to the taste of this classic! Awesome recipe to make, easy to do and feeds tons of people from one dish!

I made a few changes to the recipe, but I doubt these would have influenced my rating.  I substituted chopped red and green bell pepper for the celery, substituted canned mushrooms for fresh, and used a buttered cornflakes topping rather than buttered breadcrumbs.  I don't make a tuna casserole often, but think I prefer this recipe to others I've made previously, all of which included canned cream soups.  I think it needs a little something extra, though, and will be looking through the suggestions of other reviewers for changes to make next time.

Thanks so much for sharing this recipe. I had to make a bunch of changes because I was out of a lot of things, but without this recipe and other reviews, I would have no clue where to start.
I didn't measure anything and it still turned out amazing. My husband had seconds and says he doesn't like tune casserole.
Here are my changes. The only veggie I had was one medium zuchinni so I shredded it and added it to the sauteed onions and garlic. I used maybe half the butter but added a half block of cream cheese to the milk and 1 chicken boullian cube. I added parsley, dried celery, a bit of turmeric, ground cayenne, black pepper, about a tablespoon of mustard, 1/8 cup ranch dressing, rotini pasta and topped it off with 2 slices of swiss cheese, about 1/4 cup of colby jack, parmesan cheese and crushed corn chex and baked it for 28min @350.
I know it was a lot of substitutions, but it's all I had and worked out amazing! Comfort food.

This was good. It was a little bland but I liked that it was from scratch and didn't involve a can of soup.  I'll add a few more spices next time to make it more interesting. **An update: this time I added 1 tsp of thyme and a couple dashes of nutmeg. This definitely helped with the flavour.

This was delicious and easy! Everyone ran for seconds.  I reduced the butter some, used 1% milk, increased the peas, and skipped the mushrooms for my son who doesn't like them. It is a little dry, which I like. If you prefer  a creamier casserole, increase the roux 50%.  Make sure your pasta is slightly undercooked so it doesn't get mushy after baking.

If you don't like this, you didn't make it right.  USE BUTTER, it's good for you, those chemical sprays aren't better.  In France they use butter, and have extremely low incidence of heart disease.  It is the chemicals that companies put in your food and spray oils and everything else that cause the high incidence of heart disease in America.

We did not like this. I used Pam for cooking the veggies & greasing the pan and only topped with butter/bread crumb mixture-no cheese. I found the flavor to be overly strong of mushrooms & tuna with a strange background of peas. The sauce had almost no flavor.

OK, i was a bit hesitant about making this because i haven't had tuna casserole (the box ones) in ages and thought this would come out like that, but I've got to say it was delicious!!!  It wasn't too fishy and I love the fact that it was from scratch!!!!!!!!  I used Ritz crackers as the topping, but everything else was the same.  Thank you for this recipe, will definitely make it again.

I do not eat while I cook. I can bake dozens of cookies or cakes and hold off eating anything until I "officially" serve it. This. I could not hold back - it smelled and looked so good - and boy did it not disappoint! In fact, I could probably finish the entire pan in a day by myself. I added a few things: salt and pepper and 1 tsp consomme to the mushroom mix while sauteing (in olive oil); three cloves garlic; a handful of cheese in the noodle mixture; a sprinkle of dill because yum; crushed cornflakes instead of breadcrumbs. This is the first time I've made a tuna casserole and I will never bother with any other recipe. Perfection!

I used fresh Mahi tuna steaks and broiled for about 7mins/side. I made triple the recipe to make 2 cake pans. Next time I would double the bread crumb/butter and cheese topping. Use plenty of salt and pepper and the dish is great.

very good, made it before so added some spice to the béchamel sauce and added 3 garlic cloves because they were fresh from garden and not quite as potent as store bought and put some crushed French fried onions on top of cheese.   is a keeper

I used French's fried onion rings instead of bread crumbs.

Too much work for too little flavor.  Needs a lot more flavor.  I added vegetable bouillon to the white sauce, and parmesan on top after serving and being underwhelmed with the flavor.  A little on the dry side, too.

The basic recipe is good, except I reduced the cheese to 1/2 cup and then added into the noodle mixture right away. Place in 8 x 8 baking dish and then poured 1 cup of half and half milk right on top, gently mixing it in. to the bread crumb topping I added 1 packet of beef ramen noodle seasoning and poured on top of noodles.

This is my first time making tuna noodle casserole-I didn't grow up on it and honestly I had low expectations on this. I was wrong! This came out awesome! Used broccoli instead of peas. Great recipe to keep for emergencies back up dinner because this is so simple to make!

I agree with fellow reviewers that this, as written, is bland.  I had to add some salt and diced tomatoes to my bowl, my husband used quite a lot of Tabasco sauce on his plate.  I did make it with some cream cheese and added parm cheese to the tuna/veggie mixture.  Bottom line is: good base recipe that you need to tweak to your liking!  My husband's asked me to make it again and the kid that eats meat liked it.

Just made this and turned out great! I add extra garlic to everything. I also added a touch of nutmeg to the roux, pimentos to the vegetable mixture and used french fried onions on top instead of breadcrumbs. I think it would be delicious as is but I always make a few adjustments according to our taste. I agree it is much better than the canned soup version. Thanks!

This is now my go-to recipe for tuna casserole.  However, I'm only giving it 4 stars because as written it's a little bland and there is not near enough sauce.  I highly recommend doubling the sauce, adding extra garlic and a pinch of cayenne pepper, and topping with crushed potato chips instead of bread crumbs.  With those changes, it's fantastic!  I do love this recipe as a base, and it's the best I've found so far.

This is a great base recipe. I use half milk half chicken broth, cheddar cheese and parmesan. You can pretty much add any veggies or style noodles that you want and I'm sure it could be made with chicken as well.

Wonderful recipe! I found out right before assembling that the BF didn't like Tuna so I substituted chicken. The chicken was very good but it would've been amazing with tuna. I added onion crisps and crushed crackers to the top.

I think it's a good base.  But it was a little bland. The second time  I added, fresh dill, sage and lemon juice.  I also did olive oil instead of butter.  I added carrots, onion, chopped green beans.  This recipe is a great alternative to creams and soups.  My family loved it:)

Pretty good - I doubled all the aromatic vegetables, added nutmeg to the sauce, and some fresh parsley at the end (should have been dill, but I was out of dill).  It was pretty good, but not having grown up with tuna noodle casserole, I suspect I am just not feeling the comfort of this dish due to lack of familiarity.  I would repeat, but maybe once a year.

Guess next time I'll read reviews first! I too think the onions were a bit to much! And I also add an extra can of soup mixed with same amount of 2% milk so it was not so dry and then added pepper to liven it up!! Other then the a bit to much onion and a bit to dry ( fixed with the shop and milk fix) it was pretty darn good with a loaf of fresh backed french bread !!! O man so hardy and very rib sticking :P

This is very good with the changes made in the first review under "most helpful" although, I didn't use the evaporated milk or crushed red peppers. From the original recipe: I did not use celery as it makes me want to gag. I didn't have any frozen peas, either. And, I used crushed kettle cooked potato chips in place of the bread crumbs. The crunch is awesome and the chips add a little salty goodness. With all that said, I hate it when people review recipes and don't follow it exactly. Although, I did give it 4 stars so I forgive myself.

Great base recipe. Like others I did add somthings. Used peas and carrots, added sautéed onions and mushrooms and used one can of cream of celery soup. Also added used cheddar instead of American just due to personal taste. My wife is not a big tuna casserole fan and loved this.

I love that this recipe is a from scratch version instead of using canned soup. I have made this twice & modified it slightly both times. I sauteed a red pepper with my onion & garlic. I also used the pea/carrot mixture instead of just peas. To the roux I also add a few splashes of hot sauce and 1 tsp. of thyme. I also put the cheese under the breadcrumbs so that they stay crunchy. I used panko breadcrumbs. Delicious!

I was surprised at how tasty this turned out. My husband wasn't excited when I told him I was making tuna casserole but he ended up loving it. I did make some minor adjustments, as suggested by other reviewers:
*Added 1 finely chopped carrot to the celery + onion mix
*Used 2 cloves of garlic instead of 1. I find that garlic burns easily so I waited until it was time to add the mushrooms before I added the garlic (put it through the garlic press)
*Used a very sharp white cheddar and added an additional 1/4 cup to the sauce
*Covered the top with the sharp shredded cheddar and italian flavored bread crumbs. I skipped mixing the breadcrumbs with butter.
*Added 3-4 tablespoons of fresh chopped dill (it is mild so you can add a lot without overdoing it)
*Added 3 tablespoons of fresh chopped italian parsley
One other note - I used button mushrooms as perscribed by the recipe. Usually I would sub in white mushrooms but I found that the button mushrooms have a distinct flavor and I thought they tasted marvelous in the dish. It would have been very different with white mushrooms. Oh and everything is already cooked so I only had it in the oven for 20 mins until the cheese was melted. If you're on the fence about trying out a tuna casserole cause it seems unappetizing, just go for it.

5 stars! I just made this recipe (the first time I've ever even tasted tuna casserole much less prepared it) and it's amazing!!!!  I used the nutmeg in the roux as I am convinced it's the best "secret" ingredient for white sauces there is!  One other minor change from looking at reviews was to add one cup of chicken broth to 1/2 cup milk and 1/2 cup cream for the sauce.  Otherwise this recipe is amazing!  Hope my hubby likes it when he comes home!  I think he will!

It was pretty good, but not really worth the time it took to prep for a simple casserole. It's just a casserole, nothing gourmet about it. BUT it is definitely tastier than the casserole that isn't from scratch. I put in lots of garlic, used a peas/carrots combo and three cans of tuna. The boys really liked it.

This is really good.  I use frozen baby limas instead of peas, because we prefer them, but otherwise follow this recipe pretty closely, which is unusual for me!  It's a favorite, and really quite easy to do.

My husband says I can make this for him whenever I want.  I doubled the onion, celery, and garlic.  Used baby portabellas instead of button mushrooms and Colby cheese instead of cheddar.  My neighbor doesn't like tuna casserole and she raves about this.  Absolutely the best tuna casserole ever!!!

My family loves tuna casserole and I never use canned soup - so the fresh mushroom rue is familiar to me. I thought I'd try a different recipe just for a slightly new taste. This recipe had a nice flavor (although it needed more breadcrumb and cheese for my family's tastebuds). However time wise, it was not worth the amount of effort. I doubled the recipe as I usually do with casseroles and freeze one for another dinner. My kitchen sink was filled with dishes and the net result was not in line with the amount of prep time - which was long. I know doubling a recipe increases prep time but this one just seemed to take too long - even factoring in the doubling. I hate to thumbs down a recipe but maybe I did something wrong with my timing. Again, the taste was good-  but won't make this again due to the time factor.

This didn't have a whole lot of flavor.  I really like the idea of making the roux from scratch instead of using canned soup, but as written, I found it to be really lacking in flavor...  I initially followed the recipe as is, my pasta was whole wheat, and the flour I used was half white flour and half wheat flour.  I also don't drink milk milk so created the appropriate amount of powdered non-fat milk and when made, it was really bland.  I honestly don't think those substitutions accounted for the COMPLETE lack of flavor though... I had to keep adding and tasting and adding and tasting.  I added about 4 more cloves of minced garlic, grated asiago cheese, salt, pepper, cayenne, nutmeg, lemon juice, heavy whipping cream....premade whipped garlic sauce...I had to just keep adding and adding.  I'd like to say that I am pretty health conscious, eating mostly veggies and grains, so it's not like I was only going to be satisfied with a super salty, fatty and extremely rich dish.  I can appreciate subtlety, I just don't think there is any flavor as written... After all of the additions, I added homemade bread crumbs and grated parmesan on top.  Not sure if I'd go through all of the work again.

This is an excellent recipe.  I made a few changes: (1) half-and-half instead of milk; (2) shredded cheddar and Monterey Jack (that's what I had on hand); (3)  added 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg and 1 tsp. of lemon juice to the sauce.  It turned out really well.  I thought it could have used a bit more sauce, but my husband was happy with it as is. It reheats well, too.  Will definitely be adding this one to my rotation!  

Oh - one last thing.  I used one saute pan for the veggies and the bechamel sauce because I'm lazy.  Worked out fine!

still very good though- just S&P needed- kids liked it.

Real comfort food.  Used Panko crumbs without sauteing in butter, then cheese right over the crumbs.

I loved this before I shifted to a plant based diet, now I make it with a few minor and one major modification! I sub in extra veg: broccoli, edamame, and carrots. I use a eggless pasta like Farfalle. I make the roux using an unsweetened soy (West soy) Earth Balance buttery sticks (yellow box). Top it with the bread crumbs and a lite sprinkle of vegan cheese - just a touch for the saltiness because no cheese sub is as rich and tasty as dairy cheese....yet ;)

My family really enjoyed.  We are not big on a lot of spices, but garlic and onion.  I switched the bread crumbs for the French Fried Onions on top.   This is a great comfort food and great to take leftovers to work the next day for lunch!

Oh thank you for this recipe.  I was able to make this with my lactose free milk and enjoy it with no digestive problems.
It was delicious and I appreciate any recipe that I can use that is lactose free.  can't do those canned soup recipes.

Great base recipe! Definitely worth giving a shot, personally I made some changes of course: 
-used vanilla soy milk (yes, Vanilla!!! Just try it!) And only 1.5 cups not 2,
-added 1/4 cup of flour than what was called for,
- used wheat spiral noodles instead of egg noodles; 2 cups instead of 1
-parmesan cheese instead of cheddar,
-and cheerios blended instead of bread crumbs, preference, I'm just not a fan of them.

Can I just say amazing! Thank you for posting! This recipe also sounds like it would be a great base for chicken pot pie just adding corn kernels and swapping out the tuna and noodles for chicken and pie crusts...

Easy way to omit the canned soup!  I did everything as is (except added Parm cheese, cream cheese, and 1/2 the cheese to the sauce like a review suggested).   The casserole came out tasty - mainly because of the mushrooms. A little bland otherwise and dry. But a good start. Next time going to omit the cream cheese I added (didn't add creaminess like I thought it would), add more pepper, more mushrooms, minced onion, and french fried onions (and breadcrumbs) on top, and use less noodles.

Good recipe. It needed about double the bread crumbs though. I agree with another rater about being able to cut back on the butter in the sauce, and nutmeg probably would have been a nice addition, as well as a sharper cheese like old cheddar, for more flavor without having to add too much salt.

I really liked this recipe. Gave it 4 stars because it is kind of dry and bland. I altered the recipe and doubled the sauce, added chicken bouillon and red pepper flakes. I also kept the mushrooms out since my family aren't fans. I have made this recipe several times already

I tried this wonderful recipe and loved it. I did the same thing that another user did which was put a splash of white wine with the sauteed vegetables. I didn't put on any cheese but added a lot more bread crumbs and it came out delicious. I also used corkscrew noodles instead of egg noodles because I didn't want it to fall apart and it worked beautifully.

I did like this recipe and would make again with a couple of additions parsley, thyme and a little more sauce. Actually I was surprised it was as good as it was. I gave it 4 stars because of the additions I made.

Excellent!
I LOVE tuna casserole but this is much better than the ones using canned soup!!  Much more flavorful when using this sauce recipe and adding your own amount of salt and pepper great recipe!
Suggestion...use the exact same recipe only substitute cooked/baked diced chicken (2 breasts) in place of tuna.  Tastes great either way!

I made a few changes using what I had on hand.  Didn't have celery.  Added a sprinkling of cayenne pepper to mixture and 1 tsp better than chicken bouillon for added flavor.  Did not use butter (used Smart Balance) and cut way down on the amount.  I did not bake it so I just added cheese to mixture and heated until melted.  This was so good.  It was nice to make without canned soup.  Although I made changes I am sure the original recipe would be delicious.  I was trying to make it lower fat.  Thank you.

Excellent. The kids devoured it. I didn't top with cheese when baking but I took it out of the oven and everyone put some fresh asiago on top. I added a can or artichoke hearts to the mushrooms and also reduced the butter.....But overall it's a yummy dish!

My husband and I made this exactly as the recipe stated and both agreed it was the best tuna casserole we've ever had. Might try adding a bit of crushed chilli peppers next time to give it a bit of spice but that's just because we love spicy food. Oh also more cheese doesn't hurt either. ;-)

I made this recipe tonight and thought it was outstanding! I had to do the non-dairy version because of allergies and it was still amazing!!! My husband and son both said they wanted it again -- soon! 

Non-Dairy: Made the rue with non-dairy butter, flour, and low-sodium chicken broth. 

Also, instead of putting bread crumbs on the top, I used Stove Top Stuffing mix because that was all I had. 

IT.WAS.DELICIOUS!!!

Yeah, it's tuna noodle casserole. so five stars? For what it is supposed to be, it's great. True, it took almost every pan in my kitchen, I might stir a little veggie bouillon in the bechamel next time, and I omitted the mushrooms. But other than that... a real winner.

I loved the fact that you don't use canned (high-sodium) soup in this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly except for using macaroni instead of noodles, and lots more garlic (we love our garlic in this house). Prep was easy and quick and the taste of the final result was excellent. Will keep this in the rotation for a quick satisfying (and healthy) meal.

A little dry, otherwise very good!  Just add a little milk and water.

This dish is amazing! I get sick of using canned soup in everything. Even my picky eaters ate everything off their plate. One of them even said they loved it over 10 times. This is becoming a common dinner at my house. Thanks!!

As is, the recipe was only okay.  I would only rate it three stars; however, after making one small change, it really had the flavor I was looking for.  THANK YOU to MVANWINKLE for giving me a wonderful base to start with!  The small change I made was putting something like plain yogurt or keifer in place of the milk; that was all.  It gave it the zing I was looking for.  I now make this for everyone who wants to try "American food."

This is a family favorite in my house! I usually make it without the peas or cheddar cheese (husband request) but add grated parmesan instead. Otherwise I follow the recipe, though last time I read reviews and tried a crushed chicken bullion cube and a bit of nutmeg in the sauce and really liked it so I will continue to do this in the future.

Great!  Delicious comfort food and it was great to avoid all the extra sodium and preservatives from the canned soup.  We made it with lowfat milk and whole wheat flour and it came out just perfect.

I listened to other reviewers and used crackers in lieu of bread crumbs and store cheese into the milk mixture just because it appealed to me. I used unsweetened coconut milk instead of cow's to and this recipe was the bombsies! For those who prefer measurements: 1 tsp seasoned salt; 1/4 tsp pepper worked perfectly for me. I also used 3 cans of albacore tuna (5oz) because it called for 12 oz and I actually meant to split one can in half and forgot. Despite that I didn't find it to be dry at all! I did use a 2.5qt glass casserole dish though. I will undoubtedly make again. My finicky toddler even ate it. I had to remove the peas and obvious tuna chunks from his plate, but he smashed it!

I didn't make any changes to this other than adding a little salt on my serving.  My family thought it was very good.  I am not a fan of tuna casseroles, but this was really good and I will definitely make it again!

This wasn't amazing to me but I'm never the "I love tuna casserole" person...much better than any others I have had however and my husband loved it. I would recommend, like other reviews, making more of the sauce...I made 1.5x the sauce with 8-10 oz of pasta, it filled my 13x9 perfectly...would have been too dry without the extra sauce. I also used 2+ cups of cheese on top since I obviously wasn't cooking this recipe in hopes of a healthy meal :). Will make again when my husband wants tuna casserole. Thanks for the recipe~

This is a great recipe!  It is also great to put in a slow cooker; I mixed up the ingredients and refrigerated it overnight.  The next morning I cooked it on high for and hour and then low for three hours.  It was perfect for my lunch party!

Absolutely delicious and a joy to serve. However, should factor in a wee bit more than 35 minutes to prepare. Easily a 4.5 star recipe.

I grew up hating tuna noodle casserole. After 3 years of my husband pestering me to make it I finally decided to attempt a homemade version that is totally different than my mom's which is made with cream of mushroom soup. We absolutely loved this! I will definitely make it again and again. I did use whole wheat pasta instead of egg noodles, but that was the only change I made.

I cooked the casserole exactly as written. It was very bland with little flavor. It may be better if the sauce was cheese and not white. It may also be more flavorful with mustard added to the sauce.

This was a great recipe. Everyone loved it. It was easy to prepare, a quick dish and deliciously creamy. I gave it 4 stars, because first of all, I didn't really taste the onions, celery and garlic. Next time, I think I'll omit that. Also, I doubled every ingredient except for the tuna. 8 oz. of noodles doesn't make alot.

I really liked this!  I didn't use mushrooms, so I was able to saute the onion, celery, and garlic in the same large skillet that I added the flour to to make the roux.  So that part was all done in one skillet.  Also I used crushed potato chips on top instead of the breading.  Its a keeper!

I made this casserole for my boys for lunch. I did change it a bit because of their different taste. I used corn instead of peas and no mushrooms. They didn't like the celery so next time that's out too.  As for me and my husband we liked it the way it was.  It was quick and easy to make.  A basic white sauce instead of cream of mushroom soup. It's a keeper!!!!

This was a big hit with my 16-month-old son! He gobbled it down, and I didn't mind giving it to him because there was NO canned soup in this recipe! I didn't put the breadcrumbs on top but I did melt the cheese. A great weeknight dinner with lots leftover for lunch tomorrow.

I love this recipe because all the ingredients are fresh, not canned. (Except of course the tuna). I think every cook should know how to make a roue, which is a basic cooking skill. I added some paprika and red pepper to the roue, because I like a little heat.

I was embarrassed with my guests when I made this dish, the measurement for the flour and the butter is completely different than what it actually looks and said during the Video presentation. In the video the demonstrator spread some flour, while she was saying 1/4 cup of flour. The result was a thick cream which turned the pasta into a paste texture.

Best tuna casserole I have ever made. Added a chunk of Velveta cheese and 1/2 cup of cheddar cheese to the sauce along with 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes and 1/2 teaspoon onion salt. Also spread French fried onions over bread crumb topping before laying with cheese. Great recipe!

Great recipie - I really appreciated that no can of mushroom soup was mentioned.   Using all natural ingredients really makes this meal come alive.   I substituted a 14 oz can of Alaskan Salmon (with bones), instead of Tuna (getting overfished).   I shredded my own Tillamook Cheddar, and used a bit more peas.  I did remove all the mushrooms/onions/etc, and set em aside while I blended the milk/butter, then I put everything back together in the skillet, before placing it all in a baking pan.

Did not like the peas or onion in recipe. But without them... it would be even more bland.

I am not much of a Tuna Casserole eater, nor is my family but this sounded like such a Yummy Casserole, so I subbed Baked/Chopped Chicken for the Tuna and added a little Chicken Stock and OMG,, it was such a hit..I did the rest of the recipe just the way it was.. My family just loved and my husband said.. Please add this to your Recipe Book . It sure gets a Thumbs from us...Gail

this recipe is OK...next time I think I will not put the bread crumbs, and probably add a tiny bit more cheese. I think the flavor of the bread crumbs is unnecessary.

This is an excellent base recipe.  
after reading some reviews, I decided to embellish with some seasonings but I didnt alter it much at all and it was delicious.  The husband said it was the best tuna noodle casserole he ever had.
This recipe DOES have enough liquid.  I can only guess that those that complained about liquid probably used too much noodles.  The recipe calls for 8oz. of noodles which is smaller than the average bag of noodles.
Another reason this dish may dry out is because of too large a casserole dish that causes the contents to spread out and therefore be more exposed to evaporation.  Use a 2.5 quart casserole dish and it will fit perfectly!

Made the recipe as called for except used whole wheat egg noodles and a little less butter when sateeing  veggies. We all loved it! Even my picky 4 year old asked if we could have it again tomorrow. Fortunately we have plenty of leftovers!

I am rating this recipe 5 stars because it was a wonderful inspiration for a "from scratch comfort food".  My wife has many food intolerances, gluten, soy, dairy, egg, etc. so I have to make major substitutions for almost every recipe I use.  I offer the substitutions I made to encourage others with similar challenges to try this recipe.  Here is what I changed.  5 Tbs ghee for the butter (1 Tbs to saute vegetables and 4 Tbs for the bechamel sauce) I didn't need it for the baking dish or topping, rice noodles (I used spiral shaped), potato flour instead of all purpose, 1 13.66 oz. can unsweetened coconut milk, 1 to 1 1/2 C rice milk to thin sauce to creamy thick consistency (it is as thick as malt o meal with just the coconut milk), this makes plenty of sauce for those that thought the original recipe was a little dry.  I used 3 cans of tuna based on other reviews, I sprinkled a little dill weed into the sauce along with the salt & pepper, finally I pulsed about a 1/2 C gluten free garlic herb croutons for the topping and omitted the cheese and served it on the side for those who can tolerate dairy.  My wife was over the top thrilled to have a comfort food she could actually enjoy.  You can prepare everything in the same 6 qt. non stick pot if you prep other ingredients while waiting for the water to boil and pasta to cook.  Saute onions and mushrooms together in same pot after draining pasta in colander, add garlic during last minute, set vegetables aside, and begin sauce.

I used this as a foundation for my own version of a "from scratch" recipe. I used a butter flavored cooking spray - gave a hint of that rich butter taste and made serving a breeze.  My goal was to eliminate the mushrooms (can't stand them) while upping the creaminess and flavor.  I added a splash of white wine to the melted butter when I cooked the onion and celery, and skipped the fresh garlic.  Taking the advice of others, I increased the sauce, and it was a perfect balance to the amount of noodles (9 oz).  In making the Bechemel I used what I had on hand (1 cup of light cream and 1.5 cups of skim milk), adding in seasonings (red pepper flakes, thyme, garlic powder, and nutmeg) and some cheesy goodness (1/4 cup each of cream cheese, parmesan cheese, and cheddar cheese).  I added 3 cans of solid white albacore tuna because it seemed too cream heavy.  I used a can of peas (again, what I had on hand) and think the brightness of frozen peas would have been much preferred. I also would add an extra half cup of the peas in the future.  For the topping I crushed up wheat crackers, mixed with the melted butter and added a cup of shredded cheddar.  It fit perfect in a 9x13 pan.  I found it FAR superior to the regular out-of-a-can version, with a much creamier and richer flavor.  Somehow the sauce seemed to cut out that usual fishy smell and taste.  While I loved it, my boyfriend said he could see no difference from the usual.  But he rarely raves about tuna anything.

Surprisingly good. I've never made tuna noodle casserole, but my husband has mentioned how much he liked it in childhood. I cringed at the recipes with canned soups, so when I saw this version in my e-mail, I decided to give it a try. Use really good wild-caught tuna, plus all organic ingredients. Cooked up beautifully and got husband's "excellent" rating.

I always make the recipe as stated the first time.   Now for my changes....  Cut the noodles to at least 5 -6 oz only.  This had way too many noodles for us.  It took all the moisture as well.  But the flavor was there to enjoy.  We will cut the noodles but will try again, it was that good!

This was very easy to make and I was out of my can of celery soup I normally use so the roux was perfect and we do not like mushrooms so left them out. It was a perfect consistency and I am very pleased as is my hubby:) yummy

I liked the basic base of this recipe, but like others have said, it does need some extras! Add chicken stock and also some spices - I added thyme, basil, and marjoram. As well, I just didn't understand the egg noodles - after about only 5 min of cooking, I drained the noodles and found that they were super mushy and stuck together like glue. The texture was yucky. Next time, I will make this dish  without the noodles, and maybe serve with rice on the side instead.

Loved the recipe as did my husband. Did not change much except for using spray for dish.  Worked perfect all though I need more salt to the sauce. Overall great, used panko breadcrumbs which were great and about 1/2 cup of cheese.
Will definitely make again.

Loved this recipe although I did add a little more flour/milk to get a larger quantity of sauce so oven baking didn't dry it out.  I also added green peppers when cooking the veges.  My mom used to make hers with peppers.  Adds to the flavor. I used Ritz crackers for the topping instead of bread crumbs.

too much fat.  Cut the butter in half or more for the roux.  Use a tiny bit of olive oil to sautee veggies.  don't add the bread crumb mixture; the cheese is enough. 
I added brocolli and cauliflower to mine.
I like to add dill or taragon to my tuna casserole.

Had fun and success with a few minor tweaks. Replaced the peas with carrots, used a red onion for flavor and color, doubled the garlic, lots of fresh ground pepper and used a Mexican cheese mix for more flavor. Loved it.

I absolutely loved it. I love tuna casserole and have been looking for a good recipe. I will stick with this one and my kids will call it "moms tuna casserole", I sprinkled a little bacon bits on it a few times for an alternative and omg.

Loved this great old time casserole.  I sprayed the baking dish and added cut up green olives, and a 1/2 C. white wine and pimentos.  Adds just a pop to the over all taste.

I grew up on this!  Every Fri. night, my mother made "Tuna Wiggle" as she called it.  I've tweaked it from time to time by using left over grilled salmon or chicken, but use the same process.  I also use whole wheat noodles.  Another thing my mother would substitute on occasion, (if she didn't want to take the time to make seasoned bread crumbs...yes, she made those from scratch, too, 55 years ago)was crumbled potato chips to sprinkle on top.

Most excellent.  I melted the cheese in the whitesauce and added pimento for taste and color.  Bachelor meals for a week!!!

I thought this was a great base!  I needed something that didn't have dairy, so no can o' !  This was easy to adjust to be dairy free with soy milk and margarine.  I ended up using almost a whole additional cup of soy milk, and really it could have used more.  I added some chopped carrot as well as half a jalapeno.  Then I crushed up these crappy croutons we had on top, it was delish!  Thanks for posting this blue collar gem!

Great! I added 1 cup of Swiss cheese into the sauce plus 1/2 cup of cheddar cheese. Topped with cheddar cheese and parmesan cheese.

My young girls and husband love this. I put a couple cups of cheddar cheese in the sauce and melt it right before mixing it with the noodles and it improved the flavor a TON!! It was a little bland before that.

This is the BEST tuna casserole recipe ever... if your have tuna trauma from your childhood this recipe will redeem your faith in tuna casserole.  My only tips are I think  Parmesan & herb panko crumbs & an Italian cheese blend do it more justice are a far better choice and slice your mushrooms thin.

So tasty.  We added a 1/4t each of dill, black pepper, thyme and parsley to the sauce.  The topping needed more bread crumbs for the amount of butter, to keep it from being too greasy, and we put half the cheese in the sauce before topping with the remaining cheese, THEN the bread crumbs (to get crispier crumbs).

Only thing I'd do different is to put the cheese inside while increasing the bread crumbs/butter mixture and also to turn the oven temp down to 350 degrees.

Loved this recipe! I took the advise of those that have made it before and added the following ingredients:
1 tsp fresh thyme
1/4 tsp nutmeg
1/4 c parmesan cheese
1/3 pkg. cream cheese
splashes of white wine to make the sauce soupy, otherwise it would be too dry.
Try these additions and you will love it too! My husband wants me to make it again.

This was really very good. I had extra cream from some other cooking, so I used 1 cup cream and 1 cup milk. Also, used extra sharp white cheddar as the cheese on top (because it's what I had). Left out the mushrooms. Used rigatoni instead of egg noodles (didn't have egg noodles). I have used this same white sauce over chicken and pasta dishes as well when I have leftover chicken - it's good.

This was a great basic recipe to use.  I doubled the sauce, added to it some nutmeg, salt and pepper, thyme, a bit of smoked paprika and a dash of hot sauce.  Used a mix of parmesan and panko bread crumbs to top it off.

Very very good basic recipe with tweaks. Added 1/2 tsp thyme, 1/4 tsp cayenne, salt and pepper to mushroom mixture (and added finely diced red pepper for color & more veggies). Used only 2 tb butter for roux with 1 cup 2% milk and 1 1/4 cups chicken broth for sauce, then off heat added 1 tb cream cheese and 1/2 cup shredded cheese (I used gruyere, but parmesan or extra sharp cheddar would be good for flavor). Sprinkled crushed butter/garlic croutons on top (no need for extran butter) and a little more cheddar and baked for 25 minutes. We don't like tuna that much, so I only used 1 can...will try again with chicken. Delish!

Thank you for a from scratch recipe! My son loves when I make this. It is part of our meal schedule. Very comforting.
Last time I used cooked chicken instead of tuna and it was great. Versatile and easy to have the ingredients on hand.

Enjoyed this.  Never going back to the campbell's soup recipe.  I tripled the garlic (because we LOVE garlic), added a little cheese to the roux, and used saltines for the top instead of bread crumbs.

This is my go-to for Tuna Noodle Casserole!
I like to add carrots to this too & instead of using 2 C. of milk; I like to use 1C. of half & half, along with 1C. of sour cream. Fattening - yes, but SUPER yum!!! =)

i cut this recipe in half since it was just going to be lunch and dinner for me.. doubled the garlic and celery.. used soy milk for the regular milk.. i'm sure i could have salt and peppered the hell out of this.. but instead i added parmesan cheese and tapatio sauce.. also added a bit of dill and marjoram since I wanted a bit of an herbal flavor.. I like the idea of adding chicken bouillon to the roux.. maybe next time.. didn't bake it with the crumb topping as it's well over 100 degrees today.. i was hoping for more but with my additions i was happy with the dish.. ty for the recipe

I have made this three times, and only alter the recipe if I am missing an ingredient.  True comfort food.  For those that say it is blah, bring out the Sriracha  sauce; just kidding.   Try adding just a tad more salt, even at the table..... salt seems to be the go to flavor enhancer for many professional cooks.  I have to watch my salt intake, and I know this has less salt  than recipes that rely on canned soup.    Served with a salad and whole grain rolls, it is great on a cold winter night.

This tuna noodle turned out awesome, much better than I remember my mother making it. I did make several changes. These were: using slightly more butter than recommended, replacing half the milk with heavy whipping cream, adding a chopped head of broccoli to the vegetable mix, doubling the onion and quadrupling the amount of garlic and celery. I also added some Italian seasoning to the white sauce. It may also be worth mentioning that I used canned white albacore tuna which I find to be much much better than the regular canned tuna. To all the reviewers who say this recipe is too bland I would like to comment that seasoning is to taste and you should taste the sauce while its cooking and season until it is to your liking. Next time I'm going to try using extra sharp aged cheddar which should make it even better!

We love this recipe and have made is many times!  It's our favourite way to eat canned tuna.  I hunted high and low for a tuna noodle casserole that didn't use canned soups or mixes and am so glad I found this recipe!  Since my husband has been diagnosed with a severe gluten sensitivity, I've had switch the flour in the sauce for corn starch, 1:1, and skip the bread crumbs, still with the same great taste!  I've also used canned salmon, but prefer it with the tuna.

Such an easy recipe. I also added chicken broth when making the sauce for flavor and added broccoli for some nutritional value. The sauce came out thick and delicious without using canned soup and it still gave me that heavy, comfort-food dish that I was craving.

Yumm!  I loved that this didn't have cream of mushroom soup in it, as I can't have dairy.  Followed the recipe, but used 1 1/2 C rice milk and omitted the cheese.  The flavor was a little bland, so I added a garlic salt to taste and sprinkled dill on top.  Baked in a 9x13 pan.  Will definitely be adding this to our routine dinner plans!

I fixed this for dinner tonight & was NOT impressed!  It was really BLAH.  It was easy enough to make but used a lot of pans!  If I decide to try it again, I will definitely add some seasonings to the sauce along with some chicken boullion for flavor & probably part of the cheddar.  Sorry, it just didn't pass for me.

Yummy comfort food! The changes I made were no celery, no cheese, and I used a whole onion. I added a heaping cup of peas and had to sub orecchiette pasta as I didn't have egg noodles on hand. Added some TJ's 21 seasoning. Everyone loved it!

Next time would increase garlic to 4, double the bread crumbs(Italian) and butter and eliminate the cheese. I didn't have peas so used finely cut broccoli heads and that was nice.  Also did not have milk so used half and half without a problem.  Nice comfort food probably more in the fall winter months.

Made it gluten free with gluten free flour and corn pasta. Husband liked it very much. It could do with more seasoning.

My children don't like tuna but they willing ate this!  It will be on my menu. I like how easy it is and that it's made from scratch and not a condensed soup.

I love this recipe! Only thing I changed was instead of the the 1 cup of frozen peas, I used mixed organic frozen vegetables. Everything else I kept the same and it was fantastic!

This was super tasty!!  We all liked it better than the recipe I had been making that uses cream of celery soup and mayo.  I didn't use any celery or peas just because I didn't have them on hand, and it was still yummy!  As suggested by another reviewer, I just put all the cheese in the sauce mix...none on top.  And I used crushed up Ritz crackers on top (no melted butter added).  I am sure the recipe as written is fantastic...I was just trying to make it look the same as what I had been making so the kids wouldn't turn their noses up ;)  A definite keeper!

I thought this was pretty good. I cut out a lot of the butter though. I made it with about half. I also added a little cayenne pepper and marjoram to the roux. Will make again.

OMG!!! If you want stick to your ribs comfort food this is the recipe to use. It was very good without the tuna being overpowering. I don't like tuna casseroles but decided to try this and boy I am glad I did. I used the Tuna in the package not in the can.

I found this recipe to be very dry.  Also, for all the pans and pots I had to use to make this, I feel that a shortcut recipe using some canned goods is a better option.

baking it dried it out.  My son called it a dehydrated version of tuna helper.  The flavor was lacking, and it was dry.  I could see the potential in this dish, but as written it needs help.

This is a good recipe, but I have these recommendations:

Spray the pan with cooking spray rather than use more butter.  Use light butter and skim milk.  Also, I chopped up red pepper as well and added a additional clove of garlic and another celery stalk.  I also added some dried parsley to the sauce/veggie mixture.  I mixed some low fat cheddar in with the casserole and put it on top as well.  Overall, pretty tasty.  It is a bit of a mess to make though, and dirties a lot of pans.

Everyone in my house of 2 adults and 3 kids loved this recipe.  I loved that it didn't use any "cream of" soup with the MSG that is included in them.  The one thing I would change is substitute broccoli for peas.  I thought the peas made it too sweet tasting.  Broccoli would work just as well and not give it a sweet taste. Otherwise, a GREAT dish.

This was by far the BEST Tuna Casserole I have ever made. It got rave reviews from friends and family.  I sprayed the dish with Pam instead of buttering it. I also tripled the breadcrumb topping. Awesome recipe. Will definitely make this again.

So, so good and SO MUCH BETTER than those nasty recipes that used canned soup!  Slightly more effort but well worth it.  I followed recipe exactly with the exception of the breadcrumb topping as I felt it was not needed.  Can't wait for my leftovers at lunchtime today!

I thought it was alot better than the ones with canned soup, but I am still searching for a great recipe.  My husband loves tuna noodle, and I just can't seem to find an outstanding recipe.  It was bland, I would like a little more flavor.

My finance' thought it was great. I followed some suggestions. I used 1/2 cup of vegetable broth, 1/2 t. thyme, used spray to coat the pan and less flour. It still seemed very dry and bland to me. Next time, I'll used more concentrated broth and more milk. I think the noodles absorbed too much liquid. I'm going to keep trying.

Great recipe, came together pretty easy.  Next time I will double the mushrooms, add extra tuna and decrease the pasta by 1/4 to try (try) to make a little more carb friendly.

This was really good and worth the extra work. I omitted the mushrooms since we have an allergy in the house and just used a little extra butter to cook the onions and garlic in. I also used 8 oz of Monterey Jack cheese since my husband isn't a fan of cheddar. I mixed about half the cheese in with the tuna mixture and then sprinkled the rest on top. We liked it, but felt that it could be kicked up a notch so we added creole seasoning (next time I'll put it in the mix and omit salt).

As recipe is written, 3.5 stars so I bumped it up to 4.  With additional spices and a little more sauce (bit dry), it has the potential to be 5 star recipe.  I've added thyme & marjoram and felt it could use a dash more of something.  I love that this recipe doesn't include canned soup (with all those processed ingredients) and is economical so I'll keep tweaking it to make it perfect for our taste buds.  I've made without the crumb topping and didn't miss it.  I also save a pan to clean by just pushing mushroom mixture to side of pan, add butter/flour, whisk in milk, and then eventually mix all together.

This was great, everyone enjoyed it. It could have had a bit more sauce, but I also added carrots which might have caused it to not be as creamy. Yum.

I made the following changes per others reviews and my own tastes: sprayed the pan with Pam to cut down on butter, used whole wheat rotini noodles, increased or added the following ingredients to: 1 onion, 2 stalks celery, 3 cloves garlic, 4 cans tuna, 2 cups peas, 1 cup cheddar added to the casserole (another cup reserved for the top), 1/4 c parmesan, 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp marjoram, 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, and a dash of cayenne.  The butter-bread crumb mixture can be omitted, as it doesn't crisp up much due to the cheese on top (plus less butter this way).  I like the idea of fried onions for a crunch instead but haven't tried it.

Very good, but my first one turned out a little dry and bland. We mixed in some sour cream and it really jazzed up the taste.

I tried this recipe recently and generally we liked it! I thought it was a little bland so next time I'm going to add a splash of hot sauce. I'll be making this again though!

My family really enjoyed this, even the daughter who doesn't like tuna. It's nice to have a recipe for this casseole that doesn't use condensed soup for the sauce! Will make again

I went to all that work, it took me almost an hour of prep, and I didn't care for the flavor, or lack of, or the texture. Next!

This is a great recipe. I used 1 1/2 cup fat free milk and 1/2 cup cream (that's all I had left :) and mixed some of the shredded cheese in with the sauce and it came out great. Hubby isn't a big mushrrom fan so I just added more celery. Also to add flavor when sauteing the garlic and celery I added a splash of sherry and it gave it a kick. I had no problem with flavor in this recipe.

This was pretty tasty! I didn't think it tasted much different than the canned soup recipe but if it's from scratch I prefer it. I used fried onions instead of bread crumbs because in my opinion they make the dish. I also used 2 big cans of tuna, and about 2-3 cloves of garlic instead of garlic powder. Yum!

I made this last night for dinner and it turned out wonderful!! My family loved it. They're not big tuna fans but everyone ate 2-3 servings and there was no left overs!! I love the everything was made from scratch and that I didn't have to buy a can of "cream of whatever". The flavor was great. I did follow the other reviews with using potato chips instead of bread crumbs. I also added more cheese into the sauce like the others suggested. Yumm...it was great and I will be making it again! Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.

Let me start by saying that Ive never had tuna noodle casserole before... I grew up in a family of casserole haters, especially tuna!  I loved it!  I can honestly say that if it had a can of soup in it, Im sure I would have felt differently.  My husband enjoyed it as well as our 3 year old.  I will be making this again.

This was the quintessential Tuna Noodle Casserole.  Basically you are making your own cream of mushroom soup for your recipe which takes the dish to a whole new level without compromising the authenticity of this Americana classic.    I used a little cream with the milk because I could not resist.  I put the cup of cheese in the mixture instead of on top.  I made my bread crumbs by shredding three pieces of bread (3 tablespoons did not seem like enough) in the food processor.  I baked them at 350 on a cookie sheet until they were brown.  I put garlic powder and salt on them and then tossed them with the butter.  It was rich, creamy and delicious.

I enjoyed this as did my whole picky family.  When I asked them if I should make that they kind of gave me that "eeeeuuu" look.  Well I didn't tell them prior and they all loved it.  Didn't change much either except that I added a bit more cheese.  I think I'll make it this week!

next time I am not going to drain the tuna. It is not neccessary because the recipe needs a little more liquid if you do not want it to be kind of dry, and it will add flavor.  This is an excellent base, as you cand dress it up as you wish.

Ok, I am a pretty experienced cook but this recipe was confusing. It calls for uncooked egg noodles, but you are supposed to cook them before putting them in the casserole. I did not realize this until after I had stirred all the ingredients together. I had to pick them all out and cook them. After doing that I used frozen peas and carrots that I had on hand a can of mushrooms and some cheese. I topped it with bread crumbs and it was pretty good. At least better than that prepackaged stuff. I did not add the salt since I felt the tuna and other canned products had enough.

I believe that canned cream soups are the root of all evil, so this was a real find.  I have made this twice now, once with tuna and once subbing shredded cooked chicken.  I skip cooking the noodles beforehand and add 1 cup of chicken stock to the white sauce (it will be runny) and cooking covered with foil in the oven until noodles are done, about 40 minutes.  It saves time and a pan.  Left out mushrooms, cheese, and used mixed veggies instead.  Yum.

This was absolutely delicious! I took the advice of another person and added nutmeg, thyme, and crushed red pepper and it had a wonderful spicy kick. I also added cream cheese, parmesan cheese, and cheddar cheese to the sauce and it was so yummy and creamy. Definitely a keeper!

I left out the peas when making this and used Ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs for the topping.  It was okay, but seemed like it lacked something.  I'm not sure the payoff was worth the extra work, so I'll probably try a different recipe next time.

I don't really like tuna as a general rule, but this turned out really well for me. I think any frozen veg would do, I used french style green beans with a lot of success. Next time I may try to substitute salmon for the tuna?

Pretty good for a tuna casserole.  I loved not using canned soup!  My sauce turned out a little thin for my tastes, (maybe I'm just used to the can).  I may toy with that, but the bottom line is that the family enjoyed it, and it will most likely end up on our table again.
**update** I've made this several times now, and my family loves it.  I think  I may have been hasty about the sauce the first time. My adult kids have all asked for this recipe, and I'm very happy with it.

A little bland as is, but a great base to start with. I took the leftovers and added more milk,sour cream, and seasoning to give it more flavor and make it creamier.

This was a delicious dinner. I made a few modifications. I scaled it to three servings, except that I used two cans of solid white Albacore tuna, chopped coarsely. The result was four generous servings. I used the pasta from a box of Macaroni & Cheese instead of the egg noodles, and the package of powdered cheese from the package instead of the shredded Cheddar cheese. Also, I had two tomatoes that we had put in the freezer because they were over ripe. I peeled them, then chopped them up. and added to the celery, onion, garlic, mushroom mixture after it was cooked, then continued to cook until most of the liquid had disappeared. Also, I just used ordinary chopped fresh white mushrooms,

This recipe has a lot of potential; however I found it way too dry after baking.  It definitely could use more of a "kick" as far as seasoning go but the ingredients are right on.  Think I'll try adding more seasonings and milk (or cream) next time so it turns out creamier and tastier.

My sweetie made this for dinner tonight, he basically followed recipe, he added a dash of this and that until it tasted right.  When I initially started eating it I didn't like it at all, it was fishy and bland.  My sweetie thought so too, so he ran to the fridge to find something to make it better, he came back with cottage cheese, spread a dolop on top of each of our plates and....viola - it was delicious!

This was an excellent recipe.  I added one carrot to give it more color.  Also, because my kids don't like mushrooms and I do, I went ahead and added a can of cr of mushroom soup and cut the milk to 1 1/2 cups.  I know this goes against the "scratch" concept, but it worked really well.  I was able to have my mushroom flavor and they didn't know it.  Enjoy!!

This is a great comfort food meal!  We made it even better with a secret ingredient - we mixed in 2 tbps of sherry to the sauce before adding it to the noodles and other ingredients.  The sherry gives it an awesome smell, and really rounds out the flavors.  It was a delicious meal for a cold fall evening!

This was very good!  I modified it to make it more healthy and it was STILL  creamy and flavorful.  I subsituted skim milk,  Promise butter and Cabot 50% fat free cheddar cheese for the listed ingredients. I also used whole wheat egg noodles intead. I was worried about using these but I think they turned out to be the better option actually. They held up better in the sauce without altering the flavor at all... be sure to cook them only until they're al dente. Thanks for the recipe ... it had everything I wanted in a tuna casserole!

This is a wonderfully easy family/week night recipe.  I made the roux in the pan with the onions & mushrooms...it saved me from one more dirty dish.  Next time I will try cream cheese and wine instead of milk for a little more flavor and some kettle chips on top.  Definitely a keeper for our family from ages 1 to 36!

We made this recipe last night and it was my first tuna casserole ever (I know I was deprived as a child). My husband has had tuna casserole with the typical mushroom canned soup all of his life, and he said this one is sooo much better. First I reccomend you read the review from ZP111 she offered great advice for the sauce (add cream cheese, wine to veggies and parmesean cheese). For an authentic twist that isn't too fattening we suggest you add Kettle baked salt and vinegar chips to the top instead of breadcrumbs. It made this dish go from okay to AMAZING. The salt and vinegar baked chips were a nice addition to the tuna fish in the dish. Also, don't be scared to mix fish for this. We had one can of tuna and one of salmon. I mixed them and it was great (probably a little healthier too). This is a keeper!

I loved this recipe:) I have 4 children and they all had seconds!! I didn't have mushrooms, celery, egg noodles or bread crumbs so I used saltines with no butter and I used medium shells. This is my new tuna casserole recipe!!!! Thanks mvanwinkle:P

Even though the recipe doesn't require canned soup, it's still pretty easy.  Forgot to buy mushrooms and didn't miss them.  I used margarine to lower fat and added 1/2 cup cheese to sauce.  YUM!  No wonder it's the best rated tuna noodle on here!

Absolutely delicious and well worth the extra work compared to my normal soup-based recipe! Used olive oil to saute the onion/celery/garlic, 1 c. chicken broth/1 c. milk and only 2 tbsp butter for the flour mixture.  Definitely a keeper!

I'm in search for the perfect tuna casserole and this one is pretty close.  Made a couple little changes to add flavor: 1. used 1 cup milk and 1 cup sour cream (instead of the 2 cups milk) 2. added a package of italian dressing seasoning packet to the milk mixture 3. 1/2 tsp. salt and 1/4 tsp. pepper  I would still like to see a "crunchier" top ... not crazy about using potato chips ... open to suggestions?  The bread crumbs/cheese tastes good, but doesn't add a crunchy ending ...

My family isn't big on tuna, so this was a risk.  I called it "Mystery Hotdish" so that no one would turn their nose up at the mention of tuna. :)  It went over very well! I did not add the celery or peas. Served a veggie on the side instead.  Also used a small can of mushrooms instead of fresh, as I had them on hand. Used cavatappi pasta instead of egg noodles. My favorite part was the cheesy breadcrumbs on top!

Liked this very much, but needs more milk or less noodles.  I also added chopped carrots and french fried onions on top.  My husband loved it.

I also thought it was pretty bland as written. ANd a bit dry too. Next time I will add a bunch more spices and either reduce the pasta or double the sauce.

It's an okay recipe, not terrible. But it's very bland if you don't add any seasonings to the sauce. I added some Old Bay seasoning, and it was okay. There was still something missing to balance out the flavors.

Pretty good recipe. Rather bland though. Instead of bread crumbs, I crushed up Ritz crackers and added them to melted butter and sprinkled it over top before putting it in for baking. I also added dollops of cream cheese on top. I felt there was more flavor in the cheesy crust topping than there was in the whole casserole.

Very nice! For those of you who want more flavor over all, try adding a bit of cayenne pepper to taste while you make the roux. Go easy at first with the cayenne because it only "gets happy" after it has married with the other sauce ingredients. It gives it a bit more spunk.

Very good, just need a little extra seasoning and bit more cheese and the family loved it.  I also added crushed saltine crackers to the top with melted butter and this gives it a little crunch.

The best tuna noodle casserole recipe ever.  I did cut out the onions and celery and added some carrots instead.  Also added some oregano and basil inside and topped it with Parmesan mixed with the bread crumbs to give it a more Italian feel.  I would recommend doubling the bread crumb recipe, one of the best parts!

We enjoyed this! I try to avoid using cream of...soup whenever I can. I used bow tie pasta instead of egg noodles. I also added extra celery and the whole onion. I had white wine in the fridge so I put a splash of it in when sauteing the veggies. I also put 1/2 cup shredded cheddar in the sauce. I'll be making this again!

It was very dry and I had to add lots of spices to make it flavorful. Next time I'll double the sauce.

4 stars because of necessary additions for flavor.  I added dill, extra salt and pepper, a dissolved boullion cube, cream cheese, paremesan, doubled the garlic, and added a small amount of lemon flavored cooking wine to sautee the veggies. I added cheddar to the cream mixture and added extra cheddar to the top and topped it with french fried onions. This was good and my family LOVED it. I felt, however, that it still needed some additional pep in the cream sauce.  I didn't season the veggies so maybe doing that would help. I also will try different spices next time.  Overall, very good and a dinner to look forward to.

I made this for dinner tonight.  My husband and sons all enjoyed it as is.  I will make this again but will tweak it, as many other reviewers have. White wine added to the sauteed veggies, chicken broth to the roux, more garlic and any number of fresh herbs to perk up the flavor. It's a good basic recipe with lots of room for experimentation! Thank you!

This was really fantastic, though it took longer to put together than I anticipated. I would add A LOT more pepper into the white sauce. Other than that, it was a big hit and reheats well. Thanks!

I fried the onions/mushrooms/celery in olive oil instead of butter, and tripled the garlic.  Used whole wheat pasta spirals instead of egg noodles and whole wheat flower.  Also I used soy milk instead of milk.  Even if you don't like those substitutions (though they tasted awesome) I would definitely recommend adding more spices than as written. I added oregano and spicey paprika and more black pepper than the recipe called for.   I also used more cheese than it called for and used the canned, crunchy fried onions instead of bread crumbs.

For tuna casserole this was pretty good.  I added canned chicken instead of tuna because we're not tuna fans.  I also doubled the sauce, and added Mccormicks powdered poultry gravy mix to the milk mixture for flavor.  I also used Ritz crackers instead of breadcrumbs.  Will make again.  Thanks!

This is a excellent recipe, and it's quite adaptable. My family loves it, even though I rarely make it the same way every time. For instance, sometimes I use shell or elbow pasta instead of noodles, sometimes I add frozen peas and carrots instead of just peas, sometimes I substitute green beans for the peas, sometimes I use shredded zucchini and carrots (fresh), sometimes I include roasted bell pepper, sometimes I use 1/2 cream cheese and 1/2 American or Velveeta, etc. I ALWAYS include the onion (sometimes I use scallions/spring onions), celery, garlic and mushrooms, though. Not moist enough for you (especially the next day)? Often I add 1/2 pint of halved Grape tomatoes but adding 1 vegetable buillion cube to 1/2 cup of water while preparing the cream sauce has been known to work well for me.

I didn't really care for this. I followed the recipe as stated. It wasn't really bad, but really didn' have much taste either. I liked the idea of the recipe not having the soups, but the flavor was lacking.

Great! I followed the lower fat option recommended by rater and this was great! Used baby bella mushrooms and was short of cheddar so added the 1/4 c I had to the sauce.  Very tasty, not heavy! Will make again. Thanks!

I was great, I did make a few adjustments. I added an extra can of tuna, doubled the amount of sauce, and added a chicken bullion cube to give a little more flavor. I dont think that 3 tbls was enough bread crumbs, next time I make this I will be putting a lot more!  Great dish, thanks!

I gave this four stars instead of five because I decided it needed a few adjustments for my household.  I didn't use the cheese on top, we all love cheese here, just not in our tuna casserole.  I also simply crushed up Saltines instead of using bread crumbs and melted butter.  I tried this recipe the original way first, with the bread crumbs, and just didn't care for the taste.  I also increased the amount of veggies used, I really like veggies in my casseroles.  After making this a second time, I decided that oven baking this dish isn't for me.  I realize a casserole is traditionally an oven dish, but I actually grew up eating stove top tuna casserole, so for me that's what's normal :)  This is actually a great and easy stove top recipe but doesn't really make enough sauce for oven baking.

5/14/2019 - made a half batch without the mushrooms (fiancé doesn't like them) and a mix of mozzarella and cheddar cheeses (what I had in the fridge) and added a dash or two of dill.  Threw in some leftover carrots instead of peas - very good, made from scratch (no "cream of" soups) and a great meal!
2/2/2009 - This was good as-written but I felt it needed "something".  Next time I may add some more seasonings as other reviewers have suggested, plus add some chicken boullion.  I felt the amount of sauce was good, it was not dry at all!  Great leftovers!

Husband really enjoyed it.  I added quite a bit of coarse black pepper and quite a bit of kosher salt, both to the sauce and on top. I used enough cheese to cover the top.  Some other reviews said it was bland but not with these changes.

My family really loved this. Only thing different was that I did not have mushrooms so I left those out, and I did not have egg noodles so I used pasta sea shells. Turned out really good! I love recipes that are completely from scratch instead condensed soupas a crutch. Thanks for this great recipe.

This was fantastic.  Unfortunatly, I didn't have any fresh mushrooms, celery, or onions, so subst onion salt, celery salt, and garlic salt.  It was still great.  I'm sure with the fresh veggies it would be even better.

I'll definitely make it again.

This is the only tuna noodle casserole that I will be making from now on! It was FULL of flavor and there were no leftovers! I read other reviews and made the following modifications: I sprayed olive oil in the baking pan instead of butter.  Sauteed the onions, celery, garlic, and then mushrooms in olive oil instead of butter.  Use more garlic for awesome flavor (5 cloves), and I added a small amount of Adobo seasoning to the mixture.  For the roux, instead I used whole wheat flour and added a few shakes of Adobo seasoning (found in the Mexican food aisle).  This is a great seasoning.  Also add a few shakes of Thyme seasoning (this is awesome in the casserole).  Then when the casserole is done, I sprinkled "Trader Joe's Fried Onion Pieces" on the casserole.  It is delicious this way and total comfort food.  Served with sauteed green beans.

I was in the mood for tuna noodle, knowing most call for canned soups (which I don't use) and was pleased to find this.  No real fans of tuna noodle in my family of six, but they didn't complain.  I added a little sour cream to the mix, eliminated the peas and mushrooms, mixed the shredded cheddar in with the other ingredients and added crushed potatoe chips on top (how my mom topped hers 40 years ago)...Was a little bland, I will add more salt and probably some garlic next time...great winter comfort food...am having the leftovers for dinner tonight.

Not sure this needs one more review but here it is -- loved it! I've come to the conclusion that tuna noodle casserole has to be made from scratch. I used to think I just didn't like it until I tried this recipe on a whim (because my husband likes it and I was trying to be nice to him). Here, finally, is a recipe I can make for him regularly.

I loved it. My family loved it. And the best thing...no MSG. I am highly sensitive and keep looking for ways to cook from scratch. I used my own chicken stock (from scratch instead of anything granule or canned) and soda crackers. Next time, I'll throw in what ever veggies are left over.

This was sooo yummy! We couldn't stop eating this. The only thing I did differently is to omit mushrooms (as I had none) and substitute green and red bell peppers. I did add a little more milk, also.

This recipe has some promise.  I liked the home made cream base, as opposed to the typical canned soup, however, we felt it lacked flavor.  If I make this again, I will add more herbs.  As listed, we felt the recipe flavor was rather boring.

This was fantastic!  We only used 3 cans of tuna instead of 4 in a double batch.  My kids had 3 helpings each and asked for the leftovers for breakfast!  A definate "do again".  My husband asked me to try making it once with chicken too.

This was a great casserole!  I was surprised at how easy it was to make from scratch.  One suggestion is to sautee the mushrooms in the butter first before adding celery & onions.  They'll absorb some butter and taste wonderful.  Hubby & I were both ver impressed and we'll certainly be making this again.

I enjoyed making this, I didn't have tuna but had canned all-white chicken from Costco, it worked great!  I plan to make it with tuna next time because the hubby likes a good tuna casserole.  For those that shy away from making a white sauce from scratch, you can use the packaged ones by Schilling, etc.  This was quick comfort food at its' best.

I lost the recipe I usually used and was shocked that there are so many 'easy' Tuna Noodle Casserole recipes with canned soups. Tuna Noodle Casserole just isn't the same unless it's made from scratch! To make this a little healthier: use whole wheat egg noodles (you wont notice much, if any, difference), saute the onion/celery/garlic in about a tablespoon of olive oil, decrease butter/flour in roux to 3 tablespoons (2 cups of milk is still fine), spray the pan with non-stick cooking spray instead of butter. This is one meal that my husband and three kids will eat without balking. :)

I've always made tuna casserole by simply making mac and cheese and throw in the tuna... this is definitely a keeper. I used penne pasta and used the lower fat suggestion from the other user (LF evaporated milk + LF milk).  I also had rue already made and ready to use, so I used that to thicken my sauce (Major time savor) My preschooler also like it.... and this is the pickest preschooler I know. Next time, I'll add a little more liquid to this. Seemed that it was a little dry and that the pasta soaked up all the liquid.

I have made this casserole several times for my daughter.  She always feels so loved when I prepare it.  Prep time is a little long but worth the memory it creates.   Sometimes I use evaporated milk or mix the milk with half & half and I always add more milk to the final mix to make it creamier.  I only use mushrooms, onions and celery.  It leaves a crisp, simple tuna flavor.

Made this tonight for the first time and what a hit!!!  I probably went overboard on the bread crumbs and cheese, but it was absolutely yummy!  Am looking forward to leftovers.

This tuna casserole was delicious!  I added 1/2 tsp. of garlic powder, 2 minced garlic cloves, 1/2 tsp cracked black pepper, and 1 to 1 1/2 tsp of kosher salt. I also used whole milk. For the bread crumb topping, I used extra sharp cheddar cheese. This recipe takes more time to make but it's well worth it. It's better than using the recipes that use canned cream of mushroom soup.

Not bad.  I like that it is all fresh ingredients rather than canned soups.  My husband can't stand warm tuna so I won't make this on a regular basis but my kids seemed to really enjoy it so I'll keep it in mind for nights that hubby is away.  The only change I made was I used whole wheat noodles.  Thanks for an easy recipe for a nice, quick, fairly healthy dinner option!

This was a nice change from the recipe I've always used.  I thought it was a bit dry and would have liked a little bit more sauce.  I used frozen peas and thought they overwhelmed the taste a bit, and will use a smaller amount next time.

Very good, but honestly it didn't taste much different than my old standby which uses canned soups.  Not enough difference to go to the extra work to make this one again, but great for those who are looking for a decent recipe.

I'd give this recipe a 5-star rating for taste, if it were a little more healthy and didn't use so many dishes to prepare it.  The clean-up factor figures pretty high in our family!

This was great....hubby isn't a big fan of the canned soups so this was perfect.  My son and I normally don't like tuna but we both liked this.  I did use crushed onion/garlic croutons for the topping instead of bread crumbs and added some cooked carrots (hubby's request).  Very good, this will be a regular!  Thanks for the recipe!!

this recipe is awesome. i haven't made a casserole with a can of anything since i discovered this. Very versatile too. Use any veggies on hand that need to be used up. I like to add some garlic cheese powder to the breadcrumbs to give it umph.A keeper. I have also used this base for a green bean casserole, minus noodles, and it was tasty.

Like others have mentioned, this recipe is pretty time consuming.  It takes me less time to make a lasanga from scratch!  The texture was really good, but it tasted too fishy to me. It might have been better if I took someone's suggestion of baking it in a 9x13 pan with more topping.  The topping was very good.  I don't think I'll be making this again.
