I was desperate for something quick for a brunch!!  I choose this recipe because everything I needed was already in my fridge or the spice cabinet.  Able to get it in the oven before guests arrive. IT WAS A HIT!  Even my two year old ate it (he never eats eggs).

When I was searching for this recipe, I was really looking for an "idea" that I could expand upon, using the ingredients I had.  This worked great. The changes I made were:
1.  I used individual ramekins so each brunch guest had his/her own dish.
2.  I put some cubed leftover garlic bread in the bottom of each dish.
3.  After pouring in the eggs, I added a small handful of canned mushrooms.
4.  I baked them in a 350 oven, and then broiled them to finish with a nice brown top.
Everyone loved them.  I think the combination of the eggs and the evaporated milk worked really well.
Next time I will try some onions in it.

This recipe was OK.  It didn't have much flavor.  I tried it a second time and added bacon,onions and a little hot german sausage for some extra flavor.  The amout I used varied to suit the taste buds!  It was pretty good the second time around!  :)

VERY easy and a big hit! I had to use moz. cheese instead of the cheddar and it made it nice and mellow. I also reduced the number of egg yolks by half and it still turned out great.

i am not an egg eater but these are very good, and even though I can cook eggs however the family wants them they have asked for these the last few times.  I am making them again today and will take the suggestion of adding the bacon and mushrooms to them.  Thanks for an easy recipe the whole family enjoys.

This was great. I threw in some mushrooms because they were on sale; otherwise made as stated.

I like making this dish when it is my turn to provide refreshments at our Thursday morning mom's group or for a potluck brunches.  It is easy to throw together in the morning and take along.  My friends who are trying to avoid carbs love that this recipe does not include bread which many breakfast casseroles do.  For more flavor I sautee one onion and add it along with a drained can of mushrooms to the egg mixture.

This was pretty good.  I cut the recipe in half and substituted 1/2 T liquid mustard for the 1/2 t dry mustard since i didn't have the dry on hand.  I put it in a smaller pan and only cooked it for about 25 minutes.  My kids gobbled it up and even my picky 2 yr old asked for 4ths!  I might try sneaking in a veggie or even a little quinoa next time.  That's what's fun about this recipe-you can play around with it.  I'll be adding it into my breakfast meal rotation.  Thanks!

Quick and easy!  Love it!  Something you can easily whip up and serve with a salad or add more veggies to if you like it more complex.

I used sliced provolone cheese instead of grated cheese. Instead of greasing the pan, I baked some bacon in the dripper pan before I added the egg mixture. Because this was going to be supper & I have some hearty eaters, I decided to layer bread in the bottom of the pan. Other than that, I made it as written. They loved it & it is a "have again."

Most of my family really liked this recipe, with the exception of one child who has very limited taste mostly PB & J.  This recipe is very flexible you could add any thing you like in your eggs and really play with flavors.  It also cuts very nicely and you could cut it with cookie cutters to serve children or cut it with a biscuit cutter and have a perfect round on a breakfast sandwich.  This I will keep and have fun playing with.  Good recipe.

I made this for a family brunch and it was a big hit.  Incredibly easy, and comes easily out of the pan in neat squares.  Perfect for easy entertaining!

Not bad.  I didn't have milk in the fridge, so it was a big help when I wanted to make eggs for breakfast sandwiches.  (I make them and freeze them for breakfast at work).  I left out the cheese since I had cheese slices for the sandwiches, and I added red pepper and parsley to this.  I baked at 350, not 325, and it still took 40-45 minutes, not 30.  This is a good way to bake eggs, regardless.  Thanks for the recipe!

I don't know what went wrong.  Followed recipe, except used lowfat milk.  Maybe the eggs were old.  It was very spongy, dry and tough.  Maybe I'll try it again with evap milk and fresher eggs.  Mine was done at 35 minutes.  I will revise this if it turns out better next time!  2nd review:  Made it again with fresh eggs and it was better.  Also, I read that beating eggs too much makes them dry - I had beat them too much with an egg beater.  Pretty good, but still not my favorite recipe.

This is a good foundation for adding on-hand ingredients.  I added spicy chicken sausage, onions and tomato, and it was still a little bland.  I think I'd add something to give it a little kick, like some green chiles.  Overall an easy and good casserole.

I had leftover evaporated milk from another recipe, looked to see what was available for evaporated milk and found this. It is very good.....nothing fancy, but good. I added mushrooms, chopped green onions, fresh parsley and cubed colby cheese because its what I had on hand. Fluffs up very high and falls quickly. Good texture though.

Used heavy cream instead of evaporated milk. This was easy to prepare but thought it was lacking greatly in flavor, even though I added additional cheese and mushrooms. Maybe use this as a starting point.

5 stars for ease in making!!  I had evaporated milk I wanted to use up and found this quick and simple recipe.  We weren't expecting a flavor explosion (there aren't that many ingredients ;-) so it was about what we expected.  I added some diced onions and fresh rosemary (just because I had them) but I don't think they changed the end result significantly.  I'd make this again.

This recipe saved my brunch! I had no idea what to prepare for our guests and this recipe provided an easy and delicious dish. After reading the reviews, I added diced ham and green pepper. Wow! I look forward to making this dish in so many different ways. Thank you so much.

I do like this recipe, but I prefer it with some additional ingredients. I would cut up 2 medium baked potatoes (peeled) and line the pan with them. I would also add cooked and crumbled bacon or diced ham and mushrooms. Very easy recipe and good with or without additions!!!

This was so easy and taste great.  Took to work and it got rave reviews.  Would be very easy to customize by adding veggies or meat.

Recipe was very easy and quick, but extremely bland and tasteless. I would not make this again.

So easy and delicious! I added precooked sausage links and frozen veggies (red, green, orange and yellow bell peppers with onion). I cut everything in small pieces and just added it frozen! We’re going to put some salsa on top too!

Ugh.  1st problem:  recipe calls for evaporated milk.  The ingredients should specify UNSWEETENED.  I grabbed my evap. milk from my pantry which happened to be sweetened, but I didn't take any notice of that at the time.  What I got was a little sweet and a lot of bland egg.  
2nd problem:  This came out like a spongy baked good.   The taste and texture were very confusing.  
3rd problem:  The main picture shows  red peppers, and the picture that shows up with the ingredients has bacon and green peppers but there is no mention of these ingredients in the list.   
Verdict:  I chose this recipe because it didn't require preparing the night before as many breakfast baked egg casseroles do.  There are  p-l-e-n-t-y  of other egg recipes on allrecipes.com.  Try one of those instead!

I made this for Easter brunch and it was delicious!  I made no changes and it felt it just was perfect.  It was like having scrambled eggs with cheese but without the hassle of cooking while guests are waiting.  I assembled it ahead of time and just popped it into the oven as people arrived.  You could vary it with additions like veggies etc. but there are lots of other recipes out three for that.  I liked that this was simply eggs with cheese.  It was a hit with everyone, youngest to oldest.

I loved this recipe...I brought it to my daughter's for New Year's Day brunch and it was a huge success.  I did make a few changes the second time I made it:  I finely chopped onions and red bell pepper and sautéed them in bit of butter to partially cook them and added them to the egg mixture prior to pouring on the cheese. I substituted Mexican Blend shredded cheese and since I did not have dry mustard, I did use regular yellow mustard instead.  This was an egg dish with a little "kick" - this is definitely a recipe you can play with!

We loved it! I added a 6 oz jar of mushrooms drained and a 5 oz jar of pimentos sprinkled across the top. Sprinkled just a tad of red pepper on top. My husband really enjoyed this, I think next time I will add a little chopped green onion. Saved it in my menu for next time. Happy cooking!!
