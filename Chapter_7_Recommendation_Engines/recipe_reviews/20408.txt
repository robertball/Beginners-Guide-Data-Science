I think next time I will add some celery for some extra crunch.  Also, it helps to salt and pepper.

The taste was really good - I used spicy deli style mustard instead (just my taste). I liked this because it didn't use a lot of mayo (blah!) I only gave it four stars because the egg boiling method did not work. Eggs came out runny and I didn't have time to make more, so I had to omit them from the recipe. bummer. Other than that, was very tasty. Thanks!

With the addition of  2 tsp of  white and 1/2 cup of mustard a group of Baptist church goers have not stopped raving.

Tried this out on guests during a cookout and it vanished.  They loved it and so did I.  It needed a little green so I chopped an equal amount of bell pepper and pimientos.  Excellent!
