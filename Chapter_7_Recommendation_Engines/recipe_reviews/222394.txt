I'd give this 10 stars if I could! Throughout the whole dinner, hubby and I couldn't stop saying how much we loved this! The Herbes de Provence and pistachios totally make the dish! What an amazing combo of flavors. Few ingredients, but packed with flavor.  It tastes like it's from a fancy restaurant. The cooking time is spot on. I pulled it out right at 25 mins and it was a perfect medium-rare to medium.  Thank you Chef John! You really created a masterpiece which made for a perfect New Year's Day dinner!  I can't wait to make this for guests.

This was one of the best dishes I've ever made.  I totally forgot the Herbes de 
Provence mixture before browning.  Served with mustard potatoes.  Was told this meal was as good as any restaurant meal.  Thank you!

Just made this dish for the family's New Year's Eve dinner. It was very delicious! This was the 2nd lamb dish from Chef John that I followed, and I have to say I prefer this more. The mustard and pistachio crust gave a nice crunch but it was still pretty subtle so that my taste buds paid the most attention to the meat. I didn't find Herbs de Provence so I just seared the meat with salt and pepper and used leftover Italian bread crumbs with the pistachios. Maybe a little lavender from HdP might have made this even better, but I was pretty happy as is. I got the racks at Costco and they were tender, juicy...yum! I bought 6 racks for 7 adults & 2 kids...and that was WAY too much meat! (We really only ate 4 racks total) I lined all 6 racks on a baking sheet standing upright and cooked for 26 minutes. It came out a perfect medium rare and looked like something from a fancy restaurant. This is definitely a keeper!!!

Better than expected. The video from Chef John made it so simple!  Had to cook the rack an extra 10 minutes than the recipe called for but other than that it was exceptional.

Very nice; a lovely change for a traditional Sunday roast. I used a grainy mustard and Dijon mix to marry/transition the texture of the pistachio. Also used duck fat instead of vegetable oils.

I think this is one of the first recipes I've made off of this site that I followed exactly, and it was perfect! The timing is perfect for a medium rare. I made this for 4 men and one of them is a chef and everyone loved it! Thank you!

DELICIOUS! I had never made lamb before so watched the video that Chef John made. It was very easy to follow and turned out amazing. Probably the best lamb I have ever had. It practically fell off the bone it was so tender!

Absolutely phenomenal recipe.  The rack of lamb came out tender and juicy and perfectly done.  I think my boyfriend fell in love with me just a little more when I made this for him the other day.  Better than restaurant quality!  Would recommend to anyone and everyone!

I made this on Father's Day to break our fast and it was THE. GREATEST. THING. EVER!!  The lamb was amazingly tender and flavorful. I made my own Herbes de Provence minus the lavender.  I was out dijon mustard and used spicy brown mustard with a good amount of sugar.  Very honey-mustardesque.  Crumb mixture was so good that we added it to the leftovers.  I served it with Potato Roses but I shingled, rolled and stood them upright instead of stacking like a pyramid.  Really pretty presentation.  Also had wax and whole green beans with sun dried tomatoes.  Loved it and can't wait to make it again.  Thanks Chef John!

Excellent flavor! The 25 minutes oven time was definitely at the bottom end of rare, and I generally like things medium. I'd recommend 30-35 minutes for those who feel the same.

Great recipe. I loved how the lamb had to be browned first, enhancing the effects of spices. I used homemade herbe de provence and it tasted fantastic! Made 6 racks for a party, and the plate was empty within minutes of serving.

Totally amazing recipe - my lamb-hating husband has now declared this to be a favorite dish.  The flavor of the pistachios combined with the mustard and meat is out of this world. Thanks Chef John!

The recipe was very tasty. I made it for our wedding anniversary dinner because I was trying to be fancy. However, I spent like the whole day working on it and I don't know if it was tastier than other lamb recipes, plus lamb racks and pistachios are expensive, so I can't say it was worth the time and effort to be honest. If time and money are no object for you then definitely go for it! 

I also took another star off because I injured myself twice making this. The first was when I cut my finger "chopping" the pistachios (I highly highly recommend you do not attempt to chop them with a knife as the video suggests, I spent maybe 10 minutes trying to do that and the only thing that happened was pistachios flew everywhere, most of them just rolled around intact when my knife hit them, and I eventually got hurt. I have good sharp knives too, hence the injury. A much quicker and more effective method is a mallet. I'm sure a mortar and pestle would work too. I had neither, so I used the bottom of a glass and it was much more effective than the knife.

The second injury was when I was cutting the fat layer off the top of the meat as the video described. That was not the fault of the recipe, it was mainly because my index finger was bandaged from the pistachios and I was using my other, less dexterous fingers to manoeuvre the meat. 

In the end, it was a good meal, but the cost outweighed the benefit for me: it was expensive, took a lot of time and effort, and I sacrificed two finger

This was my first time making lamb hops and it was delicious! I bought a pack of 5 thick lamb chops and it was about $11.50 which really isn't that bad for a nice cut of meat. I would cook it for about 16 minutes in the oven and check on it, I wish I had shut my oven off then! Plus all ovens run differently. I didn't use breadcrumbs so it was gluten free. I used horseradish mustard as well. I would suggest making double the amount of pistaccio crust because I felt it could have used more of that flavor. I'll definitely be making it again with these adjustments but it was wonderful !

Rack of lamb is expensive and I was afraid of a bad experience but I made it two times and it is so good.

So delicious and easy!! I omitted the mustard because mustard is not my thing. I just melted butter to the pistachio mix to bond it.

Lamb is one of my favorite things to eat, however I was getting tired of spending a pretty penny to go eat it at a restaurant every time I had cravings. So as intimidated as I was, I decided to try this recipe. It was so simple and tasted amazing! Watching the video gave me the extra bit of courage I needed to accomplish this. The tanginess of the Dijon and the saltiness of the pistachios were a to-die-for combination! The cook time was spot on and I now have a new recipe that I'm excited to show off. I'll be making this for many years to come!

This is stupendous!  yes, it's a bit of a pricey cut of lamb, but for a special occasion, it's a winner - I've made this quite a few times and it's always been a hit ... please, if you don't try any other lamb recipe give this one a run for it's money, you won't be disappointed and it's so easy and looks and tastes wonderful!  
Thanks Chef John.

This tasted so good! I forgot to put butter in my crumb mix and so it got a little messy. But still good. I served it with cauliflower "mash potatoes" and a beet and goat cheese salad. YUM.

Delicious!  Instead of cutting the pistachios with a knife, I had a nut chopper which was safer and faster.  This paired well with caramelized Brussels sprouts with pistachios recipe also from this site.

I thought the mustard was going to be weird but it was very good.  I used a lamb tenderloin that I buy online since I could not find this cut anywhere even specialty butchers.  roasted it for a mere 14 minutes and checked the temp using a meat thermometer since I was concerned about over cooking. 14 minutes was perfect for medium.

This was the first time I attempted Rack of Lamb and was very happy with the response at the dinner table.  I substituted brown mustard for dijon, and rosemary, garlic, and parsley for the herbe de Provence because it's what I had on hand at the last minute.  Didn't seem to make much difference.  Will happily make it for company, planning on completing up to the browning step, storing it in refrigerator,  and roasting it at the last minute.

I didn't have any pistachios so I substituted chopped unsalted cashews.  THE CRUST IS AN EXQUISITE FINISH FOR THE LAMB.  Added to a small baked potato and fresh asparagus, a devine meal.

I have to have gravy with a roast, but because I had some bearnaise sauce left over, I decided to mix it with a dessert spoon of mint sauce.  Depth of flavor and bright highlight of mint sauce.  My husband and I spent the whole meal raving.

Yes couldn’t find the herbs so used mixed herbs plus marjoram. Don’t need to brown before baking. Have made it twice now. Thanks so much.

Made as written. Makes for a memorable dinner as the lamb is tasty and presents well. Pulled at 23 minutes, and internal temp was a bit higher than desired. Next time, plan to pull at 20 minutes with aim at 130 degree temp or slightly less (medium). Served with Uncle Dick's Mashed Potatoes and Doug's Easy Applesauce (both available on Allrecipes). Chef John makes it easy!

My boyfriend said "This is the best meal another human has made for me outside of a restauran!t" high praise from a man whose family are all great cooks. Thanks Chef John, you knocked it out of the park. 

I cooked it for 27 mins and then let it sit in a hot pan while it rested with foil for about 15-20 mins while I cooked the rest of dinner.  And that gave us a perfect medium

I too, would give this 10 stars if that was available. I followed the recipe exactly. I had to shell my own pistachios. Easy, easy, easy. Australian racks from Costco. This may well be the best lamb dish we have ever had. I served it with steamed broccoli and poached asparagus, and a caprese salad. Outstanding.

I swapped chopped Pistachio nuts and breadcrumbs for a Taste the difference prepared pistachio nuts and breadcrumb mix, as there were none available at the time. It did not detract from the taste or appearance.
Found this recipe very simple & quick to prepare and cook without losing any quality to the meat or flavour. I used top quality lamb and was rewarded with a delicious meal within 40 minutes.
Perhaps someone could advise on a Jus to accompany this dish?
Will definitely cook this again! nom nom :-)

This is a wonderful recipe. I have made it many times and always with excellent results. Sometimes I use cashew, pecan, or macadamia nuts instead of pistachios. Also, I've found that after searing, cutting the ribs through just down to the meaty part of every second rib enhances the flavor. This makes it easier to carve without the nut crust falling off.  I always serve a double rib portion.  My guests absolutely love it.

This is so OUTSTANDING that we intend to use this coating for other roasted meats!  On Rack of Lamb, it is visually stunning, and incredibly tasty!   There were only 5 us, with a full range of side dishes, but every single crumb was eaten and the juice sopped up with the last of the dinner rolls!   If Elegant and Delicious Easter Dinner is on you agenda for next  year, PLAN ON THIS DISH!

I love this recipe!  My husband even picked up the chop to eat it to the bone.  I think the recipe calls for more pistachios then you actually need for two racks and I would watch the time after fifteen minutes in the oven since we like our lamb rare.  The first couple of times I over cooked it for our tastes.  Still delicious, but more medium well than rare.  Tonight it came out perfectly with only 15 minutes in the over and a 5 minute rest.

Absolutely amazing! I followed the recipe 100% except for the mustard, I forgot to add it to the crust. 
The cooking time is perfect, it came out medium rare and the taste was fantastic! This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I made this and it was my very first attempt at cooking rack of lamb!  Followed Chef John's instructions exactly and it was amazing!  My family was very impressed and every lamb lollipop (as my daughter-in-law calls them) was eaten, no leftovers here! Thank you Chef John for another great recipe!

Awesome recipe with great flavor!  I had a chef friend over last night for Christmas Eve dinner and he recommended an oven temp of 350 and roast until meat thermometer reads 135.  They were perfect!

Was perfect. The lamb was tender and juicy. The crust didn't stay glued on for me but other then that it was perfect! I surprised the wife with this for Thanksgiving and she thought it was amazingly amazing. We will make this again for sure!
