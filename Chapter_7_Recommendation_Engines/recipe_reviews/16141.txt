This is pretty close to something I make myself. I omit the peppers and onions and add cucumbers, black olives, and Italian salami that has been sliced and quartered. You can also add shredded cheese of your choice for extra flavor.

Fast, easy, good.  Also added a small can of chopped black olives.  Made this again the other night and added about 1/3 cup chopped zucchini which really absorbed the dressing well.

We did eat this for days.  I took it to a cook out and it was devoured, but there was still plenty left.  This was my first time making a pasta salad and this was easy.  Definitely a good recipe.

Quick, easy, colorful, tasty, and the right proportions of ingredients.  Makes a giant bowl of the stuff and for a good reason.  Used "Italian Restaurant-Style Dressing" [http://salad.allrecipes.com/az/ItalianRestaurantStyleDres.asp] for the dressing and it went excellently.

Love the kind of noodles the recipe calls for. I especially enjoyed the flexibility this recipe allows. We don't like mushrooms so I simply added some extra vegetables of different kinds. This is an excellent dish to serve to any kinds of friends; if they are vegetarians, on a diet, or omnivores!  Changes I made: a Greek dressing (still fat-free) for a different flavor; pepperoni for my little sister; chicken when I served as a main dish (I wouldn't recommend adding both pepperoni and chicken together; these are all tips from different meals.)All in all, this is an excellent recipe!

I really like this fresh, easy recipe.  I had to add a little more dressing because it was a little too dry to start with.  I also sometimes add a few chunks of cheddar cheese and salami--yum!

This was good, but I would suggest adding some cheese of some kind and using more dressing. Also, I like using the tri color spiral pasta. This is a good start. Thanks.

I have never cared for pasta salad but decided to give it another try as it's really popular at every family gathering.  I wasn't disappointed by this recipe.  It's simple, fast, and tasty.  If you plan on eating this over the course of a few days, you may want to have some extra dressing on hand as the pasta and vegetables will absorb it and the salad may become a bit dry.  It all depends on your preferences and how well you store it.  For extra fun, use some of the coloured pastas!  They taste the same but make for a much more colourful dish.

I have been making a similar salad all my cooking years (55).  I add a can of small black pitted olives, cut in half, a can of chick peas and sometimes sharp cheddar diced into small cubes.  You can also add Feta cheese and sun dried tomatoes.  It is unbelievably delicious and quite pretty to look at when put on the table for a bbq party.  Not to mention.....healthy.  (I use whole wheat rotelle pasta)

Due to the family being picky, I had to change this a tad. Used a can of sliced olives (drained), cut up a pint of grape tomatoes, used tri-color pasta for more color, and added more dressing. Kidos like Parmesan cheese on top. Yummy.
